{"text":"Shu mai and pork juicy dumplings. Was good but not the best. For the food you get it's over pricey. There's lots of places much better."}
{"text":"Coming from the bay and having a variety of delicious food I was impressed. Legit the best soup dumplings, I've had. This place was amazing and service was fantastic!!"}
{"text":"Best Kung pao chicken in town!! Not your ordinary Chinese delivery. Fast, friendly and delicious !!"}
{"text":"Food is delicious.   Service is good and food comes out hot and fresh, not sitting on some cart.   Prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"Worst dim sum ever... Open at 11 but no baked buns till noon. Fishy shrimp har gow....   The list goes on. Get me outa here now!"}
{"text":"A great Dim Sum place on the West Side. Not sure what the issues all of the previous posters had. I've eaten there 2x now, and both times were just great.  Food was good, service was excellent, and price was reasonable. Please don't let the previous posters scare you away. Give it a try and you won't be sorry."}
{"text":"I love Dim Sum and this place was close to where I was running errands. The other yelp reviews weren't too kind, but I went anyway. Although they don't have a cart and you just order off the menu, the food was great! The prices are reasonable and there's lots of flavor. I'd go back as the servers are kind and had great recommendations."}
{"text":"Ok, I need to update my review because Cafe Dim Sum seems to have changed owners and *definitely* the cook.  The food is nothing like it was before.  Egg Drop soup is sub-par - service is excellent.  The shrimp and pork dim sums are great.  But their menu has changed completely.  Authentic Chinese dishes have been replaced with Americanized \"orange\" and \"sweet-sour\" chicken.   This place has become just another Chinese Restaurant - with absolutely nothing special to offer.  If you live in the area, give them a try, but I used to drive 20 miles to eat here - no more."}
{"text":"I'm Asian and I've eaten at many dim sum restaurants, and this is my take on the Dim Sum Cafe:   The variety of dim sum dishes is good. You might think that this restaurant doesn't carry as much variety as other dim sum restaurants, but that is because this restaurant only has several carts circulating around the restaurant at any given time, so it looks like there is less choices.  However, they do not have the more traditional dim sum houses choices like preserved duck-egg congee and tofu/ginger.  The quality of dim sum is good. Thumbs up for taste & freshness. No difference in portion size, and dishes were not greasy. The chicken steamed buns were a bit dry & doughy, but all other choices were excellent.  Price is comparable to other dim sum restaurant. Our check for 4 was the same as other dim sum places.  No pushy dim sum cart lady coming by every minute disturbing your meal. The cart comes out maybe 2-3 times total in the whole meal. Only a few of the staff is Asian, which is OK because the non-Asian staff appeared to be knowledgeable about the menu and was attentive. This might be a good dim sum starter restaurant for those who want decent dim sum but don't want the hustle of Chinatown.  The decor is clean with some fish aquariums, but there is absolutely nothing Asian about it. You wouldn't know you're in an Asian restaurant and thought you were in a really clean Denny's. Perhaps restaurant management can put a couple of inexpensive Asian-like items (lanterns, bamboo, red color, etc) to be consistent with the restaurant's name.  Crazy menu needs to be refined. What is with the hamburger and sandwiches? Not sure why they feel the need to stick American breakfast stuff and other items in the menu, and why customers will go to a dim sum restaurant to get American food.  This is very confusing and gives the impression that management does not know what they are doing.    Their dim sum is good, it's also the name of the restaurant, so they should clean up the menu and stick to what they do well...dim sum!"}
{"text":"Love love Love! The crab claw, shrimp ball, bbq pork noodle, shrimp noodle, shrimp dumpling, potstickers all are amazing!!!! Thank you we will be back"}
{"text":"Been waiting for a good Chinese place with reasonable prices.  This place beat good and went straight to great! Great food & great prices.  Used Eat24 for delivery such friendly service!!!!!"}
{"text":"My second second visit and so far food I would recommend if your the mood for Chinese delacasie. .I gave them 4 stars because the people are friendly and acknowledged my concern about one the meal I had on my first visit. The place is clean and cozy..I can have to admit I will be back again. I don't normally re visit other chinese restaurant I have been in this town. This is might the only one I would definitely keep coming back as long they stay consistent.."}
{"text":"When you can't make it to Chinatown, this is the next best thing!  No carts but fresh and delicious!  Also very clean friendly atmosphere.  Great service!"}
{"text":"I would give this place below 1 if I could. The food had awful smell. Seemed like all the food were old and reheated. We ordered chowmein which was all rubbery and smelled disgusting."}
{"text":"I must admit that I was not impressed the first time, but I love dim sum and the location is near my office, so I gave it a second chance and it was much better, I would go again, it is more expensive than the restaurants in Chinatown but if you don't want the hassle of driving and waiting, this restaurant is a good choice."}
{"text":"Coming to Dim Sum Cafe always brings back my childhood. The food is so authentic to my old school roots. Dim Sum is so good and my favorite dish is Tomato Beef, ask for pan froed noodles with it and you wont be sorry."}
{"text":"The food are very delicious service are great. Give the place a visit and you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Well, no more driving to Chinatown for excellent dim sum. Everything was so fresh, tasty and juicy. The duck was great as the skin was crispy and the meat juicy. The egg tarts are as good as I've ever had. It's so nice to have found this place near our home.  We will be coming here frequently."}
{"text":"We have been here a couple times now and will probably be back again. There's good dim sum that's served all day for great prices. It's a clean restaurant with very clean bathrooms. I highly doubt they will ever be on dirty dining unlike those other Chinese restaurants on Spring Mountain. They have excellent and quick service.  The ambiance is relaxing with real fish tanks and the sound of running water. There are also TVs and daily food specials . Overall, this is a great place to eat and hang out."}
{"text":"Excellent food, very very clean and great service. The baked BBQ pork buns are amazing! Chive dumplings are best I've ever had. Potstickers are so so, but everything else is fantastic! Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Upon hearing about this place on Yelp, I thought I would check it out. It really is a nice place, friendly staff. The owner made a special point to suggest the soup dumplings, which were very good. My Husband loved the onion pancakes; he gobbled them right down. We had may diff types of dim sum, all were very good.they cook it to order, so it's fresh. They don't have the ladies pushing around those  metal carts teaming with dimsum. Then we had a Mongolian beef plate, so good!!! We loved it, we will be back!"}
{"text":"I like the Dim Sum here! Steam dumplings,??????are good! The service is OK. I will come back next time!"}
{"text":"Dim sum for dinner!!! YES Please! The dim sum and the entree items were great! We got: shu mai, har gow, steamed bbq pork buns, fried rice combination, xiao long bao, honey walnut shrimp, eggplant dish, and the dessert. My friends and I spoke to the owner, Sheila tonight. She spoke to us about the menu and how everything is made in house, including the wrapper for the dim sum. Not only are the wrappers made in house but also the noodles for the soups and stir frys. No frozen crap! The extra steps and details are appreciated and noticeable in flavor and texture. I am comparing the dim sum to other dim sum restaurants in the valley. I did read other reviews on Dim Sum Cafe stating that there isn't as much variety of dim sum as other restaurants. That is true but quality over quantity. Think about all the items that are available else where. And ask yourself how did they mass produce all of that shu mai and har gow??? Could it be that they do it prior to you ordering it or perhaps imported frozen goods? Anyways, if you could compare them side by side, you'd see what I am talking about. I wish the Dim Sum Cafe a lot of business!! To all the dim sum fanatics and the newbies get your dim sum on anytime!! Xie Xie for reading."}
{"text":"Oh my god how does this place only have 3.5 stars?? Of course, I skimmed through the reviews on yelp before heading here and seems like most people took off stars because they don't have the carts so it's not a true dim sum experience. Well I think the quality of the food makes up for all of that! Even the beef and broccoli off the regular menu was delish! Everything from the sauce for egg roll to the steamed pork buns and rice noodles was just so tasty. Some yelpers pointed out that most dim sum places have the food out on the cart so long that it's not really fresh and some are probably even microwaved. I totally agree with them and actually really enjoyed the made-to-order freshness of the food. Best Chinese food I've had in a while!"}
{"text":"I drive all the way across Vegas for this. I live in Chinatown, but prefer this over any other place I have had dim sum. My favorites are the Chinese sausage rolls, shrimp shu mai, and the steamed bbq pork buns. I have also had the little spare ribs, which were sweet to savory, with 2 slices of jalapeno. The bbq pork buns come in an order of 3. I made the \"accident\" of 4 orders, so 12 total, and I have no regrets. I really like how the curry cheese wantons turn out, I am not a fan of curry but I crave these."}
{"text":"I finally went in for lunch after driving by nearly everday for the past 2 years.  I was a little reluctant from some of the reviews, but I tried it anyway and I must add my two cents.  The service we received was prompt and friendly.  Our food came out in a timely fashion...and it was very tasty.  I typically dont care for egg drop soup, but it came with the lunch special, so I tasted it...then I finished the whole bowl.  The broth was delicious.  The egg roll was super good and the amount of chicken lo mein was enough for two meals, which I did take home....because it was totally worth eating a second time.   We also had the bbq pork buns, they werent the best ive ever had...but still worth eating and enjoying.  I will be back again...I hope its just as good."}
{"text":"Baked Pork Rolls = Awesome Fried Calamari = OK Hot and Sour Soup = Legit Chive Dumpling = Best I had while I was there  There's a lot of items to choose from and I'll be back to sample the rest, definetley coming back"}
{"text":"I don't pretend to be a dim-sum expert, but so what if they have hamburgers on the menu and non-Asian staff?  The bottom line is that the food and the service are good. In addition, the restaurant is quiet enough that you can actually have a conversation, which is more than can be said for some dim-sum restaurants in Chinatown.  I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"We have really struggled to find good Chinese and then we came across this place! Their dim sum are wonderful, their steamed pork dumpling, are amazing and juicy. They also have some very tasty entrées, I highly recommend the cashew chicken and vegetable fried rice! They are always friendly and helpful, plus they deliver!"}
{"text":"Best dim sum we had so far.  We like that foods served hot and fresh.  We liked deep fried meatballs, mushroom ship mai, shrimp in rice noodle roll, Singapore noodle, snowpea leaves and garlic.  The foods was great to our taste, not too salty.  Definitely come back if we are in town again."}
{"text":"Fresh made to order dim sum. Large variety of dim sum, love the fact that it's not off a cart so it's guaranteed fresh. Location is in Summerlin so you don't have to go all the way to Spring Mountain!"}
{"text":"Surprised at the reviews describing poor service from this place. Our experience was great. Our server was very nice and even apologized for bringing our young son a glass of water. He immediately returned with a plastic cup w/straw without us even asking.   As for the food, everything we ordered was delicious. Generally, I trust my husband to order for us, but I had some specific cravings in mind this time - radish cake, pan fried chive dumplings, sticky rice, and bbq pork buns. All were great!  Prices were amazing too, we got a lot of food (2 plus toddler) for only $40. Definitely recommend this place for anyone craving dim sum!"}
{"text":"Me and my husband decided to check Dim Sum Cafe out since it is right by our house and its great! The restaurant is open with a lot of seating and the staff is very friendly. When we went we did not see a dim sum cart probably because it was later in the night and not many customers were in and actually im not too sure if they even have one haha. Over all the Dim Sum is great, everything is tasty and we enjoyed the whole experience."}
{"text":"We found this place through Yelp when Orchids Garden was shut down for several weeks following an inspection failure. Was skeptical at first but to our surprise the food here was just as great as Orchids Garden! We swear the cook must have used to work there at some point because it tastes exactly the same! We have been coming here since especially that it is a much closer drive. Definitely recommend this place. The staff is very nice as well. Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"Excellent dim sum and the  lunch special was great. The staff are very friendly. Service was awesome.  This place is different from other dim sum's restaurant, there is no cart, which is GREAT !, because everything is fresh and hot !  and made to order.   Not like other places, Dim Sum Cafe does not use too much salt and no MSG, but yet still so tasty. I went there for lunch, it's almost full ! I am glad, because I want them to succeed. GREAT PLACE, GREAT PRICE, GREAT SERVICE !"}
{"text":"Just a quick update: We still love coming here, but it had been awhile since our last visit.  However, as soon as we came in today, they remembered us.  And, they had kept the training chopsticks that my daughter had left at out last visit.  We didn't even realize that she had left them and for them to hold on to them so they could return them just speaks to their excellent customer service!"}
{"text":"off the strip, west side spring valley..so you don't have to fight the typical Chinatown madness  came in at 1130am for sunday dim sum and ordered 10 typical dim sum selections, as the regulars of this cuisine are well aware of.  items ordered from menu, no carts...the kitchen made everything on demand based on the order ticket, which has its pros (fresh, hot and very tasty morsels) and cons (when the walk ins started coming in your order may take longer than expected). everything was well seasoned and not overly salty (leaving you with the typical MSG thirst as with other eateries)  quality and flavor are at least comparable to main Chinatown dim sum eateries in a very clean environment, courteous staff  however, I recommend coming in early for dim sum and order all your items at one time so the kitchen ticket will be prioritized before other orders that come in subsequent to yours. We ordered baked bao and after a half hour wait, told the waiter to cancel it since we were done with our meal. When he settled the bill, the brought us the order, on the house!  definite should try spot"}
{"text":"Authentic Chinese & Dim Sum eatery. Excellent service. Good selection of Ala Carte Dim sum and regular Chinese dishes. Everything from egg tarts, har gow (steamed shrimp dumplings), stir fry, fried rice, red bean paste deep fried pastry and all the regular dishes u would get at a Chinese restaurant in Chinatown is well executed. A no frills, clean, nice ambience ( for an Asian diner ) and surprisingly good service for an Asian place. Prices are aok (I.e. Higher than Chinatown but its in summerlin so it is on pricey side). It's a keeper and my favorite local go-to place for a good Chinese meal. As a frame of reference for this eval, me and my family have lived in Hong Kong, Thailand, Sydney, New York City and lived/traveled around the world (including China, Singapore, Vietnam - so we have sophisticated taste buds, and know a good honest Chinese eatery when we experience one. Hope this place is here to stay. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I like it when I'm able to order what dim sum I want and they all come out hot versus trying to hunt down the right carts. The decor of this place is pretty nice too. Very clean. Has buncha TVs for sports and stuff to keep you entertained. Food comes out pretty fast too. The only reason I docked off one star is becuz the older guy waiter could be a little warmer with his service. Everytime we said thank you after he brought out something, he would say nothing back."}
{"text":"Been there twice now. I get the the bbq pork stem buns, actually I get four orders of bbq pork stem buns. They are moist, soft, and similar to what I envision the food from heaven to taste like. Also, I'm pretty sure the noodles are home made. I can't wait for my third visit."}
{"text":"Can't wait to come back. So far the best soup dumplings in AZ.  Looking forward to coming back and trying other things on the menu. Today was just a soup dumpling day and I'm so glad I drove a little further from home to get a much better place to eat the addicting soup dumpling. Thank you Dim Sum Cafe."}
{"text":"The food and service was very good and the prices are cheap compared to other Dim Sum places here in Las Vegas. I would give it five stars but because of how busy the place gets and how little the staff are in numbers, at least one of your orders will be forgotten. I can't complain though, the food was very good!"}
{"text":"I love this place for dim sum and Chinese dishes.  No dim sum carts, but even better because everything is made fresh to order at dim sum prices and all your dim sum faves.  A plus for the Summerlin area.  Friendly staff and a nice clean restaurant.  A must try for Chinese in Summerlin!"}
{"text":"What a gem! First of all, they have amazing Shanghai soup dumplings. If you've never had them, do yourself a favor and drop in -- the best I've had outside of NYC. Beef chow fun, and amazing bok choy in garlic sauce. The owner Sheila is lovely. Can't wait to go back and try more dishes!"}
{"text":"Everything was incredible!! The soup dumplings was my absolute favorite. Such flavorful broth. And the service is great. They are willing to explain any dish you are unfamiliar with. Definitely will go there again!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Great food and great service. The food is very fresh and the restaurant is very clean. By far the best Chinese restaurant in Las Vegas. My only complaint  is that they don't have a location in Henderson."}
{"text":"Prices are decent amd the food was great !  Picked up the food amd it was fresh and ready by the predicted time !  I got the fried shrimp dumplings and the pork dumplings. The shrimp was very crunchy and came with good mayo sauce and the dumplings were VERY juicy but the sauce was a bit too watery.   Overall, would definitely order from here again !"}
{"text":"Very tasty food. Friendly staff.  My husband and I loved it. We will be back soon.   Shrimp, pork, chicken we tried it all.  Everything was excellent."}
{"text":"Dimsum is typical..service is THE WORST!!! Only 2 tables in this whole place and server is very inattentive. Had to walk up behind the wall to ask for soy sauce and water refill bc he has not checked on us aside from dropping off the food. Not coming back"}
{"text":"This was a great find! The food is delicious & reasonably priced. The staff is very attentive & friendly. The establishment is very clean and my friend said the restroom is spotless! We ordered 6 different dishes & 2 of which they recommended. Everything tasted fresh and flavorful & we only paid $30 for everything! By far better than some of the places in Chinatown & way closer to us!"}
{"text":"Horrible service. Got stink eye and pretty much yelled at while asking for some hot sauce. The older lady just stood there while the older man gave such attitude.  From what I read on the other reviews, service seems to be the problem here.  I've been here multiple times within a short two week span when I moved here and this is how a repeat customer got treated. I guess they don't know the rule of 80/20..  Shame..."}
{"text":"Looking for a place not in Chinatown for some good dim sum, it tasted like rubber. I also tasted the Chinese food for my kids and it also terrible. How can you mess up Chinese food? No taste!"}
{"text":"My family and I ate here for dinner on a Friday night. The food was excellent. They have dim sum and other Chinese food all on one menu. While they don't have ladies pushing dim sum carts, they prepare your dishes fresh for you.  We ordered the beef fried rice (moist and flavorful), char siu bao (yum, not too sweet) and the pork sumai (meaty and flavorful). We also ordered potstickers and shrimp sumai which my family said were delicious.  The restaurant was very clean and the bathrooms were very clean as well.  This was some the best dim sum and Chinese food I've had outside of San Francisco and Houston."}
{"text":"We went for lunch. Had soup dumplings, gingery vegetable spring rolls, fried bread, and beef chow fun. Prompt service and just delicious! We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Great family owned Dim Sum restaurant in Summerlin that serves dim sum all day and SUPER fresh. Made to order! Love the congee with century egg, Shrimp in rice noodle, chicken bun because I don't eat pork and shrimp with eggplant or tofu. The prices are way better then some dim sum restaurants in Chinatown. Love how clean the place is too! Definitely adding to my faves!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent dim sum and the house special spare ribs are amazing !  Definately going back"}
{"text":"I gave this place a second chance. The food has improved greatly. Staff is also friendly. Not many people."}
{"text":"You have got to try this place!  I went the first time about a month ago with my husband after seeing it listed as a new restaurant on Yelp.  I'm so glad we went!  The servers are friendly, and explain all the options.  Sheila, the owner, is wonderful!    I suggested this as a fun place to go celebrate some birthdays with some girls from work, and everyone loved it!  They even brought us their signature banana dessert as a gift for the celebration.    Every item is made fresh to order, so it is very tasty, but don't count on it to be \"fast food.\"  It didn't take long at all, and we appreciated how good everything tasted coming straight from the kitchen.  YUM!  We will definitely be back!  Note, the map shows them in the strip mall facing Guadalupe.  They are actually at the very end of the strip, facing Alma School.  Definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Ok so it's been awhile since I've had dim sum and mainly because of my last experience years ago at a location in Chinatown, where all things that could go wrong....WENT WRONG. However, I've been wanting to find a place where people have loved and tried out before I went to one again and when a customer recommended I check this place out, I did so the very next day! The ambiance needs a little work.. booths and seat are outdated. The ceilings/roof tops are creative but fall short of reaching an actual design and the dinnerware and.tea cups needed to be washed again. So that's the bad now here's the good: place felt and smelled clean! The restrooms were amazingly clean and comfortable to be in your own individual stall and the design of it was so nice I wish they carried out the same flow into the restaurant but maybe somewhere down the line.. the food: BOMB!!! Clean, fresh, seasoned perfectly and delicious!!! Overall I gave it 5 stars because the good outweighed the bad and their service was attentive and pleasing! We will be back soon! Hopefully the décor will be updated? Lol"}
{"text":"Visited this restaurant again tonight. Still very happy with the selections, portions and service. Food is pipping hot, and I think this must be the cleanest place in town. We are going to try to go here more often, we want them to stay in business!"}
{"text":"Great food at a reasonable price , without going all the way to spring mountain and having to deal with all that traffic.  And I know great chinese food since I am from New York and have eaten in the greatest Chinese restaurants in Chinatown. So check it out and find out for yourself."}
{"text":"Excellent! Excellent! Both dine-in and takeout. I'm a picky Chinese eater so I don't just fall for whatever restaurant names itself authentic but I love Dim Sum Cafe's authentic Chinese dishes."}
{"text":"Did not enjoy this restaurants' dim sum. Everything we had tasted like they had just pulled it from the freezer section at a grocery store. In all honesty, you would be better served to stop at a Chinese grocery and steam your own dim sum than coming here."}
{"text":"I came here today Thursday 1/22/15 with my mom who lives nearby.   It was 4:15 pm.  We were the only ones in there and the person at the desk was less than friendly.  The same person came and got our drink order of hot tea.  When he returned I ordered some har gow, pork shiu mai, chive dumplings, and goyzas and or potstickers.   In a very rude tone asked me what language I was speaking and left and gave me a dirty look.  I left $5 dollars on the table and left.  So sad."}
{"text":"Having the calamari in black bean sauce and red bean ice. Calamari is delicious! I love how the vegetables are crispy, not soggy from being overcooked, and the sauce is not overpowering. Red bean ice simple yet delicious.  So far my only gripe about this place is the price but considering I don't have to drive 30-45 minutes to get here, I'm willing to come back here over and over."}
{"text":"I recently visited this special jewel of Chinese restaurant during my company's conference in Phoenix. I was blown away for the authenticity of the Chinese dishes that I had, and more so, the amazing hospitality of the owner Shiela and her husband.   I came from San Francisco and I can honestly say, the food is on par or even better then a lot of the restaurants in the Bay Area. And I am extremely happy and gratified to have the opportunity to visit this special place.   If you have not try it... I strongly urge you to give it a try. I can promise you, you will be utterly amazed by its authenticity, hospitality, and cozy atmosphere!!!"}
{"text":"Staff was friendly, food was good, restaraunt was clean and beautiful !! Simple place,  you could tell they care for it their. I came on a solo-date (treat yoself??) And had a good time, their Thai tea tastes kind of funky but that's about the only complain I have. It wasn't bad just 'off'"}
{"text":"I remember hearing so many negative reviews when they opened. I love having dim sum close to home and honestly, this place is fine. Some items are really not good and some are on par with the other dim sum places in town. It's a bit hit or miss but once you find the items you like, it's consistent. The service is usually pretty friendly and they've never messed up our order (which is a lot kore than I can say for some of the other places)."}
{"text":"Highly recommend if you have a hankering for dim sum outside of normal dim sum hours. The siu mai were large and tasty and everything came to the table steaming and fresh. The owner came by all the tables to greet the guests and the wait staff was quick to clear empty dim sum dishes and refill the teapot. The owner said it was a slow night when we were there, but only 2 tables were open. Normally it's really busy on a Saturday night, but we must have hit it just right."}
{"text":"Good Dim Sum place, good price point. Nice clean establishment with good service.  Usually have it to go when I'm in town.  Would recommend to stop in for quick bite.  Not as good as ones in San Francisco but very good for being in Vegas  and like the price."}
{"text":"We live in Central Phoenix and drive out to MESA just for the Dim Sum. It is great. Everything is made to order. So some of the Dim Sum takes a little bit longer than other things but it has been worth the trip every time. The owner is a very pleasant lady and willing to explain everything. Give it a try. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Husband's choice to dine here to lunch with father-in-las, little bro & daughter. Ordered Family Dinner C: 4 egg drop soups, 4 egg rolls, a handful of curry cream cheese rangoons, chicken lo mein, sweet & sour chicken, BBQ pork fried rice & Mongolian beef. More than enough food for everyone! We also got 2 orders of pork shu mai, 1 shrimp shu mai & a shrimp in rice noodle.  A lot of food for a good price! Can't wait to come here again. Just wish the service was a little more attentive. The food came out fast & steaming hot. Everything was delicious & did not disappoint!"}
{"text":"Being new to Dim Sum and my husband being a pro we wanted somewhere that would have a great variety with amazing service and we found it! This restaurant is clean, the staff is beyond friendly, and the food was delicious. Everything is made fresh and we were able to get our food quickly! We were checked on regularly and our glasses were never empty. I HIGHLY recommend coming here and I know we will be back!!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best dim sum I have outside of San Francisco. I will he coming back here again"}
{"text":"Great, fresh dim sum made to order. I used to go to the many cart places around town but their food is disappointing and inconsistent. Ordered a bunch of stuff right off the bat and it took them about 10 minutes to get it all out to me. Hot, fresh chinese sausage buns with really soft dough. Juicy shrimp har gow. Baked pork bun had delicious filling.  Definitely will be coming back many times over. They also have delivery so I'll have to try that. The service was friendly and prompt as well. Be back soon"}
{"text":"Love the Shanghai dumplings! Shallot pancake was interesting! Nice atmosphere and friendly people"}
{"text":"Ok place to eat.  Hard selling some of dishes Very spacious and not too long of wait.  Food can be better"}
{"text":"Waited a few years before going here...The food was almost average the chili sauce on the table tasted like wood chips in oil. 2 stars for nice TV's, chopsticks and silverware. The staff seemed like they did not want to be there. The interior design is very strange small stars on the ceiling, mostly closed in booths and green walls?  The small fish tanks need to be removed strange power cord mess ( electrical hazard.) must be pain to keep the fish tanks cleaned. The entire space needs to be remodeled more OPEN would be nice.. Strange they have 30 security cameras inside and outside when the location is in Summerlin its NOT the ghetto... P.S. they do have a HELP wanted hand written sign posted on the front door if you want help them redesign and make it more open and friendly or maybe some super KUHL ASIAN FUSION DIM SUM... We will not be going back to the UFO DS cafe..."}
{"text":"The food there was horrible. Some of the dim sum had no flavor, while the other were too salty and oily. The service there was bad. The server pushed us to order from the more expensive dishes and dessert. I can understand that up selling is good for this company, but the way she went about it let us felt very comfortable. Sadly we will not be coming back here again."}
{"text":"Sometimes when the place you want to eat is too far, you look into alternatives that are closer. We were craving dim sum and the 30 minute drive across town to our usual spot didn't seem ideal, so we checked to see what was nearby and found this place in half the distance. SCORE!  But you know how they say, \"Stick to your bread and butter?\" Aka, stick to what you know?   Well... I don't want to completely bash this place. The location is convenient and near the freeway, and the venue itself has lots of seating, is very clean and is decorated well!   But at the end of the day, the food just didn't do it for us... at all. We ordered a handful of things from the menu (shrimp shumai, shrimp har gow, sharksfin dumpling, curry cream cheese wontons, baked sweet cream bun, etc), and while everything was presented well -- everything was \"just okay.\" It all really lacked flavor or just... wasn't good. We did NOT eat everything we had ordered AND we did NOT take it home (even though our server kept insisting we finish eating before she cleared the table).   Needless to say, we would rather do twice the travel time/distance to Orchid Garden and will not be returning here. Sorry!"}
{"text":"I'm Asian and from San Francisco. Finding good chinese food anywhere is hard to do. Glad I came upon this place! They serve dim sum and other dishes all day long. This is chinese food, not American chinese food! All the dim sum is cooked to order and not sitting in a cart or in the back. When you order it, they go and make it, so everything is fresh and hot.  The look of the restaurant is not chinese at all. Appears to have been some other kind of restaurant before, but it's very clean. It's in a little strip mall away from all other things asian, but that's fine with me. No longer eat dim sum in the hotels or along Spring Mountain.  We had a car so we don't mind driving around finding places to eat. Plus we're staying with family out in the Summerlin area so it was about a 20 minute drive via the freeway.  Told my brother about it so we all came for dinner 2 nights later. It was yummy! Ate other dishes but was so excited I forgot to take pictures."}
{"text":"Very unhappy with this place sadly. The potstickers were soggy, the egg rolls bland and not chripsy, the lo mein had no flavor and smelled gross, even the rice wasn't good. The one thing I was excited about, Miso soup, was gross! I've never had bad miso till now. The seaweed was clumped and weird colored, the soup itself had no flavor! How is that possible?! So we will not be going back to this place again. Better luck for others."}
{"text":"On our quest to find a dim sum place closer to home, we decided to check this place out. As previous posts stated, there are no carts and you order directly from a menu. This just means the food comes out piping hot and fresh. The selection of dim sum was excellent, at least for the items I usually order. The service was average, but they get kudos for being attentive.  The food was delicious. Prices are a little higher than our usual dum sum place.  The only criticism was there were two items we ordered that they ran out of. It is a major pet peeve of mine when you have regular menu items out of stock, it implies someone is not doing their job at inventory when you are out of multiple items. One is understandable, but three?  Overall, a good experience and we will probably be back again."}
{"text":"My wife and I dined here a couple of weeks ago, on the recommendation of Mrs. Wong, who owns and operates another Las Vegas Dim Sum and fine Chinese dining restaurant where we love to eat, the Orchids Garden. The Dim Sum Cafe is owned by her son, and can he ever make some wonderful dim sum!!! We were really amazed and proud for Mrs. Wong that her son was following in her (and her husband's) foot steps of running a 1st class establishment. We were treated to some of our old favorites, the shu mai and the turnip cakes, which were tasty, tasty tasty!!! We ate so much wonderful dim sum, topped off with jin dui (sesame balls) and hot tea for desert. Outstanding!! The prices were very reasonable and the service was great!! We will return!!"}
{"text":"Was happy to try this place cause it's so close to my house. But was highly disappointed. Mediocre at best. Everyone who ate it agreed."}
{"text":"This place is delicious. I came here because of all the good reviews I saw on yelp and they are all true. They don't have a giant selection but the items they do have they do very well. It was a lovely place, I will definitely be returning"}
{"text":"Service was ok. The place was clean. We ordered each item off the dim sum menu and honestly, the only thing I really like was the soup dumpling."}
{"text":"Outstanding, freshly prepared Dim Sum. Went here for lunch and were very pleasantly surprised. We've had Dim Sum all over and this was definitely among the best. Fast and friendly service. Super clean and bright environment. Very deserving of all the 5 star ratings. Getting everything right after being only being open for four months."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the food here.  It was hot and fresh and very tasty....not to mention affordable!  Location is great for when us Summerliners don't want to drive to Korea town or the strip.  I will definitely be back....probably later this week"}
{"text":"Saw the review in Phoenix Times and decided to give it a try. Whenever I try a new dim sum place I always use har gow (shrimp dumplings) as an indicator of how well the prepare dumplings. In addition I ordered beef chow fun along with potstickers and soup dumplings.   Dumplings came out quickly and at the right temperature. Soup dumplings were seasoned well and very flavorful. The chow fun was excellent and the noodles were not \"gummy\" like you would find if they were sitting in a steam table.  I grew up in NYC Chinatown and this place reminded me of home. I am eager to return to try other items on the menu"}
{"text":"Made to order dim sum at any hour?? Sign me tf up!  I'm so happy to have found Dim Sum Cafe for not only their awesome quality dim sum, but for the rest of their food as well. I've been kind of burnt out from having a lot of bad chinese food in AZ- still have nightmares of stale rice, not so fresh ingredients, etc.. that is NOT the case at Dim Sum Cafe!   The chicken fried rice is the best we've had in a long time. Chicken was so tender and perfectly cooked, and rice was the freshest consistency with such good depth of flavors - absolutely NO burnt oil tastes, hard/stale rice, bland seasoning, or heavy greasy feeling here.   I also had the soup dumplings which were out of this world, paired with the vinegar/ginger dipping sauce. Shrimp dumplings were divine and shrimp was so nicely cooked inside!  My favorite dish was the water boiled chicken, spicy and juicy with amazing flavors plus that signature numbing feeling from the sichuan peppercorns.  Honestly my experience dining here was really great all around. Service from our waitress and the owner was warm and attentive and they were ready to help navigate or explain anything on the menu. The owner was also so sweet in helping me pack up my leftovers at the end of our meal. You can tell she takes a lot of care and pride in every aspect of the restaurant from the service, atmosphere/cleanliness, and of course the food - I liked reading in the description here on yelp that she's a foodie, I can tell by the way she runs the restaurant!  Dim Sum Cafe definitely tops my list as one of my fave Chinese restaurants in the East Valley and I will be back again and again!"}
{"text":"They the what most dim sum places serve. Love the  atmosphere in here. Rice cake was ok, on the drier side. Great service from everyone."}
{"text":"This place is so convenient! They do delivery, that's the best thing ever! Deliver Dim Sum to your home and enjoy at home! Food taste delicious as well, authentic Dim Sum for sure!"}
{"text":"Why is everyone giving this place mediocre rating? Cause there are no carts?  I personally loved my dinner here at Dim Sum Cafe. I love the location! Not on busy Spring Mountain Rd! Finally, a close Dim Sum spot by my place. The servers were really nice, all of them smiling & very helpful.  You pretty much order all the Dim Sum you want on a menu. As hungry as I was, I wish the food came out quicker but I appreciate & love the fact that they cook it & the food is not simply sitting on a cart.  I thought the food was delicious too! Not bland at all & seasoning was just right. I think the bad reviews stems from people having delicious Dim Sum outside of Vegas but think about it, we really don't have an extensive list here in town in the first place. Honestly, I think this place is underrated. The atmosphere was nice, the lighting was bright, ambiance was welcoming, seats were comfortable, the whole place was clean.. & most importantly, the food was not bad at all.  Of course, if you want your food fast, then go to Orchid Garden or something. This is just a place I'd go to when I want good quality & clean Dim Sum without having to travel too far."}
{"text":"Ok dim sum - had the shrimp har gow, shrimp shumai, pork shumai, black bean pork spare ribs, chinese brocolli and baked char sui buns. All was OK, but seemed the shrimp shumai was probably frozen, as was possibly some of the other dishes."}
{"text":"Had lunch here and it was very quiet. The server was more concerned about getting the TV to work than wait on us. There were several flat screen TVs  and fish tanks against the walls. The restaurant has incense  burning (possible issue if patron has asthma).   Food was average. I found it to be too salty. There was a wide range of Chinese dishes to order and then a dim sum menu. The Chinese menu had no descriptions or photos to help if the patron isn't familiar with the different types of noodles or other items.  The seating is booths and tables with armless chairs. It is wheelchair and scooter friendly."}
{"text":"Disappointed I didn't go to a true dim sum restaurant on Spring Mountain.  Like other Yelpers I thought I'd give this new place a shot. I was first excited about a dim sum place close to our Vegas house but then I was let down when I saw the menu. Their name \"Dim Sum Cafe\" implies that they know what dim sum is...but this place has little idea what they are doing.  The serving staff is predominantly non-Asian and had no clue what cheong fun noodles and traditional dim sum fare are.  I explained what I was looking for \"beef cheong fun\" and the server said they have it. When the dish arrived it was beef noodle stir fry- not even close to the flat rice noodle filled with beef, pork, or shrimp.  I ordered 2 and those plates never touched my table- I sent them back as soon as I saw them. It's like I went to a so-called hamburger stand and they had no clue what a cheeseburger is. Gawd. It took a while for them to figure out we need plates and I guess they didn't have chopsticks ready.    $4.25 eggroll (2 pieces): you think it would be good or large for the money, right? Wrong. It seemed like they just fried some eggrolls from Ranch 99 and charged $2 a piece. Super rip-off because the eggroll was not very tasty. Adding insult to injury my kid ordered a grilled cheese sandwich and they didn't have cheddar cheese so she got a grilled mozerella sandwich. Yuck.   Confused menu: small dim sum collection, American breakfast of oatmeal, waffles, french toast. Salads, spaghetti, and fish.   Wait staff was slow to figure out we needed place settings and our server acknowledged that they were having many customers complaining about the menu. Restaurant was clean (it's 2 weeks new) and the TVs on the wall still had the Energy Consumption sticker on them. No fish in the tanks yet, either.   I hope these reviews serve as a wake-up call to the owners. Vegas is not the kind of place that supports or tolerates a bad restaurant- especially one that leaves customers feeling tricked and overcharged. I would love to pay good money for good food, but this place is like its indoor wooden trellis: the structure is there but it isn't polished and leaves people asking the question \"Why?!\"  I'd skip this place until they get many of the wrinkles ironed out.  Hopefully they do it soon before the Grand Opening turns into the Grand Closing."}
{"text":"Very nice place. We were greeted the moment we stepped in the door for lunch. Our server, Alex, took great care of my wife and I. We started off with some Dim Sum/Apps: Pot stickers, Cream cheese won ton and baked BBQ pork buns. They were all delicious, well presented and reasonably priced. We then ordered the Mongolian Beef lunch special (7.95) which comes with 1 egg roll and a cup of egg drop soup. Usually the entree is spicy hot and I asked to have it toned down a bit. The soup and egg roll were very good and the Mongolian Beef was prepared just the way I requested...not too hot. Just enough kick to make you sweat a little. All in all it was a nice experience and good food for a reasonable price. The only thing that I noticed that was a bit disturbing were all of the surveillance cameras inside the restaurant  ..about 9 or 10. Kinda strange for such a small dining area."}
{"text":"In so many places across the country (I travel a lot) it is getting harder and harder to find a Chinese Restaurant doesn't serve slop, focus on take out, and expects those dining in to eat with cheap plastic utensils while the owners kids do homework at an adjacent formica table. I so glad to have found Dim Sum Cafe. The atmosphere is clean and comfortable, the food is fresh and well prepared, and the service is friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Not much for ambience,  but the food was quite wonderful.  Had the family dinner for four, egg drop soup not greasy; sweet and sour chicken excellent; fried rice actually possesed taste. Steamed red bean and sesame bun very sweet.  A little far out if you are from anywhere but summerlin,  but worth the drive."}
{"text":"Service was good but the pork dimsum we had had  an after taste to it. We didn't try other dimsum so we can't tell if they're all the same. Otherwise, I guess this place would be an acquired taste for some but unfortunately not for us."}
{"text":"Came here because of the reviews and wanted to try a new dim sum place. Well just straight to the point.  1. Our server didn't speak any English. So we couldn't ask any questions about the menu.  2. Dum sum is fast, these took forever 20 minutes for dim sum. Taste like everywhere else.  3. The other foods we ordered were just O.K.  4. Waitress never came checked on us. To busy helping the Chinese customers instead. Chinese customers that came in after us, got their food before us.   5. AND THE MAIN REASON  FOR THIS REVIEW. IS , I WROTE A $5.00 TIP ON THE CREDIT CARD RECEIPT BUT WHEN I CHECKED MY BANK THEY WROTE THEMSELVES A $12.83 TIP.  6. FOOD WAS ALREADY EXPENSIVE FOR THE QUALITY THAT WE GOT. WE DIDN'T even complain about the food. The server wouldn't even understand if we told her. We paid for the food left a 10% tip. But they put a 30% tip without my permission.  7. We never write any reviews on yelp, but in this situation it was forced upon us. To let all the other people about this restaurant.  EAT HERE AT YOUR OWN RISK. CHECK YOUR STATEMENT AFTER THE FACT."}
{"text":"This is not really a Cantonese restaurant. They have a selected few dim sum but it's not like the tradition canto style. It's more fusion between northern China since the Menu has a lot of those items such as Xiao LONG BAO. Customer service was excellent. A bit pricey."}
{"text":"We always go to Orchid Garden for Dim Sum. Now we are right around corner. Delicious, very good ,same owner."}
{"text":"I live a few blocks from this restaurant. I have been there two times. The first time, the service was terrible. It took about thirty minutes for my simple order of dumplings and shrimp to arrive. When it did arrive I had no utensils...e.g. Chop sticks, fork or even a napkin. Finally I got up and went and found a set of chop sticks. By that time the food was cold. The second time I went there no one ever waited on me. After about 20 minutes I got up and left.  The man standing at the register didn't even look up as I left.   This restaurant sucks. Don't waste your time or money."}
{"text":"We love this place. The food is good and service is great. Everyone ordered from here was excellent. The owner is nice and friendly and the restaurant is clean."}
{"text":"I realize almost everyone gave this place  5 or 4 stars.  However, here's my take on it.   1.  Entree prices are really high for Mesa... I expect higher prices in Scottsdale because of the high rents. Other than that, why does a Chinese entree need to be 13, 14,15 dollars? 2.  The portions are small.   3.  They don't carry brown rice.  White rice is your only option.  3.  The amount of meat in the meat dishes is underwhelming.  More veggies (onions) than anything else.  4.  The dim sum menu is limited.  I did enjoy the scallion pancake which was thicker than most versions I have eaten but at least it was not greasy as many of them tend to be. I thought the pork dumplings at $6.50 was a bit high.   5.  The service was attentive although when you ask a question, they have to bring out probably their only English speaking server.  I imagine that in two years time they will be all super fluent.  In the meantime....... 6.  The place is very clean.   7.  The food was tasty and they cooked it according to the spiciness we requested.   All in all, DIM SUM was not worth the trip for me so I'll pass on future visits."}
{"text":"I think they have new owners. Food tastes a little different. We had the fried rice with pork last night and it was good just no longer the best I ever had. A few other items also very good just seem different. Service was great like always and the food is fresh. Not bad in fact it's very good. It's just not as good as it used to be. If you love Chinese don't let that stop you. Your going to be hard pressed to beat this place in Arizona"}
{"text":"The place is very clean, the service was quick, courteous and friendly. We tried many different dishes and they were all good.  Especially good were the stuffed eggplant, the steamed pork dumplings (with broth inside- yum), the Har Gow and the pepper steak (really good). Definitely will be going again soon."}
{"text":"Here right now eating, service is amazing, food is amazing! Restaurant is very clean. Even though they close soon they are not rushing us. Definite plus. Will bring my friends and family here in the future"}
{"text":"It is my first time coming here and its not bad. The food is hot and fresh and the atmosphere of the place is very clean. The chive dumpling was burning hot but it was very good.  This place has its perk as it is near where I live and it serves dim sum hot. The taste of the dim sum taste is pretty good. I would come here again."}
{"text":"Excellent service and very tasty food. So glad this is on the West side of town and don't have to go to China Town and deal with traffic, congestion,  and parking issues."}
{"text":"Really great place to get Dim Sum. It's different than most.. Instead of having servers push around carts of the food, your order it as you would at a regular restaurant. Therefore, all of our food was fresh and delicious. And the price is unbelievable, probably payed a lot less than I would have at any of the Dim Sum restaurants near Chinatown. I think I've found my all time favorite dimsum restaurant :) will definitely be coming back soon!"}
{"text":"I stopped for lunch. Had the shrimp. It tasted raw. Hoping I wouldn't be sick. Didn't happen. Maybe their dim sum is better. OK service. Won't go again."}
{"text":"Legit one of the best Chinese places in West Las Vegas, i spent alot of time and China and this place has a great selection  of dim sum items on the menu. My favorite  is the BBQ Steamed Pork Buns."}
{"text":"Awesome place in LV!!! This little gem is full of great options. Loved their Kung Pao Chicken, cashew chicken, soups, and snow peas. Each dish was bursting with delicious flavor, and was prepared with care and quality that really stood out. Will definitely be back again soon!"}
{"text":"Went in to eat this week and found out they have a new owner and chef. The food is definitely not as fresh and carefully made as before. Spring rolls were mushy inside. Flavors not as fresh and bright. Many of our favorites are gone from the dim sum and regular menu. The food is not bad, but certainly not at the level it was before."}
{"text":"Very friendly.. Clean environment. Lots of options and everything tasted amazing!!! Great choice."}
{"text":"It has been many years since we first tried - much much better- going to visit again - Tim sum that is close by is a plus"}
{"text":"This was the best dim sum I've ever had in my life and I've made my way up, down and all around Chinatown. It was fairly untraditional as they don't push carts around. You have to wait a bit longer than normal for dim sum but the positive side to that was that everything was piping hot with incredible flavor!   Must haves:  Baked BBQ Pork Buns - best ever with a slight honey glaze.   Shrimp stuffed eggplant  Pork Shumai   Calamari - warning, this was on the salty side but deelish."}
{"text":"We have eaten here many times and have NEVER been disappointed!  We actually crave the food!  Yum!"}
{"text":"Dined in for dim sum. Ordered the shrimp har gow, pork shumai, steamed chicken buns & sweet rice cake. The only thing i liked was the shrimp har gow. The pork shumai was very rubbery. The sweet rice cake was cold, dry, & thin. The steamed chicken buns were nasty!"}
{"text":"Woke up craving soup dumplings, nothing unusual about that. What is unusual is how hard it is to find in Vegas near me. Of course I turned to Yelp and picked the closest 4 star to me, once again you all did not disappoint.   Stand outs: Soup dumplings, must try, they are smallish enough to pop in your mouth whole. Most places I have been to serve them much larger and accompanied by a soup spoon. I didn't mind being able to take them whole. Very good.  Curry cream cheese wontons, very very subtle curry taste which I appreciated because I wanted plain ones. Delicate, crispy, perfectly fried. Very good.  Chow mein, it was a nice accompaniment, solid choice.    Just oks The eggs rolls were ok, slightly undercooked for my personal taste. I'd get them again but ask for a bit well done.  Pork ribs my hubs loved, me not so much. If you like cartilage you will like them as there are bits of soft bone and gristle to work through. Similar in texture to chicken's feet. If that's your thing, rock in and order these. (They also have chicken feet FYI) The flavor of the meat was wonderful just not my preference.   Hard no Rice paper pork, no go for me. I don't like a slimy texture and even though it's normal for this dish I personally wouldn't order it again.   I'll be back to try their regular menu items as this review is strictly dim sum menu items. Thanks again friends!"}
{"text":"Pretty average tasting dim sum.  However, the fact that you can order dim sum all day is great! I like the concept. I also like that the food is made to order and doesn't come by on carts; so its nice and hot.  My favorite was the soup dumplings; it was super flavorful and fresh tasting.  My least favorite was the pan fried beef bun; tastes like a bland hamburger patty with slightly soggy dough on the outside.    The service was quick but quite unfriendly.  Posted outside the door is no outside food or drinks (which includes food/drinks for small children).   They also are stingy and only give one napkin per customer..luckily I brought my own.  They also never refilled drinks despite being empty.     Will I be back? only if I am really craving dim sum and every where else is closed."}
{"text":"For a long time, I've been looking for an authentic Chinese food place... I've had enough of the Americanized version of Chinese food here in Phoenix - and I think I've finally found it.  In fact, I have further proof that this is worth while in that we have a family friend who hail from mainland china and she was visiting us and we took her here and she validates that this is legit... ! They spoke Mandarin fluently and my guest was tickled pink that she could show us this experience...!  Food - We definitely wanted to do Dim Sum so we ordered their version of Xiaolongbao, which is the soup filled dumpling... and I have to say that it's a pretty good version and I fully realize how difficult it is to make that dumpling. We also ordered the Shrimp Dumplings that ended up being the hit of the night... very tasty and even got high marks from the non-Asians in the group. Finally we also ordered the Shanghai Style Braised Pork Belly, or Hong Shao Rou, and while it wasn't as sweet as my Chinese friend wanted - I like it a little more savory so it was a pretty damn good representation.  Ambiance - It was fine... what you'd expect out of a Chinese food place in a strip mall - perfectly acceptable... the only thing that was missing was old grandma pushing the Dim Sum Cart around asking you what you wanted.  Service - Was exceptional... however! There is a caveat to the story... again as soon as it was apparent that we had a Chinese national with us they made sure to take care of us.   If you're looking for authentic Chinese food... and are tired of the old Beef with Broccoli and General Tso's Chicken... give this place a shot. I'll warn ya.. while you can definitely get the Americanized stuff here - General Tso's is definitely on the menu... if you're willing to scratch the surface and dig a little deeper, there is some genuinely great authentic stuff here... stuff that's unusual for western taste buds."}
{"text":"So we my friend and I walked in wanting to try a new experience. Well did! We walked into the right place. I have been to two dim sum restaurants. Both not in Vegas and near china towns.  So I tell my friend after seeing the add on Facebook then yelping it I tell her we need to check this place out it has tons of potential for a authentic dim sum restaurant. Wow was that a great choice. No they are no carts but the made to order appeals to me more because the food is fresh and fast. The food tho! Amazing honestly we both looked at each other and had these faces of WOW! So I recommend this place if you are looking for delicious and authentic dim sum. Added Plus on parking and fast service."}
{"text":"Wonderful food, definitely authentic. My favorites were the red bean sesame balls (super fluffy and chewy), the fried taro, the shrimp dumplings, and the congee. The egg tarts were delicious, I just wish they were a little bigger. The server was a little aggressive however, and pushed us to get two of a lot of the items we ordered. We definitely over ordered and had a ton of leftovers... And our bill was heftier than it should've been. Otherwise, an awesome brunch."}
{"text":"I loved it. First off it was the cleanest dim sum place I've ever been to. The staff was kind and had perfect timing. It's new, so it wasn't crowded.  They were also great with kids.  A plus when you want to enjoy a meal out as a family."}
{"text":"We love authentic hole in the wall food places and this one did NOT let us down.  we highly recommend:  Steamed BBQ pork buns  Shanghai Soup Dumplings  Chicken Lo Mein   YOU WILL NOT be disappointed."}
{"text":"lets start with their dim sum.  fantastic.  better quality than orchid garden for sure.  no cart.  order on demand.  highly recommend for dumplings chicken feet pork ribs pork buns and etc  service could be a bit faster.  typically 3 working and when it gets busy a bit hard to get a hold of  ive gone back 3 times now and will continue to go here vs orchid.  less hectic and better quality food  highly recommend if you love dim sum"}
{"text":"This restaurant is one example of why I can't trust Yelp very much anymore.  If I were to rate this cafe, I'd give it 4.5. And like most users, that .5 stars is merely because they market themselves as dim sum, but does not have the carts to give you the \"full dim sum experience.\" But you know what? Who cares if they don't have a bunch of old, middle-aged, rude Chinese women pushing your food around?  Here's the deal Yelpers, it blows my mind that most of the reviews take out so many stars or give this place a bad review because of the lack of carts. Let me inform you guys that this place serves the best dim sum food in all of Vegas (bold statement, but true.) The reason why this restaurant does not cart their food around for you is because they know they aren't located in Chinatown with millions of customers everyday, but they want to preserve the quality of their food, which is why they cook their food fresh for you. I can guarantee you that even the other great dim sum places in Vegas (Cathay House, Chang's) will sometimes microwave your food, or heat up leftovers for you to eat.   Oh and \"how's the service?\" You might be asking. It is incredible. It may be because I came for a late lunch, but we had the most excellent service ever at any dim sum. Waited a reasonable amount of time to be seated, then had kind service through my whole meal. There are simple key things that waiters and waitresses should do (say \"May I...Please... Thank You...\") I mean very basic things that most restaurants don't accomplish, but it takes you a long way. The waitress was even kind enough to hold the door open on my way out. I won't say to expect these kinds of things at peak hours, but they definitely do put a lot of care into their customers.  TL;DR don't come here if you are looking for cart pushers, come if you want some quality food."}
{"text":"Great place to have good dim sum! Located in summerlin area,  no need to go all the way to Chinatown.. Fresh made to order.. Very flavorful and delicious.. Clean and good customer service also!  My new go to spot for Chinese and dim sum!"}
{"text":"I'm writing this as my husband is driving away from the restaurant and I can't wait to go back. I've eaten dim sum all over and this is probably one of the two best dim sum places I've visited. It's made to order so it comes out absolutely fresh, and the quality and generosity of the ingredients makes it so very very good. The owner will come to your table and explain anything you have questions about. The servers are very friendly. I live 40 miles away and I can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"????????  Food is delicious as always.  It's Shanghai style in preparing and presenting the best of best Chinese cuisine."}
{"text":"Being from the SGV in LA, I'm a dim sum fanatic. I'm also fairly picky when it comes to dim sum, although I will admit that context matters. In other words, Gee's Garden in Tucson is about as good as it gets for that desert city, and they deserve a rating that is consistent with its location. As such, I do expect more from Phoenix, which is a much bigger city and has a much larger Asian population.  With that in mind, I haven't had great dim sum in Phoenix, and so I wasn't really expecting much from Dim Sum Cafe. However, I was very pleasantly surprised with the quality of the dumplings here. You don't have a lot of options- no egg custard tart!- but most of the standards are here: siumai, hargow, BBQ pork bun, scallion pancake, and xiaolongbao (soup dumplings). In addition, they have youtiao and other items not commonly found in dim sum restaurants, which makes me think that the owners are probably not Cantonese. Regardless, what I had tasted was higher quality and fresher tasting than your typical dim sum fare, without the crazy amounts of grease that seems to typify dim sum restaurants in Arizona. The siumai, in particular, was really juicy without being laden with MSG or fat, and I actually really liked their XLB, although they are certainly nowhere near the quality of Din Tai Fung or other soup dumpling places you'll find in the SGV. The hargow was the only dumpling I felt seemed off- instead of a firm translucent wrapper, it was pretty soft and mushy, which makes me think the dough was not prepared correctly.   Overall, great experience. The staff was very friendly, and the manager(?) came out near the end of the meal to check on things. While some previous reviewers suggested that the cost was too high, I thought it was reasonable. My partner and I shared an order of siumai, hargow, youtiao (a savory doughnut of sorts), scallion pancake, shrimp egg rolls, and two orders of XLB, as well as an order of the chongqing chicken and ended up paying around $50-60 after taxes and tip, which I thought was reasonable given the amount of food we ordered. Regardless, I'm never sure why people seem to think that Chinese food, especially if it's fresh and higher quality than your usual take-out joint, isn't worth higher prices. This isn't Panda Express, and the food was actually really good. My only complaint is the limited variety of dim sum- how can you have a dim sum restaurant without egg custard tart, shrimp cheongfun, or pineapple buns? Hopefully they will add more items as time goes on, but I know where I will get my dim sum fix next time I'm in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"Since leaving California we haven't found anything close to Din Tai Fung.  Dim Sum Cafe has great soup dumplings!  We ordered the scallion pancake and vegetable pork potstickers that were good as well.  Definitely coming back as I'd like to try the noodle dishes next:)"}
{"text":"After sampling a bunch of different plates, I'm honestly surprised that their ratings weren't better. DSC will probably be my new go to for Chinese food, EVERYTHING I ordered was delish. Even as take out it was still better than most places in Vegas. The curry cream cheese rangoons were a welcome break from the normal rangoons that have so much grease you could lube your car with them. They were crispy, light and tasty. The dim sum approach of less is more definitely works here. I took one bite of the baked sweet cream buns and saved the rest for dessert. They were incredible, light, flaky with custard that wasn't too sweet or overdone inside. Just a taste was enough. I love udon noodles and cook at home with them often, so I'm partial to this place as they don't just offer them in soup. The combo udon lo mein with shrimp, beef and chicken was perfect, not too salty or sauced with the noodles still firm and plenty of shrimp. Most chinese places try to save $$ by calling something a combo or shrimp dish and then giving you only 1 or 2 shrimp and loading it with cheaper beef or chicken. Not DSC.  The lemon chicken was light with a bit of zest, not too sweet or drowning in sauce like many places offer. My only gripe was that I would have liked a little more sauce in it, but ordering a side of extra sauce is an easy fix. The cashew chicken was loaded with vegetables and hot, filled with tons of chicken. While a pretty standard offering, it was done well. Bonus was that all the chicken in all the dishes was clearly white meat, firm and cooked perfectly. Almost every chinese place I've been to in this town uses dark or thigh meat that's chewy and gristly to save $$$, and it grosses me out.  I'm extremely impressed and looking forward to eating there to get the full-on dim sum experience. All of the staff were very friendly, more than I would have expected for a take out meal. Nothing but good things to say about them. They have very large menu that should accommodate just about any taste or flavor you can think of. Kudos."}
{"text":"Got there shortly after opening, fast service, great food just watch out for the upsales anyway only thing is that they speak without filter and kinda through me for weird feeling. Overall great."}
{"text":"Nice to have a dim sum place on the west side of town. However thats the only good thing. Food was bland and not impressive. Just take a few extra minutes and head towards the center of town for actual dim sum made right."}
{"text":"Came in looking to fill my dim sum craving and this place hit the spot! Brought my family, We enjoyed every dish we tried. This is definitely a place we will visit again."}
{"text":"Great service and I love being able to order from a menu rather than waiting for carts to come around.  Consistent quality."}
{"text":"Great place. Went there to check out Soup Dumplings aka Juicy Buns. Fabulous!!!  They are smaller than a full range dim sum place, don't offer carts, but focus on about 10 dim sum style items. All of them are pretty good. But the soup dumplings, the shumai, the shrimp dumplings, and the pot stickers stand out. Next time I'll order one of their noodle specialties - they look super.   Great service and clean restrooms."}
{"text":"This place is great! We have come here a few times and each time, the owner greets us and thanks us for coming in. I have never left this place feeling disappointed. I highly recommend this place. We always get the soup dumplings and something new that the owner recommends and it exceeds our expectations. They're all so nice too."}
{"text":"Dim Sum is delicious.  We have eaten here twice, and both times the food has been excellent.  The service is also fantastic.  Both times we ordered BBQ pork buns - the best I have ever had.  We also had soup dumplings - also the best ever.  For our main course, we ate Xia Mein; it's a rice noodle dish with chicken, shrimp, bbq pork, egg, carrots, onion, bean sprouts, and pickled peppers.  Soooooooo good!!!  We strongly recommend trying this restaurant."}
{"text":"Sundays are for Dim Sum and when in Summerlin, I say give this place a try.  Went in for Sunday Dim Sum this past weekend and left feeling more than satisfied by my meal.  A party of 3 ordered: Beef fried rice $9.25, Snow pea leaves with garlic sauce $11.95, Chinese sausage bun (2) $3.50, Pork Shu Mai(3) $2.5, Chicken Shu Mai (3) $2.5,Steamed BBQ Pork Bun (3) $2.5, Coconut Roll (2) $2.5, Baked sweet cream bun (3) $2.5, 2 Steamed Pork spare ribs $3, Steamed Pork Dumpling (3) $3, Pork porridge with preserved egg $4  Taste: Hot, delicious, and fresh. Server recommended the snow pea leaves and they did not disappoint; I believe we will be ordering that from no won as our \"green\" for the table. Baked sweet cream bun were so good. Honestly, I could finish an entire order of 3 buns on my own.  Portions: Most dishes were portioned out for 3 pieces...perfect for a party of 3. Beef fried rice and Snow pea leaves were served family style & we were able to box up plenty to go.  Service: This was my first time ordering dim sum vs. stalking the rolling carts for specific foods. Our family size plates arrived first and were soon followed by all of our ordered dim sum in quick succession. It was nice having all of the food out on the table to choose from (as opposed to usual experiences where you are waiting on your proteins to pair up with your sides).  Menu: Well organized with prices listed. Also had a photo menu which made ordering easy, especially if you don't know what the dish is called or if you are feeling adventurous. Listing the dishes is also more food-allergy friendly. There was no question as to what each dish included (so I was able to keep my epi-pen stored).  Overall: I'll be back because Sundays are for Dim Sum & Dim Sum Cafe meets my needs."}
{"text":"We tried this place for the first time tonight.  The service was great!  Food was even better!"}
{"text":"This was my first dim sum experience, so I can't base my review off of the flavors from a traditional perspective, but good grief the food is delicious.    You seat yourself at clean, modern booths where a waitress promptly takes you're order. I had iced tea, which was fresh. We ordered appetizers and dumplings that were there with 10 minutes. You get plenty of dipping sauces without having to ask for them (always a perk).   The dumplings were the perfect temperature so we could dig in right away. They also get 5 stars for the service as our drinks were never empty, and servers seemed genuinely happy to be there."}
{"text":"I been wanting to try this place ..But wasn't too sure but I tried it today or tonight and it was very good I had the Mongolian beef and the Pan fried dumplings .I would definitely go back there again ."}
{"text":"Do I like Orchid's Garden?  Yes!  Do I like Orchid's Garden fresh with super fast service?  Yes!  Do you like these things as well?    Then you'll love this location.  I've actually taken a long hiatus from Dim Sum. I used to go to PingPangPong every week but they've just been inconsistent lately.   I ordered all of my favorites. Shark Fin Dumpling, Daikon Cake, Fried Taro, Stuffed Eggplant, Chicken Feet, Har Gow, and Siu Mai.  All of it was seriously legit. Why no pictures you ask? Me and my buddy were so shocked by how great everything tasted we didn't even think to take pictures. Stop by if you frequent Orchid's Garden and live in the area. If you're some sort of Dim Sum snob then go else where!"}
{"text":"Dimsum all day! Don't expect that they will have a dimsum cart rolling around but the good thing is that you can order it anytime of the day. Dimsum is ok but not as good as the other places that I've tried. Service is good and very friendly.  The interiors is a little bit off for me, having the blue color motif is something I've never seen in any Chinese restaurant here or in other countries.  To get a dimsum fixed anytime of the day, this is the place to be."}
{"text":"Amazing relax place! Dim Sum are awesome, always fresh when i come here but this time just the eggplant was a little on the rough side, other  than that this is a decently nice place to go solo or with whoevers."}
{"text":"My wife and I drove 45 minutes to eat at this restaurant.  It was worth the drive.  We chose items from the Dim Sum menu, and we loved everything we ordered.  I loved the shrimp dumplings.  The shrimp were slightly fried and wrapped in a delicious dumpling.  I added some Chinese vinegar for dipping.  Wow!  Delicious!  My wife ordered Shanghai soup dumplings and bbq pork buns.  She enjoyed both, but raved about the soup dumplings.  I ordered delicious crispy green beans and sliced onions in a savory sauce.  These are the best I have tasted in any Asian restaurant.    The owner, Sheila, came by our table several times to make sure our visit was special.  It was, and she is delightful.     We are planning on returning soon, and we will be hosting parties with their food central to the events.  This restaurant is that good."}
{"text":"This new gem is a must go. Everything was fresh, well spiced, and absolutely delicious! Hot and Sour soup was tangy with a wonderful bit of heat on the finish.  Owner and staff were very attentive and eager to make sure we got what we wanted. The only reason I didn't give this place a 5 was due to timing of plates delivered; however, I know they will get that down and this place will be a solid 5 star. Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"This place has some of the better dim sum in Las vegas, like any dim sum some of the menu items are a better deal than others. I would highly recommend the baked custard bun as a desert. The reason this place doesn't deserve 5/5 is the service was terrible. Our waitress sat us, served us water, and forgot about us for at least 15 minutes. It honestly wasn't her fault either, they're just so obviously understaffed"}
{"text":"I actually stopped by here for an interview! The portions are generous, and the food is delicious and authentic. The staff is really attentive, too -- almost as soon as I sat down they came to take my drink order. I hope this business stays around!"}
{"text":"I swung by to try it out.  Staff was awesome, atmosphere was good.  I really enjoyed the quality and variety of food.  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Ok so for being a dim sum lover I have to say this place kindda gives the main places a run for their money.   So it's not the biggest and busiest dim sum place but it was clean the people were nice and the food was GREAT!   To me when you go eat dim sum you want to experience the whole cart table service and crazy mad house atmosphere if it was your first time having dim sum ok, but if you just want some food and go about your day then this will satisfy your fix.   It's all about the food anyways and they have very good dim sum. The service was pretty fast and you order exactly what you want and it comes out all at the same time instead of waiting for a cart to come by so you can fight for what's left.   But here at Dim Sum Cafe you can choose from an awesome menu they have everything and then some just as good as a menu as the busy dim sum places if not better and the prices and portions are perfect.   All I have to say is that for an off the stripe local neighbor's location it was just the right place for me. You should totally try it because you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"You know, I'm going to give this place a solid 4 stars.  I been here a few times now and it definitely has gotten better since I first came here almost 2 years ago.     This past two months I've been back about 3 times and it's one of the few restaurants I've been able to take all 3 of my young kids by myself so I really enjoy this place. There are no carts so Instead, you order what you want and it's more fresh!  The time they take to make the food is pretty quick too.  There is a little wait depending on what you order but the food is good. My kids don't eat dimsum too often but they do like this place.   My favorites:   Shao Long bao Shu Mai Cream Buns Egg Targets Barbecue Pork Noodles Daikon cakes And the congee porridge!  Love  See photos!   Also I love that this is in Summerlin and I don't have to drive all the way to Chinatown to eat Dim Sum!"}
{"text":"It is very hard to find dim sum on the north side of Phoenix so we drove a little over half an hour to Dim Sum Cafe in Mesa. The South East valley has more variety when it comes to Asian. Their dim sum was very good. The soup dumplings are not as big as I am used to but they are good I am comparing them to ones I've tried in NYC so I didn't think they were mind blowing but their variety and their food overall was very good. We tried over 6 different platters and they were all very tasty, and the service was great!"}
{"text":"I've been waiting for more than a month for steamed/bbq pork buns while on the road, and I left very satisfied. Everything tastes great and well worth the trip over. It was pricier than most places I've gone to in Seattle, but since everything was made well, I had no problem spending the extra few dollars. If this wasn't just a pit stop, I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"I am a dim sum fanatic. Go to dim sum in every city i travel. This is just wonderful dim sum:  Fresh, made to order Great prices Great no hassle location and parking Great personalized service Nicer decor than usual corny dim sum Several nice aquariums a nice touch ( no you cant order sea food from these aquariums :) Pretty large selection, even chicken shu mai (usually just pork) Serving dim sum late, till 9pm."}
{"text":"A nice treat to eat dim sum! I drove here from the West Valley to dine and it was worth it! The service was good and staff are quick to response. It wasn't crowded around 4:30pm. The dishes delivered to the table was quick. The dumplings and dim sum portions are generous size. I like the simple dim sum menu. This restaurant it a must try for the dim sum and authentic Chinese food."}
{"text":"Great food. Good price. Always clean and service is good. Dim sum not served on carts. Makes for less than a  \"dim sum\" experience but food is fresh."}
{"text":"Went here in a cold rainy day and loved the shumai and soup dumplings! Dishes are reasonably priced and the restaurant is very clean."}
{"text":"Excellent dim sum. Food was very tasty. & Customer service was also superb! Wait was not too awfully long. Will be stopping back again!"}
{"text":"I have been looking for a place that serves good XLB here for a while besides another restaurant in the valley. This definitely takes the lead spot replacing it! This is a MADE TO ORDER restaurant so have some patience and it will be paid off once you take a bite! I went around 7ish with my family and we were the only ones. Ordered hella siu mai, shrimp dumplings, XLB, bbq pork bun and beef pancake. All were absolutely wonderful. This place is a straight banger. It beats waiting around for a cart to come  by. It is a little more expensive significantly which is fine by me. The owners are very kind and informative!   *insert Drake lyrics here*  CERTIFIED BANGER"}
{"text":"Service is good. The booth is comfy.  The Egg Tarts are good. However, the non-pastry dim sum leaves much to be desired.  The Shrimp Ha Gow is \"doey\", the Lotus wrapped Rice just did not have much in the way of content.  The Beef Rice Steamed Noodles were also very doey, and not hot enough.    Overall, it can't hold a candle to Southern California Dim Sum or Ping Pang Pong in Las Vegas, but the service was good."}
{"text":"A friend of mine suggested this place and man was he wrong. It's only right to compare this dim sum to orchids garden and that's what I did. It's not even comparable to orchids. The baked BBQ pork buns didn't even have honey on top and that's what makes it so good. The meat inside was cool, not warm at all. The shrimp shumai tasted store bought. No taste. The shrimp har gow was decent. The shrimp with bell pepper tasted fresh. But even the chili sauce at the table had little chili and just drenched in oil. Just a horrible experience to be honest. You don't even have the rolling carts with the dim sum in it. Thank goodness the bill was about $20. I was still hesitant to pay that much for it. What a disappointment. Too bad cause it's so close as location and more convenient. But the flavor is not worth the miles."}
{"text":"Although we did take-out this time, service was still good. There's plenty of parking and it's very accessible, food was tasty, tried the egg drop soup and the hot and sour soup , a couple of appetizers  shrimp har -gow, chicken lo main chicken shop suey walnut glazed shrimp .. the only thing I wasn't thrilled about was the BBQ pork rice noodles (but it was still ok)  Definitely will be back if craving Chinese food"}
{"text":"This place had so many bad reviews when it had first opened. I was kind of scared to try it.  So we came in in a Saturday afternoon and the place was empty. Maybe because people eat dim sum at brunch/lunch. Duh.  We  ordered the beef tendon, har gow,  sugar cane shrimp, chicken feet...You know. The usual. And it was good! All of the food was fresh and steaming hot. It was not as good as Chinatown places, but it was pretty close. The service was ok and the prices are reasonable. We are coming back for sure."}
{"text":"Worst Chasu Bau I've had (baked pork bun), the bun was dry and the meat to bun ratio way off.  Shrimp har gaw and pork shu mai tasted like they were reheated from earlier.  Lotus leaf and snow pea flowers were decent"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the food and friendly service.  I am a huge Dim Sum fan, and would travel miles to get a decent meal.  Not the hugest menu, but lots of standard favorites.  Had a first time Dim Sum taster with us and she really enjoyed it as well.  Yummy!"}
{"text":"I've been looking for good Chinese Food so I figured I'd try Dim Sum Cafe. Extra bonus I live across the street!  I ordered the shrimp fried rice and vegetable egg rolls. The rice is delicious. The egg rolls are spring rolls so I need to check to see if the have Cantonese Style Egg Rolls. But all in all I will return."}
{"text":"If you're craving dim sum but don't want to wait to eat it around the certain hours dim sum is served, then I would recommend Dim Sum cafe. (served all day) We drove from the strip to this location and would say it's worth it for the price, much cheaper than anything we could get on the strip (ex: chicken feet is $3 rather than $4.50) and the taste is good. I love beef chow fun (dry) and beef and broccoli and use those two items to determine whether if this is a good restaurant. Those two items were superb. One of my favorites and I eat a lot of Chinese food. The dim sum was average, nothing spectacular but it curved the craving I had for it. The staff was kind and handled the misunderstanding we had with a menu item. You can get a good amount of food for the price you pay, so I'd say to stop on by and try it for yourself!"}
{"text":"Great little dim sum place. The food was delicious, and the manager/owner was very sweet and helpful. She explained how the menu worked and helped us pick out dishes to try. If you're in the area, check this place out!"}
{"text":"Food: 5/5 - The pork shumai and chive pan fried dumpling were both tasty! Highly recommended!   Service: 1/5 - We came in right when they opened and it started out strong. Then we ended up waiting for 15-20 minutes for our last dish after already finishing all our other dishes. We had to ask about the last dish a few times and even tried to cancel the order but was told \"it'll be right out\". It then took another 10 minutes to get the check. Overall, it seemed like they forgot about us.   Location: 4/5 - Parking wasn't an issue, though we did get there early. Restaurant was pretty clean.   Price: 4/5 - Total of $18 for 5 dishes. Pretty reasonably.   Overall: The food was great but ultimately the service ruined the experience for us."}
{"text":"Pros: Not crowded, wide variety, clean, near the freeway, everything is made to order (no carts)  Cons: Food is not fresh tasting (seafood tasted previously frozen/Pre-packaged, slow service, somewhat expensive for quality of food, opens late, service is ok.  We will likely not return, but it is not a bad place."}
{"text":"Since this was in the east valley, I assumed this was one of the many other restaurants out there that serve \"authentic\" chinese food.  Alas, this was primarily just another american-chinese joint.  There are so many better spots for legit asian food in the area, this doesn't warrant a stop.   The XLB soup dumplings were not soupy inside and were leathery outside.  The egg roll that comes with the lunch combo is extremely run of the mill - utterly flavorless and mushy inside.  The Kung Pao beef had a large amount of fresh veggies, which was great, except the sauce was exceedingly sweet.  Clean, good service, nice to have dim sum options for lunch.  But nothing here will give me reason to come back."}
{"text":"Some friends took my wife and I there for lunch. If I had read Jack R's review before we went I would have balked. Sunday brunch time - not many people there - bad sign!! And so it was. We started off with the lunch menu egg dlop soup. Total crap. I put some soy sauce in it to perhaps add some flavor to no avail. No one at the table ate all of theirs. I had Orange Chicken -oh joy! There was so much breading on it that it resembled a walnut, and as hard also. The orange sauce was mediocre also. My wife had sweet and sour chicken. It came with an egg roll(eh!) and egg fried rice. Since the fried rice was tasteless she asked the server if she could exchange it for steamed rice. The server's reply,\"Why you no tell me before\"? (well, basically because she didn't know that your fried rice sucked). No comments from my friends on their meals. On the positive side, the prices were inexpensive and the place was absolutely spotless. But, lousy food and an unfriendly server earned it a well deserved 1 star."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch. Ordered off of the dim sum menu. All of the dumplings were tasty and clearly homemade. The soup dumplings were a highlight. Service was prompt, friendly, and attentive... which I don't always expect in more authentic Chinese restaurants. I would definitely return and hope to try some of the main dishes in the future."}
{"text":"This was the worst meal I've ever had in Vegas The menu was totally weird: A small selection of Dim Sum, a full breakfast menu, and deli food? We ordered some of the Dim Sum, all of it was terrible. DO NOT EAT HERE"}
{"text":"All I can say is yum yum yum the sesame chicken was delicious !!!!! we ordered from the lunch specials which was a really cool thing because we got our choices to pick between different  flavors and plates  we wanted to eat   but  this food was delicious I really enjoy the atmosphere really laid back  the staff and the waiters were awsome  they treated us a very well"}
{"text":"For Dim Sum outside of Chinatown this place is A-Ok. They need a beer and wine license if they want to increase their dinner traffic. All the dim sum was good."}
{"text":"The Dim Sum menu was almost identical to other Dim Sum restaurants in the Vegas area with minor differences. I found the Dim Sum not greasy and delicious! The Thai Iced tea was great too. I especially enjoyed the shrimp dim sum."}
{"text":"This place is a little hidden gem. The staff are friendly and very on point. Once you been here a few times they recognize you and treat you like family. Food is great and reasonable price as well. Like I said, its a hidden gem so it doesn't get too busy, so stop by and give them a try."}
{"text":"I stopped by to grab some take out. After reading the menu I decided on a few dim sum items. I liked that they had pictures, sometimes it can be hard to decipher what each item is just based on the name. The service was great. I was greeted and given ample time to look at the menu. I was also offered water while I waited. I ordered the beef tripe, shrimp fun rolls, pork porridge, turnip cake, calamari, and the steamed chicken buns. My favorites were the fun rolls, tripe, calamari, and steamed buns. The turnip cake was slightly different than what I was used to, I believe they used a radish. It was good, but broke apart easily and made it difficult for me to dip it in chili sauce. The calamari was flavorful, I could taste the 5 spice and really liked how they deep fried it. It wasn't as greasy as it can be, I hardly sauce any excess oil soaking through the shredded lettuce. The pork porridge was just ok to me. I felt like I needed a lot more than soy sauce and chili oil to flavor it. Overall not a bad experience, but definitely not the best dim sum I've ever had."}
{"text":"Pork Shumai. Shrimp Shumai. Shrimp Chow Fun. Baked Pork Buns. Egg Tarts.   Not the same as Hawaii but it was still good.   I ordered to go from Door Dash to be delivered to my work. No condiments. No utensils. No napkins."}
{"text":"This is a great \"Intro to Dim Sum\" restaurant. Plenty of parking outside, and there is actually a menu for the uninitiated.  Personally for me this restaurant is great for a quick in and out weekend dim sum run.  The prices are a bit higher compared to some of the other places nearby, but I don't mind paying for no-wait and the slightly higher quality of food.  Their Taiwanese donuts and scallion pancakes are pretty authentic.  Too bad they stopped serving chilled sweet soy milk the last time I was here."}
{"text":"Ordered Shrimp Har Gow, BBQ Pork Buns, and Sesame Chicken for delivery.  Delivery is fast and the food is still hot and not mushy, which is obviously a plus.  The Shrimp Har Gow is steamed and really shrimpy, if that makes sense?  It's not gross if you like the taste of shrimp like me!  The Sesame Chicken was recommended by the person taking our order over the phone and it is a good amount of crispy and saucy- the sauce has good flavor, too.  Unfortunately, the BBQ buns have a lot of breading (like 3/4 of an inch thick) and not a lot of filling.  That's too bad because the filling is the best part!    I'll definitely order from Dim Sum Cafe again, especially because they are so fast!  The delivery guy also said, \"Enjoy your food\" which was friendly, too.  When you're giving your order over the phone, they're very friendly and helpful (I wasn't sure what to ask for when trying to order shrimp dumplings).  Thanks for great service!"}
{"text":"We had dinner here on a Friday afternoon. No customers except for us. It was really hot in there. It seemed like the a/c was off but the fans helped a little.   No bbq buns on that particular day which was disappointing. The rest of the dimsum items we ordered were ok. We also ordered beef chow fun and fried rice; both very good.  It took a long long time to get our food. Service was slow but friendly. Might try again."}
{"text":"My wife and I were there last night and we pleasantly surprised the moment we walked in and were greeted by the owner immediately.  Was not very busy but we were there before dinner time.  The wife had never been to Dim Sum place before so I decided to try a sampling.  Her absolute favorite was the BBQ pork dumplings.  Great flavor but so, so light.  Next came the Scallion pancakes.  Perfect with the chili oil which we had quite a bit of.  We also had the pan fried beef buns and a round of Steamed Dumplings but ended with what was my favorite, the Shumai.  Loved every bite.  Cannot wait to go back and try the soup dumplings.  Only negative was no beer/wine license but the hot tea was very good.  Felt the price was in line with other places but the service was better than most places."}
{"text":"It isn't authentic dim sum. There is no cart, plus the actual dim sum is not good. It lacks flavor and whats worse is that we found plastic bristles in our food. When we confronted the waiter, he said there was nothing he could do about it. He said it's not unusual for the cleaning bristles to get in the food. Um what? We found plastic in not only one dish but two. Disappointed in the customer service and the food itself wasn't good. And this is coming from someone who is Chinese, has experience in the food industry, and has eaten dim sum for my entire life. If you're looking for authentic, Chinese dim sum, this is not the place."}
{"text":"Definitely not your traditional Chinese restaurant.  This place is awesome.  The food is out of this world... We ordered 5 dishes.   Loved them all.  Chloe, our waitress, was super fast and right on top of things.  She is a master of anticipating our needs and bringing things to our table even before we realized we needed them.   Sheila, the owner, came to our table a few times.  Very friendly and appreciative that we came to visit her restaurant.  We give Dim Sum Cafe  5 stars and 2 thumbs up."}
{"text":"OK! Soooooooooo I've never had a 5star experience at DimSum EVER!!!!! Until I found this little hidden gem. The server was UBER friendly and made some amazing suggestions! I highly recommend their seasonal snap pea leaves with garlic sauce! She recommended it and it was fantastic! We had the pork shumai, shrimp ball(with sugarcane), sweet rice cake, the dim sum noodles, Chinese broccoli, the snap pea leaves with garlic, beef broccoli, steamed shrimp dumplings and the mushroom/spinach steamed dumplings!!!! Yes, we over ordered but it was good leftovers!  Nice clean place with cute wall aquariums and clean bathrooms!!!!! Highly recommended and will return!!!"}
{"text":"Cute little Chinese place staffed by cute and polite Chinese ladies.  Menu is some traditional Chinese dumplings, a few other dim sum items, and some westernized dishes.  Ordered their proclaimed specialty \"Shanghai soup dumplings\" they were solid but nowhere near the better xiao long baos I've had (sadly all outside of AZ).  Other dumplings were okay as well.  The beef chow fun was one of the better ones I've had.  It was glistening in an even coat of oil, full of flavor, and what the Chinese would call enough \"wok hei\" (meaning sufficient wok heat/power).  The Singapore noodles were my least favorite.  It lacked sufficient curry - you can barely taste it and the color of the dish was white and not the expected turmeric tint.  It was just too soggy.  Unfortunately the only taste to this dish was salt - too much of it."}
{"text":"Great food, crappy service.  I really love the dim sum, the fact that it's closer than china town and the that they always have EPL, but it's just the service in this place is terrible.  I'm gonna start picking my servers like gladiators from now on. There's an older south East Asian lady that won't stop talking and the stuff she comes out with is just plain old awkward. She once stood at the end of the table telling everyone how I looked Chinese. I'm European. I think she meant the way I used chopsticks but like I said, you could hear crickets. There's an older south Asian guy that works on the floor too; he just comes across like he's really unenthused to be there, you have to wave him over constantly and he's the reason I'm writing this review.  The owner and his sons are really friendly and hospitable but between the rest of the people working there it's a real crap shoot. I'd give em 2.5 stars if I could because it's 50/50 if you're gonna have a good experience or not."}
{"text":"We finally decided to try this place, right around the corner from where we live this is the first time we've been there. It was delicious, what can I say? Really good food! It's Wednesday night, I'd say Wednesday is a great night to go: our server was polite, sweet, lovely, wonderful, attentive everything you want in a server. I asked her when she works and she said she only works Wednesday nights! I'll post some pictures, the inside of the place is clean, pleasant. I like the blue colors. kids love the fish tanks, I wouldn't call it a \"wow\", but I would call it a nice clean place for family to eat. By the way, no alcohol service at all. So if you like wine or beer with your Chinese food, my suggestion is order for takeout. Especially liked the deep fried crab balls, and the salt-and-pepper shrimp!"}
{"text":"It was delicious. We tried a few different dishes and enjoyed them all. My favorite were the sweet bbq pork and dim sum potstickers. I will definitely return."}
{"text":"I've lived in Arizona my whole life and after Wang's was bought out many years ago, I've never found authentic Chinese food that's delicious and at a decent price. Not only is Dim Sum Cafe all of these things but the staff is absolutely lovely! You will not be disappointed"}
{"text":"Great staff. Food is top of the line. They just expanded the menu and the staff takes the time to explain steaming times of the food"}
{"text":"Amazing food, very lovely service, and cozy restaurant! Will definitely be back for more. Soup dumplings are a must."}
{"text":"I've been here twice so far, and will make a point to be back when I'm in the area. The dim sum is excellent, served all day, the restaurant is clean, and the staff are exceptionally friendly, what more can you ask for? I waited until I'd been twice as the first experience was shortly after a cook change and the full menu was not available, the second trip not only was this addressed, but they were also trying a couple of new items as well. I've seen the entrees come out, all of them have looked delicious, while I hope to try them some day I expect that I'll stick to the dim sum menu for the time being. This is the only place remotely close to me that has a full dim sum menu and serves it for dinner. I believe they tend to see a decent lunch and carryout crowd as well. My most recent visit included:  Shrimp dumplings, one came without paper in the tin so it was a slight challenge to get out, but these are excellent, possibly my favorite dish on the menu.   Shumai, another excellent dish, came out piping hot, traditional in relation to other dim sum restaurants that I have been to.  Potstickers, a bit on the bland side but still enjoyable.  Shanghai soup dumplings, excellent though a bit more doughy tasting than others I have had.  BBQ Pork Buns, another enjoyable item that is appropriate for those new to dim sum  Gelatin bun, a menu item under test that likely is more dessert focused, I'm unsure if I would reorder these.   Handfolded crab wonton - free with yelp check in. I'm just generally not a fan of crab wontons so my bias shows here. I would not order these, though they were larger than at other locations with a decent filling."}
{"text":"I always drive pass this place when it was being built and it finally opened.. thought I go and try it and because I was craving dim sum .. at 8pm..    Food- Generous size portions!!   I think they had the best Har Gow (shrimp dumpling) I've ever had.. a lot shrimp! And the wrapper didn't stick to the metal steam container! I rarely see that! That's how you know it's good!   I also tried the shu Mai .. it was good! Tasted like any other shu Mai so if you're craving it at night it's perfect! Meaty!   I also had the pan beef fried bun? I believe ? that was pretty good! Pan Fried crispy  goodness with beef inside! would get it again.  Last but not least I tried the soup dumplings.. it's was good .. but not much soup in it.. and they didn't have those big spoons to hold it either.. which was slightly disappointing   Service- It was pretty much me and my little brother in the whole place and I think are waitress was also the owner? She was very attentive and helpful and really nice! She always had are water filled!   But yeah would totally come back for when I get those dim sum cravings because most dim sum places here in AZ ends around 2pm.   Just FYI it's a made to order dim sum so you have to wait a bit for your order."}
{"text":"This is my favorite dim sum place as well as my families. It has all the food we want and is always freshly made. The waitress there can be pushy, but she means well. I went there yesterday for my moms birthday and ordered to go. We got all the food we wanted and the sauces to go with them."}
{"text":"I'll give it a two star because of the server. He was good and very helpful. We ordered, steamed bbq buns,  siu mai, beef tendon, sticky rice, rolled shrimp, rolled noodles in xo sauce which was super oily, fried rice, Mongolia beef and hot and sour soup. Some dishes were not good and some were. So for me the main dishes are ok, dim sum not so much. Probably not coming back here."}
{"text":"It's exciting to have a dim sum restaurant close to my neighborhood.  Now I don't have to drive to Chinatown.     I ordered several traditional dim sum dishes to go and it was very good!!   It was made to order and the food was fresh and tasty with no msg!!  The price is reasonable like other dim sum places; And they also have lunch specials and dinner menus.   I will definitely go back to Dim Sum Cafe."}
{"text":"This is a very clean and friendly place to visit if you are in Summerlin. The prices are reasonable and the food is pretty good. If you haven't had dim sum before it is a great food to eat with friends."}
{"text":"This place wouldn't deliver to my home 5 mins down the road guy was rude beyond belief over the phone and had zero respect"}
{"text":"Ordered from home. The delivery was fast, the food was on the plain side. Very mild flavors. Very affordable, large selection."}
{"text":"Just ate fantastic xiao long bao! Very nice dim sum restaurant Sheila the owner was very sweet and helpful. All of the food is made to order and very fresh we will definitely return the Shanghai dumplings"}
{"text":"I'm not super familiar with dim sum, but if they are all like this, I'm a fan! Started with hot and sour soup, it was probably my favorite part of the meal. Baked pork buns were great, egg rolls were pretty standard, and the chow mein was excellent . I will be back, if anything the hot and sour soup is worth it. They could have had carts, I think it would have been served faster, but the place wasn't that busy so I assume they didn't want to waste food."}
{"text":"20 years in Hong Kong and dim sum was a way of life.  This rivals the best dim sum my husband and I have eaten in Hong Kong and at this one place in San Fran. We were in town for 6 days.  3 visits were warranted.  This is order dim sum so everything is piping hot.  The holy trinity of har gaw, shui mai, and cha siu bao more than passed the test.  The cha siu so (baked  bbq pork pastry), the stuffed eggplant, and the pan seared chive dumpling had to be repeated at each visit.  We managed to crow bar Singapore  Noodles in, too.  Like being home.   Friendly staff (we ordered a type of tea not on the menu and they didn't blink). Clean place.  You can spend hours there sipping tea and ordering as the fancy strikes.  Our son lives in Vegas.  We now have 2 reasons to make the trip."}
{"text":"Fantastic food. Been here a few times and it's always very good and very fresh. The owner comes by and will chat and sometimes offer an appetizer on the house. The dumplings are fantastic, best I've had."}
{"text":"As far as dim sum places go in Las Vegas, this has to be one of my favorite spots. The consistency and the overall quality of the food is what keeps me coming back.  They have the standards on their dim some menu. The shrimp har gow is pretty amazing and so is the salt and pepper shrimp. Others that I've gone with said the pork shumai and the BBQ pork bun were pretty stellar as well.  This last trip we had the har gow. Served in the traditional bamboo steamers, the wrap wasn't overly sticky and held together pretty good. Can't stand when they are overlooked and the wrapper sticks to the bottom. My friend had the mushroom dumpling. These were made to perfection. Funky diced mushroom in the traditional wrapper and seasoned very well. Also had the salt and pepper shrimp. The amount of shrimp you get on the dim sum menu for 6.50 is pretty good considering the portion size and the fact that usually it's about double the price for a dinner portion. Also tried the curry cream cheese wontons. If you're a fan of curry you'll love these!  The wait staff was very courteous and helped with all our decisions. Service is pretty quick and when we went it was lunchtime. They had an ample amount of tables filled but they still were very attentive and very courteous.   This isn't one of those Chinatown places where they have the carts being pushed up and down the isles by someone. I actually prefer the menu style of ordering dim sum. Some people tend to like the traditional carts. Every so often for Sunday brunch I'll go to one of those spots but for day to day dim sum I like the convenience of ordering from a menu.  All in all if you're looking for good sim sum in a clean and good restaurant this is be place. Like I said, not the traditional carts but the food is pretty good and the prices are amazing. This will continue to be one of my go to's for that dim sum craving."}
{"text":"I am so happy that there is a GREAT place for dim sum on this side of town. I love that there are no steam carts because frankly, at other places, if you're not seated where the carts comes out of the back, sometimes the food is cold. Each dim sum order is prepared fresh. Pretty smart ... It arrives at the table hot and tasty. The restaurant is clean and quiet and they have my favorite dim sum choices!"}
{"text":"It was my first time having dim sum. Everything we tried was delicious. We had the orange chicken, sesame chicken, taro dumplings, pork dumplings  , shrimp dumplings, egg drop soup, spring rolls, and pot stickers. We may have had even more food. We were so full when we left. The staff was very friendly and explained how to order as it was our first time there. We will be back."}
{"text":"Was in the mood for dim sum, but didn't feel like driving all the way to Chinatown. Saw that this place was closer to my house in the Southwest, so I decided to give it a try. It was pretty quiet for a Saturday, so I was a little scared. The food wasn't bad and the servers actually spoke English. It was a tad bit more expensive than what I'm used to, but overall it was a good experience."}
{"text":"Great Chinese food (dim sum and regular entree type dishes).  Great prices.   Good service too!   What more can you ask for?!?"}
{"text":"My mom and I were excited to go to a dim sum place near the Summerlin area only to find out it was a huge disappointment. Today my mom ordered a Baked BBQ Pork Pie and when she took it home and tried it, the center of the pork was yellow and black and smelled horrific. The food is obviously not fresh if they have to serve expired pork. Would not come back."}
{"text":"Quick synopsis: Not as bad as people first thought when they opened, but not as good as dim sum restaurants in Chinatown (yet).  I can't even remember what this location was before it was Dim Sum Cafe, but I eagerly waited their opening. With the bad reviews coming out as soon as they opened, I decided to hold off coming here until they could find their groove. I finally paid a visit here last weekend. The restaurant is clean and spacious, but the table tops are a bit bare for a dim sum place. If you want soy sauce or any other of the condiments like hot sauce you normally see at a dim sum restaurant, you have to ask your server to bring you some.   As far as the food, it satisfies the craving for dim sum, without having to drive all the way down to Chinatown from the westside. Their fried rice is a small serving for the price, but has good flavor and is enough for 2 people. My husband enjoyed their fried shrimp balls, which came with a generous serving of mayo. The filling for the stuffed eggplants was tasty, but the skin on the eggplant was tough and inedible. Baked BBQ pork buns weren't too flavorful and lacked filling. Pork suimai  had melt-in-your mouth meat, but the wrapping fell apart when trying to get it out of the container. Unfortunately they were out of the baked cream buns, so I'll at least be back to try those out. Service was very attentive and my water never went unfilled. Menu shows that charge for hot tea, but we actually were not charged for, which I appreciate. I think this place will continue to learn from it's mistakes and get better."}
{"text":"Small place and we went as soon as it opened. The food was fresh and delicious. Every table was filled by the time we left. We will be there again for sure."}
{"text":"Having a quickie lunch with my better half. Didn't care for this dim sum place but we know what was good and not good from our first visit. So we ordered Chinese brocolli,  beef tendons x2, fried taro, and salt and pepper shrimp. That hit the spot and literally ate everything. Again, nice staff, very attentive. Happy eats!"}
{"text":"I first became aware of this restaurant when I saw a flyer showing the Dim Sum menu. Of course, I immediately went to my Yelp app to check the reviews. It's a relatively new restaurant, but the reviews that I read we're encouraging. I especially liked the quick video clip made by the restaurant emphasizing the freshness of their Dim Sum, because they are made to order vs. sitting on a cart.   I came here on a Sunday with four other family members at around 11:30 AM. Parking was easy since they have a parking lot. We were greeted and seated immediately. The restaurant interior appeared modern, very spacious and clean. They even had two big flat screen TV's!   We ordered numerous Dim Sum dishes (including the usual Siu Mai & Har Gow). The dishes came out hot, freshly made and in a timely manner. We all felt that the dishes were delicious. We even had a separate order of Tomato Beef Chow Mein (Hong Kong style-crispy noodles). It was done right & it was flavorful. In talking with our waiter, he told us that they are affiliated with the popular Orchids Garden Restaurant. Even though Dim Sum Cafe is relatively new, I feel that they are worth a try...Check out the photos I posted."}
{"text":"I eat lots of Dim in different states and this is one of the best. When I'm Vegas I always visit here and never have been disappointed."}
{"text":"Clean, fast, great price& I forget the name of them but it's the dough( round bread)  stuffed with barbecued pork etc are the BOMB!"}
{"text":"Great dim sum! Good friendly, service! We are visiting and stayed on the strip. Wanted good affordable dim sum so we were willing to drive away from the strip. We were glad we did! Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Came here after hiking. Expected it to be busy because it was just around lunch time, but it wasn't. Which was great, because we were starving and we figured the staff can tend to us faster. The food was awesome! The place was clean and neat. Price was decent. Our waitress, however, is the reason why I took out two stars. After a few orders, she stood there and pretty much watched us eat. That was awkward! The worse part is, she took our plates and utensils even if we still had food on our plates! And as she took our plates away, she didn't ask if we wanted to order more or if we were done. She took them, went to the back and then came back and stood there and watched us again. Creeper status. Lol. I was still hungry so I waved and told her I wanted to order more. At this point, my husband had lost his appetite and wanted to leave. I had just a few more bites after my last order came out and asked for the rest in a take-out plate. Regardless of the service though, I may consider coming back. Just hope we don't experience the same situation again. It's hard to enjoy your food if someone's watching your every move."}
{"text":"They have a dim sum and a regular menu and you can order from either.  We ordered all dim sum and what makes this restaurant different from other dim sum restaurants is that it was all made to order and came out piping hot rather than taking it off the rolling carts.  To start I had chicken corn soup and my husband had wonton soup and they were both delicious. We had the pan fried chive dumplings, shrimp har gow, potstickers, fried shrimp wonton, fried shrimp ball and chow mein and we enjoyed it all.  They had some different items but it is quite a ride for us so I am not sure it is worth it."}
{"text":"Best food ever first time here and everything we ordered was fantastic.  Dim Sum is one of my fovorite foods, try the chicken feet they are great."}
{"text":"The food at Dim Sum Cafe is below ok. Before I came here, I read the other reviews from this establishment on Yelp, and saw some negative reviews. So, i decided to try a new dim sum restaurant. When me and my cousin came to this restaurant around 8 p.m., I was surprised that we were the only one dining in here. We order a few dishes. I was stunned that the portion was small. Plus the tasting was below ok. Compared to the food from this restaurant and other dim sum restaurant I usually go to in Las Vegas, the other Dim Sum restaurant is better.  I would recommend going somewhere else than this restaurant. The food has no flavor and seems the food was microwaved."}
{"text":"(Sigh)...disappointed. I was happy to find a dim sum place close to Summerlin, but the food is no where near the quality of the other dim sum restaurants in Chinatown. Steamed Beef Tendon and Baked BBQ Pork Pie are the worst that I've ever eaten. Can't believe I'm going to say this: Panda Express is better than this. I feel sorry for the nice staff working here."}
{"text":"Great little place...awesome Dim Sum. The owner was really pleasant and takes a lot of pride in her place. Soup dumplings were incredible and the shrimp shumai was even better"}
{"text":"Simple authentic Chinese food at a great price.  We paid about $30 for our takeout but it was a lot of food.   Their beef fried rice was very filling and on its own you could just eat it. I love their shu Mai and pork buns. And my favorite was this fried noodles that were crispy but once mixed with the sauce it was perfect! I usually am not a fan of that but the sauce and noodle ratio was just right.  I cannot wait to try more of their main dishes."}
{"text":"Came here on a suggestion from yelp. The staff was really friendly and the food was great."}
{"text":"Very fresh food. I wish I can come here all the time rather than just when i visit Vegas.  Give it a try if you are not sure. I bet you will like it."}
{"text":"I was very skeptical coming here but finally took the plunge.  First if these neon lights were on spring mtn It would be a cover for a massage parlor and not a legit one.   Second every time I drive by there's hardly any cars there so with dim sum where it's usually high volume, how is it possible to serve fresh dim sum? They must be serving week old dim sum?  Well took the chance and as I walked in on a Sunday morning at 11:15 which would be prime time in spring mtn, I walked in to an empty restaurant.   We decided to give it a shot and ordered 6 items including steam beef tripe, ha gow, siu mai, pork steam noodle roll, congee, and steamed beef spareribs.  Other than the ha gow which was literally whole baby shrimp compressed together, everything else was pretty good.  My favorites were the steamed beef spares and the beef tripe.  Total was under 20 bucks and I left satisfied.  Maybe I went in with the absolute lowest expectations - that's prob it.  But if I'm in the area and want a quick dim sum fix and lazy to make the 10-12 min drive I'll come here.  When we left they did get 3 more tables and had 2 to-go orders so this place is managing to survive.   Give this place a shot if you've had the same skepticism.  It's decent."}
{"text":"We went to the place on sunday even if we live in another side of town but we saw their advertisements on facebook so we designed to try . We got there around 12.00 pm . They took time for 15 mins for  take an order . We order about 5 items to see how each order look like .to get our food took 30 mins to get 4 items and one of them the pork was not cook .it made me upset because all the food took too long i guess because the kitchen might be short hand or they cook each item per each time . Over all this place took us one hour and s haft to get food but still missing the items we ordered. But the waiter who serving us he had a great service with apologize what we told him about how worse of the waiting time for the food ."}
{"text":"I think they have another location in Vegas which is better... this location is made to order and the other location had carts going around.  It's just ok for me.  More like something you'd get in a mall food court.  I guess when you want dim sum at 8 p.m. you can't complain too much."}
{"text":"Very nice family place.  The staff is very friendly.  The dim sum is categorized by price level.  We had vegetable pot stickers, pan fried pot stickers and a host of others.  Everything was prepared perfectly including the Chinese broccoli.  We ordered a little at a time and was not disappointed. They also have a full menu of authentic Chinese dishes. I have been here a few times in the past and will continue to patronize this genuinely Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"We thought maybe going to the place around the corner would be a good idea... After we sat down, the waiter was quick o give us menus and move on to the next table. He came back in a good amount of time and took our orders. We got our food about 10 minutes later, which we thought was great. As we started to eat.. We realized we had no water. So we had to ask twice for water. And as we bit into our delicious looking food... We found it wasn't as yummy as it looked. The noodles were too fat, the veggies were cut wayyyy too big and it was almost impossible to grab them and chop it in half. The decor is amazing and the iced coffee was good, but don't eat here unless you want soggy noodles in a slow joint."}
{"text":"Disappointed...  The service was very slow. It's ordered a la carte. One dim sum dish with the tofu skin was dry and hard, baked tofu was mediocre and my favorite fried taro was greasy tasty. The only decent one was the pork siu mai. Will not go again."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS AMAZING.  Only Chinese I'll order from.  Super friendly too.  We have order so many things on the menu, never had a problem.  We have it delivered, super fast.  I definitely recommend to all."}
{"text":"Better than Orchid Garden- SO much cleaner and way better service. Prices are the same if not cheaper."}
{"text":"Me: Great neighborhood dim sum place. The pork siu mai was so fresh and tasty and juicy. All the dishes we ordered (beef chow fun, har gow, steamed pork bun, baked custard bun, sticky rice in lotus leaf, fries taro dumpling) tasted as it traditionally should but was not as greasy, actually. If come again for dim sum fix in the neighborhood. The selection is pretty good but not as much as a trad tea house. For that I give 4 stars. Also, very reasonably priced.   Him: The chow fun tastes almost as good as my grandpa's. It's really good. It's kind of weird my mommy speaks Chinese to the waiters. They're from Hong Kong. The pork buns are good and different because the meat is not small and dry but chunky and juicy. I like the siu mai too because it was really meaty and juicy and not fatty. The bathrooms are so clean, I went twice. I faked it the first time to inspect and then the second because I really had to go. The sticky rice could have had more flavor but my favorite sausage (pork wine \"lop cherng\") was in there so that was good. Order the Siu Mai. Gets 4 stars because no carts of food for fast-eating like other dim sum places."}
{"text":"Always hot and fresh dim sum. Not the carts being wheeled around with warm dim sum. They have picture menus if you need help deciding. Great prices and very affordable. Most importantly its very clean compared to some of the other dim sum places I have tried. Staff is nice as well. Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"bomb ass food. if you live at the union apartments delivery shows up in like 15 minutes."}
{"text":"usually you can only get Dim Sum on Sunday but not anymore.  Normally Dim Sum has carts with cold old food and then one thing you really want is already gone.  Not any more.  This place has Dim Sum 7 days a week and they make it fresh to order.  Maybe that's why it's so good.  Love this place.  You should try it because you will also."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Everything is always perfect. The food tastes so fresh and leaves you feeling happy and nourished, not like some other restaurants that leave you feeling groggy. My fiance and I haven't been able to go a week without eating here since we discovered it lol. The staff and owner are so nice and very helpful too. Definitely give this place a try."}
{"text":"I eat chinese take out a lot and this is one of the best places around. Good selection of dumplings as well,which is hard to find anywhere else. Their fried rice is  also excellent so is the sticky rice."}
{"text":"Need a dim sum fix and don't wanna go all the way to China town? No worries! Dim Sum Cafe has got ya covered! The quality is fresh and tasty and the service is friendly and courteous. I've come back 3 times so far and haven't been disappointed, in fact, I find another dish I love each time. J LOVE That They Have The mini custard pies....My favorite!"}
{"text":"I am not usually a fan of Chinese food but I gave this place a try. I'm so glad I did, this is the best one around its not greasy, it's flavorful, no msg and very fresh. It has quickly become one of my favorite places to eat."}
{"text":"My friend and I went here one night when we were craving dim sum way past the time the other dim sum places stop service. We'd seen the grand opening sign and decided to take a chance on a new place, and I'm so glad we did! The best things we got were the shumai, potstickers, and the BBQ pork buns. All of these were clearly made in house and the potstickers had both pork and shrimp and not too much cabbage like other places! The staff was friendly and service was fast and attentive. We will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Love this new place Fabulous dim sum & great service  You won't hate the prices either"}
{"text":"I had high expectations based on the reviews I read on Yelp, but we were extremely frustrated and disappointed by  our experience.  The food was decent, but the service was so incredibly slow.  We inquired as to the status of our order several times and no one seemed to care.  The place was not that busy, but all we got were excuses and no offer to remedy anything.  Plates came out one or two at a time at an excruciatingly slow pace.  We sat and watched as parties that came in long after us were served promptly while we (as well as a gentleman across the way who was seated before us) sat ignored.  We finally told a waitress that we wanted to cancel the rest of our order.  She was unapologetic and did not remove the cancelled items from our bill.  Never again."}
{"text":"Atmosphere, food, and service all outstanding at this small gem of a restaurant. I like it spicy, and the firebird beef checked every box for my tastebuds. Hubby likes milder fare, and the cashew chicken was perfection!  Chicken fried rice was the best either of us has ever had.  The fried wontons are not to be missed. We will be back often!!"}
{"text":"This is an update review. So I went again and the dim some was fresh make. Uh it was so god."}
{"text":"Highly recommended! Food is so good and large portions at a very reasonable price. The BBQ pork buns are to die for. Definitely coming back again!"}
{"text":"Not bad but I've had a better shumai. Their taro ball was good tho. The place is nice, quiet and clean than most dim sum place."}
{"text":"This place will definitely satisfy your craving for dimsum. The food is good and is close to home. No need to go to Spring Mountain area to get yourself a good treat!"}
{"text":"This is a great dimsum place, staff are very attentive. Our favorites are the yang chow fried rice, bean curd skin roll and the sharks fin dumpling. Don't leave this place without trying their desserts too! The red bean sesame balls are huge and yummy!"}
{"text":"Food is freshly prepared everyday you can tell. Not overly clean atmosphere but very good food. Highly recommend a stop here."}
{"text":"Hidden gem of summerlin!! Who knew there was a authentic Chinese dim sum place. Well the prices are reasonable and they make their own dim sums. Only thing I wish they had the ladies walk around in carts. But because it's away from The strip I can see why they don't. The lunch specials are $7 some even on a Sunday. I highly recommend this place. Don't go to Panda Express for Chinese food. Come Here!!"}
{"text":"Surprisingly very good. I normally go to Chinatown for good Dim sum but this place is just as good . The flavoring was seasoned perfect, not salty. The waitress told me that every dish was freshly made in-house . They have all the specialty dishes that I like from chicken feet to beef tripe."}
{"text":"The food is OK and by no means delicious. Just another Phoenix level dim sum place, nothing exceptional or was it close to authentic Asian standard of dim sum. Took my bf who's from Hong Kong here, and he straight up said the food is nasty lol (I thought it was alright). Biggest complain was for the classic dim sum dish, shrimp dumplings aka ?? was a major fail. He said if a dim sum place can't get the shrimp dumpling right then there's no point to try other things ha. The skin of the shrimp dumplings were powdery, super sticky, and just a very weird texture. Soup dumplings were OK, but again the skin texture is a bit weird.  We also got lamb and preserved vegetable bowl (forgot the exact English name but it's ?????) and that was the best out of the three.  P.s. I am from Guangdong myself and grew up eating dim sum in China which make my standard a little high I guess."}
{"text":"Chef changed recently, is what I was told... just a week before we visited. Menu changed slightly but still served some dim sum including Xiaolongbao.  We tried several different dim sum but none of them really were that good, I don't think this place will be my first choice of Chinese restaurant.  Perhaps given more time, a new chef may get used to the new environment and might get better?  Service was okay. She worked really hard, they were just short staffed on the day we visited.  Rare to find dim sum served at dinner time near here."}
{"text":"This place was so good! It's not like the type of dim sum restaurant I've been to in the past. They serve it all day which is great, just wish they had a cart with with everything on it for the experience lol. It was a little warm in there but everything was fantastic. If I'm ever in the area again, I will be coming back here"}
{"text":"I'd give this place 3.5 stars. Not bad for a non-traditional dim sum place. You order as you go, so you don't have anyone running around with carts. The food is a lot warmer than if it was in the carts. The service was great! Everyone was nice and always checked back to make sure our waters were filled. This will probably be my to go place when I do not want to wait hours in the casino for dim sum of if I have a late night craving. Prices are the same as every other dim sum. Not awesome, not bad, just the average dim sum that makes me wanna go back again."}
{"text":"This restraunt had amazing food but I thought it was a bit pricey and the dim sum selection is limited."}
{"text":"While it is called Dim Sum Cafe, the dim sum selection is very limited.  So if you have a taste for dim sum, this is probably not the place you'd want to come.  But the taste of the items we ordered were good, especially the black sesame bun that's not widely available."}
{"text":"Place was packed for Sunday lunch. Nice little place - very little.  Braised pork belly - SUPER DELICIOUS Lo Mein w/beef, chicken, BBQ - it was ok - BBQ part was the best Shrimp dumplings - MEH, would not get them again  Food was pretty authentic Asian food but I wouldn't come here for dim sum."}
{"text":"Was expecting this place to be a frequent future haunt but no such luck sadly. After reading the reviews and living not too far from this area, was banking on it given the amazing Chinese/Taiwanese food scene in Las Vegas. I added almost as much chili sauce in food weight to get any sort of a flavor or desire to eat. So bummed.  Ordered -  1.) Baked bbq pie (Char Siu Soh) - Commercially made and pre-frozen. And, if they did make and then froze, where's the pork? Yikes. Had two bites. It tasted like pre-made canned puff pastry that hasn't been cooked enough and had what I call, 'The Sheen'. Horrid.  2.)Hot and Sour Soup - Clearly the base for all soups is used and they forgot which soup was ordered. It was the worst hot and sour soup I've ever had, and that's saying a lot. The soup also had 'The Sheen' and tasted as if re-heated several times with oil and water. No flavor aside from oil. Ingredients were old.  3.) Baked bbq pork bun - We were getting desperate to like something. It reminded me of fast food Chinese bakeries. The dough is like sponge cake and it had been pre-frozen. Would be surprised if onsite creation.   4.)Shrimp shu mai - We were in need of liking something and this was okay but not fresh and pre-frozen fast food taste.  5.) Beef and Broccoli - Luckily for my kid, she was neutral on this one due to hunger. Ate some of the beef but the broccoli, as she noted, tasted weird. At first thought it was her pickiness, but the dish was tasteless, the broccoli had a rancid taste, and again w the beef, 'The Sheen'. Carrots were also commercially frozen. Given it was 9.50, could have done so much more.  Am giving an extra star because the staff were so friendly. It was takeaway, and the sauces were placed first in the bag under the food which looked like Jackson Pollock got a hold of brown toned oils and went crazy in a plastic bag and all over all the styrofoam food containers.  Still mourning. Ambiance of place was quite pleasing, though there were only two tables occupied and that may have been a sign. if they completely re-vamped their culinary situation, they would be packed."}
{"text":"Really good Dim Sum, I recommend you try this restaurant.  It's impeccably clean, airy, and has very good service. We tried the pork shui mai, pot stickers, shrimp dumplings, hot and sour soup.  Ingredients were fresh, the food was not greasy and flavors were excellent. Best dim sum I've had in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Food was good. Sho Mai and har gow was good. Eggplant was good. Service was ok. Took forever to get food and steamed rice. Their water tasted funny. A bit pricey for Dim Sum."}
{"text":"I noticed this spot was closer to home and decided to stop by after hiking. I had lunch here around 1pm yesterday. They were busy, a good sign.  It is located on Twain and Hualapai in South Summerlin area.  The place is clean and laid back. There is no steam carts rolling around but your food is made fresh to order.   My favorite in order are:  Sticky Rice in Lotus Leaf $4.50 Sharkfin Dumplings $$3 Red Bean Sesame Ball $2.50 Steamed chicken feet $3 Steamed Beef Tendon $3.50 Pork Porridge $4 Fried Smelt $6.50 Fried Chicken wings $6.50  The service is great, and they speak pretty good English :) The food is fresh and up to par. Just a couple of plates were flavorless and you need to add chilli sauce or soy sauce.  The prices is a few cents more like 20c-30c more compared to the Dim sum restaurants in Chinatown, but to avoid going that far with busy traffic, parking hassle, I prefer to come here."}
{"text":"Dim Sum is my jam. But after living near NYC and London Chinatowns, I've developed a picky palette for places elsewhere. I like this place for its clean open atmosphere and for its fresh servings.  The ordering style does not involve chasing carts, but more like choosing tapas off a menu so food is made to order and therefore steaming hot when it gets to you. Har Gow (shrimp dumpling) was done right, and any dishes with buns were meaty and surprisingly very fresh! The pan fried chive dumpling is a popular pick, but it wasn't my favorite - too oily and average.   Dishes are reasonably priced IMO, making this cafe a hidden gem. Service is friendly but may be a bit pushy/influential? - if you know what you want, order it. I've only had Dim Sum when making a visit, but they have a full menu of Asian entree dishes - including lunch specials from 11am-3pm."}
{"text":"Wow this place is tasty. We had the most amazing general taos chicken. On the more traditional side - their spicy whole shrimp with intestine was super flavorful and spot on. Their dim sum is very good, we loved the soup dumplings and the har gow (shrimp dumplings). The service was excellent, and food came out piping hot. We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Not your average Chinese restaurant.  The customer service was fast and friendly. Highly recommend Shanghai soup dumpling - you won't regret it. The spring roll is fresh, crunchy and taste wonderful. The prices are reasonable for the quality, service and quantity you get."}
{"text":"The owner Sheila was delightful . Explaining the dim sum to us. It was our first time enjoying it. The hot and sour soup was fabulous and the orange chicken the best!"}
{"text":"Best dim sum. I have been here 3 times already and love both their dim sum and Chinese food. In addition their customer service is excellent. The place is a very casual and designed to look like a basic cafe. If your Interested in getting some very tasty food, I would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Every once in a while.... like once a week, I get a hankering for some dim sum! I didn't want to drive across town and was hoping there was something nearby when I remembered there was Dim Sum Cafe a few minutes away. Perfect!   Upon arrival, the restaurant was clean and tidy. There were about 5 people dining in, which I thought seemed normal since it was 7pm and dim sum is usually enjoyed as a breakfast food. We were seated promptly and were handed menus as the server took our drinks. I love the fact that the menu included pictures of the dim sum to make it easier to order. Upon review, here's is all we ordered:  1. Rice noodle roll 2. Pork shiu mai 3. Shrimp shiu mai 4. BBQ pork bun 5. Sweet rice cake  6. Shrimp har gow  7. Chive dumpling 8. Cream cheese curry wonton  9. Daikon cake 10. Beef tendon (we never received).   Alrighty, here it goes... 1. The rice noodle roll came in hot, as well as all the dishes. It was served with a tasty soy like sauce, but not as salty. There were small chunks of BBQ pork throughout the entire roll. Not my fave.. it tasted a bit bland and somewhat watery. I'd probably enjoy it more if it had a stronger pork flavor.  2. Pork shiu mai was hot and juicy. Nice delicate flavor, but again was a bit bland.  3. Shrimp shiu mai was also juicy with a nice shrimp flavor, but once again bland.. see where this is going yet? 4. BBQ pork bun was fluffy and full of flavor but nothing special since it tasted like most pork buns I've had. I just wish there was a bit more filling. 5. Sweet rice cake was fluffy, moist, and sweet. Perfect as a dessert. 6. Shrimp har gow was ok. In need of salt and was overpowered by the dumpling wrapper. Tasted a bit watery as well.  7. Chive dumpling was my favorite of all the dishes! Pan fried on both sides and gave a nice crunch when bit into it. The dumpling didn't need any sauce to go with it since it was delicious on its own. A word of advice... let all your dumplings cool down!!! They are hotter than the devils ass! 8. Cream cheese curry wonton was pretty good. Pretty simple and the curry wasn't too over powering. 9. Daikon cake was nice and crispy on both sides. It gave a nice crunch but was a bit too soft, almost runny on the inside. It was ok.  10. Beef tendon... we actually didn't receive it.   All in all, Dim Sum Cafe was just ok to me, nothing special, and definitely not better than KJ kitchen at the rio. I left full, but not satisfied as I had anticipated. The only reason I gave 3 stars and not 2 was due to the tasty chive dumplings, pork shiu mai, and pork buns, and friendliness of the staff as well as the cleanliness. I hope to be back one day, since I like to give restaurants a second chance especially since this place has such great reviews!!! Maybe it's just me or perhaps it was an off day for them. Regardless, I can't wait to return in hopes of giving them 5 stars!!!"}
{"text":"I found my new dim sum place! Good cheap dim sum, the restaurant is spacey and very clean (including the bathroom!) and service was great!"}
{"text":"First let me make sure you understand the food that we had was well prepared and GOOD. It wasn't fantastic and I was expecting fantastic.  The concept of Dim Sum cooked to order is interesting, but aren't the carts and the wide selection what Dim Sum is all about?  I do believe that there is a lot of pride in the owner who introduced herself and maybe with a bit more variety and either larger portions or lower prices they can be a smash hit.   NOT very busy for lunch on the weekday we visited and that is a shame.  Food quality - Good to excellent - Four Stars Portions - a little too skimpy - Two Stars Prices - Too high - One Star Variety - don't call it Dim Sum and the limited menu is okay - One Star Service - Dim Sum to order came out very slow and that is probably understandable - One Star"}
{"text":"The food was ok,  Service was terrible, they took forever to take our order (10 min for water),  they never stop on the table if we wanted something else.  The completely forgot about us.  We have to walk to the front  counter to ask for the check. We will diffinetly not come back and not recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"went today with my daughter, first time and now I'm a fan, only order the soup dumplings, and fried rice. will be back to try a lot of everything on the menu, Sheila the owner as so nice and friendly and very helpful with the menu."}
{"text":"We went to Dim Sum needing a quick takeout order. We got the Family Dinner A, which came with 2 egg rolls, 4 wontons, 2 egg drop soups, and an entree of both Sesame Chicken and BBQ Pork fried rice. We also got 2 fountain drinks to go. It all came to $20.   The food was prepared quickly and packaged well. Once we got it home, it tasted great. The egg rolls definitely beat out the wontons, though, so if you're picking one, go for those. The entrees were both really tasty and plentiful portions.   We will definitely be going back to Dim Sum to explore more of the menu."}
{"text":"Just ok. Not a fun true busy dim sum place and I'm so sure they don't make their own food. Won't be back soon."}
{"text":"My coworkers love going here since it's close to the office. I've been here a few times & my experience has been pretty consistent.   * Wait Time: They're not super busy during lunch. This can be a pro & a con, but since we go here during our quick lunch break from work, this is definitely a pro!   * Dim Sum Style: They don't have carts going around the restaurant for dim sum. They bring out the items as you order  * Price: Same as other dim sum places. One major pro, their menu shows the items w/ their price!!!! Most dim sum places don't show this, which results in a surprisingly high bill.. That's not the case here! You know exactly how much your bill will be before you get your check.  * Customer service: Their servers & employees are a lot more nicer & polite compared to other Chinese restaurants, so that's a major pro!"}
{"text":"My husband was craving for some dim sum and Great Wall is a bit too out of the way for us so we decided to yelp for nearby dim sum restaurants. Dim Sum Cafe popped up with only 14 reviews but 4 stars so I thought it's worth a try. Not to mention it's only 7 minutes away from our home. I ordered shrimp dumplings, shumai, shanghai soup dumplings, and hot and sour soup. You can definitely taste that the shrimp dumplings and shumai were fresh unlike some other dim sum places so those were pretty good. I had the shanghai soup dumplings for the first time ever and boy did I not like it. I don't blame it on them since maybe I just don't have the taste for that but what I really didn't like was the hot and sour soup. It tasted so bad that I couldn't take another sip. I definitely would not recommend ordering that dish!  Overall the experience was neutral, there were goods and bads. I personally wouldn't come back again not just because of the horrid hot and sour soup but because they simply have too small of a dim sum menu. I wouldn't oppose people from giving this place a try though -- customer service was good."}
{"text":"We were all craving for dimsum one afternoon and I didn't want to go all the way to our usual place (Orchid Garden) so I went on yelp and found Dim Sum Cafe. First of all, their place was nice and clean. Came around 2PM, only 2-3 tables are filled. We ordered to go: shrimp siomai, pan fried chives, chicken feet and baked cream bun.   shrimp siomai - wish I got the pork one instead. This one had a bread-like texture, kind of rubbery chive dumpling - just okay. The best among the other stuff we ordered. chicken feet - good.  baked cream bun - had high expectations on this one! It felt it needed more flavor and custard.  Overall, never returning to this place. They had good dimsum selection but the flavor isn't there sad to say.."}
{"text":"Had come from northside all the way from Aliante to try and see if it's better than Orchid Garden. The place was empty aside from two men eating that was almost done. It was alright and cooked good but I love tripe and their tripe was chewy even after I asked them to steam it longer. It's nice that it's made to order, but waiting with an empty table didn't seem normal. My husband saw a dead cockroach  on the floor, server was nice but forgot to put in one of our order. They took the tripe of our bill. Won't be back."}
{"text":"This place was awesome.  The food was very flavorful without being greasy or overly salty.  The service was amazing as well.  The food was really affordable too.  We will be coming back here whenever we're in Vegas."}
{"text":"I loved the food... it reminds me of what you get in San Francisco Chinatown.   Steamed BBQ buns, pork, shrimp, chicken, fried rice... all fantastic."}
{"text":"Love dim sum, who doesn't?  Came here for brunch over the weekend. Dim Sum Cafe has a short list of dim sum, all made in-house, brought freshly cooked to your table, steaming hot. Care of preparation, and pride of ownership, are evident. Delightful owners and pleasant service. Clean restaurant.  Good XLB, give it a try!"}
{"text":"The food was just ok.  The service was prompt and friendly but the food did not stand out against other restaurants.   The chicken had some chewy parts and the flavor was decent but lackluster.  I was hoping for more but in the end the meal was just average for Chinese food.  Overall it was a nice, clean restaurant but the food left a little bit to be desired on the flavor scale."}
{"text":"I order here frequently and have never had a problem. The food is good and reasonably priced their shrimp shumai and shrimp rice noodle rolls are to die for. Plus they aren't stingy with the sauce anytime I asked for extra they gave it to me no charge"}
{"text":"Small \"hole-in-the-Wall\" type place. Delicious food! We had the soup dumplings, BBQ pork steamed buns, cumin lamb and General Tso's chicken, all came out hot off the stove, perfectly cooked and very tasty! Service was friendly, but seemed a little confused when taking orders which left me wondering if my order was going to be screwed up, but it all came out fine. Half the customers were Chinese, which is a good sign. The meat was American quality with Chinese quality sauce and preparation. They didn't have carts with small dishes. Everything came out from the kitchen. Will go back and try other dishes."}
{"text":"Great dim sum, fast delivery, my go to when I won't cook"}
{"text":"I thought this place was pretty good and the service was good too. They don't use MSG which is important to me. The server was fast and gave us a good explanation of the food. I've been here twice and I will go back again. I have had the Moo Goo Gai Pan which I liked a lot. The veggies were fresh and it was cooked well. I tried the Walnut Shrimp (my daughter's) which was also very good. I had the Monglian Beef the second time I went, which wasn't very spicy but had good flavor, overall. And we really love the Pot Stickers! We also got something for desert but I can't remember the name of it. It was like a small pie with egg glaze on top. It tasted like a cookie and I enjoyed that as well."}
{"text":"It's was delicious, everything was up to par. The customer service was excellent. Will come here ever time I'm here"}
{"text":"Don't let the name fool you.We order to go/delivery off their Chinese food items all the time.There aren't any really  good Chinese places on the west side. I've been looking for 14 years. This place delivers. Big portions and reasonable prices Their Chop Suey has fresh vegetables nicely cooked Chicken. Pork Fried rice is on point. Beef and Broccoli are very good. Won Ton soup is a real broth soup not canned. My favorite is the Singapore noodles! Best I've had in a long time. Only negative are the egg rolls. They aren't big but small and too doughy. This is a small enough of a negative to  overlook. We've had enough failed restaurants on the west side. It would be a shame to lose this one because of their name. Give them a try."}
{"text":"Good dimsum. Not a huge selection but everything tasted good. Shrimp dumplings and siumai, fried rice and Shanghai pork belly were awesome.  Soup dumplings were tasty but the skin broke really easily so it was hard to keep the soup in them before you could get them on the spoon.  Would love to see pan fried taro cake and egg tarts on the menu."}
{"text":"5 stars for the food. Hands down. The place is unsuspecting from the outside because it's just a sign and a simple building and also when you walk in, it's just simple seating with booths and tables. They have cool fish tanks that wrap alongside the walls of the place and TVs playing sports, but other than that there's nothing else that would indicate high quality food and service. But once you order from their menu (which one menu is all traditional dim sum dumplings and another with Chinese dishes) there's not one food item that is not so tasty and made very well, and this is coming from a person who lived in San Francisco for 5 years near Chinatown, and visited New York's Chinatown's Dim sun. One of the best dim sum I've ever had."}
{"text":"Dim Sum Cafe serves excellent authentic food and offers great service. We have visited several times and the delivery is always consistent. Some dishes we've tried include soup dumplings (best in valley), shredded potatoes, spicy eggplant and mince pork, thinly sliced spicy pork belly (best in valley), hot & sour soup, spicy water boiled fish, etc. All were excellent! The proprietor is very personable and makes the guests fell welcome. The staff is very attentive. Very nice ambiance and soft music. We will continue to visit regularly."}
{"text":"Even though this place had rockin reviews, I didn't think it would be THIS GOOD! We ordered the soup dumplings which were literally a burst of flavor and yumminess, the shrimp dumplings which were so simple yet so flavorful (we ended up ordering it 2 times because they were THAT GOOD), the fried potstickers which were just perfect, and the steamed BBQ pork buns which were INSANE! The service was also incredible, the server saw that we were eating the soup dumplings wrong, so she prepared them for us! 10/10 on flavor and 10/10 on service! I will definitely be back and it's definitely worth the trip if you're not from this area."}
{"text":"Dim Sum Cafe is a great place to get some good Dim Sum.  The Fried Sole Fish is a great value.  The Har Gow, Shrimp in Rice Noodle, and Char Siu Bao are very good dishes. Also staff is very friendly.  Great place to go on the west part of town."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and do not come here for dimsum.   I rely heavily on yelp and it's reviews for good quality eats and I'm usually not a big fan of leaving negative reviews unless it's completely warranted.  My husband and I were so extremely dissatisfied with the food here that we just paid our bill and left with most of the food untouched.  If you are looking for a good dimsum place check out the one inside the RIO hotel.  Promise you won't regret it.  Save your money,  don't go here.  You're welcome"}
{"text":"Dim Sum Cafe is a new establishment in a retail strip. The inside is seemingly budgetary, with plain tables and chairs, and just a few items of decor placed haphazardly. The menu was a piece of paper in a binder sleeve protector. So, contemporarily designed, it is not, but...dim sum...at night! The staff was friendly, and quickly brought beverages and answered any questions we had. We ordered shumai, spare ribs, dumplings and the server's recommendation of soup dumplings. The items were great, especially the soup dumplings. Those were sweet yet savory, squishy and full of beautiful, tasty broth. I could eat them every day. I should note that there are other entrees beside dim sum items. So for those who like traditional American Chinese, there is something here for you as well. The bill for two with just soda/tea was under 20 bucks, and well worth it. We will eat here again."}
{"text":"I stopped here on the spur of the moment as I was headed to another restaurant.  I should have kept going.  After looking over the menu, I told the waitress I wanted a cup of hot and sour soup and an order of braised pork belly with preserved vegetables.  She gave me an odd look and then said, \"Those are dried vegetables.  They're not fresh vegetables.\"  My response was, \"Yes?\"  She then told me again they were not fresh vegetables and she added, \"I don't think you'll like that.  You should order something else.  We have fish and....\" and she gestured to other items on the separate, non-main menu.  I just got profiled because I'm not Asian.  I won't like it!!  I don't think she'll like this 1 star review!!!!  I looked over the menu some more and opted for the curry chicken.  In a short time, the curry chicken was brought.  Note that since I didn't say hot and sour soup a second time, it was left off the order.  In a few seconds, she brought the small bowl of rice.  They use plastic chopsticks and I have a difficult time with heavily sauced Chinese food and plastic.  I should have gone to the car where I always keep a pair of wooden chopsticks but I put the plastic ones down and started using my fork.  The server saw this and asked, \"Do you want a spoon?\"  My answer was a quiet but firm, \"No!\"  In a few moments she came to the table with a small plastic spoon that looked like a child's spoon.  The chicken was OK.  The sauce was heavy.  There should be more curry flavor.  This was my fourth time here (and last) and I have always gotten Singapore noodles and after the first time I've had to stress heavy on the curry.  That was my mistake this time.  I finished my meal, paid, crossed off the line for tip, signed the charge, and left.    As you can tell, the service experience was awful.  But I would like this server to know that if she ever came to my restaurant, I wouldn't tell her she wouldn't like the scrapple."}
{"text":"We love to support local business, and we were looking forward to trying this local gem. We ordered 3 different type of dim sum along with the Mongolian Beef. Everything was delicious. The beef was so tender and yummy sauce. Even their spicy mustard was the best. Sheila, the owner was very attentive as was our server, and it was clear they strive to please their customers with great food and good service. We will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Decent dim sum.  The dim sum came to our table hot and tasty, some we liked more than others.  And the service was great.  They kept filling our tea pot and checked to see if everything was ok."}
{"text":"If you're searching for dim sum in Vegas this is the place to go! The food is very fresh,  service is impeccable and the whole meal was enjoyable!"}
{"text":"This place is such a pleasant surprise. I'll admit I had zero expectations for the dim sum cafe just based on the name and location.  However, it's so yummy!   True...you may miss the ambiance of traditional dim sum. There's no steaming carts rolling around. You simply order and your food comes from the kitchen. The major advantage to this is everything comes up fresh and hot! The menu is clear and easy for any novice with pictures and prices.   They have all the classics and favorites and they are done well! They have specials as well to keep things interesting.   There are fish tanks in the wall and it's big and open inside. Service is friendly and sufficient. I have yet to see it packed so you can sit and eat right away.   Dim sum on the west side for the win!"}
{"text":"So far my best place for Dim Sum in Vegas. Food is fresh, delicious, the place is very clean, and they have a big parking lot."}
{"text":"What a lovely place!  The food is so fresh!  The owner Sheila greeted us and answered our questions.  The bbq pork buns are amazing, as were the pot stickers.  Actually, everything we ordered came out hot and very fresh!  Sheila mentioned that she shops for the vegetables herself.  For dessert we had vanilla custard filled buns and they were the perfect amount of fluffy and sweet.  If you're looking for quality dim sum this is the place!"}
{"text":"Love this place! We had fried chow mein, baked sweet cream bun, pork shumai, salt and pepper shrimp, steamed beef tendon, pot stickers, bbq pork rice noodles, steamed pork dumplings... and they were all good yummaaay!"}
{"text":"I always come here for shumai and rice cake. However, their rice cake can be a hit or miss on some days, so be sure to ask if it is fresh before buying. Their egg drop soup is very light and not heavy like more restaurants. Overall, this place is great."}
{"text":"We tried about twelve things from their dim sum menu. My favorites were the pan fried chive dumpling, chicken shu mi, steamed pork bun, and last but not least...fried and steamed sweet cream bum. The fried shrimp ball and stuffed mushrooms were good too. We are going to come back to try their regular Chinese menu."}
{"text":"Probably my favorite dim sum place in Vegas.  I love the fact they don't use carts. You're orders are made to order so you have fresh & hot dim sum no matter when  you come in. I wish the baked char sui bao were made to order but that's hard to do, they just weren't that hot.  Our favorite of the night are the har gow, stuffed eggplant & pan fried chive dumplings. My favorite was definitely the pan fried chive dumplings,  they were The best I had since moving heren The place is beautiful & very clean. I appreciate the fact that they have a picture menu do those dim sum virgins in our party were able to see a picture before we ordered. If we had one negative I'd we wish most of the orders had 4 pieces instead of 3. Other than that we highly recommended this restaurant"}
{"text":"Great service & good selections of dim sum menu. Visit red rock canyon with family in the morning and came here for lunch.  Cute aquariums around the restaurant to entertain the kids."}
{"text":"2 stars for literally  \"I've experienced better\". I agree with June Bug's review. I don't understand where the hype is coming from because you can barely call it dim sum. They have such a small menu for dim sum items and they are the typical buns and shu-mai. It's mostly a typical Chinese restaurant with dim sum items to order. If you're expecting a classic dim sum cart and various items, forget it.  I wouldn't call this a dim sum restaurant. In my opinion, there is no good dim sum restaurants in the valley that I can excitedly recommend and this isn't one of them."}
{"text":"I found a dead cockroach in my egg roll!! I  just couldn't believe my eyes when I saw it........After ccomplaining to  the manager he was very apologetic but at that point I was so traumatized that I just stormed out of the the restaurant. Avoid at all costs!!"}
{"text":"Dim Sum: It's a limited selection, but they make it up by doing the few that they have very well. I have my roots in HK and this is probably one of the best dim sum spots around PHX. It might have been the time of day that we went, but since everything is ordered off the menu, and not the push cart type, the food came out a bit slower then I would have liked.   These all looked like they were hand made, the flavors were all authentic and delicious. The quality was   But yea just look at the photos. They will explain everything    In the end, this place definitely satisfies my dim sum craving in AZ. Will be coming back again for sure :)   Oh I also got the beef chow fun. - you can't go wrong with that. It was stir fried to perfection"}
{"text":"The food here is delicious! I've been searching for Dim Sum close to my house and finally found it! They have a good variety and everything is super fresh!"}
{"text":"This has become my new favorite Chinese food location. Let me start off with the staff, they were probably one of the friendliest staff I've had dealt with. They were knowledgeable on their food and all the recommendations were spot on. The food; very authentic and tasty. They had different categories in regards to what is popular in China and as the waitress told me \"what you Americans like\" which I absolutely found funny.  I would highly recommended this place to anyone looking for some good eats. The restaurant was impeccably clean, the staff was on top of everything. Real good food and service."}
{"text":"I absolutely loved this place, and (I believe she's one of the owners) was so sweet when it came to service and ensuring we were taken care of. I'm normally pretty snobby when it comes to dumplings, the only place I've ever gone to is Chous Kitchen and am always hesitant to try anywhere else because it never compares and always disappoints. This place was amazing their chicken lo mein had great flavor and was cooked to perfection, also their soup pork dumplings were delicious. Did I mention everything is so reasonably priced as well? I'll definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Great little cafe with delicious food, excellent service and really really good prices.  I've been there a few times for lunch and will be going back again soon!  You have to try their shrimp fried rice, fried shrimp balls and dim sum."}
{"text":"Quick service , good food ,  small place but very. crowded ! Love the siumai and chicken feet. Xiao long pao a bit dry would be better with a bit more soupy! Definitely be back !"}
{"text":"The food was ok. If you're expecting Cantonese dim sum you'll be disappointed, it's more Shanghai style. The menu is small, but I think this will grow with time. Good introduction to take friends for dim sum"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!     I love their red bean sesame balls they are bigger than most places and they always cook them right!    I say that because I come here and order them a lot they probably think I have an addiction hahah!   The Hong Kong style chow mein is awesome a must try along with their shrimp balls!! SO GOOD!   Sticky rice is amazing as well! They don't put the egg yolk though.  Sweet cream buns are bigger than most places as well !!    The customer service just depends on who's working I ushually order Togo anyways so I couldn't tell you how the dine in experience is.  Bottom line this place makes bomb ass food!     Come check this place out I passed by this place for like ever and now I'm kicking myself in the ass for not trying it out sooner!!"}
{"text":"It's our typical day after drinking, lazy Sunday and the boyfriend and I were craving dim sum. After getting a business card for Dim Sum Cafe from Orchid Garden, our usual go-to spot for dim sum, we decided to try it out and apparently Dim Sum Cafe has the same owners as Orchid Garden. Dim Sum Cafe skimped on the normal dim sum cart experience and instead provide a menu to order off of.   We ordered the following dumplings: -Har Gow (steamed shrimp dumpling) -Pork shumai -Chicken feet -Shrimp noodle -Pork spare ribs -Fried chive dumpling  Har Gow has been my most favorite dumpling since I was a little girl and in all honesty, it's hard to mess it up and tonight it did not disappoint. The shrimp noodle, chicken feet and fried chive dumpling didn't taste any different than any other I've had before so it's safe to say that it satisfied my cravings. With that being said, the shumai and pork spare ribs lacked in flavor. The sauce for the spare ribs were more liquified than the usual thick, stick to the meat sauce. I do want to say though, where the food lacked in flavor was made up by the customer service and mouth-burningly hot food, which was a plus! To me, the next best thing to flavorful food is super fresh food!!"}
{"text":"Tried this restaurant since my go to Dim Sum place was closed. Very pleasantly surprised. The restaurant was not crowded and not noisy. The food was very good and the prices were par for Chinese restaurants. Dim Sum was ordered off the menu which was a little different than from hailing the carts as they pass by. My favorites were the shrimp balls, shu mi, crab claws, pork dumplings and of course the sticky rice in lotus leaf...oh everything was just so good! I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Great food, clean and friendly people! If you want to try something more authentic, come here with your friends to enjoy good food and company!"}
{"text":"I really don't like Chinese food. But I love this place. I can't resist the shrimp dumplings and bbq pork rolls. And I don't like chicken much but the sesame chicken here is the best chicken I have had in years. Great staff. Sweet owner who tries to please everyone. Best thing is the quality of the ingredients. High quality not the junk most Chinese places use.  Love it. Best Chinese food in Arizona. Trust me on that"}
{"text":"I kept seeing this place, and since I love Dim Sum, I just had to try it.   My wife and I went there around dinner. Not a good idea. We were the only ones in the place during dinner time. Not a good sign.   Food was almost mediocre quality. I have to agree with Andrea S. Pass on this place.  Drive down to Orchid Garden on Sahara. You will get fresh Dim Sum, made all day, and served in the traditional way, not fresh out of the freezer, into the micro wave oven."}
{"text":"First time visit, will definitely return!  Service was exceptional, food was fresh and served steaming hot.  Owner was friendly and helpful when ordering."}
{"text":"I am from Nor Cal so Dim Sum was basically the thing to do on a Sunday back there. I probably used to eat dim sum @ least 1nce a week every week. Ever since moving to vegas I have been hunting for a place to satisfy those dim sum  cravings.  This place did it for me!  Is it the best Dim Sum place I've ever been to? No - is it the best I've been to in Vegas? I think yes.   Also try their Won Ton soup! It's reeealy good. & I'd stay away from the shrimp har gow, the steamed ship dumplings are better. Also the steamed pork dumplings are SUPPER JUICY BUT they do not come with the traditional sour sauce for steamed pork dumpings. Still I would HIGHLY recommend them. :)"}
{"text":"My new spot for dim sum we had such a great experience very clean and friendly staff! Barbecue pork buns and the steamed buns are to die for!!!"}
{"text":"EXCELLENT!!!  I have been looking for good dim sum in the Phoenix area and this is it!  The soup and shrimp dumplings were amazing!  The fried potstickers and bbq pork buns were also awesome!  The only other place I like dim sum is in Vancouver, BC... but this place is just as good!  I HIGHLY recommend it, truly superb."}
{"text":"First time here and the food is amazing!!! This place just opened so i was nervous but i think it will be one of my favorite lunch spots!! Super friendly service and amazing food!"}
{"text":"Great food  and service.  Will be returning again.  Head north on Alma School to get there during construction."}
{"text":"I read some of the poor reviews, but decided to go anyway. Walking into the restaurant,  it was very clean, and had a nice ambiance.  Service was excellent  (no employees with bad attitude at all!). The food was all very good, affordable prices. I rate it 5 stars because we were not disappointed  and plan to return again. The mushroom dim sum was among my favorite,  but it was all very good!"}
{"text":"Totally legit a la carte style dim sum, probably the best I've had in this town. This place is super no frills, but they know their Chinese dim sum. The bbq buns are amazing, they're way better than the ones I've had at much pricier places. They also have a great selection of shrimp dishes, which my mother is very fond of. The service was great as well, even though it was packed when we went at lunch. I'll definitely hit this place up again."}
{"text":"Decent Dim Sum. Unfortunately there are not really good places in Las Vegas or I didn't find them yet"}
{"text":"Great Dim Sum, lunch and dinner  specials at affordable prices. Food is exceptionally good, the restaurant looks new and clean, nice staff. My new favorite place!"}
{"text":"Dim sum served all day in Summerlin? Yes please! All the dim sum we ordered - chicken shu mai, chive dumplings, shrimp stuffed in mushroom, baked BBQ pork buns, Chinese brocolli - came out piping hot and, were quite delicious! We've certainly had better tasting dim sum but we were pleasantly surprised by the quality and taste.  We rarely order Chinese brocolli from the carts because they often are woefully undercooked and barely edible but these were tender and yummy.   We also ordered the roast duck, which was perfectly crispy, and chicken chow fun, which the kids loved. We are looking forward to trying the other things on the menu as the food tasted more \"authentic\" Chinese than the takeout places we resort to given the lack of options in Summerlin.  Service was attentive, the place was clean and we left feeling very satisfied. Definitely our new go-to place for Chinese food and dim sum in the neighborhood - and they deliver!   Give this place a shot!"}
{"text":"If anyone reading this knows of a good dim sum place, let me know. We won't be returning here. Upon walking in to an entirely empty restaurant, we asked for a bigger table with the lazy Susan l and were denied. Told we're only a party of 5 and the smaller table was a better fit for us. If you do decide to take the gamble, avoid the elderly female waitress. I'm not sure what's worse, her or a car salesman. You try to order something, for example the $4.50 Chinese  broccoli, she will tell you it's not good and that the snow pea leaves with garlic is is better. Which is a $12 plate. She also rushes you while you order which we also found pleasant. Then after eating, while a younger girl cleaned our table. She looked at us like we we're absurd to ask for another bag and 2 more to go boxes. She hesitated and came back with 1 box. I had to ask again for another box as originally requested and she again stared at me before going to get another box. Like wtf? I'm not going to stack my food and mix everything together so you can save your 10 cents. To our waitress that stared at us as we left, we left a tip that we thought you deserved. So now you know :)"}
{"text":"Good Dim Sum here, better than a lot of other dim sum places.  The decor is more like a cafe, but It's quiet! The dim sum is made to your order. It's not so crowded for a change!! The place is clean and even the restroom are tidy"}
{"text":"My favorite part about this restaurant was the customer service. All of the older Asian women who served me were so sweet. They were pleasantly funny, sassy, helpful, and attentive. Not something I'm used to at a busy Chinese restaurant.  We came on a Monday morning and had to order dimsum a la carte, which is fine. I thought their dimsum pastries were absolutely delicious. But the meat dishes (i.e. har gow, xiu mai) were rather disappointing. Their prices were higher compared to what I'm used to in Chinatown.  Clean place. Quick service. Lovable servers. Delicious pastries. Ok prices. Disappointing dim sum.  I'd still come back though cause there's many other things on their menu to try aside from dim sum."}
{"text":"I don't know about you but what I've discovered is, not all Asian diners are alike. I try different places and more often than not I am disappointed. Maybe because the good ones are so rare it makes it so much more meaningful when one comes along.   We ordered the Soup Dumplings, Mongolian beef, Walnut Shrimp, and Steamed Dumplings. Each item rated 5 stars. How amazing is that?   The staff are kind and attentive and the owner Sheila truly cares about offering quality food and getting feedback from her customers.  You need to check it out. I hope you enjoy the food too!"}
{"text":"We went on an early Sunday evening not expecting much. There was no one there besides us, The food was better than expected, though the portions are small.  Service was not particularly fast for there being only one table but we were not in a hurry. The menu is small but clearly labeled and pretty helpful. I kinda like the fact that they're not too busy, makes for a less hectic dining experience. Overall, really a 3-1/2 star place, but my expectations for Vegas dim sum is so low that I'll give them 4."}
{"text":"Unfortunately this is the only dim sum place in the Summerlin area so we had to go here, rather than driving down to Chinatown. For a weekday, it was a steady stream of customers but not busy. Everything is ordered ala carte and not with those dim sum cart.  Anyhow long story short, their pork shumai was not steamed enough and both my husband and i took a bite into raw meat. They took it back apologetically and gave us a fully cooked one. But the damage was done and both of us felt sick after that meal.  Next time we'll just drive to Chinatown."}
{"text":"I had a dim sum craving so I tried this place for the first time and it was amazing the fried rice was great, shrimp and pork shu mai was awesome, and their BBQ pork steam bun and Chinese sausage bun omg so delicious a must try NO JOKE really good I might even go back for more. Really close to my house definitely going back"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised to find dim sum in Summerlin. I was even more surprised to have enjoyed my pickings. I'm not the chicken feet gnawing kind of dim sum girl and I stick to my faves.  Baked Honey Glazed BBQ Bun: I LOVED these! They came out fresh from the oven. Warm, super soft and the perfect ratio of filling to bun. The BBQ pork wasn't fatty or oozy and had excellent flavor. I had to order a few to take home to share.  Har Gow: I liked them. Ok they might not be the traditional dim sumy kind but 2 orders of them (4 pieces/order) found their way into my tummy.  Sweet Rice Cake (honeycomb cake). I felt like a kid going to the Bakery in Chinatown with my parents. I haven't been able to find these cakes and it was exactly the way I remember. Slightly sweet, glutinous honeycomb, bouncy texture with a hint of fermentation. I love that my daughter got to try it and likes it as much as I do.  I'm giving 4 stars to encourage my Yelpers to give them a shot. It's nice having a dim sum place near school outside of Spring Mountain. Dim Sum Cafe definitely \"touched my heart\"."}
{"text":"This place does not deserve 1 star because the service was great, everyone was nice and pleasant. However, their food was mediocre. I recommend this place to people who enjoy Chinese food with less sodium. However, if you are like me and enjoy food with flavor, unfortunately I do not recommend Dim Sum Cafe. The Shrimp Har Gow was flavorless and small. The Combo Fried Rice taste was plain, its meat and seafood lacked flavor. The Pan Fried Chive Dumpling lacked garlic. The Chiu Chow style dumpling, I'm sorry, was disgusting and tasted like throw up. The deep fried Shrimp looked bigger in the photo. FYI the shrimp was the size of a dime. The Honey Walnut Shrimp was okay because the walnuts were coated and crunchy, and the shrimp was pretty good, not over cooked, did not drown in the sweet sauce, and about the size of a half dollar coin. The War Wonton soup was the main reason why I wanted to go to Dim Sum cafe, but I was fairly disappointed. It lacked what the other dishes lacked.....Flavor. Salt, pepper, and soy sauce can only help a little. There was no garlic, herbs, onion, etc...nothing to boost the flavor of their dishes."}
{"text":"Best dim sum since New York. Must get the BBQ beef bun. Ordered four different dim sums and each was unique and tasty. Will look for excuses to come back."}
{"text":"This place is really good. I grew up in LA and they have had fantastic Chinese food in downtown LA for my entire life (I am 61). This is, by far, the best dim sum I have had since I was a kid in the early '60s. This is far better than either of the popular dim sum restaurants in Chandler.  No soggy steam cart fare here. Everything is made to order and is as fresh as can be. A+.    There noodles are also quite exceptional. I immediate knew they were fresh and I asked the owner if they made them there. She said they had someone make them for them. They are the best fresh noodles I have had in Arizona.  Really good."}
{"text":"If you want good Dim Sum, drive a little farther and go to Las Vegas Chinatown.  They were located on S Hualapai Wy/Twain in Las Vegas.  They are open 7 days a week from 7am-4pm.  When I walked in, there were about a dozen employees standing  behind the counter for a staff huddle.  One gal seated me and a another guy brought me water.    They had 3 small flat screen tvs and 5 fish tanks.  The booths were really hard.  They didn't have much cushion to them.  Where I was seated, I could hear the kitchen staff and the servers behind me talking and hanging out.  They had nice laminated menus.  The only problem was that they didn't have enough menus.  A woman tried to pick up my menu after I ordered.  But I wanted to hang on to it in case I wanted to order more.  They offered 15 Dim Sum options, breakfast, salads, sandwiches, noodles, fish, From the Wok, and soups.  I ordered 4 Dim Sum dishes.  Fried Calamari ($6.50):  There were 9 lightly breaded rings of calamari served on a saucer plate.  The server asked if I wanted sweet and sour, hoisin, hot chili, or soy sauce.  I choose sweet and sour sauce.  It was served in a little plastic container.  It was watery.  Stuffed Mushrooms ($3.50):  There were 4  piping hot mushrooms stuffed with tasteless ground shrimp and calamari served on a saucer plate.  The server brought me hoisin and hot chili sauce in a little plastic container, and a bottle of soy sauce for the dumplings.  Pork Shiu Mai ($2.50):  4 pieces served on a saucer plate.  They were filled with ground pork and mushrooms.  Steamed Pork Dumplings ($3): 3 dumplings served on a saucer plate.  These were the best out of the 4 items I ordered.  They could at least invest in proper serving plates, offer chopsticks, and have little jars of condiments on the table.  They need a website and a Facebook page.  I paid at the counter and left. Paying $18 with tip was way too much for what I got.   I won't be back."}
{"text":"Good selection of dim sum plus other Chinese food items to order - all off menu rather than from carts. Personally I love arts and the fun of choosing items off them, but ordering off menu means you can get what you want and it is really made.  A it of dealt to get waited on initially, but then we had good service."}
{"text":"Brought my son for a birthday lunch. First let me say the service was exceptional. They were so attentive. The food was delicious. The soup dim sum was amazing. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"great hidden gem!  not the usual 'car't service' but they do cook the dim sum real time, so it's always warm and fresh.  they have great deals and prices are perfect!  nice, clean restaurant.  Food was awesome.  They took care of me any my family and guests of 13 for my bday last week and we all had a great time and were very full when we left.  the chinese food is also good, including sesame chicken and pan fried noodles.  we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Love it...Is now a goto for me. Pork buns and duck are great. They have European football on too:) I know where I'm going when I want to watch a game away from home."}
{"text":"Yummy! Nice location, good variety on the menu! We all enjoyed it and they had vegan/vegetarian options not a ton but there were options :) the service was very good, restaurant was clean... only 1 hair in food lol and nice/clean/simple ambiance. Some fun decor for the kids too"}
{"text":"Great food. The Dim Sum menu was smaller than I'm used to, but all my favorites were there. The lo mien noodles and fried rice were excellent."}
{"text":"We sat down before another party and they got their order taken before ours. We didn't even get acknowledged to see if we were ready to order. I'm still waiting for someone to take my order as I enter this"}
{"text":"Wow ... I don't know how this place got anything over a 1 Star review.  Maybe the 5 stars were for the Manager/Owner.  She seemed nice.  The other waitress seemed nice enough but she mostly looked confused.  She ran around a lot and yet, somehow, the service was very very slow.  I should have left when I ordered some Hot Tea.  Like many Chinese restaurants, they bring some small tea cups and and a little metal kettle with piping Hot Tea.  The tea water was cold.  It took a while but eventually got the owners attention.  She apologized, took the kettle and came back.  This time it was sorta hot.  Later on, when I asked for a refill of the kettle ... the water was cold again.  Didn't bother bringing it up again.  Front of the house needs a lot of work.  In my hour or so there, 4 different tables walked out.  Tired or waiting to be recognized.  Tired of waiting to order.  I should have followed them out.  Although tempted to leave as well, I waited patiently and was finally able to order.  The food eventually tickled in over the span of an hour.  One dish would come.  5 to 10 minutes later ... another dish would arrive and so forth.  To be fair, I'm pretty sure I've eaten worse.  This restaurant did not have the worst food.  I could review the individual dishes but this review is long enough.  Looking around the dining room, I could see many of the tables were also first timers.  Maybe all of them.  Maybe, like me, they were fooled by the 5 star reviews on Yelp.  I was just happy to be finally leaving."}
{"text":"It's just OK!  My family and I decided to visit Dim Sum Cafe on Sunday for lunch. We were seated right away. The ordering process was easy (almost like ordering sushi). We ordered Har gow, beef chow fun, shrimp wonton noodle soup, soup dumplings, shrimp and vegetable egg rolls. The only dish we enjoyed was the har gow. Others were quite bland. We've had soup dumpling before. Unfortunately, the dumplings here are no where near what it's supposed to be (thick dumpling shell and bland). Some of our dumplings barely had soup in it. Service is good. Ask and you shall receive. However, based on the food, I won't be returning."}
{"text":"I absolutely love that I can now have dim sum at any time of the day and in the evening! In addition to dim sum, this restaurant also offers Sichuan dishes and noodle soups.   We stepped in here on a Saturday mid afternoon and ordered a few items from the dim sum menu: Shu mai, pan fried beef bun, scallion pancake, and xiao long bao. All the items are cooked to order but they came out in a short amount of time, piping hot. Out of all the items my favorite was the shu mai. They were four huge pieces and the ground pork was tender, juicy and perfectly seasoned. The xiao long bao were large too and had a lot of delicious broth but the dough was a little too thick and gummy for my tastes. I also would have liked some soup spoons to eat the dumplings with so that I could capture as much of the broth as possible. The pan fried items were fried to perfection, and the beef buns had a lot of juicy broth to them as well. The scallion pancake, with its crispy outer fried layer, was a little too thick and dense tasting for me.   The selection for dim sum is a bit limited compared to the big restaurants with carts and a bit more expensive but I think this is the trade off you get. Less variety and more expensive but fresher product vs. more mass produced taste with more options.  Service was impeccable and the ladies that own the restaurant and work here are so friendly.   I'll definitely be back to try more dim sum and to try some of their Sichuan food too."}
{"text":"I was disappointed when i tried their chicken shiomai, pork siomai and sticky rice. Their dimsum was not at par with Orchid or Other dimsum places ive tasted in los angeles like the new capital dimsum in san grabriel. I wont recommend this if u are expecting to satisfy your dimsum cravings."}
{"text":"Splurged a little and tried the Shanghai soup dumplings (really really good), pan fried beef buns (super tasty), BBQ fried rice, and the Shanghai braised pork belly (this was absolutely amazing and definitely recommend). Service was great and staff was very friendly. Five stars for sure."}
{"text":"I was excited to see a dim sum place in summerlin! The restaurant is pretty big with pleasant decor. I loved the fact that they have pictures on their menu so I no longer have to make up words to let them know what I want. The prices are good, pretty much like any other dim sum restaurant. However, the major difference between this restaurant and your typical dim sum place  is the fact that they do not have the serving cars. You order a la cart and they deliver the items to you table! Overall, a good restaurant to try."}
{"text":"Yelp 100 Challenge 14' * 27/100  Good but not great.   Service was delightful. We had an attentive server who was prompt and cheerful. He got our food in on time and happily split he check when we were done. Food was as they were. Couldn't help but wish there was a wider variety of yum tsa food choices like cheung fun (beef wrapped in vermicelli noodles) or sweet tofu dessert. Nonetheless, they had a buy 1 get 1 free promotion that day for the chicken siu mai which was a nice surprise.   Bathroom had mood lighting by the sink but was pitch black once we entered the cubicles. I had to turn my flashlight on just to know where to sit and find out where the tissue paper was. Restaurant was clean but nothing really stood out."}
{"text":"This place is clean, the service was great, the price was ok but the food was average."}
{"text":"I absolutely loved the food and atmosphere here, if I could I would give this place a 10 star rating. The waitress who took care of us was so nice and I have to say was one of the best waitresses I have ever had. She helped us with the menu and kept making sure we had enjoyed the food and had everything we needed. Now for the food we got the chicken feet and crab wontons for appetizers and the spare ribs and sheswan pork for dinner. The flavors for all of these were so delicious. I had never tried chicken feet and got it just to try something new and I was not disappointed. The taste was so flavorful. The ribs were also good, the meat fell off the bone. We got the banana egg rolls for desert too and that was beyond what we expected. I don't know who thought to put banana in egg roll wraps but it was delicious. I will definitely go back for more :)"}
{"text":"Pretty good service overall. We ordered cream cheese wontons and steamed pork dumplings for an appetizer, they were amazing! We then ordered Mongolian beef (which wasn't spicy even though it said it was but no biggy) , beef with broccoli, and combination fried rice, everything was very delicious and very fresh tasting. I would love to come back!"}
{"text":"Good food and great service! I ordered beef brisket and tendon noodle soup, pork lo mien. Also ordered some din sum I think is a lot better than Mekong place foods.  Next time I will try more new things!"}
{"text":"Good but expensive! And I like my meat on the well done side, their meat is very rare and chewy"}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem in a strip mall! Delicious and economical. The best soup dumplings and BBQ pork buns in town. The staff are very polite and friendly. Recommended!"}
{"text":"Check out this place cause it's close to my house I order pork siomai, shrimp siomai, white rice cake, chicken feet, chives dumplings and spare ribs. The shrimp siomai looks like shrimp balls one you can buy at 168 Asian grocery the rest of my order they're all ok but not that great. This place will be my quick fix for my Dimsum cravings since it's closer."}
{"text":"Good services, food is make to order. Hot out of kitchen to our table. No carts, but same as Taiwan, they bring order to our table. Will def return."}
{"text":"Been coming here for about a year now .. Service has been spotty .. Sometimes they forget a few items, no biggie tho . It's not a typical dim sum place, where there's carts rolling around, you order as you go. Food is good !"}
{"text":"A must have!! Best Chinese around!! Super location, yummy fried rice, and great service.  Sesame chicken is the bomb!  If you have t tried you must visit."}
{"text":"This restaurant appeared on Yelp as a new restaurant. Tonight I stopped in to have some dim sum, and I reviewed the menu and decided upon an entrée instead. The meal was excellent and prepared well and very delicious to eat. Upon entering the restaurant I looked at several different tables and the food looked delicious. I had some trouble deciding upon some dim sum and as I decided to try the entrée I knew that I would try dim sum here another time. If you're looking for dim sum or a delicious meal this is definitely the place to put on your radar. There was a little bit of disconnect with my server but that's because he's young and learning the business. That observation should not encourage you to shy away from this restaurant. I'm giving this restaurant a highly recommend."}
{"text":"Super fresh dim sum. Friendly staff. Great lunch. They do not come around on carts, you order off a picture menu."}
{"text":"Can I get whhooppp, whoooppp! We've struck another gold mind here in The Valley Desert of Phoenix, AZ....And it's this yummy Dim Sum, we even bring our family and friends from Hawaii to come check it out and their response is \"Hooooo, this place is broke da mouth more better than some of the places back home - aww you guys lucky you get it fresh!\"Plus, the price is so reasonable you cannot go wrong - for feeding four hungry people, starving our bill came out way less as if we were to go to some practical burger joint -and with quality taste... lol! Their Customer service is BEYOND exceptional over here. They are the most sweetest and kind people ever, there is some that have a small language barrier but, eh being born and raised in Hawaii and surrounded by a lot of different culture diversity you learn to listen and pick up a few words here and there to understand.If you don't understand than ask again  There are a few places here that offer Dim Sum and some are scary to step in especially when you see that \"Yellow sign\" from the health department - ohhh no, I don't think so! and you have a place like this that serves their Dim sum and other entrees on their menu \"All Day\" which is unheard of for me - Dim sum is set by certain hours and it's not fresh, it's been sitting there for awhile in the warmer! lol  These guys they make it so nice and fresh, where it comes out hot and just so favorable. You just cannot beat this experience and yes, I am blessed to live in AZ to enjoy a diversity of delicious dishes.  I am again very happy that there are a lot of ethnicity restaurants that are popping up slowly here in Arizona where the owners are actually chinese or close to it's culture making the food!   Can't wait to go back - I'm hungry again - just thinking about your guys Dim Sum! It's sooo delicious"}
{"text":"i was very disappointed with there dim sun. it tasted like it was frozen not fresh & left over from the day before. in other words terrible."}
{"text":"Still love this place. Great food and service. Shrimp rolls and dumplings, best scallion pancakes, great hot and sour soup. Orange chicken first rate, tender, crunchy, not too sweet and lots of orange flavor. They made Mongolian lamb for me. Tons of food"}
{"text":"Please trust yelpers when they say a place is not great.   I was craving for dim sum, and it was close by, so why not?  I was ignored the moment I stepped into the restaurant, despite the fact that they were not busy. I ordered har gow, shrimp noodle, chicken feet, beef tendon and shark's fin. My shrimp noodle was bland. The har gow was tough. My beef tendon lacked a lot of flavor. Chicken feet and shark's fin are the ones i enjoyed. Their food is not the best, but it's somewhat edible.   Wont be back!"}
{"text":"They can't answer a phone for pickup and can't speak English. They hung up on me twice because they can't take an order in English."}
{"text":"This is a little hidden gem!  The food is outrageously delicious, the service is fast and friendly! The host makes sure your you have everything you need to experience the fantastic flavors of The Dim Sum Cafe!"}
{"text":"I walked in by myself at lunchtime thinking I'd do something off the lunch menu.. quick and easy because who eats dim sum by themselves.. lol.. turns out i do!!  On today's visit I had the shrimp dumpling (4), BBQ pork bun (3) and shanghai soup dumpling (6).. all of them were delicious!! Definitely hit the spot.. the soup dumpling if you're not familiar is the one that you put the whole thing in your mouth, bite into and the hot soup pours into your mouth (be careful it's hot when it first hits your table)..   They do not have the steam carts so you order like sushi .. from a paper menu.. they don't have a lot of variety/options but they do have a solid variety.   the service is fast and friendly .. the staff teams up and checks on all tables.. they were busy but there was no wait to be seated and food arrived quickly.   I'll be back!!"}
{"text":"Overpriced dim sum and isn't all that special.   My mom and I came here because of the stellar reviews and we were super excited to come here. I'll start with the positives, it's very clean, the service was great, and the atmosphere of the place seemed good even if it's located in a not-so great area of Mesa.   However, the menu is not that special. And to be honest with you, I don't understand why people would come here for overpriced dim sum items that taste the exact same thing as going to Mekong or Phoenix Palace. As a matter of fact, they only have a limited option of dim sum items that literally is double the price of those previously mentioned restaurants.   We ordered around four dishes, mostly cause they seemed super expensive. We ordered the shu mai, the chicken feet, the bbq pork buns (char siew bao) and soup dumplings!   Then chicken feet were so normal, kinda smaller than other places. The bbq pork buns were tiny and dried out. The soup dumplings broke right when we tried to grab one, the flavor was good but the skin seemed dried out. The shu mai actually tasted pretty good. Nice and hot, and better than other places that I've been to.   Overall, yeah I feel bad for giving this place 3 stars but it's not what the reviews say. It's overpriced for generic to lower quality dim sum items that you can get on the weekend. I wouldn't recommend coming here again. Just go to Mekong or Phoenix palace for dim sum. Go to Chiou's kitchen for soup dumplings."}
{"text":"Quick friendly service.  Clean.  My favorite were the curry puffs!  My meal consisted of three dim sum [prices do vary; the dim sum is grouped by price] selections and a beverage and it came to approx. $16.  I plan on returning to try other options."}
{"text":"This place is very big with many tables and booths (a bit dingy) but I never see more than 4 parties seated at a time?  Any who, my favorite thing about Dim Sum cafe is the convenience... You can go at any time and get the dim sum you crave made to order! They have pretty much all of the popular dim sum dishes and they also have a Chinese main menu and Chinese traditional dishes menu. Service is always fast and friendly. The prices are great and they accommodate take out orders~   The only thing that I've recently noticed that needs to be fixed ASAP are the steamed dim sum dishes. They keep coming out over steamed and way too soft... Ugh. Hopefully they fix this.   HOT TIP: Look at their daily specials board! Some times they have discounted dim sum... (Hopefully it's not just the old dim sum that they're just trying to get rid of... Lol)"}
{"text":"Yay we may have found a new Chinese place! Isn't it strange that Phoenix is a pretty large metropolitan area, but it seems starved of decent Chinese places? Thank goodness for this little restaurant!  We weren't very hungry, but had been wanting to check this place out for a while so we stopped by at lunch. We were seated and ordered right away. We tried the soup dumplings, scallion pancake and the black sesame buns. I have seen that some of the other patrons mentioned a long wait time for food, but ours came out very quickly (10 minutes). Everything was hot and tasted delicious! We can't wait to come back and try some of the other dishes on the regular menu. Ever since C-Fu was sold, decent dim sum has been so hard to find, so we'd like to see this part of the menu here expand a little. Maybe include some egg tarts?"}
{"text":"My family and I have recently adjusted our diets.  In the last 3 months we haven't eaten any meat.  However, that does not change the fact that we love good food!  We normally go to Chinatown's Orchid Garden for good Dim Sum.  But found good reviews for Dim Sum Cafe and it's in our part of town.  Needless to say, this place is awesome and we now have no need to go to Chinatown for authentic Dim Sum!  Here's what we got when we were there:  Vegetable Fried Rice (it has egg in it), Chinese Broccoli, Veggie Chow Mein, Red Bean Sesame Ball, Mushroom Shumai, & Vegetable Eggroll.  So, from what we ordered you can see we didn't actually have a ton of Dim Sum.  Based on the Dim Sum we received I know for a fact this place knows what they are doing.  We eat a lot of Dim Sum but due to the dietary restrictions we've recently took on we were a bit conservative on what we ordered.  Overall, this place is a great value for the price.  The location is extremely clean and stylish (compared to Orchid Garden in Chinatown).  The food is excellent and has a bit of the Hong Kong flair to their cooking.  The Dim Sum isn't sitting on steam carts which mean it's way more fresh than we're used to.  And surprisingly for someone that doesn't eat meat there are a lot of options."}
{"text":"\"to touch your heart\"  I've wanted to try Dim Sum since I watched this TRUE LIFE episode on MTV years ago. Watching all the small plates on little conveyer belts and carts looked pretty cool... DSC doesn't use carts which is okay because even my friend agreed the food is so much more fresh made to order (she's very experienced in the dim sum tradition).   The service is fast and efficient. All of our food arrived fresh, hot and equally delicious.   Highly recommended!   Total: $59 bucks  What we ordered: Shrimp Har Gow $3.50 Shrimp In Rice Noodle Roll $3.50 Crab Claw $6.95 Sugarcane Shrimp $5.50 **So huge & flavorful Steamed Chicken Bun $2.50 ** My friend hated these regrettably  Egg Rolls $3.00 Spinach Mushroom Dumpling $3.50 Pan Fried Clive Dumpling $3.50 Coconut Roll $2.50 Snow Peas W/Garlic Sauce $11.95 ** Amazing"}
{"text":"This was our first time here and usually get our Dim Sum fix in Seattles International District.  We were pleasantly surprised.  Everything was very good. We had the Pork Shumai, mushroom shumai, baked BBQ pork buns, shrimp har gow, and pan fried Chive dumplings.  It was all good, our fav's were the pork shumai and the pan fried chive dumplongs.  I would give it 4.5 stars if it let me."}
{"text":"Top 5 best dim sum places I've had! We came from SoCal to Vegas for the week and noticed this little cafe. Great service, amazing food, and awesome price for what we ordered."}
{"text":"We've been many times to Dim Sum Cafe but always ordered dim sum. Tonight ordered from dinner menu and the egg foo young probably the best I've ever had. Made fresh from scratch! Delish"}
{"text":"Best place found to have legit Dim Sum! Great service and taste. Soup dumplings had great flavor and the potstickers tasted so authentic! Staff was very helpful and friendly. I would recommend to ALL"}
{"text":"Chose to try this place for the soup dumplings. And....they were pretty good!  I tried a few other places but this one if my favorite thus far. The dumpling wrap is thin enough and the meat and soup had awesome flavors. I forgot to take pictures I was too busy enjoying them but will do next time I stop by here again. They have plenty of other dumpling choices too and overall the food was good. Nice little spot."}
{"text":"I came here for a family outing. We were trying to avoid the casinos due to the kids. It's not your typical food cart dim sum place. You order what you'd like and they bring it out. The benefit is that your food is hot! Service was friendly but the food just didn't do it for me. Some items were bland and others were salty. It didn't exactly satisfy my craving for dim sum. I might give it another try but no rush."}
{"text":"We have eaten here several times.   Every meal has been delicious, the staff is friendly and helpful, and the restaurant is clean.  You can order several dim sum options from the menu, and they have a full menu of other options as well.   We like their Hot and Sour soup.   I like that they have aged vinegar along with soy sauce on the tables.  We have taken friends there and everyone likes it."}
{"text":"This was the worst dim sum experience I ever had. When we're went in this place they have only three table sit there. We sit and take 10 min to get the service.And take more than 20 min to get first dim sum. We're order 7 or 8 dim sum dishes. We're sit there more than 45 min. Not even get 4 dishes. We're had to take it to go and they're not even get all of our food the we're pay for it. They're say the steam dishes it take longer. We're understand but if it took this long it not normal for dim sum lunch. Good luck do the business like this."}
{"text":"Food was great service was great. I have eaten here several times and it is always the same quality and service. Love the fish tanks in the walls will come back here time and time again"}
{"text":"Sorry place went down hill . I guess they got new owners and the chief is not the same . It's a whole new menu and dim sum sucks now . The hot and sour soup is not the same like before . No more Shanghai spare ribs . Place is just your typical Chinese restaurant nothing special . What a shame now I have to find another dim sum spot ....."}
{"text":"This place has a wide variety of dim sum! We tried the Shanghai soup dumplings(so freaking tasty), potsticker which were obviously homemade, BBQ pork buns, and BBQ Pork fried rice. Fried rice was one of the better ones I have had. Hope this places get the popularity it deserves!"}
{"text":"3.5: Something's better than nothing - Limited selection of made-to-order dim sum in a no-frills environment  If you have a word in your name, it seems like you should focus on that. From the dim sum they did have, I recommend the veggie spring rolls, char siu bao, and chicken feet. On the mediocre end but not bad were the scallion pancakes and soup dumplings. The fried dough was crispy and not very oily but there was no congee to dip it in. All in all, the dim sum was simple and didn't leave you feeling gross from the oil but a little unsatisfying because of the lack of items and a little pricey for the portions. The veggie lo mein was tasty as well.  You can choose your dim sum from a list on a slip and then order anything else off the menu. The staff seemed to care about the patrons and the food came out at a good pace. Hopefully they'll expand their offerings and stay in business!"}
{"text":"Most definitely going back here again. They serve Dim Sum until 9:00 PM and the prices are exactly the same! (unlike Orchids)   You order dim sum from a menu and it comes out piping hot. I was a little doubtful about this as I'm a dim sum \"cart\" guy but I've now seen the light.  I highly recommend the fried chive dumplings. I've had these in plenty of places and this was the best I've had.  What makes this place such a good deal is the size of their portions along with quality. Most dishes come with 4 pieces instead of the standard 3. Much  better deal and flavor than Orchids which I consider to be massively overpriced and overrated.  Highly recommend the fried chive dumplings and the chicken baos. Actually all the baos were very good and a steal at $2.50 for 3. The seasonal snow pea \"leaves\" were excellent but a bit pricey for a vegetable dish. Very good though.  The shrimp har gow and siu mai were average to me although ymmv.  Restaurant was very nicely furnished and QUIET. If you go to regular dim sum places you'll know what I'm talking about. A bit out of the way in the very nice suburb of Summerlin.  My new must visit place when I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!! Haven't had dim sum in a hot minute so decided to stop by as I had heard good things. Was not wrong!!! Got the shrimp dumplings (4 pieces), the spring rolls (2), the lo mein and the bbq pork buns (3 piece) and the 6 piece dumplings. The bbq pork was sweet and savory. The dumplings were perfectly crispy on the bottom. The dumpling sauce was sweet but not cloying and the chili oil sauce wasn't overpowering and perfectly complemented whatever you wanted to pair it with. For two people came out to $30. The service was fast and the servers and owner were super sweet. Coming back and bringing more people!!!"}
{"text":"I Loved this place!!! I had never had DimSum before in my life...but today I was on a lunch break with a good friend of mine and we stopped by to check it out...the food was soooo tasty and the prices were so affordable!! We ordered 5 different types of dimsum and tea and seaweed salad and we got stuffed.   Only paod $23 between the 2 of us...and the place is very  clean, service is friendly, and the decor very inviting.  I recommend checking it out on your next lunch break!!!!"}
{"text":"Returns for another visit to try out other dim sum dishes. Beef tendon blew me away, very tender and flavorful. Buddy loves the steamed buns varieties. Shanghai steam buns is well done, try their red vinegar as dipping sauce. Service again very good, despite a busier scene."}
{"text":"My buddy and I was driving around looking for a place for lunch in this AZ hot summer afternoon and we stumble upon this restaurant. Not knowing what to order, we pick 3 random dishes in the\"Chefs Specialty\" section.  The fried tofu turned out really good and fresh.  Beware of the \"water-boiled fish\" however, if you cant handle spice, do mild.  We picked medium and it was spiiicey! But it was good though.  Of all the dishes that we ordered, I really enjoyed the wonton soup, highly recommended.  We will definitely come back to this place whenever we're in town.    P.S. we came around 3:30ish and it was hot outside but the restaurant temperature was okay, the fans helped"}
{"text":"Taking a short vacation to Vegas, I opted to go to a late lunch with some friends.   Looking for some dim sum, we stumbled upon this cafe and decided to check it out. Perhaps the hour was strange - 4PM or so - but the place was empty. Fortunately we were quickly seated and helped out.  The food wasn't bad, but also nothing too fantastic either. The service was alright but our waitress remarked how nice it was that I knew how to use chopsticks...perhaps it was because of the company I was with but it seemed like a strange thing to say out of the blue.  At least the custard buns were $2.50."}
{"text":"We took a group of 5 here today based on the early recommendations on Yelp. Not at all disappointed. This place is legit. I have had Dim Sum at one of the highest rated places in the country and this was very comparable and in the case of several dishes, this was better. The only thing missing was a good, flavorful chili paste. They had a chili sauce, but it fell short for us. Two members of our group aren't Dim Sum fans so we tried some entrees as well. We had the Mongolian beef, Kung Pao & Orange chicken. I preferred them in that order although all were good. Orange chicken was light on flavor, but the breading was very good.  At the time I am writing this, I see a single 1 star review. After tasting the food I can only assume this person was so upset by the wait time that they couldn't bring themselves to fairly judge the food or the restaurant as a whole. When you arrive, they tell you that everything is hand made as well as made-to-order. It shows in the quality. This is not a quick lunch, especially if there is a crowd. Realistic expectations would be helpful during a lunch or dinner rush. We were the only people there at the time and still spent 45 minutes to an hour at lunch. If you want fast, expect less than fresh and don't come here.  Will definitely be coming back. The best Chinese, Dim Sum in particular, that I have had in AZ, if not just about anywhere."}
{"text":"Great food, very clean and inviting! I prefer dim sum on carts... But we are in vegas not San Fran (where it is everywhere)! For ordering dim sum it was truly good and I regret not checking it out sooner since it's near my barre studio. Overall great food, good prices, and very clean! I enjoyed everything I ordered with my friend... And we even took some to go. Definitely get the custard buns and also the spinach dumplings are yummy :)"}
{"text":"I drove by this place several times after I saw to Grand Opening sign and decided to get dinner for take out last night.  Wow, I was amazed at the selection and freshness of the food.  The pork dumplings were freshly made and delicious.  It came with a special house sauce that complimented the dumplings perfectly.    The teriyaki chicken had great flavor and was perfectly cooked.  We added a house special shanghai noodle with shrimp that was outstanding.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I stopped by Dim Sum Cafe for lunch last week and it was a disappointment.  The menu has everything from American breakfast, Dim Sum, Salads, Sandwiches/Burgers, Spaghetti/Ramen, Sweet/Sour Pork to Fish and Chips.   When I saw the menu it seemed funny to have so much of everything that was not Dim Sum. They did not have a lot of Dim Sum on the menu, maybe 15+ items...no Har Gau (shrimp dumpling), a must have for any restaurant wanting to serve Dim Sum.   I ordered 3 different types of Siu Mais (Chicken, Pork, Shrimp), only the Shrimp was okay, the pork and chicken both needed flavoring. Imagine flavorless pork, yuk. I also got the chicken pot stickers (made from store bought pot-sticker skin) which was also tasteless. The eggrolls, ehhh...stuffed mushroom/shrimp ehhh...and a fake sharkfin dumpling (was told that's what it was) also ehhh.  The waiter said all their Dim Sum is made to order or heated up when order...it all came out not very hot. I had a red bean ice to drink, that was okay but not enough since it came out in a short glass.   This restaurant just opened a week ago and I think they are trying to be jack of all trades and unfortunately they have not even mastered their namesake (Dim Sum). If they named the restaurant Dim Sum Cafe, you'd think they serve really good Dim Sum, not so here.  The service was okay and the restaurant was clean and bright but I would not venture to this place if you are serious about Dim Sum."}
{"text":"We had a great meal. The dim sum was cooked to order and we liked having time to read the menu to make our choices. Everything was fresh and delicious. Great service. We will be regular visitors from now on."}
{"text":"We came on a Friday around noon and the place was not busy.  We were seated promptly and greeted by our server.  She was friendly and full of energy.  We ordered our usual favorites; however, she convinced us to upgrade from Chinese  ($4.50) to the snow pea greens ($11.95).  That turned out to be the best dish....fresh, tender and delicious!  We liked everything except for the bean curd skin rolls which were on the dry and salty side.  We will be back to try their other dishes when our dim-sum cravings strike again."}
{"text":"We had walnut shrimp, shrimp fried rice, salt and pepper calamari and stir fried snow pea leafs and garlic. All very good and the serviced was awesome as well! YES"}
{"text":"I can't complain,  but not excited either. . Good service, kind people. . Comfortable and quite. . I will give it another try later."}
{"text":"Not your typical dim sum joint so if you don't mind a short wait for freshly made food you won't be disappointed.  Everything we ordered was perfectly cooked and delicious."}
{"text":"I really like it here.. but the anxiety you miss from other dim sum places is what you don't get here.. everything is made to order and I will say one very good thing about the food. Everything is piping hot so you don't have to worry about old food. One of my favorite things to eat at dim sum is Shumai and Fried Taro Puffs. The pork shumai was pretty good and juicy and the taro puffs were very bland. The Hargow was ok and chicken feet was ok. My wife liked how clean it was here and for that reason alone I maybe coming back but as far as flavor i feel I'll never have as good as an experience for dim sum comparable to LA,San Fran,NY"}
{"text":"This restaurant, while new, is nevertheless a refreshing experience. I've been there a few times now, and I really like their Xiao Long Bao, which really reminds me of those made in China. They've also added some new things to their menu, like Cumin Beef, which was rather interesting. I am rooting for this business to thrive, because they really offer something special."}
{"text":"They changed  menu to offer more dim sum, unfortunately still limited on their dim sum,the noodle dish portion was kinda small, and I try to order sweet custard bun, but not available ,, dim sum items made fresh, the shrimp stuff peppers were made fresh and came out hot, but the sauce lack flavor,, and  I rather have the dim sum carts go by, once and awhile so I can get food quickly.. They cannot have carts go by as there is not a crowd, to have the food ?it on them all day, somehow this place is not in a good location, people will just pass it by ,, they need to do something to bring in the crowd, improve food taste, reduce the cost on the noodle,food dishes and or increase the portion... Sorry will venture for dim sum ,down at orchid garden, Cathay house..."}
{"text":"So far this is the best Dim Sum restaurant that I have ever been to in this city. This place is clean and most times isn't as busy as I'd expect it to be. My favorite is the shrimp dumpling and chow fun. They have individual dish plates available (family style) as well as their dim sum dishes. It isn't traditional where waiters roll around a cart and ask you what you want, instead you just let your waiter know what you want, and they bring out the items to you. Portions are okay in my opinion. Although they have 3-4 pieces per bowl it actually adds up and satisfies you. Their menu is categorized by prices: cheapest to most expensive so it accommodates diners on a budget!"}
{"text":"We ate here DEC 17th 2017. The food is amazing. The dim sum is cooked just right. This is a perfect little hole in the wall spot . The owner is compassionate about her food, customers and staff, that was clear when we ate there. She answered any questions we had while we were there. On top of that they made me a birthday dessert while I was there, and sang  , you could tell that was out of the norm for them. The resturant is clean. Check it out! Also there is a Dutch Bros in the area too."}
{"text":"Great place! Shiela is a kind,thoughtful,hands on friendly owner. Food was great,highly suggest trying this new local spot"}
{"text":"Love this place! At first, it's kinda weird for dim sum without cart but i actually enjoyed it. Foods are much better than chungs or orchids...  Very tasty and fresh :)"}
{"text":"We had enjoyed dim sum at a location on the strip, but we wanted to try something new. Even with the cost of an Uber to and from our hotel on the strip this place was cheaper and tasted 100% better! We had hot/sour soup, wanton spup, 7 different dim sum plates and an amazing dining experience! This place is all about the food. If you are looking for fancy entertainment go elsewhere. If you want delicious food for a great price go and see the people at the Dim Sum Cafe! Tonya"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery from Dim Sum Cafe and it did not disappoint. Our dinner arrived in under and hour and the food was fresh and hot. We got combo fried rice which was some of the best we had. Steamed and baked bbq pork buns took me back to SF Chinatown. I will continue to order from here. Very very happy with speed of service and quality of food."}
{"text":"There are a lot of competitions of Dim Sum in Vegas, but this is the closest one to my house. It is not my go to spot for dim sum, but it is a convenient place to grab Dim Sum or Cantonese style dishes. The menu item is limited for a neighborhood joint, but it has the standard Dim Sum selections. If you want extensive authentic items, this is not it."}
{"text":"It was just ok. The service was sloooow. Not what you expect from a dim sum place where you typically sit down and start eating immediately from the cart. Some items that we love at other places we did not care for here (pork schumai). We are adventurous eaters and tried the shark fin dumplings. No thank you. Staff was friendly though."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!! The food was excellent and clearly made with love. The staff was very friendly. I highly recommend the soup dumplings. Incredible!!!!"}
{"text":"One word. Yuck. This place is the most flavorless dim sum place I've ever eaten at. I love Dim Sum and was excited to try this place, but everything had no flavor. Even the chili oil had no flavor. The service was fast and the waitresses were nice. The area was clean, but the food was just flavorless."}
{"text":"Always friendly! Excellent neighborhood little place for a quick bite! Fresh ingredients with reasonable price. Been going there for really long time never disappointed. Clean environment, easy parking, great food. Definitely recommend to everyone!"}
{"text":"I thought I would give this a try since it is in my neighborhood.  I also wanted it to be so good. Not so much. Went on a Sunday. Not too busy a time. Good service. Food, not so great. Ordered a variety of food. All of it a same tasteless taste. Went home to cook myself dinner."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped here for a late lunch and was pleasantly surprised. We love Chinese food but it is really hard to come by a place that has cooked to order Chinese food.  Look no further, this was absolutely some of the freshest we have ever had. The chicken is all white meat and literally melts in your mouth. My husband order a dish with shrimp and it was cooked to perfection, snappy when you bite into it. Our desert (picture attached) was a fried banana and ice cream, so good!! As we left, we decided this is so worth the drive from our home 15 miles away."}
{"text":"This place has such a friendly staff, our server was the owner and she was so nice ! The food was great ! Dumpling \"sui mai\" was delicious and huge ! Very good Chinese food and not the take out oily stuff !!"}
{"text":"Fast service.. good food.. clean restaurant.. serves dimsum all day!!!!  My new favorite dimsum spot!"}
{"text":"I was hoping this place would surprise me but unfortunately dim sum in Vegas is still disappointing.  There were some things that were not bad, but definitely not amazing either.  The taro balls were decent, as well as the tripe.  The pork spare ribs were okay in terms of flavor.  The pork shu mai was strange tasting at best.  The BBQ pork buns, the pastry had a strange taste.  And last but not least the straight up disgusting shrimp roll.  I can't even describe the strange starchy texture of the exterior or the off putting shrimp inside.  Eek, this was just a hot mess.  We left a little queasy in the stomach.  The atmosphere is pretty sad feeling as well, think old struggling diner.  If your Chinese, you probably will not enjoy your meal here.  The one good thing I guess...you will never have to wait for a table here.  We came at 1200 and there were only 4 other tables full."}
{"text":"When you want freshly made dim sum instead of off the cart..this is the place to go.  Awesome staff, excellent ambiance and all of the delicious dim sum you could want.. plus...a regular lunch/dinner menu.  I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"The best dim sum I've had in metro Phoenix. Compares favorably with places in San Francisco and Orange county, CA.  The place is a dump. But, it's clean.  Our server, maybe the owner, was very friendly and attentive.  They were out of some items. Just means there's more to try next time. And, that's kind of authentic, too.  Price to portion is very fair.  Happy to see they were doing a brisk business on a Saturday night.  Update: someone messaged me and said this place has a new owner and that I should re think my review. Ok:  I am aware there is a new owner. It's why I gave the place a try! If I could give the dim sum 6 stars I would.   The rest of my review stands. To the person who message me: get a life. Your opinion is yours and mine is mine. You've been blocked.   If good food is your thing and ambience isn't super important, give this place a try."}
{"text":"Great food and service fresh made dim sum no carts food is all fresh made to order. Excellent service and nice and clean. Great food and great service around the corner from home. I'm a regular and I highly recommend you try it you will like it."}
{"text":"Fantastic fresh dim sum options. I loved the steamed bbq pork, dumplings, Chinese broccoli, sweet buns, pot stickers...we ordered so much food we brought most of it home. Also got an order of noodles, ate about half & boxed those to go too. Server was attentive and all were nice. Definitely will be back for round two."}
{"text":"This place was amazing for my Dim Sum fix! The prices were great! The service was perfect, very friendly, and clean. Brought back alot of childhood memories and close to the house!   Will be going back forsure! My favorite dim sum dish were the fried shrimp balls Nom Nom"}
{"text":"This was simply the best Dim Sum in town. Juicy pork dumplings (Shanghai soup dumplings) which are so hard to find, and even harder to find done well... so well done here. All dim sum made fresh everyday. All of the other standard menu items we ordered, were unbelievable."}
{"text":"I order a simple pad Thai I would not say the best I had but was tasty and not heavy at all plus like the service"}
{"text":"After reading others' reviews, my curiosity proceeds me.  A new restaurant needs more time to proof themselves.  Hence, I ordered a take out and check out their dinning area and exam the restroom as I awaited for my order.    1.  the bean curd skin roll     Rate: 1.5 Note: The bean curd skin roll tasted old- more of the boarder line spoilage taste.  2. Sticky rice       Rate:0 (yes, it's a zero star)  Note: The sticky rice had too little stuffings.  Most stuffings are pork fat with very little meat.  It has a very mild rotten meat kind of sourness taste which is rather unpleasant for me.    3. Shrimp dumpling      Rate: 3 Note:  it tasted average. Neither bad nor impressive!   Facilities:  Restroom  -5  The bathroom was dusty, things were broken everywhere. There were one missing light bulb, one broken paper towel feeder, one very dimes light bulb.  A very dusty soap bin and sink counter.   The sanitation standard is not up to my standard.  My biggest pet peeve for a restaurant is dirty restroom.  If they can't keep that room clean, their kitchen won't be any better.    Overall-I would give negative stars if allowed.    Sorry, I won't come back and strongly recommend others to think twice before coming here."}
{"text":"I live in the area and was excited when I saw a Dim Sum place opening up.  Sadly food is borderline inedible.    The Mushroom Shiu Mai....the mushroom it was served on couldn't be cut!  It acted like rubber.  You put a knife to it and it would retain it's shape once you lifted the knife from it.  I've never seen a mushroom do this.  Needed to make serious effort to cut through it.  I tried a small taste  and had to remove it from my mouth.    The shrimp dumplings/potsticker seemed old.   The shrimp in the dumpling was mushy and fell apart.  It was not seasoned and was bland.  Took one bite and left the rest.    The one cart of food they were selling looked old.  The egg rolls did not look like they were made in house.   When asked about some of the other dim sum on the menu the said that was made to order as it doesn't hold well.   Which gave me reason to believe the food on the cart wasn't made right away and looked its age.    The pork buns were \"OK\" nothing special.  Could use a bit more filling in the buns.    The Chicken dumplings were average.  They were actually the saving grace of the experience.   Found it odd you had to actually request the standard sauces that are served at normal dim sum places.   We had the hot mustard and the red chili.  Both sauces were good.    The ice tea was fresh......I wasn't offered a refill or asked if I wanted another drink.  I don't think the place will be there for long."}
{"text":"I mean I can literally walk here. So I guess it's not that bad. Actually it's ok for how convenient it is. More like if u need a quick fix and don't feel like driving to chinatown, which is ultimately what u should do for fresh dim sum. They've focused more on their identity as a restaurant & got rid of the random menu that included burgers n such. So here's what to order:  The Chinese broccoli is a huge portion and worth the money. The leek dumplings, chive dumplings, & bbq meat pastries are pretty good. ALMOND COOKIES. Stay away from the sticky rice in lotus leaf and turnip cake. Definitely head to spring mountain for those."}
{"text":"Great little place tucked way off the strip. Wonderful selection and a nice get away from what Vegas wants you to see. Worth the trip."}
{"text":"It is hard to find a great Dim Sum restaurant in the valley when you grew up eating at different locations in the San Francisco area every Saturday morning. However, after much searching, I am so glad I came across Dim Sum Cafe!   My husband and I ordered dim sum for takeout and were very satisfied with our selection. We ordered: shrimp dumplings (har now), shumai, pan fried pot stickers, Shanghai soup dumplings and Shanghai style spare ribs. Each was absolutely delicious and we were not disappointed! Although the selection is smaller and the price is higher you gain so much more with quality. I will definitely be visiting again and more frequently to satisfy my dim sum cravings!"}
{"text":"When craving dim sum this is the spot when I don't want to drive too far for dim sum.  They don't have the traditional carts when dining in but they have pictures on the menu. This place also delivers, which is a plus."}
{"text":"Omg, amazing dim sum. Where do I begin. Friendly staff, very cute dinging area, delicious food. Handmade, amazing dim sum. The Shanghai soup dim sum was our favorite. When me and my husband are in this part of the valley again we will be here in a heart beat!"}
{"text":"Not amazing dim sum, but great for being so far from Chinatown! Its great for a quick fix. We ordered the steam beef rolls, chicken feet, steamed beef tendon, and pork dumplings. All were good and decent.   Also, we love spicy so one of the first things I look for is a full jar of chili oil. Ours was empty. It doesn't look like it gets too busy here, so not sure why the staff doesn't have time to fill the chili oil at every table.  Overall, food is okay. I'd come back for a quick cracking fox, but not for quality dim sum."}
{"text":"This place was so delicious! All the food was delicious. We got both dim sum and their general Tso chicken. So stinking delicious. Wow let me say delicious one more time. We came 40 minutes before they closed and they still so kind and took good care of us. Definitely coming back here!"}
{"text":"This is the best Chinese Restaurant in Summerlin. The Dim Sum is made fresh on demand. However the menu has all of the traditional Chinese dishes. You must go and try the Dim Sum, Shrimp fried rice, Mongolian Beef, Eggplant, vegetable egg rolls, etc Great service and Outstanding fresh ingredients = a great dining experience"}
{"text":"A very nice setting in the south western part of Las Vegas.. A more modern setting compared to a traditional style dim sum restaurant.. You order off the menu and the food comes to you instead of food carts moving around and picking out what you like.. Food was amazing tho.. Very flavorful and fulfilling..   Service was ok.. It started out great with a guy being polite and answering all of our questions.. And getting us everything we wanted.. Until a lady started cleaning our table at the end.. I was disappointed at the fact that the lady didn't ask if we were done with our food yet because I wasn't.. And she started clearing our table and I was felt that we were being rushed out.. I wasn't done drinking my tea and she already took the tea pot away when there was still a lot of tea left.. and the worst part.. she just stood there about a few away from my table and stared at us making it really uncomfortable..  Thanks for the experience of how rude and awkward this place can get.."}
{"text":"I personally love coming here as it keeps us from going into to China town for dim sum. There dim sum is great ,however I've grown to love there pan fried chive dumplings. The service is fantastic, and the restaurant is really calm, and clean. It's a nice place to eat and they have tables that can hold large groups/families as well."}
{"text":"There isn't much Dim Sum spots here around summerlin area, but this place just recently Opened so I had to try it out.   There isn't the traditional go around dim sum carts at this place it's mainly just to order with the server from the kitchen. The dining ambience is very spacious and clean. Customer service was not bad compared to other restaurants.   It's a reasonable priced entrees they offer. Some entrees were kind of a disappointment and most were not bad. I enjoyed the garlic snow peas and the egg custard bun. I don't know if I'll be coming back to this place again for dim sum. Its mostly a one time try spot just Becuase of my cravings tonight and it was close to my house."}
{"text":"Delicious food! Definitely recommend getting he Shanghai soup dumplings (xiao long bao) and the Shanghai rice cake stir fry. My family is Shanghainese and we can confirm this place's authenticity."}
{"text":"Finally found a closer dim sum place to our house! Even though they don't serve theirs in a rolling cart, all we ordered are fresh and tasty! We've gotten back here several times for lunch & dinner and every time we were pleased with our order."}
{"text":"AWESOME find, so glad we stopped in to try this restaurant.  It is near our house, not sure why we didn't go before.  Now we are there twice a week for lunch!  Delicious food, yes, it IS Dim Sum, but not the traditional wheeled carts Dim Sum.  This is HOT and DELICIOUS Dim Sum at its very best.  Food comes out fast, staff is very pleasant and courteous.  So very happy we discovered this hidden gem.  Worth going out of your way if you have to, trust me."}
{"text":"Super great food! I really enjoyed the atmosphere and the quality of my meal. No wait and easy fast service. Will be back soon."}
{"text":"Nice made to order dim sum place w/some good dishes and some mediocre.  Not quite Cathay House but the chive dumpling, stuffed eggplant and pork buns were excellent.  Service was good and friendly.  Place is clean and spacious.  I would give it 3 and a half stars.  Prices btw $2.50 and $3.50 for most dim sum.  Full Chinese menu available.  Good chicken egg too young, Chinese vegetables and war won ton soup."}
{"text":"I am so disappointed. I live so close to this place and thought it could be a \"go-to.\" My husband and I dine out a lot and when we find somewhere we like we become frequent goers and loyal customers!   The service was ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE. From the moment we walked through the door the middle aged man who sat us and waited on us was impolite. It didn't bother me at first. I considered it was due to a language or cultural barrier. Then I saw him interacting with an elderly couple who sat in the booth next to us. He wasn't exactly bubbly with them but he sure treated them with a lot more respect than he did us. The slightly younger gentlemen who looks like he might own the place, also began helping the couple next to us, asking them if he could get them hot sauce, soy sauce, etc. While our cups remained empty and no one ever returned to ask how we were doing or if we would like anything else, even though we kept the menu after our initial order and indicated that we would order more food as we went on.   The only reason I gave 2 stars is because the food wasn't terrible. It wasn't out of this world. It was... mediocre at best. Had our server returned to our table, I could've had more of a chance to judge the food. But so be it.   I was really hoping this would would be an amazing place! Another sad example of poor service ruining any potential."}
{"text":"Salted fish fried rice and chow fun noodles is where its at!!! One of the only know a places i know that serves dimsum after 3pm. They have all the usually dim sum foods, their service was good too."}
{"text":"Very tasty. Ordered Honey Walnut Shrimp, Orange Chicken, stuffed eggplant and Coconut Roll. All was very fresh and was delivered very fast with a friendly driver. Portions were huge so we could split and still have left overs Look forward to trying more things on the menu!"}
{"text":"So good, the steamed sweet cream buns are seriously some of the best I've had so fresh and sweet I order a second round, I was full but I had to have more haha :). I love it and so glad it's so close to my house!"}
{"text":"Love love love this restaurant!! I've gotten take out from here a few times. The steamed pork buns are insane...so light and fluffy. The  red bean sesame ball is delicious. The shrimp dumplings are perfect. The chive dumpling was excellent. Their mango sticky rice is amazing too! The chicken shumai and stuffed mushrooms were ok.  The take out holds up very well. Not greasy at all and you can tell it is all homemade. The prices are great too for the quality. Very impressed! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"April 19th. PRETTY, PRETTY, PRETTY, GOOD!! Coming from Los Angeles, Chinese food is hard to come by in the valley, especially living in the West Valley. HOWEVER!! I found this place to be equal to my long since retired favorite restaurant in Gardena Ca... Ting Sing. The beef broccoli was on great, the beef was sliced STEAK, not that fatty meat you get at some fast food place. The Shanghai Dumpling Soup finalize my luncheon, now I need a nap."}
{"text":"8/29/14.  I'm not a huge eater of chinese food, but this place was awesome.  I had the shrimp noodles, my daughter had the beef fried rice, aunt had calamari, etc, and all were amazing.  Our server was also really nice.  I can't wait to go back on my next Vegas trip."}
{"text":"The service here is so friendly and attentive.  I loved the dim sum dishes I ordered (shumai that were GIANT-sized; soup dumplings; glutinous rice cake with chicken and mushrooms inside; and BBQ pork steamed buns).  The non-dim sum food was okay but not my favorite.  We ordered Beef Chow Fun and stir-fried veggies from the menu.  Next time I come, I will stick to the dim sum choices!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing for Dim Sum! The service is really nice and the food is even better. Everything is served fresh and tastes great. Highly recommend if you're looking for a quaint place with good food."}
{"text":"I'm so glad I found Dim Sum Cafe on Yelp. I was happy to try their Shanghai style rice cake dish. I've had this dish numerous times in California. Although I remember it being less saucy and more soy sauce based, I still enjoyed their version of this dish.   I also enjoyed their dim sum dishes. Everything came out steaming hot which is a big bonus as some of the other big dim sum places serve cold dishes when they have been sitting on the carts for a while.  The soup dumpling was delicious. The skin was on the thicker side, but the flavor was spot on.   The scallion pancake was excellent. It had nice golden brown and crunchy exterior and soft interior.  The chicken feet, pork buns, and green beans were all spot on. I can't wait to go back. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Food was bland. I had high expectations and was disappointed since they have good reviews on yelp. The reviews were very misleading."}
{"text":"Dim Sum: Brunch That's Anything But Dim.  I've been having dim sum as far back as I can remember.  As a kid, I wasn't really into it.  I went to school five days a week, just let me sleep in on the weekends.  Baba and Mama W. liked having dim sum at precisely 10AM.  That means I had to be up by 8-9AM to get ready.  Ugh!  As an adult, dim sum is a much more enjoyable experience.  And with Dim Sum Cafe, you can have dim sum all day long --- You could get out of bed at 5PM and still get your dumplings!  Yes!  Dim sum is the Asian people's brunch but instead of alcohol and mimosas, you have it with tea to help with digestion and aid in digesting all that grease you're eating.  Shout out to hometown China for making everything greasy and a round of applause for Tums.  What acid refux, amirite?  Dim Sum Cafe sits in the spot where I had a terrible XLB experienced I won't soon forget.  Being such, I walked into the restaurant tentatively.  I'm glad I was pushed to try this place though because the food was bomb.  Dishes starts around $4 which is a little bit more than the dim sum places in town but things are cooked to order.  So forget about getting over-cooked and over-steamed dishes from the steam carts, you can get your food hot and juicy.  Yas!  The chicken feet was okay, a bit lacking on flavor but you can tell clean oil was used to fry them; the har gow was delicious with their translucent wrapper being the perfect texture; the Shanghai soup dumplings were juicy although they really need to give their customers the Chinese ladle spoons to enjoy these babies; the black sesame buns were standard; but the siu mai was truly amazing. The meat was so smooth in the siu mai.  Mama W. always told me too slam the meat mixture when making dumplings to aerate the meat and I wonder if that was the trick to getting such a great mouthfeel.  I did have a hiccup though with one of my orders that I won't go into detail.  The staff did everything they could to fix the problem so I'm not mad about it and it clearly didn't drive me away from leaving them a positive review but it's also the reason I can't give them a solid 5-stars.  I'll definitely be back again though!  You've touched my heart, Dim Sum Cafe.*  * Dim Sum (??) means 'touch of the heart' if translated directly from Chinese."}
{"text":"Good dim sum. Reasonable pricing. Problem is you eat too many dimsums and they do add up. Overall, food was good. The service was fast. Only bad thing is its really far from china town thus less busy."}
{"text":"Lots of Dim Sum to choose from! It's a laid back atmosphere where you order off a menu with Dim Sum divided up by price with the cheapest being $2.50. Unlike lame tapas places where you order something delicious for $8 and you only get 2 small bites, these portions are much better and each one could be a satiating snack in itself.   I kind of went nuts and ordered more than I could eat but it was worth it: Fried Shrimp Ball, Pan Fried Chive Dumpling, Stuffed Eggplant, Baked BBQ Pork Pie, & Chicken Shu Mai. I liked the Chive dumpling and BBQ Pork Pie the best. The crust around the pork on those is pretty weighty and dense so they'll fill you up. Delicious!"}
{"text":"So, looking to eat Dim Sum on Chinese New Year in Chinatown is probably going to cost you at least a 45 minute wait. Let's not forget the Saturday/Sunday morning/brunch rush.   I found this place as a desperate attempt to skip lines, get good service, and most importantly, stuff my face with the glories of dim sum awesomeness.   This isn't your typical \"authentic\" dim sum where you'll see carts coming around. Yeah, I like that part of dim sum, too, but, having had eaten here, I've come to appreciate the beauty of a sit-down made-to-order dim sum.   For the first time in my life, I was able to be present during my meal, focusing on what was on my plate and appreciating every bite of what was happening to me  rather than having my eyes darting all over the place, looking at what the next cart has to offer, frantically attempting to grab every goodie from each cart.  Pros:  No wait here. No lines.  Fresh items that are cooked just for your order.  Lower possibility of over-ordering, because my eyes are always bigger than my belly.  Good pricing.  Delicious Quick/good service   Cons: No cart people walking around?   Items ordered:   Pork Porridge- 5 star. Who knew porridge could be so good without adding soy sauce. The broth was so delicious, I was amazed at how they had made this.   Stuffed eggplant - 5 star. OMG. Do it like Nike, because this stuff is sooooo good.  Steamed pork Dumpling - 5 star. It ain't Din Tai Fung, but, you can't compare anything to that standard. This is as good as it gets for a dim sum spot.   Pan fried chive dumpling - 4 star. Pork Shumai- 3 star.   Chicken Shumai- 3 star.  Egg roll- 2 star. Good, nothing extraordinary Combination chow fun- 3 star.   Red bean sesame ball- 5 star. Crisp, light, fresh, not too oily.  Steamed bok choy- 3 star. It's veggie. What can I say.  Radish cakes - 4 star (special menu). My fave, but not on regular menu :(.   I can't believe in my dim sum history, I'd pick a sit-down place to be one of my fave and best moments, but, yes, I think I have found my spot. I shall report back after I have tried the other famous spot at the Rio casino...but, till then, I give this place my solid 5 star.  Oh, and I hope they carry white vinegar in the future. I can't enjoy dumplings to the fullest with red vinegar, which is apparently all they have for customers to use for the dumplings.  Don't forget to pick up an almond cookie for 50cents on your way out. This isn't that cheap, nasty, hard almond cookie you can get at CVS or in a box. It tastes homemade, and crumbles in your mouth."}
{"text":"Ever since being in Taiwan I have been craving dim sum like crazy and it has been an adventure trying to find any here in Arizona. I found one other place that wasn't very good. This place is AMAZING. Everything was so good. I can't wait to go back! And the lady who took my order was super sweet and helpful. Thank you for being awesome!! I will be back!!"}
{"text":"This place is a gold mine for dim sum lovers. Dim sum is typically only served in the morning, normally 11-3pm, so it makes for a great brunch/lunch meal. However, with this place, I can now have dim sum for dinner! Best. News. Ever. The food is delicious, and it comes out hot and fresh. This is a nice change from the typical dim sum where the food is pushed around in carts (it stays warm, but hot is always better than warm). Pricing is normal compared to other dim sum places as well; I recommend the shrimp dumplings (har gow) and shanghai soup dumplings (my first time having them, and I was not disappointed!).  Staff was extremely nice, attentive, and quick. I'll definitely be back to have more of the soup dumplings, as well as to try the dessert!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy having dim sum close to my house.  I like that it's made fresh to order and they don't push a cart around trying sell you items.  The pricing is reasonable and the regular menu items are very good too.  My favorite dishes are beef chow fun and salted fish and chicken fried rice.  They remember my order and ask me how many orders of BBQ baked pork buns I would like before I sit down to eat.   They also have big round tables with the lazy susan in the middle so you can pass entrees around large parties with ease and share."}
{"text":"They have some things to work on, but I'm giving 5 stars because I've never gone to a dim sum place in town that I really wanted to go back to of my own free will.   First, a little history of my dim sum perspective. Since I was young I've gone to the best dim sum restaurants in San Francisco with my parents, and since coming to Las Vegas we've also tried practically every dim sum joint in town available. Cathay, KJ's in Rio, PingPangPong, Orchid's, Chang's.... The only time I go is when my parents are in town and it's all the same to me. The best communication is in Mandarin or a dialect, otherwise its pointing at things. There are a variety of dishes, lots of shrimp based things, many dishes are very salty, very heavy, very oily. I don't like any of those latter points.   I'm not saying that Dim Sum Cafe food is bland. Not at all! But in comparison to all the others, it is not so heavy that it makes me want to stop eating after a few tries. It also seems to be less oily and heavy than other places I've tried.   One big thing I really like is that you can order dim sum any time of the day and they make it to order so its hot and fresh, not on a cart for who knows how long. This does mean it will take a little bit for your food to come out, but it's worth the wait to me. I was initially a little wary since another review said it was a sister of Orchid Garden, who gave me cold dim sum so I never went back. Fortunately, nothing was cold, stale, or old here. The quality seems to be quite good, and everything tastes great.   There are some Chinese only speaking employees there, but they do their best and mean well. It did take a little while to be noticed and seated, and service seems a little bit slow depending on which server you get. It might be a little bit of language barrier, a little shortage of staff, a little less experience with customer service, but whatever it is a little training or hiring of experienced servers would smooth these bumps quickly.   For a Saturday night there were not many people there. I don't know if it was the location or that it's still a new place, but I hope they can make the right improvements and stay in business so that I can keep having dim sum that doesn't overwhelm me!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place because it's conveniently located right next to my house and I've heard really good things! A friend of mind had told me that the owners were the same as Orchid Garden, so I was quite weary to try this place only because I am not the biggest fan of their dim sum. However, I figured I'd give it a go and the bf and I ordered...  - FRIED TARO 8/10: Really yummy savory taro filling with a delicate fried outer shell. Bf said it was a little salty.  - PORK SHUMAI 5/10: Did not taste like the shumai I'm used to. It had a weird smell, kinda like a dog, but it tasted okay. The bf did say he liked this. - BEAN CURD SKIN 9/10: I actually quite enjoyed this one. It had vegetables on the inside and wasn't too salty. I would come back for this! - SHRIMP HARGOW 2/10: I've never had hargow I didn't like until today. Shrimp was not fresh and had a weird texture. The bf and I didn't want to eat more than 1 bite.  - RICE NOODLE w/ SHRIMP 2/10: this is usually my fave dish anywhere I can get dim sum, however the rice noodle was over cooked and was soooo mushy. - SWEET RICE CAKE 7/10: This was good! I even brought some home to my mom since it's her favorite. My only complaint is that it's not as moist as most other places. - RED BEAN SESAME BALL 9/10: Served hot and fresh, really yummy.  I think I'd definitely come back to try the other dishes. Service was friendly and attentive and I like that the dim sum is made to order."}
{"text":"Being from the LA area where there are dim sum joints everywhere and having just finished my massage and shopping and not seeing many Asian people around, I didn't expect much from here.   I was craving dim sum and glad I gave this place a try.   They don't have carts so your order (I think) is pretty much pace to order.  Took a little longer but everything was piping hot and fresh so I didn't mind.  Everything was good, I kept wanting to order more!  The pan fried chive dumplings were really good."}
{"text":"At first i was hesitant, throw me off the blue dim sum sign.  This place is so good. Flavorful! Fresh to order."}
{"text":"I went to a few dim sum places from yam cha, the one at gold coast and this place dim sum cafe is the best we have found.  A celebration for special occasion for dim sup as good luck.  The place is modestly quiet, selections are enormous with a menu that just makes you ponder what to get.  Everything tastes and looks fresh it is easy to get greedy that your table for two will be full of platters.  Definitely suggest it here."}
{"text":"Very cute small restaurant. Service is quick with a staff of 3. There is a limited dim sum menu but my favorites are on there. We decided to try a little of everything on the menu. My favorite was the soup dumplings. Everything was not overly salty or oily. I will definitely be back to try the full menu."}
{"text":"We've tried pork buns, shumai, chicken feet and water boiled with fish. Delicious! Glad we found our new go-to dimsum/dumpling place."}
{"text":"Not only was the food Hong Kong tasty but it was served HOT! and good Chinese food is always served HOT!  Ten stars. We tasted the chicken chow mein (HK style), salt and pepper calamari (the best in Vegas), Chiu Chow dumplings (very yummy! don't often find Chiu Chow food in the U.S.) and bean curd skin rolls....all so VERY good. The staff was attentive. While it seems like slow service I call it relaxed and the wait was worth it because the food was made to order and so fresh!  Oh yes, don't forget the sesame balls. We ate the lotus seed filled one and they were so good we took home an order of red bean filled sesame balls! We will definitely return; it is more convenient than driving into Chinatown (cuz I'm lazy!)"}
{"text":"I really get annoyed that so many \"YELP ELITES\" seem to have an issue giving 5 stars. Even regular Yelpers do it-if it is great it is great.   My review as I come after my massage (medical massage next door at Body Kinetics). I've been twice and I'm a major lover of Chinese food. This did not disappoint. For quite literally next to nothing you can eat a whole lot of dim sum. They are quick and terse (not really service with a smile) but when they are that busy and running around you can't blame them-especially with these prices.   A few tips-don't rely on photos as they aren't always the same as the food served-for the most part yes but if you don't do dim sum ask, also the spare ribs are quite nasty, not the red long spare ribs seasoned as you may be accustomed to but a little bowl of fatty, very little actual meat and embedded bone (got it twice so I vouch for this). Also TIP-an egg roll is a SPRING ROLL. I knew this and they clearly show it but if you are looking for good old fashioned DEEP FRIED, CRISPY, PORK AND VEGETABLE EGG ROLL-go to a Hunan restaurant.  All said I really think for $20 to get beyond full is a bargain-especially when the food is good."}
{"text":"No traditional carts. Everything hot and delicious. All the steamed dumplings we choose were good. Chou-chow and shrimp my favorite. I liked the chicken potsticker too.   Open area clean..wanted to try the sweet cream buns but I didn't have room since we were going for ice cream up the street"}
{"text":"My new favorite Dimsum and Taiwanese food. Small restaurant but give best service. Everything serves hot, fast and tasty. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"I've been to another Dim Sum restaurant in town that is always crowded and you feel rushed. This place is not like that! It wasn't too crowded, service is great and food is awesome!"}
{"text":"For some reason, everything tasted ten times better today than it did the previous visit. Everything was at perfect, warm temperature...made to perfection! The workers were a lot more friendlier, especially Carly, and the manager even came by to ask how we were doing and if we needed anything. We ordered the pork shumai, shrimp shumai, pan fried chive dumplings, and pork steamed bun. So so delicious and definitely sufficed my dim sum craving! Happy Friday the 13!"}
{"text":"At first I was skeptical coming here, since there was a ton of bad reviews. The food turn out pretty good. I really like the fact that this restaurant is close to where I live, so that way I don't have to go to Chinatown for some good dim sum. They also make the food fresh, instead of having it pre-made and ready to serve. It may be a wait but its worth it. In addition, the staff is super friendly and nice. I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"This restaurant has been open for a short time but if the meal we had is any indication, it should be here for a long time. We started with two items from their dim sum menu. The spring roll was a delicate wrap that was nice and crisp.  The steamed dumplings also were made with a delicate wrap that wasn't doughy like you often find.  We shared an order of orange chicken which had tender white meat chicken.  All three items  wwere delicious.  The dim sum are served all day. The dim sum menu offers a variety but is not as extensive as you find at some of the restaurants that offer dim sum only at lunch. The staff was friendly and helpful. We will definitely be going back to try some of their other dishes."}
{"text":"First time here and it was great! I love dim sum and I've been to several around town. Very clean, food is fresh and the staff is friendly! Not all speak English but that's okay as long as they're smiling :). I will definitely be back as I also want to try some of their entrees- they look delish!"}
{"text":"Consistently amazing! Great service and dependable delivery! They always remember my preferences and strive to exceed expectations every time ."}
{"text":"I love dim sum and one day my husband and I took hualapai to get to target and I saw the restaurant. Since we live close we decided we'd come by and try it.   It's small on the inside and not traditional where you'd see a lady come up to you with a variety of foods from a cart where you can pick your dim sum from. Instead they provide a menu with pictures which was nice since we don't exactly know what we're getting when we do get dim sum from a cart anyway.   We choose quite a few dishes and I enjoyed most of them. We got the pork shumai, Steamed shrimp dumplings, shrimp hargow, pan fried chive dumplings, shrimp rice noodle, crab claws, sugar cane shrimp, and the waitress convinced us to try this snow peas vegetable.   Overall, I was full after all the things we ordered. My favorite was the crab claws. They come like the shrimp ball but on crab claws which is cool. The snow peas vegetable reminded me of the Chinese broccoli we usually get but without hoisin sauce. I'd come back to try other things on their menu in the future."}
