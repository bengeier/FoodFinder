{"text":"Friendly service and chill atmosphere. Pricing is decent too.

As expected they do not serve alcohol but have a variety of other drinks to choose from.

The flavour selection for shisha is also good.  Not extensive but more than sufficient. 

Worth checking out."}
{"text":"Been to a few hookah bars in the area and I'd say the service here is amazing. Must try the wings, they are amazing!! The music is great! And they are open late!!"}
{"text":"Very bad service took a long time to sit. No seats. Gave us a 2 person table for 5 people. But other single or double people got booths and tables for more than can be accommodated. I would give a 0 if possible"}
{"text":"Though my friends suggested I give higher stars, I was not a fan. Overall weird vibe. Played only a couple good songs, but the majority was spanish music. We waited a long time for our order to be taken and waited even longer to get our bowl. They charge you $2 for water but they do have a wider variety of (non-alcoholic) drinks for cheap. The price for the hookah bowl was cheap, $13 for four of us. I might have not gotten the right flavor, Lemon Mint, but it gave me instant hookah head. Would not like to return, but it seems to be the only decent hookah bar around."}
