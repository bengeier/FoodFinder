{"text":"Always consistently great food.  My favorite crab puffs, beef with broccoli and house noodle soup."}

{"text":"I ordered the Sesame Chicken combo and it was to die for! Very friendly staff and great music as well. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"This is the worst Chinese restaurant I have ever been to.  Here is a list of problems:

1.  Too expensive for a hole in the wall.  I ordered two entrees, fried rice, egg rolls and two beverages.  The bill was $32.30
2.  The egg roll was not an egg roll, it looked like a giant size deep fried hot pocket.  
3.  I asked the waitress if we could return the egg roll because it was not what I was expecting. I didn't even have a single bite.   She told me it was already served to me so she wouldn't remove it from the bill.  It was $3.50. It's not like I was asking for some special VIP treatment or asking for my meal to be comped.
4.  To end my dinner, there was a cricket crawling on the wall behind me.  That killed my appetite.  Also the place looked like a dump.  The ceiling looked like it had water damage.  The whole place was trashy looking.  

In conclusion, the food wasn't good, customer service was horrible, and the place is a dump -both inside and out.
EFF this place!!!!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here for over 20 years and I'm 30 lol. This is a family run business that has been around forever. Amazing, authentic Chinese food. House fried rice, sweet and sour pork, hun sieu gai and hot & sour soup are always on the table. Best way to order is family style. We always walk in through the back kitchen and the owner is the only waiter. It's small and a little scary but it's sooooooo yummy. If you want ambiance just think, Chinese food and oldies - sold"}
{"text":"Parent's been coming here since the mid-80's. Place is a hole in the wall but they have great food! We always eat there and have never had any problems."}
{"text":"Im  about to tell you a secret....a BIG Secret...my husband and I have been on a quest for good chinese food since we met....it literally is a hobby. We recently moved out here and friend knew exactly what and where to take us. It started with a backseat ride in my own car because I didnt know the area and already my anxiety was strong because I was not in my own surroundings....we pass a place with a door and the words Chinese Food written on it. \"This cant be it I thought.\" But it was....slowly I get out of the car with my friends and make my way through the door. My husband hesitates opening the door because it felt so uninviting. Finally we walked in and there were about 3 other families eating there. The place was no 5 stars in the environment but I was in it. Anything for the best chinese food. We sat down and my friends exchanged a chuckle to the gal that took our order. \" Your back so soon!\" We ordered family style and when the food came my chinese food dreams came true. It was all good. The rice, the Mongolian beef, the chow mein.....and the best part is the huge egg rolls....a fatty's (I mean foodie's dream.) It was a feast I will always remember....my realization since the last best chinese food experience in Seattle Washington is this ...\"If you feel you shouldn't be there....you should. The best things in life are kept secret for a reason.\""}
{"text":"Visited Phoenix for a family trip and wanted Chinese food close to the airport. I found New Garden, which is a hidden gem for Chinese food. The fried wonton and shrimp with broccoli were notably delicious, and the portions of food were more than sufficient for my family. Excellent service from the waiters as well - would recommend New Garden to anyone in the area!"}
{"text":"I've been eating here for about a year now, and the food has always been awesome. But omg, they changed their regular cooks for some of the best cooks in town. The food and service have never been better. I will always be a loyal New Garden patron if the food stays as delicious as it has been this last week. Yummy."}
{"text":"Went to az for a business trip. Got so hungry and this restaurant filled me up with happiness. The best experience I had in az. Don't like the racist people in Phoenix though."}
{"text":"The outside on the building just says Chinese food but your at the right place! I ordered a lot of food and they don't stuff your food in tiny boxes. I got ALOT of food and it's GOOD. I called ahead and it was a 20 min. Wait which isn't bad if you want your food fresh! I loved everything, definitely stopping here every time I'm by downtown Phoenix.  The only thing I wasn't fond of was my wonton soup, it wasn't bad, just not to my liking. I'm used to lots of veggies and salt in my soups."}
{"text":"Passing by Phoenix on Christmas Day, most of the Chinese restaurants were closed, we don't have many options but pick this resturant for dinner which is closer to our hotel.

We ordered chicken Lou mein, shrimp broccoli, Sesame chicken, pepper beef, chicken chop suey. They all taste good. 2 people of our party prefer spicy food, I would suggest the resturabt to add some spicy flavor dish in their menu.

In general, the physical condition of this resturabt is not attractive, but the taste and the quantity of the food is beyond my expectation. the wait is a little bit long that night, understandable as so many people were eating there. At the end, the food quality earned my 5-star rate. If I live in Pheonix, I would come back often."}
{"text":"Got to say that if I hadn't read the yelp reviews, I would not have gone in this place. The area definately looks sketch, but the food was AMAZING, large portions, great prices. Would recommend to all!! Don't judge a book by the cover"}
{"text":"Really great Chinese food. Loved the hot and sour soup and kung pao chicken and shrimp. Great service too, very quick and attentive."}
{"text":"It's the best Chinese food before you go to the baseball or basketball game.  You gotta try the food since you got nothing to lose by the way. Also you gotta try the natural coffee which they are serving now which has many health benefits. Thank you New Garden Restaurant."}
{"text":"If you are in the downtown Phoenix area you have got to try this place! I highly recommend this Chinese restaurant!! The food and service was amazing. This place is definitely what you would expect out of a \"hole in the wall\" restaurant, very authentic and your meal is cooked fresh. I would recommend you try their egg rolls and their sweet and sour pork or chicken, those are my two favorite, but I have tried other things on the menu and I have never been dissatisfied. The portion you get for what you pay is incomparable. Don't judge the outside and location of this place as you will definitely be happy you tried it."}
{"text":"Still very good and Love the BBQ Pork fried rice! We had orange chicken, spring rolls, huge egg rolls, crab puffs, shrimp egg fun yung and everything was delicious! My dad's favorite Chinese food spot. He brought us here growing up and still very good food. This place has had to be here more than 20 years for a reason."}
{"text":"Unbelievably bad Chinese food.... barely edible.  The most disgusting sweet and sour \"chicken\" I've ever seen.... hard to believe this place stays in business.

The meat is grisley beyond belief and might not even be chicken. No joke.

They couldn't even get simple egg rolls right!

It's in the worst neighborhood in Phoenix and looks like an abandoned building from the out side.

Avoid this shit hole like the literal plague.

Zero stars. I want my 20.00 bucks back."}
{"text":"I grew up eating in little hole in the wall chinese restaurants and I really wanted to like New Garden.  I had driven past the place many times and thought it was abandoned but after looking on Google and seeing some good reviews on Yelp I decided to give the place a try.

The interior matches the exterior,  There were food stains on the wall next to the both I was eating in.  The server laid out our place setting by handling the eating surface of every utensil she put down.  One of the bowls they brought us was dirty too.  

The server never came around to see if we needed anything else but she did decide to drop off more napkins right as we were finishing our meal.  The food isn't bad the prices don't match the service and the questionable cleanliness will make it enough for me to never come back."}
{"text":"This has potential. 5 stars for the people lol. They are so sweet. I walked in and everyone said hello from the kitchen. The gentleman up front let me walk through the kitchen area to my car parked out back.  It was so clean and neat! The food wasn't the best. The crab puffs are my favorite anywhere, and they were light on the filling but still delicious. The egg roll was battered. So to me at least, it retained a bit too much oil. I ordered chow mein pork and chicken teriyaki. Yes, as the other folks state the portions are HUGE, however it was all bean sprouts. Just bean sprouts and sauce and that's it. I will definitely try to return again and order something people rave about but my order just wasn't hitting the spot. I just wish it hit my craving for Chinese food."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! Very clean and awesome food! Have been coming here awhile and will continue  The house chicken is amazing"}
{"text":"Always go with my family, I love it. The employees are friendly and the food is so delicious!"}
{"text":"Life is about decisions, whether they be right or wrong you will ultimately have to make them. I made the decision to try out this chinese restaurant and it was life altering. I will never forget that day. It's like witnessing the birth of your first child. The food was so good that it truly is unexplainable. The food is like your favorite cereal consistently good every time. I love this place and everything about it. You know on black friday when people camp outside to get the good deals on tv's and stuff? I am surprised that their wasn't a string of tents outside of this place.The people are some of the nicest people I have ever met. They are always playing oldies on the radio. Try this place out and you will definitely be a repeat customer."}
{"text":"We ordered the orange chicken and there was too much breading and sauce, tasted mushy. We also ordered the house lo mein noodles and the chicken wasn't seasoned at all, pretty bland. The noodles themselves were ok. We also got fried rice and it had huge chunks of broccoli in it."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this restaurant, but it just didn't do much for me.  The food was under-seasoned.  The kung pao chicken I ordered wasn't spicy at all, and also wasn't that hot, temperature-wise.  Cups weren't all that clean.  Service was indifferent.  Actually, I could easily have overlooked the cups and service if the food had been better, but it just wasn't that good."}
{"text":"I had high expectations of this place due to the reviews on Yelp. However, my actual experience was anything but good.

First, I ordered house chow mein and instead of getting chow mein, I got a box full of bean sprouts and other vegetables with a few shrimp and a little pork sprinkled in, with a separate bag of wonton crisps. There were NO noodles to be found. I was amazed - never have I ever been given chow mein without any actual noodles. 

Second, my boyfriend got house fried rice, which tasted good ....at first. We both found hairs in our portions, short hairs that I don't even want to know where they came from. 

Third, we had the house special chicken, which was the only dish that wasnt terrible. There was more fried flour than chicken meat , but the sauce was good. 

Finally, we were excited to try their massive egg rolls, but they were just 99% bean sprouts. The theme of New Garden seems to be reliance on endless amounts of bean sprouts.

This was a truly disappointing experience. Im not sure if we just ordered the wrong items, but none of the items we ordered met my expectations. I will not be going back."}
{"text":"AUTHENTIC!! The fried shrimp! Is so good. The chicken chop suey is so good and juicy. The area is a little creepy. But like they say don't judge a book by its cover. You go in thru the kitchen and prices are very reasonable portions are very generous. The only think I don't care for is there are no fountain drinks. It's a cold soda can for a $1."}
{"text":"Just not good.

This was my first time dining at at New Garden Restaurant.  My lunch companion and I both selected the pork chop suey lunch special,  consisted of egg drop soup, pork chop suey, fried rice, egg roll, and a spare rib. 

The egg drop soup was excellent but the crispy noodles served with the soup were oily and the dipping sauce much too sweet for my taste.  The pork chop suey was rather ordinary and very bland. I chose brown rice in lieu of fried rice and the rice was just okay. I really didn't care for the barbecued spareribs it was somewhat dry and the meat was tough to eat. The egg rolls at New Garden Restaurant are very large however, there's not much filling inside and the eggrolls are very greasy. Overall just not good food.

I'd like to end on a positive note. The service at New Garden Restaurant is outstanding. The staff is friendly and inviting and will explain everything on their menu.  The prices and serving portions can't be beat.  I just wish the food was a better quality."}
{"text":"Fantastic service!
Delicious food!
Excellent prices!
Massive portions!

This is a great case of 'Don't judge a book by its cover'"}
{"text":"Great hole in the wall Chinese restaurant.....got my fix for chinese food....been going here for years n still great place to eat."}
{"text":"Very good egg foo young! The fried rice is fantastic, worth the drive. Located south of Van Buren in the central phoenix area. One of the better Chinese food neighborhood places to eat at, not at all fancy but good. Don't expect a high end fancy place, you will be disappointed. Go for the food not the aesthetics. Enjoy..."}
{"text":"I would definitely go back for the egg rolls but the rest of my food just not that good. I ordered the shrimp egg foo young the sauce was watery and the egg foo was falling apart not good at all I gave it away when I got back work and no chicken wings. The old school music playing was great. ill go back but I will try something else the egg rolls where unique and one of a kind will"}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch today.  We were intrigued by the \"Chinese Food\" sign on the building.  We ordered orange chicken and mongolian beef.  Both were better than we expected.  Service was fast, and we never had to wait for refills.  The only reason we didn't give 5 stars is because their soda is purchased by the can."}
{"text":"Grew up eating this! We walk right through the back door. Dont come here if your looking for atmosphere.Its all about the hot, fresh crispy food. Looove the pork fried rice, sesame chicken, ice tea and those big ass deliciously fried egg rolls! The oldies playing in the back deffinatley sets the mood. Family music right there. This place is love."}
{"text":"Excellent food, Huge Portions! I had the Kung Pao two combo. $8.95. I am stuffed. I make it a point to try the places where the Police eat because as a rule, the food is very good and inexpensive. A Must if you crave Chinese in Central Phoenix area. Don't Judge a book by its cover."}
{"text":"This place has been around for a long time (at least 30 years).  Apparently it used to be quite a popular hang out for certain circles back in the day, and many locals still regularly visit.  The location is in a small nondescript building on the corner.  You can enter through the front door or through the back door from the parking lot and walk through the kitchen (somewhat odd, but ok..).  The dining area is a small wood panel lined room with only a single tiny half window.  You are definitely not here to enjoy the atmosphere.  The menu choice is a bit limited. I tried the egg flower soup (yummy), pork fried rice (good), mongolian beef (not bad), and shrimp chop suey (not bad).  It was basic fast food chinese fare, good but not great.  Also soft drinks only come in cans. The food certainly did not impress, nor did anything else really.  On my own, I probably would not return here, however, my friend is one of those locals I referred to above so I'm sure I will be back.  The owners are very friendly as well."}
{"text":"Pretty dang good hole in the wall restaurant! You get a lot for your money... been here twice. Will come back soon"}
{"text":"My favorite Chinese since childhood.  Use to live really close by at central park and this was our special restaurant.  The flavors haven' changed.

The egg roll is huge and lightly crisp filled with bean sprouts chicken and  other veggies.  The sauces are all really good.  Love the teriyaki chicken, recommend a spicy shrimp with broccoli which is a white sauce not the dark you normally get with beef.  BBQ Pork is a little hard, not always my favorite, but I'll eat it if it comes with my meal. Fried rice is all good, no matter the meat.  My favorite is the chop suey.

The restaurant is on the corner and you normally walk in through the back.  The inside is spacious and normally some oldies are playing.  Owners are super nice and you can always count on good consistent food.  I have never had any issues with my order, parking or anything else.  Be prepared to take home leftovers, unless you only get one plate for 3-4 people!

They're closed on Wednesdays."}
{"text":"I have been eating here for years,  noticed the new cooks they said they are all related. The food was great but taste different.  Love this spot"}
{"text":"A bit disappointed.  The online menu says that hey have Sizzling Rice Soup - it's  not true.  

As another writer noted, don't judge a book by it's cover.  This is what appears to be a seedy run down building in a not too nice industrial area of town.  The place doesn't even have windows!  

Service was ok.  The food we ate was pretty good though - I'd say above average for Chinese food.  Rating it a three however as they shouldn't post inaccurate or outdated menu information - and in our case, we went specifically for the soup."}
{"text":"This is one of the places that introduced americanized chinse food to Phoenix. They have been around since i think 1946 is what i was told. They have the basics and more . Well know for there huge servings and burrito size eggrolls which is 2 for 3.50 about the same as getting 6 somewhere else in size. We always get SS chicken and pork fried rice with the GOODIES (green inion and bean sprout added) hung sui gai , house chow mein, and egg flour soup. We alwats end up with more then we can eat and boxes to go. Service is good they changed over ownership but only as a partnership and things stay as good or better. Our chinese food spot when up town."}
{"text":"A rundown red building on the corner, and you wonder to yourself \"Is that it?\" And sure enough, yes it is. 

We went around to the back trying to find parking, and went through the fence opening to the small parking lot in the back. There is one door, and we weren't sure if we could enter and peeked in. 

It was the kitchen. 

We back out and started to walk around the building, but a very sweet woman came after us and invited us in. 

We were led through the kitchen and into the restaurant to wait. The restaurant is definitely run down, but don't let it fool you. 

The food is fantastic. 

We ordered the Mongolian beef, House special chicken, crab puffs and some egg drop soup. And they gave us some free spring rolls on the side! 

The Mongolian beef is perfectly spicy! Just delicious, and such generous portions! The house special chicken was perfect. Not overly sauced so it stayed nice and crunchy, perfectly cooked. The spring rolls were a definite surprise. It has a little hint of ginger and is so yummy. 

My only critique is that the crab puffs were cheap in the cream cheese, but that's okay bc I don't need those calories anyway. Hahahaha. 

Definitely give this place a shot. It doesn't look like much from the outside but it's food speaks for itself. My husband and I are sold."}
{"text":"The service is good and fast.  The food is good and large portions. Had the Orange Chicken, Beef Chow Mein, and Kung Pao Chicken, all good. Will go back soon to try more on their menu."}
{"text":"This place is a gem. Opened in 1945!! Probably making it one of oldest running Chinese restaurant in Arizona. The service is amazing, it is clean and the portions are huge!! I want all of phx to know that this great place is right around the corner and is a must try!"}
{"text":"I gave this place a chance but was very disappointed. It's a block building with a couple of small glass block windows you can't even see out of. I thought the food would be better. It seemed like the egg rolls were some type of signature dish at the restaurant. They were hard with no flavor. I had the chicken and shrimp kung pao plate. They gave me fatty dark meat and milky white uncooked shrimp. I didn't eat the shrimp and only small pieces of the dark meat chicken. None of the chicken tasted fresh so I only ate a couple pieces of chicken. I had water with lemon but the water tasted like tap water, not even filtered. The plate was $10. I should of at least got white meat instead of dark for that price. I will not be going back."}
{"text":"Customer service or anything doesn't really stand out for me. But the food does! It's hard to find a really good Chinese place here and this place has delicious Chinese food as well as a good deal. You get really big portions for the price that you pay. I will get the dinner orders and have leftovers for days.."}
