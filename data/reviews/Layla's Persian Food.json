{"text":"Wow, truly a fantastic experience! Layla is real, joyful, and genuinely friendly & openhearted. I wasn't expecting such exquisite food for such a simple place, but it always seems to go that way. It's true what they say, that Layla's feels like eating with family--truly in the best possible way. By the way, it's very inexpensive for a good meal!"}
{"text":"I went here with a friend and I think this place is amazing in practically every way.  To start they are in the cutest location.  Layla has taken a low ceilinged basement place and turned it into a very cozy, beautiful space.  There are all sorts of pretty, middle-easternesque decorations and during the day the sun just lights the whole restaurant up.  One of the first things my friend and I noticed was that they have saffron for sale, which I though was charming.  We started with a tea and coffee which were both extremely delicious.  The menu is short and I can't remember the names of the dishes we ordered but they were both VERY well made and inexpensive ($8 entr√©es).  One was a lamb,kidney beans, and greens dish and the other was a sweet pressed, crispy rice and yoghurt plate.  We ended the meal with small squares of baklava ($1 each!) which were delicious and not too sweet.  The service, although not the fastest (they weren't too slow either though), was super friendly as well.  This is just a wonderful restaurant and I wholeheartedly recommend checking it out!"}
{"text":"I have to agree with Luther. It is impossible to ever get to this restaurant when it is actually open. It is close to where I live/work and I have tried to meet friends there for dinner and it is never open.  I see the owners did finally update the hours on Yelp to show it is only open for lunch M-F but even this week the hours seemed wrong. Did the restaurant already close after a month? Not surprised.   I did get there one time for lunch so I actually can comment on the food. I was not very impressed. All of the dishes sounded like they would be great but between our table of three people we all left feeling underwhelmed and like we had been served leftovers.   We would normally give a restaurant, especially a new one, a second chance but considering we had to try too hard to actually eat there we will save our energy and our money for another, more deserving restaurant."}
{"text":"Yummy food, and very friendly staff. The service was quick, and they were willing to help choose good vegan options."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite food in Madison. Layla is just amazing and her place couldn't be homier and better value for your money. If they served her food at L'Etoile, I'd be fine paying their prices for this quality food. Always amazing flavors and seasonings. I want to see her succeed even though it pains me to think her place will need to grow.  If you care about cozy atmosphere and stellar food, go here."}
{"text":"Going here is like having a home cooked meal in a friend's home. It's a low-key spot with great food and lots of character. I usually get one of the stews, either vegetarian, lamb, or chicken. The flavors are complex and you can tell the stews are slow-cooked for hours. Layla is hilarious and lends laughter to the cozy space. I leave here with a smile on my face, and the generous portions often leave me enough for leftovers!"}
{"text":"We love Layla's (and Laila), we just wished we lived closer. Layla's catered our rehearsal dinner for over 60 people and the food was incredible! My new in-laws are Persian, and my family is from Wisconsin, so I was a little nervous about striking a balance between authentic and familiar (because that's how my family can be). Laila did not disappoint! She suggested fesenjoon since it's a traditional wedding stew, and both families gave rave reviews. It was served with rice, salad (very veggie, fresh and flavorful), and her not-so-sticky-it-hurts baklavah. We visited the restaurant on another occasion to sample different dishes and the other reviewers are spot on - her food is always fresh and incredibly delicious. And the location is such a cool spot."}
{"text":"We were  at Laylas last night for the first time and our food was excellent, the 3 of us really enjoyed it!"}
{"text":"I can't actually rate the food as we were never seated. First of all, the tiny restaurant was dirty and unkempt. Second, there was one other guest waiting to be seated, obviously for some time. No one else was in the restaurant dining.   There seemed to be only one employee there. She certainly saw us waiting to be seated, but after 5 minutes of her indifference, we left as did the other lone potential diner.   This was an annoying experience, and I won't go back, nor would I ever recommend Layla's."}
{"text":"The food here is fantastic. I have been going here for just about a year and just now managed to get around to writing a review. The Khoresh e Ghemeh Bademjan is amazing not to mention gluten free and as long as you let them know to forgo the yogurt sauce it is even vegan.  Chicken and lamb represents itself on the menu in a variety of ways. In my opinion the best is the Fesenjoon, a slow cooked walnut and pomegranate stew of sorts which is sweet, savory and just a little tangy. Last of all don't forget to finish the meal with baklava. This crumbly and sweet bar of nuts and filo dough is the perfect way to end a great dining experience. They should ask who doesn't want baklava instead of who does."}
{"text":"Great food and and a great price. Will be back regularly. The lamb kabob was excellent."}
{"text":"Eating at Layla's is a great experience. She's a one-woman shop and, wow, can she cook.  We got there later in the evening and she was sold out of two entrees: the vegetarian option and a lamb dish.  Layla recommended the chicken and it was delicious; as was the cucumber/pepper/tomato salad and the out-of-this-world baklava!   The baklava is a must-order.  We highly recommend Layla's... not only for the food, but the entire experience.   It felt like we were eating a romantic dinner at an old friend's house! Dinner hours are not regular at this point so be sure to check out the Facebook page."}
{"text":"First of all, the hours are wrong on Yelp and it costs $$ to change it! So, she is open on Saturday at 5:00 pm to 9:00pm, but when we showed up at 4, she totally took us in and cooked up some amazing food for us! I forgot to take pictures, but we got the Persian fried chicken, vegan Abgoosht, and vegetarian TaCheen. Served with lentil soup or veggie salad, and the garlicky yogurt is so satisfying. Everyone very happy and very full! Visit if you are anywhere near, it is fabulous!"}
{"text":"Lovely place to sit in a sidewalk restaurant with excellent food. The service is personal and very pleasant. My new favorite place to go in Madison!!"}
{"text":"Small menu, great stuff. I went in to grab something to take back to the office for a working lunch.   The proprietor is easy-going and extremely friendly. I ordered vegetarian, but she was out of that item. Instead of letting me walk away disappointed, she went in the kitchen and improvised something for me. It wound up being delicious. I can't think of another place in town that would do that for a first-time customer. I joined Yelp for the sole purpose of giving her a good review."}
{"text":"My friend brought me to Layla's last night and it was such a treat. It felt like I was walking into my grandmothers kitchen with warm smells of latkes and tea. We feasted on unlimited latkes, soup and salad, all of which were delicious (and a super reasonable price). Layla also specially made latke sauces to meet our dietary restrictions...and they were all delicious!!! Layla spent time chatting with us when possible and is sassy and super fun. I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"The food is good! I just hope they're becoming more consistent with the hours. Very reasonably priced, delicious Iranian food!"}
{"text":"Layla's is a fantastic spot to hit. It is great for gluten-free folks too. We brought two little kids with us. She has one booster seat for a child so that was great. She made our 2 year old a plate with eggs, rice, and some yogurt for only $2.  We went there for dinner and ordered two different lamb dishes, both were excellent. She was chatty and friendly and I really enjoyed the decor of her restaurant. Her facebook page will often announce if she's open on weekend nights."}
{"text":"Food was awful.  I had the mutton which they called lamb stew. It was not good. Also had lentil soup--it was really black eyed bean soup.  Spent two days burping mutton.  We live in Montana and know the difference between lamb and mutton (mutton is very mature sheep!). Reviews all say good, but not when we were there."}
{"text":"Layla's. comfort food. non-pretentious.  Layla - sassy. real. amazing cook!  I was really surprised how small Layla's place is. It totally looks like we are in her kitchen. There's probably 2 larger tables (4-5 people) and 2 smaller ones for (2-3 people). Out of the few times I've visited, Layla is usually the only one there, serving, and cooking (WHAT?!).  So, if you're looking for fast, go elsewhere. And Layla's not afraid to tell you, if you can't wait, please go elsewhere.  But boy oh boy, you're in for a treat if you wait! (Honestly, it's not even as long as waiting at some of the busier places in town.. Usually get our food in half an hour).   What to get? Kubideh - minced beef/lamb kabobs. Layla doesn't like to make them. But my boy loves them so much, he gets them everytime! Chicken kabobs - so juicy and flavorful. so so delicious. I love the yoghurt sauce. with purple seasoning (what is that?!) Baked rice - the crispy bits are so good!! Eggplant - so good!! It is a little salty at times. but i love how substantial the dish is  And, don't ever ever leave without Baklava. It is so delightful, I must tell you I picked it up from the floor after I dropped it to finish it up. I love how it is not just overwhelmed with sweetness, but instead it is filled with nuts. and a flaky layers. loves!  Thank you Layla, for taking time and sharing your love for food with Madisonians. You're awesome!"}
{"text":"My nephew asked if I wanted to try Persian place for lunch so glad I said yes. We got a chicken dish marinated in lime yogurt then fried tender crisp with creamy dipping sauce and rice, a shrimp stew and a vegetarian dish, all served with tomato salad. Lunch was $9, cash only."}
{"text":"As other's have mentioned, this is a one-woman shop, so the service isn't quite as snappy as it could be. However, when I went last Saturday night with a group of 4, everyone was happy with their food and we had good time. My meal, the Gormeh Sabzi, a type of lamb stew over rice was probably the best of all - great flavor, super tender pieces of lamb. Mmmm."}
{"text":"We sat outside at Laylas, full sunshine, faint breeze. The koresh bademjan and chicken with walnuts and pomegranate sauce were delicious, with a beautiful saffron and white rice pilaf. For dessert : mint tea served in Layla's grandmother's own tea glasses , with dates and baklava. Delicious food, and we didn't even get to try the Dolmeh Bademjan.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Amazing hidden gem. What the place lacks in ambiance they make up with incredible and unique food. Vegan friendly."}
{"text":"Great little gem to have in Madison. Great options for vegetarians and gluten free meals! Had the tacheen which is a baked rice dish with yoghurt, raisins with toasted eggplants! Outside seating also available, great place for a relaxing night of healthy, hearty foods!"}
{"text":"We tried Layla's for lunch one Saturday afternoon. The restaurants is located in the basement of a hostel. There was a sign at the corner of the street indicating which way to head, but not much in the way of signage to indicate the actual location. The restaurant utilizes six tables and a hodgepodge of chairs, dishes, cutlery, and decor. A very eclectic, quirky ambiance.  Layla told us to seat ourselves where ever we wanted and then brought us water and menus. The menu consists of about eight entrees served with soup or salad and an optional dessert. We all started with the cup of soup which was lentil based with unusual flavors. Fenugreek maybe? Tarragon maybe? We weren't really sure. Our entrees included a lamb, greens, and rice based dish, a pulled chicken and rice dish, and a beautiful crusty rice and cherry based dish. All of the dishes were tasty with spices and herbs we didn't recognize.  For dessert we all tried the baklava which was had great flavors. Layla told us, she was not satisfied with the dessert and didn't charge us for it, but we all thought the flavors were delicious. Layla was a delightful hostess and fun to chat with.  I think the location and atmosphere may turn off some guests, but the food was fun to try and Layla was wonderful to meet. The prices were very reasonable. Entrees were all $8 and the the baklava is only $1 each."}
{"text":"Excellent home cooked Persian food!! I'm really glad I found this family owned gem. Layla owns and runs the cozy restaurant herself. She also hosts authentic cuisines made by women of other cultures, money goes to an amazing cause. I am really impressed with her philosophy and purpose in life. Will definitely visit again when I'm in Madison."}
{"text":"Layla is a great owner and extremely friendly but Unfortunately the food is not very good. I love the fact that her menu is not the typical food you can find in every other Persian restaurant."}
{"text":"Really friendly hostess, subpar food. Not a very clean looking place. The food was bland...the utensils look dirty...I got sick afterwards."}
{"text":"A little hidden gem near the State Capitol.   Layla's only serves lunch. We came around this place at 1pm and there was only 3 entrees left. So, arrive early if you have specific items to try out. Entrees are pre-cooked and come with basmati rice and salad/soup, so you can get food very quickly once you sit down.   Layla's is located in the half-basement of a hostel on Butler st. Kinda a hole in the wall place. But I usually care very little but the decor of a restaurant. Layla's also feels magical. I thought i was suddenly jumped to a backpacker's home somewhere far far away from Madison.   We had Ghormeh sabzi (lamb slow cooked with greens and beans) and Fesenjoon (Chicken cooked in walnut pomegranate sauce). I have close to zero knowledge on Persian food, but i really like my food! $8 each for a lunch meal, seems to me very reasonable for what i got. Cash only."}
{"text":"The people at this place are SOOOO funky cool! I've wanted to go here for a while (I love that it's \"in\" a hostel, too), and I was not disappointed. I don't know what \"typical\" Persian food is, but their small menu had a lot of great options if you like trying new things. We went at an odd time of day, but I don't think it gets crazy busy. The prices are reasonable, it's very laid back, and I can't wait to go again."}
{"text":"Totally feels like you walked into someone's kitchen/dining room...BUT, in the best way possible.   Short menu with interesting options including meat and vegetarian options. We had some great lentil soup and spied a neighboring table's tomato salad, which also looked quite good (dinners come with option of soup or salad).  Most notable was the baklava...not too sweet, loaded with nuts, and a very generous portion for only a dollar (!!). It's been a couple weeks, and I am still thinking about it.  As other reviews mention, Layla is core to the dining experience here. She introduced herself, made small talk, cracked some jokes, and told us all about the menu, sourcing of products, etc, then went back into the kitchen to make up our food. We appreciated her level of engagement, and what she is trying to do here. Madison's dining scene is robust, but the whole experience here is quite unique."}
{"text":"Amazing. Layla is a very fun host, and the food is great. What more can you ask for?  I had a lamb kabob and, since I don't eat rice, Layla was kind to replace that with a large salad that was equally tasty. Balanced seasoning in the meat, and a refreshing salad with just the right amount of dressing. Everything was fresh, the meat was hot, and the service was witty."}
{"text":"Layla's has a very homey cozy vibe and the food tastes delicious as well as healthy and feels very \"homemade\". It seemed like the owner was doing everything- cooking, waiting, etc. so we weren't sure if service would be slow but really it was quite fast and she was funny and friendly. Not too expensive, and great quality food. Also you have to try the baklava- it's not overly sweet but just buttery and nutty. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here and really enjoyed the food. Yes, it's an awkward/small location in a basement, but it's worth stopping by for a reasonably priced $9 lunch with persian flavors that are hard to find in this part of town. Menu changes often - so be prepared for a surprise. Both the lamb shank and the veggie stew options were great when I was in."}
{"text":"Had the fish boil tonight to compliment the event on Monona Terrace. What a treat. Will be back with family for some Persian."}
{"text":"Welcome to the only outpost in town where the chef is also the waitress, table buster, and owner.  In spite of this wearing of multiple hats, it actually works.   The Persian stews are amazing - gormeh sabzi, fessenjon (our favorite) - and koobideh (kabbob).   We've also recently tried the Saturday brunch menu and that was delicious. I certainly hope Layla's stays in business because it's a much needed addition to Madison's Middle Eastern food selection.   Layla has typically been responsive on her facebook fanpage, and also takes requests for certain special occasions.  Here's an old review in the Isthmus were we learned about her restaurant: http://m.host.madison.com/entertainment/dining/restaurant-news-layla-s-persian-food-opens-in-old-cafe/article_14d28a1c-de08-506e-889b-638688c4c778.html?mobile_touch=true."}
{"text":"Layla's is probably one of the best things that I just happened to stumble upon, and it's funny considering how I only just noticed it a few days ago given how many times I walked past the spot. From my experience, it's an amazing lunch spot. It has a very easy going atmosphere, as the space is just a couple rooms in the lower floor of a building, and since the place rarely has more than a few other people in it, it's very quiet. In some settings this can be off putting, but around the Capitol it's a pleasant rarity to find a place so peaceful. Also, Layla (I think it was Layla at least) is the cook and server, and she's very sociable, and makes you feel welcome in her space.  In terms of food, it hits the spot in many ways. I ordered one of their stews (all of which can be made vegan, for those with diet restrictions), and it was a perfect lunch. The stew I ordered was a pomegranate walnut sauce, with butternut squash (vegan version only), and it was delicious with the side of rice. The salad you can get beforehand may be basic, but it's very yummy for what it is. Finally, GET THE BAKLAVA. It'll melt right in your mouth and make you go mmmmmmm. My entire meal was merely $9 as well, and it was well worth every cent.  The only con to Layla's I can think of are the hours. It's only open for lunch on weekdays, so pretty much anyone who doesn't work right in downtown won't have the chance to experience it. I'm sure it would do fine business on weekends, so Layla should consider having it open then. But if you can go to Layla's, then you definitely should!"}
{"text":"We got to sit outside, which was an unexpected blessing in early March. I would have loved the experience based on that alone, but it was so much more than that.   The small restaurant seemed to be run by one woman, who cooks, serves and makes all of her guests feel welcome. The somewhat small menu made it easier to choose two meals to share. The meatballs served were part of a special menu for a MACN collaboration and they were spectacular. My friend preferred these, but my favorite was the fesenjoon. It was so hearty and flavorful!   I loved the full experience and would fully recommend checking out this small, off-the-beaten-path gem."}
{"text":"I want to give this place a higher score, but there were some things that I really thought detracted from the experience.  First off, just be aware that the place is small and there's only one person working there. I went with three other friends for Easter brunch and it was fairly busy. The place is nice and cozy, but probably only has about 5 tables in all.  Layla was really cool. She's sarcastic and interesting, and made me feel like I was hanging out with a friend at her place.   On to the food: I got a lamb sausage quiche and my friend got a beef brisket. Both were delicious but dear god this woman goes hard with the salt. I'll be the first to admit that I put salt on everything, but even I was shocked by how salty everything was. Almost to the point were it was inedible. Additionally, my quiche was barely warm which surprised me since I thought she was making it then and there.   Aside from that, the food also took about 30 mins or so to get out to us, so if you're looking for a quick meal this is NOT the place. I'm glad we got there early because the people that came after us were just sitting around waiting to get their water for like 15 mins. I realize this is one of the downsides of having a place owned and operated by a single person, and if you're coming here you should keep that in mind.   We got some baklava after our meal and it was delicious. No complaints there.  Overall, the place was an interesting experience. I liked the ambiance and Layla is great, but I didn't appreciate the amount of time I had to wait, the insane amount of salt in the food, and the fact that my food was cold. I'd definitely go back again because despite all that it was delicious."}
{"text":"Food is nothing resembling persian food. It isn't good and the place is really run down.  We arrived at this tiny place in a building's basement. It has about 4 or 5 tables and can seat about 12-15 people max. We ordered Tah Chin and Ghormeh Sabzi from a menu that has only about 8 main dishes. The Tah Chin didn't at all resemble anything I have eaten in Iran and was 12 dollar a person. The hostess, waitress, cook and dishwasher is the same woman and the service is really slow. Save your money and go some place else."}
{"text":"Best bang for your buck in Wisconsin! Five star quality food with great service and a very homie atmosphere. Would recommend to anyone and everyone. The Persian fried chicken is great for the less adventurous and my personal favorite is the Tahchin. Not a lot of entrees on the menu, but it won't disappoint. It's not your typical restaurant, because it's better."}
{"text":"This space has been through a lot of restaurants. It's a hole in the wall and you need to walk into an area that is not much larger than a window well to get there. However, I've always considered the spot rather magical, and these owners have worked to make it seem cozy. It is warm and welcoming.  The food. For $8, I got a lunch plate with chicken on a skewer. This was the star of the show. It was incredibly moist and falling apart as I removed it from the stick. The yogurt sauce was a nice compliment to the basamati rice (I belive it had saffron in it as well) and the long roasted banana pepper was a nice touch. To start, I received a crunch collection of peppers, cucumbers, etc. in a zingy vinaigrette.   If you like small spaces with pizazz and the sound of your meal sizzling soon after your order, Layla's is worth a visit. Nice, friendly owners and excellent service."}
{"text":"FRIEND: We're at Layla's!  FRIEND'S MOM: Where's that?! FRIEND: Butler. COREY: Tell her it's been here for a year. FRIEND: It's been here for like a year! FRIEND'S MOM: (upon arrival) OBSURE!   That's the conversation a friend had this past weekend on the phone with her mom when we went to celebrate Layla's one year anniversary in a wee little basement on Butler down the way from The Bayou. Yes, it's obscure. Yes, the hours are limited. But what she lacks in square footage and open hours, she more than makes up for in flavor and friendliness.   I knew when Layla sat down to talk to us about how to make her insanely delicious spicy eggplant spread that came with the appropriately named starter, \"Breads & Spreads\" we were in good hands! Despite the fact that she had a few other tables outside and in doors at her quaint space, she was excited to chat about the ingredients and the process she uses to roast her eggplant, she even grabbed one from the kitchen to show me what it looks like so when I attempt to replicate the spread at home, I'll know what I'm looking for.  Layla's will also forever be emblazoned in my mind as the first place I ever ate a whole trout. Like I'm talking here's your foil wrapped trout. With bones. And eyes. Fins too. I was a little put off at first, but once I stuck my fork in Jacques (that's what we decided to call him) none of that mattered... it was DELICIOUS. Probably some of the best cooked fish I've had in a long while.   The fresh tomato and cucumber salad was also delicious, and we have the abundant Dane County Farmer's Market to thank for that. In addition to a few local purveyors where Layla sources some meats, she hits up the market most Saturdays to pick up ripe produce to use in a menu of about 13 dishes. There's lamb, chicken, beef, Jacques the fish, and a smattering of vegetarian options as well.   Don't leave without having a piece of Persian baklava, which isn't as cloyingly sweet as it's distant Greek counterpart.   Everything about the evening was absolutely perfect except the fact that this was a fluke and Layla's isn't open evenings. She made it sound like once the demand is there, she'll extend her hours, so go give it a try during lunch, tell a few friends, and let's collectively try to get her to test out just weekends!"}
{"text":"Entr√©es are $12 now but well worth it. No alcohol on the menu, but BYOB would probably be acceptable. Small place with great food, very pleasant service."}
{"text":"#1 thing to know: you are in Layla's kitchen. With less than 10 seats and all food and service by Layla, it's real Jewish & Persian cooking.  The short menu has about 4 every entrees, from about $12-14 and specials are on the FB page.  I arrived on a mission for the ghormeh sabzi, which you can aliken to the Iranian national dish.  Lentil soup is accented with cooked celery, a little more than I favor, but very good.  As for the main dish, the herb&lamb stew with rice met my expectations.  Lots of cooked parsley, lime to cut through the herby flavor, red beans, and lamb chunks.  Persian home cooking!  The baklava is an excellent value--a large diamond with both almonds, and pistachio.  Most importantly, you will get to know Layla if you enter Layla's house of Persian food,  Get ready for conversation and heartwarming meals!"}
{"text":"This is a great spot for lunch if you are downtown. They have vegan and vegetarian options. I had the vegan stew which was delicious. The menu is seasonal so everything tastes fresh. Everyone really enjoyed what they ordered, with the ultimate favorite being the baklava so save room for it!"}
{"text":"This is a cute little place located under the international student hostel, very easy to find. Find yourselves a table and get comfortable, as Layla runs a one man army of cooking, cleaning and waiting on tables...she is pretty much always occupied. Me and the wife ordered the persian tea, Tacheen and Fesenjoon. Layla managed to get our order within no time even with a full house. Not much impressed with the persian tea but the Tacheen and Fesenjoon were quite a catch. It was not the best food that I have tasted but it was fresh, personal and Layla certainly gave a home cooked meal touch to it."}
{"text":"Layla's is great and affordable. It's the perfect spot for lunch if you work by the Capitol and want to sit outdoors."}
{"text":"The food was ok, not the best for sure. Also some dishes were dirty (i.e: greasy water glasses)"}
{"text":"I ate there for lunch based of a recommendation from a coworker and it was very good.  I got a grass fed lamb dish (can't remember the name) that has cilantro and it was quite tasty.  I really wanted the Baklava, but the owner mentioned that it didn't turn out well so she didn't want to sell a project she thought was inferior to her standards.  She did however give me a piece at no cost and offered to give me a free piece on my next visit.  Talk about great service!  Even though it wasn't to her standards it wasn't that bad.  I'm looking forward to trying it when it is up to her standards."}
