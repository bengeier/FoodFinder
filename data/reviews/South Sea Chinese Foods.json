{"text":"My go-to chinese restaurant on the Danforth. Ordered their curry chicken and basil vegetables - lots of flavour and not overly oily. Staff engaged in friendly conversation during the wait."}
{"text":"Ok before I start it's not that this place is bad but I've had a lot of Chinese food in my life time and it just didn't meet those standards of Chinese food I expect. When I order Chinese food I like big portions so the next day I can enjoy the leftovers. My brother and I ordered 4 dishes and the portions weren't the greatest for the price we paid. Food wasn't bad but wasn't great either. It's questionable whether or not we'll order from here again.
So far there's only one Chinese food place in the area I've found has reasonable prices and good portions. I'm not going to name it here because that would be pretty bad. It's an ongoing process trying to find the best food for a good price.  I haven't tried their combination plates which I'm willing to try and see if I like those better.  
To be fair it was our first time ordering takeout from here and maybe it's better than what we experienced.
If we try it again and it's better I will edit this review.
Thank you!"}
{"text":"Plain old fashion westernized chinese food. All the usual suspects. Average prices. Vegetarian options. Licensed. 

Interior is quaint, clean (although the bathrooms albeit renovated could use a bit of a scrub).

Visa, Debit, Cash."}
{"text":"My family has been ordering Chinese from this place since I was born.  Recently moved to Greenwood & Danforth area, but this can only mean better.  This place made Chinese our comfort food.  They need a website though."}
{"text":"Ordered take-out from here the other night after a friend who lives in the area had recommended it.  Staff are very friendly and the my order was ready within 20-minutes.  Because I had take-out, I obviously didn't stay in but by the looks of the place, it's very well maintained, clean and casual. 

Because I'm a Libra and was getting indecisive with what to order, I ordered their Treasure Box which consisted of (4) chicken balls, (4) chicken wings, (4) BBQ ribs and (4) breaded shrimp.  

Chicken Balls - I don't know what it is about chicken balls but it's something I need to have whenever I have Chinese food.  The batter-chicken ratio was pretty average as well as the sweet and sour sauce.  Was also a little on the crunchy side which I actually enjoyed. 4/5 stars.

Chicken Wings - Was lightly battered thus making it quite greasy.  Was also pretty average with taste but because it was on the greasier side, I'd rate it 3.5/5.  Plus the size wasn't too big.

BBQ Ribs - Marinade was quite nice and the meat just fell off the bone.  Also had a little bit of fat which gave it a nice flavor.  Because of its tenderness and flavour, I rate this 5/5.

Breaded Shrimp - Though it was nicely fried, I found that it had way too much batter.  I'm guessing this was double dipped in the batter to hide the fact that the shrimp used weren't all that big (pun intended).  However, the bits of shrimp that I did get was good especially with their sweet and sour sauce. 4/5. 

Along with the Treasure Box, I ordered Chicken Fried Rice and Cantonese Chow Mein.

Chicken Fried Rice - Was perfectly seasoned and had a good amount of cubed chicken.  You can tell that they don't use MSG here because I wasn't as parched afterwards nor did I feel like I was waking up in the middle of a desert with a dry mouth. 5/5.

Cantonese Chow Mein - Very generous with their vegetables though I personally would've loved to have gotten more protein (had chicken and shrimp).  Was pretty average in taste though I liked how the noodles were a little crunchy.  Had just the right amount of sauce, in my opinion.  4/5."}
{"text":"Very rude on the phone
Argue even when they get the order wrong
Arrogant, entitled and abusive
The website says open until midnight; if you phone after 11, 
3 times they said it's for pick-up only.
When we came home early from work to order before 11
the food came salty and slimy with cornstarch-like sauce
The chicken wings are heavily breaded in a  sweet dough which is not the usual way Chinese restaurant do \"crispy\" chicken wings.
The shrimp still had veins in them - we could make our own and de-vein them at home before cooking if we didn't want to pay a restaurant to do this...
There is a lot of dough around the chicken in the chicken balls - the meat is white meat though.
The black bean sauce has hardly any black beans in it and it bland and salty. 
The fried rice is just plain white rice with frozen vegetables and a little soy sauce; there is plenty of it though.
Styrofoam containers are not good to use for delivery, especially when they've melted from the heat. The food does come quite warm. 
It's hit and miss as to order accuracy. We're tired of putting good money after bad and taking a chance because when they do miss something they'll only yell at you on the phone when you point this out."}
{"text":"I went here on a reccomendation from a friend who also lives in the neighbourhood. I was excited to see that they have cheap combination specials available all day. It was after midnight when I went and there were still specials to be had. The interior is nicer than the bingo-hall looking chinese places but not fine dining. Nice, clean, casual. It took less than five minutes to get my food. It was delicious. Generous servings of rice and chicken. The egg roll filling seemed a little odd to me, but it tasted ok. The place also has some Thai dishes on the menu. I can see this one becoming a regular."}
{"text":"South Sea is exactly what you expect and hope for in a North Americanized Chinese restaurant. All of the similar items are there on the menu. Though the General Tao chicken I'd say is above average. The chicken was moist and it wasn't tuff or overcooked. The Cantonese Chow Mein noodles had some crispness and weren't overly sauced. The tofu and vegetables seemed to have a hint of lemon. Overall the food tastes very clean and light compared to other Chinese restaurants with the same dishes. It's definitely not as  salty as other places I've experienced and I don't feel like I was hit by a truck of MSG.

Bonus points for also having reasonably priced combo plates. Which I have yet to try as we got take out. The delivery also arrived when they said it would and the food was nice and hot. Great to have a go to Chinese restaurant in the area."}
{"text":"Went in here for lunch with a couple friends. The prices were the same as another restaurant we go to so we decided to try it out. The inside doesn't have very good lighting at all. I got a plate of rice with an egg roll and breaded shrimp. 
The rice was completely bland but was covered in the sauce. the breaded shrimp had no flavour and all that I tasted was the bread around it. I never got to go through all the eggroll because the over powering taste of oil overwhelmed me. 
I ended up getting my food to go, but I didn't have much in the box anyway so I don't understand why it took so long. Overall this place is a disappointment and I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Are you serious? Sure, cheap quality chinese food, you get what you pay for but... it's super sketchy in here. Definitely shady... don't come here for your own safety."}
