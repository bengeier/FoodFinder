{"text":"Went on a lunch break to try this spot out. The gentleman behind the counter introduced himself. His name is Kelly. He told me that for $7 I can choose a meat from the days special,  choose my side and drink. Can't beat that! It's a carry out place. They have a few stools yo sit while you wait. I got the jerk salmon. I apprieate them putting the sauce on the side so my gosh didn't burn. But I would like my fish to be cooked a little less. It had gotten dry. But the sauce helped! I will return for the Hennesey wings!"}
{"text":"I tried YCD out today for lunch. I had the stew chicken, rice & peas, vegetables, & plantain. It came with a 12oz soda for $7. I added mac & cheese for $3.

The chicken & gravy tasted pretty good as did the rice & peas. The plantain were sweet but the vegetables tasted like they were canned (not an issue for me) & not seasoned. I'm not a big mac & cheese eater however I enjoyed theirs. 

The customer service was great. It was quick & I was thanked several times for visiting. Overall it was pretty good & I'd say it's an authentically Jamaican/Carribean cuisine.  I'd absolutely eat there again. It shld be noted their menu varies by day."}
{"text":"FOOD WAS AMAZING! Customer service was exceptional! Prices were reasonable and very clean!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for some great Jamaican food look no further. Get yourself some Jamaican jerk chicken or kickin bourbon chicken style! The prices are great and the man behind it all is an awesome guy to meet!"}
{"text":"This was a pleasant surprise I stumbled upon while looking for a \"not burger combo \" lunch. Thankfully they had a sandwich board on the side of the sidewalk, otherwise I would have missed the location. Friendly customer service and inviting decor. 

One Price option for the lunch box was the draw for me, secondly was the expectation of flavor. Our tastebuds have been so ruined that I instantly thought the meal could use more salt but as I continued eating I realized that the flavor came through without the need of added salt, thanks on behalf  for everyone  watching their sodium intake.

Had the curry shrimp, rice and beans with cabbage and plantains, added coco bread for old times sake. Will definitely return and try other dishes."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem. It is located in the shopping center of Harvey's supermarket on Ashley Road in west Charlotte. First time trying it out was during my lunch. This is AUTHENTIC Caribbean nourishment. Very attentive, quick service, and good customer service. The menu is expansive as there are daily specials Monday-Sunday. $7 lunch specials all day everyday with a drink. I tried the jerk chicken with rice and beans. There is also your choice of patties; vegetable, chicken or beef. Sides include yellow rice/rice and peas/steam cabbage. Orders are cooked to order; I encourage you to call and place order because it can get busy depending on the time you go. You also get a 16oz soda with your lunch special. I spent $12 for 2 beef patties and coco bread. A must try if you enjoy Caribbean food."}
{"text":"Best Jamaican Spot!! The bourbon wings omgoshhh..esp the Mac & Cheeseeeee!!!!!  Please try it!!"}
{"text":"HENNESSY WANGS. HENNESSY WANGS. HENNESSY WAAAAANGS! 

Ok, so if you didn't know my favorite thing at Yard Cooked Dishes is the Hennessy wings. I've also had the bourbon wings which are amazing as well. I really want to try the ox tails but the times we've went to get them he's already out (insert crying sad face). We've been here about three times now and I finally got to taste plantains which are yummy. I'm sad there isn't any sweet tea on the menu cause my country butt loves a good sweet tea to have while eating spicy food but it's all good. This is my favorite new spot on the west side. Plan on eating there tonight. Food so good you'll be speaking Jamaican Patois."}
{"text":"Yard Cooked Dishes has the best chicken. From the curry chicken, to the brown stew chicken, along with Hennessy wings, Remy wings, and jerk chicken wings. The oxtails and goat meat will have you sucking the bone... The curry shrimp is amazing! The mac and cheese is the absolute best, and the Jamaican patties are always hot along with the Jamaican coco bread. You will not be disappointed when you come eat here! A must try restaurant!"}
{"text":"One of my staff members was raving about this place so much that she suggested we order it for our staff meeting. Sooooo glad she did! The brown stew chicken is absolutely delicious. I'm not a huge fan of spicy food so it had just enough kick for me. We barely made it through our staff meeting because everyone was enjoying the food so much.

I ordered it again today and the flavor was just as good... consistency is key to me. This is definitely a hidden gem that the West side really needed. Try it.... you will not be dissapointed!"}
{"text":"Garlic parmesan wings are the bomb!!! Great price for the food.. crazy delicious..will definitely go back over and over again"}
