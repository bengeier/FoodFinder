{"text":"Easily one of my top 5 places to eat in the area, if not the top.  Awesome for meat eaters worried about skimpy portions.  There is a veggie sampler appetizer that is awesome to share with 2-3 people and they always have daily/weekly specials (mains).  Just don't get the apple pie dessert (it sucks), stick with the Peruvian fare on that one."}
{"text":"Never had a bad meal here so far. The grilled meats are most excellent, far better than any Greek joint in town, and far tastier. Portions are large and the place has a good atmosphere. What more do you want plus it has a great patio !!"}
{"text":"My favourite place in town.  There is a reason it survived for so long in the same spot: you can't go wrong ordering in this place!!!  Yucca fries!!!  Corn bread!!!  Sangria!  And the martinis have been excellent every time with one single exception (the regular bartender must have been off or sick...)  And of course extra points scored by the awesome patio.  Yes, I will be back.  Again.  And again.  And again."}
{"text":"Ah Boulevard Cafe, te amo.  Perfect sangria, even more perfect sauteed shrimp and savoury corn bread to boot.   I've run by this Peruvian Annex favourite many a time to see crowds flock and it's oh-so-evident why.  Oh and to our latin waiter, thank you so much for being easy on the eyes. As if the delicious food wasn't enough!"}
{"text":"Food is so fresh and flavourful. Loved the ceviche and grilled meat. Really relaxing environment and service is helpful with picking a good dish."}
{"text":"Quite a disappointment! A group of us - 4 couples - were supposed to go to the Lakeview for dinner, however the group decided they wanted something more \"upscale\" for a Friday night meal. We went to Boulevard Cafe instead, and were seated quickly with reservations made only minutes before. This is where the enjoyment ended.   The service, as many people have already mentioned, was not good. It seemed the waiter didn't pay attention to anyone except for our spanish-speaking friend in the group. Service was slow and not much was explained to us. We nearly missed the daily specials board because it was not pointed out to us.  The food was absolutely not worth the cost. I had the soup of the day which was an overly-peppered, mushroom soup that arrived cold; a platter of steamed vegetables (I had dental surgery earlier so I had to keep it bland) with a simple garlic dip for a ridiculous $15. My fiancee ordered the fish of the day (which strangely was a choice between 5 different fish all made the same way) - she chose the salmon - and at $26 for a way-too-bony fillet of salmon with a skimpy mango salsa and three yucca frites, again, it was extremely overpriced. That meal with two glasses of wine and a beer cost us $105. A bit much for what we got.  When we got the bill we had no idea what our meal was (what's \"open table\"?) and it took awhile to get it explained. And on top of it all the waiter added an automatic 15% gratuity after taxes...not correct.  Overall, the meal at Boulevard Cafe made my fiancee and I wish that we had never left the Lakeview. Turns out \"upscale\" doesn't necessarily mean good."}
{"text":"Atrocious service. Was there twice and perhaps never again. It's enough to say, that after 45 min of waiting (and starving) we finally asked the server politely, \"hey, where is our food?\", to which he nonchalantly replied that he totally forgot about the order. Oh, did I mention that it's overpriced as well?"}
{"text":"Great food. the Ceviche was delicious, and the mains were great. Our party had lamb, chicken, calamari and steak, all were delcious. the cocktails were also tasty but pricey.  the bad, the service. our server was one of the worst i've experienced. it took forever for someone to take drink orders, and when our food orders went in it was an eternity until they came out. overall the service was extremely poor. For good measure when we recieved the bill, a 15% gratuity was added because we had a group (which is ok) she fought with us when we noticed that an item that we ordered and they were out of was still on the bill. she came to the table 3 times to argue that we were wrong. at the end, she was wrong, and adjusted our bill.  I normally wouldn't make a fuss or even write a review but our server was the shits, and the food was overpriced especially because the service was lousy."}
{"text":"We went with a large group (about a dozen) and everyone enjoyed themselves.  The food was great, the server was friendly and knew her stuff.  We ordered various cocktails and different meals (starter/main/dessert) and everyone enjoyed everything.  The only negative was the fact that they had run out of a few things so we had to change our orders, but we enjoyed it all the same.  A really nice local restaurant."}
{"text":"I went to Boulevard Cafe with a friend for Summerlicious ($25 dinner). While I thought the food was stellar, the service left much to be desired, to the point that I'm pretty sure I wouldn't return.  When we arrived to the restaurant, we had already made a reservation, and we were told to wait, which itself isn't a bad thing, but we were rudely pushed aside by the waiter during the wait, as if we were preventing more important customers from coming in.  Once we got seated, our waiter told us about his recommendation of wine and asked us if we were in the mood of any. My friend doesn't drink wine, so I asked for a cocktail menu. He literally threw the menu on the table and left without saying a word... and this was before they knew we were there for Summerlicious! When the waiter came back, we had to ask for the Summerlicious menu, of which he asked if we specified it in our reservation.  For the appetizer, I got the ceviche. While tasty, I barely got anything beyond the seabass. There was barely any calamari or shrimp. Must have been the *licious treatment.  As for the main, I had the fish of the day, which happened to be tilapia with mango salsa, and it was delicious. The fish was cooked to perfection and came with a side of fried yucca.  The time between each course was considerably long and not much attention was given to us. After our entr√©es were finished, the waiter came back and asked us what we wanted for dessert. We asked about the choices, because the menu didn't specify what was available. He said there was a strawberry rhubarb pie... and that's it. So why did he ask then? Rather odd.  The dessert was scrumptious. Again, the meal tasted very good. And it's a shame, because the poor service just ruined the experience and I would not return to this establishment."}
{"text":"One of my favourite places in the neighbourhood. The food is delicious and freshly made and the service is very pleasant. A bit on the pricier side. I recommend this place for a relaxed and slightly expensive brunch (my typical places are dive diners) - on Sundays only. Creative take as well as standard brunch fare."}
{"text":"The boulevard cafe can be summed up as questionable.  The food was great, but the service was..... leaving something to be desired.  I made a reservation a few days before, which didn't seem to be a problem.  I arrived there, and our table was waiting for us.  We were given menus, but on the menu board there was a prix fixe menu for $25 which included a starter, main course and dessert.  Myself and 3 other people went for the prix fixe.  The waiter suggested we start with a vegetable appetizer platter which consisted of steamed potatoes, asparagus, green beans, carrots and hard boiled eggs with a creamy dip.  It was okay, but I would have preferred the vegetables to be roasted; they just seemed so ordinary being steamed.  We also ordered a 1/2 litre pitcher of sangria (even though it was cold out) and it was very good!  Our first course (for most of us) was lentil soup, which was amazing, especially on a cold day.  Then we were served our main courses.  I had the steak that was made in some sort of tomato sauce, which was served with rice and yukon gold fries (I forget what it was called, it had some sort of Portuguese name to it)  It was all very good, and presented very nicely.  We had a choice of a few desserts, which we shared, and were good too.  The only issue I had with the restaurant is that our waiter, even though he had extensive knowledge of the menu was being overly friendly.  While serving us, he would put his hand on our shoulders, which made some of us uncomfortable.  As well, he would refer to my 78 year old grandmother as \"hun,\" which was really uncalled for and not appropriate.    Overall this restaurant was great.  Just cross your fingers when you go that you don't have the same waiter that I had!"}
{"text":"Food is sub par. I had chicken that was dry in a sauce that tasted like it's been on the stove 2 days too long. The service is slow. For the prices on their menu you'd expect a better dinning experience though they have a great patio and make an amazing key-lime pie."}
{"text":"Wow!  We just got back from Boulevard Cafe.. what a wonderful experience.  Everything we ordered was great!  One of our favorite restaurants in Toronto.. for sure.  Highly recommend it!!"}
{"text":"This place is completely hit and miss, which can be very frustrating.  The first time I went I got a nice chicken dish with interesting sides (beets and wild rice) and enjoyed it very much.  Second time I got an overcooked flank steak (grey all the way through) and a fellow dinner got an undercooked salmon fillet (raw all the way through).  Combined with the generally grumpy service, this isn't a great option especially considering the excellent restaurants up and down Harbord."}
{"text":"Having lived in the area for a few years and never been I decided to check out Boulevard Cafe.   I'm an avid fan of South-Central American food and I was very excited to try this restaurant's menu.   The ceviche appetizer was great and the fish-stew was very flavorful with a wonderful combination of spices. The Spanish beer they have (Ambur) was also very good. I tried a chicken with pineapple dish and it too was great. Overall it was a great and tasty meal.   The service at this restaurant is lacking. The crammed me and my guest into a corner near a busy door by splitting table of 6 into a 4 and a 2 (leaving only 3\" between us and the other of table). I don't mind tight seating but don't sit me at a table with other people when half of the restaurant is open. The waitress was nice but was not very attentive (had to ask for bread, didn't bring bill, etc.).   The food deserved 4 stars and the service deserved 2. 3 stars is the average and that is what Boulevard will get."}
{"text":"I have been lusting after this beautiful terrace for some time now.   The food was some sort of generic/pan-latin variety which wasn't exactly what i expected from a place with a French name -but worse still was the service or lack there of. Apparently you have to be a regular to get any acknowledgement - although mostly i just witnessed a lot of obnoxious air kisses and a whole lot of chatting sans serving.  Sadly unimpressed."}
{"text":"Came her for my girlfriend's birthday. Had Sangrai and the shareable seafood tapas plate with mussels, calamari, cerviche and other snacks. Was very delicious and seemed quite fresh.  Service was also quite good. Ambiance was also quite cute.  Only knock against this place is that the Sangria was $$$$$$$."}
{"text":"Last night was a special occassion. It was my girlfriend's birthday. As a result, she requested that we visit the Boulevard Cafe for dinner. I had been there on two prior occassions and did not have anything negative to say about the place, so I accommodated her request.  I did take note to check Yelp before making the reservation (it was Thursday night, so I would suggest making one...I'm not sure how busy they are Sunday-Wednesday).   I thought it was interesting that a few previous posts had some pretty negative things to say about their dining experience, especially regarding the service.  Given those comments, I took special note of the table service last night. I did not note anything out of the ordinary. We were promptly met by a host when we arrived and were seated rather quickly. We only sat for a few minutes before someone came to ask us for drinks. Throughout the evening our water glasses were filled multiple times. Our food arrived rather promptly, despite the restaurant being rather packed. Even when I had a question about the corn bread, the waiter promptly answered my question in a polite manner.  Regarding the food, I did not have any complaints. I ordered the burger and it was delivered as asked (medium/well). I asked to substitute the fries with sweet potato. The waiter accomodated my request, and did not charge me extra for the sweet potato as often happens in other establishments. The burger also came with a small side salad. The portion was a fair size and left me feeling quite full by the end of the meal.  My girlfriend ordered one of the specials. I think it was a chicken breast marinated in a spicy orange sauce. It came with sides of sweet potatos and sliced beets. I had a taste of the chicken and sauce and again had no complaints.  Also, as an appetizer, we ordered the quesidilla, which came with crab and chicken salad. Personally, I'm not a big fan of chicken salad, so it was not for me, but I wouldn't give the restaurant bad marks for that.  We took a glance at the dessert menu, however nothing really jumped out at us.  Now, given what I've just said, you may be wondering why I'm only giving 4 rather than 5 stars. Here are the reasons why:  - Unstable table: our table was not level on its footing. It was quite annoying as it bounced back and forth as we ate. This is something that the wait staff should have noticed and remedied. We should not have had to ask for that to be fixed.  - Value: At a price point of $14.95 for my burger, and $18.95 for my girlfriend's entree, I'd say that it's a bit on the expensive side. The value for what you get is not quite there. We would have ordered a glass of sangria, however it cost $9/glass. My favorite drink, a mohito, cost $11.  - Noise level: Even though we were sitting on the patio, the noise level was quite high (due to the close proximity of the tables). Thus, this is not a place you would be able to take your grand parents.  - Authenticity: The restaurant bills itself as Peruvian/Latin American. I would guess that many people may go there expecting to get something truly authentic. I'm afraid that the menu is quite North Americanized. For example, one of the specials on the menu was Arctic Char. I rather doubt that one would be able to find that kind of fish in Peru.  On the whole, I'd say that we had a fairly decent meal and would recommend the Boulevard Cafe to others."}
{"text":"Perhaps the caption of this review should be: \"I have never fingered Roland Barthes...\" (see an earlier review for clarification (points down)).  The name says it all. It's a boulevard cafe. I should clarify my rating. I would give the food a 4, but the service I would give a single star. Since there are no partial ratings, I chose to round down.   My main reason for rounding down? The help. You can call them help, if you wish, but if I had control over the English language, I would rename this kind of \"help\" to \"hinder\".   I don't want to list the numerous ways in which i was snubbed by the wait staff. From forgetting appetizers I ordered, to looking past me as I waited for my order to be taken, or my bill to be tabulated.  I do admit that the food was good, but the staff definitely ruined my experience.  Also, their house wine sucks."}
{"text":"Many people list this as their favourite Latin American restaurant in the city, and you can count me among them. The delicious, aromatic Peruvian cuisine is unique, leans slightly towards seafood, and is served by outstanding staff. I can't say enough about this place."}
{"text":"Great service. Went with a large group w adults no kids. They graciously sat is outside and created a mega table for us. Had a great time."}
{"text":"I hesitated about whether or not I should write this review, considering I didn't actually eat at the restaurant.  I was supposed to, and was really looking forward to it based on some of the reviews here...but unfortunately I let the 4 stars influence me and didn't read enough.  Specifically all the comments on the bad service, because it was that service that turned my friend and I off so much that we left.  I had made a reservation earlier that day for 2 people at 7:30.  My friend arrived at 7:20 and was told she shouldn't come back for at least 20 minutes.  There was nowhere for her to wait apparently, but the hostess suggested she go for drinks at \"a place\" across the way.  Leaving the restaurant, the only thing across the street is a Laundromat.  When I got to the area, she told me what had happened, so we wandered around for a bit and got back at 7:45.  On the front door, there is a sign asking that you use the side door.  When you get to the side door, there's another sign asking you to go to the next door down.  When we opened that door, I felt like we were coming in the staff entrance, but my friend who had already been there earlier assured me it was the right door (although she shared my apprehension).  It seemed like we were right smack dab in the kitchen area.  Let me paint a picture...we walked in and were in a hall.  To the left was a staircase, to the right was a wall with coat hooks.  Past the wall on the right was the kitchen.  Past the stairs and the wall on the left was the prep area.  Apparently that was where my friend had found the hostess the first time.  So we asked one of the prep guys for the hostess.  Apprehension was growing...  She came out of the front area and recognized my friend with a slightly uneasy \"Oh, you're back\".  She then disappeared upstairs to see if our table was ready, leaving us to wait in the entry hall.  And wait we did.  For about 15 minutes we waited, pressing ourselves against the walls as other patrons came in, and as servers came out of the kitchen to take dishes upstairs.  If you're claustrophobic, stay away.  When she finally came back, she told us that it looked like one table was just about ready for their bill.  At this point it was after 8, and our reservation had been for 7:30.  She left us there again, and by that point we were so shocked that we decided to just leave.  I would be willing to try this place again because of all the positive reviews about the food, but I really hope they improve their service - and develop a place to wait!!  Hopefully they'll also learn how to handle reservations, and not overbook themselves."}
{"text":"Although this place boasts a beautiful patio perfect for a lazy Sunday brunch I can't recommend it as a must eat kind've place.   The food is decent, the people are nice but the service as slow as molasses and for the prices you pay, it's just not worth it. Dinner is better than brunch though.  This place has been reviewed enough. You don't need my gumpy ass to contribute to the misery."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. I'm vegetarian though and the menu here doesn't really cater to vegetarians. If, however, you talk to the amazing server that is there (I've had the same guy twice and he is SO helpful!) and tell them you're vegetarian, Boulevard Cafe DOES in fact make a delicious vegetarian meal. What I had was a tamale in banana leaf with corn meal, cheese, and minced vegetables, with a side salad, house made re-fried beans, and roasted beets. It's a BIG meal with BIG flavour. One of my faves!"}
{"text":"Great covered patio. Enjoyed lunch with a group. Small menu but there was something for everyone. Tried the grilled chicken and avocado sandwich. The ceviche special also looked delicious. Service was prompt and friendly. The only thing I was disappointed about was that they didn't have cornbread available."}
{"text":"I recently dined here for a friend's birthday lunch and although the service was a bit slow, the food was incredible!  The bread is amazing, and the unique sandwiches and other menu items are divine.  It also has a great patio and is on a relatively quiet corner that makes you feel like you're in a small town instead of a big city.   With all the side streets in close proximity, there is plenty of free street parking which is also a huge plus."}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere at Boulevard. We entered to an assortment of glowing candles. It was warm and cozy (and full of people!) on a cold fall evening.  The service was friendly...but kind of odd. Well, our waiter was a little odd.   My friends ordered the grilled chicken main and the fish main. I got the starter quesadilla. Before ordering I asked the waiter if it was filling enough for a main 'oh sure it is!'.  No it wasnt'. My $15 quesadilla was the size of a sushi hand roll (and rolled in the same fashion instead of the flat-plan style I'm used to). The flavour was great with crab meat and shrimp filling. I just wish there was more of it...  I filled myself up on their hearty bread. My friend felt sad for me and offered some of her dinner...I felt pitied.  I think...$15 was too much for the size of my meal. I wish the waiter had been more honest, I would of just picked a main.   I'm iffy about going back. I feel like I had one of those moments equivalent to buying a $10 hot dog because its in the city."}
{"text":"The patio at the Boulevard Cafe is lovely and would probably be my number one reason for returning. The food and service were both good enough, but not enough to make me rush back."}
{"text":"Recently went in to have a quick lunch with the ladies in the family. We sat in a nice large outdoor terrace.  The menu has a strong \"south/central American\" orientation, with a smattering of Spanish dishes.  The service was prompt and pleasant. I had the Gazpacho, which was not the Andalous version, but a Central American interpretation. It was very good.  I followed that with a Tamale. This again, was an interpreted Tamale, not the Mexican variety. It did come wrapped in a Banana leaf, but was too \"crumbly\". It had been probably overcooked. The taste was OK.  They did feature tasty salads with a dressing that enhanced the flavours of the greens. Unfortunately the greens were a bit too cold. They should have been served at room temperature.  The ladies had a  good time, and enjoyed the moment. The patio, in my case added to the enjoyment. If I could award 1/2 stars I would add one here."}
{"text":"Poor service! After calling a number of other places, this place was the only place that would take a reservation for a party of 12 at 12:30. I was expecting brunch but it was a lunch menu instead. Given that we were a large party I knew that things would take a bit longer than usual. However, after putting our order in, some of our food arrived over an hour later. The other half of our food arrived 30 mins later. By this time, half of us had already finished our meals. The menu was nothing special and their portions were small.   I chose this place because of its cute atmosphere and Spanish theme. I would think twice before trying this place again."}
{"text":"The Boulevard Cafe is easily one of my favourite restaurants in this city for breakfast, lunch and dinner! They specialize in Peruvian fare and make the best cornbread I've ever tasted!!! Their shaded side patio is always bustling in the spring and summer and offers the perfect respite on a hot day!   For breakfast Huevos Rancheros are a huge hit! Seafood for dinner is always fresh and they make amazing sandwiches and salads for lunch. On a street that is certainly known for its culinary gems, Boulevard Cafe always stands out and lures me back in time and again!   Currently their website seems to be out of commission, but reservations are recommended, especially on weekends."}
{"text":"I am updating my review based on my last three experiences at Boulevard Cafe. While the food remains excellent, the service has gone steadily down hill. At best, the service of late has been extremely slow (20 mins to talk drink orders, another 15 to get the drinks, 15 mins after that to take food orders, etc.). At worst, servers have been rude, irritable, evasive, and negligent. They have also annoyingly started to charge for bread, a trend in this city that needs to stop."}
{"text":"Okay, I admit it I once was a nerdy chick who fingered, with one hand, the pages of a Charlotte Bronte novel, while highlighting, with the other hand, the cultural studies scriptures of Roland Barthes.  For this past avoiding reason, I rarely frequent the street that stinks of the kind of student I once was, Harbord.  But on special occasion (like my boyfriend's parents are in town), I will steal out on to that Collegian street to visit a wonderful Peruvian treasure and a neighborhood favorite, the Boulevard Caf√©.  The restaurant's d√©cor is a bit shabby and out of date but it is cozy and it has two floors, which make it seem like you're dining in a nice big house for a couple hours.   Speaking of which, last time I was there the waitress fell down the stairs, so be careful kids, they're kind of steep.  By the way, the food is fabulous.  Anything grilled is their specialty, but I suggest the seafood choices.  Oh and have I mentioned the fresh baked corn bread that comes to every table...you might want to try that..."}
{"text":"I've been here about 4-5 times over the years. Its a small restaurant with a good ambience. Service is friendly. While it is a bit on the pricer side the quality is quite good. I ordered the rainbow trout with garlic rice and was happy with my meal. As a side note: they do not seem to have any beer on top and just have bottles."}
{"text":"I've had Parrillada Mixta (a mixed grill of lamb, chicken, beef and sausage), Chicken Anticuchos (charbroiled brochettes marinated in herbs, wine & spices) and Mariscos Al Vapor (clams and mussels in a spicy butter white wine, garlic and coriander sauce) here, and I enjoyed them for the most part. I loved the spicy garlic sauce they give on the side.  However, I will never go back because of two reasons. 1. The portion is too small for the price. 2. I want to give tips myself, not taken from me without a word."}
{"text":"They don't follow their advertised hours. I checked their hours, biked all the way over there for lunch and the door was locked, although all the patio tables were set and there were people inside."}
{"text":"Nice Sunday Brunch here!  Took mom and pops for Father's Day. It was a beautiful day and they have a lovely, well shaded patio.  Brunch was reasonably priced - they have a special Sunday brunch menu with about 15 items - most between $10-$12.   The service was absolutely fantastic when we were there. There was only one waiter out on the patio, but he was quick, friendly and attentive, juggling 5-6 tables with ease. Kept our waters topped off and was prompt with taking orders, bringing bread, food and the bill.  I tried the eggs florentine (Huevos Florentina) and my parents had Tortilla Rellena (some kind of folded over tortilla with baked beans and greyere cheese). Food was tasty and we were brought a big basket of fresh, thick bread and butter.  I would go back for brunch again. Dinner menu appeared a bit pricier but nothing ridiculous."}
{"text":"I came here with my mother for coffee slightly before the dinner hour. The espresso machine at Chabichou was broken so The Boulevard Cafe seemed like an okay option.   I can't speak for the food but it was the single worst cup of coffee I have ever had, and that is saying something. It literally tasted like my Americano was made out of yesterdays dishwater, totally flavourless. Unless you count yucky-blahness as a flavor.   The service was good. It was nice of them to seat us just for coffee so close to the dinner rush, but come on guys. You'd think a restaurant like this could serve up something better then sludge."}
{"text":"My boyfriend used to eat here years ago so we decided to see if it was like he remembered. It was terrific! I had the cod and he had the beef Anticucho (a brochette). They were both delicious and tender! I liked his dish a little better so I am glad we shared. Our server was friendly and honest about the menus so we could make our selections. We were on the patio and it was great. I loved the mural in the back and wished that the seats were positioned there, however, we had a great seat in the front. We had a delicious appetizer with baby shrimp and crab in at tortilla (Quesadilla del Mar). It was lovely. I look forward to coming back. Why not a five out of five? Their credit card machine was down so we had to pay cash. The server forewarned us so that we didn't get surprised at the end of the meal. Much appreciated."}
{"text":"A lovely, lovely place to have summer dinner with good friends.  Unlike many of the reviews that precede mine, we had an attentive server who made an effort to find the coldest sauvignon blanc in the fridge for us, and who explained the subtle differences between a grilled sea bream and a grilled bass.  And was spot on, since we ordered both.  As mentioned by others, the bread is amazing, hard to keep your fingers out of the basket, with a plate of spicy olive oil along side to dab.  My partner began with a sweet potato sopa (soup), full of silky flavour.  The grilled calamari appetizer was a tad toothsome, (served whole, not in rings) but generous and yummy.  The caesar salad however with completely uninspired--whole leaves of romaine lettuce barely coated in dressing, a shake of cheese, red onion which isn't necessary, and no anchovies as promised.  Mains were fabulous. The 2 grilled fish dishes were both succulent, somewhat boney (to be expected from those fish types), and completely full of flavour, accompanied by a mango salsa, yucca fries, and a limey arugula salad.  First class, if messy to eat.  The guys both had a maresco al limon pappardelle dish, (listed as fettuccini) artfully served with mussels and clams circling a huge shrimp atop the spicy, tomato-based pasta. Never had meals this high end in Peru, that's for sure.  We passed on dessert and finished the meal with an Americano each, but found the coffee very strong and acrid.  A bit of cream and sugar (and an additional pot of hot water) helped, but one shouldn't have to doctor a good restaurant's coffee that much.  On a minor note, the upstairs lavs were surprisingly hot--easily 20 degrees hotter than the rest of the building.   Prices are a shade above average for good dining in TO, eg whole fish were $32.   So...food, wine, service, terrace ambiance-- 5 stars.  Caesar salad, coffee, washroom lost them one star.  Would return happily."}
