{"text":"Great diner for an early breakfast or late brunch.  The service is quite attentive and also very friendly. You'll never go without a full cup of coffee either, as the staff always make sure you're topped off. It's a great neighborhood establishment full of every walk of life. The food is always hot and the daily specials are delicious. I'm partial to their breakfast menu and it never disappoints.  Barb's takes credit/debit too which means you'll never have to scramble last minute for cash."}
{"text":"Small mom and pop diner on Butler Street known for being a cheap place to grab breakfast (they have other food too). The food is good and the waitresses are always friendly and personable. You can't go wrong with Barb's."}
{"text":"It is a solid greasy spoon.  The service was a bit disjointed today.  The specials were enticing."}
{"text":"Today, we've learned something new about food. We never know that one waffle can take an hour to make. It is amazingly awesome to have one of the longest-wait pancake in an entire world. What surprised me more was the taste! It was so bland.  Ooohhhh...we also found a bug in the syrup that they gave us (please see the photos below). Who doesn't want protein in their waffle!?   Anyway, the service was terrific! Why!? It should be ranked in one of the the top-ten worst restaurants of the world! Therefore, we were glad that we have this place. It is one of a life time experience.   P.S. How can I give a -5 on yelp?"}
{"text":"I love this place! How have I lived nearby for almost 2 years without knowing that this little gem existed. Completely unpretentious. Typically dinner food. Admittedly, I've only have eaten here once, today for the first time in fact, I will DEFINITELY come back. Great food, pleasant service, amazingly affordable food."}
{"text":"Great diner and important representation of lawrenceville pre-gentrification. Surely a cultural landmark in the city."}
{"text":"Truly Pittsburgh in the best way. My omelette was amazing and the atmosphere is great. The staff is 100% authentic yinzer and the regulars have clearly been coming for coffee and toast every morning for the past 30 years. I was surprised by how good the food (and coffee) was. Definitely an awesome little place for breakfast if you're in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Amazing food. I was scared walking in. Looked like a whole in the wall. I told my friend who brought me if I didn't like it it would affect our friendship.  Best breakfast I've had in pittsburgh. My new choice"}
{"text":"Terrible service, terrible food. Waited forever for uncooked eggs and didn't even get everything we ordered. There are plenty of much better breakfast options in the area."}
{"text":"I love little family restaurants and this is a nice one on the main street in Lawrenceville. A couple years ago they expanded and opened another room which serves alcohol. That room has more of an upscale feel, but the other room still maintains that small-town diner vibe. I've only had a couple of meals here but I was satisfied each time."}
{"text":"What a wonderful little greasy spoon diner. Breakfast special was AWESOME and totally worth the reasonable price. Nice little local place with good food and a basic atmosphere."}
{"text":"If you want a cheap meal that will get you through the day, Barb's Country Kitchen will accommodate.  But don't expect anything more than average quality food.    DECOR AND VIBE:  Hole-in-the-wall diner.  It was clean-ish -- the age of the place shows.  Kitchen is visible from dining room, and it looked clean.    Basic booth seating.  A neighborhood place, you will see a lot more diversity in people than you will see in other Lawrenceville spots.  Comfortable.    SERVICE:  Wait staff was very friendly.  Food came out very quickly.    PRICE:  Five stars.  You could feed a family of four, with drinks, and not spend more than $20.  They serve a lot of items al la carte, so if you are not really hungry, you have plenty of options.    FOOD:  It is what it is.  I had pancakes and potatoes.  My guest had a breakfast sandwich.    Taste?  Nothing was especially great, but I have certainly had worse food at much higher prices.    Everything was prepared well, and the portion sizes were solid.    If you are use to higher-quality coffee, you may want to pass.    OVERALL:  If you are in Lawrenceville,  hungry, left your wallet, and only have a ten dollar bill in your pocket, this is a decent option for quick, cheap food.  But this is certainly not the 4 or 5 star place other posters suggest.  It is what it is, and doesn't try to be anything else."}
{"text":"Barb's is my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh. It is homemade greasy goodness. Everything here is amazing at a great price.   You can get a huge plate of breakfast foods or an amazing sandwich and I never pay more than $10.   Their onion rings are the single best onion rings I have ever had. Most places just buy a frozen bag but at Barb's they cut, batter and fry theirs by hand. Its something simple that takes their food to the next level.   Good old fashioned cooking like your grandma use to make. So so so so good. Try it out."}
{"text":"I ate Breakfast here on Sunday 9 July. I had the worst food and worst service of my life. I will NEVER return! There was only one waitress and she seemed to be suffering with a hangover. The place is DIRTY and needs a visit from the Health Department. The utensils wrapped in a paper napkin actually had dried food on them and I we t thru 4 coffee cups before I found a clean one--definitely should have told friends I was leaving but suffered thru it to be with them. On top of all this, the waitress got my order wrong! Does not even reach the level of a \"greasy spoon\". I'm sick just thinking of it!!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Have been going here since before I could remember. Food is great, service is great, and I couldn't ask for anything better!"}
{"text":"Barb's is legit. It's exactly what I'm looking for in a diner. It's inexpensive, the food is good and a little sloppy, and the menu has everything I'd want for a quick breakfast. The country fried steak, biscuits and gravy, corned beef hash, and pancakes are all great.  It's not the best breakfast spot in the city, but it's worth your time and your wallet and your stomach will be happy."}
{"text":"Barb's is a fine spot. Service was good and friendly. I had the egg and cheese breakfast sandwich which was ok. The homefries were over salted. But it is a fun environment and pays tribute to military veterans. I would go back but would be realistic as to what I get for my money."}
{"text":"The service was great at Barbs but the food was meh. My brother-in-laws quesadilla did not have any cheese in it? Confusing. Also, it took quite a while to receive our food. Many larger tables sat after us received their meals before us."}
{"text":"First of all...this is a neighborhood diner.  It has many functions for the community than just serving food.  They play a big part. Anyone coming in who is expecting cooking and tastes from Nanna, mommy or aunt bette, should not waste their time.  What you are going to get is what you should expect in any restaurant....that particular chef's interpretation of food preparation. This is a diner, a greasy spoon....both admirable titles for an establishment.   I like the food here.  It is honest and reasonable.  If you want cheap then go get your grand slam or your egg mcmuffin meal.  Don't take up space in a place where there is no problem filling a seat.  This is a place where city workers, cops, retirees, millenials and every other variety of individual frequents. The servers are honest, hard working people with out pretense or the need to impress anyone.  I like them! If you want just an honest breakfast or lunch, then I would recommend Barb's.  If your eggs don't turn out like your mom's, then call her up and tell her you're coming over for breakfast."}
{"text":"Exactly what you'd expect. Prices are great. Wonderful personalities. I wouldn't rush to wear a searsucker jacket in to order the benedict but the breakfast is rock solid diner food.  I'll take Barb's over DeLuca's any day and twice on Sunday."}
{"text":"Going to Barbs's after reading the Yelp reviews helped. In sum, the food can be cheap, filling and a great overall \"greasy spoon\" diner.  The waitresses were very attentive to coffee refills, but as others have said don't put in a lot of cavies into your order. You are better off ordering straight off the menu with no changes.  I didn't realize it, but they asked if I wanted peppers and onions in my home fries but didn't tell me that was an extra dollar. The coffee is now $1.75, but worth it for bottomless coffee.   My suggestion for future patrons and helpers would be to keep it simple, and order off the menu with no additions. Overall a 4 star diner for its category. Go and try Barbs for yourself."}
{"text":"I went to this diner with some friends. I had never been here before but passed it many times never noticing it. By far the best diner in pittsburgh. If ur hungry and this is an option, I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Good, friendly home style diner.  Comfort food all the way.  Nothing stylish or contemporary, just what you would expect from old school diner.  ORICIBG Is Very reasonable"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a Lawrenceville diner for breakfast this is your place! They open very early and close at 3.  We got there on a Sunday at 10 am and did not have to wait. It is small but they have a covered outdoor area which has more room. Our waitress was great, very friendly and prompt. I went with the egg and cheese breakfast sandwich on wheat bread with bacon. It also came with home fries as do most of the entrees.  I liked how you could pick from a variety of breads including Italian bread which I highly recommend for the breakfast sandwiches as it is thicker. Others in my party got the 3 egg special with a choice of meat, toast and home fries for $5.99. Everything tasted great and was served quickly."}
{"text":"closest breakfast place to my house. Went on my birthday as the first place i ate out at in Pittsburgh. Barb and company sang happy birthday and put a candle in a muffin for me. Good down home breakfast. Egg sandwich are good take out. ill be back"}
{"text":"Waitress took our order then came back 5 minutes later saying she lost the pad she wrote it on and had to take it again...The turkey sausage was disgusting..didn't taste like any turkey sausage I've ever had, more like dog food. I ordered over easy eggs and toast. The waitress also forgot the toast and said she'd be right back with it but then stopped to take another table's order first. I waited awhile for her to bring the toast back so I could finally start to eat my eggs..can't have dippy eggs without toast! The toast was burnt black on the edges and when I cut into my eggs they were hard fried anyway. No runny yoke. Just awful all the way around. I'll stick with Ritters."}
{"text":"I never can hate this place even when it is crowded & mistakes happen food is always good coffee hot & service decent"}
{"text":"I'd personally give this 3 stars, but my boyfriend really really loves this place.  A LOT.  The food is a little too greasy spoon for me.  But Barbs is a friendly place and I do respect that.  The prices are right, the foods edible, and it's close to where we live."}
{"text":"I enjoy stopping in for a very good breakfast. Steak and eggs are my go to but this time I had a veggie omlet and it was very good."}
{"text":"Ate breakfast twice at this place over the weekend, and we were not disappointed.  It is an enjoyable neighborhood place with honest food.  If we ever visit Pittsburgh again we will be back."}
{"text":"Great simple breakfast.  Will become a repeat customer.  Great to find a place like this in the City."}
{"text":"This is the perfect spot for brunch if you are looking for a standard, greasy spoon type diner. The food was good, there was a lot of it, and it was incredibly inexpensive. Another reviewer said try to order straight off the menu because they will not accommodate you, but I will say the exact opposite of this. I was with three family members who all wanted their food made very precisely, and the waitress was super nice and understanding and the food was made exactly as requested. We also had a child with us who wanted something not on the menu and the waitress said, \"just tell us what you want, we'll figure out a way to make it.\" Ok, it sounds like we were an awful table but I don't think it was that bad lol. Anyway, GREAT place!"}
{"text":"I ate here with some girlfriends after a night out, it was incredible. The dress code is anywhere from sweatpants to three piece suits and the regulars make it feel like home.  Kitchen sink omelet was delicious, apple glazed waffle special was DELISH, and the white gravy? Flavorful and delicious, cheap and a great breakfast spot."}
{"text":"Thankfully, Barbs is in  walking distance to my house. This is a great place for your hangover cure, and your wallet will say  \"thank you sir/mam may I have another\" as it is DIRT CHEAP.  Barbs does breakfast, and they do it well, catering to the hearty working class Pittsburgh appetite.  They have a wide selection of Omelets, and you can order biscuits and gravy on the side (my go to fat kid breakfast item).  The waitress is spot on with coffee and anything else you may need.   Everything was just what the doctor ordered, well, maybe not since I put hot sauce and mayo on everything, but thats another story. Unpretentious, filling, cheap, hearty, delicious."}
{"text":"Nothing fancy, but we had a good breakfast here! The dining area isn't very big, but they packed a ton of tables in there so it is rather crowded on a busy weekend morning.   The staff was extremely nice and friendly, but pretty unorganized. We were asked by three different waitresses if we ordered yet or if we needed drinks (which is better than being ignored I guess), but when we were finished our meal we sat for a half hour waiting for the check and the waitress said she just forgot about us.   If you want an affordable (and leisurely) breakfast with a classic diner menu, Barbs is the place to go!"}
{"text":"I very much like visiting Barb's corner kitchen. The meals are very big in size and you're not walk out of this place hungry. If you do this is your own fault.   The pricing for the meals is pretty reasonable if you stick to the menu. A couple times we have made certain substitutions and has and up making the bill little more costly.  The interior of the place is decorated to the tilt with the upcoming holiday. It's interesting to see how many decorations they have just for St. Patrick's day.  When you get to Barb's there is no hostess just said yourself or one of the friendly staff will let you know to do so. We have had perfect experiences both times we've been there with the staff they been very attentive and making us feel like their family."}
{"text":"How did I only give Barb's 3 stars before?  My apologies.  I was back last weekend for lunch with some friends.  I had a difficult time deciding what to order until I saw the lunch special at another table: hot roast beef sandwich with mashed potatoes and gravy.  Our waitress told me the roast beef had just come out of the oven and it was even better than I dreamed it would be.  And with the mashed and that gravy?  Bullseye.    I'd also recommend the Country Fried Steak I ordered on a previous visit.  It is a  hearty breakfast that even I couldn't finish.  Service can be a little slow at times, but always friendly.  It's a great location in Lawrenceville.  I'll continue to return."}
{"text":"Definitely old school Lawrenceville, a good place to get a reasonably priced breakfast with super friendly and attentive service. We went at 9:30 am on a Saturday, which is apparently the changing of the guard: every patron from that point on was hipster.  There are excellent specials posted, but also plenty to choose from on the regular menu. Our food was well prepared typical diner fare, and our servers came by regularly with hot coffee and ice water. Barb's is a dependable breakfast choice at a modest price."}
{"text":"Recently went for breakfast and enjoyed the whole time I was there. Food was spot on. I like to get a little bit of everything when I order so I had the big farm special which had sausage bacon eggs toast pancakes and potatoes. All items were good. Bacon was cooked perfectly. Service was very friendly and speedy even during lunch time and being busy. Not a fancy brunch spot but who cares, I would go back!"}
{"text":"A great little neighborhood place.  Good service and a great cheap breakfast.  We will be regulars!"}
{"text":"To be honest, I'm completely confused by these positive reviews. Our server had long, dirty, tobacco stained fingernails that were poking into our order of eggs when she set them on the table -- gross!! It kind of brings dirt cheap to a whole new meaning for me. And the food just wasn't very good at all. We didn't finish our meals. We just paid and left, and I'm pretty sure we ate breakfast again when we got home. Maybe we just had a bad experience? Or maybe I'm just not a local regular or a hipster?"}
{"text":"Yay! Something super affordable in an increasingly expensive neighborhood. They have typical diner food: pancakes, waffles, hamburgers. There is a television. Guests seat themselves either at tables or there is also a bar counter. The service was pretty good. The space is very small and cute and diner-y, as one would expect. I'd recommend for a breakfast if you're a baller on a budget."}
{"text":"Yummy food and great service! The waitress held our kiddo while we ate haha. :) It has a small town feel and the usual diner breakfast food variety. We will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"This place is great. Don't be turned off by the shabby decor. The food is delicious and easy on your pocket. I come here often and always get something on the breakfast menu. Reminds me of grandma's cookin (:"}
{"text":"Place was okay. Hangover food that wasn't the tastiest. Not the cleanest place either but friendly service"}
{"text":"Great home style breakfast. These folks just had a major robbery and lost much of there income and cash so we stopped in to support the business and get some tasty breakfast. This is not the Grand Concourse's Sunday brunch and all the better it's not. The food is great and plate size is ample but the atmosphere is much more comfortable and relaxing. This is your breakfast spot if you are looking for a spot to de-stress after a hard week. Like moms kitchen the food is simple but very tasty. Try the breakfast sandwiches, they are pressed and a notch above the standard fare. Also the omelets are killer. Good food, neighborhood folks and a \"take it easy\" atmosphere make this a great spot for me in my hi stress, 24/7, go go go job. Stop and enjoy."}
{"text":"Barb's is amazing! Our favorite place for brunch when we are craving some diner comfort food. I always get the Southern style because it's always fantastic. Reasonable prices for the amount of food you get and I've never been disappointed. It's a smaller place so there could be a wait, but the waitresses are always running around making sure you have plenty of coffee. There is a reason it is always full of regulars."}
{"text":"The food was good, loves the pancakes. Had the bigman. Only issue I had was that the water wasn't filtered. My tea had a weird metallic taste because they gave me heated city water."}
{"text":"If you like watered down coffee, margarine, processed cheese product, and soggy toast, then this is the place for you. They know how to under cook and burn potatoes at the same time. Cheap, yes. And it shows."}
{"text":"I've been to Barb's multiple times for brunch - I am a huge diner fan, and I love the food. Veg-wise it's (of course) a bit lacking in options, but the Florentine omelette is really good. I especially love the potatoes that come with it. Also, it's like $6, which is pretty great. I'm definitely a savory-food person, but once I was inspired to try one of their specials (written on a small white board - ask or you might miss them!), which was cinnamon french toast, and that was also really good.  The staff are super friendly and funny. Basically all the waitresses give off this Golden Girls/Sassy grandma vibe. They are, however, on the slow side. Usually they forget who was supposed to wait on you at some point in the process.  So, I wouldn't come hangry, for sure."}
{"text":"Yum, I'm glad that I've finally gotten to experience Barb's. Bobby declined for a month every time i offered since it's easier to just grab breakfast in Oakland or downtown.   I've become a little non-existent on yelp lately due to my urge to learn to cook (& cook well!) I've been making dinner at home and packing my lunch daily, so breakfast at Barbs last Saturday (which was also our 2-year special date) was our first time eating out in a good month.   I ordered the traditional breakfast; 3 eggs, home fries, choice of meat & toast. Bobby ordered the kitchen sink after I informed him that many people on yelp recommended that option. He was satisfied and I think its pretty awesome you get to choose the 3 meats in your kitchen sink omelet.   Speaking of that, when I asked if they had sausage patties i was surprised to hear yes but even more happy that they had 3 different options in the sausage patty category (score!)   There were a few mishaps but we never mentioned them to server because the food was still delicious. (minor mishaps.. wrong sausage, no onions/peppers on home fries after requested & never given an option on toast. we were just brought out Italian) None of these were too big of a deal, but I thought there should be a reason behind my rating... Im sure any of the workers would have bent over backwards to fix the issue if we had brought it up. Everyone was friendly!   We'll be back and I'm sure next time it'll be even better. I have to mention the coffee is great and the cup is bottomless."}
{"text":"If you want a home cooked breakfast in a place where everyone talks to each other - Barbs is your place. Had a potato pancake which was huge and incredible. Plus some eggs and toast. The best part is that we spent our Sunday morning talking to the tables next to us as well as the incredible staff. Will go back as often as I can"}
{"text":"came in here and it was mostly empty, a few table and the bar had customers.  Wait staff ignored us for 15 minutes, refusing to make eye contact or acknowledge we were sitting there.  no menu, no water nothing.  after awkwardly over hearing them say something about how this, \"is not a chinese restaurant\" referring to something written on the specials menu  (and being the only Asian-American in the place) we just got up and left."}
{"text":"One broke Sunday morning we decided that we had to enjoy our short weekend after a 6 day work week. You know, make it feel like we did something; spent some money...   I read somewhere that this place is reasonably priced, and it's true. We had breakfast for $4 each; poached eggs (my favorite, I must add), toast and home fries. One option for also $4 had meat, too. Coffee was only $1.35 with constant refilling. The service is fantastic, unless we got lucky and had the nicest waitress in the city.   We were there at around 1 pm. Two guys next to us were having lunch and the plates looked appetizing.   People just kept coming in. The place is not big, even though it looks it from the outside. Large crowds came in and sat at the enclosed patio they have on the side.  We are definitly going back to try other menu items!"}
{"text":"Great little neighborhood spot I order or stop at least once a week (more lately). Food is great. Servings are big and filling. Service is friendly. Love to see the mix of people in this spot on a busy morning.  Hoping that when I move I can find another gem just like this!"}
{"text":"Delicious food! We go there for brunch. They always have good specials and it's great if you're hung over. Everything I have had there, I have liked. I do wish they had a soda machine instead of bottles. You can beat a good, cheap, local, mom and pop breakfast diner though!!"}
{"text":"Barb's is a great little greasy spoon. Prices are right, the portions don't leave you wanting and they were very accommodating to my wife and young son's needs.  My most recent visit found me indulging in the Southern Style breakfast. Home fries, biscuits and gravy, and 2 eggs. Everything was delicious. I always enjoy Barb's and will go back again and again."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I recently moved to the neighborhood and he's a big diner fan for breakfast so we decided to check this place out. That visit will be the first and last visit to this place, we both had probably 2 of the worst breakfasts we've ever had.   He ordered standard eggs, bacon, toast, a pancake and side of sausage. I ordered an omelet with toast and hashbrowns. I could already tell that this place was going to be a doozy when I asked if I could have cheddar cheese in my omelette instead of American and they told me it would be $1 upcharge. I didn't really want to add another $1 on my meal, so I skipped the upcharge option.   When our meals came out, everything on my boyfriends plate was cold. The eggs were overcooked and somehow even the bacon was gross and cold. The worst part of my meal was the cheese they put inside my omelet was definitely a Kraft single. I don't really consider those to be real cheese. So, basically if you want real cheese in your omelette it's an upcharge. My food was not very good overall either. The toast was cold and the hashbrowns had no flavor. I don't expect a mind blowing foodie experience from a diner, but I do expect the food to at least be warm and for them to use cheese one step up from Kraft singles. We defiantly won't be back. If you're looking for a greasy spoon, Ritters is much much better."}
{"text":"We've been to Barb's a couple of times for breakfast/brunch on the weekend. This is a very unassuming diner; if you aren't paying attention you'll go right by it. While simply furnished with older booths and stools, it is very clean and seems well maintained. We last went at 9:30 on a Sunday, and while they were busy it wasn't overcrowded and we didn't need to wait for a seat, which was a welcome change from some of the other breakfast-only places in Pittsburgh. The clientele was a mixture of \"hipsters\", families, and regulars.  As people have mentioned the food is inexpensive. Notice that I didn't say cheap, since it was very good. I was pleasantly surprised by the pancakes, especially given the price. They were tasty and fluffy, not bland as I expected. The breakfasts we had (mostly eggs, potatoes and bacon) was very good. The home fries needed some more crusty bits and salt but otherwise were very good.  Note that they take Visa and MasterCard if the bill is over $10, which is nice.  The servers are all very friendly servers, and our waitress last time was very efficient, as we needed to leave quickly due to an appointment. It was much appreciated, especially since she seemed busy.  Unfortunately it's a little out of the way for us, but we'll be looking to go there the next time we have a hankering for breakfast food while in Lawrenceville."}
{"text":"This is a breakfast and lunch diner, so if you are arriving after 3pm chances are Barb's has already closed for the day. This little diner is a quirky, neighborhood eatery where a lot of regulars and locals can be seen on a daily basis. Almost everything on the menu is made fresh.   Our usual order: Chicken Noodle Soup Ham and Cheese Omelet and Home Fries with Onions well-done and Italian Toast Three Eggs Poached Medium, Extra-soft Bacon, Italian Toast and home fries with onion well done  Sometimes we might add in some wings or some pancakes, but it is rare. The wings take quite a while to cook as they are made to order, but their flavor is rather good. All of the breakfast items are stable, are cooked properly every time, and won't kill your pocketbook.   My only issue with Barb's is that they don't have butter. I will usually get my toast dry because of this fact."}
{"text":"Small, cheap, quick, friendly, and DELICIOUS!!!!!!!!  wow, for under 7 dollars I had a breakfast feast!  Perfection was found in three perfectly scrambled eggs, expertly fried potatoes, wonderfully toasted italian, and a precisely grilled sausage patty.   Staff was on it, my coffee mug never, ever dropped below the half way mark!!!!  Oh yeah and they open before anyone, 4 am... Before the rooster is even awake.  Treat yourself, you'll leave feeling like my coffee..warm full and goooooood"}
{"text":"Old school is the term. Come here if you want to forget its 2016 and sit shoulder to shoulder with the state police."}
{"text":"Great home cooked food. Exactly what we were looking for. We ordered breakfast. JoAnn was our waitress. She was courteous and knowledgeable. Her recommendations were spot on. She kept our coffee filled. The food came quickly and was hot & well cooked. Parking was easy and the price was great. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great place for a quick and cheap breakfast. The paper menus are pure trash but other than that I had zero complaints."}
{"text":"This is a one of a kind dive diner! Great breakfast food! Local, quick and easy! Our server BJ was the highlight just an awesome dude !!! Food was fresh and came out quick!"}
{"text":"Just visiting Pittsburgh!   Walked about a mile from our apartment to this spot cause it was the highest rated breakfast spot in the area. Needless to say it compares to a Denny's food wise but has a small town feel inside. Everything was mediocre from the service to the food!"}
{"text":"A local, down home Pittsburgh gem! If you are looking for a comfy, solid breakfast at an amazing price, Barb is your girl.  I gotta say, I am a fan of knowing that I am going to get big portions and nice service before walking in the door of an establishment. Call it ESP, foodie intuition or a keen eye for restaurant signage. Either way, I got both. Barbs is kinda small, with an outdoor patio that they open up in the summer. Haphazard knick-knacks, dusty photos (a really odd one of an out of focus hummingbird in a wooden frame that confused my dining pal and me), and a corner TV contribute to the ambiance. Lots of locals chatting about sports and why so and so is an a-hole and can't catch a ball to save his life. If any of this is reminiscent of a relatives' home around the holidays, or sounds vaguely familiar, Barb is your girl. Or you are also a western pa native. :)  I ordered the veggie omelet, tomatoes, mushrooms and green peppers with egg whites only, wheat toast and hash browns/potatoes. Nice, solid and tasty with a good amount of veggies. I'm always a fan of the egg white option as well. The potatoes were not doused in grease and butter, but pretty light and fresh and cut in nice chunks! Even though I gave the rest of mine to my pal (as I mentioned, the omelet was pretty big!) they were enjoyed!  I would like to be a repeat offender of Barbs, and plan on asking the server what's up with the hummingbird photo next time. And re-ordering those potatoes!"}
{"text":"We went here for a late hungover Saturday lunch. It got the job done.   It has the typical charming diner environment with quick and short, but still friendly service.   I was on the fence between three or four stars, but opted for for because of the decent amount of food you get for the price. I mean, it's pretty cheap, and they fill your plate up.    I was channeling my inner fat kid that day, and went with the junk yard dog. It had a pile of things on it including chili, onions, cole slaw, and cheese. It wasn't amazinggg, but it was still pretty good!   And they have quite a few unique, quirky things on their menu, love it!  I'd go here again."}
{"text":"I am surprised people find this to be \"cheap\" breakfast---you can get much cheaper breakfast in NYC at almost any diner. Anyway...  It took quite awhile for a waitress to come over, even though it wasn't busy. We waited a long time for everything. And after all of that wait, my food was undercooked and bland. It was kind of disappointing, because I LOVE diner food."}
{"text":"Solid, cute little diner with views of the gorgeous Allegheny Cemetery.  My boyfriend and I visited Pittsburgh last weekend and our AirBnB was close by, so we decided to give Barb's a shot. We got there probably around 9am on a Sunday and it was unsurprisingly busy. There were people from all walks of life here, and the waitresses were all colorful, friendly people. Despite being busy, we were greeted the moment we walked in, and were told to pick any table. We picked a small table near the window, which allowed us to enjoy the late summer/early autumn sun through the Halloween-decorated windows. My boyfriend got coffee which was refilled regularly.  I ordered the sweet potato poutine with fried eggs, he got a ham omelette. Overall, it was very good diner food. He enjoyed his omelette and its home fries. My sweet potato poutine was good - I really liked the fried spicy cheese curds, but I'm pretty sure my waffle fries were just regular potato, not sweet potato, which was a bit of a bummer.  Still delicious though, especially with the runny egg yolks (Mmmm...)  If you're looking for a solid, fairly priced diner after a wild night out (or, yaknow, because diner food is just good), this is a great choice!"}
{"text":"This little restaurant intrigued me every time we went by it.  Today we were going to a craft show next door and decided to eat there before we went.  Barb's is a mix of vintage and modern-in a weird way.  You can eat outside, on the \"porch\" (as I call it) or inside.  We chose inside.  We picked a small table against the wall.  It was busy for a diner at 1pm.  Our drink orders were taken quickly and we were brought water in these tumblers that looked like the mugs that bartenders use to make Mules.  They definitely keep your drink cold.  Then menu was big and they have four specials.  I went for the Southern platter.  It was eggs, home fries, biscuits, and sausage gravy.  Our waitress was really nice and kept checking on us.  It took a while to get our food but when they brought it, it looked and smelled wonderful.  My eggs were almost soft scrambled and I prefer a more hard scrambled egg but when you eat them with gravy it doesn't really matter.  LOL. The biscuits were a nice size and very soft.  The home fries were really good.  They had a little crispness around the edges but pillowy soft in the middle.  The gravy?  NAILED IT!  I'm from the south so I know good sausage gravy.  This was it!  It wasn't too peppery.  It was the perfect consistency.  I had small bits of sausage in it.  YUMMMMMM My hubby ordered the Ham BBQ.  I tried it and call me crazy but the BBQ sauce had a pickle juice taste.  Sometimes you taste vinegar but this seriously tasted like they had used pickle juice.  My husband loved it.  I wasn't a huge fan and I love pickles.  The fries were fresh cut and the coleslaw was a hit.  We are adding it to our small selection of breakfast places."}
{"text":"Great little diner!  Stopped in because it was on our way to the zoo. The servers were super friendly and made us feel right at home. Great menu items and specials,and the food was awesome.  Who doesn't like country fried steak and cherry cheesecake waffles."}
{"text":"The sausage biscuits with gravy had no sausage and the biscuits were so dry and hard they had to have been at least 3 days old. The bathroom was completely disgusting. I don't mind diner food/atmosphere when it's good and clean"}
{"text":"Just ate here for the first time, although I've lived in the neighborhood for years. Ordered the tuna melt. It was awesome!!!! Hot and melty. LOVE IT. Probably won't ever order anything else. Very nice waitress, actually had 2 waitresses checking on us and filling up my coffee as they went by. Liked the hometown diner feel. Will definitely be back!  For an Ice Tea, coffee, OJ, eggs benedict, and tuna melt, our tab ran $22. Not too bad."}
{"text":"Exactly what you want breakfast to be. Yummy, greasy, fast, and friendly. A real gem."}
{"text":"Classic diner service! If you want a hometown diner experience, Barb's is the place to go. This family-oriented restaurant is serious about the food and customers too.   Our waitress is exactly what you would expect from a mom and pop diner, kind, funny and quick on her toes. Think you favorite aunt helping your mom and grandma cook your favorite breakfast.   You couldn't ask for more from a diner: cheap, quick and tasty. Try one of the specials like the southwestern skillet or peach cobbler french toast to get the full hometown diner experience! Happy dining!"}
{"text":"Super reasonable and the prices are awesome for breakfast! Only giving it three stars because they put nacho cheese sauce on my eggs Benedict instead of hollandaise but then again, totally my fault for ordering eggs Benedict at a diner :)"}
{"text":"Barb's is not pretty on the outside, but you know by the looks of it that it is gonna be good. This is a true Pittsburgh diner; the portions are big and the prices are small. Just the way we like 'em in Pittsburgh. I ordered an omelet and coffee. The omelet was cooked properly and had lots of meat and cheese on the inside. You will never have to wait for a coffee refill and the good thing is that the waitress didn't ask us every time she came by if we wanted coffee. She just kept topping us off every couple of minutes."}
{"text":"Yum! We've been searching for a diner we like in Pittsburgh, and we finally found it!   --A clean but no-nonsense interior --Friendly waitresses who don't play favorites --Good quality food (I loved the Florentine omelette) that is not soaked grease --Specials on the board --Fair prices  I can't wait to be back!  Thanks, Barb, for bringing us everything a diner is supposed to be!  Note: $10 min for CC purchase"}
{"text":"Delicious food and reasonably priced.  The staff was friendly, but slow. The bathrooms could use a lot of work and did not have a way to dry your hands. The paper towels were located at the register instead of in the bathroom."}
{"text":"My partner and I wanted to hit the Vintage Mixer early, and after a fruitless walk-around, we ended up finding better stuff across the street at the Thriftique, and we'd worked up a bargain hunter hunger. So we ended up dropping into Barb's for breakfast. I'd been there once or twice before, but wanted to write a review when it was 'fresh' in my mind...fresh...like the breakfast.  Barb's really is a gem of a diner, with a comfortable unpretentious atmosphere, reasonable prices, like a diner should have, and good food.  The clientele displays a broad mix of characters, from regular college students, to tragic hipsters, to local color, and reggler folk. In my eyes, that spells success...something for everyone.   We ordered coffee, and I ordered the sort of kitchen sink omelette, with multiple meats, and my better half ordered the daily special which was a cheesy, spicy spinach egg dish. Both came with toast and home fries. I had the rye, he had the white.  When the omelette arrived, mine was packed full of onions and bell peppers, which I can't eat. Apparently, I didn't read the fine print. There were two categories of omelettes, those WITH pepper and onions, and another category without. The waitress was going to take it back, but we decided to just switch our breakfasts. The special was really delicious. Cheesy eggs with spinach and a nice kind of 'hot sauce' spice mixed in. The waitress actually really probed about the special because she'd not tried it, and was curious. I highly recommended it.   The home fries were...well...home fries. But to my glee, they were well cooked, and not smothered in onions, as many places tend to do. There's nothing worse, in my opinion, than those boiled potatoes, with just a 'touch' of fried to them, and semi-translucent onion globs thrown in for 'flavor'. I'd do hash browns all the time if I could, but Barb's does the home fries in a decent way.   The waitress kept the coffee filled, and was very helpful (I was short one butter pat for my toast), and basically everyone that passed by kept an eye out and were very friendly.  The menu is a quite varied typical diner menu, with plenty of options to choose from, and the portions are generous, and NOT overpriced, unlike Deluca's or Pamela's. In the five years that I worked next to Deluca's, I watched the portions shrink, and become more Sysco truck-ized, and the prices go up. And the few times I've ever been to Pamela's, if the Coney Island sideshow wait staff didn't put me off, the check did.  I now have two top notch diners to haunt occasionally. Mullin's and Barb's. At those two, I know I'm getting real diner food, just like diner food SHOULD be, in a real diner setting, with a real diner staff...and a real diner check at the end. No foof, no pretense, just a good meal at a fair price.  Thank goodness!"}
{"text":"We popped in here once, awhile back, because it looked like precisely the kind of local greasy spoon that I live for. However, when I asked if they had any sort of dairy-free milk for my coffee (I have a SEVERE allergy, and told the waitress this), I was scowled at and told that, \"We don't have that nasty sh*t here.\" Can you say yikes? Generally when I ask and nothing dairy-free is available, I get a polite response and take my coffee black. No complaints, and no problems, right?  Not at Barb's, apparently. We got up and left before even reviewing the menu."}
{"text":"Great greasy spoon place for breakfast and for lunch.  I had the Southern something platter.  Biscuits, sausage gravy and eggs.  I had wheat toast instead of the biscuits because I'm healthy!  Food was great. I loved that I could get the gravy and eggs on one platter.  Lots of places, in my experience, seem to want to make you pay a lot extra for that simple combo.  Dining room was beyond basic and the place felt very \"local.\"  I (alone-dining, Pittsburgh newbie yuppie woman) was a little nervous at first but everyone was super-friendly.  Customers and staff alike.  Barb's is right across the corner from the Teamster's meeting place.  Bound to be good!  They close at 3, not 2."}
{"text":"I hate this place... They don't have cheese all they have is this disgusting liquid cheese. I almost vomed when I looked at my eggs Benedict and it was smothered in nacho cheese. Our waitress was so rude!!!!! Gave us dirty looks and I felt that she hated her job and was annoyed we were coming to eat breakfast. Sat out on \"deck area\" and there were fly trappers hanging from the ceiling. Never coming back!!!!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I walked in here around 11 on a Saturday morning and they got slightly busy as soon as we sat down, which affected the service and ultimately the food. Don't get me wrong, my order was still good - I got the Florentine omelet with spinach, garlic, and provolone, which was very flavorful. The problem was with the kitchen and/or server communication with my wife's order. She had asked for her poached eggs to be extra well, because she doesn't like a runny yolk, and she also asked for her toast to be extra well also. Both came out the exact opposite (runny eggs and soft bread). My wife, who is not one to shy away from complaining if she doesn't get what she ordered, felt uncomfortable saying anything because (1) the waitress was so overwhelmed she seemed annoyed when we asked for stuff (like the side of salsa we ordered) and (2) because she didn't come around very often. The other servers were the ones who constantly filled our coffee cups.  We will probably give Barb's another chance, because the food was good. The service just could have been better."}
{"text":"The food is great, but the service was horrible. There was 4 of us. They messed our order up, the group who came after us as well as another man were served and ate before us. Our food didnt come out at the same time so two of the 4 of us were finished with the food by the time the other one order came out she looked at the last person not eating and asked \"you already finished yours\" meanwhile he had no empty plates in front of him. It was awful. She just stood there like...you really didnt get your food? No we're lying to you (sarcasm)...so then she went back and finally brought his order out, after the 3 of us were done eating. I dont understand how they have such a high rating. Maybe it was just an off day, but this was by far the worst service all 4 of us experienced within a resteraunt. Oh and we never got our change nor did either of which ever 2 waiters we had said thank you."}
{"text":"Came in the afternoon for a lunch. I asked if the burgers were good and was told \" he makes the best\" so I gave it a go. I was told that the burgers come with lettuce, tomato, and onion. I ordered a bacon cheeseburger, medium with a side of onion rings. What I got was a cheeseburger overcooked and dry, plain with a side of onion rings. I told the waitress what I ordered and she fixed it right away. Like I said the burger was overcooked and very dry and had been pre frozen from Sams club or restaurant warehouse, not a fresh made burger.The toppings were fresh (tomato, onion and lettuce) and they didn't skimp on the bacon. The onion rings were dried out and had no flavor, also from frozen.   This may have been my fault because when I first came in, the waitress had recommended the specials that she said was homemade, from scratch. I always try to give a place another try unless it's really bad, so I will update when I get the chance"}
{"text":"The food isn't something that's going to make you do back-flips but its filling, there's a lot of it and the menu has an above average selection.  Whether you are getting breakfast before the sun rises or taking an out-of-the-office lunch break, this is a relaxed place to enjoy food, people watch and if you have enough time you can burn off some of the calories with a brisk walk through the Allegheny Cemetery right across the street. Sometimes the service and food can be hit or miss but if you get something that isn't to your liking they don't balk and making it right (or at least the way you ordered it)"}
{"text":"Cute little diner hidden on a curve between lower and upper Lawrenceville. We came here for Sunday brunch, craving some delicious breakfast food.  I think I almost had a heart attack at how CHEAP it was.  For barely $4 you get eggs, a choice of meat and toast.  I mean, seriously!  I actually opted for the Country Omelet, which was ham and provolone cheese, onions, peppers, mushrooms and tomatoes.  It was an packed omelet with a crap ton of cheese!  It had to be like 3 or 4 slices!  It also came with home fries and wheat toast.  The home fries were okay, but I like crispier slices than what I got.    The service was extremely friendly.  Seriously went out of their way to check on you, get things for you and just be plain nice!  It is incredibly appreciated.  I discovered no paper towels in the the bathroom and told the server.  She whispered to me that they don't keep paper towels in the bathroom anymore, but at the front counter.  Apparently people were stuffing them in the toilet.  Um, whoever is doing that, stop it!  I want paper towels in the bathroom!  Hot Tip: They DO accept credit cards In the summer it looks like they have a super cute patio to sit out on!"}
{"text":"This is what a breakfast spot should be like. Fair prices and delicious. My coffee cup never went below half full, and my eggs were made just right, which at times can be hard to come by at busy restaurants."}
{"text":"The 3 egg Breakfast Special is now 4.99 but still an awesome deal. Add a buck and get turkey sausage!"}
{"text":"New place I wanted to try out . I'm very glad I did. Had a breakfast sandwich with home fries. Very basic but tasty. Daughter had eggs ,toast ,home fries and we shared the pancakes . Everything was great! Great prices for the food and the servers were all super sweet."}
{"text":"Had breakfast this morning at Barb's. Its a quaint place. Lots of pictures on the wall along with posters. Its a seat yourself, with tables and booths. There are also tables and chairs outside in a fenced off area to have your food served. Very nice staff. The menu has something for everyone.  I had the 3 meat omelet, (without   peppers and onions) with home fries, Italian toasted bread, bacon on the side, coffee. The service was quick. Coffee was kept filled. I must admit, that omelet was one of the best I have had in some time. The flavor was like no other omelet I've tasted. Don't know what they use for seasoning, but hope they don't stop using it. I was there on a Friday morning about 8:45 am. There were seats available, with customers coming and going. Variety of customers. From tradesmen, locals, hipsters, and seniors. They also have about a 10 seat lunch counter. I will definitely visit Barb's again. You get plenty of food for a reasonable price."}
