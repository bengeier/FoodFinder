{"text":"Ce nouveau restaurant est très bien décoré et le buffet est immense. Le style de nourriture est très varié donc il y en a pour tout les goûts. Et c'est délicieux. J'enlève une étoile pour le service. Après qu'une serveuse ait échappé un plateau, elle a sacrer et a ensuite donné un coup de pied sur une chaise haute de bébé (qui heureusement était vide) et à quitté furieusement. Plus tard, elle s'est mis à \"chialer\" a voix basse a cause qu'elle arrivait difficilement à passer à un endroit. Bref, ce n'était pas sa soirée je crois!!!! Mais pour nous, c'était un manque de professionnalisme et c'était désagréable!"}
{"text":"Wanted to try this place for a while! Finally went for supper last Friday, the line up was insane! Waited over half and hour and they said this was a slow day. The place is huge, the decor is really nice and they have lots of variety of foods. The food was not bad, however it was typical buffet style food. The buffet area was also really crowded."}
{"text":"Simply delicious! So many foods to choose from, from Italian to Chinese to Greek and so much more. The deserts are very tasty too. Being as it is located in Quebec, you will find culinary staples such as poutine and  the delicious pudding chaumeur!  If you are not a fan of crowds, I would avoid this place, as it can be quite busy. Thankfully the tables are far enough apart that people don't get squished together. The buffet serving centres are a touch on the crowded side, however. Not a quiet dining experience, especially on a Saturday night, as lots of kids come out with their families. Also, while this is not necessarily a bad thing, the dining area is a bit dark."}
{"text":"I called to make a reservation and they refused to speak English to me. So if you only speak English good luck you'll have a tough time. I would recommend a place that can accommodate everyone which all restaurants should do. If you own a restaurant you should have people who speak both languages even though she spoke and was able to understand English she just refused to."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of the food at this place. I usually avoid buffets but this was a work lunch and I had to attend. They had a good variety of foods and everything I tasted was above average for buffet food. The salad bar looked fresh and inviting.  I still think  buffets are too expensive though for what I personally eat. It was 15$ for lunch."}
{"text":"C'est un buffet avec tout ce que ça implique. C'est pratique lorsque les enfants veulent manger rapidement, chacun trouve ce qu'il veut. Le service est bien. Je mange pratiquement toujours de la salade dans les buffets et le bar à salade est médiocre. Même les enfants ne trouve pas la nourriture très bonne."}
{"text":"I generally don't eat at buffets unless I'm in Vegas, so I wasn't expecting to love this place when I was invited to a dinner here...that being said....  This place gets full marks on Vegas style decor with its giant Eiffle tower gracing the front entrance. The rest of the decor was pretty cute too playing up the \"international\" decor.   They had a lot of food and there were different cuisines available - Chinese dishes, pasta, deep fried things, hotdogs, lots of veggies, seafood etc. None of the food was particularly impressive or authentic but it was all edible.   Dessert consisted of some jello and ice cream and fried dough balls which were pretty tasty when doused with chocolate syrup."}
{"text":"The food was great tasty and fresh they had Mexican night Saturday and the theme was a success. The mexican ban was playing old fashion mexican music. Would go back again."}
{"text":"Yark. Cuisine limité et surtout ambiance gâchée par un patron despotique qui traitées employés comme du bétail. A éviter à tout prix."}
{"text":"It's a buffet! It's busy! It's busy!   If you like food at a buffet then this place is good for you. The food is nice, some tasty and others not so good.  I did like the seafood and few other stuff, but the salads, Italian and grill were not so good.   I went there with family and Friends, the service was good and they were very nice. It was overcrowded but the seating was comfortable and you can walk to the buffet and back without hassle.   Most importantly it was clean.   You should give it a visit and you be the judge !"}
{"text":"Came here during lunch and I was actually surprised by the variety of food you can get for 12.99$: from soups, pizza, sushi, chinese stir fried dishes, etc. They even serve stir fried clams and mussels for that price!!! As for the taste, it's pretty decent for a buffet at first, especially when you're starving. However, like any other buffet, after being half full, you start to realize the food actually isn't that good, but for 12.99$, what more can you ask for?   The service is very good. Our waitress was nice and friendly and came to refill our water and clean up our plates many times.   The restaurant is huge. It is nicely decorated and you have sections with a theme such as paris, greece, etc.   Overall, it's a great place with a huge variety of food for a cheap price. Although the quality of the food isn't amazing, it's very decent for a buffet. Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Surreal Disney-like interior seats 500 people. Wide variety of plentiful, mediocre food. Mostly Québécois versions of foods from around the world. Carvery not too bad, salads disappointing, tons of fried items. Lots of very happy children. Kids under 12 eat free which made the $21/pp slightly easier to bear. None of the desserts made with real cream. Seemed clean enough- noticed a lot of quality control in the buffet, ensuring platters were kept near and filled. Despite all that, the bizarre interior and strolling, live mariachi band made this a fun night out with the kids. Not sure we will be back."}
{"text":"Not bad . Not bad, but for 1 and half hour waiting, I don't think it's worthwhile . The decor is actually the most stunning part, the service is good too. And the selection of the food is mostly good, except the sushi part, which is horrible... if they can do better sushi, not this crap \"sushi\" Like-ish stuff, I would give it a 4 stars."}
{"text":"This is the food Mecca of the south shore in terms of space! I literally never knew there was this many people in Brossard alone! The decor is beautiful- a Las Vegas kind of feel-with an Eiffel Tower in the Center of the food court followed by little settings of Italy and Greece.   There is no reservation system - you go and wait in line and put your name on a list. The wait was short for a Sunday evening-15 mins for 2 ppl. We were escorted by a hostess to our table and then went to explore the buffet.   The concept is an all you can eat buffet with a multicultural menu . By multicultural- I mean fast food , sushi and Chinese food . Nothing really caught my attention as authentic or multicultural in particular - the souflaki was good but overall I wasn't hugely satisfied by the quality of food. And people were gluttonous - turn off.  To name a few choices from the menu : Sushi bar Cold and cooked seafood (cold seafood was shady- keeping seafood out that long concerns me) Chinese food Breads Grilled and smoked meats Soup and salad bar Greek souflaki/gyros Italian pastas and pizza bar  Dessert lacked significant variety- but contained the typical-jello, cake and ice cream display. Pudding chomeur was good.   It came out to 26$ plus 3$ for coffee or tea we thought were complimentary.  Would I come back here, no. Its noisy, loud overcrowded with low grade food. Stick to Vegas!"}
{"text":"The holy grail of non-sushi buffet,  that ironically does serve sushi.  I read great things about this chain of buffets but the distance always scared me away.  I finally decided to take the plunge and (after a huge detour to avoid paying 2x$8.50 in bridge toll fees)  we achieved our goal to overeat.  The food was mostly good, which means amazing for buffet food.  The selection was huge, mostly Italian, Chinese and Greek. I had two huge plates and finished them both. The sushi in question amounts to three huge platters with generic rolls.  The standout for me was souvlaki and pasta made on the spot.  The dessert was better than most as well  We were very happy with our waitress Josée, who was very nice.  The restaurant deserves a special mention,  huge ceilings mean the buffet smell is not as present, some might consider the mini Eiffel tower and other decorations as cheesy, but it did not bother me.  One weird thing I found was the bathroom on the second floor, odd to make hundreds of people go up and down the stairs, but it's a very minor point.  The location itself is really far from Montreal,  the other locations are even further,  the drive during a heavy downpour was not fun."}
{"text":"Le service est très mauvais, il y a une limite de deux heures pour manger si on fait une réservation. De plus mensonge au téléphone, la réceptionniste raconte que la file sera très longue mais en arrivant il n'y en a pas. Aussi, elle raconte que le buffet sera fermé à 21h00 mais vers 8h30 plus rien ne sort. Par contre, Beaucoup de plats à choisir qui sont très bon."}
{"text":"First time I went for lunch.... Decent variety of food. As for the taste it's exactly what you would expect from a buffet.  Cooks were constantly going as fast as they could to refill the empty trays. Service was good as-well, water/coffee were constantly being refilled at a good pace. Although, the one thing I didn't like was our waitress bringing the bill way before I asked for it. It felt like she was trying to rush us out.  2nd time going for supper.... CHANGE TO MY REVIEW: went back for supper on Saturday. There was a HUGE line but when I went inside to see it how packed it was tables were 90% empty!! Doors we're suppose to open at 4:30 they opened only at 5:30! Get your stuff in order AHEAD OF TIME! We were a group of 10 people, we just kept watching the manger take groups of 4-5 people. I mean how hard is it to stick 2 tables together to accommodate the bigger groups.  Owner/manager came to ask us what how our experience was? We replied it's was ok. She did not look pleased. Could have said something along the lines of I'm sorry what can we do to improve your experience or something. But nope,instead she just looked unhappy and said thank you and walked away.  Wouldn't go there again. Went from giving a 4* down to a 1*."}
{"text":"souper les fins de semaine bon mais extrement bruyant. Buffet dejeuner a eviter ( je n y suis alle qu une seule fois au dejeuner)."}
{"text":"On one hand, the food is good to ok, the location is really great and the decor is... Well grand?  But, a month ago we had a birthday there. We had paid a reservation fee to make sure everything would go well. They took the money but forgot us. On top of making everybody wait we got almost kicked out because an other group was coming.  I pointed out that if we could have access our seat at the right time and not 45 minutes late, we would have ample time to eat. But they turned a blind eye to us.  For the record. We were a group of 50 at the time.   Mindful of this I would never make reservations again there. For a quick bite of pizza between friends I wouldn't mind.  But even after a month. I'm still a bit mad. I still can't believe they took the reservation's down but didn't bother call us or talk to us when we called to make a last check up 48 hours prior."}
{"text":"Plutôt ordinaire et franchement cher pour ce que c'est, puis c'est vraiment bruyant là dedans. Quant à payer ce prix pour une variété de plats dont aucun ne m'apporte de satisfaction réelle, je suis aussi bien d'aller payer la même chose ailleurs pour un plat qui lui me plaira."}
{"text":"Il y a beaucoup de choix, l'endroit est beau, mais la nourriture n'a absolument rien d'extraordinaire. Selon moi, ça ne vaut pas du tout 25$ par personne."}
{"text":"Avez-vous faim?  Oui, bien sur.  Are you hungry?  Yes, of course.  If you are hungry and like foods from different parts of the world, decently prepared, with a lot of variety, with friendly enough service, and at reasonable prices, Buffet des Continents might be your cup of tea.  If you are a food snob, move along, there's nothing to see.  Buffet des Continents is just that - a buffet and one with foods from different continents, primarily North America, Europe, and Asia.  The decor is super kitsch but that's what also makes it fun.  It almost feels as if one is on the \"It's a Small World\" ride at Disneyland, but while eating at a buffet.  In the St.-Jerome location, the massive eating space cleverly has an interior column disguised as the leaning Tower of Pisa.  It's tacky but hilarious.  In seeing the photos for the location at Mascouche, also a far flung suburb of Montreal on the Rive Nord, the column in their large dining room is disguised as the Eiffel Tower.  Note that there are 6 Buffet des Continents in Quebec.  Only 2 are in the greater Montreal area, with both being on the Rive Nord (North Shore).  They don't even have one in closer-in Laval which tends to have all the chain places, not to mention lots of parking at its commercial centers.  The other locations are in Quebec City, Sherbrooke, Gatineau (Ottawa area), and, badda bing, Trois-Rivieres.  I could see Buffet des Continents as being a \"happening place\" in sleepy Trois-Rivieres!  The main food types are North American, Italian, Greek, Mexican, and Asian.  You can sample a little bit of this and that, or you can concentrate on the cuisines you like.  Also, since they have various desserts and they are good, save some room for indulging in those.   Most people appear to be getting soft drinks, coffee, or tea, which they can refill. In my case, I \"stockpiled\" some American, Italian, and Greek food.  I like Mexican and Asian (Chinese) food, but the selection of what I found in my preferred cuisines filled up some two plates to begin with.  I had salads, various meats, various pastas, souvlaki, side dishes, desserts, and coffee.   I look at the other critical reviews and wonder \"WTF?\"  Where are you going to get all this food, which is good to very good, in a nice, clean, modern locale for less than $ 20 CDN, if I recall?  It's a lot nicer than any of the buffet chains encountered in the U.S., and by a wide margin.  Also, I did not see much in the way of surly service or obnoxious customers.  The server was actually quite pleasant and on point.  And, from observing the interactions at nearby tables, the same held true.  Are people expecting fine dining at this price?  Get real!  So, because it's not fine dining and because some of the dishes are simply good as opposed to great, I'm not giving Buffet des Continents 5 stars.  However, because they have tasty offerings in my favorite cuisines under one roof and in a buffet format at a very fair price, I am definitely a fan.   Quatre etoiles pour Buffet des Continents!  Four stars for Buffet des Continents!"}
{"text":"I went to this buffet with moderate expectations and they were met. True to it's namesake, the buffet will serve a variety of dishes from several countries. You basically get what you paid for."}
{"text":"Beaucoup de choix, mais rien d'extraordinaire. Le gros problème de l'endroit est qu'il doit y avoir 300 place et c'est vraiment tous collé. Donc toujours du va et viens constants. Ce qui diminue l'expérience. Ps- si vous y allez le matin, faites attention, des fois ils vont oublier de vous mentionner que vous devez quitter avant midi... Et tu te retrouve à être obligé de manger ton brunch en famille à toutes vitesse..."}
{"text":"Meh what can I say. The decor is very nice. Typical all you can eat buffet but with a little more variety than the norm including full Chinese buffet, freshly sliced roast beef, turkey, pork and smoked meat. Mashed potatoes and deserts were an embarrassment. They have different culinary events going on throughout the year. We visited them during their Mexican event. Kids under 12 eat free. 40 bucks for a family of four with two kids excluding drinks wasn't a bad deal."}
{"text":"Very impressed with this buffet, service was great from start to finish. We walked in with a party of 7 and was quickly sat even though the giant restaurant was full. We spent the day touring Montréal from Washington, DC and really wanted comfort food, this was a good one stop for all. My son loved the spare ribs, my daughter loved the mashed potatoes and gravy and my parents were very impressed with everything. There were a lot of selections and food for everyone. If we're back in Montréal, we will come back to this beautiful restaurant."}
{"text":"Well, I can't say I enjoyed it that much. I mean, there was a huge line up to get in and once we got our table, we where so hungry that I don't think we really get the chance to enjoy our food. All we wanted was to eat. For that part, they didn't dissapoint with the choices. They were filling the food so fast, I don't think any of it was sitting for too long. That a plus! This means that people are loving everything.  On my part, Some of the meat were a bit dry and I tried the pizza that was just ordinary. We did try different things but it wasn't as memorable as we though it would be.   If I would try it again, I think that would go at a time that there aren't that many people in line. And then maybe I would get the time to enjoy everything."}
{"text":"Buffet will always be a buffet. Was not really impressed by the food, but at least it was ok and clean. There were some poutine available and everyone got excited about it (however it was pretty salty). The place is quite big, nicely decorated and our waitress provided a really great service. She always refilled our water, bring up tissues and was always around to pick up every single plates."}
{"text":"Never liked buffet places & here's why... 1- Huge crowds, kids running between your legs & people pushing. 2- lots of food choices but taste wise is very average & lots of msg. 3- You cannot out stay your time, you are asked to leave after certain hours if you get there when they open. 4- staff is unprofessional due sometimes to bad customers.   I can go on but I think it is enough negative as an experience will definitely not go back"}
{"text":"Mieux qu'un buffet chinois. Propre. Bien pour le type de buffet qu'il est. La nourriture est bien présenté, par contre très salée. Pas mon type de restaurant mais les enfants aiment y aller."}
{"text":"An excellent \"buffet\" resto. Tons of choices, Asian, Italian, Greek,  a variety of roasts, smoked meat. Inexpensive, great for kids, lots of room, friendly staff, large parking lot. Great value."}
{"text":"Si tu aimes ça manger comme un petit cochon ici c'est ta place. Un peu de tout, beaucoup trop dispendieux pour le genre de repas."}
{"text":"This is one of the best buffets near Montreal in my opinion. It is far but the price is cheap and their have a lot of variety. The dessert variety is not that great but the dinner dishes are good. My favorite items to eat are the osso bucco, pizza and chicken wings. On the weekends it gets really busy so make sure you go early to avoid the line up."}
{"text":"Je suis déçue parce que j'en avais beaucoup entendu parler et je crois que je m'étais fait trop d'attente. C'est beau à l'intérieur (quoique beaucoup trop grand), mais la bouffe est aussi ordinaire que dans les autres buffets. C'est semi-chaud, semi-croquant, semi-mou, semi-goûteux. Je n'ai pas aimé et je ne crois pas y retourner.   Les prix sont corrects, 15$ le dîner et 23$ le soir. Pour les enfants, c'est gratuit!"}
{"text":"The brunch isn't so bad on a Sunday morning but I wish they could have more choices in the menu. That way, people cant try everything and they will come back to try the rest the next time. I like that you can choose to eat a regular meals for brunch especially if your typical eggs, pancakes and hash brown aren't your type. The quality of the food available is not too shabby either.  The decorations are varied, there are 5 countries decoration in the room.    The service is pretty good. The staffs made sure you enjoyed your stay in the buffet and the water is always refilled. The coffee and black teas are free of charge and you get refilled. The food plates are always emptied out of our tables before we come back with new plates.   Overall, the place is decent. I might give this place another try for dinner time when the lineup isnt so intense.  For the ones who come in groups, please come earlier. Otherwise, group of two like me go before you.  ;-)"}
{"text":"This a good place to if you dont have dinner ready in time and you have no clue on what to eat. One of the best buffet in term of all type for everybody. You have nice pho bar (highlight of this location), the broth is tasty and flavourful, very surprising so good job to the cooling crew!! Is it not all the franchise who has that pho station. You have all the food you want, from indian, beef strips DIY grill, fish, pizza, souvlaki station etc. Overall the food is good but on the salty side which is not the best for my health. The dessert station is disappointing, very generic cakes. Overall, good place to eat and price is reasonable.  During weekend, there is a seafood station like crawfish. No shame to go back :)"}
{"text":"Je suis allée au buffet des continents car je vois toujours des publicité de gens heureux et content de leur visite. J'ai fini par.y aller, un petit.ligne up mais rien de long assez vite sur le service. Pour ce qui est de la.nourriture c'est normal et raisonnable sauf qu'il n'y a rien de halah. J'ai bien manger pareil mais j'aurais bien aimé pouvoir goûter leur général taö.  C'est très grand et bien organisée dans l'espace pour circulé. Il y a même un endroit pour les enfants pour ce faire maquiller. Mini bar à l'entrée et si jamais vous voulez faire descendre le repas vous pouvez aller vois promené dans le centre d'achat Portobello! Bienvenue à brossard où tous les continents ce croisent..."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch. The food was hot. There was no waiting at the buffet and the mashed potatoes were real - not powder.  The chicken breast was super moist and the garlic spare ribs were meaty. A good variety of food.  My only complaint would be the dessert; the usual buffet fare."}
{"text":"Le service est excellent ma note ne viens pas de là mais plutôt de la propreté générale des lieux et des plats peu ragoûtants. Ça fesait des années que je n'avais pas mis les pieds dans un buffet et après cette expérience je ne suis pas prête d'y retourner c'est à n'y rien comprendre que l'endroit soit toujours bondé le soir"}
{"text":"The customer service was lacking and made us feel like second class. I made a reservation the night prior for a group of 8 and was asked to come early between 4-430pm to ensure proper seating.  We arrived there at 4:15pm and went to the line where it says reserved. My heart sank when the hostess looks at me and says there's nothing under my name.  The restaurant was %5 seated since we arrived earlier.  The hostess looks at me like I was lying.  Rather than assuring us that they must have made a mistake, they just tossed us over to the empty line for people with no reservations and moved on to the next customer with a reservation.   We were further disappointed because  they weren't serving snow crabs that night and we mainly came for this since we're seafood lovers.  Nonetheless we tried to not let this ruin our night and proceeded to just enjoy our family birthday dinner.  The food was bland and salty. We expect that, since it's a mass produced buffet.  But I've been to the Mascouche location and few times and never have been disappointed with their service or food quality.    The roasted meat were over dried sitting under the heating lamp.  Roasted lamb was not eatable (dry and hard).  Sushis were not good.  The sushi rice had no seasoning.   The list goes on... it's a buffet I know but I expect to have somewhat decent food.  The only thing i enjoyed that night was the soups ( can't miss that), the gyro they made fresh in front of you and the maple toffee they serve for the sugar shack theme night.    I would not go back to this location again.  Overall for experience and food I would give 1 out of 5.  The only thing that gave a 1 is our waitress. She was nice and attentive to our needs."}
{"text":"Je ne peux faire autrement que donner 2 étoiles au Buffet des Continents de Mascouche suite à ma première expérience à cet endroit. Je m'y suis rendue un dimanche matin à l'occasion d'un brunch familial. D'emblée, je n'aurais jamais choisi un restaurant de type buffet, par crainte d'avoir beaucoup de choix d'aliments, mais aucun de réelle qualité. Les autres membres de ma famille tenaient à y aller, je me suis donc rangée de leur côté en me disant que j'allais peut-être être agréablement surprise. Déjà en arrivant dans le stationnement, je trouvais l'ambiance très \"buzzante\". BEAUCOUP de monde. En entrant dans le resto, j'ai réalisé que l'ambiance serait de la sorte tout au long du repas. Des gens, il y en a partout. Des enfants qui courent, des parents qui crient, c'est l'ambiance à laquelle il faut s'attendre. On doit parler fort pour s'entendre à la table et redoubler de patience lorsqu'on fait le chemin difficile entre la table et le buffet. Je me suis sentie comme dans une jungle où tout le monde se pousse pour avoir droit à la dernière pointe de pizza. Ce genre de comportement me dépasse et ne rend en rien agréable mon expérience. Niveau bouffe maintenant. Il est vrai qu'on retrouve une énorme quantité de nourriture, très variée. Toutefois, ne vous attendez pas à faire des découvertes culinaires typiques. Il y a une station plus américaine (pizza, frites, rondelles d'oignon), une station de salades diverses, une station style \"cabane à sucre\" étant donné le temps de l'année (jambon dans le sirop, oreille de Christ, fèves au lard), une station asiatique avec ce qu'on retrouve habituellement dans ce genre de buffet, etc. Aucune proposition qui nous fait sortir de notre zone de confort. De toutes façons, je ne crois pas que ce soit le but de l'endroit. Je crois que la clientèle cible est plutôt les familles étant donné l'ambiance très décontractée de l'endroit et surtout le fait que les enfants de moins de 12 ans mangent gratuitement. D'ailleurs niveau prix il nous en a coûté 38$ pour 2 personnes taxes incluses. Pour une des rares fois, je considère que c'est trop cher pour la qualité des aliments que j'ai mangés. Beaucoup de sucre, de gras et de sel. Peu de goût."}
{"text":"I am big fan of this chain and have been going to the St-Jerome location regularly since its opening about 3 years ago so I am extremely excited to have this buffet right next door now!  In order to provide a fair assessment, I waited to write my review after now going 3 times in the past month. I went on opening day September 19 and it was big chaos as you can imagine there are thousands of people lined up, not enough food and every single person working there is a brand new hire so you can't expect the best just yet. I returned a week later for weekday supper and most recently for Sunday brunch and can say this place has the potential to be as great as the other branches. Good food, lots of variety and pricing is very reasonable and frankly unbeattable for what you get.  Yes there are long lines, this is normal considering it's the hottest place in town. What's annoying lately is that they don't allow groups to be seated until everyone is accounted for however as soon as the hype dies down it'll be much smoother for everyone.  TIP, try to go at opening of lunch or supper to beat the lines. So if lunch opens at 11, try to be there for 11 or 11:30.  The food varies based on lunch or dinner and day of the week. I noticed this location has more seafood than St-Jerome and always offers 4 types of sushi versus just 2 at the other location, otherwise everything else is pretty similar. Brunch is my favorite as there are eggs and omelettes made to order, pancakes, french toast, delicious breakfast sausages, bacon and all your other staples like carved meats, chinese food, seafood, pastas, fresh fruits, desserts etc. If you were to go to a regular breakfast restaurant you'd pay the same price and get almost nothing.  Kids under 12 eat free so it's very family friendly and again unbeattable compared to any other restaurants nearby.  For everyone complaining that the service is slow, keep in mind that this restaurant seats 650 people and serves THOUSANDS of people for every meal. Everyone is also new at their job so give them a break. The staff which is comprised of over 100 employees is already working as hard and fast as they can and unfortunately during opening week there was a huge lack of ressources as many workers that were just hired did not show up. I have a family member who worked during the first 2 weeks and the hours were from 9 am to 11 pm at night, sometimes later. It is very hard labor in the kitchen, prepping and cleaning for minimum wage and believe me, they are pumping out as much food as physically possible to serve everyone. All meals are also prepared fresh daily.  The owner of this establishement described it as a food FACTORY, not a restaurant.  Also just a note, the tips are shared amongst all staff, not just the servers, so maybe this will change the way you tip - even if your server wasn't awesome, everyone else working behind the scenes is deserving too.  In all I strongly recommend this place for casual lunches or suppers, group events or parties as there's something to please everyone. You will not find this much selection and freshness elsewhere."}
{"text":"One year later I wanted to post an update- This place is still doing really well and I came back for lunch recently and was even more impressed. At just 15$ a person on the weekend, you can get a delicious brunch that rivals what you would find at a regular breakfast joint. There's tons of freshly cooked bacon, prepared all kinds of ways. If you like burnt bits or undercooked mushy bacon or just in between you'll find it. Breakfast sausages, pancakes, hashbrowns, french toast, and at least 4 types of eggs (fried, scrambled, benedict, boiled..) fresh fruits, yogourt, as well as plenty of other lunch options from their standard selection like chinese food, souvlakis, pizzas etc. Did I mention it's all you can eat!? Coffee and juice are included too.  You WILL find something you like. It's unbeatable, and zero line ups this time. I went on both a Saturday and Sunday right around noon and there was no wait. Children under 12 eat FREE.  I can't wait to go back! LOVE IT"}
{"text":"I came here yesterday for lunch with my colleagues. We were a table of 8 and it took 15 min to get a table. It was super packed!! I was very surprised since it was a weekday.  I can see how it would be a good place to go with kids since they eat free and there's cotton candy and popcorn etc. When we were there they had a lady face painting the kids' faces.  It's also nicely decorated with an Eiffel Tower and had different flags.   Now for the food. It's not bad. The food was decent but I've eaten at better buffets. They had  a different soups , salads, appetizers, mains and desserts. They replenish the food pretty quickly when stuff runs out. They had different kinds of pizza which were pretty good. I was expecting more types of cuisine. There was some Italian and some Chinese food and four kinds of maki sushi. They also  had spanakopita but that was only thing Greek. My colleague said usually they have gyro stations but it wasn't open.   They did have an omelette station as well as smoked meat, pork and roast beef that they cut up in front of you. I didn't eat my roast beef because it wasn't that good and it was a bit too red and bloody for my liking! The fries and onion rings were good and the veggies too. I liked that they had a lot of veggie options for vegetarians and those who still want to eat healthy.   The desserts did not look appetizing and my colleagues were not very impressed.   I would not come back."}
{"text":"As the last reviewer mentioned, if you are hungry, like a variety of food and want to eat on a budget, this is a great place for you. But as I've always mentioned, a jack of all trades is a master of none.... and so, if you are looking for quality of ingredients and quality of execution, this is not the place to go. The Chinese section had some of the main staples like general tao, overly soy sauced fried rice and fried noodle but they were lacking in the staple but delicious chinese-buffet-fried-chicken-in-1000-year-oil, sure we don't expect crab or shrimp but at least fried chicken ? Everything else for me was a blur, the words that come to mind are fried, fried and cheesy. Oh yes, the sushi section was............ low on option, sadly executed and very very cold. Service was fantastic though and they have a makeup for kids booth. The make up artist was very sweet and patient as kids kept rolling up to get their faces drawn and left zero tip. Rating this buffet compared to others like Fu Lam and Vichy- it's very very mediocre. As they have to serve a large variety because they are \"continental\", expect to be fed and that's all."}
{"text":"Excellent buffet, it is new with a few growing pains but excellent food and service. You can't find a better deal . Quality is way above the average buffet. Will be returning."}
{"text":"This restaurant is lucky to get a 2 star from me. A very noisy place with undisciplined parents with kids that run between your legs in the isle. Incredible. The food? Nothing to brag about especially at $16. a pop. At that price, it should have been exceptional, it was NOT. An ordinary buffet like everywhere else at half the price. Very, very disappointed. It's on our BLACK list. Will NEVER return to this place or anywhere in Quebec where Buffet des Continents is established. I believe there are 8, OUCH!"}
{"text":"I am not a person for Buffets unless I am in Vegas but I was totally blown away f=by this place!!! First of all just the deco of the place was one big investment as the had it all in there including the Eiffel Tower, Greek wind mill, part of china and italy.  Then there was the food and since I am careful what I am eating they actually had lots to offer. plenty of veggies, 7 different types of pizza. A complete turkey which I had but they had roasts of all types. Which I was told are slow cooked over night. Chinese food was good esp. the spring rolls which I have a friend who makes and these were exactly like his. The owner gave me a complete tour of the place which seats 800+ yes 800. He told me saturday nite he is full. They even had private rooms for conference or weddings etc...Out door on the roof for the summer. Mind blowing. Everything is cook in house. I will be back."}
{"text":"So let me start by saying that I don't like buffet neither big commercial restaurant. This place is everything I don't like so....You'll love this place if: you enjoy a 3 stars buffet in a all inclusive resort in Cuba. The place is HUGE!!!! They can seat at least 400 hundred guests. The buffet is downstairs, a lot of tables are downstairs too. If you feel VIP or big shot I recommend to ask to be seated upstairs: even if you have to go up and down the stairs to get your food at least the noise level is more tolerable upstairs. Don't get excited the food won't get better because you work for it tho. You'll find the same type of tasteless, greasy, full of msg food. Pizza, Canadian fat gross Chinese food (egg rolls, spare ribs, cherry sauce, fried rice, etc), you can also have the looking not so fresh sushis. Of course if you like deep fried you'll be glad: fries, onion rings, calamari, frog legs, etc. Oh! We went on the Mexican night theme. So yeah. Loud Mexican music, some mariachi signing at the table (I hate that, always makes me feel sooooo awkward: should I stop eating? Should I look at them in the eyes? Should I pretend to be zen and all??) So there was also unauthentic Mexican food: rice, guacamole, tacos, sausage (don't ask), etc. And the poor staff was disguise with sombreros and Mexican outfit. I have to say: the staff was nice and helpful. Everything I ate was overly salted or overly tasteless (I'm sure it's a thing), except for the crab legs; they were good. The service  and the fresh crab legs lead me to give 2 stars. That being said I hope to never go back."}
{"text":"Comme le dit le dicton les buffets des continents se ressemblent mais ne sont pas pareil. Nous sommes habitués à celui de Saint Jérôme et comme Brossard est plus près de mon domicile nous y sommes allé confiant. Déception. De un la place est bondé comme quoi un rien excite les Brossardois. Certains plats étaient tièdes voir froid. A plusieurs occasionz les stations étaient vides et le remplissage lent. Les employés semblaient courrir comme des poules sans tête.  Nous avions même de la difficulté a obtenir de l eau de notre serveur.  Dommage mais je vais continuer de fréquenter celui de Saint Jérôme"}
{"text":"Première visite  très grand beaucoup de choix aliments chauds et très bon nous y retournerons"}
{"text":"Good price. But you got what you paid for. Service is OK. But the food is below average. Not too much you can choose for. And the taste is just acceptable."}
{"text":"Buffet différent des autres. Pourquoi? ce n'est pas un de ses buffets \"chinois\" avec de la nourriture supposé chinoise. A la place, il propose de la nourriture d'un peu partout.   Reste que ce n'est vraiment pas tout les continents qui sont présent. Ne chercher pas de la nourriture indienne, grecque, mexicaine... c'est de la nourriture populaire.  On à donc les salades et les soupes avec pain à l'ail. Ensuite les pizza, fromage, peperoni, toute garni et deux en rotation (j'ai eu bacon, smoke Meat, poulet, mexicaine...). Ensuite les pâtes. Spagethi et lasagne sont toujours présent. Les autres sont des rotations de plusieurs sortent et les sauces sont disponible au bout.  Ensuite la viande, smoke Meat, jambon, boeuf, agneau, poulet, pépite de poulet, aile, Quand même un bon choix de viande et de coupe (les premiers sont un gros morceau que la personne coupe devant vous selon vos choix). Reste que ce n'est pas de la viande de premiere qualitées, parfois grasse et sans goût.  Il y à les saute ressemblant à un Wilfrid pasta bar. On choisi les pâtes. Les légumes, épicé, sauce et il font cuire le tout.  Il y à une section pour homard, crevette et ce genre de chose. Comme je n'aime pas, Je ne peux pas vous le décrire.  Il y à aussi des sushi, plusieurs sortent. Je je mis connais pas mais on m'a dit qu'ils étaient correcte.  Frites, rondelle d'oignon, poutine, riz brun, riz frit chinois, poulet général tao, wong tong, rouleau de printemps, rouleau impériaux, les classiques quoi.  Il y à plusieurs autres choses mais je manque de mémoire  Pour le dessert, plusieurs gateaux, jelo, pouding, crème glacée, biscuit, brownies, tarte. Si vous y allez à la fête des mère ou des pères, il y à d'énormes gâteaux spéciaux qui sont vraiment bon, Mais la ligne est longue alors réserver et arriver d'avance.  Sinon, c'est le buffet que je vais le plus souvent mais pas la nourriture de plus haute gamme. La pluspart goûte fade, digne d'un buffet."}
{"text":"Not much to say about a buffet most of the time there alright just like this one . My friend and I came here for supper on a Sunday night a lot of people but we didn't have to wait to be seated it's a really big place . Even if our waiter was a bit over whelmed he still found time to bring us water when needed. Our  tables were always cleared by the time we would bring our second and 3rd plates. I found it to be a bit over priced even if I wasn't the one paying , with drinks and tip the bill was almost 80$ for 2 people could of been the weekend price tho. The food was not bad there was a few things I didn't like a few things I enjoyed so really in the middle."}
{"text":"For a buffet it was alright . Most of them are so bad it's not worth reviewing came here for a friends birthday . They need more fruits for desert like peaches mangos . Sangria was not worth it tasted off. Ok food come nice staff at least the waitresses I had ."}
{"text":"Après 3-4 visite au buffet des continents st Jérôme  Jamais déçus la nourriture est très bonne le service numéro 1 bon choix de mets différents"}
