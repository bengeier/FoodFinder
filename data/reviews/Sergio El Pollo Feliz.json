{"text":"A buddy of mine suggested we go here.... Thanks, Paul!

This is a tiny, bright yellow, dump of a building in a sketchy neighborhood and the menu is pretty narrowly focused on chicken.... but oh, man is the food good! The chicken is grilled over an open flame, you peel the meat off the bone yourself, roll it into a tortilla and cover it with the awesome sauce that they keep in squeeze bottles.... It's actually what people refer to when the say \"Awesome Sauce\".... I'm sure of it."}
{"text":"Off the charts amazing and authentic. Good people too who work/own the place. So delish!"}
{"text":"The review by Carlos B. almost says it all.  I would just add that on a hot day, don't come here looking to cool down.  The AC does not run very cold - but it's not uncomfortable.  The spanish music station would be okay too if it weren't for all the static.

The 1/4 chicken is delicious and comes with pickled onions, iceberg lettuce, 1 little slice of tomato, a dixie cup of rice, a dixie cup of beans, and some of the delicious salsa.  Also a pan fired serrano chile for those who like it a little hotter!  And of course, a small pile of corn tortillas.   That and a bottled water came to $7.05.  A pretty good deal!  I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place ok but clearly We need to come back when its busier cause the chicken was very dry, like its been siting for a while. The flavor was nice but the chicken killed it. Maybe if I got a full chicken it would be better but that was just too much chicken for one person. 

I got the 1/4 portion which is enough for 1 person and they give, rice, beans, tortillas, lettuce, tomatoes, pickled onions and hot sauce. 

When you put everything together it tasted alright but it was just dry chicken."}
{"text":"After passing this place for the past 5 years I decided I would give it a shot. I was greeted kindly as I walked in the door. The building and parking lot are run down form the outside. The inside was clean enough for me didn't bother me. My mom on the other hand, would have tucked tail and ran. I ordered a full chicken and paid in cash. I don't think they accept card. I ordered to go. The whole chicken came with the traditional pinto beans, corn tortillas, rice, and salsa. The aroma from the chicken was delightful as I was driving home. Much to my disappointment the taste of the chicken was ruined by the amount of salt they brined the chicken in. It was nearly inedible. I tried a thigh breast and wing and drumstick. All were too salty. The other sides were good. Sadly, I don't think I will ever go back."}
{"text":"The smoky smell of grilled chicken lured me in from downtown phx. The chicken is grilled over fire and the style is truly \"Sinaloa.\" The chicken comes with rice, beans, a grilled jalape√±o,  tortillas, and a small side salad. The beans and rice taste home made and the chicken is delicious."}
{"text":"Well, I think I found my Mexican grilled chicken spot in AZ................

I had this place bookmarked and decided to come down today. This style of chicken is my favorite and I am always on the lookout for places that cook it this way over charcoal.  I looked at some of the Yelp pictures and noticed that they had/have a promotion for Wednesdays (Buy one whole chicken, get half a chicken gratis).  I drove on down to check it out.  I walked inside, placed my order for the Wednesday special and a few minutes later, I was handed a heavy bag and was on my way.  Here is how it was.......

Chicken-  Wow!  Fantastic chicken!  Reminded me of some of my SD joints.  I opened the container and there was a massive mound of chicken!  3 breasts, 3 wings (one was like a half wing), 3 thighs and 3 legs.  This pile of chicken smelled fantastic.  I bit into a wing first and was instantly comforted by the charcoal, smoky taste of the grilled chicken.  It was fantastic!  This was after a 30 minute ride in the car, too.  Still hot, still moist, and still delicious!  The legs were really large, the breasts were nice and big and even the thighs were tasty (I usually don't like or eat the thighs)!  I scarfed down almost a whole chicken and saved a few of the breasts for lunch tomorrow!

Sides-  I'm doing low carb so I didn't really dive into these.  I did sample half a tortilla, a bite of rice and some of the salsa.  All 3 were delicious.  I tossed the beans (pinto beans, kind of watery) and saved the rice for my son and the salsa for later on tonight.  They also pack in 2 grilled jalapenos which were hot and spicy and a \"side salad\" which was a few pieces of lettuce and a tomato...random lol!

The lady running the joint was very friendly and smiling the whole time.  This whole thing only cost $14.90!  Yup....on Wednesdays, less than $15 bucks gets you 12 pieces of chicken, rice, beans, tortillas and salsa.  One hell of a deal!  I am sad that starting next week, I will not have Wednesdays off any more.  If you ARE off on Wednesdays, and enjoy this type of chicken, it is well worth the drive down here!  I will be back soon enough!"}
