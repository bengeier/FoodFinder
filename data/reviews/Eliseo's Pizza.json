{"text":"I ordered a veggie pizza and received a CRISPY BURNT veggie pizza. Oh, and they don't give refunds! I had a problem with Yalas, their sister store, and the management didn't really care. \"We don't give refunds, but we will make you another pizza\".....bye Felicia!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite go to pizza in Lorain. A lot of people in Lorain rave about Yala's (also very good), but for me, Eliseo's is where it's at.  The pizza is well done, yes, with crispy edges, but the main part of the pie and underneath is not over done and it is not burnt. Just the outer crust is crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside. And the cheese has that nice browned flavor.   The sauce is tangy, not sweet, not spicy. Just right. The pizza is consistent and delicious. You can't go wrong with a Deluxe."}
{"text":"Absolutely disappointed with Eliseo's pizza!! My husband brought pizza home, it was BURNT!! The crust was UNEDIBLE! What kind of \"pizza\" is that?! I always look at pizza at store. The worst part, Frances, is the mgr, \"Mike\" could do nothing to resolve my issue. Our conversation was transmitted through young girl. After expressing my disappointment & dedication to Eliseo's, 20+ yrs, Mike couldn't help me, unless I brought pizza back. Are u kidding? I bought pizza to watch NFL draft! Well, I wasn't about to drive another 40 mins because negligence on Eliseo's part!! Frances, I'll take my business elsewhere. And you really need to have your \"managers\" take a class in business interaction with dedicated clientele!! #unsatisfiedcustomer"}
