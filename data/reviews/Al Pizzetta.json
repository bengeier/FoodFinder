{"text":"Very bad experience. I ordered a fettuccini alfredo. It was tasteless. My partner ordered a steak medium rare. It was way overcooked and cold?. The salad tasted five days old. The ketchup and mayonnaise came in little plastic containers as if to-go. All this at old port prices."}
{"text":"Yummny. u want a nice experience .. I loved it. Was a random stop in a place I had zero knowledge of.. sometimes those are the best finds.. we had the Montreal pizza.. home made cecser and house salads. Chicken fatchinni and lasgna.. authentic. Salads were so good!!! And my son had a hamburger he ate it so fast.  They were so friendly!! We had left overs from large portions. Go and visit"}
{"text":"This restaurant is great if you love warm salads, cold pasta, someone else's lipstick on your cup, spending too much money, rude waitstaff, and an overall mediocre experience!!!!"}
{"text":"We stopped in here for a quick \"snack\"/early dinner. It's right across the street from the river and they had some outdoor seating but it was a bit cold so we sat inside. I got a glass of wine and my husband got a bloody caesar that was a little sweet.  The pizza was great! We shared the Quebec pizza (I think that's what it was called) and it had all kinds of stuff on it including TONS of bacon. I really liked it. The crust was thinner and crispy on the bottom. It was 4 pieces total and they split it for us before bringing it to the table which was nice.  I think it was around $15. If we were going there for a forreal dinner we would probably have gotten our own pizzas. It's a bit cheaper than a lot of restaurants we passed in Old Montreal.   Service was nice and the ambiance was casual but also nice. Would go again!"}
{"text":"Where do I start!?? We found this place by accident.   Food... excellent! We ordered the smoked meat poutine (first time trying this and it was amazeBalls!), smoked meat pizza, québécois pizza, and four cheese lasagna (I gained 20 lbs by just looking at it #fatKidproblems)... ALL of it was delicious. Each entree portion size was enough to feed 2 people.   Staff... extremely friendly and attentive. The owner (I think he was the owner... if he wasn't, he should be!! Give that man a raise!) interacted with us and was exceptionally kind.   Ambiance... casual and comfy  Location... located in Old Montreal. We went after a long day of walking the city and visiting the museums. It is a great place for lunch or dinner after cite seeing. Also located near unique stores, shops, and bars. Great spot.   Price... a little pricey. Definitely not a #brokecollegestudentswag type of place but worth it.   The ONLY reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it did not have a baby changing table in the bathroom so I had to change my 1 yr old son on a table in a chilly stairwell. I think this is an easy fix for their management. They just need to invest in a wall mounted baby changing table... it can't be that expensive.   In summary, my family loved this restaurant and we would definitely go there again."}
{"text":"The service was so bad that it became comical. The food itself was good, but the wait staff could not get it together. We waited for a good 20 minutes for water, and an additional 10-15 for our check. They have a nice terrance and great location, but if you are visiting i believe there are better restaurants to visit in the area. I give it 3 stars because the restaurant has so much potential and interior is nice!"}
{"text":"We found this lovely little place quite by accident when we went to the Science Museum.  We were looking for a family friendly place that was in close proximity and this met our needs. The staff was extremely fruendly. The menu was pretty basic but authentic.  It was a small place but pretty quiet for lunch. It reminded me of a,little Italian restaurant I would go to with my family in my old neighborhood in the Bronx especially with the red checkered table cloths and Italian decor. It had that family neighborhood vibe, which was really nice. You can tell that they really care about this place, the food and their customers. It was a little weird to see poutine on the menu, but it was everywhere we went in Montreal!  My daughter had it and loved it. There are so many restaurant options in Old Montreal, but this is a good one to try."}
{"text":"Outstanding service! I feel like home with our server. We are tourists from Orlando and we made friends with one of the servers on our first visit. We highly recommend this place because it has great service, feels like family and is affordable. I recommend Maeyvis and Nicolas as your servers. We had 1 pepperoni and one vegetable pizza and it was amazing. We loved it so much, we came back a second time for after dinner drinks. To our surprise, they remembered us!!! And as returning customers, they treated us to a shot of the Frangelico liquor. This restaurant is amazing."}
