{"text":"Watch out for this place when open a tap they tend to add drinks to your bill. They did it the same night to a friend and I. Horrible food staff didn't even try to smile. Do no recommend it. There are much better places around the area that are worth your time and money. No joke!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing. We drove from Barrie and enjoyed the ambiance and of course the food. Service was exceptional. We will definitely return"}
{"text":"Found this place hiding and very quiet for a Saturday night and felt like I stumbled on a hidden gem.   The staff was incredibly friendly, I requested to have the hockey game put on the tv and the staff member took the time to search for the right channel and make sure I was satisfied during my visit. Love the above and beyond they take there to make people comfortable   In terms of food only ordered beer and a poutine and the poutine had a great mustard flavour to it with loads of salt (my favourite). Not Montreal level of poutine but the best kind you'll get in toront"}
{"text":"I've only ever been here for lunch as I work in Liberty Village, so I can't speak on any other reviews regarding dinner service.  A few times I've been here for lunch, the service becomes slower with more people - seems like an obvious fact, but then again given the size, I don't think it employs too many people anyway.  The menu is a good size, so you know the quality of the food is going to be held to good standards.   I've always gotten the wraps - mainly the jerk chicken and roasted red pepper wraps. Both are excellent, very well seasoned and tasty. The jerk chicken has a spicy kick to it that is both unexpected but delightful. The roasted red pepper is savoury and just delicious. I really have no other way to describe it.   The ceasar salads are what you'd expect from anywhere else.  The fries are nice, you can't go wrong with them.   The garlic bread is amazing - great for a starter if you're with a group or just love garlic bread.  People I've been with at Jokers who order the burgers/sandwiches love it. I have yet to try the pasta (which I've seen someone and it looks really good) and burgers/sandwiches so another review will come if I do. The wraps are my go-to.  It's a nice little place, nothing fancy but not run-down at all. There was never any loud noises each time I've been. The TV is great for watching sports or news in the background."}
{"text":"The name was really appealing, sounded like fun.  After been taking the sun like an iguana at the CNE we needed a shadowy place for adults (we still could hear the screams resounding inside our heads).   Joker could redeem parents after hanging out with their sprouts with such a tempting offer: $5 deal for drinks (ok kids go home, time for mommy and daddy).    The seats were cozy, they serve good smelling food, the bartender was friendly, smiley, cool British girl.  Had a good time and I would go back to taste the food."}
{"text":"Joker Cafe closed down as of November 2016. There's a place \"Liberty Food and Drink\"  or something like that, where it used to be.  I've since found out it's the same staff, but new ownership. Similar menu but almost twice as expensive. No thanks."}
{"text":"Friend staff.  Good food. By Liberty Village and The Exhibition ground.  My friend and I arrived for a bite and the kitchen staff was kind enough to open the kitchen for order just as we arrived.  Bartender was very helpful and nice. Nice ambient."}
{"text":"The name, location, decor don't actually suggest what kind of food you would find here. I was pleasantly suprised to discover that Joker Cafe has a fair size authentic Serbian food selection.  Their 'chevaps' are amazing. The hamburger is traditionally served without a bun but great taste."}
{"text":"Loud/awful music. Not all menu items available, food and beer. Food was sub-par. Would not recommend!"}
{"text":"Wow! Wow and Whoa! Where do I start with this place other than complete chaos!  Visited Toronto for Caribana and was completely exhausted and annoyed with how it was handled this year. Decided to stop in this cute little joint for a few cocktails and wings since I'm obsessed with wings. Anyway, it was very cute and the patrons seemed to be enjoying themselves so I thought perfect spot. OMG!!! Chaos!  There was only one bartender who I assume was the owner somehow and one cook. We sat at a table and eventually had to walk up to the bar for services. The bartender (female) was very nice but seemed a bit overwhelmed. I ordered a water, wine & a Stella. She told me to hold on and she'll come to the table but again very nice. She came over took the order so no problems. As people continued to roll in she became more & more overwhelmed being the only bartender. Needless to say she forgot about us and only took or filled orders from the bar or from people yelling be things at her. I eventually went to the bar for attention and got my drinks. She was extremely apologetic and again nice. There must have been a mix up with the kitchen cause she offered us a meal for free which was delicious.   Anyway we decided to not try ordering again because she was overwhelmed with people and orders. She was so flustered that she was panicking and completely shutting down. A gentlemen eventually showed up which I thought was help but he didn't add much relief for her I think he made it worst lol. She asked him to fill orders which he half did but anyway.   We decided to leave and for the life of me couldn't get her attention anymore and he didn't know how to give checks. We eventually estimated our bill using the menu and left the cash with a small tip with the gentleman. Talking about frustration and utter chaos this was the text book version.   I'm sure this is an amazing place and I would give them another try but not during Caribana and definitely with more staff."}
