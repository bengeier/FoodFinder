{"text":"We ordered 2 pasta dishes. My partner saw nothing she wanted so they created a special dish for her. Both dishes were excellent and the service was warm and friendly."}
{"text":"You bet, as good as it gets!  Came here to meet descendants of the Shah who are working on, well, let's not talk about that!  Anyway, the pasta with truffles was stunning and the venison was, well, to kill for....  But that's not all.  A fine wine form Alto Adagio, some fine after dinner drinks, and it was a splendid performance on all accounts."}
{"text":"Great italian restaurant for quality dining. Good for families, very nice and attentive staff. Very satisfied everytime we est there."}
{"text":"Really good italian food. Verry good service. Good wine. We had many appetizers like eggplant with parmesan, lobster, fried crab and many more. Fish and foie de veau are delicious and the scalops as well."}
{"text":"Came here for a small business dinner at the recommendation of a colleague. Was reluctant initially but am glad I came. Food was wonderful. The highlight: a homemade tagliatelle w white truffle and egg yolk (this was a special). Fabulous!!! Also had their fish of the day which was well executed and simple. Not too heavy and sauced up. Finished the meal off w a panna cotta. Probably the low point of the meal: just ok, nothing special.  Overall: may skip dessert in the future but will most definitely be back.  (Remark: I give 4 stars for now since the dessert wasn't perfect and I wonder if the incredible white truffle starter is an outlier that isn't always available. If my latter worry is assuaged in a future visit, I'll probably revise to 5 stars.)"}
