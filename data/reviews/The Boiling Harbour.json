{"text":"Personally, I think that this restaurant is stupendous. Hands down one of the best seafood restaurants I've ever had. The lobster Mac and cheese balls were excellent and had to be my favourite item on the menu. Their harbour sauce was delicious and flavourful. The staff was very welcoming and nice. The decor was also very innovative and unique, it was cool. Overall, the place was well worth it and I would definitely recommend it to a seafood lover."}
{"text":"The Boiling Horbour grand opening was today Aug 6th. If you want fresh seafood seasoned to perfection you have to try the loaded lobster fries and lobster mac and cheese balls.  The management and staff are amazing, the ambiance and decor fits the theme. Great patio space. Enjoy the Boiling Harbour!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, friendly service, and a relaxing and welcoming ambience is what The Boiling Harbour accomplishes. The Boiling Harbour is a restaurant situated in Vaughan, right across the street from the mall which is convenient if you are looking for a bite after an exhausting trip of shopping.   As you step inside, you are greeted by a comfortable setting. The interior of the restaurant is hip and cool, which is a nice setting for a date or a family dinner.   The menu offered a variety of different dishes, unlike other boil restaurants that I have visited nearby. If you are a seafood eater, this place is awesome! If seafood isn't your fancy, they also have plenty of options as well such as their crispy chicken poboy sandwich. I ordered oysters (weekend special only), supreme fries, and grilled lobster and everything was delicious.   The service accompanied the quality of the food, which was quick! Our server was really friendly while explaining the menu and the concept for us. The concept as explained by the server is a boil concept, with all the seafood being boiled, tossed in sauce, and then placed in a bag to retain the heat. Since we been to other seafood boil restaurants before we were familiar with the hands on way of eating and the messy aspect but we were giving gloves, bibs and tools so we were fine with it.  Despite the pricy price of the food, I was extremely pleased with my dining experience as a whole. The seafood was fresh tasting and the service was friendly. I look forward to coming back."}
{"text":"Compared to other seafood joints in the area, the boiling harbour has so much more flavour. I always get the shrimp with the harbour sauce and the heat level at extreme heat. I always ask them to make it spicier than extreme heat and they give me fresh chillies! Yum! I order a side of steam rice on the side so I can mix the sauce with the rice and it's soooooo good. The lobster  mac and cheese balls are awesome as well. Third time here and I'll always be coming back because it's so close to home."}
{"text":"Got the loaded lobster fries and I'll say it was pretty delicious. Only drawback I have about it is that for almost $30 you would expect to get more. Was really small in my opinion."}
{"text":"The food and service here definitely beats other seafood boils in the city!! The decor of the place is very nice and great service, which is very important to me. Our server, Randy I think, was great! Nice and attentive!! My husband and I each ordered one pound of shrimp. I also added corn on the cob and steamed rice, my husband added potatoes. We both had Harbour seasoning and it was amazing, especially on the corn! Great flavour, awesome spices and not too buttery/greasy as other boil restaurants. We will definitely be returning again and again, next time to try the mussels!  Parking is free which is always great and just in front of Vaughan Mills!!"}
{"text":"I came here for a birthday. Service was good, food was good. My boyfriend and I split and order of shrimp and the lobster poutine. We are huge lobster fans, and were excited to try it out but we didn't think it was the best item on the menu. I'd probably never order it again... however the shrimp was to die for."}
{"text":"Been looking forward to trying this place for sometime now. And boy was it worth the wait. The food was outstanding the atmosphere was great and very good service. But back to the food. Their harbour sauce was unreal (they need to bottle it and sell it at the restaurant). Lobster Cajun fries were great and the shrimp was spot on. I will definitely be back as there is much more on the menu I'm looking forward to try."}
{"text":"A new joint in the Vaughan area. Loved the food!! We had The triple claw poutine, Mac and cheese balls and a lb of shrimps in Harbour sauce. The poutine was amazing! I esp enjoyed the creamy sauce that was drizzled over it. Will be back again =) my new favourite seafood house"}
{"text":"Had a great Christmas Eve meal. Amazing food and fantastic family friendly service. Cajun medium on the broil still packs some punch. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Dishes are alright but definitely just mediocre. I am surprise the restaurant has such a high rating. That was what led me to try it in the first place. If you are interested to get seafood in a bag, captain's boil or even good catch is a much better option. The lobster mac and cheese was not good. The crust / outer shell of the mac and cheese was just hard. The lobster fries was good, but definitely not worth $28. Bagged seafood was not that fresh. Everything was very pictured friendly but the meal was just not worth. For the same price I rather go to other similar restaurants in the market. Again, the restaurant was not that bad, but the rating definitely did not match up to what I ate."}
{"text":"I came here a couple weeks ago with my fiance, as we are both huge seafood fans. It did NOT disappoint. First and foremost, it was a Friday night and we just walked in and got a table right away. This was a big relief, when comparing it to the 2 hour wait we had at Captain's Boil. The service was impeccable, especially our waiter who was really fun and good natured. He gave some recommendations in terms of spice level and which sauces to pick. Between the two of us, we got 1 lb of shrimp, 2 pieces of corn, and the lobster poutine; it was filling, but not to the point where we felt sick. The loaded lobster poutine was AMAZING. Also, our bill came to $50 which was considerably cheaper than Captains Boil. We will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Went to the boiling harbour on a Tuesday night. The place was dead and I don't understand why cause the food was amazing! It was a nice chill vibe and our waitress was great. I got lobster and Cajun fries. So goooood! And extremely filling. I wasn't even able to finish it. I definitely recommend this restaurant"}
{"text":"Honestly, can't speak highly enough of this place!! The lobster was amazing, clams were delicious and you have to get the jalape√±o poppers!!! Service was excellent and is a must go place! Especially on a date!!"}
{"text":"I love it I love it I love it. Had never tried a seafood place quite like this and I LOVE seafood. Having an option like this instead of the usual wings and what not is amazing here in Vaughan. All their sauces are delicious, but especially their Harbour sauce which is delicious enough to drink!  Excellent service and taste. Been here three times already and will be back very soon again."}
{"text":"Having tried quite a few of these concept restaurants, I was pleasantly surprised by how much I like the boiling harbour.  I've ordered their peeled shrimp (I was lazy, but big mistake lol), as well as their mussels before. Their garlic butter flavour is very flat, but their lime n' pepper is definitely my favorite. I usually order a side of fries with it and they're very tasty (it's kinda hard to ruin fries, lbr).  The service is friendly there and relatively quick, so that's a plus. I come here whenever I want a quick bite to eat and it's definitely satisfying.  There's nothing outstanding about this place compared to other seafood boil restaurants, but I do enjoy coming here and will most certainly be back again and again!"}
{"text":"Wow! As a downtown-er, it is very rare for me to step foot anywhere north of Sheppard but I made the trip up here to try some seafood and I have to say, my efforts were definitely rewarded!   Loved their Sampler Platter of shrimp, oysters, wings and chicken strips and also their All Dressed Corn! Whatever that white sauce is - keep it comingggg!   We also tried their Shrimp Po Boy Sandwich was really good - the shrimp was battered, deep fried and sandwiched into a deliciously carby but satisfying bite.   Fish and Chips are haddock battered and fried, I typically don't really like haddock but this one didn't have the fishy taste so it was actually pretty good!   Overall, the restaurant was full the entire time we were there and the atmosphere was very fun."}
{"text":"Having been to a similar place a week before I can compare quality. Shrimp were not very fresh, crawfish was not available snow crab was very good. I like the fact that they gave you buckets for trash rather than throw it on the table. Service was good, the server gave us suggestions on sauces, mussels and clams were good.  Will try this place again."}
{"text":"Fresh shrimp, mussels , fried oysters is what we had. The flavour is so good you want to slurp the sauce.  The fries are fresh and spiced perfectly. A fun night by using your hands and bib, just like they do it in the south. A bit pricey but you get what you pay for and that's fresh flavorful fish."}
{"text":"Thoroughly impressed with the freshness of seafood and service! The shrimp were HUGE! Definitely recommend the mac balls and poutine too! The bib and gloves are a nice touch! I'll be back with more friends next time!!"}
{"text":"Came here on Valentine's day and it was packed. My boyfriend and I ordered the loaded lobster fries and clams with harbour sauce. The loaded lobster fries were sooo good. That garlic butter sauce was on point, and the cajun fries were super crispy. We also enjoyed the clams but found it lacked a little bit of flavour.   Now onto the service....  The service started out kinda bad... not gonna lie. It took a while for a waitress to even get to our table, and we had to ask for water 3 times. However, once we put in our order, and got our drinks, the service was pretty good. They brought out our food pretty fast, and the server kept checking to see if we needed anything.   Overall, a pretty good experience."}
{"text":"I finally tried this place out and I think it's pretty good and it's not as salty as the other boiling spot...which is good so you don't have to always drink after a few bites...I will be coming back for sure"}
{"text":"The Loaded Lobster Fries arrived next.  This was a whole lobster boiled and quickly deep fried, tossed in a garlic butter sauce, and drizzled with a delicious garlic aioli.  It was served on Cajun fries, red cabbage, and delicious aioli on the side.  This was absolutely divine!  This was the best item of the night (even though it was hard to choose a single contender).  I loved this whole lobster because its meat was so juicy, moist, and perfectly boiled.  It just tasted of perfection!  The garlic butter sauce was perfect with the lobster and didn't overpower it while the garlic aioli was the perfect dip for the fries and red cabbage.  You have to order this dish!"}
{"text":"Love the decor of this place and great ideas were made when they designed this restaurant.  The food is okay, the prices im not a huge fan of; there is very little give on the customers end. Mostly everything is fried there or else youd have to pay a lot more to get the fresh baskets and only a singular order of shrimp, clams, crab etc.  The fish and chips were pretty standard,  the fries were very well seasoned, my shrimp salad was pretty nice as well. I also ordered dressed corn, a huge corn on the cob.  The service was okay, the waiter was busy on her phone once but I think she remembered to come check us again. She was friendly!  The bathrooms are well kept and clean.  In all I'd like to address some tips to the owners  1) randomize the menu, give mixer options of boiled fresh seafood for new coming guests who have never tried your baskets but dont want to pay 20 dollars for a pound of 1 seafood  2) Make actual coleslaw, shredded purple cabbage with dressing isnt coleslaw  3) Cut the corn in half before you dress it for ease for customers  4) Add desserts to the menu, salt taffy sundae etc."}
{"text":"This place is tucked away in a corner, slightly hard to find. This place is comparable to the other seafood boil places (captain's boil,  boiling crab). What makes them different is their lobster fries. That was very good.  I found the price a bit steep for lobster fries relative to other places but good none the less. Service was a but slow for an empty place with one server."}
{"text":"Our server was great . We had no idea what sauces to order and she brought us a sample of each one to try.   We had 1 lb of shrimp , 1 lb of mussels and 1 lb of crab legs.   We also got corn on a cob.   We got everything with the harbour sauce and medium spicy.    The mussels were our favorite.   They were delicious.   Shrimp and crab were good just not as flavourful as the mussels.     I was slightly disappointed that they didn't have wine only beer.  The only major con is that when we got our utensils for the crab - we had to send them back because they were dirty .   Other than that food was great and service was great"}
{"text":"Slow service, pretty sure all dishes come out of the same fryer in which the oil probably hasn't been changed in months. 3 guests of mine ordered fish n chips and it came out almost black and was flavorless. Appetizers were over priced, both the spinach \" lobster\" dip and the maccaroni and \"lobster\" balls literally had no lobster it was all cheese. Only thing that was decent was my crab boil, sauce was decent. Captains boil has better boil sauce."}
{"text":"Not a bad place: good atmosphere, everything cooked fresh to order, service was slow and lacked attentiveness.  I got a few items and the seafood they do right, the gumbo on the side was a bit off (no roux?)  but otherwise I left full.  Also a lot poorer because HELLO PRICES but still full.  I'd check it out again when I have more scrilla to burn and try some of the more creative high-dollar items and really test them out, but for now I'd say it was decent but not great."}
{"text":"Not a shellfish fan but the two others I was with were in heaven.  Loved the bibs and food on bags laden with sauce.  Nice space and friendly owners, will return with any and all seafood lovers.  Recommended eats for all."}
{"text":"I attached a picture of the online menu! I had a great experience when I went to the boiling harbour! The food was delicious and our waiter was very friendly. We ordered the fish & chips, as well as the triple claw poutine, 1 lb of shrimp (with corn on the side for only $1 - yum) dressed in Cajun and a breezes. It was very filling, we didn't finish everything. I suggest that you go with a larger group so that you can order a bunch of things from the menu and share!"}
{"text":"We were on our way to Diana's Seafood for valentines but the weather turned nasty on us so I called The Boiling Harbour because it was much closer. Did not know what to expect but I am glad that we went. It is one of those crab boil places that have been popping up recently. Ordering is very simple: 1. pick your catch 2. pick your sauce 3. pick the level of spiciness. Optionally add a vegetable. They will toss all of it in a plastic bag and will cook it all together. I loved the dungeon crab and surprisingly I loved ocra. The eating is very messy but it is full of flavour and taste. Drink selection is very limited but they have beer and very limited wine selection"}
{"text":"I visited on family day and surprisingly it was dead. I didn't mind because it made or service faster. There was two of us we ordered 1 pound of shrimp and one pound of mussels with harbour flavour spice level hot. And we also got loaded lobster fries. We left feeling full. The food was extra hot temperature wise and was flavorful. The food is a bit on the pricey side but the portion sizes are enough to share.   I give it four stars because it wasn't the best I've ever had but I'd definitely go back if I was in the area."}
{"text":"This place was a very good experience. Me and my gf went to captain boil just down the street and it was just horrible. Ruined our experience for captain boil. But this place was wonderful  Hard to find but it was good.  Service was good aswell"}
{"text":"From the outside, the place looks like a tiny unit but it's got a large back seating area and patio that can open up. The Boiling Harbour made me fall in love with the seafood boil experience! I hate using my fingers and getting dirty when eating out but the bib and gloves made everything ok. Our server was very helpful making menu suggestions for us. We ordered the dungeness crab, crawfish, corn, lotus root, sausage, potato with their house Harbour sauce and lime & pepper. The Harbour sauce was flavourful and had so many levels of flavours to it while the lime & pepper was on the mild side. I thoroughly enjoyed eating the dungeness crab as it had so much meat in it but I didn't quite understand the crawfish (my first time having crawfish)."}
{"text":"I took off one star because of service. I went later on in the evening around 9:00pm and the restaurant was empty except two or so tables. There was nobody at the front and as I waited I saw a waiter look at me while wiping down a table right next to me but he said nothing and walked away. Then another waiter saw me, we locked eyes, then she just closed the sliding door in front of her.  I waited for another 5 minutes or so while all the waiters were ignoring me and I finally walked up to a waiter and asked to be seated in which he replied \"anywhere you like!\".  Halfway through our meal, a table next to us were given these little sauce containers and lime. I didn't even know they had limes so I asked our waiter for lime and what that thing was and he replied \"oh its salt and you can make your own dipping sauce by adding the Boil sauce to the container and mixing it around\". It would've been nice to have these given to us before our meal like everyone else.   Food at Boiling Harbour is 4 stars. I liked it more than The Captains Boil at Yonge and Sheppard. I found Captains Boil seasoning to overpower the seafood. At the Boiling Harbour, the flavours much more complement the food with nice herbs and spices. The spice level was a good kick but not like a punch in your face garlic bomb like Captains Boil. We had the a pound of mussels, lobster poutine and ended up adding on a pound of shrimp. We also had the gumbo which was yummy had lots of sausage inside. We both enjoyed the the mussels the most, it absorbed and complimented the boil sauce the most. The poutine was creamy and delicious, it complimented the spicy boil really well.   I would go back again for the food, but really their service needs to improve. Also i wish they had wine."}
{"text":"Love this place! Definitely my go to place when I'm in Vaughan. My fave is the Lobster Poutine but everything is delicious. Also great patio and service."}
{"text":"You people that have given this place 4 and 5 stars are crazy.  it was based on these reviews that I took my mother and mother in law for dinner on Mother's Day. I should have had an indication when the place was less than half full on one of the busiest restaurant days of the year. This is one of the most disappointing meals I've had in quite some time and I was embarrassed that I took the mom's here for a special day.  Before we get to the food, wine is by the bottle only so I couldn't get a glass of wine.  Thank goodness as they do not have glasses!  That's right, only plastic cups.  Also, the plates are stryrofoam and plastic forks (no knives or spoons plastic or otherwise).  We ordered King Crab, Lobster and Shrimp.  While the crab was nice in the lime pepper sauce it was almost impossible to get out of the shell with plastic forks and no metal skewers.  The Lobster was tiny and the shrimp was previously frozen, and flavourless.  All of the meals were served plopped on the table in plastic bags.  WTF! Everything about this meal was totally ghetto.  I'm easy peasy with real East Coast down and dirty seafood but this place takes it to the next level with sub par food, bad presentation and crappy service. Check out the 5 star reviews.  Most of them start with \"I don't usually like Lobster, but...\" Also, knowing the wait staff really didn't care we kept our comments to ourselves.  When the bill came they had taken off 10% without us even asking.  A sure sign that even the staff knows how bad things are for the price. I only feel worse for the poor creatures of the sea that are given no respect at all."}
{"text":"I'm not typically a lobster fan, but this place is totally worth trying! Oddly enough, really enjoyed the mac and cheese lobster ball, as well as the lobster poutine! the staff were extremely friendly and patient and made sure to take care of our table! There even is a wall for you to sign your name on with a sharpie, which is perfect for leaving a memory on! Highly reccomended!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Monday lunch with the family. We had ordered a lot of stuff including rice but that we didnt get on time. When we did, it wasnt still cooked right. We were almost done our seafood feast when they offered to give us corn in the house. We really liked the gesture but the fact that we were served raw rice my family wasnt really pleased. The server was really nice and she had apologized. However, if you are unsure whether the food is cooked or not, you shouldn't have serve it."}
{"text":"The food here is mediocre compared to its competitors, like The Captain's Boil, and the service was laughable (I'll get to that in a second).   We ordered mussels with Cajun sauce and Triple Claw poutine. The Cajun sauce was watered down. The seafood in the Triple Claw poutine was overly chewy and salty. So the food was a miss for us.  Our waiter took forever to take our order after giving us our waters. I don't know what he was doing, other than socializing with the other waiters and scaring one of the waitresses while she was cleaning the table next to ours. We attributed that to perhaps, the playfulness/culture of the restaurant, when an airhorn went off. Yes, an airhorn, which made half of us in the restaurant jump out of our seats, a girl to scream, and an infant to start crying. There was a celebration a couple of tables away from us. I thought that it was a customer setting off an airhorn, which would've not been the fault of the restaurant. But lo and behold, it was my waiter who blew the airhorn, not once, but twice. I'm not sure if it's the customer's request to have an airhorn blown, or it's the restaurant's policy to scare the crap out of all its customers.   Needless to say, I will not recommend this place to even my worst enemies."}
{"text":"Sarah our waiter was attentive, kind and timely. I especially loved the mac n cheese lobster balls. And I am not big on lobster but I would come back for this! I liked how airy it felt. There are plenty of seating options. Reminded me of a place I eat back home in Houston. The gps wasn't helpful for us foreigners lacking sense of direction. Lol. It's ducked off in the corner. We found it after many failed attempts... Again I am glad we found this spot!"}
{"text":"Found this place through Yelp and loving Lobster we decided to try it its not your typical Lobster dinner be prepared to have fun and you gotta like spicy. Its a great dining experience and the food is great news stop for wonderful. Janis  is awesome.. just ask for her and she wont steer you wrong with recommendation."}
{"text":"Spent whole day shopping at Vaughn Mills, didn't feel like driving too far for a good seafood dinner so this restaurant popped up on my Yelp search.  Restaurant located in one of those generic outdoor malls, not in their own stand alone building, upon entering noticed 3 sitting booths on left, minimum decorations, a second eating area to the right separated by window partitions.  Not a place you would take someone on a romantic date, in fact, you'd initially think you've enter a bar, bare minimum decorations, no ambiance.  Staff mentioned restaurant only opened 3 weeks ago, maybe additional decorations in the near future will occur  However if you're a seafood lover this place rocks! (Look at the photos)  We ordered the Lobster, clams, Alaskan King Crab (I chose the garlic butter and minimum spice option) Three Claw Poutine and Gumbo. Service staff was efficient and helpful.   The seafood came out in their own individual plastic bags which you open and spill onto your table.  Word of advice, use the plastic bibs and gloves that are given as it'll get messy.  Had trouble cracking open one of the huge lobster claws, the waitress came to the rescue.  Seafood came out very hot and was cooked perfectly, also their Gumbo had to be one of the best Gumbo's I have ever tasted.   For the amount of seafood ordered (Lobster was large, clams were meaty/juicy) I thought the final price was quite reasonable, looking forward to my next visit after a tiring day of shopping.  This ain't no generic Red Lobster (thank God)!!"}
{"text":"The service wasn't the greatest and the food was okay,  I would probably not come back every again. The captain's boil is opening right next door. They have better service then this place. Plus they don't steal some of your food before serving it to you or, forget to give you change"}
{"text":"I must say the service there is really friendly. Went here with my sister and my cousin for lunch today at around 12pm. The waitress was really nice and welcoming!! I really appreciated that.   The food however, meh. We ordered the lobster mac & cheese balls, lobster, spinach and artichoke dip, triple claw poutine, shrimp po'boy sandwhich.   lobster mac & cheese balls: They tasted like they were frozen, also like in most of the dishes I did not taste any lobster in there what so ever.  lobster, spinach and artichoke dip: This was the star for today, I really enjoyed this however still... no lobster  triple claw poutine: The special sauce was a little tooo much for me, kinda got sick of the flavour  shrimp po'boy sandwhich: the bread was over toasted and fell apart when you picked it up. and tasted greasy.    Overall, it is not for me today."}
{"text":"Food and service are both very good. Prepare to get messy and have some great seafood. The lobster and crab poutine is also really good."}
{"text":"Hate to do this but this place gets a 2 star rating.  We arrived at the restaurant at 7pm and as soon as we stepped in, the place was completely dead.  There was only 1 other table with 4 people. We sat down and ordered our drinks.  When my ice tea came, it was completely watered down and definitely tasted a bit \"different\" from other ice teas I've had.  Anyway, we decided what we wanted to order and flagged the waitress over.  The first thing we wanted was OYSTERS! (based on pics others have posted on Yelp).  To our disappointment, we were advised that they no longer offer oysters on the menu.  Okay then! Next, we wanted CLAMS! To our disappointment, they didn't have any on that particular night. Are you kidding! ?!  We ended up just ordering fried calamari with jalapenos, corn on the cob with aioli sauce, lobster on fries and mussels with lemon pepper sauce.   The corn on the cob with aioli sauce was okay, nothing special. Very rich and salty.  The calamari with jalapenos was okay as well. Their batter was very bland and the calamari itself wasn't really crsipy.  The mussels in lemon pepper was edible but it doesn't compare to Captain's Boil.  The star dish of the night was the lobster with fries.  Although it was good, the lobster meat was super tiny and once you are done with the lobster, all you are left with are normal fries with cabbage. Definitely not worth the 30 bucks for that dish alone.  All in all, the food wasn't anything spectacular as others have mentioned.  The servers were nice and all but not enough to save this restaurant from getting a 2 star rating from us. One other thing I should mention is that, they didn't cheap out on their heating system! It was like -20 in Toronto that night and when we walked in, we could feel the heating blasting us with warm air. It kept us nice and cozy as we ate our overpriced medicore seafood.  Will not return."}
{"text":"I was excited to try out the Boiling Harbour for dinner the other day. The other cajun seafood boil restaurants are a bit far away, so the Boiling Harbour is a welcome addition to the food options in this area. The prices are comparable to similar restaurants. The interior is pretty nice, with a couple of booths and tables for two near the entrance and several tables and booths in a larger adjacent room. They also have outdoor seating.  We ordered a pound of the shrimp and the mussels in mild garlic butter sauce. We also ordered a pound of the clams in mild harbour sauce. The garlic butter was essentially spice-less, though with a definite butter and garlic flavor with large slices of garlic. The harbour sauce was spicy, even with a mild spice level. I was quite impressed with the size of the shrimp and the mussels. They were larger than what you'd buy at a grocery store.  Service was great, even for a busy Friday evening. Water was refilled regularly, our order was taken quickly and food came out soon after."}
{"text":"Definitely a unique eating experience! Messy, fun, and nice decor inside. I recommend the snow crab and clams all in harbour sauce. 4 stars because it tasted a little bland and heavy on the garlic in comparison to Captains Boil."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of seafood and was super excited to try all the crab boil restaurants popping up in Toronto. Having tried Captain's Boil, I would have to say Boiling Harbour wins, hands down. The flavours are so much more complementary to the accompanying seafood as opposed to the overpowering sodium at Captain's Boil.   Food - Between two hungry people, we usually order 1lb shrimps (Harbour sauce, medium spice), 1lb mussels (Harbour sauce, hot spice), Crab claw poutine (TO DIE FOR!!!!!!) and two steamed rices. We leave happy and pretty full but not to the point of hating yourself and your life decisions :)   Service - Whenever I've been here the service has always been better than average. Things are forgotten here and there but it's not really anything to sweat over. There was one server who made our time there super memorable simply because he was such a comedian.   Really love this place."}
{"text":"If you haven't tried these boil places before, you might consider going here. If you have, then skip this place. Seafood in bags and eating with bibs is fun for the first 10 minutes, then you're actually just wishing you went someplace else where the chef actually tried.  This place is tucked inside the corner of a plaza and actually took some searching since trusty Google Maps couldn't pinpoint exactly where this place was. I would recommend making reservations beforehand and securing a booth (they only have 2 btw). There's a draft inside and so all the other tables were complaining that it was cold but luckily the booths have a heat vent near it. When it's -30C in Toronto, you'll thank me for telling you this.  Ordered a pound of crawfish and clams, fried calamari, and their triple claw poutine. Poutine was kinda cold by the time it got to our table but it was the best tasting thing out of our entire order (isn't that sad??). Ordered the crawfish with their highly recommended harbour sauce and there was actually no taste to it.  As a seafood fanatic, I can say that I will not be coming back, ever. A very mediocre and not satisfying experience, I think places like this and the Boiling Crab and whatnot are just gimmicks and fads that will fade."}
