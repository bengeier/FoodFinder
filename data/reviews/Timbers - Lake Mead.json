{"text":"Updated review: I went in on Friday and service was much better! My Hawaiian sliders were well done and very tasty (but waited a long time as waitress told me my mini sliders took longer to cook than my friends' tacos and chicken fried steak). But overall was MUCH better than last time. =)"}
{"text":"Get the fish tacos!!! The beer is ridiculously cold. The daytime bartender Tina is a sassy broad - made me feel like a regular & took the time to make menu suggestions."}
{"text":"Timbers is a great cozy little spot that is perfect when You just want to grab a quick little lunch that's delicious!  The waitresses are all super friendly and bring their A+ game! Thank you Timbers for great food and great service! I Love your beef tacos and chicken fingers! Yummy!"}
{"text":"Bomb chicken fingers!!!! Great service!!!! Great taste...... Great place! The food taste fresh! Keep it up!"}
{"text":"$5.95 for 2 mozzarella sticks that took over 30 minutes to make?! Somehow our order got misplaced so the rest of our order didn't get started till I asked where our mozzarella stick(s) were. Horrible service and not much food for your buck! Find another place to eat! PT's is down the street on south side of lake mead. This place has gone down hill and lost my business for good! Happy hunger hunting everyone."}
{"text":"Stopped in at 9pm.  Marine Corps Birthday, Veterans Day just wanted a quiet beer.   Not too busy, a few people at the bar gaming.  Two bartenders both looked at my wife and i as we sat in a booth near the bar.  10 minutes later, after no service, we just walked out to go spend money elsewhere.  Used to stop in quite a bit not anymore.  Waitress also saw us and.....nothing.  Great service....."}
{"text":"We use to order from this location because the food is usually good, it's close to our house and they're open late. However, I have to say the food is getting downright sloppy. You have a slim chance of getting them to make anything a certain way. So don't bother with customizations to your order. 9 times out of 10 they screw something up. Last time my husband ordered a philly and one half of the sandwich was just bread! How about a Bozeman dip with no dip? What a waste of time."}
{"text":"Being born and raised In las vegas I've been to bars all over this city, this is the first one that's tried to charge me for a drink while I'm playing.  LAS VEGAS BAR STANDARD IS 1 Drink/ $20 played.  I've never been told that because I happen to drink Crown Royal that my $60 in a machine isn't worth 2 shots and a beer. This is rediculous as far as I'm concerned.  If you're looking to game, do it somewhere else obviously this place is counting it's pennies so hard that they can't even afford to take care of serious gamers."}
{"text":"Slow service. The place was not busy and we felt ignored my the waiter. The food was decent. Pretty sure my debit card information was stolen there since the next day I had fraudulent charges and this was the only time recently that my card was out of site."}
{"text":"Had the chicken Caesar salad. I asked for my chicken to be blackened. Oops one, no blackening seasoning. Was served the salad. The chicken was as though it had been sitting in warm water for quite a while. Tasted watery and soft. If they would have just put it on the grill for a bit would have made a big difference. I do really like it here and the service is great. Just won't order this again."}
{"text":"I have had my friends visit Timbers on the weekends and they have always had great food and great atmosphere. If you are coming or going to the lake a good place to stop."}
{"text":"Went to Timbers to try it out with my brother and thought the food was pretty good.  The Classic Cheesburger, which we got, was pretty filling and had good flavor, nothing that would be considered world renown, but still it was appetizing.  The food portions where large enough and easily satisfied our hunger.  We also got what they call mozzarella wedges and those to were pretty delicious, the cheese was really melty and had the right taste.  The only complain I would have would be that the fries were a little salty, but other than that the food was good plus service was phenomenal and attentive"}
{"text":"Food is good. Deals are good. Food specials, mailer coupons. Girls are friendly! Dont mind eating in, decent separate dining area from bar. To go is always a plus."}
{"text":"Have been visiting this Timbers for last two years, and have never had a bad experience, beer is cold, chicken fingers are great, and atmosphere is very nice."}
{"text":"Worst service in the northeast had to go to the bar after waiting 20 minutes for our drinks then the waitress comes to the table and refuses to serve me when I asked her why it took so long when we were the only customers in there her excuse was she is new. The bartender told us the drinks were made but she hadn't served them and he didn't know why and said he would serve us after talking to him but another 20 minutes passed and the waitress came back and wouldn't even acknowledge those of us at the table that spoke up."}
{"text":"Good food and good service (ask for Cindy, if she's there!).  We come here for lunch from work sometimes."}
{"text":"I have been going to this Timbers for over ten years.  My mother and I normally stop by for breakfast on the weekends.  Sure, there have been times when they are swamped and someone just walked out as we were walking in and we had to wait for a table to be cleared, but its to be expected when its busy.  We have been sitting in Erin's section recently and she is on point.  She is sweet, personable and always willing to do whatever she can to make the experience great.  I can't believe the crap that people write on here just to complain when they don't take the whole situation into consideration.  If a table is leaving as you are walking in, the table will NOT be cleared yet.  If there is even the slightest problem with your food, they WILL correct the situation.  IF you have these issues and they aren't dealt with in a timely manner, you obviously haven't sat in Erin's or Cyndi's section.  For the amount of food that you get, the price is good.  The food is good for bar food.  The only bad thing I can really say is that I'm not a fan of country... but its not loud enough to be obnoxious and I'm not there for the music."}
{"text":"We have eaten here several times since it is near our home, and it is a nice place to get a burger or sandwich. We rarely drink and don't smoke, so I can't really comment on the bar side, and the smoke is slightly annoying to us, but really not too bad.  First breakfast. The hash browns were just weird and didn't taste anything like normal hash browns, but the rest of the breakfast items were very good (including the egg dishes and french toast) and came in large portions. Unfortunately, if you want to change out fries for the hash browns there is an additional charge.  Lunch and Dinner. The burgers and sandwiches are excellent, as are the wings and side salads. Stay away from the chili, as that is really bad.  The food is a bit pricey, but we will continue to go there but only for the burgers, sandwiches, and wings, since we need a good place for those on this side of town."}
{"text":"Told to sit where ever I wanted. Three places that I wanted to sit hadn't been bussed. Constant annoying Country \"music\" playing while the big screen showing the playoff game was muted. Food was a let down, took forever, changed my order to GO!"}
{"text":"Service was terible. Hate to see it if it was busy. Waitress needs to be fired. Manager comped meal due to her incompetence. The only bright spot was the food runner. Poor kid, I can just imagine working for that guy. Hope they don't need local repeats. Never again."}
{"text":"love the staff and food .. always clean . love to gamble .. only thing is i dont smoke and the smoke is always so strong... needs air cleaner or fans!!"}
{"text":"The food was excellent. My son had the Big Bear Breakfast and I had the Lil Bear Breakfast. Our waitress, Cassandra,  recommended the Timbers Screwdriver and I loved it!! Cassandra was nice and friendly. We had excellent service.   We definitely will be back and will definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Superb service they always make it feel like home very friendly professional staff fantastic food Chris is the best bartender ever! Love you guys"}
{"text":"Bartender alicia wasn't friendly ..didn't interact AT ALL ...she only greeted certain customers that she knew ..not good"}
{"text":"Customer service was great made us feel very welcomed food was great and didn't have to wait long for it come hungry very big portions"}
{"text":"Timbers has been my spot since I turned 21. Miss the 35 cent wing Wednesday. Every time i come in here its poppin and always run into somebody I know. Cant ever go wrong with the wings fries."}
{"text":"I love timbers food. Average meal on the menu is about $10. Portions are fairly big not small. I'd rather much pay $10 for a burger and fries or a breakfast here at timbers than go to MCds and spend nearly the same for food that's nowhere near as good.  We always order to go and they make sure you have EVERYTHING you need as if you ate there.  We have ordered a lot of food, including big bear breakfast, wings, burgers, sliders, sandwiches,artichoke cheese dip! EVERYTHING is good. The last burger I tried was the Farmers Burger and I added Guac! I definitely recommend anyone to eat here!"}
{"text":"I loved this Timbers, and I say loved because I won't be back for a while. We walked in and were acknowledged by the bartender but sat there for around 10 minutes and left because no waitresses ever came over or said to give them a few minutes. I seen a few walk from behind the wall but none ever came over... sad"}
{"text":"Refused service due to age, despite sitting in the restaurant section, and no signage stating that this is a bar anywhere."}
{"text":"Stopped by after dinner. Nice atmostphere Relaxing & very clean. I highly recommend it when you don't want a dive bar experience"}
{"text":"The food at this place is not typical bar food.  They have some amazing sliders, meatloaf, fresh burgers and more.  So yummy! Happy hour has 2 for 1 drinks too!  The bar staff and servers are super nice.  During football season they take the pool tables out and put in huge TV Screens instead.  Very cool if you are into that, if not well you will miss the pool tables for a while.  They also have an awesome private space that opens to the bar but is raised off the ground level enough to make it obvious that it is private.  I went here all the time before I moved in Feb."}
{"text":"First time at Timbers. Had Erin as a server and she was fantastic!. Place was busy so the food came out a little slow, but not too bad. We already made plans to return next week."}
{"text":"Like the food, its usually consisitant, but I think they have a new cook, and my husband got the Mountain of Nachos last night, well, usually he can't even finish....well, the portion was really cut down!  Not enough chicken which was a $ upgrade, and never enough cheese, so....really?  Whats the cost in chips??  Not worth the price.  But....that being said, the food and service is always good, thats why i still give it 4 stars.  The smoking, we HATE!!!!!  If there were a better non-smoking resturant closer with the same $$ and food, we'd probably stop going."}
{"text":"I think I like Timbers so much because it reminds me of home.  They have great food, which really surprised me.  When I first walked in I thought, \"Oh, great.  It's dark, smokey & there are weird people playing the slot machines.\"  And then I remember that I live in Vegas now.  It's a tad expensive for my taste but the quality of the food totally makes it worth it.  Plus, they regularly send coupons to our house & that helps with the cost.  You can play video poker & watch any sports game you want.  They also have great happy hours & late night specials.  Now I'm hungry...."}
{"text":"The place is friendly and comfortable.  The menu was just changed.  I'd been several times and liked it but the new menu added a couple of items that looked good.   They have a lot of happy hour specials but I'm not sure the hours stay the same so you should check on that.  Very cool big chairs make for a comfortable place to sit and talk over dinner."}
{"text":"About once a month my friend and I go out to play a bit of video poker and have a few drinks and munchies.  Food (spinach dip/chips) was okay, nothing special.  It was too cold in terms of temperature, service, and ambiance, and it's overpriced.  I think to get a free drink you have to play max bets, which we don't do.  At any rate, after having been here a few times we've decided to go elsewhere."}
{"text":"This place pretty much has what you need.  Large bar with TVs all around, decent selection of beer, and food.  This is pretty much the only place you can get a salad around these parts.  And it's one of the few places in north vegas/nellis that is not a member of scumbagtopia. So I decided to bump it up to 4 stars.  The food is decent and worth a try.  I go here since I work all day long at Nellis and don't feel like heading south for meal.    If it wasn't baseball season I would probably eat someplace else. Like Mexican o Thai."}
{"text":"This was my first time at a Timbers and I thought the food was pretty good for bar food, although it is a little pricey and there are no lunch specials. I got a club sandwich w/ fries and it was such a huge entree that I couldn't finish it all! The waitresses are nice and attentive, and our food, drink and refills flowed out with no issues. I would return if on the far eastside again."}
{"text":"Very expensive bar. Food is mediocre at best. The pool sticks are all destroyed and the waitresses could care less."}
{"text":"If you like a good smoke after your meal, this is the place. Basic bar menu part of a chain. Clean busy but full of smoke. You come out smelling like an ashtray. Definitely a smokers paradise.  If they had a better ventilation system I would rate them higher but I just can't."}
{"text":"Great customer service and the food is very satisfying  definitely couldn't finish my burger nachos, love the ambience definitely relaxing and chill."}
{"text":"Frequent patron with my group. The service is hit or miss, depending on the waitress. Erin is the best -- she is personable, helpful, prompt, and welcoming. Busy or not, her excellent customer service never falters. Most others I've encountered were aloof, did not come by to check on us / likely forgot about us unless we hailed them down, or did not come back with sauces/refills/napkins promptly. Perfect place to watch NFL, NBA, and college games. Great prices and delicious food overall! Wish they had a dessert menu, however. Ps. Order their chicken nachos with extra chicken (cubed)! Thank me later."}
{"text":"This is the far most fucked up bartender I have ever encountered except for Rob. They don't pay attention on me I guess just me. Anyone else they been paying attention on other customers. I had my drink empty for at least 20 minutes. Why don't you get bartenders like this racial as fuck! I'm gonna be most straight up with you in the most appropriate way as possible, get these ladies there act together who ever the owner is. If I don't leave close I don't have to go here.  If there's a rate 0 I would rate this ZERO!"}
{"text":"They have the best service, great food. Bartender and waitresses know us by name, and always make us feel welcomed. Definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Glad to have a neighborhood bar that has such awesome food. Some of my favorites are the chicken Caesar salad, the steak sandwich and the Bozeman beef dip. Enjoy."}
{"text":"Great bartenders and great food.  Hit a couple of jackpots here on keno.  Great gaming promotions and new tvs."}
{"text":"They have good food and drinks. I just wish they had a happy hour special for food! Other than that it's a nice bar to hang out at with a pool table!!"}
{"text":"Walking distance to my apartment. The service is ok . The food is really good . I reccomend the sliders or fish and chips are really good. T.V's are kinda small for a sports bar and grill. I go back for the happy hour 2for 1 bud or margaritas ."}
{"text":"Bomb food. This preggo mama has been looking for the perfect chicken fingers and I found them!!"}
{"text":"Close to home, good food, good drinks and a place to chill on whatever day of the week!!:)"}
{"text":"They have cheesecake!!! Finally shit! Dessert! CHEESECAKE!!!!! Had the chicken fingers and fries, pretty good, also Sarah is a great waitress, keeping our water pitcher filled up. And also she told us about the cheesecake, lifesaver! #milkman #ohmslaw #randomtags #notinstagram"}
{"text":"The TV's in here aren't arranged well, the food was lame, the bartender....Alisha was wicked nice. I would go again if my plan was to just drink beers and play the bar slots but for all other bar and grill purposes I'll go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Sitting at the bar and smoking a cigar. I can tell that Alicia doesn't like cigarette or ciger. So I just drank one beer and went home and finish my ciger. I don't feel welcome in this place cause the bar tender Alicia doesn't like cigar smells. She kept on waving the smell away from her with some paper she had in her hands."}
{"text":"Very much a locals place. Bar tender doesn't attend unless you know their name. I was served cold, soggy nachos. Should have picked another place."}
{"text":"I used to come here a lot when I was younger for breakfast, but today I came here and spent 35 mins waiting for a to go order. They were quick to take my money but very slow with my food. Definitely not coming here again.  AND TO TOP OFF THE LACKLUSTER EXPERIENCE THE FOOD WE GOT WAS WRONG. I mean why ask us what we would like to order if you're just gonna give us something else. I didn't even get my receipt. There wasn't even 6 cars in that big parking lot."}
{"text":"It's a small little bar on the east side of town. It's comfortable and clean on the inside and outside of the building. Timbers has a great selection of food to choose from. The items are priced very well and is affordable for anyone. I went during the Super Bowl and they had a lot of Super Bowl specials going on, which made our experience here that much better. Overall, a great place to visit to catch up with some friends, grab a drink, and eat some good food!"}
{"text":"Food is decent and the beer is usually cold. Sometimes their new staff act like they don't want to be there, but the seasoned staff members are awesome."}
{"text":"I go to Timbers for breakfast, and decided to watch the opening game of foot ball, at night on their new T.V. Well got their oh! no sitting at bar unless you are playing the slots card over the machines, not a good thing to have,.   I could just imagine what would happen if I sat at the bar.  Second I sat at a big table only me and waited 20 mint. to get a waitress to come over her excuse I didn't see you well when you're a waitress   stay off your cell phones and look around,   their should be no cells phone when at work unless you are on a break their is plenty to do, second I informed her I was really up set and she needed to tell the manager , he never came over to talk to me.   I have been a waitress for many years and I could have run circles around them.  I will try  to go again and I will set at the bar and we will see what happens.  First and far most  you do not know me I could be from the head office, you do not know how much money I have and you do not know how much I will tip you.    Get it together on the cold slaw it is terrible use different bun to big for the burger and use different grease in your fryers it is terrible.  Cutting cost can in some ways but it is bad for business. From what I can see your night manager is only think about the food cost, if you get it together  you food cost will go down.  Change the salsa, it has to go  I wouldn't feed it to any of my friends,   Bring back good salsa, bring back good food and you will see the difference Chicken fried steak is not chicken I know every one knows what it is but change it to country steak for get your steaks they are terrible. Put cheese Girts on the menu When that order goes in make sure it comes out fast, I know you have a great cook on the late shift, so the day and evening shift, need to get it together. Away say hello to who even comes in the door and let them know you will be right with them,   never walk by a table  when someone is sitting their always  ask them if they are ready to order.  Night girls and Night Manager need to get it together.  I am hoping that this letter will improve you're you rest."}
{"text":"This afternoon my girlfriend and I order the 6 piece wings with fries ,3 piece tenders ,4 mini sliders , they all came with fries and all the fries were extremely burnt ! On every single order that came with fries , they were literally hard to break in half , it was extremely dissatisfied , we might give this place one more shot sometime in the future hopefully all the fries don't come completely burnt next time , it's really sad because we've lived in the area for around 2 years and this is our first time here and hopefully not the last due to over cooked burnt fries , other then the fries the wings were ok , kinda dry with not a lot of mild sauce on them , the sliders were ok , the meat on the sliders needed salt and pepper and they had like a drip of bbq sauce , the salad was actually really good , the tenders were good but the sauce was just not there"}
{"text":"Pretty good food. I used to come here a lot 5 years ago.  I still think PT's has better wings."}
{"text":"My last stop in Vegas for something to eat,  I have driven by this location several times but never stopped in.  Sunday Football games and plenty of TVs,  I ordered the farm burger,  my wife had breakfast and my daughter had a burger with avocado. Burgers comes with fries and both fries and burger was delicious.  Plenty of choices to sit, tall tables, large booths, or lounge chairs with a table.  I liked both the food and the atmosphere.  I will make sure I stop in for dinner next time I am in town."}
{"text":"Love this place. Good neighborhood place. We like the food and the service is great! Not typical greasy bar food. It's clean and not a smokey bar environment. We have been coming here regularly for sometime. Prices on the menu are great for the food quality."}
{"text":"Great service and food is on point. Large variety of options. Plenty of tv's,  plus a pool table to boot. Very friendly staff and clean."}
{"text":"I think this is a cool little hang out spot for a few snacks and a drink for the locals...BUT...they do not have the NBA package. They ONLY have the NFL games on, so if you want to watch a game other than NFL, it better be on network television.  Prices are reasonable and service is friendly.  Food is good too."}
{"text":"I've been here to eat a few times and everytime I come the food is great and decently priced. Every person I've come here with has been happy as well. Tonight my boyfriend and I came and our server was Tina, she was AMAZING she informed us about their app and in return it saved us 10 bucks on our purchase!!!!!! She was a great server and if your looking for a good meal at a decent price I definitely recommend coming here!"}
{"text":"Erika is really nice. I love this place. Very friendly and clean. I definitely recommend this place if u want to hang out and play pool. The food is delicious. I always order the chicken fried steak. Idk what it's called but the dipping sauce they have for the chips umm... On point. That's all I have to say. So good and very friendly place"}
{"text":"We've been here a couple times I never had an issue with food or the service how ever today we went it I got the bear battered fish my husband got the wings  I don't know why the sauce tasted water down my fish was horrible it had a nasty sour taste I thought it was just that piece as i was eatting into it it was horrible the fish inside had no flavor I was Highly disappointed had a very nasty taste it wasn't even busy for them to take 3 minuets to get a check we go there for there wings but to pay 40 $ on food we didn't eat I won't be going back"}
{"text":"This place is really nice especially if your hanging with friends.I really like the food and the wings are delicious. The waitress Lorena gave us good costumer service.. I will be coming back and i will definitely recommend this place to everyone.         10 stars!!!."}
{"text":"So i came in here to chill afterwork, tired and needed to whine down a lil.  A friend suggested it and for some odd reason i wanted to try a bloody mary and the places that they actually look really good I didn't want to spend $20 bucks and not like it.    I like the taste of the bloody mary Idk if it will be my go to drink but it's ok  the atmosphere in Timber is nice and I like the comfortable chairs.  You are greeted by everyone as you enter the door."}
{"text":"I placed a delivery order for a burger and an order of kettle chips.  The order arrived within a half an hour or so and the delivery driver was friendly and courteous.  The food was good (but a little on the cold side).  The kettle chips were AWESOME!  I asked for a side of ranch dressing, but did not receive it.  Overall, really good food direct to my door in a relatively short period of time.  Next time, I'll probably just place a to go order and pick it up myself to make sure the food is a bit warmer and any requested extras are included."}
{"text":"Great time as always. We had quick service on both the food and drinks. I recommend the chicken wings and teriyaki meatballs. Definitely going back again."}
{"text":"It has changed since before when it was more of a PT's type of setting. The food is good however kinda over priced which all bar food is but the bartenders are kinda rude ... Their pool is kinda lousy as well... All in all it's ok."}
{"text":"The food is great my wife and I love to share the spinach dip and the chicken fingers the staff has changed the manager is new and the prices have gone up"}
{"text":"Trendy and overpriced. Bartenders don't pay much attention. The food is nowhere near worth what they charge for it."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to go to! My boyfriend always gets the wings and fries and I get the chicken fingers or the Yosemite club sandwich. Every time we have gone to Timbers, the food is amazing and the service is wonderful. We never sit at the bar so I'm not sure how it is there but it's my favorite place to eat and relax. Never had any issue here. So thanks to every single one of our servers, you guys are awesome!"}
{"text":"I previously went to Timbers on lakemead & Mt. Hood & experienced great customer service from all the staff at the bar a & especially Kate the kitchen manager was so nice. Kate cooked A+ meals for all my friends & I. The food was excellent. Kate cooks quality food with her experienced professional touch. I give Timbers a 5 Star all the way. Thank you Kate & staff for your great food & customer service. I recommend Timbers with a five star status."}
{"text":"been going here for years mostly during football season the managers and staff during those hours are great the evening manager has a chip on her shoulder like she is the best thing walking she did not care to listen to the complaint that I had she came to my table with an attitude because I felt the treatment from the moment I came in the door was UNPROFESSIONAL  at best and when the simple little child manager came to the table she came with an extremely rude attitude and proceeded to tell me how she felt.. I took it she was on her cycle as she looked sad and uncomfortable in the face.. but it made since if your manager is an incompetent bitch the doesn't care about the safety of her customers, I asked her with three witnesses, then it explains a lot attitude runs down hill!!! I will make sure my friends do not return as there was the smell of prejudice radiating from behind the bar.. Our waitress was sweet attentive and efficient and knowledable and very very very apologetic for her managers shortcomings and understood the reason why two of us did not even place an order for food or drink. Maybe they should try the waitress as manager and move the manager to a more suitable job of toilet licker it may clean her mouth and language so that people don't think she is a simple racist bitch with a bad attitude..."}
{"text":"I loved their food. Could eat it every day except for the lack of customer service.  Every time I go in there I have to look around and find some one to help me. They are not very friendly nor inviting.  They always seem to be caught up with other tasks or speaking to other staff members. what is frustrating is that you see many employees when you walk it and no one seems to make the customer a priority.  I hate it. My  husband won't ever step foot in this location again. For me however, I still try to hold my composure to go here just because the food is too delicious to give up. If there was another closer location I would too not step foot in this location. Food is great I just recommend take out."}
{"text":"My husband and I had an excellent experience at the Timber's.  Our waitress was prompt and friendly.  She spend several minutes finding the our favorite sports on, not one but two tv's near our table.  The manager, Dale, greeted us at our table.  Dale and the cook bent over backwards to make my husband's omelet flat not fluffy.  Dale left us with coupons to come back which we'll do whenever we're in town. And the atmosphere was inviting and NOT smokey.  My fish was lightly battered to perfection and my picky husband was thrilled with his omelets."}
{"text":"I have been eating at this establishment for years! Great food, even though they like to switch up the menu and get rid of favorites.  Huge turnover for waitress staff, poor management! It's sad because I like to feel like Norm from Cheers. :-).  Now the manager treats the employees so poorly that they are all leaving.  The tables are all changed out and I hate the vibe.  Trying to find another lunch hang.  So sad!"}
{"text":"Staff and management here are very friendly and accommodating. A true locals bar."}
{"text":"Favorite all time bar for their delicious spinach and artichoke dip and their wings.  Grew up on the east side and when I moved to the west side any bar food doesn't compare to timbers.  Grew up and Timbers has been there and they never disappoint."}
{"text":"We visited Timbers Lake Mead on Sunday June 18 - there were 5 of us. As always you can expect a shout out Welcome from behind the bar when you walk in and a thanks for coming when you leave and the staff is always great and friendly although I do think they have a high turnover on the waitress side. So, This review and the rating is solely based on 1 of the 3 food items we had and I really think Timers needs to fix this issue. We ordered 2 - 15 piece wings and onion rings - the wings were decent size however the onion rings were way over cooked and on the super crispy side. I ordered based on the description on the menu the crispy chicken sandwich which was described as a JUMBO fried chicken breast.  When you see the word jumbo you would think the breast would at least have been as big as the bun if really not bigger than the bun.  This chicken breast was a true disappointment. It filled maybe have the bun and I have had bigger pieces of chicken on a slider that what was on this bun.  I did complain to the waitress that I was very upset and did not get much of a response except I'm sorry.  You can see by the picture I took what this so called jumbo chicken looked like.  You Decide?  Timbers you should be ashamed of yourself for even serving this to a customer."}
{"text":"Literally this is the only place near or on the lake mead and Hollywood corner that has good food and they don't mess up your order. The atmosphere is great. The service has always been amazing. Two people can eat there for $20 before tip. It's not smokey at all which I like because a lot of bars are way too smokey. I'll definitely be going back because it's the only place worth eating at over on that side of town."}
{"text":"What a horrible service DAVE give to the customers.... texting on his phone while people waiting to order.... rude bartender... forgot to ring in my pick up order and make me wait 20 minutes.... everyone else I  this place are very polite and Profesional.... dunno what a guy like this is still doing here.... not the first time"}
{"text":"This place is pretty chill. I like to go here late sometimes but it is quiet and chill."}
{"text":"Timbers...... You had me at your Pitchers.  Then, just when I thought our romance couldn't be true, you whispered \"I have wings\"."}
