{"text":"Tried this restaurant the first time and ordered take-out and home delivery.  We were not impressed.  Food was lukewarm on arrival.  Spring rolls were average.  Hot and Sour soups were loaded with corn starch.  There were not much substance inside the soup.  The Chicken Wings were dry and tasteless.  Dry Fried Beef Hor Fan (flat rice noodle) has humongous chunk of beef that were tasteless and tough.  Cantonese Vermicelli was a bit better but again the BBQ Pork and Chicken slices were huge.  All dishes were tasteless and unappetizing.  This is not authentic Chinese food.   We were very disappointed and will not order from here again.  We did heat up our food in our microwave to try to improve the taste.  Didn't work."}
{"text":"Went for the first time yesterday. Found one of the best fried rice's I've had (house fried rice). Planning on going again and trying other dishes. I ordered to go, service seemed friendly."}
{"text":"This is a joke of a place to eat. Not worth a first look. If you are looking for a place to eat that's cheap you can save your 2 cents and look for a better place. Please I beg you to look for somewhere else just look hard and long away from this place."}
