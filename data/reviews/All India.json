{"text":"I absolutely loved my meal (chicken tandoori) and the meal of my girlfriend (chicken tikka)! We had a very nice waitress as well as a very helpful staff which constantly took care of us and our drinks even as our waitress was busy. Also $2 off any entree if you show your student ID. If you want authentic feeling and tasting, All India is the place. Only thing that drops this restaurant down to 4 stars was that the restaurant was slightly stuffy and a bit warm and also the Chassa drink we ordered was unforgivably horrible (of no fault to the restaurant, we just had never had it before)"}
{"text":"The husband was craving indian food and saw that they have 1/2 priced dishes on some nights.  So we headed over to give it a try and were pleasantly surprised.

Nice decor with a more fancy atmosphere.  Service was attentive and it wasn't too crowded.

I can't comment on the authenticity, but we enjoyed our chicken vindaloo and our Thali dishes.  I ordered my dishes at a 5 spicyness and it was just right!"}
{"text":"I gave the 3 stars for the food based on the price. Food is ok here and options are good. However, they can not have the hot or warm naan and everything which are fired taste bad! Services is not very good here. Asked for hot water more than twice, still gave me the cold water. They need more people!"}
{"text":"Beautiful atmosphere, friendly service and a great meal. Best of all, this place is very reasonable. Entrees ranged from around $8-12 and the buffet is $6 for lunch and $7 for dinner (available Thursday through Sunday). I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Chicken tikka kabab is delicious. Portion sizes are very generous. I've been here atleast 4 times last week for take away."}
{"text":"Vegan and gluten free (sometimes incorrectly) marked on buffet. Selection very impressive but taste wasn't the best I've had in Pittsburgh..the flavors just weren't anything to write home about but we were fed. $10 for lunch buffet. Gulab jamun somehow was not tasty at all"}
{"text":"I work just down the street from here and, on the advice of a colleague, tried the place out for the lunch buffet today. I have to say, it was quite delicious. Very large selection (including a lot of vegetarian dishes). Most of the time, you go to an Indian buffet and, before you even get there, you already know what there will be because a lot of places just phone it in with the usual palak paneer, aloo gobi, chicken tikka masala, etc. While all those were present here, they had a lot of things I've never gotten to try before, like jalebi (think India's answer to a funnel cake), that were delicious. Really, the only thing I wasn't a huge fan of was the one shrimp dish on the buffet (which suffered from overcooked shrimp). 

Furthermore, I was greatly impressed by the staff actually seeking my opinion on the buffet and looking for constructive criticism. It shows that they actually care and want to make it an enjoyable dining experience for their patrons. Places like Oakland have no shortage of Indian restaurants but this is going to be my go-to for Indian when I'm in the area. 

Definitely give it a try."}
{"text":"tl;dr summary: It used to be better and now it's nasty. Would be 1 star if not for previous experiences that were more reasonable. 

Food: Not fresh. The deep fried appetizers taste like they're from the freezer. The naan is thin and crispy and stale. The menu is pretty big, but lacks some of my usual favorites (e.g. aloo mattar... they have mattar vindaloo which they claim is equivalent, but it's not the same sauce or spices). The plain sweet lassi, both of the two times I've ordered it, was definitely spoiled (you can taste that the yogurt has turned). 

Service: Usually friendly and attentive. Last time we went, though, people weren't very nice. But this doesn't factor into my review, star wise, as I don't care that much about service. 

Ambiance: First thing you see when you come in is a huge sure that's always got Bollywood videos. This would be fine, but the volume they play them at is insane. Was hard to talk. But I noticed that there are only speakers on one side of the room so maybe the other side would be better."}
{"text":"I get take-out from here all the time and it's always pleasant. The wait time is always very short and they happily make changes to dishes, which is great for dietary restrictions. Portion sizes are great, however the rice to gravy ratio is lacking so I'd suggest getting an extra side of rice and then you could easily feed 2 people."}
{"text":"I went to All India last night with a friend, and the food was so good that I feel compelled to write a review and tell everyone about what a great experience we had.  Now, admittedly I'm no expert on Indian food, but I have to say that All India has the best Indian food I've ever had.  I got the Chicken Tikka Masala, which is my favorite Indian dish, and I thought it was absolutely incredible - I like to get it as hot as it can get, but the spiciness was not overpowering.  It was just right.  The flavor was rich and delicious.  My friend got the Butter Chicken and he let me try it, and that was also amazing.  The naan was out of this world, very buttery and soft and flavorful.  It definitely beats the naan I've had at other places.  We also got the All India Platter as an appetizer - chicken tikka, lamb kabab, samosa, fish amritsari, and vegetable pakora - and everything on it was marvelous.  The service was excellent and very generous with refilling drinks.  The atmosphere in the restaurant was wonderful, very nice, and low-key lighting.  I would go back here in a heartbeat and I'm going to recommend it to all of my friends.  Thank goodness it's close to where I work!!"}
{"text":"This is by far the worst Indian restaurant in the area. I came in for dinner late Tuesday evening with a empty restaurant their was no host/hostess to seat me so I waited around 5 min to get a table. Asked for a mango lassi the server brought out a coke! Ok do u see were things are going. I ordered the chicken curry with garlic bread. Took like 30 min with an empty restaurant, unbelievable! They use dark meat in thier curries and it was cooked so far thru that it became shreds and the naam was burnt from behind. Overall not a good experience food was one of the worst I had in Pittsburgh. Will not be back."}
{"text":"The food is good and so is the staff. I visited the place today .. It's taste is good but it's not that spicy .. If you are looking for something really spicy then I won't recommend you this place.. But otherwise it's nice place to fine in"}
{"text":"This is a very good restaurant! Excellent service, reasonable prices, lovely atmosphere ( even Bollywood films on the tv), wonderful food especially the thalis. I really like their South Indian dishes including the different breads.  For vegetarians All India will be a rare treat."}
{"text":"I recently wrote a review of India Garden, lamenting the decline of a former standby. I subsequently learned that the former owner of India Garden sold the restaurant and opened this new place, All India. I had the lunch there today and was delighted to discover the old India Garden reborn and even somewhat improved, with a wide selection of generally good quality items. I expect to return to All India regularly."}
{"text":"The buffet spread is generous and even includes masala tea and various street foods like chaat and chhole bhature. The low rating is because the quality of the food is highly uneven. It's not that the ingredients are bad. It's that they have a rather poor cook. The food simply doesn't taste good. For example, the coconut chutney is so watered down as to taste like bland water. Dals and vegetables taste bland. They might have two or three cooks, so it's a complete gamble as to whether you eat there on a day when the cook is good. Out of 4 times I've eaten there, only one has had a reasonably decent cook. It's as if they hired someone who goes through the motions, but knows that the people who come there are Americans who will like whatever they throw together. Get better cooks please!!"}
{"text":"The area is bad, parking virtually nonexistent but the food is GREAT.  A little pricy for what you get but what you get is good.  The Manchurian Mushrooms are the best bet!"}
{"text":"I was there for the lunch buffet yesterday.  Everything was delicious and the staff did a great job!"}
{"text":"I probably can't say enough about this place . I have been here twice and my experience with the extremely friendly staff and food quality has been great. I have only had the buffet, not the regular menu but I can imagine it's just as excellent. I've always been a huge fan of Indian buffets and it's hard to find an operation that gets it and does it right. This establishment gets it. The atmosphere is pretty authentic, nice, upscalish with nice decor with a traditional touch. The buffet food offerings are just terrific and very flavorful. Refreshed constantly and hot. This is easily my first choice in the Burgh for Indian buffet."}
{"text":"The dinner buffet has a great selection of delicious food. I love that vegan options are labeled clearly. Will definitely come back and bring friends."}
{"text":"I went with my dad for the lunch buffet on a Saturday. I've become a fan of Indian food, and this place has the largest variety of any Indian buffet I've ever been to--an extensive salad bar, appetizer-type foods, chutneys, at least eight different entree-type dishes (including vegetarian and vegan options), two types of rice, naan, dosa, three desserts, chai tea... It's about $10 per person, and with ID, students get a $1 discount on the buffet ($2 off entrees). I had a great time trying to sample everything and enjoyed it all.

The owner was friendly and our glasses of water were kept full. My only complaint is that we were seated by the door, so whenever it opened, we got a blast of chilly air.

I had a great lunch here, and the next time I want lots of Indian food, I'm going here for sure!"}
{"text":"My daughter has been raving about this place.  I went on a Tuesday night, where some menu items are 50% off.   The waiter was informative and kind, the portion of food was just right, the atmosphere was a 100% better than I expected for its location.  I do understand what the other reviewer meant when he talked to the manager and got a blank stare - that is what I got when asked about the 50% off, and placing an order to go.  Until he finally said, not on the 50%.  I would certainly go back."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurant in Pittsburgh.  Great lunch & Dinner Buffet with varieties of starter, Veg, non veg food, desserts and also they have salad bar just for $10. The food is delicious.  It's spacious and big restaurant with Beautiful deco.  Good customer service."}
{"text":"Sad to say, but I am disappointed. My go to dish to try at an Indian restaurant that I haven't been to before is kadai paneer. I asked for medium spice but when I received the dish the \"spice\" amounted to tons of black pepper which didn't allow for the rest of the spices in the dish to stand out. The paneer itself was very rubbery in texture. Alas, my search for better Indian food in Pittsburgh continues."}
{"text":"I went to this hotel yesterday for dinner, their buffet was pathetic. My wife and I could not eat anything, it was not fresh at all. The service was poor, he charged me $13 per plate. Overall a very bad experience, will not go back there."}
{"text":"The food is OK quality. However, the customer service is atrocious. I've waited multiple times for significantly longer times than what I was quoted over the phone and time and again I was told (...it'll be another 5 min..) which leads to a much longer wait. The least I expect is basic courtesy from the staff when they are way off but not at All India. Stay away..."}
{"text":"Their buffet selection is great, and the food is good too. Though some of the items like the rice and curries were cold. The dining room is very dark, I wish it was a bit brighter; this makes it hard for me to return as the restaurant dining room lacks a good ambiance."}
{"text":"Worst Indian buffet in Pittsburgh. I used to go twice a week. I never got fresh food. Going to all India is waste of money."}
{"text":"Still no change to this place. It's still disgusting and food inedible. Please Pittsburghers
don't  let a buffet attract you to this restaurant, the Owner of India Garden is the same 
as All India!!! If they had mice and roaches and the health dept. shut them down what do you expect of this place remember guys same owners."}
{"text":"For the $11 buffet, I can see why people (students) come here.  It's a bargain for all you can eat, even if most of it is dry and tasteless. But pretty much everything else leaves a lot of room for improvement. There are at least 4 or 5 waiters roaming around in circles, and you're never sure which one is actually the one taking care of you. The vindaloo lamb I ordered had a pretty good sauce but was skimpy on the lamb and not properly trimmed. It seemed from the get-go the waiter assumed we were both getting the buffet, because why bother with anything else. Our check took at least 10 minutes to arrive.

Decor bordered on psychedelic. Cutlery was slightly ridiculous, drinking out of metal chalice cups. Authentic it certainly isn't. Just know what you're going in there for."}
{"text":"This is the worst restaurant which I would ever experience in US. There food quality is rotten, mix ajinnomotto to make food fresh. When I complained they misbehaved over phone. Big NO to this restaurant."}
{"text":"So far this is my favourite Indian Buffett in pittsburgh. Wide selection of vegan menu and my friends say the goat is very good as well. Some other Indian restaurant is as good in terms of flavours but if you are vegan or veggie, please come to All India."}
{"text":"Decent Indian and decent service. Nothing to write home about, but good if you're looking for a buffet and don't mind spending upwards of $10."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE!  After a terrible Indian food experience years back, I was convinced that I didn't like Indian food.  Since it was so close, I decided that I'd give it another try...and I'm hooked!  I've had the buffet every time that I've been here and every time it's been amazing.  Everyone that works here is super nice and the food is great!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has awesome service and great food. The buffet is huge and has a wide selection, so it'd be tough to find something you don't like. I was nervous about how spicy the food might be, but I was able to find dishes with just enough spice for me. I think they do a good job of catering to every type of guest weather you want extra spicy or not so much. Definitely a great place to eat right in Oakland. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"30 minutes after eating here I was in my house and I puked all over myself and in my room. I even fainted a few times, kept going in and out of consciousnesses. And this is coming from a Indian guy."}
{"text":"Decent buffet and food, lacking on service.  It took forever to just get us some waters."}
{"text":"So, I finally went to the actual physical location of All India, instead of ordering takeout.  So the parking situation... mild disaster.  Apparently there are more than just the three maybe four parking spaces at All India.  Where are these extra spaces you ask?  Indeed, I too asked because for the life of me I had no idea.  Apparently to the right side of the building there is an alley leading to a parking lot.  Unfortunately, this evening there was a car specifically parked blocking the entire alley/ hill thing.  Oh well.  I ended up \"making my own space\" in front of the restaurant as i was unable to appreciate any lined spaces.  (Don't worry I clarified inside that I wasn't taking a drivers spot and/or wouldn't be towed).  
The waitress was a little off putting as I was completely ignored such that my dinner order almost wasnt even taken.  Then when my fellow dinner guests went to the buffet.. those remaining at the table were asked to repeat everyone elses orders while she WROTE THEM DOWN this time.... If i had known there would be a quiz about other peoples orders... I probably would have taken notes myself.  Also, this other random waiter kept coming to our table reasking for our orders  and likewise rolled up with the check before we could even try to order dessert.  Mildly rude...  
On the other side,  I still stand by my previous review on the food.  It is amazing.  Lots of gluten free options.  The chicken kadai was on point this evening!   The decorations were pretty good as well.  Overall my in house experience is a low 2 star and the delivery experience is a 5 which averages to the above 3 star."}
{"text":"This place lingered in near obscurity when it first opened a few years back.  They stayed strong and were rewarded with one of the most consistently packed places in the area.  Maybe it's because they finally got rid of the silly limited buffet and went full time with it.  Indian food is a fickle creature for those of us who weren't raised on it.  It behooves us to try mostly everything.  Most people would agree that chicken tikka masala (the general tso's of indian food) is probably the most accessible, but why would you just get that?  If you only get tikka masala here, you're worse than those people you knew in high school who ordered the burger when it was all you can eat wings night (those people today are now in loveless marriages, AT BEST.  Most likely still living in their parents basement and being very indignant on social media as if their opinion means anything, to hell with them).  I guess the point of this drivel is this: GET THE BUFFET.  It is a smorgasbord of delicious flavors.  My personal favorite is their chicken chili and mushroom manchurian (the latter isn't always on there, but it is delightful).  For those of use with the eating disorder known as veganism, this makes me more empathetic to your misguided stance (for those of you morally righteous college students, veganism is the ULTIMATE privilege).  All of the vegan options here are rich and flavorful.  Wow..did I get personal there.  Anyways....

Naan is probably the current championship belt holder in the World Bread Federation.  Pita has made some strong strides, and Italy was reigning for so long (a la Bruno Samartino, thus capping off this brilliant analogy), but I think garlic naan wins and will hold the title for a long time.  All India's garlic naan is untouchable.  I love when they bring it out onto the buffet and you open up the tray, only to get a faceful of garlic steam, like vampire pepper spray, but since I'm human, I remain undeterred and dig in.  Naan also is basically an edible spoon, which sops up the delicious sauce soup (which doesn't sound delicious at all, but trust me, I have no reason to deceive you) that ends up on your plate.  

All India is great...not high art...but when you have so many A's, you don't need a valedictorian (this sounds kind of profound, but the more I read into it, it makes zero sense, but for the integrity of the review, I must keep the stream of consciousness flowing).

The ever so slightest complaint though...the water service can be a little slow when they are backed up.  With all of the dishes they serve, you will inevitably get dry-mouthed.  But this is so small, I can't ding them a star.  

IF THIS RESTAURANT WERE A MUSICIAN/BAND:  Bob Marley.  A great introduction for those of us not ingrained in the reggae music..it should be all you really need to appreciate it."}
{"text":"I love their lunch buffet. On a day off I'll wander in and enjoy a leisurely lunch all by myself. I like the selection of vegetarian dishes, though I usually have to get some goat curry and chilly chicken to satisfy my inner cave man. 

They just instituted a $15 minimum on credit cards which is going to cut down on future visits. Lunch buffet with a lassi comes to about $14.50 - already a splurge for lunch. They made an exception for me since I didn't have cash. But I don't like to hassle about if I have cash on hand before going out, and there are plenty of other restaurants that aren't going to fuss over a credit card. I'll probably head to Udipi instead when I'm feeling like something vegetarian and Indian. They don't have a buffet, but I dare you to try and finish an entire lunch there!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice, once for lunch and once for dinner, and had the buffet both times.  I have no regrets because this buffet is completely awesome.  

My experience here started when I walked in the door and smelled food.  Not just any food, though: delicious food with reasonable spiciness.  I walked further in and got a table, and the smell just got stronger.

Everything here is labeled as to whether it's vegetarian, vegan, and gluten-free.  The entire salad bar area is gluten-free, the pakora and idli are gluten-free, the rices are gluten-free, and a bunch of the curries are too.  I don't know about the meat dishes because I'm vegetarian, and even if you eat meat you're likely to get caught up on all the delicious veg stuff before you even make it down to where the meat is.  So labeling is taken care of, and you probably know what you can and can't eat at this point.  

For me being allergic to part of the available offerings was probably to my advantage, because the food here is amazing and if there were more stuff I could have eaten I'd have been at risk for eating until I hurt or possibly making myself sick.  I regret that I had only one stomach to offer for each meal, but I'd like to think that I made the best use of it I could and tried everything I thought I could handle, all of which was delicious and well-made.  I was also delighted to find a few dishes I hadn't encountered before in my various travels - I'm pretty familiar with Indian food, I cook a lot of it at home, and I'd like to think I know my stuff decently.  So when I encounter a dish I'm not familiar with in an environment where I know it's safe to try it, that's pretty much the best thing ever.  

The food is delicious, service is good, the space is nice, and the biggest thing I am sad about is that I don't live in Pittsburgh so I can't go here very often."}
{"text":"Doing a number on the buffet has been a bit of a monthly goal as of late. Great food and Plenty of variety. The servers are polite and attentive as well. 

What can I say? It's the only place I chose to go to for Indian. Why waste time talking when there's fantastic Indian food to be enjoyed?!?"}
{"text":"Very solid buffet.  The naan bread here is the best I've had in Pittsburgh.  

Pro tip:  They're BYOB, so go to Chief's next door, grab yourself a 6 of Heineken or MGD, and go to town."}
{"text":"I've only ever had the lunch buffet. Selection is good, food ok but many off the hot buffet item are usually only warm (in temperature)."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Indian buffet in the US. Great selection of vegetarian items both in the lunch and dinner buffets. The food is always hot, and fresh. Appetizers include a few items from the following: pakoras, uttapams, samose, chole bhature, Indian style pasta, pav bhaji, spring rolls etc. Main course includes dal makhani, matar paneer, aloo gobhi, vegetable biriyani, and other vegetable curries like okra, mix vegetable, palak paneer, sambhar etc. The naans are generally plain and garlic naans.  They have a number of non-vegetarian appetizers and main course curries too. There are generally 2-3 desserts: gulab jamun, gajar barfi, rice kheer etc. The salad bar includes atleast two fruits, numver of Indian chutnies, raita, and other salad items. Definitely the best Indian restaurant in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"I have not had a bad dish there yet...... And I've been there quite a bit. This has become my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"Recently went for a dinner buffet. Oh wow. What goat curry and butter chicken curry. And I'm almost vegetarian!! (Almost - I just take the curries) 
Large variety. Even my picky toddler had plenty to choose from. 
Will so go back."}
{"text":"Went back today. Everything is still super tasty.

I read the other review about the goat being chewy... I don't eat meat so, I know nothing about that, but I have brought several different people here and everyone thinks it's good.

The service seems to have a few kinks that still need to be worked out, but if you just ask someone (anyone) they are all more than willing to help you."}
{"text":"All India has such a nice ambiance. I really like the décor and the brass goblet. Their service is quick and efficient and the buffet affordable. Came here for the lunch buffet, which was $9 with the student discount. 
 
As for the food options, there were plenty of vegetarian dishes. This is the first Indian buffet I've been to that serves fish on their buffet. All the dishes were fresh and tasty. As for spice level, this buffet is not spicy at all. The naan was a bit too thick for my liking, I wish they were thinner. The chai tea was delicious though! After stuffing your face, I highly recommend washing it all down with a warm cup of chai. 
 
If you are looking for a good Indian buffet in the area with many vegetarian options and little spice level, this is your place. Comparing to other Indian restaurants in the area, the heat at All India is pretty tame. I left with all my taste buds intact."}
{"text":"Some of the best Indian Buffet restaurant ever visited. The selection is huge. They even have good variety far vegetarian and non veg. I don't see masala tea, ladoo, small dhosa, samosa on buffet but they serve here. Its really clean and well managed.Service is really good.  From price stand point ($9.00 lunch on.Sunday) its a deal. I will go there again and encourage u to try"}
{"text":"Went to All India with a friend who was in town and staying nearby. Luckily since it was Pitt's spring break, we easily found a spot on one of the side streets. I've since heard that there is a small lot behind the building, so maybe can park there next time.

There was only one other table filled when we showed up on a Monday evening, and after they left, only one other group came and we were there a little over 2 hours. I thought a buffet would be a good place to catch up with my friend since we wouldn't feel like we were keeping waitstaff from a paying table like at a restaurant. I didn't expect it to be that empty though. We were done eating after probably 45 minutes-1 hr, but the waitress kept our water cups filled and let us take our time chatting. We didn't feel rushed at all and she brought our check when we decided we were ready for it.

Not the best Indian restaurant, but the buffet is pretty big with a ton of vegetarian options. We loved the manchurian mushrooms. I liked that there were a bunch of dishes that I've never seen at Indian buffets before.I thought the food was good and didn't taste dried out, or like it had been sitting on the buffet too long. We saw them changing out dishes while we were there.

I've defintiely had better Indian food at other places, but like the choices this buffet offers, and it's close, so really easy for us to get to. I'd defintiely go back."}
{"text":"First time eating here this week and the ambiance made me feel like I was in India and the food was delicious.  We had the lunch buffet and it was very good."}
{"text":"I never thought I'd say it, but at long last, I've found an Indian restaurant that makes food I can actually eat!

For years Indian food has been a very rare treat I only indulge in when my Indian friends have been kind enough to make dinner or bring a dish to a potluck. In my experience restaurants have often made their Indian foods too spicy or too \"Americanized\" - not to mention used far too many fatty ingredients and oils that just made me sick.

So the fact that I could stuff my face at All India, without feeling sick and while being able to enjoy my food, makes me happier than I can even explain. I came here with a large group of friends for a celebration; throughout the evening our waiter was very kind and considerate. There were a few moments here and there where we'd find that we were unable to flag him down to get refills, and occasionally it would take a while to get something like an appetizer or even the checks from from. It was a little odd seeing as the place looked mostly empty aside from our large group, but then again, we were a very large group, so I'm honestly willing to let a few delays go, especially since the waiter really was very nice - he always confirmed just how spicy we wanted our dinners and was happy to answer any and all questions our large group had about the menu.

As for the food? I just...yum! I personally ordered the butter chicken - tender chicken cooked in a nut and tomato sauce and served with warm rice. Honestly eating that dish was heavenly. It was perfectly cooked, seasoned, was as spicy (well, not spicy) as I requested...I couldn't get enough of it! Words cannot describe how happy I was to eat something that good after my many negative experiences with Indian restaurant dishes. I had the chance to try some of my friends dishes and sides as well, so I can also promise that their yogurt is absolutely amazing (seriously, try something with the yogurt - you'll be glad you did!) as was one of the spinach-stuffed vegetarian options.

I really want to come back here to explore more on All India's menu. Thank you All India for the wonderful experience and meal - you'll see me again!"}
{"text":"This place is my favorite Indian buffet in all of Pittsburgh. I only get the buffet here, which is the largest, cleanest buffet I've been to. Vegetarian options galore! My favorites at the buffet (though I believe you should try a little of everything)!

-Hot chai tea
-Appetizer bar sauces: get the fried veggie fritter balls and pour the red, brown, and green sauces / chutneys on them. 
-Chicken tikka masala
-Poori (fried puffy bread) and naan (bread in the back)
-Aloo gobi (fried cauliflower)
- saag paneer (cooked spinach )
- biryani with nuts and raisins 

Sometimes they chance the buffet up in terms of variety, but this is what I come for!

The service has an attitude, or resting grump face. Pay at the counter. Don't leave too much wasted food on your plate or they may threaten to charge you a wastefulness fee. 

I love the Bollywood music videos they play here, but this last time I went, I was bummed because the music of the restaurant was not the music that matched up to the music videos.  More dancing!"}
{"text":"They have a large selection of items, and everything is fresh and well-seasoned. The servers are friendly, attentive, and never rush you through a meal (even when the restaurant is jam-packed). I can't recommend All India enough!"}
{"text":"Very unassuming from the front. Inside is a bit dark. The food is fantastic! This is the best Tandoori chicken I have ever had. Naan is delicious, and the sag paneer is flavorful without being over creamy. Best Indian food in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"I think this is the best Indian buffet food I've ever had. A wide range of vegetarian options, full flavor, hot bread served to your table and amazing service. Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Worst Buffet EVER. I will never go and will not recommend any south indian to go to this place.  I went for sunday's buffet along with my husband. I'm veggie and my husband - a non vegetarian. 
1. Buffet didn't have veggie biryani or a non - veg biryani. 
2. Items in the buffet were not tasty and we not even appealing
3. They had sarson ka saag and makki dii roti. I only liked the taste particular dish from buffet - I felt like having a second serving - the second one had a long hair strand in the curry - it came into my mounth. Ekkkk.... At ones I didn;t like to taste any other dishes.
4. My husband additionally ordered a lamb biryani as he didn't like the taste of the non- veg items in the buffet - the biryani was horrible, tasted like tamarind rice with lamb pieces half cooked.
5. When we complained to the manager - there was no proper treatment/ reception. 

PLEASE DO NOT go by the ratings. This is worst restaurant and we have regrets of not going into resular visit place - tamarind restaurant and for having tried this one going by the ratings."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh. Their food is fresh and consistently good in taste and quality. The buffet is overwhelming with plenty of vegetarian, non vegetarian and vegan options. On weekends, they have chicken biryani on buffet, which is apparently the best biryani I've ever had in Pittsburgh. The staff is very friendly and their service is pretty good. This place is a must try for every Indian food lover!"}
{"text":"Not so authentic. Tried some foods from the menu. They tasted alright. Buffet has variety but not tasty. Tried the buffet several times though"}
{"text":"Best Indian Buffet in Pittsburgh! Fantastic selection of food, everything I tasted was amazing. Clear labels on the vegan options, of which there are a ton! The cauliflower (gobi) dish is amazing, the chole is fantastic, but there was also a mushroom manchurian dish that blew my mind...I should just stop and say to go try it for yourself, it's really worth it. The place is also super clean and has a great atmosphere, with a very friendly and attentive staff. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Solid offerings in this place that is owned by the former creator/owner of India Garden over on Atwood Street which is currently being mis-managed by the new owners.  
Really nice attractive interior decor in here .  Very very colorful and cheery looking inside whereas some other Indian restaurants can be very dingy and just eerie, inside.  This guy has spent a lot of cash on the interior decor, for sure .
My only complaint is that the hours of operation are listed as 11:30 - on but they will tell you they are not open yet or that the food is not ready until 12:00 noon or so .  I wish they'd resolve that issue or just change their hours to 12:00 - on .  
Highly recommended you try the buffet to sample a wide variety of their dishes ."}
{"text":"Without a doubt, this is the best Indian restaurant in the 'Burgh. I haven't had a buffet this overflowing with vegetarian options since my days trolling Devon Ave. in Chicago for samosas. The food is artfully and thoughtfully prepared, with spice levels that changed from dish to dish, and truly interesting flavor combinations. I was blown away. I can't remember the last time I ate at an Indian buffet where the choices were so many that I couldn't sample everything. You actually need a game plan when dining here. They offered the mini masala dosa with sambar and coconut chutney on my visit. While the mini dosas aren't as crispy as the larger ones I've had (probably because they make them ahead of time) these were still delicious, and the sambar was excellent. Everything was excellent, from the veg pakora, which were perfectly fried and delicious, to the dal, which was rich and creamy, to the fresh broccoli and potatoes, the eggplant masala, the saag paneer...I could go on, but you get the drift. They had 3 dessert choices too. Over the top. The best part is, if you can't get to the lunch buffet, they serve up a dinner buffet on Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday nights. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"This was the best Indian buffet I've had in Pittsburgh. Great selection of vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes, fresh and hit food, delicious chai tea and a nice ambiance. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"If you're looking authentic north Indian food, this is *the* place to go. I emphasize north because the naans, chicken butter masala, fish amritsari are awesome. But if you look for south Indian dishes like dosa, idli, you might be disappointed. The punjabi dishes are the best picks in the neighborhood, and possibly in whole of Pittsburgh. I have never had such a fulfilling Indian dinner in US before. Mention you're a student to get a dollar off. Also, the masala chai or spiced tea is a nice add-on which I love."}
{"text":"Having only sampled the lunch buffet twice, I don't feel qualified to say whether or not this is the best Indian restaurant around town, but it's certainly the best Indian buffet I've had in Pittsburgh. I'll have to sample the standard menu before passing judgment on the rest of the restaurant.

The lunch buffet is, for lack of a better word, sprawling. There are plenty of vegetarian and non-vegetarian choices available as well as soup, salad, dessert, etc. Pretty much your standard buffet fare, but with a wider variety than usual.

Decor inside is clean and modern, and although the service is a little spotty, that's probably just due to opening pains."}
{"text":"buffet is so disappointing. The quality of the food itself is so sick. No point having a meal here...!!!"}
{"text":"Used to be so good don't know what happened.

The past few times we have ordered take out have been extremely disappointing. Last time we ordered, we ordered mutter paneer and and there was not a single pea in the dish. It was a few cubes of paneer in sauce. 

Tonight we placed a $60 order. Besides completely leaving out one of our entrees our mutter paneer was all peas maybe five cubes of paneer. We called to ask about our forgotten entree and the girl on the phone asked if they could take care of it at a later date. We said no we wanted to eat our dinner tonight. 

Very disappointing as this was one of our go to late night take out spots.

Won't be ordering again."}
{"text":"Very authentic Indian good and great customer service. The buffet is well worth the price and great options."}
{"text":"The first time I went to All India, I found it to be pretty good. The food looks like food at a typical buffet, like it's been sitting there for a bit, but there was a large selection of different dishes and everything tasted great. Plus, as a student, I was able to get $1 off of the lunch buffet. (Hey, every dollar counts!)

The second time I went, it was not very good. I would say avoid going towards the end of their lunch hours - you get left with old food because they don't bring anything new out when they're about to close. Sounds like common sense but we didn't think about it and it wasn't good.

Both times, we had one nice server and one guy who came around who wasn't nice. I would say the service leaves something to be desired. Also, the ambiance is a little depressing. They keep it quite dark (though the water goblets are wicked cool and look like something from Game of Thrones). My boyfriend, who's from India, thought he had found a place he could go to every week for some good Indian food, but I think we'll have to keep looking."}
{"text":"I came here with two friends last night for dinner after Bhangra in the Burgh (a Punjabi dance competition).  I'd been wanting to try this place for awhile, given the positive reviews, and this presented the perfect opportunity to do so.  We weren't able to try the buffet, since it was a Sat. night, so we all decided to get different versions of the thali and share dishes, which gave us a good sampling of the offerings.

Based on this sampling, I (and both of my friends) felt that the quality of the dishes was somewhat uneven.  I ordered the non-veg thali, one friend ordered the curries and grill thali, and the other ordered the vegetarian thali.  The chicken tandoori was pretty good, but rather small in quantity, and the chicken tikka masala was mediocre and kind of oily (I've had much better quality versions of this dish elsewhere).  I didn't try the lamb curry, since I don't eat lamb, but my friends tried it and said it was decent.  The same could be said for the garlic naan (hard to mess that up).  The rice pudding was quite bland--I could hardly taste the seasoning that's customarily included with this dish.  My friend who ordered the curries and grill thali found the goat curry that comes with it inedible.  He hadn't eaten goat before, so he tried one piece and found that it consisted of a bone with very little meat, and then tried another, which was gristly, and then another, which was tough--at that point, he gave up.  He found the other dishes okay to decent.  The same applies to my friend who ordered the vegetarian thali.  We ordered spice levels of 3-4, and found them significantly hotter than we'd like.  Good thing the yogurt-cucumber sauce was included, and we ordered lassi...

I think our experience can be best summed up in the words of my one friend: \"I've had better Indian food\" [down the street].  Given the high ratings, I was expecting to enjoy my meal more, and for the food quality to be more consistent across the board.  Having said that, I understand that this place is primarily known for their buffet, which I'll have to return to try (I'll update if/when I do).  The aspect of our experience that we enjoyed the most was watching the Bollywood-esque Hindi music videos, and noticing that the lights were synchronized to the music.  3.5 stars."}
{"text":"I ordered chicken biryani and chicken pakora through Uber eats. This was the worst biryani I had ever ate. I suspect this restaurant is run by Indian. It is nothing but rice mixed with tomato sauce and few chunks of chicken. Really??? I don't know why this restaurant is having 4 stars. The chicken pakora??? Made with besan flour like mirchi bajji... are you kidding me? This is a fake Indian restaurant. No body does chicken pakora like that in India. Not even worth 1 star."}
{"text":"I tried the lunch buffet and I was sorely disappointed. It was very bland and slightly sweet. Nothing was terrible (although the goat curry seemed to have excessive bone in it), but nothing was particularly good. I realize it was the buffet, which tends to be more mild, but this wasn't mild. This was just bland.
On the plus side it was very gluten free / vegan friendly. I might return if someone needed that. Otherwise I doubt I would go back. Also the chicken chili was pretty good."}
{"text":"As someone who has been to India and grew up near the US's largest Indian diaspora in New Jersey, I think I can say that All India has to be one of the best venues for Indian food in the country. A dish of mughlai lamb was served at the right level of spiciness with expert flavor, the naan was perfectly charred, and the condiments were clearly prepared in house. The ubiquitous green chutney served at Indian restaurants had a serious depth of flavor - maybe All India has a secret coriander connection, maybe they grow it themselves, but that chutney is worth the whole meal right there. I thought moving from the east coast to Pittsburgh meant giving up on finding expert expressions of the cuisines of certain countries, but with the discovery of All India I am happy to cross the sub continent off that list."}
{"text":"This is a delicious Indian buffet. The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is that their dishes just taste different than any other place I've had them. These are not bad flavors just different. It has the typical over the top décor. Definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"had buffet here. there was a nice selection of veg and non veg variety.
there was indeed a good spread but it lacked in taste. I am not a fan of this place but will give it another try as it is very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Always great food and experience :) the variety they have is mind blowing, I don't feel time passing when I'm in this restaurant, it is so welcoming. They keep everything clean and well organized."}
{"text":"Best Indian in Oakland and cool ambiance! Definitely go for the buffet. Lots of options."}
{"text":"Amazing food, the best indian food in PiTs !! The servers are attentive and the buffet has lots of great options. The south indian options on the menu are also great !! 

Recommend their saag and missi roti, chai and dessert !! Will return back sooner than later !!"}
{"text":"Reasonably priced, great food, very kind & helpful servers in a nice and tidy place. Plus the buffet is awesome - lots of options and all very tasty! Definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"This is good place one of my friend recommend this place this is my first time I eating lunch buffet its  amazing I love the food quality and service and largest buffet ever seen in highly recommended this place"}
{"text":"My husband and I visit this restaurant all the time because we live so close by. We've been to many other Indian restaurants in Pittsburgh and this is among one of our favorites! I love that they label their buffet with gluten-free and vegan items. We recently used this restaurant to cater my son's first birthday party and everyone talked about how delicious the food was - they were professional kind and the food was phenomenal. I highly recommend this restaurant and will use them to cater any future parties that we have!"}
{"text":"I went here today for the first time with my colleagues. I love Indian food so I was looking forward to trying it. 

I like that it's a buffet, and it's set up well. I am a vegetarian so I appreciated that everything was labeled and indicated if it was vegetarian. I sampled a little bit of almost everything and I was all delicious. The fried donut like things in particular were incredible!

I think that $10 is a tad steep at least for me for lunch, but the quality was good. I'll probably continue when looking for a different option in Oakland."}
{"text":"Good Food!! Good atmosphere!!! Terrible Service

I know.. I know.. I always say service usually depends on the server but nevertheless I do have to mention it here. Our server seemed pretty friendly at first until we were seated and then it all went down. I'm not sure if he was trying to friendly but it just came out to be simply rude.

We started off with some appetizers and being here for the first time - we asked for few more minutes to decide on the entree. Our server's response \"Hurry Up! Okay\" - not that we were taking that much time and I would probably understand if the place was packed which it wasn't.

The food here is good. The buffet supposedly a lot better but haven't had the chance to try yet. Given the service, I think the buffet is the way to go at this place."}
{"text":"Best Indian in the burgh, probably best buffet in the burgh. The food is good quality and you feel healthy full when your satisfied you won't regret it like other food places.  They have meat/vegi/vegan options so they have something for everyone. the buffet options are a little limited but its a case of quality over quantity which is what I personally look for. 

They have alot of space inside so their is lots of seating room and they have TV entertainment and its very distracting which is good/bad depending on the situation. They have free parking but its small and street parking is busy/pricey in that area.     

Pros: The food is good and satisfying they have lots of space   

Cons: Need more parking space but that's alot to ask for in Oakland most places only offer street parking so its still a kinda plus."}
{"text":"Went there on a Sunday night (14th Feb) for a regular dinner service. I had heard a few good things about the food here and a few not so good things about the service but still decided to give it a try. A couple of my friends joined my wife and I for this visit. The visit started going down hill the moment we entered the restaurant. We were greeted by one of the waitresses who asked us to sit right beside a huge glass window on a very cold night. We respectfully asked if we could sit somewhere else since most of the r restaurant was empty (there may have been 3 other tables that were taken and at least 20 or so empty ones. We were very rudely reminded of the fact that this was a 'fine dining' restaurant and we didn't have a choice of where we could sit. We decided to comply with this 'rule' like unwilling teens in a classroom but to our amusement the table we were seated on hadn't even been cleaned properly. So much for it being a 'fine dining' restaurant. When we asked the same waitress to kindly clean the tables we got the look that sent a thousand daggers flying our way. She however cleaned up the table and we went to get the food from the buffet spread as that was the only option for the night ($15.99 +tax per person).  
I was pleasantly surprised by the food which turned out to be good. There was a stark disparity in the food and the service which was meted out to us. There was decent variety and I would like to mention the goat curry and the Indo Chinese noodles (Chow Mein) which were cooked perfectly. Our water was never filled up and the first time we asked for it the same waitress showed up after 10 minutes. Our plates were not cleared away as well even after waiting a few minutes and trying to flag her down. We would have understood had the restaurant been full and if she was the only one working. Also in case you are expecting the customer to tip you at a buffet, I think keeping the water full and the plates cleared would go a long way. There were 2-3 tables that were occupied at this point of time not including ours. The second time we tried to flag her down for some more water she walked down to the table and almost shouted at us that she wasn't waiting on our table anymore and we should ask another waitress for water. All this while she was hanging out at the billing counter. When we asked her if she could inform the other waitress that we need water she said she must have already heard us and might bring out the water. At that point we did get the feeling that if we hung around to drink that water although we were very thirsty we might actually be victims of one of the stories we had heard about waitresses spitting into the water etc. We decided to just leave and paid for our food upfront. We tried talking to the gentleman at the counter who looked like the manager but we didn't really get the feeling that he was too interested in listening to what we had to say. Maybe the restaurant is doing well and the owners are happy with their turnover. In my opinion when the customer is asked to spend above $17 on a buffet the least you could do is treat them with respect. I don't think I will be taking my business there again. Actually I would be almost afraid to go their again and ordering off the menu if the same waitress brings out my food."}
{"text":"We got some rocking takeout this evening. They asked our preferred spice level (scale of 1-10) for each dish, and followed those requests. We loved the Chicken Kadai, rich but not too rich, and the vegetable Biryani rice. The Naan bread -- both onion and garlic -- were good (not great). Overall, great value for the money, and a tasty meal. The buffet looks enticing, we will have to try it sometime, too."}
{"text":"After a recommendation from my husband's friend, we decided to check out All India on a Saturday night when we were meandering around North Oakland.  We have to say, based on this visit alone, we were not disappointed at all.

The service was super attentive and kind, and the menu had a great selection.  There were 4 of us, and each of us ordered something different... we were all very satisfied.  The portion sizes were good and they were priced more than adequately.  

We will definitely be back... the service, the food and the ambiance made this a good experience overall!"}
{"text":"Love the buffet here because of all the clearly labeled vegetarian and vegan options!  The spread during our visit included a salad bar with various hot sauces and chutneys, perhaps half a dozen vegetable/legume/paneer dishes, at least 3 chicken options including Tandoori, Tikka Masala, and Chili Chicken, a Goat Curry, and a breaded and fried fish dish.  Also available were 2 vegetarian soups, multiple bread and rice options, and 2 desserts: Gulab Jamun and Jalebis.  

My favorite dishes were the creamy (vegan!) Navaratna Korma with cauliflower, peas, lima beans, green beans, and potato chunks in a nutty green sauce, as well as the sweet and slightly spicy and sweet Chili Chicken.  A lot of reviews complain about a lack of spice in the spread, but the hot sauces can be used to add heat to any dish.  As an infamous chili head to my friends, I was not disappointed.  

The dining room was pretty empty for lunch on Saturday around noon, and the service was efficient at refilling our water and clearing our plates.  Despite the slightly sketchy outward facade, the venue cute inside with the typical Indian restaurant-style kitschiness.  We will definitely be back for future gorge sessions."}
{"text":"Went with a friend today for lunch and was seated right away. We both did the buffet which was expansive and had a lot of dishes to offer, all labeled/with descriptions which was very helpful. They had an expansive number of vegetarian dishes which was great. Dessert and chai tea was also included in the buffet price. The service was great. I would definitely recommend this restaurant and can't wait to go back! 
Extra fun touch-they had Bollywood movies playing on several screens which was fun to watch/listen to the music."}
{"text":"Have not been for dinner yet, but the lunch buffet is awesome! Large variety of dishes, many vegetarian options - and vegan labels! The buffet items are typically not spicy, which is understandable, but they have fresh chili peppers with the condiments so you can add your own heat. Brilliant. On my first visit, they had a turnip dish on the buffet which was by far the best root veg dish I have ever had - the turnips had totally absorbed the aromatic spices (think anise, cinnamon, cardamom) and melted in our mouths. Amazing."}
{"text":"The key attraction at this place is a large buffet, but apart from a few items that seem to be replenished regularly, nothing is really good.  One can't tell how long the food has been sitting.  I found several of the dishes to be greasy, but at least there was a lot it.The north indian dishes seemed a bit better than the south indian ones.

Overall, this place is about quantity, not quality. This is not the place for good indian food, just a lot of mediocre stuff. It is pan-indian for sure.. dishes you would almost never find side by side but I can't recommend this place for anyone but hungry college students with large appetites than budgets."}
{"text":"They have a very large assortment of dishes for their lunch buffet.I think it's by far the most extensive I've seen- larger than Tamarind and Yuva which are not far distance wise. If it's variety you are after, you are super hungry, and it's lunch time, I would definitely recommend. I love Indian food and all you can eat buffets really test my will power. Their dinner entrees I found to not be as good as the buffet. Weird- maybe they were having an off night. Anyway, I highly recommend the buffet. The service is excellent as well."}
{"text":"Had lunch buffet around $10plus change. 
Had breakfast at 10 was looking to eat a al carte items but ended up with an elaborated buffet spread . 
Lots of options 
Must try chicken kabab and paneer and chola 
Also should try the different chutneys
Must try fruit custard 


Server attentive and overall great service"}
{"text":"This is not authentic indian food by any means. The dinner buffet was horrible. Bland, greasy, stale. I doubt I'll ever go back."}
{"text":"It's unusual to have an evening buffet that is delicious. And it's also unusual to have a buffet with so much vegan and gluten-free assortment. We loved it. the spices were delicious and the service was terrific.  And all of that seemed quite reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Best Indian in Pittsburgh and I have tried a few. The bread is out of this world! Fresh crisp but soft inside. I usually get the garlic naan and it's amazing I've also been to the buffet and had two different kinds of breads served to me included during my meal. A truly outstanding place. I'm leaving Pittsburgh soon and this will be one of the places I miss the most! The honey cheese balls for dessert are........go find out."}
{"text":"Not bad tasting but not exceptional Indian food. I got the vegetable biryani, cheese naan, and a side of mint chutney. 

The veggie biryani was like rice pilaf with curry tossed in. The only veggies were mixed frozen veggies. Literally it's the bag you find in the freezer aisle with peas, corn, carrots, and lima beans. Weird and not great. It also did not have any raisins or nuts like it states. 

The raita that comees with it was good. Typical raita. The mint chutney was... eh. A little bland for me but not awful. 

The cheese naan was good and bad. There were some charred parts that were really yummy. The less cooked bits were only ok. I've actually never had cheese naan before, only plain and garlic. The texture was way different than I was used to. Thicker. But that might be because it's cheese, not sure. 

It also took about 25 min longer to get delivered to me than initially quoted. So all in all, pretty average experience. Definitely would NOT get the veggie biryani again."}
{"text":"I've eaten at All India many times as well as ordered take out and I'm always very happy with everything. Tonight we ordered Butter Chicken, Tandoori Mixed Grill, the Bread Basket (assorted naan) and a lentil soup. Everything was fantastic - the Butter Chicken is a new favorite! I love it that they stay open late as well, it's awesome to know they're open after we get done running around after work."}
{"text":"Had a really bad experience yesterday night  from the buffet at All india restaurant as the food wasn't as expected from the reviews, most of the chicken dishes had a stale smell and taste to them, to my surprise even one of the veg items ( mini uttapam) had a stale smell to it.The only thing that tasted good was goat curry and daal. 
For a $13.99 buffet I would at least expect fresh food !!
Never going back again"}
{"text":"$10 All you can eat Lip Smacking Indian Buffet, What else do you need!!"}
{"text":"I Love this buffet. I used to go to a different Indian Restaurant for their buffet, but they only had it on certain days and this one is EVERYDAY! the food is very good and fresh. Its always hot and fresh when i go. There are a lot of different vegan options and the selections give you a nice variety of things to choose from. I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Husband and I went to this restaurant for the night buffet and saw 2 rats....yes! I said RATS!!!! just running around in the restaurant. Definitely never going back."}
{"text":"The Sunday Buffet selection is usually good however a few times the entrees didn't seem to be as fresh as other times I've gone. I do enjoy very spicy food and obviously not everyone likes it that way but it just doesn't seem to be consistent. Some days certain dishes like butter chicken are  spicier than others such as chili chicken yet even when I order off the menu and specify a level 10 it's still not up to par with the spice level I'm hoping for. Maybe next time I'll ask for a level 15 and see what happens."}
{"text":"I have had buffet more than 4 times here and by now, I'm a big fan of this place. It is the best Indian food I have had in Pittsburgh. Both the lunch and dinner buffet has a long counter of ample vegetarian and non-vegetarian options. You get samosas, pakoras, customizable chaat, dosa/vegetable idli and mouth watering pao-bhajji (takes you back to Bombay street side pao-bhajji joints seriously!) for appetizer. Besides you can have salad, main course (biriyani pulao, paneer, daal makhani,gobi, egg-plant, sambar, chicken curry, chicken tandoori, mutton curry, fish, shrimp...you name it, you get it). They have Indian sweets for desserts too! You'll definitely want to eat more than your appetite can take. Besides buffet, I had also tried andhra spicy dosa from the menu, which was great too! the way they serve the food is pretty neat and impressive too. I'll also recommend the Mango lassi, which is a must-try if you have some space left after a sumptuous meal.  Everytime I dine here, I've never been dissapointed. If you are looking for some authentic Indian food and some peaceful atmosphere to dine, it has to be All India on S. craig street. It's truely a awesome treat. some of my non-Indian friends have become a great fan too. It has become our weekly dining place for us."}
{"text":"Their buffet is really worth a try! Lunch/dinner buffet. I love the soft rice and chicken curry"}
{"text":"I found a band-aid in my food tonight, and the manager just shrugged it off, saying there's only so much they can do to control contamination of their buffet food. 

Worst part? The manager didn't even make the effort to see what was going on besides quickly taking away the plate with the chewed-out band-aid. He just kept sending over the poor waitress who would relay nonsensical excuses like 'oh it must have been paper' or 'it could have slipped off another customer so we can't do anything about that.' 

When I went up to confront the manager, he kept repeating how he doesn't know what I want him to do about it. 

Take my words or leave it, that's up to you--but the owner of this restaurant clearly doesn't take potential health hazards seriously. 

Does this place have good food? Yes. Is it worth the possibility of ingesting a band-aid that came off of someone? I don't think so."}
{"text":"All India was quite the experience! My chalice glass was constantly full of water and the atmosphere was amazing! With Indian dance videos playing in the background and beautiful decorations everywhere you looked, it made the experience very fitting....

The food was very good! Quite the selection and I loved the fact that they included what the traditional name of the items were AND the Americanized version for those that aren't familiar. The goat curry was very delicious but contained bones in 3/4 of my bites so that was a little discouraging. There wasn't a place in their buffet just for silverware and napkins and I was very lost on that aspect and had to ask, but I was quickly directed and helped. 

Everything tasted great! Will gladly return!"}
{"text":"I'll count this as an incomplete review, because I have not had the option to try the lunch buffet yet...which nobody would shut up about :)

Anyways, here's a quick review on the regular menu:

GET THE THALI GET THE THALI GET THE THALI.

It's on the last page. You get some form of an appetizer, 3 different dishes, rice, raita, and DESSERT. One of them even comes with Ayran.

This is one of the best deals I've seen for the amount of food you get, and I was really happy with the quality. The paneer was above average. However, the lentil dish was a bit too heavy and boring for my tastes. It wasn't bad though. Oh, and the samosa was on point as well. Really I have no room to complain because my vegetarian thali came with rice pudding and rice pudding is basically the best thing on the face of the earth (aside from sushi..STEP OFF)

I will definitely stop back here and check out the lunch buffet.

:D"}
{"text":"This is the largest Indian buffet I've seen in pittsburgh. A friend of mine recommended All India and the Taj Mahal as the best indian places in pittsburgh. I think she's right. I'm not sure which one is better though. Will probably have to go a few more times to decide. What I can say for sure is that this place has more options. There were lots of vegetarian options and meat options as well. I came in for the lunch buffet on a Saturday and for $11.99 it's not a bad deal. My favorites on the buffet was the curry goat and the paneer spinach. Will go back for sure soon!"}
{"text":"This is my husband's favorite Indian place in Oakland, and he frequents the lunch buffet.  I can't make it over there during the day so we went one Sunday night for the dinner buffet--awesome!  Many, many veggie indian dishes along with a few for the carnivores, masala chai, and plenty of dessert and naan options.

I also love the atmosphere--they have Bollywood videos and music playing, and lots of colorful lanterns and string lights.  The service is a little slow for those of us who like it spicy--at one point I felt like I was going to die because my water glass had been empty for so long and I have an unfortunate affinity for chili peppers.

Other than that, this place is perfect and it might have just been because they were SO busy.  Because it's awesome! :)"}
{"text":"I love this place.Very nice food and excellent service.Lot of vegetarian food options."}
{"text":"I enjoyed this place a lot. I was a little disappointed by the lack of chicken options they offered in the buffet. They also have a full menu you can order from if you don't want the buffet option. I was really looking forward to chicken korma, but they didn't have it on the buffet. But even without that I still enjoyed the options they had. The spinach was very very tasty! It almost tasted as if it was a cream of spinach, but the cream wasn't visible. Which was good because the spinach wasn't too running, but extra tasty. The naan they had was bomb dot com!!!  Probably the best naan I've ever eaten!! I really enjoyed the music videos they had playing as well, they really set the tone, which went great along with the decor. I would recommend this place if you enjoy Indian food!"}
{"text":"Just back from a visit today. Had a good experience once in the past, but today was plain horrible. My friend and I visited around 9:30pm. The waiter seemed pissed off that we arrived, delaying her end of work time (the place closes at 10:30pm). 

She brought the cheque before we finished eating at 10:10pm, without request. And took away the spoons before we took desserts. As a waiter, the least you could do is afford a smile and not a scowl. Moreover, the food was cold, chewy and inedible. Horrible experience. Not going there again, and wouldn't recommend it to any friends now on.

Objective of the restaurant is not to serve customers, clearly."}
{"text":"Best Indian restaurant I've been to. The food was incredible, and the menu was clear so it's not intimidating if it's your first foray into Indian cuisine. The naan was baked fresh to order and was delicious. Diverse crowd, and we were pleasantly surprised to learn we came in on a night where chicken and veggie dishes were half off (Tuesday). The menu is also 90% gluten free! Definitely recommend and we're already planning to bring our friends and family here."}
{"text":"This is my all-time favorite Indian buffet. While I was changing it up for a bit at some other places, All India simply has the best food. The tikka masala, mattar paneer, mustard greens, and broccoli manchurian are my favorite dishes, but I've never had anything that wasn't excellent from the buffet. The variety is huge, with lots of choices for both meat eaters and vegetarians. The bread is always excellent, which is not so at many other buffets, as are the desserts. The service is very friendly, and the interior of the restaurant is comfortable and nicely decorated. Also, they offer lunch and dinner buffets every day, so no need to try to remember what days are buffet days. I highly recommend All India!"}
{"text":"One of the few restaurants open after 11pm on a Sunday. I loved the Chicken Tikka Marsala and Garlic Naan! Serving size was good enough to feed 2."}
{"text":"This buffet has decent food but they wax on prices for what they have. And their student discount is a complete joke. They scam you saying it's a dollar it's really like 20 cents, me and my friend did the math on it one day and that was the last time we went. They have a decent variety but I wouldn't put it in the top number of Indian restaurants, not even close. To name a few places that are much better is coriander's weekend buffet, and yak mahal on McKnight road. Their everyday lunch buffet is amazing. Way more variety and flavor in the food. Save your money and go to that place instead, which by the way offers more variety for a cheaper price. And their water is served in actual glasses and not ghandi era brass cups that make the water taste like batteries."}
{"text":"The buffet here is fantastic with lots of vegetarian choices - more than other Indian buffets in the area. Everything is great - the nann is always fresh and all of the paneer dishes are perfect. with so many offerings it is a deal that cannot be beat. I eat Indian food often and discovered new favorites because of the wide selection (which is also good for a Indian food newcomer). Having been here many times I can say that The food is consistant, the staff friendly, and the restaurant clean and inviting."}
{"text":"One day I walked outside my apartment building and what's that I smell in the air, sniff sniff?  Onions?  Garlic?  Curry???!  I was so lucky that the best Indian buffet had just moved in across the street.  The selection totally trumps that of Tamarind which is also in the neighborhood.  While it might not be that much to look at from the outside, the ambience inside is rich, colorful, and clean.  

This is definitely THE place for Indian buffet in Pittsburgh.  With all the different Indian buffets I've had in the past, I still see some unique dishes here.  I love that they have puri (puffy dough) as well as naan.  After lunch, you can grab some Indian cooking stuff at Bombay down the street."}
{"text":"Definitely coming back here for some Sunday night buffet pig outs. 

Usually I'm an easy pleaser when it comes to Indian food but this really blew my minimal expectations.   It had the best of all the other Indian restaurants that I frequent and the Indian households which I impose myself on.  It's authentic, and a had a bit for everyone. Meat lovers, vegetable grazers, vegans... As a spice lover, this had it all, a perfect combination of burning my esophagus as it makes it's way to indigestion later and taste. 

I'd want to describe the different dishes here but that would be pointless. It would be better to  go to the restaurant and take a look for yourself and confirm the crowd's opinion."}
{"text":"Our first time to this place for dinner. Wow. Great service. Cool atmosphere. Food on buffet was fresh and authentic Northern and Southern Indian food. Two in our party had a gluten and dairy allergy. The waiters went back to ask the chefs what we could have. They patiently explained what we can eat and it was a lot. The masala tea at the end was a great conclusion. Try this place it is a greatIndian restaurant."}
{"text":"I've only ever been here for the lunch buffet, and it's pretty good. Definitely by far the largest selection of any Indian buffet I have been to. It's not quite as good as it was when it first opened a few years ago...they used to have palak paneer at the buffet, and now it's only paneer-less creamed spinach, for example. Still tasty though, and I always leave quite content after eating here.

The flavors here aren't as strong as some other buffets I've been to. I wish it were spicier, but most dishes are still pretty flavorful, so it's ok. There are always many different chicken options - tikka masala, tandoori, regular curry, chili - and sometimes goat and fish. Lots of veggie options too - lentils, roasted potatoes and cauliflower, chickpeas, pakoras, etc. There are multiple carb options - both plain and garlic naan, a chickpea kind of flat bread, two kinds of rice. The usual kind of fare you find at Indian restaurants around here. There is a decent salad bar and dessert selection as well.

It's decently priced ($10 for the lunch buffet), and the waitress/waiter is usually very on top of water refills.  Lots of space and seating options, and a couple of TVs usually featuring Bollywood of Indian pop videos, make for a generally enjoyable eating environment."}
{"text":"SETTING
Located next to a sketchy beer distributor and looks like a haunted house on the outside...with a \"DAILY BUFFET\" banner. Looks suspect. Is this a trap? I consider myself a risk taker.

Enter inside and I feel like I've been transported into a dimly lit mini mansion that has goblets (yes, really!) to hold your water. Can't forget the nice TVs with bollywood music on the screen showcasing beautiful people doing outrageous dance moves. Banquet room in the back for private parties. Pretty unique venue. 

FOOD
This is a review of the buffet. What a spread! Chickpea curry, saag, goat curry (yeah, baby!), chicken curries, sweet and sour chicken/broccoli/mushrooms, tandoori chicken, and the list goes on. Along with raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens, these are some of my favorite things. And the garlic naan! Mmm, All India got my stomach singing the \"sound of music\". Food is always piping hot and refilled at the buffet when low. 

SERVICE
Typical buffet service. Sometimes water takes a while to come around. Pay at the counter by the buffet after you finish.

IMPRESSIONS
I come here at least twice a month for a reason! $1 off the lunch buffet if you have a student ID, which comes out to $9. What a steal! I've been to some indian buffets and this has to the biggest spread and the best price. Also, drinking out of a goblet makes me feel like Lil Jon. Will I be back soon? WHAT! Will I be back soon? YEAHHHHH!!!"}
{"text":"This is the best Indian buffet in Pittsburgh. The assortment of choices is unbelievable and it's impossible to try everything. My only small comment is that everything is richer than it has to be. I've had similar examples elsewhere that aren't as heavy. I also appreciate how balanced the heat level is on all of their dishes. There's a definite range. Tamarind, for example, is just hot.  Every dish is too hot. Not here. Another remarkable thing about their food is their use of fresh vegetables in many of their dishes. You rarely see such an abundant variety of freshly prepared vegetables.  Back off the fats a little and I would be here all the time.  There's too many cream and cheese based dishes with fried veg balls floating in them."}
{"text":"Amazing buffet. 
Large enough to cater to the needs of vegan, vegetarian and non-vegs. 

The specials are the best! :)"}
{"text":"Lunch buffet for 10$ is worth it since they are many options and the food is good. Student gets $1 off for buffet."}
{"text":"The best Indian place for vegans in Pittsburgh. Amazing selection!!! Only go every once in a while because it is a tad expensive but when we do, it's a treat and a perfect date night."}
{"text":"I've been going there for years the food is not too bad but one cockroach could be a coincidence I've seen a roach there before on the seat next to me I informed formed the waitress and it was no problem. she took care of it and apologized. this time the waiter came over with a huge cock roach in the picture of water after I pointed out to him that there was a roach in the picture he had no apology he just looked at it as if it was normal he walked over to the water station poured half the picture into the sink and put more water in the same picture and returned to give us two glasses of water from that same picture as if it was the most normal thing he could do"}
{"text":"The lunch buffet here is awesome! So much of variety and so much authenticity! Lot of vegetarian options. And buffet price is $10 which is very reasonable. I would come here again and again without second thought."}
{"text":"Prior to my last visit, I would have given this 4 stars. The dinner buffet is delicious, with a great variety for both vegetarians and meat eaters. It's BYOB and usually a great place to hang out with friends. The Naan and saag paneer were amoung my favorite dishes.

NOW, for why I unfortunately have to leave 1 star and will not be returning: one member of my party found an already smoked CIGARETTE BUTT in their food. You heard that right folks. 

We brought this to the attention of the staff, who brought over a manager. The manager did not apologize, but rather outlined all the ways he didn't think this was his staffs fault and it must have been a customer that threw it in there in the buffet line. I obviously have no proof of how it got in there, but it seems way more likely that this happened in the kitchen (accidental or not). Either way, there is no way for the manager to have truly known for sure that this wasn't his staff. We NEVER got an apology of any kind and we got zero assurance that they were doing anything about this. This truly ruined the night for our group and we all immediately lost our appetite. Despite the fact that we all had already eaten this dish that had been simmering with a cigarette butt, only that 1 member of our party got their meal comped, which we had to ask for."}
{"text":"This place has the best buffet spread in Pittsburgh. Lots of options for vegetarians like me and the deserts were also awesome. Icing on the cake, CMU Students get 15% discount too!"}
{"text":"I love All India. The food is really good. People are super nice. The buffet is more than enough and not expensive. The food are not superspicy, but enough spicy for me at least. I asked somewhere to pray, the waitress was so kind and he showed me a place. Also, everything was halal.Like"}
{"text":"BYOB.  Lunch Buffet is scrumptious and priced right.

They have an extensive menu with a huge amount of gluten free and vegan options but their lunch buffet was irresistible. 

There's a large amount of choices on the buffet and I think I tasted every one of them.  Fresh fruit and salad, chai tea, paneer, lentil soups, currys of chicken and goat and lots vegetables, stews, naan bread, chutneys, dumplings, and desserts.  The spices were spot on and everything was so flavorful.  I was impressed at how many items were offered.  They also clearly note gluten free and vegan dishes. 

The dining room was very clean and spacious.  The wait staff was friendly and attentive.  

Enjoyable.

They have 3 parking spots and you would be lucky to get one.  This whole area has on street parking, up a side street would be your best bet of finding a spot.  The food is worth the parking hassle."}
{"text":"Tired Indian food and decor. Inexpensive, so that was a plus but I wouldn't go again. The buffet was what you'd find at any Indian buffet, tasty but greasy. What put me off was how the naans were fried (never seen that before), and the general run down everything. Go if you're looking for a cheap greasy tasty meal."}
{"text":"My last trip was for dinner at the buffet. The buffet was beyond what you would ever expect for dinner at an Indian restaurant. They had an extensive selection of vegetarian entrees and a decent selection of meat entrees. If you are looking for a specific meat entree, this probably isn't for you as they only had 3-4 meat entrees. But everything tasted pretty good for a buffet. They had a wonderful array of chutneys that you usually don't find. The naan could have been fresher (they had it sitting at the buffet and it was quite dry). 

The time before, my family and I ordered take-out and it was amazing and just what we'd been missing since India Garden."}
{"text":"I came here for the Sunday night buffet and was very satisfied with the selection and quality for the price. There were a handful of dishes for vegetarians, omnivores, and carnivores. It would be awfully exhaustive to mention everything I tried, so I'm going to say that I was pleased with the food across the board and mention a few of my favorites.

I liked the vegetable pancakes. I spread the coconut chutney, the mango chutney, the mint sauce, and the harissa on pancakes. All of 'condiments' were good too. My favorite entree was the paneer with peas (I think it was called mattar paneer but I am not completely sure). Before leaving, make sure to pick up some masala chai. It has a well balanced taste.

The service was very attentive and accommodating. Our plates were quickly collected and our glasses were rarely empty.

All in all, I was very satisfied with my dinner here."}
{"text":"I have been dining here since the doors opened and before that, for many years at Didar's legendary India Garden.  He is the undisputed king of Indian cuisine in this region, the very best is offered at the spectacular buffet.  I now live a significant distance from the restaurant in Washington County, but my wife and I visit as often as possible because we both love it!"}
{"text":"I have had food here about 3 times and every time it has been disappointing.
Their naans are tasty and they do choley bhature well. The buffet has 2 -3 things done right but most of the dishes come nowhere close to the real Indian food I had growing up in India."}
{"text":"North Oakland's All India is excellent! I've been here several times so far - with many more to come - and it never fails to please me. I've never had the pleasure of traveling to India - but my travels, as both a tourist and resident, have found me to be a huge fan of the cuisine of the sub-continent. With incredible dining experiences in DC, New York, Reykjavik and London, I was wary of finding a spot to sate my appetites since my recent return to my very own hometown.

I am absolutely pleased and completely contented. All India's fare well represents the regional differences of both northern and southern styles. I'd be confident to recommend this fine establishment to all - from cosmopolitan to local, from Yank to Yinzer to Indian national, as well... I know all wound have a fabulous affair.

Indeed, I am not in the habit of writing reviews - but on the occasion of a celebration of our friend's book publication (The End Of You And Me, by Wendi M. Lee - find it on Amazon!), the staff was so outstanding and everything was so awesome I decided I'd have to tell the world and get the Yelp on.

Additionally, this is a must-do destination for the vegan/vegetarians in your life. I am a proud one myself (as of recent years). Vegan, vegetarian and gluten-free items are plentiful on the menu - and clearly noted on their buffet (Sundays and Thursdays, I believe). And, it's ridiculously cost-effective. Writing about it makes me want to go back right now! 



And now, a haiku review of All India:

Alert Pakistan.
All India is da bomb!
Bollywood flavah!

This has been your haiku review.

Thanks, All India!"}
{"text":"You will not find a better place for lunch around Oakland/Shadyside/Bloomfield. The food in INCREDIBLE. So many HEALTHY vegetarian and vegan choices. I come here at least once a week for lunch. I'm usually not a fan of buffets, but Their lunch buffet is amazing. It's $10, super clean, always stocked, and you can enjoy a really fantastic lunch and be back to work within 30 mins. I can't say enough good things about this place. Definitely one of my favorite places to eat."}
{"text":"Best Indian food I've had in Pittsburgh. I'm so  glad I found this place a little hidden on N.Craig St in Northern Oakland. I was originally going to an Indian spot a block away because there were more reviews for this place but after tasting their tamarind sauce I was very very disappointed. So I ended up walking down the street to this little spot hidden off behind a bar or beer distributor.

From the outside it looks almost too small to be anything more than a fast food spot but one inside it opens up beautifully  and extends past the main dining room to a private area for larger dinner parties. They have a decent bar with seating for about 6 as well as an awesome array of fresh made beverages like tea and lassi. They serve water in these goblets which I'm not too fond of since its metal and I don't like the feel of the metal on my lips so I just ask for a normal glass.

They serve their version of chips and dips which is basically these thin crisp with three different sauce. Tamarind, a pickled chile's mixture and some green dip. My favorite is definitely the tamarind because its so sweet and thick but the mixed chile's come in a close second. I believe you only get the chips if you order off the regular menu which we did on our first visit but It was a Thursday and they offered the buffet on this day and Sunday only.

So after deciding on drinks we made our way up to the buffet. Man were there so many amazing options. Every label listed whether the item was gluten free or vegan which was a good comfort. They had tea at the beginning of the buffet followed by a chickpea dish surrounded with fresh bread and elegantly decorated. The salad bar was great too with different sauces to put on your salad other than ranch and italian. They also had an amazing fruit salad which was pineapples mixed in a mango based pudding like sauce, Delicious!! After the salad where various types of  curried sauces at least 5 to 6 along with jasmine rice and basmati rice. They had these mushrooms that literally tasted like general tso's sauce and they were sweet and crunchy that I almost forgot I was eating mushrooms. At the end of the hot foods was your meat choices like chicken tandoori and curried fish, chicken and goat. 

On top of all the food they had dessert was a great ending to this wonderful array of choices. They offered whose pancakes balls soaked in a thin syrup like base and something known as fried sugar shaped similar to pretzels. I wasn't too fond of the fried sugar because it tasted too much like the oil that it was fried in and that wasn't a pleasant taste in my opinion. After finishing our meal we let our food settle and enjoyed some interesting tea that had a distinct taste of cinnamon and some other spice. I drank it without sugar which was a great choice because it ruins the flavor.

It was my hubbys first time here but it won't certainly be his last. The best part is that the buffet was only $10 a person!!! Such a great deal for all the food we had to try. It was totally worth it in my opinion!! See you guys soon."}
{"text":"All India serves really good food and in a more than sufficient quantity. I placed an order through Uber Eats for Dal Tadka, Lamb Korma and Garlic Naan. However the dal tadka was replaced by Dal Makhni. I raised an issue with Uber Eats and All India promptly responded by refunding the amount. I was very impressed and would definitely go back again. Very happy with their service."}
{"text":"All India is to me the best Indian Restaurant in the City of Pittsburgh. Their buffet has the most options from any other Indian buffet I have been to here. I personally appreciate the massive vegetarian, vegan, and meat options. The food is always fresh, flavorful, and simply delicious. If your a beginner at Indian food I recommend eating here for your first time because there are enough options to allow you to sample multiple things."}
{"text":"This is one of the best Indian restaurants in Pittsburgh. The buffet is well prepared and plentiful. There is such a great variety that a person who doesn't know the kinds of dishes they like will certainly get the opportunity to explore many tastes and variations. Parking can be a bit tricky but at least there are no meters to pay. Wonderful wonderful and well priced. 

Just a small look at the huge variety available.
These sweet treats make a great finish to your meal."}
{"text":"A real taste of authentic India in Pittsburgh.  I found the dishes to be tasty and affordable.  If you are yearning for something different, All India is a great adventure!"}
{"text":"I had the lunch buffet here. They have pretty good number of variety of dishes. But needs to improve on the quality of the food. The chicken biryani was okay. The fish amristari was good. The desserts are gulab Jamun, mango juice and fruit custard are pretty good. Worth the visit once."}
{"text":"I've been to all of the Indian Restaurants in Pittsburgh. ALL INDIA is the BEST of them all. Hands down. Their buffet selection is the best there is in the entire city. Loooove the goat curry especially. I'm an Indian foodie and this restaurant is one of the best things about Pittsburgh. I don't even bother with Tamarind across the street, People's India, or any other place nearby. (Tamarind doesn't even have free chai for buffet.) Sometimes they bring you FRESH hot naan to the table (especially during busy hours). My Indian friends that go with me rave about the food here too, so, go figure!

I literally go to eat there every week so I think it speaks for itself. One thing I noticed is they've been cutting back on selections a little (they used to have mango lassi with buffet, etc) but I think it's because they are keeping the value very high without price gauging."}
{"text":"Pretty good $10 lunch buffet. This place was more crowded than I thought; a lot of people here for lunch on a Saturday. They have a bunch of different buffet options and a good number of different curry options. Definitely try their turmeric rice! They're pretty on top of making sure your glass of water is full, but be sure to get the masala chai! Mmm.

{"text":"One of the best Indian buffet that I have come across in a long long time. I was in Pittsburg and had a fantastic dinner buffet at this place. All I can say is that wish I could have brought the flavors with me to the west coast. I want to deduct half a star for desserts but will give it a pass as everything else was exceptional."}
{"text":"I used to have an Indian restaurant I frequented weekly, sadly it closed down.  It took some time - but a friend finally discovered All India that was pretty equivilant to my old restaurant.

At many Indian restaurants - there is a TON of oil in the food.  It \"floats to the top\" and just sits there.  At All india - there is no oil making a mess in your food.  All India is the best Indian buffet I've had in Pittsburgh.  In all honesty - I have NO doubt that their regular/non-buffet food is fantastic.  

I don't frequent All India enough - but when I do the service is impeccable, the food is phenomenal and it's just all around perfection.  They have a HUGE variety for vegetarians/vegan and meat eaters alike.  They have all the food clearly labeled and an abundance of naan.  

Whether you go for lunch or dinner - All India will never disappoint - You will always leave fulfilled with some scrumptious food and tea!"}
{"text":"Tried the buffet at All India - probably the largest Indian buffet I've seen (and they have it for lunch and dinner, 7 days a week)! An unbelievable amount of vegetarian options (which is always a plus for me) with all the classics you'll be hoping for and plenty of options you may not have tried before. I enjoyed the experience at All India from start to finish. Though their buffet seems to be very popular, there were plenty of take out orders going on. They have a very small lot in front, but for Oakland, street parking is relatively easy to find. Worth a trip!"}
{"text":"Went here as a date it was amazing. Food was great.  I never had indian food before.  There is this drink here it's kinda like a sweet milk and now I am always craving it. 100% would recommend."}
{"text":"One of the better Indian places around Pittsburgh.

The buffet as well as the menu food is great. Buffet has great number of choices. Make sure to check your plates before you add food on it, sometimes I have found them to be a bit dirty, but not all the time, just make sure and ask them to replace it and they will do it.

The spice level is great, not too spicy or bland. Their special biriyani is really good. Try to buffet and see if you like it before trying the menu food (they have student discounts too).

Definitely will go back and I tell people to go there since it is actually really good. If you shop at Bombay Mart, it's the same people that own this."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite Indian restaurant in Pittsburgh. The food is amazing and the service was very pleasant. Loved it!!"}
{"text":"All India is my go to when I'm craving Indian food, mostly because I live right around the corner, but also because their buffet never disappoints! They have a student discount as well, which I like. I would recommend coming here for lunch if you can, because you'll pay a few more bucks for dinner which is exactly the same buffet spread. They always have a huge variety of dishes from vegetarian to goat to chicken, but also always have the classic Indian buffet dishes. They also come around and give you fresh pieces of deep fried bread which are amazing! I think All India beats out Tamarind right down the street simply because it has way more variety in the buffet, and I think the quality is similar."}
{"text":"All India has a solid lunch buffet and I was happy to find that they also do dinner buffet. They have a very large selection of items and it's pretty good for vegetarians too. I prefer All India to Tamarind for  buffet because of the larger selection and bigger space - it's always easy to get a table. I have also gotten takeout quite a few times - chicken saag and chicken tikka masala are pretty good. The biryani was okay, but I've had better."}
{"text":"I loved this buffet!

All India is one of the most vegan friendly buffets I've ever been to. Everything is labeled \"Vegan,\" \"Vegetarian,\" or \"Gluten Free.\" It was super helpful! The staff is kind and courteous. Will definitely be back. 

I loved their garlic naan and chana masala. They were seasoned perfectly and super delicious. The buffet had a huge array of salads, chicken dishes, rice, samosas and breads."}
{"text":"I came here for a Saturday late lunch. The lunch buffet was priced at $10 (but with $1 discount for students). I thought there was good variety. The buffet consists of a salad bar with various chutneys and dressings. There are also your basic entrees like chicken tikka masala, goat curry, tandoori chicken with staples like garlic naan and basmati rice.

As you can expect from a buffet, the quality of the food is not as good as if it were freshly prepared for you. The chicken tikka masala was dried out and the naan was a bit soggy due to being trapped in a steamed catering tray. However, I still enjoyed my meal very much.

It's hard to beat All India, especially given its price."}
{"text":"My favorite place for incredible menu and buffet. Always served quickly and the price is amazing for the quality. I've been to others and this by far is the best ."}
{"text":"On a regular weekday I landed in Pittsburgh. The restaurant has decent reviews so we thought to eat here before starting our journey. My experience was generally all right as it provide good service, and variety in their buffet however, the taste was missing. A few dishes were okay so you won't leave empty stomach. Almost all gravy dishes were oddly sweet. They can work on the spice level without making dishes sweet otherwise the ambience and service are up for a good restaurant. I liked their desserts and are posted."}
{"text":"Four strikes in one go
1. The guy cleaning the table spilled chutneys on us
2. The food arrived about 45 minutes after ordering
3. Fodd was bad at best
4. The waiter wanted to charge us extra $1 per card for using credit cards to pay the bill

They were unapologetic about delays and sloppy service on top of which they wanted to charge us more while we thing charging for the food itself was wrong. Won;t go back to this place again."}
