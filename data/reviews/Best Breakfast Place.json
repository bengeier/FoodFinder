{"text":"Horrible restaurant!  Extremely dirty and don't know how they pass city code!  

We were served by older Asian woman who was extremely rude!  I asked what kind of cheese they used in their omelette, she told me it was cheddar but was served a processed cheese slice. She actually argued with me that processed cheese is cheddar cheese!  My friend asked if she had peanut butter and she passed over the bar to us a large (almost empty) jar of peanut butter that customers dig into with their dirty knives.  Gross and obviously we passed on it!  She put so much salt on my omelette, even after I attempted to scrape off the fake cheese, my tonge was immediately numb. 

I guess she took a dislike to me because she refused to give me a refill on my coffee (but offered one to my friend) and actually told me she doesn't want customers \"like me\"??  LOL. I guess she prefers to serve dirty homeless people over educated and professionally employed responsible citizens. We decided to leave - paid our bill (we should have just walked out as we didn't even finish our breakfast) and she and her regular customers at the back of the restaurant cheered us as we left and screamed \"Don't come back\"!  

An experience not to be forgotten!!  We laughed all the way up the street to another restaurant where we had cheerful service and real unprocessed food!"}
{"text":"This place is adorable! The lady who cooked our breakfast was friendly, responsive, and engaging. The food was typical, breakfast-y style toast, eggs and bacon but for the price I was shocked it could taste so flavourful. The paintings on the walls are lovely, contributing to a totally unique atmosphere. The place is certainly quirky (although very clean), but the food tasted great and the price was very reasonable.

If you're looking for a relaxed, diner-style breakfast with a great price tag in Toronto, this is your place."}
{"text":"Love this place! It is a great, family owned, no bells and whistles breakfast! Can't beat the price. I have been looking for just this kind of spot in Toronto for a long time and finally found it!!"}
{"text":"I've got over 70 reviews in my \"Breakfast Places\" list (see below), so I think I can say, with some authority, that Best Breakfast Place...isn't!

Not by a long shot.  But it is one of the least expensive.  The 4.50 breakfast special gets you 3 eggs, bacon, ham or sausage, home fries, toast and orange juice or one coffee. --Foreshadowing--

Lets start with the OJ.  I didn't, but wish I had.  It was translucent, orange-ish, and \"better than Tang\", according to one of my breakfast-mates.  The coffee was horrible.  It was the worst coffee on my \"Breakfast Places\" list.  I wouldn't have ordered a second cup and hadn't finished my first, but when another of my breakfast companions (the one without taste-buds) ordered a refill, I thought \"why not?  Maybe this one will be different\".  It wasn't.  To add insult to injury, they charged for this refill.

The toast was standard, the home fries were pretty good, and the eggs were poorly prepared.  The five meals came out slowly, two-at-a-time with the last one a good 5 minutes after the fourth.  (There were 5 of us.)  It was almost like they had never prepared breakfasts before.  Odd, based on the name of the restaurant.

If you're in the neighbourhood, go to Johnny G's, significantly better and only a block or so north.  http://www.yelp.ca/biz/johnny-gs-toronto

Or better yet, but another 5 minutes on, Chew Chew's Diner.  http://www.yelp.ca/biz/chew-chews-diner-toronto"}
{"text":"I just visited this place for the first time . It was utterly disgusting. I ordered some food with a girlfriend of mine and started eating their all day breakfast. 

  My potatoes were disgusting and tasted stale and old and were burnt on o me side from someone forgetting to watch/flip them. My bacon was old as well. Even the eggs were cold. The only thing warm was my rye toast. I also ordered deep fried mushrooms , a dish I haven't tried in ages.. so gross.. They were overly breaded and all I could taste was grease. They weren't cooked/made properly at all. It was terrible. I almost ate expired ranch dressing on them too. I told the waitress it was expired and she didn't throw out the dressing after. She asked if I wanted a new ranch sauce and I just asked for a take out container to eat them at home . 

 I started to look around the place and then realize how dirty everything in there was. I'm the stove there was sausages and eggs and bacon and homefries just sitting there. I then realized that's why my food was cold. It was all precooked earlier and then just sitting there with no wrap on it or anything. Just gross..."}
{"text":"Horrible food. Absolutely filthy place. Undrinkable coffee. Mediocre service. Dad suggested this place to meet for a quick breakfast as it is close to his home. Food was practically inedible. We both had the $4.99 special, Dad with over-medium & bacon, me with scrambled & sausage. My scrambled eggs were horrid- just eggs chopped-up with the spatula on the griddle. Sausages were gross. I could never return to this place & am truly surprised it gets a pass from the city inspectors- what a dirty, dirty place."}
{"text":"Best Breakfast Place definitely does not live up to its name. That being said, I've been twice, and I'll probably go again.

It is a filthy little hole on Parliament that serves up $4.99 all day breakfast. The breakfast is totally edible, aside from the terrible potato things. It's cheap and cheerful, and utterly filthy. Like, I didn't like touching the menus. They were that stained and sticky. They're laminated, BBP, give them a scrub. But honestly, why anyone would order anything aside from the breakfast is beyond me... so you don't even really need to look at the menu. 

On the right is the grill and a breakfast bar, and on the left are old lumpy booths that are well worn in. I like sinking into old booths, but others fine it uncomfortable. The random art on the wall, and old wood beams on the ceiling mish-mashed with fading red pleather stools and booths make me happy, but overall this place is pretty ridiculous. 

PEPPER POINTS: For the characters that walk in this joint. You're going to see some stuff when you eat here."}
