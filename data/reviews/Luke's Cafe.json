{"text":"Welcome to McFarland.   Luke has authentic diner foods in a very low key setting.  Big portions and not pricey.  We are glad to have Luke's in town."}
{"text":"The service was very good and very fast. The price is a little high, but the portions are huge. I got a beef burger with fries and the burger was a big as my plate! I recommend coming to Luke's, but come at a time where it isn't busy (that isn't often)."}
{"text":"Any restaurant is a great addition to McFarland. Good food, friendly service, large portions. I'm giving it 4 stars because of the decor. It needs some help. Even a TV or two behind the breakfast bar would be a great improvement. I understand they were trying to go for light and bright with the yellow color but it just doesn't work for me. Like at all! I also know it will probably never happen but if they started serving alcohol (bloody mary's anyone?) I'd come here every weekend! :)"}
{"text":"Solid breakfast! Simple old school kitchen style offering large portions, resonable prices and friendly staff.  The only area for improvement is the quality  of the coffee - it was very watered down and rather undrinkable"}
{"text":"Coffee- not great, good price, bottomless 

Veggie benedict-  available as half order! Which I love, BUT Hollandaise not good.  First egg hard cooked second egg less than done...   hashbrowns quite good

Lumberjack scramble- really good actually 

Waffle- not crisp...  not awful and the strawberries she promised were fresh were in a weird sauce not fresh as pictured in the menu




Could use-  
-could use some booths :)  
-was a bit cold 

Final: It was hit and miss.  I'll try again once more... though next time maybe just a veggie omlet."}
{"text":"In terms of small mom and pop shop cafes go this place was great! Not the best breakfast joint I have been to or one I would rave about....but as far as good food, great service, quick service, affordability and being close by home.....this is a good suggestion.

My family and I came in at 10am and found the place pretty slow. We ordered up and were served within 20 minutes for 7 people party.

I got the veggie skillet minus cheese with sourdough toast for $9 which for the portion (smaller than I am used to with San Diego breakfast portions I guess) was worth the money. It tasted amazing and hit the spot I will say that much.

Very kind waitstaff and accurate ordering for us all for such a big party always a plus. My sisters signature french toast looked outstanding and the hotcakes most of the group got as a side item smelled soooo good!

I don't do any flour products so could not sample those to offer any feedback here sadly, sorry folks! Let your eyes be the judge on that.

If your in the McFarland area and want a good breakfast spot (only do breakfast and lunch) for cheap prices......then this is your go-to joint."}
{"text":"Great little joint. Breakfast was prepared quickly and was delicious. The portions were generous and reasonably priced.

Kids got a great Mickey pancake and bacon and it was huge.
Wait staff was super friendly and fast.
We will come again for sure."}
{"text":"OK. Not fancy. Not the cleanest diner, dead bugs in corner, smeared windows, huge pot holes in lot. Food was good not great. Service was good reasonable price. I live near by...won't be coming back. I like my diners clean."}
{"text":"Quick food and good food not quite 5 stars but breakfast was real good.  Cheap prices too get the scrambler"}
{"text":"We gave this place a try on a whim and very glad we did!!!

Ambiance:
Looks like it used to be a Dairy Queen or something like that. Chairs are new and comfortable. It was decked out for Christmas. 

Service:
Excellent. Friendly waitress. Fast service. Coffee cups never went empty. 

Food (the important part):
Excellent. We went for breakfast and got the gyro omelet and the country eggs Benedict. Food was hot. Coffee was strong. Portions were large.  The hash browns were AMAZING. Poached eggs were not overcooked. The tzaziki sauce with the gyro omelette tasted homemade. 

If I had to be critical, the only improvements that come to mind are to preheat the plates and the omelette was a little overdone (prolly too hot of a cooking surface). These are pretty minor issues though in the grand scheme of things. 


I will absolutely come back and recommend this place to friends.

Update:

We've been back to Luke's Cafe 3-4 additional times and continue to be pleased.  Great food and friendly service.  I don't know if they read Yelp reviews, but I previously suggested heating the plates...and now they do!  

One thing I love about this place is your coffee cup never goes empty.  They are great."}
{"text":"This is an American diner type restaurant and very good at it, starting with specifically the service and secondarily the general atmosphere .Our server was friendly, fast, and quick to share info and answer questions. The background \"noise\" of the place had an unmistakable friendly air to it that just made you feel good to be in the same space. We had lunch, the homemade beef noodle soup could've been a meal choice on its own merit. The sweet potato fries were easily some of the best we'd had anywhere  (and very generous portion ) My wife had one of the burgers and it was big and delicious but there is an opportunity to use a better bun if they wanted to get that 5th star. I had a chicken wrap, it was generous,  straight forward and very good. As mentioned in another review,  the coffee is truly nothing special....I will certainly eat here again and would recommend it to friends"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had been wanting to come here for quite some time, so we decided to go on Valentine's day. The place was busy for a little diner, but they had seats open, it wasn't noisy, and despite them being busy the staff were still fast and friendly.

We had cheese curds as an appetizer and it was a big helping for the price of them. He ordered the steak and eggs with pancakes and I had the spartan scramble with pancakes and strawberries; they were both large helpings so we couldn't finish our food. The eggs on both our plates, and his steak, was cooked to perfection, but his hashbrowns were under seasoned. Out of all our food, we enjoyed the pancakes the most. They're very good, and that's coming from a waffle person!

However, the food isn't spectacular. It's average mom and pop food that you can get at any diner in Wisconsin, and that's why I'm giving the restaurant three stars. The experience was nice and I don't regret going there for Valentine's day, but the only thing we'll go back for is the pancakes."}
{"text":"Great place for good fast home style breakfast ! Enjoyed the atmosphere and hash brown are great!"}
{"text":"We were disappointed with this new McFarland restaurant.  We ordered coffee, monte cristo with soup and hashbrowns, and the Philly cheesesteak with soup and fries.  Our coffee was not refilled once.  The soup was an odd yellow gelatinous bowl off goo.  Definitely out of a frozen bag.  The fries were inedible and the hashbrowns were undercooked.  The monte Cristo was soggy with odd tasting syrup.  The Philly was the only good thing.  The service was odd.  Our waitress made us uncomfortable with her inappropriate comments.  Back to the Squirrels nest for breakfast we go."}
{"text":"Not great but decent breakfast. Coffee was good but no real creamer. I try to eat on the lighter/healthier side and there weren't many options. Ordered the veggie Omelet, it had a good variety of vegetables but was over cooked and cheese was only in the very middle of it. Omelet came with hash browns and toast with no alternatives. No fruit available. Hash browns were bland, not much if any seasoning and not crispy enough for my taste. Wheat bread was thick and delicious. Pancakes were big and very good. Only one bathroom stall, so there was a wait to use it. Service was friendly but not too attentive. Drinks were empty for a while,  no extra napkins etc. Overall a decent breakfast but nothing outstanding."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, quick service, and good food. Pretty sure Luke is the one doing the cooking and It shows because it's always consistent. My favorite is the Spartan skillet!"}
{"text":"The staff was friendly and service prompt. We tried the meat lovers skillet, meat lovers breakfast, and a chocolate chip pancake with whipped cream. All of our food was prepared as ordered and tasty. 

Luke's is your typical American style cafe/diner. The food was good, but there wasn't really anything that set this place apart from any other roadside diner. It's nice to have a good comfort breakfast food spot in McFarland though. I'd go back."}
{"text":"EDIT: After thinking about it more, I couldn't think of a single redeeming quality of this place that makes it deserve 2 stars. I would never come back here and I'm still thinking about the awful experience the next day. One star it is. (Also, please look at the owner's response to my review. How unprofessional is that? And what place doesn't season food?? Just take the criticism and move on. The customer is usually right.)

ORIGINAL REVIEW: I'm honestly pretty surprised by all of the high ratings. I was not a fan of this place and I think 2 stars is being generous.

The food was pretty disappointing and bland. I got the sirloin and eggs and my boyfriend got the Hawaiian melt. My steak was hardly seared and very bland, and nothing else on the plate seemed to be seasoned at all. But overall, my dish was much better than the Hawaiian melt. After one bite, my boyfriend said \"they should seriously consider taking this off the menu,\" and I would agree just from seeing it. Not only was the pineapple just in huge chunks which didn't seem to be the best way to do it, but the bread was literally soupy. Not just soggy; soupy. It was a pile of mush, even on the outside parts and at first glance I thought it was some sort of thick sauce that had dripped out of the sandwich onto the plate. When the waitress asked how everything was, he was nice but explained how soggy the sandwich was and the waitress got very defensive, saying that that was how the sandwich was supposed to be because the bread wasn't toasted and the melted cheese was what was causing it. I understand explaining, but to go on the defensive so quickly is not only unprofessional, but just plain rude. And also, who doesn't toast the bread for a melt?? If I were the waitress, a simple \"sorry about that, I'll have a word with the chefs\" would have been much better than her rude response.

Overall, I was pretty disappointed even though I wasn't expecting too much. I wouldn't recommend this place and don't see it lasting long. There are much better diners out there."}
{"text":"very nice place fast friendly  service reasonably  priced good size  portions. I enjoy  the skillets meat lovers being our favorite mainly come for breakfast.had 4 different  styles of  eggs always cooked perfectly kids loved the pancakes only been there once for lunch solid burgers beverages  never went empty till we said no more not OMG spectacular  but very good  food at a reasonable  price  with excellent  friendly  service worth a visit. not open for dinner"}
{"text":"Classic diner. Nice staff. My order of eggs Benedict was cooked perfectly. Coffee wasn't my favorite, but it was hot and refilled often. Not the fanciest atmosphere (go to Madison for that). Come here for a good, old-fashioned diner."}
{"text":"Not sure what to give Luke's. I've been here a few times and service and food have been all over the board and inconsistent.

Classic breakfast food for cheap. Sometimes the food comes out perfect and just the way you ordered it, other times... not so much.

Service is always odd. Very nice people, but... strange people. Thank you for my breakfast, now let me eat in peace. I'm not very interested in hearing about your drunken weekend.

I'll give Luke's another go, but that's about all.. not a huge fan, but don't hate it."}
{"text":"Yuck. First impression: empty parking lot when the brunch spot across the street was packed. Not a good sign. After entering I was put off by the menu; menu was five or six pages long packed full of traditional breakfast items. I wanted something healthy, so I ordered off the delight menu. What I received was a massive omelette topped with a ton of cheese and a huge helping of hash browns. The flavor was mediocre and it didn't seem one bit healthy. 

Simply put, if you want sub-par, greasy diner food, this is the place for you. If you'd like a meal that is better than something you can make at home, find another spot. Because the price you'll pay for the quality you'll get is not worth it in my book."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in here the day after Christmas. They were slightly busy but we got a table right away. We both ordered a skillet with pancakes and it was amazing!! We even had enough leftovers for breakfast the next day! We are happy to have something go into this space that seems to be doing so well! We always love supporting local businesses also. We will definitely be going back!"}
