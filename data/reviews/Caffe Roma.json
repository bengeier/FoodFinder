{"text":"I was really disappointed with this place.  The interior needs remolded, badly.  I sat at the bar, which was adorned with a ton of mail, paperwork, and random items.  The bar, much like the rest of the dining room, was a mess.   I started with the calamari.  The marinara that was served with it was flavorless and tasted like heated up prego.  For my meal, I ordered the chicken parmesan.  It did come out steaming hot, but it was obvious that it was microwaved way too long.  The breading on the chicken was soggy, and the chicken itself was really dry.  The spaghetti was rubbery and the sauce, again, was flavorless. I will not be returning.  From the other reviews, I was expecting \"old style Italian\" food.  What I received was low quality food."}
{"text":"This family run restaurant in Cleveland is a true gem. You can hear Grandma giving counsel in the kitchen to the younger generations if you're paying close attention. From the bread at the beginning of the meal, to the gelato for dessert, it is in-house and amazing! If you are of Italian heritage, you will have feeling you had Sunday dinner with the familia! Make sure you get dessert and bring your appetite. You totally get what you pay for in portion size (and if you're like me, some lunch for tomorrow or a snack for later). In the atmosphere and the friendly wait staff you can tell they travel to the old country. It is not upscale, but a family restaurant and they accommodate as such. This is a good place to bring the kids that's not too much an NOT a chain."}
{"text":"My wife and I wanted Italian food, we found  this restaurant on our GPS. The food was fantastic and the quiet cozy feel reminded us of being back in Milan.   The portions were perfect and the service outstanding. My wife had the stuff ziti, it was out of this world. We finished our dinner with gelato and cannoli. Wow!  We definitely will return when in the area."}
{"text":"We've eaten here about a half a dozen times and their food is a solid B. Today was the first time we've ever gotten dessert (to-go of course). I love tiramisu but this was the worst I've ever had. It had no espresso or booze in it at all and if the amount of mascarpone cheese was any less it wouldn't have any of that either. It was dusted with a very heavy layer of what seemed to be cocoa powder and cinnamon (mostly cinnamon) - yuck. I tried to salvage it at home by scraping off the cinnamon dust and just using straight cocoa powder but the cinnamon taste was forever there. I thought maybe some mocha kuluha might help -nope. The ship had sailed and sunk."}
{"text":"It's hard to find good Italian in Cleveland and this place is the answer. The food is always amazing and gives you a family homemade feeling. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the actual employees aren't the greatest. When you walk in the guys who work there aren't very welcoming. It's very uncomfortable but the women are nothing but nice. The food is what makes my family come back every time."}
{"text":"Seriously the worst restaurant experience in my life.  The Veal Marsala tasted like a maple syrup pancake, the calamari was as chewy as a rubber band, and the frozen veggies that they put in a pretty poor excuse of penne, were completely water logged and under seasoned.  ( Pasta was way under cooked and far from el dente and the sauce was super watery and flavorless) After taking a few bites of everything, we finally chose to tell the waitress (whom was absolutely a sweetheart) that we simply were not happy with the food.  The owner stormed over to us, and argued with us about everything.  She literally grabbed bites of our food with her dirty fingers, and threw them into her mouth and without even cheweing them she swallowed them whole and said everything was delicious.  After I point out that I am a chef, and we both know darn well that the  Marsala did not resemble Marsala under any circumstance (and for $17) and  how  the Calamari was as rubbery as chewing on a shoe she comes back with saying how she thinks the cooks must not have added enough water or flour to the Marsala sauce and says how there is no way it is maple syrup because she doesn't have that in the kitchen.  Um, do we not know what maple syrup tastes like? Regardless if that was their ingredient, it still TASTED LIKE SYRUP!  She also argued that the calamari was still perfect and if we still disagreed she would be willing to just throw it back into the fryer. Um Seriously???  When a customer has to come out and say \"Are you honestly arguing with us, are the customers not always right\" and she says that her food is delicious and that we are crazy, needless to say we will not be back.    I highly suggest the sweet waitress gets a new job. This place is clearly going under."}
{"text":"Loved it! Food was fabulous and service was amazing. Loved the decor. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I love their meat ball and Italian sausage sandwich, their tiramisu is really good too, kids portions are good, service is ok, I have been coming here for 15 years, and it's been always good, it feels like if you are in Roma."}
{"text":"I love fine dining; I love adventurous dining. But sometimes on a gloomy mid-October day I just crave comfort food. Not complex, simple but well executed. I randomly chose to do take-out from Caffe Roma. I was not disappointed! The lasagna was rich, tasted like it had been made with homemade noodles, and came in a huge portion. The garlic bread was also wonderful, homemade bread slathered in garlic butter and topped with cheese. Just what my old italian nana would have made me years ago if I had had one!   Adventurous Italian dining? No. What you enjoyed as a kid? Yes."}
{"text":"I've only had this place a few times brought to me by togo orders, so I've never been inside but their meatball sub is very delish! Ill have to dine in sometime soon."}
{"text":"Little Mom and Pop place which I love. Great food that is reasonably priced. I felt like I was having dinner with an Italian family. No flair, no pretense, just classic Italian carb overload slathered with sauce comfort food."}
{"text":"Lovely food. Simple yet tasty and a real value Will return as often as I can Very friendly staff."}
{"text":"My wife and I had dinner here Tuesday night. First time here, and we loved it! My wife is a picky Italian and she had the Arrabiatta with linguini and raved about the spicy sauce, very authentic and good portion. I had a nice slab of very tasty lasagna, and we both had the simple house salads. Food, service and atmosphere was excellent. We've been looking for a nice authentic Italian restaurant on the near west side ever since Maria's in Lakewood closed, and we finally found our new go-to Italian! Great menu, and there are many choices for the type of pasta for some of the dishes which aren't specific to one type."}
{"text":"I had the stuffed peppers, they were good but the previous time that spicy red sauce was better. It was just hot this time no taste.  Idk about the seafood, two of my friends, and two different times, got sick when they ate the clam sauce."}
{"text":"I have to say this place is the most authentic Italian restaurant I have been to in Cleveland.  The bread tastes like the bread my grandmother used to make and the pasta is just soo delicious!  I really enjoy coming here."}
{"text":"The only thing warranting 2 stars is that bottles of wine are cheap. Horrendous service at best, and the food was almost inedible. See you at Pepper's!"}
{"text":"I've been here a handful of times over the years.  It's family owned and one time I had a kid around the age of 12 filling my water for me.  The food has always been good, quality Italian food. I have had the chicken parm and gnocchi.  Parking can be a nightmare behind the restaurant due to double parking so if you're dining with another couple, try to coordinate that.  Prices are great and their tiramisu was delicious.  I'm sure I'll continue to return for years to come."}
{"text":"Based on recommendations (from Yelpers Will S and Cara L) I ventured to West Park to try out Caffe Roma.  I liked  the place and enjoyed my meal so I'll be back (next time I'm trying the the Pasta Puttanesca!)  The salad was iceberg lettuce based but not poured from a bag.  Although basic it was one of the best salads I've had out.  It is odd to be excited by a restaurant having a chilled super fresh, crisp iceberg lettuce based salad!  It was topped with a few veggies and a generous handful of shredded mozzarella and with a tasty Italian dressing served alongside homemade yeast rolls.  The red wine I selected was basic although a slight pour and I wished they would invest in some decent wine besides all purpose Libby glasses they used! :-)  Some of the pastas are homemade but not all so be sure to ask as I did -- although it was odd to me that the servers had no idea which they made there and had to get a manager or owner to talk with me.  I did love that the person who came over had a heavy Italian accent..  I choose a pasta that was made there -- I think a cavatappi type.  I really enjoyed and appreciated that it was more savory (and in this case a little spicy) and not a sweet sauce.  Not being a red meat eater I did ask the server if the sauce had meat in it and learned that it did not.  When she brought it to me she said she had them prepare it with the marinara because the typical sauce they use has meat broth in it.  That was nice of her to take care of this and good to know should you be a serious vegetarian or vegan.  The serving was generous so I had a small serving for lunch the next day.  The environment is very casual and basic with vinyl table cloths covering the tables in a spacious dining room.  The service was good, prices very affordable although I had kind of hoped for a cute, cozy Italian decor that wasn't the case yet it was a good basic Italian diner."}
{"text":"Got this recommendation from a local hotel employee and had a wonderful experience. The atmosphere was very warm and inviting, very homey! Excellent selection of wines, including some great Italian wines you don't find everyday. The service was great and the food was AWESOME!  Homemade sauces; everything was really good. Mama Carla is there watching over everything and making sure all of her guests are well taken care of. Went two weekends in a row to the same experience. Will make it a must go whenever we're in town."}
{"text":"Its a bit of a hole in the wall, but the food is authentic. I got the carbonara and it was very good. But the thing you really have to try is the calamari! Some of the best I've ever tried! The atmosphere is actually really authentic. The kitchen is blended in right with the dining room. Ample amount of seating, bathrooms are limited. Service is ok, refills were far and few in between, but I'll give my waitress the benefit of the doubt this time because she looked like she was running the gelato counter and waiting tables. Maybe a little understaffed. I haven't tried the gelato yet, (I was stuffed) but I will be sure to try some on my next visit!  Also, parking is limited. You might be circling for a bit, but overall definitely try this place!"}
{"text":"Delicious home cooked italian food in a cozy atmosphere.  A variety of made-from-scratch pizzas, pastas, salads, antipastos, italian coffees, and deliciously crisp cannolis, + gelato from the la gelateria - all at reasonable prices + the fun and convenience of BYOB/W.  A definitive Cleveland neighborhood italian restaurant on the west side!"}
{"text":"Stopped her for dinner after a long walk at Lakewood park, was craving Italian after walking 3 miles what's better than loading up with carbs right? Pass the NO! It's a rip off of any spot in little Italy, horrible clearly jarred tomato sauce; and the presentation of their plates? No couth! I felt like chef Ramsey was gonna run in and make someone an idiot sandwich, I played it safe with chicken parm, which came to me on a plate, drowned in sauce, with ONE splat of cheese. Really guys? Chicken PARMESAN, meaning CHEESE. But hey whatever. My salad tasted like your typical giant eagle bagged salad with the smallest cup of dressing and maybe 5 croutons. I was highly upset, I'm an Italian food lover and this place made me want to rethink my eating habits."}
{"text":"I've been at Caffe Roma several times.  I like their spaghetti and meatballs with great sauce."}
{"text":"Cafe Roma brings back memories of eating in a mom & pop restaurant in the North End of Boston.  Homemade meatballs were just right, pasta not overcooked, veal cutlet the real deal.  Cannoli is also freshly made.  Hard to find, but don't miss out."}
{"text":"I ate an early dinner at Café Roma last week (week of 7-4-16) and it was very, very good..  I ordered an appetizer as my meal (sausage and peppers and onions served w/a small bowl of their sauce and hot bread and butter.)  It was delicious.  Friends ordered gnocci w/sauce.  Yum.  I tasted the gnocci--home made from what I could discern.  Again, yum. This is not a chain.  Yay. It is not noisy. Yay. There is no TV or music blaring away. Yay.  Our server was very accommodating.   Nice, homey and very comfy feel to this place, no rushing or hustling.     My appetizer, which was enough for my evening meal, was $12, including the sauce and bread and butter served with it.  I believe the gnocci was $12.95--huge portions.  Neither person could finish so they go to take leftovers home for an entire second meal.   Next time I come here I'm trying their pizza, which, if it's as good as their sauce, should be fantastic. Parking (free, of course) is behind the restaurant."}
{"text":"Down to earth, inexpensive Italian fare. I had the Wedding Soup and it was very flavorful. I also had Angel Hair Carbonara, and it was delicious. The wine selection is also pretty decent for a \"divey\" little place."}
{"text":"Wish I could give this place 3 1/2 stars. It was good just not as good as the other local places such as peppers in Lakewood or Bruno's in West Cleveland. It is popular though and last time I went it was packed, so we had to head somewhere else. I'll have to check it out again and up my rating if it satisfies my Italian craving. I had the stuff peppers my last visit;it was really good, but we were notified they thought the peppers were medium to hot;assuming I could handle it I gave it a try. I cried the whole time...lol"}
{"text":"I really have mixed reviews. I will say that their marinara sauce is probably the best I've ever tasted! We had a large group of people and started off with mozzarella sticks, that were delicious and plentiful. The hot sausage and peppers which was absolutely outstanding. The calamari was good. The stuff banana peppers were so hot that they're almost inedible. I ordered the veal Parmesan that was very good. I got a side of cavatelli with oil and garlic. Unfortunately the cavatelli was undercooked. The dish had a lot of garlic in it. My boyfriend ordered shrimp Gamberi. Strangely, all of the shrimp had full shelves. This was a pasta dish that was supposed to have shrimp and a blush sauce. There was barely any sauce on the pasta and shrimp all had its shells on it. I don't mean just the tail, but the entire shell. It was very odd and very messy. When he asked for more sauce they apologized and said it would take 10 to 15 minutes because they make it from scratch. When we got the sauce it wasn't the blush sauce that was on the menu. The atmosphere is average for the location. It seems kid friendly. The waitress was OK. I will go back, but not order anything with shrimp and definitely get the sausage and peppers. Yum!"}
{"text":"Went there last night with a friend. The service was up to par but the food was out of this world!!! It is the best Italian food I've ever had in a restaurant by far!!!! I got the lasagna (it's pretty hard to beat my family recipe but this rocked!) a side salad (the Italian dressing tasted homemade) and gelato, which melted in my mouth. We also shared a calamari appetizer which was also yummy. The prices were very reasonable and I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"A bit of the allure is gone for me, but I still love their arrabiata sauce way too much for my own good.   It seems their food has changed, just slightly. New cooks since the small expansion, maybe? I don't know. All I do know is that I loved looking into the previous kitchen and seeing the little, Italian ladies cooking up a storm. Now you look in on who appear to be young, borderline teenage boys. Sigh... it's just not the same. The portions seem slightly smaller and the salads got some sprucing up.  What is the same is that arrabiata... oh, yes. Being a creature of habit I can't help but order that sauce poured abundantly over a big mound of angel hair pasta with meatballs. Also, their homemade bread comes out piping hot, ready to melt some butter. Carb-e-diem, people. Totally worth the hours of working on my fitness that will ensue the next day.   The service has always been a little sketchy, so that was pretty much the same. They also chopped down their wine selections significantly and made each bottle $15 each. I didn't enjoy the Pinot Noir we ordered, mostly because I could have bought it from the grocery store for well under $10--but that's just life when you're ordering wine from a restaurant. Mark-up City!   Anyways, I still can't drop them a start considering I continue to come back and enjoy my food. And for that price? It still rocks. I just wish some of the more recent changes would go back to the way they used to be. Ahhh, memories...."}
{"text":"This is about as good as it gets for Italian. Joe and his family (literally!) are from Italy and understand the importance of fresh ingredients and warm smiles."}
{"text":"Not overly impressed.  The calamari was decent but nothing special.  We got the pasta carbonara and the lasagna.  The carbonara had a really odd after taste and was very salty, while the lasagna had an extremely sweet red sauce and the noodles were over cooked.   Really didn't feel it was worth the $40 bill.  The plus side was the homey atmosphere, but the waitress could have been much friendlier.  Overall I will not be returning."}
{"text":"This is how Italian cooking should be! Sauces are absolutely fantastic. Everything is home made here and they use no garlic on the sauces and no ricotta on lasagna just how it should be! Place is simple, not big but the food is fantastic. Staff is really friendly and I do disagree with all the other reviews saying the opposite.  The bread for the sandwiches is freshly baked which makes them extra tasty!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here since they opened in 2004. My family was actually one of their first customers! I love this place!  This place is the perfect small Italian eatery with a cozy feel to it.   The food is amazing! Great portions, home-cooked style Italian food. My favorite is the cavatelli with meatballs, spaghetti aglio-olio, and chicken parmesan! Also definitely get a salad before the meal, the house dressing is a delicious oil and vinegar style dressing! Tiramisu is also a great finish to a wonderful meal! I recommend it!  Caffe Roma is run by a wonderful Italian family, and the service is great! Always friendly and make you feel right at home!  If you live in the area, don't miss this wonderful gem of a restaurant! Try it!"}
{"text":"The hidden Italian gem of this area. It's never very crowded, the service is great and they're very accommodating if you have a food allergy. The food is amazing - I've had their calamari served with warm marinara sauce and their pastas are delicious! There's always just the right amount of sauce. The prices are cheap for the amount of food you get. My coworker and always come here for dinner one night when we're in town. Always satisfied!"}
{"text":"The 3 stars is mostly for the help.  I wanted to just love this mom and pop Italian restaurant, and I did, but for the help, not the food. My fiance and I just purchased a house in Jefferson/West Park area. We wanted to celebrate after the closing at a random spot near our house, so we picked Caffe Roma.   We walk in, and the help is instantly there for you. We were seated and instantly helped by our waitress. She was very young but you could tell she really liked her job. It was the middle of the week so they weren't busy. It seems the place gets a lot of regulars that have been coming to the restaurant for many many years.  I order a red sauce dish and my fiance ordered the carbonara. He'd never had it before, but I described it to him and he was super excited to get his dish. We ordered a side of garlic bread and marinara ($2.00-$3.00 for like 6 large pieces, what a steal!). It was good. The sauce was super sweet. It didn't scream \"homemade\" but I liked it otherwise.  The pasta dishes arrived. Good prices for the amount of food, that's for sure. I wasn't particular in love with my dish. I found myself drenching the pasta with parmesan to give it more flavor. The carbonara tasted like noodles with butter. That's it. I was expecting so much more.  I don't want to hate on the place, because it's a great little spot on the West Side. The help was fantastic, but the food was just sub par for me. I probably won't find myself here again any time soon, but it wasn't a horrible dinner. My expectations were high, and I came out feeling unfulfilled."}
{"text":"So NOT fair to rate this restaurant on anything other than what it is:  old style Italian food, made by old style Italians. Do the vinyl tableclothes and casual bar make it look like you should expect a gourmet salad?  No, it screams iceberg.  So why would you order it and then Complain about it?  ( see below reviews) One look at this place and you'll know what you should order: Gnocchi, spaghetti, meatballs and bread. All as authentic as any Italian grandmas kitchen. Order things they make from scratch;  their specialties. Delicious."}
{"text":"Italian Food as Authentic as it gets.  Right down to the owner.   The Pasta is Awesome and the service is Great!!  Huge Portions. Had my son's Wedding Rehearsal Dinner there and the people could not stop talking about it."}
{"text":"First time here and definitely not my last.  The Chicken Parm was perfect and the stuffed Penne in meat sauce was amazing.  I can't wait to try the other menu items.  I'm not sure why it took me so long to stop in but certainly glad I did."}
{"text":"Excellent spot for Italian food. If you like veal parmesan like myself for the price you can't beat caffe Roma. The homemade bread and pizza are also very good. Looking for a good appetizer try the stuffed peppers. Mangia Mangia!!"}
{"text":"I'm a bit surprised there's only two reviews for it.   Caffe Roma is tucked away in the west park. It is quite small with only 10 tables in the main inside room (an adjacent room had a private party, so I don't know if it's also normally open] I never heard of it until my sister had a recommendation for it from a friend.   The menu boasted a homemade pizza using Mama's authentic recipe. Whoever mama is, the pizza is what I've been looking for in Cleveland. $1.25 a slice; Mostly topped with diced tomatoes, some very lightly sprinkled grated cheese [parmeasan, I believe] and a light tomato sauce with some herbs sprinkled on top, delicious.  I've seen too much of the loaded mozzarella cheese with salty tomato sauce pizza around in Cleveland and this thankfully was not it.   Caffe Roma offers more sophisticated options than a typical Italian place at this low price range [no entree on the menu is more than $15-16]. In addition to just basic items like a type of pasta with your choice of sauces and eggplant parmasean, there a few additional items like a dish with capers, mussels, a pasta dish with red cream sauce and shrimp, and Spaghetti Carbonara [the entree, only $12]. My grandpa is a picky eater and he found it to his satisfaction. They added plenty of mushrooms and extra sauce to his plate upon his request. His main gruff was that the bread (complimentry) was not Italian, but was a set of rolls.  I noticed no music inside, which I actually liked.   On a Friday evening, around 6:00 PM, the place was bustling also with pickup orders, but the service never slacked off at all. The service was quite good with the 2-3 servers to the place coming by us and helping us out, and they were nice enough not to kick us out after we sat there for 10-15 minutes after paying our bill.   You can also bring your own wine although they do now have wine there.   A great place that has Italian food [more authentic than other places] on a cheaper budget."}
{"text":"I like this place. Simple Italian. They don't try to be trendy by putting an egg on top of your spaghetti dinner to claim some idiotic innovation prize. Salads are basic. Sauce is traditional red. Meatballs are like your Italian grandma's. Chicken Parmesan is thin cut and tasty, but I don't think it's prepared fresh for each order. All in all a decent spot for bare bones, no frills Italian. Its not Mama Santa's, but not bad for a west side, non-chain, hole in the wall."}
{"text":"My husband raved how good the food was here. I wanted olive garden. But,nooo..he insisted we go here.      Needless to say...not impressed in the least. Very outdated, dirty,and I was cringing on the inside. To appease this man of mine, I gave it a try. We ordered wedding soup, mozzarella sticks,andpizza.I ordered angel hair with marinara,and he ordered eggplant parm. It was a whole pound of boxed pasta with out of the jar ragu sauce. The soup was ok. Microwaved no doubt.       Our waitressnever came over...not once while we were eating to see how things tasted. She sat talking with some guy the whole time. Then, some guy who worked there was out working on his car out back, kept coming in and out huffing and puffing whilst mumbling under his breath.     45 dollars later plus a tip.... Not worth it. Definitely not authentic Italian food."}
{"text":"I'd eaten here once before with a large group, and wasn't overly impressed but didn't hate it either. Recently, I was a fan. I ordered take-out, and within 15 minutes of phoning in I was on my way home with enough lasagne and tiramisu for two days (one portion of each) for $14. I also received a portion of what I perceived to be homemade Italian bread. It was just as I like it - warm and chewy. The lasagne was accompanied by a delicious bright red sauce, and I was provided a portion of Kraft-style Parmesan cheese. It was a bit salty, so I didn't use it. All in all, you'll get very good home-made food for a decent price. You can't beat that as far as I'm concerned."}
{"text":"I've lived in the same neighborhood as Caffe Roma for years. I dined here the week I moved into my new house in 2008 and really had no desire to return, despite its convenient location.   I recently made a second visit, totally hoping that they've improved. But nope!  I just don't get it - the penne arrabiata I ordered was basically penne with Ragu for about $10. My date ordered pasta olio e aglio (normally my favorite dish to order at any Italian restaurant), and he was underwhelmed as well.   I should have consulted Yelp reviews first... Maybe in five or six years when I venture back against my will, I'll try the pizza.   Also, the rumors of the employees not getting tipped out - that is pretty disturbing."}
{"text":"We are from Cincinnati, so we've only gotten to visit this place twice, but both times have been great experiences. The food is wonderful! For example, the antipasto plate comprises really wonderful, high quality olives, cheese, prosciutto, salami, pepperoni, and pepperocini. VERY high quality. All the pastas, meats, and seafood entrees were wonderful. The kitchen cooperates if you want to customize a dish w a different sauce or pasta, no sweat. No, it's not Olive Garden.....it's a far superior offering. Personal: like how your mom and my mom don't make identical meat loaf? This Italian is not precisely like anybody else's Italian. The bread was great and they'll bring seasoned oil upon request. The wine list was fine (in a very un-snobby way).  There were many bottled beers, not draft. (The waitress didn't know what draft beer was!) Parking is tight, but the attendant tried to help. Service was perhaps a little amateurish, but warm, efficient, and accurate, even with a large party. The sum total (great food, personable dining room, cheap wine, quality ingredients) tells you in a nutshell why a customer chooses this over a corporate, chain experience. Because good and bad, for better and for worse, this is real food with with heart and soul. Just like people, its strengths (small, homey, affordable, relaxed) and its weaknesses are one and the same."}
{"text":"OK, OK, so it's not fine dining, but Caffe Roma does make decent pasta.  I've been here twice.  Really liked the Linguini with Clams (from real clams, not canned, I checked) in white sauce.  My next visit, I moved on to the Puttanesca, but found the red sauce ran a little too sweet for my tastes. I'd say go here for a quick carb fix, but not a full sit-down meal."}
{"text":"I've often found that increased complexity is not a good sign--it usually indicates that an establishment is trying to hide some of the flaws somewhere in their processes.  So it's an encouraging sign that Caffe Roma serves up no-frills Italian food, letting the fresh ingredients shine through on their own.  By far my favorite part of the meal was the bread selection.  Hot, fresh Italian bread is an excellent (and dare I say, necessary) start to the meal.  Just be careful not to eat too much as the main dish portions are on the large side.  I ordered the Italian Sausage Sandwich with Peppers and Onions.  The sausage was very flavorful but not overly spicy while the roll was one of the freshest I've ever had with a sandwich.  I'd get it again, though the pasta main dishes that other people ordered looked great as well.  Decisions, decisions...  But that was all child's play compared to the desserts.  Homemade cannolis filled with a mascarpone cream filling as well as Tiramisu that was pretty heavy on the rum (or whatever alcohol was used)--you can't beat that!  And the portions are small enough that you don't need to feel bad about taking two.  I've heard the gelato is very good as well, but I haven't had the chance to try it yet.  The only drawback was the somewhat slow and unresponsive service.  Though it makes for a nice, relaxing, Italian-style meal, it was a bit overkill.  This was particularly the case after the meal when it took a little while for us to get the check and have the credit card processed.  If you run into similar problems when you eat here, a gentle nudge might help."}
{"text":"Very great Italian food and friendly staff ! I have tried a few menu items and you can't go wrong with meatballs , lasagna, or the chicken piccata ."}
