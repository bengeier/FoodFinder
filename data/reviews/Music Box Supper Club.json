{"text":"Great location, unique place, good food. I went for a conference, so I can't speak to the music."}
{"text":"The venue is absolutely beautiful however that does not make up for the overpriced drinks and lack luster food... We started with the hummus platter and the lobster Mac and Cheese. The hummus was ok however the lobster Mac was lacking seasoning and lobster. The kielbasa sandwich was not good either as the sandwich was very dry. Too much bread compared to the sausage/toppings... Best part of the meal was chips. We also got the gumbo which was ok, it came out warm not hot. I would not recommend to friends or family. The service was very slow, had to go to the bar if I wanted a refill on drinks..."}
{"text":"Not known for your food or good service. The food came out cold twice, there was a rogue hair and a server who was less than thrilled to be working. Entertainment easy great, but they really need to step up the rest of their game for the prices."}
{"text":"The sound in this place was excellent.  What a great venue in a prime location.  

I cannot vouch for the food as our server disappeared after we ordered drinks and we never saw her or the drinks ever again.  I told myself that I didn't want food or drinks anyway.

I'll be back for more music, though."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time last night to see X.  I've been to many concert venues including \"supper club\" type places elsewhere offering rock shows, most notably Rams Head On Stage in Annapolis.  They tend to book bands that draw a lot of older people who may want to sit and have some food/ drinks from a table instead of standing up and bopping for the whole gig, which is a fine idea;  I fit the demographic and while I still attend some stand-up-and-bop shows, I'm more cognizant of my need to sit down than I was when I was 20. 

Music Box is new and obviously still working out some bugs.  Right now I'd give them about 2 1/2 stars.  Since Yelp doesn't allow for a half star, I decided to round down rather than up because 3 stars is what I give to a place when everything is basically all right, and, while there are some good things to say about Music Box, there's definitely room for improvement. 

First the good things:  
 - When you buy advance tickets, you can choose your individual seats from a seating chart and decide whether you want to be in front, in back, away from the sound board, etc. There is no need to become a VIP member to do this (the website is a wee bit misleading in that regard). 
 - The concert room is nicely decorated and there are good sightlines from almost all seats, although you may need to turn your chair sideways to watch the band (this is normal for supper club venues with tables).  I chose to sit in the back at a raised table area facing the stage where there were individual seats - works well if you're attending by yourself and don't want to sit at a table facing strangers, provides a great view of the band, you are close to an aisle if you want to get up and dance, and you get the best sound back there. 
 - The sound at the X show was XCELLENT.  Really top-notch. 
 - The seating, while not the most comfortable chairs I've ever plotzed in, was OK. 
 - A server came to take my drink order within a couple minutes after I was seated and the servers were reasonably attentive throughout the show, at least at the back area where I was. 

Now, the \"room for improvement\" part:
 - There was NO food served at this show despite the \"supper club\" ambience.  None at the tables and I don't even think you could get any at the back bar.  Very weird for a \"supper club\" that has been touting its food offerings, especially since a large crowd was attending so it wasn't a case of \"too few people to justify opening the kitchen\".  I wasn't expecting a three-star Michelin experience but I did expect to be able to order a good sandwich, fries, maybe even a decent salad since this is a fancier club setting.  Since I was attending by myself and also probably wouldn't be able to make it down there much before the 8:30 show time due to work, the idea of a sit-down meal in the separate restaurant didn't appeal to me, and not having food during the show meant I also couldn't drink alcohol, so I sat at a table all night with no food and drink and for no discernible purpose.   
 - The tables in the room are really mooshed together to the point where people were practically sitting in each others' laps. If you stand up to dance or cheer, you might elbow someone in the nose.  I was happy to see most patrons realized this and stayed in their seats.  It also made it hard for the servers to visit the parts of the room that didn't have an aisle (basically everyplace but the back and sides).  
 - The very back of the room had tables advertised as window view seats; however, the curtains were pulled all along the back of the room so if there was a view (likely, the club is on the river with nice city views),no one could see it.   
 - The process by which you enter the club and get to your seat needs improvement.  There was no sign to direct advance ticket holders to go right upstairs so I had to stand in a line for several minutes behind ticket buyers to learn this.  When I got upstairs another person scanned my ticket and was going to seat me, then told me to wait till she scanned two more people behind me and she would take us all together, then another usher came out and she told HER to take the two people behind me.  Meanwhile a third usher had come out and was supposed to seat me but she instead got into a conversation with some manager type.  Then a FOURTH usher came out and finally showed me to my seat.  It should not require four ushers and ten minutes to show one person (me) to a seat and people should be seated in the order they arrive. A half hour later I saw all the ushers in the middle of the club having another conversation while people were walking in and seating themselves - the guy in front of me sat in the wrong seat and had to be displaced by the other folks at the table. 
 - Parking (non-valet) is 7 dollars, on top of a $35-40 ticket, in a city where parking for shows elsewhere is often free. 

So, A+ for music & sound, C+ for everything else, plus it's pricey = I'm not in a hurry to return."}
{"text":"I should preface this review with a crucial personal detail: I am not the type of person that's entirely open to a venue of this style. I'm much more comfortable in spots like the Happy Dog, Now That's Class, and the Beachland... places where rowdiness reigns in bursts. I enjoy standing and getting amped up at the right times. The Supper Club is the inverse of this, so my perceived experience may be a little unfair because I went in knowing it was a half-step out of my comfort zone.

Though I admire how the venue has brought great artists like Robyn Hitchcock and Lucinda Williams back to Ohio, the food drastically needs some attention. The cider-based drink I received was fine but unspectacular. More importantly, the $12 Lobster Mac and Cheese wasn't worth a fourth of its price. Bland, soggy, and oddly textured, it seems like one of the menu's weakest points. My boyfriend ordered the sliders, which he also found mediocre. I also felt the entire selection was overpriced since there wasn't one item under $8.

Seeing as one has an assigned seat at a shared table, the famed \"date night\" may become awkward. The seating is cramped during a full show, and I didn't enjoy sitting right next to another couple on a night that was supposed to be a special one for myself and my significant other. This may be more of an issue of personal space, but it did affect my experience and I wish the setup had been less stiff.

There were small pros. The waitress we had was very sweet, and the view of the river is a definite perk. But these details do not make up for the lackluster, overly expensive food. My recommendation? Eat dinner elsewhere, then go to the show."}
{"text":"First thing to note for those of you reading these reviews - this place is brand new.  It just opened the week of 8/11/2014.   That being the case (and I was aware of this before we showed up) I was not expecting perfect, or even great at this point.  Just because a restaurant/venue has rough patches the first weeks (or even a month or two) doesn't mean that it is going to continue to have difficulties. Knowing that there would probably be \"issues\" didn't stop me from going there, however (I'll go anywhere within driving distance from Columbus to see Bruce Cockburn perform).

With that as a preface, here's what we think about the place.  It was easy to find for an out-of-towner.  Don't bother with the valet parking, especially on a weekday and if you arrive in plenty of time - the pay lot is literally right next door.  Yes, there is a desk when you arrive into the building - they are there to direct you straight up to the performance space or into the restaurant, wherever your destination may be. It wasn't confusing, it just expected you to speak to a human for 12 seconds if you didn't already know where to go (if you did know you could ignore them and walk right past).  We booked a table at the downstairs restaurant rather than eat in the performance space.  We had a reservation, and were immediately seated.  The servers did seem a bit harried, but nothing too bad, and it took them 5 minutes to initially talk to us and take our drink and apps order, and about another 8 minutes for all of that to arrive.  My cucumber- gin cocktail was very good.  The \"Belgian\" fries with truffle and parm were okay - I've had better, the fries could have been cooked crispier to my taste (probably why they arrived so fast). Note to the chefs - if you are going to be cute and call them Belgian rather French, they need to be served with mayo rather than catsup.  Husband had the cold corn bisque, which was excellent, and I had the caprese salad with was just okay, which was disappointing during the height of tomato season in Ohio (obviously ice-cold refrigerated tomatoes, which is a big no-no).  All of that was enough to fill us up.  Done in time to get upstairs for the performance.

Upstairs - well, if it is an act that I really want to see, and I can't see elsewhere, we'll be back.  The acoustics and sight lines were great, no complaints there.  But the space is really really tight.  Believe me, they have crammed as many tables as they possibly can in there.  I dislike sitting sideways on a chair for 2+ hours so I can look at the stage.  I was literally sitting with my knees against the side of the chair beside me with my arm resting on the back of the chair of the person behind me at the next table.  If we do ever come back, we'll opt for the back of the room at the bar seating area that faces directly forward - further from the stage, but not sitting crooked for the duration of the show and you can easily get up and walk over to the bar and get yourself a drink without some big commotion.

So, hopefully the kinks will get worked out to make the performance space  bit more comfortable."}
{"text":"The food was overpriced , terrible servers - my husband retrieved our food because the server never came!  I want the flats to succeed because it's great down there, but this place was very very bad."}
{"text":"Here for the first time for a show (upper level Concert Hall)... Saturday night with The Smithereens.  Good venue for the music fan... seating by ticket and not a bad seat in the house... it's much smaller than I expected (a good thing).  Sound quality is top-notch.

We only had drinks, but others at the table had food... everyone seemed pleased with food, but service across the board (for our table at least) was a bit scattered.  I saw many servers taking good care of their tables while ours was MIA for periods at a time.  Maybe we got the bad luck of the draw.  

Either way, I'll definitely be back for a show, though may decide to catch dinner elsewhere beforehand."}
{"text":"I feel like this place is overpriced for what it is. We went on sunday for the brunch and concert and you have to make reservations for the brunch to go to the concert. The place was nice and the service was good but the food was a whole other issue. The buffet was $18 and that didn't include the carving station, that was an extra $10 so we opted out of it along with most of the restaurant it seemed. I'm not sure why it needed to be $18 for the buffet because the food was nothing spectacular. It was holiday inn quality food. Greasy thin bacon, flavorless potatoes, scrambled eggs, yogurt, breakfast burrito,and unripe fruit. If you want to get a drink the bloody mary bar starts at $10.00 and goes up from there. So If you get the buffet plus a drink plus watch the music you have now spent $38.00 plus tip and if you want the carving station its $48.00 plus tip. I think that is way too much money. I noticed on the way out that they were giving away free tickets to a show but dinner reservations were required. I think I will pass thanks."}
{"text":"Kate the great! Best server ever! We had drinks within minutes of sitting down to hear Will Hoge! Make sure and ask for KATE!"}
{"text":"Sitting right on the river, the views can't be beat. I visited during Brite Winterfest and couldn't have had a better experience! Friendly bar staff, ample room, beautiful views, clean bathrooms, good food, and of course- there's always a great band playing! Music Box is a gem!"}
{"text":"Our second visit was a big disappointment.  Went tonight to see REVIVAL - A TRIBUTE TO THE ALLMAN BROTHERS BAND.  When I bought my general admission tickets I was told that the doors open at 8:30 PM. When we arrived at 8:35 we found out that they had been letting people in for some time already.  Then I find out that there are no seats available.  I complained to the manager that I bought general admission not standing room tickets.  He got rude and tried to blame the band.  I didn' t buy the tickets from the band I bought them from the venue.  They gave me a refund for the tickets but I am still out the parking fee.  Music Box Supper Club sold the tickets under false pretenses. A very deceitful practice.  They knew that they would not have a seat for every ticket sold.  It would be okay if they revealed before  I bought the tickets that they weren't actually general admission tickets but there was absolutely no indication that we would be expected to stand.  Unless they change their deceptive ticket sales I will not be back and cannot recommend this place."}
{"text":"This is a great place for music and food. Setting, acoustics (one of the few places that keeps the sound levels tolerable even for electric acts), food and service (Kate was our server tonight) are all excellent. Lobster macaroni and cheese, short ribs, margherita flatbread, and crime brûlée were outstanding."}
{"text":"Great vibe and location and entertainment. Food was good, however it was probably the worst service I've ever witnessed.... Our drink order came out with dinner, 45 minutes after ordering... Ice was melted in my mixed drink... Others I the group had cold food. Completely missed the mark with the service side... It's a shame, because the place could've been cool. Also our drinks were twice as expensive upstairs compared to downstairs???? Seemed very odd... All in all I won't be a repeat customer"}
{"text":"I have been to the Music Box a total of three times. It's a great place to see a show for those of you, like me that actually like to sit and enjoy the music. The concerts I have have seen have been great and I hope they continue to cater to this type of acoustic music. The service has been steadily improving and though the drinks may be a bit pricey you have to separate the fact that you are downtown and that goes with territory. Parking is close and the views are tremendous. This being said, the food is very overpriced for what you get and though what I did get was tasty I have taken to eating prior to. I don't mind the community table concept but I would enjoy a little more space. The tables are very cramped and the venue does get crowded making it tough to navigate. All in all I will be back and I hope to see more old \" hippie\" music at the Box. Definitely come to enjoy the music, make a new friend ( but not have to sit in their lap) watch the musicians from a seated position and if your lucky like me actually meet and talk with the artist. Keep on truckin' Music Box. Can't wait for some summer shows."}
{"text":"7:15 seating for 9 people. Sat away from the stage which was nice. Tables were uncomfortably small....not sure why. 

Even though not 75% crowded, our server took at least 20 minutes to fill drink orders. 

I chose the strip steak which was prepared nicely, but not worth the price. 

Maybe will be returning in the summer but not all that impressed."}
{"text":"The food needs attention and serious improvement. Wonderful venue with classic CLE views but I would eat before attending a show. Our food was decent but in a town full of great food, this fantastic new place needs to turn its attention to food. 

Had mediocre nachos, acceptable Caesar salad, strange burger and mediocre pulled pork."}
{"text":"As a music venue, the Music Box provides a comfortable and intimate setting to enjoy a diverse mix of artists.  It's located in a scenic spot right on the banks of the Cuyahoga River on the West Bank of the Flats.  I really enjoyed seeing Apollo's Fire there.  They are amazingly talented artists.

However, in terms of being a restaurant, there is much room for improvement.  Their menu selections seem very disjointed from each other, and it is difficult to understand what their chef had in mind when the theme of the menu was created.  We had the Margherita Flatbread, and the Antipasti Platter.  Both items were of below average quality for what we expected based on the menu prices. The flat bread was constructed in a very sloppy fashion, and was nearly cold by the time it made it to our table. The Antipasti Platter also arrived looking very disheveled with large slices of meat actually hanging way over the side of the platter. The quality of the items that comprised this dish were also subpar.  We disliked it so much that we actually only ate about a third of it and I asked our server to please remove it from the table. Our server never asked us if we liked it, or acknowledged that we had not really appeared to enjoy it based on how little we had consumed.  This is an item that I typically order many other places. By far, this was the worst one I have ever had.  Additionally, it took forever to get bar service, and after about 25 minutes, we asked our server where our beverages were, and it turned out that she had given them to another table.  There was then an additional 15 minute wait to get drinks delivered to our table.  Additionally, we were initially seated at the wrong table, and after we had already been sitting there for 15 minutes, we were uprooted and forced to move. Throughout all of this inconvenience, we were never even offered a complimentary cocktail, or appetizer in order to apologize for the confusion.  The staff was indeed very pleasant and polite, but there is clearly a disconnect in regard to organization, and how to treat guests when things don't go as they should.  

My suggestion would be to make sure to eat somewhere else first if you are going to see a performance at the Music Box. Also, don't expect a reasonable speed of service from the bar, or the kitchen.  

The bottom line:  Our total check for the two appetizer items that I mentioned, two glasses of wine, and one cocktail came to nearly $60. Unfortunately, based on the quality of food, and grossly disconnected service that we received, we did not feel that we received anywhere near a fair value for the amount of money that we spent."}
{"text":"I would give 0 stars but I don't think that is possible. I went for the parachute concert which was amazing and it was a beautiful place but my waitress, heather was rude and aggressive we asked her to take a picture and she basically said no and we couldn't tell if she was serious. She hardly checked on us we had to wait an hour just to order dessert. In the end of the night I picked up my cousin check and also paid for myself. I paid 15$ check with a 20$ and she didn't not give me my change back I also tipped her 3$ on my card so she basically stole my money and over tipped herself."}
{"text":"I called this place multiple times on a Saturday afternoon to find out about parking for a wedding that evening. No answer on extensions 1-5, all the way up to 5pm, when we were set to arrive. How could nobody be available to answer the phone on a wedding afternoon? Not done yet: when I arrived I asked the receptionist about this situation. He just shrugged his shoulders. More: at five minutes to 6 pm, I was told I could not have a glass of wine from the open bar - it was \"closed to 6.\" Later, the bartender told me I could not have a glass of wine during the ceremony. Then, my wife's request for a soda was deffered by the bartender in favor of 7 men who arrived much later. Other people at the wedding also commented on the bartender's extremely rude behavior.
   Music Box administrators: Do you call this hospitality?? If someone arrives a couple of minutes early, the bartender sees what he could do to accommodate the request. He should be gracious and use appropriate manners. 
   I point this out for the benefit of your establishment. Look at your reviews!!! Your place is developing quite a reputation for the wrong reasons."}
{"text":"My first visit for a BoDeans show, and really liked the venue. The table seating up front was a little tight, but I had a good seat for the show and the server was prompt and polite. I did not eat, but will do so on my next visit and edit my review. The greeters at the door are friendly and inviting. The venue itself is in a great location; beautiful spot. Can't wait to go back, which will be soon because they have good lineups there - I haven't been able to get back since the October BoDeans show."}
{"text":"DONT GO HERE!!!!    Complete mismanaged disaster. Had to wait 45 minutes for our reservation time, that we made a month and a half before. When talking to the ticket office and the hostess, we were completely blown off. They stuck my family, with a 4 and 7 year old up against a bar ledge, with a view of a vertical support beam. Completely oversold the place and had no idea how to manage it. Then the food was completely awful, cold, dry and just plain bad. You could see many many unhappy people and even the wait staff looked frustrated. The band was great, but that doesn't make up for an unbelievably awful time, and for ruining my Father's Day. I will be telling people as long as I can to avoid this place like the plague. Please, I beg you, don't waste a dime of your money on this awful awful waste of money"}
{"text":"This place is poorly managed. We sat down and waited about 15 minutes. Nobody came to our table except the three confused people trying to drop off other customers' food. We got up and left. As we walked past the 3 unnecessary hostess people they asked us why we were leaving. They gave us a coupon for a free appetizer with purchase of blah blah. I didn't read it. 

Back to the weird hostess situation, when you walk in, there is an entryway. Inside the entryway are two receptionists at a desk and a door man. Then as you walk in to the bar/restaurant area there is another hostess. So there are 4 employees to get you into the place, but nobody to wait on you. 

I will not go back because there are just too many great restaurants in Cleveland to visit. I'm glad The Supper Club did not get a penny of my money."}
{"text":"Went to the supper club for the first time to a $7 Frank Sinatra concert. Except for the kitchen being baacked up and waiting 45 min for our appitizers it was such a good evening.  The show was fab. Thought because it was $7,it would be short. He did two sets with a break. What!  Have tried three diff appit. All good.  You also get a comp drink of the nite and a punch card. If you attend 4 or 5 $7 shows , you get one free.  Similar to comedy clubs. Tables  small n close.  They have tables for 2 to maybe 6 or. 8.  Looking forward to the next one. Parking fills fast close. Lots nearby for 6 or 5  that nite."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my experience. Parking was $6 and we went to a Lucky 7 concert which was $7 and included a drink. Bossa Nova night was just perfect. I would have paid more to see the awesome duo (Luca Mundaca and an awesome percusionist) The food is overpriced but I guess that is how they make their money, you could just eat before or after if that is s problem. The place is beautiful with excellent views and atmosphere. The service was a little slow when the concert started but then the server got better checking on us while we were eating... it was ok.

I had a chop salad with chicken which I thought was small for $14 but then it was $12.50 on my check. My friends had salads and also de sliders whith frech fries which she seemed to like. The food is not something to write home about but it tasted good and I enjoyed my salad with the complimentary Cuba Libre during the performance.

The sound is fantastic, I cannot wait to try a concert at the Concert Hall. This is not at all expensive considering how beautiful the place is and the high quality of the performances. Check it out!! I am think I want to come at least once a week now. I am hooked!"}
{"text":"The food and service are surprisingly good.  I was expecting bar food, but got something more like a 4 star restaurant.  All I had was a burger and fries, but they were outstanding. Ordered the burger medium, hoping for a tinge of red as no one ever cooks a burger to medium, and was surprised to find it pink all the way through, like medium should be!   I had my eye on the Perch, but chickened out at the last minute.  Guy at the table next to me didn't, and boy did it look good.  Had the half order of bread pudding for desert- it was decadent!  Also had a couple of Southern Tier 2X IPAs.

Came in to see Commander Cody.  Had no idea who that was, but it was marketed as Blues and I was in a Blues kinda mood.  Very glad I did so!  Should have billed the guy as a 'Chuck Berry' kind of band.  Great show!

The only thing stopping this place from getting 5 stars is the bait and switch in their pricing.  The concert tickets were cheap:  $20.  However, they make it up in the food & drink pricing.  $14 for a burger and fries.  The beers were $13 for a tall.  The 1/2 desert was $9.  Service was great, and again the show was a blast, so I'm willing to pay a little bit more.  Look forward to going back again soon."}
{"text":"I really like this place. It's a little different from what I usually like, since I feel a little weird just sitting and staring at a musician or band. But, this is a supper club, so I went in with an idea of what to expect.

I've seen shows both downstairs and upstairs and I must say I think I prefer downstairs, but I love it all! The venue is nice, the staff is wonderful (and especially when they're trying to take orders over the noise of a show, they do a great job!), and the acts that they bring here are so fun! I've only eaten here once (downstairs before a menu revamp, so I can't really speak to the quality of the food much). Even though this is a supper club, I don't usually plan on eating where I'm seeing a show, so this isn't a really important part to me. I did note that the service can be a little slow, even when you're just ordering beers. The layout of the place and the packed shows certainly don't help this situation. 

I'll certainly be back here plenty of times, I'm sure, and I recommend checking it out if you haven't yet! Such a great part of the Flats!"}
{"text":"We were there for the Prince Tribute.  AGAIN, the music was great.
BUT we purchased seats months earlier - then the standing room only people filled the dance floor and we had to stand to see the group.
Why pay for tickets when you can get SRO and get in front of everyone?
So several of us had to stand a very high/drunk young girl started an issue because the floor was crowded and pushed 2 people in our group.
NOW -  this is the second time we have had an issue with the \"manager king\" of the club.    When we got the manager they were going to escort the girl out and then decided we both should go!!!! REALLY....WTF. The guard said one of us swore - and it was actually a girl in that girls group that did that.  OMG - BTW we are all over 60 (I hate saying that) so trust me we were not going try to make a scene.
The first time this awful excuse for a manager showed his customer service was when we were there for the Beatles Brunch.  Again, bought tickets 2 months ahead and had no table when we got there.  Had to sit our party of 10 around the room on stools.  ARE YOU KIDDING ME.. when we complained he said - rudely - if you came earlier we could have done something?  WHAT???  And the Brunch food is truly awful BTW.
After incident number 2 - we spoke to who we were told was an owner and told him both scenarios.  He took us downstairs and bought us all a drink and apologized.....but we missed the second act of show I was enjoying because of a \"big fish, little pond syndrome\" non-manager.  As an FYI my family was in the restaurant business and would never tolerate an employee with no customer service skills this long.
He also made a waitress eat a check for a patron at a Sunday talk because their check was late - WHAT - get enough staff then.  And here all of a sudden you care about the customer..............(head shake)
We have been to the Music Box no less than 15 times and I am guessing we will not be back......and BTW Music Box owner - the older generation are the spenders...."}
{"text":"I thoroughly enjoyed my first show at the Music Box Supper Club, and I have no doubt I'll buy tickets to future shows. MBSC a nice (new!) venue on the river in the Flats and I'm (sincerely) delighted it's here. 

The show I saw was in the upstairs concert hall. The downstairs is the supper club. I didn't understand this distinction until I looked at the website a few minutes ago. The upstairs and downstairs both have adjacent patios with seating (and views of the river/downtown). It's a classy addition to the West bank of the Flats. 

The building and space looks nice. Nothing extravagant or too memorable, but offers an air of class. 

Parking was $8 for valet and I think $6 or $7 for self park (?). The valet explained that if we didn't get our vehicle within 30 minutes of the end of the show, they'd leave it at some mystery overnight parking lot (valet gestured towards the river, so not really sure) as they don't offer service past 30 minutes after the show ends. I thought this was odd - especially if MBSC wants people to head downstairs after a show for a drink and to watch the act downstairs (as they had suggested we do that evening). Our show started at 8pm on a Friday. 

The sound quality in the concert hall was perfect. Bravo to MBSC for being spot on in that important aspect of the venue. Everything was crisp and clear and it was nice not to be distracted by overly loud or unclear sound, etc. I'm a sucker for small venues where performers can more easily interact with an audience in a more intimate way. MBSC certainly offers this intimate setting. 

There are 2 menus: one for downstairs and one for upstairs. For the show I attended, we were given both menus to chose from. There are few low or mid priced options on the menu. While I will definitely see shows again at MBSC, I'm not sure that I'd eat again there, which is shame. The options are pricey and after you've already shelled out $ for tickets and parking (and likely some beers or cocktails), it'd be nice to have some low to mid priced menu options available. $12 for hummus with pita? OH LORD. $10 for a corndog? ROLLS EYES SO HARD THE EARTH STOPS TURNING $9 for fries? THOSE BETTER BE SOME SPECIAL TATERS. Part of me died paying $19 for 5 or 6 squares of ravioli. $26 for breaded walleye. ETC. They're trying for upscale/fine dining but between the service, menu and quality it didn't feel like they were pulling that off. I hope they rethink the menu and price points because I think they'd do well with a different menu and price points. With so many dining choices in downtown Cleveland the nearby neighborhoods, you've REALLY got to be on point with the food and service if you want people to return to eat before/during shows. 

We were immediately greeted upon entering the venue and told where to go (upstairs). Once we were up the stairs, someone took our tickets and someone else led us to our seats. Our waiter seemed overwhelmed and distracted the entire evening. There were instances of duplicates of orders being brought to tables, or servers now knowing where the food was supposed to go. I think a Yelp event would be good practice for MBSC to iron out some of these problems. (or to try a new menu *hint, hint*). 

I love the variety of shows they're offering and with time, the MBSC will iron out these problems. In the meantime, they still have some great acts coming to their stages and offer a nice (literally: nice) alternative to concert venues in the area."}
{"text":"The service was abysmal and the food was mediocre at best. They are not delivering on the whole supper club concept; they would do far better to rebrand as a lounge. The service is chaotic and management seems to be non existent. Clearly no one is working with these servers on basic food service skills; our server had 3 tables and took forever to come greet our table. An hour for one round of drinks, water, and apps is simply unacceptable.  The lack of mid priced food offerings is nothing short of bizarre; A) no one wants to eat duck before a show, B) especially not for $34. 

There is nothing distinctive about the menu. They would do far better to embrace a specific style of food (Cajun, BBQ, seafood) and focus on lighter less expensive fair. In a town with lots of distinctive restaurants pick something to set yourself apart.  I understand you do need a variety of offerings to satisfy as many customers as possible but embrace something unique: make your own bitters for your drinks, pickle veggies, something to stand out."}
{"text":"Would have given this a much higher rating except for what appears to be a bit of food poisoning.  Music was great. Service was OK. Drink service a bit slow. Food was C+ but ok. So here's where the problem comes in. Everyone in our party of 8 had a different appetizer / entree, we were all having different drinks. Comes to the end of the night, dessert. 4 ordered the cheese cake dessert - waiter comes back to tell us they ran out. He offer what was call Birthday Key Lime pie.  3 of us decided to go with it.  About an hour or so later everyone is home and the 3 of us ended up with vomiting and stomach pains.  Its now Monday and we talked with each and that is how this came about. The consensus is the we realize now the pie was not cold when served to us.  Great place - just be careful."}
{"text":"Good venue for a private party.  Food was pretty good actually. Great scenery right on the water.  Attentive waitstaff.  They seem to attract pretty good talent concert - wise so I will have to return to see a concert there."}
{"text":"You will love this place if you enjoy overpriced food and bad service. 

I didn't do my homework so I was surprised to see that everything on the drink list costs double what most places in Cleveland charge. I submitted to the $11 fee for 2 ounces of bourbon and I even had a second drink because I didn't want to let a few dollars ruin an evening out. 

I came straight from work so I was starving and didn't stop off to eat beforehand because, hey... supper club. Not in the mood to eat seafood (which is most of their menu), I bypassed the $40 steak and landed on a $14 cheeseburger. I expected a gourmet plating or house-made condiments or great flavor like I would get from other restaurants in this price-range. Nope. What I got was an overcooked piece of meat on a soggy bottom bun because it had been sitting in the window too long. I had to slather it with ketchup (the only condiment provided) and black pepper to make it palatable. The fries were cooked too long and in old oil so they were inedible. I was starving and ate the burger rather than hunting down the waitress who barely made her presence known. (not a martyr for the sake of writing a bad review... just f-ing hungry). I filled up on the free bread. 

I was getting ready to order a third drink toward the end of the set when a bill was plopped down in front of me. I looked over the receipt to see that each of my bourbons actually cost $12. The menu said $11. Thanks for that, Music Box."}
{"text":"Great venue to see a show.  Food was good (flatbread, butternut squash bisque, garlic herb pasta with shrimp).  Service was a bit slow but tolerable"}
{"text":"Their second floor concert was our wedding venue, and we absolutely loved it. The food was great (I need to find that risotto recipe they use, because everyone loved it! ) and the venue had such beautiful big windows and a fantastic rooftop patio. Our reception coordinator was an absolute angel who pieced everything together so perfectly and minimized all stress for us. Plus- AWESOME venue for a live band! I'd love to go to any concert here just to relive that magic atmosphere"}
{"text":"As a salsa enthusiast, I have been to Music Box numerous of times and it has always been a hoot dancing the night away. Great place to have events with a spacious stage and dance floor. The only thing I have never been a fan of is there drink service that is soo slow. I've stood there for more than 5-10 min. while other people came before me were being helped. It's also super over priced for a small plastic cup of wine. But the beautiful view of the flats probably saves them from their poor service. The back patio has an amazing view of the water, bridge, and whats happening on the other side of the lake (including FWD thats always bumpin). I continue to come here for salsa nights (maybe lack of decent salsa venues?) and I don't mind it. It's a good place for a girls night or to meet someone if your into that. Maybe venturing out and seeing other events Music Box has to offer would help!"}
{"text":"We came to a BB King Brunch as a family get together (6) and expected BB King Blues, got jazz, Motown from a very bad singer who made it all about him and his band, food was cold, buffet empty, and we didn't get water or waited on until 45 minutes after being seated and had to get our own drinks. This was the worst event we have ever been to at Music Box. This was ticketed as a BB King event not a Travis Maddix Band (TMB) Event and should have had tributes BB King and his music only. We left early and didn't even have a waiter as if everything was OK, I had to chase down a waiter to pay the bill.....at this point we are evaluating our membership with the Music Box Supper Club."}
{"text":"This restaurant needs a great improvement in its service and management.  

A friend and I went to dinner on Friday night.  The server is was aweful.  First, my friend ordered a cup of tea.  She received the tea, but no hot water to replenish her cup and had to ask for sugar three times.  I ordered a drink twice because she forgot my drink as well.  

For dinner I ordered a rib eye steak.  While I ordered it medium rare, it came raw.  Of course my server was nowhere to be found.  I grabbed the bartender as she was the only one I could find at the time.  Thank goodness for her, because she was professional and right on task.  She got another steak ordered immediately (and the steak knife I was never given).  At this point I was pretty frustrated.  The server gave me my steak but didn't even check to see if this was cooked correctly (the bartender, however did.)

At no time did a manager come to see what had happened.  I never received an apology, anything off my bill or anything complimentary.  Considering that service  was lacking and food quality is missing, I blame 1/2 my experience on a poor server and 1/2 of bad management both front and back of the house.

Also note that their drink menu is heavy on mixed drinks.  For as many steaks as they have on their menu, I would expect more options for wine by the glass.  Their only red wine option was Pinot Noir which is not bold enough for a steak.  For white wine If there is only one option as well.  I didn't see any beer options at all.

I give a 2 stars instead of 1 since the food was reasonably tasty and the bartender who did her best.

Ultimately, if you are going to charge high end prices in Cleveland I expect a high end experience.  This is far below that."}
{"text":"Music Box Supper Club west Bank in the flats. Great views overlooking the river and the all new East Bank.
The staff was very cordial we felt very welcome.
Food was outstanding and wine prices a very good value. Shamus our waiter was excellent.
We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Went to see the Dave Rawlings Machine last night.  The music was terrific but that was all. It is overcrowded and the table placements leave a lot to be desired. We tried to order food were given menus 25 minutes past after we ordered and they came to tell us the kitchen was closed. I took another. Took another 15 minutes to get the wine and water we ordered. The waitress never came back to check on us when it was time to cash out she conveniently kept the change until we asked about it.  The music box sounds like a great idea but it wasn't. Very poor service"}
{"text":"Heather is amazing along with her trainee Kate! Perfect service. The atmosphere is beautiful and the food is phenomenal!"}
{"text":"I was here for a Yelp event upstairs. Delicious appetizers and tasty cocktails were served. Being there an hour and a half, however, I only got two hors d'oeuvres.  I won't ding Music Box Supper Club on that as it might be a Yelp thing or a Music Box thing...who knows.  The bites of hummus I had were tasty, I just wish there'd been more to nibble on.  Because we were starved I hopped on Open Table and made a reservation for the Rusty Anchor downstairs which made it convenient.  Service at the bar was attentive and the views were spectacular of the east bank of the flats.  This would definitely be a cool venue for a wedding and many other types of events. Thanks for hosting the Yelpy Awards!"}
{"text":"Kate has been so fun and a great server on this fabulous evening, while we are waiting for Will Hoge to start! She had drinks on the table within minutes of arriving!"}
{"text":"I love a good show, and it's always a plus to get a meal and a show. 

The Music Box is a great, small scale venue to see an artist in an intimate setting and get the most out it. The Music Box has a list of great performers who will be coming in the near future and I think that any ticket would be a good one. We saw Pinch and Squeal, some great modern Vaudevillian artists, followed by the Dirty Bourbon River Show, a bluesy, strong band from NOLA, both of whom gave a great show. We were up front and really got the best of the grand performance.

The club is attached to the same building as the Improv and it sits just off of the river, and has both indoor and outdoor dining for whatever you'd like. They have a full bar, and a variety of drinks available.

Now...I have to say, as much as it was swanky and very impressive... I wasn't exactly impressed with the food. The menu is pricey, and for what you pay for, and you are getting the \"haute cuisine\" level here, with duck and other fine meats.
But I got a \"specialty burger\" that was a little pricey at 13 dollars. My wife got a Caprese salad at 9 dollars that was...unimpressive. I just wasn't really impressed. I am torn here because I love the atmosphere and the spectacle, but I have to say, the food wasn't my favorite. 

Parking is plentiful, and I recommend, unless you really want to park super-close, by using the main lot favored by the aquarium (it's priced a bit better,) and it's just a hop, skip and a jump to the club. 

Now, would I go again? Yes. The club is nice, and the small stage is really great. Maybe for drinks and a show, I might just \"wind up\" at the Music Box again..."}
{"text":"Beautiful setting,  horrible service...great music. the valet was mia and had to park at shooters..no bartender for 15 min...first time here...well have to try it again, but from the other reviews it seems their standard m.o.."}
{"text":"Ridiculous over priced!!! $7 for iced tea?? $15 for a Cosmo?? $7 for a glass of wine? Ok not bad right? Sure if it's a decent pour, but no!!!! this was maybe a 4 ounce pour... Don't even get me started on the food prices!!! Service was great... But prices need to come way down for this to be a place for me to repeatedly come to..  Way too many options in Cleveland and better food elsewhere..."}
{"text":"Walking in I was remembering Coconuts, and the hey day of the flats with boats on the river, people on the boardwalk and plenty of destination bars that brought the crowds.

I was very disappointed with Music Box Support Club last night.  

First the good. It is beautiful, the shell of that building looks shop worn and dated, stepping into the lobby you can see the fabulous transformation they did to the place.  No more palm trees suspended above the dance floor; two stories now with two separate venues.

The issue is clearly that they are attempting to recapture this capital investment quickly.   The band that played was Carlos Jones and the PLUS band.  On any given night you can see them for free, or if you catch them at Brothers for $5.  

Th cover was $12 and add parking and you are at $32 to walk in the door.  I don't mind paying to see a regional act for this amount, and the issues is not how good the band was, it is they are a local act and their typical price of admission is free.

Second, the drink prices were a bit high.  I have paid $7 for a Miller Light at some places, especially as beautiful as this one.  Just a couple bucks too high....

Last, the food was marginal at best.  The Mac, Lobster and Cheese had a runny sauce and very little flavor.  The Perch appetizer was dry and had more panko than perch on each piece.

So you ad up the tickets, parking, couple crummy appetizers and two beers and we are at $70 with tip.  Have paid this much to see an act at the Blue Note, but this isn't Greenwich Village, it is Cleveland and we expect much more value for the money.

Last side note, tell the bartender with the side of his head shaved its not cool to hit on someones date, just not cool..."}
{"text":"I went with a group of 16 to watch Rebels Without Applause.  We all had a great time.  Our waiter Kyle was very attentive, the beers were cold and delicious (nice selection), and the food was great.  Everyone was happy with the the food which included the brisket, perch dinner, calamari (a little too sweet for my tastes), the tempura shrimp, and a couple of salads."}
{"text":"I have been here 3 times now and all the visits have been for events in their second floor party room with a wall of windows facing the river.  I shied away from writing a review because I never had an individual experience here but I will now comment on the event aspect of the venue.  I have been here with larges groups: an awards ceremony, a corporate party with private concert, and a casino night with DJ.  All events here were total fun.  The apps being walked around on trays - classy and delicious.  The bar tenders - friendly, knowledgeable, and speedy.   Dinner and desserts - are quite good for being buffet. This is a great place to party."}
{"text":"My good friends and I had a great time at Music Box on a beautiful Saturday night. It was a magical atmosphere with the lighting and lake views with boats floating by. Seemed clean and the sound was upper notch! Our waitress, Daphne, was pleasant and attentive. So awesome!!!! Good job, lady! And the food was so flavorful and well prepared. Got the mushrooms - large- and pierogis were light. I vote Cleveland Best Burger and Fries. The only thing would like to see are some planters with pines ,grasses and flowers! My friends agree!

{"text":"Awesome food! Awesome service and great Music. 

We watched the sunset and boats passing, it was great. 

Get the truffle fries!"}
{"text":"Music Box has it all! Ended up there for a fundraiser and it was fantastic. We were in the upstairs room with the view of all views. Unfortunately it was raining but the skyline was still everything!

Full bar with the friendliest bartenders around! We were treated to h'orderves which included beef wellington, some spring rolls, chicken tenders, an assortment of cheese and fruits. Everything was great, perfectly cooked and tasty. Plenty to go around.

The room fit about 270 of us comfortably, the stage was elevated which was great because it really gives you a concert feel while your enjoying your event. Wait staff was on point with refilling drinks and things to that nature, everything was really smooth and great here.

I highly recommend booking an event or even a wedding here. It really is a gem located in the flats. Perfect 10 from me!"}
{"text":"So their happy hour is da bomb! Awesome patio to watch the boats and hang out in the flats. Also the live music during the day was really great! Some guy with an acoustic guitar jammin' out around 3pm. Felt like I was on vacation!

Then we came back for dinner. It was super crowded which we were expecting but the service was suuuuuuper slow. Once the food finally came out it was pretty cold which was a bummer. 

Lastly, was not diggin' the random polka band that played for 2 hours. But I guess they have different bands every weekend so I'll have to go back when a different group is playing.

Excited to come back here for happy hour that's for sure!"}
{"text":"Just went to The Music Box Supper Club for dinner and a show. The show we saw was the Ryan Humbert Band doing Bob Dylan songs. They were amazing and played for almost 3 hours. Before tonight I had never heard of them. The diner was also very good. I had the salmon and it was great. Check this place out for dinner or a show or both."}
{"text":"Friday night at 8 o'clock and it is time to rock at the Music Box Supper Club (MBSC) with the Martin Barre Band. My wife and I had a nice dinner at the Rusty Anchor on the first floor, see review on the Rusty Anchor, and we came upstairs to see the show. The MBSC is what you might call an intimate music hall, no matter where you sit you are close to the stage. 

The main portion of the hall had table seating, understanding that you can dine at your table before the show. Our table mates were finishing there meal as we sat down. They seemed happy with with thier dinner and said they would have the pulled pork sandwiches again. What I really liked have wait service for drinks at a concert. What a pleasure. It standing inline to get a beer and missing part of the act! Also nice to be able to run a tab while watching the show. Drink prices seemed to be on par with other entertainment venues. 

I was also surprised with the acoustic of the hall. While the band was loud the sound was clear.  The MBSC appears to have done their job in design and sound deadening, also need to give the sound mixer credit. The views to the stage were good, some parts along the walls might have some partially obstructed views due to I-beam pillar support. 

I would be glad to go back to the MBSC for another concert or try out thier Sunday Brunch with music entertainment. A nice venue with great views of the river and comfortable seating for a show."}
{"text":"Updated review:
I was impressed that management reached out to make it right after my last visit and thought, maybe they were having a bad night. We came back for the Patsy Cline brunch. Once again, awesome music--such a fun show--but food is just terrible. I got eggs Benedict and literally the eggs were hard boiled. The side of potatoes were limp and greasy and cold, like straight from the fridge, made a few days ago, cold. Everyone had cold potatoes except the girl who only ordered a side of potatoes; she got nothing. Our waitress did eventually to come back to check on us and we let her know, so she offered to bring out a new batch of potatoes and remake my eggs. The new potatoes were lukewarm now (still not hot) and I had one well poached egg and another completely over cooked one. The rest of the meals were meh. I have to say, the Bloody Mary bar was fun and tasty and affordable. Come for shows, but definitely definitely, eat somewhere else first."}
{"text":"Moving to Cleveland two years ago, I have been to the Music Box several times, notably to see Cleveland's Masterful Steely Dan Tribute Band, \"FM Project.\" In the past two weeks, we visited for Onstage Interviews--conducted by Owner-GM Mike Miller--with Actor, Comedian, Writer (Seinfeld) Marc Jaffe, and Novelist D.M.

{"text":"We've been to Music Box Supper Club 3-4 times now, so it's time for a review.

As a music venue, I'm pretty pleased. The sound is good (actually great, if you choose the right seats and band). The first couple times we succumbed to the temptation to sit right in front of the stage, but the sound is awful there, not surprisingly. Last night we saw one of our favorite bands, which we've seen in a million other places, but we chose to sit right behind the sound board. The combination of this location and the fact that the group had their own sound guy who ran the house board added up to an amazing sound.

The size of the venue is just about perfect...you can choose to be literally 5-ft away from the performance. Or you can choose to be way in the back, which will still provide a solid sound and allow you to see everything.  There really aren't any bad seats.

The menu seems to be somewhat schizo. Every time we go it's changed. Admittedly, the venue is still relatively new and maybe they're still trying to find their way. But don't count on getting an entree you liked last time.

On our last visit, our friends (who are elite beer snobs) ordered beers based on our waitress's description, but when they arrived, they both said those descriptions were highly inaccurate and they wouldn't have ordered those beers if they'd known what they were getting.

I ordered a gin and tonic, stressing that if the waitress couldn't guarantee that there'd be at least SOME alcohol in it, I'd prefer a glass of wine. \"Oh, it's ALL alcohol,\" she assured me. She lied.

My wife and I ordered the fried calamari appetizer, which had a great flavor (pretty much all garlic, but it's hard to go wrong with fried garlic anything) but the calamari was about 5% of the entree; the rest is breading. Toward the end we all rowed through the pile of breading on the plate, looking for any calamari. It tasted yummy, but they could've brought us a plate of fried breading and it would've been pretty much the same.

Last night's menu was weird. While they had the usual choices of proteins, their sides were oddly paired in just about every case. Asparagus was big last night; just about every entree came with it. Which is great, if you like asparagus. Half of our party didn't. When we asked if we could switch things up a bit, our waitress, who seemed somewhat confused by the menu herself, said they didn't allow that. What?

Our wives got the beet salad, which turned out to be a limp plate of greens surrounded by whole slices of beets and a large scoop of something no one (including our waitress) could identify. She eventually hypothesized goat cheese and, while both wives agreed that this might be the case, they also said it was the strangest goat cheese they'd ever tasted, and an all-around weird choice in that entree to begin with.

I got the half-chicken. The chicken was a fairly tiny squab, about the size as a Cornish hen. It's smothered in a creamy sauce, which is where all the flavor comes from. It was cooked pretty much to death, but since it was swimming in sauce you didn't notice much. It came with an unremarkable scoop of rice flavored with a mild horseradish. Meh.

Okay, the service. Our waitress acted like she was new, but I don't know if she was. She kept mentioning that the menu was new and she hadn't memorized anything yet, so pretty much any question necessitated a trip to the kitchen to get answers. Which was usually \"No\". She didn't have the right answers for the food, she didn't have the right answers for the beer. Maybe it was just her, I don't know.

There were a lot of waiters/waitresses. At one point my wife said, \"I think there's as many wait staff as customers here.\" And they're all milling around, checking drink levels, though they seemed to have sporadic accuracy; my wife got 3 diet Cokes in 10 minutes and finally had to tell them to stop, while my water sat empty for half the meal. With the blizzard of waitrons replenishing drinks, bringing food, taking plates, and always asking, \"How're we doing here?\" it was somewhat frenetic. There are places where having everyone checking on every table works....but this isn't one of them. MBSC is trying very hard to be upscale, and that requires a relaxing atmosphere. Instead, it's like being in a busy breakfast diner.

And finally, there seems to be an odd reservation function going on here. It's a Supper Club, right?  We bought tickets for our show well in advance, but I got an email the day before the show reminding me to make reservations. Why?  Aren't purchased tickets enough?

So, my advice to MBSC would be:

1. Reign in your chef's creativity. Less fru-fru, better food, better cooking skills. $25 for a pork chop is fine, if it's good. And asparagus for every entree?  Really?

2. Fix your reservation system. It's weird.

3. Review your staffing. Less people but better utilization. You won't be around long with that overhead."}
{"text":"Beautiful venue right on the river. Excellent place to relax and see a great show. 

Service was beyond awful. We waited 30 minutes after we sat down just for the server to come by. Multiple times throughout the night I had to get up from my table and walk over to the bar to get a drink because our server was nowhere to be found. 

Girlfriend and I both ordered the slider sampler. They came out cold and bland. Only the bbq pulled pork was edible. Would be better off going to a fast food restaurant after the show for half the price.

My advice: come for the music, get drinks at the bar, avoid the servers and the food."}
{"text":"It took almost 2 hours to get our food. They only had 1 server for our party of 22 people. Not good! Our waiter didn't really seem to have a sense of humor at all. They got our order wrong and the food was luke warm. Our appetizer was externally small and was almost $15. Crazy. And it didn't even have a lot of lobster in them. I would not recommend this place to others and I do not plan to return."}
{"text":"What a fun Sunday afternoon at the Traditional Irish Party. Food was great, beautifully presented and the service staff was very attentive. We will definitely go again."}
{"text":"This is a review for the main music hall upstairs, although I have eaten dinner there several times. I've probably been to about 10 shows here so far. This space is amazing. There's not room to dance unless you get up in the aisle, but this is one of the most intimate places to see a band. The sound system is great, you hear every word, and you're so close to your fave musicians. This is all within biking distance of my house so no need yo deal with parking. 

The beer is a bit expensive and the food is decent.
I've also been to private parties with people from out of town, and they were equally impressed with the space.  I can't say enough good things about this place."}
{"text":"Was here for the 2015 Yelpy Awards. First time in this space since it was a club. Impressive! Staff and bartenders were awesome! Drinks were good! Only got to try one hors d'oeuvres - beef tips with risotto. So good! I wish I got their earlier to sample the others. Not much to base my 5-star rating on in this visit, but experience was all positive, so it's a 5 for now. Will update when I return in the future."}
{"text":"For starters enjoying the amazing Gina Sicilia Blues Band with a riverside view... 

A combination off kayakers and rowing teams racing down the river, and large boats filled with pallets of Goodies moseying across the water....What more could a girl want, except the impeccable service of Jay Casey at the bar...

The Sesame crusted tuna is fabulouso, paired with a cute little Ecard Bourgogne rouge. Friendly staff, always smiling. 

I heard Anne E. DeChant is coming here soon, so I am already ready for a bunch of tasty and musical treats to come!"}
{"text":"First time here, we won tickets and have been dying to come try this place.

Food was AAHHHHHHHMMMMAZZZZZZINGGGG!  We had the risotto croquettes, crab cake and salad with goat cheese and strawberries. Everything paired well and tasted fabulous. Our server was Angelica and she was very attentive and friendly throughout the evening.

Enjoyed a show of Thorne tea Davis in the Supper Club with our meal. She was outstanding along with her fantastic band.

We will definitely be back soon, great way to get out on the town! A must do when in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"Saw Apollo's Fire on Saturday night. The concert was fantastic and I'd definitely see them again. The concept of the Music Box is wonderful. However if you're looking for supper at this supper club, you're going to be highly disappointed.  The food is highly overpriced but if it was prepared properly, it would be easily forgiven considering the venue. Unfortunately the options are poor and the presentation and taste are worse. My friend and I had already read the reviews and went with Flatbread and a meat and cheese platter assuming there was no way to screw up something so basic. WRONG! The Flatbread had basil thrown in the middle on only 2 of 4 slices and it was cold by the time it got to our table. Still hungry, we ordered the platter which consisted of 5 pieces of cheese, bologna slices and other random lame pieces of meat. We were disgusted. No serving utensils came with the appetizer so it was a free for all. We asked our waitress to just take it away because it was so bad. She never asked if anything was wrong, if we wanted anything else, etc. Drink orders took over 20 minutes to arrive at the table if they remembered them at all.  We had to remind our server about 2 orders because she gave them to other patrons once and forgot the 2nd time. We could tell everyone around us had issues with their orders too so it wasn't just our server or experience. 

My suggestion is eat before you go. Don't get there too early because you'll be annoyed at the lack of service, regardless how friendly and well meaning. And get yourself 2 drinks right from the start. Chances are you won't get another one."}
{"text":"Won't be open long based on tonight's experience. Waited for twenty minutes for a server once we were seated. When we finally got our drinks, the Cosmo was flavorless and my Moscow mule variation was a mojito. Then our water showed up. Pork belly and Tuna tartare appetizers were very basic and boring. Cancelled our entree orders. Nothing special on the menu but the price range is way too wide. The view of the river is great but the interior looks really cheap. I wish them luck but don't plan on them being around very long without some major changes."}
{"text":"Tried to go here to support one of the acts.  I was recently hospitalized and wanted to use my Ada parking as the businesses are legally required to provide.  There was an open space,  but when I was leaving my vehicle,  I was told I had to move or leave my keys and pay valet,  even though I parked in designated spot. I moved and still went in because of the band.  What happened next was shocking! !! I handed the cashier my card to pay my 18.50 cover and mentioned the parking issue to the kind tong man.  He said that is an independent vendor and asked if I would speak to the owner.  As a life long advocate and activist  of human rights, I agreed.  
An absolutely horrifying experie1ce! The owner was a vile vulgar excuse for a human being. I went home and prayed for his mother because she must be devastated. He said they put a sign up because they had to,  but they don't let anyone park there.  He threatened to hit me because I sounded legal.  He's just the kind of soulless cretin that literally makes one skin crawl.  He should be in jail. Violent, voltaic thug.  I wanted to call the police but I was tired and disgusted.  I suggest you do not support this business if you support basic human rights,  including the rights of persons with disabilities.  Can't imagine this could happen in this world but evil and ignorance live on.

{"text":"I recently had my wedding here and I have a hard time putting into words what a wonderful experience we had! From the start of looking at the venue over a year ago Shannon was such a nice and helpful planner. She was there to answer any Questions we had right away and make everything we wanted to happen come to fruition. On the day of the wedding the staff was so great! Everything went so smooth and was prepared exactly how we had dreamed. My guests raved about the service and the delicious food. One of the other big reasons for choosing this venue was atmosphere. The lighting, view, cleanliness, etc. are all on point. If you are considering holding an event or wedding here or even just going to see a show do not miss out on what an amazing night out you are going to have! They made our special day so perfect!"}
{"text":"Didn't eat the food, but did really enjoy the concert!  SERVICE: If servers are \"harried\" it's because they have a large space to cover and they don't want to be obtrusive.  I thought our server was great. I had a beverage within a few minutes of sitting down. Menu is limited upstairs, didn't see but would imagine it has more options in the downstairs dining. People next to us liked their food and had no complaints. VENUE: The place has a high ceiling and is squarish in design, so I was very skeptical about the sound.  We saw polyphonic spree there, which has a ton of band members an everything right down to the harp was crisp and balanced.  It IS a supper club, and spree was probably not the best band to see there.  I imagine jazz, blues, folk, and generally mello ambiance music will all play well there, but if you want to jump around and dance in a mosh pit, this is not your place."}
{"text":"Never quite had such a negative experience with the service in any transactional setting, let alone a music venue/restaurant. There is one undeniable truth: If you don't want to be in the service industry, find another line of F'ing work. People come out to restaurants, concert venues, etc. in their spare time and on their own dime to have a good experience and not to deal with staff that have an attitude. As I'm reading all the posts here, just about every negative post mentions the poor service so there you have it.

I had basically a confrontation/come to Jesus moment with our server. He was very rude to my fiancee and me. I don't understand how you can sign up to do this job and do it with a scowl on your face (the entire time), say nothing, and be an overall gigantic self important douche.  I told him he was ruining the evening for us and making the whole experience very awkward.

The manager came over and offered to change servers, letting me know this guy (Judd, idk, don't care to know what his actual name was) has actually received many compliments from other customers. My @ss, he's either blackmailing you for a job, or you're trying to tell us that actually, WE are the @sshole customers.

How about people will take their business to a place with a good atmosphere that actually enriches their weekend experience, not the opposite. I've worked in the restaurant industry, and I've also been a server. I've had customers I can't stand, but if I copped an attitude with every customer I'd probably be in jail by now, certainly fired.

Needless to say, not coming back after this. I give major props when it's due (check my review history) but I always keep it 100, and I refuse to accept this wave of pompous entitlement that customers don't matter. Too bad, actually seemed like a great venue and would have been an otherwise great evening."}
{"text":"Lies and Slander after my former matter resolved. 
After my previous review and communication with the Owner, Collen, I thought the matter was closed. (see previous review and update) Now, i see that another person from Music Box has decided to blatantly lie and say that we got physical with the manager, Mitch, who verbally accosted us. This will not stand. I have asked for camera footage to be pulled because in no way was there anything \"thrown in the managers face\" at any point. For the matter to be resolved, then for them to come back days later and tell a bold faced lie lets me know exactly what type of establishment this is and I will spread the work now near and far. I had actually come back to update the review with accurate information after speaking with their personnel. I see what help that did now that they come back with lies and slander."}
{"text":"Music Box was having a sale where tickets were only $10 so I snagged some for a Griffin House concert on a Monday night. We pulled in and expected to pay for parking but no attendant was there so free parking! Our venue was upstairs and since we got in about 40 minutes before the start of the show we had an excellent choice for seating even with a crowd already starting to form front and center. The space looks great! Intimate feel to the place and I love all the windows with a view right next to the river. 

The servers were nice and they would try to duck out of the way so as not to interrupt your concert experience too much. I also enjoyed the manager stopping by to make sure everything was okay. As for food I got this shrimp and grits bowl that was a bit salty, but still enjoyable for the most part. My friend went with a salad that they said was okay. Prices are a bit high here though; we're talking $12 for a beer outside Bud Light. 

Overall, really enjoyed the space and the music, just think the food and drink were \"meh\". I'd definitely hit this place up again as I think it would be excellent for a night out during the week, just maybe get a tastier dinner elsewhere beforehand or bring your suggar daddy to pay for drinks."}
{"text":"Went to this place for a conference and then went fpr a blues show at night after the conference ended. This place has a gorgeous view and the service was nice. I ordered the short rib tacos which were awesome. They also happy to do substitutions which is great since I have dietary restrictions."}
{"text":"I was in Ohio and a musician I like was having a show at music box. I was skeptical about going to a show in Cleveland because the last venue I went to in the area was super shady. When I drove into the neighborhood I was pleasantly surprised. It was actually a pretty area located on the water and I didn't feel unsafe at all. It was a little confusing getting to the venue. I couldn't see a sign anywhere and I accidentally went to the cabaret club at first so beware. Once I got inside the venue I was impressed by how pretty it was. It has a view of the water and its big inside. Make sure you purchase your ticket in advance if sitting in the front is important to you. The tables in the back looked way too far from the stage for my taste. The seating is a little awkward. You sit at tables with strangers so it's like going to a restaurant and sitting with random people. What I liked the most was the waitress never pressured me into ordering anything. They did not charge a food and drink minimum on top of the ticket price (I hate that!). The acoustics were good. I would come back if I'm ever in Cleveland and someone I like is performing."}
{"text":"Went here for a large corporate event. The space, decor and setup is really cool! You can look out over the flats which at night the water is really beautiful. For warm months they have an outdoor section as well. The food was good! The only reason I took a star off was that several of the bartenders were turds. Not very friendly and deliberately ignoring a bunch of us. The waitstaff, especially downstairs was extremely nice though. I would go back to hear different bands play for sure."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in this restaurant. Went before a show at Jacobs Pavillion. After we were seated took 15 minutes for anyone to come to the table to even give us water. Waitress then says \" did anyone come over yet ?\" when we said no she said  \"well I guess I'll take you then\". We barely saw her. She took our order, never came back to ask if we wanted more drinks. When we asked for bread she never brought it. It took 40 minutes to get our food. Food was ok. Nothing great but not bad. Very over priced. Drinks were watered down and pricey. I don't recommend this location for dinner. Not sure how the shows there are, but not great for just dinner, especially before a show at NO.  We barely made it to the 8:00 show and we got seated at 6:20."}
{"text":"if you actually want to, oh I don't know, eat supper and hear music other than what you paid for, sure. in 3 hours I never once had a server take my order. I must have been invisible. I had to order all my drinks from the bar and miss part of my show while they got  more boozer from the basement. HeeHaw crappy country music was downstairs was drowning out the music I actually paid for. Came to eat, left hungry. Way understaffed. Some manager type person came offering me stuff way after it was too late. I didn't come for free food, I'll pay for it myself. Amazingly disappointed even tho the band's perfmance was amazing. No thanks to Music Box. I'll never see another show here no matter than band. Severely dissapointed. Not even worth the time I spent in traffic to attend. If you bar is set low, go for it. Cleveland has far better venues. Someone needs to clean house and start over. yeah. extremely disappointed I gave them my money."}
{"text":"I can't vouch for the food...we ate up the hill at Luca's prior to watching The Del McCoury Band last Friday night.

But server, Kate?  She's a gem.  Kept us all well-hydrated all night long.

{"text":"Exceptional service that went above and beyond. Our server Heather was extremely helpful with all our questions about the menu. Everything was well prepared and served within an appropriate period of time. I will definitely visit again in the future. Thank you Music Box!"}

We were greeted by Shannon our hostess, she was very friendly and made us feel very  comfortable! Our waitress was a great girl named Angelica!! Super nice and very helpful about menu items and beers!  
Food was terrific and we loved the show!
The staff made us feel very welcome and they where fun!   I can't wait to come back and we will ask for Angelica! Shannon knows how to make a guest feel at home
See ya soon! Nancy &Mickey Masterson"}
{"text":"Great concert venue with great sound. But as for a restaurant it falls short because it's over priced for what you get and most of the time the service is rather lacking."}
{"text":"I'M going to hell in a bucket but at least I'm enjoying the ride. OH SORRY I will stop singing.

This is one of my top spots to catch live music. They have an upstairs which is a bit larger and has an open space for dancing, there have been a quite a few top acts, Macy Gray and 10,000 Maniacs, Carlos Jones to name a few. The downstairs is more of a sit down and chill to some music vibe and access to their awesome patio. 

I really like the vibe of this place and it sports amazing views of the Flats, and Cuyahoga river.

They have a pretty nice menu, I have never eaten here, but my friends have all enjoyed the food. They have a full bar, and cocktails are reasonably priced. They definately do not gouge you like a couple other downtown venues do, cough cough HOB.

Music Box has what i judge to have excellent management. The employees really do there best to treat people right. Let me tell you a story:

I was here for a concert with who is now a very ex friend of mine. We got to the show pretty late. We had very good seats but one of our seats was already taken, they sat someone in it already. Not, the end of the world, right. They moved our party into comparable seats maybe even better, but one of us had to sit at another table, but close by.My ex friend asked to speak to the manager then she started to berate and scream at her saying how you do this, swearing at her. I Took her to the side and pretty much told her to shut  up. I then apologized to the manager for my ex friends behavior and said hey I understand we were late not a huge deal. The manager then said you know what your drinks are on the house and she gave us I think at least 100 dollars in gift cards. That tells the caliber   of people that run MBSC. I mean if someone would have spoken to me that way I would have tossed their asses  out and never let them  come back. And on a side note people that abuse people in the service industry are usually lousy human beings.

Thank you Music Box for doing what you do and making DT CLE that much more awesome."}
{"text":"I reviewed the MBSC last summer attending a show and ordering dinner off the menu, well I came back to MBSC for a blues event and ordered off the menu once again...This time our food was better and experience was more satisfying...My partner and I ordered off the appetizers menu, one large meatball over a corn meal cake and fried mushrooms....as we waited for our food we ordered wine, a Coppola Cabarnet.....which was very tasty and didn't disappoint.....the food came out, meatball was a bit undersize for $9, but the taste was delicious, and sauce and corn cake that accompanied the plate was very good.....the fried mushrooms were the star however, $8 the mushrooms were huge!! and to add to that they were dipped in a beer batter dip - outstanding!!! probably would not order the meatball again, but mushrooms and wine together were excellent and watching our favorite bluesman Toronzo Cannon just made the night a memorable one...Get over to the MBSC for food and a show, some of the best national blues acts and talent in the country at affordable prices....."}
{"text":"GOOD - NOT A FAN YET; BUT WILLING TO GO AGAIN AND SEE HOW IT GOES.

Grabbed Big John from work yesterday and took him down to the Music Box Supper Club on the west bank of the Flats.  We arrived and went through the parking lot and I almost fell into a man-hole that did not have a cover.  

Thank goodness Big John was quick and saved me from falling about 4 feet.  We found the owner/manager and told him about it and he told us the city was working there today.  He found an orange barrel to put in the hole so no one else would fall into it.

He told several other people about it - they were standing around talking about it while we waited in line to be seated.  Reservations were made through a site - sorry; can't recall the name - and they changed our date from the 1st to the 8th, but never emailed me about this.

It seemed he was not very concerned that one of his patrons almost fell into a man-hole.  He never asked if I was ok or anything.  That bothered me.

We were so upset after these two things happening - Big John asked if I wanted to go home.  Decided to stay and were \"squeezed\" into bar seating.  

Storyteller was supposed to be about Elliot Ness and turns out it was My Town with Michael Stanley.  Not my favorite person.  Again; Big John asked if I wanted to leave.

It became a mission for me at this point.  We got the $20.00 per person Prix Fix meal and a side bowl of Lobster Bisque.  The bisque was good - but not typical.  It was very cheesy and had one small piece of lobster in it.  It came with a puffed pastry on top.  Good - but again; not typical.

Jay the bartender was THE BEST part of our evening.  Answering every question and very knowledgeable about the supper club, upcoming events, etc.

Meal was  a salad - very very good.  Roasted pork with mashed potato's and gravy.  The vegetable was frozen not fresh and it was corn and peas.  Also included was a slice of apple pie with ice cream.  For the $20.00 - the soup was $9.00.

John's tap beer was $6.00 for the first one and the other two were $9.50 each.  Asked a female bartender about the change in price and she was clueless.  She said she thinks the first price was wrong - someone found the mistake and fixed it for drinks/beers #2 & #3.  OK - WHATEVER.....

My whiskey and coke was $6.00 a drink - for all three.  Michael Stanley talked for 1  1/2 hours; took questions and pictures.  Enjoyable show - I was surprised.  

Owner walked by and told us about the orange barrel and thanked us for bringing it to his attention.  Grabbed a quick photo op with Stanley after he was leaving.

Food was good - meat was tender.  Jay the bartender was very good and the female - Chrissy, Christine or something like that - was ok.

Young man that replaced or took the place of Jay - didn't get his name.  Dark hair... was a butthole.  Yelled twice for no reason - like a drunk at a concert and I just about jumped out of my skin.  I called to him twice for another drink and he never heard me.  (If you know me.... WHO DOESN'T HEAR ME WHEN I TALK)????!!!!!  Really?????

Going back tomorrow, Friday for the Sausage Fest - sound like fun.  Flyer was funny - my boys had quite a time with that....     Put on your thinking caps and pretend you're a 20 year old with a \"sausage\" fest and the hottest sausage on cold nights flier in front of you.....   :o)  They make me laugh....!!!!!

Different dinners for the special through-out the month.  Called the \"general reservation line\" three times; but never got a call back.  Was a little confusing at to how things work.  It's not a smooth running place yet - seems like they are new and working out some bugs.  

Wednesday nights shows are free in the Supper Club - Upstairs you pay for your ticket for the show/concert.  You do not have to purchase food or drink on the free show/story teller nights.  Up stairs has a lighter menu we were told.
So many \"things that bothered me\" - problems.... We almost left several times, but I do recommend this place - get your information & double and triple check before heading out."}
{"text":"This was a truly unforgettable night of music accompanied by a truly forgettable dinner. \"Fresh fruit\" means dried fruit at the Supper Club. The fifteen dollar cheese plate was desperate for a grape. And a cheese knife. There were no vegetarian options available and the Caesar salad was eight dollars worth of run of the mill. Now, be it known I went for music, not supper. But as a consummate diner, I was happy to sample new fare. The happiness did not last. The place was crisp albeit boring in decor. Service was great considering it was pitch black and super loud. Bathroom was nice. Classy digs in a sort of a Target classy kind of way. I just think if one puts \"supper\" in the name one ought serve up something a little more palatable then a hunk of bad cheese with Big Lots crackers and five dried berries.

{"text":"This is a good venue for music, but I was extremely disappointed by the food that was served.  In fact, everyone at our table of 12 were dissapointed. The calamari was bone dry, the hamburgers people had to pour ketchup on them in order to swallow, the lobster bisque tasted more like tomato soup without a hint of lobster in it! When we received our check we were insulted by the high cost of such inferior food.  If you're going to hear music here, eat before you go! Sorry, Music Box...you can do better."}
{"text":"Great place to see a band up close, saw an great Ozzy tribute band & the music was awesome! That being said...eat elsewhere 1st! Limited food selection for sure & my shredded chicken lasagna was actually ground up chicken with tons of thick, non-tasty sauce, only ate 1/2 at most & forced myself to do that since I knew I would be drinking. Cheesecake was good & our waiter Shawn was excellent! Bottom line: great music & great staff, food not so much, beer good but limited draft selections & kind of pricey. Would give 5 for music & staff, 2 for food(only because of the cheesecake otherwise it would be a 1!) & 3 for beer selection, figure that evens out to 3.j"}
{"text":"The sound and views in this place are fabulous - among my favorite in Cleveland. However, the table arrangements need some work. It always seems so crowded, and if you are sitting closer to the stage it seems like an obstacle course when you have to get up to go to the bar or the bathroom. We've been here twice, and the first time our service was - not the best, to put it lightly. They use iPads to take orders, which seemed to be the source of the problem. Their computer system went down, which led to us waiting at least 20 minutes before someone even came over to take our drink orders. Once someone did, it took him forever to find whatever we ordered on the iPad. Like, it was awkward how many times we had to point to what we wanted on the menu.

We ended up having a mix-up with a bottle of wine (apparently he couldn't find the one we wanted on the iPad, so brought us another bottle that was like $20 more) and with a cocktail (my sister's BF ordered a whiskey drink, and what he got was some sort of sugary vodka creation).  Both situations were remedied, but the whole process just seemed to take forever.

The second time we came a few days before St. Patrick's Day to see the Portersharks (best Irish music in town, people!) and service was much better, especially considering how crowded it was. 

Still: I was claustrophobic in my seat, knowing that if I tilted my head back I'd probably conk the person sitting behind me. Also: the food is fine, but definitely overpriced. The flatbreads aren't that big or filling for what you pay, and $12 for hummus is just ridiculous. I would recommend just eating before or after a show, if you can."}
{"text":"I am only giving it one start because they won't let me go less.  Drinks are over priced as well as the food.  Plus the general attitude of the place is not friendly and welcoming.  I am very sad and disappointed!"}
{"text":"I was very excited to see a new music venue open in CLE to compete w HOB. The Music Box has already booked great acts, so they are filling a void for blues, folk, alt country, etc in town.
Upon arriving, I had to pay $8 to self-park because there are no other options at this location. I ordered the ravioli for $19 and got 5 ravioli! No side salad, no veggie, just 5 ravioli. It should be moved to the appetizer menu and not with the entrees. The food was ok, but a very low value. Until the menu changes, I will not be eating here again. $9 for fries?! If it were not for the music, my main reason for going, I'd give 1 star. So onto the music. The show I attended was in the super club(? downstairs stage). It is a seated venue so no chance to stand up and get rowdy. Sound was great. Lighting was great. Beer selection was above average. $6 for Dortmunder draft is to be expected at a venue like this.
I am curious if the venue adds a few dollars to the cost of merch though. At the show I attended the album was $25 at the merch table but $20 on the artist's website. Hmmm.
3 stars is generous, but I'm optimistic they'll figure this food thing out and this place will become viable stop for national touring acts.
Come on Music Box! I'm rooting for you, but you gotta do better."}
{"text":"Capable of being a whole lot better and more consistent is this new upscale concert venue.  An ambitious venture that should be supported and encouraged by the surrounding communities.

We have seen 2 shows here, in addition to having our wedding brunch in what has since been converted to the downstairs supper club.  This is the year to figure out what is working and what is not, so we must be patient with them as they adjust to what could be a fabulous success. We want them very much to succeed. 

That said, I have my issues.  Poor communication, inexperience, and inconsistency are fixable only when open to criticism.  Being able to accept and learn from mistakes are key to successful ventures that have a wonderful plan for entertainment, but this group may be new to whole house reservation dining and large groups. Staffing, buying, and service execution are critical to maintaining happy repeat customers and sustainable profit margins.  The restaurant and music production businesses are both cruel to the unseasoned.  Let's hope this group can manage both.

Overall staffing, execution, and food quality were accomplished and even exceeded expectations on our wedding brunch afternoon.  I thought the day went so well I didn't give it another thought and praised the Music Box to anyone who would listen.

Then I found out what really happened on a couple of fronts with regard to our guests.  One was actually confrontational between a bartender and close friend of ours.  There was breach of contract, in that we ended up not having a quality draught beer available, due to the bar running out of it the evening prior.  This problem was categorically ignored.  Bartenders even proclaimed someone was running for cases of the product and that it would be available when it arrived.  

I reached out on several occasions to have some closure on the obvious oversights during our fairly expensive event.  When the draught beer offering was unavailable for our event, leaving only poor choices remaining, our planner was not made aware.  Our guests were left to believe we have poor taste in choosing decent products for them.  The beer in question was named in the contract, and no replacement of equal quality was offered or even discussed with us.  It was not only ignored, but bartenders were not briefed on what to do in the event it or something similar was requested. They came up with excuse above on their own I was told.  Additionally a dessert selection that we requested was at least replaced with an inferior selection.  This was likely a post negotiation expense adjustment, also with no briefing for planner or payer.  These facts we were unable to ascertain until the following day.  I asked for no compensation, and only communication.  I have been given no response to date, nothing since late April.  I guess they beat me.  Don't let them beat you.  I suppose it is a choice when running a business and looking to control costs, that these folks will just not give you things requested and throw up their hands saying \"everything went great! we did everything you asked.\"  Everything but a few things we specifically requested, agreed upon, and paid for, but did not get or have any explanation or adjustment to compensate.

The cost of this review for a perhaps less than $200 in beer and food costs.  That's poor mathematics and business practices if Yelp means anything.  In a weird way I get it.  I wouldn't want to give attention to minor details when I have so many other important things going on preparing for events during Rock Hall induction week.  But I asked for explanations well after the event and followed up more than a month later.  No response.  Nothing.  I hate writing bad reviews."}
{"text":"We were here to see Arlo Guthrie in the upstairs room.  Our previous visit had been downstairs and I think we agree that the acoustics are better upstairs.  We didn't eat, just had drinks.   Although service was great, the drinks were small for the price.   

The tables are very close together so if you are claustrophobic this may not be the place for you.  I would suggest ordering tickets as early as possible and try to sit up front because otherwise people block your view (I am short so this is always a problem).

I wish I could see concerts and not have the people around me ruin the event.   This is not a problem for the Supper Club, just a comment to Yelp readers.   I paid $75 to hear Arlo sing, not people around me.   This is not a karaoke bar.  Why did YOU pay $75 if all you were going to do is talk to your friend the ENTIRE concert.  This is not the only venue I have encountered this issue.   Why can't people just enjoy the music?"}
{"text":"My husband and I wanted to stop in and grab a quick drink and listen to the band before catching the water taxi back to the East side of the Flats.

Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"I have never felt more unwanted in my life. This place needs to get its act together. On top of the terrible business model (selling and giving away tix without guarantee of seats), the terrible service (lukewarm treatment at every point of contact to people dying to spend money on dinner but unable to because they had oversold tables, and lack of attention to the (surprised at being) standing-room-only patrons who had been promised seats once the no-shows came apparent but were ignored despite empty tables throughout), the food is terrible. Truly."}
{"text":"Music Box is the place to take family, go on a first date, or have a girls night. I can't even begin to tell you how much I adore this place. As a music snob, I go to A LOT of concerts, and this place makes the cut. Both floors are venues, and sometimes even at the same time, nestled against the sparkling river and lit Flats East Bank cityscape. 

Music Box is my favorite place to go when I have no plans, and is a go-to dependable evening out when I have friends come to town. For a show, I'd usually thoroughly pre-investigate a Spotify, but at Music Box, even if I don't know the artist, I don't worry about it. I trust them that much.

-Sound & Artistry: From a technical standpoint, the sound quality is incredible. The infrastructure supports very clear, vibrating sounds. When I saw Howie Day upstairs, I was completely paralyzed by how phenomenal he sounded. It is so refreshing to finally have a place that does acoustic singer-songwriter justice.

-Talent: MBSC has an incredible booking agent who schedules the most diverse music schedules ever. Ranging from local bands, to relatively unknowns, to bigger names and world music, they are a completely inclusive venue. Sign up for their newsletter.

-Food: The food is quality for a venue like this. Downstairs features a full restaurant, Rusty Anchor, while upstairs features more bar food. If you know you're seeing a show downstairs (your ticket will say), make sure you make your reservation in advance. If you're downstairs, plan for great seafood. If you're upstairs, try for flatbreads and burgers."}
{"text":"Went here twice over my Christmas Vacation to Cleveland. And how I wish this place was here when I lived here. The views are crazy good of downtown and the river. I can't imagine how it could be in the Summer, sitting on the deck. Heard from folks you can see the Cleveland 4th of July fireworks from top deck!! We saw a show in the upstairs concert hall Saturday before Xams and sound was amazing. I had the pork osso buco DAMN great stuff, my daughter had the sliders, she LOVED them, my son (Burger Aficionado) had and thought it was FANTASTIC. Our second visit was Friday in the downstairs club what a Great VIBE this room has, again great sound and views. This time I had the chopped salad with Salmon. OMG the Salmon was to die for, and the salad was caked with blue cheese, Heaven!! My daughter had the black bean and veggie burger, very tasty, son tried the sliders. The service was great both nights, and the atmosphere was very cool. I highly recommend checking this place out if your a music lover and will definitely visit again next time I am in town!!"}
{"text":"Been to many shows here now.  Servers are usually pretty good.  A tad slow but navigating through the seating arrangement and crowd can be a pain in the ass and they do OK.  The bartenders have always been slow and zero personality.  No excuse.  The food tastes microwaved and the beer is expensive as hell.  The Irish brunches used to be better than they are now.  Lame choice of bands and the cover band shows they have all seem like a great idea but WAY overpriced.  My advice, drink and eat before the show.  Have a few while your band is on and get your sleeze on at Christies next door after.   Over the years I have met Michael Stanley and Geraldo there so, that's pretty mackin'..."}

{"text":"Really disappointed in the place. I booked a Mother's Day brunch buffet reservation through Open Table, which was advertised on the website as a Mother's Day concert event with Patsy Cline. There was nothing on the calendar the day I booked the reservation indicating the brunch and concert as a package-only reservation, so I went ahead and booked reservation for a regular brunch. Nothing prompted me otherwise. Today I get a voicemail from Shannon at MBSC with a tone of annoyance in her message sternly letting me know she has made several attempts at reaching me to confirm said reservation (my mailbox had been full but i did not know until someone else told me this morning). She went on to say that the show is sold out and in order to keep brunch reservation i need to have tickets to concert, and if i don't call back to confirm ticket purchase she will cancel brunch reservation. Now I'm left with no reservations and everywhere else is booked. Website needs to state this requirement in their calendar and also communicate their policy with Open Table. I don't appreciate the way this was handled and I will never give them my business."}
{"text":"I wasn't sure what to expect when I bought 2 concert tickets for this venue.  This place is awesome!  The sound was fabulous, our seats were fantastic, and the service was equally amazing.  It was special to see an artist that I love up close and personal and have options for a full dinner and drink menu.  It was a unique experience.  I signed up for their emails and received 2 free tickets for doing so.  They send an email a few times a week letting you know about what events they are having and what artists are coming. Parking was only $5 at shooters but you could park on the east bank of the flats and take the free water taxi over if you wanted!"}
{"text":"Entertainment is good, the food....well, not so much.
We have been to the supper club twice. Once to see a local artist ( we paid a cover) and once to listen to one of the talks that they host. 
The first time my wife ordered the Walleye. What came was a whitefish, but not walleye. It was tasty, so my wife was ok with it. I ordered the Fried Perch. What I got was mostly breading, and the fish inside very sparse. It was overdone, and I referred to it as fish jerky. The breading was a dark brown, just not quite burnt. 
The second time, we ordered the Prix Fixe ($20) meal. It was beef pot roast, served with a scoop of potatoes and mixed veggies that were obviously in from Birdseye or the like. The soup could have been good, but suffered from being cold. Similarly, the food on the plates were cold in spots. The beef was served on a hard garlic toast that was hard to cut though with a knife. The beef, itself, was tender, moist and tasty. We also noticed that prix Fixe plates being delivered to other tables had gravy on the Mashed potatoes. Hmm. The 
The dessert was a little cup with a brownie, some ice cream product and some whipped stuff. It would have been ok if the brownie didn't seem burnt and stale at the same time.
The drink prices were, as my wife put it, a little \"gougy\". $8.50 for a locally brewed White Raja is a bit out there as was the $12.50 coffee with Kalua. 
The entertainment is great. The service is ok. The venue itself is great. My recommendation would be to eat elsewhere, however, and attend the show, and maybe get an appetizer."}
{"text":"Oh, Music Box, you continue to confound me overall, but as a concert venue, you're beginning to beguile me. This might be my favorite place in town to catch a show. It's intimate, the setting is wonderful, they keep bringing in great acts, the audio is brilliant, and somehow the acoustics are really good despite a lot of hard surfaces and odd angles. Drink service during this last show was absolutely perfect. A heavy five stars for the Music Box... 

It's the Supper Club part that still has some work to do. On the plus side, the service is improving, particularly upstairs (where it could hardly get worse from last time I was there). Downstairs, they're really trying, but still making some missteps. I noticed three tables having to ask servers about specials and someone tried to give us the wrong food, but there was real progress over my opening week visit, and service issues in the dining room were minor and corrected quickly.

The food itself is still uneven, punctuated by some real bright spots and some mystifying misses. We started with a really nuanced chilled soup special and their curried skewered shrimp. The soup was great, with crème fraiche and delicate jalapenos working in concert (see what I did there!?), but the shrimp had some issues. They were perfectly cooked inside, but they went downhill from there. For starters, they weren't deveined, and despite being completely battered, they still had on their tails (far less of an issue than the veins). Most disappointingly, they were in dire need of salt. This was unfortunately a recurring issue. 

Having enjoyed the perch on my prior visit, I gave the walleye entree a shot. Once again, the fish was cooked exactly right - flaky, sweet and moist. Once again, it needed salt to be fully enjoyed. My husband's shortrib was tender and flavorful, and on a nice bed of creamy mashed potatoes. While not as underseasoned as my fish, it too needed a pop of salt. Our veggies - beautiful asparagus spears for both - were woefully overcooked and also crying out for sodium. The food isn't BAD, and the kitchen has a really deft touch with seafood so there is clearly talent back there, but it's vexing that they make so many simple mistakes. 

Honestly, I wouldn't nitpick if so many dishes were not well north of $20 or even $30 apiece. If you're going to charge that, it'd better be perfect, and the supper club side is still far from perfect. All that said, they deserve a boost because it's a music club, and a really good one.

A strong five stars for the music, and a tepid two stars for the food. I hope the food keeps improving and I hope the club keeps bringing in top talent and putting on great shows."}
{"text":"Had a good time with another couple at the music box. Will try it again because I like the idea of it. The location is great and looks like a summer spot with views of the river and east bank. 

The food was just ok. The dinners were pricey for the flavor. Good portions tho. The appetizers were good and worth it. 

I didn't pay too much attention to the band but they were ok. I've seen better but for only a few dollars it was fine. 

So, I hope they improve the food and offer a few different price points for when we just want a snack or small bites during a show."}
{"text":"Beautiful venue! Great views on the water, nice dance floor and perfect atmosphere (classic but not stuffy). As others have said, the service was slow and disorganized, so I hope they get their act together. Drinks are pricey, but I think that's typical for a music venue. Will be back!"}
{"text":"WOW, what a truly GREAT Cleveland venue for live music AND good food!  I've been wanting to come here for a while now, and I was not in the least dissapointed!  The 'Music Box Supper Club' is without question, one of the BEST live music venues in Northeast Ohio!  We recently saw the great veteran Aussie rock band 'The Church' there, with some good friends, and a fantastic time was had by all!  The place is clean and classy, with bars and restaurants downstairs and upstairs.  The acoustics were top notch, the food very tasty, and the service was very professional.  And what a great waterfront view with huge windows by the bar!  Also, parking was plentiful in the fairly large supervised parking lot outside.  Lastly, we appreciated that 'all ages' were allowed, so we could bring our budding music fan daughter with us!  Mega kudos to the owners and staff of this superb place-- we will be returning soon!"}
{"text":"Recently attended an event here and found it to be perfectly lovely. The wall of windows revealing a great river/city view was really great. I didn't have any food, so I can only speak to the venue. I thought it was very chic, fresh, and elegant. Would be a nice place to hold events."}
{"text":"incredible food, incredible views, incredible music. i will definitely be back. classy and clean environment."}
{"text":"Great Venue, but the food is just average.

Cheese tray appetizer had 4 small crudités and low end cheese cubes(Swiss, hot pepper, and cheddar) a red pepper olive relish and some salami meat choices for $16

Steak and potato soup was more of a stew than a soup it had a good flavor but only one chunk of meat in the soup. 

Salad which was billed as romaine, blue cheese, bacon and cauliflower was a huge disappointment.  the bacon pieces were so small so I believe it was the pre cooked stuff you get not freshly cooked bacon. The blue cheese was asking so finely sprinkled it was hard to taste and the cauliflower was non existent. The dressing was good but salad very lackluster and boring. 

Prime rib was good very moist and flavorful, asparagus was a little limp but tasted good as did mashed potatoes.

While we did not get a dessert our friends did and commented that the death by chocolate parfait was inedible. Said it was the worst dessert they had ever had. Tasted like yogurt. They were very disappointed.

All in all a nice night out with friends. Just know you are going for the entertainment not the food."}
{"text":"This place is a really cool place to see a show I saw Macy Gray there and is absolutely amazing. The sound levels are perfect. Not over blaring like some other places in town. 

The food was good but it was a little bit overpriced for what you got. I guess for such a small venue you Tessa try to make some money somewhere"}
{"text":"Finally a place that makes Cleveland (the city-scape that is) look good from the inside. At night, on the river, away from the weather, you can see a good live music and have a nice meal. The concept of this place is great. So needless to say, we found a show that interested us and bought the tickets. Looking at the schedule, they seem to have an eclectic approach to the music they bring, which I think is really great. After reading some reviews, we chose not to eat there because of the price point. After spending $40 for the two of us to go to the show, I do not want to overpay for food either. We did take a look at the menu and a lot of the offerings seemed intriguing but again for the price of the plates without any first course, I was glad to see we declined. Venue is layed out perfectly and incorporates best of both worlds with assigned seating or just general admission. I was happy to see the water on the tables too, because the service left a lot to be desired. Had to ask multiple times for drinks and it seemed like they were out of a lot of things on their list. I hope this place sticks around because, with a few improvements, it would be a perfect spot to bring out-of-towners or just a group of friends to enjoy the city."}
{"text":"Attended the Patsy Cline brunch. Terrific music, far exceeded expectations. Food was good not great, perfectly acceptable. Good service, fun atmosphere. Would definitely return for the music."}
{"text":"This is Clevelands hidden gem! I went for Sunday Brunch and I will definitely be back. The performer was doing Frank Sinatra covers and he was amazing. 
We sat at the bar as we did not reserve a table, I suggest reserving a table or get there early to avoid disappointment. The service was great and bar tenders were really friendly. 
The $18 buffet was great, a good selection of sweet and savory breakfast foods. 

Come for the music stay for the waffles."}
{"text":"For shows, you need to not only buy tickets but also make reservations - otherwise they will force you to sit alone at random tables. It did not say this online and after several tries, no one answered in the box office all week. Poor customer service and general model for shows."}
{"text":"Picture a man, wrapped in the ermine and gold of a king. A man with badass God-like powers, such as lead into gold, horses into gold, necromancy, basketball, lycanthropy, self-confidence, birds into gold, Wolverine's bones, etc.

Picture a woman, painted in the greases and powders one would expect a warrioress of such obvious prowess to be greased and powdered in. An extraordinarily powerful Valkyrie in all but name, resplendent in white and standing at least eight feet tall. At least. 

Picture a music issuing forth. Music from the breath and hearts of ten thousand seraphim. Scores of carnivorous birds are released from cages from seemingly everywhere, their wings flapping in time with the bombastic symphony that you, to your delirious surprise, realize has been generating from inside your own mind this whole time. 

Picture a feast, with piles of glitzy meat and sweetbreads. There are sweaty corns and honeyed everything. The wine flows. The undulating crowd is worked into a frenzy, sluggish at first, but soon they take to the exercise. Clothes are shed, as the heavily lathered revelers begin to regress, or perhaps evolve, into their natural states. Yodels and jibbers, hoots and warbles fill the air. One lady accidently takes flight and sores out the open window.

And then the reception began. 

My childhood friend got married to his beautiful wife at Music Box this weekend. The event was fantastic and couldn't have been done anywhere else."}
{"text":"Great place for music, but they gouge on prices. We saw a tribute band there for my wife's 40th birthday. Tried to coordinate a cake. Three weeks, three phone calls with a chef, $40 upcharge on our bill for a 1/4 sheet cake from the local grocery store. Also, mixed drinks were $15 a pop. The walleye was phenom, the nasty attitude from the hostess was not. With a party of ten, they literally jammed us in backed up to another table. Had to ask the manager before we got a reasonable answer on moving our table.  Not coming back."}
{"text":"First time here and we loved it. We went for the brunch and to hear the The Diamond Project. For sure make reservations for the brunch. The food was great, I ate enough for the next two days.  Service was great. Drinks is where the wait staff makes money but the drinks are pretty expensive. Would go back for sure next we want to try dinner next. We had a lovely time.."}
{"text":"I looked this place up online after hearing about it.  The bands looked like bands I would like, and I researched them.  I liked their sound, and I was pretty excited to check this place out.  The place itself is gorgeous.  It is right beside the water in the flats.  You can watch large shipping boats pass by--it's the mix of industrial and art that gives such aesthetically pleasing element.  

I went with a friend and was pleased with everything I saw.  We went to the actual restaurant, The Rusty Anchor.  This amazing swing/blues/jazz band was playing, and I adored their sound.  As a matter of fact, I hope to see them play this summer.  Bummer I was listening to this band at this venue.

I went with a friend, and we both ordered drinks.  The drinks took a very long time to get back to us.  We felt ignored.  We decided to leave during an intermission.  When we couldn't find the waiter since he was no where in sight for most of the night, in frustration, we went to the bar to ask for our check.  The bartender told us our waiter had our check.  He then proceeded to ignore us.  Our check finally came, and we left pretty annoyed.  

I really want to like this place.  Too bad it's going to be a while until I go back.  The bands are amazing.  The atmosphere is relaxing.  The people who work there?  Ruins everything.   I crave seeing those views from their large windows overlooking the water while listening to Cole Porter songs.  This place has a lot of potential."}
{"text":"What a great place. Tons of atmosphere. Great pizza from Dennis the chef. The entertainment is really good and very fairly priced. We love it."}
{"text":"I would have rated five stars if just for the river view and music but the food and service are too disappointing. No server was taking care of us until 20 min we sat down. I ordered flatbread and the bread was hard as stone! And there are hardly any toppings! I was very disappointed by the food."}
{"text":"(Posting on Yelp and Trip Advisor too)

Thoroughly bamboozled by the obvious misdirection of information by this place. 

Purchased tickets only for the show with no interest in eating here. The only advisement prior to ordering tickets online was that seating was General admission. 

So we thought since seating was General admission we would arrive at a reasonably early time: 1 hour before the band started. 

Arrived early and we were advised that since we didn't have a dinner reservation we would have to be seated in the back private dining room. Zero direct view of the band as a result. Lots of open tables with a good view available at that time. 

The manager advised us that people who come to dinner without tickets would be asked to move. When pressed to give us one of those tables he said he would check. 

He came back with a different story. He told us everyone is required to purchase a ticket with a dinner reservation. He had no resolution or attempt.to compensate us other than a refund if we left. 

A second table near us experienced the same thing. 

Horrible, unprofessional and certainly a place we will never come back to. 

Tell everyone you know about this scam."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in the follow through from Christina, regarding private events. She had the Bride's budget, head count and expectations and Christina said it was 'doable'. Many emails were sent, several phone calls made... and she didn't reply for a week and a half. Finally, one of the bridesmaids contacted her and she quoted a price that is easily THREE TIMES higher than the budget that was discussed. I will not be recommending them to future brides or hosts.

I was really excited to try this venue personally, but after this initial impression, I think I'll wait until they get their ducks in a row."}
{"text":"We went for a Thursday night show upstairs in the larger room. It was the Ohio Showcase for the inductions at the Rock Hall week. The room was nice and not a bad seat in the house. That's the best I've got.

Our service was awful. Others around us seem to be having the same issue. We didn't have food, only drinks. It took 20 minutes for the waitress to come over. After that, another 15 for our drinks to arrive. When we were both finished, someone else took our glasses, but not our order. Another 15 minutes for our waitress to appear. I ordered 1 more drink at 9:10p. She came over with it at 9:40p after I had gone searching for her or anyone to help. The show was almost over. I declined the drink and we asked for our check. It took so long to even pay! I was very agitated.

I want this to be a place I can go, but with other great venues in town for live music, they'd really need to step it up. A lot."}
{"text":"I attended the Happy Hour Concert last night to see Cleveland legend, Alex Bevan re-start the old WMMS Coffee Break Concert series.  Alex was great as usual, our food was good, nothing fancy: open face roast beef sandwich with gravy and mashed potatoes and chocolate sundae dessert.  Everyone was very friendly and our wait staff was attentive and friendly.  My complaint is that a bus tour group joined the restaurant a little after the show began and clearly had not come to listen to the show.  They talked loudly throughout the evening and, while I don't blame them, the management should have anticipated the disruption this group caused.  I'm sure its a good money maker but it completely ruined what would have otherwise been an enjoyable evening.  Live and learn."}
{"text":"Dinner Review of Rusty Anchor

This place is located just to the north of the water taxi (free for 2017) dock so it was a quick trip here from the East Bank of the Flats. 

The patio along the water had umbrellas, though with the evening angle of the sun they weren't 100% helpful. The interior space was just as nice as the garage doors to the patio were opened. You could hear the live music (a solo guitarist on the patio) no matter where you sat. (Some may view that as a bad thing; he wasn't the best and he kept telling sad romance stories).

Service was fine, but nothing stellar. At one point incorrect food was delivered to our table, then taken away and given right to another customer. That other customer was gracious - I would have sent the food away after it had been sat down in front of someone else.

The patio did have a small assembly line cart for make your own pizza. For dinner I tried the story fry and I added chicken. While pricy, the chicken was substantial and grilled well. The stir fry had carrots, mushrooms and broccoli and was served with soy sauce over brown rice. It was good, but not worth $22. 

The speciality cocktails are $15. I ordered one which was a huge disappointment not to mention it was served at the wrong temperature. Stick to the large beer menu....  

Stick to the east bank...."}
{"text":"Two stars because it was Sinatra night and the singer was fantastic. As far as everything else goes, service was deplorable, took an hour to order and then 45 minutes later when I asked a manager about it I was told it would be another ten minutes. He offered to comp the food if we didn't like it. Not once was a curseword uttered or was my voice raised the entire time we spoke. Upon leaving we were told by this manager that he had \"taken enough abuse\" and he also told my family to never come back. They failed to execute on every front from start to finish, except the singer. I am amazed they are still in business."}
{"text":"We had a party of 8 that got tickets 6 weeks ago and we arrived over an hour and a half early to get a good table as we were told when buying tickets that there were no reserved seats for this show (dueling pianos) . Arrived and the place was almost empty - about 8 other people. Got a horrible table and asked for a better table. 
Manager DAVE was disrespectful and basically a complete asshole. Refused to say why we couldn't move to any of the other 8-10 better \"8 top\" tables available. Just said \"sorry pal - nothing I can do\" and refused to offer any explanation. 
Service for dinner: just ok. Not awful. 
Food: a tiny bit above average. Salmon a bit overcooked and dry, but ok. 

UPSHOT: arrived 90 minutes early when the place was almost empty and got shitty seats in the back for a show with no reserved seats. That deserves 1 star. 

Unlikely to go back, and will share this with everyone I know. 

Thanks Dave, for the exact opposite of an acceptable level of customer service."}
{"text":"I ventured back for The Boys From County Hell show..
I would advise people to stay away. But if you do go, check your bill closely. My friend and I had seperate bills. She ordered one drink. Her drink was also charged to my bill, while my three beers were also charged to her bill.
This also happened to us during the Wren Boys Festival. Other friends at hour table that day reported being charged for drinks they did not order.
A friend, his wife, and sister-in-law drove up from Columbus to attend a show, and ordered 3 shots of tequila. They were charged for the 3 shots, plus $100 extra for a whole bottle of tequila.
These overcharged happen too frequently to be chance. Combined with the overly high beer prices ($9.25 for a tall Dortmunder which can be had for less than half that price just down the street), it is enough that we won't spend any more money there.
I only rated it one star because I couldn't give a zero star rating."}
{"text":"So just as I thought everyone had moved on, Music Box tells a blatant lie about something being thrown. Luckily I have receipts from the email chain of them addressing us. People are welcome to highlight the passage where something being thrown was mentioned.  I apologize if the chain is out of order. I would also like to add, that after sharing proof that they are making up a story about someone throwing something into their manager's face, he edited the review to embellish upon his lie. I'm assuming to make it sound more plausible. However, it's funny that the edit comes AFTER the bride, incensed that after our horrible treatment, they would then spread lies on the internet, sent an email asking all the who/what/when/why in regards to this completely fabricated event. Suddenly, it was a crumpled name card. Mitch yelled at my friend to \"Get the F*ck\" out prior to us even finding out proof that a reservation had even been made, and still, we calmly asked for refunds. We have multiple eye witnesses, and it's ridiculous that an establishment would go out of their way to apologize, offer passes, and ask that we forgive, then go on to try and defame us. As surreal and ridiculous as this all seems, it actually better comports to our treatment on the evening in question."}
{"text":"Went to the Sunday buffet, and it was excellent at a good price.  Good breakfast foods, fruits and breads.  The bar had a custom Bloody Mary for $10.  As always, the pianist and singer were very good and entertaining. This is a wonderful venue with a variety of local talent.  We are becoming regulars!"}
{"text":"Checking out the sold out Prince Experience  front row right by the stage. This venue has a lot of tribute bands that really looking forward to checking out.  We had  the chance to eat prior to the show. Limited menu and yet so quick yummy. Several bowl options  also salads and soups and chili and dessert bowls."}
{"text":"GET the f*ck OUT! A terrible service night went even more horribly wrong. MBSC staff don't care about its patrons - particularly women. It isn't a safe place.

My maid of honor planned a bachelorette party for me (the bride) and about 15-20 other women. We are all in our 30s and up were planning on having a classy evening. After paying $10 for admission, I asked about our reservation. I was told reservations weren't taken and to ask someone else who might know. The maid of honor asked that person (the promoter) and they didn't know anything either. I told the manager at the podium that it didn't make sense he was at the podium and didn't know anything about how to handle this reservation. He walked away from me toward the maid of honor and the promoter for the salsa dancing event and I could hear her ask who she should talk to about figuring out where this table reservation was. I could see she wasn't getting any answers (The simple answer would have been - not sure about this reservation, but let me help you get a table.) However, that is not the route either man took. I thought I could solve the problem as the bride by saying - let's go in anyway, don't worry about the table reservation. And I walked in which is apparently when the manager told my friend, 'to get the f*ck out' She followed me into the club and apparently the manager charged after her. That is when a second friend from my party asked the manager to let it go and that she gets it let's not make it a thing. The manager's response to my other friend who is trying to diffuse the situation is to get right up in her face and tell her 'she can get the f*ck out too'

Meanwhile, I actually locate tables with 'reserved' plates and one with my name written on it. I show it to the MOH and she walks over to the podium and puts the reservation on it and walks away. Then I learn how this manager has spoken to my friends and I let everyone know we are leaving and we walk out together to get our money back. 

To her credit, the owner Colleen addressed me in what I will refer to as the foyer area and I explained her staff spoke in a manner that is unacceptable to my friends and all we want to do is leave and get our money back. Another friend tells her plainly what was said to the girls 'to get the f*ck out' and Colleen tells the cashier to give us our money back.

I'm not writing this review because of this bad experience even though that would be enough. Let me explain:

Subsequently, Colleen has had email correspondence with the women who were told to 'get the f*ck out' and both the manager and Colleen has apologized (said she would address the anger issues with the staff member) and offered free tickets. While I will never step a foot back into this establishment, I told Colleen that she has addressed the situation appropriately and proportionally to what occurred. 

I'm writing this review because someone from Music Box Supper Club has posted lies about this event. He has stated the the situation escalated as a result of the manager getting something thrown in his face. (sidenote - When I saw this post, I emailed Colleen to ask why this is the first I'm hearing about this being the cause of the problem and I ask several questions. For example, what was thrown and when it was thrown? After this email got sent, the post by Music Box Supper Club was altered to say the item thrown was the reservation card.)

This a HUGE lie and a way to blame the victim and I will not stand for this. So let me be very clear about the content of this review:

- Rather than admit the manager lost his cool and used profanity and aggression to address two women much smaller than him and just chalk it up to a HUGE mistake - Music Box Supper Club has blamed my friends for throwing something to incite the manager. This didn't happen. This is a bold faced lie without any evidence and multiple witnesses (and let's see the video tape!) who can report this didn't occur. 

1. If we had the reservation card during the time the manager was arguing about its existence, it would have been proof of the reservation and hence no need for him to argue that my friend was wrong about the reservation. 

2. I found the reservation card after the manager yelled at my friends. (see from narrative of events above)

- What also should be noted is that I am white and my two friends who got told 'get the f*ck out' are black. It is now obvious to me that while Colleen tried to apologize and make this matter right, her staff found a way to continue the same childish and disrespectful behavior they showed the night of the event. They are lying about what occurred and trying to make it look like the fault of the victims. This is completely unacceptable.

Music Box Supper Club is not a safe place. It isn't safe for women. It isn't safe for black people. It isn't safe for anyone because the staff have no problem lying and screaming profanity to express themselves."}
{"text":"I've been to the Music Box Supper Club for several different shows (both at the Concert Hall and the Rusty Anchor) and have enjoyed the experiences. The place isn't perfect, but I'd have no hesitations about coming back. 

The highlights of Music Box include the views, the musicians, and the food. The views of the riverfront are gorgeous and there's plenty of outdoor seating downstairs. I like that there's a good rotation of musicians and musical styles, and there are enough bigger names to keep me coming. The food has been excellent for all but one of my visits. On my second visit (Concert Hall), everything I had was either bland or not the right temperature, but I've had no problems with the food any other time. It's tasty and there's a good variety to the menu. 

Unfortunately, the venue isn't perfect and could use some minor tweaks. The seating in the Concert Hall is kind of a nightmare depending on the location of your seats. I know it's a music venue and they want to cram in as many bodies as possible both to make for a great crowd and to make money, but they could really reexamine how the tables are arranged. During my last visit, my server had to tap me on the shoulder three times to ask me to tap the shoulder of the patron in front of me so she could get his attention. While it wasn't overly obnoxious and wasn't at all her fault (again, the table set up), it was during the performance and therefore did detract from my enjoyment of the show just a little bit. 

Additionally, the price of the cocktails...yikes. I know a place like this has to make its money on food and drinks, but I will never again order a cocktail here! My thirteen dollar cocktail was served in a teensy little glass and was not worth the price. Stick to the beer!

Despite this few detractors, my experiences at this venue have been great and I look forward to returning for more great shows."}
