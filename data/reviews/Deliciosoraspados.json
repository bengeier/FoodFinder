{"text":"Excelent service, clean, and the treats are amazing. I usually have the Diablito, which is like a spicy mango raspado. The escamocha is also one of my favorites. It's mixed fruit with sweet cream, BUT not too sweet."}
{"text":"So far everything I've tried here is good. The corn in a cup is delicious. They have Sonoran style hot dogs and tortas too. The fresh lemonade is really good. The diablitos are a mix of ice, fruit, tamarindo, and lime. Really good on hot days or when you're craving something spicy. They also have a good selection of ice cream."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have been driving past this great place for years and we finally decided to stop in. We had samples of the pineapple & coconut ice cream and the mint chocolate chip and they were delightful.  we've been back ever since"}
{"text":"Mmm...mmmm!!! I just got back from Mexico and have been having cravings for a raspado. I live near deliciosoraspados so decided to come give it a try. I was pleasantly surprised how clean this place was. I got a pineapple and coconut raspado and my boyfriend got a mango strawberry and banana milkshake. Everything was so fresh and delicious!! Definitely will be back  the only downfall was it took a little to long overall good find!!"}
{"text":"Went in search of raspadas and found this place that offeded \"Raspados\". Cautiously, we entered and read the menu. I desided to order a large Mango raspado $5.55 and a small Fresa (strawberry) raspado $3.55. My Mango raspado had small chuncks of Mango throughout the entire cup. The Fresa also had strawberries throughout, I was so pleasantly surprized with both of them. The Fresa was for my Grandson, children appear to really like strawberries.  This place also offers Thrifty icecream and other food items, I really didn't pay much attention I was too busy enjoying my Mango Raspado! I'm a big time fan of this place and will be back soon. The owner Rigo told us his establishment has been in operation for three years. Why didn't anybody tell me."}
{"text":"Growing up in Mexico raspados were a typical summer treat. I lived in a small town and we bought our raspados from whatever neighborhood lady took in the entrepreneurial spirit that summer and decided to make some extra money by selling them out of her home. The raspados of my childhood involved shaved ice with syrup. They were simple but delicious.   Now raspados have evolved into a delicious combination of shaved ice and anything you can top it off with. I have been pretty skeptical of this new(er) trend and have continued to order a good old fashioned raspado in those rare occasions that I have one.  I went into this shop and bought a medium sized (that made Starbuck's Venti size look ridiculous for something other than the name) Diablito. The Diablito is a delicious combination of shaved ice, mango syrup, mango slices, chamoy, different types of tamarindo candy and what is known in Mexico as Japanese peanuts.   Well, my dear yelpers, I am changed woman. I will never look at a traditional raspado with the same eyes. I had an experience that made me pull over on the side of the road after I started driving just so I could eat it and not place other drivers in harms way. That's how freaking good this raspado was. You have to try it!   Aside from the raspados they also tortas and other food items but I did not have any or pay much attention to that portion of the menu, I will definitely be back soon to try another Diablito and some of the food they have to offer."}
{"text":"Hell yeah.  Delicious.  Strawberry Mango and Pineapple Coconut respados.  They also have a nice selection of ice creams and other snacks"}
