{"text":"The menu has an interesting and appealing variety of food. I had the salmon lentil entry and my wife had the Cesar salad with salmon. Both were excellent. We topped off the meal with the sacher chocolate cake and coffee. Both again were excellent. I would be very happy to return even though you pay a little extra for the good quality of food. The one major concern I have is when we started down the cafeteria style line to pick out our food we had a lot of difficulty finding a clean tray. We went through 10-15 trays to find two that were clean. When we notified the person at the entrance to the restaurant she sorted through the trays to pull out the dirty ones and pulled out another 10-15 trays. They were obviously dirty with full circle coffee stains, drilled sauce across 1/3 of the tray. So it was obvious that they were not cleaning them and after they were used they just put them at the start of the line. This to me is unacceptable especially during flu and cold season. Management still needs to oversee the work and assure it is being done. We ate on a Sunday evening so the restaurant was not overly busy. I would also note that we did not have to place our order twice as noted in another review. The greeter was very polite and asked if they could answer any questions, we then proceeded down the cafeteria line, picked out our food and paid at the end of the line."}
{"text":"The food was just okay and won't go back. The management has no sense of urgency, the gentlemen in the black and Brown shirt. I asked them to check the Dr Pepper cause it was flat, and he said he will get right to it. He stood and talked to fellow employees and never fixed the issue. I had to ask again, unacceptable. Went there for dinner 3/11.  It was never fixed til I left and he said it was out of CO2."}
{"text":"Ugh!!  I have been to La Madeleine across the country, and this one is NOT GOOD.  The food is maybe 3 star, but the service is terrible.  Maybe it is starting troubles, but they really need to hire better staff, and more staff.  There was a guy standing literally at the door, handing out the menu and taking orders.  Okay fine, a little annoying but okay.  Then he directed us to the counter.  Once there, we had to wait several minutes before we were attended to at the salad bar.  It wasn't busy, there was literally no server at the salad bar!!  Then there was a weird shuffle, where 2 or 3 servers came and left, and then finally one stuck around to serve us.  But she had not received our orders.  So we started talking to her like she had our orders, and she kept looking at us like we were stupid.  Finally we realized she had no idea what we were ordering, and we started from the beginning.  15 minutes into the cafe, we finally were able to place our orders - process that typically has taken me less than 2 minutes in every other La Madeleine.  Why bother intercepting customers at the door with a menu and a notepad when you are not even going to pass on the order to your servers. They were out of brown bread, and in the one hour we spent at the cafe, it was not refilled.  Not going back there again!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious, services was somehow slow. Very slow in fact, given that there were so many workers. It felt like  most of their cashiers are new. The ice coffee is not good, but the lemonade is delicious and tasted fresh."}
{"text":"Very nice ambience and fair prices. The entre was delicious but the sides were cold. Will try again since other five friends raved about their meals."}
{"text":"So far I've been there twice. I had the chicken parisien and my son had the  croque monsieur sandwich. We also had cups of the onion soup and the potato soup. All of it was very tasty! The ordering process is a little confusing, though they do have two lines for eating in and take out. When you order in, some items are made already and others you order and they give you a buzzer. That process took some time for people to figure out as they moved down the line. 

This morning I stopped by to get a few pastries. They only had one person who was handing the takeout line and that took a long time due to the coffee orders. Hopefully in time some of these issues will be resolved or they hire more staff."}
{"text":"We previously came here for their soft opening event, so this was our first experience after the full opening. We ordered different things from the opening event, and this time the food fell below expectations. I ordered the chicken la madeleine and my wife had the sampler with the chicken friand, cream of mushroom soup, and caesar salad. My wife's plate was good, the friand was very flavorful and the cream of mushroom soup was as good as it was at the opening event - probably my favorite item here. I would not recommend the chicken la madeleine entree. I figured it would be good since it's their namesake item, but the chicken was small and dry and the broccoli was undercooked by a few minutes. The chicken felt like an overcooked piece of fish, crumbling off with a fork and with no moisture left inside. My wife commented that it seemed like it was microwaved (and poorly at that). The service line is a bit confusing but the friendly staff does a good job of getting you through it. The bread and desserts are the star attractions - I'll definitely return for those, but may avoid chicken dishes if I have a meal here."}
{"text":"Fantastic coffee and sweet treats. A dangerous place for a diet. Yet my tummy loves it. Can't  air to go back"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE.....Ordered american breakfast and an Omelette, both orders the eggs were cold, my wife ordered a cafe latte and she never got it, even after asking the server about it, she asked for her money back and they didn't apologize or offer to make it up to her somehow. The take out bakery service was also well below par. One server making coffee drinks and taking bakery orders to go, stood in line for 13 minuted behind 2 other customers who were only getting drinks. Here is a suggestion, have 2 people working the to go, one for drinks, one for baked goods. And my final point, with at least 12 people working the floor how can an order be cold???? Well we can check this place off the list of repeat visits, time to look for a new breakfast spot in Chandler."}
{"text":"First visit was several days ago.  Atmosphere good, not excellent because music was too loud in the main dining area.  Food was excellent !!  Service was striving to be excellent. Everyone was very attentive and helpful.  The only major complaint is that workers who were on break sat in the side dining room with us and were conversing rather loudly. (Hopefully, the workers have their own break room and will use it in the future). 
All in all, I would highly recommend this restaurant for it's food and service."}
{"text":"First of all, this review gets 4 stars for noon and afternoon dining and 5 stars in the AM! I love getting the Apple Turnovers, but you should definitely get them in the morning when they are freshly baked and still warm and gooey. Later on in the day, they are kind of stale and not as good. But other than pastries, I love their salads for lunch and nothing beats a nice morning quiche. But I definitely suggest this place for a nice breakfast or early brunch spot."}
{"text":"Mediocre is a word that really should never be used for a restaurant.  I remember La Madeline when they were on 24th st and Callback, and we could not wait to visit them for the great food they had. Sadly this no more,  this location serves old, wilted and cold food that shames this namesake. Acceptable are glasses with water spots, a bread case with no bread, complimentary or not, and items not available at certain times of day. Disappointing when even the manager does not care if a customer will come back or not."}
{"text":"I found this place by chance.  I was driving to the mall and always come off the 101 side.  I happen to be coming from the west and saw it.  I made a U turn and went in.  I tried a couple of their tarts.  I ordered the lemon and chocolate tarts to go.  I got home put them in the fridge for a hour before I was able to eat them.  The chocolate one was good.  The lemon was fantastic.  The whip cream was nice and soft not hard like it was in a cooler over night.  
This trip we decided for breakfast.  I had the quiche with ham.  It was pretty good.  I wish it had more ham in it though.  The croissants are yummy too.  Everything seem to be fresh.  What a great place.  I will be back again to try a different quiche.  I will ask I can pay for more ham or bacon in the quiche."}
{"text":"Oh where do I start?

Upon entering there was a line so our first reaction was \"must be good\". Hopes we're soon dashed. 

It was soon evident that the back-up was due to their system of the hostess taking everyone's order on a tablet before they got to the cafeteria style counter. Part of the problem was that many people didn't yet know the what they wanted because the menu is posted on the wall behind the counter. As a result, until the hostess handed them one... which (like us) they now needed to study, it held up the line further. This caused people who knew what they wanted to jump ahead of the hostess, only to discover that they couldn't order AT the counter. Much confusion and some upset voices heard.

After patiently waiting our turn, we ordered the Basque Chicken & Rice bowl and a cup of French Onion soup. Our first clue should have been the soup ladled out of a big pot followed by the question whether we wanted toast and cheese. Sorry, but if you have a CUP of French Onion soup on the menu for $4.49, it should come out of the kitchen properly prepared with crouton and melted cheese. I realize this isn't a fine dining restaurant, but since we had to wait for our Basque Chicken & Rice bowl the soup could have come out at the same time... otherwise it's just what we got, mediocre brown broth with onions.

As for the Basque Chicken & Rice bowl, when it arrived at our table, the chicken was warm to the touch and the rice underneath, only a few degrees above room temperature. By touch alone, I seriously doubt that anything on our plate met health code standards for proper serving temperature. 

I promptly returned to the counter and explained the problem. The staffer I spoke to apologized and said they'd take care of it. Within a couple minutes I was brought a new order of the Basque Chicken & Rice bowl. Before returning to the table, I touched the chicken and rice. Much to my dismay, it suffered from the same lukewarm chicken and even less-warm rice. I asked for a refund and to speak to a manager. 

Within a minute the manager came over and I explained the problem. He acknowledged they were having some \"issues\" in the kitchen that day and did the right thing by offering to refund my money as well as replace our meal at no charge. 

We got our money back and left without a replacement for fear of eating food that had not been properly prepared, or heated to the correct temperature.

Most of all, here's the kicker... San Tan Marketplace offers a number of dining choices. La Madeleine is a cafeteria style, order at the counter establishment, with tables close together, lots of people moving around, chaotic and NOISY. Our order for the inedible food above totaled $14.48 plus tax (cheerfully refunded).

When we left, we walked about 100 yards to Brio Tuscan Grille, where we enjoyed a hassle-free, relaxing, 45 minutes with personalized table service, a beautiful, less noisy environment, and a fulfilling, delicious, PROFESSIONALLY prepared lunch of an incredible Wedge salad and Milanese chicken over angel hair pasta, plus free crusty bread and rustic crackers.... for a total of only $18.70 plus tax. 

Meal time is meant to be pleasurable, not stressful. Do yourself a favor and eschew the current trend of convenient cafeteria style fast food establishments and spend just a bit more time and money to truly enjoy the where you are eating, what you are eating and the people you're eating it with."}
{"text":"I was so excited to see this place open. I used to love it at Scottsdale fashion square and was sorry to see it go. So when I saw this new one I was stoked. Ehhh not so much. Food was mediocre and forgettable. If you want to go French! GO FRENCH!"}
{"text":"My favorite dish was not as good as usual and the coconut cake was a tad on the soggy side."}
{"text":"Cute new cafe in San Tan Village. I came in during opening week and they were pretty slow still and had the AC down way too low. Greeted at the door, friendly service that was happy to answer questions we had about the menu. Lots of choices on the menu, all French themed. I got the chicken salad sandwich and caesar salad. Loved the sandwich - so tasty on a fresh croissant!! The salad was so so. Under $9 for sandwich and a side salad. Hope to come back and try their desserts and other menu items. Would recommend!"}
{"text":"So happy this place just opened up. We went for dinner on a Sunday night and it was relatively slow. They are open till 10pm! Yay!

I had been to a location en EP so I knew what to expect. The rest of my party had never been so it took them a little while to decide what they wanted. 

I decided to do the half sandwich and half soup. I went for the tomato soup with the chicken parisien sandwich. UMMM WOW, I was blown away. The sandwich was SO GOOD! The soup was also very yummy and I loved that it wasn't too tangy. 

We also got a large bowl of the potato soup and ummm I've had better. The soup was so watered down and I found myself pouring a bunch of pepper to give it some flavor. Skip this. 

I spent about about $18 for a large potato soup, a small drink, and a half sandwich half soup combo. Employees could've been friendlier. I walked by a few and no one said hi. 

The fruit tarte is also delicious and the presentation is so cute. I will definitely be back again for a latte and dessert. 

There were a ton of tables inside and it's pretty big!"}
{"text":"Absolutely incredible lunch and experience. Ordered the tomato soup and potato soup and both were delicious. My husband ordered the French dip and I got a cheesy pasta. Can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"Went here for takeout lunch today for the first time. The food was superb. The tomato soup was absolutely delicious, I would put it on par with Nordstrom cafe. My sandwich was neatly packaged with hot and cold ingredients packed separately. When I arrived after placing my order online, I wet to the to-go aisle and was promptly served.  Out in less than 3 minutes. I look forward to dining in and trying new dishes."}
{"text":"I had visited La Madeleine many years ago when I lived in Dallas, Texas and always enjoyed the food so I was intrigued when I saw that this one was now open. My friend and I both received emails for a complimentary cup of soup or small salad just for joining their email list. I had the onion soup which I thoroughly enjoyed (the best onion soup I've had in recent memory) and my friend had the lentil soup with kale which she thoroughly enjoyed. We both purchased salty mini-baguettes which were so warm and yummy with lovely crusts and REAL butter.
Each of us tried a dessert, mine was a mini seasonal fruit tart which was wonderful. Also, both of us made additional purchases to take with us before leaving, mine included a mini lemon tart and a mini chocolate tart. The staff was very helpful and attentive. We are looking forward to our next visit."}
{"text":"This is undeniably the worst dining experience we have ever had.  I ordered the Croque Monsieur.  It was kept under a warming light and therefore the sandwich was cold and tough.  The ham was burned on the edges, the cheese was dry and chewy, the bread was tough so that I needed a knife to cut it and what I presume was egg on the top was scrambled and dry. Who would ever think that Croque Monsieur could be pre-made. The caesar salad was simply romaine with a couple of croutons and a smidgen of dressing.  My husband's turkey and brie sandwich had to be hand made so it arrived 10 minutes later.  The turkey was  plain deli turkey (nothing special) and included maybe a teaspoon of brie. Presentation was stark; nothing else on the plate but chips. Being polite, I waited until his meal arrived before I started eating ( but make no mistake, my sandwich was cold from the start - I did try it.) The noise level is extremely loud and it is like eating in a cafeteria.  The price was cheap and that may be why it was busy; however, I would rather eat in McDonald's than here."}
{"text":"I saw this restaurant driving on Chandler Blvd and had been wanting to stop in. Since I had the day off on 3/2/18, I decided to give it a try.  I came here with my wife and one of my friends. We ordered a wide variety of items.

The Country French Breakfast was okay. The Cinnamon Croissant French Toast was pretty good. In my opinion, I have had better croissants and pastries at other cafes around town.  The price range is more on the higher side. I would probably stick with the pasta and sandwiches if I come back.  Their specialty jam was also pretty good.  Overall, it was good and experience was alright. 

Skip the Chocolate Tart and the Lemon Tart and get yourself a Crème Brûlée or the Crème Brûlée Cheesecake!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately I wanted to love this place but did not have a first good visit. I ordered a salad that came in two containers, it was pretty much half a bag of spinach with a light sprinkle of strawberries and a little bacon, a couple of sliced mushrooms all swimming in boring spinach. The dressing tasted store bought, nothing special. They forgot my chicken so I called to have it removed from bill and they wanted me to drive back 20 min to get it refunded on card. I didn't have time so I paid for a chicken salad but never got any chicken nor a refund. They offered me to go back for another salad but I'm not close by so it's not conviniente for me.

I ordered 3 pastries and they were all like what you get at Costco, nothing special. I also ordered a French Onion soup, it tasted like dirty water. :( The cheese on the salad was meant for the soup but it was so little that I put on the salad for added taste. 

Just drive a couple more minutes and go to Cheesecake or Wildflower for a real meal. 

I don't like leaving bad reviews but I really didn't enjoy anything that I purchased and just felt like my $24 bill was just a waste."}
{"text":"This restaurant has management issues. We bought three cookies before we left and after we left, we realized we never got change back for our purchase. We called the restaurant to ask about the change and the manager said he'd let us know after the day to see if they had our change. We received a phone call at 12:04 AM telling us they don't have our change. No apology or sympathy even though we did not receive our money. The manager should not have called a customer past midnight and should have waited till the next day, as any smart person would do. We understand the restaurant is new, but there have been many flaws throughout our visits."}
{"text":"I just had an awesome experience here for an early lunch! I had my hands full with my 9 month old daughter. A sweet employee, Crystal, went out of her way to make my visit stress free. She carried my tray of food to the table and grabbed a high chair for me, which I truly appreciated! The food was delicious, and my daughter especially enjoyed the tomato basil soup! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I tried the French dip sandwich and it was pretty good. I also had the creme brûlée which was delicious, one of the best I ever had. Prices are reasonable. The decor makes you feel like you are in some European cafe. I ordered it and someone brought it to my table. Customer service was great. I'll definitely come back and try their chicken and mushroom pastry item."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time today, honestly, it was pretty average. The way you order is very confusing for people who have never been there. The food was not very good, my friend ordered a sandwich that we had to pick up in \"the line\" and it had been sitting out under a heat lamp. The soup was bland. It just felt confusing and meh."}
{"text":"Recently discovered this little gem in the San Tan Village center, and I've already been here twice today! The food is delicious, authentic, and unbelievably reasonably priced. Additionally, the second time I came in was closer to closing, and the staff was more than accommodating and friendly, even though I was being *one of those* customers coming in at closing. It suffices to say, I hope this place is here to stay, as I will be a regular. Kudos to the staff and chefs for a great experience!"}
{"text":"Didn't sit and eat got desserts and pastries and coffee to go. Really cute place, nice people working there and the goodies were pretty darn good. Especially the croissants. Those were delish! The coffee was good, not as strong as I like but I'm not everyone lol.  If I'm on that side of town again I'd definitely try the other food"}
{"text":"Just ate there today for the first time. Loved the quiche florentine, and the everything on the dessert counter. I will definitely be going back"}
{"text":"Food is very good and croissants were perfect and flaky. The ambiance is so nice with a lot fireplace in the middle of the restaurant. Definitely a place to head for breakfast."}
{"text":"Caveat, they have been open one week. I should have known better but this was my lesson, learn from it. I was in a hurry I went to La Madeleine for a to go order. I did not preorder, but I parked in the 15 min parking spot. I went to the left to order and asked is the right place to order for takeaway, confirmed yes. The line on the right was very long. I ordered the Cafe Sampler, Quiche, Half Salad and side salad thinking it shouldn't take long. As I stand their waiting many people have made their way through the dine in line and the to go line. I have never seen so many employees in one small shop. With that being said 25 minutes have passed, I pull out my receipt to see when I ordered. I walk up to ask about my order and ask if I am Carol (nope). She was the lady who ordered 5-7 Mins after me. Appears that my order was bypassed and only because I walked up did they proceed to get it completed. I hear the employee say to the other she was first, but it appears there is no order or process used to confirm when orders come in for takeaway. I can see them clearing orders for dine in on the computer, but this takeaway process appears to be a free for all. So another five minutes goes by and I finally get my order. I think they gave me a full quiche to make up for the delay but who knows. Lack of communication was definitely an issue between team members today. In the end the quiche was good, the salad was not memorable and the pasta salad was tasty, but for 30 mins I could have gone and eaten there or somewhere else and had a better experience. I really hope they get this process working more efficiently and look at order slips to see the timing. I work near here but if I take my food to go I need it to be fast and easy."}
{"text":"So there was much hype in my office when this place opened up so I had to try it.  It was cold outside and thought country potato soup and an apple turnover would be good.  Man I should have just gone to safe way for the soup and grabbed some chips.  

Overall the soup was just meh.  Definitely not worth the time I spent waiting for it.  Now I'm not complaining about the service because they were working. I just needed to be patient because of the orders in front of me.  That being said there is so many employees wandering around my initial impression is when there are 4 or more orders waiting for take out why can't someone help get them out.
Anyway back to the soup.  Overall the taste was meh, easily forgetable.  
The apple turnover was good but again not worth the wait.  To be fair the taste could have been ruined by the potato soup. The apple turnover actually gave them an extra star.
I can see myself going back for more deserts.  They did look good in the case.  As of now good luck with parking. The lot was full."}
{"text":"Admittedly I am a croissant snob. I've traveled to Europe many times and have tasted the best :) I have to say the almond croissant at la Madeline is fantastic. It's light and fluffy on the inside and has that little crunch of flaky goodness on the outside. I now find myself going there a few times a week just for these amazing almond croissants. I tried the raspberry one as well and it was way too sweet and didn't have the beautiful texture as the almond. The quiche is super good as well!"}
{"text":"This was my first time at La Medeleine and the wait wasnt too long. The food very good. I liked the atmosphere. There was a bit of an issue with the order not all coming out at one time for both of us and the manager was more than kind regarding the issue and took care of it for us!"}
{"text":"Been here twice. They are still new and have some kinks to work out. Parking is terrible. (Not fully their fault!) There's always a long wait because most items are served buffet style. If you want something that's not, you still have to go through the line for your drink. The first time I went, the line was too long so I went to the pastry side and got coconut cake. It was delicious! Second time, I waited for the French onion soup. It was blah. Maybe I expected better because the restaurant has a French theme, but it was disappointing. (Mimi's cafe has better soup.) The ambiance is fun, and the pastries are delicious!"}
{"text":"Went w my two boys for breakfast Friday.  Nice decor.   Rather confusing ordering process.  A manager was handing out menus at the door and then another person was taking order at the door.  Then got a wireless square to go pay.  

After paying and sat down, no one provided any help for the next 20mins.   We sat near the open kitchen and can see all the food come out.  Got tired of waiting.  Went up to the register and finally got 2 cups for water.  Turns out 2 dishes were completed and sat on pass through for at least 10mins.  Another 5 mins later the waiter finally decided to bring the food out.  

All food were lukewarm at best.  A cappuccino still did not show up until another 5mins later.  So everything arrived after 30mins.

Filed a complaint w manger and took a few bites of cold disgusting dishes and then we left.

Save your money.  Don't come here"}
{"text":"Opening Day is alway confusing for most businesses, but la Madeleine was pretty good (for the most part). 

I ordered their Cáfe Sampler (Quiche, Salad and Soup) To Go, and to my surprise it was BOGO.  Nice start!  For myself I tried their French Dip and because tomorrow is Ash Wednesday, ahhhh Valentines Day, I order a Dark Chocolate Heart (photo) shaped cake for the boss. 

Everything was very tasty and only ran me $32.60 after the discount. 

Even better, la Madeleine's is near my office, so I'll be back real soon."}
{"text":"I really love the food here, especially their croissants. However, since the time of their grand opening, the service has gradually become terrible. Food orders are incorrect, your food is delayed, the line at the counter is led to be way too long even when they seem to have plenty of other staff that can take on another register. 

Service and timeliness overall need to improve. I believe that is the largest complaint from other Yelpers as well. I have not returned in a while due to the last visit being so poor."}
{"text":"Stopped in for an afternoon treat. It was our first time and we were presented with the most awkward request to order for dine in or take out. Not certain why we needed to choose as the place was near empty and we wanted to dine in. It was fully staffed with servers eating at various  tables (limiting customer choice, they have a nice fireplace - off limits since employees were there and other tables not bussed) talking to others, and generally carrying on. Even with all the idle staff, tables weren't bussed, restrooms needed stocking and cleaning. As we made our order we were given all our items individually without knowing, or being provided with, a tray. We were also given a buzzer - that thing that alerts you when your order is ready - but we didn't need it (?) and it only added to the numerous items I needed to juggle. It's a strange buffet style for a French place better suited for a mall food court. Interior is well appointed. The food looked good and the crescent seemed decent even as it was served on too small of a plate that nearly slid off, again, no tray. I feel there are a lot of bugs to work out, more training needed, and some emphasis (and presence) by management on service and quality. Maybe another time."}
{"text":"So we came back and again something was missing from our order. We told the server, who said 'Okay\" but never returned. He also didn't bother to pick up the empty tray from our table.
My husband took his receipt to the counter to ask for his missing salad. They gave it to him but no one seemed concerned that a customer had an issue. 
Later he went to order dessert, stood at the counter with his money out but no one even looked up so we left. 
We rarely complain, especially about new restaurants but we've had the same issues   on 3 out of 4 visits and I see that management has not addressed any of the other complaints on Yelp.
La Madeleine, we were excited to have you return to Phoenix but this level of non-service is unacceptable."}
{"text":"Total disappointment staff was disorganized not trained yet . Place order, food did not taste good and was served cold. If you have a nice car stay away, parking lot is so small you can barely get in an out. 

What bothered me most:  staff rudeness specially guy  in brown shirt and we were not able to order pastries to go.


Maybe in a year they will get how this place is supposed to work"}
{"text":"On our first visit to the Chandler, Arizona location, we waited 45 minutes for our food.  We asked for help from several managers, each said they would check on our order.  No one came back with our food or even an update. We finally had to ask for our money back, leaving hungry and upset. 

It's a shame.  I remember this restaurant from the Scottsdale location many years ago and wanted to try it again.  Unfortunately, we will never step back into the restaurant.  Horrible service, and horrendous management."}
{"text":"I've been there twice.  Each time I ordered something to go.  The first time as I waited for my order I wanted to sit down on the bench near the cash register to wait for my order, but several of the employees were sitting there just doing nothing.  They smiled at me as I stood for 15 minutes waiting for my order.  The manager was on duty and saw this but did nothing. 

The second time the girl at the cash register obviously had not been trained because she had no idea how to ring up my order.  She entered it in incorrectly and a second employee came over and read back my order but it was all incorrect.  When I got my order home  realized they didn't put any napkins or plastic utensils in my bag.  Again, no training what so ever...  Again a manager was on duty this time too. 

The chicken salad was too peppery.  The potato soup was watery and gritty with not much flavor.  Definitely not thick and hearty. 

I noticed they had quiches and sandwiches pre-made sitting on a warming griddle that looked like they had been sitting there for a very long time.  It's like a cafeteria style where the food is sitting there until someone orders it. 

A lot of the cookies and pastries in the glass case looked scorched on the bottom. 

Too bad because I really wanted to like this place."}
{"text":"Today was our second meal at the new cafe in Chandler. The service was great...they have really worked hard to make ordering easy and we enjoyed tasty food. They have built a beautiful, bright, fun cafe. Can't wait for the San Tan location to open!  Viva la France!"}
{"text":"Tried brand new one at San Tan Village. First impression was encouraging. Looks like a cute french bistro, even has the outdoor cafe area. BUT, upon entry the confusion begins. They give you a menu, great!  Then tell you some items are brought to your table but some you pick up yourself from cafeteria style line. Then you tell your complete order to someone who enters it onto an ipad. But then you still go through a cafeteria style line with a tray??  You tell the person behind the food line what you want again then she tells you if you get it on your tray or if it will be brought out to your table.  Then you go to pay and they give you a tracker/number thing to put on the table. So you've got part of your food, a big honkin tray, glasses for drinks AND a tracker device!!
WHA????
Food was alright and atmosphere was great. Service is also great. But pick a delivery method!!
Is it cafeteria style aka IKEA or is it a sit down and order??  Not sure it's worth the effort"}
{"text":"This is a fast food restaurant disguised as a French bakery to justify the higher prices that they charge for disgusting low grade food. I ordered a turkey/brie sandwich that was two pieces of over-baked bread, a folded over lump of commercial turkey slices like you would find at a grocery store, covered with a blob of mayonnaise and no brie. The spinach salad was served on a flat plate and the salad was not tossed and was spilling off the plate. The server had their thumb in the salad when they brought it to the table!

The place is staffed with young inexperienced workers who wear these fake-French outfits and have no clue how to work in a restaurant setting and have no idea about the concept of customer service, and it is obvious they have received little or no training. The food prep and presentation are sloppy and poorly done. As an eat-in lunch place it is a waste of time and money, and you are better off going to to Panera or Chipotle.  

I predict this franchise will follow the path of Quiznos and disappear in a year or two. There are simply too many other good choices close by for the same or better price."}
{"text":"Nope. Confusing from the get go. While standing in line at the entrance you're handed a menu. At the front of the line you realize you should have your order ready to place. Btw, the bakery items are blocked by the line you're in. We ordered a sandwich, a kid's pasta meal, and a quiche. Well, the quiche you pick up along the cafeteria line. I sat with my quiche while my party waited on their meals at the table. The table we found on our own and it was the only four top that was clean. I started eating so mine wouldn't be cold and was near done by the time they received their meals. My quiche, though nice size was not the flavorful dish I'm accustomed to, and came with no side...not even a garnish. Just a block of quiche. Sandwich went half eaten. Pasta was okay. The fruit was the best part of their meals. We may attempt this one more time for a bakery item (muffin or something) but will never dine in again. Also.....just looked at the receipt: they charged $1.50 to \"sub fruit\" when they asked which side you wanted with the sandwich and fruit was in the list. WTH?? So that half eaten sandwich was now $9.18. That's baloney. Don't offer sides if they cost extra...and customer has no idea. That's just dumb."}
{"text":"I used to live in Dallas and La Madeleine is a staple.  I was so happy to see this restaurant open in Gilbert.  I love their food and I can't wait to enjoy it again."}
{"text":"I hardly take the time to type reviews, but this place needed it. The service is super slow, the layout of the place feels as if you going through a maze. When you arrive, you have someone taking your order as you are standing in line, then are given a number which is tracked by the employees so they know where you are sitting. But, the employees were walking around as if they didn't know where the food needed to be served. They were asking if you ordered x,y and z. You typically would consider this place similar to a Panera, but you are waiting 30 minutes for your food. I would understand if you ordered a steak, but when you order a soup and sandwhich, it shouldn't be that tough to put together as the soup, which is made prior. Overall, the food does taste amazing, but be prepared to spend a great amount of time at this place. Mind you, there were other tables complaining to the manager as we sat down due to slow service."}
{"text":"I would give the location in the San Tan Village a \"0\" if I could. The staff are very confused and don't know what they are doing. The area where we sat down to eat was filthy with lots of food on the floor. We have mushroom soup that was tasteless and french onion soup that tasted like wine soup. My husband had a roast beef sandwich that tasted like pure horseradish. We also wanted to try some French bakery items (chocolate croissant, etc.) and they tasted like they were 2-3 days old  (not fresh at all). The place is also very, very overpriced -- $3.50 for a chocolate croissant and almost $50 for lunch for 3 people.  One of the  worst restaurants in Gilbert. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Eggs are good, croissants excellent.  Parking lot is a nightmare and designed by a moron.    Be cautious over lunch hour it's one way and when you get to an end it meets up with a drive thru exit that has to come your way!  I got stuck ( all the parking spaces were taken) so i had to back up all the way . Lucky for me as I was  backing all the way back to the entrance no one decided to back out of their parking spot.This is a mess and designed for accidents"}
{"text":"How a French restaurant runs out of crepes does not make sense to me. Half of their menu is literally crepe and didn't have it available at 10am."}
{"text":"I never understand the setup this cafe has to order food. You stand in line to place your order, they give you a buzzer with your number and move to the counter to pay for your order. Also how do you run out of cinnamon french toast? It's a cafe and toast should be the last thing you run out. Very strange!
With all this technology while ordering, they still messed up my wife's order. She had ordered a sandwich (without cheese) and salad. What she got was a sandwich which had cheese and a tomato soup!
By the end of our meal we were frustrated with our visit and were dying to leave. We will give this place another try hopefully it is better than our past experience otherwise we will go to Panera"}
{"text":"You'll note I did not check in here.  Because I've never actually been here.  However, they catered a small group lunch at my office.  So I've now sampled their food.  Here's what I think.

I had the chicken pesto sandwich.  It was really good.  The flavors were very well balanced.  I could taste the chicken, but I also could taste the pesto.  Often one will overwhelm the other, but not here.  As I said, well balanced.  And the pesto tasted like a really good pesto.

Included was a pasta salad.  It was a bow tie pasta with a tomato-ey sauce.  It was very tasty.  And then a chocolate chip cookie.  The cookie was big, soft and didn't have that commercial cookie flavor.  You know?  That flavor of a cookie that was part of a batch of 10000 where probably no human was involved?  This cookie didn't have that.  It was really good.  Almost tasted like the ones I make at home for myself.

I also got to try their baguette, and it was very fresh and had a nice flavor.  A simple thing, but they did it well.  Kudos there too.

Obviously I cannot speak to their staff/service, nor anything else about the restaurant.  But this chicken pesto sandwich with pasta salad and a cookie was excellent."}
{"text":"Consistently great food, but depending on the day, good service can be a hit or miss. Either way, we love that La Madeleine is back in Arizona! We missed it!"}
{"text":"Worst experience ever!

Completely unorganized, unfriendly staff and the food was cold and bland.... extremely disappointing"}
{"text":"I walked in not knowing what to expect, the set up was confusing at first but then, I asked someone who worked there how things are set up and she walked me thru.
 
It's like going to a cafeteria to eat, since you are to walk down the line with a tray....super cute! 

I personally didn't think that the portions were enough for the price that they charge. The slices of cakes are too small!! I paid $4.99 (Coconut cake) for what appeared to be half of a half slice! Disappointing!! 

After spending $14.00 on breakfast and not getting a fair portion, I don't see going back here unless I wanted to purchase a entire Tart which was $22.00. (fair price)"}
{"text":"Oh my, what a disappointment. The facility itself, is beautiful. The employees look professional speaking French. The issue is they do not attend to their customers. Not once did someone check on us. We had to return the coffee because I had grounds, and then 10 minutes later we got the cup back we're nearly finished with their breakfast. No apologies just all this happen sometimes \" trying to perfect it\" .Also had to go ask her to go boxes. With the construction going on in the parking lot, you would think they would attend to their customers. Good luck!!!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants that I got to experience from Dallas, Texas. The service is very good overall.  There are a couple of employees that don't seem to know how to train the other employees in an effective manner and it was easily noticeable as a consumer but everybody was more than helpful the food was delicious and I can't wait to keep coming back."}
{"text":"Amazing! We tried 3 different dishes when we visited and all were delicious. Great place if you're wanting breakfast mid-day as their breakfast was very good. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Pastry case is fine, coffee is fine, the rest of the menu is fake french weak sauce. Ok for to go pastries, not worth trying to eat mediocre food in an overly crowded environment."}
{"text":"This place was HORRIBLE. My mother and I tried it for dinner and the simple  process of just ordering our meal was disjointed and overly complicated. Several different people told us they would enter the order when we were ready, and at that point one individual  entered our order on a tablet just for us to walk ten steps further to finish the order at the cash register and pay. My order was incorrect, but edible, but my mom's quiche crust was hard as a rock like it had been sitting out all night. We both had a cup of soup that tasted ok going down, but as all the \"flavors\" congregated in our stomachs, within 30 minutes we both felt incredibly uncomfortable and extremely nauseated. We will not go back and hopefully they get their act together for the sake of their customer's gag-reflex."}
{"text":"The creme brulee cheesecake and buttered croissant were delicious! The decor inside is warm and inviting. I can't wait to go back to try an entree."}
{"text":"Cream brûlée  - mastered. Cafeteria concept - a work in progress.  Our three items became available after three long intervals. While waiting for the buzzer that never beeped we noticed three managers in three colored shirts hovered but did not seem to notice the employee taking a break/staring at phone amid dining customers; did the remodel fail to include an employee break area?

If you go, keep it simple by selecting something from the display case, take it in hand, walk to the other end of the counter, pay and enjoy. Wait, you will have to let the iPad host enter the item and the cashier will have to read it off as you pay...

The advantage here is that you don't have to travel 5000 miles to feel an authentic French modus operandi."}
{"text":"First time I have been here.  They have a very good mushroom soup and salads are made right in front of you.     I also love the atmosphere very cozy."}
{"text":"Great restaurant that reminds me of Petite Provence in Portland. Delicious, great atmosphere, and reasonable price."}
{"text":"We've been wanting to try this place since they opened and finally had the opportunity last night.  First, the inside of the cafe is a lot bigger than we had thought.  We were surprised to see that it takes up at least half of the little strip mall space.  And, they have a small room (not sure size but bet you could seat about 40 or so) that is enclosed and available for reservations.  Didn't ask about the charge for the room.

Cutely decorated in what we are assuming would be a French Cafe in France with exposed wood beams and lots of charming french pictures of flower fields and such.  Staff was friendly and helpful and explained things and also checked in a couple of times during our meal.  You order at the counter and then they bring the food to you.  They also have a small bread bar sit up with about four varieties of bread slices and butter and both seedless blackberry and strawberry preserves.  We tried the sourdough and wheat and they were good and the preserves were wonderful.

We ordered the Salmon and French Lentils with a side Ceasar salad and the French Dip with a side of mushroom soup.  Everything was wonderful and tasty.  The salmon dish is sort of a lentil soup/broth and the flavor was fresh and light.  Lots of vegetables including kale.  Salmon was cooked perfectly and had a light crispy crust to it.  The french dip was so good...lots of meat, provolone cheese and the onions were caramelized to perfection.  Both sides were just as good, the ceasar salad had just the right amount of dressing and the croutons were small and savory.  The mushroom soup?  OMG...so creamy and flavorful and now one of my favorites!  

Overall a great experience and we'll be back.  We did check out the bakery case and saw lots of yummy looking sweets but we'll have to try them next time!"}
{"text":"We were looking forward to the opening of this new French bakery and cafe at San Tan in Gilbert.  It has a great location, the menu prices are reasonable, and the decor is warm and welcoming.  Those are the positives.  When you walk into a real French bakery, the smell of baked bread envelopes you.  But at la Madeleine, it's obvious that none of the baking is done there because the aroma of fresh baked bread doesn't greet you at the door. 
 I dropped by yesterday for an afternoon sweet fix.  When we walked in, it wasn't crowded so I wondered why all of the young people working there seemed so bewildered.  There were five or six in crisp new uniforms standing in front of and behind the counter.  We were there between lunch and dinner so, again,  it wasn't busy.  Yet, between chatting amongst themselves or looking lost, I had to ask for help at the pastry case. 
 The pastries were tasty, so we decided to return for dinner today.  The setup, as other reviews have mentioned, is confusing.  There's a sign that instructs patrons to wait for the hostess.  Because there are actual printed menus (as opposed to a wall menu), we thought we were waiting for a hostess to seat us.   That didn't happen.  The way it works is that you're supposed to pick up a menu, which is fairly detailed, and figure out what you want while in line.   Then you're called over to place an order, unless you want the café trio or any items that are ready-made.  In this case, you move on to someone else who dishes up the food.  The salad I ordered was supposed to have toasted pecans, which they were out of but were toasting more in the kitchen.   OK...I said I'd wait.   But they also kept my soup and quiche on a plate behind the counter, waiting for the pecans from the kitchen.   After waiting several minutes, I went to the counter and asked for my plate.  They offered to bring a side of pecans to the table when they were ready.   The soup (lentil and kale) was delicious, but the quiche was cool...and the toasted pecans never made it to my salad.    But I wasn't surprised.  The guys in the kitchen appear to be in over their heads.     My son and daughter ordered menu items, one of them a specialty.   My daughter's sandwich was cold and looked like something from a refrigerated bin at a mini-mart.   She didn't eat it.  My son ate a portion of his \"specialty,\" but said it was no better than cafeteria food.   This place needs better management.  They shouldn't be running out of food items, especially when trying to build its clientele.  The cafe has been open only for two weeks, and it shows.  The staff definitely needs more training.   The quiches should be kept warmer, or should be warmed up before plating.    This is just common sense.
We won't be back....except for pastries on the go."}
{"text":"At the end of the day, the problem here is the concept: French food served cafeteria style. You must place your order with the hostess before you get to the buffet line. Maybe it wouldn't surprise you to hear that people are indecisive and sloooooow!! So that holds up the line.

I tried the Cafe Sampler: choice of soup, salad and half of a quiche. The French onion soup is very average, and if you adore the baked, cheesy top the best you're out of luck. They toss a crouton on top and sprinkle it with some very cheap looking shredded cheese. (Not even enough to cover the crouton.) The salad would have been decent, but mine was supposed to have cranberries and pecans in it. Cranberry count =4. Pecan count = 0. My inability to eat the quiche was partly my fault. I don't like runny eggs, yet I'm aware that's how they serve them in Europe. Wet eggs gross me out but there may be others who prefer them that way. I had the Quiche Lorraine that was supposed to have bacon and ham. Though I didn't eat more than a bite of it, I poked around with my fork looking for meat. The bacon I found was just the fat, and I did not find any ham.

The manager seems to want to fix things, yet when he saw I didn't eat the quiche no refund or substitution was offered. I think he's overwhelmed by running a new establishment that has a lot of kinks to work out. My sister told me that their pastries were good, but I don't think that's enough to bring me back."}
{"text":"I wanted to try breakfast and lunch before my review 

First off, let's understand and be patient with their newness and service may take some time to refine. With that being said, Shay is a rockstar! She is sure helpful and informative and works really well under pressure!

I will say that I prefer lunch over breakfast and the desserts are pretty good.

Breakfast:
The quiche is ok
The cinnamon crepe w/romanoff strawberries is really good!
I appreciate the idea of what they are trying to do but since the quiche is made before it opens and they made to order the crepes, we shared my quiche while we waited for my wifes crepes. 
Tip: either order pre-made for everyone  or order breakfast made to order so you can eat together.

Lunch: 
The Pesto pasta is actually pretty good.
The sandwiches; Croque Monsieur, Turkey Bistro, and
French Dip au Caramelized Onions are all very good.
The soups; the French onion is just ok, the potato soup is good. FYI it's more of a broth base but its flavorful.

Desserts:
The excellent; lemon madeleines, lemon tart, chocolate tart and Raspberry Cream Cheese Croissant
The just ok; fruit tart, eclair"}
{"text":"Me: I don't know how to review this without feeling like a traitor to my love of French food. 

Craig: Well, let's be honest and start with the good. The flavors were good. 

Me: They were! They really, really were. And the bread was the star. 

Craig: Yeah, we might leave with some bread. 

Me: But the entrées were lukewarm--after coming from the kitchen seconds before.

Craig: Literally. 

Me: If they had been hot, they'd have been great. But it seemed like they had been sitting out a while, which I can't explain as I customized my order. 

Craig: The desserts were also somewhat lacking. 

Me: Yeah, such a disappointment! It seemed like they were a few days old. 

Craig: But it's Monday. 

Me: I love the decor, though. The rolling pins and bread boards and China plates. It looks like a restaurant you *might* find in southern France--if it were Americanized. 

Craig: You could convince yourself of that. But I do like that there was a real fire. 

Me: Yes, which is exactly what one needs in southern Arizona. But the staff were all very nice. 

Craig: They were. And *very* new. 

Me: I want to give this a second chance because I think it has potential. 

Craig: It does. I was gonna say that as well. 

Me: But I really, really hope all the food is fresh and hot next time. If it were, I could see this as a place I'd come back to a lot, and it'd be at least four stars for me. As a side note, the ordering process is a bit of a hassle. I think they should with go with a take-out option and a traditional dine-in service with waiters. 

Craig: Yeah, I agree. 

Me: Okay, so we'll give it one more shot and update after."}
{"text":"Tried this restaurant for the first time. Was a little confused about the setup but they helped walk you through the experience. 

The Parisien Eggs- Two fried eggs served on a freshly baked butter croissant with ham, bacon and hollandaise sauce. This was absolutely amazing. We also had some pastries."}
{"text":"Nice place it's my second visit to this place. My first was good minus the major stomach ache I later had after eating one of their chicken dishes. Today I came in wanting to try their all day breakfast. I ordered the waffles and strawberries, the French toast and the American breakfast. The French toast and waffles were over cooked. Both crunchy almost chip like. The fruit that came with them was delicious and fresh. The bacon on the All American was like chips also, way over cooked. The one good thing about my meal was my eggs, they were yummy. Probably won't be coming back and if I do I'm hoping to update this review to a more positive one."}
{"text":"Like many Yelpers, I was eager to try this new \"French\" bakery/cafe. It was very disappointing and probably not worth another try. There are way too many good restaurants all over Chandler. I ordered a bowl of French onion soup and the turkey/Brie sandwich. My husband ordered a Caesar salad and tomato soup. The food was basic. Nothing special to report. The French onion soup had a minute amount of unmelted cheese on the top. Longhorn makes a nice French onion soup FYI. Let me echo the sentiments of previous reviewers. The place is pretty and expansive. It was nearly empty on arrival last Wednesday 4/11. There is a set up for two lines: take out/ bakery on the right and dine in on the left. A staff person came up and told us we could sit down, look at our menus and then order. Once we were ready, there were some staff behind the counter but no one near the registers. The same girl materialized and took our order and then we paid her. She screwed up and just put me down for a cup of soup. Screwing up orders is a common theme among fellow Yelpers. It took a very long time to get our food. In the meantime, we watched the creepy manager in the purple shirt pass his number to a girl who appeared to be friends with the immature staff \"working\" there. I use quotes because the group assembled wearing dorky berets appear to move at a very social, leisurely pace. Oddly, their \"bakery\" is a very small,underwhelming display case. We finished eating and had to get in line for the \"bakery\". The guy behind the counter is pretty bored with his job. He makes no eye contact. Son, I hope you're focused on school otherwise get used to working at jobs that bore you, and grow a personality. Unbelievably, we couldn't just order our cookie and scone, pay and receive it. Mr Misery said: \"name\". So we got to stand there while they changed the cash drawer and tripped over each other. Then Mr. Misery called our name. The cookie and scone were just okay. I cannot fathom coming here on a busy day. There's just no way! There is another location opening over at San Tan in Gilbert. We may brave that one. Most likely just for coffee and a muffin though."}
{"text":"Everything is great except for the parking. Had to park at the hotel, which I'm sure is going to be a problem soon. I am also handicapped."}
{"text":"Went there for the 1st time today, around 9: 15 AM; after my experience I normally would have given it a 3 or less, but read on......

   They have a serving line-style ordering format, but at the beginning of the line some lady took my order on a tablet.  I ordered Eggs Parisien and nothing else.  When I get to the cashier at the end of the line, somehow my order had morphed into Eggs Parisien, two coffees, and a chocolate croissant.  Took the cashier two or three talks with the line mgr to get the unwanted items removed from my order, then she gives me my order tracking device with my number on it. 

 I sit at the table waiting...20 minutes goes by, where's my food?  I ask the server guy who is dropping off the orders, he acts concerned and asks what's going on.  Finally, after about 30 min of fretting, it arrives....

   Well, the dish was excellent, and I don't think they rushed it out to get to me.  They also have excellent bread, complimentary, on a bread rack.  Plus fountain diet Coke which helps a lot in my book.  

   So I give them a four because the food, when it did arrive, was really good and all the employees I talked to were very friendly and sympathetic, including the cashier who apologized initially for the ordering mix-up.

   I am just not sure if my case was a 1-time snafu or business as usual.   I note that they have dozens of employees, I am wondering if they have exposed some organizational theory phenomena where beyond a certain point, more employees stops helping, any then even makes things worse.

   So I will try this place again, either much earlier in the morning or when snowbirds have gone home.  I note that the storefront the are in, including the PotBellys sandwich place, is a parking nightmare and not sure if that will ever fix itself especially since a new building is going up right next door."}
{"text":"This is the worst restaurant I have ever been to 
The food had set out in that refrigerator part where the desserts are for quite some time because the food was refrigerator burnt. When they brought the food it was ice cold when I asked the waitress if she could warm it up the manager came over and was so rude.. the manager was so rude. We had a party of three my sister never received her food and they drop the food in the back and it looks like they picked it up off the floor and shopped it on my friends dish.we walked out I will never ever go back to that place again Worst customer service worst manager worst food very very disappointed Department of health services should be involved with the preparation of the food"}
{"text":"Excellent lunch. Great cream of mushroom soup. I had the Croque monsieur. It was excellent 
Well worth it."}
{"text":"I am pleased to have a French cafe in the Chandler neighborhood. The theme and decorations reminds you of the classic French country. This location just opened last week, as expected, the lines were long and the parking lot was packed. The food and customer service was worth the wait.

They had three managers on the floor welcoming customers and helping the new staff. The dine in line was backed up, because they one person taking your order via an iPad. Also, new customers were undecided what to order.

The take out line was shorter and more convenient. You could order from the take out menu or through the app. The app I found very intuitive.

I ordered dinner for take out: the cream of mushroom soup, cranberry chicken salad and creme brûlée cheesecake. The flavor was spot on and portion was reasonable for the price. I came back for breakfast and had the bacon egg and cheese croissant with coffee. The croissant was flaky soft and buttery.

The two factors that impacted the 5 stars was the minor mistakes with my orders. They had trouble retrieving customer orders from the app and forgot to pack my dessert. The staff and managers were quick to step in and resolve the issue. They also gave me a free dessert for my inconvenience. I am confident they will smooth out the kinks and establish a rhythm.

I will definitely be a regular for breakfast lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"I gave the stars for the food. The service and the way you run this place?? WTF?? First thing I noticed is no worker was over 16. Uh oh. They stop you and grill you on what you want. But if you have questions expect blank faces. We get our food. My wife gets her salad right away and she is almost done by the time my sandwich came out. Imagine Paradise Bakery with a French snootiness?? Very very weird."}
{"text":"Cookies were good, but the service was a little confused.  I'm guessing it was because it is a new place. Overall, I would have liked to see a bigger variety of desserts. ..but was pleased with the two I chose :)"}
{"text":"I would come again! 

It was packed on a Thursday around noon but didn't have to wait in line forever. Gave me some time to go over the menu since it was my first time. Was greeted at the door and everyone seemed nice. 
I got the kale and quinoa salad with chickpeas and added salmon on top. The garlic dressing was barely there the salad needed something extra so I asked for light balsamic vinaigrette and it was delicious ! Would order this salad again. All reasonably priced and pretty big portions. 
One thing Me and my friends did not like is that we felt pressured to finish up and leave to make room for others? The lady who was cleaning our tables came I kid you not around 10 times every 7 mins to clear a plate. It got annoying! 2-3 times is excellent service beyond that is get up and leave hint. You'd be eating and comes and asks if she can take the plate you tell her no then comes back 5-7 mins later and wants to take that plate away! 
    The only reason I gave them a 3 star! Since it plays a huge role on one deciding to come back!"}
{"text":"It is so difficult to write this as I have been waiting for La Madeleine to open as I enjoyed this place thoroughly in Texas. The food is still great but this location is not doing so well. 

First, we ordered a breakfast combo and it was to come with a croissant. The person taking our order stated they were out of croissants. Hmmm a French place out of croissants? Weird, but OK we subbed for toast. As we move through the line to pay we notice numerous croissants out fresh in their display case. We get to the register and ask the cashier if we are able to have those croissants as we understand the person taking our order stated they were out. She responds \"I don't see why not, and I don't know why they told you we were out, we definitely have croissants\". 

The cashier then asked the manager to correct our orders on the screen in order to not receive toast when the food is delivered. The manager neglected to help his staff, ignored the cashier when she asked for help, and only handed off his card so she could fumble through fixing it on her own. She was very nice and appeared so flustered by how her manager reacted, that I simply waited patiently, thanked her for assisting us, and apologized for the inconvenience. 

I had read the reviews prior to attending and knew they were having some \"opening challenges\" but I can see where those challenges lie. The manager on duty did not appear to help his staff nor did he ensure to tell the person taking orders that they do in fact have a very important item available on their menu. The manager happened to be the one delivering our food and he did not even offer an apology for the confusion and dropped off our food in a rapid fashion and took off before we could ask about our coffees that were not yet delivered.

I hope to try this location again and am keeping my fingers crossed that things improve because it would be such a shame to have this wonderful food but lack of successful operations/ management."}
{"text":"So so very happy that LaMadeline has come back to Phoenix!
We have been there 3 times in a weeks time and have not been disappointed in any way!
Welcome home you guys!!"}
{"text":"big fan of la madeleine from houston. i was glad to see the chandler cafe open. i arrived just before 7am, found my dish and followed the magic marker sign for customers dining in. there was nothing on the line. i proceeded to the cash register and waited for help. there were 2 employees in the area but my presence was not acknowledged. finally an  employee from the take out area asked me if i had been helped. he informed me that i would have to go to the other end of the line to place my order since there was only 1 employee allowed to operate a cash register. a very disjointed beginning. i have returned twice since then.
my order was delivered in a timely manner each time. outside of the stage fright on the first visit i have been pleased except for the coffee.
someone is in dire need of remedial coffee making. there were grounds in the american blend and the french dark roast had a similar taste but no visible grounds. in the future i will try the tea for just drink water."}
{"text":"My wife loves this place and give it 2 enthusiastic thumbs up and loves ordering lunch online for pick-up. While I understand that's very convenient for a busy elementary school teacher, I just don't get what she sees in it beyond that. It's a convenient location, although the parking lot is inadequate at peak hours due to the dead-end drive thru. The interior is very neat with all the wood trim. The employees were very nice and helpful. But that's about it for the Pros. If the food were better, I would have no problem giving it 5 stars. It's not horrible food, but The Perfect Pear is far superior. it's just basic food, dressed up in a really nice setting. I got their signature dish - Croque Monsier.  First time to a restaurant, I always try to get a dish it's famous for. I really didn't see what the big deal was. It's basically a Monte-Cristo-type warm sandwich, no different than Chompies. My big complaint is when restaurants make these ''elite' sandwiches and the insides (meat, cheese, etc) are a big lump in the middle and the rest of the sandwich is plain bread because they couldn't take the time to actually spread out the ingredients so you'd get a good bite every time. The second big issue is since it's warm/heated, as it sits on the plate, the bottom can get soggy. Mine must have been sitting for a while because the bottom of the bread was mushy. Yuck. So their 'signature dish' was fairly tasteless, I had to spread the insides around with my finger, and it was soggy on the bottom. Triple Yuck. The pasta salad side was really good but the meal was already on the downside by that time. Or course I have a very small sample size of one visit and one dish, but it WAS a signature dish. Since my wife loves it, I'm sure I'll be going back, so I'll try the crepes next time and hopefully have better luck."}
{"text":"Ah, La Madeleine. I loved to eat at La Madeleine way back when they had a location at the Scottsdale Fashion Square Mall (Eons ago, when dinosaurs roamed the Earth in search of Coelacanth croissants, French onion Oviraptor soup and Brontosaurus brioche ), so I was excited to hear they had opened up a shop in Chandler near the mall. We were in search of an evening sweet treat, so we headed over to get a few items to go. When we entered, we were warmly greeted by one of the workers exclaiming \"Bonjour!\" There's a dine in area and a separate to-go and bakery area which is convenient for those wanting to grab and go. 

We perused through the delectable looking pastry case. The sacher torte caught my eye. It's hard to find this little slice of Austrian heaven in Arizona, so I knew I had to get it. I also love citrus-infused desserts as well so we got a lemon tart. It was neatly packaged in a small little box and we were on our way to enjoy some dessert in the comfort of our own home.

The sacher torte was a lovely sight to behold. The ganache layer was perfectly smooth, with a small little chocolate \"Sacher\" placard on top. While the end of the torte was a bit dry the rest of the cake was moist and I liked the combination of fruit with the dense chocolate cake. The lemon tart was beautifully made, but the crust was a bit too hard for me with a runny filling that was too sweet for my tastes. 

I'm glad La Madeleine is back in the Phoenix area! Here's hoping it's here to stay."}
{"text":"My review is based on an entire easy, hassle-free, convenient to-go order. I downloaded the app and through other restaurant apps it already had my payment info and birthday all filled in. Cool. 
I place my order because my son and I are hungry and soup and sandwiches sound yummy for lunch. Placed the order put our shoes on, drove over and everything is set. She was extremely kind and while nagging up last minute compulsive purchases another hostess/waiter asks if we are being helped. Love it. 
Will absolutely return for any reason."}
{"text":"Have been waiting to try this place. The reviews a bit back and forth. Had a try this morning and it was fantastic.  I never give 5 stars unless I've been several times so this is good start.  Cappuccino could use less foam and the sugar packets on the patio had gotten moist but the food was so delicious!   I got the Parisienne Eggs over medium, hubby got the Spicy Eggs Basque and we had to try the Potato Gelatte.   All were perfectly prepared.  Looked great tasted fantastic!  Service was exceptional.   We even bought a couple of pastries and the home made strawberry rhubarb jam to go. We plan on going back for a lunch with the homemade tomato basil soup and a salad."}
{"text":"18 years in the US and still hopeful about a decent baguette and croque monsieur. Finally stopped in today after driving in front of it for a few weeks. Parking lot was full, and it's a dead end. Super irritating to have to turn around when you get to the end: it's the Pot Belly drive thru oncoming so no way out of this but reverse. Settled for \"take out\" parking spot. Very long order-in line. Faces tell me it's not moving very fast, so I opt for take-out lane. Some bakery items look good, but at $3.99 for a single tiny chocolate croissant, I'll stick to what I came in for.
*Review for baguette*: looks real. Feels crusty, as it should. I rip the end, and there are some holes in the dough, as it should. It tasted ok! Good combination of crusty and soft. I'm not crying but I'm also not throwing it out. That's high praise.
*Review for croque monsieur*: I'm crying. Not tears of joy. Why. Why, La Madeleine? Why the wheat berry bread. Total nonsense. Ruins it completely. And the bottom slice is super soggy. And why the \"garlic cream sauce\". It's béchamel. Croque monsieur has béchamel. One of the 5 Classic french sauces. 3 ingredients. You really can't fu*k it up. Ham was good, melted cheese on top very flavorful. I can see how I can order this with crusty white bread instead of the weird wheat berry, but unless you chuck the \"garlic cream sauce\", I'll keep making it myself. 
Merci to the cashier who spoke french back to me when ordering. Nice touch!"}
{"text":"Ordered the chicken salad sandwich on a croissant with a caesar salad on the side. The salad was good, but a little heavy on the dressing in my opinion. And the sandwich was very tasteful. Also, I enjoyed that there was an area with bread, butter, and jam that allows guests to have an appetizer while waiting for their food. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a family friendly restaurant with good food that can be prepared and served quickly (with 10-15 minutes)."}
{"text":"Simply delicious! At 11:40 already had a line to the door. Worth noting that the right side is for pick up/takeout delivery and the left side is a buffet line. A gentleman handed out menus as we stood in line to order. Some items (ie soup and salad) was on the buffet and other items like the pasta came direct from kitchen to our table. We enjoyed a tomato basil soup and French onion. Soup salad sampler was perfect portions and great way to try three delicious items. All 4 of us were happy."}
{"text":"Haven't had this in YEARS since the one in Scottsdale Fashion Square closed. Randomly opened Yelp to find a place in Chandler to eat and couldn't believe my eyes. For was great like I remembered. Definitely will be coming back."}
{"text":"I'm such a sucker for cakes and cheesecake! This is my new go to whenever I get a craving for them. I've had their coconut and chocolate cake, creme burlee cheesecake, and strawberry napoleon. My favorites are by far the chocolate and cheesecake, 4 stars for these tasty little treats. The chocolate one has a nice rich and balanced chocolate flavor with a ganache like coating, none of that sickenly sweet frosting. The creme burlee one is light and the flavoring isn't overpowering or crazy sweet. The coconut one is tasty as well although I wish there was slightly more coconut flavor. The cake was still very moist though. The strawberry napoleon is probably my least favorite out of the four. The pastry wasn't anything to write home about and I wasn't a fan of the cream either. 

I've also tried one of their savory options, the french dip with a side pasta salad. This sandwhich wasn't bad but also not great. I found the pasta salad to be average as well. I'd like to try more of their lunch options next time. 

So all in all I'd give it 3.5 stars. The staff is always welcoming here. I'd definitely choose this place over any other salad/sandwhich/soup chain restaurant."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE! 
We needed to have a quick breakfast meeting and a colleague suggested La Madeline. The 4 of us ordered an array of sweet and savory dishes from  their breakfast menu, which has such unique and wonderful choices. Each dish was beyond delicious. 

The restaurant is brand new and immaculately clean. The service was friendly and efficient. I highly recommend the Linzer cookies! What a treat! They were so good we bought some to take home!"}
{"text":"I got the French dip. It was amazing. The menu was a bit pricier than I was expecting and the parking is bad."}
{"text":"Well, I went in all excited because I called ahead and found out they sell Napoleons. I get there and the Napoleons have fresh strawberries in them. I have NEVER in 38 years had a Napoleon with strawberries! Also no marble chocolate icing on top either. I asked and they wouldn't make them for me without strawberries. So, I left."}
{"text":"I was disappointed that this is an 'order and we'll deliver' restaurant if you order something they have to prepare fresh.   If you order from the pre-made arena, you carry your own tray to your table.  (As someone else mentioned, it's kind of a \"French Panera\".
I opted for a Cafe Sampler with Caesar salad, a cup of French onion soup and a Spinach and Artichoke Friand (served with a little cup of the tomato/basil soup as a dipping sauce).
The salad was good (not the best Caesar I've had), the soup very tasty though not warm enough and the Friand (puff) pastry tended to be a bit on the chewy side and the contents lacking in flavor.
It was 'ok'.   It's not someplace I'm anxious to return to, but I'll probably give it another try sometime."}
{"text":"Love the vibe of this place. Friendly staff. Great food and love all the yummy desserts!! Delicious go to place."}
{"text":"The ordering process was a little unusual and the items were hard to pronounce unless your French, but the food was amazing!  I can't say the name of the dish I ordered but it was a balsamic marinated chicken breast with a mushroom sauce.  It was amazing! The dish came with some very delicious green beans and some mediocre rice.  The tea was freshly brewed and delicious.  I also had what looked like a pice of chocolate cake; I was not impressed at all.  The quantity of food was not impressive, but the quality of the main dish more than made up for it.  I will return to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Great French cafe open on Chandler Blvd close to mall and next to Potbelly Sandwiches. Breakfast is served all day. The quiche Lorraine is so light and tasty! Strawberry and spinach  salad was simple but delicious. We had the lemon tart which is the best Ive ever had, a chocolate tart which was not overpowering which was delicious, and a yogurt fruit parfait which was great! Staff is very professional and the atmosphere is not pretentious. Highly recommend! it would be my choice over Tempe Public Market; more price conscious and better variety for any age! Looking forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"Overall a disappointing brunch. 

Pros:  lots of options on menu, lots of pastry choices.

Cons: brunch food was just fair, pastries much better. Coffee was scalding hot. So insanely hot that it could do damage to a person and the restaurant. 

Overall:  check the coffee temperature prior to putting it in your mouth. I would return for pastries and espresso drinks but would opt elsewhere for any type of meal."}
{"text":"We usually love La Madeline.  This one has good food, but mediocre service.  The way this one is set up is confusing and the employees ignore customers.  I hope it turns around soon because these are great restaurants."}
{"text":"Went for lunch.  You order at counter and they bring food to your table.  Food was good.  No complaints.  Would go back for sure."}
{"text":"Maybe we ate the wrong things!  We stopped in today for lunch.  Agree they are still new and have some service issues.  It was fairly crowded and the ordering process is odd. A lady takes your order and enters it on a pad and gives you a number.  You then walk down a cafeteria style line and tell them what you ordered (even thought you just told the first person seconds before).  Depending on what you order the counter people may give it to you (salads, a few items and soups). You then go to pay and get drinks.  One issue is you never see the desserts!  So while I got my cup soup and half sandwich from the cafeteria style line, 
my partner just got his soup as his item needed to be made. Our French Onion soup was just ok.  Wasn't hot, barely warm.  I had the \"special\" 1/2 Croque Monsiuer. It was just ok and again just warm.  I finished my entire meal before my partners 1/2 French dip arrived.  His food was also just ok and warm.   Maybe opening week issues, but not sure the food impressed me enough to try again."}
{"text":"Not my most favorite lunch spot, but worth another visit to try them out again. When my friends asked me where we went for Mother's Day brunch, I figured \"French Panera\" would be enough to describe La Madeleine. My aunt really likes coming here, and since she's a mom, she and my mom had say over where we ate for their day. 
It's cute on the inside, it reminds me of a little European bistro. 

I don't understand their concept of getting in a line, ordering with someone, being provided a beeper, walking down with a tray, then finally paying and sitting down to wait. Just a little weird. 

Forewarning since this is a brunchy/Frenchy place, there are bread/carb selections out the wazoo! The croissants are HUGE, but in my opinion not consistent. The complimentary one my mom received was great, but the one that came with my meal was not. I played it safe getting the Country French Breakfast- eggs, sausage and the French hash brown. The hash brown was my favorite part of my meal- it had a lot of seasoning and was crispy. I took a bite of my mom's Sampler items, wasn't terribly impressed either.

Our family appreciated the manager going above and beyond for one of my 3 cousins as my aunt accidentally forgot to order lunch for one of them (#MomOfTheYear). The manager, being a middle child himself, made sure my cousin got his soup AND a tarte ASAP for being the \"forgotten middle child\". At least we were able to laugh about that."}
{"text":"When I lived in Dallas this was a great place for breakfast and bakery goodies. Glad to see they have opened up and so close to my work. Food is excellent and service is a bit slow, but just opened up."}
{"text":"Just went to the new restaurant in Chandler was so looking forward to it and complete disappointment! Expensive cafeteria style. YUCK great way to ruin French food."}
{"text":"I came here with my mom and sister for brunch and BOY was it packed! I have been to La Madeline before and had an okay experience, but this location has changed my mind for the better! The service was great and the food is fantastic as well, it is a bit on the pricey side but well worth it! Try their fruit parfait and croissant sandwiches, they're so good! Clean, professional, and ambient location for breakfast and lunch with friends or family!"}
{"text":"Yes!!! It's back and the food is just as good as I can remember!!!! Staff polite great location."}
{"text":"Just went for dessert. Creme brûlée is one of the best I've tasted. They also had a nice sampling of breads and jams. Cute place. Definitely want to go back to try the lunch."}
{"text":"Wow, this place is nasty with a capital N. If you like mayonnaise on everything then this place is your spot. Everything about my visit was not enjoyable; the food, the ambiance, the help, the parking lot, etc. Also, seeing a manager reprimand a cashier in front of customers is very uncouth."}
{"text":"The ordering system here is horrendous.  Instead of ordering everything at the register then sitting down and having it brought to you, you have to order certain things at certain locations.  I.E. sandwiches at the front, then salads down the line, then remind the person ringing everything up what you had, what was part of a combo, what wasn't.

Overly confusing and annoying.  Food is average, just go to Panera Bread."}
{"text":"Is there a zero star option?? Extremely poor customer service. 35 minnutes and never even received my order. When asking for a refund they refused to refund my drink.. I will say they did offer a 10 dollar gift card for my next visit. That was very nice. But I was not even offered anything else from the menu. Just a \" yeah sorry that didn't come out. It's new and we are new\"... I'll tell you. Not a great start or impression. I will probably not return. The food must be good. The rest of my table did enjoy their meals that they received."}
{"text":"This restaurant just opened near me and I was intrigued so I thought I'd give it a try. Luckily I made it just before the lunch rush at about 11:30 a.m. 
There was already a decent crowd and then, BAM! Tons of people. I can see why though. The food was hot and fresh and delicious. Decently priced. 
So here's how it works...you order with a host and then go pay at the counter.  You are given cups for your drinks and you gather napkins, silverware, etc and choose your own table.  When the food is ready, it is brought to you at your table. No complaints about the food. I had the pesto pasta with chicken. It comes with a big ole French bread and you will be full if you eat it all. I saved half because I wanted to try the dessert!
I chose the coconut creme cake which did not disappoint! I love coconut so for me this was nirvana. Moist and fresh and chock full of coconut. It is very rich so I recommend sharing with a friend.
The only complaint was that it was very noisy. It's all wood flooring so the noise just echos and the busser decided to use the table next to us as his bus station. I ended up politely asking him to leave since I didn't want to hear plates crashing while I was eating.
The only other thing is that parking is sparse. It's a tiny lot to accommodate the restaurant and the other businesses in the strip.  But overall, I loved it. It was fun trying a new place and the food is tasty. I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"I was there for the grand opening today. They gave us little menus with specific items we could order, presumably to test different parts of the menu. I didn't like anything on my menu except the tomato basil soup so I just ordered that, and they gave me three cups of it (to keep order sizes consistent, I assume). I was okay with this, but EVERY staff member had to make a comment about my food choice, which was a bit annoying after the second or third time. I finally just said, \"oh, yeah, I'm just a picky eater I guess\". 

When I went to the bakery to get my dessert, that person I had made my comment to said, \"oh, here comes Miss Picky Eater.\" This just really rubbed me the wrong way, especially after having so many comments about my food choices already. I felt almost judged for my choice in what to eat, and it made me pretty uncomfortable to be there. 

This is a shame, too, because the food was really good, and I had been really excited for this place to open. I'm not sure if I will return, but hopefully this was just a one time thing."}
{"text":"Not a fan. First time here and the experience was confusing and not great.  Two lines - one for take out and one for dining in. We got in the dining in line and thought we would be seated but we were greeted by a little woman who asked very quietly what we wanted to order. I told her we had not been her before and did not know what we wanted. She then pointed to a stand with menus. So standing in line we looked through the menu and picked 3 things. She then in her whispery voice told us we could pick up the stuff in the buffet. So then we moved to the buffet and chose the quiche - Unbelievably dry and unedible! They brought us another and it was just as bad. Not sure how long they keep them under the heat lamp but it is too long!! My daughter ordered from the kitchen and her food was not great either. The poor manager tried to make it better but all in all - probably will not return."}
{"text":"This spot is more like a glorified Panera. It was okay. Left slightly underwhelmed but I'd certainly give it another shot.

Specifically about the food:
I just was not impressed. If there's a thing a place that calls itself a French bakery should get right, it's (well, everything) the eggs. Receiving very over easy (gross/runny) when asking for over medium may seem particular.....but they're totally different and that my friend is a rookie mistake. Oh well, like I said....I'd have another go :-) !"}
{"text":"These guys are still new (open 1month) but they definitely need HELP! Scrambled eggs are clearly poured out of a hi sodium container. Had the scrambled eggs redone. Chef claimed not to add salt. Still inedible. Ordered an omelette; got a crepe. That was good because it cut the salt in the eggs. Bacon was sent back twice to make it \"extra crispy\". Still drooped when held by one end. Coffee was excellent. Croissant was OK. Dining room attendant (Miss B) tried. Nice atmosphere. Attempt at being French comes across as fake."}
{"text":"So glad to have La Madeleine back in the valley. We used to go to the one on Camelback long ago till they tore it down for a bank of all things. The food was great and the staff was very attentive. Looking forward to riding over to enjoy breakfast for many more weekends to come. Sit by the fireplace at the long table and enjoy the sourdough bread with some blackberry jam as you dive into the delicious French fare. Hopefully we get more locations added to the valley."}
{"text":"This was a perfect place to have lunch after a day of shopping! I had the Croque Monsieur sandwich with a Caesar salad and a cup of lentil and kale soup! All was very delicious!  They also had some beautiful desserts, but I had already made a piggy of myself! So I didn't get any!  Decorations were nice, the employees were very friendly and helpful! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"\"The French and their food. They put each meal on a pedestal.\" ? Giada De Laurentiis, Paris!

Ever since Georgie M. started posting pictures of this place, I've been wanting to stop by.  I mean a French bakery and café?  It's a no brainer!  And with more than 70 locations nationwide, let's give it a try!

The three of us stopped by for lunch on a sunny Friday afternoon and we had ordered a Croque Monsieur (Sliced smoked ham and Swiss with garlic cream sauce baked on fresh wheatberry bread) with Tomato Basil Pesto Pasta Salad, the Country French Breakfast (Two eggs cooked-to-order with a Potato Galette, bacon or sausage and a butter croissant), a cup of their Signature Tomato Basil Soup (A cream based vegetarian soup made with vine ripened tomatoes, fresh cream, and fresh basil), and Cinnamon Croissant French Toast (Freshly baked butter croissants, dipped in sweet egg custard, sprinkled with cinnamon sugar and baked until caramelized. Topped with fresh fruit, maple syrup and whipped cream).  We had also ordered a ton of desserts like the Chocolate Tart, Lemon Tart, a Crème Brûlée Cheesecake, and a Crème Brûlée.  

Everything was tasty for the most part, although it does cost you a few more nickels [I think I spent at least $50 on two of us].  The decor is adorable and there is plenty of seating.  The staff here are also pretty friendly but I do think they need more bussers.  All the tables in the little room we sat at went uncleaned for the two hours or so that we were there.  All in all, I would definitely come back.  I'd probably pass on some things like the tomato basil soup and the chocolate tart.  Nothing against the two dishes but it wasn't anything spectacular like their crème brûlée and crème brûlée cheesecake.  Oh goodness... the crème brûlée.  *saliva gurgle*

\"'What's that?' said Ron, pointing at a large dish of some sort of shellfish stew that stood beside a large steak-and-kidney pudding.
'Bouillabaisse,' said Hermione.
'Bless you,' said Ron.
'It's French,' said Hermione.\"

{"text":"Went back Sunday. This time I took my husband with me & wee tried a couple more items on the menu. Again, it was super delish. There was a problem with my order - I'd ordered the half salad & Friand but was given a half a quiche instead. Weird mistake but they took care of me. They gave me a whole Friand instead of the half one I'd ordered to make up for the mistake. THAT is good customer service. And everyone is so friendly! My husband ordered his eggs over easy & said they were cooked perfectly. According to him, that can be hard to accomplish - but he was very happy with his breakfast. Anyway, La Madeleine is definitely a joint to put on your \"must try\" list. For me, it's now on my \"favorite\" list! Yummy!"}
{"text":"This place is super good! It's so cute. It reminds me of being in Paris which just makes me happy. You can order pastries in a separate line so if you wanna just stop in for one of those it's perfect. We tried lots of things and all were good. You have to get the strawberries romanoff"}
{"text":"Friendly welcome and overview of the menu. The pastries are exquisite and very tasty. The ham and cheese danish is fantastic -- worth the wait, slow service, rude manager and forgotten meal. They appear to be working out several kinks in their system. Laurie, the barista, is lovely! She kindly remade a macchiato that was served cold rather than hot. She also completed our order, when we were forgotten by others.
Once they iron out the glitches, should be an enjoyable experience. 
Thanks to Laurie, we shall return."}
{"text":"This was one of my favorite places to go several years back, but sadly they had closed all of their Arizona locations, bar the one inside the airport. I was delighted to see that this location had been opened. 

While it's plenty far enough from my side of town, I made the drive down to Chandler to see if my nostalgia was overselling how much I actually enjoyed this place. Thankfully, it was not.

LOCATION: My only real complaint would be that it is located in a bit of an annoying spot - the fact it's located all the way down in Chandler aside. Though it is right off the 101 and close to the Chandler Fashion mall, the small strip it is located within is only accessible from the south side of Chandler Blvd. that heads towards the east. Coming from the 101, will require you to make a u-turn before being able to turn into the parking lot. Hardly a big deal, but just something of note. I arrived around 5:00 PM and had no trouble finding parking, and there was a decent amount of people at the restaurant. 

SERVICE/ATMOSPHERE: The service was friendly and helpful, though the ordering style is a bit unique and thus a tad confusing at first. However, it seems to move efficiently and it gets you your salad, soups, and bakery items immediately while your entrée is prepared. The servers make sure to say bonjour and bon appétit. Sure, it's a little too cute and folksy, but I enjoy it. The folksy service complements the overall atmosphere of the restaurant. It has a rustic feel with plenty of countryside touches. There's ample seating and a cozy fireplace that splits two of the seating areas. 

FOOD: I ordered the caesar salad, a quiche florentine, and a chocolate chip cookie. I've had some of the entrée and sandwich dishes well in the past and from what I remember those did not disappoint. When it comes to what I ordered during this visit, the same remains true. La Madeleine has my absolute favorite caesar salad. It has the right blend of cream, garlic, and tang to give it a rich flavor. My memory did not betray me here. As for the quiche, it was rather delectable. The egg and cheese had a smooth and soft consistency - almost creamy. The spinach was distributed evenly throughout the quiche and each bite maintained a constant consistency. However, the crust is almost the best part. It doesn't have an overpowering bready taste and the texture is moist on the inside and flaky on the outside. It has a buttery and subtle flavor that perfectly complements the eggy part of the quiche. Overall, both dishes were fantastic. Finally, I had my chocolate chip cookie and it was pretty much just a good cookie. It has a nice size and thickness. The chocolate chunks are large and the inside of the cookie was dense but soft. It meets the standards of what you'd want in a cookie.

Overall, the experience was a good one. I'm very happy to have La Madeleine back in the Phoenix area and though it is located rather far from my part of the valley, I'm sure I'll be making a trip over every now and then."}
{"text":"No dissatisfaction here. Went in for coffee and dessert with friends. The coconut creme cake had a wonderful balance of sweetness with plenty of coconut sprinkled atop. A return trip is planned to try their dinner fare."}
{"text":"The line was crazy long and only one person was working the registers. It seemed like they were new. Also the pastries were meh! I would not go again unless invited."}
