{"text":"Very impressed with their quick and attentive service. Prices are reasonable and food is pretty good. Lots of choices on the menu. Will recommend to friends."}
{"text":"The new management has done wonders!  It is bright and modern and food is excellent.  This is my favourite Chinese restaurant and default place to bring visiting friends and relatives."}
{"text":"My family and I dined at JAM last Saturday. It was a bit of a drive for us, but we heard it is under new management so we decided to give it a try.  The restaurant is tucked away in the corner of a small plaza, but the interior decor is nice and spacious. The service was pretty good and the staff was friendly. A couple of the ladies who were pushing the dim sum carts were able to speak some English, too (they assumed we weren't able to speak Chinese).  It was almost 1 o'clock by the time we arrived. We were surprised to see carts were still being rolled out continuously. You can even order specific items if you don't see it on the carts.   All of the food was fresh and tasted great. JAM offers a variety of staple dim sum dishes -- your typical steamed buns, other steamed items, fried items, congee, desserts, and more -- plus a few other 'new and interesting' items like the BBQ pork pineapple buns.   Small dim sum dishes cost $2.60, medium $3.60, and large items cost $5.00. Fried rice and noodles are offered as well. More importantly, you can get 10% off if you pay with cash. :)  I will definitely return to JAM for another dim sum date with my family, however, not as often as I would like because of the distance from our home!"}
{"text":"Vinimos buscando Din Sum y es muy fresco y de bien rico. Muy satisfechos  Éramos 4 personas y quedamos muy satisfechos personalmente recomiendo el rollo de camarón."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised by this little restaurant tucked away into a small strip mall.  We ordered 7 dishes of dim sum which comes around on carts. My only complaint is really that the carts did not come around with new selection as often as I would have liked and as a result the food was a touch luke-warm. However if you're not seeing something you want on the carts you can just make specific requests from a waitress (the staff in the red tops as the black tops only serve food) - our ordered food came out very quickly!  The food overall was very good - true cantonese dim sum without that weird MSG after taste."}
{"text":"My go to place for Dim Sum. A great variety, always hot and tasty. Helpful staff, even if it's busy. I've gone to other places, yes, even in Markham, but here it's very consistent and reasonably priced. Real comfort food, for me anyway."}
{"text":"I found the dim sum here to be really good.  The portions are larger than some other places and the prices are reasonable. I was having a late lunch so ordered from the paper menu.  I liked that they had eggplant stuffed with shrimp mouse on its own, because usually it is grouped with bean curd and green pepper, but eggplant is my favorite.  The steamed beef rice noodle roll had a generous amount of beef filling.  Both dishes were served with the correct sauce. Chicken foot dish had 4 full feet and a nice sauce.   Everything was hot and tasty. I will be returning soon."}
{"text":"This is Happy Jade restaurant reopened under new management!  We have been coming here for decades, and this has always been our close to home go to for dim sum. They're under new management, been open for a week, have overhauled most of the staff and done an efficient job with renos!  Food was definitely good and hits the spot. I want to give them a 5 because we love this place, but they're simply not in that class of restaurant, but for where it is, and for the price - its always the solid option in east end sauga/west Etobicoke.   Looks like they have a renewed focus and are doing well! Great staff and service as usual. Happy to be here and to see it bustling!"}
{"text":"Although the name has changed, I have been going to this Chinese restaurant for years. It's a great place for dim sum!  Went here for a late lunch this Christmas. The dim sum was fresh and delicious. Tried the usual selections of dumplings, sticky rice, fried shrimp, and more. Everything that we selected from the dim sum carts tasted great.  Although, we did order some pork and duck from the menu. It was ok, but a little salty and the pork wasn't as hot as I would have liked. I think next time we will stick to the food from the dim sum carts.  Aside from that, the actual dim sum was very tasty. Service was also very fast and friendly.  If you want good dim sum, give this place a try."}
{"text":"A fired told me about it, so we came to check it out. Not bad. Standard dim sum. We came a little later than lunch, so the place was not busy. The service was prompt and efficient. To be fair, only two of us for so we did not get a wide variety of dishes. So nothing expressive food wise.  We are definitely coming back, as hubby likes Dim Sum for dinner and there aren't many places serve Dim Sum at dinner time."}
{"text":"From reading others reviews I wanted to try this place out.  Unfortunately I was disappointed, so needless to say I will not be ordering from here ever again.  The biggest disappointment was the deep-fried crab claw. For $4.75 each I expected more than just tiny piece crab meat and a huge amount of jelly batter, (See pictures). For being that expensive I was expecting something a lot better tasting and a lot more worth my money.  Second disappointment was the Fried noodles with Seafood. The description reads \"Shrimps and scallops mixed with noodles in a hot wok.\" Being as don't like squid I was happy with ordering this dish. When It arrived it was loaded with squid.4 pieces of scallop and 5 shrimp. The rest of it was squid. I was so annoyed. If your like me and don't like squid make sure to tell them because despite what the description is there will be squid.  The spring rolls, shrimp roll, chicken wings and shrimp fired rice were fine. Nothing exciting or mind blowing just meh.  My husband ordered the sweet & sour pork with pineapple and was a little sad with the lack of pineapple.  All in all we will not be going back and do not recommend this place to anyone. See pictures for all foods mentioned.  Till next time. XOXO Happy Eats."}
{"text":"Good dim sum. The service is good for a Chinese restaurant. My husband and I were on our way home from Muskoka and decided to stop in the area for some dim sum. I am glad I found JAM on Yelp because we didn't have enough cash and thank goodness JAM accepts credit card. We really enjoyed our brunch there. P.S gosh why do so many restaurants in Mississauga area don't take credit cards?!   I have been to other dim sum places in the area, and I would say this place is the best. Of course, this still doesn't compared to some places in Markham."}
{"text":"If I was able to rate a 0 star I would. I am of Chinese descent and felt completely discriminated due to my inability to speak their language. We overhead the staff name our table the white table and gossiping. When you grow up listening to Cantonese it's not hard to understand the slang and swear words. We wanted to pick up shrimp rice rolls for my grandma and was told to wait for the cart to come around. 30 mins later my husband went to pay the bill and order it for take out. We waited another 20 mins and see a cart pushing out the shrimp rice rolls and asked why we didn't get ours. The staff keep asking why we were not leaving and  we said we were waiting for our shrimp rice rolls... the staff only cared about turning over the table and rushing us out and failed to realized that we were waiting for over 45 mins. The manager threw our take out bag at me and walked away because I asked why they didn't just pack our order instead of making us wait. That's customer service for you.     My daughter went to the bathroom and said that the toilets were not flushed and that they had toilet paper on the floor. And ran out because there was a mouse. I can't speak for her but that was the tipping point for us not to return"}
{"text":"Had dim sum at this restaurant. Food and service was good. Price reasonable in this part of Mississauga"}
{"text":"I wouldn't not even give them one star but can't move on with out rating them....  Found this place on Yelp with 4 star rating and thought it should be fine for a nice dinner.  WRONG!!!! We ordered a whole crab, 4 seasons string beans and the sucking pig feet.  The string beans came out first and we ended up needed to return as all the beans were not fresh and over cooked.  So the captain was nice to replaced with something else for us.  Then asked three times for chili sauce before we got them.  The most unbelievable thing was when  they brought the \"whole crab\" to us, it was without any crab claws, no wonder the dish was so small.  We told them and the boss lady came out and said: \"this is how we received from our supplier\"  nothing we can do.  EXCUSE me!  You accepted the produce from your supplier because you are stupid, it doesn't mean your customer is stupid.  We have been visiting many restaurants all over the world for the last 40 years and this is the first time we ordered a whole crab without any claws.    Since nothing they can do but as a consumer, we can definitely can share our experience with the public.  Don't forget we are living in the innovative world."}
{"text":"If you have A LOT of time to wait for simple dim sum dishes, steamed dumplings and congee, then this restaurant is for you. We were craving dim sum and we thought it would very busy considering Chinese New Year but it wasn't. The service and food prep was extremely S-L-O-W. After ordering one more dish, we just got up in frustration and paid. Just a meek apology. No bye. No thanks. Nothing! Terrible service. Way too slow to just steam up dumplings!"}
{"text":"Planned a weekend brunch to Happy Jade with a group of friends and when we got here we noticed the name change. We hesitantly decided to give it a try and it will be my last visit unfortunately. My family/friends and I have been coming to Happy Jade for the past decade whether it be for dim sum, dinner or drunk munchies and they never failed my taste buds. This time around there was barely any selection - same ol carts rollin around. With the few plates we got, the taste and quality was meh. We wrapped it up after that. Too bad so sad! Nice renovations though."}
{"text":"Tired of typical emotional distress you experience at Chinese restaurants? I know I am, so it was refreshing to visit a Chinese restaurant that actually put some effort into providing a pleasant experience to diners. I came here for dim sum and was pleasantly surprised by the food and experience. The must haves are the BBQ porks buns and the golden egg yolk buns. Items come around on carts, but if there's something you want and you don't see it on a cart, you can request for it to be made just be patient as it may take a some time for it to get to you."}
{"text":"Here are the facts: I wanted dimsum. It was Friday night at 6pm.  I was not going to China Town  7km would take an hour. Jam restaurant was also 7km away. Ratings were decent.  30+ reviews.  They can't all be doctored.  Didn't read the reviews. And so into the car we piled and went.   And boom, the rest was history.   First of all there does need to be a disclaimer that the servers were absolutely rude. But not like in your face rude, it was like we gotta get $*it done rude. And they weren't super busy, maybe 1/3 full, but everyone has demands so it was a touch on the slow side. A big touch. However as customers left the service got a lot better. They became friendlier.   We had 7 dimsum dishes, Peking duck (lettuce wrap with the meat), stir fried clams, and fried noodles with beef. And everything (almost) was exquisite. And the things that weren't I think were still good, just not to our liking. For example we had a fried taro stuffed with pork dimsum dish that we thought was too greasy and mediocre at best. Apparently one of their more popular dishes. The snow pea shoot dumpling was a favorite, as was the shrimp and chive. The Peking duck was served with only scallions, no cucumbers - quite alright with me.   Also to note, they did not have plastic cups or dishes, just spoons and forks. They do have high chairs, but that is the extent of their accommodation for families with young children.   It is a good chinese restaurant with that Chinese restaurant smell that punches your nose and makes you go ah~ like when you finally sit on your couch after a long day. Solid. 4.5  no problem."}
{"text":"By far the best Chinese restaurant in Mississauga.  Super clean, top notched service - that is almost impossible to say about any Chinese restaurant.  Food is class above all the Chinese restaurants in Mississauga.   I am having hard time finding the words to describe but I dare you to try this place and disagree with me."}
{"text":"Having always gone to Chinatown or Markham for dim sum, we decided to venture West of Toronto today due to traffic and street festivals. We were not disappointed at all.  The dim sum is delicious, great priced, and the staff are friendly.  As a mixed race couple, sometimes we have trouble going to Asian restaurants as the staff don't all speak English well enough to describe the dishes, or they make us feel out of place.  The owner here is super friendly, the staff were all very courteous and there is plenty of parking. We will not hesitate to make this our regular dim sum restaurant."}
{"text":"Celebrated a family birthday here a few weeks ago, had originally booked Blue Lagoon, but changed due to bad reviews! Very happy we did - had an excellent meal - ordered the dinner for 6 - a great display of lobster, fish, duck and pork. We had also included some dim sum for appetizers and enjoyed everything!  Service was very attentive and polite - and we even had a nice chat with the owner on the way out! The decor is bright and modern and great for big dinners! Will be planning another visit soon to try the lunch dim sum !"}
{"text":"I would give this place 2 different rating if I could.   I mean for Dim Sum it's fresh and decent but not quite up to the standards you could get in Markham. I would give it a 4 star for the Dim Sum alone as the place tends to quite busy too then. For dinner it was a different story and not busy. The room is done up nicely and service was attentive but still.... nearly $20 for a sizzling beef plate ? The food is average but overpriced at dinner with relatively small portions.  Basically this is no Congee Queen ! Perhaps if they had some sort of dinner specials that they promoted in the evenings people might get a better night time experience. For now stick to the Dim Sum."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner tonight, and had amazing food.  Since I had amazing food, you may wonder why the 3 star rating. It's simple - they sell shark fin soup.  I spent HOURS looking at dim sum restaurants in the west end and checking menus for shark fin soup and was excited when I found JAM and saw no sign of that on their online menus or menu photos that were posted on various sites.  We ordered our dim sum, then I was checking the main menu and found a whole page on Shark Fin.  My husband and I don't support the use of shark fin and don't support restaurants that sell it. Sadly, we won't be going back. Regardless of how great the dim sum is.    I thought it was worth sharing this in case anyone else checking out reviews here was also trying to avoid shark fin."}
{"text":"Probably the best dim sum in Mississauga. Good decor with cleanly interior presentation. I enjoyed a variety of dishes. Only price seems a little higher then places in Toronto. But overall it satisfied my cravings for good Chinese food, without having to drive into Toronto. Highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Came her for dimsum and a set dinner for 8 people. The service is prompt and attentive. You will still need to waive down a waiter if you would like something but the environment is nice as they recently renovated. Their dim sum is push cart however you can also order from paper if you ask. That annoyed me a bit because when we asked, they replied \" what would you like?\" - this made it apparent that this service was only for a few folks. For dinner, in the set menu for 8 people there was Peking duck cooked two ways, birds nest (taro nest with seafood and broccoli ), soy chicken with these delicious candied walnuts, vegetables, fried rice and Cantonese chow mein. There was plenty of food and it was delicious. The service in the evening was wonderful however it wasn't very busy for a Sunday evening. I also loved how there was no wait for dim sum as well."}
{"text":"Taste 4/5 We were quite happy with the dim sum we took. Was so hungry didn't take pictures for everything. The fried octopus was very hard to eat.   Only downside is the wait time- whether it's to get a seat or even the food.  You do not select the dim sum from the list. There are people coming around with their carts with dimsum to select. We had to wait long for another selection to come. But by the time newer were coming now we were done. But overall not good for a first time"}
{"text":"Excellent dim sum! Very clean and recently switched ownership. New decor is very nice. Service is attentive and quick. Ordered dim sum items off menus and food was brought out quickly and pipping hot. Everything was fresh and delicious. Will be back again soon."}
{"text":"No.  Just no.  We followed Waze that mapped us here through the back alley and saw the cook hanging out in the back sitting outside looking unsanitary.  We saw the kitchen from the back also and it did not look clean at all.  We went into the front and it was pretty deserted on a Sunday.  The prices on the menu seemed fine, looking at the few other patrons the portions were on the smaller side, it just was kind of not worth the risk.  We turned around and left, so maybe the food is good.  We don't know, we left based on what we saw."}
{"text":"Came back after a few months.  It seems like they changed chefs because the food has gotten a lot better since the last time I was here."}
{"text":"I would not usually eat Cantonese chow mein anywhere else as my husband makes the best Cantonese chow mein. However, I was amazed how tasty and special Jam made this dish. The noodles stayed crispy with just the right amount of sauce over them... I had a happy meal today"}
{"text":"I really like this place. Of course, I love Chinese restaurants in general, but this place has a lot going for it.  First, as everyone rightfully mentions, the decor is modern, looks great while not being at all over the top. It's basically the opposite of sitting at the drab Tremendous Chinese Restaurant. (And actually, like Tremendous, JAM House is open late - 1 or 2 am - so this would be a very intriguing option for late night Chinese food.)  I've had dim sum here on several occasions, and all the staple dishes are very solid. In particular, the tripe is really nicely gingery/scalliony, and thus better than most of the dim sum tripes I've had recently. They also have some very unique dishes: coconut bun/cha siu bao mashup (which is all the craze at the cool dim sum places these days) and century egg puff pastry (like the one with cha siu, but filled with century egg instead) come to mind.  Staff here is really nice and the vibe is positive - something I can rarely say about a Chinese restaurant. That left a really good impression on me."}
{"text":"The BEST peking duck I've ever had. This place reminded me of a much nicer Tremendous and Sam Woo. The food was great, and the service is SO good. Absolutely love this place!!"}
{"text":"3.5-4*, rounded up for being better than I was expecting!  Review is for all-day dim sum.  You may have to ask for the ds menu after peak hours.  I cannot comment on their dinner menu, but apparently it is not as good.  It was quite quiet on a Thursday evening.  Only a few tables were occupied.    I cannot remember the name of the Chinese restaurant that JAM took over, but new owners have repainted and in general, interior looks renewed.  I saw a familiar face, either the assistant manager or the manager of Summit Gardens.  So you can ensure they know what they're doing.  Neither food nor staff are \"green\".  Food was good, nothing too greasy, but as per each post-dim sum, I did feel like I needed a walk.  Bean Curd rolls, shrimp/chive dumplings were a couple of some better dishes.  Would not hesitate to go back for either dim sum &/or dinner!"}
{"text":"After searching for somewhere to have a nice Christmas lunch, my family and I finally found this place, one of the only few restaurants open on a holiday. If you are on a tight schedule but want a sit-in restaurant experience with fast service, this place would be ideal for you. From the outside, its physical appearance is not very attractive and the place is stashed away in a plaza with other stores surrounding it. However, once we were inside, I soon realized that I had judged a book by its cover. From the inside, it was the total opposite. The room was big and spacious and our wait time to get the 5 of us seated was less than 10 minutes. Their washroom cleanliness also exceeded my expectations. Our lunch was delicious too and it's so convenient how staff members pass by every table with all types of food on trolleys so we didn't have to leave our seats. I tried their sticky rice, various dim sum pieces, and duck and my favorite was the shrimp dim sum. The duck was tasty & hopefully I can come back to enjoy more of it in the future when I no longer have a toothache. Overall, I would highly recommend this place if you're looking for good quality dim sum/asian food that is reasonably priced."}
{"text":"I think this place may be better than Tremendous!! Amazing service, and food is sooooooo good!! Theyre open late too and I dont think many people know about this late night gem."}
{"text":"We found this gem on Yelp and decided to give it a try last weekend. We arrived just before 12pm and we were seated immediately which was surprising, as we normally wait for awhile at Blue Lagoon, which is our usual Mississauga dim sum place. The dim sum is served push cart and since we sat close to the entrance of the kitchen, all the carts came to us fairly quickly. They have the usual dim sum fare: har gow,siu mai, cheung fun, congee,egg tarts...and they were decent. We were in and out within an hour which is great, especially with a fussy toddler in tow. Will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Nice modern decor.  Food is good here... service alone gives Blue Lagoon a run for their money.  Great place for dim sum and dinner menu... traditional HK style chinese food."}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant location twice. The first time was probably over three years ago, when it was Happy Jade. A colleague drove us over there.   I remember the weird way of entering the small plaza. From work, we drove southbound along Dixie. You then make a left where the DOT Furniture is, and you snake your way over to the restaurant.  My manager has made it a habit for our team to go out every Friday for lunch. We aren't obligated to go, but it's a nice way for us to bond and eat yummy food. Last week, we visited JAM for dim sum.  I drove. My memory served me correctly. Thank goodness that the DOT Furniture store is still there!  I parked and we all headed inside. We were promptly seated. With the ownership change, you no longer see the cheap tablecloths on tables and shabbiness that Happy Jade exuded. There are new light fixtures, pretty drapes, and nice tablecloths.  You can either pick what dim sum items you want from the carts that staff roll around. Otherwise, you need to mark your selection on a card and give it to your server.  We were a group of five. We chose fourteen items. All but one item came to us. You can't win 'em all!  The dim sum was fantastic. I didn't know that if you ordered the deep-fried crab claw that you only get one. So, I ate it. So good! I was in heaven.  There wasn't a dim sum item that I didn't like. The food was delicious and everything came quickly.  Naturally, you wash everything down with jasmine tea. I love tea. I feel odd when I go a day without it.  I recommend coming here. The dim sum is fresh and yummy.  (39)"}
{"text":"Google maps might not get you here. You can also google Service Ontario and it is right next door in a strip mall at the intersection of Dixie and Dundas.  I really enjoyed the Peking duck, (but I might be biased as I'm a big fan), the fish and veggie stir fry, the garlic bok choy, and the deep fried calamari. Other dishes such as their red bean soup, the deep fried crab claw, the pork tenderloin and the fried shrimp were pretty good as well.   Atmosphere is nice with covered chairs, lazy Susans and white tablecloths while the service is fast. I'd come here for the food!"}
{"text":"This place used to be Happy Jade, but now under new management. I went here on Valentine's Day for brunch with my family.  The interior is really nice, and more modern than before. It has a cozy feeling too it, which I like. Also everything was really clean. The food was really good, everything was cook well, and tasted fresh. The service here was really good for me today. The staff were really friendly and fast. Overall, this will be my go to dim sum place. I will def come back again."}
{"text":"4.5 stars. My mom's favourite.  She loves the free range chicken. Solid dim sum and reliable dinner dishes. Generous portions. Pleasant room and efficient staff for HK Chinese style dining. Best in the area. We are regulars and order for delivery frequently."}
{"text":"The wife and I were in Mississauga to run some errands and decided we wanted to eat some dim sum.  We opened Yelp and decided to hit up this restaurant. The interior decor of the restaurant was pretty outdated but don't be fooled!  This place is a push cart dim sum joint.  Yes you heard me, PUSH CART! It's very hard to find dim sum places that offer this kind of old school service nowadays.  What else was nice was that many of the servers actually spoke English, even the elders which was a nice surprise.   They offer your typical dim sum dishes and they were all very delicious.  My favourite was the chicken feet.  They were super tender and very well marinated.  I would come back just for that.  Another dish that stood out for me was the Siu mai, highly recommended!  Overall, we had a nice experience. Food was good and service was quick and attentive. We would definitely come back whenever we are in Sauga."}
{"text":"The dimsum here was surprisingly good. It's difficult to find good quality dimsum in the Etobicoke area, which is closer to us than going up to Markham. I would say the dimsum was better than the Chinatown institutions downtown, but not quite as good as Markham dimsum places. We got the standard dimsum dishes and liked all of them. The service was a bit slow, but I think it's because we were a bit early (got there around 10am), and the food took a while to arrive. When we left, we saw that alot more food was coming out, and some carts were being pushed around as well (ontop of the a la carte ordering)."}
{"text":"Been coming here for dimsum and late night chinese take out and both have been amazing so far!   Dimsum during the day (I believe it's all day) is pretty good. The service is fast and the food comes out hot and fresh. The waiters & waitresses there are a lot nicer than other chinese restaurants, even if you don't speak chinese.   Late night chinese delivery/take out takes the cake here. I've ordered various items from them past 11pm and the one thing that I always consistently get is their hot and sour soup. They make it oh-so-friggin-good!! Some items are hits and misses, i.e. The crispy bbq pork one time was too crispy that it was hard to chew on. Other than that, all the other dishes I've tried is delish!   For delivery, I've been ordering from skip the dishes and it's so convenient! I get to order online & see what the process is (whether theyre prepping the food or where the delivery boy is), making it so much easier for me to track down when my food will be here.   If you live in the area and is looking for a good chinese restaurant, come try this place and you'll be set."}
{"text":"This is a surprisingly good Chinese restaurant in a random strip mall. The food was mostly very good.  We got the dinner combo for six. The Peking duck was pretty decent. The fish and veggie stir fry dish was excellent. The garlic Bok Choy was great as well. The only dishes we didn't like were the sweet and sour tenderloin dish and some fried shrimp dish. Very fresh ingredients used except for the fried shrimp which was dry and tasted old. The tenderloin was way too bland.  Oh and the standouts were the deep fried squid special and the deep fried crab claw which had the biggest pieces of crab meat in them that I've ever seen.  Service was curt but efficient. The atmosphere is pretty nice too. Very modern and recently renovated it looks like.  Although there were a few misses and the service isn't great I'm still giving this place a 5/5 because it's still probably the best non casual chinese restaurant in Mississauga."}
{"text":"The best dim sum in Mississauga.  Push cart style.   Pineapple pork buns are delicious - must try as well as the congee.  Great for dinner as well! Pretty standard dishes but quality made.  It's our go to place we can trust to have a good meal in Sauga."}
{"text":"Very slow!! Looked like they were short of staff.  The food were okay as the dishes were very salty.  Asked for extra chili sauce but took forever so we gave up.  The cashier's attitude was bad.  I am sure we can find other places better tasty of food and services."}
{"text":"Love this place. Finally a good dim sum place close to Etobicoke.   Food Had the usual shrimp dumpling, steamed rice rolls, siu mai, sticky rice and barbeque pork buns. All were delicious and portion size were generous. Love their baked bbq pork buns because not too many places offer this.  Service Friendly and quick. Excellent service!  Price  Cheap and cheerful. For 2 for dim sum it was 30 bux and we were full. Thank goodness for a new place in town so we dont have to drive to Markham. We did go to the previous restaurant that was here and it was okay. This new restaurant is well run. Blue lagoon need to learn how to run a business. Definitely will never go back to blue lagoon. JAM all the way! Will be back to try their maggy style lobsters."}
