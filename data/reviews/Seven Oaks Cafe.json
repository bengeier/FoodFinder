{"text":"Quaint restaurant in old historic home, lovely setting with outdoor seating (dog friendly).  Small inside space and nice small bar.  Recently opened, so menu is limited with mostly sandwiches and wraps (as of June 2018), nice wine and drink selection, peach sangria is divine!  Service was attentive and quick.  Food was fresh and reasonably priced. We tried the veggie wrap with hummus and tuna fish sandwich, corn pudding and bean salad.  Everything was delicious.  Very close to the Stowe Botanical Gardens or the Seven Oaks Trail.. would make a nice outing for anyone."}
{"text":"Ate at this restaurant for the first time yesterday for Sunday brunch. I'm going to address several things in this review - some will be positive and some will be less than positive. The setting is great, it is a restored older home. The interior is decorated nicely and I'm sure as they are in business longer they will add more decorative features with that rustic feel. I believe we were the first guests for the day and arrived at about 10:15 AM. They opened at 10. We were seated at a table for two in one of their dining rooms. The table itself is way too small for two people. When you get the mason jars of water and other drinks on the table when they serve your food in the quaint trays that they use there is no room left for anything. It is extremely tight. Shortly after we arrived another couple came in to be seated at a table for two in the corner. Being larger in size, you could see it was difficult for them to sit comfortably at this very small table. Shortly after that a family of four arrived and were seated at the longer table placed in front of the fireplace. Once the gentleman was seated in his chair that was closest to the larger couple in the corner, his chair back was almost against their table. I would have been extremely uncomfortable and there was no place for the server to even serve the couple in the corner their food without reaching over their heads. Probably needs to be some minor change ups in the table locations for this reason. We also noticed that the other two tables in the room were served a basket of fresh biscuits. We were never offered any biscuits when we arrived. While we did not need them, it would've been nice to have that option. I suspect when we were seated that the biscuits were not ready yet. Need to make sure you're ready for the day when the doors open. Had there been a basket of biscuits placed on the two-seat table, there would've been no room for the trays. My husband ordered the Belmont bowl and I ordered the Bacon egg and cheese on croissant with a side of the cheesy hashbrowns casserole. My husband's bowl was tasty but he felt that the very small sausage link that had been sliced into the bowl would've been better served with actual bulk sausage cooked and crumbled into the mix. My bacon egg and cheese was good and fresh. The cheesy hashbrowns casserole was pretty tasty but there was shaved asiago cheese on top which asiago does not melt very well so with each bite of cheesy casserole I ate a large piece of asiago as well. Flavorful but could use some tweaking on the cheese selection. Overall it was a good experience and we will definitely try again. As with any new venture, there are things that are tried and fail and things that work well. I am a bit surprised since the owners of string bean are involved with this restaurant as well that they would've worked out some of these kinks from past experience."}
{"text":"Wow what a fantastic and fun time we just had :D we had the pleasure of talking with one of the chefs, Hilary, who is a phenomenal! She has such ambition and everything we ate was top tier and beyond delicious. I never had a cinnamon bun as tasty as this one that she made from scratch this morning. Our bartender Kim was incredible and super knowledgeable. Their wine selection is perfect and they also have a some really good beers on tap. Such a beautiful setting with so many beautiful people in the beautiful historic McLean house. Come here with high expectations because they will be met"}
