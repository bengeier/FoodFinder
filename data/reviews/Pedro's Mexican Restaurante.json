{"text":"Pedro's really only deserves two stars, but more on that later.  Don't come to Pedro's in search of authentic Mexican food.  But there are some things on the menu that are perfectly fine should you find yourself here for some reason, at a loss as to what to order.  I would suggest avoiding most of the menu, which is essentially Tex-Mex T.V. dinner-type fare, except with molten cheese-drowned portions that could feed a T-Rex.  I would suggest, instead, the carnitas fajitas: the pork is very tender and flavorful, and the sauteed vegetables are tasty.  Not authentic--but perfectly fine.  They do have a good Tuesday/Thursday margarita special, though the drinks are too sweet for my taste.  I met my S.O. at Pedro's: hence the extra star.  It will always have a special place in my heart, and I'll keep coming back most Tuesdays for trivia night."}
{"text":"The food here is great. I always get the fried cod wrap which is to die for and always end up with the fried ice cream for dessert! Seriously a tradition when both my sister and I are in town. The staff is less than to be desired but the food is worth it."}
{"text":"I'm shocked, nay, dismayed that Pedro's only has 2 stars on here.  It's a solid 2.5 at least.    The key to Pedro's is to go on Thursdays for the half priced margaritas... a pitcher for 9 bucks isn't too bad.    The margaritas were surprisingly fuerte too, so even if their food isn't the best (I had the fajitas and they were ok, nothing great), no one is allowed to complain about a meal that involves a $9 pitcher of margaritas.    

Furthermore, the queso lived up to my velveeta standards... sure you say you want the authentic stuff, but you know you're a little excited when they bring out the yellowey goodness."}
{"text":"Pedros is a decent chain for Mexican Resturants, however it comes no where near the good authentic stuff you can have down south!

Starting off with the chips and salsa is always so good, but so filling, by the time my food comes, its all I can do to eat more!  The tortillas are also to die for, a little butter and they are heaven!

Chick Enchiladas Suiza are the only way to go! I always have a side of corn cakes as they are delicious!"}
{"text":"Worst waiter and service we ever had, he got order wrong and brought new one that was correct and had an attitude.  Didn't comp meal and had bad attitude"}
{"text":"I went after my 21st bday to get a margarita and they just gave me a non-alcoholic one without even asking for id or anything. They just assumed I wasn't old enough but that's why I went there in the first place."}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT HERE!  The food is microwaved and tastes like it came out of a box.  Yes, they have homemade tortillas, but the stomach ailment you suffer from after visiting here is totally not worth it.  Even the drinks are watered down and the place is full of viejitos.

Instead, take a short drive to Cuco's on Buckeye Rd off of Stoughton and ask for Diana.  She makes great margaritas :)"}
{"text":"This place is pathetic in every way! Do yourself a favor and don't let your Uber driver drop you here. 

Worst service I've ever experienced. Took 30 minutes to order despite asking a few times. Server made guacamole and asked us to try it, but we didn't have chips or silverware yet. 

They brought 1 person's food and told the rest of us they forgot to put our order in. So as he finished his meal, the other 4 meals showed up. 

Talked to the manager, who blamed everything on the server and refused to do anything about it otherwise. Unreal how unprofessional the restaurant manager was!

Avoid at all costs."}
{"text":"I have been going to Pedro's for 30+ years....well guess what - no more. The service on my recent on 1/23/12 visit was deplorable, the place seems to be more and more in disrepair and the dirtiness of everything is unbelievable. I had noticed the decline some time ago and kept hoping for improvements. But I will be taking my business elsewhere until either the place is upgraded or cleaned!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Several other acquaintances in my circle have made the same comment. Too bad, this place used to be so enjoyable and treat to come to."}
{"text":"The food is good but the service is lacking at times. I am there on Tuesdays and they seem to be understaffed. The servers are always very friendly they just seem to be overwhelmed."}
{"text":"Okay.. so.  I rarely go out to eat and when I do, I want to relax.  I arrived at Pedro's an hour before close tonight.  I know, I know, it is cutting it close to closing time... but is it?  I mean, it wasn't like showing up a few minutes before the close...
I ordered a mug of margarita, not typical for me! and it took me a while to drink.  However, at the stroke of 10 o'clock, they turned the lights off on us!  THE LIGHTS OFF!  I get it, it is rude to linger, but much more rude to turn the lights off on your guests.  After all, we are paying to be there...  let me finish my drink!  Last time for me \"visiting\" this establishment."}
{"text":"Warning: DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PLACE! Terrible service! I've had multiple items on the menu, and they've all been below average. BTW, if you're looking to have a burrito with the usual items (meat, lettuce, tomato, rice, beans, etc) be prepared to have 1 menu option (The 3 lb burrito) that runs you 13-15 dollars, and MORE if you want grilled steak (of which they will give you 5-7 SMALL pieces). Margaritas are OK, but be prepared to wait."}
{"text":"Nothing authentic about this place. Horchata was horrible, they are better off buying the pre-made stuff."}
{"text":"If I could give no stars, I would have. Coming from Texas, this place is a disappointment. It just sucks. They have real Mexican's working for them, yet they can't even make an even tortilla. They are always puffy, misshapen, to thick etc. Most of the food comes out cold and doesn't even make sense. Disgusting!"}
{"text":"Wow- really? 2 STARs for the CHIPS ONLY! 

We visited the Pedros on the West Side 7-28-12. In the past Pedros food has been delicious,  We ate around 12:30 p.m. & have to say this was the 1st time ever that the enchiladas were extremely TOUGH. Took a bite & left the rest, was like chewing soft to medium shoe leather.  The taco, enchilada style was also very tough & the meat inside was in big chunks, versus the normally shredded chicken.  It was so tough, my spouse took the chicken out & ate it, discarded the outside shell. IF you can call it a shell, more like a shoe-leather CASING. Trust me, he usually eats most anything.  Of course that defeats the purpose of ordering a taco, enchilada style - just eating plain chicken. Could have gone to KFC if plain chicken is was what he as hungry for. 

We did mention it to the waiter & he said, was everything else O.K.?  The rest of it was rice & beans & the chips of course, the chips were delicious. (Rice was ultra-dry, over heated/cooked). Not $20. worth of delicious.  Shouldn't have left a 20% tip but did, it's not his fault the food was lousy today.  Whoever the cook was needs PRACTICE,  LOT of PRACTICE. Did I just say they need practice?  Maybe training & practice! 
 
After this uncertain I'd waste money on a treat to eat out again at Pedros. OK - so it wasn't a treat, at all. There are Mexican Restaurants in Madison with consistently good food. 
 
We asked if there were comment cards & told they don't have them.  Very disappointed in the food today.  Most likely will not be back to try it again, as there was no response when we mentioned how tough & inedible the food was.  Just a thumbs up by the waiter. WHAT?  Guess he didn't give a rip, so we truly should have let him know by not giving him a 20% tip. Bad service... & a learning experience I guess to go elsewhere if we want  to enjoy tasty Mexican fare. Emailed them also - no response. When the chips are down (no pun intended), where's the manager of this establishment?"}
{"text":"The fajitas were awesome and the tortillas were fresh from the tortilla-machine which was kinda fascinating. Delicious corn cakes. The fish tacos however were shitty, the fish was fishy, dry and not enough of it, Maciek had a dry tortilla, which is weird since they were all fresh and everything. All in all it was pretty good and the service was great, they stayed open way past closing time for us."}
{"text":"Met up with friends on 5-4-11.  The meal was  good but the service was a little strange.  The server appealed to our group for a tip stating there was ususally a gratuity added to the bill for larger groups but she didn't do that and if we liked the service we should tip accordingly.  I ordered coffee & received 1 cup although I asked for a 2nd.  I also requested a take home container.  Didn't get that either.  Had to ask another server for the container.  Personally, I wasn't impressed with the service but at least this time the server wasn't surley as the one we had previously had been."}
{"text":"Let's lay this out first. You're not coming here for an Authentic Mexican Experience. You're not coming here for locally-sourced ingredients and a seasonally-sensitive menu. You're not coming here for fine dining and a pampered experience. You're here for cheap margaritas (on Tuesday and Thursday, INCREDIBLY cheap margaritas), and colossal portions of white-washed \"Mexican\" food that's brought to you by servers that are either bored to tears or frazzled beyond sanity.

That said, it's really good white-washed \"Mexican\" food. The recipes are simple and time-tested, honed over decades of refinement and incremental changes, and that lack of seasonality means the kitchen gets very, very good at them. The dishes will dance in the back of your mind, tugging gently at you, whispering \"You're remembering that obscenely giant Nachos del Rey, and wanting more, aren't you? You feel the shame of wanting that instead of the stone-ground organic blue corn chips and authentic imported Oaxacan cheese, don't you? You wicked child...\" You can have that again. It's waiting...."}
{"text":"I love Pedros.  The food is great, and you get free chips, salsa, and freshly made tortillas.  It's not traditional Mexican food, I'd say more Americanized, cheese-centric Mexican food.  Which I love.  Tuesdays and Thursdays are half priced margaritas and they have karaoke some nights too.  I'd definitely recommend it for food and a fun night out on the west side."}
{"text":"We have been patronizing Pedro's for years.  Generally we go there for happy hour and trivia on Tuesday evenings.  Probably once every couple months or so at this point.  We do this because we enjoy the trivia game, and it's close to home.  

Currently my main issue with the place is fairly simple, and I'm hopeful that someone with authority reads this review and does something to address the consistent under staffing issue they seem to have.  The last 3 times we've visited we've sat in the side bar area (where the trivia host/game takes place).  The most recent time I actually counted how many tables the one waitress assigned to this section was responsible for.  I counted 16.  These aren't just 16 two tops either.  It wasn't the waitress' fault, but obviously when you have one server trying to cover this much ground she is going to fail.  She was friendly, did her best, and when we finally got our drinks/food it was good.  Please put more staff on to properly accommodate your customers."}
{"text":"The food used to be really good, the service is usually ok, but this last time I went, the bathroom was absolutely horrendous. Dirty-- more like FILTHY-- I swear there was vomit splattered on the wall of the stall and half of the stalls were out of order or the doors were off the hinges. If I had seen the bathroom before I sat down to eat here, I would have walked out. I felt nauseated. This place is disgusting."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Pedro's since I can remember. 15+years and never disappointed. The food was always predictable and salsa and chips and tortillas excellent! But this time around, the food was a huge disappointment.  I will attach pictures of the tortillas but something major was wrong. They were brownish and tasted off. They were also too thick. Im guessing the dough was sitting out and getting old.  The lettuce for our fajitas was on its last leg and the guacamole was served in a plastic container and looked like it had been portioned out days ago and had a brownish film over it. The tortillas have always been wonderful and white and fresh.  Had the tortillas been how they always have been, I could have over looked  some of the other things in regards to the food but the tortillas really ruined the whole meal and enjoyment in having fajitas! We asked for a second serving to see if it was just that one that was off looking and tasting but they were all brown. I expected the typical white tortillas with golden spots. Wish I would have just ordered something else but our waitress was so nice and the fajitas meat onions fried up tasted good. I hope that this place can turn things around and would like to see them get through the hurdles they are going through. Some signs are posted outside in regards to people loitering as I know they have had some problems in the area and that is sad. Not sure if I will ever be back because I can't stand the thought of those tortillas!! Maybe a better place to go for bar food. Not really sure what's happened here but hoping things are resolved sooner than later. Oh and both stars are for the waitress! She was the only good thing about the whole experience."}
{"text":"WARNING: STAY AWAY

This restaurant is a veritable TOUR of humans rights violations. We went on their widely publicized Beyonce trivia night with the crew, only to find they'd canceled the event without telling anyone.

Staff was rude and the food wasn't worth the lack of Queen Bey. Save your money and eat in a public restroom instead."}
{"text":"Pedro's was some of the better that I have tasted in Madison.  Being from AZ, Mexican food which is \"amazing\" is hard to find.  Their salsa had a good flavor.  One thing which was great is their tortillas, fresh made and if dipped in the con queso sauce they are even better!  The service was not amazing, drinks were empty a lot.  Overall Pedro's is eatable, if you want authentic Mexican then this is not the place for you."}
{"text":"After we finished eating we had to wait 18 minutes to collect our payment.  Instead our waiter thought it be a good idea to take a table of 7 people orders and enter it instead of quickly taking my card for 2 people.  Should not take over an hour for only 4 tables in our area!!"}
{"text":"First of all, they charged us to split an entree.  In fact, we had to do the splitting - I guess they charge to have access to an extra plate.  The mushrooms in our enchilada were canned, and then burned.  The ranchero sauce tasted like the red sauce that comes with Spaghetti-O's.   The chips and salsa was less spectacular than the stuff I buy on sale at the grocery store.  The part I depend on most to get me through crappy Mexican food - margaritas - also disappointed.  They tasted like Kool-Aid (but without adequate water) and lacked tequila.  This was all at the west side location, and I hear the east side is even worse.  No vuelvo."}
{"text":"Hey, Pedro's has been around along time, maybe some people have dined they're enough through  the years that it's just not special anymore, the family came in on a Sunday afternoon and we were served free hot and fresh chips and Tortilla's, continually refilled, who does this knowing that if you fill up on free snacks you won't spend much! The service was good, Margaritas were priced write and the food satisfied. Yes I like good old Pedro's"}
{"text":"Dirty, smelly, horrible parking lot, bad food, inattentive workers, stale chips, reheated \"fresh\" tortillas that get rock solid in 30 seconds, stinky, disgusting bathroom (women's), I mean, wash the stall doors and walls, mop the floors, freshen the smell so it doesn't reek of urine. I gave one star for the drink specials. Oh and the tortillas and butter aren't free anymore, btw. And don't sit straight in the back of the building by the games and TVs because there's only one speaker for the music in the bar area and that's where it is. They blast it so don't expect to have conversations without losing your voice and hearing. I'm all for loud, good music but not when I'm socializing at dinner. This is my 10th time here. No more chances."}
{"text":"Decent menu selections, better than average service for a restaurant outside of downtown, and a fair price.  It is hardly authentic, but we dine with our six year old often and Pedro's is a great place for kids or to go after work to watch the game.  They have changed the salsa twice and it still sucks.  I was informed by the manager that the old recipe was 'too spicy' for people in this overgrown Mayberry.  Over all it is decent with pretty good service.  4 stars are for value and service."}
{"text":"Why do people go here? I found the food to be I-can't-eat-this gross quality, and I'm no Mexican food snob. They cover almost everything in different \"sauces\" that taste like organic matter mixed with left-over Campbell's soup. The meat was dry. Fried things were soggy, and the only thing that tasted like something edible was my taco which was, of course, cold.

To top it off, our waitress was really...unusual. First, she bordered on flat-out rude as we tried to pick out a beer. By the end of the meal, she wanted to talk -- she spontaneously shared that she likes to eat a big combination platter after puking following a night out drinking. (Not something you want to head after trying to choke down some of that same combo platter.) Then she told us how she ate a 3 pound burrito on a bet.

Bizarre.

But, obviously, I am wrong. Because people seem to love this place and they vote it the best and they clean their enormous plates. I feel icky right now and am never going back."}
{"text":"Bad service. Waiter was rude and obnoxious.  We never got refills on drinks or salsa. The menus were sticky. Fajitas came out w literally one tablespoon of cheese..we live in Wisconsin! !! The chimichangas were on point though."}
{"text":"When you see the 2 dozen awards on the wall, you wonder why and when this place just slid off. The waitress was nice and even demonstrated how the tortilla machine works to my children. But the complements end there.  There was a part of the roof makes up the covering of sidewalk in the front of the building collapsed. They had cones around it and you see the rotted wood and you think how long will the rest will drop possibly injuring someone. So I get seated and notice the 70's decor hadn't change since I ate there 15 years ago. There was filled water pitchers on every table nice idea until I noticed the ice was gone and the fallen ceiling made me think how long they sat there and what could've fell in there. Ordered a seafood burrito. It had a extra charge if you wanted shrimp it would be extra if you wanted any rice and beans. Got it and it covered in \"Dijon\" saucs... Tasted like honey mustard. So I paid a lil over $11 for this bs. My wife's fajita ain't worth my typing. So 2 stars the burgers in my children's meals and the nice waitress. Avoid."}
{"text":"Oh Pedro's, what happened?  I went to Pedro's on my birthday every year (west side location), until they closed.  I just tried the east side location....I'm sad.  It was not good.  It seems they are closing these places down.  First the west side location, and the Wisconsin Dells location....which I enjoyed....but why did they keep this one open?  The food is horrible!  They should have kept one of the other locations open and shut this one down.  Taco Bell has better and more authentic Mexican food than this place does."}
{"text":"I hadn't been to Pedro's in years, since I lived in the area. It was never one of my favorite places in Madison, but I did enjoy it occasionally. I'm generally underwhelmed by the Americanized Mexican places that dot maps of most towns.

Having just returned from a trip to Seattle and wanting to sit down in an air conditioned building and have some okay food, my dad recommended Pedro's. It seemed like a fine option at the time. Not terribly adventurous, but I just had my adventure and I had to accommodate my dad's less-than-thrill-seeking palette.

The salsa was actually better yesterday than I ever remember it being in the past. It was very thick and tomato-ey, with just a tiny hint of kick. I'd have preferred it to be a bit hotter, myself, but again, being with the parental unit meant keeping to something a bit more tame.

I had the asada burrito, and my dad had the chili burrito. Mine was fine; long strips of pepper and onion mixed in with some cubed steak (actually, I would recommend cutting the veggies to about half their length...they're too easy to pull completely out of the tortilla when you go to get a bite). I had a side of refried beans and rice; these were obviously simple sizes for the cooks because they were clearly just microwaved. It was easy to tell because the rice was pretty dry. The chili burrito was exactly what my dad was hoping for, so there's that.

All in all, if you know what you're in for it's very standard American-Mexican fare. 

As an aside, the previous time I was here a few years ago they had this fantastically gay waiter named Jimmy. He was outrageously friendly and chatty and actually sat down at our booth with us to chat about Plan B and the LGBT scene in Madison. It was a fun time!"}
{"text":"First time here! 

I had Enchiladas Suiza with monster margarita. Fresh and delicious! We came in as a party of 4 and we were greeted in a timely manner. Our server (James) was outstanding! He was 'johnny-on the -spot'! We are definitely coming back again."}
{"text":"Cheap and cheap is good.  The food was edible and the kids meal really well priced, but there were aome serious misteps at both the conceptual and preparation level for their food.      We had their appetizer del fiesta... it included a bizarre taquito with raspberry sauce (just as weird as it sounds and not good weird), a rather floppy steak quesadilla,  some underwhelming wings, and some very plain nachos (though I subbed chicken nachos for the normal seafood variety).  

On the plus side, the tortilla chips were good... unfortunately the salsa wasn't and as @Stacey put it, it reminded me rather of unseasoned marinara.  The steak in the quessidilla was tasty and it made me wish we'd gotten fajitas.

The one saving grace really of my meal, was the soppapilla... It was of the fluffy variety and served with honey and cinnamon sugar and this, will likely bring me back to ponder some of their other menu items."}
{"text":"I've lost count of how many times I've been here. The food is decent, though my shredded chicken tacos are always dry and needing more flavor. The enchiladas are good. I like going for their deals on house margaritas. I wouldn't say it's the best place to get Mexican food, but it's still good. On a Friday night I went with a friend and we had to wait an extremely long time just for a greeting from the waitress & to put in a drink order. Definitely try the place out though, no one place is perfect!"}
{"text":"Okay, nothing wrong with half priced margaritas every Thursday night.  2 34 oz Mug-o-ritas (pretty clever eh?) for a little over $10--WOW!  This usually starts off Thirsty Thursday just right.  I have nothing to say about the food other than that they serve free nachos during Happy Hour."}
{"text":"Back in my younger days...like 15ish years ago Pedro's was a great place for dinner with family,  a date night, drinks with friends,  lunch with a co-worker or anything in between.  Now however...they are past their prime. Their service is slow and the food is mediocre at best. Definitely my memories of Pedro's is better than the current reality of it. Nothing was horrific but it was far from.hrest either. The best thing we had were the chicken fajitas and if we ever went back that's probably all we would order. Honestly though after this visit we probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Service at the bar was good, food not so good.  My fault for ordering mashed potatoes at a Mexican restaurant.  Entree size very small for the price."}
{"text":"Let me just get this out of the way. I grew up in Madison and for years this was my favorite Mexican place. I thought it was the best possible place...anywhere. Then I moved to Phoenix and had real Mexican food and now....

I wanted to review this place because it's not as bad as some of the other reviewers are making it sound. Their salsa and chips are fresh and some of the best around. They serve you fresh warm tortillas with your meal that go well with anything. Some of the pre-meal quesadillas are fantastic. My favorite dish here is the Bean Burrito with red sauce. The way the beans and cheese are melted together just makes it so craveable. 

Still, a lot of this food is simply not authentic, and more than a few are on the heavy side. You will walk away feeling full and likely be on the toilet for a little while the next day. There is no way around this.

The simple truth is that there is no superb mexican food here in Madison, and Pedro's fits right in to this muddy amalgam of mediocrity. Some things it does well though, and the cheap drinks on a Thursday night usually make for a good atmosphere."}
{"text":"Worked here for a short time and it's pretty much a nightmare. The restaurant itself is just plain dirty. If you think it's dirty in places you can actually see imagine how dirty it is in places you can't see. Like  where they prepare your food. Now times that by ten. Anywhere you pay with a credit card the credit card company charges the business a processing fee. Pedro's makes the servers pay that fee. Having been in the industry a long time no restaurant makes its employees pay that fee. Furthermore when I received my final paycheck it bounced. I spoke with the owner Jim Martine on February 3rd and he assured me he would send me out a money order the following Monday. Almost two weeks later still no check. My only next course of action is to pursue this legally. I left this same review on Pedro's Facebook page and they promptly eliminated the ability for ANYONE to leave a review on their page. If you choose to eat there it's your choice. If you choose to work for these people good luck as they are a joke."}
{"text":"This place has the potential to be an adult chuck e. cheese for happy-hour-nacho-and-beer-aficionados... however, thats not the experience I had. I sat down and immediately wondered what was in store. What followed (a bland burrito) was both surprising (not in a good way) and disappointing (for the obvious blandness). In short, the food left much to be desired. I did enjoy the kitschy ambiance but it did not make up for subpar food. Venture into this establishment at your own risk."}
{"text":"I like this place... When you go there you know what you are going to get; warm cheesy comfort food, that is definitely not mexican. But if you go there knowing what to expect, you won't be disappointed.
Check their name of the day, you get a free meal! 
And its fun to go for half price margs on Tuesdays and Thursday, which usually coincides with karaoke or the fueling pianos.  I like what one reviewer said though, def don't dress up of you are going to drink here... You will get hit on by creepers and townies."}
{"text":"This place is everything you don't hope for in a \"Mexican\" restaurant: poor quality food backed up by  atrocious service. My \"chimichanga\" was really a burrito dipped in hot oil only long enough to make it greasy. My friend's--exact same. How does Pedro make soggy chimis? Rice uncooked. A table of 16 and a single waiter with no support...I won't bore you with details. It just keeps going..."}
{"text":"This place is disgusting, if only you saw the manager sticking his fingers into the food and putting it in his mouth... no gloves. And also the ice ... ENJOY YOUR DRINKS! They drop ice bags right next to the dish area on THE FLOOR then put the entire bag into the ice machine to empty the bag out.. enjoy the nasty floor scraps of every single person who ate their before u..

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tm538rCfba8"}
{"text":"Not a fan... You can get significantly better Mexican food elsewhere. I'm not exactly sure how to describe it. It's not the \"Americanized\" Mexican, nor is it the Mexican Mexican. It doesn't taste right, let alone taste okay. 

I think the biggest turnoff is how dirty and unsanitary this place is. Seats and tables are sticky. I wouldn't recommend stopping by here. There are so many other better options. Go to Taco Bell or the mall next door."}
{"text":"I used to really like Pedro's west about 15 years ago so I was pretty excited to attend a birthday dinner at Pedro's east on a Saturday night. I'm not sure if my taste has gotten better or if their food has gotten less flavorful?! I was pretty disappointed with the entire event. 

The complimentary chips and salsa were bland and felt like fillers. We had to request tortillas and when we finally got them there weren't enough for the table. The waiter was friendly but couldn't remember to bring us napkins. The restaurant was very warm, I had to excuse myself to go outside to get fresh air twice. 

On a positive note, I enjoyed my Malibu blended margarita. The side table guacamole was good enough. And the chicken and sautéed onions in my fajita entree were flavorful. 

I won't be going back and I wouldn't recommend. But if you do go, skip the freebies, get a Margarita and if you must eat- try the fajitas."}
{"text":"Oh, Pedro's, palace of mediocrity. I've been to Pedro's a handful of times over the years, but last night was a nightmare. I will not go back.

We sat in the bar area, as there was a 15 minute wait for a table in the dining area. That was fine, but the bar was a clusterfrak of odd people. But whatever, we were there for margaritas and mediocre tacos. We knew what we were getting ourselves into. 

There was a sign on the wall that said \"Moon Man only $2.00\" and I was super excited. New Glarus Moon Man is my favorite beer, and this was a bargain price! Sadly, the beer I was served was not Moon Man. I asked the bartender lady, \"Is this Moon Man or Blue Moon\" and she promised it was Moon Man. She smiled and said, \"I tried it last night, it's kinda lemony isn't it?\" Moon Man is hoppy and delicious, but not overly lemony. This mystery beer Pedro's is claiming to be Moon Man tastes weirdly of margarita syrup and I was really disappointed. Also, the behind-the-bar area is nasty and needs a good cleaning/gut job.

The food was worse than I remember it ever being, and my friend's sampler platter featured a god-awful steak quesadilla. As I was eating my chicken taco, I kept thinking how it was so much worse than a shredded chicken taco I had a Taco Bell recently. The problem with that is the fact that the TB taco was $5 cheaper.

At one point, the bartender went from merely okay to completely unprofessional. I understand that she was the only bartender working on a very busy Thursday, but still. She pretty much yelled at some customers for asking her to ring up their bill. When they said their waitress hadn't checked back on them for a very long time, the bartender still insisted they find their waitress and deal with it. Terrible customer service.

If you want decent Mexican food, go elsewhere. If you are craving a margarita, go elsewhere. After several very underwhelming visits and one horrendous one, I'm convinced that this is not a place I want to support. With the closure of the Westside location, and the poor reviews of this East location, I'm surprised this place is still open. Avoid."}
{"text":"This is an example of things that are wrong with the service vs. food argument because Pedro's genuinely does have decent food, not great by any means but decent. But the service is some of the worst I've ever seen. Now I have a little conspiracy theory so boys and gals put on your tin foil hats and take time to find a popcorn because this in itself is juicy. The waitress we had was not only rude, but one of the worst waitresses I've ever seen and it was almost as if she did it on purpose. I know that's a bold claim but I'll let you decide. It took us 20 - 25 minutes to get our drinks, all of our drinks were wrong besides mine (water), she only came when she absolutely had too (take plates), my friend didn't get her tortillas until a decent time within the meal, my friend asked for a receipt and she brought it back and legitimately put it on the only we surface on the table (she even looked at it while she did it), and acted like she didn't want to be there. Extremely bad service. Don't think I'll go back."}
{"text":"When I moved to Madison, my first priority was to find my new favorite Mexican restaurant.  Pedro's was, unfortunately, the first place that I tried.  I appreciate free chips and salsa, but my appreciation of this restaurant ends there.    The food is edible, but it is by no means Mexican."}
{"text":"Yikes..Went there tonight and waited nearly an hour and 15 minutes to get our food. Nearly 30 minutes to even order our food(didn't have a menu for the first 15 minutes either). I'd give the place a 2/5 before due to the food being \"Okay\" and the service being \"Okay\" and the prices being \"Okay\" but now I'd have to demote it to 1 finally. 

I get stuff happens but we received no apology or even explanation to the incredible wait. It was busy, sure - but why even have that much space if you can't handle it being filled? The waiter was polite but seemed completely unaware of the situation or this is normal from time to time there? At a minimum an acknowledgement/explanation would have been great like \"we're a little understaffed but we're working on it\". When we left , could still see other tables anxiously wondering where the heck the food was. Won't be coming back unfortunately."}
{"text":"The 3lb pound mucho matadore burrito is a legit contender for anyone with an abnormal appetite or just really loves their burritos like me. I got this thing on a Thursday night which is also half price Margarita night and yet around 545 the place was not really all that busy. I ordered and was served within 10 minutes. For 11 bucks this thing is a steal as it could feed 2 full grown men easy. I however have an inferno like metabolism with nothing normal about it so lets move on. This thing has everything inside it. Choice of pork, steak, beef or chicken (I got chicken) corn, black beans, lettuce, cheese, rice, bit of sour creme and then topped with mole sauce and sprinkled with cheese. The smell and the taste were genuine and delicious! Scary part is that despite \"pacing myself\" I still finished solo in under 12 minutes and felt pretty content afterwords."}
{"text":"Lunch on Sunday.  Food arrived cold. Service was slow and confused.  Staff appeared to be busy but not that many people in the restaurant.  Use to be our favorite place but this will be our last visit.  Have been going here for 10 years and watched it gradually go downhill."}
{"text":"Pedro's has been and will always be not bad Americanized Mexican food. The ambiance has obviously not been changed since Pedro's packed it in on a regular basis. My boyfriend and I went on a Friday night, and they were short staffed with a few large parties. The staff was courteous, honest about wait times, and about how busy the restaurant was that evening. We were put on a short wait, and while they had a curious method of seating off the waitlist (I used to run host stands for a living at a few different restaurants so I understand how waitlists get seated), it was a shorter wait than quoted. We were warned that the bartender was slammed so our wait would be better spent in the lobby.

When seated, we looked at the drink/dessert menu for our margaritas: frozen raspberry for him and melon on the rocks for me. The drinks were delicious- a bit sweet, but still tasty. Our server was swamped, but still was very good and friendly. While we weren't given menus immediately, or silverware until after our food was delivered, she made a great attempt to juggle her tables successfully. 

I had a carnitas burrito, and he got the pancho villa burrito. While both of us really enjoyed them, there was nothing too special or memorable. The most special or memorable food item were the chips which are always amazing!!

We will still go back, but as usual, it's good, just not amazing."}
{"text":"Service was awful before I found the disgusting mildew/scum ring inside my drink glass (which I had taken drinks from). The \"manager\" offered an ice cream and was going to adjust the check. After 10 minutes of waiting went to find her and she wouldn't come out but check came out with the drink (soda) taken off. Whooptee doo. I just drink their scum! Waiter Todd gave us attitude about it too. This place sucks.
BTW- check out the food build up on the cracks on the partical board tables with loose tile on top. Really?  The health dept. allows that?"}
{"text":"I didn't go here for an authentic Mexican-meal experience (the place has Restaurante in it's name), I went here to have insanely large margaritas with friends. It's close by to where I live so that's a plus. 

Anyone looking for \"healthy\" or \"real Mexican\" food might want to try taking a trip south of the border, or to California."}
{"text":"This is a lunch review I was seated quickly ordered quickly the food came quick typical chips and salsa I have the lunch fajitas with pork. Food was hot enough and tasted pretty good ignore the bad reviews try it for yourself."}
{"text":"Cripes, do I even have to give one star? Pedro's is about as Mexican as I am. Bland food and flavorless sauces abound. I feel you could order anything on the menu and wind up tasting the same food. Everything was just bland and limp. This is the worst kind of faux-Mexican food the world has to offer. 

TL;DR: Bleh."}
{"text":"I love hosting large groups here! They are so accommodating, will do separate checks and provide excellent customer service. I've had at least 5 events with parties of 20+ people (sometimes even last minute) and they don't bat an eye. 

The food is pretty good and they have a very large bar selection. The tortillas are fresh and my favorite dish is the shrimp fajitas."}
{"text":"Yummy Chips and Salsa! If your up for something new try a MALIBU MELON MARGARITA, only made at Pedro's, It's delicious!"}
{"text":"Pedro's is a place that I remember fondly from my childhood. We used to eat there from time-to-time when I was a kid.  

Sadly, the place hasn't seemed to evolve much since the 80's.  We went for an early dinner one night before seeing a show in Madison.  We were seated at about 4:30 pm, and were the only ones in the dining room.  The decor is 80's \"americanized Mexico.\" It looked exactly as I remember it from years ago.  It did seemed to be kept up.

I was really looking forward to the hot fresh tortillas they used to serve.  There is a tortilla maker in the middle of the dining room.  Unfortunately, the machine wasn't running.  I can understand that since the place was pretty empty, but the tortillas they gave us were dry and hard.  They had been sitting out for awhile.  That was a bit disappointing.

I had a burrito, it was ok.  Nothing too exciting.  In the 80's and 90's it would have been great, but Mexican food in Wisconsin has gotten so much better over the years.  

I still love their chips and salsa, though!  However, that probably isn't enough to bring me back again anytime soon."}
{"text":"I went with the Web608 Geek Dinner.  Chips were stale, but the but part of my entree was great.  I had something with Chimi, but I can't remember what it was (I just ate it last night, alas).  I'd definitely go there again if I was in the area, but it's not worth driving from Verona for (though I'd go to a geek dinner just about anywhere, I think)."}
{"text":"On a resent trip the food was good, reasonable prices, but the service was terrible. We had 6 people with 2 coupons for buy 2 dinners get 1 free, and our server would not let us use them both, (We have used multiple coupons here before when we were in a group. He was rude to us the rest of the time we were there."}
{"text":"Another sell-out Mexican restaurant chain, but they do have one thing going for them....the fresh tortillas that are made while you watch and served in a basket with butter.  I could live on them.  Food is always as expected....large portions and not too spicy.  I once found a hair in my meal...yick....but I still eat there, so i guess it didn't kill me!  Watch out for screaming children...this is a big family place."}
{"text":"NEVER AGAIN. This place is just as bad as the west side. The enchilada's were not good what so ever. The salsa seemed frozen and sweet.... My wife and friends did not enjoy there food either."}
{"text":"There really should be some kind of board that gives accrediation to restaurants claiming to be \"Mexican.\" That way the consumer would know that places like Taco Bell, Pedro's and ChiChi's (if they're even still open) are not really Mexican restaurants, even though they purport to be. That way folks wouldn't be fooled into eating at a \"Mexican Restaurante\" just because there's an \"e\" at the end of \"Restaurant.\" 

After my meal at Pedro's, I decided to just hit up Taco Bell the next time I'm in Madison and I want \"Mexican.\" It's just as crappy as this place, but far easier on the pocketbook. 

This place is an afront to the people of Mexico and their cuisine."}
{"text":"Not even the hungriest, rabid infested pack of Chihuahuas would touch this food. All their food is canned process nonsense. It's like Mc Donalds on Mescaline. Now the freshly made tortillas are good, but that's it."}
{"text":"In my mind, there is one reason to not instantly veto any trip to Pedro's: the free fresh tortillas for the table.

There's not really a reason to go to Pedro's, but I'm actually confident in my ability to find something edible on the menu now after a recent trip. I had a burrito (uuuh...top right column) that was reasonably decent (surprisingly so, actually) keeping in mind my rock bottom expectations."}
{"text":"Does anyone in Madison consider this a great Mexican food location? Both of my experiences at Pedro's have left me disheartened. They go a little something like this:

1. Thursday night. Friends invite me for inexpensive margaritas. Am   approached by a girl who wants me to go out with her father standing 10 feet away, who ironically is the least creepy of the crowd looking to enjoy cheap tequila. Implementing Gym Rules, i.e. baseball cap and hoodie upon my next visit post 9pm.

2. Wednesday evening. Dinner with a friend. Server who may or may not go on living if she stops texting, poor quality food and terrible lighting, which is imperative unless practicing G.R. (see above.)

Being a girl from the southwest, I have had a great fajita or two in my day. If you are feeling rebellious and decide to go despite the many poor reviews, know this: Mexican food is great, and this is nowhere near that."}
{"text":"I'm not going to lie to you, this food is nowhere near Mexican, but the enchilada suiza is delicious in it's own right (ignore the side dishes, blech!).  The margaritas are delicious, and if you go on half-price Thursdays, very reasonable.  They have a good price on their lunch menu.   I wouldn't say I recommend it necessarily if you are looking for authentic Mexican...buuut, eh, it's tasty once in a while."}
{"text":"Oh man. I hate going back on reviews but less than a month after writing one of the only good reviews of Pedro's, I am changing my opinion of the place a little bit. We went here last night and everything was off: stale chips, lame food, less than crispy chimichanga, loud obnoxious Spanish pop music. Not sure what was going on. I was disappointed, after having really liked eating here before."}
{"text":"Badger game disappointment! Watered down drinks, slow service and rude management! 

My husband and I have watched many badger games at Pedro's. Good drink specials and multiple TVs have made this our go to spot for years. The service is always slow and the food is just decent but it's a good spot to watch a game...

Tonight was a completely different story! My Guinness tasted just like water, I suspect it was watered down. Our service was super slow. We were there for over 30 minutes before we received chips and salsa. The chips were hot but they needed salt. Their salsa tasted like ketchup. Once we ordered, again our food took forever. My cousin asked for sour cream and waited another 20 minutes for it. My food was ok. The tamale was actually pretty good. It needed spice though.

The kicker was when the manager, Brett, started changing the channels shortly after halftime! We asked the waitress what was going on. We came for a badger game. Our menus had badger specials, FB also listed their badger specials. Having just received our food... Yes it took two quarters, we couldn't relocate to another establishment. Apparently, there was a UFC fight on. We asked to speak to management, this is when we met Brett.

We asked about the game. He refused to turn the game back on stating that they paid $2000.00 for the UFC fight and they were going to show it. I looked around at the sea of red and asked him what his current demographic/ customer base thought of missing the second half of the game. He again referenced the cost. His solution was to have us move tables in the middle of our dinner to be in view of a smaller tv with no sound! 

Worst of all was when I told him we wouldn't be returning because of this he said,\"Ok.\" 

He clearly doesn't care about his customers! Awful!"}
{"text":"The food is nothing special and is way too expensive for being that lackluster.

Tuesday and Thursday nights are what redeems Pedro's!  The special at the bar is 1/2-priced margaritas of any size.  The best value is the 1/2-priced MUG-o-rita, which is very, very large.  It's in an over-sized beer stein.  Back in my heavy drinking days, two of these would have me out cold.  They're delicious, but treacherous.  Also, they come in many tasty flavors, such as cranberry.  $4 for a bigass margarita?  Count me in.

It's even better if you get there for Happy Hour (which I think ends at 6 or 7).  Still the same drink special, PLUS free chip, salsa, rice & bean bar!  That really helps cut the margarita's potency, too.  

The crowd gets huge, rowdy and douchey by 9 or 10 on Thursdays.  Karaoke used to be fun, but now that Pedro's management won't let you a) swear, or b) sing any variety of \"hip-hop\" song, it's lame and not worth doing or listening to."}
{"text":"This West location is now CLOSED.   Owner would like to reopen in the future."}
{"text":"I've been going to Pedro's pretty much as long as I can remember. The food has never disappointed me. I usually get a chicken chimichanga or burrito. This past time I tried the taco salad with grilled chicken. I love their fresh tortillas and chips and salsa. If you like spicy ask for the green salsa. They don't bring it out unless you ask. The margaritas are always good no matter what flavor you get. Also try the snickers chimichanga. Its amazing. The problem I have with Pedro's is their waitresses. The last two times our waitress didn't seem interested in us at all. One time she forgot one of our drinks and it was almost 10 minutes before we got it."}
{"text":"The item you pick for your dinner can quite literally make or break the experience here.  That is, your cheesy, Americanized Mexican food experience.  I tried the vegetarian tamale and it was nothing less than awful.  No cheese anywhere, no flavor, just HOT.  Ok yes, the menu indicates this a \"spicy\" dish, but it didn't indicate its high degree of suck.  

Unfortunately on this particular visit we didn't get a hot waitress.  Instead we got a disenchanted guy who apparently didn't want a very big tip.  His heavy sighs, eye rolls, and general lack of even being around 99% of the time led me to believe he was channeling his inner emo and couldn't be bothered.  

We were sat next to a group of teenage girls, which by automatic default says \"we hate you and want you to die.\"  They talked very loudly about their sexual escapades and did that annoying screech laughing.  I get it, I was a teenager once too, but if I could go back in time I'd kick my own teenaged ass.  

The food, service, and ambiance was like the time I fell off my motorcycle and got really bad road rash.  I hope I won't be doing that again any time soon."}
{"text":"I love this place!  Was sooooo sad when I found out the Wisc Dells location closed.  So, detoured into Madison on the ride home and still got my fix of yummie fresh hot chips and salsa with a tasty strawberry marg.  Onto my fav dish, the Enchiladas seafood suiza, yum.  My fav mexican place to date."}
{"text":"Server and waitstaff very good and polite. Only reason for two stars due to extremely small portion. Ordered baked fish for $10.99. Smallest portion of fish I've ever had at a fish fry.

My daughter and wife happy with their non-fish fry selections.

Stopping at McDs on way home for fish \"sammich'."}
{"text":"Absolute worst Mexican food I have ever eaten, period. 

It's like Mexican food for people who don't like Mexican food. Much of the food had little taste to it. I would rather eat Taco Bell, and I don't like Taco Bell."}
{"text":"Eating here is always hit or miss for us.  They must have hiring troubles because we have had awful service.  On one occasion we were served our chips upon arrival but no one ever came to take our order so we walked out.  On another occasion the waitress was just awful, repeating our order back to us wrong and not remembering she had already taken our credit card (if that doesn't make you nervous...).  The only time I go there now is with my girlfriends when swift service doesn't matter as much since we are too busy gabbing.

The food is as you would expect for Americanized Mexican.  It's good enough to fill a spot in your stomach, but the chips and warm tortillas are addicting.

Despite the gamble you take when getting dinner, they did a great job for us when we celebrated hubby's and my 40th birthday parties.  Hubby hit the big 4-0 first and for his birthday we did a buffet style party where they had pans of food and we paid per person.  I believe it came to about $600 for the party but we were prepared for that expense and pleased with how it all turned out.  Keep in mind hubby is approaching 50 now and anything could change in 10 years.

For my party we opted to just have an informal get together in the bar and order appetizers as needed which was much more reasonable -- maybe in the $140 area.  Again, no complaints for this arrangement.

In the end -- yes vote for parties at Pedro's and lower your expectations for a dinner date."}
{"text":"They don't deserve 1 star.   Poor service, wrong food delivered, no follow up.  Enchiladas were swimming in a pool of grease.  Server gave other tables their tortillas, we didn't get any.  
Never coming back."}
{"text":"Pedro's is my favorite Mexican resturant in Madison. I miss the one located on the West Side of town, but food is good at any Pedro's location. 
My favoirte thing is their pressed and warmed tortillas (they are a sweet treat if you butter them and put some sugar on them). They have good complimentary chips and salsa in the dinning area. And anything I have had on their menu is great. My go to order is the shredded chicken burrito. I have even gotten the three pount burrito and split it with my Fiancee. 
Favorite margarita flavor is peach!"}
{"text":"Heed the warnings! We were looking for a place without a wait and with a capacity near 400, Pedro's was the final stop. 

Like others who've reviewed, I remember passable experiences at the west side location. East location was a once and done for me.

The salsa doesn't have flavor and seems to come from a can. Chips have that stale texture though at 6:00 on a Saturday night they were warm and salted.

I should have gotten fajitas as has been stated in other reviews but quesadilla and tamales were ordered. Mistake. No flavor but I detected some salt. The corn side, however, had no salt or discernible flavor. One would recognize it as corn kernels simply by texture. The fajitas did smell good when they went by our table to others.

Really save your time and money and make the extra drive to that other local taco place! Or if you do go here stick to fajitas only.

Also, charged $2 for guacamole we did not order. Knowing I would never be back and having read old reviews that management is just not that into customer satisfaction I didn't argue the bill. But watch for overcharge if you still insist on spending here!"}
{"text":"Danger Will Robinson! Avoid this place. Stale chips, Pace Picante salsa, microwaved food. I ordered a chimi and the middle was still frozen. Server was really slow and did not seem to know the menu. The dining area is extremely shabby: ripped cushions and dingy tables. I do not know why I stayed after the first five minutes."}
{"text":"We had a very disapointing and somewhat disturbing eating experience at Pedro's this week.  The chips were stale, the waitstaff was unable to get any of our order right, and the food we were served was terrible and overpriced.  Literally the sour cream was frozen...who freezes sour cream?!"}
{"text":"All I ever get here are the chicken fajitas and those are fairly hard to screw up.  Anything else I've tired here has been sub-par.  Really, the best thing about this place is the freshly-made tortillas."}
{"text":"o.k. it is Pedros, but the baked Friday night fish is the best I had in Madison.  Great texture, spices, the rye bread, chipotle sauce and coleslaw were great too.   Of course the freshly baked tortillas were fattening and awesome.  The atmoshpere is a little off, but a great surpise for Friday fish."}
{"text":"The west side location was way better. After they shut down I started going to this one. The food isn't as good and the fresh made tortillas are always either hard, cold, or burnt. Half the time I'm there they screw up my order. One time there was a miscommunication between the waitress and my boyfriend which ended up costing us $7. It wouldn't have been that big of a deal if the manager at first told the waitress to tell us she wasn't there and when she did finally come out she didn't apologize, make any effort into making the situation any better, and then started repeating the same thing over and over again so we'd shut up. A couple of my friends and I have decided to never go back here. Hopefully the west side one will open up again."}
{"text":"I miss this place. The east side is not as good as this location was. I hope they bring it back. A waitress said that the guy who owned this location is looking for a new place, but no idea when he'll buy one. They had a really bad manager back in '11, but I think they got rid of him. The fresh tortillas were the best, and often the whole reason I came here. The other food is pretty good depending on what you get. The pork tamales were always good though. I love the margarita specials on Tuesday."}
{"text":"I would come here in my youth and it had some of the best Mexican food in Madison.The food was absolutely disgusting. The ground beef I think the tacos tasted like i would imagine dog food to taste like. My children wouldn't touch it. The quesadilla's were over cooked, possibly old. No tortillas were served which is fine but it used to be a given. The salsa was bland. The combo platter was disgusting. Say no to the tamale (i'm not sure where it came from), say no to the beef taco (taste like beef gravy), no to the rice and beans (words can not explain), no to guacamole, the normal chicken enchilada was okay, and the sour cream was okay. Strawberry margarita seemed spoiled. But everything else will make you wish you never came."}
{"text":"Pedro's is in the neighborhood so we go here quite often. The food is great, but could benefit from adding some low-cal, heart-healthy and vegetarian dishes. It's quite noisy between the music, the kids and the patrons. I usually wear ear plugs. The wait staff is efficient and very friendly as is the management. It's almost always busy and there are quite often coupons available if you keep your eye out for them. Bring a sweater and knee socks in case you get a booth by the window. As far as an 'authentic' Mexican experience, I suggest you got to Rick Bayless' Frontera Grill in Chicago. Pedro's is about food and friends and fun. I have never seen anything dirty here and have never sent anything back. They have a busy fish fry on Fridays and it's all fried. Baked fish is available. The margaritas taste great. I used to live in Texas and there is nothing sub-standard about Pedro's food. You can make a meal out of the 'Table-side Guacamole'. They have a separate bar, TV room and patio. Basic nachos are available in the bar for most happy hours (?) and drink specials are available if you go on those days. They have half-priced appetizers in the bar but you'll have to call to find out when. We almost always eat in the restaurant. Great place to meet up with friends from work. Never had to wait too long for a table."}
{"text":"Pedros serves up everything you would want from an Americanized, cheesey Mexican restaraunt. They have some over the top mariachi music playing in the dining room, fake parrot cages hanging from the ceiling, free chips and salsa, solid service, gigantic burritos smothered in cheese and a ginormous variety of margaritas. While I won't venture to say this represents anything close to legitimate Mexican cuisine, it is exactly what the doctor ordered for like 95% of Madisonians.

My favorite things about this place:
-Fresh tortillas, pressed and warmed in the dining room
-Flavored Margarita variety, because Strawberry should be standard, but blue is something to be applauded
-Corn cakes - don't waste your sides on anything else, double down on these guys
-Karaoke in the bar with super cheap margarita mugs
-Seafood Suiza - even with olives (yuck) this is my favorite enchilada anywhere
-Fried Ice Cream - this place is where it was invented as far as I'm concerned

Pro tip: Don't order off the menu for your kids, a buttered tortilla with crushed up chips and a little salsa is probalby the best thing they have, and its not even on the menu. Pretty awesome, don't knock it til you try it."}
{"text":"It hurts me to give Pedro's one star, as it was such a staple of my high school and college days, but this last trip was just not good. I hadn't been to Pedro's in years due to a not-so-great experience at the now closed west side location, but I decided to take a gamble the other night on the east side. When we walked in at 7 on a Saturday and the place was almost completely empty we should have taken it as a sign and turned around, but we were both hungry and decided to stick it out.

Disappointment number one: the tortillas were dry and tasteless. I used to crave their fresh-pressed tortillas from the east coast, so it was a total bummer to get sub-par room-temperature tortillas first thing instead of the warm, pillowy ones I used to dream about. 

Disappointment number two: the salsa was really sweet and thick. If you'd have served it to me in a neutral location, I'd have assumed it was spaghetti sauce that was missing some key herbs. It didn't taste fresh. 

Disappointment number three: the rice was so dry that it was almost crispy. The flavor was just overcooked - no spice, no richness, just an overheated taste. 

Disappointment number four: I have ordered a chicken chimichanga from Pedro's several times in the past, and I have always ordered it no sauce - I'm not a fan of pouring sauce all over the top of my crispy tortilla, and there was always plenty of flavor in the filling to make up for it. This time, the server/cook took my request of no sauce to mean none at all. I was served a fried tortilla filled with plain shredded chicken and nothing else. The chicken didn't even have the pepper on it that they mix in for the tacos. The filling had no cheese, no salsa, no tomatoes, no onions, no anything that you usually find at least one of in a chimichanga. So. Weird. I can't be mad, I guess, because I did say no sauce, but I've never had it served to me with literally nothing but a tortilla and chicken before, either.

Upsides: the chicken itself was good, and had a fair amount of flavor for being plain; the tortilla shell was perfectly crispy; you get after-dinner mints with your bill (the kind often served in silver dishes with a spoon by registers that look like little pastel pillows). 

It might be worth stopping in on Tuesdays or Thursdays for their half-price margarita special (I imagine those haven't changed over the years), but I don't think I'll be back for dinner."}
{"text":"I have been going to Pedro's for  more or less ten years. I would come visit friends in the Madison area every year when I was living in Pennsylvania during high school, and a trip to Pedro's was always on the list - my friends were obsessed.

Pedro's isn't authentic Mexican fare, and I don't think anyone pretends it is. It used to be an affordable, tasty, Americanized Mexican restaurant with half-priced margaritas on T/Th, good chips and salsa, and delicious made-fresh tortillas (literally - they have a tortilla press in the dining room and they crank them out and bring them to your table while you're deciding what to order). 

I was a big fan of Pedro's until the last year or so. They raised their prices while lowering their quality. The last time I was there, I got a shredded beef chimi with beans and rice. In former years, I could make 2-3 servings from the chimi and finish my sides at the restaurant if I was willing to eat to the point of discomfort (which I sometimes was, because it used to be good). This last time, there was about 1/3 of the amount of beans and rice that they used to serve, and the chimi was about half as big. Also, almost half of my filling for the chimichanga was two large chunks of unrendered fat. Gross. Gross gross gross. I don't know how the cooks could have missed it - it wasn't like a small little chunk a la pork 'n beans that got buried under the meat - it was meat on one side, fat on the other. Barf.

The food has been sub-par my last couple of visits as well. I won't totally write it off, as the margarita deal is a really good one, and the tortillas are delicious, so I'll just suggest it as a drink & snack stop, especially in the warmer months when you can sit on the patio."}
{"text":"The food was really really good. Fast and courteous service.  The prices and menu selection was very reasonable. I plan on returning for future visits."}
{"text":"I was here to watch the Super Bowl and the setup was not bad. 4 big TV's to watch the game. Some free food and I believe they had $2.50 pints. 
Now the service or should I say, what service. The girl working that night made it clear that she was not there for anything other than to watch the game from the table behind us. Maybe it was two of her friends at the table, but she sat there for most of the game and I had to ask her for service. Then she never went out of her way. 
Ordered the fried ice-cream and it had no outer shell on it. When we said something to her about it, her response was that's how they all are. Then we had to tell her we did not want it then and her response was \"ok.\"
Never did she ask not offer to fix it. 
When we arrived, I asked what specials they had and the response was $2.50 pints. Just look at FaceBook to find out they had a list of specials. A few different drinks (beer, margaritas, and food) specials, just to name a few. 
I will never choose to come back here again. 
I had such high hopes as I wanted to find a good Mexican place in Madison. It's not this place. :-("}
{"text":"Top 3 high/low lights

1) free chips, salsa, and rice in the bar area every night
2) great service
3) good food

Had dinner at Pedro's on a recent weeknight!

The place is gigantic and it was nice to be seated right away. The service was quick and we were bought a basket of chips and salsa (gluten free!) and a basket of warm flour tortillas (sadly not gluten free because they smelled DIVINE). I had a mango margarita (Pedro's has lots of options for their house margs) which was great. They have a gluten free menu within their standard menu and as with most Mexican restaurants there are lots of g free options. I had tacos in corn tortillas with veggies and rice on the side. The food was good! And you get a lot for the price. 

I also noticed they do free chips, salsa, queso and Spanish rice in the bar area. We will definitely be back for that!"}
{"text":"I've only been there for lunch on weekdays, so I can't really offer much about the margaritas, which should probably make this review a complete waste of your time.  Going to any sort of Mexican restaurant and not having alcohol is ridiculous.  This is the only time I hate my job.

There are certain things that I like, and one of them is certainly tasty salsa.  It's compounded by having multiple varieties and fresh chips to dip into said myriad salsas.  This can only be improved upon by not charging me for it.  Pedro's has this correct, so they're walking in the right direction to keep me interested.

Otherwise, for the food, don't kid yourself.  This isn't Rick Bayless, and they aren't running to push Graze out of the limelight.  (Lime...with tequila...why can't I drink on the job?)  It's Americanized Mexican.  You're paying more than Taco Bell because the ingredients are generally better.  It's a workhorse menu of all of your comfortable Mexican standards that the suburbs of Wisconsin have grown to love even as they vote to keep Mexicans out.  It's good food.  Just good, perfectly middle of the road and acceptable, whether it's enchiladas, burritos, or tamales.

Service was okay.  Our servers knew the routine on our visits and hit all the standard marks on refills, clearing, etc.  There wasn't much personality, but that was reflecting of the entire experience.  Everything was almost neutral.  Nothing bad, nothing great.

Drinks?  Yes...soon."}
{"text":"Went for Saturday late lunch. I got a combo platter that included beans, rice, a chicken enchilada, a beef and cheese chile relleno, and a pork tamale. I had a wide range of loves and hates, blacks and whites.

Tamale: very good. chunky bits of meat inside, verde sauce on top. It was spicy with no menu warning, but I like spicy. Very good sauce, big tamale.

Enchilada: very little sauce, filled with shredded chicken. Chicken was kind of chewy. It was well seasoned, but not flavoured. Bland.

Chile Relleno: This was the densest batter I'd ever seen. I'm used to an egg batter on one of these, but this was more like a 50/50 egg batter corn cake mix. It was like eggy corn bread, which sounds like it would be pretty good, but wasn't. Very dense, very bland. I ended up just cutting through the coating to the chile inside, which was well cooked, and the filling was good. 

Beans and rice: tasted like they were straight out of a can. not seasoned, not a good texture.

Salsa that came with the chips: canned.

If I had just gotten pork tamales with verde sauce instead of the combo plate, I probably would have given this place a 4. 

The place was dirty. Clean tables. Dirty carpet, lots of old food in-between the cracks in the booths. Waiter was filthy, like he'd been helping out in the kitchen and wiping his hands on his pants and apron."}
{"text":"Holy hell, what happened to this place?? This had been my go-to place for beans-and-rice Mexican in Madison for the better part of two decades, and I had converted my wife into a Pedro's fan. I'd had past or present Madison residents take issue with my insistence that Pedro's was a great casual dinner place, but I took that as part and parcel of Madison's legendary disdain for anything that's not edgy/hip/contemporary/iconoclastic/whatever. And old-school American-Mexican food is certainly none of the above, plus it represents one of the the greatest societal faux-pas of our time -- *gasp!* -- cultural appropriation! 

Unfortunately, it turns out any snobbery -- incidental or otherwise -- toward Pedro's may be warranted. My wife and I stopped in for the first time in 3 or 4 years and we were both sorely disappointed with our experience. The burrito is smaller than it used to be -- I suppose that's how they've been able to hold the line on prices so the size reduction is probably justified -- but my wife's fajitas were chewy, and both dishes lacked that \"kick\" that they used to have. Our quesadilla appetizer arrived luke-warm and was nearly rock-hard within minutes.

The premises haven't changed in the nearly 20 years I've been eating there and it's starting to show its age. Service was adequate, no more no less. which would be fine if everything else up to par.  In short, Pedro's lacks that extra spark that used to make it worth a special stop when visiting or passing through town. Not to mention the Mexican cuisine options have exploded in Madison in the last 20 years, so one would think Pedro's would need to step up their game rather than rest on their laurels. Looks like we'll be checking out the newer competitors on our next visit to Madison."}
{"text":"I don't think I will ever take my girlfriend here again. We were looking for some good drinks and good food and this is not the place. Our food had literally NO flavor, the soft shell tortillas tasted so different then I've ever had them there it was not good. The waitress is another story.. I actually felt bad but left her a note telling her she was extremely nice but not attentive at all. we both had to get sour cream to drown out our food, we asked for it when we ordered and realized when she left we didn't have any, asked her again for sour cream, we waited about 15 min and she never even came back out, by then our food was completely cold and not worth eating. I was extremely disappointed. The new busser wouldn't stop talking to us and another table about his new grandbaby, the first time was great, but then he was standing next to our table every 3 min talking to someone about it, nice guy but u need to be respectful of people eating. Overall they need to train staff better and fix their food."}
{"text":"great fresh tortillas and chip and ask salsa ask for the hot salsa reasonable priced kids menu even better deal on sundays love the seafood burrito with shrimp good enchildas probarly not true authentic mexician but my family has always liked it good place for large groups service is solid we come as much as any sitdown resturant in town"}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in there for a quick lunch on the way to a movie.  The initial service was OK but ultimately slowed to a crawl making us dash to our movie.  The decor was like it was when I was in high school (20 years ago) and desperately needs some updating - making the entire dining experience feel dingy.
Now for the food - the food was served on vey hot plates (which I think covers for improper cooking) and came relatively quick.  No sour cream on my burrito as ordered but we'll move on.  My food was extremely bland; ground beef rolled in a flour tortilla does not a burrito make.  I couldn't even finish my meal it was so boring and tasteless.  My wife had pretty much the same experience with her chimichanga but the black beans saved her meal (a little).  We paid and bolted for the door (partly to catch the movie but mostly just to end the experience).
The place would do well with some aggressive management, quality control out of the kitchen and a remodel/deep cleaning."}
{"text":"The outer appearance of the restaurant made me very hesitant to eat here, but coming in the doors quickly changed my mindset. We were offered fresh, warm chips and salsa upon arrival as well as hot, fresh-pressed tortillas. The food arrived quickly and was great."}
{"text":"Came here because of a coupon in the Bucky Book. 

Only reason I didn't give just one star is because the lunch prices were reasonable and our waitress was a gem- friendly, opinionated about things on the menu and quick.

First, didn't care for the salsa. Tasted like stewed tomatoes from a can. Nothing special. My husband, however, did like it.

The food was mediocre at best. My beans were tasty, but the rice was flavorless and the chicken on my taco tasted like it had no seasoning (flavor) in it. Pretty bland food. My husband liked his super burrito though and said that its more bland than what we're used to because its 'authentic' Mexican food."}
{"text":"Never going here again. Being a bartender I know what makes good service and this place sucks. Even managment watched as employees  passed me and never said a word. My glass was dipped in the ice to be filled instead of using a ice scoop....even after I told the bartender we hated another place that it also occured."}
{"text":"Stopped at this place on a ride from Minnesota to Chicago, on my way back to california--the beacon of good mexican food in the US...so I was excited to see what this place had to offer! Very friendly staff and reasonable prices on  generous portions. We were started off with the customary chips and salsa, which was quite tasty, and then a fun treat--warm fluffy tortillas which we could put butter or sugar on. These were amazing...I liked this change. I was getting full by this point and the entree hadn't even been served. We also got some guac which was made in a cool manner with some great ingredients table side. Delicious. When my vegetarian tamales finally came, I was already pretty full and managed to eat half of one and a yummy corn cake. The tamale was a little spicy for my taste, but not bad. The margarita wasn't the most amazing, but also not bad. A good little experience passing thru Madison."}
{"text":"The atmosphere isn't very good. The restaurant is old and dirty looking, definitely needs some updates. That said, I've always found the food to be surprisingly good and very reasonably priced. If you're looking for a posh environment with flawless authentic Mexican food, skip this place. If you want good food, a big ass Margarita, don't want to spend a lot of money and aren't picky about your surroundings, then I would recommend checking it out."}
{"text":"Pedro, if I could give you negative stars I would. Steven L from MA, said it all. This is rated as Best of Madison?? It shows what is going on in Madison and how very little the people of Madison know about food or quality thereof.

This place is disgusting! The food is abhorrent. A black bean and cheese burrito with no cheese?? The black beans tasted like they came out of a can of Bush's baked beans. Pedro, you owe me $20.00 back. Seriously. A wet steak burrito that had NOTHING but six strips of steak and a lot of horrible sauce inside a tortilla shell? Are you kidding me? I can get more authentic Mexican from Old El Paso.

Just avoid this place at all costs. There is nothing good about Pedro's, there is nothing Mexican about Pedro's."}
{"text":"By all common sense i should detest this place, over-salted food... check, stereotypical music... yup... includes ranch in food... oh yes. (and then there are the monstrous portion sizes) I keep coming back because they have 1/2 priced margaritas on Thursdays, a fairly decent happy hour, fresh tortillas, fresh ingredients, and decent service.  The food plays to the lowest common denominator so my friends who hate all things not-American food can find something they enjoy. If you want authentic Mexican go to S. Park Street and hit up El Pastor. (for serious) Also If you have to choose between the east side Pedro's or the west side location.. hands down pick the west. (east is a tad dumpy)"}
{"text":"I should know better than to dine at chain restaurants.  But it was half price marg night and the girls thought meh... Give it a shot.

I remember going to Pedro's in the late 90's when I tried my first fried ice cream; happy memories.
But my tastes have matured over the years and although the menu described what could've been a very tasty tex-mex dinner, it disappoints. 
We ordered a pitcher of raspberry margaritas and that is a mistake; the large mug is almost the same size and we noticed they stayed consistently slushy with that perfect texture while our pitcher had liquid marg on the bottom half and Icy marg on top.
Our waitress however was the sweetest ever!! One of the waiters accidentally dropped a bottle of hot sauce right next to my feet as he rushed past our table.... Splattered everywhere, but while he cleaned it up promptly, he put the \"wet floor\" danger sign almost under our table and four other waitstaff almost did a back flip on the wet spot on the floor. I kept pushing the sign out towards the area where it was wet and the waiter who dropped it kept pushing it back under our table.  The stress of watching all these \"almost\" work comp accidents was too much.  We hurried out ASAP. 
The food had a pasty texture like retried beans though they were not part of our dinners. 
Probably stick to genuine Mexican restaurant next time or belly up to the bar and order tapas style and \"mug o' marg\""}
{"text":"We went to Pedro's tonight for dinner.  We haven't been there in a couple of years, after having a mediocre dinner last time.  We thought we would give it another try.  BIG BIG BIG Mistake.

The place is filthy.  The entrance is a mess with cigarette butts all over.  The booths are appalling with the fabric frayed to the point that the foam rubber is showing.  There is dirt on every surface.

The food was awful.  The chips were very salty and the salsa is bland and uninspired.
The enchiladas (chicken) had little chicken.  The waiter brought my dinner and a lemon on the platter fell onto the table as he was delivering it.  Instead of taking it and getting another HE PICKED IT UP off of the table and placed it in the middle of my plate.

The restaurant will close sometime soon---no question about it.   There is so much deferred maintenance, the place is filthy, the food disgusting and the wait staff and management a group of amateurs who have no vested interest in providing good service.

I remember the Pedro's of years ago and it bares no resemblance to the disgusting restaurant it has become

If the cleanliness of the public spaces is any indicator I would hate to see what the kitchen looks like. I hope the health department makes a surprise visit sometime soon.

AVOID AT ALL COSTS."}
{"text":"It's interesting reading the reviews of Pedro's - mostly because these seem to be some of the biggest posturing jerks.
As for Pedro's - I won't disagree that this is a poor example of a Mexican Restaurant.  They finish preparation of most plates by running them through an oven - which has the result of drying out the sides (rice, beans for me) and sauce.  That being said...the tortillas are good, they have a good ground beef filling and a good pulled pork, and the atmosphere is family friendly.  Most servers speak english, and you generally have a server that pays attention as they should.  Food is prepared and presented in a timely manner.  The tableside guacamole is fun - build your own.
Just don't think of this as hard core mexican, and you'll probably find something that you'll like at a reaonable price.  I find it a comfortable place to stop for lunch/dinner and conversation."}
{"text":"The server didn't check before serving a dirty drink glass, the tables were full of dried on food in the cracks.  After a complaint about the dirty glass our server Ted said it wasn't a big deal and we shouldn't have gone to the manager and would have brought a new glass out.  He then argued with us swiped my card a threw the pen so I could sign.  As he was walking away he called me a bitch.  Needless to say we won't be dining there again."}
{"text":"Used to love this lace. Last time I was there bad food and bad service, scary restroom. Food order was incorrect, was not replaced and management was unresponsive. I will no longer recommend it, and will not be back."}
{"text":"Only 1 star because Yelp doesn't offer 1/2 a star. Waited over 30 minutes for our food. When my steak fajitas arrived I was given 5 small pieces of steak and some cooked onions. I couldn't believe they would actually serve such a miniscule portion, it was so pathetic and disappointing. My boyfriend's meal was also a sad failure with another stingy approach to serve beef tacos. Even getting out of this place was a struggle as the waiter did not give us our check several times after asking if we were through eating. Staff were  impolite to one another, but friendly to guests; still I don't want to hear staff bickering during my meal. The chips were warm and the salsa tased good. My margarita was not bad either, the best part of the entire experience. The waiter clearly sensed disappointment and gave a discounted meal.  Overall, Pedro's you have some extreme fixing to do."}
{"text":"Pedro's used to be a 5-star for us - back when they were on the West side.  The East location has never been as good, and it seems to be slipping. 

In all, the food was good.  Considering we were there at 3pm on a Saturday, and were mostly alone, you would think the food would have been piping hot when served.  It wasn't.  Granted, it wasn't cold either, but just not that \"fresh out of the oven\" kind of hot you would expect when there's nobody else there.  It tasted fine, and the chips and salsa were a trip down memory lane.

Service was excellent.  Brooks was on top of things.  Being his only table probably made that easy, but he was super nice and willing to get us anything we needed asap.  

The restaurant itself is aging.  A little work could be put into it to make it nice again.  There were more flies around than I prefer to have - that was a turn-off."}
{"text":"On two different occasions I have found dirty glasses on my table.  Last night there was a water glass turned upside down but with lipstick all around the rim.  The other time I had THREE GLASSES brought to me with stuff stuck at the bottom or floating in my water, 3 times...  That means, not once,  not twice but THREE times my server brought me a dirty glass...  You would think that at after the first glass that had crap floating in it he would be more thorough and check the next TWO..  No. Horrible experience. Manager came over and was like \"what would you like me to do\" ummm your the manager not me..  It was ridiculous.  I really enjoy Pedro's but it's becoming harder and harder to get myself to go,  my boyfriend hates it and only goes because I am trying to give it chances..  But come on.  Get your crap together"}
{"text":"Food is ok. Fajitas were pretty good. Enchiladas left much to be desired. Service is ok, kind of slow especially if you have 8 or more people. Table is served the standard chips and salsa. Also served fresh tortillas and butter which I have never seen anywhere else and were very good."}
{"text":"Not bad.  They had a great Valentine's Day special that we went here for, and the service was prompt and we got our food quickly.  Our waiter was friendly (they have been whenever I've gone) and the food was pretty tasty.  All in all, not much to separate Pedro's from the other Mexican restaurants in the area, and it certainly isn't the best out there, but decent in price, quality and service for sure (the Seafood Suiza is the best there, in my honest opinion, but all other foods are just ok)."}
{"text":"Pedro's is one of my families favorite Mexican restaurants. The service is usually hit or miss depending on the time of day and any events going on (game days, holidays etc). We usually wait about 10-15 minutes for a table but there is a large waiting area and bar. Meals come with complimentary chips, salsa and tortillas. All of which are delicious. My go-to on the menu is a chicken chimichanga with chicken sauce. The rest of my family usually orders differing flavors of chimichangas or fajitas. The best item on their menu is their delicious corn cakes- I usually get two of them as my 2 sides with my chimichanga. I like to convince myself they're somewhat healthy because theres corn in them right?"}
{"text":"Opinions are a changing.  Went to Pedros over the weekend.  Tamales were not good.  The sauce had formed a skin on the top because it sat under the heat lamps too long.  I took three bites before I found any pork.  I ate half of one and the waiter asked if I wanted to take the rest home.  When I said no, my satisfaction was not questioned.  I'll stick with Laredos."}
{"text":"I hate giving Pedro's 2.5 stars since it has always been my favorite restaurant growing up. But after visiting for a recent badger game, I found myself pretty underwhelmed  while the margs are cheap & our waiter was great, I gotta give the food a harsh 2.5(?) stars. Maybe I just didn't order the right thing (I used to get the veggie fajitas all the time so perhaps I should've stuck with em), but still I ordered a taco salad and it was kinda tiny for being $9. It only seemed like it had a few bites of lettuce to it, some beans, and some cheese on top. I think I ate it in 2 minutes flat (this may be due to the fact that I am a food inhaler, but still). My mom also got the \"game day special\" chicken quesadilla for $3-4, and was definitely not stoked when they brought her some pita-like bread (that definitely looked like it had been defrosted that morning) filled with some wimpy pieces of chicken and the saddest amount of cheese I've ever seen on a quesadilla. Yes, it's a $3 special, but a quesadilla needs some cheese ya know? ? ? So overall, it just wasn't what we were expecting from the restaurant we grew up loving. That being said, I hope our next visit is a lil more similar to the Pedro's I adored in 7th grade (bring back the old queso please). But if you do happen to be looking for some Americanized Mexican food that is cheap and usually tastes alright, I'd probably give this place a shot. Maybe just don't order the game day specials or the taco salads."}
{"text":"Another fantastic spread was provided to my office again today! Pedro's catering is such a great service, and I definitely still recommend them!! 

I just wanted to update my review and add a few photos. The service was yet again stellar. Everyone in my office was happy with full bellies, and I know for sure we will order catering again from Pedro's in the future. 

SO YUMMY!"}
{"text":"Their lunch specials are always quick and delicious. Reasonable price for lunch and you can get your appetitie going with chips and salsa."}
{"text":"Pedros is a staple in the community.  A great place where you can bring family and friends to have a really good time.  The food is all made fresh, which is great.  For the price and the selection, you really can't beat it.

One other thing to mention...  Have had a group event at Pedro's - and also a couple events catered.  The catering menu is great - and they make it really easy."}
