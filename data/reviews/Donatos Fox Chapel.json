{"text":"Seeing that fall is in full swing, I stopped by Donato's last week for their delicious Fall Harvest Salad with roasted pumpkin, bourbon-poached pear and shaved red onion on a bed of arugula tossed in a house made pumpkin-sage vinaigrette. 

It was a nice, big portion that was definitely big enough to satisfy two hungry people. The bourbon-poached pears elevated the salad from standard to stellar and brought memories of the holiday season.  Not only was the food great but the staff was super friendly and knowledgeable. Donato's has a very nice extensive wine list with customized wine bottles from the Pittsburgh Winery. I enjoyed my salad with a glass of Merlot from the Pittsburgh Winery...  The full-bodied red wine complimented my salad beautifully! Overall, I enjoyed my experience and will be back again."}
{"text":"Found the food and service poor. Seems to be more a place for older folks with expensive cars to be seen."}
{"text":"Had stopped going to Donatos about a year ago as food, service and ambiance became mediocre at best. When we heard there had been some major changes (head chef Donato leaving) we decided to give it another try......result further dissapointment.....Sat at bar and was a good 15 minutes before even offered a menu.....then we were asked if we wanted a small bread basket which we said yes please only for it to never materialize???...finally ordered and by then my wife was so annoyed she just orders a cup of soup and a zucchini appetizer.....her soup was SCALDING HOT and first wedding soup we have had that no meatballs at all were present....my soup was very cold???.....how does that happen??....I ordered a half dozen oysters on half shell that like the bread basket...NEVER SHOWED UP????....Had 2 8oz stuffed lobster tails which were just \"OK\" at best....only highlight of dinner were the Margarita cocktails but they should have been at $13 each.....now to get the check became another mission as honestly we were totally ignored it seemed....finally paid check and headed out...hostess at front stand could not have had a more miserable expression and attitude which both of us picked up on separately.......needless to say we will NOT be back again.....managment take note.....your surviving only due to no other real higher end option in the area.....shame as could be a \"go to\" spot but that isn't happening!!"}
{"text":"Easy reservation to get on a Thursday night. We used open table and it makes it so easy to make. And we even changed it two times as we added people. 

Started with the oysters and they were great. 

Had the broiled lobster stuffed with crab. Loved it. And it was a great portion for the $. It had to be at least a 3 lb tail. 

Server was a little off the mark with regards to here professionalism but it did the job. I expect she was either new or came from max and ermas.

Love the environment and I just hope it survives!!! It's the fanciest place in fox chapel."}
{"text":"Ouch.  Went here for lunch and it was painful.

I'll start with the food because that was the best part, and that's not saying much.  The lunch menu does not have much to choose from, but there were enough items that you got a sampling of the place.  I had a wedge salad and ravioli and they were just ok.  Others at the table were mixed, some liked there stuff a lot, others not so much.  For the prices?  I'd expect a bit more.

The service was just awful.  No other way to describe it.  There were only 4 total tables when we arrived, yet it took them forever to take our order or get drinks.  Multiple items were forgotten, apps were brought out with entrees, a few orders were wrong, and our server had no idea who got what.  She even said 'I should have paid attention to who ordered what...'

Skip this one!"}
{"text":"This was our first and last time to Donato's. I was looking forward to eating here for almost 4 days after I made our reservation. I looked over the menu before hand and was excited to order the Delmonico steak. It was no doubt the worst steak I have ever ordered. The cut of meat was something you would expect to get from a chain restaurant. I had to send the shrimp bisque soup back because it tasted like someone dumped a salt shaker into it. The sauce over the steak was also super salty. The mashed potatoes that came with the steak did not taste fresh or homemade, rather like potatoes from a bag. My wife had the short ribs which I tasted and wished I order that entree instead. Not great but 100% better than the steak. The worst part was the steak cost $40.00.  I would highly recommend The Capital Grille if you are craving a delicious mouthwatering steak."}
{"text":"Had dinner here tonight to celebrate a graduation. Menu had wide range of choices. We had a big party, so we tried steaks, veal, lamb pasta and everything else. Not a single complaint from anyone in out me party of 11. Loved the stuffed hot pepper as well as the meatball appetizers. I had the 8oz filet with truffle fries and sauce which was cooked to perfection, but I think the marinated lamb chops may have been the favorite in our group. Go here now!!"}
{"text":"Extremely poor service. Average food with a high price. Have been there twice with consistent results."}
{"text":"Decent italian food, if a bit pricey. Good meeting place (when there is no live music).  A vibrant bar scene, sometimes with live entertainment.  Good wine list."}
{"text":"Exquisite, from start to finish. Donato is the proprietor and head chef. Former head of the Capitol Grille, he brings the best steaks, chops and seafood in and finishes off the heady experience with high class takes on what his Italian grandmother used to make. 

Come for the bolognese, stay for the steaks, veal and best crabcakes north of Baltimore. Run, don't walk away from the mediocre desserts. But hurry back for a drink from the colorful bartender and the most mouth watering olives in Allegheny county. Don't worry your head over soup or salad, both are divine. If I'm feeling hungry, I'll get both.

Service is warm and impeccable. Speedy options for business lunches. Sit in the bar's booth area for an intimate dinner for two.

Don't hesitate to tell your server what you want: I want a quick dinner. I want a fast business lunch. I want to linger for 2 hours and snuggle on my sweetheart. I want more bread. They will accommodate you and project exactly the vibe you want to have mirrored back at you. Anticipating your needs? Hardly seen in Pittsburgh restaurants, but Donato's anticipates your needs politely and gracefully.

I eat everything and I eat everywhere in Pittsburgh and, without question, this is a consistent top 5 performer. 

Frankly I hate reviewing the places that I love because I don't want them overrun with idiots who ask to eat what Pittsburgh magazine told them to put in their craw. Well guarded secrets are bargaining chips and I'm always the big stack. 

But because of the economy being in the toilet and the nontraditional location (in Fox Chapel), I'm swallowing my pride and telling you twits to go eat there so I, selfishly, don't lose one of the greatest places in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Solid Italian, light year's better than Franco's which formerly held it's location for years.  I don't know that it's worth the price, and it's a tad overrated, but it's generally pretty good food, they don't do many things spectacularly, but they do most well, which is more than enough sometimes."}
{"text":"Wow, I am really surprised about the other review! This is a restaurant that has a decor like an Italian restaurant, but the food is OUTSTANDING. We ordered 2 dishes for pasta and come to find out you can switch out the sauces so we did lower priced dishes with the better sauces. WELLL it was awesome!!! I was thinking the price would be high but it isn't any more then going to a Bravo's or other Italian restaurants. BUT it is local plus you get a salad or soup and great bread included in the meal! All and all it was outstanding and I would be so willing to go across the city to visit Donato's again!!!"}
{"text":"Came here on 5/17 with a large group. Not knowing what to expect, but with an open mind, I noticed right away from the decor that this is a classy joint. As far as ambience and service, I really have no complaints. However, seating is extremely cramped. OK, I can look past that. So the group orders the bone marrow for an appetizer as recommended by our waitress. As it went around, I decided to pass (as did a few others) as it did not appeal to me. Those who did eat it were not impressed. I did not hear anyone say, \"Wow, this is great!\" For my meal, I kept it simple... A New York Strip, medium with garlic butter. A whopping $43. Now, I've been to my share of high-end steakhouses, so for $43 I had some pretty high expectations. It came with a salad (I had a choice between soup or salad). The salad was bland and dry. OK, no big deal because the steak is coming, right? WRONG. The steak arrived, overcooked, to the point where there was no pink center at all. It was beyond well done. It didn't taste much better, either. I'm guessing the cook just threw a hunk of beef in the oven and then added garlic butter afterwards for some \"flavor.\" No char at all on the outside, and overcooked on the inside. And I call him a cook because he (or she) is definitely not a chef. This steak was on par with one you would get at Denny's. This restaurant is very underwhelming for such a high price tag. I felt like we paid for a Rolls Royce but received a Yugo. They must not have much competition in Pittsburgh, because this place wouldn't survive anywhere else. One member of our group did not join us. When I saw him the next day, he said, \"I've been there before... I wasn't impressed with their food.\" I totally get that now."}
{"text":"I really had high hopes for this place but it missed my expectations. The atmosphere is intimate, and not for you and your partner but for you, your partner and whoever is in the table next to you, IT SO CRAMMED. They seated us in a small two top hardly large enough fit a plate....we quickly moved to a 4 top with still little to no room. We got the calamari by recommendation. My hubby loved the peppers and calamari. I thought the calamari inside was cooked perfectly but the outside was mushy, it was OK. I couldnt decide what I wanted so I panicked and got crab cakes. My love got the delmonico and frites it was 44$ meal. Salad with house dressing way too sour he didn't finish his. My Caesar salad wasn't great. Our entrees came out and I took two bites of my crab cakes and quickly started to feel ill hubby shared his steak with me which they raved about its \"genetically\" mutated  value. Bullshit. I had better delmonico at Wal-Mart, the truffle frites were pretty much cut up raw potatoes covered in oil with crusty cheese they sucked, I was embarrassed I even recommend he get them, way better at burgatory. My crab cakes I ended up giving to my other half along with my cold spinach. Did I mention our food sat under a heat lamp for a long time? How do I know this? Well the lemon served with my meal was hot and seared they plated it way to early. Guh I wasted a beautiful night out wishing we spent the 130$ at the casino. Also I would like to add however the wait staff young nice and kind just not up to par for \"fine\" dining. Id say one word \"wannabes\" Also it a whole day later and both he and I still feeling ill most likely crab cake related.

Oh fun fact they brought out olives at first with \"cheese\" hahaha my love ate the butter wedge so  quickly honest mistake he thought it was cheese. I was mad he didn't share the \"cheese.\" so he asked for another piece the waiter was so baffled he went to ask the bus boy what was on the plate. He came back quickly with another wedge of butter lol. My hubby ate the butter lol was the funniest thing ever lol. This is why Im doing the reviews and not him he doesn't know the difference between butter and cheese LOL."}
{"text":"This is a nice restaurant for a  business lunch or dinner. I enjoyed my meal, the crab cakes with a side salad. The crab cakes were huge and all crab.  I would go again."}
{"text":"One of the top five Best Restaurants in Pittsburgh!

I was trying to find somewhere new and different to take my wife for Mother's Day and I immediately thought of Donato's as she LOVES Italian food.

I was able to easily book our reservation on my phone using the Open Table app. At the time of reservation I requested a booth.  I even got a telephone reminder from the restaurant of the date and time of our reservation. When we arrived we were greeted by the host, our jackets taken and we were escorted to our booth.

Our waiter, John C. quickly came and took our drink orders and placed fresh warm bread on the table. Our favorite was the bread that was similar to pizza. I could eat that stuff all day long! 

F.Y.I. They do have a kid's menu but, it's not listed in the menu. You just have to ask. They offer a huge cheeseburger, chicken tenders and a kids version of just about every pasta on the menu. Our daughter got her usual cheeseburger and fries and absolutely loved them($10).

The wife ordered the Tagliatelle Bolognese ($15), a pasta dish with beef, pork and veal. I tried the Lasagna Fresca ($16). Each entree comes with either soup or salad. Tamika got a salad and I got the Crab Bisque. It was the best I have EVER had. I wanted to drink out of the bowl, it was that good!

My wife thought her Bolognese was outstanding. My Lasagna was good but, not life changing. My portion was quite small compared to her huge bowl of pasta and my noodles were over cooked and almost mushy. I prefer my pasta just past al dente.

The service was OUTSTANDING! Tied for the best we've had in any restaurant. Our glasses never got empty. All of the waiters work as a team. If a different waiter walks by and notices a  empty plate he/she whisks it away without you even noticing it.

At the end of the meal we were each given a tasty ginger snap type of cookie and my wife was given a white rose which is her favorite color rose.

My only complaints are that my Lasagna noodles were overcooked and portion was small for the price and the kids burger is expensive @ ($10). 

I do highly recommend Donato's and will be back often."}
{"text":"This particular visit we were a paltry party of 6, we were treated like royalty.  The restaurant's ability and willingness to accommodate everyone in our party was second to none.  The organic salmon done a perfect medium, the steaks yummy, veal Oscar style (tender), the appetizers; stuffed banana peppers (stuffed with tuna), Tuna tartare, seared prosciutto wrapped shrimp, (complimentary) meatballs were great - the stuffed banana peppers were a tad bland (the tuna filling) - but executed well.  

Our server, Eddie (who we request when making reservations) is knowledgeable, attentive (but not intrusive) and completely made our dinner comfortable and a terrific experience!!"}
{"text":"I'd say good overall, but over rated and over priced. My wife and I made the trip to Fox Chapel to try the place out and I can say, it was just okay (with one exception - see below).  I had the eggplant parm. which was way over sauced and exceptionally soggy.  My wife had the Scampi - not too impressed.  We had the Calamari as an appetizer and it was fine - not exceptional.  Our salads (the Donato salad and a cesar were only okay). The prices are tailored for the Fox Chapel crowd -- and they can have it.

There was one exception and bright spot -- the Tiramisu was, without a doubt, the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"I will not be going to Donato's again.  I have Celiac's disease and called ahead to find out if they offer gluten-free meals.  I was informed that there were a few options and to just inform my server about my issue.  When we arrived for lunch and I questioned the server which items on the menu are gluten-free, she did not know and said \"does that just mean no bread\".  I was fine her response as I thought perhaps she is a new employee.  I questioned her further and she did not seem to care much about my issue.  She then suggested a few items on the menu and when I asked if she knew for certain that the items were considered gluten-free, she did not know.  I politely informed her that certain additives such as seasonings, etc., may not be gluten free.  She took the position that they were gluten-free without bothering to verify or ask the chef.  I was still fine with her not knowing for certain so I asked to speak with the chef to discuss gluten-free options.  I have done this numerous times at other restaurants since being diagnosed 5 years ago and have never been told no.  Most places are very accommodating to assist customers with dietary needs.  Without even asking the chef herself, the server told me that the chef would not be able to speak with me because they are too busy.  When I called ahead a few days earlier, I was told that they can do crab cakes without the breading.  I asked the server about it and I was informed that they cannot do the crab cakes gluten-free, but they could do crab meat over a salad and it comes with a lemon balsalmic vinaigrette.  I asked if the vinaigrette was gluten-free and the server said \"it should be.\"  I asked if she could please verify that is was gluten-free and I did not receive an encouraging response.  I then went to the bar and asked the bartender if I could speak with the manager on duty.  I was told there was not a manager present.  I told him that I was trying to find gluten-free options and he told me that the server should be able to help.  I kindly informed him that the server was no help to me and I asked if he could get the chef.  I was told that the chef was too busy to speak with me.  So both the server and the bartender refused to ask the chef if he/she could speak to a customer with dietary needs.  
I ended up getting the crab salad and felt fine afterwards so the meal met my dietary needs.  However, I found out later that the General Manager was called in to the restaurant because of my conversation with the server and bartender.  She arrived while we were at lunch (we were there from ~ 1pm to 3pm) and NEVER bothered to come over and speak with me. 
This restaurant apparently is not concerned with trying to fulfill customer requests or even trying to be accommodating.  I don't expect restaurants to be able to serve gluten-free items.  However, if you tell customers over the phone that you do have items that can be gluten-free and then don't do anything to accommodate the customer, it leaves a bad taste.  The fact that the GM was called into the restaurant by the bartender because of my request and never bothered to talk with me says it all.  I definitely will not be going back to Donato's in Fox Chapel."}
{"text":"Lobster stuffed with crab was so delicious, steak was cooked perfectly. Will definitely be back again. Service was also fantastic"}
{"text":"I really enjoy Donato's. The food is terrific-love the pasta sauce and chocolate rubbed steak!! Great wine list!!!

I've taken company, out of towners, etc. there. Really impressive!"}
{"text":"Great food, decent prices, since most of the entrees come with either soup or salad.  The portion is big!!  There were 8 people in our party, and most of us have to get a to-go boxes.  The service was so accommodating to my father-in-law's requests.  
Three of our parties ordered the shrimp and scallops and it was awesome!!!  The shrimps and scallops were huge and the pasta was really good too!!  We really enjoyed our dinner there!  Hope to come back here when we visit Pittsburgh again!"}
{"text":"It's pretty good.  I do not know of any other fine-dining choices in Fox Chapel, which helps this place.  But compared to what's down the road in Pittsburgh, this place would really pale.

The setting is very nice.  It looks and feels right.  The bar is a bit of a time-warp back to the late 1980s, but the dining feels nice.  The noise-level is good - comfortable \"chatter\" but not too loud, so it's good for a proper business lunch.

Service is attentive but just not as professional as it should be to match the style and price-point.  Prepare for a wait-staff who will ask you to pass a dirty plate to him/her, or will make an awkward reach across the table.  (You would never see this at Capital Grille, for example.)

The food is good but not amazing.  I've tried a few salads, the salmon, and a steak.  The greens are fresh and the salmon is well prepared.  The one time I tried the New York Strip was a disappointment.  The cut and quality were good, but my medium temperature came out medium well to well done.  (A huge miss for a $42 steak.)

They do take care of their regulars and seem flexible with reservations and for accommodating large groups.  They have a private room in back that works very well for groups up to maybe 15 or so."}
{"text":"I stopped in for lunch and am kicking myself for not getting here sooner.  What a fantastic lunch menu!  Our party sat in the bar area and Danny, the bartender, was also our waiter.  He was upbeat and attentive and treated us like we were old friends.  He started us off with some fresh bread that was pretty dang good.  The herbed butter was a nice touch.  For my meal,  I opted for the Italian panini and was not disappointed.  The quality of ingredients were well worth the price of $16.  This included a side of yummy french fries too!  Everyone in my group was pleased with their meals, although one of my dining companions noted that the Caprese panini was a bit messy to eat.  

Don't let the unassuming exterior fool you - the dining room and bar are actually very nice and have great ambiance.  I haven't scoped out their dinner menu, but the lunch is enough for me to check this place out again.  I know they're known for their meatballs, as I've sampled more than I can count at various events around town, so perhaps the meatball sandwich will be my next indulgence!"}
{"text":"They mean well, but they tend to just mimic a kind of semi-swank 90's steak/seafood house. The decor resembles that of an okay Hilton. The service is friendly but sometimes rather slow. The food is decent, but nothing special (steaks that are alright, ceasar salads with too much dressing etc). It is a last-resort kind of place when everything else has a long line."}
{"text":"Tonight's visit was our first visit to Donato's, and it was my best friend's birthday. I made reservations for 2, and we were promptly seated to a beautiful table for 2 decorated & personalized just for my friend.  She was very surprised and happy!
After our soup, salad and bread, our meals arrived: I had the filet mignon oscar and the birthday girl had the night's special of surf & turf.  INCREDIBLE. Beautifully prepared and every bite was succulent and made to perfection. The steak MELTED with each bite and the seafood was fantastic. There was not a bad bite. Both of us were over the moon with our meals and every bite in between. We had wonderful wine and creme brulee for dessert. Needless to say, we left very happy & full. The staff and service was impeccable and we felt special & taken care of. The **only** thing missing was meeting Chef D, who unfortunately was not in the kitchen tonight. (It'll give us an excuse to go back!)  THANK YOU DONATO'S!!"}
{"text":"It's sad that a previously great restaurant has deteriorated to the meal my family and I had last night. We were seated and spent considerable time waiting for our server. We ordered drinks and waiting even longer for the server to bring sweetener for my wife's iced tea. The wedding soup was hot and tasty, but after waiting a prolonged period of time for our meals, we were presented with a veal chop which was raw and needed to be sent back and uninspiring spaghetti with meatballs. When the chop returned, it was gristly and my mother had to choose another meal.  They used to feature prime meats, but the server said another table had a problem with their chops as well.   Pappardella bolognese and seafood risotto were adequate, but service was poor all night, with the server asking us if we wanted beverage refills and not bringing them. We won't be back until food and service improves."}
{"text":"Just enjoyed our second dinner at Donato's. I compare this restaurant with Morton\"s which we go to a lot. The steaks are larger and better than Mortons and the pricing is a little better but not by much.  You get very good food here. The setting is very pretty and the service is great. We had Samantha and we like to eat slow and she adjusted to us and we were very pleased. I had the filet topped with a large amount of crab meat served with asparagus and Bearnaise, just decadent. My wife had the bone in filet which she loved. We shared an appetizer of stuffed banana peppers which was very good and huge. Would highly recommend this restaurant, at least for meat lovers."}
{"text":"It's hard finding upscale vegan food.  I always order fried eggplant, linguine w/tomato sauce (specially made), bread w/ a side of olive oil and garlic (dip).  The eggplant is coated with soymilk (not eggs) and the chef makes a special bechamel sauce with soymilk... BONUS POINTS!  How many places will do that?  That plus a salad for $25.  I can't eat all of it in one sitting.  It usually takes 2-3 days.

yummmmmmmy!"}
{"text":"After my recent experience at Donato's I'm honestly stunned by the bad reviews. Donato's is on the top 25 (34) Pittsburgh restaurants this year and I couldn't agree more. The service was phenomenal! THE best service I have had all year. Yes, the food is a bit pricey but well worth it to me. Also, Donato's has many deals out right now including a burgh bargains deal and even better, a travelzoo deal which, for a couple, includes an app, two entrees, a side dish and two glasses of wine for 69$ or double that for four people- 135$. We went with the four person deal and joined another couple on a recent Friday night. 
The decor was nice- table cloths, large photos/paintings of Italy. Surprisingly, the restaurant was quite dead. We were one of about 5 tables leaving about 3/4 of the restaurant empty. As we were coming in, we noticed a jazz band setting up in the bar area which was fantastic dinner music.
Our waitress came over immediately to get our drinks. She also asked us if we had been to Donato's before. We had not so, she brought us out their famous meatballs on the house. Who would turn down free meatballs? Wow. What a great start to our meal. Tender, juicy and a hint of spice. Hubs and I decided on our appetizer- shrimp wrapped in mozzarella and proscuitto. Before our app came out, the waitress asked about our drinks. When I gave her a half hearted \"ok\" she probed further to discover my discontent. I explained that the wine I had ordered was not what I was expecting but I was fine with it. She asked if she could bring me something else but I declined. I really was \"ok\" with it. A few minutes later, she arrived at our table with a tasting of another wine she thought I might enjoy. I did take a liking to that wine but again assured her that my current glass of wine was fine. Before our apps arrived, we were served a bread basket with three different types of bread. Wonderful breads but nothing to dip them in which made me a little sad. Not to worry, our apps soon arrived and I fell in love with the huge shrimp skillfully wrapped in soft mozzarella and crispy proscuitto. I could have lived without the pickled eggplant underneath the shrimp. 
On to the next course. Soup or salad to go with our entrees. I ordered the wedding soup. Perfect with lots of spinach and cheese. At this point I am pretty full. Then our entrees arrive. Are you kidding me? This was huge.Hubs ordered the filet oscar and I ordered the 10 oz filet with seasonal vegetable- green beans. We also got the truffle mac as a side dish. I took a deep breath, got my second wind and dug in. The green beans were crisp and flavorful. The filet was oh so tender and juicy. And the truffle mac? Rich, creamy and decadent. Now this was a meal! Unfortunately, I could only make it through about a third of it before I had to tap out. No worries. My filet and truffle mac made for a wonderful lunch the next day. The only downfall I see in Donato's menu was the dessert. Yes, I looked despite my growing waistline. Nothing jumped out at me. The basics were there, tiramasu, gelato, sorbetto but, nothing interesting and different that I just HAD to try. All in all, Donato's has fantastic food and great service. If it's the price that steers you away, keep your eyes open for a deal."}
{"text":"Hubby ran in for a takeout and the entrée was ok...noodles and clams. He ordered a serving of lobster bisque and was disappointed in the quality. He was also overcharged $5.  When he spoke to the manager the next day, the manager admitted he had been overcharged but refused to refund the money...told him he now has a $5 credit to a restaurant that overcharged him and served him subpar food. Well they can keep that fiver and enjoy it because they will not be getting any more of  our money."}
{"text":"Food here is overpriced for what it is. If they dropped the prices down a bit, it might be worth it. However, the service is god-awful. Some of the most aloof, clueless servers I've ever had. Bottom line: This place is NOT worth it."}
{"text":"A high end restaurant not worth the price.  The service from our waitress was subpar and food was not worth the price.  Needless to say, this will be my last visit here and so should  be yours!"}
{"text":"I love Italian!!  But, I usually get the same thing whenever I go.....eggplant parm.  So I had to try the eggplant parm at Donato's.  Really Really good eggplant parm!  It comes with red and white sauce.  It is really rich, but has lots of flavor.  The restaurant is a bit stuffy, but the food is good.  I felt a bit under dressed in black pants and a top, but could have just been the night I went.  I am not on that side of town often, but would go back if I was."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been going to this restaurant since it changed from Franco's.  Every time before this visit, I was very happy with service and quality. We moved to a different part of town and hadn't been there in about a year or so.  Going for Valentine's Day dinner was the worst experience here I've had.  
I called in advance to notify staff of my fish & seafood allergies so I could get seated away from the kitchen; I was assured this would be the case.  When we arrived, we did get seated in a rear corner seat - NEXT TO THE KITCHEN.  I didn't complain, I medicated and put my EpiPen on the table.  
I explicitly told my waitress to notify the chefs of my food allergies .... and when she brought our plates, she had my husband's lobster & sole dish balanced on the edge of my plate.  She should be thankful that he took care of the bill when I went to the ladies room. I wouldn't have given the 25%+ tip that he did. 
The ambiance is not the same. 
Chef D (donato) is no longer the executive chef here.  I will be looking for a different fine dining favorite. 
Still give 3 stars for good food, hostess friendliness & prompt attention from bus staff (a young man that brought water, bread and checked on us & the other patrons regularly)"}
{"text":"Great food, service and atmosphere.  The mushroom risotto is out of this world. The bartender makes a mean dirty martini! Very clean and the staff is very professional."}
{"text":"My wife and I tried this place for the first time and it was a a very good visit. 

We started our meal with two appetizers oysters and Brussels Sprouts. The oysters were served raw on the half shell and had a mignonette sauce and fresh made cocktail sauce. Very well done. The sprouts were fried and seasoned with a good amount of salt and pepper but not over seasoned.  

My wife had the filet and I had the osso bucco special. The filet was obviously sourced by someone who understands quality meat. Grill and seasoned correctly. The osso bucco was also done very well. The kitchen staff obviously knows how to use quality ingredients and respect them in preparation. 

I guess the best compliment I could give us that we were so full of our meal that we did not even entertain the thought of dessert. A very good value for the money"}
{"text":"Awful service and overpriced. Waited over an hour from reservation time to be seated. 
If you are going to spend $60 on a meal go to town not fix chapel. Mediocre food at inflated prices with a horrible front of house."}
{"text":"I stopped by here a couple of Fridays ago with my fiance and 2 other dining companions.  We had made reservations earlier in the week but whenever we arrived it was obvious that we didn't need them as at least 75% of the restaurant was open and never did fill up.  The inside is decorated tastefully with neutral colors and dark woods  with the white linen table cloths that you would expect from a finer dining establishment.  

Our waitress came over to greet us in a reasonable time period and asked if we had ever been there before.  After hearing all of say no, she told us that she would get us some of their meatballs on the house while taking our drink order.  I ended up going with a bourbon drink that was really good and whose name I wish that I could remember.  One of our dining companions ended up going with a wine that she wasn't too fond of.  After she had mentioned it the waitress came over and asked her what was wrong with the drink.  After some cajoling she got it out of her that she wasn't a big fan of the wine and even brought over a sample of a different wine that she would happily replace it with.  I guess it my dining companions face that gave away her thoughts about the wine but it almost seemed like they had a microphone on the table.  The service was that good and it stayed that way throughout our dinner. In the meantime we put in our food orders with my fiance and I decided to split the calamari Diavolo as an appetizer, while I went with the Delmonico Steak & Frites for my entree and then the truffle macaroni sounded good enough that we also decided to split that as a side.  First up for the food was the order of meatballs for both couples (it ended up being a large meatball for each person) at our table.  They were covered in a marinara type sauce and were a great start to the meal.  The meat was moist, tender and juicy and went well with the marinara sauce.  Next up was the calamari diavolo which was awesome.  Since I am a fan of spiciness, I absolutely love it whenever they put banana peppers with calamari as they did here.  The spiciness does well to pair with the mild sweetness of the calamari.  It was all covered in a San Marzano tomato sauce which was nice.  The taste of it was awesome and I think that it was probably my second favorite calamari in Pittsburgh.  The only thing that I didn't enjoy about it was that the breading got a bit soggy with the sauce but I easily overlooked that due to the taste.  Our entrees came next with the side of truffle macaroni.  My steak was pretty enormous and I was impressed with the size of it while the frites that came beside it had a nice truffle smell to them.  The steak was cooked perfectly to the medium that I has asked for and was juicy and delicious.  The frites were also very good as the smell and taste of the truffle helped to elevate them beyond your normal frites.  Last but not least was the truffle macaroni which ended up being my least favorite portion of the meal.  It was more of a watery macaroni and cheese with the truffle oil and although I thought it tasted ok, it was not nearly at the same level as the rest of our meal was.  After we had finished our meal the waitress asked all of us if we wanted to take a look at the dessert menu.  While we acquiesced, I knew that I wasn't going to get anything as the meal had left me completely stuffed.

The bottom line for me is that I would head here again in a heartbeat.  Yes the prices are a bit more than some other places but the food was excellent and the service was the best that I have had in a long time.  As the old adage goes \"you often get what you pay for\" and I think that Donato's was well worth the money."}
{"text":"For years we drove past this restaurant until one evening we decided to give it a try. 
The service was awesome and the meal was easily the best we've had. 
Since this was our first time we were given a complimentary meatball. Ok..,,odd. But these were incredible. My wife is gluten free and they were extremely accommodating even making a special meatball for her. 
The appetizers were great and the steaks done to perfection. 
Their house red wine, which has their own label, was spectacular. Full body. Complemented the steaks perfectly. Next time (Monday!) we'll be getting bottles not glasses. 
While quite expensive it's worth it. 
Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Great experience at Donatos today with my family for Easter.  Started our experience with a courtesy call Saturday afternoon confirming our reservation.  As a large party with three toddlers we were thoughtfully seated in their private dining room which relieved the anxiety of worrying that the kids might disrupt other patrons.  Our server was wonderful and very attentive.  The food was incredible.  The buffet was very attractive and well garnished.  Having pork osso buco as an option was a very pleasant surprise and really made my day.  I don't have a taste for lamb but the prime rib and turkey was perfect.  I really wish I liked smoked salmon because the display really caught my eye.  All in all I would say that the menu was cool with a really nice taste of the classics.  My family commented multiple times that this was the nicest brunch that we have visited in a very long time."}
{"text":"Went for dinner on Saturday night.  Seated promptly with a reservation.  Server was at best marginal.  Recited specials with no price indication (probably restaurant policy).  Served bottled beer to my wife and she had to ask for a glass (class?).  Was told that the 'organic' salmon was farm raised which could be but would be unusual.  Ordered the bow ties with 'salmon bits' but the 'bits' were white (fish?).  We had to ask for Parmesan cheese for my pasta and my wife's appetizer.  I had to ask for a refill for my club soda.  Had to ask for a dessert menu.  Forks after the appetizers were basically dropped on the table by a busboy then removed and replaced by the server..  Serving / plate removal service protocol ignored.  Service slow for our table as other patrons arrived and left before we were served.  All in all, a forgettable experience."}
{"text":"We took our family here last night to celebrate Mother's Day.  There were 4 people in our party that got Lobster Bisque with their entree.  The waiter, Andrew, said it would be a slight up-charge for this soup versus the wedding soup.  We said, sure that's fine, not thinking it would be $8 for a cup and $16 for a bowl.  The most expensive steak houses in the US don't even charge that much!  The service was very poor too.  Our waiter rolled his eyes when we asked for more water and butter.  To top off the night, the pasta dinners were served cold.  We were visiting from Michigan and wanted a nice evening with our family.  Good thing the company was great, because this place was awful.  Over-priced and will not go back."}
{"text":"My wife and I had dinner tonight at Donato's for the first time.  We really enjoy going out to eat and appreciate excellent food and service, without trying find places with \"ragu\" or \"comfit\" on the menu.  We were looking for a new place to try, something special for our anniversary, and Donato's fit the bill perfectly.  It's a fine dining establishment that doesn't try to outdo itself.  The prices were probably a bit higher than average, not at all what we'd consider to be very expensive, but the overall experience was well worth the cost.  Our waiter Matthew was very good.  He delivered just the right mix of being cordial and attentive without being overbearing; we never felt that we were waiting for anything.  We mentioned that it was our anniversary, and they did a few nice little things to acknowledge the occasion which made us feel great.  The food was very good.  The chicken Milanese was cooked just right, and the spaghetti diavolo was excellent.  The only thing that I'd have changed was using fresh banana peppers instead of pickled for the diavolo, but I'm sure many people would prefer it the way it was served.  The cheesecake for dessert was also excellent.  The atmosphere was very nice and aside from the tables being somewhat close together, it was a great place for a dinner for two.  We will definitely be going back again to celebrate other special occasions!"}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite places to go. The food is amazing. The service is always on point. We love sitting at the bar where Chris and Matt make the evening fun and introduce us to the best items on the menu. Donatos is our favorite place to have a great meal and a great time."}
{"text":"Very very very slow service took about 35 minutes to get a salad and oysters and there was only 6 people in the restaurant. add an extra hour to your meal plan food is ok overpriced"}
{"text":"On  a  cold and snowy Friday night in the burgh....not much was happening anywhere. However a few brave friends of mine ventured out to hear one of our favorite Pittsburgh singers perform in the lounge area. Picture this scenario; restaurant empty, tables in the bar with reserved signs - empty, not a lot happening. My 4 friends and I easily secured one of the also empty seats at the bar, we ordered dinner and appetizers. The food is passable as well as the service as long as you don't get Christopher, he only caterers to the \"A\" list people women are invisible. (May I kindly add that  none of us are economically challenged) About our group: None of us are heavy drinkers, in fact given the icy weather conditions getting seriously buzzed was not a particularly responsible decision. I was taking an antibiotic my other friend has a disability and cannot drink and the other ladies decided not to tempt fate. Our average bill was a respectable $70.00 per person. Imagine our horror when we were asked to leave because we were drinking water, coffee and tea with our deserts. I know I don't drive a Bentley and I assume the owner David Tasone can boot people out of his playground whenever he so desires. As for me and my friends we are taking our money where we get treated respectfully, like the Fairmont, food is better there anyway. As one of the world travelers in my group the general consensus was the have never been treated so rudely. Do not go here if you do not have a man in attendance and at least one alcoholic.  You  will be disappointed."}
