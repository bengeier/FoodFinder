{"text":"Don't think just Spanish tapas here. It is a very creative fusion of Spanish, Asian and Caribbean. Corey does a great job balancing the flavors. Nicely plated presentation too. It would be a 5 Star, but they are still working through the new restaurant kinks with the service. A great place for a date night in a good location between Huntersville and Concord."}
{"text":"I love tapas so when I saw this, I had to go check it out. To start off, I love the name! When we first walked in, we made eye contact with one worker and it was so awkward like is he going to seat us or what do I do, do we seat ourselves kinda thing? So he then said the servers are going to be with us soon. So we stood there and then there were staff standing and talking to each other at the bar. The chef, I believe, finally told us to seat ourselves. Once we did, one of the girls came and got our drinks and once again told us the servers will be with us. I have no idea where the servers came from, but like I was confused on the whole setup, we didn't see servers for maybe 10 minutes. I believe the manager then came and asked if we needed menus... which of course we did, since the unknown server has not yet come. Everyone was genuinely nice, but it seemed so unorganized.   Now the food: it was decent. I don't know what goes on behind the scenes, do we ever know? They set it up so you can see the chef cooking your food. I am not going to lie, most of the dishes we got tasted like it was frozen food. The best thing were the potatoes. The chicken... absolutely had to be frozen. You can tell from the color and how the bite came off. We also got the Chef's Special (Crawfish Sushi). It was so fishy, it took over the whole dish. Of course, it's seafood and I know like the fishiness is inevitable, BUT there are ways to mask the fishiness to enhance the flavor of the dish. The crawfish seemed like it was kept cold, causing it be more fishy than it should be.   I love the vibes, the lights, and the decor. The food is okay, and I am not sure how accurate I am with how everything is prepared, but it certainly tasted that way to me."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed in this place. The scallops were burned, and the other finger food was oily.  I wouldn't go back here although it is around the corner."}
{"text":"Pangea is a welcome addition to the area.  It's located between Marco Pizza and Three Amigos.  The space is on the small side but there is a patio and the website states that the venue can be used for private events.  The small plate menu is sprinkled with Caribbean inspired dishes.  They were out of beef patties, so I ordered the special of the night, curry chicken over rice.  The chicken was seasoned well, and I believe there were pieces of pineapple included in the sauce, and the rice was very fresh.  I ordered take out on this visit, but I plan to return soon to try some of the amazing looking cocktails that are on the drink menu."}
{"text":"This was the second time I have eaten at Pangea. I went with a friend and we sat at the bar. We ordered the potatoes, shrimp tacos (from a new menu they are about to launch) and jerk chicken. Everything tasted delicious. We especially enjoyed the crispy potatoes with yummy aioli. They have kinks to work out. They were out of two dishes we tried to order, also they were out of a bunch of different wines on their wine list. Overall a good experience though. We need more places like this in the area. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Lovely set up, great food, and the owners are amazing!! As soon as you step in they give big warm welcomes and try to accommodate you as much as possible. I have been there 3 times since they've opened and can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"I love tapas, so I was surprised when the menu didn't have the \"Spanish tapas\" ; however the bartender explained that they were trying to do tapas from around the world... great!  Something new!   We ordered the shrimp, tasty, but small. And the \"beef patty\". It was really good, spicy!  (Not really a patty though, more like a turnover).   Edward the chef took pride in his work and came to see how we liked it. Nice personal touch.   Ty, the hostess and bartender did her best to accommodate our drink request, but the cocktails were just ok. They were either flat, warm or too sweet. She had a nice personality though to overlook this.   The owner probably should be on hand though. One employee took several shots of liquor while working, as his girlfriend laid her head on the countertop. Not professional in demeanor or attire.   I hope they make it, because it would be nice to eat something different than the typical chain restaurant food."}
{"text":"I found out about it while I was surfing a neighborhood forum. We live practically around the corner and had no idea it even existed. We decided to try it out for dinner one night and we were glad we did. The interior is a little tight but there is additional seating outside. The food was really good. I had the crab cakes and they were light and fresh. We went on a night when they had live entertainment so it got a little loud but we enjoyed the band. The waitstaff was friendly and quick. We will definitely return sometime in the near future. Good eats at Pangea. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed this place , we shared tapas , the Brussel sprouts are delicious, so are the crab cakes , great wine selection, I will come back for brunch !!! 11 to 4 pm sundays !!"}
{"text":"I loved everything. Drinks...perfect and strong. Jerk chicken...delicious and spicy. Shrimp..honestly just perfect and not over cooked. Patatas crispy outside, decadent inside. Who knew you could take a potato to this level?!?!  Great service."}
{"text":"Cool place, nice staff. Ackee and saltfish, plantains and beef patties were good. Jerk chicken was fair. A little sweet, must be trying to appeal to local tastes. Don't! You guys do you."}
{"text":"Checked this place out tonight for drinks. I ordered the pineapple moscato drink special for $7.50. It was good but could have used more ice or either chilled alcohol/wine. I also ordered the cheesesteak egg rolls. They were amazing and came out very quick. Staff was very attentive. We went around 7 and there were not many people there. Business seemed family owned which I loved. They have a nice patio space for outdoor dining/drinking as well. I will definitely return."}
{"text":"The ideas are good and the food was good but it needs some improvement. The music was too loud and in the hour and a half we were there, they played one song 5 times, sometimes, in a row.   The Patatas Bravas were great! The plantains were good. The beef patties were a bit too spicy for my liking, but my fianc√© said they were great too. Unfortunately, the menu is so small that i didn't feel the need to come back and try more. Especially since there were 3 dishes on the already small menu that they weren't serving anymore.   When we got there around 7pm there was only one other table seated and no one else came in until about 10 minutes before we left.   I probably won't go back."}
{"text":"Went here last night to meet new friends. The interior is a bit small as some have stated but I LOVED the atmosphere.   We met at 7 p.m. There weren't many people and the vibe was laid back and casual. As the evening progressed, the space filled up but was still comfortable.  The staff was friendly and welcoming. The food was tasty (two of us had plantains and two of us had the crab cakes) and looked beautiful on the plates. My drink was pretty as well.  They appeared to be setting up for a (private?) party as we were winding down. Sound equipment was being brought to the patio, the tables out there were being covered in cloth, I saw a few \"reserved\" signs on tables inside, people who were well-attired in casual evening garb began arriving... I wish we could have stayed to check out the happenings but I was too tired. *sigh*  I'm so sorry I didn't get pictures but I was so busy talking and laughing with my new friends that it really did slip my mind. But this place is only 20 minutes from me and I WILL return so photos next time y'all!"}
{"text":"Great food excellent atmosphere!! The menu changes but most everything I had here was really good . Great outside for cigar smokers ."}
{"text":"My friend and I ate at Pangea for the first time. Food was good as was the service. I would recommend adding more fish items to the menu and always offer the customer more sauces with their plate. Vanessa was our bartender and she accommodated our requests to turn down loud music, get drinks and service us in a timely way."}
{"text":"New food spot alert!! Pangea Tapas Bar & Grill is simply amazing!! The staff was great! The chef came out to speak to us and made sure we were enjoying our meal. So delicious!! Darius, thank you for going the extra mile!  Honey Hot Shrimp with Honey Glaze and Garlic Mash Potatoes; Ackee & Saltfish with warm flatbread, rice pilaf, Brussel Sprouts, and for dessert: Plantains Foster   Can't wait to go again!!"}
