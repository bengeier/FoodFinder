{"text":"We went here on a Saturday night.  The restaurant was packed but the wait staff was very good at keeping us informed about status of getting a table,  Once seated it took quite a while for anyone to come by.  The food came quickly after we ordered.  That's where the good times sort of ended.  I've eaten here in the past, and the food was pretty good.  However, I think they're changed the phad thai recipe.  It used to yummy,  now it's just not good at all.  It was ketchupy and though there was lots of chicken, there were no vegetables, save for large pieces of green onion. Other people in our party had to doctor their food with hot sauce to make it palatable."}
{"text":"Clean nice restaurant! Good Thai food, not out of this world but really good. Priced fairly. My family and had had about 6 different main dishes to share and taste from and the very best was the mango salad and the boba tea. Very peaceful and the severs are all very kind"}
{"text":"Went there today for lunch. Realized soon that I made a bad choice. Ordered Spicy chicken with three chilly symbol on menu card to indicate its Thai spicy and the \"stuff\" served was terribly bland. Believe cook didn't realize that just aggregating raw materials and serving on plate is not why customers walk in for food.  Price was rip-off too. $16 or so. Would never try again. Won't recommend adventure here."}
{"text":"By far my favorite thai restaurant in the neighbourhood.  Food is always great!!  Best dishes: cashew nut chicken (not as spicy as you would think so I always request they make it spicier for me), basil chicken (if you love spicy food this is the dish you should try) and of course the pineapple fried rice.  But really pretty much everything on the menu is guaranteed to be delicious.  Another plus is that they now have delivery albeit with a minimum amount order.  I think it had to be at least $40 before they would deliver.  But the best has got to be when you call for pick-up - my order is always ready by the time i get there usually around 10mins.  Definitely give this place a try.  It will become your fave as well I'm sure."}
{"text":"Best thai place to go to in Toronto! The green mango salad is very tasty and flavorful, as well as their lemongrass chicken, calamari and spring rolls. The service is very quick and the ambience is very nice. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Meh. The food was not authentic thai food, I can tell you that. Over-priced and generally lacking flavour. Not a fan. Wouldn't recommend this."}
{"text":"I live in the area and have probably eaten here more than 40 times.  I eat here 3-4 times a month and so does my father and his gf. This place is just down the street from us and when we're hungry, want something close and reliable where we always know we will get a good meal, well Green Mango is our fail-safe staple.  Basically, this place is a great Thai-fusion type of place that I think would appeal to a wide variety of people.  The menu is fairly large and I've tried a whole lot of things and have never yet had a dud.  I tend to stick with some of the safer dishes but my father and his gf are much more experimental with food than myself, specifically my dad's gf who has travelled Asia, and they always ask for their dishes super spicy and they love it.  This restaurant is may not be the most creative/different/authentic Thai place in Toronto but if you are craving Thai/Asian fusion you won't go wrong here, especially in Etobicoke where options like this are limited.  It is always busy here, even on Sundays which is when we most often come for dinner.  There is a woman who I believe might be the manager who is also a waitress who is always SO friendly and greets us warmly every time we are there.  The waiters are almost all foreign and a few of the younger ones struggle with their English but are super friendly, and that's all that really matters to me in regards to service.  The vibe is casual and you don't have to be dressed up to come here.  As a side note, I have tried every single dessert and they are all awesome.  The creme brulee is a standout and they have some pretty unique icecream flavours.  I know this place will continue to be a staple that my family and I will frequent as long as we live in the area.  If you are passing by you won't be dissapointed here."}
{"text":"My family's favourite Thai restaurant. We are there 2 to 3 times a month or more & still crave for their food especially my 12 year son  Our fav dishes: Golden curry chicken xtra spicy with steam rice; spicy fish in coconut shrimp sauce served with mango salad to die for& for noodles:  pad wun sen with beef & curry pad thai.    Staff are amazing, they make sure you are taken cared & enquires if one family member is missing from the party.  This little personal touches makes all the difference plus incredible food"}
{"text":"Tried their Thai curry shrimp and mango fish. Curry shrimp was perfectly cooked with red Thai curry and coconut milk. Mango fish was sweet sour. Both was provided along with fair rice. Tasty food and cozy place. Definite worth a try."}
{"text":"If you're a curry lover, their curry is fantastic.  As for noodles, I like Pad See Ew. Highly recommended.  I am not a huge fan of the rice dishes except for curry honestly.  Great appetizers are the Beef satay, shrimp spring rolls.   At first i did not like this restaurant but I found the few dishes that I loved and Ive stuck to them and they are consistently good."}
{"text":"I've been working in this area for about 6 years now and I am a regular at this please as are many others. It's a friendly, family owned establishment. Their Pho is absolutely delicious. Their hot plate choices are also good but gets old after 6 years (of course it does!!!) but I still get it if I'm in a hurry."}
{"text":"A solid four star Thai spot. Coconut Soup and Golden Curry are full of flavour, and staff is on point. Can't go wrong with anything on the menu, good portions and prices are great!"}
{"text":"The restaurant has a decent price point and fairly extensive menu.   The atmosphere is something like an up-scale cafeteria, boasting fairly nice furnishings and decor, but little or no privacy / intimacy.  Not really the place for a date if that's what you're looking for.  The service was a bit slow and aloof, doing little other than take our order, deliver our food, and receive payment.  The food itself was pretty good, and came in large portions, leaving both my wife and I with a 2nd meal out of it.   The noodle dish I ordered was very delicious, however a little bit on the salty side and swimming in sauce; it probably would have gone well with a side of rice to thin it out.   My wife's rice dish was pretty good as well, with pretty generous portions of shrimp, but would have been great were it a little less oily.  All in all, if you're just looking for a decent portions, decent flavour,  and a competitively priced meal in Bloor West, then the Green Mango would probably fit the bill.   Just don't expect it to be anything other than that."}
{"text":"There's Three of Them!? I'm excited to find that out.  It's a fairly average Thai restaurant. The food is priced moderately and the food is pretty good (although I was daring one day and tried a dish I hadn't had before, and it did not end well).  so I'm gonna stick with what I know and everyone will be happy.  And I must agree with Steeven, they will refill your water about 17 times before your dinner's done."}
{"text":"Well, let's be honest with you guys : I live in High Park and this is the closest place where I can eat Pho without taking the subway or bus. About the service : what's wrong with thewaitress if I am going alone to the restaurant  : I just wanna have my bowl of Pho that's it !!!  No smiles, cold people, just saying \"hi\", \"what do you want\", \"thank you\".  Hohoho what a nice welcome :)  Thaï Express is better and cheaper ! NeXt !!!"}
{"text":"There are far better places in the area for Thai than Green Mango.  The second I saw the menu I knew that I was in for an interesting meal.  There was quite an array of asian food on the menu ranging from fried wontons to hot and sour soup that are clearly not Thai.  I managed to see Chinese, Vietnamese, and even Phillipino dishes (they even had Halo Halo as dessert!!) on their menu.  It was not what I was expecting.  We ordered street style pad thai and was not overly impressed.  The dishes were quite oily and there wasn't too much flavour for a Thai restaurant.  I've had much better Thai in the city and if anyone is looking for a more authentic thai place in the area, please check out Bua Thai on the Queensway.    I think the fact that the restaurant was busy and that it was a place that can seat large family gatherings that the people going there must be enjoying the food.  As an asian person myself, I found it was lacking Thai flavours and was overally too greasy."}
{"text":"I love this place! I have a group of friends, two who live in etobicoke, one who comes in from mississauga. So when we meet for dinner, this restaurant is in the perfect location to accommodate us all!  The menu has a huge variety and everything is delicious!! I normally get the veggie delight, but sometimes opt for the siam eggplant. My non-veg friends love the calamari appetizer. Tons of options for veg*ns, gluten-free, and those who eat everything! Serving sizes are very generous, the food is full of flavour, prices are good and you're not left with that uncomfy bloaty too full feeling that often follows thai food. The rice paper rolls used to be great but now have something pickled in them that I don't like...  The service is great - make sure you tell them if you're veg*n so that they hold the fish sauce.  Decor is nice and bathrooms are clean and lovely. You could bring mom and dad here, or a date, business associates or just some awesome friends you want to share great food with.  Their honey-sweetened ginger tea is a great way to cap off the meal.  Can't wait to go again!"}
{"text":"Wow, I'm surprised there's not many reviews on this place.  I started eating at Green Mango when it was just the one fast food joint across the street.  It's a great place for inexpensive bulk Thai food; it's by far not authentic but it's still pretty good.  I love basil chicken with pad thai.  I won't give this place anything below 4 stars, since it got me through uni.  It was two meals for $8, amazing for a student who couldn't cook if her life depended on it!"}
{"text":"Worst Thai ever. Services me right for going to a Thai restaurant that said \"Good Pho\".  I wasn't expecting authentic Thai food but this was unacceptable goo. Gave one star because the staff was attentive."}
{"text":"I phoned in at 9:10 for a take out order told them I would be there in 30 min got there at exactly 9:41 and they had closed.  The food is actually good but after wasting an hour of my life driving there and returning home with nothing I think it's safe to say I won't be returning.  Why would you not just call back and say sorry we can't take your order were going to close."}
{"text":"Definitely see how a Neighbourhood cab change the prices of the EXACT SAME FOOD as downtown on Yonge St avec higher prices. Is that because it's \"Bloir West\"? It really IS The exact same chicken. Interesting. Nice environment but not worth the seemingly extra prices."}
{"text":"Although I really like their food, their prices have gone up incredibly in the last few months -  so much, that we have stopped ordering from here which is truly unfortunate.  The last time I called, one the dishes had gone up another $2 from the fairly recent menu that I had a home.  So, Green Mango - good luck and hope that others can afford more than I can.  Time to find an alternate thai restaurant in Etobicoke."}
{"text":"I'm going to give this one a \"so-so\".     I LOVE Thai food, and I'm always in search of local options, since my go-to is Thai House Cuisine in the Beaches, and that's too far for a quick fix.  Does anyone remember the old fast food version of Green Mango that was on the East side of Yonge near Bloor?  Not the sit-down one on the West side... that one was okay.  But the GOOD one was the take-out location on the East side.  They had the best ginger chicken, peanut chicken, mango shakes...    So last night I decided to give the Kingsway location of Green Mango a try.  It was alright.  But it doesn't even compare to the Green Mango of yore.  Based on the menu description, I knew that the ginger chicken was not as I remembered it, so I didn't even venture there.  I stuck with cashew chicken, vegetable spring rolls, a hot & sour soup for my hubby, and a mango shake.  The Cashew Chicken was pretty standard, and was tasty.  I enjoyed it.  Didn't love the little segments of canned mandarins (I think if you're going to put orange in the dish, use fresh oranges).  The chicken was generally pretty fat-free, which is important to me.  Overall, decent dish.  The hot & sour soup was well received by my hubby, though I would probably not love all the mushrooms in it if I had ordered it.  The springrolls - at first I thought they'd accidentally given me chicken springrolls, but then I realized that it was long strips of tofu.   They tasted good, if a little breadier than I generally like, and could have handled a bit more filling.  But we polished them off no problem.  The mango shake was pretty well how I remember it from Yonge, so that was a bonus.  Overall, the meal was okay, but no wow factor.  I can't speak to the ambiance, as I picked the meal up for take-away.  The restaurant felt pretty clean though, and the staff were friendly during the pick-up."}
{"text":"The prices were very high for low-quality food in small portions. Pho was ok, broth was pretty tasty, but not much chicken, noodles or toppings with it. The green mango salad just sour with little flavour and was double the price I would normally pay!"}
{"text":"Green Mango is a Thai restaurant with a sleek and modern decor. The food quality and service are very good without a doubt. The only reason i am not coming back here are the portion sizes .... if you're an average eater you'll leave this restaurant hungry unless you had plenty of appetizers ..."}
{"text":"Excellent decor and service for Bloor West Village. Friendly and focused waiters. I have been eating here since they opened and I have always enjoyed it. Well priced entrees, and wines. Small patio in the front, large zen style dining room.  Some dishes in my humble opinion are better than others. The shrimp satay appetizers with mango or cucumber salad are superb."}
{"text":"First the positive: Very quick delivery, literally 15-20 from the phone call.  Otherwise: Practically inedible food.  Fried rice wasn't fried and had barely cooked shrimp.  Tamarind veggie dish tasted horrible, like vinegar.  Mango fresh roll and veggie spring roll were ok, at least fresh.  But the sauce wasn't great.  The coconut chicken mushroom soup was watery with not much flavor.   Perhaps other things on the menu are better, but we will never eat here again!!"}
{"text":"This is a big disappointment. Would have preferred to keep my money in my pocket.  My wife and I compared the Green Mango to airport food. Service is mediocre, the place had no ambiance (bright lights) and the food is inauthentic and bland. The place is a little run down too."}
{"text":"Awesome Pad Thai, & the Won ton soup is fantastic. Takeout is super fast."}
{"text":"I've eaten here three times. Once for lunch, once for dinner and once a friend brought me over some takeout. All food experiences were similar. Nothing special... The portions are good for me - I eat very little. But for anyone with a healthier appetite will probably go home and have a box of KD. The service was fine, the servers could probably use a bit more training on being more polite. I agree with Jenny T's comments on the service.  Here is why I will probably never go back to Green Mango.  Recently, I called in to order 5 orders of Pad Thai and 4 orders of Basil Fried Rice for a party. The order was calculated and a bit higher than my calculations according to the prices posted on the web. The girl notified me that all the prices went up by a dollar. I insisted on getting the prices stated on the website - which is reasonable, right? She put me on \"hold\" and rudely explained the case to a manager. (Note: if you're going to speak rudely about a customer - ensure you've properly put your hand over the receiver). The manager came on and (again, rudely) refused to give me the web price... so I cancelled my order and made an order at Simply Thai... which was delicious."}
{"text":"Perhaps the BEST Pad See Yew in Toronto, I was shocked how fantastic it was!... as was the two soups I've had (H&S and Lemongrass, didn't expect anything decent, twas very good), and service is always prompt, quick, and very friendly... this is now my go to Thai spot since moving into the 'hood."}
{"text":"Welcome the middle of the road! This Thai place - whose menu appears to be increasingly Pan-Asian - is the culinary Mr. Average, A \"C\" student.  Not too great, not too bad - Neither is it \"Just right\"  They've got a large and varied menu - most of what you'd want to find.  .  The salads make up in freshness what they lack in authenticity - they are my \"go-to\" here.  The soups are pretty much a universal pass for me - all available better elsewhere.  The fresh rolls are a similar miss.  The basil chicken is quite good, enough fresh basil to be legit although I'd like their to be a bit more bite.  The shrimp dishes are reasonably flavoured although not as generous in the prawnage as one might hope. The red snapper - well let's just say that I'm pretty dubious that what I was served was snapper...  Can you do better in the GTA? Hell yes, and for less money!  Can you do better in the immediate neighborhood? No, and that is why they are a popular longstanding fave in this hood."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere.  The price is little above from average.  Whenever I come to this place, I always get  Basil squid which is so tasty.  I recommend it.  Good service and friendly servers.  Have to be back soon."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant and have since it was a hole-in-the-wall on the east side of Yonge Street in the 90's. Great food, great prices, fast service. I dream of their pad thai, it's one of my favourites. Curry dishes are delicious, spring rolls are nearly perfect. Glass noodles are one of my favourites here. I don't think I have ever tried a dish I did not love. They also provide excellent catering for office lunches or parties and the amount of food they send is HUGE and very generous. I've ordered for 10-12 people and had so much leftover that the entire office had lunch again the next day, plus a few take home containers. The only challenge for picking up take-out is parking on Yonge Street. If you are picking up, take 2 people so 1 can drive and circle the block if need be while the other goes in and pays. Helpful staff will gladly assist you in loading your vehicle full of catering orders.   I hope Green Mango has a long life on Yonge Street! It is FAR SUPERIOR to Salad King, for sure (for those who might be wondering)."}
{"text":"I was here to grab a coffee with my friend. He usually has breakfast here alot as it is very reasonably priced.   The service was great. They didn't have coffee and they made it again for us, the coffee was decent!"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch with an old friend in hopes that it would be a better place than the food court in the building which I work at.  WRONG.  My friend is not Asian nor does she eat Asian food often.  This should mean a little more attention to helping the patron order.  When my friend asked the server if she could substitute the salad in her lunch special for another type (lower cost one), the server rudely replied \"no substitute allowed\".  I have worked in customer service and I honestly think that you can get the same point across by stating \"Sorry, but we do not substitute with the lunch combos.  Might I interest you in our combo ___ which is similar to...\"  During our meal, our glasses (never once emptied) were refilled about 3 times.  The server did not excuse herself when she leant over to pour into the glasses.  After we finished our meals, we sat to chat.  Mind you the restaurant was only 30-40% full.  I had my back to where the servers situated themselves.  After about 10 minutes, my friend suggested we leave since we were no longer welcome.  She whispered that she was getting dirty looks from the server.  Too bad I had already paid and tipped the usual amount for good service."}
{"text":"I love Thai food and this place was a total disappointment and a very poor dining experience.   First my husband's entree came cold and my order first got mixed up so I sent it back. It then came back lacking main ingredients (i.e no chicken in my chicken salad) and then by the time they finally got it right my husband was long finished and my dish was terrible to the point of being inedible.  The service was cold, borderline rude and after such bad service and bad food on top if it, it took 20 minutes for them to bring us our check which tempted us sorely to just walk out. Do not recommend."}
{"text":"Really?  No one has written a review of this place?  How can that be...  For some reason, in this particular area, many of the businesses located at the South East corner of small intersections share the identical floor plans.  Green Mango looks exactly like the sushi restaurant one mini block down, and so on.  The décor of this place was designed to go unnoticed, as it is plain and completely dull.  But the lack of effort somehow facilitates the congestion of this place during the daytime.  It is ridiculously busy on weekdays during lunchtime, there's usually a line which forms with people waiting to get their takeaway box.    I stupidly agreed to allow a former co-worker pick the place for lunch, and of course his pretentious liberal hippy ass dragged me here.  I don't eat Thai food for two reasons: 1. The portions at any restaurant is appetizer amount to me. 2. I refuse to believe that this is what Thai people really eat. The Thai people fight each other with one of the most violent martial arts in existence, and they entertain themselves with cobra fighting...do you expect me to accept that their diet consist of bite size spring rolls and carrot shavings?   Thailand is a watery place, when was the last time you had fish in a Thai restaurant?  Yeah...I don't buy it, this is some chicken ball conspiracy against the Thai right here.    I got the green curry chicken crap with spring rolls on rice I think, co-worker got something he considered to be more 'authentic'.  As soon as I began eating it was over, 9 dollars for a few bites, and the flavours were bland.  Also, we had to eat in our cars because there was no way in Hell were we getting a seat.    Moral of the story:  Don't let liberals choose a restaurant for you. Seriously, if our meal came with a yoga session..I bet he wouldn't have hesitate for a second."}
{"text":"Man, I so wanted to like this place. Again, when you walk into a restaurant and you are the only customer, I really should turn around.   This is my 4th visit here each time thinking  it was a fluke.   Today's order was chicken satay. Chicken was rubbery. Peanut sauce was right out of fridge and cold.   Also ordered spicy egg noodles with gingered duck. Noodles were not by any stretch of the imagination spicy. Duck was really fatty and full of cartilidge. More pieces of skin than duck.   Ate about 1/4. What a waste.   Voting with my dollars. Will not return."}
{"text":"Never, EVER, again. I made the mistake of ordering food from here once and nothing was good. Weird metallic tasting shrimp pad thai, soggy flavourless spring rolls, and dry tough satay chicken. I made them drive to my house to give me a refund. Shame on you for making such terrible food. Bleck!"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I come here fairly regularly for dinner. We always eat-in so I can't comment on their delivery. We find the food to be delicious and the atmosphere to be pleasant. Our go-tos are the veggie fresh rolls, chicken satay, veggie curry pad Thai, and garlic pork. We have brought friends and family here on occasion and they have always raved as well. We will continue to return here again and again."}
{"text":"Had been wanting to try this place for the three+ years that I've lived in this area...but my partner is hesitant of Thai food and we're usually together when walking the Bloor West Village area.  Today I was off work so decided to try it alone.  Atmosphere:  They call it \"fine\" Thai, and it's definitely decent, but not my definition of \"fine dining\" exactly.  Casual, but nicely decorated atmosphere.  Unique wall decor when you stop and look at it, just feels very standard overall.  Service:  Greeted immediately upon walking in the door at noon by the sole server working.  I'd say there were 15-20 tables in the place and six or seven were occupied.  He poured my water and provided menu immediately.  Prompt and simple as could be - the way I prefer my service.  Menu:  Huge selection of everything including desserts.  Licensed. My veggie spring rolls were brought practically instantly.  I assume they were already cooked for the lunch crowd.  Three instead of the usual two included for the $4.95 price.  Standard but delicious with their dip.  If you are a very light eater, this could actually satisfy for a light lunch in itself.    Good veggie Pad Kee Mao.  I was craving a typical 'thai basil noodle' type dish when I arrived.  They offered a chicken one but not a veggie one.  This is as close as it can get.  Pretty large portion where I couldn't finish so took a doggie bag.  Medium spicy was just right.  Lots of vegetables, and for a carb lover like me, that's actually not the best thing (esp the big pieces of bok choy which are famous in most Thai dishes), but I was definitely satisfied.   Although my experience was somewhat limited in time and what I tried, I'd definitely go back and try something else...preferably at night to get a different feel."}
{"text":"I'm going with A-OK for my first visit to Green Mango. I showed up during off hours (3pm on a Saturday) and was initially lured in by the neon sign saying \"Good Pho\". That worked for me, it was cold and damp outside and I wanted that oh familiar warmth in my belly STAT.  Then as I sat in the very nicely put together restaurant reviewing the menu and the yelp reviews concurrently I decided that $10 for noodle soup wasn't worth it unless it was a massive bowl. I went with my go to Thai meal in the end - Street style pad thai.   They had several options, for this dish including chicken, beef, shrimp or a mix of any of the three. I went with a shrimp and beef mix. I also asked for them to make it thai spicy.   Result: a fair mild tasting pad thai, with only 2 shrimp and some some beef. They provided extra spice on the side to help kick it up a few notches but it didn't make a difference. Maybe it's my taste buds but it wasn't spicy.   Overall it was tasty just not the best I've had. But still good.   Eatcrest Out!"}
{"text":"I have been gong to this location literally for over 5 years and still am a die-hard fan. I went here on the weekend for dinner with the family and still loved every last bit of it. As usual we ordered 2 calamaris for an app and I got the usual fresh iced tea and shrimp Pad Woon Sen (as I had been craving it)  lol. Great place with very friendly staff and always worth your money. I will be back again and again!!"}
{"text":"Classic Thai restaurant ! Family run for years The food is always good & made fresh. Prices are great ."}
{"text":"my favorites are the lemongrass soup, the coconut curry soup, Chicken Satay, Coconut curry, and peanut chicken.  Service is always friendly.  Dining room is small and cramped is my only complaint.  Love going in on a cold snowy day and sipping hot soup while I watch it snow. great memories here."}
{"text":"Green Mango has been around for about 20 years in Toronto and now has three locations: The Kingsway, Bloor West Village and Yonge and Bloor. This review is about the Kingsway location (Bloor & Royal York).  Green Mango specializes in Thai cusine and has a wide variety of choices from noodles and Pad Thai, to curries and a myriad of beef, pork, chicken, seafood and vegetarian dishes.   The ambiance at this Green Mango location is one of the best of all three. The service is usually quick and efficient. Your glass of water will get refiled before you even realize it's empty. It's great for a quick lunch or a nice dinner that won't break the bank. Most entrees are around $10; however, this location recently upped the price of everything on the menu by a dollar or two.   For appetizers, their Thai spring rolls and beef satay are delicious! As mentioned, there are a lot of entree choices on the menu but I personally love their pork and beef curries. The portions are generous and the presentation is very nice. If you're a spicy lover, I highly recommend the basil beef, which is served with vegetables and rice in spicy sauce mix.  Finally for desert, try the sticky coconut rice with mango. Great presentation and deliciously sweet."}
{"text":"I'm sad to write this because normally I love ordering from this place. My family and I usually order this once a week. Today, they provided us with the wrong order (one of the dishes was incorrect). I was able to verify this when I got home. I called to complain and was told that this would only be fixed once I brought the incorrect dish back to them. 1) You made the mistake -  and a good restaurant would correct their mistake 2) When I mentioned that this wasn't right (and also illegal), the manager said \"I can do whatever I want with our food\". The fact that they take back potentially contaminated food (we didn't touch it but I easily could have taken a bite not knowing what it was) and then serving it to other people is DISGUSTING. Eat at your own discretion."}
{"text":"I think the chef has changed.  I ordered take out this week and normally can't wait to have leftovers.  But the satay skewers were tough.  The chicken in the pineapple chicken curry tasted like two day old chicken (or ...).  The basil beef had so many carrots as filler...usually its filled with green peppers, onion and basil.  I'm sorry to say no one has fought over the leftovers and I'm going to bin them.  It's sad because I've been craving this for months.  Won't go back."}
{"text":"I had the street style pad-Thai and mango shake, both were super great with fresh flavours"}
{"text":"I have been to Green Mango twice now, and both times the food was solid. I have to say, their interpretation of some dishes is a bit different from other thai restaurants that I have been to, but not necessarily in a bad way. At most places, curry pad thai is done in a golden curry, but here it tasted more like a red curry. Also at most places, thai iced tea comes with milk and has a certain strong taste to it (matcha perhaps?) that does not make it taste like traditional iced tea, but at this place theirs comes with lemon and looks and tastes like classic homemade iced tea. Again, not a complaint per say, just an observation.   I quite enjoyed their panang curry, one of the best I've had. I used to eat the delicious yet hard to find dish Kai Yad Sai (meat and veggies in a tasty sauce cooked inside a thin omelette) wherever I was lucky enough to find it on the menu, and here they have \"crepe\" dishes that sound similar so I have been tempted to order it, but I am thinking now it will probably taste nothing like it... (Although it may still be good!). So they definitely have tasty, albeit not always traditional, thai food, and the service has been decent and the decor is pretty swanky."}
{"text":"Calamari. Chicken Pad Thai, Rice & Peanut Sauce and Cashew Chicken = best things on the menu HANDS DOWN.  Love this place and everything is more than reasonably priced. Never SUPER busy and the service is always great."}
{"text":"Best Pad Thai In Etobicoke hands down. Very busy during lunch hours, but the service is fast. They do take out which is a plus if you want to avoid the crowd."}
{"text":"Green Mango is the Thai takeout of choice when I visit my sister in Toronto. Despite consistently forgetting one of our dishes every time, I have been very happy with the food.  Firstly, they have Pad Woon Sen, my girlfriend's favourite dish, which makes her SO happy. I always get myself a sample of that, plus some other things around their dinner table: Shrimp Pad Thai, Peanut Chicken, Beef... something..., Chicken Satay, Sticky Rice, and an abundance of peanut sauce to drizzle on everything.  The food is good! Nothing to complain about! It's a great bonding food with family."}
{"text":"The Curry Pad Thai here is amazing! However the lady taking my order probably wasn't having the best day. Can't wait to have it again!"}
{"text":"Delicious and flavorful Pho...really enjoyed the #15! Plenty of seafood and the regular size was large!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch, we had a reservation but it was surprisingly quiet at 1pm. Very good for small groups but I wouldn't recommend it for bigger groups as noise seemed to travel far and we didn't want to be the only voices heard in the whole place! The peanut sauce for their satay is delicious! We had that as an appetizer and then I had the seafood pad see ew which was very good but could have been made better if it was topped with crushed peanuts and had the option of hot sauce. My mom had the peanut chicken which is always her favourite. Their prices are really reasonable. You an find some pricier items but there's a lot of items under $15, and even a $10 lunch menu."}
{"text":"I'm giving this restaurant a 2-Star as I was highly disappointed with the service, not necessarily the food.  It would have gained one more star if the service wasn't so poor, but I think the poor service is attributed to one server, one experience.  I've been here twice in the restaurant, and stepped foot in it once and quickly turned around - more on that later.  I found that the small plates were more tasty that their large ones.  We've had their coconut soup, lemongrass soup, coconut sticky rice, green mango salad.  Their pineapple fried rice, and I can't remember which curry dishes the manfriend had, were mediocre.  Both times, the males servers we had were very polite and soft-spoken, and we never had any issues with the service.  Until one day, I decided I wanted a Vietnamese iced coffee in the afternoon.  I walked in and was approached by a female worker who asked what I wanted.  i let her know i would like a Vietnamese Iced Coffee.  \"This is a Thai restaurant, not a Vietnamese restaurant.  Go down the street for coffee.\"  WOW.  EXCUSE ME?  First of all, they have a neon sign that says \"Pho\" on it...that's not Thai!  Is it so wrong to have assumed that they might serve the coffee?  Secondly, you have Thai Iced Coffee and Thai Iced Tea - was it so hard to offer either  one of those wonderful alternatives?    I was actually quite offended, especially because they were not very busy, which would have been more understandable.  And the fact she told me to go down the street made me think she was not just having a bad day, she is driving business away.  Due to the service, I will make the conscious decision not to come back."}
{"text":"This is one of those instances where I wish I'd checked yelp before stopping in for lunch.  It's quarter to one on a Monday afternoon. The place looks nice and quiet with only one other couple inside, so we thought it would be a perfect place to stop by for a quick bite before heading on a walk. The boy ordered the golden chicken curry and I ordered the impressive sounding Dark Prince Salad, as well as a lemon iced tea.  Then we waited. For awhile. About 4 more tables of pairs showed up and everybody got appetizers while we continued waiting. 25 minutes later, we got our meal. Disappointing at that. The Dark Prince Salad was described as this \"Roasted duck mixed with lychees, onions, coriander, ginger and roasted peanuts. Seasoned with lychee ginger and duck jus vinaigrette\"  BUT, what I got was extremely bland, the chili flakes were either fake or anything but chili with nothing but a sour, tangy sauce that really let the duck down and actually made it completely fall flat. There were more red onions in the salad than anything, including greens, it was actually surprisingly small for a main dish that cost $11.   The golden chicken curry was fine, a little runny and soupy. not thick, but simple and decent enough, if it cost less that is. Definitely not enough to ever go again.  Service was also as minimal as could be, nobody checked on us as we sat waiting for our meal and nobody checked after we got our meal if we were good. The second we stopped eating somebody swooped in to grab the plates but did so in a way that felt more like he wanted to get us the heck out of there rather than empty the table for our convenience.  Also? Wicked stomach cramps about an hour later. Just saying. Avoid. Thai Express is 100x better and more fairly priced than these guys. Never thought I'd recommend a fast food chain in a review before, but, that's how it rolls."}
{"text":"Always good food, fresh, taste as expected  Price is fair  Always share so you can get variety  Been to many thai places and still love this one more"}
{"text":"I would've given this place 5 stars based on my last dine-in experience because the peanut chicken was amazing but I recently ordered it for take-out and it was HORRIBLE. It seems they just threw everything together knowing that by the time I was out the door then it was my problem not theirs. The take-out portion was noticeably smaller than what I would have received had I dined in. The taste was also not as good which is unfortunate. I will probably come back but never take-out again."}
{"text":"Great food and nice people. I loved the appetizers.  Pineapple fried rice and their pad tie is a must.  Even on a busy day like today they still made sure we were taken care of."}
{"text":"So disappointed, I used to go to the one downtown on Young Street years ago.The food there was amazing they had spicy noodles and the option of what type of protein. I visited this location last Thursday March 29 and Ordered the morning mixed(chicken and shrimp) pad Thai there were two and I repeat two pieces of shrimp when I asked about the lack of shrimp in my order the waiter informed me it only came with two pieces of shrimp. The pad Thai was flavourless to the point where I'm 100% sure I will not be going back there. It's really unfortunate because I really enjoyed the green mango from downtown."}
{"text":"Came here on  Sunday afternoon. Had mixed curry pad Thai. It was rich and filled with chicken and fresh shrimp. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Great place to bring your family, boyfriend, whatever.. You know the food will be great and worth every dollar.   LOVE LOVE LOVE   Hot & Sour Soup: Probably the best flavour and aesthetically pleasing all the same.  (even though I don't like mushrooms) It's amazing and I order this every time =)  Spicy Noodle with Basil : I ALWAYS get this when I go there and the waiters are courteous and fast with delivering dishes and especially amazing when it comes to giving me hot sauce and crushed peppers as I will put both in that one dish."}
{"text":"i have eaten here at least three dozen times since i moved to bwv.  food is consistent.  i'd even say \"good\" (my high school english teacher always said, \"'good' is a dead word.  it means nothing.\")   my relationship with green mango is over now.  i phoned @ 9:34pm for delivery.  they close at ten. girl on phone said delivery closes at 9:30.  (so, 4 minutes ago.)  \"really?\", i say, \"could you make an exception since it's 9:34?\".  actually, she informs me, her driver left at 9 because they don't deliver past 9.  (is it 9 or 9:30?)  i tell her the website says open til 10.  she says she's not responsible for the content on their website and do i want to pick up now since she's closing in 18 minutes (with those math skills she'll be here forever).  i hang up on her and call their competitor 1 block east.  $50 later and food is room temp, mediocre, bland and f'ing delicious because it tastes like sweet revenge (i voted with my pocketbook--hit 'em where it hurts).  if in the past 2 years i've eaten at green mango 3 dozen times, that's $1,800 dollars i won't give them in the next two years.  hope the owner realizes the dollar value of the (non-existent) customer service given by her teenage brat employee."}
{"text":"I was very unfortunate with my first experience at this restaurant. I went today for lunch for the first time and chose number 3 from the lunch menu. It was like the \"leftovers from the last weekend \". I didn't want to write a negative review. However, half an hour after leaving the restaurant I had to rush to a washroom and felt awful. It was really a bad food and very inconsiderate of them. I hope others have a better experience. I didn't."}
{"text":"Meh. For some reason the Green Mango in The Kingsway Village is way better. Still greasy, and overpriced. Simply Thai is a better choice."}
{"text":"I've always been a big fan of this place for a quick, inexpensive thai meal.  My last visit was great from a food stand-point, but the service was so terrible that it has soured my opinion on the restaurant as a whole.  Our negative experience culminated with our waiter bringing our cheque 30 minutes after we were finished eating, and then shrugging when we said that we had wanted to order dessert. Brutal. I'll try to remain objective for the purpose of reviewing the food.  My top pick: Golden Chicken Curry. Chicken, peppers, bamboo and a crazy delicious yellow coconut curry sauce. I could eat (read: have eaten)  an entire order by myself. Great spring rolls and pad thai, too. I also enjoyed the cashew chicken and the fresh spring rolls.  Check it out for the $9 lunch specials (get the golden chicken!!)"}
{"text":"I live for this restaurant. It is my favourite place to eat. The food is great and the price is affordable. The portions are really good.  I particularly love their curry pumpkin soup, pineapple fried rice, lamb satay and pad thai.   The atmosphere is cozy and welcoming. The servers are very kind. It's a great place to bring your family. It's a very minimalist layout, but it suits the place perfectly. I highly recommend this restaurant. Try it - you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This is only the 2nd time I've posted a negative comment ever so that should tell you something right there.  Ordered Pad Thai with chicken Coconut soup with Pineapple and mango salad for take out.  Ate the Pad Thai for lunch. Good. Average. Lots of chicken but nothing special. Some of the noodles were all clumped/glued together. Not sure why.  Waited to have the mango salad and soup for dinner.  Mango salad. WTF? There was something seriously wrong with this. I have NEVER EVER had mango salad like this before.  It tasted at least 2 weeks old and some of the mangos were BAD. Like brown bad! Plus, something (or two somethings) was very sour. Like prickle your tongue bad OJ sour. The 'dressing' appeared to be orange juice-like in nature (?) and there was about 2/3 of a cup of it in the container. I couldn't tell if it was just the mangos or the drsg or both, but whatever it was after 2 bites I threw the whole thing out. That says a lot about how bad it was. I don't usually complain about my food but this was one of the rare exceptions. This was so disappointing because mango salad is one of my favourite things and I was really looking forward to enjoying it. But no!  This made me very leery about the coconut soup. But I proceeded anyway. I ordered it with pineapple because I love pineapple and I've never had it that way before and thought I'd try it as i usually just have it with chicken. Given the state of the mangos, I was relieved to see that they used canned pineapple chunks in the soup and not fresh. I thought this would at least decrease the risk of them being bad. The soup was just ok. Not much chicken (if any) in it. The pineapple was less than exciting but I would not order this again. There was nothing really wrong with it other than the lack of chicken but it just didn't work for me. Another disappointment.  Finally, menu prices and what I was actually charged were different. Online menu: http://www.greenmango.ca/assets/green-mango-bloor-menu-2014.pdf  Pad Thai: price $11.95 (charged: $12.95) Coconut Soup with chicken + pineapple: price: $6.95 Mango salad: price $7.95 (charged: $8.95) - way too expensive IMO! I have a real problem with actual prices being different than posted prices. That's just intentional deceit and intolerable business practices as far as I'm concerned.  So would I recommend this place: No!  Would I go back: No!  Reason: If a restaurant doesn't take the time to check the quality of their ingredients or worse, doesn't care, then I am not inclined to go back. There are no do-overs in the food industry. There are lots of businesses competing for my money - why not do it right the first time? Secondly, if I can't trust the quality of the food or accurate pricing on the menu, I'm done.  Also, drove by the restaurant twice because the signage was so poor on the outside. Looked for trademark green logo/design but it was actually some weathered old paintless wood (nothing green) and when I finally saw it, thought it had been derelict and shut down. So that wasn't good either.  Only about 4 people in the restaurant during lunch. Methinks that won't last long.  SO NO! I WILL DEFINITELY NOT GO BACK AND I HOPE YOU WON'T GO EITHER!"}
{"text":"Always a good bet to come here.   Food is very good, and the desserts are even better.   The place itself is nice and clean. I recommend it if you are in the area"}
{"text":"Chicken spring rolls were pretty damn good. They had a nice flavour and were super hot and crispy.   I had the basil chicken and I had asked for it spicy but it wasn't hot or flavourful enough for me. Mine was just too saucy, maybe some people really like it like that but my friend had the basil beef and hers wasn't as gooey.  It was too expensive for mediocre food."}
{"text":"Delicios pho. I got a small bowl and it was pretty big. It was my first time having pho.. so to me it was delicious and not over empowering broth.   They have so much on the menu... They have breakfast in the morning.. Bubble teas for snacks..and luncb and dinner.  I didnt see the hot foods out but im guessing they have good promotions for lunch.. I saw chicken balls and rice..and other \"chinese\" theme... they have soo much on the menu.. i would say it isnt a full vietnamese.. they have canadian looking breakfast.. chinese lunch..abd your choice of thai or vietnamese entrees for dinner. Price is good.. roughly $25 for a couple and one soda drink...  I enjoywd it and will be coming back to try more stuff on the menu. thwy have so much variety and the service was great. very friendly."}
{"text":"I come here fairly regularly, it is my go- to Thai resto in the area. My favourites are the Pineapple Fried Rice and the Red Curry Tofu. The last 3 times I've come, the quality has really deteriorated which is so disappointing. Yesterday, my Red Curry was not warm so I sent it back to re-heat. But even so, when it came back, all the vegetables were on the hard side as they were undercooked. As for the Pineapple Fried Rice, the last time the pineapple was not even in it and they have for awhile now started skimping on the vegetables that are in it and have switched to tiny cashew nuts instead of the tastier bigger ones they used to use. I really hope you get back on track, Green Mango. I want to keep coming back but not to this. WE REGULAR CUSTOMERS DO NOTICE. You've fallen into the trap of many restaurants that start sacrificing quality at some point.  On the plus side, the staff are wonderful - friendly and efficient, EXCEPT for the one guy with glasses who is a real sour puss and bangs down the plates and glasses, doesn't smile and sloppily pours water and tosses the napkins down.   Please get back on track Green Mango!!!"}
{"text":"Best pho that I have tried so far, I would say it's more authentic than pho Linh or pho Tien Thanh or Golden Turtle in downtown Toronto. Portion was decent, cheap price as compared to other pho stores. Their rice dishes are pretty good tho, love the grilled chicken on rice. There are lots of choices for hot tables and all tasted very well, not oily at all. I also love the fish sauce here, they have the most flavourful fish sauce that I have ever tried. I have been to many Vietnamese restaurant but their fish sauce are tasteless sometimes bland. As a Vietnamese, I would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Worse Pho place I've been to.  1. Soup base taste instant 2. Small portioning  3.water or tea was not served   Don't come here"}
{"text":"Walking in, you'll notice no shakers of sugar, peppers, or peanuts.  This is not a good sign for a Thai Restaurant.  It's dangerous to go alone - it's best to order two dishes, just to make sure you have some sort of flavours to switch back and forth with.  While, not terrible, the food is bland, and without any sort of flair.  If you just want noodles, then you will be alright - but if you want Thai Food, you're best to stay away.  There's nothing for you here.  And at the prices they're asking?  It's ridiculous."}
{"text":"Good food, but a bit pricey. You kind of pay for the modernish look. I ordered a pumpkin soup and a shrimp dish. I don't think the size of the plates were too small, served the two of us perfectly. But I really think that almost $15 for a shrimp plate is a bit high.   I don't think they serve as good as their prices think - I was best served in a lower-priced spadina thai restaurant - and they even charge you for the tea you drink.   I don't think Green Mango is a very good deal. Maybe for a romantic occasion, or business."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner by myself and I order the mango chicken and it was exactly what I expected (which is never much these days).  Good enough but nothing special.  It was plenty of food for me...I couldn't finish it all.  The service was very friendly and quick, though I didn't ask anything special of them.  Overall it was a pretty average experience at a nice looking but average taste and quality thai restaurant.  I would come here again if in the area and after having tried all the other places in the area."}
{"text":"I really liked this place. The layout and decor was nice and minimalistic, and not crowded. I came here for dinner and ordered the Chicken Asparagus stir fry. It comes also with mushrooms, peppers, and onions and you get a generous portion of it with rice. There was enough for two meals! The chicken was nice and good quality, and they give you a lot of it. I tasted the Chicken Pad Thai and it was delicious too! It was so good, that my Dad almost finished the whole massive portion!  The prices are decent for the amount you get, and the flavours are wonderful. Service was attentive and friendly. I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I did check the reviews and had a very disappointing experience with the food.   Most of the reviews are not recent which says something.  So the ONLY reason I went here is because I was near the Royal York subway, it was -20C and I was craving soup.  I ordered their mango salad and their lemongrass soup with seafood. They were both bad. I could make better salad and soup at home! Heck even the frozen stuff or canned stuff at a grocery store would taste better. I know this used to be a very popular chain but seems like this is the last holdout. Everytime I pass by it is not crowded. Even on a Fri or Sat night. So that means something."}
{"text":"The pho there is usually pretty good. Cold rolls are exceptional, super fast & friendly service."}
{"text":"Lemongrass fried rice! This is my ultimate favorite here. It's so fragrant and flavorful, whether it's shrimp, beef or chicken. I've tried the basil beef and spicy noodles with basil which were all right. I'm not a fan of the ginger chicken-- I found it watery and lacking in flavor. The twin sister crab cakes were so-so and a bit over-priced. I love the mango and sticky rice! I'll be coming back to try more of their food, including all those lovely sounding desserts!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has been a long time favourite of mine. I will often try to visit whenever I am in town. Excellent food and atmosphere."}
{"text":"I have been living in vaughan for quite some time now and drive by this place to get to work. My co worker and i wanted to try it out so we did. As we got seated and going through the menu the waitress came and took our order. My co worker and i both ordered large but when it came to our table they look like a small from other pho shops, the taste was moderate. As we finished we notice that there was no tea served D: so i wouldnt be returning."}
{"text":"Stopped by earlier after running some errands to get take-out since I was too lazy to cook.  The decor is nice enough - comfortable I'd say. And it's more of a low-key, mellow neighbourhood spot. It doesn't have the buzz of a Pai or a Gusto 101 but I don't always want that.  I ordered the basil chicken (medium spicy) and it was good. It was a generous sized portion and had just enough kick. I would recommend it."}
