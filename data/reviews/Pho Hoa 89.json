{"text":"Dont be fooled by the 2 previous reviews on here!  They are staged and professionally written with tonnes of pictures added.  Who actually puts so much time into reviews like this??? Its common sense they are fake!

I was a regular client at My Pho and although the food wasnt the greatest, the price was right and the service was quick!  I was curious to see what changes the new management brought so I walked in the other day.  The hostess who also appeared to be the owner saw me from far and said pick any table I want so I did. I am now seated waiting for some tea and menu to be brought to me as usual protocol.  Several minutes went by and still nothing.  The restaurant was dead so there was no excuses. The hostess served a customer and then sat on a table afterward to work on her advertizement for her new restaurant with the chef.  It was as if I did not even exist.  That was when I got up immediately and walked out to go eat at Nana Sushi accross the plaza where I was promptly greeted with a warm cup of tea and a menu.  I would never go back here, there are many other options for pho nearby!"}
{"text":"A very local pho restaurant from a friend's workplace that we decided to try out. Nothing to complain about. Service was great, well greeted, and the menu was simple. 

Place is very clean, there are definitely slow hours which I think we arrived there at.

I had the usual pho special that is topped with everything. First thing I judge is the soup, and it was fantastic. The flavour is definitely there, and they were super generous on the beef.

Would recommend if you're a local in the area, craving for quick pho."}
{"text":"What can I say, it's your average pho restaurant. Just like any other. 

Don't get me wrong, it was good! BUT it doesn't stand out from the rest. However staff there are much friendlier than most places and very attentive to your needs! Waiting time is reasonable and place is quite clean. 

The broth is pretty tasty but again, just like any other. I went with my family so we each got something different and got a few appetizers to share. My favourite would probably be the fried calamari that we ordered. It wasn't crispy, which I was disappointed about but the flavours were really good! It was topped with fried onion and bell peppers and served with a spicy mayo on the side. This dish I would definitely order again I also liked their rice dish with fried pork and chicken. The meat was very tasty and cooked well! It had a nice crisp on the outside! The spring rolls (fresh and crispy) were ok, I still prefer them at other restos."}
{"text":"Saw the good reviews for this restaurant and the seemingly good prices and gave it a try. In short, the food is good, but portions (at least for pho) are very small.

I ordered 1 large beef pho and 1 one-size \"medium\" specialty ox blood pho. Both bowls ended up being the same size, even though I paid more to get a \"large\". Anyways, as you can see in my photos, there's not much to eat - they skimp on noodles like many other places, but they skimp out a lot more. There's probably as much noodles in my \"large\" pho as there is in a pack of ramen, barely enough to feed 1 person. The pho place I normally go to I get an XL for $11.50 which has enough to feed 2 people.

The positives are that my pho came steaming hot, which really brought out the flavour of the broth. The broth was also stronger than other places I have been to. The decor is nice and in general it seems much cleaner and more modern than other similar restaurants.

All in all, a decent place, but I personally wouldn't go back. While I did think the food tasted good, I really don't think that makes up for the small portion sizes. I left the restaurant kinda hungry, which in my books warrants an automatic no from me."}
{"text":"This restaurant is located in a busy plaza where the No Frills is located at the Eglinton and Mavis area. The restaurant is well lit, spacious and clean including the Unisex washrooms. 

As soon as we came in, the hostess/server led us to our seats and brought us tea along with the menu. We quickly ordered and food came promptly. We did not wait much. We ordered the Pho with rare beef, beef tendon and rice noodles along with Spring roll and grilled pork in vermicelli. 

The food was good with nice serving portions. However, I agree with other reviewers that it's nothing out of ordinary to give this place a 4* or higher. The rating should definitely be a 3 1/2*. Service is much better than other Pho places where service is non existent. The word average shall be used to describe their food. It's not bad but it's not the best either. 

If you are in the area it's worth a try.

{"text":"Came in with a few coworkers for lunch and the pho was bomb! Not too salty and good broth 

You also need to try their fried banana and rare beef salad."}
{"text":"Bun bo hue is my fav dish! I have tried enough bun bo hue at so many restaurants and this one is the best. The soup was super yummy, it was not that oily like others yet it also got the right amount of spices. I really enjoyed the food and the atmosphere. And it was cleaned!! Will def come back and recommend friends!!!"}
{"text":"When I walked in to the place, it gave me the feeling of clean and neat. Personally, I like the convenience and price of Vietnamese restaurants. I am able to get fibers and protein from lots of dishes here. 

I usually order the special beef pho here. The soup base is clean and I don't see much oil on the surface of the soup compared to other Vietnamese restaurants. The taste of the noodle is appealing to my appetite. 

Besides the Vietnamese cuisine, this place gives us another choice which is Thai food. I haven't tried that yet, but it seems like that those common Thai food are offering here. 

This place is good for individual diners. If you have a group people, you can also share the food together. The portion of each dish is adequate for an usual individual. 

A little advice for the restaurant is that they shall focus a bit more on details even thought I can tell they have been doing that. From the other Vietnamese restaurant I usually dine in, they usually provide a small bowl of soup along the fried rice. Combinations like that will impress customers more and turn them as a more frequent advocates."}
{"text":"Only had the seafood soup here. It was ok. It lacked the seafood. I prefer I love pho for the quantity of meats and seafood in their soup. I'm still willing to give this place another shot. Service was good but it was dead."}
{"text":"New owner new cooks. Food was still good. Different taste from the previous cooks. New menu was available. 
We took the crispy calamari round shaped I really loved the taste very crispy not too salty not too blend. 
Took the noodle was a bit too oily for my taste. The taste was good. Just too oily. 
The same girl is there to serve the table. Still great customer service from her. Quiet but very friendly waitress. Same tv shows just for laugh shows."}
{"text":"I am surprised this place is not packed with people. My boyfriend and I always drive pass the place but finally gave it a try. 

The staff are extremely nice and attentive to our needs.

The food was made quick, I ordered my favourite banh xeo and the boyfriend ordered his favourite, steamed chicken with rice. We both enjoyed it a lot. The portion was also massive.

The decor is modern, very clean place.

I would def recommend and come back."}
{"text":"Stopped by this place last night after seeing the \"new management\" and \"10%\" off sign. i'm sold on a good deal! 
Walked in and was immediately greeted with a friendly face. Place was clean, bright, and very comfy. They have a vast menu with dishes that would suit even the pickiest eater. We grabbed some Spring Rolls and Rice Rolls. 

Guys, now my bf and I have gone to numerous Vietnamese restaurants. However, when we say that their spring rolls are among the best. We mean it! They were so fresh and crispy. They didn't skim on the insides either. MmMM! Price was really reasonable as well. 

I got my usual rare beef and tripe pho while my boyfriend settled for the Bun Bo Hue. I was super impressed that their bean sprouts were very fresh. I even took pictures of it! Most of the places i've gone too give you have dead or about to die bean sprouts that are yellowing. But this place gave us fresh fresh fresh bean sprouts, lime, and purple cabbage. 

What's even better about this place is that they offer sizes S, M, and L. Most places offer either S and L or M and L. I love having the choice of choosing which size I want to devour. 

Sure, their pho tasted like any other place. However, I will admit that their S portion are quite large. Their rare beef is also not fatty like other places. My BF was blown away by their Bún Bò Hu. He knows a good Bún Bò Hu when he tastes it and he ranks this as the top three he's ever had (and he's had plenty). 

Tasty broth, friendly service, clean interior, and great food. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Good food. Terrible service. Servers were incredibly slow even though we were literally the only table at the restaurant. Took them 10 minutes to bring the card machine over to our table AFTER dropping the bill off, and the dirty plates remained on the table up until we left. Would not return."}
{"text":"Based on the hype Vietnamese cuisine is gaining, and how more modern and trendy versions have been popping up, such as Pho Ngoc Yen, I assumed this new place would serve something unique or special. But no, in fact they had quite the opposite. 
First of all they had very limited vegetarian options, and to make it worse, within their limited menu, they failed to serve my favourite-the grilled chicken & rice with fried egg. They did have grilled chicken with pork, grilled chicken with shrimp (too pricey relative to the place), and grilled chicken with steamed egg. So I had to ask them specifically for what I wanted...good thing they didn't refuse my request. 
My friend got the tofu crepe and a side of vegetarian fresh rolls.
The food took longer than most Vietnamese restaurants, but not unbearably long and is something that indicates that they are making their food fresh.
So the crepe apparently was alright, but nothing to go crazy about. My chicken was pretty bland and very tough and crispy, which may be because they overcooked it.

The restaurant had only one table occupied, which surprised us considering it was Saturday night. The decor was typical. There is literally nothing here that is worth visiting...the prices were a bit pricier too. 
For now I'll stick to Pho mi 99 when I'm in craving of a quick Vietnamese meal, but for an ideal dinner I'll keep Pho Ngoc Yen my go to."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the pho here. The flavoring was just right and they give you a good amount of beef. No skimping here! The bean sprouts were also fresh and plentiful. The broth was nice and hot. The service was friendly and quick too. All in all, a good Viet restaurant in this plaza. The only thing is that I'd say is that the spring rolls are not the best."}
{"text":"My GF and I accidentally stumbled upon this restaurant, what captivated us to try it out was the huge sign that read \"Under new management, 10% off\" after an afternoon of shopping at Square One we felt that both our wallets could use the discount!

As we both entered the premises, we were immediately impressed, we were greeted right away in a friendly manner, the place was spacious, well-lit and clean! 

Every time I go to a new pho restaurant, I like try one of two dishes, my main go to dish of Bun Bo Hue or my backup dish of vermicelli and pork. Before we sat down, I managed to steal a quick glance of someone's Bun Bo Hue dish, and it looked pretty decent, so I decided to order that, along with a spring roll order as my appetizer and a mango slush.

The mango slush arrived first, it was very good, very sweet and you can definitely taste the mango flavor.

Afterwards the spring rolls arrived, you could still see the steam coming from them, and so you know that they were just cooked. Upon taking a bite in, you're presented with a very powerful combination of flavours, and they were absolutely delicious, very crispy too! (Some places can't seem to achieve that level of crispiness and it just comes out not as crunchy!)

And at last, my Bun Bo Hue arrived, the onions and green toppings were piled up nicely in the middle of the bowl, so it created a nice looking presentation. Before diving into my first bite of the dish, I sampled the soup, and wow, the soup was very tasty! And just the right amount of spicy for me! It's supposed to be a bit of an oily dish, due to the ingredients in it, but some places just can't seem to achieve that right combination and that oil just seems to sit there in the back of your throat, but that wasn't the case with this soup. They used the round noodles, which is good, it's not the instant kind, and the meat there was plentiful and nicely cut as well!

Overall, a very positive experience, and we definitely won't mind coming back here!"}
