{"text":"This place is awesome!  The soups are delicious and homemade.  They people working there make the experience and the paninis are bomb!  Love this place!  What a find!"}
{"text":"This place is a stand in the Pittsburgh Public Market.  While in town visiting we checked it out in the market.  We tried a spicy sour soup and a grilled cheese with tomatoes and basil on an artisan bread.  The soup was excellent fresh, tasty and flavorful.  The grilled cheese had just the perfect amount of cheese and paired perfectly.  $6 total, a real deal."}
{"text":"I enjoyed a few $5 Friday lunches from Soup Nancys at the Pittsburgh Public Market.  I was always impressed by the creative flavor combinations and the number of vegetarian and vegan options available.  The sandwiches weren't bad either.  I was sad to learn they have decided to leave the Pittsburgh Public Market.  However I was glad to learn that \"Nancy\" is still making soup and it is available at a few select locations around town including Great Harvest Bread Company (a place I became familiar with at a Yelp event), Bryant Street Market (a tiny market in Highland Park), Big Idea Bookstore (a cool little used bookstore in Bloomfield) and Staghorn Garden Cafe.    It was always nice to visit the other vendors at PPM, but now that Soup Nancys is available around town, it reminds me of a few other small businesses I should frequent more often."}
{"text":"Delicious homemade style soups.  They don't cut corners, just delicious soups that will have you returning for more.  I had the clam chowder, which was a traditional New England chowder.  It comes with fresh slices of bread or a roll.  People rave about the black bean soup, so I will have to go back to try that next.  Part of the fun is talking to the Soup Nancys (neither one is named Nancy).  They are smart, articulate and funny."}
{"text":"These two amazing women serve up the best soup I've ever had at the recently relocated Pittsburgh Public Market.  They usually offer three soups - meaty/veggie/vegan - so there is something for everyone.  In addition to hot fresh soups, they offer delicious hot sandwiches and grilled cheese.  Don't forget to ask about the frozen soups to go that will satisfy all off hour soup cravings!"}
{"text":"The soup here is amazing. It's homemade and jam-packed with delicious ingredients. They serve up a fresh vegan, veggie, and meat soup on the daily!  The black bean and the Moroccan were great, but my favorite was a spinach, lentils, and coconut milk. I could eat it for every meal! In fact, I loved it so much, we brought a quart home to enjoy!  I'm excited to try others since the \"menu\" changes daily  (It's posted on Facebook!)  The owners are adorable and clearly enjoy their business. Neither of them is named Nancy--the name is a play on Seinfeld's \"Soup Nazi\".  Check out Soup Nancy's (and other cool eateries) in the new Pittsburgh Public Market!"}
