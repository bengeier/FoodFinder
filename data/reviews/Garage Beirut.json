{"text":"The food was delicious. The sever any questions I had I had about the menu, was super friendly and her suggestions was so tasty.The service was fantastic."}
{"text":"Very good food. We liked every thing we tried. The fried cheese rolls and hummus with ground lamb were our favorites.  Nice seating outside and good service."}
{"text":"Would love to know the thought process behind charging 14 bucks for a single skewer of chicken with no sides? Then have the audacity to charge 3 bucks for small bit of rice and 6 for a small salad. Good food but way over priced... Not coming back"}
{"text":"Nice place,friendly staff. Appetizers were great muhhamrrah, and garlic potatoes. The Mixed grill was nice.  I don't recommend their desert."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Lebanese restaurant in downtown. To capture the taste of the food try a few of their appetizers, especially the Muhamara and their Mixed grill plate is excellent. Great service, very friendly staff and it's a very cozy restaurant."}
{"text":"Wonderful! Garage Beirut has plenty of options for vegetarians, helpful and kind service, and exceptional, authentic food. The moussaka was incredible. We shared everything and left full."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious and wonderful service. Get the mixed grill and the garlic potatoes. Also for appetizer get the cheese rolls and the fried meatball. And dessert get the ricotta cheese one. And a Turkish coffee. When we couldn't decide our server made those recommendations and they were superb!"}
{"text":"Love this place for takeout! Great food both meat and vegetarian friendly. Large menu and have never been disappointed with anything I tried in the past."}
{"text":"Amazing food! By faar the best Lebanese restaurant I've tasted in Montreal. The food is authentic, and quality ingredients are used. Excellent presentation and service as well."}
{"text":"pretty good middle eastern / lebenease food!   loved it, make sure to ask the waitress for her recommendations!"}
{"text":"We decided to eat here because of the reviews. $35 for two kofta skewers with one spoonful of congealed hummus on a plate. My daughter had a few cubes of chicken. Basket of pita. Tea pot with two cheap bags of mint tea. Service was less than welcoming and spent more time serving a large group of people who were loud, rude, and obnoxious. Waited forever for the bill. I finally asked for it and was rudely told \"it's at the cash register\" like I was supposed to know that.  Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"The food and service were excellent.  They had tradition along with unique dishes and both were great."}
{"text":"This is a little gem of a place. Not your typical local Middle Eastern eatery."}
{"text":"Came here on a whim for dinner before a show at the Bell Centre.  Small, rustic setting.  Food was delicious.  We had the dip sampler and were almost full before our dinner came.  Haloumi was great, and chicken skewers were to die for, especially the garlic dip.  Waitress was very friendly and service was quick.  We got there early and were glad we did cause all of the tables were reserved starting at 6pm.  If we lived closer we'd probably get takeout weekly!"}
{"text":"Excellent Lebanese! The chicken skewers are not getting the attention from yelpers they deserve. So tender and flavorful! And I'm not that much of a chicken lover. The fried pita chips on the salad really were a stand out too--so light and crisp. And the pomegranate-molasses dressing was lovely.   I decided even though my husband doesn't eat baba ghanoush I would order some just for me. The server thoughtfully offered to bring it in a to go container."}
{"text":"The food is so authentic, everything is on point , we took out because they where full, looking forward to discovering the rest of the menu. Gentleman that helped with our takeout order was very nice & knowledgeable. Do get thrown off by the place , just sit down & have them bring you delicious food! Came back 2ND time just as on point as the first time. Fantastic"}
{"text":"The food was amazing. Everything was fresh, well seasoned and cooked to perfection. The server was great. My husband and I were visiting from NYC and we just stumbled on this place. I would absolutely come again if I am in Montreal."}
{"text":"This review pertains to a vegetarian sampling of the menu.  Came here for lunch on such an absolutely perfect day.  Was able to grab one of the three sets of tables on the terrasse.  As others have said this place is all about the meats.  However, since at this time I am unable to eat any delicious meat, I stuck with the vegetarian fare, which is kind of lacking in choice.  I grabbed a small fatouch, a plate of hummus, and loubieh (which was on special).  The fatouch was just a regular salad with dried pita in it.  It was average, but solid.  The hummus was good, but very big for one person so you needed a lot of pieces of pita in order to finish it.  I would recommend to share a plate of it with someone.  The loubieh was also okay, but contained a little too much oil.  Even though I didn't eat any meat, I was full afterward and the prices are reasonable.  I will have to go back and check out the shish taouk to see how it compares to other similar places."}
{"text":"Tried Garage Beirut for the first time tonight having hear great things about it from Lebanese friends. I was not disappointed. If felt like being in Lebanon. Of course it was not perfect (and no restaurant ever is): the tabouli was quite salty, the staff was short handed. But it was overall a good experience; the servers were friendly and knew how to advise you on your order. I do not recommend for large parties as place is small. But it only adds to its city charm."}
{"text":"Hands down... coming from a Lebo, this tasted as close to mamas as you can get. Food is beyond delicious. Thomas our server was so friendly, prompt and so attentive. No bells and whistle here.. modest seating and accommodation  but the humility is made up in the food! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Great Lebanese food! Originally Lebanese here, usually avoid Arabic food in Montreal cuz it either sucks or is overpriced and not worth it. But this place is it. Good food, authentic and fairly priced. Will def come back."}
{"text":"Excellent petit restaurant. Menu libanais traditionnel sans chichi et efficace. Parfait pour les petit porte monnaie."}
{"text":"Very tasty Lebanese food. Simple setting and young vibe.  I dont remember the spelling of all small dishes we ordered but included tabuleh,  baba ganush, and kofta pita.  The Lebanese red wine was surprisingly good . The only part I did not enjoy was the service. It felt that the only waitress was always forgetting something, apologizing, and feeling overwhelmed with all the customers. I just think they should have two people on the front of the house to improve their service.   . I would recommend to someone craving middle eastern fare."}
{"text":"Worst service ever. Came for dinner. Gentleman managing reservation was rude and would not seat us. Said no room. Then while talking a couple of tables opened but he still would not seat us. He wanted to go home as the restaurant would close in 90 minutes! If the owner was there, I am sure we would have had a different experience. It was three of us, dressed formally. Hopefully the owner gets to look into this."}
{"text":"This place is top notch.  Not only it is affordable, friendly and well-located, the food is really delicious.  It was so good that we ate there twice during our 48 hours worth of time in Montreal.  We asked the friendly server what she recommended-- the tabboule, fattouch, mixed grill for two, hummus, potatoes with garlic sauce, and assorted fried appetizers for the four of us-- we got it all; it was perfect and delicious.  The potatoes in garlic sauce were so delicious that we went back the next day for them to get as a snack and I have googled all of the restaurants in my city to see if I can find a substitute.  I am not sure I can live without them.  We could see the chef right behind the counter and he graciously chatted with us both evenings.  I cannot say enough good about this place."}
{"text":"Coming from Kebab heaven (close to Green Lanes, North London, UK), my kebab standards are very high. Unfortunately, Garage Beirut did not meet these high expectations. No availability of lamb on the menu, despite it being listed, was a disappointment - please update this! Portion size was fairly average to small, and the general quality, although tasty and fresh, did not create a party in my mouth. Staff were friendly, but the venue was a bit small. In summary, it somewhat fulfils my kebab craving, but did not knock it out of the park - my kebab odyssey in Montreal continues..."}
{"text":"Great Lebanese food! Went twice in one week, both times with the toughest critics  - my Lebanese parents, who also loved it! The humous, baba ghanouj, fattoush, garlic potato, shish tawou2 and knefe were all excellent and authentic! The service was outstanding, our server Carolina was very warm and friendly! Will definitely be returning here when in Montreal!"}
{"text":"tiny dining area but the food was delicious and the service was good as well.  we had the chicken and beef kebob as well as the humus."}
{"text":"After reading about Garage Beirut in the newspaper, I was very excited to try it out.  I had the shish taouk (sandwich only, about $6.75) - it only contained chicken, sauce, and a pickle.  The ingredients were fresh and made to order. The chicken wasn't the 'sliced' type found in most shish taouk places, but rather strips or cubes.  It was tender and moist.  I found that garlic sauce to be lacking some 'oumph', and a bit watery.   The sandwich was a bit small compared to what you'd get at most places, but overall was pretty good."}
{"text":"This is more of a sit-down restaurant than many of the other Lebanese places in Montreal.  It's very welcoming and comfortable (I'm not sure why people criticize for a 'lack of ambiance': it's got tons.  Food ranges from pretty standard to excellent.  The hummus might be some of the best I've ever tasted."}
{"text":"Do they cook the best quality foods or what? :)  This kitchen is absolutely providing the most amazing appetizers and kabobs!   I wish the whole planet could eat there lol"}
{"text":"The tabbouleh is fresh and fragrant, the meats are tasty and all the dips are amazing. We enjoyed our meal here and the service was friendly and responsive."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time tonight and the food was absolutely amazing! Don't want to over - hype it but could have been the best Lebanese food I've ever eaten! Try it, I think you'll really enjoy!"}
{"text":"Great food no Doubt !! Waiters plzz be kind and put a smile on your face !!!  It would be 5 stars with better waiters"}
{"text":"Went for dinner her before going to the movies last night. I'm fairly picky about Lebanese food because I grew up with it at home. So I was wary.   Overall the food tasted good, but there were a few issues:  I ordered the shish taouk sandwich. it was small. really skinny. A lot smaller than you would get at any other place. the chicken itself was good, but there was only chicken bread, and two or three pickles and garlic sauce in it.   My order came with French fries which were lackluster. they were clearly frozen french fries mass bought.  for the same amount of money you could get just as tasty food but with a LOT more food at Basha's or Sara's. I most likely will opt for those other options if I ever crave Lebanese."}
{"text":"Best Labanese food I've had in a while. Great ambience. A little small but food makes uo for it."}
{"text":"Delicious Lebanese food! I love the mezze. The atmosphere is simple but it brings me back to midle east with the nice music."}
{"text":"Excellent service, hummus, fried kibble, and probably the best shish tawook sandwich I've ever had!"}
{"text":"The appetizers were great The main course was copious and delicious The atmosphere was welcoming The decoration was modern and elegant Is there an issue even worth mentioning with this restaurant?  In regards to my personal experience, the only thing lacking was the service. It was slow and the waitresses made lots of mistakes. Of course, I'm not a god damn sociopath and I understand that mistakes happen. But was the attitude on top of that justified? I gently asked them if the food was ready and the waitress gave me an attitude and passive-aggressively reminded me that it was a full night. So? You're supposed to organize a restaurant in a way that you can pull through even during full nights. Don't blame the customers for wanting to eat at your place. Stalin didn't blame the workers of being too numerous when centrally planning the economy of the USSR! This minor rumpus aside, I enjoyed my night and definitely advise anyone to grab a bite at this place if you don't mind occasional fuck ups by waiters (hey, it can happen!)"}
{"text":"I went to this place with really high expectations from the reviews I read here, I really wanted to like this place, but unfortunately what I experienced was not so good. Staff: super friendly! ( there was only one girl there who apparently was also helping in the kitchen which made it hard for her to take care of the customers) however, she was friendly and I have to say it. I haf kafta and my friend had beef cubes. First we asked for lamb cubes, but the girl told us they don't have it. All good so far, eh? We also ordered Babaganoush which was ok. Finally after 30 min or so the food arrived! Cold!!!!!!!!!!! We wanted to tell the waitress/chef but she was not around. Even when we got in no one showed up for 5-6 min and in the end I went almost to the kitchen to get the menus! Anyways, the food arrived cold, mine was ok in terms of flavor a lil bland. However my friend's beef cubes were well seasoned and delicious. To be honest the food portion is so small that at first I thought its for a kid!!!! N it was 15$!!!!!! Finally after waiting so long again the girl came and asked us if we want a dessert. My friend ordered Baklava which she said they dont make it anymore, and I ordered Kanafa which the girl told me she has to go check if they still have it! It took her another 15 min!!! Finally we had kanafa, however I asked for a knife as it was so sticky, when she showed up with a knife I was done!!!!! My biggest complain about this place is the price!!! It cost us 50$ for 2 happy meals( seriously I'm still hungry writing this, and no I dont eat a lot!), a babaganoush and one kanafa!!!! Seriously there is something wrong!!!!! The thing is the food was really normal, nothing spectacular!!! Definitely not going back there again!!!!!"}
{"text":"Salle très petite pour laquelle il vaut mieux réserver. Service efficace, discret et peut être un peu froid mais malgré tout attentionné. Nous étions 6 et les plats sont arrivés très rapidement. Seul petit regret la cave à vin qui était en rupture de stock. Un peu cours au niveau de la disponibilité des vins. Juste 1 bouteille de vin blanc. Globalement je recommande pour la qualité et la finesse des mets que nous avons dégusté. Tout est vraiment plein de saveurs et un vrai régal pour les papilles. Bien que courte au niveau de la carte, les vins libanais sont excellents. En résumé, petit endroit discret, rapidement plein mais d'une très grande qualité culinaire. À faire et refaire sans aucune hésitation."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews, I practically ran to Garage Beirut as I've been feeling a bit let down with the lack of really authentic Lebanese food in the city.  Upon arriving, we decided to split some plates and opted for the meat fatteh, fattouch, halloumi, and mouhammara.  Everything came out at the same time, and we quickly dug in but were a bit disappointed...My measure of a good Lebanese restaurant always starts with their fattouch - this one was a total let down as have most of the fattouch salads in the city. The mouhammara was good but not great, and the halloumi was overcooked. The best dish was the fatteh but by the end of the meal, I wasn't even inspired enough to try their cheese knefeh so left without dessert.  Portions are large but prices are a bit high - not too impressed overall but may come back to try their grilled meats and meat hummus (and knefeh). A-OK but didn't blow my socks off as I hoped!"}
{"text":"The taste is great but disappointed by the quantity. The portion is perfect for small eaters but will cost you atleast $13. If you're going in a group, better to order the sharing platter. Comes with loads of stuff and price efficient. I ordered chilli kebab which is the same as normal kebab but with chilli sauce(I would recommend sticking with regular kebab because the chili sauce doesn't add too much flavour). I thought the dish will come with rice but we only got fries, not even salad. But the kebabs themselves are full of flavours and very delicious. Try it some time. But probably not coming back."}
{"text":"I absolutely loved This place. It's cozy, clean and the food is fantastic! I ordered the kafta , but ended up getting kebab instead (the server swears it's what I ordered and I didn't, but I didn't argue because it was good anyway). This is definitely going to be a stop every time I'm in Montreal. I'm only not giving 5 stars for the service- the server assumed I didn't want the hummus I ordered because my meal came with hummus and didn't put it in. We also waited a long time to get service even though the place is pretty small. Still, I'll be back!!"}
{"text":"Everything was delicious and authentic. Must try if you are in downtown. Fillet mignon was the best meat dish . The hummus was great and so was the sojok."}
{"text":"Great little restaurant!  The food was really good, the wine was nice too. And the waitress was really sweet and helpful. She gave recommendations. I would definitely recommend that place. I'm not really knowledgeable on Lebanese food but all I know is that is was really tasteful, and not expensive at all for what you get! I will definitely go back to try more things!  PS: the Fatteh Humus is amazing!!"}
{"text":"What a gem! Everything we ate was fresh, flavorful and reasonably priced.  Our server was personable without being invasive or interrupting the meal.  Highly recommend the red pepper and walnut dip as well as the tabbouleh. Great for a date or a night out with friends. Would highly recommend if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Quite disappointed by my order.  Kebab sandwich was ok but not exceptional and the home fries were too cooked.  I'll not come back"}
{"text":"If you're into babaganouch make sure to get some. It was awesome. Also the yogurt marinated chicken kebabs. No frills, pleasant ambiance and friendly service. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Très bon petit restaurant libanais, parfait pour des repas entre amis!  Il faut connaître cette place car c'est un peu un coin où il n'y a pas grand chose! Mais définitivement une super place ou déguster toutes les spécialités libanaises et ce pour un prix vraiment dérisoire! Tous les mezzes qu'ils soient chauds ou froids sont sublimes et le pain pita est à volonté! À tester de toute urgence!"}
{"text":"First time eating Lebanese food. Had a great time. Food was good and so was the service. Recommended some nice dishes for my wife and I to share. Really cute venue."}
{"text":"I passed by this place a few times and was intrigued.  I am really happy I went there to eat yesterday.   Kibbeh was deliciously crunchy. Hummus creamy, baba ghanouj real tasty.   come here if you want real authentic food."}
{"text":"The grilled platter was fantastic! We really enjoyed the Sojok. The best one we have tried so far. Overall this place is one of a kind for AMAZING food and service!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious, the fatouche salad was so refreshing and the shish taouk with tahini was just what I was looking for."}
{"text":"I came here with 5 friends last week and loved everything about the experience. We didn't have a reservation at this very small restaurant but luckily someone cancelled at the last minute. We jumped on the opportunity and sat down. The server was very polite and refilled our waters constantly. The food was absolutely delicious. My partner and I shared the soujok and kabab khash khash with rice on the side. It was perfect! The sausages were sweet and delicious, also a very large portion, and I'm glad we had ordered rice because the kabab came alone with some pita (for the table) and garlic sauce/ hummus.  I found the meal to be absolutely delicious and the price to be suitable. More than anything, it was an excellent spot for new and old friends alike to meet and converse. I'll be back to try more."}
{"text":"We considered moving to MTL because of this place. The food was FANTASTIC and the service was great. We had a bit of a wait as it was a last minute choice but well worth it.   The fatteh hummus was so spot on and the shish taouk was enjoyed by the meat eaters. We got a side of potatoes which sent us over the edge but we couldn't stop eating ;)"}
{"text":"Loved the food here. Probably one of the good ones here is Montreal. Everything was delicious, typical mezze although well executed, the grilled meat was awesome. The decor is a little bit of a let down but this is not a fancy spot, you come here for the food. Will be back."}
{"text":"There is much needed improvement in terms of food at this Lebanese inspired downtown restaurant.  First off, portions are a bit small.  Chicken kebob platter was not as spiced as I like served on pita with a very sweet tomato spread that over powered the flavor of anything else.  It also comes with a small side of crispy if a tad bit greasy fries.  Also tried crispy pita smothered in that very sweet tomato sauce with minced meat.  Again, the minced meat was over powered by the spread.  The hummus, however, was great.  Luckily, they gave us ample amounts of pita to fill up on.  For the price, they're just not on par with the portion sizes so there's a minor rip off feel.  The staff though were great.  Very accommodating and very friendly to us.  If you're not very hungry, then this place is a good option for a small meal."}
{"text":"We had a fantastic dinner at Garage Beirut. We visited GB during F1 weekend when all prices seem inflated. Not at GB. They delivered a fantastic sampling of Lebanese food for a good price. Loved the attentive and friendly service. A place to put on your list when you visit Montreal."}
{"text":"Word of truth, after reading the reviews I was encouraged to visit. Very disappointed, I won't comment on the taste, my biggest concern it's very dirty, zero effort + some of the stuff really smell bad, sorry"}
{"text":"J'ai bien aimé une petite soirée ici l'été dernier sur la terrasse. La nourriture est de qualité et l'ambiance est agréable.  Nourriture typique du Moyen-Orient avec kebab, hummus et autres plats régionaux. Recommandé bien que j'ai quand même trouvé l'addition un peu cher (du moins en soirée)."}
{"text":"Honestly don't know what the hype is about!! Food was mediocre.  I'm Lebanese and have had much better food than this here and in LA. I can't understand the reviews nor the number of people that came yesterday evening for dinner. They serve the smallest portions when you order kebabs they literally serve you 3 pieces of meat per skewer and you only get 2 and no side dishes unless you pay extra. Anything you order is extra and so expensive for what you are getting. My suggestion go to Baba in the mall or  Boustan. Cheaper and oh so much better in taste. And so satisfying!! However the servers were very nice as most people here in Montreal are as someone from LA it is so refreshing to be around kind people!! So loving Canada and it's fabulous people!!"}
{"text":"Very tasty and service was great. We ordered the kafta, a lamb dish and the eggplant (I forgot the names, sorry!). I wish the serving sizes were a little bit larger. It's more of a tapas style restaurant"}
{"text":"Vraiment très frais et bon :) une petite place plein de simplicité et de charme.  Le shishtaouk est tout simplement excellent."}
{"text":"We found this place on yelp while we were searching amongst the many options in Montreal. This place was unassuming from the outside. You have to go down a few steps to get to the entrance. The dishes we tried just hit the spot. The mousaka with eggplant was incredibly tasty and the kafta skewers were well seasoned. The service was attentive. Would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Great food and hospitality.  We had the appetizer dip platter, tabbouli, halloumi, skewer platter, and wine.  Everything down to the mint tea and Turkish coffee was amazing."}
{"text":"Very good food for a very low price, but it isn't a fancy place. Go all out and a big dinner for two will cost you less than $45 including tax and tip. The grilled meat was awesome. The ambiance wasn't so good and it can be cold in the winter. I'd recommend for the food."}
{"text":"My fave authentic Lebanese food in Montreal. For my full review, check out my blog post here: https://therealmtlfoodie.wordpress.com/2018/04/09/heres-why-you-gotta-try-garage-beirut-in-montreals-downtown-core/"}
{"text":"Pretty authentic Lebanese food, friendly staff and good location. Definitely a must for middle eastern food in Montréal!"}
{"text":"Had a great time here with a large group! We had 16 and they gave us essentially a set course meal for $20CAD a person (they quoted $25 but it seems to be a flexible number and they will adjust the contents of the meal accordingly)   Their hummus was alright, but their baba gnoush was fantastic! They gave us as much pita as we wanted too. In general, everything was fantastic, they accommodated our large group perfectly, and adjusted to our vegetarian's needs as well. It was a good mix of meat and non-meat courses, and by the end, everyone felt stuffed. The communal feel of the meal was also fantastic, with 4 people sharing a large set of food   If you are in downtown Montreal with a big group, definitely recommend calling ahead and booking here"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner.  Wonderful food!  Good service.  Prices very fair and portion sizes were great.  Definitely order the potatoes and also try the beef dumplings. Chicken tavouk was fabulous. Small location, so I would not recommend for large parties, but for a date or small group. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Garage Beirut is a small but cozy Lebanese restaurant nestled in the Guy-Concordia area. Although portions seem small, they are filling if you order some of the sides which aren't very expensive. I came here for Valentine's Day with my boyfriend who really likes this place and I wasn't disappointed! The shish taouk is incredibly flavourful and so are the garlic potatoes. I like their ambiance too. The price is a little steep for student everyday eats but definitely a treat yo self!"}
{"text":"Really delicious Lebanese food for the pricing. Ordered the food and took it back to the office for dinner. The meat skewers are juicy and supple. The garlic potatoes and fattoush salad are amazing. If you're going to order from this place, make sure you get some extra sauces on the side - they give enough but you just want to have more!"}
{"text":"Vey good food but i hated the lack of decor or ambiance and the fact that it was freeezing cold. I'd go back for the food but only for lunch when i'm not looking for a nice dinner experience."}
{"text":"We decided to check out Garage Beirut given all the good reviews here on Yelp and craving for some middle eastern food! Not completely disappointed but certainly expected more. We ordered the mixed hot appetizer plate and also the mixed grill plate (for 2). Was disappointed that the appetizer did not come with any hummus or other sauce, and presentation of the dish was extremely basic. The mixed grill was delicious and a good amount for 2 people to share. The chicken was probably the best.   Staff was friendly enough though the waiter did not smile even once! The decor is unique and the ambiance very intimate (i.e. tables are super close to each other).   I'm on the fence about whether I would visit again."}
{"text":"I've eaten at a number of Lebanese restaurants in the Montreal area and I dare say this might be my new favorite.  The atmosphere is cozy and inviting and the prices are incredibly reasonable relative to the quantity and quality of the food that is served. Our party of four shared a few of the tasting dishes and we all left very satisfied.  It is evident that the  chefs take a great amount of pride in preparing meals that are authentic and flavorful. The icing on the cake was the phenomenal service we enjoyed. Our server was extremely vibrant, friendly and knowledgeable and did a great job of guiding us through the menu.  I am positive that this will not be our last time eating at the Garage Beirut."}
{"text":"The dishes in this restaurant are the closest to the Lebanese food available here in downtown Montréal. Which has mushroomed with Basha and Amir's likes, that are pretending to be Lebanese. The interior is small, with few tables, and Lebanese stamps and movie posters covering the wall.  The service is very good, the waitress is kind and ready to answer all our questions and take our requests with a smile. You can start drinking arak and sharing mezzes with friends; hommos with meat, cheese rolls, tabbouleh, fattoush, Arayes kafta, fatit hommos, if you still aren't full order grilled meat veal, kafta, khashkhash and chicken. And end it with a delicious desert, the knefeh."}
{"text":"fantastic little hidden gem. Food was delicious! Prices were good and the staff is extremely friendly. the spot is an adorable little space with no more than 8 tables. LOVED IT!!!"}
{"text":"Ambiance très chaleureuse et cadre très mignon. Les plats ne sont pas copieux mais très bon. Parfait pour un lunch entre amis."}
{"text":"Loved this place so much and reminded me so much of home.   I'm the biggest critic for middle eastern food cause I have had the best Lebanese food growing up. Garage Beirut does justice to the kebabs, shish taouk and tabouleh.   This place is such a good find and I highly recommend everyone to go here for Lebanese food cravings. I was a bit upset about the hummus and pita bread not being fresh- but the rest of the food was absolutely on point.   I would suggest not ordering the garlic potato as well because it was too charred.   Overall loved the ambience, their special beer, the service and the labneh.   Now, I must go to my master plan of being besties with the chef and learning everything he cooks"}
{"text":"I like the flavour of the food! The presentation is very good too. However, after ordering the food, the wait was quite long for the food to arrive. There was quite a bit of time between appetizer and entree. Nonetheless the food was savoury."}
{"text":"Garage Beirut is one of my favorite Lebanese restaurants in Montreal. It offers a lot more than the usual kebabs. The service is always friendly every time I visit.  Some recommended dishes: Fattouch - crispy pita bread on a bed of salads. The crunchy texture is really delicious! Mouhammara - Peppers and walnuts. It has a sweet taste and is perfect with pita bread Fatayer bil sbénegh - fried spinach pastry with lemon. Really good!"}
{"text":"I have been eating lunch here fairly regularly for a couple of years now...since they opened, whenever that was. The service is very friendly and informative...always willing to explain new menu items. Despite the lunch rush, service is good and you don't feel rushed to eat and get out.  The food is excellent. The various meat items ( order the little sausages) are well cook and seasoned. The baba ganoush is creamy and bursting with flavour. And the hummus is delicious.   Two can dine for under $30 and walk out totally satisfied...although a breath mint or two might be in order.  If unsure of what to order and the place is not too busy, leave yourself in the very capable hands of the chef/owner....he will see to it that you have a wonderful meal.  This is an excellent choice regardless of price."}
{"text":"First dining experience in Montreal and it did not disappoint. We came around the dinner opening time at 5:15pm and we were the first ones there. Over the course of our meal another 3 tables became occupied and with good reason... This food is amazing!   We ordered the Fattet Lahmen, Fatouche salad and Shish Taouk Chili. The  Fattet Lahmen was very rich in flavours and gave a sensory experience like no other. There are bursting pomegranate seeds, crunchy pita, buttery cashews, flavourful lamb, and chickpeas all bathed in a savoury yogurt-tahini. This dish was very sensual but somehow made me feel light at the same time. The Fatouche was also very good, another great mix of flavours between sweet, minty and sour. Finally, the Shish Taouk Chili (chili being kind of self explanatory for the flavour) was grilled to perfection!   All in all a great experience, from the service to the food! The portions are appropriately sized if you can stop yourself from ordering more of this foody goodness and the price is fairly affordable as well."}
{"text":"Awesome place. Great food great service. The head chef (and I think owner) came out and talked to us and made us feel very special. By far the best restaurant I've been to in Montreal so far."}
{"text":"Amazing service and food. Our server Leila she was awesome, she paid attention to every single detail and made sure that we get everything we need. Keep it up great lebanese food"}
{"text":"Great little Lebanese spot where the music fits the space and the food. Service is attentive and the food delicious and cooked to order. Took us back to our years spent in the Middle East. Highly recommend it if you're in central Montreal."}
{"text":"The food was so tasty yum but in menu this dish was mentioned it is for two  !!! I was shocked how small it was  other than that everything was good"}
{"text":"Authentic middle eastern cuisine that tastes just like your mom's cooking--trust! This place is totally worth the visit whether you're craving fatteh or some gooood satisfying knafeh like the stuff from back home.   Definitely call and reserve else you'll have to wait in line!"}
{"text":"More \"Garden shed\" that \"Garage\" this literal hole in the wall produces some of the best Lebanese food I've tasted in a very long while.  Centrally located just 1/2 a block off Saint Cath's on the deceptively quiet Rue Mackay, Garage Beirut is surrounded by a slew of ethnic restaurants ranging from Taiwanese to Jamaican and I've already booked marked some for future visits.  Reservations are a must as the tiny whitewashed dining room with a open kitchen can only accommodate 25 diners with another 10 on the front patio. You make friends quickly not only because of the tight quarters but everyone seem to be enjoying their meal,each other's company and even the piped in Lebanese pop backed up by the joyous and on key kitchen staff. I love the vibe.  The menu is short and focused, divided into Salads featuring the popular Fattouche and Tabbouleh. Cold and hot Mezzes with everything from Baba Gannouj,Hummus and Kibbeh Nayyeh to Moussaka and my new favorite Sojok. Traditional dishes and Charcoal grilled section held kababs, Shish Taouk, and even a Filet Mignon...hardly traditional but forgiven since the balance of the menu and what comes to the table is so authentic.  We started with the Baba Ghannouj plated with Pomegranate and mint.  This was so creamy,smokey and savory with just that little background bite that the tahini and perhaps just a touch of fenugreek brings to the table,scooped up with a light, thin Lebanese pita used as our primary dining utensil is a excellent start.  Next came the mixed pastries which had fillings of spinach and cheese,minced meats,melted cheese and an excellent Kibbeh.good but I thought a bit bland after enjoying our Baba Gannouj.  Our next dish took us by surprise simply because the melding of all the bold flavors in it resulted in such a delicious and sublime dish.  Sojok is charcoal grilled makanek sausages that is then sliced and lightly sauteed in a sauce of Pomegranate molasses,Lebanese 7 spice, olive oil and I believe I  just a hint of Harissa plated with sliced shallots and fresh parsley. The firm lamb/pork sausage resting in all it's spicy,complex and so satisfying juices sopped up with the pita with just a dab of baba ghannouj is a bite you'll remember long after you've departed Garage Beirut and Montreal.  Our final entree was the very good Khash- Khash kabab which was a pair of grilled minced meats on a bed of grilled and spiced tomatoes, crisped pita strips,onions,parsley,7 spice and a serving of Hummus. Spicy with that deep smokey finish from the charcoal grill,the kabab cooled by the Hummus and bright crushed tomatoes scooped with our now replenished pita and we are DONE!......or are we?  Dessert of a delightfully \"jiggly\" orange blossom flavored milk pudding swimming in a sweet sauce with a sprinkling of chopped pistachios is refreshing and entertaining at the same time but I would have much preferred the rose water flavored version Beirut is famous for and a wonderfully chewy sweet cheese tart in the same sauce, a thick,dark,rich Turkish coffee with just a hint of cardamom is the ideal end to a very satisfying meal.  I really like this cozy little restaurant with it's delightful staff and great menu and can't wait to return but before I end.... The chairs... what's up with the chairs?  The wooden armed chairs are of the type that tends to tightly hug and seemingly won't let go of the posteriors of shall we say? \" the rather wide of beam\" or \"broad of transom\"...and several times during our meal I feared that more than one of our fellow diners would be taking one of these well worn chairs home with them....   Make a reservation, order the Sojok, have the Turkish coffee and beware of the chairs but please don't miss dining at Garage Beirut."}
{"text":"Small and cozy place in located in downtown Montreal. Serves Lebanese food. Having lived most of my life in Lebanon I can say that garage beirut is the closest thing i had in Montreal to authentic Lebanese cuisine and meza with good and wide selection."}
{"text":"Absolutely love the food and the staff at this place! The owner is so passionate about cooking and that really tastes in his food. Everything is super fresh and high quality. Charcoal grill makes the best kafta and chicken!"}
{"text":"Three students got sick to the point of throwing up. They ordered the chicken wrap. Naji takes zero responsibility and blames the kids instead. \"Maybe they drank alcohol.\"    If you don't mind getting sick to the point of throwing up and have an arrogant manager take no responsibility for it, be my guest.    Naji, you need to take a course on customer relations."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! There was mainly one waitress serving all the tables and she did a really good job--kudos to her. The service was excellent.  We ordered:  - Fattouche Salad: The salad was so so good. I don't know how else to describe it. It was refreshing and tasty with the fried pita bread. - Fatteh Hummus: The hummus was absolutely delicious. The waitress also gave us additional pita bread without any charge! My only issue with this dish is that the hummus was slightly watery. But since the taste was top notch, I can leave the texture of the hummus pass.  - Shish Taouk skewers: The meat was very tender and the garlic sauce was delicious!  - Assorted Pastry Plate: The dish was tasty but my only concern was that the portions were small. Not sure I would get this again if I come back to this restaurant.  -  Mouhallabie (I believe it is spelled this way): This milk flan was really refreshing.   All in all, highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I have no idea what this restaurant deserves for a rating. 8:45 on a Tuesday night. Uber eats and Al a Carte crowding the counter. \"Sorry we're out of food.\" Good luck with that."}
{"text":"It is just great. It is a small place But The food is awesome. Everything You Ask for is gonna be good. YOU must try And enjoy it."}
{"text":"We had a fantastic meal here!  The service was fantastic and the restaurant really had a feeling of authenticity.  The price was very reasonable and the waitress recommended some great dishes to try. Definitely get the sampler platters.  The humus was also fantastic."}
{"text":"This review is years overdue. Hopefully, quality is still where it was. Amazingly good food! Their meats were grilled perfectly--juicy and flavorful. Hummus and baba ganoush were also very good."}
{"text":"4 out of 5 - food is solid, great location and our server Marwa made the experience.   Mouskaa, Fattoush and baba ganoush were fantastic but the mixed grilled meats were the star of show, tender and perfectly grilled.   Overall a great place to dine."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed the food here. The service can be a little slow but that's onl because they don't have enough staff for all the people coming in and take out and etc. If you are a big group, make sure only one person communicates at a time or you will confuse them  That aside, everything we had was very good: the dip tasters, skewers, pastry assortments etc.  Would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Amazing! First Lebanese restaurant that made me feel like I was back home. They made everything perfectly, the chicken taouk was to die for. Staff is super friendly, generous portions and great prices. Will definitely go back"}
{"text":"This Lebanese restaurant was introduced to me by very good friend from Lebanon. And he was absolutely right - if you want to try out authentic Lebanese food, with more options than just kebabs, this is the place to go. The place is small and usually packed, so it is good to make reservations in advance. They have Lebanese wine which goes well with the food. The ambience is casual and the service friendly. They also have a terrace which is a good option for summers. The prices are worth the quality of food and service. Have to go back again for trying more things on the menu."}
{"text":"Food was delicious and very good but the tables around me were dirty and weren't cleaned the whole time I had my dinner.  Not fun to eat while all tables are dirty around you."}
{"text":"Best Lebanese food I had in Canada so far. Yelp brought me here and it did not let me down!!!! They had a lot of végétarien choice. Shush Taouk is so tender and tasty. I talked to the chef and he is super nice! We will regular visit this place."}
{"text":"Fun little underground place to eat.  We had a great time trying out a few of their unique dishes and everything was delicious!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I were wandering around downtown, and after checking out what was nearby we picked Garage Beirut.   After poking my head around a few curtains to make sure I was going into the correct place, the friendly waitress welcomed us in.    It's a fairly small space, but gives it a cozy feel.  You can see the chef working hard at the grill in the back.     They're not incredibly fast.  However, it seems to be because they're making everything to order and not just turning out mass produced food that's not fresh.  For the two of us, we ordered WAY too much food for lunch.  At the same time, we managed to eat it all because it was REALLY good and flavorful.  We had Taboule, hummus lahme, shish taouk, samboussik lahme, and French fries.    It was really great, and I if I'm ever nearby again, I'll definitely keep it in mind."}
{"text":"Reminded me of my time in Kuwait eating at some Best Lebanese food @ Ras Salmiya'h!super nostalgic #nostalgicattack"}
{"text":"I totally liked this place. Neat menu! I got a cold mezz ( baba ghanoush ) and a hot mezz. The cold mezz was really good for vegetarian. Hot mezz was again eggplant was okay. :) :) I liked the place as well"}
{"text":"Great service and great food. We were a large group and got a mix of mezze plates to share. I forget the proper names of the dishes, but highly recommend the pastry cheese stiicks and the pancake style desserts at the end!"}
{"text":"Had maybe one of the best server experiences EVER. She was attentive, friendly, and she explained different portions of the menu and made sure we made informed choices.  Wow, amazing. The food was flavourful as well but definitely seasoned by the service which was top notch."}
{"text":"Situated just off the major streets with all the other restaurants Garage Beirut tucked away in a souterrain is a true hidden gem. Excellent Middle Eastern food."}
{"text":"The family i married into is mostly Lebanese. So needless to say they know their Lebanese food. Their go to place in the city is Garage Beirut. Last summer I went to Beirut for the first time and had the traditional style meal and its very very close to Garage Beirut.   What I would say is you really need to know what to order in Garage Beirut. Here is what my fiance's family orders every time we go: Fattouche Salad, Hummus Lahme (this is to die for), Rikakat bil Jebneh (cheese rolls), and the Mixed Grill, if you are new to this type of cuisine and open minded end with the Kenafe!"}
{"text":"The staff at Garage Beirut were really accommodating to our large party and the food was plentiful and great!  While this place is small, I came over here with a little more than 15 people and they were able to shift a couple tables to seat us.  With a large group of us, waitress suggested we get a menu sampling option where we would get and share various suggested platters on their menu.  For around $27, we were all satisfied and full. The platters started with your typical appetizer platters that included salad, cheese rolls, and baba ghanouj which were great.  One of my favorite appetizers I had here was their potatoes, as they seasoned them in a way that made it taste great!  As for some of the main, meaty dishes, they were all solid choices and good.  The dishes were flavorful and not dry.  The chef made us a mixed grill platter and Lebanese meat platter with meats such as chicken and lamb and we were also given spicy sausages that were great.  Overall, we all came in here unsure what we wanted to order and we let our meal be determined by the chef with no dietary restrictions.  The chef pulled through here and created a balanced meal that everyone enjoyed!  The restaurant is really small though but does have seating outside.  We were fortunate that it was not too busy when we went and they were able to combine most of their tables inside to accommodate our large party."}
{"text":"the place is cozy and peaceful , the service was great and the food was great one of the greatest Lebanese places in Montreal."}
{"text":"Got into town last night and wanted something close by. We hit up this place and it was really good. We shared 3 small plates and each had a couple skewers of meat. I had the shish taouk chili and it was probably one of the best pieces of chicken I've ever had. Absolutely would recommend this place. Beer selection was 2 beers, so that could be better, but it didn't take away from the dinner."}
{"text":"Tiny restaurant, and you have to go down a couple of steps, so it does feel like a garage/basement, which was perfect for winter in MTL, I'm not sure what the atmosphere would be like in the summer months. The food was solid"}
{"text":"My favourite lebanese restaurant in town! Always delicious  food and amazing service!"}
{"text":"We went there because of the yelp reviews and we were disappointed. For the entree, we had hummus with lamb, baba ghanouj and finally the famous and very recommended fattoush Salad. Very dispointing, some lettuce, cumcumber, tomatoes, grilled pita and a sweet and salty sauce. Very simple, not that tasty. The hummus and baba ghanouj were good. It nothing out of the ordinary. I've tried better in the past.  For the main dish, we had Shish Taouk. Tough the meat is tender and good, the portion of the plate for the price are ridiculously small. Just some few Shish Taouk meat with some garlic sauce... no nothing else.   And to top it up all, we had to wait between the entree (salad, hummus and baba ghanouj) and the Shish Taouk, close to 40 min. I want to specify that we were the only customers ordering at the time, all the others were paying or leaving. And the kitchen had about 4 people working there.   Finally, I would not recommend!"}
{"text":"This page says they are open until 10pm.  We walked there in freezing weather at 9pm  When we walked in they said they were closing.  I asked them if they were open until 10 and they told me they were but did not want to seat anymore people because it was 9.   We would have been in and out long before they \"closed\"   Place seemed lame anyways."}
