{"text":"I have been to the Pfanntastic Pannenkoek Haus several times and enjoyed it every time.  The food is great, the service rushed, efficient and friendly.  The coffee strong. The ginger snaps a charming addition!
The only difficulty is the line-up especially on the week-end.  They are not open Monday but otherwise go during the week."}
{"text":"These kind of Dutch pancakes are really delicious.  They look huge ad they cover the size of an extra large pizza on your plate but they are almost as thin as a crepe; not quite though.  I first tried mine in the sunny Okanagan BC and got hooked. .haven't strayed from my favorite apple chunks/slices cinnamon and sugar. . Its just so delicious why change?  Lol and if you like sweet molasses that is what their dutch syrup tastes like called STROOP . .yum. . My husband prefers a savory taste so tried ones with eggs etc. Always happy.  One warning when a place is great they're going to be popular especially families for brunch and after church crowds.  Its quite tight seating but the food is what we come for.  Expect a wait at the door to sit but people don't linger long so it's not bad."}
{"text":"Decided to go here for late brunch on Sat after the Farmer's Market. We have dietary restrictions so we only had the vegetarian and sweet pancakes. 

And the place didn't disappoint, we ordered a five cheese pancake and a blueberry pancake. Service was courteous and fast. 

The pancakes are good, they look like thin pizzas but deceptively filling. Props goes to the five cheese, melts in your mouth! The blueberry after was excellent too.

Plus point; it was our daughter's birthday so our waiter gave her a birthday sundae for free which was very nice of her. Would definitely come again!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! Excellent friendly service and charming atmosphere. Plan to arrive right at 9 to avoid waiting in line, but if you do have to wait, it will be well worth it. We tried both sweet and savory pancakes and an omelet- all fabulous. If you like strong coffee, you won't be disappointed.  Very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"We have been coming here weekly since my kids were students at the local high school and they introduced me to it.  I love this place and if I could give it 10 stars I would.  

The negatives?  If you could call them that.  It can be hard to find if you don't live in the neighbourhood.  The decor is nothing fancy.  It's BUSY on the weekends, if you can get to it on a weekday all the better but not on Monday or Tuesday as they are closed.  The service can seem a bit rushed, they are busy and like to keep things moving.  Service is always friendly though.

The positives?  The food, so good!  I always get a sweet and my dining partners always get a savoury.  They are all delicious and come out fast.  Don't be afraid of trying the monthly special, they only use fresh seasonal fruit when it's a sweet special.  If you order a hot beverage you get a cookie that is delicious and great for dipping.  What can I say, it's all good just try it.

If you get a chance look at some of the cookies for sale.  There is one that looks like little waffles but be warned, they are addictive!"}
{"text":"I've been there twice now for brunch. My favourite is the shredded potato, onion, bacon and cheese rosti.  It is perfectly crispy on the outside. I like mine with a little hot sauce along with the sour cream.  As an added bonus,  the portions are HUGE. This now my favourite go-to place for brunch. As much as I like Diner Deluxe, at least the line ups aren't as long here. I like the variety they have here.  If you want authentic pannenkoek this is the place to go. I know there's another place in Calgary in the south (De Dutch). I looked at their menu online and they seem more of a chain restaurant and their pannenkoek don't seem to be as authentic as Pfanntastic's. Pfanntastic is family owned and definitely the real thing. I even like the fact that they serve their coffee with the little dutch spice cookies."}
{"text":"Go at off hours so you can actually get in but when you do you won't be disappointed.  Great service, endless coffee that is pretty good but most importantly great food!"}
{"text":"5 stars for unique, tasty, and customizable savoury offerings. Imagine a pizza place that uses crepe batter as the crust and you'll start to get an idea of what pannenkoeks are all about. The thin 12+ inch crepes will fill one person quite handily, and loaded ones are in the very affordable $12 range. Following in classic Dutch tradition, the \"toppings\" here (actually embedded in the batter) are mostly salty mild meats, cheeses, potatoes and various veg. 

Popular combos are listed on the menu, or you can build your own. For the spice lovers, Indonesian hot sauces are available to jazz it up. Sweet pancakes, including liquored up ones, are available for dessert (or brunch I suppose). Assorted packaged Dutch sweets are available at the till, along with licorice (sweet, salty or double salt) instead of the obligatory mints. Service was good, and fairly quick considering the place was packed at lunch on a Friday. 

Overall great stuff. Consider taking your date for a \"Dutch Treat\", even if you aren't a cheapskate!"}
{"text":"The pancakes were great. I'm a big fan of having the choice between savoury and sweet. 

 Not so into the decor. I don't even think my grandmother would be into it. 

Drive to only type of location"}
{"text":"As I pulled into the parking lot for a planned Sunday brunch, I wondered why there were so many people hanging around their cars chatting. Or were they waiting for the yoga place next door? Nope!!! They were all waiting for a table at the Pfantastic Pannenkoek house. So I joined the queue and waited and prayed that the pancakes would be worth it.

They were. I ordered the Mediterranean which is a savoury pancake with chicken, olives, spinach, feta cheese, tomatoes and onions. (The tomatoes and onions come raw). It was good as was the apple and bacon pancakes my kids had. I also ordered tea which came with a spicy cookie that I loved so much, I bought the whole box.

Service was ok considering how busy they were - all the tables were full for the 1+ hour I spent there waiting and eating.

Bonus points for being family friendly and having very clean fisher price booster chairs

As much as I enjoyed the pancakes, I may never be a regular here because of the wait times.

Edited to add: I came here a second time (midweek 1pm) and the service was still excruciatingly slow. The pain of the wait is not worth it and takes a star off this review."}
{"text":"I have no idea what is going on with this place.  I tried to go here several years ago when I was last in Calgary.  Traveling to and fro on my bike since my GPS didn't know that the place was on a back street and traffic was terrible.  Finally arriving only to find the parking lot empty, and a sign on the door that the place was closed because the owners were on vacation.

This morning, during my second time in Calgary, I was determined to meet up with the golden goodness I had read and dreamt about.  I loaded up the old folks and jumped in the car.  Found PPH on my GPS and told it to go!  Only one U-turn and one missed turn later I found myself again pulling into the PPH parking lot - and found the loot empty AGAIN!  No word of why on the door, in fact all of the window shades were pulled and you couldn't see into the place.  As far as I could determine, it was closed up and out of business.

Checked the web-site again this evening, and it's still up with no indication of closure, so I DON\"T KNOW?!?!?!?  Is it open and just never really \"open\"?  Or is it permanently Out To Lunch?  Somebody local needs to post definitively one way or the other."}
{"text":"The phood was phantastic, service was ok but the waiter spilled my coffee and forgot my utensils when i ordered another dish!"}
{"text":"Love this little place!!  The Dutch pancakes are awesome!  The toppings are delicious & so generous!  The savory potato pancakes are seriously the kind of thing you dream about if you are a potato lover like me!  This is an old school Calgary favorite & you'll know why when you eat there!"}
{"text":"It's a bit of a drive and always a bit of a wait so we only go a couple of times a year but I'm always glad when we do. The food is great (so many choices!), the service is friendly and the prices are reasonable. Since it can be difficult to choose between the savoury (such as my fave with shredded potato, bacon and onion) and the sweet (like banana and chocolate) take a page from our playbook and order both and share with your friend!"}
{"text":"I'm surprised by all the love this place gets!

I had a meeting nearby the other day, so I decided to stop here for a weekday lunch.  I arrived at 11:50 and found the restaurant about half full.  I was by myself, and I felt like the whole time I was there they were trying to rush me out.  I did notice that other tables were also \"processed\" (I wouldn't even use the word \"served\") extremely quickly, so it's not necessarily discrimination against odd numbers of diners, but it just wasn't that enjoyable.  While there was an occasional group or two waiting at the door during my meal it was always because a free table had not yet been cleaned, NOT because there were no free tables.  

As I sat down the server asked if I wanted coffee.  I asked for a minute to check the menu and felt like I'd disappointed her by not just having coffee.  Noticing nothing especially \"Dutch\" on the beverage menu I did go for coffee; it arrived about thirty seconds later with a request for my food order.  I NEED MORE TIME!  After skimming the menu I chose a potato-onion-cheese pancake, which arrived at my table less than five minutes later.  While it was good, and certainly wide in diameter, I didn't find the pancake on its own particularly filling.  I expected to be hungry two hours later, and I was.  

I left a pretty big tip because I knew I was occupying a table that might have otherwise seated two paying customers, and the server seemed quite taken aback.  The politeness that she showed at that time would have been appreciated from the moment I walked in.  Rather than treat customers brusquely I would encourage this restaurant to accept its popularity and embrace the line (a la Coras), rather than possibly drive people away."}
{"text":"I had never tried this place, but heard great things about it. When we got there it was quite small and full with a line outside. The wait looked long but was only about 20 minutes. Totally worth it.
We had some great thin pancakes with apple and bacon. The flavour was quite nice, although I thought the saltiness was a bit too much for me. 
Service was great and the food came out fast. I will go again but try something sweet instead of savoury."}
{"text":"I can wholeheartedly say I am a fan of Pfanntastic Pannenkoek Haus. I have been there twice now, and every time I go, it's super busy. That is always a good sign! I have been to Amsterdam and had the real deal with traditional Dutch pannenkoek. But I can say that this joint definitely rivals the ones I had in Amsterdam! 

The interior is a bit dated, but there is a Dutch charm to it that I actually like. The rustic feel of the place just adds to the theme I think. My favorite is the Cinnamon Roll with Apples. It literally tastes like a cinnamon bun, which is a win win for me. The addition of the baked apples was perfect, as it added crunch to all the soft textures. I also tried the pannenkoek with blueberries and ice cream. If you want a decadent treat, that is the one to get. Definitely meant for one with a sweet tooth! The closest one to a traditional Dutch pannenkoek is their Black Forest, which literally is the works. It has cherries, ice cream, whip cream, you name it! That one is a great treat too. I like to have mine to myself (yep I'm not always keen on sharing when it comes to food I really like haha), but I enjoy when I am with someone that gets a savory pannenkoek, so we can share and enjoy both sweet and savory!

If you haven't been here yet, GO. Seriously, you won't regret your decision. Yes the wait can be long sometimes, but it is worth it. Trust me!"}
{"text":"We try to go here as often as we can! Let me start by saying,  these are not pancakes like you would think.  They're crispy thin crepes with whatever you want.  I always get potato onion bacon and cheese and it's to die for.  I highly recommend you order a warm bun to start. It's a pretzel bun that comes with butter.  You won't be disappointed! If you show up around  11 or 12 on the weekends be prepared for a 45 minute wait at least but it is worth it! If you go around  1 you usually don't have to wait long or at all! Great place!"}
{"text":"Absolutely Awesome!  I've gone back several times now just for breakfast or brunch, and this place never disappoints!  Not your typical convential \"pancakes\", but authentic Dutch style, from Sweet to Savory!  You can expect your \"Pannenkoek\" to be 12\" in diameter, rolled out thin with most of the ingredients baked right into the batter.

My favorite by far is the Herb Butter, but the NEW SEAFOOD Pannekoek with cocktail sauce is probably my new favorite!!!  An absolute must, but expect line ups as this place is busy busy busy!!!!"}
{"text":"Went to the Pannenkoek Haus for Sunday brunch today and it was lined up out the door. I squeezed inside and asked the very cheery waitress about the wait, and although she said an hour it was actually about 40 minutes. Conveniently, while you are waiting you can leave your phone number and go and they'll I've you a call when your table is ready. 

Soon after my family and I were seated a nice waiter showed up and took our drink orders. The little ginger snap biscuit served with the coffee was a cute touch. We then opened up our menus and picked two savory pancakes and one sweet & savory pancake from the huge selection. Mine was a savory potato, onion, bacon, and cheese pancake with sour cream on the side. Although the wait for it was on the long side it did not disappoint. It was so filling I had to pack some up for later. 

To end the meal my family shared the special Tortoise pancake with icing sugar, maple roasted pecans, and chocolate and butterscotch sauce. It is a real treat at a good price, especially if you split it.

As for the atmosphere, it was very quaint and homey - a kids book shelf, trinkets on the walls....it was all quite comforting.

Overall, if you want a delicious Dutch brunch/dessert and have some time to spare, come to The Pfanntastic Pannenkoek Haus. It's truly Pfabulous!"}
{"text":"Ordered the herb butter, my wife had chicken and kids had a dessert one. Herb butter only had a teaspoon of rock frozen butter, salad was old, dry and brown and pancake had no taste. 

Very overpriced for what it is. Service wasn't bad but average. Place had good decorations but looks a bit used, like it needs a remodel.

The idea is great but execution is bad, it seemed the pancakes were dry, a bit cold and tasteless. I think in terms of food a crepe stand is a lot better than this."}
{"text":"It's all in the name.  Pfanntastic is fantastic!

Having eaten Pannenkoek in Amsterdam for a week straight I can say Pfanntastic is the real thing.  If you know what you're getting into you'll love it.  If you're unfamiliar with dutch style pancakes then you're in for a treat (I suggest sweet & savory).  

The atmosphere is that of a family run establishment with consistent staff, toys for the kids and a friendly no nonsense approach to your visit (no 2 people in the 6 person booth on the weekend).  

A new approach I've taken to dining at Pfanntastic is to have pannenkoek for the meal and a sweet pannenkoek as desert.  It's the only way to go!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here about 2-3 times now and each visit has left me a very satisfied customer. The restaurant is beautifully decorated and gives off a very warm energy. I know a few friends who have or are still working there and they think very fondly of it.

The food is delicious, the service is fantastic, and the restaurant is easily accessible for any and all customers. I would highly recommend this restaurant to families and larger groups. I highly recommend ordering a soup with your meal as the soup is absolutely delightful. 

Keep in mind that if you don't have a very large appetite you may want to consider coming here when you are looking for something a little more filling, as the pancakes are quite large."}
{"text":"What can I say? It is a remarkably tasty experience
The food is unique, but delicious.
Weather it be a crepe, omelette or pannenkoek (I've had all three many times), they are all cooked to perfection.
I also love the coffee with the cookie they bring out (it's like a ginger-tasting cookie)"}
{"text":"The name alone is a mouthful, so I took it as an indication that food would put me in the same state.

I've heard rave reviews about this place so when I finally found myself in the South end of the city, my sister and I headed here for dinner. After reading over all the drool worthy options, we went the savoury potato, onion, bacon and cheese pannenkoek to share. Out rolls this GIANT crepe like concoction and I was ready to indulge. After smearing some sour cream on, I took my first bite and was brought straight to heaven. Crispy shredded potatoes were accompanied with sautéed onions and bacon that was smothered in melted cheese - yaaaaaaaaaaaaaassss

I'm glad they have a take out option, because after stuffing ourselves I still wanted to try dessert. We got the cinnamon roll to go (apples and brown sugar dusted with cinnamon and a cream cheese filling), and I was treated with the smell of freshly baked cinnamon buns in my car that lingered for a few days. (It tasted as good as it smelled if you were wondering)

I will keep this place in mind next time I'm in the South and schedule to make a pit stop because it really is pfanntastic."}
{"text":"We just moved to North Glenmore and walked here for brunch. We had AMAZING service and the food was unbelievable. Will definitely become a regular ."}
{"text":"Not knowing we were going for breakfast I bought a coffee 10 min before arriving at this place. The grumpy old guy at the front told me I couldn't bring in my coffee. Then rolled his eyes at me when I explained I just bought it. Then the server told me the same thing and made me pour it into a teeny tiny coffee mug , and threw out the other half of my coffee. Ok sure no big deal , stupid policy but whatever right ? Then we get the bill and they charged me for a coffee !!!"}
{"text":"Awsome food. Little simple diner, perfect for a nice afternoon. I had the best pancake i have ever had here, i know  that is a bold statement but wow."}
{"text":"This family owned restaraunt serves up delishious authentic Dutch pankakes.  There are about 40 different ones to choose from, organized into \"savory\", \"sweet\" and \"savory&sweet\" sections.  The shredded potato bacon onion cheese is my favorite and it comes with a little bowl of sour cream to spread on top.  You can also put stroop on top (imported Dutch \"syrup\" which is really thick and sweet).  There is nearly always a line up out the door, so you will have to wait to be seated - but don't worry because tables are quickly and efficiently turned over.  The service is just ok and the decor is kinda cafeteria-like, but this is easily overlooked once you get a taste of these pankakes! Yum!"}
{"text":"A unique experience, amazing food, and great customer service. Although the layout and interior design are cluttered in my opinion.

This place is great for sharing if you are ordering their specialty Pannenkoek. It is a 12-inch diameter crepe with any fillings to choose from. We ordered 3 Pannenkoek which are:

*Bacon, smoked sausage, and egg
*Potato, cheese, and bacon
*Apple and bacon

All of which is great, it was light, flavorful and just the right amount of fill in my tummy. I highly recommend the potato, cheese, and bacon as our waitress also recommended.

Overall, I would come back to try out other fillings and do order coffee as you get a nice dutch biscuit."}
{"text":"We waited an hour to be seated at 11am on a Saturday morning (not sure if it being a long weekend had anything to do with the wait, or not). Once we were seated our order was taken within a short time. Three of four of us had a savory pancake, one had a sweet one with ice cream. We all loved this place though I was the only one who could finish it all. The pancakes are huge but thin. There is a large selection and you can also build your own with a choice of ingredients. Our experience was 5 star but I voted 4 due to the excessive wait. I was, however, happy we waited. Worth it if you have the time."}
{"text":"This place is Pfanntastic!!!!  This is our \"go to\" place for brunch.  You must get there before 10 am on weekends or you will most likely have to wait.  I highly recommend going with a friend & getting the potato, cheese, bacon & onion to share and then sharing the apple cinnamon for desert.  The portions are huge and I find that eating a whole pannenkoek of any one type is too much.  Definitely try the savoury pannenkoek with both stroop (the syrup on the table in a yellow bottle).  It seems wrong but it's not.  YUM!

The service is always fast and efficient and this restaurant is family friendly."}
{"text":"Tried this for the first time, had to wait a bit for about 10 mins since it's Sunday and they close earlier, I ordered the cinnamon sugar pancake since I wanted a less sweet and light one that day, the drizzle of cream cheese is a good addition, I did find the brown sugar too much tho but it's just me, despite the thinner texture of the pancake, I like it. Staff were friendly and attentive so it's a nice experience."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in Calgary. Been there at least 50 times and keep going back . The food is delicious and I consider the owner a friend . Great staff and I feel at home there . I am Dutch and I get a little taste of home when I am there. It's a must try !!!"}
{"text":"Potentially THE best pancake house in Calgary. 

WHY had I never been here before?!?!?!? 

The pancake flavours are categorized in one of two categories: Savoury or Sweet. Obviously, the sweet category had all my attention. I ended up getting a chocolate-banana pancake and it took my taste buds on a VIP trip straight to heaven. 

I am SO pleased to have discovered this place. Heaven on a plate."}
{"text":"First I'd like to start by saying friendly staff and good service. Food not so great, I think this place is overrated. We ordered a variety: sweet and savory and both were ok. The savory were lacking in flavour and \"dry\". This will be our first and last breakfast here. Nice touch with the biscuit with the coffee and tea."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Always great food and prompt service. Come hungry though.. The portions are enormous"}
{"text":"Food is great. Need more vegan options. Service is stern and interrupts your meal many times. 
Overall a good experience."}
{"text":"I remember hearing about this place, and immediately calling my Dutch friend. \"Is this place pretty good?\" I'd asked. 

\"How have you not been there? It's awesome!\" was his reply.

So, on his recommendation and waking up one morning craving pancakes, we decided to go try it out. There was a bit of a lineup at the door, but it wasn't outside. There ended up being just a couple tables ahead of us. I guess we timed it just right, cause I've heard the lineups can get pretty bad there.

I had a blueberry pannenkoek with whipped cream, and there was no way I could get through it! It was HUGE - easily the size of a dinner plate, and was covered with a blueberry sauce and three massive dollops of whipping cream. I definitely had leftovers, and they were still quite tasty even the next day.

It is so worth a bit of a wait - come hungry!"}
{"text":"A group of us went for pancakes yesterday after the race.  The wait time was ridiculously long...I think we waited for 45 minutes or more.  It looks like they only have three tables that fit large group of people (6 to 8 people), hence the long wait for us.  But in general, this restaurant is quite a busy place.  

I love how they have sweet, savory and sweet&savory options for the pancakes.  Dutch pancakes are not like the traditional small fluffy pancakes, they are bigger (like the size of a small/medium pizza) and flat. Their pancakes are delicious.  However, I found their service is so-so.  The waitress put down the wrong order for my friends, which my friends didn't mind and didn't send it back.  But they still charged us for their mistakes.  I mean, it was only a couple bucks more, but still.  And I believe one of my friends ordered coffee which never came but of course, they still charged us for it.  It was just a bit chaotic I found.  Put service aside, their pancakes are good and I do think it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"We arrived and checked in. There was a long line and we expected a wait. However once we were inside it was very clear they were focused on the large groups. With a quick count of the current log sheet 45% of the customers were either groups of 2 or 3. When I checked in with the lady at the front and noted a single table was sitting for about 10 minutes she stated it was be saved for a large group. A while later they moved the table to Accommodate a large group and bypassed several couples or groups of three. The only way I would ever go back is to say I had a group of 6-8. Short of that you will get very frustrated by the lack of organization. When I asked to speak to the manager I was told they don't have one which may explain a lot! 

The food was decent. But service horrible!"}
{"text":"It took a while to get a table, but at least they don't build your hopes up. The maître d was honest enough to tell us that we had to wait 30min. 

Was expecting a better tasting coffee! And the OJ is served in plastic bottles, so don't expect freshly squeezed juice. 

Food was pretty decent. The mushroom omelette was really good. The Thai Pannenkoek was an interesting twist on a crepe. 

I wouldn't go back here if I had to wait more than 5min to get a table.

{"text":"I can eat about as little at Pfanntastic Pannenkoek Haus as I can pronounce their name. I had always been curious about this place, as it's one of the first things you see when making the merge from Glenmore to Crowchild, but I put it off because I immediately dismissed it as just another carb-y-bacon-y breakfastravaganza that I would have to skip over. However, when Julia M. organized her first-ever UYE here, how could I say no? I saw that they had a vegan-friendly soup there, and signed up. 

For bacon lovers, nearly every single one of their savory (and even some of the sweet) Pannenkoeks comes with bacon. It's the first ingredient on the list of almost all the savory offerings, and the one where it's not; it's the third ingredient! They're not like thick, fluffy North American buttermilk pancakes where they're stacked on the plate and everything else is piled around it. And it's not like Ethiopian Injera, where the food is placed in neat little piles in the center of it and you tear off pieces to scoop up with the food. 

No, Pannenkoeks are almost crepe-thin, the ingredients are mixed right in to the batter and at PPH, they're the size of a large pizza. Most at our table cut it in to strips, rolled them up and ate them with a fork. There were different dipping sauces available like cream cheese, Nutella, and curiously, Ketjap Manis (Indonesian soy sauce). I thought it was peculiar, but according to Google, you can find Ketjap Manis in many Dutch homes - neat! They also had bottles of Maggi at the table, which was something else I thought was strictly Asian... but turns out \"Maggi\" is the name of the Swedish founder (insert \"The More You Know\" rainbow here).

The sweet Pannenkoeks were basically the Pannenkoek version of a pie. They have ones with cinnamon and apples, lemon and brown sugar, banana and coconut - the specialty ones were served with ice cream. One member of our group decided to undo about six month's worth of sit-ups by ordering both a sweet and savory Pannenkoek. While the effort was noble, I saw it unraveling hopelessly as he tried to pawn off the remaining bites on the rest of our table whom, were all ready for naps and Little House on the Prairie marathons.

Since I could have none of these things, I stuck with the soup I had seen on the menu prior to my visit. The Huis Van Oranjesoep (The House of Orange Soup). Butternutty, fragrant and spicy; it was thick, hearty and not cloyingly sweet like many puréed Butternut Squash soups. I had it with a small house salad, and... I shudder to think how big a full-sized salad would have been. The small size was prettily arranged in a 12\" dinner bowl and served with their housemade vinaigrette. So while I could not partake in Pannenkoek Happiness, my belly was just as cozy and warm as everyone else's. And full of Black Currant (Cassis) soda! I love that they serve Black Currant soda here, as it was pretty much all I drank at one point, when I lived across the street from Market Mall and would regularly clean out the British Store's supply of Ribena. The brand they serve at PPH is Hero, and it's just as tasty as Ribena.

Service here was warm, friendly, and generous. Behind our table, there were many Dutch goods to purchase, even souvenirs like wooden shoe keychains that you could probably use to BS your way through a first date by pretending that you had been to Amsterdam, as long as you didn't have to describe anything in great detail. 

I like you, PPH. If I could have more than two things on your menu, I would like you even more :)."}
{"text":"Been here twice - one year ago, before moving to YYC, and now. The food quality and the service were still the same: excellent. It's a hidden gem for sure. Coffee and pancakes were delicious (ordered the Mediterranean)."}

(1- Terrible; 3- decent; 5- Fantastic)

My bf and I decided to finally check this place out after hearing rave reviews of how good the pancakes were. Unlike your typical American pancake that are thick and heavy, Pannenkoek House serves authentic Dutch pancakes which are crepe-like. As you probably already read, they serve savory, sweet, savory and sweet, and house special pancakes that range from $10-$12 depending on what you get.

We went on an early Saturday morning at around 10:30am and there wasn't too big of a line unless you were a large group where you would have to wait for a little while longer. If you do go, I suggest getting there a bit early to avoid lineups. The decor is very outdated and reminds me of a small rundown truck stop cafe you would see in the movies. Definitely needs a makeover. There are a couple booths tucked away and tables scattered around, and the cash register counter is littered with Dutch goodies such as syrup and cookies that you can purchase. The service was alright;  the servers were very casual and our food came out in a very reasonable time despite a full house.

We started off with a cup of house made mushroom soup which according to my bf tasted like something from out of a can. Unlike your typical white, creamy mushroom soup, Pannenkoek's was more beef/chicken broth based. It was tad too sweet which led to an unbalanced flavour but I still enjoyed it.

My bf ordered a savory pancake with steak, shredded potatoes and onions while I had the warm Saskatoon berries with a sprinkle of icing sugar. The pancakes are huge (about 12 inches or so), and are nice and light, fluffy, and not too sweet on its own. It goes great with Dutch syrup (stroop) that's found in a yellow bottle on the table. I thought the fruit compote on top of my pancake was too sweet and it became too overwhelming halfway through that I had to scrape some of it off; It completely ruined the pancake for me. My bf's pancake was stuffed with potatoes, steak and onions, but it was only mediocre and tasted like a giant thin omelet. 

Overall, it's worth a visit if you haven't already gone to try something new. The pancakes were mediocre... I was expecting knock my socks off good and it came up a little short. If you do go, I suggest going with someone else or with a couple of friends so you can try a variety of pancakes on the menu; you can only eat so much of the same thing."}
{"text":"Even though the pannenkoek haus is mere kilometres from my school, I'd only ventured out to it recently, but boy, was it worth it. Although you might have to wait to get in, you'll be glad you did, it has a charming atmosphere and incredible food. I had one of their savoury crepes and it was delicious, strongly recommended."}
{"text":"It smelled good from the parking lot. There was a bit of a line up but we put my name on the list. Delicious & filling!"}
{"text":"Friendly and prompt service, free coffee refills with purchase of a meal which was awesome! 

Portion sizes are deceptively huge, you'll definitely leave full. My husband and I split 2 savoury pannenkoek and it was perfect  

One of us might have been a touch hungover and it set him just right! 

Great for all ages, there was a mom with two girls sitting by us, a few elderly people, and a couple families. We'll definitely be coming back with more people as soon as possible!"}
{"text":"I really love this place but not their limited hours. I have tried to go several times to only find them closed when they had previously been open at the same time. If you do find them open, you will love their pannenkoeks.

For the uninitiated, the pannenkoek is a Dutch unrolled crepe, so to speak, with savoury or sweet goodies baked in/on it. When you first see it, even though it fills an entire plate, it is quite thin and you really don't think it will be filling enough. Wrong. My husband and I always say that we will order a sweet one to split after we finish our savoury pannenkoek but we have always been too full. 

Service is efficient and very friendly. This restaurant has been there for a lot of years and looks that way. I think because of their limited hours they are typically fairly busy. This really is my favourite breakfast-for-dinner place."}
{"text":"This Haus of Pfanntastic Pann-cakes deserves it's five stars. At least, it deserve one for every amazing pancake I've had at this place. Which only makes four so that means I'll have to come back for at least one more!

Their servers are great, so lively and engaging, obvious in the relaxed environment they're allowed to be themselves in. That really counts and really stands out even against chain restos that TRAIN robots to follow protocols. No need for standardized pieces of flair!

Julia was great enough to put on a UYE for this pancake house. But I have to be honest, I couldn't wait and ended up trying it a month before.

There are two ways to enjoy a pancake here. A salty and savoury course or as a sweet and savoury dessert. On both visits I was lucky to have both. The first time I was sharing with someone and the second I decided to bring the MAN to the party and ordered two for myself.

So here's a breakdown of each pancakes I've tried.

Ham, prei en kaas-Bacon, Leeks, and Cheese. Such a succulent combo. Leeks and cheese complimented each other so well. Of course, I wouldn't treat the bacon as a third wheel. A menage a trois of goodness.

Rosti, ui, spek en kaas- Cheese, Bacon and Potato. If whoppers were to Burger King and Bic Mac to McDinks, this is dish everyone should try at Pannekoek. It's rich, salty, and savoury with each bite. So much flavor with every thin bite I needed two servings of sour cream.

Kaneel rol -Cinnamon roll. Such a simple dessert dish but complex in it's fixins of sugar, butter, cinnamon, and baked apples. Yep I got the apples because it's what MEN do. Best way to eat it? slice off little triangle pieces and roll it up.

Zwarte Woud- Black Forest. If I had to have a romantic obsession with anything I've tried at Pannekoek, this would be it. Although they didn't have the chocolate sauce handy when I came, they complimented it with a hefty serving of nutella instead. Wow, I spent the afternoon hiking in sugary bliss. Share this with diabetic friends and you'll be sure to have 90% of this dish to yourself!

Overall I would say...what do I need an overall statement for? People who don't read? Forget that noise, I'm getting me some Pannenkoek!"}
{"text":"Not only would my Dutch mother in law be so proud I went here, I couldn't imagine never going back! Pannenkoek, Dutch pancakes, are incredible! The menu here has so many combinations of deliciousness, it's nearly impossible to pick one! Sweet? There's options. Savory? Yup, options there too. Sweet AND Savory? They got it! Pretty much whatever concoction you can think of throwing into a light thin crepe-style pancake, have at it! You will not be disappointed! 
I had the potato, bacon, onion and cheese pannenkoek, and my two lovely friends decided on the apple cinnamon. At the table, there was nothing but constant \"oh em gee's\" of how delicious our food was. The coffee was hot and fresh, and even came with a dutch cookie for dipping. Tastes similar to gingerbread. Mmmmm.
Of course there's no reservations for breakfast on the weekends, but if you're patient enough to wait (which wasn't long at all) you will be beyond glad you did. You may have to roll yourself outside and undo a button or two... Sheer bliss to stuff your face with deliciousness, and for a great price!"}
{"text":"Right now I need something to rave about, and Pfanntastic Pannenkoek Haus TOTALLY makes the cut.

Take the Dutch awesomeness that is the business name, and let it ring out across the entire store. Until PPH I had only ever had the Mitch Hedberg definition of pancakes - \"all exciting at first, but then by the end you're f*ckin' sick of em.\"  But then WHAMMY! (Champ Kind reference,) that definition just got turned right upside down. I was stuffed to the brim with Pannenkoek goodness and begging for more!

Here's the deal:

I went with one of the sweet/savoury combos, which for one, ALL have BACON on them. As science has proved, bacon is, in fact, better than True Love and every single sweet/savoury pannenkoek plate of awesome comes loaded with this delectable  piggy goodness. 

Bacon, Apple and Cheese is what I went with and even though it's the only one I've ever tried, I'm never looking back. If Apple x Cheese = Yes, and Bacon x Cheese = Hell yes, then we can derive that Bacon x Cheese x Apple... I have no idea. I already quoted science, I don't have enough left in me to mathematically prove why this angelic  pancake monstrousity is SO good... but it is.

It's thin, it's flavourful, and it's bigger than my biggest dinner plate. \"I can't eat all of this!!\" Take a deep breath. All you need is one bite and then you will know that you can. You can.

The restaurant is adorable, unassuming and down to earth. Its a great spot for people of all ages.  A cool, quirky, brunch date spot for couples, a good place to bring the kids and plenty of seniors have made this their pancake haven. I loved the Pfanntastic Pannenkoek Haus and there's a good chance your grandmother will too."}
{"text":"Delicious! A must try restaurant! I love the Chicken Parmesan and Nutella Banana! 5 star!"}
{"text":"Had dinner with relatives on a visit to Calgary.  A real gem and apparently a very popular place.  We made reservations for four and arrived about six pm on a Thursday evening.  We were seated at a nice window table.  I have been to Europe several times but never eaten Dutch food.  What a treat!  Crepe like pancakes with toppings all the way from breakfast to pizza.  I had bacon, smoked sausage, and mushroom Pannenkoeken and the relatives had a variety of others.  The one that was voted the best was the Mediterranean which had chicken, spinach, fresh chopped tomatoes, onions and lots of cheese.  We shared a couple of desert Pannenkoeken entries which were also excellent.  Great to support a family owned place."}
{"text":"This place is a Calgary classic - locally owned and operated for as long as I can remember. The staff are friendly, and the Dutch Pancakes are amazing. I have tried about 2/3 of the menu and my favorite combination is BARC - Bacon, Apple, Raisin, Cheese.

Arrive early on a Sat or Sunday as the wait is usually an hour - a good sign! It is well worth the wait."}
{"text":"Best pancake ever!

I ordered the Kaneel Rol (cinnamon roll) and it was heaven! The coffee was average, but the biscuit that comes with it makes up for that. Be prepared to wait in line to be seated on the weekend, but it is well worth the wait."}
{"text":"I don't understand the hype. The staff was great. Very friendly and nice. Food was nothing special for me. Was kind of disappointed but I'm happy to have the experience !"}
{"text":"Tasty pancakes! With mostly 4 and 5 star ratings you should be safe checking it out. With savoury and sweet options on the menu, there should be something for everyone."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch a few weeks ago and holy smokes, that was an experience. It's definitely a popular place and was totally packed, with a lineup outside. You have to go inside and put your name on the list and then they pop outside and call your name when your table is ready. It took us about 40 mins to get seated but we were committed and I'm glad we stuck around. We'll come much earlier next time to avoid the wait but if you're not starving, it's not terrible. The food itself is super tasty. We were greedy and ordered two savoury pancakes and one sweet one to share. In retrospect, this was too much food for two people and while we persevered and came out victorious, we did end up skipping dinner that day because we were still full. The savoury cross are like a delicious cross between Korean pancakes and pizza. If you pick one with potatoes as one of the toppings (which I highly recommend), it's like also adding rosti to that mix. Super tasty. I preferred the savoury pancakes to the sweet but it's mainly because they are THAT good. Once inside, service was fast and attentive. Great atmosphere. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I've gone here a couple of times now and there have been line ups out the door. It's definitely worth the wait as they have a variety of crepe like dishes (potato, bacon and onion is delicious!) Although the restaurant is a bit dated, the atmosphere is pleasant and service is good. This is a great place to go for breakfast or dessert."}
{"text":"This is your childhood dream come true! Your pancakes with any combination of ingredients!! This is not your traditional take on pancakes - hence the unusual name of the restaurant. 

Every Calgarian needs to visit - this is a special take in pancakes unlike any other. 

Price : Very reasonable! 
Ambience : casual and family friendly 
Service: always ready to help 
Food : good food and large portion sizes. 

I'll be going back!"}
{"text":"Love love love this breakfast and lunch spot!! The pannenkoek's are unbelievably delicious and large! (Like a unrolled crepe like thing, hard to describe but a MUST TRY) So many sweet and savory options. Hands down authentic and satisfying. The cookies they give you with the coffee are delicious, I always buy a bag before leaving."}
{"text":"I stopped in here for about the second or third time on a Monday or Tuesday to figure out there are closed those days (I WILL learn one of these days....)  and realized I've never reviewed.  

One of those infamous places I had long heard about but never tried.   I believe the main issue is getting there for breakfast when it's clear across town... I probably am not interested in a 40 minute drive to wait in a long line at a delicious and popular place when I haven't eaten. Mostly this is something we stop into after an early doctors appointment that might take us to the rocky view or something.... so it's an infrequent treat for sure. 

I love everything I've tried (several savory veggie pancakes and a few sweet ones).  I think my favorites are the 5 cheese (I'm convinced they use dutch cheese which I'm in love with from my travels in the Netherlands)  and then banana nutella  (but bananas and nutella on anything makes it at least mostly awesome)

Coffee comes with a little cookie I \"assume\" I would really like.  Since I don't like coffee too much I've never ordered it.   All I can say is the cookie on my fiance's coffee sometimes gets thieved or is missing portions by the time he gets to it... I'm really not sure why that is though.

All and all it's a really great place - but it's a VERY popular one.   It seems insanely hard to get into if you're headed south on Crowchild  but GPS can get you around the community if needed.  It's much easier to access when headed north of Crowchild as it's right then on the first right after Glenmore..  

Also, just remember it's not open on Mondays or Tuesdays!"}
{"text":"This place is a Calgary must go or at least try if you're out of town.  Come early or at off peak times to avoid the long wait or order take out.  My sister lives near here so when we get a chance, we get take out.  They have both savoury and sweet options and both are fantastic.  My favorite is the potatoe and cheese, topped with some sour cream and you have a winner.  My sweet favourite is the coconut, banana and chocolate.  Nothing is overly sweet.  The crepe is unique and the texture is different than French crepes.  The portion is big so if you want variety, share and you can try different flavours.  I love the syrup they give you, it's got a unique taste to it, kind of like a lighter molasses with a sweetness.  One will usually fill you up pretty good, so come hungry and don't over order."}
{"text":"Definitely a place you gotta try at least once. Located just off crowchild trail and glenmore in a super old strip mall. First time I ate here I thought \"how is this thin crepe thing supposed to fill me up??\" But you leave stuffed!

You get super strong dark coffee with a ginger cookie to start off. The pannekoet are either savory or sweet. It's best to split with a friend. 

Busy place but they are quick with turn around. Gotta love the fresh whipped cream!!"}
{"text":"I decided to stop by here because of all the positive Yelp reviews and I'm glad I did.  This place is awesome!  It's located in a strip mall right off Crowchild and has ample parking.  The inside is cute and has so much charm.

I'm certainly not a Dutch pancake expert so I ordered their most popular Pannenkoek to try, which is the potato, bacon, onion and cheddar.  The ingredients were incorporated into the pancake itself but I understand that, with many of the sweet pancakes, the ingredients may be on top of the pancake.  Anyways, my pancake arrived the size of my plate and was thin, crepe-like and had a crispy top, with a side of sour cream.  The server informed me that the syrup on the table really complements the pancake.  I was a bit hesitant...syrup with a savoury crepe?!  But they were amazingly delicious together.  My only issue is that the crepe was really really very very salty!  And I am not shy with salt.  Perhaps it was meant to be extremely salty so that the syrup can appropriately balance it?  I'm not quite sure but I was thirsty for hours afterwards.  The saltiness is the reason why I knocked a star off.

They have some Dutch goodies by the counter which you can purchase to go.  I love stroop waffles so I bought some of those to enjoy with my morning tea.

Also, this place is family-friendly as evidenced by the booster seats and children's books available in the front so don't be shy in bringing your kids!"}
{"text":"I've been very eager to try brunch at Pfanntastic Pannenkoek Haus since I first heard and read about their sweet and authentic Dutch Pancakes. For those who don't know, Pfanntastic Pannenkoek Haus is frequently mentioned in Calgary's top breakfast place lists and is considered a must try by most Calgary foodies. They've even been featured on Global TV and the Food Network. So you can imagine my excitement when I visited this last weekend :).
 
Located just off Crowchild in the Community of North Glenmore you'll find Pfanntastic Pannenkoek Haus amongst other businesses in the Lincoln Park Shopping Centre. This location is pretty unassuming and you wouldn't expect to find a renowned Pancake Restaurant here, but it was clear we had the right place because we were greeted with a short line-up around 10:00am this last Sunday. I put our names down and despite being very busy the host was confident that he'd have us seated shortly. Sure enough within 15 minutes a table was ready to seat the 5 of us. The décor here is a bit sporadic and homier than anything else, but the Dutch element is definitely present, you'll see the cliche wooden shoes right as you enter ;). They even sell some Dutch giftware and snacks which I thought was a nice touch. Other than that though, I personally didn't think the décor was anything special and they were pretty heavy on the color blue.

The menu was much larger than I was expecting, I was expecting a focus on just sweet dessert style pannenkoekens, but they had both sweet, savoury and hybrid varieties. In fact they had over 40 pre-designed ready-to-order options and even a build-your-own option. Wow! If you're not big on pancakes they have soups, salads, omelettes, sandwiches and more. Their beverage list is quite large as well and includes a significant alcoholic drink selection as well. One thing that I thought was cool, is they include a biscuit with coffee or tea, this was delicious and added to the experience. The sauce and syrup at the table also appear to be of dutch origin. They even include some history on pannenkoekens and the restaurant history itself in the menu; it's always interesting to read about new things!

When it came to ordering we all went for the pannenkoekens! 2 of us went with the sweet varieties and the other 3 went with savoury. I honestly don't do well with large menus; I find them overwhelming and tougher to pick something from. So rather than let myself get frustrated I quickly noticed they had a \"Black Forest\" or \"Zwart Woud\" style pannenkoeken and being a big fan of black forest cake it was the obvious decision. Plus it was listed in their \"specialty\" section and is the pannenkoek featured on their menu cover and gift card, definitely seemed like the safest bet! When our order came out, mine was easily the awe of the table, it looked every bit as good as it did in the picture and slightly better in person. Featuring warm cherries, ice cream, whipped cream, Kirschwasser (cherry brandy) in a chocolate cup and chocolate sauce, how could you not be happy? I asked the server if I should pour the brandy over the pannenkoek and she said she preferred shooting it and eating the meal separate. After trying a sip it seemed like the wiser choice as I didn't want to ruin the sweet decadence of my dish :). I was happy I did because the dish was awesome without it! I loved trying parts on their own and then blending them together, it was an awesome flavour combination that shifted from heavy on the cherries to light on the whipped cream, and with the ice cream you had the shifts of warm to cold. Awesome!

The sweet pannenkoekens were easily the winners at the table, the 3 who had ordered savoury were actually a bit neutral about the whole experience, one even commented it was dry. Next time I'll have to try a savory pannenkoek for myself to make up my own opinion. Service was a bit slow to take our order and bill us, but all-in-all it was a great experience and I'll be happy to come again!"}
{"text":"Came to Calgary and a friend of mine saw this location on \"you have to eat here\".  We decided to hit it up for lunch.   I was really excited the minute we arrived (because I was hungry and because this was something I hadn't tried before).  Nothing special about the building on the outside but inside it's a different story.  It was busy (small line out the door), but there was an excellent, efficient staff running around keeping things moving.  My favorite person (other than the magician cooking my panenkok) was the guy that got us to our table.  He was very business like, yet somehow sweet at the same time.  So we sit and the menu just rocks.  They know what they do well and they stick to it.  We read through the many specialty dishes, but decide on building our own.  I must say, after seeing the delectable dishes being  pumped from the kitchen, I really was torn between a sweet or savory panenkok.  I finally decide on a savory chicken, leak, spinach and feta combination.  Then I wisely decided \"why choose? And decide to order a sweet one as a dessert (yeah, I know, its quite a bit).  When they came out it was amazing.  Loved the size (was warned that they mimicked a medium pizza when I happily replied \"I always order a large\") and they were fantastic.  Cooked very well and wonderfully thin.  They didn't overload the ingredients and the \"miner\" sauce they have at the table really went well with the savory panenkok.  I ended up finishing mine and polishing off my friends (wuss).  His was excellent as well.  I recommend getting ham if you go with savory as an ingredient, I think it goes really well.

On to the dessert round ( I only know dessert has 2 \"ss\" because as an early teacher informed me, the word has 2 \"ss\" because you always want 2 helpings!).  My friend ordered a regular icing sugar (powdered sugar) while I went for warm blueberries, whipped cream and candied maple pecans.  If this came right after my savory panenkok, I would have wolfed it down, but because I debated an waited, I was only able to get through 1/3 of it (now who's the wuss).

This place really was fun, and I would highly recommend it if your in the area. Service is quick and good as is, of course, the food."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this place with my Boyfriend. Prices are somewhat reasonable for the type of dish they serve. Our Hostess provided very nice 
service, which is a rarity in the Calgary food service industry.

(time to start tipping for ONLY GOOD SERVICE which this hostess deserved) Our money is too hard earned to give to just bad service.

On to the food: Damn near perfect! 

Bfriend had the Steak and pepper savory, I had a sweet savory combination.

We split a ceasar salad also, which was very, very good.

Well done!

{"text":"Took my family for the 1st time as we live so close by. I can't give less than 5 stars as the food was great, service was awesome, and went on a Thursday morning, I heard weekends are very busy, we loved everything. Savoury or Sweet, it's got something for everyone."}
{"text":"What a neat, homey and tasty gem! It was an amazing experience for something new and different. I wish I've known about this place earlier! These crepes are like pizza without the starchy thick bread crusts! Lots of choices of the savory and sweet options. The bacon, pepper and mushroom one was an amazing choice. The sweet mandarin crepe with ice cream and whipping cream--simply mouth watering! Oh and the chai tea! It was one of the best I've had so far. Much much much better than the Starbucks one! Totally worth trying! It was sweet like a desert but the tea was flavourful with just the right amount of cinnamon kick in it! With the creamy milk mixed in it, it was both light and rich at the same time! Our servers were also attentive and amazing. They checked on us and filled out coffee and water with just the right amount of attention but not overwhelming. The store is a family style restaurant that has definitely seen many customers over the years. Little touch up here and there would definitely brush up the overall cleanliness feel. Ie my chair was a little wobbly.... but overall, what a homey, comfortable setting! Totally will be back to try more delicious crepe!"}
{"text":"I love the Pfanntastic Pannenkoek Haus - I just don't drop by nearly as often as I should, even though it's so close!

It's true that the line up is out-of-control if you arrive after about 10am, however, there seems to be a lull around 11:30 between the breakfast and lunch crowds. Even so, expect a wait. It's a pretty small place, so especially so for large groups.

During this visit, we had to wait about 15 minutes for a drink (and food) order... I would have preferred to mull my food choice over coffee.

The food is always great. I had the cheese, onion and shredded potato while my friend had the blueberries & whipped cream. Both were well received ;)

Prices are reasonable for what brunch usually costs, and I always bring home leftovers. Those pannenkoeks are deceptively filling!

Will definitely be back.

(10/30)"}
{"text":"This is a great brunch option that hardly has any competitors in the city. The menu  is fairly traditional with most pannenkoeken done as savoury options with dessert varieties available too. No matter which option you choose, don't forget to pour on some treacle (syrup) that's provided on the table. If you have tea or coffee with your meal they serve it with a speculaas cookie.

At the counter they also carry a range of Dutch items to purchase including the more popular things like drop, stroopwaffel, hagelslag, and speculaas. Though if you just want to pick up some of these items a little cheaper just hit the Dutch Cash & Carry: https://www.yelp.ca/biz/dutch-cash-and-carry-calgary?hrid=9Hy13H6PXOKgg7pBiEfxhA&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)"}
{"text":"Great staffs, very friendly. Served tea with a piece of delicious ginger cookie, very thoughtful. 
However, food, very disappointing. Not exactly what we were hoping for. 
My family all order the pancakes. We never had pancakes like this before, and decided to give this place a try. 
We were not were happy after breakfast here. They were very greasy and very salty. 
Maybe this is the truly authentic way of preparing pancake, they were crispy, however it didn't work out for us."}
{"text":"You really can have it all!  My hubby and I choose one sweet and one savory pannecoek and split them both! It's the only way we can have room for the Nutella & strawberry one for desert!"}
{"text":"We came to Pffantastic Pannenkoek on a Saturday (11:00am) and barely had to wait for a table. Normally, this place is packed but we lucked out (Stampede season is the best season). This was my first trip even though I've passed by it many times. 

Note: no reservations on weekends (from 8:00am to 3:00pm Saturday and Sunday).

Lots of options to choose from but it's mainly savoury and sweet pannenkoek along with a few soups, salads, omelettes and open faced sandwiches. Service is bustling but very tender and sweet. 

- Hollandse erwtensoep ($6.95 bowl) - comes with a warm fresh pretzel bun. Oks got a second ($0.80) cause she loves them so much. Pea soup had some chicken and sausage mixed in. Good. 
- Rosti, ui en kaas ($10.95) - shredded potato, onion and cheese with added tomatoes ($1.00). Crispy and tasty like a pierogi flattened into a thin style Dutch pancake. 
- Spek en appel ($10.95) - who knew bacon and apple could be so good? Delicious. Sweetness from the thinly sliced apples, savoury from the bacon. I'd hit it again. 
- Special pannenkoek of the month (fresh strawberries) ($14.95) - ice cream, whipped cream, icing sugar and chocolate sauce. Perfect dessert to end our meal. Strawberries were fresh and the ice cream/whipped cream decadent. Perfect to share for three (one scoop of ice cream for each!).

Pleasantly surprised with Pffantastic Pannenkoek. Would totally come back again for brunch. Dutch goodness!"}
{"text":"I took 2 kids here on a spontaneous whim, and lo and behold they loved it.   No the traditional pancake style but adventure was the name of the game and this fit the bill.  I had a savory pancake with potato and bacon which was pretty good although a bit salty for my taste.  The other 2 orders were sweet pancakes and they were quite a sight.  Huge place, loads of fruit and ice cream and probably one of the rare times that the munchkins could not finish everything even though they loved it.

The ambiance was lacking a bit and felt old, but service was friendly and fast.

Everyone voted to come back and try something different so you know that is a good sign."}
{"text":"SO, so good!!!

I've heard about this place many times in Yelpland, but I never had the opportunity to try it...until now! A loose hood on my car led me to pull into this strip mall and am I ever glad I did.

There was quite a wait when we arrived, but thankfully it went quickly and we were seated right away. I ordered a B52 coffee & the Potato, Bacon, and Cheese pancake and it was absolute heaven! We also got a couple of Banana, Coconut, and Chocolate ones to go, and I'm not even ashamed to admit we attacked both of them within a matter of minutes once we got home.

I cant wait to go back and try everything else off the menu. I. MEAN. EVERYTHING."}
{"text":"Oh-My-Dog.  

I've never had a pannenkoek before, and boy that was a treat.  Don't let the dumpy little shopping center and diner atmosphere fool you, this place is good!  I had the bacon-rasin-cheese pannenkoek, and damn it was good.  That's all."}
{"text":"On the upside, this is a pretty unique pancake style and we each had a different type, all of which were good. Try the bacon apple for a great savoury/sweet combination. The coffee service was pretty prompt and the coffee was drinkable, though not great.

BUT the wait time on this Sunday morning really ruined what might have been a fun family breakfast. We expected to wait for a table (and we did for about 40 minutes), by the service was absurdly slow beyond that. We waited 45 minutes from the time we were seated to when our food arrived. 

So overall, a unique place and tasty specialty, but just not really worth the wait in a city that has a lot of options for breakfast."}
{"text":"I do love a good dutch pancake and this place definitely met my standards. Definitely very busy, we had to wait about 15 minutes to be seated. Our server seemed a little cold at first but she seemed to warm up as our meal went on. My was it busy! The food was really good, it seemed a little pricy when I compared it to the food I got in Edmonton at De Dutch but never the less it was tasty! I would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"After seeing this on TV  I was expecting more. I may have got there on a bad day. The only flavor came from a couple of slices  sausage. 

For $15 it was very disappointing."}
{"text":"For all the great things I've heard about Pfanntastic Pannenkoek Haus, it certainly took me long enough to get there. Seriously, it's been on my radar for near 2 years, but it's not anywhere that I typically frequent. It took an intentionally planned brunch at a spot that turned out to be closed for me to get here. But I'm glad I did!

I'm going to call PPH \"Calgary's original house of pancakes.\" But it's not the fluffy buttermilk ones we're used to. Nono, these are more doughy and crepe-like, but not as flat, and all of the contents are cooked into the dough rather than being wrapped inside. 

There are more flavours of pancake than I know what to do with. And if there's a flavour you aren't quite on board with or that you're thinking, \"You know, it'd be great if I could try a little bit of this and a little bit of that instead,\" don't you worry, PPH will make you whatever you want. Like, if you want a double bacon and apple pancake, you can have it. Me, I went for the bacon, smoked sausage and egg one. It seemed appropriately breakfast-y. Five fabulous stars... I didn't need syrup, or toppings or anything. That pancake was so packed full of mouth-watering goodness... please excuse me while I wipe the drool off my chin at the memory of it.

Where PPH lost the 5th star on my visit was in the service. Friendly and on top of things for the most part, but my brunch mate got there before me and ordered a water. When I got there I was asked what I wanted to drink, I ordered a coffee... and brunchmate was skipped over. Misunderstanding, no big deal, they thought all she wanted was water. The next visit to our table, she ordered a hot chocolate. And it was forgotten... we had to ask after it again, and in the end it didn't turn up on our bill. We asked after it at the till, they forgot to put it on there too.

Anyway, the pancakes lived up to the hype. Please go out of your way to visit! Just make sure you speak up if something's missing, it's a busy place and it may've gotten lost in the shuffle a bit!"}
{"text":"This place is tasty! There's a reason they're lined up out the door. The decor is lacking, sadly, but the food is great, and the service was fast and correct. I had the Cinnamon Roll with added apple, and the pannenkoek was the size of the plate, hot and fresh, costing about $11. The coffee was mediocre (I had to add two sugars to it), but you're not there for the coffee, are you? I would totally hit this place again!"}
{"text":"Warning- do not come here expecting North American fluffy IHOP pancakes. Stopped in on Thursday at 11:45am. Great service, yummy crepes and flavourful coffee!

There is a large selection of sweet and savoury items. This place serves super light crepes that  fit a dinner plate. I had potato, bacon, leek and mushrooms. Served with a side of sour cream. My gf had chicken n dumpling soup served with a pretzel roll and my other 2 gf's had potato, onion, bacon and cheese. We all enjoyed what we had and the endless coffee!!!  The coffee was also served with a traditional ginger biscuit. Yummy!!!"}
{"text":"This place is my absolute favorite breakfast spot for really any time of day. The dutch pancakes are just amazing, I always order 2 so that I have a bit to take home. I had my birthday there and everyone I invited there just loved it and couldn't believe how delicious everything was. They have long line up for breakfast on weekends but if you go any other time then you don't have to wait!"}
{"text":"My gf and I went to spin class Saturday morning near Chinook Mall and obviously we were hungry after the session. We were trying to think of places to eat but nothing seemed to catch our attention. I pulled out my Yelp! app and noticed that Pffantastic Pannenkoek wasn't too far. I've heard great things about Pfanntastic for quite some time but just never had a chance to visit, so it seemed like the perfect time to go. Amanda had already tried this place and was shocked I hadn't so we headed over. 

Pfanntastic Pannenkoek is located in the Lincoln Park Shopping Centre on 54th Avenue SW, just off Crowchild Trail. It was around lunch time and there was a large party ahead of us but we only waited maybe 10 minutes. I noticed it got busier while we were sitting. They offer salads, soups, omelettes, and of course pannekoeks which can be sweet or savory. Pannekoeks are Dutch style pancakes, larger than the typical pancake but not as thin as crepes. For drinks, I just got water and Amanda went with a coffee because it came with a delicious speculoos cookie, I was jealous 'cause those cookies are so darn good. Of course for my first time I wanted to experience pannekoek so I did just that. We ordered the two pannekoeks to share, Rosti, ui, spek en kaas which is shredded potato, onion, bacon and cheese with a side of sour cream and the Kruidenboter (Herb butter) which is ham, mushroom, onion and cheese served with a herb butter patty and a small house salad on top. It seems as though the meals took a while to arrive but maybe it was because we were starving.... But when they did arrived, I was quite excited. They were HUGE and occupied the whole plate. We asked for another plate because we were splitting the two and that's when the girl told us that they could have done it for us if we mentioned we wanted two different flavors (noted for next time!!).

I liked how they had a small salad on the Kruidenboter, it was nice and refreshing before getting into the nitty gritty. I found that the Kruidenboter was more crepe like and the Rosti, ui, spek en kaas to be more solid and crispier - it seemed like the classic choice. Both were delicious, but I enjoyed the shredded potato, onion, bacon and cheese one more - it was more filling and was perfect combo for brunch. Dipping the slices in sour cream is a must!! I looooove sour cream. I ended up eating my whole pannekoek and part of Amanda's because she was full.

Overall, our experience at Pffantastic Pannenkoek Haus was good. Our server was pretty attentive and sweet. The pannenkoeks were tasty and reasonably priced and it seems as though they sell some Dutch goodies up front. Next time I will definitely try a savory pannenkoek because the couple sitting next to us shared what looked like the black forest pannenkoek and it looked AMAZING - ice cream scoop in the middle, 3 piles of whipped cream with piles of cherries in between. YUM!"}
{"text":"Other than the constant line up out the door on weekend, I always forward to going to the fancy Dutch pancake place. I don't know how to day or spell it's name. My fave is the chicken parmesan."}
{"text":"Great consistent place ... If line ups are not your thing, then you need to go early or really late for a weekend brunch. I'm not a fan of their tea or coffee, but the biscuit it they add on the side makes up for it ... Now to the real stuff ... A picture is worth a 1000 words ( Calories have a different metric ) the Apple and Cinnamon pancake is my favourite."}
{"text":"This is a great Brunch place! It is very cutely decorated with Delft blue items! We really enjoyed the sweet pancake (with nutella, banana + pecan) and the veggie omlette. Definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"everyone loves this place! go there before 11am to avoid line up.

I always have the leek and mushroom one, love that! simple but taste good!

Last week I tried the special MSM - Montreal Smoked Meat, they put a lot of smoked meat, very nice. But it's too salty for me (I cannot eat spam/ham if they are pan fried, too salty for me, so it's just very personal)."}
{"text":"I was here for the first time while visiting friends in Calgary. We arrived around 1 so of course there was a 45 min wait and a long line of people. But this seems to be the norm for any and all breakfast places anywhere. So we weren't surprised. It's a cute little place with traditional netherland décor. Feels very much like grandmas kitchen. The service despite being very busy was polite and fast. We didn't have to wait long for our food. I had the cinnamon and apple which tasted just like what my mother use to make. The portions were perfect also and prices very reasonable. I tried a bit of my boyfriends savory pancake of egg,sausage and cheese. it was wonderful. everyone in line said it was worth the wait and I had to agree. Wish we had a place like this in Edmonton."}
{"text":"Yum so good.  The only draw back is we usually skip coming here because the line up is out the door on weekends."}
{"text":"My first breakfast here deserves 5 stars.  I cannot believe it.  It's amazing how one judges a book by its cover sometimes.  This Haus isn't fancy but they serve a mean spek, appel en kaas (bacon, apple and cheese) pannenkoeken.  

I prefer my fruit to be cold rather than hot, so I figured I was taking a risk by trying a dish with apple.  Somehow the sweet was there without the taste of apple.  It blew my mind, actually.  There was the perfect amount of bacon and enough cheese to be slightly gooey but not enough to think you'll be rolling on the floor in pain and regret afterward.  It was so flavorful that no syrup or butter was required.  It looked absolutely massive but the cool part is that it's thin enough that you can actually eat the entire thing and have your appetite completely satisfied. 

If you think you'll have room for desert, you're likely wrong, but a good substitute is the hot chocolate if you want a sugar rush (especially if you didn't order a pannenkoeken from the classic or specialty sweet variety).  I don't know what they make their hot chocolate with, but it certainly doesn't taste like cheap powder.  It comes with a gigantic mountain of whipped cream on top and it's pretty thick.  When you mix it entirely into the hot chocolate, you have a very rich beverage that just may bump you into the gorged category, but it's worth it if you're a hardcore sugar junkie like me.  

I thought the price for this meal was reasonable and there's no doubt that I'll return.  There was a small fail in the beverage order department but it didn't impact my overall experience."}
{"text":"I love this place and is a classic. I've been to other panecooke house and they don't even come close. We almost always take visitors here and they love it.
We usually split one savery and one sweet. Make sure you try the Stroop on the savery. My fav- leeks and spek!"}
{"text":"It is well worth the wait to get in here. The food is delicious. I love there savoury pancakes.The coffee comes with a tasty ginger cookie, which are also available for sale. We enjoyed our meal and took home a pack of the ginger cookies."}
{"text":"I first visited PPH the first arrival to Calgary (Aug 2012) and was told it was a Calgary Staple!  I fully agree!  We visited again on my one year anniversary of moving to Calgary which was awesome and ironically sat in the same booth.  IRONIC!

Be prepared to wait ... They are quite busy on weekends from literally opening to closing.  It's worth the wait and the meals are served quite quickly.

I love that their hot beverages come w/ginger snaps!  So tasty - you can also purchase them to bring home.

The selection is amazing and depending on if you are in a savory or sweet mode you will have difficulty deciding.  I've had the Rosti and the Chocolate/Banana/Coconut ... OMG heaven!  They are all amazing and I'm always pleased with the meal - leaving overly full!

Will definitely be back!"}

Coffee with Speculoos
Saskatoon Berries, Whipped Cream, Ice Cream Pannenkoek
Potato, Bacon, Onion, Cheese, Sour Cream Pannenkoek

A locally owned institution located in a small shopping complex off the highway, Calgary's Pfanntastic Pannenkoek Haus focuses on a very specific dish common throughout the Netherlands, but rarely found elsewhere, a novelty that has nonetheless found plenty of fans in Western Canada where a 9:05am arrival was just minutes early enough to avoid a significant line snaking out the frozen front door.

Discussing it's unique style of skillet-cooked dough proudly on the website and menu, each round priced between $12-$19 with nearly limitless ability to customize in addition to several-dozen suggested combinations, patrons at Pfanntastic Pannenkoek Haus are greeted with the most smiling of faces by a team of mostly middle-age Women, most regulars ordering without even a look at the menu while the indecisive are presented Coffee with a Windmill Biscuit to enjoy as they weigh the options.

Decorated in traditional ornaments with a wide selection of imported Cookies, Candies and Toppings to take home, traditional Maggi Seasoning Sauce and Schenkstroop found alongside Creamer and Sugar on the table, it was with tough decisions made that two Pancakes filled the table perhaps fifteen minutes and two Cups of Coffee after entering, each flattened disc likely enough to feed a couple, the best bet to dine with a mindset of sharing.

Taking a good look at each Pannenkoek, the savory choice of Bacon and Onion beneath a lattice of Cheddar and crispy shredded-Potatoes a touch oily and quite salty even without the MSG-based Seasoning, slow-and-steady proves a wise choice when indulging as everything from the center out arrives piping hot, the sweet 'classic' cooled by three scoops of Vanilla Ice Cream and thick Schenkstroop far more readily devoured with a texture about halfway between a Crepe and a North American Pancake beneath a warm scoop of reduced Saskatoon Berries."}
{"text":"This is a fantastic diamond in the rough.  A great place for breakfast, lunch, brunch or dinner.  These dutch pancakes pack a log of food in a crepe like batter.  There's lots to choose from with even dessert pancakes.

The atmosphere makes you feel like you're at someone's home which is great.  Food is good, price is reasonable and the dining room is clean.

Support your local businesses!"}
{"text":"Delicious 'Pannenkoek's! We shared two savoury Dutch pancakes and they are rich and calorie ridden so be aware of that, but daaaannnggggg! Pretty darn tasty. We ordered the Philly to share and then the cinnamon-roll one with baked apple. 

Both of the pancakes were very very good. Both were a joy to eat. Every bite was enjoyable. 

The coffee was ok, not bad. Came with a dunkable ginger cookie!

I like that they have syrup (sweet) and Maggie seasoning (savory) on the table, that was nice. All of the staff there were efficient, knowledgeable and nice. We didn't even ask for them to split the two dishes but they did it themselves so that was a nice treat. Our waitress said they do that if they can. 

Overall good experience for a sometimes-treat."}
{"text":"Delicious, thy name is pannenkoek! I've been told about this pancake place by a few friends and family and had to try it. Disguised and tucked away in a little strip mall right off of Crowchild is this Dutch haus. 

The ambience is very homey and welcoming. You are greeted at the front podium with a pair of clogs and excited staff. You can see a lot of Dutch wares and food/condiments for sale that can't be found in your regular supermarket. 

If you get coffee, you get a tasty treat of speculoos cookie on the side. The pancakes are large, filling the plate. You have a choice of savoury, savoury-sweet, and sweet as well as the option to create your own/add extra toppings. All of the toppings are cooked right into the pancake. 

We had the chicken parmesan as well as the potato, bacon, and onion pancakes. They were both filling and completely satisfying. The potato, bacon, onion came with a side of sour cream. You can add the Maggi sauce to add a punch of umami flavour as well.

This is a great place to go to for a different spin on pancakes and breakfast/brunch!"}
{"text":"We (family and friends) have been to Pfantastic Pannenkoek Haus multiple times and we really enjoy all their pancakes (savoury and sweet) and other  breakfast options. 

The food portions are huge, so sharing is a must! We have almost tried every single pancake (savoury and sweet) and we love them all! Their pancakes are thin and crispy, but at the same time chewy and moist on the inside.

Atmosphere of PPH is super cozy and the service is great. Servers always greet us instantly when we walk through the doors. Even when there is a huge line-up (trust me there is always a line up, especially on the weekends) our orders come in a timely manner. And while waiting, when you get your coffee, they give you a lil gingerbread cookie! And I'm pretty sure if you ask even if you didn't order coffee they would give you a cookie anyway. 

Overall, just think of the PPH as your grandparent's home where you eat comfortable, talk happily, and eat super tasty homemade food. So, I definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"This place deserves nothing less than 5 stars. The onion , cheese potato and bacon .. and the choc banana coconut  Amazing !"}
{"text":"Great restaurant.
Food was great, service was fast and friendly. It felt like having a great meal at your aunts house.

We had a \"create your own\" pannenkoek with egg, smoked sausage, leek, and mushrooms. Tasted great and the leeks were a nice touch. However, the egg is a little lost and pointless in the mix.

We also had a banana coconut chocolate pannenkoek and it was awesome. I'm not completely sure if banana and coconut go together though because the banana flavour overwhelms the coconut.

The coffee was great here and the accompanying ginger snap cookie was a surprisingly perfect addition.

Love this place and hope to come back the next time I'm in Calgary!"}
{"text":"Today I went to the Pannenkoek Haus and brought with me, a Pannenkoek Virgin!

I have been coming to this place for 12 years but he had never been. He was completely enraptured with his bacon and egg Pannenkoek and he said that they were exactly like British pancakes (he's a Brit).

I had soup (orange soup) and salad. I know, I KNOW blasphemy. But I have Tonsilitis, so anything solid hurts. The coffee was still good and the soup was awesome.

Also, great service as usual. I love this place. I just wish they had gluten free Pannenkoeks!"}
{"text":"We were just visiting Calgary and our friends brought us here for brunch one day.  It's the most yummy Pannenkoek I've ever had! I got the smoked sausage, egg and spinach (own toppings) and I loved that they had Maggi sauce too!  We have a toddler so they have great booster seats for them.  Service was great and we wished we had this restaurant back home one Vancouver."}
{"text":"I met up with friends for brunch here and it was packed!  The place was small but bright and neatly adorned with Dutch decor without being tacky.  It would be a good place for friends and family of all ages.  Also seems like a good place just to meet friends for coffee and chats.

Everything on the menu sounded awesome.  The pictures that people have posted are totally accurate.  We each ordered different pancakes and they were delicious!  We had savoury ones this time, but I can't wait to try everything on the menu!"}
{"text":"Great service.  Food was very tasty and interesting.  A great breakfast and lunch place.  I have not been here in the evening so I am not sure how it fares at night.

The prices were reasonable for the portion size.  It has a nice cozy atmosphere."}
{"text":"If you love thin Dutch style pancakes/crepes, this is the place to come. They are huge, and served with a massive variety of toppings, ranging from chocolate spread to chicken. At first you could be forgiven for thinking they were serving you thin crust pizza.

The line up can be long, particularly at the weekend, but it's worth the wait. And staff do their best to serve you quickly and turn tables over to keep the line moving, without making you feel pressured into shovelling the food into your mouth as fast as possible.

They also have a small selection of Dutch food and souvenirs available for purchase. My daughter was particularity pleased as she loved the pancake syrup they serve and was able to take a bottle home."}
{"text":"This is a traditional Dutch pancake house. Not fine dining but definitely a welcoming environment with a no fuss casual feel. Great for family, couples, and any kind of occasion really. The food here is prepared to a high standard and is always consistent. They serve coffee with a speculaas cookie:)"}
{"text":"Growing up with a Dutch mother I never knew any other kind of pancakes existed other than the Dutch variety, until I attended sleepovers and was baffled by these fluffy North American breakfast creations that stuck to the roof of my mouth.
My mum used to take me and my sister to Pfanntastic Pannenkoek Haus to celebrate our Dutch heritage so the restaurant holds fond memories for me, but I had not been in ages and have recently frequented it twice in the last couple of months.

The interior is much the same, though looking a little shabby, Dutch delft pottery and wooden shoes can be found all over the restaurant. The hostess is very friendly and accommodating to the large parties of 8 or more that come through the doors at peak breakfast/lunch times. Once seated though the rest of the staff seem like they have just flown from Holland and are permanently jet lagged. Forgetful and a little slow, if you are seated next to the counter with the Dutch pastries for sale you can hear them chatting away.

We both ordered coffee, which comes with a specluaas cookie, but the coffee both times has been lukewarm and weak. You would be better off ordering a specialty coffee or a can of Casiss (black currant pop) to accompany your meal.

The main ordering issue I have always been plagued by since I was a little girl is whether to order a savory (hartig) or a sweet (zoete) pancake. The solution is to order one of each and swap pancakes with whom you are dining with halfway through the meal for the best of both worlds. Recently I have ordered the warm cherries with ice cream and chocolate sauce; the bacon, mushroom and onion; the chicken, bacon, leek, mushroom and parmesan; and the shredded potato, bacon, onion and cheese, which is like a giant flat perogie served with sourcream. These are all delicious panenkoek selections and will not steer you wrong. Having the bottle of Maggi sauce on the table is always an excellent addition to any savory pancake where stroop is for the more seasoned Nederlander.

I still enjoy this restaurant but it is very busy and the coffee needs a revamp. I do recommend purchasing some almond fingers or stroop waffles for later munching."}
{"text":"A Calgary staple, really.  If you haven't been, well why not?

We got here really early on a weekend, right when they opened, and avoided all the lineups.   I am a fan of sweet breakfast food and got the simple lemon and sugar pancake.  My husband likes the savoury and got the potato and onion with sour cream.  Both are just to die for.    Huge servings, nice staff, and a good atmosphere when its not too crowded."}
{"text":"We come here every year around Christmas time on our way through the city. Delicious! We love the savory and sweet options and the servings are awesome! Staff are always helpful even when they are slammed- aka the weekend! The Dutch pancake is sort of like a cross between a crepe and an omelette in my opinion. The flavors are great and the menu is large so it's a hard decision to make! Great place for groups but you will have to wait a while for a table- especially on busy weekends!"}
{"text":"We went there and despite being very busy we did not wait more then 15 minutes to be seated. The coffee service was prompt as we did wait a bit for are food to come out. I chose the heavens delight and was not disappointed mounds of whip cream, creamy ice cream, and a fairly strong orange liqueur you pour overtop yourself which the pancake soaks up very nicely. I would eat there again"}
