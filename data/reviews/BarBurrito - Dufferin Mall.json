{"text":"I've been waiting for months for this burrito stand to open in the food court of Dufferin mall. Dufferin mall's food court is undergoing a huge renovation and this is my favourite part of it so far! It's their first day open and there was a big line. But the service was really fast and friendly, the food is reasonably priced, and it was fresh and delicious. The hot sauce has a real kick. Don't take two lines of the hot sauce unless you're a true chilli head!"}
{"text":"Xmas time and Bar Burrito ... Ymmmmy So warm and fresh... Worth it yet again. Hungry or not or even a light healthy snack/food... Just go straight there. Employees and management are simply friendly. They will ensure your food is well done!!!! Thanks for opening it."}
{"text":"This welcome new addition to the Dufferin mall food court, makes a pretty  good burrito. The flavour of the steak was amazing, juicy and delicious, while actually resembling actual steak, It was so tender I could not believe  It. I got hot sauce, it wasn't mild,I was sweating. But I left with my taste buds not burning. The burrito was  well grilled before put in my hands,resulting in a burrito that was coming apart in my mouth, not in my hands. the beans however which you are given a choice on type, neither choice  look as appeasing as it tastes. As for selection, it is the basic selection you will find at most burrito joints. The size is pleasing(I don't measure my burrito's and can't give an exact size)but it stacks up against every other \"small\" burrito I have had.price is pretty much in line with the other burrito places I've been to. To leave off this burrito left me satisfied as opposed to with a sick feeling."}
{"text":"Update: Tried their Steak nachos and got a handful of meat and cheese with it. I didn't want any further toppings but they did give me the options to add any veggies + beans after they had melted the cheese. Tortilla chips were crispy, just enough cheese and plenty of meat to balance the chips. It was very filling and came quite a bit - filled me up just as much as a burrito would. I'll be back to try their nachos with chicken!"}
{"text":"They charge a dollar for guacamole and give you one penny worth of guacamole. I asked if they can do half steak half chicken and they said yes with a smile and charge me extra for and I ended up paying for a lunch. The steak taste like corn beef out of a can that you would buy from value mart. Period would not recommend. You are better off buying uncle Ben's."}
{"text":"One of the worst burritos I have had so far. The veggies were cold, taste wasnt good either. Tortilla was uncooked, I felt like eating uncooked wheat, felt like gum in my mouth.I would not go there again."}
{"text":"This was my first time ever trying a Barburrito place. I've heard pretty good things about it before so I was kind of excited. I ordered a steak quesadilla with chips and a drink.   The employee serving me was more interested in her conversation with her coworker than she was in helping me. When cashing out, she didn't offer to upgrade to a combo so I can definitely see that Barburrito does not care for making extra money.   Just to top off everything, the salsa they gave me for my chips was cold. I'm really wondering if it's even worth going to another location to try or are all of them like this?"}
{"text":"Fool me once...  While the food is one of the best options of Dufferin Mall, the service is definitely the worst.   I already stopped going to this place after my first mishap: the server was working way too fast, building my burrito and that of the person ahead of me at the same time (who I didn't know). The sloppiness of it all: the previous customer's pork and cheese was falling into my burrito which I wanted to be meat and cheese free. The server couldn't care less. I was speechless when she haphazardly used the previous customer's sauce order straight all over my burrito in one go.  She gave me this look like: 'if I move fast enough, she won't say anything' - hoping I was a pushover.   But tonight, against my better judgment; I went back. My husband and I ordered burritos and asked for  'a little bit of hot sauce'. We went straight over to pay so didn't see what she did (but she had that same careless attitude of my previous service here). Fast forward to dinner: she had clearly doused the burritos like she was putting a fire out with the hot sauce - we had to throw both burritos out because they were completely inedible. And our mouths are still on fire 1.5 hours after as we angrily and hungrily vow to never go back.   The people that work here don't value their customers at all as is totally obvious by how they make the food."}
{"text":"Don't go to this place, it's horrible. The service sucks and they're so cheap on the ingredients. Never coming back here again."}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT HERE! The service is trash. I went there today for the first time. I ordered two tacos, a chicken and a steak. Just as the girl began preparing my order, a man got in line behind me. This dude wanted a steak item as well. Instead of starting my order, this server had the audacity to tell me she couldn't give me the steak because this man also ordered steak and they didn't have enough for us both. I asked why I should have to forgo my option when i got there first. She gave me a blank stare, no apologies, no rational response. I had the answer for her though, she was clearly more interested in servicing this white man over me, a black woman, because his money is somehow more valuable them mine. I turned and walked away, disgusted and appalled at the blatant disregard. Go elsewhere, these people don't deserve our patronage."}
