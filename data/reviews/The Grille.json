{"text":"Went there with a bunch of dudes for a tame bachelor party. Had a ton of fun on the patio. Servers were nice, but overall service was kind of slow. Beer was really cheap, which negates the slow service. Someone ordered a platter and it came with a ton of food. Good local crowd until midnight. The Brunswick police showed to impress everyone by harassing the DJ. Not the bar's fault the police were being d!@ks. If anything they should've taken the DJ away for playing crap music. Will go back next time I'm in Brunswick...whenever that might be."}
{"text":"This review is based on my visit on August 3rd, 2015.

Due to an event I was a part of, I had to meet my party at the restaurant about 15 minutes after they had gotten there. When this happens at other restaurants, the waitstaff will see and immediately take the drink order (if they're not already helping another table). This was not the case here. It took our waiter five minutes before he saw me and came to ask for my order. 

I decided to order the Blueberry Kale Salad ($11) and added shrimp ($6). What came to me was a small salad with only a few, small pieces of fruit and four, yes, FOUR shrimp. They were not large, jumbo prawns. They were rather small, and at $1.50 each shrimp I was not happy. The salad was just not worth the $11, even though it did have what I can only call \"fair\" flavor. 

Overall, even on a week night, this restaurant did not have good service. Additionally, their menu prices are not proportional with what they actually put on the plate. Fortunately, the flavor is there and they have many intriguing dishes that I do have an interest in trying."}
{"text":"The food at the grille is always top notch! That being said, its not a place to go if you are in a hurry. We have been in several times and it is always a wait - not because the place is busy, that I could understand. The waiting we have experienced is usually after we have been seated. It takes a while to get service, but as I said once you eventually get your meal it is very good."}
{"text":"Just had dinner at Bogeys at Las Sendas. First time with friends.  I had the chicken breast - cooked perfectly. It was juicy although the crust didn't have much flavor. My husband had the salmon and it was delicious. Our friends had steak - cooked perfectly. And the lamb - also cooked perfectly. The service was very good even the the Rusty Putter was busy.  Agree that it is pricey but we were very happy with the quality of food and we like our food."}
{"text":"If I could give this place zero stars I would.  The bartender was completely rude and dismissive.  The food is decent but being ignored while the bartender starts yacking on the phone while you're mid-order is unforgivable.  Avoid at all costs."}
{"text":"Food was average. Service was terrible. Waitress dropped the pizza on the floor. She didn't offer basic condiments. Waitress didn't know soups of the day. The table next to us sat for 20 minutes without seeing a waitress and then finally went to the bar to order. They ran out of their \"famous\" lobster bisque yet, still upcharged the meal. While we had to wait a good 15 minutes for our check after asking for it. I would not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Went to dinner Saturday night to check out the new menu and chef. We were not disappointed! I ordered the shrimp and hubby ordered the steak. Both were delicious, good thing we like to share! We ordered dessert, one bread pudding, which is usually good here, but this time not so good. It was dry. We figured it was an off night. We also ordered the chocolate cake with sorbet which was a winner. Overall, we were satisfied, the service was attentive as it always is, and the food has improved. Just look at the pics!"}
{"text":"Quite frankly I just had one of the worse meals ever here... My initial request for a simple Coors Lite should have been my first clue when I was told  you were totally out.. .C'mon it's a bar on Tuesday night at 6PM!  I settled for a Budweiser and proceeded to order your \"Market Priced\" steak dinner. What I received was an over cooked, tough piece of meat consisting of more fat and gristle than anything else. The fresh cut fry accompaniment was less than desirable as well... I could have squeezed the oil and grease from your day old fries and lubed my car and then some! Once my meal arrived I even had to ask for the simple things like silverware, steak sauce and other accompaniments. Oh yeah, here is why I will never return... When I cordially complained about the meal...To my surprise, I was told you are not a steak house if I wanted a good steak I should go to a steak house! Clearly, not the response I wanted to hear!"}
{"text":"Such a shame. We've dined here several times and both the food and service have declined at each visit.  Today's service was so poor we just ate our appetizers (or tried to) and passed on ordering entrees.  We got the nachos/salsa and \"flaming\" cheese.   We went for their mango salsa but shocking, they no longer have it. Probably because it actually requires a FRESH ingredient ...something the Grille apparently no longer purchases.   The salsa was straight from a jar...or bucket probably...and rivaled Aldi's brand at best.  The \"flaming\" cheese was a rubbery yet crusty glob sitting in an inch of some weird grease.  The unfortunate thing is they were not busy and had a ton of staff...yet we waited 20 minutes for a beer while the two \"bartenders\" texted on their phones.  Now I understand what Gordon Ramsey means when he says customers always tell you things are great and rarely complain. ... they just don't come back.  That's us.   We paid our bill,  said everything was fine but will never go back.  (And are the prices rising because the clientele is declining? I'd assume so....I hope someone actually reads these because it could be such a nice place)"}
{"text":"This place was awful for the first time visit. Food was very good when it finally came and we could finally order it. Took 45 minutes to finally get a waitress to come to our table of 8 for the first time. Then didnt get the drink order right. The second time she came we all ordered food since it was 30 minutes later. She didnt get our food right and one plate came 20 minutes after everyone else's and never brought out an appetizer. She never came back a 3rd time until we asked for a manager. Then she messed up on checks by charging two different cards to the same tab. We had different people helping our table but still took them way too long to help us until we went seeking for them. It was an awful experience and won't be going back."}
{"text":"Casual dining at it's best. Great view, food, and service."}
{"text":"We have always enjoyed the atmosphere and food. Always good!  The service is great, they remember you even if you've only been in a few times. They are accommodating to kids as well. We are now \"regulars\" :). Will go here as long as they will have us!"}
{"text":"Fun to hang out on the patio. However, the service was horrible. I won't go back.  We sat at the bar for approx. 10 minutes before we could even get a bartender to serve us.  Keep in mind it was not crowded.  There were people there it was not that busy.  The bartenders clealry did not want to be there. That was easy to tell based on the demeanor and lack friendly customer service.So we decided to move to table hoping for better service.  We didn't find any better service.

We were told numerous time by our waiter that he was trying to take care of larger group and that he would be right back.  However, we waited 15-20 minutes before he even came back with our drinks.  I guess we weren't as important as the other table.

We even spoke with a lady that was the manger there.  However, service did not improve.

Either they don't have enough staff or the staff they have can't do their jobs. Either way we will not be going back."}
{"text":"Love coming here. Great view and the bartender Christian is awesome, very friendly and helpful. We live in the neighborhood and would love to see them get some music in the evenings on the weekend."}
{"text":"If you want a relaxing spot to eat with great food, service and views go eat at the Grille at Las Sendas.  Might be a drive for most but definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Great place to enjoy a lovely view. We went for lunch on a Sunday. The day was perfect and the views remind me of why people come to the valley. 
The three of us were satisfied with our meals. I think my prime rib french dip won over the chicken pot pie or kobe burger, although all were good. It seemed quite casual and the service was also. It lent to the layed back tranquility. I wouldnt go there in a rush.
Thought the happy hour looked enticing although it is too far afield to drink and then have to get home. We shall return!!!

Came back a second time and was disappointed in our meals that took forever to get after ordering. It was good, not great. Loved the Bloody Mary Bar."}
{"text":"Great menu. Delicious food. Some of the best sunsets in the world out on the patio."}
{"text":"Great patio, great people, great staff, great food, great drinks, everything is great here. One thing that really stood out for me is the above average and down right delicious eats in a bar environment. Although I am partial to a Greek inspired menu, there are all kinds of options here. The patio is great, its very large and there are several activities to do out there in the summer, i.e. cornhole, volleyball, etc.

Another thing that I love about the grille is the bar selection. I have never seen a bar that doesn't specialize in beer, have so many options. I'm very picky and only drink bud light lime and lienenkugel summer shandy and they had both. This is definitely a first for me.

Great job Chef Artie, you turned that location into a real winner!"}
{"text":"The potential is here. The outside bar could have a really great atmosphere, and could handle a huge capacity. Unfortunately, this bar will never draw in that crowd.

First of all, it can't decide what it wants to be. It's in a weird limbo of playing awkward reggae while also having the sports game on in the background. You can't go here to mingle-because you can't hear over the mix of music and tv going on. You can't go here to watch the game because the TVs are small and there's music in the background.

At 11 PM on a Friday evening, they will bump any music you PAY to play on Touch Tunes. I can't count how much money I've wasted here trying to force a good time. Seems like most have abandoned hope by now, and I'm going to do the same."}
{"text":"The ranger might be grumpy out on the course... But the food is on point! The Goat Cheese + Arugula + red wine grilled onion burger will change your life! For real!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed in the service. Since we came in, we did nothing but wait. Waitress was friendly, but not only did we wait for every single item, she brought the wrong beer and forgot a food item. I went up to the owner to ask for a take-out box that we've waited 10 more minutes for, and after I told him that's how the whole night went, he didn't bother to seem concerned or even say sorry. When the owner doesn't care, neither will the rest of the staff."}
{"text":"Nothing spectacular but not horrible! I definitely will be coming here again especially because my boyfriend lives very close and the food is pretty good for a small restaurant. When we go there we like to get a burger and play keno, the atmosphere is inviting and the service is decent. Plus the owner has a really adorable little puppy that sometimes sneaks out of the apartment that he lives in above the restaurant!"}
{"text":"won't lie. this was terribly underwhelming. i don't know that i'd call it gross - i think everything was edible, but i don't even remember much about it other than Danielle and i agree we didn't feel the need to go back, though our server was really nice."}
{"text":"New owners.  Place has been remodeled with a real sports bar atmosphere. Gi is back as manager and really has the place hopping. Food is good and outside patio is changed also."}
{"text":"Stopped after playing golf to enjoy 2 for 1 beers and lunch.  Katie was our server.  She started out a bit rough but got better as we were served.  I had the wings and they were very good.  I highly recommend a visit after a round of golf!"}
{"text":"I used to be a regular here all the time when ARtie and Gina were married. It was affordable though more expensive than it had been to pay for all the renovations after the fire. The portions were huge and food homecooked. After they divorced, it went to hell. I paid $18 for a dozen chicken wings and stopped going. The food was garbage, service worse, attitudes bad. I see why they closed."}
{"text":"WOW!!  A total disaster.  It is a shame when KFC can serve a better chicken meal than a Golf Club Restaurant.  I was shocked at the lack of professionalism from your Management Staff.  This is the 2nd time I have tried The Grille and both times the meal was bad.  The first was when my wife's steak was over cooked, then my chicken was over cooked as well.  It really shocked me when your establishment also runs out of food listed on the menu.  Never again will I return and rest assured I will not recommend The Grille at Las Sendas!!"}
{"text":"I can agree with the previous people who have commented about not being 100% sure what to make of this place. On the sign out front it says \"home of Captain Cleveland,\" with a picture of a guy decked out in Browns paraphernalia, so I thought we were walking into a sports bar. However, the actual bar area is pretty small (as are the TVs... well, all but one). Also, we saw waitresses carrying these huge plates of what looked and smelled like absolutely delicious pasta dishes, so at that point we wondered if it was actually an Italian restaurant. 

We opted to sit at the bar and had a super friendly and attentive bartender looking after us. The menu had lots of variety, and many things that you wouldn't expect to find at a place you thought was going to be a sports bar. They have roasted red pepper hummus! And greek fries! In looking at the menu we concocted this story that the place is run by three best friends, one of whom is Italian, one of whom is Greek, and one who really really likes sports. We decided to get the calamari and it was maybe some of the best I've ever had. They give you marinara and this spicy Hawaiian (I think that's how they billed it) sauce for dipping. I was skeptical, but we practically licked the bowl clean that contained the spicy Hawaiian sauce. I would like to go back to try some of the pasta (we were just stopping in for a snack). I think they could really use some design help because the dining room area seemed cluttered and uncomfortable.  Anyhow, despite the confusion about the identity of the place, we had a good experience and I would recommend it as a place for a sit-down dinner, not really game watching."}
{"text":"Used to be a 4 star review but they've cut back on the \"fresh\" lately.  Chicken is now appears to arrive to the restaurant pre cooked and pre cut. (from what i understand you can not get a full boneless grilled chicken breast any longer)...and something has gone on with the fries, i thought at one time they were fresh cut, now they are some odd skin on breaded things.  Hummus is still outstanding...and inconsistent, which isn't a bad thing...that's how i know that stuff is still handmade.  Disappointing, and i fear for the longevity of the establishment.  Cost cutting measures don't usually mean better profits in a restaurant, they mean fewer customers.  If you have to charge more for fresh ingredients then do that.  My main go tos included the chicken and now its below average at its reheated from frozen best, if not downright terrible.  So unless I want a burger, that's the only reason i'd stop in...and, while good, the burgers are but a blip on the overcrowed local burger radar.  Get it together guys.  This used to be real good A+ quality barfood...now.  2 stars."}
{"text":"I use to love to go to Bogeys but recently they have gotten too busy for their own good.  People have figured out it is the best view in Mesa but the last 3 times we have gone the service has been horrible.  Dinner took 3 hours one time and last week it took 45 minutes to get them to clean the table and take our drink order.  We finally walked out and won't return.  Management needs to stop promoting the place and staff it correctly!!  We live in Las Sendas and none of our neighbors want to go there any more because of the service."}
{"text":"We used to love coming here a few years ago, what happened ? Poor service, poor management. Such a Shame."}
{"text":"We have been to Rusty Putter many times, and enjoy it immensely. 

About 6 weeks ago, the service was very slow, as they were swamped with people.

They gave us complimentary Nachos, and were very apologetic, but anyone could see they were doing their best and trying hard

I would recommend to anyone"}
{"text":"Everyone went out of their way to say hello (not typical behavior around these parts). Don Julio was nicely chilled and there were several IPA's on draft to choose from. Food was typical bar fare.  Didn't go outside as it was raining."}
{"text":"The remodel looks great! The service, not so much. We were seated by one waitress (not the hostess, she waited the table next to us too), passed off to another waitress, the food was delivered by the cook, I had to ask for ketchup and salt for my burger and fries, ordered my burger medium and it was well done and kinda charred. Still edible, but not how it was ordered. Someone came over after we were done, I can only assume she was the manager(she didn't tell us who she was), asking how things were and tried to talk to us about it but the whole experience was crappy enough that we were over it. Won't be coming back here again."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been here quite a few times and now have given up.  We went in the winter a couple of times on a Friday and both times we were seated close to the door.  We asked if we could move to a warmer table and we were told they were reserved.  We ordered, got our food paid the bill and the tables were still empty wnen we left both times.  

Well we figured we'd go back in the summer to avoid that.  We got there and they said the only open table on the patio was in front of the speakers but the inside had tables.  Not a problem, inside is fine.  Almost the entire inside was open.  We were lead to the table in the back corner by the kitchen door.  We asked to be moved and were told they were expecting a crowd and needed to keep those tables open.  Seriously!  We were also informed that it would be up to a 50 min wait for food but salads and apps would be faster.  We ordered salads and apps and YES THE TABLE WE TABLE WE ASKED TO SIT AT STAYED EMPTY!  My wife really liked the Orange County Pizza and that was what she was going to get but didn't want to wait that long.

Overall from all our experiences we found a few items on the menu are really good the rest are mid-range.  Friday night is date night for us, we both work full time and not up to being treated like a second tier customer.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"It was the first time we had been to the patio in a while and it didn't disappoint on a Saturday night. 

Ah-ma-zing service. Seriously! 

I had a filet and the brussel sprouts (nom nom!)  which were super good and my husband made me very envious with the short rib pasta. He said it might just be one of the best things he ever ate. That good. I'm getting it next time for sure. 

Didn't love the berry cosmo (too sweet!) but the server replaced it immediately with something else."}
{"text":"The Grille is a great authentic Greek restaurant. The portions are huge. The gyros are excellent! I would definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"I give 2 stars cause i keep going back even though I'm usually disappointed.  The patio has such a great view and service is usually great.  

The food and mixed drinks are hit or miss everytime.  

The coffee is terrible.  Gas stations serve better coffee. The cups are small so the coffee gets cold quick and you are always asking for refill.  I would gladly pay 50cents more for a quality coffee in a decent size cup.  Its as though management has never been to a good restaurant to compare.  

Breakfast menu is terrible.  Everything seems like it came out of a microwave.   It's called The Grille but there isnt one brown or crispy mark on the breakfast burritos.  The breakfast seems more like buffet food.  Why not reduce the breakfast menu and try to make a few things right?

Happy hour is what this place does right.  Prices are good.  Food is good if you are after finger food or bar food.  

I feel like every-time i go there they have removed something off the menu that was good. I dont know who in management is making these decisions, but please get a second opinion. 

Finally, can you do a better job at cleaning tables? I feel every time i sit down i have to ask the server to wipe down the table cause there are obvious grease stains and even pieces of food."}
{"text":"Really was looking forward to going to have sunday dinner however the service was so bad we decided to go to dvine instead"}
{"text":"This whole area is so beautiful! We checked out Bogey's for a Company Christmas party and were super impressed. I had the best cobb salad I've ever eaten, everything was so fresh and the chicken was delicious. Perfect place to come at sunset and have a drink! Very friendly staff as well."}
{"text":"This is great place to take family/friends from out of town the view is spectacular.  We always come here for appetizers or a burger after hiking in the area.  The patio is so inviting and a great set up just to look at the Valley.  The service sometimes can be either great or okay depending when all the golfers finish their game.  Most of the time the service is pretty good.  They have big tables to accommodate parties of 5+ and on sunny days have plenty umbrellas to shield you from the sun.  The food has improved over the years and lately has been very good.  Great beer and wine selection."}
{"text":"I came back as I said I would...
This time we sat ourself at the bar.  Theres actually two bars - one of them is filled with wine bottles.  It's gorgeous.  

I had The Grille Gyro and it was reaalllly good.  It had grilled onions & red peppers, tzatziki and feta. YUM.
My buddy had the calamari and he said \"It's good and the Hawaiian sauce is f***in delish!\"

My last review of The Grille I knocked the food - but they totally redeemed themselves this time!  My apologies to this local business. You do indeed have great food!

My only complaint this time was when we arrived we ordered two draft beers - the server came back with a bottle of beer and a 1/2 full glass of draft beer and stated  \"Here, the draft is down\" and walked away.  ?? Got the bill and we were charged for two bottles of beer.

I'll be back and most likely they'll be a 4 star."}
{"text":"Great prime rib. Great pasta bar on Sunday's. This place is a great stop for the after work beer and dinner for the locals. A superb golf day with lunch as well as dinner for all. The patio has great views especially at sunset. They also have great holiday dinners for the family. All and all its a great place with friendly accommodating staff. Cheers to you guys!"}
{"text":"Home of Captain Cleveland!  This place has the best wings.  Greek food is pretty good stuff too.  I've read some reviews complaining about the service but I've had no issues and everyone has been pretty friendly there.  Seems like a great place for football and beers."}
{"text":"This is a solid place to dine. There are a number of good choices on the menu, but I've been time and time again for the delicious cob salad."}
{"text":"Home town, divey feel copled with standard american beers and an eclectic menu.
I bought the Yelp deal ($20 for $10) and took my wife and 3 year old daughter here for dinner mid-week. The restaurant was pretty empty and there was no hostess, but instead a sign that directed us to see the bartender for a seat. After clearly standing around waiting, I walked to the bar and told the bartender we were looking for a table for 2 and a high chair, after a few awkward seconds of her staring at me, she informed me that I could just sit anywhere. We decided to sit behind the less-than-clean fish tank.
The waitress that served us was nice enough. A much younger girl who seemed polite and slightly confused by children. She was prompt and didn't miss anything on the order (dream big, right?). The beer list seemed very subpar for 2013, with a plethora of light beers and Anhauser-Busch affiliates, I settled on their best craft brew (Sierra Nevada Torpedo IPA) which came in a bottle and had sat around for god knows how long. 
Between the 3 of us, we had chicken fingers, onion rings, a greek gyro and the greek lamb burger. All of the food was decent and sensibly priced. Nothing over/under cooked, but also nothing astounding. 
Before leaving, I wandered onto the patio/deck to check out the outdoor sand volleyball court. There is a very large outdoor bar with what seems to be the same beer selection as inside. 
My only suggestions for this bar would be to jump on the craft-brew movement, advertise more of  your outdoor patio and volleyball leagues and have your staff spend some time with kids. I understand it might not be exactly kid-focused, but the sign instructing parents to keep an eye on their children does make it seem like a kid-friendly area. 
I'll definitely come back and give it another shot or two, maybe on a busier night, but it will be with a drinking buddy, not a family outing."}
{"text":"The best thing about this restaurant is the fabulous patio and the view!  Sunset is dynamite, but not so much the food!

Service started out ok but that went downhill as time went on.
I had ordered a pasta veggie dish with Salmon.  No sauce whatsoever, very dry, the pasta was not even close to being done, and the very small piece of salmon was cooked WELL DONE!   Another person at the table sent his food back because it arrived COLD!  

Here is the best part.....when our 2 dishes were returned the server brought my dish and another lady brought the gentlemen's plate.  She apologized to him about the cold food and offered to buy him another drink.  Very nice.  Then she walked away and didn't even make eye contact with me....like I didn't have a problem too!  We were all dumbfounded.  I guess he was pretty cute and his cold food was more important than my dry, tasteless dish.

The filet that was ordered at the table was fabulous.  Well seasoned and cooked to perfection, but the steak, broccollini and potatoes all fit in 1/3 of the plate....all for $32.  Come on folks, bring on the sides to help cover up for charging so much for the 6oz. of meat......this was a $2. increase from the last menu and less food.

So sad this all happened as we like this place but not so much after this visit.
Good Luck and Enjoy Their View......altho I don't think it was worth $100 for 2 entrees, one salad and a couple drinks.  Oh, the rolls are very good!"}
{"text":"Great Happy Hour but very crowded. Dinner is overpriced and the service leaves a lot to be desired. Had the Scallops ($26) and got 3 of them with 3 pieces of asparagus. Not worth the price. server for got to order one of our four entrees. We told them to forget it, we didn't want to wait. Go for the happy hour menu, but don't stay for dinner."}
{"text":"My friends and I have frequented this bar over the years, and unfortunately, have had to stop going all together, due to consistently bad service. 

The food can be really good. Greek food with HUGE portions. That is if the waitress remembers to put your order in, puts it in correctly, and if the Chef is having a good day and completely cooks your food. It really is HIT or MISS. They do have great specials during happy hour. both food and liquor. 

While they have a pretty good beer bottle and liquor selection, their draft beer is never working. Over the 2+ years we've been going here, I think a small handful of times we were able to get a draft beer. 

So let's talk about atmosphere. Chef Artie has really missed the mark here. Is this place a bar, restaurant or night club? I guess you can have all three, if you execute it properly, which he has not done. The place is outdated and at times can appear dingy and dirty due to lack of cleaning. The pictures that are posted are obviously very old.  There is 1 toilet stall for the woman, which is a DISASTER, always. 

We have been in here trying to enjoy dinner before, with vulgar rap music blaring and drunken bar flies enjoying their weekend get-a-way. Not exactly what I want to hear while I am trying to eat my $15 meal. 

It's really a shame that this place does not have better management because the patio is HUGE and the volleyball court is a great attraction. This is the place they invented the \"Bar Rescue\" show about. Great potential, horrible execution. 

We've also headed out for a few drinks late at night, to find that the employees, including Artie use this place as their personal play ground. Artie can be seen groping his flavor of the week instead of tending to his customers, and the bartenders are routinely drunk and non-attentive. 

I get it, there is a place for everyone. Just prepared for a potential train wreck."}
{"text":"I live in Las Sendas and always enjoyed going to The Grill, this summer they changed things and the last 5 or 6 times I've been there the service has been absolutely terrible!! They have been extremely slow, have forgotten things and have just plain old ignored us. I've actually had to stand up and wave at people to get their attention to get us some water!!

Many of the old wait staff are gone and the new ones just don't seem to get what service is!! Hope things get better!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is now known as \"Rusty Putter\".  It is the casual / outdoor part of the restaurant/bar at the Las Sendas Golf Club.  The formal / indoor dining is known as \"Bogeys\".  It is all run / managed by the same people, from what I can tell, and many of the items on the menus overlap.  However, I have not eaten at Bogeys.  

Anyway, we go up there for the spectacular views on the patio, and the happy hour prices from 3-6 (draft beers $2 and house wine $3 - can't beat that! I think they have some mixed drinks for $4 as well).

I've tried hard to like the food, but it just isn't that good, and its overpriced.  There are 4-5 happy hour special appetizers, and the only one we liked were the potstickers - which as of last Friday have been removed from the menu!  The pork sliders on the happy hour menu are decent.  

We have occasionally ventured to the rest of the menu.  My wife had a kobe beef burger - the meat was tasty, but it comes with mozzarella cheese, which has the interesting effect of completely masking the taste of the meat.  This makes me concerned that the designers of the menu do not know how to pair foods well, if they did not know this.  One time, we saw a table order coconut shrimp and decided to try them.  Our four shrimp were overcooked, rubbery and tasteless - and came with a tab of $14!  My fault for not checking the ridiculous price on these.  I've had chicken wings a couple of times - they were reasonable.  But, chicken wings are like **x, as they say - even when they're bad, they're still pretty good.  

I'm not sure how to describe the service - they are friendly, there are alot of servers, but they are very unpolished and disorganized.  They don't seem to know whose tables are assigned to whom.  Whenever we are informed of a shift change with the waitress, the wait staff settles up our bill and then seems to forget our table from that point on.

So, in summary, if you want to have some cocktails on a beautiful spring day, with a wonderful view, head here.  But, eat first and stick with the 3-6 happy hour drink specials.

{"text":"Very nice views. Decent Happy Hour. They often have live music, which is a bit hit or miss, but usually somewhere in between. Most of the food is very good, and they offer a good variety of food and drinks. The service is pretty good, but again sometimes a little slow and sometimes the hostesses are not very friendly.
A little pricy (but what do you expect from a country club type place?)."}
{"text":"The only reason i'm giving this place 3 stars is because #1 the menu is surprisingly good #2 The food was very good and even though the place was packed it came out in halfway decent timing #3 the manager seated us and she was very nice and the waitress was nice and apologizing constantly. #4 even though the place was packed it only took about 45minutes or so to get our food which is ok i guess. #5 The patio looked huge but unfortunately it was cold and windy but we were there for the indoor comedy show anyways.

Now the bad: #1 There were a few guys  that i noticed had been served one too many i think this place may need to re-train their staff on eyeying customers up and how much alcohol to serve them. I used to be a bartender years ago and they seem to be more concerned with money than with customer safety. #2 It was fairly crowded on a friday night but it shouldn't take 20minutes just for the waitress to ask us our drink orders and another 20-30 minutes just to get them. #3 we drove all the way from Hudson ohio about an hour to see the comedy show here but the staff kept the televisions on the ENTIRE time !?!!?!? I could barely hear most of the comics jokes because almost everyone in this place was focusing on the tv's and keeping their voices so high. I don't know it just seemed to me why would you have these comics come out and perform but be so rude as to not shut off the tv's ? #4 the place was fairly small inside they devoted alot of space to that bar rather than seating which seems strange with the type of menu/environment they seem to be promoting i dont know it's just very confusing like it seems they're trying to cater to the sports crowd/fine dining crowd/bar crowd and family crowd all at once and to me that seems like a disaster waiting to happen on any given night. #5 All the staff seemed to be dressed quite well but there was this one girl in a pink sheer shirt with a black bra that you could see right through it..........i don't know how or why anyone let that happen it's tacky i mean this was a restaurant not a strip club. #6 the layout a the inside is all wrong i don't know who designed it but i shouldn't have to be confronted with kitchen staff every 5minutes passing by me with dirty smelly pots/pans etc.......and it was just kind of interrupting ya know ?

All in all i don't think im going to go back to this place again.........the experience just left a dirty taste in my mouth and i feel the manager could have handled that night so much better. I mean they knew alot of people would be coming that night and it just seemed they were more focused on the bar and not on anyone else as much and for all the food and drinks we ordered just between the 8of us.........they should have been paying just as much attention to us and our needs.

Oh yea we tried sticking around after the comedy but they had some TERRIBLE Dj come on playing AWFUL music.........seriously are you gonna tell me you think everyone only listens to RAP/R&B ? No sir you are a failure as a DJ you're just using the music you like and know. So we left immediately. Im gonna say a very big NEVER AGAIN to this place."}
{"text":"I'm not one for going places I know I'll run in to people but this is quite a bar. HUGE outdoor patio and bar with a DJ on the weekend. They have a pretty good selection of beer....and ciders! Still the only place I've found that serves Hornsby's, which is my absolute favorite. The pizza is so good. I haven't had much else to eat here but from what I understand, it's more of a party place.

There is a volleyball court in the back that I have played on many times. All in all, a great time for a group of friends."}
{"text":"Nothing has changed. New owners same cold bad food. Service is slow and the customers are obnoxious. Their pop is always flat and the drinks are made by girls who probably have never bartended before. Disappointed"}
{"text":"Terrible service it took 2 hours to get cheap bar food. The manager did not seem to think waiting 2 hours for a hamburger was an issue. Will never eat at this restaurant again food was terrible. It took 45 minutes just to get a house salad. Manager needs to take a training class on hospitality did not care about anything."}
{"text":"Always a good time at The Grille.  Excellent neighborhood bar that also caters to non-regulars.

The menu is expansive and my two \"must have's\" are the flaming cheese and anything that can be eaten with the signature \"Yummy Sauce\" (which is everything).

While the food prepared is not at a fast food pace (it's not meant to be) its worth the wait (and there is plenty to keep you busy). Order up an appetizer play some Keno and enjoy the atmosphere and if you happen to make new friends (everybody is very friendly there) than that's a bonus.

The wait for a table during the wintertime may be 20 minutes or so (on a busy night), but where isn't these days. During the summer there is plenty of seating outdoors to enjoy signature dishes and signature drinks.

Sign up at their web page or follow them on Facebook for their happennings and chefs specials during the week."}
{"text":"This is the kind of bar you see on bar rescue. Where is Jon Taffer when you need him?"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this restaurant. My fiancé and I go here about once a week. And we know the whole menu. Never had a bad meal here. 

It's a very relaxing spot. With phenomenal views of Phoenix. The sunset is mesmerizing when sitting on the patio. Will always be back. Amazing staff as well!"}
{"text":"Great neighborhood spot with fantastic meals and great cocktails. I've never had anything bad on the menu, and absolutely love the great customer service. So friendly!

Great patio for groups in the back alongside a VERY long bar. Also have volleyball courts and cornhole boards for the actively minded."}
{"text":"WORST EXPERIENCE IN A RESTAURANT EVER.

I still cannot even believe what happened at the Grille on 8/9/16.
I dined with 3 friends on a warm evening and decided to sit on the patio. Hostess took us to our seats and when we were finally greeted by our waitress, she chastised us for sitting outside. She had an attitude right from the get-go, she clearly did not want to wait tables outdoors.  It was our first time at the Grille, so we had a lot of questions about the menu, portions, etc to which our waitress answered. Annoyed, but answered. Our drinks arrived a little delayed, delivered by a bartender. We were the only table outside and there were few cars in the lot, so we didn't imagine it would be busy. Service was slow enough you would have expected a full house.

Most of our food came out together, but of course delivered by someone other than our waitress. In the lull between ordering and delivery, the waitress never brought any condiments, napkins, silverware or anything. The food came and we had to wait to eat it because of this. My friends split a cheeseburger and there was nothing with it. No pickles, lettuce, tomato, onion... so friend asks waitress for at least some pickles. Waitress says haughtily 'well you could have had some pickles if you'd have asked for them!'. She arrives moments later with a plate of pickle spears.
My companions have all started eating and are nearly finished, but my food has not yet arrived. 6 lousy teriyaki wings. Then all of a sudden, a short angry man comes walking over with the wings and THAT'S WHEN SHIT WENT DOWN. He was yammering on about something then said 'Who has the wings?' when I replied he literally DROPPED the plate in front of me and said 'Here's your fuckin wings'. Our jaws hit the table once we realized he was not kidding around. He (THE OWNER!) was clearly upset over something he thought we said about fat, bald Greek men and was screaming and causing quite a commotion. He told us he didn't need us making all that noise in his restaurant and he didn't want people like us in his restaurant. Now he's walking around our table like a circling shark, he is clearly out of his GD MIND. 

I am certainly not going to touch the food he brought and now my husband is MAD so we ask for the check and get ready to leave. Angry guy says \"GET THE FUCK OUT. I own this place, I have plenty of money and don't need yours.\" My girlfriend and I start walking out at this point. Other friend stops to ask the bartender for the check instead, but bartender just shakes his head and says 'He said not to....'  Husband asked people at the bar if we were being too loud and they all said \"No, he just goes off like that sometimes\".  Wait, so this is normal? And totally acceptable?

I would normally offer a fair review and comment on the taste of the food, prices, atmosphere, etc. But in this case, I couldn't care less what the rest had to offer. The food tasted like tears and bad business and the place looked like failure.
Not only will I never again patronize this establishment, I will go out of my way to tell people to never come here.

I have never been so insulted in all my life.
Still looking for the zero star rating..."}
{"text":"Used to go there a lot a few years ago. About a year ago went back, I never thought it was great, but ok. 6 months later went again with family. This place has gotten so filthy! Menus are greasy covered with fingerprints. On the deck waitress forgot we were there. Ordered Philly cheesesteak sandwich which was inedible! Cubes of tough meat, I couldn't be chewed. And with a faint odor. Bread was hard on ends, I won't ever go back."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with the family. The waitress was great, very interactive with the whole family and also accommodating with special orders for the kids. The food came out in a timely manner and was great! Would definitely recommend this ace to anyone."}
{"text":"ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE! NEVER AGAIN. I was visiting my younger sister and her family in Brunswick last weekend and we opted to order some take-out. After deciding what we wanted, she suggested The Grille, as they have eaten here many times before and it's also very close to their home. We consulted two of their online menus for some options (including the one on Yelp) and called in to order 3 dozen buffalo style wings. My sister went to pick up the order and came back incredibly frustrated, as they charged her double the price of what they are listed for online and what they have always paid in the past. Not one to complain, we strongly urged her to call the restaurant to have them explain. She spoke to the young lady (whom she had paid for the order) and was told that they had recently changed their menu and the prices were different. 12 dozen wings were now $15,95 instead of $8,95. $15,95 for a dozen wings?? I live in San Diego where the cost of living is through the roof and not even here would anyone charge $16 bucks for wings. Our total bill was almost $50 for 3 dozen wings. The four of us could have gone out to dinner for that amount.  The young lady apologized for the confusion, explained she was a manager and asked my sister to come back in so that she could credit her the difference. So, my brother-in-law got in the car and drove back to the establishment. Upon his arrival, he was met by the owner who decided they would absolutely not be refunding their money... those are the new prices and that's it. There was no apology. There was no compromise. Nothing. And as far as making him drive back there, after he was told he'd get a refund?...touch luck. The owners should be horrified and embarrassed by their level of customer service. Please, please give your money to a place who actually values you AND your business. Apparently, The Grille does not. Stay away."}
{"text":"The bar and grill are nice great service excellent food a very friendly lead bartender talked golf with no complaints about the bar and grill what so ever had some good beers and the queso."}
