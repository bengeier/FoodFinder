{"text":"I graduated from CBS in 2012 and it was the one of the best decisions I've ever made. 5 years later I'm running and staffing my own Cocktail service in New Orleans, LA called \"Belle of the Bar\" and have created and executed custom menus for small (10) and large (800+) restaurants, parties, and events all over town. Before I went to CBS, I knew absolutely nothing about alcohol, but after my first class I had immediately fallen in love, not with just the thought of being able to have a trade and sustain myself, but to do something creative because I had learned and loved the science behind it all. Thank you Will and everyone at CBS, my week (yup, I finished in a week even though they allow a whole year) was so informative and fun, even when class was over I couldnt pry myself from behind the bar, it was the best money I ever spent."}
{"text":"I attended the Cleveland Bartending School in feb of 2009.   One year and one month later,  Im very proud to say I'm living in Seattle WA, and am a full time bartender at an awesome bar/restaurant called the Pig n Whistle.  I strongly believe the knowledge and confidence I gained from the course (and the AMAZING teachers I had like June,  and TONY JONES!)  gave me the tools I needed to control my own destiny.  I love the job and the industry,  (and the MONEY!)    My advice to anyone attending or considering attending this course is too apply yourself,  learn EVERYTHING you can, and retain it because it is ALL relevant to today's bartender.  Im proof that if you want something bad enough, have amazing people willing to teach you, and you're ready to commit to a new job/lifestyle,   It can happen!  and the Cleveland Bartending School  will help you!!!!!!!!!!!"}

Part of a national chain of bartending schools, Cleveland Bartending School is ironically located inside of a medical building. They have famous instructors who teach regularly there, including the bartender from the Barley House in Cleveland who was named the best bartender in Greater Cleveland by the Plain Dealer and its readers. They teach through repetition -- that is, every student makes each drink over and over again until memorized. Best of all, you are simply guaranteed to land a job upon graduation. Bars, restaurants, and catering companies post job listings regularly, assuring that even the worst graduate can land a job.

The classroom is not a traditional classroom but rather a fully-functional bar, complete with Top 40 music, a jukebox, and a disco ball (you know, because all bars are designed like this is still 1977). Compared to the other school I was looking at, this is far better. Classes are extremely flexible -- you only have to have 40 hours of training in order to be certified.

My only qualm was the price. It was $795/month, which is expensive even though the guy who gave me the tour assured me that I would be able to make that money back in two weeks. Meanwhile, the low-quality place in North Canton I found on Craigslist was only $195; however, finding a job there is difficult because of how they teach prospective bartenders to pour drinks. So I guess it's a matter of choice: Do you go for the top-notch bartending school with the expensive tuition or the low-quality bartending school with a very small tuition? If I had more money, I would definitely choose going here as opposed to the dirt-cheap bartending school."}
