{"text":"Fresh cooking, everything is local and authentic. I always enjoy eating at Three Star when I make it back to Lorain."}
{"text":"Three star is the first Diner I ever went to. My father used to work at the steel mill across the street from the diner. The diner is still has the same short order cooks and waitresses as were there when I was in high school. Its situated on the \"south side \" of the city. 

The diner has an open menu all day, which was great for me because I could never decide if I wanted to have a hungry man breakfast special which offered both locally made sausage and bacon or Greek Roasted Chicken. It never mattered because at the prices that were given at three star, you could eat til your heart's content. 

This place is old school, the waitress gives you your soda in a can with a glass of ice, breakfast is less than 5 bucks, and old men line the counter with walking canes, newspapers and cups of coffee."}
