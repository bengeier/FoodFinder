{"text":"Good for groups.  This place was surprisingly busy (and loud) on a Monday night. Kitchen was a bit slow, most likely because there weren't too many cooks staffed for the night.  The food was flavourful and of high quality. Ordered fried pork chops and fried fish. They were a little greasy, and brushed with butter and salt. A bit too salty for my taste.   Veggies (snow pea) were good. Nicely cooked and no 'old' pieces. Whomever is stocking the kitchen is doing a good job.   I probably would come here again."}
{"text":"We celebrated Chinese New Year with 13 of our friends which made it lucky 14 in the calendar.   The food was served banquet style , but the server individually gave us our serving. Overall the food was decent and yes, compared with the average Chinese restaurant, it is slightly higher. However, compared with a western style restaurant, it was acceptable.   Some food could be improved : yes, they served shark fin soup which was more chicken than shark which was okay in my books.   They had an innovative  dish: stuffed conch Portuguese style. It was unique but probably not worth the high price of the dish. The deep fried flounder fish  was a bit oily and could be improved if they waited longer to drain the fish.  Other dishes were quite good like fried chicken and vegetables with oyster .   They could also use better sound panels as we had to \"share\" the loud partying noise of the fellow guests next door. Forth story our comprehension of mandarin are poor so it became background noise. :)   However the grand finale came when the owner and he staff all came in to sing happy birthday to one of our friends. This was my first  Chinese place where they have live singers.  Mind your the singing was hilariously non professional but their efforts were appreciated.   Food, a OK but the service was  very personal and attentive."}
{"text":"There aren't a lot of options to choose from if you're someone who doesn't want to spend more money for XL and SP dishes. The food isn't that great either. None of our dishes or even our tea was hot. Portions are small, so you can expect to feel hungry afterwards. Also, there is a long wait for your food. I came here early in the morning on a weekend and it wasn't as packed as other places I've been to. But, somehow, the pace the food comes out is extremely slow. All in all, there are better and cheaper places that offer the same foods. This place isn't worth it, in my opinion."}
{"text":"I've been here twice for dinner now. Once for a birthday and once just for a normal family dinner. The service here is great! There is a guy who sings happy birthday enthusiastically (quite the performance!) and the food is good. It's great for families with younger kids too as there is more space between tables (not cramped like some other restaurants can be).   Both times that I was at the restaurant, I noticed that they had signs on the wall for an event. I wasn't there during the event, but I have heard friends attending weddings at this restaurant."}
{"text":"Quality of food is great except for desserts (it varies from time to time). I agreed that this restaurants has way too many large tables. So you might need to wait for a longer time on the weekends if you plan to have lunch in a small group.   We had our baby's celebration there. But we found that they were overbooked on that night so the tables were pretty packed with little room between tables.   We will for sure going back for dim sum and dinner but might not consider for special celebration."}
{"text":"Cost: on the high side Quality: good - 80% Decor: good - 85%  Value: good - 80%  Keeper? Yes will go back for dim sum"}
{"text":"We went to this place tonight and ordered jellyfish ($8.75) as appetizer. The dishes were tasty and we were happy until we got our bill saying the jellyfish was $18. When we asked the waitress she just said the person who took our order made a mistake and gave us the large size instead of small size. But aren't you supposed to write it on the menu if you have different size and different price for anything? Had we know we were ordering an appetizer more expensive than our main dish we would definately go with something else. No effort was made trying to resolve this but only \"sorry\" - I wouldn't be writing this review here if \"sorry\" works. Just a tip for you all to make sure you are ordering the same thing you ended up paying for. We will definately not go to this place again."}
{"text":"Came here numerous time for dim sum and their early bird special is pretty good, $2.60 for S/M/L and the quality of the food is pretty good considering the price you are paying. Service is pretty fast too. Usually order the shrimp dumpling but the last time I I found the skin too thick and chewy for both the shrimp and veg steamed dumplings...always ordered the pumpkin congee and they usually came out okay the  rice rolls with fried dough are always nice, oh and the fried sesame balls with egg yolks are soooo good arrived hot at the table and when you bite into it mmmmm overall will return for early special"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time for dim sum.  Arrived for 9:00 opening so no problem getting seated.  The restaurant is nicely decorated.    The dim sum was just OK.  For the early morning special, it is $3.10 -S,M,L.  XL-5.50.  Ordering is from the forms, not carts.  They have a few things that are different than the usual dim sum choices.  The quality was just OK.  Not much better than the dim sum you get for $2.80.  Choices like the har gow is XL here which is usually in the S to L category in other restaurants.  Also, the cheung har fun is XL, all other cheung fun is L.  It only had 2 shrimps per piece.  For $5.50 you would expect 3 pieces.  Service was just OK."}
{"text":"Came here once for dim sum and once for dinner - and that's it!!!  Quality of dim sum definitely not worth the price ($2.90/dish). I would pay $1.90 for such quality and presentation. Food came out slow - we had the first dish and had to wait 15 mins for the next one.  Lack of service - took forever to refill our teapot.   Dinner was even worse. We ordered the $199 set dinner for 10 people. The Peking duck was not \"shiny\" - looks like day old. No fresh steamed fish in a set dinner - only 10 pieces of fillet served with sweet and sour sauce. Rice and E-fu noodles were tasteless. Two kinds of dessert soup were served, but both looked scary - I didn't try. The best item was the walnut cookie, which I bet was ordered from a bakery.  I will never come back again. Bye!!"}
{"text":"YES I am a fan of this dim sum place in this vicinity.  I actually came here for a couple of times for the chinese brunch dimsum. I must say almost every time there was a wait. It is just that popular in this area. However, I assure you the wait is worth it.   They have great selection of dimsum, fried rice and other typical cantonese cuisine. Their service is good and friendly. Restaurant is clean and tidy overall. I would say it is a decent experience. If you are in this area and are interested in grabbing some dimsum. This wont be a bad idea."}
{"text":"The owner of the restaurant must have read the previous criticism about too many large tables because upon my visit the place had plenty of small tables available. They also seemed to have fixed the service as well, although it wasn't anything exceptional, it was attentive enough for a Chinese restaurant. I came here in the afternoon to eat dim sum, and I like how they have unique items that are different from the usual sui mais and bbq pork dumplings. After all, it can get kind of boring when you're just ordering the classics all the time. One particular item that stood out to me is a fried item with sticky rice and seaweed. Forgot the exact name, and the description sounds weird, but I personally really enjoyed it and found that it was very nicely portioned. Overall a decent yum cha destination for me to add in to my dim sum rotation =)"}
{"text":"U can't beat their prices for dim sum!  Depending on time of day, I would say the average price per dish is $3.  They have a clean interior, good service, and good food.  I went on weekdays and it seemed (surprisingly) better than the weekend dim sum.  Go figure."}
{"text":"We booked ahead of time maybe around 2 weeks in advance before coming here to celebrate the Lunar New Year a family celebration. We came on a Sunday evening on the Family Day long weekend. It was quite busy and packed to the timing of the year. Our session was closed off by makeshift walls so the noise levels weren't a concern but I can imagine during dim sum and regular dinner time it would be quite noisy.   Overall the food is mediocre and the service could be better.   The pricing of this restaurant is on the higher end, similar to Casa Victoria. We probably had a 10 course meal which cost around $600 per table of 10 people. The courses include the following with my comments:   Started off with the meat platter which includes jellyfish, barbecue pork, duck and chicken feet. Overall this was a good place to start with, the meat were tender and flavorful. The jellyfish was cooked just right.   Next day served shrimp ball which was fried and seasoned with sliced almonds. You use vinegar as a side sauce to dip it in.  This was crusty on the outside and tender on the inside.  Not sure if it's real shrimp though.   Favorite dish is the seafood and vegetable conch shell. It is baked and if you like celery then this is your dish.  It is loaded with Portuguese sauce and diced veggies, mostly celery. The seafood pieces include squid, shrimp and scallops.  Extremely tasty!   Lobster was about 5 lbs,  it was enough for 10 people.  Standard Chinese style with green onions and ginger. Nothing bad about it, but nothing amazing either.   Service was average because we only had 1 server for 2 tables so it was quite slow.   The good thing though,, is that they allowed us to BYOB for wine and beer. They provided free pop and tea."}
{"text":"Great place for dim sum. Love the variety. Quality is pretty good. Service is definitely acceptable for Chinese restaurant. You'll find both classics and modern dim sum here. Price is not too scary for a place like this and type of food you get. My problem is always ordering too much because everything looks good. Waiter was great, reminded us we have ordered too much and to trim our order down based on #people. Where are you going to find that kind of sincere helpfulness?  Note: In the west end, we don't have any dim sum places that even come close to this level. So, I must give this place a 5 star since we've been deprived of good dim sum."}
{"text":"During our stay in Markham, my fiance's family and I decided to have dim sum here since we didn't have dim sum during our entire trip. The restaurant was pretty spacious and great for dim sum with a big group or even for dinner.   The dim sum menu was Hong Kong Style, everyone just checks off what kind of dim sum they want as well as how many dishes of each. The English description of the dim sum dish was pretty clear and to the point, no confusion at all. The staff are pretty quick, efficient, and helpful. There's a server that brings you the dim sum and separate server that takes away your empty dishes and bowls.   The dim sum was very fresh and excellent quality. I can't forget about the size of the shu mai and all of the other dim sum dishes we had. They were like the size of my fist! It was humongous compared to what we have here in NYC. Unfortunately, they don't serve coffee or any specialty drinks except for hot tea, water, and soda.  Overall, my fiance's family and I were happy with the experience here and the quality of food. I would definitely love to come back to enjoy the delicious dim sum!"}
{"text":"Edit: It's been 3 months and I've revisited my feelings for this place. Definitely a 2 star.   Sigh...I should give Golden Duke 2 stars. I should. But I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt here because it was Chinese New Year, and all the staff were really hustling. I've also had dim sum here before and it was acceptable.   Unless it's a \"dinner and show\" or banquet kinda situation, I don't think dinner should ever take 3.5 hours. Literally, we were there from 7pm to 10:30pm. At 9pm, half of the menu had still not arrived. People around us had 2-3 dishes on their tables and half the time, we had 0. It got to the point where my grandparents started falling asleep.   The story might be different if the food was really delicious and was worth the wait. But it was so mediocre. It was just, heavy, mediocre, Chinese food. Quantity didn't even make up for the lack of quality. For the amount we paid, we could've definitely gotten more. The abalone dish was just thin slices of abalone. The geoduck dish had so little geoduck, if you were lucky, you'd get a tiny morsel of it and that's it.   Because the wait was so long, we just sat there until we got full. But then more food would come, so then we'd stuff ourselves with more unexceptional food. By the end of the night, I was filled with the uncomfortable feeling of grease and disappointment. Sigh...why am I not giving this place 2 stars again? (Edit: I did it).   (13/100) - 2018"}
{"text":"First time in this restaurant. Dim sum is very average. Service is good. Can not say there is anything special."}
{"text":"Dim sum before 11am is reasonable and the quality and flavors are well done.  It's the modern cart-less dim sum is pretty well organized. Parking lot fills up quickly so the earlier the better."}
{"text":"We came here for a big family dinner and looking to try somewhere new. We had been here for dim sum before but never tried dinner. We had a 10 person banquet meal. I had high expectations given the decor and setting. The dishes tasted great and on par with other great Chinese restaurants uptown. Not overly expensive based on the banquet meal we ordered. Portions are big. Lobster was fresh and delicious. Not everyone does it well. Restaurant is neat and tidy inside organized and tablecloths. Washrooms are nice but looks like needs some updating. Overall fine dining experience for Chinese food. Service was attentive and friendly. We will come back again."}
{"text":"I came here for a friend's birthday dinner. I live downtown, so getting up to Hwy 7 and McCowen was a bit of a hassle and the parking in the plaza that this restaurant is at, I have to say, is awful. There are many restaurants in this plaza and very limited parking space. So if you plan to come to this restaurant, I would highly recommend, come early and car pool if possible to get a parking spot, especially on Friday evenings and weekends.   Now back to the restaurant.... this restaurant when I walked in, I thought it was rather cramped. The table that we were at was even worse as we were 13 people with a baby high chair. The chairs were those big chairs with the covers (you see these types of chairs in Chinese restaurants that try to be super fancy). As D and I was late, due to traffic, when we got there our friends have already started eating. They ordered the Peking Duck set dinner menu. The food quality I thought was average and the portion size was kind of small. The servers there were all nice but I think they are under staffed (in my opinion) so it was a bit hard to get their attention. That evening, the dishes also came out very slow. The price per person was not that cheap either.   Overall, I think this restaurant is just average."}
{"text":"The wait staff here is quite friendly as long as you are used to typical Chinese wait staff.   We have been here for dim sum and dinner and both are great.  They're standards have been quite consistent which is rare for Chinese restaurants.  Usually they're good for a few years and then skimp on quality and quantity.  Not here.  They choose the freshest vegetables and don't over salt their food.  We had the same guy-lan (Chinese broccoli) in the same week and Golden Duke's was a rich emerald green and tender whereas next door's Congee Queen had this washed out light green without flavour.  It's hard to go elsewhere when the food is this good."}
{"text":"I've been to the Golden Duke Chinese Cuisine restaurant for Dim Sum three or four times.  The Pros: Quality is consistent Quality of food is excellent Service is good Selection of food is good  The Cons: A bit more pricey than other Dim Sum restaurants You need to arrive early or you will be waiting for a long time.  Highlights: Peking Duck with Pancake wrap The chicken (moist and flavourful)  I would recommend this restaurant but the thought of one less available table does not appeal to me. So please, stay away ;)"}
{"text":"If I had written this review before I encountered Tak Fu, I would've put a 4.   Service was par for dim sum places: they acknowledged our existences and we got food that was cooked and followed Ontario's health and safety regulations.   Cutlery and utensils were fairly clean. It's a safe choice for dim sum. Nothing stands out too much here...   As usual, my gauge for quality at dim sum places is the ha gow. This place did not pass for me. Skin was too thick, the shrimp inside was not springy enough. Taste was not fresh enough.  A secondary gauge is siu mai, which is another staple and heavyweight of most dim sum places. If you mess this up, you better have other dishes that are proof of a higher power. Their siu mai had tendons or bits that you can't really chew. The pork was sort of blasé but loaded with MSG.   Tea was inconsistent. Sometimes it was great after the first refill, and sometimes it was literally just bland leaf water no matter how many times it's refilled or steeped.   We have a VIP card here so that's why we come. It's not bad, but it isn't the best. I guess it's comfort food if you're up for Chinese izakaya."}
{"text":"Golden Duke is a good option for dimsum nearby Markville Mall.   We came here at 10:30am for the early bird special and it was absolutely packed but luckily got seated and made our orders before the 11am cutoff. And just a heads up, apparently you need to pay using cash if you get the early bird pricing. We already know that we should be using cash for dimsum, but still, I like using my card.  The food here is pretty good. Everything was of your typical dimsum fare, and nothing was out of the ordinary. You're safe ordering any of the standard dishes! Considering what you pay, this isn't a bad deal at all. 9 items came out to $40 with tax and tip.    Service here was pretty fault-less with the exception of one of the waitresses who messed up by checking off one of the wrong ones and it just threw one of the others ladies off. It was a simple mistake, and it wasn't a big deal, but it took her a really long time."}
{"text":"My family decided to try something new on Mother's day. This place was chosen because my cousin recommended it. But since we are slightly paranoid we came first for dim sum. So here's my two-cents on both.   Yum cha: *  We went on a weekday so there wasn't much people. What I saw was mostly white-washed Asians (no offense but I personally think that if there's not a lot of Chinese Chinese people at a Chinese restaurant, it usually says something about the food. Same goes for Korean people at a Korean restaurant etc etc.) I had hoped I was wrong in my crowd assessment. Sadly, I was not. The food was terrible. They failed my three main dim sum test for restaurant quality. 1- siu mai: although not bad, it wasn't completely good either. Subpar  2- rice noodles: terrible. It arrived drenched in oil. Even with Dai Fu's drop in quality, it's still better than this abomination.  3- beef balls: something that should not be hard to f-up they managed to do it spectacularly. There was a pungent taste to even though it wasn't spoiled.  Even though there wasn't a lot of costumers, service was slooow.  The red tea we got was pretty smooth even though it wasn't hot enough.   Dinner: **** Given the terrible dim sum experience, I had reservations about dinner. However the food was surprisingly good. I don't know if it was because it was a Mother's day special and everyone ordered the same set but the food- the fish, lobster, shrimps, abalone were all well made. The price was really good for the set dinner. Service was still incredibly slow though."}
{"text":"I can't believe it that I haven't even reviewed this place since I've been going there for years. This is my number one go to dim sum restaurant Markham. Nothing special. The usual stuff like beef balls, shrimp dumplings, but everything just tastes so much better. Only downside is parking in this trip was pretty bad especially on weekends. Not a coincidence at Congee Queen is in the same strip mall. Both places tend to get really busy so come early."}
{"text":"We come here pseudo-regularly for dimsum on the weekends and I've been here for dinner a few times now. Dinner is really good value considering they price themselves a little higher up. For dinner, they don't offer a complimentary generic soup of the night, so those are things you would need to order extra, but the size, quality and type of food they give you is amazing. For example, when we ordered half a chicken for dinner, it came with \"jelly string\" which is usually something you'd pay extra for as a side - so that was a fantastic surprise! Their dinner is also occasionally fully booked for different corporate or family events, so I always, always recommend making a reservation in advance.  Their dimsum is a little less spectacular, but still nice nonetheless. They have cheaper dimsum before around 11am, so the only time there's a lineup for dimsum is during the specials period. But after the special, so during the regular priced hours, there is almost no line-up, and you'll be able to get seated almost immediately. Their prices aren't the most economical, their kitchen dishes like noodles and rice after 11am are great value though - so I'd definitely recommend those if you're coming closer to noon. One last note is that sometimes you can get a 10% off if you pay by cash during the regular hours. And two final caveats about this place is that their variety/choice in dimsum is fairly small and the restaurant itself is small, so seats fill up faster and you end up waiting a little longer to get a seat."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times for dim sum before and once for dinner. The first time I came for dinner a while back it was packed. This time I came for dinner there were two different parties but the other tables were not full. This leads me to suspect that it's not full generally on a Saturday night which doesn't bode well I think.  With that said though, I thought the food was pretty good and it wasn't too expensive. It wasn't cheap but it wasn't expensive.  We ate: - Peking Duck two ways, one with the flour wrap and the remains with the lettuce wrap - Salt and Pepper fried Eel - Lotus Root and pork pancakes - Snow Pea Shoots  Six people for dinner at $120 after tax and tip, not bad.  The place is quite bright and spacious. The staff, it might of been because it was not full so they came around quite a bit. Two types of dessert, either cashew or almond chinese dessert and also comes with some almond cookies and coconut jelly.  I'd come again for this meal. I should mention the couple times I've come for dim sum have always been on a Saturday morning for early morning special prices. It was packed as well every time I came. Food was pretty good too."}
{"text":"This place is not that good. If you are doing a banquet with your family, there are much better, cheaper options elsewhere.   My family was here for a a regular banquet style dinner yesterday. The food wasn't bad, but it was all pretty standard: Roasted pig and jellyfish, veggies, scallops, shrimp and fish, etc... However, they did have a conch shell filled with celery and carrots in a curry-ish cream sauce. It was very strange, but not bad. I'm sure it was supposed to have some shellfish in it, but all we saw/tasted were minced veggies.  The total came up to $530 for our table of 11 people. That's almost $50 per person for just okay food. For that price you could go to many other Chinese seafood restaurants and get better quality food.   Maybe their dim sum is better?"}
{"text":"Food is great and service and staff was efficient and very attentive.  The food doesn't seem like its loaded with MSG....so I enjoyed it a lot.  I'll definitely be coming back considering it's so close to home!"}
{"text":"Good quality dim sum at a convenient location. This is my family's go to spot for weekend brunch. Their prices are slightly higher than other dim sum spots around, but the quality and big portions make up for the difference."}
{"text":"3.5* for dim sum. My most recent go-to place for convenience, comfortable spacious seating in a bright space, decent food and no line up! The only place I know that has Pork Liver Rice Roll (one of the reasons for returning). The Lotus Leaf Chicken Rice is good too. Overall decent food, and good deal for lobster @ $5/lb.   AVOID: - Deep fried bitter melon - very thick batter (as opposed to thin salted egg yolk coating), giving it a very unpleasant appearance that resembles bugs.  - Shredded Chicken & Jellyfish - this was okay, but the jellyfish is on the thick side, the chicken a bit dry/rough"}
{"text":"This was my first time coming to this restaurant. It was the dinner venue following a golf tournament that I played in so this may not be a typical review. A section of the restaurant was partitioned and reserved for us. I believe we had around 80 players/diners.  Our banquet consisted of several courses, starting with Peking Duck, served in two courses. We also had scallops with broccoli, crab meat with fish maw soup (one of my favourites), lobster, fish, fried rice, and noodles. Dessert included almond cookies, a jelly, and red bean soup.  Everything tasted good and the service was excellent. Our servers took good care of us, replenishing our tea and water frequently, and clearing empty plates. It was a good enough experience that I would go back to try other dishes."}
{"text":"This is my favorite dim sum place coz they take reservation; and even on weekends.  The food here is good and service is attentive.  I haven't thought about writing a review until after trying their moon cake.  This is my first time to get moon cakes from a restaurant.  The moon cakes here are freshly made.  The lotus seed paste is soft, moist and is just in the right amount of sweetness.  The duck egg yolk has oil oozing out at the time I cut the cake in half. Each cake is individually packed in a nice paper box, and they sell in a box of 4.  Full moon in September will turn me into a \"moon-cake-eater\"; and I can do \"chained-moon-caking\"!!  I'll sure go back for more moon cakes.  Five stars for the moon cake and four stars for dim sum."}
{"text":"Time to update the review.  This time it was for a dim sum experience.  The verdict was the same: 3 stars.  The dim sum tasted all right.  Definitely better quality than the dim sum at a flat-priced restaurant, but it was average for a non flat-priced dim sum place.  Services were slow."}
{"text":"Based off dim sum only.  Arrived at around 10:20am and got seated at 10:40am Placed our order before 11am so that we could take advantage of the early bird special  where S,M, L dishes are all the same price.  Service was very friendly and quick. The only fall back with the service was that they forgot two of our dishes so we had to wait a bit longer than normal for the final two dishes to arrive. The place was super busy and stuff happens so its totally acceptable and no points deducted :)  The food was really good and all made fresh to order. I liked all the dishes we ordered except for one. The tofu fa was not really smooth and a bit too thick, but other than this everything was excellent."}
{"text":"The dim sum is good, but if you go after 11am, be prepared to pay extra.  Pricing was quite high as my hubby and I order 7 dim sums and it came to $43 with tax.  Food was good mind you.  Will come back, just maybe before 11am, lol"}
{"text":"I came here for dim sum on Chinese New Years. Price is definitely on the moderate to high end when compared to other dim sum places but I enjoyed it.  Staff: We were greeted and seated quite promptly. They didn't have a lot of seating options because of the holiday, so many were reserved. They cleared dishes away quite frequently which was appreciated. One of the food servers marked one of our dishes to a large when it was suppose to be medium but when we brought it to her attention she fixed it and comped our tea charge. Great service!  Ambience: The seating was comfy and the utensils were nice; no chipping like some other dim sum places. There was plenty of space to maneuver around and did not feel cramped.  Food: Everything was delicious. The Siu Mai and Har Gow were very big so it makes up for the higher prices. The flavours were on point for me, but they needed to put more care into presentation because food was stuck on the side of the trays and stuck to each other.  I'll definitely return, but the price of the dishes ($2 to $6 per dish) will make this a place only for special occasions for me."}
{"text":"Came on a Sunday for dinner with a group of 4. Please note we ordered way more then we should have but the food and service and atmosphere was really good for an Asian restaurant.  Had total of 6 dishes and complimentary dessert of almost sweet soup and tea pudding and a almond cookie.  The best was the shrimp it was the size of my palm. Definitely can bring parents here for a get together or first time meeting the parents lol Asian parents will love this place"}
{"text":"Large tables galore...I swear 80% of the restaurant was large tables. Definitely not a place for 1-3 people.  We ordered the $198 for 10 special (though we only had 8 people), and ended up taking about half out.  Consisted of: - Peking Duck - Some kind of shark fin soup, but without the shark fin - Crispy chicken - Fried fish fillet with brocolli - Shittake mushrooms with bok choy - Lobster - Fried rice and e-fu noodles  Considering everything costed $198, I suppose I can't complain much about the quality...the peking fuck, fish fillet (and I'm by no means a fish person!!!), and noodles tasted quite decent. The soup lacked taste (less oil, less salt?). The other dishes were about average.  Service leaves a lot to be desired though...I noticed a lot of times most of the waiters/waitresses were focused in a specific section and not spread out. Not the way to operate a restaurant especially of this size."}
{"text":"Have been back a few more times including the hub's bday, the food is still very good and the service is great. The manager, Gary, is quite lively and runs a good show. This time the whole staff performed 7 renditions of Happy Birthday in different languages!! They truly make you feel welcome. :)"}
{"text":"3.5 I come here very often for dim sum with the family.  Parking is not easy to secure but wait times are reasonable. I don't think their food quality or selection has anything to write home about, but I find the food generally above par. The service is usually lacking imo, if you add dishes after the first round, there's always gonna be that one or two that don't make it within a reasonable time frame (30mins+)."}
{"text":"Very good dim sum, check off your order and it comes steaming hot.  Good space seating, atmosphere is pleasant and nice.  Service is good.  A bit pricey, but it comes hot. Har Gao and Sui Mei is good!  Its a nice treat to get your dim sum hot."}
{"text":"Pretty good. We came here right at 9 am and had a table. Average quality dim sum. The congee was the best out of everything we ordered."}
{"text":"I took an early flight into Toronto in the am and was craving some dim sum and ended up at Golden Duke before 9am. To my surprise, there was already people waiting for the restaurant to open! This was pretty promising although I'm not sure if this is common for most places. The menu had many items that are typical across other dim sum places have as well but one item that stood out to me was the steamed seafood and eel dumpling. It's pretty much a seafood siu mai with eel on top. That I've never seen or had before. The base siu mai was actually pretty decent. It was a new experience to have eel on top and I guess if anything it was different and interesting I'll say. My only gripe was that it was kind of difficult flagging down someone to give us our check to leave/pay."}
{"text":"I had dim sum here. It was pretty pricey.  There were flies everywhere. There was a spider on the curtains.  The food was alright but pricey for regular Chinese food. The only thing that stood out was the custard egg yolk bun. That was amazing. But expensive. I don't think I'd ever come back, it was just dirty and not worth it for me."}
{"text":"The dimsum here was alright but the fried noodles were amazinggggg, they fry it and seperate it from the sauce so the noodles maintain crispyness!! highly recommend getting the seafood fried egg noodles!"}
{"text":"OK..from my pictures you'll very quickly notice it was my first time at dim sum. Note to self ordering two orders means a small sharing plate heaped with food not just two pieces like my boyfriend suggested...  From our mountain of food I have to say the food was delicious! We got a bit of everything and some highlights were: -shrimp and chive dumplings, steamed and super light yet filling - bbq runs though they were on the oiler side - the chicken spring rolls not greasy at all - pork dumpling which I had only a bite of because I was majorly stuffed by the time they arrived.  I wasn't a fan of the tea as its loose leaf Nd sone of the leaves seeped into my cup and settled...where the tea strainer at?  This is a no frills spot where they pack plates with food and though the server etiquette ight be slightly lacking, the food is amazing and cheap!  Our bill was pretty whopping but we also ordered enough to feed the army of a small country. I'd suggest calling ahead for a reservation, and note they do accept credit and debit."}
{"text":"Really good contender for the best dim sum in the immediate Markville area. Definitely over-bustling which makes for room for mistakes but when you see the staff working as hard as they were you gotta be somewhat forgiving.  - At 10AM, table of 2 seated immediately. Order was taken promptly by a gentlemen who immediately noticed we weren't Chinese-speaking, asked very kindly if we would like spoons and forks. Always a bonus when they ask instead of assume  - Ordered 1. Congee with spareribs and watercress, 2. Baked chicken puff, 3. Deep fried pork dumpling with sweet corn, and 4. Deep fried taro dumpling - We were tight on time so it was a good thing our orders came immediately, except they gave one of our plates to a table next to us that were seated and put in their order later. The table number on our ticket printed out wrong, so our server scratched it out and rewrote it correctly. However the person who handed out the food still wrongly gave it away to another table even when my partner waved her down her first to let her know it was ours before she handed it off. Because she laughed us off saying \"no, no\", our last plate was not coming at all until our server appeared to check on us and we told him it was given away. The time between the 3rd and 4th plate was 15 minutes, before which we grew more and more unhappy about the matter and ready to leave.  Haven't dined here for dinner but would give them a second chance. 3/5, could of been a 4/5 if I didn't experience the inaccuracy"}
{"text":"I don't know why this place doesn't get better reviews, granted, never been here for dim sum but have had supper here on numerous occasions. We usually come here to celebrate something and it never seems to disappoint even after 3 yrs. My family likes to order seafood a lot and we've had king crab, lobster, steamed bass, scallops with veggies and many more! The food quality is above average as are the prices. I find it acceptable and maybe not better than O Mei or Skyview Fusion Cuisine, but on par without the pretentious pricing (read - not cheap either!). We almost always order a half or full roast suckling pig and the Manager Gary and his staff always ensure we get a top notch pig - kudos to their supplier and Golden Duke's staff for selecting the best ones available. Gary leads his entire front of house staff in multiple renditions of Happy Birthday - in a lot of languages too! For me and my family, we feel welcome and appreciated and will be continuing to support the Golden Duke!"}
{"text":"They are consistent here for dim sum and family dinners are always done right. I usually never comment on dim sum places as they are usually the same across the board but found two notable plates that are unique that must be tasted if you visit.   Scallop Chung fun(noodle roll) - 5-7 baby bay scallops per roll with a touch of spicy BBQ XO sauce and drizzle of oil. It's got a nice Asian smoke with subtle heat and the scallops were juicy being cooked this way. Move over shrimp Chung-fun, you now have competition, just kidding I like you both equally.   Mango sticky rice dessert(not like a Thai dessert dish, they really need a better name) - 4 pieces of soft delicate sticky rice dusted with shredded coconut, stuffed with a fresh mango cube, mango mousse like custard and drizzled with a mango coulis on top. This is way better than the mango pudding fish covered in canned milk!  Downside of this restaurant is the front foyer is badly planned, 2 manual doors that do not accommodate flow of traffic. Go left and be forgotten for a table while getting a seat, go right and if you missed stepping on toes on your way to the hostess or you're probably sitting yourself down. Add hangry dim sumers and impatient guests that try to talk over you while you're getting a wait number from the hostess equals a rough morning.  But lots of parking that's a plus"}
{"text":"Been here several times for dim sum, and it is always top quality.  Go before 10:30am and get the \"large\" dim sum dishes for the price of a \"small\" :) My favourites are the hargow, siumai and beef balls.  It's on the pricier side compared to other dim sum places, but it's worth it for the food quality. My daughter loves this place too!"}
{"text":"came here for dim sum with family. it's actually quite good. you get what you typically expect from a dim sum place and they don't overdo the dishes to make it seem like it's more than what it is: it's not luxury food. one of my favourite things to order at dim sum is a shrimp almost like a wonton that is deep fried and served with mayonaise, they have a dish similar to this but it is in the form of a roll. it was actually better because you got more shrimp out of it, and the shrimp to outer layer ratio per bit is on point. the only thing i have to say is that the carts are not really a common thing anymore, which is good. you order on a paper. however, desserts came first. it makes no sense at all because you eat dessert last, so it just sits there, takes up space, and then servers get frustrated when there's no room to put any food down. this isn't an issue exclusive to this restaurant, all dim sum places do the same thing and something needs to be done about it to bring up the customer experience and also server morale. think about it."}
{"text":"I needed to place my 1000th review for somewhere worthy of a good review and although my fellow Yelper friends don't seem to think too highly of this place, I have to say that my experience here for a fancy dinner for 10 was spectacular and inexpensive.  My mom ordered a banquet set for 10 for less than $300 and we were served with delicious lobsters, fish, peking duck, abalone soup, etc. etc., etc. What was impressive about the place was that no dish was not good. We had a ton of leftovers to take home, and we were so happy eating it for the next two days - haha. The stir-fried lobsters were so good with the yee-mein (noodles) and their fried rice was delicious with their fried fish, bokchoy, and so much more.   If you are looking to do a small chinese banquet food, this is an ideal place to go. I haven't tried their dimsum here, but for what we had experienced for dinner, I would not hesitate to come back."}
{"text":"Came here for dim sum on a weekday during March Break.  We were expecting it to be super packed by not so much.  My cousin and I were seated immediately and began our ordering.  We ordered the usual items anyone would order at a dim sum place so i'm not gonna go much into that.  The quality is pretty much the same as any other \"good\" dim sum restaurant.  Nothing really special but that is not a bad thing.  Overall, we were stuffed by the time we were done and the food was good.  I will return whenever I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times for dim sum and have been happy with the food. It's great value at $2.60/dish for the early bird special, today I went for family day and the price was $5 per dish because it was a holiday. We ordered 7 dishes for 2 people and left stuffed with lots of left overs.  Highlights include the Chicken steamed buns, shrimp rice rolls and papaya steamed cake (dessert). Service was slow to start but bit kicked up after we put in our order. We arrived just after opening and the line up was close to 30 people when we left 45 mins later so be ready to wait! Overall a nice place, I'd def come back for dimsum (not sure about dinner).  UPDATE: Okay, so I came back for dinner! Super happy with the food and service. Ordered crispy chicken and stir fried veg with crystal noodles. They offered free dessert: (GREAT service!) almond soup (sweet think almond milk) and red bean with coconut milk 'cakes'. The almond soup was VERY sweet but grew on me, the red bean cakes had too gelatinous a taste (think jello) and were not my favorite. In fairness they were 20 mins to closing and had run out of other options. Good spot for sure!"}
{"text":"Good: 1. Service - Great service tonight for mother's day.  We were only 8 people and waitress was very accommodating in helping us pack up extra food as we went along our feast for 10.  Plates were changed frequently and certain courses were split and served for us.  She was super friendly and it's rare to see in a Chinese restaurant.  We gave her extra tip at the end for a great job.  2. Food - Pretty standard courses with suckling pig, crab balls, shark fin, etc.  Crab balls, pea shoots, and fish were standouts tonight.  Shark fin soup was underseasoned a little but did not lack in shark fin.  Chicken was a little dry.  Everything else was standard.  3. Wifi - Always nice to have free wifi.  Bad: 1. Parking - It honestly sucks in this plaza with so many eateries and limited parking spaces.  Worth it? Maybe slightly leaning to the pricier side but with the standout service tonight, we were quite pleased.  My parents frequent this place and it's typically a pretty good place to dine."}
{"text":"This review is based on my dinner experience at Golden Duke Chinese Cuisine on a weeknight.  Food though on the more pricey side but taste decent. Services though is quite lacking as the place definitely understaffed.   We shared:  Stir Fried Grouper with Vegetables ($24.99) - The vegetable is nicely done and plentiful - Only a few pieces of fish - Portion size definitely disappointing at this price point! I would not order that again  Braised Tofu with Mushroom ($12.99) - One of the best braised tofu dish I had - Not overly salty but has great oyster sauce flavour - broccoli cooked perfectly - Great portion size and delicious!  Complimentary dessert is Grounded almond paste soup. I can still taste the bite and pieces of almond. One of the better complimentary dessert I had in Chinese restaurants. And almond suppose to be really good for me!   I am now eyeing the $198 lobster/peking duck feast for 10 people.   Golden Duke definitely great for groups and families gatherings."}
{"text":"I like this place for weekend dim sum (as not as crowded as Dragon boat fusion and parking is easier in this plaza). Restaurant is nice, clean, and bright.   Dim sum specials is Mon to Sun 9-11am. I think it's $3 for S,M,L. Not the best but very decent quality. Service was good; they didn't rush us out when we finished. They have oxtails on Dim sum menu (not all places do) and it was very good. Sui mai was good; har gao's shell was too thick and hard. Everything else is typical dim sum. Overall, we had a good experience and will return"}
{"text":"Dim sum review! Below average to average quality, mostly tasteless. Discount before 11am. It gets busy after 11am though.  Service is wonderful!! The restaurant is clean."}
