{"text":"Worst experience ever !!! We saw a banner for 2 chicken sandwiches for $6 while we drove by and saw the word combo too, very misleading if you ate driving by. So we went drive thru and ordered the special for chicken sandwiches and were told it was $10.81, we get to the window and the lady says 12.97 and my fiance asked why the price changes and she said 'oh because the other register charges wrong' my fiance said well shouldnt you honor the $10.81?? She said with a smart remark \"do you want two combos or not\" we said yes, she then answered well pay $12.97 that's when my fiance became a smart ass and said we want them for the price you told UA at the speaker, your machine making a mistake isn't my fault. She slammed the window and went to take a picture of the banner and said \"look its $6/per combo you want it or not??? We asked for a manager and she said she was in charge.. We said we aren't moving until we get our price. She called corporate to ask for an override and said very rudely she wouldn't do it !!!! She went outside the drive thru and took a pic of our plates !!! We moved to avoid the cars behind having problems but this cashier Liz was a terrible person. We asked for something so simple she didn't have to be so rude and unprofessional.. Avoid her !!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Fresh and delicious, went there at two different times. I thoroughly enjoyed the Garlic Buttery Steak Burger (forgot the exact wording). The burger was delicious and the steak was tender a juicy. Writing about it makes me want one."}
{"text":"I ordered the beer battered fish. What I got was 2 & 1\2 pieces of store bought fish sticks. The food was not worth the 2 minutes it took me to drive there. It's a place I would not eat at even if the food was free"}
{"text":"I came in at 1020pm and I guess the lobby was suppose to be closed, I was greeted with a unpleasant face and I ordered a couple items off the menu and sat down to wait for my order , when I received my food it was sloppily made and felt colder then what it should have been.  Stephanie helpful but the food wasn't as great as I thought it could of been"}
{"text":"Love their seasoned fries. Best soft-serve at a fast food restaurant by far."}
{"text":"Four crew members working and they still can't get it together. I ordered one chicken sandwich and it took them 2o min or more. Ridiculous! Atleast the were friendly and chicken was good."}
{"text":"Currently stuck between cars so I am unable to back out of the drive thru...oh wait after 5 minutes the car in front moves,..darn I was fooled they did not even order their food until they got fed up and drove up to the window...it seems that their speaker is broken- you would think that they would put up a sign or something stating that. Now after 2 songs have played on the radio they guy in front is STILL waiting on his food. This is ridiculous!!!    I ordered the chicken strips and fries with honey mustard sauce and 2 apple pies. The chicken strips were more like flattened chicken nuggets, the fries were soggy, and the mustard sauce was old. I opened it and it was solid, not creamy. Then the pies were not fresh either.   This place sucks. I sat and the window watching them move like snails getting my food. I am disappointed. ."}
{"text":"Worst experience and customer service EVER.  Ordered two strawberry cheesecake stackers, went to pay and the rude fat cashier didn't say a word handed me my change and still didn't say a word.  He went to hand me my first stacker and I said, \"Can I please have a holder so they don't fall in my car?\" He still had not said a word and put them in the so call holder and handed them to me and one fell on the floor in my car to my luck.  He noticed and still didn't say anything as he literally slammed the window closed.  I called and told the manager about my experience and she said, \"I'll talk to him.\"  That place needs some serious customer service training.  I will NEVER be back.  I would advise anyone to stay clear from this disgusting neighborhood fast food chain.  I say good day sir!!!"}
{"text":"Fast food really isn't my thing but hell, when you're craving some good fried noms Checker's hits the spot. I had the \"Bacon Roadhouse Burger\", their \"Loaded Fries\", and a banana shake. Burger was satisfying, the fries were perfectly seasoned and the bacon/cheese/ranch combo was perf, and the banana shake was heavenly. Perfect quick bite while on lunch break and definitely a fave late night spot :)"}
{"text":"Had lunch here only because I had coupons.  Got the spicy chicken sandwhich, drink and fries, with the coupon was just under $3....still over priced.  I am still waiting to taste the \"spicy\" in the chicken, don't think that will happen. The ketchup is spicier!  Next time I'm in the mood for a spicy chicken sandwhich, Wendy's here I come"}
{"text":"For them to be as busy as they are they should have more then 3 workers ! The young man working register was Also making ice cream cones with no gloves on ! Not satisfied!"}
{"text":"There's never more than 3 people in here at any given time, however it always takes me 15 to 20 minutes (honestly) before everythings said and done, I have my food and ready to go. (For mediocre food) This last time I was in there, there was one person in there and she was at the counter, and 3 employees behind the counter. One girl was standing behind the food prep table staring at me, another young man was mopping the same spot the whole time I was there and the young lady was busy having a conversation with the one customer that was there.  She looked at me at least 5 times while she was talking to the one customer while looking at her phone. Finally the customer realized that I was standing there for roughly 5 minutes and being ignored and she said something. Then the young men put the mop down and decided he was going to help me now, while the young lady decided to turn around (with phone in hand) and go to the ice cream machine. It's honestly pretty bad customer service here. Also if you don't leave a tip, expect rolled eyes and even worse service. I honestly hope they close  and something else better goes in that location. True review"}
{"text":"This place is pretty lousy..although the food is really good it's just a bit expensive for being a fast food joint..you don't get any ranch with your wings you have to order it & you have to pay a measly 50 cents for it..that's bulls*it because any other place you go ranch is free unless you request extra.. This place charges you for ONE!! besides it's run by a bunch of Mexicans that can't speak English...won't be back..."}
{"text":"I was having trouble deciding on two or three stars, I finally went three because it's a fast food joint and I have lower standards for them.  When I was there the place was clean and the staff was all friendly.  However the food was just kind boring, the burger was small didn't really have much taste.  It wasn't bad but it wasn't good either.  The wings were fine kind of reminded me of cheap bar wings.  They had seasoned fries kind of like popeye's which were pretty good.  I don't think I'd ever go back on my own but I wouldn't say no if I was with people who wanted to go."}
{"text":"I was skeptical of trying this place, however it's a good thing that I did. Great fast food at very reasonable prices. I would definitely recommend trying Checkers."}
{"text":"Great old fashion tasting burgers. Love the fries and the service I had here was a 5/5. Note: It makes a huge difference  if you salt and pepper it at the table."}
{"text":"Very dirty----- burgers are yuk e Charged 42 cents on my card for bbq sauce I had better food off  the taco truck I will never step foot in this place what a mistake"}
{"text":"I would give this location ZERO stars, if it would let me. The girl behind the counter was CLUELESS! I asked what the difference between two burgers was, as the picture looked pretty much the same, she had no idea. I said \"Aren't you supposed to know this stuff?\" To which she answered that she was new. Well shouldn't she ask someone that does know then? What I got, I wouldn't even call a burger. It was paper thin and I'm still starving! I would NEVER come to Checker's again based on this experience."}
{"text":"Not just bad but really really bad.  We ordered a chili dog as meat, chili, and bread only.  It came with mustered and onions.  Ordered the double bacon cheeseburger.  The bacon was so raw that it was completely translucent.  It was way way too salty... couldn't taste anything but salt.  Ordered the half lb chicken bites.  Half the order was good the other half was so under done that they were white and not even really brown.  Waited over 15 minutes for this food at a fast food place.  The staff could care less.  Last time we were there we ordered the wings and asked for them cooked well done and we got home they were all fatty and not even done all the way.  Don't know what this Checkers issue is but they are surely giving all the other checkers restaurants a bad name."}
{"text":"The food here is nasty..burgers are yike the bun is yellow with a dried up beef patty I guess it was a part of the a whooly mammath. The wings are so so skinny lol no meat on them waste if money never going back. Gonna share this with my friends."}
{"text":"Probably one of the worst spots I been to I stopped by to grab something to eat there twice !  1st time I ordered chicken wings , the wait was a little long but not big deal. But when I received my wings they where half frozen !   2nd time they mixed my order up and gave it to another person , I waiting 23 mins until I asked about my order then they told me what happened I waited another 15 mins almost 45 mins for food , so much for fast food !"}
{"text":"Came here few times prior to this review and about same service every time, takes while to get food, but after it took over minutes to get my food it was time to leave a review, when people that ordered after me started to get their orders before I went and waited around to get someone to counter and when asked about my order they said oh we are waiting on fresh fries, what they have to go out and pull up more potatoes to make fries? Everyone that's been in food industry knows that just excuse, they are rude and extremely slow, the other location on rancho is much faster even when it's busy , food was ok again considering how long it took figured my food be fresher consider I waiting on \"fresh fries\""}
{"text":"I am upset that I had to leave one star in order to write the review!   We should've known from the ordering window when the lady didn't want to give us our total for the food until we drove around we should've put the car in reverse and went some where else!  We get to the window and NEVER was greeted with a \"Hello\" or anything just a dry \"it will be $20.68\" from the lady working the window. Remind you we ordered 4 combos, medium size, and she shoved it in all one bag. Okay that's strike 3. Then I asked \"may we have some ranch and ketchup?\" She told us .45 cent for ranch! I'm like \"seriously!?\" \"We just spent $20.00 dollars and we can't have ranch to dip our fries or nothing??\" She replied \"NO!\"   I will never come here again Nor any other CHECKERS for that matter! The food was cold and our burgers were swimming in mustard. To sum it up, the food was disgusting!  I added a picture of the mustard burger cause that's EXACTLY what it was!"}
{"text":"Me and my friends went here a couple days ago and ordered. Our cashier named Devin was great! We had a really big order but our food was done in less than 3 minutes. Also there's another cashier named Danielle who got a big ol booty. This is my new favorite food place."}
{"text":"Hamburger was pretty good. In my opinion fries were just ok. Popcorn chicken was very dry.  All in all just an average fast food burger joint. Nothing spectacular nothing horrible"}
{"text":"every experience I've had at checkers was amazing except for this last one   we got there and we were placing our order it was in the middle of the night about 3 a.m. And we asked for apple pies. the woman on the other end of the speaker stated that it would take about 10 minutes because they did not have any ready  so we decided not to because we did not want to wait an extra 10 minutes when we rolled up to the window we paid the money and Sat there for 15 minutes waiting for our food once we were handed our food we asked her why she did not let us know we would have been waiting 10 minutes anyways and we could have gotten the pies she lost money on that sale   as soon as we informed her that we were upset about the situation she got an attitude with a nasty look on her face and said okay then we had to ask for the ranch that we paid for and she gave us one so we had to ask again for the second one that we paid for   if I ever go back to checkers it will be the checkers other side of town because the customer service location was ridiculous"}
{"text":"I love this place but the staff at night are super rude.  They miss things on your order have an attitude and take forever! !!"}
{"text":"This deserves no stars . Literally . All 3 lady's in there that do cashier or drive thru are rude & they have attitude , besides that they charge 42. Cents for a God dam sauce ? Are you really ? After I ordered a 20$ dollar meal I still have to pay for the sauce .. It's like they don't even want to take my order anymore , , horrible HORRIBLE customer service , they make you feel like you're the bad one , NEVER COMING HEAR AGAIN .."}
{"text":"Fries are great but everything else is terrible.  I would eat here more often if they improved their burgers even just a little bit."}
{"text":"I want to start off by saying that since moving to vegas we have had nothing but good experiences when dealing with Checkers. Tonigjt however was a horrible surprise. It started off alright, ordered two seperate orders no problem. The issues started when it came time for us to receive our food. The woman manning the drive thru window (Olga) seemed to be in a rush to get us out of her sight. I understand that its the graveyard shift but customer service should still be applicable even during the late shift. Second issue was that our order was missing a few things that we payed extra for (garlic dipping sauce and extra ranch) and it was made worse that she seemed mad that we were asking for the sauce that we paid for. Same thing happened with my friend's shake, he got the wrong shake and she again seemed mad we cared enough to ask for the proper flavor. All this would be bad enough but yhe worst was when we got home. We had ordered a large number four and a medium number one. Our friends shake was also supposed to be large sized along with his fries. We noticed that the fries were all small sized and the shake was also a small. Checkers is fast food but it's not cheap like mcdonalds. If you are going to charge the prices you do, make sure your staff is competent and actually cares about the restaurant's reputation enough to actually try during his or her shift. OLGA fails on both accountd and needless to say, we will NOT be coming back."}
{"text":"Waited for food almost 45m  This is is probably  Please don't go here if you are hungry  And terrible service too  I wonder is there is even a manager here??"}
{"text":"I went inside Sunday afternoon. No one at front counter to greet us, dirty tables and dirty floor. After we ordered we sat down, no cups given to us for our drinks. Had to wait for cashier again. So, I assume they are short staffed, and owner lives out of town. Outside several homeless people and no trash cans. I will never return. Oh yeah, food was below average for 2 people, $15.00."}
{"text":"I had a chili dog with fries. I also have the apple pie. The chili dog was just a chili dog he wasn't special.  We went around 830 with pretty empty on the inside. The restaurants clean. The employees are really nice. But the food was just okay. I boyfriend have the burger and he sent the same thing it was just okay.I probably won't be going back anytime soon. I thought is going to be like a in and out or Tommy's Burger but it wasn't spectacular at all."}
{"text":"The store smelled like trash and the restroom looks like it hasn't been cleaned in months. We did not stay to eat!"}
{"text":"In the words of Grumpy Cat... \"Absolutely Awful!\"  I went there the other day because I haven't seen a Checkers in years. Maybe now I know why. First, the service was good. I didn't have any issues there. But the food? YIKES.  We ordered the bacon roadhouse with medium fries, and a large fries also. As soon as we got the food I asked if we got the right size fries. The large compares to a small at any other place, and the medium is TINY.  They were also awful. It tasted like the oil in the fryer hadn't been changed. The burger was drowned in roadhouse sauce. And the bacon?  I don't know what was up with that bacon. It was plastic. Not over cooked, just rock hard. It couldn't have been real bacon. It was that bad. 2 bites into that and I ended up just throwing away the whole meal. Never again!"}
{"text":"Clean and good food for fast food. Price was good for a near strip burger joint. Not sure what the other reviews are talking about. My special order came correctly. I'm a happy customer."}
{"text":"Everything takes way to long. It's almost as if we're at a 4 star restaurant wanting on something extravagant, but then I get my milkshake."}
{"text":"Poor  presentation on the burger I got. Looks like they just through it together.  Dining room was clean and staff was friendly.  Need to improve on presentation. Ok so after eating I have to take one of the two stars away. The burger was not only put together sloppy, but it was bland and soggy.  This location is definitely on my stay away list....pity."}
{"text":"The fucking employees are incompetent stop hiring highschool dropouts. When we got back the order was wrong the fries were cold, was so exited when they recently opened, with the shitty service and even shittier food i hope the shut this place down"}
{"text":"Dont go there lots of homeless and bad service they charge 45 cents for hot sauce, first time and only, i would never come back unless im broke like today , foods not that bad but taste awful because the bad service and not clean tables, also one refill only per visit"}
{"text":"Checkers a/k/a Rallys should be memorable to people like me who were born and raised in the south.  You may also recall Big Boi, from the hip-hop duo Outkast, rapping about Rallys in the third verse of the Outkast song \"Elevators (Me and You)\" when he says \"Back in the day when I was younger, hunger. Lookin to fill me belly with that Rally's, bullish!t, pull sh!t off like it was supposed to be pulled\"...  Checkers/Rallys is much like In-N-Out burger without an inside to dine in. It is drive thru only. But they have some of the best burgers IMO. Their fries are hit or miss though.  If you want a good burger, here are my top(s): 1. Butcher Block -- They make their own 100% beef patties with signature BBQ sauce. You have to take it home and cook it yourself, but these were the bet burgers I've ever had. Top it off with some cheddar cheese. HUGE patties... not too big, not too small 2. Cheeburger Cheeburger -- Huge burgers in different size. I don't care too much for the buns because I feel they are too big. Tons of toppings and OTHER great foods to go with it 3. Checkers/Rallys -- love that taste and it brings back memories. My only problem is that there is only one of these places and it's all the way across town in tweakerville (a/k/a Boulder Hwy.) 4. In-n-out burger -- better than fast food like McDonald's or Burger King... but nothing to write home about  If I'm ever on Boulder Hwy., which is super rare, I will always stop by Checkers/Rallys"}
{"text":"The big buford! Lol.  First time eating here. Im usually a Wendy's/ In'n 'Out kinda girl but the burger and fries were decent!My hubby especially liked the fries!They are battered and crispy, he says. I like simple fries, so again, I may be vanilla here , but Im more than pleased with Wendys! Also, when I make burgers at home, I love to make secret sauce !I think it is the best part of the burger!!yummyAnyway, we were driving by and my hubby was told by a co worker he simply HAD to try Checkers! Our curiosity won and we did. Overall, good experience.They have a large burger statue outside that has secret sauce on it... Sadly, they dont have secret sauce, otherwise Id score them even higher!!"}
{"text":"It's a fast food joint off the strip. Not exactly fine dining. Are you drunk, broke and/or both? Perfect.  Negative reviews are pointless for a checkers. What did you honestly expect?? What is a five star experience at a fast food drive through supposed to be??"}
{"text":"Stopped by the Checkers on Las Vegas Boulevard for the one day only sale of their All-American Cheeseburger for $.69 regular priced $1.19. Might have been the worst hamburger I ever had."}
{"text":"We got the spicy chicken combo and the \"big buford\" combo.  We used coupons and were able to pay $2 for the chicken combo and $4 for the \"big buford\" (normally 4 and 6 dollars respectively).  The food was fresh and pretty good.  The service was great.  If we had to pay full price for the food we probably would have felt shorted.  The small fries were small.  The sandwiches had a decent proportions for the price we paid.  The quality and taste of the food was about par for a good fast food joint.  The fries smelled like they were fried in the same vat as the fish but this was not reflected in the taste.    We walked up to the window and the food prep area appeared clean.  I would not have paid full price for this food due to the amount of food we received."}
{"text":"We tried this food for the very first time tonight and honestly the service was terrible, we were so hungry and taught maybe drive trough would be faster , turned out that it was worst , we waited for the food more than 20 min, and when we finally got the food the cashier didn't even give us ketchup and they just slammed the glass window on us . And the food was cold , the fries were cold the burgers were cold , I wouldn't come back again"}
{"text":"I ordered my food through the drive-through.. My order was and minimal wait time.. maybe three minutes at the most.. The season fries were nice and fresh.. I've probably been here about five or six time so far so good always consistent fast service that's why I'm giving them 5 stars"}
{"text":"This place is disgusting!!! Staff is a joke!! They are sooooo rude and try to talk bad about u in Spanish!! Not knowing I understand Spanish!! I'll never go here again!! I don't recommend this place to anyone!! All I wanted was a strawberry shake with extra strawberries!! Instead I got a cup of strawberry milk and was told that's how it comes takes it or leave it!!! Don't waste ur time or money here!!"}
{"text":"WONDERFUL!  I've been waiting for them to build another location somewhere in Las Vegas...hopefully closer to where I lived.  I moved up to this side of town and a week after I did this one open...what a wonderful house-warming gift!  This is the first restaurant I have seen in this franchise with an in-house dining area so it's nice.  nothing fancy whatsoever, but nice to not have to sit outside in the blistering heat during the summer or deal with the pigeons tryna swoop in and steal my delicious fries."}
{"text":"I haven't had this place since I moved from California. The  was.yummy.and were good but could have been better. Drive thru was fast and we didn't have to wait long for our food."}
{"text":"This was our first time being here and the food was good and their chilli cheese frys were very good. We will be coming back."}
{"text":"Fast friendly and courtesy and helpful services and the food is good and cheaper and clean places."}
{"text":"Prior visit late night drive thru they were out of ice cream and  apple pies . However food was good n fresh ordered thee chicken bites box with the fries which were official it went well for a late night snack .decided to go for lunch today ordered the box again n what a surprise they had apple pies n loaded funnel cakes like they advertise so of course i gotem once the drive thru attendees got my order correct.so they make u pay for sauce even if u get the box 42 cent.but then i get home to indulge n devour n there's no fork for my funnel cake being a bigger issue since i recently relocated n threw out all silverware, like wtf?!?!?!?"}
{"text":"40 minutes and counting for Bozo to make ten cheeseburgers to go. Glad I didn't order fried items as I see no hair nets. I guess the .69 cent deal was a surprise to this location. Many fellow customers left in disgust after getting a refund. One just marched out without his money:"}
{"text":"Got a number 7 wanted to get a quick bite and had high expectations of this place. The sandwich was soggy with old lettuce let me down. I am really happy with the fries they are actually really good and glad that they offer Hi-C as a fountain drink."}
{"text":"Fast food is sometimes Meh... But it is what it is.  This new location didnt disappoint. Due to the location its highly convenient and i most likely will visit again."}
{"text":"I definitely will never eat at this place again! With the bad customer service you think maybe the food might be OK?! You're better off going next-door to 7-Eleven next door and getting a hotdog!"}
{"text":"Bought some food from here.  Food poisoned! I been sick since I ate here. Never will i go here."}
{"text":"I always stop here around 10pm after my sons class. We always get the spicy chicken sandwich and the double chicken sandwich deal, I dont know why every body gives all this bad reviews 1 star ratings but we always get awesome fresh chicken burgers here. They do them right when you order so they are hot and very tasty. The stuff is usually friendly. Yes drive tru takes a long time but oh well they make it fresh to order, so I dont mind waiting a little. Never went inside so dont know how the inside looks or the service is but I love their spicy chicken burger.  No complains here as long as they follow the hygiene rules, I see them wear gloves and hats."}
{"text":"Have you ever licked the inside of a dumpster? Well if you have, that would taste better than the garbage I ate from here. Let me start off by saying I'd feel bad buying this food for a homeless person...oh wait, I had to because they allowed this man to pester me for \"food\" for an astonishing 12 minutes. If I was stranded on a desert island and only had Checker's to eat, I would start gnawing on my knee caps before even considering the meal from checker's. Notice how I didn't capitalize the \"c\" in checker's the last time because I couldn't bare to stand the thought of me using their name grammatically correct."}
{"text":"Best burger ever?  No.  Cheap, clean, fast, convenient?  Yup.  It's the only fast food burger west of UNLV, so they've kind of got a captive audience.  And the burger wasn't bad.  They got my order right.  Sometimes that's good enough."}
{"text":"This place is gross. Way to much mustard on the burger. The fries were cold and hard and the banana shake had too much syrup in it. It was just nasty. Never ever go there again."}
{"text":"I love this place the service was good they got my order right they were very friendly and the food was awesome I got the number 3 which was a bacon double cheeseburger with chili cheese fries and I got there 10 piece chicken wings which was out of this world this is now one of my go to places to eat in vegas."}
{"text":"I have ate at this location one or two times and I got to say the food here at this checkers is okay at best the fries are okay but the oil that comes out of the fries looks like they don't change it based on how the fries taste as you can taste the oil when you eat the fries and the times I ate them I either had a bad stomach ache or diarrhea not a good thing to have outside of that I can't say much about the burgers as I only had the chili cheese fries or the regular fries but other then that the food for the price you pay isn't too bad just wish they would constantly change the oil for the fries if they do that then there wouldn't be much of a problem other then that I could see myself coming here again or another time and give this checkers location another shot."}
{"text":"I had some really horrible French fries from here the third time I went and have not gone back since.  They tasted about a week old and one didn't taste like it was ever a potato. Everything else was just poorly put together."}
{"text":"I have to say, I have been here at least 10 times since this location opened. I have had all pleasant experiences. Never had to send any food back. My orders have always been handled correctly.  The Deep Sea Double and the Big Buford are my favorites. I do enjoy their cheese sticks as well.  I always get the 32oz Iced Tea for a dollar. Plus, you can't beat their 2 for $1.00 apple pies.  The last Big Buford I had - I don't know what happened - but it was possible the best of the cheap fast food places ever.  Plus, every time you order, you do a survey on the website and get a free sandwich! Plus, with the coupons it makes a really good value for a family guy like me. Giggitty giggity."}
{"text":"You shouldn't charge $0.42 for a damn sauce when I purchased a meal. You all are greedy."}
{"text":"Normally I stay away from anything on Boulder Hwy north of Flamingo but a co-worker told me how good these burgers were and that I had to give it a chance.  Getting in and out of this location can be hell given the traffic conditions on Desert Inn & Boulder Hwy, sooooo beware depending upon what time you visit.  Rolled through the drive-thru and ordered up a Bacon Roadhouse Burger consisting of meat, cheese, crispy onion parts, bbq sauce and bacon.  The combo came with fries and a drink.  We pulled into a adjacent parking lot to consume at which time I found the burger to be a tad smaller than I had envisioned and the fries delicious.  Later on in the day...say 15 minutes after gulping it down, that small in stature burger felt like a brick in my stomach and stuck with me until I went to sleep."}
{"text":"Rally's... Checker's... It's all the same. And it's good. I had a all beef chili cheese dog with onions and it was good. I ate a Cheese Champ that was a single burger with lettuce, tomato, onion, and ketchup and it was damn good especially for the price. I have been before this last time and had mozzarella sticks that are good as hell for a fast food place. I have also had a burger that had jalapenos and they weren't shy with them so I liked it a lot. They have a walk up window and a double drive thru. The drive thru speaker on the left has window service on the passenger side and the speaker on the right has window service at the drivers window."}
{"text":"The food is decent cheap fast food fare. Problem is it's not fast! It's not completely sluggish but I'd have an in n out burger in the same amount of time it took to get my meal and not much compares to in n out fast food wise. Up your customer service game checkers!"}
{"text":"I give them one start because I can't give them less. Their food is beyond unhealthy. I got the chili hot dog and I had stomach pain and horrible bm's for two days. I had chili dogs from other places and everything was fine. I don't know if the chili was old or rotten or what the hell happened but this is not acceptable... to serve people this kind of subpar food. Get your act together Checkers."}
{"text":"What an improvement!!!!!  Super clean, hot food and the staff cares.  I'll start coming to checkers like I did in Ohio. Two thumbs up."}
{"text":"Boyfriend and I stopped there last night. We ordered 2 meals; 2 burgers, 2 medium fries, 1 med soda, 1 med shake came out to just under $15.   Burgers:  I was a little disappointed by the size of my burger after I paid. Smaller than an In n Out burger. My boyfriend's burger had REAL bacon, he felt it much better than any other fast food bacon he's had. So, other than the bacon, the burgers were just okay. ORDER THE BACON.  Fries:  The fries were good, but as Jason describes \"the drink to fry ratio was whack\". The medium drink was quite large and the fries were a moderate size. Don't plan on sharing fries.  Drinks: They serve Cherry Coke, which Jason loved. It's not a typical find in a fast food place. I had the banana milkshake, which was good- just as I expected. Nothing over the top. No whip or cherry but I don't feel that took away from it.   Overall, I wouldn't plan any special trips out here. On the back of the receipt there's a coupon for a free burger when you call in a review of service."}
{"text":"I live in Summerlin and was craving checkers so I drove all the way to this location at 2:30 am tonight. They had me reverse behind the red poles like they always do and then had me wait exactly 14 minutes before giving me half of the order I paid for!  I spent $20.04 for two meals and two funnel cakes. I ended up receiving one meal, and the other drink and fries. No funnel cakes and no second meal, just fries, drink and my meal. My poor husband didn't even get to eat tonight and I went on a 35 minute mission for this. Major regret! Now I just want a refund for the food I never received. Not to mention a restaurant would of served me quicker than this fast food establishment did. I won't be returning. I would like management to contact me for a partial refund."}
{"text":"love this place. the food is good, but they are kind of slow. i hope they open a location in centennial hills."}
{"text":"I went a few months ago and had average service but pretty decent food.  I decided to stop by again when shopping Sunday and had the loveliest service from super friendly young gents.  It looks like a new crew and I was pleased with how attentive they were with everyone ordering and getting food.  Everyone seemed to be working hard and had a smile on their face.  My food was even better than my first visit.  I will absolutely be back, glad they finally have a good food place in Walmart!"}
{"text":"I always get the #10 combo... I love their chicken sandwich!!! I come here 3-4 times a week... Lol"}
{"text":"Cool place to stop and get a bite or drink!   Stopped today for one of their Watermelon slushee (It's 112 here in Vegas)   Refreshing"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE I WILL NEVER GO BACK!!!! I orders a Number 4, Looks good in Picture, But the burger was HORRIBLE I even had to go ask for more onion strings because there were only 3 on my burger. Yes I said 3, AND the bacon was so hard I had to pull pieces out of my mouth that were not even edible. Ok so the chilli cheese fries might have been good IF there was any chilli cheese on them. I went with my husband so my total was 16$ for the two of us, my stomach is still trying to digest this HORRIBLE experience."}
{"text":"the food is great its the staff. EVERY time we come here they mess up our order. Its written correctly on the receipt but not when our order comes out. The staff often ignores customers who are obviously waiting. Other time they are all chatting in the back. This specific time the person who was supposed to be cooking was chatting with a leaving employee. And the person using the register was flirting with the girl in front of me AFTER he had taken her order and ignoring the fact there were other people in line. You shouldn't have to wait 30 minutes for your food and then have it be not what you ordered. I have never seen the manager and the workers are rude when you tell them your order was wrong. I would give it a 5 for food but who knows if theyre messing with it too."}
{"text":"Oh my.  After wandering the RV lots that populate this side of the valley, we were a bit parched and needed a light snack and a cold drink.  We parked and headed to the walk-up window (as you can only drive-thru or walk-up, there's no inside dining area, but there is an outside covered seating area). The service was quick enough.  Hubby wants to sit in their street front table area and enjoy the warm spring day.  My goodness, but it's tough to enjoy your drink or snack with all those pigeons.  And they're persistent little buggers, even when you try to shoo them away.  Ick.  It's a sad location to begin with, but it's also at the corner of busy, busy Boulder Highway and Desert Inn.  My advice--if you get something from this Checkers location--use the drive-thru and find a park or someplace nice and safe to munch on whatever you bought. You might enjoy your food break more if you do."}
{"text":"It's fast food, so it's definitely not good for you- but the fries here are like crack. Eating them is a cheap habit you hide from your friends and family but you just. can't. stop.  Thankfully, I live nowhere near this location (or any others)- service here is surprisingly friendly but Jesus Christ, they need to lower the volume on the drive-up window. I'm pretty sure you can hear everything being said an entire block away.  Chicken sliders are tasty- prefer the buffalo to the homestyle version. Their wings have several sauces and rival those at more popular wing chains, plus better fries. If the regular fries aren't enough of a health crime for you, they're also available topped with cheese, chili, bacon, and ranch, or any combination thereof. So far, I've successfully resisted.  TLDR: fries. fries. fries."}
{"text":"Ive been a daily customer since it opened and untill now im so frustrated, Never coming here again! When I drove up to the drive thru window the lady gave me a bad attitude and didnt even greet me and also didnt give me my correct order. Mostly all the employees that attend customers are rude. Dont go here!"}
{"text":"Great burgers and great service! Enjoy your meal outside. People are polite and courtesy. Get your burger on !!"}
{"text":"After going to this store,  I ended up having 3 fraudulent charges from other businesses charged to my card the same day.. Funny thing is that was the first time I had used the card in a week.  Will never return to this location again."}
{"text":"The mozzarella sticks are the BOMB!! Love the sweet treats, and fries of course. . . My new fav is the chili dogs! I come at least once a week.. can't pass it up. Ive never had them mess up my order, and they are always friendly."}
{"text":"First time eating here I ordered the chicken dippers and fries. It said it was all white meat not sure what the white meat was but it sure wasn't from chicken. I will try it again but I will try the burgers."}
{"text":"I went to this location a few weeks ago and ordered the $5 Bacon Phillycheesesteak Combo they were advertising on the sign. When I got to the window I was told that it was $5.49 and not $5 because the one without Bacon was the $5 combo. I explained that the sign didn't say that, and I even went around the building and took a picture of the sign and showed it to the Manager. They said they have to charge what the register rings it up as, so I said forget it and drove over to Wendy's for a Baconator Combo...    Tonight, I decided to give them another chance to redeem themselves. Seeing that the sign was still up, I went through the drive thru and ordered the same exact thing.. Again, I was told that it was $5.49 before taxes for that combo. I asked why she can't just ring it up as the $5 combo and throw bacon on it for me. She said that's not how it works there,,, so I again cancelled my order and drove away.    I have NEVER been to a business before, especially a franchise, that would not HONOR their own advertised prices. I REFUSE to endorse this Checkers location, and I will continue to drive by to Wendy's or across the street to the McDonalds...     Checkers just lost a customer for life!!"}
{"text":"They only have 2 employees late night takes for ever in a day to order. They need more employees at night this is the strip. Where it gets busy at those hours of the night. The wait is 20 minutes tops drive-thru & inside. Sometimes they close the drive-thru who wants to get out the car during those hours. Smh Hire more employees!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I went here after waiting for a long errand. If you're going to go here I would not suggest the regular burger. It felt overpriced and too greasy for an ordinary cheeseburger especially in Vegas. For cheaper you can get a better version of this cheeseburger at In N Out and everything tastes less greasy and more fresh.   I'm not a fan of bacon burgers but the bacon burger my boyfriend got was way bigger and tastier than my burger and about the same price. The biggest strength of the entire bacon burger was the barbecue sauce. Definitely the right thickness and taste. Would highly recommend this if you come for a burger, as it beats Carl's Jr's western bacon burgers out of the water, as well as most other bbq bacon burgers I've recalled having.  Otherwise it was standard fair for fast food. On par with other fast food services.  The mozzarella sticks are fine too. They're on par with most mozzarella sticks from other places. The winner here is the fries. The fries are amazing.  I'm not sure if they were fried in animal fat but the oil they used definitely had some flavor to it. It's not as great as I would have hoped but I suspect my review would've been higher if I based it on the bacon burger I had and not my cheeseburger"}
{"text":"Here on vacation staying at the Hyatt across the street. Ordered  $55 worth of food, nearly all of it was messed up. Sent one of us back to fix the error, they took the food and receipt and accused my friend of digging through the trash for it and called him a tramp. The employees name was ramona. Went to get a refund and there was no manager working. Save your self the trouble of this ghetto ass establishment and just go to Robertos next door, the food is much better and they treat their customers with respect. If I could give zero stars I would, one star is far too much for this checkers."}
{"text":"Uhhhhh you should get people who speak English working the drive thru. I asked the lady for 2 orders of the 2 for $5 fish sandwiches and a baconator burger so 5 sandwiches in total. She said ok. She only gave me one order of the 2 for $5 cause she only spoke Spanish and didn't understand what I was saying. I politely made it a point to make it clear about the number of sandwiches I wanted and was repeating myself over and asked her if she understood and she just would say yes. I drove away and went home to find that she was just shitting me and was saying yes yes okay okay because she didn't understand wtf I was saying. WTF man.. I'm sure she could be a nice lady, but maybe try putting people who are bilingual or something???? My fat ass was left HANGRY"}
{"text":"Just went through the drive thru and the girl working was so rude and they were out of five different things I wanted. (Which I get that it happens sometimes) but she was so rude and then as I went to ask another question and she goes \"look!\" And then realized her headset was still on and was yelling at me. Great customer service rude, I just left."}
{"text":"I was impressed with Checkers. I have been a few times now, ordered different things each time, and have been impressed with the quality of their food. I mean, at the end of the day, it's still fast food but the beef patties are of good quality, the buns are good and the fries are pretty awesome.  I usually avoid giving fast food chains anything above a 3-star rating but I like that this chain is new and challenging some of the more establish ones like McD's or Jack in the Box"}
{"text":"After reading the reviews of fellow Yelpers, I figure it is time for the old person to Yelp out. Checkers is really just another hamburger stand. I like the idea it is shaped like a bus, which is cool. The twisty turns and maneuvers you must navigate are not fun. The dual drive up windows caught us by surprise.  Our daughter said we should try it and so we did, by the way that usually means buy us something while you're there. So here is how my order went and what it cost. Big Buford combo (med), the medium refers to the drink and quantity of fries; with a substitute of Banana shake for the drink, one bacon cheese burger combo deals (med), and one bacon, cheese hamburger and fries (med), no drink, and finally a Cheese burger combo (med) with a substitute Vanilla Shake. The total $26.21, that was for four people and basic meals. Here is something to remember the cost of the bacon cheese burger and fries cost only .30 less that the combo. In the case that a combo saves money, here it does. Make sure that you ask for drink carriers and napkins because if you don't ask your will not receive.  The fries have a seasoning on them and they are a little crunchy, they don't offer any fry sauce, the hamburgers are small in comparison with the quarter pounders, however they taste pretty good. The milk shake I had was vanilla and it taste good and wasn't over powering. Our children didn't complain about their food and my wife likes the fries. So we might try it again.  The survey on the back of the receipt will get you a free cheese burger, so if you think of trying it again do the survey."}
{"text":"This place does not disappoint when it comes to customer service and wait times; consistently poor and this time is no exception.  I've been in the drive through for 10 minutes and just now ordered. The voice over the speaker is gruff and not at all polite.  There is one car ahead of me and I did not see them order so they had to have been here going on 15 minutes now.  The drive thru worker just informed the car in front of me that they are out of something that was ordered.  How was that not known when they ordered or at least when they got to the window?   After 20 minutes, I am finally at the window and my food is not ready. How is this possible?  Shelley is the drive thru employee and she is handling cash and preparing food.  I was just asked to pull into the parking lot and told my food would be brought to me when it was ready.  How long does is take to cook fries and chicken bites?  Pitiful! Now I remember why I haven't come here in 6 months.  Avoid this place if you plan on eating in this century."}
{"text":"Ok couple weeks ago I went to this checkers and the lady told me they were close because they had no meat ? Haha, ok couple days ago I went back and the co worker that has the midnight shift told me they were close because the cash register wasn't working ? But I swear I heard people in there laughing and they looked like they were smoking when I went around to look."}
{"text":"I would never in my life go back to this store again. I ordered 10 piece wings and A large slushy, prior to me ordering the wings I asked if they can do all flats because I don't eat the drums and he told me yes he can do it for me but it will be a 8 min wait. When I got home he gave me all drums with barely any sauce on them and I feel it was intentional because I informed him I don't eat drums and on top of that the so called slushy I paid 4 dollars for was melted and seemed like it didn't have any ice in it. I have been calling the store since yesterday they won't pick up the phone at all. NEVER AGAIN!!!"}
{"text":"Just picked up a 4 for $4 deal and my checkers burger smelled really really moldy and on top of it was cold, took my first bite and felt sick to my stomach, this is my 2nd time coming to this location for a checkers burger and getting a dirt cold burger and also second time getting sick off the food here! Just warning everyone so no one else gets sick."}
{"text":"I started with the Roadhouse bacon burger and fries with drinks and they were ok. Nothing special."}
{"text":"Ate here 3x over the summer, got the power shits later in the day 2x  This wasn't from the \"refried\" food sitting there looking all gross in the bins either, this was strictly from burgers and ice cream  Prices are cheap relative to other stuff around here but they do actually charge a little more for everything than other Checkers that are farther out from tourist zones"}
{"text":"I like this place. Hate the incompetence of the workers. All I wanted was some ice cream. To start off there was just people standing around when all you have to do is fill a cup. Second of all, the worker took my ice cream next to the fryer to put the lid on and I ended up with some crumbs in it? WTF. Like please people. And all the other times I have been here they always forget the sauces. It's listed on the receipt for crying out loud. All the workers just look like they hate life and screw up my order every time."}
{"text":"First time we ate here, we went crazy and tried 2 sandwiches, fries, onion rings and their angry buffalo wings. The wings and the onion rings were the highlight, though their fries weren't bad. The seasoning is better than some of the big name places, but the fries arent consistent in crispness/freshness. Since the first trip, we've gone back solely for the wings and ordered them in large numbers. The benefit in so doing is that they're guaranteed to not have 40 wings precooked and sitting around under a lamp- you can watch them fry up a 'fresh' batch while waiting at the drive through. The first time I went we got one or two ranches kudos to enjoy with the wings, after that they gave us one and told us it'd be 42 cents for each additional packet. The last two-three times we've gone we didn't receive any ranch despite our large orders. I'm not sure what their policy is regarding their ranch distribution, but shouldnt 40 hot wings get at least 1 little packet? Its also obvious that when interacting with the workers, they aren't particularly enthusiastic. The sandwiches were subpar and the inconsistencies about something as silly as a couple of ranch packets [2 free with an order of 20 wings and then 0 ranch with 40 wings + attitude?] is irritating. There's also a timer inside the restaurant trying to ensure that the food doesn't take too long- when it goes off, there have been several times that the servers would ask me to pull back and re-position my car in the awkward little drive through in order to stop the beeping.  The angry buffalo sauce is our favorite and the cheap wings are the reason to go back, but it's not much different from any other chain restaurant otherwise."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever. The guy working the drive thru @ 1 am 8/14/2015 was extremely rude, he was logged in as crystalynn (because that was the name on my receipt) but I'm sure that wasn't his name .. They not only gave us cold food but took the sandwich back through the window and told me it \"didn't feel cold to him\" then made us pull around and to the front and brought my sandwich back in 2 minutes, I'm sure they didn't remake my sandwich that fast. Terrible."}
{"text":"This place is insanely slow. 15 minutes to get my order. Not sure how this is supposed to be \"fast\" food."}
{"text":"The only time I give reviews is if a restaurant is excellent or poor in my eyes. This is an excellent restaurant in my opinion. Everyone experience is different so I can only speak for myself. First and foremost, strong shout out to the night crew on May 30, 2015 around 10:30 pm. I was getting out my car and headed to the glass front door and even before I got physically got in, I noticed a cook in the back putting on new gloves to start making orders. I walked in and immediately said \"What is your name because I want to recognize you publically for doing your job when you didn't even realize a customer was watching you. He said his name was FABIAN. So world, when FABIAN is making your food please know from me to you this man cares about you having a safe meal.   I am big on safety why? Whether or not I look like it, I have a M.S Degree in OSHA (Occupational Safety and Health). Therefore, I have a keen eye for this stuff. I am always on the lookout for restaurant employees acting \"Mc-nasty\".  Also, an employee was cleaning up the dining room area preparing for incoming customers. This is what you are suppose to do instead of laying around when the dining room has few customers. The drive through was more crowded than the dining room as most restaurants are at night by the way. Overall, the food was hot and the staff was friendly and professional. They seem to have a great A-team working relationship and I will say to that manager on the shift \"Great Job\". I enjoyed my meal and definitely will be back."}
{"text":"10:50pm Friday night. Whoever this young kid was who handled my order was so genuinely courteous and studious that I had to commend this establishment. I regret not getting his name now, but complements to whoever made the decision to hire him. That kid is going places. Food was hot and fresh, which at the time made me completely forget how long I'd waited on it but 100% justifies the time. What a good Checkers experience."}
{"text":"Oh god it was terrible! The employees were annoyed with the customers and even made fun of the guy in front of me. When I got my food there was a roach or cricket leg in it. Seriously. I'll starve before I eat here."}
{"text":"5 stars at a fast food joint ? Yes, 5 stars. If you're from Florida, you know how people love their checkers. Rally's in some states but hey, I grew up for the love of checkers. This checkers has a inside dining area...wait what. YES, YOU CAN SIT DOWN AND EAT. I'm mindblown, closest to indoors I have ever seen was one with glass on long island so you didn't freeze your butt off in the winter. Anyways, ignore the crying kids, this place is awesome interior wise. It is beyond clean, cleaner than most dining in restaurants. I would eat off of the floor of this place. The tables are spotless, the soda machine is clean, bathrooms included. I was beyond impressed. Anyways I ordered a bacon roadhouse (free coupon, hella yeah) with 2 apple pies for a dollar. First off, screw mcds apple pies, these PG quote myself \"poop\" on the mcds pies. Hot, steamy and filled with a crispy but light texture to them, always a good call plus is 2 for 1. The bacon roadhouse was delicious, all fresh tasting ingredients. If you never been to checkers, the menu is huge but this location includes breakfast. I've never seen breakfast at one of these locations so I am planning on returning if I'm awake in time for it. This Checkers may not be opened until 5 am like I'm used to but it's worth the stop."}
{"text":"This is only the 2nd Checkers I've been to and I'm really glad to see this one is an actual building where you can go inside. The one in Savannah, GA was just a walk up window with outdoor seating.   The food is your standard fast food fare and similar to stuff you would see at A&W or DQ and most of it is super cheap. I got a 4 chicken finger combo w/ fries and drink for 5 bucks and included 2 dipping sauces! The service here is mediocre as the tables were kind of dirty and when it was my turn a guy cut in front of me and spent 2 min asking about and trying to order an ice cream cone wtf. The cashier took his order and didn't say anything about him stepping in front of me as I was walking up to the counter from where I had been standing looking at the menu.  The location is in the middle of the hood on Rancho but it's near work for me so I'm sure I'll be back again by default. They also have a drive thru just in case you're not brave enough to go inside"}
{"text":"Checkers has great food. But this location is terrible. The customer service is non existent. I just waited 30 minutes for cold food. Rude staff and there is an obvious lack of management here."}
{"text":"This place sucks, learn how to manage... and make a burger 2 hours before and have enough warming in your tray because honestly you can't keep up. Mediocre frozen burgers, with good fries and the worst service. Took 25 min for a value burger and fry. Wack place."}
{"text":"This is the most awful place I've ever been to. The cackles from severely overweight employees is deafening. It almost distracts you from the mediocrity steaming into your face from your food. Unfortunately, everything about my experience here was awful. The place is dirty, the employees hate being there and I would rather eat my shoes than come here ever again."}
{"text":"I decided I must review after reading all the bad ones on here.  I live right by this place and waited far to long to try them.  It took a couple times of going there to get what we really wanted but now that I know what's up - maybe I can help future burger lovers.  Checkers has many low price options but it is by far not a cheap place.  The first time we ordered two bacon doubles in a patty melt they had advertised two for $6.  That burger remains the best deal for the money and it was great.  We tried the two bacon double crisps for $4 and they were not great at all.  Still fresh and hot, though.  While we were waiting in line for that order (yes - they take a while - but everything is always fresh) we stared at this picture they have on the window of a lovely bacon cheese burger - thinking it was what we ordered - far from it.  So the next time we asked for that burger on the picture - the lady told us it was a double bacon double cheese - ok - we ordered two.  I confirmed when we got to the window and a different lady told us - no, it was actually a baconzilla. So, yet again, we left with burgers we didn't really want - but they were actually delicious.  We finally  went back for the baconzilla - and that is one of the best fast food burgers I have ever had.  Unreal.  I mean the name of it alone is appetizing. (Or frightening, depending on perspective, I guess)  The fries are off the hook but expensive and small portioned - I highly recommend the loaded versions.  I have always had friendly service and fresh hot food, even in the middle of the night."}
{"text":"Their ice cream machine is broken or something. The ice creams and shakes we have gotten taste good, however they are super melty right after they are made. They need to turn down the temperature on the machine and then the cold treats would be fantastic."}
{"text":"Expensive. Overrated. Wonder Bread?  I'm not sure how big the chain Checker's is, but I know there are several around town. I went in with the boyfriend on a Thursday. He ordered a bacon cheeseburger, & I ordered a chicken sandwich with chili cheese fries. We both also had drinks, and our total was $16. That's pretty steep for fast food. Anywho, the menu board shows actual burgers, what we got was sandwiches with wonder bread. $6 for a piece of Wonder Bread, one piece of bacon, and a patty.... How does that add up? Maybe if the food was tasty I can overlook the Wonder Bread and the  steep prices, but this is nothing better the way I can make at home. Actually my burgers and sandwiches taste a lot better. And the chili cheese fries... Hormel chili, or the off brand, and maybe a tablespoon of cheese.  Unless they're giving out free food, skip this joint."}
{"text":"I usually get the fry lovers fry 950 calories of yummy seasoned fries... you can also get a nice cone for a good price... soda is a bit expensive you can get some pretty good deals at this place or you can over pay for a few things"}
{"text":"This place is awful didn't even get our food service was so bad ,the cashier was a guy or girl could not tell had his or her fingers in mouth while putting our order together, demanded a refund an left what a disgrace this place is no manager to be found avoid this place at all means"}
{"text":"The food here is good and great for the price. However, this place is constantly running out of items. The staff is very carelesd and forgets your food items more often than not."}
{"text":"Beware of card skimmers here.  My debt card was skimmed and I had a $175 charge on my card from 2 different gas station.  This was a new debit card I had just received in the mail 2 days ago!"}
{"text":"These kids are idiots, I don't know how no mayo no lettuce on a chicken sandwich is hard to understand , even though it's on the recipe, but these ass clowns definitely aren't worth the $15 an hour these high school dropouts think they're worth"}
{"text":"Waiting in line for 10 minutes and waiting for food for 15 minutes. I should be more mad about that but it's just too funny. Only five customers are inside but I ain't mad. They just need better leadership"}
{"text":"Always been a BIG Checkers/ Rally's fan. This state don't get the goodness & cleanliness of this restaurant.  Food is delish, the staff is friendly. In a nice area. Forget McDonald's & Burger King,  I'm having Checkers"}
{"text":"Got a checker burger I was starving from a long drive to vegas and even all that hunger didn't help the taste of the food lol.. bland burger and fried don't be fooled by the color of the fries I liked the apple pie...i have a sweet tooth not because it was anything special ... stars are for price and apple pie"}
{"text":"Never had Checkers before so I decided to try it out. The employee was nice but the food sucked. Costco has better hotdogs, no joke. Bland chili, bun was basic and the hotdog was old and appeared to have been in a heatlamp for days. One and done..."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the food and service at checkers. Fries are outstanding, but you have to ask for all condiments at the counter. You even have to ask for extra napkins. They aren't self help like most other places. Try the shakes!"}
{"text":"All these people talking about how bad it is to sit outside, ya broke mother fuckers get a car . I eat my food in my whip, ya trick ass broke fools"}
{"text":"yeah, i'll pass. At the advice of my friends/ classmates we were looking for a spot to grub during finals, they were in shock that i had yet to visit this spot. I shoulda known better because their favorite eating spots are quite putrid but I was in a rush and didn't eat all day so went along with the group. The place looks dingy from the outside but i was trying to remain optimistic, the menu has a lot to choose from and the prices were fair. The lil gal that took our order was nice. We took our order to go, got back to campus and was pretty disappointing. The fries were bland, burger was ..sloppy n mushy which is gnarly but i ate through the sadness to finish it. They also prepared it wrong with the condiments i told them not to add so.. learned my lesson. The place could have potential if it was on top of things but that might be wishful thinking."}
{"text":"Not satisfied at all woth the burgers. The double checkers burger while looks grwat up on the menu is horribly small and the patties arw so thin. Just terrible. The proportion of the fire you get are also so small although the fries do fast good the only +. Wont be returning anytime soon"}
{"text":"Burgers are tiny, fries are awesome & service is great at times. Night shift drive-thru lady is rude, but everyone else seems pretty nice & attentive."}
{"text":"Man, every time I get food from here, I have mixed feelings. Kind of like a guilty pleasure, a cheap thrill, or eating a forbidden fruit. Yes, I went biblical there. These guys should be called \"Greasers\" instead. Every thing on the menu is FRIED.  I know I shouldn't be eating here but the word \"Baconzilla\" cannot be ignored. Imagine a huge piece of bacon the size of the Empire State Building walking around terrorizing people. Ok, maybe im the only one imagining that. Anyways, here you have two choices of their Baconzilla. One is their cheeseburger and the other is a big serving of their patented fries loaded with nacho cheese, barbeque sauce, tons of bacon bits, and two strips of bacon. I kid you not, after trying to eat the Baonzilla Fries, I could not bring myself to eat the two strips of bacon for I had a lot of bacon flavor already with all the bacon bits they drowned the fries with.   The prices here are really good. You get a lot of greasy goodness for not a lot of money. They have specials all the time. What I got was the Chicken Strip meal for 2 bucks. Comes with two chicken strips and fries. Not a bad deal. I paired that with the Baconzilla Fries for 2.99 so for 5 bucks and some change, I had a pretty good lunch.  Service is ok. Since they are open 24 hours, you will always get different employees with different issues. You will have different experiences here ranging from good, bad, to plain just awful. Don't expect a lot from a chain that is open 24 hours that is located in a sketchy part of town especially at night.  Speaking of their location, they are located on the southwest corner of Desert Inn Road and Boulder Highway. Since Boulder Highway is a busy street with a bunch of casinos just a mile or two down the road, you are guaranteed to have different \"Characters\" hanging out here. Peeps from prostitutes, pimps, drug addicts, drug dealers and homeless people to drunks, hitchhikers, joggers, students, and the occasional out of town vacationer because all the good places are closed already. Keep in mind that most weird activities happen as soon as the sun goes down and multiplies even more from midnight to 4 am. Like my momma always said, nothing good ever happens between 12 and 4 am.  As for the layout of the place, you have two drive through entrances which is why you would think would give you really fast service. Umm.....no. In reality, it slows everything down because when you have both drive thrus occupied, they don't have a full crew at each station. Instead, they take turns processing orders. What I think is dumb is that if you go in the left drive thru, the cashier will be on your right side so if you are by yourself, you have to reach across to pay and get your order. It's even harder if you don't have power windows.   So for those that have munchies and want some greasy goodness at no matter what time of the day, this is the place to go. Just make sure your head is on a swivel if you come here at night. For those that are from Southern California, they have this there as well but they go by the name of Rally's. For the longest time, this was the only location in Vegas. Now they just opened up another one off of Rancho Drive.  Yelp 2014 365 Review Challenge #71"}
{"text":"This place sucks. I've been here a few times since they opened. I'm trying so hard to like them. And that is because it's the only burger joint right here.   Ok so this place looks like a diner. You would expect diner food. Not so much it's basically a fast food burger shop. Has a drive thru, walk up window, and the dining room is Open 24/7.   You can get burgers, seasoned fries, processed fish or chicken sandwiches, shakes, hot dogs, nuggets and breakfast sandwich or burrito.   I've ordered their big Buford it's big two 1/4 pound patties, cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion, ketchup, mustard, mayo, pickles. Ordered it plain and the girl asked did you want cheese? Well the picture shows cheese and it says big Buford with cheese meaning you are charging me for cheese.  I said yes. She yells back add cheese very snarky, the fries are over salted and cold every time. I don't understand why you would salt seasoned fries.   I've never seen anyone cook and I've been there 4 times. They pull good out of trays and put your good together. This last time I ordered the double checker burger with cheese no onion no tomato extra pickles no mustard no ketchup with their fries. So salty I didn't finish them. The burger came with 3 little pickles, tomato and mustard I didn't finish it. What a waste of money.   I've had their banana shake tastes just like fake banana flavor. Their apple cinnamon pie was stale. Now breakfast sandwich with bacon. The bacon was hard the egg tastes like powdered egg and had some kind of cheese sauce. Not good.   Bottom line is you won't get anything really good here and the service isn't good either and they just opened a few weeks ago. Hell you would be better off at subway next door."}
{"text":"Had a good experience...they take double coupons...order was accurate and the food was plenty!!"}
{"text":"I'm not a really picky eater. For the most part, even if food is sub-par, I'll still eat it. Soggy fries, whatever. Sloppy burger, no big deal. Dry chicken breast, it's cool. I actually think McDonald's and White Castle are pretty great for what you spend.   I'd never been to checkers before, so after a few drinks last Friday I figured I'd give it a shot. That was a huge mistake. After spending a few bucks on a #1, I took my food home to enjoy it...or so I thought.   The burger was by and large the worst fast-food burger I've ever had. I have pretty low standards, man, and that thing was just not. good. But I was a little sauced, so I finished it. Onto the fries.  What in the name of soggy flavorless potato hell just went into my mouth? Maybe that was a bad one. Nope, still awful flavorless mush. Those went into the bin uneaten.   I will say though, the Coke that I got was what I expected - but that's nearly impossible to mess up.   Oh, dear yelpers, I wish the story ended there. Imagine my surprise when Sunday morning rolls around and something just...isn't quite right. I feel a little sour. My muscles seem a little fatigued. I feel warm and just a bit bloated...and then comes the lower abdomen rumble of doom.   While I spent the remainder of the day with my rear doing a dramatic recreation of the fire-hose from \"Backdraft\" I had plenty of time to reflect upon what I may have eaten that could have cause such violent business - and I settled upon the poor, poor quality food that came from this fine establishment. This continued until Thursday evening. Food poisoning was amazing! I lost an entire 8 pounds over the course of the week. Thanks, checkers, for accelerating my diet!  TL;DR: I ate here. It wasn't good. I got food poisoning and was ill for 6 days."}
{"text":"First time at a Checkers and Rally's. Drive thru was pretty fast and the food was very hot. Definitely would come back for the fries they were super tasty."}
{"text":"Came here starving on a Saturday for lunch. Ordered a classic double with fries and a shake. The shake was really tasty, better than In N out. The fries were well seasoned and crispy and were the highlight  of the meal. The burger was better than a normal McDonalds, but nothing special, I guess I don't see the appeal in coming here (especially with In N Out in our town).   The other factor was slow service, it took a pretty long time to get our food and the quality was disappointing. The fries and shake really saved this place from a 1 star."}
{"text":"I am not sure if these is normal on the wings BUT the picture on display lookssss sooooo much better .. The whole wings are covered in sauce.  The ones i got look like they just pass the sauce across the wing box , not ordering this again ... I expected wayyyy better."}
{"text":"When getting late night food having someone like America not only take our order with such a great attitude but then make it so fast and great is amazing. I can only imagine what working a late night shift in Las Vegas must be like and she was awesome."}
{"text":"10/21/2016 was my very first time going to this place. I was kind of excited because I've heard their food was good. So I pull up to the drive thru, there were about 4 cars ahead of me. I'm waiting at the menu for someone to say \"hey, hi, welcome to checkers what can I get for you\" NOPE! not even a \"hi can you please wait a moment\" I sat there for probably 10 minutes. I kept saying \"hello\" \"excuse me\" and got no response. The cars in front of me weren't moving either.   I was trying to keep my patience. I figured maybe the speaker doesn't work and I have to order at the window. So then the cars in front of me started moving, so I moved up also. Then a truck pulls up behind me and I hear from the speaker \"what can I get for you\"  I was so embarrassed I had to get out my car and tell the lady in the truck my situation. She was friendly and said \"oh go ahead. I'm not dealing with this\" she pulls out the drive thru, I'm standing there once again saying \"HELLO!!\" \"Excuse me!!\" Yet again no response.   SOOO I got in my car and reversed. I could of easily left but I had already waited a while and I was hungry. This time I yelled into the speaker box and finally got a response. I ordered then pulled up to the window. I waited another 15 minutes for a simple order!!! If it weren't for my boyfriend, I would of went off on the lady. She didn't even apologize for the long wait.   One thing for sure, I'm never returning to that place again."}
{"text":"Fries are $1 right now! All sizes. I ordered 3 large and they were fresh and hot. The cashier was fast and friendly. The restaurant was clean."}
{"text":"Family went here, got food poisoning. It's the only shared meal they had and I didn't eat it myself so I'm just fine. It's sixteen hours after they consumed the disappointing burgers and they are still recovering."}
{"text":"Consistent with other franchises around the country. I did notice that the when they were creating it that it was going to be on such busy streets on both sides. I knew right off the bat that was going to be a mess. Only one entrance and exit... The location is small since it's on a corner. Yeah the speaker system is a bit of a challenge on one end is to serve the driver and the other side, if you don't have a passenger or flexible, is for the passenger. It seems people now a days bitch a lot with anything now. You know at least there is a Checkers in Las Vegas. Of course there is only one person that takes the orders because it's small!    But that can easily be fixed with one more person on either system. The problem I found was that the fries were too salty, not consistent with other Checkers I have gone to. The burger was dead on and so would have been the fries. The customer service sure did suffer because there was one person attending in the morning. Plus those damn customers that show up there I swear... One suggestion for the people on drive-thru.... check your order if it is correct before driving off... Mistakes happen everywhere. It's your responsibility to be satisfied. Morons..."}
{"text":"Horrible location. Hair was in my burger and they replaced the burger but never offered my money back. Thanks but no thanks. Checkers ruined it !!! Will not ever go back !!"}
{"text":"The speaker needs to be updated a bit, however the service is fast and the workers are nice. The food is pretty decent too."}
{"text":"Love the advertise special that they have up for months six dollar meatball sandwich that doesn't exist! And where else can you go and order wings at the highest price in town that come with its  own gallon of  grease ?  Just awful service Jones and Tropicana ."}
{"text":"I go for the food and the ambience. If you know the area, then you know what you are getting into. If you feel uncomfortable just use one of the 2 drive thru windows. The service has always been quick and the patio is always clean. The food is tasty. I love the $1 swirl cones."}
{"text":"This place is kind of new. Finally got a chance to check it out. It's one of those Sonic Burger type of places where there's no indoor dining room and as always, that's not a good thing in Vegas. As I always say, it's either too hot, too cold or too windy. In this case it was too windy.   They also have the walk up window, which is what I did, and they also have an outside dining area with the circular picnic-like tables. They offer pretty standard American fast food. The menu had sections for burgers, chicken sandwiches, chicken wings, hot dogs and a few miscellaneous items. In this case I ordered the \"Champ\" burger with cheese combo. I think it was the #3. Just a standard burger, drink and fries combo. As I ordered, I was the only person in line but very soon a group built up and I noticed a slight problem. As you can see from one of the pictures of the front. There pretty much a sidewalk worth of space for where you order. Right behind that, cars pass through. Now when the group started building up, I found my self trying to find a spot to stand to wait for my order. I just found that to be a pretty bad layout because the seating area is to the side of the store and the pick up window is in the front, not only that but it's the window further away from the seating area. It wasn't that big of a deal but it's just not an ideal layout.      My order was ready within about 5 minutes or so, so it wasn't to much of a deal.      I got my burger and went to the seating area. It has a pretty neat sound system where you can't really hear it from anywhere else but in that area, but the music was kind of odd. I swear the theme music for the Spice Channel was playing. It was that one song where there's like chanting monks in the back ground with the little hip hop drum beat over it. How the hell did they even find that song! Anyway, back to the food.      The first thing I noticed was the fries. The fries were more like the potato wedges at KFC but cut like a regular sized fry. They were good but I didn't get ketchup, and they really needed ketchup. The burger wasn't that great, not bad but nothing special. It tasted like a Wendy's burger. There seemed to be a lot of signs for their chicken wings so I think I should have checked those out. For what I bought, I thought it was good but nothing I would go out of my way for. Especially, if you plan on eating there.      As I said, it was windy outside and it was to the point where I had to put my drink on the wrapper of my burger and I had to keep my fries in the bag  and hold them the whole time because it was so windy. Can't really speak for the rest of the menu but the combo I ordered was good but nothing spectacular.      One thing I found funny though was the bag. It had this \"anonymous chicken posse\" thing and it's a bunch of chickens saying that if if you don't have 20 pieces of wings then you can't hang with us... Why would chickens want to hang with people that have just their wings! Are they cannibals? It's sick and disgusting."}
{"text":"Checkers is one of those places that is going to be either a hit or a miss. This time I lucked out and it was a hit. Those handy dandy mailer coupons that they annoy you with in the mail do actually work on those late nights when you don't feel like going to actually sit down somewhere and eat. This visit was for the buy five get five free buffalo wings. Now granted Checkers wouldn't be the first place to turn to for some chicken wings but don't knock them before you try them. The wings here are actually pretty decent! I went on a night that nobody was in the drive thru so I thought the service would've been fast. The person working the drive thru was honest in letting me know they didn't have any wings that were fresh and or the amount that I was requesting. She explained that they would drop a whole new fresh batch and asked me to park so that they could bring them out to me when finished. Now I never throw a fit when it's for my food to come out fresh because well.. who wouldn't want a fresh order? The fact though that they don't offer any sauce for no additional charge is crazy. For these wings though they were nice enough to give me one free one.. for 10?.. lol thanks? Kills me every time fast food places do this but it is what the hell it is. I left somewhat satisfied and addressed my hunger situation so.. that's all that matters.. I guess.."}
{"text":"Checkers, Checkers...Let's see so I come to this place every blue moon or whenever I receive one of those coupon booklets from them! I despise paying full high prices for their food and most importantly the ice cream! I decided to use a few of the sweet treats ones they sent me and the ice creak was delicious! The day I arrived the drive thru was slammed and of course it took forever. My fault for coming during a peak lunch hour, or better yet their fault for not properly staffing during a time that you call \"peak\"? I'll digress... The total time from when I arrived and departed pushed close to 13 minutes... eh what can you do though? Just keep sending me those ice cream coupons and I'll still give you business! Deal? Deal! **handshake**"}
{"text":"Cold burger, soggy chicken sandwich. Cold wings. The fries were hot! Fries were the only thing good!"}
{"text":"I went there for the first time today for lunch and I'm very disappointed that's going to be the last time I'll never eat there again. The food took forever and the quality was very low the piece of tomato in my burger was bigger than the beef patty!!! . The wings were tiny and soggy! Do not order the chili dog  the chili is very watery and the hot dog are bad quality.They messed up on my order I tried to call to complain and all I got was a voicemail I left a message and still no response. Don't waste you time or money."}
{"text":"this place is crap ate here last night and got sick from it as well did my son it is a crap hole shit place do not spend money here"}
{"text":"I remembered loving Rally's as a kid and was thrilled to find that there is a Checker's in Vegas. Alas, my memory must either not be as great as I though or my tastebuds have severely changed.  My dad ordered the double hamburger and I ordered a small chocolate shake and a spicy chicken sandwich.   The chocolate shake just tasted like melted vanilla soft serve, not really that much of a chocolate taste.  I thought the spicy chicken sandwich was alright and Dad thought the double burger was pretty unremarkable and surprisingly small.  The fries were alright...easily the best part of the meal, which isn't saying too much. Dad tried to get ketchup for the fries by ringing the bell at the front window for service, but no one would come to the window so he ended up eating them dry.  The service at this place is RIDICULOUSLY SLOW. I was surprised, considering it's a FAST food establishment.  I don't normally condone going to McDonald's, but it would be a far better option than Checkers."}
{"text":"I love their cheap burgers and delicious fries. When I first moved here, I was sad and lost, fearlful I would never have a tasty burger again, fearful that all Las Vegas had to offer besides standard burgers was that disgusting In&Out. Seriously, people LIKE that crap? Luckily, I found out while driving to visit friends that there is one on the other side of town. I am sad to admit that when they ask me to come visit, I think, oh, an excuse to go to checkers! Yay!  And then, you wait... forever... to get that tasty burger and fries.. I think they might actually be butchering the damn cow, they take so long.  Still tasty, though!"}
{"text":"Last night I popped by because I told my friend about the fries here and she's never had them. Somewhat friendly staff here. Cashier was a little iffy on how to ring things in. Didn't know how to substitute the drink for a shake. Me and my friends ordered something quick because we were in a rush to get home.   The staff gave me looks for going through the bag and checking my order. I find when it's a big order it usually has one thing wrong lol. They kept assuring me it was right. After I put half the bag back based on trust. I got home and low and behold my large fries weren't in there. I go to checkers JUST for the fries alone and to not have them with my meal totally was a bummer. Plus I have a tomato allergy and I told the girl that. I said whatever I order please put no ketchup or tomatoes. SHOCKING my hot dog had ketchup...   Next time let the customer do what they want with their food, this coulda been avoided if they made it right or didn't give me a hard time for checking the order in front of them. When you pay for something you earn the right to make sure your food is correct.  Maybe being a restaurant manager I have too much expectations. Again I was right though. It wasn't even busy enough to have a messed up order :("}
{"text":"Coming from Southern California, I recognized the restaurant with the decor as Rally's, but a second look and I realized it was Rally's sibling, \"Checkers.\"  I decided to pig out a bit, so I ordered the Baconzilla, Chili Cheese Fries, and try the two apple pies for a buck.   First, it took too long. I was the 2nd car in line, the car ahead of me had to wait 10 minutes for their food which came inside of a tiny bag (I could swear I ordered more than that person). When I got to the window I had to wait almost 10 more minutes for my food   When I got back to my job to actually eat, my bag was missing my fork so I had to make do with a spoon that was available in the break room. I can get past a forgotten utensil, its all about the food right? The burger was cold and the bacon was hard. I only work 5 minutes from this place, it should not have been cold. The fries were also nothing to write home about - cold and salty. It's not really how I remembered Rally's fries - I was just there a couple of years ago and they didn't taste as salty. I didn't finish my food.  There was one redeeming factor: The Apple Pies. Deep fried and covered in cinnamon and sugar. Those were awesome - I finished those!  I think I will only come back for the apple pies."}
{"text":"What can I say about this place . I can't say anything good about this place that's for sure . I read the reviews  on yelp before going here . Talked about going to checkers for a while before actually  going . You would think that since the place seems to always be busy when I've driven by you would assume it's good one would think right .     I went tonight June 28th 2015 to try checkers went there with a open mind . I figured it might be good or it might be not the greatest boy was I wrong this place is garbage . I ordered the bacon burger and got some cheese burger that had way to much mayo for even the above average mayo lover . There fries are nasty and tasted like they weren't cooked all the way .  decided to try a shake and that tastes as if they just dumped soft serve ice cream into a cup . I will not be returning and will tell others to never go to this garbage place of a fast food joint . If I could I would rate this place a -5 stars ."}
{"text":"I spotted this place on a drive-by the other day and started salivating. I used to hit the location on the east side as often as I could. Love those fries! Went in with a group from work and we were promptly greeted by a friendly staff. Order was out relatively quick, but wasn't quite as good as I was anticipating. Good, but not great. Maybe they are still working out the kinks. We dined in, which was a first for me at a Checker's or Rally's. That in itself is enough to keep me coming back. I will return."}
{"text":"This Chekers was the complete worse, the restaurant was messy and the soda machine is very bad. Also the soda machine was mount functioning and kept putting out water on most of the drinks. The service is very slow and the restooms are completely messy.  I will never return to this restaurant again."}
{"text":"Stopped here just to grab a thing of fries. My husband had never had Checkers (Rally's where I grew up), and we were in from out of town where we don't have any. Decent. Nothing special other than having something that I had as a kid (and it didn't disappoint!)  Didn't try anything else at this location, so take my review for whatever it's worth :)"}
{"text":"What happened to the Checkers that I loved?  What happened to the value?  I pull up to the drive through... \"try\" to order a Bacon Checker Cheeseburger (with cheese, of course... someone needs to talk to their marketing department) and a ice-cream sundae shake... it took 40 seconds to clarify that I wanted a shake and not an ice-cream dessert... I pull up to the window and pay $4.15 and they give me a shake... I'm waiting another minute and the worker asks what I'm waiting for... I say my cheeseburger.... she says you didn't order one... another minute and another debit charged to my card for $3.41...well... Shake was AWESOME.... cheeseburger was decent but bacon seemed of cheap quality..."}
{"text":"I'm a little bit surprised by the reviews as I come here every so often. Normally I do kind of tend to come later at night so even if there is a line it doesn't seem to take too long. I've also only gotten food that wasn't hot one time all the rest of the times it's always hot and fresh and they have the best french fries."}
{"text":"All the people I have encountered have been very nice. I have no issues with the people that work there. The food itself is much better than Sonic which was inedible. I am hoping that my last visit was a one-off. I like the fries which are seasoned and yummy. I ordered a fish sandwich on my last visit. When I got home it was over fried and incredibly dry. I had to throw it out. Don't over fry the fish!"}
{"text":"Im FORCED to give it one star, want to give it 0!!!  Fries were burnt and gross, burgers were smashed into the bottom of the bag.  I asked for ranch and the lady said it costs extra then SLAMMED the door closed to the drive thru window. This place will shut down SUPER quick!  Horrible!"}
{"text":"So I have to start this review by saying Checkers is just and over sized Rally Burger! Anybody from So Cal knows exactly what i am talking about right now. I mean from the decor (checkers and red) to the item names (i.e. the Big Bufford) its the same.   Now with that said this does make me happy because Vegas does not have Rally Burgers. And... Anyone who knows me knows I love the fries from Rally's. So that being said I will be back to Checker's.  Overall the burgers are equivalent to Wendy's in my eyes! (Hence the 3 star rating. The fries are carrying this review... Seriously!)   On to service... The drive thru could be a bit faster but at least the staff has been really nice. Cute place to check out if in the area but nothing to make a special trip over."}
{"text":"3 stars only because I was excited that I found one outside of Philly.  The taste was definitely Checkers... along with the attitude sadly.  And my burger was cold.. sure I picked up at the drive thru @ 11pm but cold food when ur expecting hot is not good, and I'm sure ur tired but it couldn't hurt to crack a smile.  Hopefully the next time I come back it'll be better."}
{"text":"Living in this area for a long time, it's nice to see new spots that satisfy your drunken soakage cravings like this one! I ordered some cheese fries and a funnel cake. It was super quick, hot, delish and all under $4! It hit the fatty status spot after some happy hour drinks with no food . Give this place a try its definitely a different style and flavor!"}
{"text":"This Checkers is located on the corner of Deseret inn and Boulder Highway.  It has that old school feel of an old diner except you cannot go inside to eat. I've been here several times of the years and it's just ok to me.  It's not the first place I'll go to when I want to grab a burger and fries.  One thing I don't like about the location is the drive thru.  It's not suitable for longer vehicles and I always rub my tires against the curb when I'm trying to exit the joint.  Besides that I always get coupons in the mail for checkers but I still prefer the more established  burger places because I know what Im getting.  Checkers just doesn't leave too much of an impression with me."}
{"text":"Worst checkers in town!!!! Horrible customer service.... went through the drive through to get the whole family dinner and they forgot 2 burgers. When we got home and noticed we called and talked to manager and he told us to come in and give our name to get burgers any time we wanted them. We went in today 2 days after issue occurred. Waited 20 mins. For manager to tell us she was TO BUSY. WE PAID FOR THE FOOD WE NEVER RECEIVED AND THEN GOT TREATED LIKE CRAP UNACCEPTABLE!!!!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here a few times now and am surprised at how much I like it. I'm not a burger person, so I can't comment on that. The last two times I have ordered the \"BLT\" priced at $1.49 and can't believe how good it is for a fast food place. They aren't shy on the bacon and it tastes good. I also had a small order of their \"Famous Seasoned Fries\" priced at $1.69 and found them to be a bit crunchy and overcooked. Priced at 2 for a $1 the \"Cinnamon Apple Pie\" I had for dessert was a nice finishing touch. The employees here are friendly and they have a dual drive-thru. Even though the fries could use some work, fans of Checkers and Rally's shouldn't be disappointed with the cheap prices and food put out here."}
{"text":"do not come here!!!!!!  terrible I was here with a friend and we were 5th in line. as I was waiting the person at the front  counter came around and locked the doors in the middle of lunch rush. she said and I quote \"we are busy so we are locking the doors. also we are waiting for a 1/2 hour for our food and they don't know were there is and don't know ow what number they are on.  terrible service and no manager on duty and the counter person has been there a month"}
{"text":"So I took my kids here to eat. I figured last time I had Checker it was pretty good. Well times have changed. First they messed up the order. The cashier took 10 minutes to get to the window. While placing the order the cashier was so busy talking to her friend she didn't even pay attention to me. The food quality was so so. We ordered a Baconzilla burger and some chicken fingers.  The fingers were decent. The Baconzilla was terrible. The mayo mixed with the liquid cheese was yuk. The dining area was outside. That aspect was cool however the bum sleeping there was not. Overall I would say the place is a complete dissappointment."}
{"text":"Cheese wasn't melted on my breakfast sandwich (lukewarm), hash browns were still frozen, they forgot to get me my coffee and the lady was rude when I asked her several times if I could have my coffee. Sad day I was really looking forward to eating somewhere new."}
{"text":"First time I went here when they first open on rancho. It was packed. Food weren't what I expected. There's at least 20 workers inside passing around food without any gloves. It was disgusting!!!! Went back here today just to see if there's any improvement. But it was horrible! My food was super greasy and told me to park upfront and wait for 5 minutes for my food. Then it's been 10 minutes so I went back to the drive thru. Serving me greasy food and they passing around my box of food. Didn't even apologize for taking forever and just hand me my food and close the window. Will never recommend this to any of my friends including everyone on yelp. It will just ruin your day. I'm a business owner myself so I know what's satisfaction means."}
{"text":"This is by far the worst checkers in vegas , they have the worst customer service , the girl in the front looks clueless doesn't no what's she's doing , the manager was rude to the customers , as I was waiting there a customer in drive thru complained about her food being cold so she took the burger back opened it and touched the meat basically to let her crew no that it wasn't cold to make a scene , this is the most un organized store there is . Then the manager continued to be a asshole and kicked out a homeless Man PAYING CUSTOMER and kicked him out the store didn't even give him the option to eat , she was so inhumane about the situation ... I hope corporate reads this because they need to do something about this location ..."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service in the drive thru. She didn't listen very while, seems like she didn't want to be there. Messed up our order as we requested certain things & those requests were ignored."}
{"text":"Never thought I'd have to do this to Checker's because their fries + ranch is my drug of choice, but frick! The lady working the drive-thru & the cook (maybe they're the same person - who knows) around 1:00 AM are a WRECK...  As soon as we pulled up to order, she very rudely told us to wait in an exasperated tone. After about 5 minutes, we placed our orders (both simple combo meals) and pulled around to the window, just to get another 5-minute wait. Not a single word exchanged as she took my debit card. A few more minutes later, she tossed our food at us & projected a quick \"thank you,' then slammed the window shut. I couldn't even ask for napkins or ranch...  Sooooo over it, ready to go home, eat, & knock out after a long day of thankless work, I drive home just to find out that my soda was flat & my chicken tenders were so overcooked that I couldn't even bite into them.   Disgusting food, disgusting attitude, I will NOT be dining here again... at least not at nighttime."}
{"text":"Food was good but I didn't know that the dress code included short shorts as part of your uniform"}
{"text":"Poor service, rude staff that looked like they were out all night partying . Food was cold asked to remake and was given attitude and then still cold."}
{"text":"Upon recommendation from my brother, we decided to try this place out. Out of all the food we ordered, our total bill ended up being $42.99. That's to feed a party of six. Although the prices are relative to any other fast food place you could eat at, I was not impressed with this restaurant at all.  The quality of food was not that great, some of the food was lukewarm to cold, the fries were over salty, and the flavor of the sandwiches left a lot to be desired.  Save your money visiting this place and go a few miles down the road to McDonald's or Burger King. You get the same fast food quality of food but better the flavor."}
{"text":"I work nearby so I was stopping in for awhile. The first week they were open I thought they were really good. Now, they've established a bit I've noticed I have not received anything fresh since the first week they were there. I went in last week and decided to sit back and watch. What I saw repulsed me and I will never eat here again. I typically order chicken bites which are always nice and hot but I had been noticing that they tasted like old grease and thought maybe they had not changed the oil in awhile. Little did I know they have trays near the fryers of ALREADY cooked food that they double fry to make you think you are getting something fresh. It takes maybe 3 minutes to cook a fresh batch and instead they are re-frying a batch made probably first thing in the morning. Never again will I eat here. I have a lot of tenants who constantly go there who I am now warning of what they do over there."}
{"text":"Not 24/7, not even the drive thru. Went by to get something to eat at 2:32am and its closed. Wrong info here."}
{"text":"This would be a great location if it were staffed adequately. My food has always been made right and I've never had to repeat my order. They have these amazing funnel cake fries that I can't resist!!!! My only issue is they don't come in large!!!!! Please make these in a larger size for us who need them!!!!"}
{"text":"Date of Visit: 1/8/2016 Time: 7:07 pm  I'm not above eating fast food when it's good. This however, was not...  I was staying at the Hyatt Place (across the street) and was starved. While I love a good German sausage, sometimes you want something fast. Given that Checkers was new and locations in other cities had favorable reviews, and it was across the street I decided to give it a shot.  With Vegas, sometimes you gamble and win. But usually, you gamble and lose. At Checkers, I gambled and lost.  I ordered a plain all American cheeseburger and a 5 piece wings with medium buffalo.  Super tiny wings, these were anorexic chickens. Must have been raised in Beverly Hills, definitely not Foster Farm.  The plain burger came with mustard, ketchup, and pickle. So I sent it back. The\"new\" burger was the exact same burger but with condiments scraped off. Nasty!  Third times is a charm: this time it was a plain burger. But at that point, I was over Checkers. Saw a homeless guy panhandling outside and gave him my burger.  Things to keep in mind:  - You get 1 napkin per entree. Even with wings. So bring wet wipes or napkins. - There are no napkin dispensers. Probably to discourage stealing. - They charge for sauce  On a positive side:  - Lots of places to sit (14 four-top tables) - It was clean and the employees actively bused tables  However, I would not go back again."}
{"text":"Don't be tempted by this 24 hour drive thru.  Got order wrong.  Wings soggy and chewy as it they had been kept steamed.  Fries cold.  Place was dirty.  Would have rather gone thru Micky D's."}
{"text":"Never again will I eat at Checkers. I ordered 5 wings which were over sauced.  The sauce \"poured\" out and ripped the bag open and it got all over my upholstery in my car.  That's a shame. Don't expect me again."}
{"text":"Came here 2 visits prior to the one I had last night 4/9. Two other visits were so-so most likely around a 2-3 star visit. But my most current visit last night was probably the worst fast food visit I've ever had.   Coming home from my parents house around midnight and my fiancé was having pregnant cravings and while passing by the checkers told her the food was pretty good. Which in tun sparked up a craving for her, which led me to take a u-turn to get her food. We went through the drive thru and as soon as the lady at the speaker started talking we could immediately sense an attitude problem. Our order was taken very rushed and made as feel like we shouldn't be there, that our business was unwanted.   We rolled up to the window and this woman with a mean-streak, looking like a cross between an imp and a lame dog chewing gum told us it was 8.55 with the most stern face, no customer service what so ever. After we handed her our cash she then said in the most obnoxious manner, \" can you do me a favor *chomp chomp* can you back up your vehicle?\" And stared at us like hurry up a**hole. So, confused I looked at my girl and was like wteff and reversed. Then as soon as we reached halfway from the window and the order speaker. She closed the window and we didn't make contact for another 20 min.   At this point we were left wondering if this dog/imp was adding special sauce to our food. When the food was ready all we saw was a bag hanging out the window from the hairiest arm, so I pulled up and asked why did I need to reverse and this girl with the most putrid attitude replied, \" it's because we don't want you to wait long for fresh food.\" And with a bat in the cave she struck up her chin didn't look at us twice and slammed the window. Again we were struck with a wteff?!?!?! moment.  As we drove away I had the urge to call the store to speak to the manager, because she ain't giving my fiancé and baby girl special sauce, and lo and behold the same voice answers. I asked for a manager and I was promptly answered between a squeak and a bark that she was the manager, \" ...an the names Elizabeth, ya see!\" I then asked if that was SOP for patrons/ness to reverse their vehicle from the window. And again I was reminded that it was for the reason that they don't want us waiting at the window long for fresh food. When I asked for her name again she said her name was Alyssa. I then said thank you and hung up. On the way home I was astounded by the rude service and the secret-agent man names, on my receipt the name on there is Amy, and vowed never to return to this sh*t hole ever again. I would sooner go on an epic adventure with frodo to mordor than come back to this horrible restaurant.   I was inspired by her actions to call their corporate office, call again at their store to speak to another manager, and write this scathing review. I have never done that before now, but I've also never been treated like this before. All joking aside all the above accounts remain true up to the hairy arm and the booger in the cave."}
{"text":"Not bad. Tried it for the 1st time, went through the drive-thru and there wasn't a line so everything was pretty quick. I got a double cheeseburger, spicy chicken sandwich and an order of chicken bites (no fries so no comment on that). Food tasted fresh not stale or dry and the prices seemed pretty cheap. I think so far better than sonics food. But I have yet to try everything else so I'll be back and update."}
{"text":"First to review!  I've been passing by this Checker's for months waiting for it to be built so I could try it out.  I know we have one out there around Boulder Highway but I never seem to get out to that part of town often.    Going to these fast food joints for a first time, I generally like to try the basics on the menu.  Chances are if you can handle the basics effectively, the rest of your menu should be OK.  With Checker's I was just passing through, so all I ordered was two All-American Cheeseburgers from their value menu for $1 each.    It is their grand opening, and this Checker's was pretty packed.  There were folks filling the dining room and the drive thru was full.  There was noise everywhere behind the counter, fries being dropped, orders being mistaken.  Very likely for workers still trying to get the menu items down since it's all new, so I had no issues with errors this time around.  They just need some time to settle in.  My order was quick and easy to make, so I was in and out of Checker's in no time.  Service was friendly and quick, and the counter layout is very similar to those of other fast food joints like McDonald's, Burger King, and Carl's Jr.  What is the most different on Checker's menu and what makes them stand out is their wing menu.  Yep, orders of chicken wings!  I can see why the place is popular and has a bit of a cult status around these parts of town.  You can get a burger, and some wings all at the same place.  No other fast food giant can offer this currently with lots of success.  Not just plain ol' wings either, Checker's 'Crazy Good Wings' have flavor options:  -Buffalo -Honey BBQ -Asian Kick (hiya!) -Angry Buffalo -Garlic Parmesan  The orders I did see go out of the kitchen looked pretty appetizing.  I may have to try an order the next time I'm around.  Tasty.  Checker's menu is a cross between McDonald's, Burger King, and Sonic's.  You can get your cheeseburgers, bacon cheeseburgers, chicken sandwiches, and fish sandwiches.  But you can also get grilled hot dogs, cheese sticks (which Checker's calls 'Monsterella Stix', and chili cheese fries.  Their fries aren't of the regular tater either, looks like they are seasoned somehow but they do look good.  Another plus, Coca-Cola products!  If you can serve me Coke then you have a star in my book.  Back to my plain All-American Cheeseburgers?  Pretty basic, but they were pretty good.  Actually better than a McDonald's cheeseburger in my opinion.  I like the sesame seed bun, burger (which I think is flame broiled), cheese, pickle, mustard, and ketchup.  It was very similar to the Burger King cheeseburger which I like very much.  Only thing I would change would maybe be more pickle, add some mayo.  It looks like I will probably be back to try something else.  Checker's...now with TWO locations in town!"}
{"text":"Today, need real food before go to Rehab, so when you different cravings collide then you have to enjoy more than one restaurant for lunch. That's what we are doing. Burgers and ice cream from Checkers and ramen from next door! We took it all to go except the ice cream. The ice cream did not make it out the door.   Needing protein keep up our health we ordered Rallys burgers but with out cheese. Their cheese not the best here. The burger were great and gave us both the boost we needed.  The service a rotating door where they seem to have endless new people every visit. Its annoying since they learn what's on their food as I order. The service was fine but not remarkable. The cashier had to constantly ask his manager what's on that, or wheres that key. The manager was nice and maybe cut this employees collar maybe too soon. We all have to start somewhere though? The lobby was very clean but took to go so did not matter anyways."}
{"text":"Checkers is a good spot to grab an all-american hamburger, fries, drink and shake. It's nothing flashy just your average small fast food joint that serves good food and good customer service. All the times I've been here I've never had issue, guess I've been lucky. I usually go through the drive-thru, which could use some work in redesigning it to be more convenient with the space they're working with.   But they're usually pretty quick and the person working drive-thru is pretty friendly and accommodating for the most part. The prices are inexpensive and affordable which can keep them competitive in the market. The location is in a very busy part of town and they area around it is a little sketchy but other than that it's cool."}
{"text":"Very rude service.  Tries hard sell to get you to order more.  Tried to overcharge me in drive through.   He didn't say thanks.  He didn't say anything.  Just passed the food out the window and walks away.  How rude.  You really need to train these people better.  On to the food.  The burgers are dry and overcooked, but dripping with butter.  Not especially appetizing.  At least it was quick.  My first visit at any Checkers - I won't be back."}
{"text":"Friend, \"HEY!! REMEMBER RALLY'S!?\"  Me - \"Yeah?\"  Friend - \"We have one here now, but it's called Checkers on D.I. and Boulder Hwy\"  Me - \"WHAT? No way!\" *hop in my car and took a trip EAST down on memory lane*  First thing that came to mind was the \"Cha-Ching! (Link to commercial http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4lZINjpACE&feature=related )\" and their famous seasoned fries.  They use to have Rally's here in Vegas back in the early 90's but i was so young I forgot where exactly it was.  I want to say it was on Bonanza and Pecos somewhere but i onno?  Help?  Anyways, I don't remember the burgers being this small.  I had the Baconzilla or something.  Two small patties loaded with 4puny slice of bacon, smothered in some gooey-ooey cheese.  Now I remember why i don't do fast food.  Patties are precooked and in a bin before assemble on the line just like mcD's.  Heart attack with every bite.  But the Fries are still awesome!  I could have sworn they had curly fries before that blew Arby's and Jack's out the water, but it's not on the menu anymore.  Still, Checker's (Rally's) seasoned fries are bomb diggity.  Strawberry Shakes are good too here.  Man, I really went all out this time.  Don't know what's gotten into me.  I wasn't even drunk!  Open 24hrs so DON'T drink and drive."}
{"text":"Two stars because I'm pretty sure they have better service. I was there today (first time) and the service was just TERRIBLE! The cashier who took our order seem like she hated her job (Karen) didn't even welcomed us never looked at us while taking our order, had an attitude and she said they did not have ice cream for the stackers. She was rude to every customer that kept walking in. Took us about 25 mins to get our food."}
{"text":"So this is my first time here and I had to admit, it is very clean inside and the staff is very nice. I used their coupons I received in the mail, but I had to admit the portions are small.  If it was bigger, definitely 5 stars."}
{"text":"My sister and I went through the drive through on Friday morning. We come here pretty often early morning because it's 24hr and it's close to my favorite hookah lounge. When we got to the drive thru window we were told that they were no longer taking orders at the drive thru window because and I quote \"the dinning room room is very busy\" even through there was a rather long line at the drive thru.   Luckily, there was only one car behind us. Once we told them that they weren't taking orders at the drive thru window he agreed to back up to let us out. Otherwise we would've had to wait until the 3 cars in front of us left.   When we pulled around to the dinning room.  There were literally three people in the place and two of them left without food. Also it looked like they were telling people to leave because  a few people came in and then left without even ordering."}
{"text":"I received coupons in the mail for checkers and my man kept wanting to get something from there to try. So we went and I ordered a chicken burger and he order two regular burgers (I can't remember the name) but basically they were cold and smothered with so much mayonnaise I couldn't eat it. Nothing special or different here and I wish I would've just went to mcdonalds at least the food would've been hot! On the bright side I ordered a raspberry Oreo stacker- it's vanilla ice cream, Oreos, fudge and raspberry sauce! This was very good and different but I don't think I would go there just for it.  Don't waste your time here !"}
{"text":"Bad customer service and the restaurant manager is horrible. Ask for ice which they ran out of in the lobby but there was some for drive thru and she said NO! She's such a bitch. Went here the other night and she closed down the till to try to do inventory although this place is open 24hrs. I have the footage."}
{"text":"I wanted to late night snack and I drove into the left drive through lane. FYI, one left side, one  right side. Tried to order on the left side. Voice on intercom asked me to go to other side. Well, by the time she asked me there were two cars in the right side. I don't want to order from the right side. Close the lane next time. Took them FOREVER to service the two cars that went right, so I was upset having to wait and back-up into traffic to exit the drive through.   I'm trying not to leave negative reviews this year so I decided to leave constructive criticism.   Manager, do not have your employees as the customer to reverse out of a drive through lane because they did not want to reach across when I was planing to sit in the passenger seat when I pulled up."}
{"text":"This place is disgusting! I have had better food at a gas station! Service is terrible. It takes them forever to take an order and get the order out. The cashier spoke broken English, um you work at an American food place speak English!!!!!!!  Ok second, how does this place pass health inspections? The table have bird shit all over them and you have to bag them to get the employees to wipe the tables down. When they finally do, it's with a hardly damp cloth. No sanitized chemicals, nope just water! DISGUSTING!!!!!!  Third is the food. The loaded bacon fries were ok and so was the chicken bites kids meal, other than that we should have went to Wendy's. I would have taken McDonalds over this crap. I got a spicy chicken and not spicy at all and the meat was fatty. Processed chicken is very gross and I ended up throwing it away, goodby $7! My husband got a double bacon burger and he hated it.  My 10 year old said he would never eat here again but my 2 year old liked what he got. Another thing, don't bring your family here to eat outside unless you like seeing all the hookers walk around and try to pick up their next job. Where is VICE when you need them! Avoid this establishment"}
{"text":"Maybe it's just because its brand new right now, but this is by far the best checkers in the city. Staff is welcoming and attenitive and food is fast. Defiantly recommend if you were fed up with other locations as I was."}
{"text":"Awww Checkers, I'm so glad I found you again after so many years!  I grew up with you but then moved to Vegas and thought we would never see each other again.  Oh happy day because you have now opened a place in town, so our romance can continue!  So, it has been about 20 years since I had Checkers/Rally's.  I remember them being the best burgers and fries in the world.  I was so excited to grab some food here and relive my childhood with my family.  The Baconzilla Burger was tasty, the fried  chicken sandwich was like every other fried chicken sandwich at fast food places, and the fish sandwich was in the same boat as the chicken.  The fries are still pretty tasty being covered in all sorts of seasoning and fried to be on the crispy side.  The food wasn't as fantastic as I remember it, but it was still pretty tasty.  The milk shakes are quite yummy here too.  They even have banana milk shakes, which you don't see often.    The only negative here are the serving sizes on the fries.  The small order of fries looked like it should belong in the kid's meal not the adult meal.  So if you are hungry, go for a bigger size otherwise you will still be hungry afterwards.   The drinks and the sandwiches all seem on par with other comparable places.  The prices all seem a tad on the high side for what you get.  They aren't outrageous, but more than what you will spend at McDs or BK or the like, on a similar meal deal.  This particular location is on a really busy corner, so you have to be careful getting in and out of the place, since everyone drives like maniacs in this area.  It can also take a bit to get out of the parking lot onto the main street again due to the high volume of traffic.  This is not a good place if you are crunched for time.    As for the seating, it is outdoor only, so keep that in mind if you plan on going in the middle of July.  Also with it being on a busy street corner, it is loud sitting outside due to the traffic sounds.  So yes, Checkers is a yummy fast food joint for good burgers.  The fries are tasty, but order a bigger size than normal for yourself.  And lastly, give yourself some extra time since everything is on the slow side."}
{"text":"This Checkers location is new to the area having only been open a few weeks at the time of this review.  It did not take me long to get there to give it a try though I did allow for the few weeks to pass giving the staff a chance to work out any glitches to their processs.  On my first of what will likely be many visits over the foreseeable future I went with my co-workers.  My boss ordered a BLT and the Baconzilla Fries.  The fries did not last long as she went hog wild on the cheesey bacon topped goodness.  The BLT, however, is still waiting for her.  Not because it is bad but because the fries were so good and so filling.  A different co-worker ordered the heart attack special with a side of all around good badness.  She got the Bacon Roadhouse Burger hold the BBQ sauce, a small order of seasoned fries and the Monsterella Cheese Sticks (fried mozarella).  It all looked great and she gave me the two thumbs up sign when I asked how she enjoyed it all.  That is a definitive win from her.  As for me, I ordered the double fish sandwich.  Think about a double Filet-O-Fish from McDonalds and add shredded lettuce.  It was about like that but by the time I got back to the office the fish had gone soggy and lost its crispy integrity.  I'll take McDonalds for the win on this one.  Besides, not much beats the bun McDonalds uses for their fish sandwich.  Anyhow, I also ordered the Fully Loaded Fries.  They are topped with melty cheese, ranch dressing and bacon bits (real bacon).  I ate about half before getting interrupted with work stuff so I set them aside and finished them the next day.  I liked the fries but they were very salty from being seasoned fries topped with cheese and bacon.  It was a little much but to at least have tried them I am happy.  Next time I go I may try either a chicken sandwich of some sort or perhaps one of the many burgers Checkers has to offer.  I would also try the cheese sticks.  They looked amazing and when dipped in marinara they must taste as good as they look.  I would also like to try some of the dessert options in the future.  They have some unique ice cream treats that sound incredible.  This food may not be good for the body but fast food rarely is.  This is food good for the mind.  You can't help but be happy at a place that serves up as much bacon as Checkers does."}
{"text":"Great service Devin was so friendly and helpful, kept asking us if we were ready to order, explaining the deals. Food was hot, fresh and tasty. Thanks!"}
{"text":"We get here there are 3 people standing In line an 1 couple eating the girl goes from behind the counter and locks the door so no one can get in because it was getting too busy. Then proceeded to tell me they do not have a military discount when nation wide everyother checkers does. Than we had to wait 20 min for the food and it was half-assed slapped together. Never coming back here again. And I found shredded plastic in my food"}
{"text":"I am not able to review the food or service, as I was unable to get the girls to stop chatting long enough to wait on me. It was Friday night just before midnight.  I rang the bell, pounded on window, yelled, honked, made funny faces, threw the bird and nothing would get them to stop yacking!  After 15 minutes I had to leave."}
{"text":"No more wishing l was in cali for this..  Glad I stop by to get some, no issues for me, got the food faster than I ordered.. Always a plus!!"}
{"text":"Very rude here. When I got home my order was wrong. This the second time it happen here. So check your food before you leave. The shake machine was down"}
{"text":"Service was poor. The people there act like they hate their life and job. Then went into the restroom and found a cockroach on the floor with tons of toilet paper on the floor and pissed all over the toilet."}
{"text":"Food was horrible! I love the Rallys that we have back in Los Angeles, so when I came across Checkers I was excited.  Total disappointment. The burger tasted like a bad version of Burger Kings whopper. The fries were waaaayyyy too salty and my chili dog smelled like something I would feed to my dog. Never again...."}
{"text":"I had this in Atlanta during a 45 min layover and thoroughly enjoyed the Western Burger (#4 on the menu), so I was super excited to see its here in LV. Def one of my faves, I joke w/ my friends the Im in love w/ a sandwich."}
{"text":"This place is so stingy with the food.Ordered the wings and these wings have got to be the smallest ive seen.Horrible place burger was small.Ordered the chicken bites there was maybe 5 chicken bites and the rest was fries even though they advertise a half a pound.First and last time coming to this place.To add to the insult the place is so dirty trash everywhere in the dining area.I recommend staying away from this place.Wish i would had read the reviews before dining here."}
{"text":"All American Burger for my friend on our way home. She has never had Checkers and I asked her what is your review?  \" The fries are yummy\" another happy eater!"}
{"text":"Before you leave the drive through you must open every item up and make sure they gave you the correct items. Every time they have forget to put cheese on there cheese burgers. There store is on the worst corner so you have to make 3-4 u turns to get in and out of this place. Also expect to wait 20-30 min for your food."}
{"text":"It's too bad I don't have one closer but I do love that baconzilla. Not the best part of town but haven't had any issues with this place. Their drive through experience it's alright I guess.. they just give you the food and shut the window without saying anything.  I just stood there wondering if all my food was given to me or if I had anything else coming. A simple \"here's all your food, have a good day\" would have been nice."}
{"text":"Disgusting do NOT bother... This is my second time giving this place a shot at delivering a good fast lunch. I decided to try the spicy chicken sandwich combo. Literally the bun was so big for a frozen flat pressed piece of non spicy chicken that I had to pull around to wait for. For as long as I waited I was expecting a decent chicken sandwich...nope!  Fries were cold They forgot to give me a side of ranch that I was charged for.   I won't bother with them ever again! I would avoid them it honestly wasn't good."}
{"text":"Workers do not care for there job here i use to love going to this spot before it went to shit now the food taste weird and the workers have shitty customer service would not recommend this spot to no one"}
{"text":"Menu was simple, food was amazing, however service and employees wasn't. Moment I step in I did get a greeting but some of the employees in the kitchen were messing around than working. I understand people leave trash when they leave but no employee cleans it right away."}
{"text":"Best fries ever. Period. Also, the bacon burgers are awesome. the bacon actually tastes like bacon. not like mcdonalds or burger king. the salty goodness..."}
{"text":"I was extremely  excited to bring my kids here for the first time ever. They both really loved everything.   Here's the bad part,  3 of our 5 fries orders weren't part of our finished order.  The chicken in my spicy chicken was lukewarm. My son asked about the apple pies, \"Did they reach into the clouds,  pull out the essence of heaven and inject it into this?\"  Kids were amazed,  parents felt the sandwiches were a little lacking.  Fries are still crazy good."}
{"text":"1st to REVIEW? Really ?  Now in Las #Vegas!!! Located on E Desert Inn Rd/ Boulder Hwy!! Cheap Eats-with 2 drive-thrus, walk-up and outdoor dining.  Home of the $1 Unbelieva Burgers!! Bacon Cheddar Crisp, with real bacon in every bite, the Checker/Rallyburger® or Chili Cheeseburger. That's three BIG, extraordinary tastes for just $1.  Watch out!!! In-N-Out Burger, Fatburger, and all other fast-food burger joints in Las #Vegas. This place has BOMB-ASS chili cheese fries, Burgers are damn good-not charbroiled like BK, or grilled like INO but the diced RED onions on the Cheddar Bacon Burger-WOW!! You got me:)  I will have to make another visit soon since I was in a susceptible state of mind to evaluate any&all food items as GOOD at the time I visited ;)"}
{"text":"I've decided to try this new fast food restaurant that is on Rancho.  That is near my house.   I have only ordered at the drive thru because I like fast service and don't have to wait in line.  I tried their deal the 2 for $6 subs, and ice cream sundae.  This place looks like DQ.  And cheaper then DQ.   I like the drive thru service.  Good and fast customer service.  I'll definitely come back."}
{"text":"Womp womp womp.  Seriously that is what I think when I open the wrapper of a Checker's burger. This place is super close to my house and they sent some coupons out to us in the mail so I decided to make it my lunch today.  Their burgers are SMALL. Maybe it's my hungry Mmmerican appetite and being spoiled with huge plates of food, but the burgers are puny! Definitely nothing amazing going on with them either. Your typical fast-food burger. Inn-N-Out, Smashburger, 5 Guys - all better than Checker's.   Also, they sent me a coupon for a $1.99 CHEESEBURGER combo. I went through the drive-thru and explained that I had the coupon, but I wasn't sure which combo it was. The lady on the other end seemed to know what was up and said what I needed to order was the #13. Sure whatevs! So I pull around and pay for my cheap combo: $2.80 - something like that?  For some reason I had the suspicion she gave me a hamburger combo and I was right! She did give me a hamburger combo! BOO! Come on Checker's if you're going to send out a coupon please give me the right combo meal! I was pining for a cheeseburger all because of your coupon!  I would say go to another place to get your fast-food burger on."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times already. It's in a rough neighborhood but the food is made well. The bathrooms are remarkably clean, and staff are prompt. Thank you."}
{"text":"I went there to get some food I waited in the lobby for 3 minutes the two people making the were not fast after a couple of people came in behind meonly at that point did the lady acknowledge me in lineI waited another two minutes now making it five minutesI then left the service was very very bad"}
{"text":"I rate this place 1 star for a recent trip I made to this location. Myself, 3 drunk friends, and a stone cold sober driver rolled up on a Friday night (Saturday morning) our order was simple: 5 Big Buford's. Once we quieted the fools in the back seat, the man taking our order informed us they are not accepting Credit cards at his time. I figured it was because they were close to closing, no big deal we managed to find enough cash for he burgers. Now then, what truly makes my blood boil is the car DIRECTLY behind us, taking an order mere seconds after us happened to be the rest of our drunk party, and magically the credit card machine worked!  Now, I know we had some drunk hoo-ha, we were not rude, nor belligerent. I am LIVID over this sort of discrimination!  Guess what Checkers?!? I'm going back to Wendy's for my late night drunk fix!"}
{"text":"Awful customer service. Would not recommend going here unless you plan on being treated like garbage. I definitely wouldn't want to come to this location again and deal with this staff. Clearly they don't want to be working here so they should go find a job they actually like instead of taking it out on the customers. Disrespectful, rude, ignorant staff. Less than 1 star for sure. Don't go here."}
{"text":"The checkers in the east coast is so good and this place was completely opposite! It was dry and tasted like freezer burn chicken! Disgusting! Never again."}
{"text":"This restaurant is awesome the fry's are from heaven .nice crew ...and clean ...my shake was perfect I love the Oreo cookie in it"}
{"text":"I did come here late, but that's no excuse to be rude. My receipt says I was attended by \"Crystalynn\" I'm unsure if that's his correct name or not... It was a male with black slicked back hair. Anyway, I placed my order in the drive thru and he was rude from the beginning. I get to the drive thru and I told him he never asked me what sauce I would like for my wings, and he got upset as if I was supposed to settle for plain. I paid for 2 sauces for one of the items in my order & he only gave me one... Once I told him he said \"I'm sure I gave you two\" as if I was lying for a 40 cent sauce and I literally had to empty my bag to show him I only had one sauce! It was my first time ordering the wings and I asked if I could have a ranch with them. His response was \"they ain't free.\" As I was checking my bag he stared at me the entire time making me uncomfortable so I just pulled off and once I got home I realized he never gave me my fries I was charged for. Again, it was my first time ordering the wings so I automatically assumed they were in the wing box. My receipt even says I was charged for them. I'll never return thanks to this one employee and my experience with him."}
{"text":"For a fast food on the go I enjoy checkers. It's pretty rare to find these days so when I spot one I grab myself a treat. They opened one up in a Walmart on Decatur and I was excited about it more than I could say about their employees."}
{"text":"1 star is being generous. There are no lights on outside so as you pull into the drive thru you can barely see the menu. There was no one inside and no one else in the drive thru but I still had to wait 8 minutes for my food.  The burger was not hot or even warm, the cheese was not melted and I order a regular chicken sandwich and got a spicy chicken sandwich that was also not even warm. Bad choice."}
{"text":"I'm laughing while I'm writing this because this was the worst drive thru customer service I ever experienced so rude, i wouldn't even give it one star."}
{"text":"We tried this place for the first time yesterday evening and it was the worst first impression. As we walked in, we immediately told the cashier we were new customers and wanted to go simple for our first order: we wanted 2 cheeseburgers. The cashier tells us they have cheeseburger meals and points to the menu over her head, at a picture. We say great we'll take two and we want both meals the same- cheese and ketchup only on a plain bun, no seasoning/salt on the fries and 2 cokes with no ice. The girl looks utterly confused and now she says she doesn't know if they have a cheeseburger meal. The cashier goes and gets, what looked like, a shift manager, and tells her what we wanted and asks how to push it into the register. Then for the next 8 minutes the cashier can't figure out how we want our burgers! \"So you want mustard and Pickle only?\" \"Okay, so cheese and onion?\" \"Okay, no mustard and tomato but you want everything else?\" \"No cheese right?\" I swear to God! Then she says, \"Okay what don't you want on your cheeseburgers?\" Again we tell her we don't know what comes on them since we've never eaten Checkers before. At that point she shifts her weight, bites her lip, studies the register and says, \"Okay, well...\" I say, \"I don't see what your complication is. I couldn't make it any easier. Just put in what we do want, the list is shorter: I want 2 cheeseburger meals, on both burgers I want ONLY cheese and ketchup on a plain bun.\" She goes, \"Oh okay. Anything else?\" I say, \"Are both cheeseburgers on a plain bun?\" She goes, \"Uh, I don't know,\" and turns to the 'shift manager' again for help. While the 'SM' is at the register I tell her my order in full and she, with attitude, says, \"You can't get your fries unseasoned.\" Fair enough, so I ask her to please not crisp them like she's been doing with the other customers fries and she rolls her eyes at me. During this debacle, 2 customers brought their fries back because they were so cooked they couldn't be eaten. You'd think this would be the end of it but it wasn't. The cashier says, \"Your total is $12.56\" I give her $20.56 in cash. She tries giving me back $6.96. I tell her, \"You said the total was $12.56, I have you $20.56 and now you give me $8.00.\" Instead of giving me my change she hands me the receipt and calls for the 'SM' again. They take the next 2 minutes to talk amongst themselves, ignoring me all together but the cashier was at least honest. Then the 'SM' says, \"Where's the receipt?\" At the same time the cashier and I say I have it. Holding it up, the 'SM' leans over the counter and rips the receipt out of my hand almost giving me a papercut instead of asking me to hand it to her. Then the 'SM' says, \"If you look here, the total is $13.60.\" I say, \"She said $12.56.\" The 'SM' says, \"Yeah, so? She's new. The total is $13.60, do you want your change or not?\" Are you kidding me? Meanwhile my Mom went to get ketchup and the dispenser exploded all over the counter, her sweater and left hand and despite over 7 tries, standing 3 ft away, no one, including the cashier and 'SM' will get her napkins. Instead the 'SM' says, \"Yeah well its been empty for a while.\" The food was good but the service, it took 21 minutes with no line, to order my meal and even then they still forgot to give me my 2 drinks. The cashier had to look at my receipt to see what size I was suppose to get! Absolutely ridiculous and beyond the taste, I would NOT recommend you go."}
{"text":"When it comes to cheap fast food, this is my new favorite place in my area to go to. Burgers, wings, loaded fries, etc. Oh my daym! The prices are really good too. Wish this place was open 24/7."}
{"text":"In need of a fast food fix? Don't want to spend more than $10 buck on a burger? Then Checkers is for you! A friend wanted to go to Checkers and I have not been there before even though I have seen commercials on T. V. and driven by one many times before. My friend said their fries are amazing, so I was excited to try that.   We went through the drive thru and I ordered an American  cheese burger and funnel fries. Yes, as in funnel cake. Only it was in small stick shapes and sprinkled with powdered sugar. There was an option to have it fully loaded- strawberries and whip cream. I passed, but may try it next time. I thought the drive thru said the burger comes with lettuce,tomatoes and onions, but I may need wrong. My burger just came with cheese and I think ketchup and mustard. It had some flavor, wasn't dry, but was very average. The funnel fries were hot, slightly spongy, and sweet with powder sugar goodness. This could be dangerous. Luckily it comes in small, but I still mananged to get powdered sugar on my shirt. Lol. I tried some of my friend's Checkers fries and that was a game changer. It had a batter on it and was perfectly fried. Peppery, salty, and crispy. It reminds me of the outside of a good fried chicken only it was in the form of a French fry. This is definitely their winning item on their menu.   They have an outside seating area, but it didn't look very clean. There were big pigeons all over the place too. Maybe the birds are some sort of cleaning team picking up the scraps and leftovers because those birds were unusually big. Will not be eating out there, but I will come back in the drive thru for the fries alone though."}
{"text":"I really don't have to say much. The picture says it all. I'm really in shock that they didn't even catch this before serving it because uhhhh THATS A HUGE PIECE OF MOLD. When I called the manager didn't really seemed too surprised that this happened all she asked is if I want my order replaced or my money back. I will not eat here again."}
{"text":"I tried Checkers for the first time today,  and I have to say I'm in love with this place. Their seasoned fries were hot and delicious. I also ordered the double fish sandwich which was bomb as fuck! I'm a fish lover and this definitely hit the spot. Excited to go back and try more of their food!  ;)"}
{"text":"Great food!! Absolutely the best on the west side for sure. Service is slow. Drive thru didn't know we were waiting to order for 23 minutes. . And then we waited another 20 mins for our food. We got garlic and honey Bbq wings. And a #5 bacon cheese burger . Food was hot fresh and yummy. But customer retention is obviously not a priority to these guys .... step it up checkers"}
{"text":"I don't know what everyone's raving about. Sonic was much better. Customer service was shit, cheap ass burger was cold."}
{"text":"Not what I expect. It was a long wait to order and for our order to be cooked. The wings were so small and so was the burgers. Fries were delicious need to improve their customer services"}
{"text":"I love it. Customer service is great. Got chicken basket and all American cheese burger. 10/10. Every time I come to Walmart I will return to the checkers. I want to try everything and see how it is."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service, they can never get my order right ! The one time I actually when in my father went to get his Chinese takeout from across the way while I got my checkers food and someone left a nasty note on his car saying he didn't look handicapped, nice of the checkers employees to let that happen . I don't know why I keep coming back I mean the food is not that good is rather go across the street to McDonald's"}
{"text":"They get 2 stars because the food is decent (the fries amazing!), but if I could rate service separately, we'd have to go into the negatives.  First of all, while they are \"fast\" food - you could design, build, and crawl through your own drive-through before getting to the window of theirs. Not that I was in much of a hurry, but I didn't feel like burning through a tank of gas for some fries and burger. By the time I got the order, I was just happy to be getting out of there, so I didn't bother to check what they gave me.  This must be their intent.  The SINGLE thing they got correct was the TYPE of burger. EVERYTHING else in the order was wrong, wrong, wrong. Sadly, I cannot even blame a language barrier for their incompetence - my server spoke perfect English.  I ordered unsweetened tea. First sip? BLECH!!! So sugary my heart started racing. While it was nearly a gallon's worth in their giant size (I ordered a medium), it all went down the drain because neither of us could stomach it.  I ordered a large fry (to share with my sweetie) - paid for it, too. Even checked the receipt to make sure I wasn't nuts. Size I actually got? Small. Kid's size perchance? There were maybe 6 fries total. They were yummy, but not what I ordered.  My burger didn't look anything like the picture, but that's to be expected. What I didn't expect was to order a cheese/bacon burger with pickles and onion and NO TOMATO only to get the exact opposite - NO pickle, NO onion, EXTRA tomato. Ick. I swapped with my sweetie for the one that was ordered as-is. Guess what was on it? Nothing. Nada. No condiments other than a splotch of what I think was BBQ sauce pooled on the tip of one side. At least they got the cheese right.  Again, the food wasn't too bad taste-wise - but if you want what you actually order, have them repeat it to you, repeat again, maybe go a third round, and then check your bag before you leave."}
{"text":"This is now the second or third time I've had major issues here , over simple things that really shouldn't be issues like being friendly while taking my order .  Tonight was the last straw when I was ordering with Christina even though my receipt says Nicholas . Turns out she is the owner of this checkers . While placing my order I was admittedly indecisive but felt like I was being rushed which Christina apologized for while doing my refund for something she over charged me for because she felt saying spicy chicken sandwich meant I wanted a $6.19 combo which is why I was extra slow upon paying because I suck at math and doubted myself and at this time she wasn't all that friendly and being someone with anxiety I'm more sensitive but anyway ended up having to do a refund for that and opted not to even get the sandwich since she didn't know the ala carte price for that and felt something was weird about the fact I wanted a large soda by itself (which was for my mom) the sandwich was my thing and I don't like fries and the past few times they had gotten my sandwich wrong so I wasn't even sure I wanted it anymore after all this so she did kindly refund me for the $4 and some change which to me is a lot on a single income . Anyhow I waited for my order and they still had not gotten my sons Soda to me when the gentleman gave me my order friendly and all I requested my kids Coke just for Christina to get it for me with attitude and blatant disregard to my saying thank you ! I asked the kind gentleman her name since the receipt had someone else and found out she is the owner . Let's just say the weekly trips and 5 star review are definitely gone I will he giving my business to wetzel from now on . My kids may end up still wanting this from time to time and possibly my mom but I for sure won't be eating .."}
{"text":"No stars if possible. Have gone to other locations with good service, but this one in particular does not measure up. Saturday morning, at about 3am, no other cars behind me in the drive thru, only 1 car in front of me. I  waited 10 minutes for them to take my order at the drive thru speaker. I continue to wait for 15 minutes more after placing my order, until I  finally get to the window and the cashier tells me that my order has been \"accidentally\" canceled and if I want to place my order again?!? Ridiculous! I'm usually patient if I know the place is busy, but there was NO ONE else there! Awful customer service!"}
{"text":"I have to admit I only got into checkers cause it was near to my hotel and it was late at night. Otherwise I think I might never had this experience. Well, i wouldn't mind if I hadn't, lol.  Checkers seems to be a well known American fast food chain. But here it starts, at this location nothing, i mean really nothing was fast! When i entered the restaurant i had a group of four and a couple in front of me. It took unbelievable 30 minutes before i was ask what i want. Oh ok, i wasn't ask, it was looked at me and i figured it now might be the time to order :).  Ok I did that, ordered my food. It took another 15 minutes to get it. Of course not everything was right the first time, so i had to go back and asked for the correct items. Of course, what was I thinking, that when everything was prepared slowly that that would be a sign of accuracy. Stupid me, lol.  OK, the Burger was ok, the boneless chicken wings as well. But nothing special. But all so greasy, with all the time they needed to prepare the food, they don't take the time to let the items that are deep fried rest and get the fat out. Overall I don't think it was worth the wait and the quality was not that good at all. But I have to admit it was a funny time watching the four (!) worker preparing the food. Or whatever they calling this slow moving process. Or did i get it all wrong and it is the first slow fast food chain?"}
{"text":"Ordered chicken wings. Were very good but hoped to have more. The rediculous part was that I couldn't get a ranch with my food without paying 45 cents. I can go to any other place to get more wings and free ranch."}
{"text":"So after watching Undercover Boss S03E04 (yes I know I'm like 5 years behind), I thought I'd would try out our local Checkers.  My first disappointment was the lack of double drive thru.  The TV show billed them as the \"worlds largest double drive thru\" and this store didn't have it. Oh well.  However what they did have was the most crisp sounding intercom speaker system.  It was kind of weird how well the cashier sounded.  We ordered the chilly cheese fries and a chilly dog.  Both were disgusting.  The chilly was sour on both items.  The chilly dog used a low quality bun that disintegrated in my hands.   The hot dog was also very thin and had a tough chewy consistency.  I was very disappointed in the food and would probably never go back."}
{"text":"Had to go back the very next day, it's that good! Me & my boyfriend have been dying to try this place and it definitely surprised us. We literally drove across town to eat there again."}
{"text":"They put the hot wings in the bag sideways so all the sauce soggied up the bottom of the bag and my husbands shorts. And then we discovered we were missing a burger! The food we did get was fine."}
{"text":"Very great service!!  The best drive thru ever!!  They servers it fresh and we did not have to Waite or repeat order!!  Friendly staff!!  Great tasting food!!"}
{"text":"Go to Mc Donalds,this place sucks!  Service was good, but the food sucks.  The best thing I got was my soda.   There so stingy with the lettuce! 1 tomatoe,  and a square of cheese that is smaller than what where use to.  The onion had alot of flavor though.    My husban told me this place sucks!  But I decided to try it anyway!  I should have ran, I shouldn't have turned right!  lol"}
{"text":"The dining room is dirty, bathroom disgusting trash all over floor and urine on toilet seat, service was horrible. When i came in the cashier never acknowledged me I stood there almost 10 mins and finally asked if they were going to take my order. I loved this place in past not going here anymore. Too bad."}
{"text":"Their drive thru is so slow that I just gave up and drove away.  There were two cars ahead of me but I waited about 20 minutes.  There was a car behind me so I couldn't even leave if I wanted to. Finally the car behind me gave up and left so I could back out and leave.  A drive through should not take over 20 minutes.  I hadn't even ordered yet.  It would have easily been over half an hour."}
{"text":"I love the fries, technically the only good thing I've ever gotten at Checkers. Last night, even that was bad. The clerk taking the order seem to have an attitude and a smart ass tone. If anything avoid this location. We got some chicken things, small little chicken balls, we got a bone inside of it. Disgusting!!!"}
{"text":"My husband picked up through the drive thru last night, and what a sorry disappointment. If only their food was as good as it looks on their website. My hubby and I both got a Bacon Roadhouse Burger, and order of baconzilla fries, and 2 apple pies.   The bacon roadhouse burgers were over cooked, old, and stale. On my burger, specifically, I had 1 whole crispy onion that was the size of a .50 cent piece, and about 3 tiny broken pieces as well as possibly the worst BBQ sauce I've ever had.   Next up, the baconzilla fries. I was actually pissed. No where's in the description does it state that the douse the fries in ketchup along with cheese and bacon. Did I mention that I loath ketchup? The fries were also cold and stale tasting and the ketchup just screwed it up completely.   The only thing that was worth anything was the apple pit and the $1 we paid for each is exactly what they were worth... Never intend on going back to this place."}
{"text":"Fries where not good at all. Kind of mushy and weird seasoning. They charge for ranch. The burger was nothing to brag about. I had to ask for ketchup. Coupon made it worth a try- tricky parking lot to pull our of to make a left hand turn."}
{"text":"Not bad for a quick bite before heading to the race track with my two young boys. Not what I would choose for a night out with the wife but kids in tow its a good burger."}
{"text":"First time at checkers and compare to other fast food restaurants that serves wings , i'd say this one is the best so far, the wings are big, tender, not dry and it's delicious . So as their famous fries! Wish we had checkers in Toronto!"}
{"text":"I went to Checkers for lunch on Sunday, during a dance workshop I was attending.  It was a standard fast food experience. The fries were awesome, and the cheeseburger was tasty.  Oh, they put cheese on a burger that I requested WITHOUT cheese for my lactose intolerant friend, so that bit kind of sucked.  I really had to dock a star for that...poor guy was miserable.  :("}
{"text":"Meh. I'd had Checkers once before, on the other side of town about a year ago, and it was pretty darned good.  I was SO excited that there was a Checkers opening up near me!  After having a really rough day and night, my fella and I decided to just drive through for dinner.   The food was ok.  It wasn't spectacular, but it was a step above McDonalds, and a good alternative to Jack in the Box. The burgers were standard, but they got the \"special\" orders right (no tomato for me, no mayo for my fella), and I thought the fries were great, although they were cold when we got home, but that was our fault.  We also tried the fish sandwich, which I thought was pretty good too, although I'd have to have the sauce on mine (fella doesn't like that kind of sauce).    I don't know that I'll make this a frequent stop, but I think its great, like Emily R said, to have other junk food options in this area.    Service was nice, and there were no bugs or bug parts in my food (which I was terrified about after reading the reviews...which I read after we ordered), so I'm pretty happy with it."}
{"text":"The food here is really good actually,  but the service sucks, wrong orders all the time and their phone number doesn't work."}
{"text":"My box of loaded fries came with a surprise: A DEAD FRIED COCKROACH!!!!! Luckily the incompetent employee forgot to put fork in my bag so I had to pick cheesy fries by hand and that allowed me to notice the bug!!! Big one too."}
{"text":"I used to like this place. First I was told that if you get the 2 for 5 deal but only get 1 its 2.50. Ok so I order 1 get up to the window and get charged almost 4 dllrs. Ok whatever I leave. I get home and there are hardly any fries in the fries I ordered and they are soggy and nasty. Then my fish sandwich was like a hockey puck. I think I will be headed somwhere else next time."}
{"text":"I spent a half hour trapped in the drive thru! No lie- a half hour and only 3 cars ahead of me when I pulled in. I would have left after the first 5 minutes with no movement, but once you're in and someone gets behind you, you're trapped.   Just when I got up to the window to get the food, the guy in a huge GMC Yukon in front of me ran out of gas and blocked the exit for 10 more minutes.  They usually have 2 drive thru lanes open but for some reason they had the left side closed. Brilliant.  It's Ok though because I was entertained while I waited by a ranting and raving homeless woman hanging out in the outside dining area who was alternately screaming at an imaginary person in a stream of expletives and sobbing.  Other than that I like the Big Buford burgers- that's their top level double cheese burger. They're large and tasty. Good fresh toppings. They stand up to any of the other fast food places signature burgers for taste and value.  They also have a good variety of menu items with frequent specials running.  The fries are pretty bad IMO. They are kind of like the curly fries at other places but straight cut. They have some spice cooked into them that I just don't like.  If I hadn't had the really bad drive thru experience I described above I would have given them 3 stars. Their service is hit and miss usually. Also, I wish they had a location in a better neighborhood as that area is pretty sketchy after dark."}
{"text":"I have coupons, the food is hot and cheap.  Can't complain i guess.  Just don't eat fast food  everyday!  Oh and have coupons.   I said that already.  LOL"}
{"text":"Yelp says they are closed, but they are open??? New guy on register didn't know how to substitute a shake for a drink. There was only 3 people working a lunch rush. Wait times on the screens exceeded ten minutes or more. I'd have left, but I needed something before work, and I was already there. Food was hot and tasted good though. But the banana split shake is SUPER sweet. Just a warning."}
{"text":"Burger was dry as hell. Patty was tough. I had to add condiments at home. Milkshake was watery... If that's even possible! The wait wasn't long, but the customer service was crap. Didn't notice until I got home but Danielle charged me for a large fry when I ordered and received a value.  I'll just call it a total loss."}
{"text":"This place... I always come here on drunken nights after the club.. This line after midnight is so long!!!!! It's 2 people working and 45 minute wait!! For some damn chicken strips!!! Every time I go here on a Saturday it's this long!! My thing is this.. If you know this is going to be your busy hour or time why not staff for that?   Last night I finally got to the window only to hear the girl with glasses and the other ghettos girl going off about the previous customer.. Talking about how that bitch didn't order that and just bad mouthing the person who just left.. Mind you.. The window was open, they were standing in it facing me.. Loud and very vulgar.. They said some words I didn't even know existed!! And I cuss like a sailor!!   Also... I don't ever get everything I ordered.. I'm going back today to get my food.. This is sad..   The food.. It's checkers food.. 3 stars is for the food.."}
{"text":"I really loved the food that's my first been there and it's was very nice service the young girl she was very nice. I really appreciate thank you"}
{"text":"Totally nasty, extra-greasy food from hamburgers (not fully 100% real beef) to fish sandwiches (more fish coating than fish).  The French fries are ALWAYS over seasoned; too salty.  I have been trying to give this fast food restaurant a chance with no success; I have been here at eight times ....but today is my LAST time.  Lots of thugs go to this location (lots of low-income weekly apartments down the street); due to this it's location.  One time was there I seen a young thug try to start a fight with an innocent older gentleman inside this restaurant on March 21 2016."}

{"text":"its 7pm Monday night no body in the drive,,,  I ordered a #4 cause I love red onion my brother likes some other one I forgot. I was driving paid,given the drinks and bag, I handed it to my brother. hes always in a damn hurry. That stuff was nasty and Cold. A 1/2 inch or less in size  of a red onion on it. I didn't even open the bag til I got home because he was in a hurry!!! But yesterday we ordered 2 bistros burgers for 5 bucks and they were delicious!!! Tonight's bill was over 15 bucks,so the more you pay the worse food you get. I don't get it. Not even sure why the food was given to us cold.and nasty!!!  (again to call the health board tomorrow)!!! But,,,,, P.S. I do have to say the ice tea was good,and the cashier lady was just okay!!!"}
{"text":"What fast food chain doesn't Las Vegas have anymore?   Checkers is a retro, 50s/60s drive-in style fast food joint, kinda like Sonic was before they decided to ~modernize~ it. Yuck.   The building looks quite large from the outside, but upon walking inside the seating area is quite small. It is a drive-in style restaurant, so the emphasis is more on outside seating and/or eating in your car. Well, at this location only the former appears to exist. Unlike other drive-ins I've seen in the past there were no car stations. Huh?   Okay, well on to the food. I ordered a Double Checker burger, large fries and a chocolate milkshake. The fries were amazing. Well seasoned and greasy enough to enhance the flavor without just being greasy. The milkshake was thick and quite divine. It was as if Ixcacao (the Aztec goddess of cocoa) had brewed the concoction for me herself! It was almost better then In-N-Out's milkshakes. Almost.   The burger was just okay at best. It was competent but beyond that nothing really stood out about it. It was about a step up from McDonald's at most, and considering the price, not something that's worth going out of my way for. The milkshake and the fries are however.   The Final Verdict  Pros: Retro, drive-in decor and vibe.  Great fries and milkshakes.  Cons: Tasty but non-exceptional burgers.  Huh?: A drive-in that doesn't have eat-in-your-car stations? What blasphemy is this?  Return Factor: 6/10. Only if I'm in the area and happen to have a craving for the fries."}
{"text":"Have gone here twice in the last two years and both times there was a hair in my food  , of course discovered once I get all the way home. You've been warned !"}
{"text":"Really cool spot when your on the go, and surprisedly clean. Great place for Students"}
{"text":"This place is God awful, the worst customer service you can imagine. every 5 steps you are asked for a $1. The Mangent is very bitter and bad experienced. Hated it!!!"}
{"text":"Slow slow slow, ten minutes to get our food, and they messed up my simple  order twice. How hard is a cheeseburger no meat or onion. The cashier was great and rung it up correct. It was the rude linecook Brenda who argued with cashier it was right ....no vegetarian options except fries and shakes. Unless you eat breakfast. Dining area is clean. Water cups are about 4oz. Fries are tasty but I will never return. I'll starve instead. Undercover Boss didn't work."}
{"text":"I have a love/hate relationship with this fast food joint. Love it because nearly everything tastes so damn good. Hate it because EVERYTHING is so damn bad for you!  Their french fries really are the winner here. They're amazing as long as they're served hot and fresh. They don't make for a very good save for later and nuke'em option, so don't bother.  The large drinks are actually LARGE compared to other fast food places. The outdoor sitting is decent, but I wouldn't recommend it unless you don't mind inhaling vehicle exhaust along with your meal since the location is pressed up against two extremely busy cross streets - Boulder and DI/Lamb.  The only thing I'd stay away from is the chicken bites. Although tasty, every time I ordered them there'd be a gnarly piece of fatty chicken in the bunch..ya know, the kind you really can't chew and ya either swallow it or just spit it out into a napkin.. ugh, makes my toes curl when biting into something like that for some reason. So, not the best quality of chicken (or whatever they're made from nowadays).."}
{"text":"Terrible food Fries were cold and dripping in old oil, would be nice to change the old fryer oil . Burgers were DROWNED in mustard   Oh yes no napkins or ketchup without going back to the counter   Pass!!"}
{"text":"Seriously!!! It's like they haven't cleaned the oil fryer or changed the oil since it opened ! It's gross the fries taste good then about an hour later will give you bad stomach ache and heart burn! Where you can keep tasting that disgusting oil that was cooked with the fries ! Like get it the Fu@&$ together you only been open months tops !"}
{"text":"Why do people like the food at checkers?  First off the burgers come with fake cheese that must be a sauce that comes in a can.  It tasted like a slimy, over salted, artificially flavored, thick oil. The meat was gray and flavorless - tasted more like tofu.  The bacon had to be fake.  It didn't taste like bacon - more like smoked cardboard.  The bread was super soggy and bland.  I took two bites and threw it away.  I tried a bite of the steak burger and it was even worse - tasted like salty old used grease from a diner.  It's been 5 hours and I still feel nauseated.  This is the WORST burger ever!  Go to Rumrunner, Whitecastle, or In-n-Out, but not this place!"}
{"text":"This is my first and last time at this Checkers or any other. There is NO management. The three staff members walked around like they were lost. I ordered the most simple thing on the menu (Chicken Dippers & Fries) for my 9 year old grandson.It took 27 minutes to get the order. Just not acceptable in my world. Yes it is cheap to eat there but the chicken fingers had a ton of black pepper on them and the fries although seasoned well were just plain soggy. What a horrid place !!! They need corporate management to go in fire everyone and then put a trained staff in place and Yelp needs to implement a zero rating because one star is way too good for this place !!!."}
{"text":"I'm so sad and disappointed. Food was yucky. Burger small and cold. Fries ok.   Location is great, employees nice.  Just yuck food. Boo."}
{"text":"Not bad at all. Aside from an extremely loud and abrasive \"couple\" having a verbal domestic at the table nearby, I can safely say that my first trip here was pretty good. Reading most of the reviews before me I can only think that these people forget what they're reviewing - a FAST FOOD JOINT (who's entire aesthetic is cheap food and \"laid back\" vibes). Lower your expectations folks.  I had the Checkerburger combo and was pleasantly surprised to see that they had sweet tea on tap. Burger was actually quite good, like a bargain Double from In & Out. The soda machine *appears* to be dispensing too much water with its mixes but it's just a visual issue, flavor was on point.  Staff were outrageously polite for the location and \"clientele\" this location was getting, and the place was very clean! Will definitely be going back, either for drive thru or dine in."}
{"text":"My greasy, guilty pleasure.  I really like the look of this drive-thru. There's 2 lanes, but rarely do I ever see the other one opened. You can sit outside and enjoy your meal if the weather permits.  My favorite order here is their double bacon cheeseburger. YOU MUST ORDER THEIR SEASONED FRIES. They are amazing! Their fully loaded fries are equally enjoyable as well.   I'm only rating this place a 3 due to my most recent visit. The ranch was extremely oily =( I couldn't enjoy my meal how I usually do because of this.  Overall, this isn't a bad place to grab lunch or dinner at."}
{"text":"It's 1:29am they told me they are out of Meat and they couldn't sell me anything at all.. I find that hard to believe. Not one thing at all could have been sold to me really.. Place closes at 3 am it's only 1:29.. They need to fix this!! Miami locations never ran into a issue... Get it together!!!"}
{"text":"Food is ok. Nothing too special but in this particular location they get so stingy with the ketchup and sauces. Like if you haven't purchased anything from them. So unprofessional. Not to mention that every cashier seems to hate their job. In order to use the restroom, one has to ask them."}
{"text":"From the drive-through window couple  pieces chicken and fries ...  hot and grease but not buffalo hot  I just ask for hot sauce on the side ok.. NO BLUE CHEESE DRESSING .. OHH WELL ."}
{"text":"Checkers gets 3 STRONG stars!  I grew up in San Diego on Rally's. This is the same franchise so if you like the good ol' Rally Burger and seasoned fries like no other then you will love this fantastic joint! Remember the Rally fries? Oh yeah!  I never knew of this location until one day my friend who lives over in the Eastside of town took me here for lunch. WTF I have been living in Las Vegas for five years and this is the first I am finding out about Checker's?   I wish there was one over in the old SW/Spring Valley area of town, oh well I will just stop in when I am over hanging with my Eastside buddies!  Ok so try the following menu items I have truly enjoyed.  1. Honey BBQ wings!  2. Famous seasoned fries and or chili cheese fries which they load up baby! No skimpy skimpy here!  3. Chili cheese dog  4. The big buford cheeseburger! Double pattie and cheese! This is a burger that will satisfy guaranteed!  5. The Baconzilla burger if you dare!  6. Chicken tenders are bomb!  7. Spicy chicken sandwich is great as well!  8. Cinnamon apple pie turnover, mmm bubbly and oozing!"}
{"text":"In San Diego I had Rally's and here in Vegas I have Checker's as they are one in the same. I used to eat here a lot in back in the days and in High School because they had tasty food and a variety from the norm.   I have to say my last two visits to this location has sucked spiky balls, not soft and warm ones! So after a night out of party time with the ladies we stopped through to grab a bite. We placed our order and wanted two apple pies which are boldly advertised on their menu and signs.   The cashier tells us they have none ready, so we ask can they be made or is it just not an option? The cashier informs they could be made and would take ten minutes to make. Ok so we passed on it and drive up to the window to pay for our order.  We sit at the drive thru after paying for 15 minutes waiting on our order. We ordered four items so I would hate to know how long the wait would have been for a large order. I told my friend had I known it would have taken 15 minutes for our order anyways then I would have ordered the Apple pies for us.  No apology for our wait, the cashier literally shoves my friend our bag of food and shuts the window. We wait and ask for ketchup and I swear this troll rolled her eyes at us and hands us the ketchup packets.  This was our last visit as our previous visit was a crappy experience with shitty service as well. I did see the Undercover boss episode for this chain and am disappointed that this store fails so bad.  The staff has attitude and is just plain rude with a don't give a shit attitude."}
{"text":"12:30pm 6/13/15. Rest rooms are clean. The food is ok I guess. Well I'm not happy that the employees are not allowed to open the doors for ventilation, it's in desperate need.  Inside the dining area, it smells like if a homeless person lives in here."}
{"text":"I literally waited 20 minuets for sake and spice chicken.  They said pull up to wait no one was behind me. Once I had a bite my chicken patty was cold. Smh"}
{"text":"Edgar is an exceptional worker very attentive,and helpful!! (Needs raise )"}
{"text":"Waited I  line for 30+ minutes I got in the lin e and couldn't get  out cause there we so many people. So I waited when I got to the window ask why was told it was shift change really ?  Got my good wings  they were so dry  I'm sure they were cooked earlier and recooked  no ranch asked  and was told not unless I had to pay extra. Yikes!  Got home wings were gross and I throw them away.   This morning I called the 800 number a central # for complaints.  Went back with receipt  told nothing they can do with  out food.  Will never go back.  It was not fast food"}
{"text":"I know I said I wouldn't come back, but their fries are just that good. I stopped by to get babe a spicy chicken sandwich and the meal cake with fries and a drink. He says he enjoyed it, so yay. I had their chocolate shake and fries and the seasoned fries are just sooo good! The service this time around was much better, didn't take as long, and the guy was super sweet. That's how it should be!"}
{"text":"Anyone who knows anything about me can attest to my love for all things bacon, so when the first two burgers have copious amounts of bacon and they're advertising loaded bacon fries, I'm already in a good mood at any restaurant I'm going to preface this by also saying I don't really like to eat fast food, but this place was off the chain!!!! I had the number one which is supposed to be the most popular, loaded my fries up with bacon, because why not. And topped it off with a BLT since I'd already killed my diet. The burger was delicious, everything was fresh and well made. I really loved the loads fries but thought it was weird that I had to order them without ketchup since it comes with cheese sauce and whatnot. But they came with lots of bacon so all good Overall I thought the food was great here. It's a pretty neat burger joint that'll get the juices flowing"}
{"text":"Staff was friendly the food took a little long but they were busy. With only 3 people working on a sarurday night they did a good job."}
{"text":"What a joke.  Our son had seen the Checkers comercial on television.  $2.00 meal deal.  A sandwich and a small fry.  Pretty good,  right?   We thought so too.  We ordered  two Checkers burger with cheese  and one fish sandwich and a small milkshake.  What  we received was two cold, tasteless burgers, one rock hard fish sandwich  ( old), two, not three fries and a milkshake.  All for just over $13.   What happened to the $2 meal deal.  Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"This Checkers location recently opened up on the corner of Jones and Tropicana in the Smith's shopping center.  I've never been to Checkers. The food was decent for fast food and the prices were low. I wasn't too excited about this location, but it's good to have a little more diversity in the area for junk food."}
{"text":"This place sucks! The night shift manager is rude as hell! Call me a glutton for punishment, but this is the second time we have been here this week. The first night, she said they were closed because their system was down or something. But after we reasoned with her, the system was miraculously restored. Tonight, the ice machine was down in the eat-in side. The manager was telling that there was no more ice even though they were on with selling drinks and combos. We had to ask for ice from the drive-through side. It was just our cashier who was sweet enough to go get the ice for us. Come on! Yes, it's Las Vegas. It's not the best city for service, but come on!!!! If you can't provide your customer with service, close the fuck up and reopen when you got your shit together!"}
{"text":"We attempted to get a late night something here sat in line at the drive thru for around 10 minutes finally able to pull forward only to realize that no one was working the drive thru at all.  No signs posted saying drive thru was not in service at all.  Then someone came to the window only to tell us we would have to come in because people didn't show up to work so they weren't running the drive thru.  Ummm no thanks!"}
{"text":"Love the food but drive thru is so slow. The lady at the window is always so rude. Horrible customer service. Not returning to this location."}
{"text":"I got the buffalo wings combo. The taste is great but the size is super small &&you have to pay for sauce even with a combo. I didn't like that cause I assumed it would be in my bag already. Major pet peeve for me.The funnel cake is delicious but again very small."}
