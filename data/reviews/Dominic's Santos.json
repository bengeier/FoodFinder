{"text":"I love Santo's homemade pasta, especially the Cavatelle with exceptional marinara sauce. It's up there with the best I've ever had The pizza is also yummy. Salad, however is horrible iceberg lettuce with a harsh vinegarette and that cheap shredded cheese. So 5 stars for pasta, pizza, and sauce."}
{"text":"I decided to visit this restaurant after driving by so many times and seeing the parking lot full of cars.  I visited during the lunch hour and was told to sit anywhere. There were customers sitting at about 5 other tables. I was brought bread and butter which was very fresh and tasted good. I ended up eating all three slices. I ordered Salad with Fried Egg Plant , Lasagna, and Iced Tea. The Salad with Fried Egg Plant tasted great. The salad was fresh and the egg plant was perfect. It was a very large serving and I was told by my server the the Fried Egg Plant was home made. The lasagna was served piping hot, however I was not very fond of the lasagna as it was very unremarkable. I couldn't tell if it had any Ricotta Cheese or meat in it because it was so drenched in sauce and cheese. The lasagna is the reason for the three star rating.  There were about four employees that I noticed. One was waiting tables and the other three were in the kitchen. When my lasagna was ready it was brought out by one of the kitchen staff. The establishment was very clean and tables were quickly cleaned up. The two employees that served me were very friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"To eat at Dominic's Santos is to sit at the Raffins' kitchen table. At any time the owners can be spotted back in the kitchen with their aprons on, plating something they're proud of. The service is always friendly and personable and the food never disappoints. You'll be ravenous after trying to find parking- but fear not because the bread is phenomenal and a salad shortly follows. I personally salivate for the handmade Cavatelli and Meatballs. Their large portions allow you to take home the magic (and hope that your roommate doesn't get into your to-go box when you're not looking)."}
{"text":"Very nice place great noodles but the pizza was ok. The pizza made me feel a little uneasy but overall decent place buttered noodles are actually like the scoops and not the long noodle but not bad."}
{"text":"Last night my family and i had Another great meal here... We love going to santos. Perfect neighborhood Italian style restaurant. We have 6 in our family but they always make us feel welcome. They have great prices too, our bill yesterday was under $30. It is small though so keep in mind during peak times you might wait, and if crowded it can feel cramped. Staff is very nice and accommodating, imo can't go wrong with any pizza!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere was very nice food was amazing the staff was pleasant I will go here again"}
{"text":"I really love their red sauce. It was a little thin but very flavorful. The service was good and the portions were a good size. The fresh warm bread is delicious! I do think the Chicken PArm price should be tad lower...but overall very satisfied and am looking forward to go back and trying their pizza!!! The waitress packed our food up for us which is always a plus..."}
{"text":"Stopped in here after hearing about the place from a friend. All of the girls working were super friendly and prompt. The owner was also there, working alongside everyone.  I ordered a supreme pizza. It was awesome. The crust was crunchy, pizza was not greasy and the sausage was awesome. The sausage is fresh ground sausage placed on the pizza, not frozen sausage chunks (yuck) like most places.  I enjoyed it, and will stop back to try the pasta next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Wouldn't feed it to my worst enemy, the service was horrible and the food was grossly like a TV dinner reject..."}
{"text":"Wow! Worst meal I have had in a very ling time. Came with good non-Yelp reviews. Totally disappointed. Started out with bread basket--with bread from a bag....and cold! Next came the calamari--love the calamari (NOT!)--first it was luke warm and the dish (not to mention the calamari itself) was covered in a thin coat of grease. Very pedestrian, highly processed calamari anyway. So we move on. Cheese pizza for my son--ok, ok this is more like it (but, really, how can you screw up a simple cheese pizza). Then out salads--big giant of overpriced bowls of glop. It was like a treasure hunt for the greens. Then the entrees--again more glop. I ordered the FEAST with shrimp, mussels, clams--well, at least there was supposed to be some seafood. I did find a shrimp or two, but no clams. Again, very heavily processed oversalted dish. My wife had the Pasta Dominic--this was actually OK if you could look past the gloppy pasta sauce. So all of this cost us over $80, when it should have cost about $35 for the quality. Either way, I am fasting today to get this crap out of my system and I'll never return. And I'll never trust a review that's not on Yelp or Roadfood.com."}
{"text":"I like Santo's!  I haven't had food that I didn't enjoy.  However, when a server spills an-almost-full-glass-of-wine on your lap and doesn't offer to refill it.  That's an issue.  I had two sips and she spilled the rest of it.  She didn't offer to refill OR remove it from the check.  I paid the bill, but it came off of her tip.    I went home with went pants and not even an apology.  Not Good!"}
{"text":"Horrible service, horrible food. Went there with my family twice. First time was bad, so I thought maybe it was an off night. Went back a few weeks later, nope, it's just bad. Bland food, almost like it was out of a box."}
{"text":"January 2012 *  Go to Santo's *   Skip the other reviews here as they are old reviews * Santo's has come a long way since opening years ago *  Everything was perfect: our three guests had 3 different meals (Ravioli, Chicken Marsla and chicken parmesan) * All three were perfectly cooked and had great flavor - not too much and not too little * We can't wait to go back for another sit down dinner * Did I mention that the place was completely full of other folks enjoying their dinners?  We will order pizza to go and will review that soon!"}
{"text":"We just had a great meal with friendly service!  We had the carbonara and it's one of the only places we've found that makes a real carbonara and not just use alfredo sauce. We also had the rigatoni with vodka sauce and it was loaded with a spicy Italian sausage and great flavor. Their bread was so delicious we actually bought a loaf to take home!"}
{"text":"My husband and I ordered a pizza and stromboli for take out,  we have never been here before and only tried because of a gift certificate that we were given, the meatball specialty pizza was wonderful but the stromboli was lacking! We were disappointed with the stromboli because it was cut into 4 pieces but only the 2 middle pieces had filling the end pieces had a small amount of cheese and no sausage or pepperoni!  Not sure if we will go back but if we do we will not order the stromboli!"}
{"text":"Santos in Middleburgh Hts is one of our favorite restaurants.   We have been to Dominic's Santos twice in the past few years.  I have an issue with the atmosphere and that is what keeps us away.  It is too brightly lighted.  Maybe they should dim the lights and put candles on the tables.  Also, it is one big room that needs to be cozier.  Booths?  Wall panels in the middle?   On our most recent visit, we found the menu pricey and the portions not worth the price. The pasta meals were good, but the salad dressings were very blah.  Poppyseed and creamy italian."}
{"text":"Decent pizza. The crust was kind of bland but the cheese and sauce are great. The large is actually more of a medium."}
{"text":"This is my second visit. I enjoyed it as much as the first. Traditional Italian food the way I like it!  We had a very good dinner the first time, just stopped for pizza today. The food was good and there was plenty of it for everyone. We all brought something home. It is good for children too, enough choices for the little ones and plenty for adults as well."}
{"text":"We just stumbled on this place after seeing it on Yelp, and we're very happy we did!  Casual, open, clean surrounding; fun, helpful service; and excellent, plentiful food at extremely affordable prices.  It's a good thing you can order half servings, because there was so much that neither of of could finish even those.  What a find! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Staff is really friendly and talkative, food is nothing special.   Salad and bread both good.   Angel hair pasta is good, I like the shape of it, it's kind of square.   Chicken Parmesan is ok. I don't like their sauce it's thick and sweet!"}
{"text":"Was so looking forward to this restaurant after the good reviews I'd heard.    The wait staff was friendly and prompt.  Most tables were full so we expected good things.  The first thing we noticed was how cold it was and how most of the patrons were wearing winter coats at their tables.  I was antsy just to get something warm to hold because my hands were ice cold.  I asked the waitress for her recommendation and she suggested Pasta Dominic with sausage, tomato, spinach.  I ordered a half portion and my husband ordered a hot sub and fries.  We immediately received bread with plates but the plates were covered in grease smudges that I could only smear with a napkin.    My salad was cold and crisp but the garlic bread appetizer was extremely greasy with congealed cheese.  My wine came in a glass with lip smudges on the rim.    When our meals came, my Pasta Dominic was ICE cold in the center and the sausage was still pink and the entire dish was topped with whole raw, cold spinach leaves that would be perfect in a salad but just wrong on a hot pasta dish.    My husband's sub had been heated but the cheese was now a congealed blob.    The waitress took the pasta to reheat and soon returned with a nice warm bowl containing now cooked sausage and wilted spinach.    Still, the sauce was unappetizing, thin and grey puddled in the bottom of the bowl.  It tasted the way it looked, and I didn't take more than 2 bites.  My husband couldn't finish his sandwich either because it was cold in the middle.  On the plus side, the wine selection was good and the Reisling I had was properly chilled, light and crisp.  I will say that the pizzas leaving the kitchen looked great and there seemed to be a steady take out business.  Maybe the pizzas are the secret and we just hit an off night.  But I don't think we'll try again hoping for an 'on' night."}
{"text":"Hubby & I came for dinner. Generous portions, & they were delicious. Service was top notch. The meal was leisurely paced which was exactly what we were looking for."}
{"text":"Average and a little pricey.  Decent portions, but certainly better Italian options in town.  Always had good service but seems to take a long time to get the meal.  Had an issue with a meal at our table and just mentioned it and the server took the meal off the check without even asking,  I will give them the 1/2 start to 3 based on doing the right thing.  Nice!  Think they do nice things for the community with donations, etc, so props there.  Just thing the portions vs. price could be better, especially on the 1/2 portions.  They are a couple bucks cheaper than the full!  Small like most Italian places, just makes groups tough."}
{"text":"Had dinner here two weekends in a row. I did carry out.  I went in to the location and the place was clean, staff was friendly. While I waited for our food I chatted it up with the staff and watched them in the kitchen. Their noodles are all home made! They make them per order. I saw a calzone being made for someone else as well as our meat ravioli. They make bread homemade and it is amazing! I saw the cooks check the temperature of the food as well as it was cooking. I ordered lasagna (get the full order), calzone for my son, and a meatball melt for my boyfriend. We also had garlic bread. My lasagna came with a side salad! It was great. I am going to try the spaghetti next time because I saw them making that and it looked so good! Especially since they make their own pasta!  Their hours aren't typical hours so call or look online before you decide on eating there. They have late hours only I believe. I don't think they have lunch hours. It's worth it!"}
{"text":"This is one of the worst dining experiences I have ever had- one of those that my boyfriend and I still look back on and laugh about. When we first entered there was no one to seat us for some time, we picked a table along the wall and quickly came to find that there were countless ants making their way up the wall, marching single file, straight to our salt and pepper shakers. Again, couldn't find a waitress, so we re-seated ourselves, and explained calmly that we had to move due to ants (which were sprayed with what appeared to be blue windex and wiped away haphazardly by a bus boy). While perusing the menu at our new table, two ants walked across it. WHAT the heck, did we bring them with us from the other table? Are they still crawling on me? Is the whole restaurant infested?  Gross. At this point, I want to leave but the boyfriend is begging starvation and we end up staying. Our salads come. Mine has a hair in it. I'm out. Grossed out. Didn't even try my chicken parm. The boyfriend had a soggy seafood pasta which a watery oily sauce. They do appear to make their own noodles though which I think deserves credit. In any case, I was right (as I usually am), we should have just left."}
{"text":"I stopped here recently on the recommendation of a close friend, and was not dissapointed.  This is an excellent, adorable 'mom and pop' family Italian restaurant with great food!  The pasta is homemade, and the service was fantastic.  My daughter got the spaghetti and meatballs, which she loved.  I got the seafood manicotti alfredo, and it was 'to die for'.  So flavorful, with large portions to boot.  Prices were good too, and at this point, I honestly don't see a reason to go to the national chain Italian restaurants anymore!  Great job Dominic Santos!"}
{"text":"Good thing we were starving otherwise we would have left. The food was very bland. No seasoning whatsoever. They must give you large portions to make up for the blah food. There were no other tables in the restaurant and the service was still mediocre. All the people working were shoving their faces with food in plain sight. Not very appetizing. Won't be returning to Dominic Santos' ever."}
{"text":"Great restaurant!! Copy and paste this link to read my full review... goo.gl/TwPjE"}
{"text":"Seriously the best Italian place I've ever been!!  The salads are so fresh, with freshly shredded mozzarella, the pasta sauce is homemade, the pasta is made from scratch and the food just tastes absolutely amazing!  I've been a handful of times since I found it a few weeks ago and I've tried the chicken parm, eggplant parm and pretty much all the apps. I highly recommend the app with fried Zuccini, eggplant, and cauliflower with the pasta sauce. Mmmmmmm!!!"}
{"text":"I am a big fan of Dominic's Santos restaurant not only for regular dining, but also for their wine dinners! Dominic and his wife, Wendy, along with their staff, put so much effort into their menu and pairings for their wine dinners. They are truly an experience- do yourself a favor and check it out sometime.  My most recent visit included a generous order of Chicken Carciofe- sautéed chicken, red pepper and artichokes over linguine with a light lemon butter sauce. It was plenty of food and so delicious. My salad (with homemade Italian and Poppyseed dressing) hit the spot and you can never go wrong with a basket of delicious, soft, warm bread.  Service is always friendly and prompt and the prices present a good value for authentic, personally prepared food. Handmade sauces and noodles, Meatballs rolled right there in the kitchen.  Dominic's menu is very similar to parent restaurant, Santo's in Middleburg Hts, but there's something a little extra special about his place. I can't quite put my finger on what it is... but it keeps me coming back."}
{"text":"We were lazy and too sick to cook so we decided to use deal dash to order some pasta from here. I ordered the angel hair spaghetti and meatballs and my boyfriend ordered the Italian sausage and peppers sub. Both were spectacular! There pasta there is homemade and you can definitely tell by the texture of the noodles. The sauce clung to the pasta beautifully and the sauce was also an simple thick sauce with great flavor. The meatballs were my favorite of the dish. No fillers just straight homemade meatballs with lots of love. My boyfriend enjoyed his sub and it was so full of goodness it was bursting at the seams. We also ordered some garlic bread and they gave us so much its taken 3 days for us to eat it all. Definitely check this place out next time your craving some Italian."}
{"text":"Very delicious pizza! And the hot stuffed peppers were delicious and full of flavor! The service has always been friendly and fast!"}
{"text":"I generally wait a few days before posting a review so I can really think before posting, but my experience tonight was so horrible that I could not risk someone else being subjected to such abrupt service, rude owners, and bad food.  Let me be very clear here, I have posted unfavorable reviews based on food for other restaurants, but have always been willing to go back because everyone has an off night. I will never patronize this place again simply because the owners were so appallingly flippant.  Went here tonight with a friend while in the area and we both ordered the cavatelli. It said it was handmade and all dinners come with bread and salad. Salads and bread started off good, but then the pasta came. I kid you not, it was gray and translucent, not to mention so gummy that it stuck together in big clumps. We both sent it back and only a few minutes later were presented with basically the same exact bowls of pasta.   Knowing the cavatelli wasn't going to get better, we ordered the angel hair and spaghetti. They came out a little too quick. The angel hair was more like a thin spaghetti and not a true angel hair, and was so underdone it was crunchy. The spaghetti was mushy. We sent both dishes back again and said we would just pay for the side salads we ate. The waitress said she would talk to the owners.  We see her go over to the husband and wife owners, they both look over at our table and disappear. A few minutes later we are given a $10 check for the two salads and never once were visited by the owners. We take the check to the register on purpose so we can tell the wife of our experience, and told her very matter of factly that it was disappointing and why. She said, 'Oh really?' And then went on to give excuses like, 'the angel hair is fresh cut so it takes a little longer to cook.' Wrong. Fresh cut pasta takes less time, and there's a difference between al dente and raw. She never once apologized, had a chip on her shoulder during the whole conversation and took the basic attitude of 'oh well, we have good food and you're wrong.'  The wait staff are all high school girls that are very abrupt and not attentive at all, the cooks look to be about high school or early college, and when we asked if the regular chef was working our waitress informed us that the entire kitchen staff was new, as are the rest of the workers there. That's a red flag.  Santos, I'm going to give you a bit of free advice- if your 'cavatelli' is translucent and gray, you're using too much water in your dough. Angel hair should be thinner, and if you break a piece of pasta in half it should not be white in the middle. Or translucent. Or gray."}
