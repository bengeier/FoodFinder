{"text":"Went to the place first time. It was around 3pm. Place was not busy which is good for me no line ups. Order there cold grass jelly bowl, salt and pepper chicken and ginger milk tea. The grass jelly and tea was good but nothing special about chicken. In all a good place for Taiwanese desserts and catch up with friends."}
{"text":"Lunch today - Salt and Pepper Chicken with Rice ($10.99) and Taiwanese Stir Fried Rice Noodles ($7.99). No combo during weekends. Flavour of the chicken was good, noodle was so-so and portion was small. $10.99 with no drink is quite expensive for a lunch. They should consider offering combos during weekends like Cha Me Cha."}
{"text":"This is my favourite place to study! I've been here so many times and the staff are always so nice. I love how this place compared to the Warden/Steeles location has booth seats. It feels much more private when i'm trying to study which I like. Every single time I come, it's barely packed and I always get to sit in the booth seats, even if i'm just one person. Staff allow you to sit wherever you like, and I always stay for hours. This place does get packed at times, but I guess mostly just during exam times when everyone wants to get some studying done.   As for the food, you can't expect much.. it's meh. My favourite thing to get is their Salt & Pepper Chicken which is also everyones favourite. It's the best thing to snack on, other than their free popcorn. I always get their Hokkaido milk tea with half sugar or their Mixed Fruit Tea. If you're feeling a hot drink, the mixed fruit tea is so good. It tastes like passion fruit tea, and they add fruit into the pot as well. For their tapioca, they have \"mixed\" tapioca which is large and small tapioca size. I always ask for large just because it's almost impossible for me to chew the small tapioca..  Also, i've been to Green Grotto so many times, and never ever EVERR knew they had a stamp card. Only after coming here for a week straight recently.. one of their staff asked why I haven't used their stamp cards.. and handed me one. ?.. They also have an app for points, only to-go drinks."}
{"text":"There are plenty of bubble tea places, but what I sorely miss is a great sit and hangout spot, which is what most of the new bubble tea cafes lack.  Thanks, Green Grotto, for bringing that back.    This location is very spacious with relaxed lighting and seating.  There are rustic decor on the walls and a large table in the centre for groups.  I love this because most places have such small tables that it's hard for groups to meet up.  This setup is entirely deserving of one extra star in my books.  Quality wise, they are what you'd expect from an average bubble tea place.  Nothing fancy and tapioca is nothing impressive.  They do have some hot food options which is great for a long day there.  Service is not really needed as you'd probably want to be left alone while working anyway.  My favourite at Green Grotto remains the Mango Trio drink - with mango pieces and boba, this drink can last me a whole afternoon."}
{"text":"Definitely a hidden gem. I prefer this Green Grotto to all the other ones because it's never crowded. The shop is spacious and peaceful. Their drinks are pretty regular though. I don't find that their food or drinks are particularly good. They're average, but I find myself coming here so often because of the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Was there for some dessert. After about 10 minutes they brought us some \"free\" popcorn. We tried it and it was terrible. I can see why it was \"free\". Not even fresh, cold and stale.   The desserts we ordered were fine and no other problems.  After posting an honest 3-star review on facebook I received a message giving me backlash. Apparently they don't like their customers telling the truth."}
{"text":"I would very often come here to grab a bite to eat and study late night. The service was always quite good and the cafe was always warm, cozy and inviting.   I noticed recently that all the workers have changed (assuming new management took over) and the cafe overall has changed as a result. The cafe is less welcoming and it is freezing cold. The staff is not as friendly and provides very minimal service. The food and drink quality is also not the same. Not sure if i would come back after new management has taken over."}
{"text":"I loved coming here prior to the new management. The staff were extremely welcoming, which made the experience great. I used to come here several times a month and they knew me by face. I agree with the other reviews that the ambience is more negative and not as welcoming. Upon 15 minutes of waiting both times, I had to ask to get a menu and to order. My friend asked if they had coke and he said \"This isn't a Starbucks\". They have a lot of work to do if they want to keep the same customers who were loyal before"}
{"text":"seems like they recently changed owners, both the drinks and service are terrible now. They purposely do not clean up the booths and make it seem like they are occupied, and make people sit in the long tables in the middle. Once the long table is filled, they gave the booths to people that came alone. When I asked them why they didnt give us the booth when we had 2 people, the server lied that we have to have a part of at least 3 to sit in the booths. It also took them forever to give us pop corn and take our order when the place is not even that busy. The poor guy sitting beside me didn't even get a menu after half an hour.The menu they gave us is all broken and with recipes and notes written on it. The drinks are not well mixed. I feel like the owner and the staff are a bunch of amateurs. Will not be returning to this location even if you pay me."}
{"text":"I live 5min from here and pass by it many times but never came here to eat. I finally decided to try it and the place looks well put together.   Why my 1 star?   Well the food is less then average and tastes horrible. I usually got to the grotto at warden and steeles and at least their food doesnt look half ass.    I ordered the Taiwanese mushroom minced beef on rice $9.99 and my plate literally looked like they gave 1 sprinkle of minced beef and no mushroom but all rice and an egg. I even have a video to show that there was literally ZERO meat in the plate they gave me. It was just horrible. And to add to this horriblness, it was so salty I wanted to puke. Tasted like somebody accidentally spilled the salt into it and had no idea. I asked my husband to taste it and immediately he spit it out. (Please see the disappointing photos and videos). Do not eat here they microwave the food and serve it to you. Plus the rice was hard and cold as if it was many days old. Where is the quality control in this place? The manager needs to do somthing about this.   My husband ordered the 3 cup chicken $15.99 ...another rip off dish for what you get. It had literally 3 pieces of diced chicken (not cups). For $15.99 take your money elsewhere. Maybe go to Ding Tai Fong just a few blocks down. You get a better meal and will be happier.   The place is runned by kids. Which speaks for the lack of service. They were always in the back talking or outside smoking. There was 1 female girl working the whole place and waiting the tables. You call this a restaurant? Ummm ... please do something about your bad tasting microwave cold food and the service you provide your customers. Customers are the ones that keep the business running.   If I can put 0 star I would just because the quality of service and food were so bad. I'll stick to the grotto location at Warden/Steels or the one up north on Leslie/MajorMac.   I should have read other people's review before I came here. Had no idea that this location had changed management. The management needs to just close this up because they already ran it to the ground.   Do not eat here unless you want to eat days-old food that they just microwave for you.  Better to stay home and eat your moms cooking."}
{"text":"Evening out with some friends, very comfortable seatings and amazing service. Very soft and welcoming decor at Green Grotto tea restaurant.  I loved their yogurt twist with boba, not too sweet at all. It tastes amazing for a hot summer day.  Free popcorns is always a treat !!"}
{"text":"Compared to the other grottos in Markham/ York Region area, this location is more spacious and brighter. There's usually not too many people and tables are wide enough so good place to study.   Drinks wise it's pretty standard. Nothing too out of the ordinary, but there are a few items on the menu that's never available (like the white chocolate drinks) so I'm not sure why it's still on their menu, maybe other locations have it. Food also ok. Not bad but nothing special. Tapioca consistency is normally good with some chewiness but not hard or too soft.   Washrooms are clean. Service is decent. Good selection of magazines. Nice decor.   Overall great place to just have some time to chill or study."}
{"text":"Came here again today. What a mistake. Was seated and had to prompt the waitress to get us menus. I then discovered that they completely changed the menus - there's now separate menus for drinks and food. They're a mess to be frank -very difficult to read. Even worse, they jacked up all of the prices! The salt and pepper chicken rice - formally ~ $11 is now $14. Not only are they more expensive, the portion size was abysmal. They took a shrink ray and the food portions are now 50% of what they were previously (refer to pic below). To make matters worse, they ran out of tapioca at 5pm on a Saturday. And to top it all off, the bathroom was dirty and there was no soap whatsoever. This has public health violation written all over it.  In sum, this grotto has plummeted in every way possible. Poor service, confusing menu, more expensive, smaller portions, decreased sanitation."}
{"text":"This is in my opinion, one of the better locations for Green Grotto! I appreciated the open-concept design with a long table in the middle of the store and space on the sides for booth areas. The design made the shop look    Although the plaza appears quite old, there's always spaces for parking when you come to bubble tea at night, and the store isn't packed, so there's always space when you come in, unlike the other Green Grottos! They gave us a bucket of pop-corn right when we sat down, and service was easy and fast because the shop wasn't always full. They made the drinks right away when we ordered it. Fast service and a comfortable environment is always something I really appreciate in restaurants.  I tried their condensed milk tea ($5.99), large, 20oz. I loved how they added the Tohato caramel puffs on top - it's actually a snack I really enjoy eating. I thought that incorporating it with the drink really made me reminisce about the times I was a kid when I hated drinking milk, but I always added sweet chips like Tohato to it to endure drinking it."}
{"text":"have come here on multiple occasions great place to sit down with friends and talk or for a study sesh. they have chargers and also a quiet environment. the store is very aesthetic and they give you popcorn when you sit  my favourite drinks are the Hokkaido milk tea and white peach slush. they are a little more expensive then normal, similar price to tenren. they have some unique flavours and drinks that I haven't seen anywhere else  they also have a lunch special that is pretty good since it includes a drink the food here is decent like the dry noodles and the popcorn chicken but not amazing. I would only get food if you come for lunch special as it is expensive too  the service is quick here because usually it isn't too full at anytime of the day  I would definitely come again !!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed in their service and quality. Haven't been here in a while, so came here for a quick girls night bbt session. Boy...were we shocked at the changes (Possibly new owners).  Menu has changed significantly! Ordered various teas (2 being hot..and 1 of them came cold). Food was very disappointing. The salt and pepper chicken was soggy and very salty.... Seemed liked it was microwaved.  ... and no more popcorn...and they ran out of tapioca balls..! what bbt place runs out of tapioca balls?!  Not impressed..and definitely won't be returning."}
{"text":"Our party of 3 came here for a quick snack on a weekend and to be honest, we were quite surprised at the number of people here just studying. It's more a study cafe than somewhere you go just for a meal/snack. There seemed to be a number of outlets (especially at the centre communal table) and the general environment was brightly lit. The tables and booths off the the sides of the store weren't that studying-friendly in terms of outlets. For food choices, there is a lack of dessert / sweets to choose from, so you're better off sticking to their drinks and hot foods."}
{"text":"I have been a fan of green grotto so I wanted to check this new location. I love this new location much more, it is very clean and service is great. The servers are actually friendly here. They have some booths that are great for getting some work done. Overall, I love this new location and I will return."}
{"text":"Pretty good atmosphere here and the staff were friendly. it's a nice place to enjoy a drink and catch up with friends or lover. Also seems like a good place to study as well.  As for the food and drinks: Im not sure how good the drinks are as I only had the sausage and minced meat on rice with egg - it wasn't very good. It was a bit dry and quite blend. My friend had the hot grass jellie (I forgot it's actual name) and it was certainly interesting. Taste wise,  its sweet grass jellie mixed with salty peanuts and texture wise, it's a little gooey to start then when it cools down, it becomes more congealed and chewy.   I'll probably come back here to try the drinks but not the food."}
{"text":"This place used to be my favourite get together spot with friends. It was always interesting to try out new drinks on the menu. But recently after a change in management (what I suspect) the quality of foods, drinks and customer service has gone downhill. It is no longer the welcoming Green Grotto that we once knew, the staff here are unwelcoming and rude. My friends stayed here to get some work done on a Thursday afternoon - we had ordered drinks each and a plate of noodles (which according to my friend were horrible), and after a couple of hours we were rushed out with the bill placed on the table. I understand if it was busy then they would want to get people in and out as soon as possible. But there were only 3 tables in total there this afternoon. Not very welcoming for a lounge and drinks place. Before I used to spend many afternoons and evenings getting work done and had stayed for many hours and the staff would refill the popcorn or if I got a hot tea they would refill with water. The drinks also taste horrible now. My fave used to be kumqut lemon green tea but last time I had it, it just tasted like lemonade out of a carton. 100% would not recommend this place, just save your money and take your business elsewhere. Miss the old servers and bartenders !"}
{"text":"I was never a fan of Green Grotto because of their artificially tasting drinks and their sub-par bubbles and jelly and this was pretty on par with that.   I ordered the Special OOOOOlong milk tea with grass jelly, regular size for $6 tax-in.  The drink was too sweet and didn't have much oolong tea flavour.   The grass jelly felt like it had too much gelatin in the mix which meant it was too firm and not smooth like how I like it.  The staff was very polite and courteous."}
{"text":"I'm so happy that they open this location in East Markham.  Green Grotto has the best bubble tea in town, just like the taste you can find in Taiwan.  They have the top 10 drinks in menu, just pick any thing on that list.  My latest favourite is Oero Milk Tea, not too sweet, and I can still taste the tea favour, love it!"}
{"text":"Decent place to sit and hang out with friends. They don't play music like other bubble tea places which made it a lot easier to converse with others, or focus if you want to do some work. It does get a bit loud sometimes when they're using the blender to blend up drinks but no biggie. They have a sign at the door that says they limit you to 3hrs, but that's a sufficient amount of time to loiter around (which we did).   The menus were in really poor condition, I think they should be laminated. They were just really worn out.  There was a large selection of drinks, all reasonable priced. The red bean milk tea ($5.49) which was ordered cold, was good and had a good amount of red bean.   They gave us popcorn right as we sat down (hooray for free popcorn. I may have eaten the entire container by myself. whoops.). I ordered their salt and pepper chicken ($6.99). It wasn't that crispy but it was flavoured well. I also tried their peanut butter toast ($4.49). The bread wasn't the best. It was nothing special, I wouldn't recommend."}
{"text":"The aesthetic of this place is so cute & there is plenty of space to have study dates anywhere up to 10 people. I usually come here for dessert although they have small meals, appetizers and snacks! The food itself is reasonably priced, usually under $10 but it's not too filling.   As for what I order I usually get bubble tea. My go to, no matter how basic, would be the fresh fruit mango slush. The best one I've had at any bubble tea spot. It tastes very fresh & not artificial at all. Their tapioca is also one of my favourites. I would say all of their slush or smoothie like drinks are really good. ALSO, note that if you take out you get 15% off! Another good drink would be the strawberry yogurt smoothie! If you aren't a fan of sweet bubble tea, they also have a large variety of different tea drinks, both hot and cold.  They also have desserts such as cheesecake, mousse, layered cake, tawainese dessert bowls & different dessert toasts. I've had the condensed milk toast and it was so fluffy and had the perfect amount of sweetness. The cheesecake is also promising, but can easily find the same quality at grocery stores. As for the tawainese desserts, I tried a mixed bowl with mango/taro balls, tapioca, grass jelly and red bean and they were generous with the amounts of each topping they included.  I recommend sharing.   Only issue with this place is it's very busy on the weekends & the prices are way too high compared to its competitors.   PS: unlimited free popcorn! Also, everyone has to purchase something."}
{"text":"I really loved the green grotto until this one horrible experience..... I ordered 2 fomoso bowls.... one ice cold with coca cola and grass jelly the other one a hot fomoso bowl with ginger and grass jelly... the guy who made my bowls didn't put any grass jelly in either of them and when I opened them... all there was was just a bowl of hot liquid.... no grass jelly, no tapioca, no yellow jelly... just a bowl of black hot liquid. And the ice cold fomoso bowl.... just ice with coca cola in the bowl. My order was completely messed up. I was so upset that I went back and complained. They gave me a refund and a free drink. At least the drink was decent. I was very disappointed since those fomoso bowls cost $18 altogether..... for What?? Bowls of hot and cold liquid? Not worth it. I'll be going to a different bubble tea place.   I would give this place below 1 star but unfortunately on yelp I cannot go any lower than that."}
{"text":"Been a fan of the tea and the atmosphere of Green Grotto for a long while. it was really quiet on a wednesday night. Service was also very slow since there was only 2 people working. This location is smaller then the other ones and located in a bad spot. don't think many people are aware of this location. The store is also really humid and dry for some reason so i was kind of feeling uncomfortable. I don't really like the dessert here, usually just order from their fresh green tea menu or popcorn chicken if I'm craving."}
{"text":"Mince meat on rice with tea egg was pretty good but other dishes not so good and drinks were average  Curry sirloin should at least have some curry taste but it was more like beef stew and taiwanese fried rice was ok taste but was made with something oddly close to pasta  I also ordered a ginger milk tea which i hoped would ease a cold winter night... the milk tea was sweetened which was fine but the ginger (unless you REALLY love ginger) feels like a punch to taste buds upon first sip and continues consistently till the last drop.  Overall staff were friendly and service was good and food was hot from start to finish which makes me want to come back again to try other dishes and drinks"}
{"text":"I've been here twice and thought my first visit was OK.   Second visit I have to say was super disappointing. They ran out of tapioca... this is bubble tea establishment. How is this even possible? The location was dead at the time I visited as well.    Update (June 18): Figured I'd try again and again they are completely out of tapioca! Absolutely ridiculous lol. This was at 4pm on a Sunday afternoon."}
{"text":"A solid 4. This place can be difficult to find due to poor signage along Highway 7 and Google map often redirects you to the Warden & hwy 7 store. The drink is slightly too sweet but filled to the top. However their popcorn machine is broken so no snacks for customers"}
{"text":"Average. There's really nothing exciting about green grotto at this location. It's a common tea house in Markham that has decent popcorn chicken and bubble tea.   I would order the chicken and bubble tea again but probably skip out on lunch. We had lunch here the other day and sitting near the kitchen was probably not favourable for this review. This is because they simply microwaved our food. Watching them put our food into the microwave and hearing the alerting ring near the end was just...disappointing.   And yes, the food tasted like it was reheated...go figure. Anyway, my advice is to go to Quiznos next door, order a sub, then pick up a bubble tea here, and head home."}
{"text":"Hidden gem in Markham! Love this place! Drinks are great and food is ok. The decor is modern and rustic with bike handing from walls. The menu is a bit extensive from hot to cold drinks, apps, entrees and desserts (which are not made in house) but the green tea crepe pie is very nice!"}
{"text":"Food - 2/10  Drink -  2/10  Service - 7/10  Environment- 7/10  Overall: 1.4/5 stars  I'm sorry the food is not on the good side. Bubble tea was not good. Service was good. Free popcorn though!"}
{"text":"I got the braised pork on rice, chicken pancake, black sesame steamed milk, matcha red bean creep cake, and chocolate and hazelnut cake... I know it sounds a lot, don't worry, I didn't eat it all to myself ... hehe I really did like the desert, very moist. My favourite was probably the matcha creep cake. The pancake was soooo hard to cut, the taste of it was ok, very chewy. The rice was a bit dry... a bit more sauce would be nice"}
{"text":"The newest Green Grotto in the area.   Love the large communal table in the middle and every seat has access to electrical outlets.  On a weekday late afternoon, this place is quiet aside from other 2 tables.   Due to the closest of seating arrangements and the smaller space, you can hear all the conversation from other tables.   Drinks quality is comparable to other locations. Food is meh as usual. I would not recommend.   Reward App is for takeout only....."}
{"text":"I noticed that there is new management at this location. With that being said, I am not happy with their demeanour - it's very negative. Prior management was more welcoming and made great drinks. Green Grotto definitely is known for their great bubble tea, however I'm not happy with their new staff who challenge my orders that I have been ordering prior to and since this location has opened.  I love the Green Grotto Tea Room, but new management staffing needs to be more mindful when it comes to customer service."}
{"text":"The food here r horrible, a normal takoyaki would be a shape of a ball, instead of this, they cut the takoyaki in half and serve it, so basically $8.99, u only get 4 takoyaki, the rice here r so bad as well, basically u get no air conditioner here. I will never come here again"}
{"text":"My first time at this location, and honestly I'm completely impressed with this location.  On a Saturday afternoon (1:30PM) it seems a little empty, but I can see that the place is really clean, there's an abundance of seating for 30 people. Compared to the other two Green Grotto locations, I see this as a plus point already. Decorations are a little more simple, but this means more seating room, which is fine by me. I'm here for a take out drink, and I was able to order promptly. As my drink was being made I saw that they worked quickly. My drink has a cream topping, and I saw that they put the cream on my drink, lifted the cup up and I saw the topping then proceed to start sinking into my drink. My initial thought was \"are they really going to give that to me?\" The female server then comes to tell me that the topping was having problems, and they were going to make a new batch. She asked whether I was going to a) want another drink? b) if not, then mind waiting and whether I wanted some popcorn. This kind of customer service definitely had me impressed. And honestly the wait for probably about 5 minutes. They cared about the quality of food they were going to put out, and also considerate of customers. Thumbs up and please don't change."}
{"text":"One of my favourite Green Grotto locations to study at, compared the smaller one on Highway 7 and Town Centre blvd and the busier one at Steeles and Warden that I frequent often.   Their staff in attentive and there are a lot of plugs here, perfect for groups to study at. The location is open concept which is quite nice, but also on the smaller side. Usually it's pretty quite but recently it's gotten busier, especially on weekends, making me want to come less for serious study sessions.   Plus side: there's always parking in this plaza!!  Other than that, the only other downside is that their menu is less extensive than the Steeles and Warden location. So they don't have noodles or other large meal selections. They only serve small snacks, rice sets, rice bowls and desserts here."}
