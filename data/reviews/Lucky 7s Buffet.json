{"text":"hahahaah.....$7.77 all day. Where can you find else in the States? They served Chinese food, Italian food, American Food, etc. There's nothing special but with that price, what can you blame about?!  *p.s. the bread pudding there is so good.....lol"}
{"text":"Jajajaja te preguntaras porque le doy 4 estrellas a uno de los casinos mas antiguos en el que las moquetas huelen a rancio aun en parte del hotel.casino y el buffet en cuestion luce algo cutre... Pues he comido ahi (por suerte o no ) la carne mejor cocinada de los buffets de casinos de este nivel (medio) , la atencion es espectacular y hombre... El plaza es el plaza , la antologia de Las Vegas no se entiende sin este mitico hotel que a tanto capo de la mafia y gente de la farandula norteamericana ha dado cobijo...  tienes que ir, aunque sea para llamarme exageraooooo..."}
{"text":"OK, seriously, I hate hate hate all things buffet. just the THOUGHT of a buffet makes me gag a little, but when in Vegas, what the fuck else am I going to eat?  My hubby and I headed downtown and were STARVING so before dropping loads of cash gambling, we popped into Lucky 7s, where they boast a full buffet for $7.77.  Having paid $25 for Imperial Palace's buffet the day before, this was BEYOND a steal and while I expected it to be A LOT worse, it was actually better!!  Smaller...yes! Simple, definitely!  But, the choices were good, home cooked, mashed potatoes (from a box ...whatev) and fried chicken and much much more - I was in awe from all the food.  I could have had seconds, but that is just disgusting.  I had exactly my $7.77 worth and our server always kept our drinks full. Score an extra star for that!  It was well worth the price and better than any other buffet we had on our four day jaunt across Vegas.  I would definitely go back on our next trip.  You can't go wrong for that price if you are going to do buffet...why the hell pay more for overexposed food on display?"}
{"text":"As far as breakfast buffets this one will cost you $7.77. I would just say it's ok.. It's not great, just enough to get you by kinda food. Your typical fare of scambled and hard boiled eggs, bacon, sausages, biscuits, etc. It's a small buffet area compared to the others I've been to. There are better ones for even better prices so do compare."}
{"text":"One star for the hotel but three stars for the buffet...  I went back for seconds of the corned beef hash and biscuits and gravy.  Nothing fancy here, just a good down-home basic breakfast.  Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"BOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  just found out that they took out Lucky 7s and replaced it with some BS. it's $11.80 now. F*** THAT!"}
