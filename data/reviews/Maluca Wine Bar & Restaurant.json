{"text":"Finally, a classy upscale feeling back in downtown Oakville. Been here a few times only for drinks, have yet to experience the food. The bar and bar area is cleverly designed in the front of the restaurant. You get a Manhattan feel when the downtown is busy and you are up on one of their cleverly designed front raised tables. Inviting place, great staff. As the ownership of this place are the same team that own Corks and Seasons downtown Oakville, I'm taking a guess that the food will be just as good as the design and decor. Great job."}
{"text":"I was surprised to see so many negative reviews.  I liked this place!  It had a super cool ambiance, and our service was excellent.  It was pretty quiet given it was a Saturday night, but that really didn't bother us! We had the grilled calamari - yum!  And we also had the bison meatballs -- also yum!  The portions were large enough for two, for a smaller dinner.  Loved my sauv blanc glass of vino, but was surprised at how limited their white wine selection was, especially as they call themselves a wine bar!  There were only 6 white wine options in total (by the glass).  That doesn't really scream wine bar to me?!  But, nonetheless, I'd def go here again!!"}
{"text":"My GF and I went there on a Friday Nov 8, 2013. We had made a reservation and were seated immediately. That was a good start.  It took 10 minutes for a waitress to come around for a drink order. So, the service was slow in the beginning for drinks. Later, the waitstaff came over every few minutes to find out how the food was, almost being annoying.  I ordered a salad and my GF ordered soup.  We ordered a main dish of Arctic char to share.   After 25 minutes, all the food came out together! The soup was cold and had to be sent back for reheating. The salad with beets was excellent. The main dish of Arctic char was removed and brought back after we were done with the salad and soup. It appeared to have been simply reheated as the scoop of green seasoning on the top had been melted when the dish was returned. It was overdone and tasteless.  Overall, this was a very disappointing dining experience especially given the elegant dining at Seasons, which owns Maluca. It is very unlikely that we will return given the large number of similar restaurants in the Oakville, Burlington, Port Credit area."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, attentive staff, and food was good!  Good mussels and bison meatballs! Will have to go again to try different tapas.  Kids also enjoyed the flatbread and French fries."}
{"text":"The place looks great and we were told that it gets really busy, but we were there on a very silent Sunday evening so the waitress was really attentive.  Wine was good, the flat breads specially the veggie was really good. They changed their wine menu but they did not print the new menu so it was very confusing. Everything we point out they said they have a equivalent. The stool chairs were really really uncomfortable."}
{"text":"I was there on a Saturday night for an appetizer before dinner.  The bartender was professional. He suggested a great red wine pairing with the basin meatball we ordered.  I particular like how they have a choice of 3, 6 and 9 oz to choose which is perfect for my friend who just want a sip.   The balls were great.  The choice of meat is prefect and the size is just right.  Service was warm and professional.  It's a great restaurant for girls night out or couple dinner.  The decor were modern and hip.... Downtown hip bar with large selection of wine and drink in Oakville."}
