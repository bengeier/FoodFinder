{"text":"I'd give this place an extra half star if I could, just because it used to be a Wendy's.  I think this is probably as close to \"authentic\" as you're going to find.  They have all the usual suspects of a Mexican joint: tacos, quesadillas, and of course the salsa bar (I think this was a remnant of when Wendy's had salad bars, remember that?  circa early 1990s).  The service is good, and the food is delicious.  I would suggest a giant (and they are giant) chicken quesadilla, with a bunch of guacamole on the side.  The cheese is melty and delicous!  I would avoid the steak as it is quite tough, but to be fair I've never had good steak from a good mexican restaurant.  And they have Mexican Coke in glass bottles, which usually always makes me go back for more."}
{"text":"Married to a pure blooded Sonoran master chef so I rarely go out for Mexican food. However, I was craving a morning fix of some authentic Mexican and Asadero absolutely blew my fricken mind..  A lot of Mexican places in AZ claim to have carne asada but it tastes downright nasty. Asadero absolutely made me foodgasm over their carne asada and cabeza burritos. Highly recommended if you ever venture out to the downtown area and you need a quick, authentic fix."}
{"text":"This little gem surprised me. The quality of their carne asada was fantastic. For the reasonable prices I expected grisly, fatty meat, but that was not at all our experience. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Carne Asada... Good! Tortillas... Good! Hortchata... Good! I love their tacos de tripas, the tripas are nice and crunchy."}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican food in Arizona so far. I have been eating here for a long time now, and every time I go I want to try something new but can't seem to stay away from their tacos. I recommend their carne asada, caramello, and jaz tacos. I get them every time and am never disappointed. This is a real Mexican food joint- don't expect to receive excellent customer service, especially if you want to customize your order. The workers are always friendly, but some of them don't speak English fluently and will get confused if a customer gets picky. Also, the tacos don't come with cilantro and onions so you have to ask for it on the side if you want it. No big deal- they will give you a huge plate of both cilantro/onions if you ask! Also, the beans are amazing. They put some kind of spicy sauce in them.  Actually, this might be my favorite place to eat period. This is the place I will be craving and thinking about if I ever leave Arizona. SO GOOD!"}
{"text":"This is as close as you can get to Authentic Mexican Sonora food. The owner is from Hermosillo, Sonora, Mexico (my father is also from there) and this place definitely compares to the taco stands in Hermosillo.   It is clean and nice inside. They have an awesome condiment bar. There's variety of salsa's and pico de Gallo. They also have grilled jalapeños (upon request on some orders and others it comes with it). The carne asada is delicious and the best. Although, the barbacoa is not far behind. The rice and beans are very good. The flour tortillas are better than the corn tortillas.   The staff is very nice and helpful. The service is fast and reasonably priced. During lunch hours they have daily specials for only $5.95 (includes a beverage, rice & beans) and changes daily. It's definitely worth going!!!"}
{"text":"Great food, clean restaurant, friendly service - this place is a hidden gem close to downtown!"}
{"text":"A weekly staple for the bf and I... He loves the carne asada and I always do the chicken plate. Absolutely wonderful, the staff is always consistent and so nice... Ps the green avocado sauce is to die for, I could bathe in it.. Like everyone else says, don't be scared by the outside appearance."}
{"text":"Food is great but this place needs to train or do a much better job in regards of customer service oriented - they have the nastiest cashier specially during night times when I am able to order Drive thru experience. This lady always missing items that it should be attached to orders or just using a bad tone when it comes to complaints or suggestions for \"next time\". I brought the issue to Omar (the owner) but it seem that nothing happened at all. So I found another restaurant with same or better food quality and great customer service that I can take my business to. Good luck to this place with that cashier :-("}
{"text":"Worst customer service!!!! Lady at the register was extremely rude and did not apologize for messing up my order, looks as if she hates her job with a passion. I will never come here again!!!"}
{"text":"The barbacoa is great and the tacos de carne are excellent. My business is not far from there and we get lunch there quite a bit. The beans are always phenomenal. It's the kind of place you'd drive not thinking of stopping in, but it's worth it."}
{"text":"This was really good -- delicious homemade flour tortillas and very good value. This was my first time to a Phoenix taco joint so I am not familiar with the local style. If you order a burrito, it will just be the tortilla and whatever meat you choose, unless you pay for add-ons. Then you take your burrito (or whatever) to the little bar area in the dining room and you can add all your toppings -- shredded cabbage, pickled onion, cucumber, radish, salsas -- very cool. You get a huge amount of meat in your burrito. My main complaint is that I had heartburn for like 5 days straight after eating here -- maybe it was just too much for me!"}
{"text":"I agree with Nadia's review.  The food is excellent.  We had the carne asada for two and there was plenty of food.  Very fresh  and tasty.  The people who work here are friendly as well."}
{"text":"How do I begin?  I'm in love with Asadero Toro and I don't care who knows it!  I am so freaking lucky to live in the neighborhood across the street from here, but it's super dangerous because I end up with a steady street taco diet.  I have eaten here probably one million times, and I've never been disappointed.  EVERY TIME you order tacos they load them up with meat (always get chicken or carne asada with flour tortillas), AND give you a whole container of pico, cabbage, cucumbers, and 2 other types of salsa for free (when you order through the drive thru).  If you go in they have a big salsa bar that you can take what you wish from.  It's inexpensive, quick, soooo good, and they're open pretty much all of the time.  I hope Asadero Toro is here to stay, because there's no better place to get street tacos."}
{"text":"Was working in this area of town and was starving. Thank god for the yelp app. Reviews were right on the money. I got 2 carne asada tacos on flour tortillas. This place is legit!!!  Was truly surprised once I entered the business. It was clean and the staff was friendly. If I'm ever back in the area I will return. Thanks yelp nation for steering me the right direction."}
{"text":"Good food and good price! The food here is Mexican for real, no doubt about it. Also the drinks are great, I you are going for the first time the asada molcajete and horchata are highly recommended, the flour tortillas are hand made at that moment so be sure to ask for some of them."}
{"text":"The carne asada is sooperdooper! The beans are unlike any that I have had anywhere. They were mixed with red chile and were very spicy and almost watery, but I thought they were very good. The restaurant was very simple and clean and the staff was very friendly and helpful. I will definitely return soon."}
{"text":"Asadero Toro is a wonderful Mexican food restaurant in Phoenix! The Carne Asada is incredible and the homemade tortillas delicious. A wonderful and quick staff always brighten my day when I visit."}
{"text":"I only had a burrito, but I loved everything about it. The tortilla was awesome, I think they make it in house. The chicken was grilled, clean, not greasy. The burrito came plain, you can add pico/sauce from salsa bar.  Note: they do not have fountain drinks, only cans / Mexican coke"}
{"text":"Just going through the drive thru the lady was like what do you want? I told her if I can take a moment. When ready to order I said I was ready... But no reply after a couple of seconds I heard people in the microphones background. So I went said Hello she was like what do you want so I asked if there was Pico De Gallo in the asada Burrito. The lady replied its a asada Burrito come with only that. If you want something you need to say it. I thought the person was rude so I decided to take my service elsewhere. Made my first time experience there horrible will never return."}
{"text":"We have lived in Encanto Park for several years however never stopped in this place.  As previously mentioned - the place looks a little scary from the outside!  We saw the Yelp reviews and thought what the heck?  The menu has a wide variety of dishes.  We had the chicken taco, the barbacoa and carne asada burritos.  Everything was seasoned well.  The barbacoa is cooked in some type of red chili sauce.  The carne asada was a bit fatty however flavorful.  The small flour tortillas come out hot off the stove.  They are great!   We also discovered they carry bottled Coke and other sodas from Mexico.    I loved the condiment bar with the various salsas and toppings which included limes, cucumbers, radishes, and cabbage.  The pico de gallo and guacamole sauce were my favorites.  Unlike America's Taco where you are given a tiny bit of everything on the side, this place is a free for all!  The interior was immaculate!  The decor is not great.  Plastic chairs and tables.  The front counter gal could not answer any of my questions.  The server though was extremely nice - especially considering our two year old dumped a plate of rice on the floor!    This place reminds me of Wishell's donuts down the street.  The exterior is terrible but inside they have the most heavenly donuts and croissants!  The place sells out by 8 am!  You would never know by looking at it from the outside.  Lesson learned - don't judge a book by it's cover."}
{"text":"!delicious¡ one of  the better Mexican fast food joints around. The food is tasty ( beans are a little watery for my taste but I know people like him like that)  however I've tried most things on the menu and everything is very good."}
{"text":"Asadero Toro may not be much to look at (outside or in), but they serve high quality Mexican food. The menu may look a bit daunting to a gringo, but the employees have always been very nice and helpful when I had a question. The setup is casual with a small salsa bar that contains sliced cucumbers, shredded lettuce, lime halves and pickled onion slices. For liquid refreshment, you can get a cold bottle of super sweet Mexican Coke or even Mexican 7-Up (that's something you don't see every day).  Condiments and drinks aside, the main reason to come here is -- the meat! Tacos are nice, but I usually pick one of their huge burritos with lots of savory beef stuffed in a huge, fresh tortilla. The carne asada is wonderful, as is the birria de chivo (a goat stew). Their meat tastes as if it's been stewing in juices all day, making me wonder if they leave it bubbling in a huge vat overnight.   One thing I like about Asodero Toro is that they have items that use the, ahem, offbeat parts of the cow. Recently I tried the beef tongue burrito, which was great. Perhaps one day, when I feel REALLY brave, I will try that cow's head burrito."}
{"text":"Great place.  Went on a quiet Monday    Husband had the asada combo and I had a bean cheese burrito.   All was excellent.   Table or counter service.    Very informal s styrofoam plate type of place -- but food was wonderful.   We will be back."}
{"text":"Food didn't taste freshly made, chicken was a lil hard, maybe they make the meat hot and fresh for lunch then reheat around dinner time. Food was good tasting. The salsa bar didn't seem very sanitary, I saw a customer use the same cup, big ladels, small cups. Our server Angelica was friendly. I think I will come back or maybe try some other places in the area."}
{"text":"This place is great! Nice people working here and amazing food. I had a taco de legua, carne asada and Tripa. My favorite is the Tripa. Just perfect!!!!!"}
{"text":"Picked up burritos for the drive home. Excellent! And also very clean bathrooms lol.  Area is run down (across from fairgrounds) but interior of restaurant is well-maintained."}
{"text":"Ordered the asada, pollo, lengua and barbacoa tacos. Asada and barbacoa meat was decent. Pollo and lengua were just so so. Al pastor wasn't on the menu which was disappointing. Didn't have chips when we asked the waitress. Had a salsa bar but the salsa was very bland and watery. Salsa bar didn't have onions and cilantro to put on the tacos."}
{"text":"I love Asadero Toro. My father and my friend make it a habit to come here after we volunteer at the homeless shelter in Phoenix. I always get carne asada tacos and horchata. I usually order 2 tacos at first, then put in an order for 2 more because they are so delectable.   The staff is friendly! I enjoy eating inside because it is quiet and clean. If you are in the mood for genuine Mexican food that is a great price, then this is your place!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed my visit to Asadero Toro.  The decor is minimalist, folding chairs and tables in an old Wendy's and a small bar with salsas and pickled vegetables on ice.  You gotta get carne asada at an asadero, I thought, and it was a good choice.  It comes served on a plastic tray much like you'd find at a school cafeteria, I felt special though as the other patrons got styrofoam plates :)  The food was delicious, solid tortillas, and they even gave me a char-grilled onion quarter."}
{"text":"Asadero Torro has catered my work's Christmas party for the last two years, and I've come to equate the celebration of the coming of lil' baby Jesus to a full tummy of tasty Asadero Torro tacos. I think JC would give thumbs-up to these heavenly tacos. The beef is sooooo flavorful, the corn tortillas sooooo yummy, and all the \"extras\" darn right essential for a complete and delectable meal. Even the refried beans and rice are awesome.  And since they are close to where I work, I don't have to wait another year to devote my taste-buds to their delicious food.  Amen!"}
{"text":"I live no where near this place but I was craving good carne asada and as always Yelp directed me to a great place! Their burritos only have meat in them and you have to ask for the salsa guacamole and everything else on the side or specify that you want it in the burrito. I always get everything on the side and the meat is well seasoned and tasty! I have been here twice in two weeks and my husband always asks me to pick some on my way home from ASU and it is worth the detour. The service is good too, take a break from your regular betos/bertos chains and grab something a little more authentic."}
{"text":"Moved here from east la where my backyard was literally a taco stand.    I have pretty high standards for tacos and it's been such a difficult ordeal finding tacos to meet my expectations believe it or not.  However these tortillas are amazing!  The meat is good quality and well cooked.  Got food service.    Drove 35 minutes to try this place.  Glad I did.  Best taco spot so far in Phoenix and I've tried many!"}
{"text":"Really great place for carne asada.  Asadero Toro takes the minimalist approach and it works well.  The carne asada tacos and burritos just come with two things:  carne asada and a tortilla.  From there you can go to the salsa bar and add what you want to taste.  To get away with this you have to have good carne asada and this place does.  It has a nice balance of spices.  Most places either add too much or too little.  The salsa and pico are fresh.  If you order the rice and beans you can get them inside the burrito if you want.  One thing that I didn't like:  can sodas.  I tend to drink a lot of fluids when I eat and going through cans kinda sucks.  Other than that it's a place worth checking out.  Really easy access, easy parking, fresh, and cheap (under $10)."}
{"text":"NOT FRESH VERY PLAIN And food took a long time even though the place was empty. We went here for dinner after work. We eat Mexican food often and chose this place because of positive Yelp reviews. We were very dissapointed."}
{"text":"One of the best if not the best authentic carne asada in town...!! You won't be disappointed...!!"}
{"text":"Stopped here with the boyfriend just before closing the other night for a late night burrito snack. Service was quick and everyone was friendly. The lengua burrito I got was delicious! Unlike most places that give you mostly beans and hardly any meat, the burrito was all meat and it was tender and juicy."}
{"text":"Delicious food and spicy salsa. This place is worth the drive if you do not live in the area. The staff is friendly and welcoming. Come and eat here."}
{"text":"Everything from the avocado to the meat to the tacos was great. All very fresh ingredients. The salsa is what pulled me in, you can get a side of onion and cilantro if you want that real."}
{"text":"Prologue: On March 19, 2013, I read an article on the Phoenix New Times website, listing the top 10 burritos in Phoenix Metro. I hadn't tried one of them. Being the founding member of the \"Because Burrito\" lifestyle, I took it upon myself to try every last burrito on the list. So began my journey... So began...  THE BURRITO BUCKET LIST Volume 1  This morning I was sitting in my little cube, thinking about how I could convince Jesse to have lunch at Asadero Toro, so I could knock the first burrito off my list - the classic carne asada. Just as I was collecting my nerves for my proposition, Jesse emailed me. She was feeling ill, and would need to go home early. God's glorious light shined down upon me and I knew that fate and I both had the same shit-eating grin plastered on our dumb faces.  After dropping Jesse off at home with a sandwich, I peeled out and beelined it straight to Asadero Toro. When I entered the establishment, the first thing I noticed was the salsa bar. Red chili, tomatillo with avocado, and molcajete, along with key limes and some other stuff (sorry, I'm primarily a salsa hound). This was not the variety I've seen at some other restaurants, but if it's good shit, I only need one type.  I walked up to the cashier, looking at the menu, faking like I was trying to make up my mind. I was pretty nervous about beginning my burrito adventure, and I'm sure it was noticed by the woman behind the counter, as she stared at my twitchy face with eyes drowning in unease. Finally, she broke the silence. \"Are you ready?\"  \"Carne asada burrito.\" The words gushed from my mouth. Suddenly her face changed, as if she suddenly understood the goings-on in my head. I paid and told her my order was to go, and she handed me a small Styrofoam container to hold my salsas. THIS HAS NEVER HAPPENED TO ME. I was in love. Long have I wallowed in the misery of having to balance my many salsas in the same bag as my burrito. This was a very welcome development, and I quickly gathered my salsas - two reds, one green, one molcajete, two limes just in case.  I got back to work with my burrito bag held close and promptly walked to the courtyard to feast. I tore the top half of aluminum foil from the underlying burro, and took a BIG ASS BITE. Immediately I noted the buttery flakiness of the tortilla and the slight crisp the meat had to it. These guys know how to grill asada. The New Times had told me it was nothing but \"straight-up meat,\" and they came correct on that. Straight-up, well-cooked, quality meat. I tried all of the salsas, but I stuck mostly with the red, as it was the spiciest, the most flavorful, and chunkier than most reds I've had, which I found was to my extreme liking. It was greasy, but the kind of greasy I can get down with. At the bottom of the burro I ran into a small pool of greasy meat, and the grease dripped down my chin with each generous chomp. I could have done with a little extra drainage prior to wrapping. But hey - the whole thing was a bundle of great, and I can handle a little extra grease.  I got up and collected the remains of my burrito carnage, and the coworker sitting behind me said, \"Boy, that was fast.\"  I responded, \"Apparently you haven't seen me eat before.\"  Good job, Asadero Toro, you have given me a new favorite carne asada burro. And so far, New Times is one for one.  Asadero Toro Carne Asada Burrito - 9/10"}
{"text":"If you happen to get lost and wander by the gun show at the Coliseum, be sure to stop here. A little whole in the wall of a former Wendy's, this place rocks the steak taco world.  My favorite is the \"jaz\". Carne asada + cheese + peppers/onions = yum!!!  The barbacoa and chicken tacos are tasty, but I wouldn't say they'd knock you off your feet. Definitely go carne asada and defintely try this place."}
{"text":"If you are a fan of real crane asada, then this is the place for you. This is one of the very few places in the state that uses the correct seasoning in their carne asada. The meat is always cooked correctly, and not overcooked like most places."}
{"text":"Hole in the wall take out or full service.  A salsa bar with radishes and a yummy fresh avocado sauce.  Loved the steak and cheese burrito.  Was so filling didn't even try my rice and beans.  Hubby liked the carne asada tacos but they are pretty small.  Son had the shredded beef torta.  It had an interesting smoky flavor.  Dinner for 4 with tip was about $20.  Can't beat that!!!"}
{"text":"Worst customer service I ever experienced at this place! Waited about 20 minutes until the server finally showed up at the table and said \"she forgot\"! I went up to the register to ask for a menu and the guy was so rude about it. After all my husband and I decided to stay and the tacos were delicious."}
{"text":"Love this place! I had a carne asada quesadilla (very guero of me) with rice and beans. The quesadilla was awesome! Great cheese. Beans and rice were awesome. Also loved the salsa bar. They had pico de gallo, avacado salsa, onions, limes, etc. the baños stink a little thus the 4 stars but will be back"}
{"text":"This ain't no place for one looking for gringoized Mexican food.  The menu has mostly torats and tacos, what it does not have are chips or many veggie options.  The inside is surprising nice for the area and type of place.  The salsa bar is great, with pico de gallo, picante and even a guacamole dip and cabbage.  I had a small cheese quseadilla and it was fine, my co worker had a torta with rice and beans he really enjoyed.  I want to say more but with a lack of non meat options and a Spanish only menu I had a bit of a hard time here.  If you want a Mexican food adventure and eat meat give it a try."}
{"text":"Great old school presentation.  Had the lengua, barbacoa, cabeza, and tripas tacos.  The salsa bar is also great for spoonfuls of pico de galleo and the smooth silky guac to elevate the tacos to another level.  If your in the area and wondering if you should try it I'd definitely say stop in.  Next time I go I'm ordering the family style meal.  Something about cooking sizzling meat at your table with fresh tortillas and different salsa hits a soft spot with me!"}
{"text":"When my fav tacos are not available this is a great place to eat. The tacos are delicious and if you order drive thru they are very generous with the ingredients for the tacos. The horchata is the powder mix kind, I wouldn't order it again. Also, the steak quesadilla although good flavor hardly had steak so I wouldn't order it again. Let's put it this way it had the equivalent steak of 1 small taco."}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  I grew up in California, and didn't think I'd find good Mexican food again after leaving.  It's awesome.  They even make their own tortillas.  If you've never had freshly made tortillas, you have to try them. They are so much better than what you can buy in the store.  Plus, they give you roasted onions, cabbage, salsa, and cucumbers with your meal, and the roasted jalapeno is delicious."}
{"text":"We went in for lunch today after reading Yelp reviews and a fellow foodie buddy assured us this is THE place to go for authentic flavors.  If you are looking for the real thing and want something totally different from the 'Mexican food' chains, this is the place for you. Both carne asada plate and carne asada burrito were delicious. The condiment station loaded with fresh lime, salsa, pickled onions, cabbage and pico de gallo really added to our already flavorful meals. Even though I don't speak hardly any Spanish at all, friendly and attentive staff patiently answered all my questions. Food came out fast while my corn tortillas were still steaming hot and in big portions. I would probably try the tacos a la cart next time so I can try a few other things.  Grilled onion that came with the Plate was so sweet and balanced out the spiciness of the roasted pepper. What a treat it was! I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. The customer service is awesome, and the food is bounds better than any local bertos. Plus, it's cheap!"}
{"text":"There service was excellent and the food on point like always. We got the family of four meal but it was way too much food for us I think the meal for two would of worked out just fine this is the tripe and beef delicious. This was our leftovers"}
{"text":"Took the family here for lunch after we hung out at the fair. Thank goodness they saved parking spaces so we could park and eat. Food was amazing, fresh and authentic. I would definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"If I didn't have some specific dishes I wanted, I would give this place 4 stars.  The positives are that the place is authentic and the people are very friendly.  The tortillas are wonderful in the extreme.  What I didn't like is that they have no chips.  Who goes to a Mexican restaurant knowing there are no chips?  I would have brought my own.  Second is that they had no enchilada.  The asada was very tasty and the rice and beans were perfectly good but not memorable.  Still this place is much better than a standard Mexican chain."}
{"text":"I came here because of the article I read in a magazine. I ordered the $7.50 carne asada burrito that came with rice and beans. Loved the tortilla. The carne asada was good. I'd give it a 7 out of 10 and would come back again to have it. Rice was simple but had good flavor. Beans were good too. The salsa bar was full of many things. I tried the pico, the hot sauce and the chunky green salsa. Each was very good. The inside was extremely clean as was the restroom. Staff was very friendly and very helpful and cleared the table. I would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"The tacos are tasty and affordable! I love that flour tortillas are an option!"}
{"text":"Stopped by to get a late taco dinner. Is clean and is cooked to order. Good selection of salsas and fresh vegetables. I am delighted and will back soon. Too bad is not open late, this is much better than the 24 hr Mexican joints."}
{"text":"Don't let the outside scare you away, best Sonoran Tacos in town! Abd by Sonoran I mean flavorful grilled beef. Try the Parrillada."}
{"text":"Always delicious, always great service! Must try the Molcajetes! Sooooo good and authentic! This place is clean and friendly inside - for the entire family."}
{"text":"If you are a carne asada fan, this is your place! Only other thing I tried was the barbacoa which was meh, and the flan which was GOOD!  Asada seems to be their famous item, so I will be back to try that again soon, as it was very tasty."}
{"text":"Hmmmm not sure why a place like this that seems to be in a busy area of a large City Phoenix had NO reviews?, oh well guess I get first!.  I've had my share of bad Mexican food through Arizona but that stops here at Asadero Toro, they have a nice selection of meats along with the usual Tacos, Burritos, Tortas, Platillos and Caldos incliding Birria de Chivo, some of the food we had was as follows.  Burrito de Barbacoa - (forgot photo) I was a little pissed when I saw the $7.00 burrito that was so small, the menu also said it had beans and when I cut it open to take a photo I saw no beans!, I opened it up and told the lady it had no beans and she showed me that it did, well.......when they say beans it's re-fried beans that they spread very sparingly on the tortilla like mayo on a piece of bread for a sandwich, almost invisible!.        The barbacoa was good not the best I've had but the burrito leaves you still hungry and not worth $7.00. 2.5-Stars  Taco/Flour de Carne Asada - http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/LrA0tRts4UI2JxGdzavY2w?select=UesCgSAa2WXX8Agm7A_SqA They do tacos in flour and corn tortillas, the carne asada was very flavorful wrapped in what seems to be hand made flour tortillas, some delicious tacos http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/LrA0tRts4UI2JxGdzavY2w?select=1-jzVDNjJrDmAKdLUBlLfQ 4-Star  Taco/Corn de Carne Asada - http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/LrA0tRts4UI2JxGdzavY2w?select=taCr4PMTUIUTzCckrIVMqw If you see the little layer of brown on top the tortilla this is the beans, this is what was on the burrito and barely noticeable in a burrito, even on the taco it's not enough to give it flavor so not sure why they do this?, but taco was very good http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/LrA0tRts4UI2JxGdzavY2w?select=2hHvnTHVkDomX0b6d5DZaA 4-Stars  Birria de Chivo - http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/LrA0tRts4UI2JxGdzavY2w?select=DjbKORyEUoXQnoo2WGKX0A For those who don't know what this is, it's a goat meat soup that when made right is delicious and this one was very good. The caldo or broth had a nice flavor and was fat free *(meaning they must strain off the fat from the caldo) good job!, the meat was tender and flavorful with very little fat http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/LrA0tRts4UI2JxGdzavY2w?select=rlrJouGZ9oJbDyswTpSCdQ I'm picky about the birria that I like but this one was very good 4/4.5-Stars  Stay away from ordering a burrito!, other than that we were very satisfied with all the food eaten here and glad to finally have some good Mexican food in Arizona \"The Racist State\""}
{"text":"5 stars for a neighborhood fast foodish dive? Yup.  Carne asada is great here of course, but really, I love being a 4 minute walk from some of the best Birria de Chivo ever. Big chunks of lamb, little chunks of fat, in a spicy, soupy broth.   Great head, too. By that, I mean I love their cabeza taco.   Plus, they are open late."}
{"text":"Had a great meal here. They made the yummiest carne asada burrito and were generous with the meat. Which I think is wonderful when it seems like everyone else is getting stingy with it. Their salsa bar is fresh and tasty. Prices were reasonable and service was friendly. We'll definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Our team at work placed a large order for ten people each with separate plates and special instructions and they fulfilled our order and even offered to label them with each persons name. They did it during lunch time hours and completed our order for pickup in 25 minutes. I would definitely recommend their service and even more their food. Everybody loved their food and even asked to go back very soon, which included tacos de asada, chicken, campechano, and a steak quesadilla. Their rice and beans were authentic.The avocados even if they were pricey were perfect, they were how avocados are meant to be. I would definitely recommend and gladly go back again. Thank you Asadero Toro for a pleasant experience!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite lunch spots. The portions are big. The service is fast and friendly. The food is delicious and inexpensive.    Definitely a spot you have to try when you're near the fairgrounds. Try the carne!"}
{"text":"This place is the very definition of whole in the wall but it is a fantastic lunch spot.   A friend and I decided to have lunch here one day and we knew the moment we found it that it was either going to be really great or really bad.   The restaurant itself is pretty much only open for lunch and is in a place that is not a typical place for a restaurant, meaning that it's probably a little sketchy there at night. It was an average size restaurant and maybe a little on the smaller side.    This is a no frills down to the point Mexican food place. Our waitress really did not speak much English which for me is a good sign. We ordered the make your own Carne Asada plate that came with rice and beans. The tortillas were fresh and home made and the steak was seasoned amazingly. I had very few charred or chewy pieces. The beans were too die for and the rices was the standard Mexican rice that my grandma showed me to make. This place was a legit home made mexican food restaurant and the service as great but a little slow (which was understandable because the place was pretty packed). The prices were great for lunch. My friend and I got out of there with a little under $11 each. The chips were pretty standard and nothing special and the salsas were pretty generic but still very tasty.   I really enjoyed every bite of my meal and I would go back again and again if I had a lunch partner and had a little bit more lunch time!"}
{"text":"The food was good ...the price is okay to me because back i would have got this for a lot less but for where am at it's good and much better than the state fair food.....and there open late that's a super plus ...just think there a bit rude that's all"}
{"text":"Say yes to the salsa bar!! I would buy their salsa by the buckets if I could. I also had the Asada burrito and it had amazing flavor. We live about 45 minutes away from this place, but we will definitely make the drive back out here."}
{"text":"Don't miss the carne asada! I love the carne asada mini quesadillas."}
{"text":"This place doesn't look like much on the outside and you'll have to disregard the white foldable tables and chairs as you walk inside....but the food is AMAZING. This is Sonora Style Mexican food so keep that in mind.    Here are my ratings:  MEAT:  I had the Carne Asada tacos.  The carne asada meat was perfect.  It had a slight mesquite smokiness and very flavorful.  The type of meat was Ranchera, which is the ideal type for asada tacos.  The meat was cut against the grain, perfect!  Tortillas:  The tortillas are the best!  They're made on site....flour tortillas.  Not that cheap stuff you get at the store with tons of preservatives.  This is the real deal...fresh and tasty.    Salsa:  The salsa is good.  But it could be great.  I favor the really spicy stuff so for the average salsa person...it will be good.  Extras:  They line the inside of their tacos with Frijoles Puercos.  These are great beans that have ham, pork and a few different types of cheeses mixed in.  If you've never had these type of beans...you've never had beans!  I love how they just add a little to the tortilla and then the meat on top.  It's enough to add even more flavor to the taco but no so much that it overpowers the meat.  They have your basic cucumbers, salsas, onions and cilantro set up.  You have to try this place...it's the best tacos in Phoenix!!!"}
{"text":"Seriously something special. Living in Arizona you know there's a million taco shops on every corner. I stumbled to this place because a friend lived near, and must say this is by far one of my favorite taco shops! The tacos carmello is really something special. Flour tortilla with white cheese and carne asada!! Don't sleep on these. Also I feel like you can tell a lot about a place by there beans, and they have some of the best beans in Phoenix. The prices are great and anytime you go into a ethnic restaurant  and lots of people of that ethnicity eating there, you know it's official!!"}
{"text":"I really love their carne asada. It has a really good taste. I haven't tried any other items."}
{"text":"Asadero Toro is definitely one of the best, if not THE best,  taco places in town. I've been coming here for years and they are always consistent and never disappoint. Their flour tortillas are better than most places.  Their beans have a little kick which is a nice break from the standard refried beans at most restaurants. The only reason this place is not 5 stars is because the salsa bar is a little too simple, no salsa verde??? And their rice is a little weak. Other than that I've never had a complaint,  wish I could give 4.9 stars."}
{"text":"Asadero is located in kind of a sketchy area. Despite looking like a converted fast-food restaurant with an order counter, you can be waited on by a server if you decide to dine in.    I opted for three tacos (carne asada, barbacoa, and cabeza), while my girlfriend ordered both an asada and barbacoa. They make their own flour tortillas here, so we decided to choose flour over corn.  First of all, the consistency of the tortillas were very soggy and goopy. The carne asada was pretty standard and really no different than what you'd get at any other run-of-the-mill place. The barbacoa, on the other hand - are you serious? I have no comment on the cabeza. I've never tried it before and I'm pretty sure this wasn't the safest place to actually give it a go-around. It was one of those rare instances where neither one of us finished our tacos.  The quesadilla was edible, while the beans would serve me best if I had a feeding tube in my stomach and had them served to me via syringe. But for traditional dining? Not so much. I'm sorry, but \"liquid beans\" just don't do it for me.    Unfortunately, the inclusion of MexiCoke was not enough to save this atrocity of a restaurant.  Based on the Yelp reviews, if this is what people claim is \"real\" Mexican food, then I'll gladly continue going to the \"fake\" places like La Santisima and Tacos Chiwas that seem to know what in the hell they're doing.  Big fail!"}
{"text":"My absolute favorite carne asada spot in Phoenix and I consider myself a connoisseur. Bring a friend and order the carne asada platter which is served on an oven hot steel platter. Although I usually prefer corn, order the flour tortillas which are freshly made and are quite delicious."}
{"text":"I cannot talk bad about this place, now I have other favorite Mexican food spots but this place is open late and deliver fast. So for us late not munchers, us to tired to make a meal, and us I need something to soak up this liquir look no farther , this is the place. The meats , are actually well seasoned and taste fresh . I haven't had a bad experience in that department . its a great place price wise really cheap and you get a a lot for your buck. Now the only thing working against this place is the location. But trust me its safe for all my favorite snow flakes out there, the surrounding area is no longer bad. I also think a sign would help but the food , is great. Now the interior could use a redesign if I am being honest. I order to go based on this. Go get a meal and trust me its worth the order."}
{"text":"Very good food!!!!!"}
{"text":"I've said this before and I'll probably say it again.. you really can't mess up a carne asada taco. I had been here before once a while back and today I opted for the drive thru. I ordered two crane asada tacos on CORN tortillas. Guess what? They gave me flour. Of course I didn't realize until i was already home so I just ate it. The tacos were really good and I appreciated that they sent me home with all the fixings even though I went through the drive thru. If you really want to please your customer, try listening more attentively and getting the orders right."}
{"text":"1020 pm drive thru hits the spot. I ordered 3 carne asada tacos and my friend ordered a carne asada burrito. The meals came with a box of cabbage, cucumber, lime, and pico. There was also a separate side of grilled onions. Everything was fantastic. But they don't serve guacamole....weird. No bueno. Everything else was amazing. Can't tell from the outside, but definitely at least drive thru"}
{"text":"I know this place is all about the beef, but the beans, rice and flour tortillas are delicious. Salsa bar is awesome. The avocado salsa, fresh cucumbers and cabbage make the meal."}
{"text":"Delicious and authentic! Would definitely come again. The hot sauce they have is awesome. The only thing I wasn't too crazy about was hot wet my tortillas were. I have a feeling it was from the meat juices, but it made it hard to pull apart the two tortillas."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! I've worked in the area for over a year and had no idea it was even here. The food is remarkable! I had the carne asada burrito which was very flavorful and not greasy at all. The tripas (taco) was cooked to perfection, as well. I will definitely be coming again. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Its in the middle of no where but they have fresh, amazing tortillas and great carne asada. Love the fresh salsa bar and the toppings they offer. The only downside is that unless you speak Spanish, the staff doesn't really acknowledge you. Good thing once my bf noticed this he started speaking in Spanish and they perked right up. ;)"}
{"text":"I was not expecting the best carne asada tacos ever when I decided to stop at this place. Boy was I surprised! Totally blew my mind. I'll definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"If you don't like to eat cow, then turn back now!   As the name suggests, this is a Mexican restaurant specializing in beef, carne asada, and grilled steak.   The good: This asada is cooked very well! $6 gets you a giant burrito, even if it is   The bad: As good as it's cooked, it's pretty much unseasoned. But still though, I'm sure you can dress it up yourself!  ...the salsa is incredibly mild, unfortunately. Like they're afraid of scorching anyone. In the end, this place is OK I guess, but not even close to the premiere taqueria you'd expect it to be from the looks of it."}
{"text":"This was my rebound dinner after a horrible first experience at Whataburger. What-a-difference.  The carne asada and pollo were delicious but the barbacoa was kinda eh.  And what was the story with the salsas? They're set out on the three shelves of a rolling cart, some low enough that you have to crouch down to serve yourself. I realize that you guys were near closing but that's just too close to the floor for my taste.  The salsa thing puts 'em at risk for loosing a star but after such horrible food at Whataburger this place tasted like food from Heaven.  2013 #3 / 365"}
{"text":"This place never disappoints. I've been coming here for years and am so happy that the flavors are consistently good. It's nothing fancy, but it has come along way! I'm so excited that they now have a drive through :) but it's not like it took very long to go in anyway. Fast/good service and delicious food. :)"}
{"text":"Great Taos and close to the airport!  I'm  not a big fan of corn tortillas, so I was really impressed to find this authentic Mexican restaurant offer flour tortillas.  I highly recommend the carne com queso (beef and cheese) or their tender babacoa (shredded beef)"}
{"text":"Love this spot.  Simple authentic good.  The Carne asada is on point.  Nothing is over complicated and that is why this place is great!"}
{"text":"We went over to Asader Toro late right before closing, and I was afraid of the service and food we would receive as it was SO close to closing time and I was pleasantly surprised. Our tacos were delicious and the lady was super friendly! The horchata at this place is AMAZING!!!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in the neighborhood. My favorite in the entire valley actually. Fresh handmade tortillas. Fresh food. Awesome salsa bar. Friendly staff. A little pricey for a little taco shop but well worth it. The queso fundido and carne asada are must haves!"}
{"text":"I just have to say that the Kearny Asada burrito for $5.99 is the best thing in the area hot fresh they got a choice of a green sauce guacamole sauce and a really really hot sauce pico de gallo and it's out of control"}
{"text":"Meat was reheated -- my husband got the Molcajete meal and the meat was tough and dry and had the appearance of being reheated Tacos were $2 -- too expensive for how small they were. Horchata is made from a mix, not from scratch. Salsas were only ok -- not fresh tasting. Everything was bland and needed salt."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! The jaz tacos are to die for.  The flour tortillas are handmade and take me back to the 80s when tortillas tasted good,  not the crappy tortillas you get now.  No it's not fancy,  But it's clean and the salsa bar has 4 salsas, shredded cabbage, radishes, etc.  And best of all it is a great value.  You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Passed by this place a few times, and finally decided to stop.  I get a hankering for some street tacos every now and then.  Placed my order for 3 tacos total.  One carne asada on corn tortillas, one carne asada on a flour tortilla, and one pollo asado on a flour tortilla.  Total was $6.50 ($1.99 each).  Paid the lady my money, loaded up on some condiments (limes, pico, pickled onions and hot sauce), and took a seat.  A few minutes later, they brought out my tacos.  Here is how they were...........  Pollo Asado-  Their tacos come plain with just protein of choice and tortilla.  I added some lime, onions and hot sauce to my pollo taco.  Very tasty!  It was cubed chicken breast, chopped up.  It has a nice smokey flavor and was piping hot!  The tortillas are made in house (flour ones at least) and they provided a nice little crunch, yet soft chew at the same time.  The red hot sauce they have is pretty hot!  Made me sweat a bit.  Definitely a good taco.  I would even go as far as getting a pollo asado burrito next time.  I was impressed!  Carne Asada-  I've found a few spots in town that have respectable carne asada.  I can safely say that Asadero Toro is now in that group.  Their asada had a nice smokey flavor, no gristle, and a great taste to it.  I topped my asada tacos with pico, limes, onions and hot sauce.  They double up the small corn tortillas and they tasted great!  The flour ones were a little bit better, but the corn tortillas were definitely good, too.  Same as the pollo, I would not hesitate to get a burrito stuffed with this carne asada.  It was really good and reminded me of some of my favorite joints from San Diego.  Overall, I was glad I stopped.  If I am craving some legit street tacos, this place definitely fits the bill!  Cashier was friendly, place was clean, and prices were pretty good for the quality of tacos.  I'm not down in this area much, but even then, this is a spot I could see myself driving to from Surprise.  I will grab a burrito next time and maybe try out some of their other meats. If they are as good as the carne asada and the pollo, I will be a happy camper!"}
{"text":"This place is legit. Don't expect much from the area or the neighborhood. But when you go in the staff is courteous and the place is clean.  I was just driving wanting to try something new. I had passed this place several times. But what caught my eye was the painted sign on the window \"Birria de Chivo\" and Menudo served all week. Wow, most places only serve menudo on weekends. I pulled into the lot and decided to look them up in Yelp to see what if anything others had experienced. Looked good.   I ordered 2 days worth of food. The torta de carne asada, and the birria de chivo (shreaded goat meat in a lightly seasoned broth) and a large horchata. She asked if I wanted the torta meal with beans and rice  or just the torta. I replied just the torta. She also provided me with a small sandwich style container for putting in veggies from the salsa bar and said if i needed another to just ask. I helped myself to the fresh sliced cucumbers, radishes, cabbage, wedges of key lime and pickled onions on the bar and filled a few small cups of salsa. The red was spicy with a vinegar base. The green was quite tasty as was the pico de gallo.  The birria came with corn tortillas and small containers of fresh onion and cilantro. Again this was served as a caldo (sans veggies) but that is what you toss in the onions, cilantro, lime juice and some salsa. Yum!   The torta was huge. Warning it doesn't come dressed. I was expecting the mayo, avocado, tomato to already be on this. But luckily I had picked up all the fixings at the salsa bar to make it work. And boy did it work. The pickled onions, cabbage, pico, avocado crema, salsa verde....Mmmm...."}
{"text":"Because I'm a genius and thought the fair had opened at 10 or 11 on Thursday I ended up being on McDowell and 19th Ave an hour before they opened. Since it was hot and I was thirsty, started walking down McDowell...and discovered this place. Decided to go inside and saw tortas and decided that I was going to eat lunch here as well as just get something to drink while waiting. The torta was about $6 and was pretty big. It was full of nice meat, avocado, and other good things. I also had gotten a tostada for about $2 but wasn't overly impressed with that. Either way, I decided to check in on yelp when I was waiting for my food (which wasn't long) and saw that it was a 4.5 star place... and I totally approve. I'll be back when I want a torta!"}
{"text":"Took a while to make it out here because this spot is a little west of me but man, I make the trip at least once a week if not more!!! The best tacos in Phoenix in my opinion.    I factor a few simple things into the \"Best Taco in Phoenix\" equation.  Taste+Salsa/Sides+Price= Best Taco's in Town  The Asada is very delicious here, always cooked fresh and leaps and bounds better than anything I've ever had in a Bertos style spot.  At $2 each the portion is solid, bigger than most taco shops in the area.  You can choose corn or flower tortilla and there are several meat options to choose from: Asada, Pollo, Lengua, Tripas, ect...   The best part is the salsa's and sides.  Even when I hit the drive thru, I receive a huge container of shredded cabbage, fresh sliced cucumbers, fresh pico de gallo, and slices of limes all included without even having to ask.  Their avocado guacamole sauce is better than anyone else's, I always ask for extra green sauce!!    Asadero Toro is a clear cut winner in a city riddled with taco joints, worth the trip if your reading this :-)"}
{"text":"Well, this is the real deal when you want a taco or tostada.  It's the EXACT food you will eat in Mexico.  Exact.  I ordered the asada.  Beef on a corn tortilla that is made there-- a real tortilla.    Then you go over to a salsa, quacamole, hot sauce, cucumber, cabbage and radish, onion bar and fix it up how you like.    The 5 stars is for the food, the ambiance and setting is not anything special.  In fact, it is a bit of a turn off , but very clean.  It's in an old Wendy's I think.   The food is so delicious, it doesn't matter!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Very good carne asada. They serve it in tacos, burritos or plates including rice and beans roasted jalapenos and roasted onions, YUM! They also have Mexican sodas that are made with cane sugar instead of corn syrup, which tastes way better. They also have a fresh salsa and vegetable bar which is really good. Delete reason to grade down from 5 to 4 would be that rarely and I mean rarely the steak is somewhat tough. But when that happens or just send it back and they replace it for me."}
{"text":"I came here as it was somewhat close to the airport and I had to drop someone off there. Anyway, I chose this place because of the glowing reviews that it had. I'm not quite sure what the hubbub is all about. Although the lady at the register was very nice, the food was nothing to write home about. We ordered the chicken taco, tripe taco, jaz burrito, and a large horchata. The food was on the greasy side and there wasn't much to top the taco with. There was a bar with lettuce, pico de gallo, and different hot sauces, but no beans, cheese, rice, or avocado. The same could be said for the burrito. The real downer here was the tripe - it was WAY overcooked, hard, and had a slight livery taste to it. You could tell that the tripe itself wasn't very fresh. The best part of the meal was the horchata, but that was just decent and not the best I've had. Next time I'm at the airport, I think I'll stick with La Frontera."}
{"text":"Convenient mexican food by the Arizona State Fair/Veterans Memorial Coliseum! Simple counter and sit down service with very friendly and welcoming staff. Food was just ok, but quick with a very diverse salsa bar. Ventilation is an issue here, as smoke from the kitchen's grill entered the dining area. Food was ready shortly after ordering. It's good if you want mexican food for a pre or post visit to the state fair area. I had the Asada (steak) combination plate with rice and beans, tortillas, jalapeno, and onions."}
{"text":"So, I was house sitting in the area and was looking for something different for lunch. Pizza was out of the question, and I wasn't in the mood for Chinese. When I found Asadero Toro on Yelp, I about freaked out! Since I wanted something out of the ordinary, this place offered up some awesome options. Aside from the quesadilla chica (which was pretty standard), I ordered two lengua tacos and two cabeza tacos. While I was waiting for my order, I filled up a dish with shredded cabbage, limes, cucumber and radishes as garnish for the tacos. After returning to the house and dogs I was watching, I dug in. Both meats were perfectly cooked and amazingly flavorful!  I'll definitely be back. But at just over $12, it did seem a bit expensive for lunch that wasn't downtown. And the cashier threw away my receipt without offering it to me, so kind of dick."}
