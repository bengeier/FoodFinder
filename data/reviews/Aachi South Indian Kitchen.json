{"text":"Fuck the place because their food is like sheet it looks like they make white their feet and the costumer service is so bad that they took like 25:00 mint to take the food"}
{"text":"we ordered food that took over two hours to be delivered.When it got here,it was cold.The samosa was very salty,the lamb biriani was absolutely disgusting,I only managed two bites before dumping it,the flavour was awful,the meat tasted old,and the rice was clumpy.it all tasted like stale,about to expire food.i also tried the Masala dosa,it was overly spiced,dry and the chutneys they provided tasted so bad.Our entire meal,including starters and soups,as well as entrées,ended up in the trash.
I have eaten south Asian food before and I am familiar with the cooking,this was absolutely the worst food I have had,disgusting,bland and smelly in a bad,not good way,food.i will never eat here and spend over $50 for food that ended up in the trash.we went to McDonald's for dinner."}
{"text":"I went here on a whim, while I was driving around looking for something to eat for lunch.  I ordered the Chana Masala and it was excellent. I ordered my food to go and the portions were more than I could eat in one sitting. The place is super clean and  I was greeted by a really nice lady who I assume was the owner or the management.   She was very attentive.  I can't wait to go back to try other things on the menu or their lunch buffet.  Very happy I stopped in this place."}
{"text":"I am writing this review a month late. I had a horrible experience with them. I ordered Paneer Tikka Masala and was served with Chicken Tikka Masala. After a few bite we realized something was wrong and we informed them. All she did was laugh and say their must have been a mix up in the kitchen. Although she did apologize, but she was laughing more on the blunder. Me and my husband are vegetarian, and got really angry. I felt the least she could do was not charge for the dish, but they went ahead and did it anyways. I would not be returning to this restaurant.
If you go their, plz check you order."}
{"text":"Ordered from them off grubhub. I guess their delivery driver broke down and the food was over a hour late. The food was still good cold though lol. They gave us the same order the next day for free, and the food was . Get the lamb saag!"}
{"text":"I took an order for takeout and the food smelled and tasted stale. The color of malai kofta was really odd and literally threw it away after one chapati bite. Zero star from me."}
{"text":"We were really hungry and called ahead. After making sure it was open, we reached there to find a restaurant with a nice ambience and a very pleasant hostess. Order taken quickly and food arrived quickly. Most everything we ordered was delicious. The schezewan fried rice, chana batura, gobi manchurian were great. Dosa not too great. Very attentive hostess who came and chatted with us and kept checking on us. Great experience. Will definitely go again."}
{"text":"Been here twice and had very different experiences both times. 

The food is decent, South Indian fare. Not spectacular but not awful either. The prices and portion sizes are odd. My husband ordered a vegetarian korma and parota combo and got only one inedible parotha. At 11 bucks , a bit rich, especially compared to similar Indian restaurants in Tempe and Chandler. My Onion rava masala was huge and quite decent. 

Last time the lunch buffet was a better experience, though again mixed reviews on the food.

On my last visit, the server  was a lovely, smiling fellow who was both enthusiastic and available. Today, we had a grim lady who was serving the two occupied tables in the restaurant. I had to go looking for her  as the restroom was missing hand towels and toilet seat covers. She was not able to give me a napkin and it was just simpler to root around in my bag for one. 

Both times there haven't been many people and I am going to be headed to other South Indian restaurants where there is less pain and better, cheaper food easily available!"}
{"text":"Warning: Do not attempt to use the $12.00 Groupon voucher that was offered for the lunch buffet. The manager refuses to honor not only the voucher but also the amount paid for it, so you have to pay full price. Food is OK but customer service is severely lacking."}
{"text":"The food here is excellent. The buffet was decently sized, though it's split into half vegetarian and half meat dishes. This made for me wishing there were a few more meat entrees to choose from, though I did try and enjoy some of the vegetarian options. The egg biryani was seriously one of the best biryanis I've ever had. Price is a little on the steep end at $12.99 for the buffet, but still not completely unreasonable. Definitely worth the visit."}
{"text":"Wow...The food is REALLY good. I just started working in the area and I'll be going for lunch once a week. I had never had Indian food from a restaurant before, just a couple homemade dishes from some friends and collegues from India. The owner was really nice and patient in helping me find something I would like. I literally was amazed how good the food was and I left  wanting to stop there for dinner on my way home from work, and dreamt of eating there for the next few days."}
{"text":"Visited this place last month for the first time and all I have to say is that they have a tough competition compared to all the other Indian restaurants in the valley.
We went in for a lunch buffet. The spread was fair enough but I wish the food was hot and tasty. Things were cold including the Tandoori Naan. 

Worst of all was that the owner ended up chatting incessantly with one of the customers and would hardly pay attention to us or others.

Many a things need to improve in this place, well taste and courtesy topping the list."}
{"text":"\"Please see the screen shot of the message that I received from the chef of this restaurant for posting this negative review!!\" I have posted it in the photos section for this restaurant. 

I wish there is a way to give 0 star. If you are bored on weekend night go to this restaurant and you can have a fight club situation here. And you know why, because the drunk chef(he is the only one making food in the kitchen) from kitchen will fight with you if you complain about the poor quality of food. He said that he should be with his family on the weekend but he is stuck in the kitchen because of US (the customers). He raised voice and shouted on the customers and said if you wanted free food, you should have told us in the starting!!! Do I seem like a BEGGAR to you!??!

Never ever take the unlimited(but owner won't let you eat more than 3 dosa) dosa option. The owner will come and say that the BATTER is over !!! So in what way is it unlimited???? They charged $12.99 for this UNCOOKED, stale, dosa with spoilt chutney, sambar that tastes like brinjal curry made by a chef who is drunk and who is more interested in being at home than making better food for the customers.. I had to eat dosa with mint chutney... Never in my life I had this horrible food or customer service from any of the restraunts. 

PLEASE DO YOURSELF A FAVOR BY NOT GOING HERE.. Rather go to MCD and have anything from their $1 menu!!"}
{"text":"This place has changed multiple hands - recently we visited this place about 2-3 weeks back. Almost all dishes had too much salt and oil - the dessert (Jamoon) was rubbery as it it was re-heated from a ready to eat dish."}
{"text":"Great place, I have been going here for a couple of years and the food has always been great on the lunch buffet. Jenny, maybe the owner but definitely the person who runs the place could not be more hospitable or welcoming.

About a year ago I started eating vegan and found that I could still come here and have an amazing meal, half of their buffet is vegan/vegetarian! I just ask which of the vegetarian dishes have chicken or beef stock, ghee, butter or milk products and usually it is only one that I am not able to eat, many times I can have everything on the vegetarian half. They even bring me out unbuttered naan to the table as part of the buffett. Also, you must give the Spring Dosa try, it is huge!!!"}
{"text":"Food was OKAY, but portion was the size of my palm, maybe 3-4 oz.  VERY SMALL for half order, ridiculously small!   Will not return because of portion size and poor value for the money.   Taste okay, have had better."}
{"text":"Authentic and spicy Indian cuisine. One caveat is that I haven't had dinner here. The lunch buffet had great chutneys and a wide variety of dishes. The even had a goat dish. Clean atmosphere and they even had a cricket match on the tele."}
{"text":"Went for weekend buffet. For vegeterian options are mininal. Rice was under cooked . So i was not able to feed my kid. . Naan was good. Sambhar that is not sambhar. Paneer sabji was good. Had cut fruits but they named it as salad. Dont know why. May be went on a wrong day"}
{"text":"I hate to say this, but I would not go back. I had been wanting to try it for quite awhile. I always noticed it in the parking lot. So one day(a week day) I thought I would give it a try. I came in and there was only one other table there. They serve only a Buffet during lunch.
Yes, I would love to give it a try.
Let me start by saying ,I love Indian Food. The flavors are magnificent and to me it always smells wonderful.
This was not. On the buffet was quite a variety but everything looked as if it had been cooked last night. They had laid saran wrap plastic on the bottom of the containers. So i guess it would not dirty the pans. However, it kept the food from being really warm, and certainly not hot. I like Goat meat, but theirs was full of bones, and not really much Flavor.  The dishes were all dry, even though they were smothered in sauce.
I felt the food was dry. As if it had been way over heated too many times.
There were piles of dirty dishes everywhere. Which really turned me off the food. I hate seeing used plates when I am eating.
I never got a refill on my hot tea. Also, the Buffet was $9.00 and some change, I gave her a $20.00 and she shorted me a dollar. Just a small thing,but one of many.
Maybe dinner is better, but I think I will pass in the future. Nothing was great at all."}
{"text":"Tried to come here twice this week for dinner. It's closed. No sign to explain why. Very frustrating."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner at around 7 pm. The place was nice and clean. Plates and silvers were properly arranged. The management is very nice. Ordered Chettinad chicken. And honestly the chicken was one of the best I had in Phoenix. 
So if you crave for some delicious South Indian food, this is the place to visit. 
Good job guys."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic!!!!  A diamond in the rough for sure.  Very clean, fresh & friendly service. 
Starter:Gobi Manchurian (fried cauliflower in a indo-chinese sauce) FANTASTIC!! A little spicy as it had red crush peppers in the sauce.  

I ordered Lamb Igaru- DEVINE!!! This was a sweet yet spicy sauce with tender pieces of lamb.  It also contained shone sauteed onions.  Awesome over the batsami rice though I ate it with my garlic naan.  

My man ordered goat curry- HE LOVED IT!!! Now there are bones in this dish so be careful as you eat it.  Also, very spicy so if spice isn't your thing that you may want to try something else.  He ate every bite & didn't share. 

The best part is the price...total bill for 1 starter, 1 garlic naan, 2 entree, 1 mango lasse & 1 chai tea... $42 and we had plenty to take home as left overs.  SERIOUSLY..if you have not come to this place you are missing out."}
{"text":"Humble request never try this place!! Disgusting tasteless and overpriced. They serve stale food and leftovers. The paneer tikka was just red in color and horrible. The lamb chops were disgusting. They lied about the meat being halal. Dosas were stale and smelly. And the yoghurt in dahi wada was stale as hell. The quantity is way too less and the prices are way to high for the quality they serve!! I was so pissed off."}
{"text":"So I have to get this place 3 stars. 

The food is actually pretty good but the thing that knocks this in rating is I have been here twice, both at 11 maybe 11:05 when they open and they are not even close to setting up the food buffet. It wasn't until 11:30 until they were really ready for customers. Now I am Indian and I know we are usually late but if you want to cater to the lunch crowd that usually has time constraints then you should be ready for service when you open. 

If you are not in a hurry at the beginning of their opening time then you should try this place."}
{"text":"They have some new stuff in their menu as well, please request for recommendations according to the taste.

I have tried both vegetarian and non-vegetarian, both have turned out nice. Be careful about the spice levels, and start at a low level if you are not sure.

The food is flavorful and true to the Indian taste."}
{"text":"I went there because a friend raved about the lunch buffet and how good the food was.  I figured if the lunch was that good - I would try it for dinner.  Perhaps they have a different cook in the evenings .. but it was not good at all!  I would only give them 1 star but they were very nice and the customer service is very good ... BUT the food was terrible.  It was almost like they just don't put the effort forth for a dinner crowd.  I ordered this \"sampler plate of vegetarian dishes\" and an order of Tandoori chicken.  The sampler platter - everything was COLD (perhaps it was leftovers from the lunch buffet???) and some of the things were dried out.  The Tandoori chicken I sent back twice ... the chicken wasn't tender at all.  It was tough & rubbery.  Disgusting - is the best word to describe the chicken.  After I sent it back the 2nd time - I told them just forget it and take it off my bill.  They ended up bringing out a different chicken dish and I give them an \"A\" for effort, but even that dish wasn't good.  The chicken was very, very dry and so hard to get down w/o water.  I didn't eat that either.  

I will never go back there again - the whole experience was disappointing."}
{"text":"Maybe the buffet is a better deal. The a la carte is pricey and the portions are small. The food has great taste and the naan was warm and puffy, just like I like it. Ask for ice in your water or you will be stuck with room temperture. 

Waitress was maybe having a bad day, seem to have been distracted and moody. 

I'll give it another try for their buffet and see if they can redeem themselves."}
{"text":"Went there for the $8.00 buffet today, it was delicious!!!
Nothing was old or dried out, service was great, and everything I tried was flavorful. I completely recommend this place, try to ignore any bad reviews and try it for yourself."}
{"text":"Today's vegetarian buffet was very bad. Mirchi bhaji, veg noodles and Naan were good. The paneer butter Masala had very hard paneer. There were two desserts special Bengali sweet and sheera which were soo bland. The one star I am giving for this restaurant is for the service offered by the waiter.
I have been to this same restaurant few months back. The food was good few months back."}
{"text":"Definitely will never eat here again, and I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. 

The chicken vindaloo was watery in texture and taste, the vinegar aspect of the dish was over powering, and it was not spicy at all. 

The potato samosa was decent and the chutneys were not bad. The samosa was over done on a few places, almost to the point of being burnt. 

The delivery guy was also rude over the phone telling me he couldn't find my apartment because I didn't have a building number listed (we don't even have building numbers, just apartment numbers)... I've gotten food delivered from at least 10 different places since I moved here and NOT ONE has had a problem finding my place..."}
{"text":"It's now called Bombay Wok, and the menu has changed since they incorporated the Indo-Chinese dishes, but I was really impressed with the quality of food. The taste was very close to the Indo-Chinese food available in India, and brings back memories from home."}
{"text":"My fiance and I decided to try this restaurant about 3 weeks ago for the first time. The interior is nice and cozy and the lady that owns the restaurant is very friendly and welcoming. I had high expectations and felt I had eaten enough Indian food growing up in India to be able to judge this place. I ordered the boneless chicken biryani while my fiance ordered paneer tikka masala and garlic naan and an order of chicken lollipops for appetizers. I loved my biryani and thought it was fairly authentic tasting. The naan was fresh and tasty, the paneer tikka masala was good. The chicken lollipop came with the traditional Indo-Chinese sichuan sauce which was delicious and spicy.

The second time I came here with a few friends, I ordered their veggie fried rice and chicken manchurian combo. The chicken manchurian was not really close to what I ate in India but equally delicious in its own way. The sauce reminded me of a sweetish sriracha and the chicken was wonderfully crisp. I personally would have preferred less pepper and whole peppercorns in the fried rice and ended up just eating the chicken manchurian by itself. At the end of dinner, the really nice owner came and filled our glasses (which she was very prompt about) with what tasted like coconut water. It was sweet and refreshing and a great way to end the meal. I would absolutely recommend this restaurant if you like Indian food."}
{"text":"Liked the desert portion. Taste of the main course was good but could get better to justify it as south Indian Kitchen."}
{"text":"Where do I start?

a) The big signs on the window reading \"LUNCH BUFFET\" are false advertising.  There was no buffet.
b) It's the lunch rush and your restaurant is empty.  There is ZERO REASON for a 20 minute wait for food everyone knows you have pre-prepped. 
c) $12.50 for a chicken dish is ridiculous when there are only about 4 oz of chicken on the plate.  You should be ashamed of yourselves.
d) bring all the food at once.  This isn't a 4 course meal (at the lunch hour, remember) so there's no reason for the garlic naan to show up 10 minutes after the food was delivered.  

*THERE WERE NO OTHER CUSTOMERS, REMEMBER*

e) When the customer's credit card is on the edge of the table, this is telling you to take it and run it.  Making 10 trips to accomplish what you can do in 2 is NONSENSE.
f) When you finally do make a trip to pick up the credit card and I ask you to bring me a to go box, STOP AND GET THE DAMN BOX!

Listening comprehension is important when dealing with beings that use a verbal communication form.

I am sad that the friend I was trying to introduce to Indian food had THIS as her first experience.  I'll be taking her to Cuisine of India, Delhi Palace, or Priya shortly to show her how it's really done.  Disgraceful."}
{"text":"I came here at 11:50 am and stayed here till 12:50 pm. This place is dead for buffet.  I came with teammates . I stayed here for  hr but all I show 7 ppls including 3 of us. Staff stay inside most time. I have to wait 20-30 m to get naans. I asked about naan. Then lady bring that with in minute. I doubt about food freshness. 
 Not recommended for buffet. Not sure about dinner :(
--
Food taste:
Vegi food: it was ok. 3/5
Non veg: 3.5/5 
--

Please careful about bill as well. They said buy one and get other half. We were 3 people and my bill was 29.21 Inc tax. Their  buffet charge is 8.99 per person . 

I asked lady about charge , She said, I should mentioned her about it if I want to get bill like that or not. 

Advertising something and charging something !!! 

Crazy ethics!!!!"}
{"text":"Weekday lunch had around 15 main dishes (not including salads and sweets). Naan was not served at the table but was rather on the buffet counter. Mango lassi was refreshing. Food was at best mediocre. 
We had a Groupon ($12 - lunch for 2). When we presented this, the owner told that they had cancelled their agreement with Groupon and did not honor our coupon. We ended up paying $19.50 with no drinks. Lunch was not worth the price."}
{"text":"Very very slow service. Food is all soggy. Vegetable pakora has uncooked dough inside.... If you do delivery it will take almost 2 hours to get to your place, and when you call and ask you get angry response. This is really a big disappointment. I strongly recommend you pick somewhere else."}
{"text":"The quality of food is excellent and service is great. The carrot halwa desert is the best. I like how the naan is available to take as much or as little as you would like. I don't like wasting a whole basket of naan if I don't finish it. The fish curry was also surprisingly good."}
{"text":"I'm very excited about this place - it's going to be my go-to for comfort Indian food. Goat Biryani is a must try. Everything had a bit of a kick to it, so be ready. 

Our servers were very friendly and welcoming. Felt like being greeted by family."}
{"text":"Just noticed this restaurant was in my delivery area so I decided to give it try. Wow is all I have to say. Had the butter chicken masala and the chicken vindaloo. Both really good and the food was hot like had ordered it dining in. That is never the case with most deliveries. I highly recommend eating here. I'm sure I will be multiple times a month."}
{"text":"We go to very often because their Arabs dosa, utappa are excellent. Also v recommend their buffet. Some time they have Bataks vada just super.  I am glad they r in town."}
{"text":"I would never go to this place again.  Nothing was fresh.  They would have probably made all items few days ago.  Importantly, we were told that the buffet price was $11.99 and they had a promotional offer of buy one buffer and get the second one for half the price. But, We were charged for $13.99 for one. When asked about it,  they told if we wanna use the offer the charge is $13.99. Everything would have been okay if the food was good.  But I am not paying $13.99 for this buffer.  Totally not worth it."}
{"text":"I am a vegetarian and so I got to try only the veg items in the buffet.
We were the first to be there and the food was already cold. Looks like they served us the leftovers.

Being named Aachi South Indian Kitchen I expected their buffet to have an exotic South Indian spread and what did the buffet include ?? just a few cold idlies and a tasteless sambhar. I was served a burnt soggy masala dosa .I did not see any other south indian item. 

Pav Bhaji - The Pav was cold and the bhaji had too much masala but it was somewhat bearable.

Paneer Sabji - This sabji was creamy and  tasted decent.

Vegetable curry - A vegetable gravy which was also tasted decent. All the vegetables were cooked perfectly in the gravy.

Potato Curry - This a a dry dish and this was the best spicy dish they had. The potatoes and onions were fried  perfectly.

Dhal - It was simple and tasted good (the way it should be).

Veg biriyani - The rice was fried and it did not taste like biriyani but it was edible. It was sweet and they had used frozen vegetables.

Raitha - This was one dish which tasted really good. 

Desert/ Sweets - They had many.
sooji ka halwa - The sooji wasn't cooked. It had a raw taste.
Bombay halwa - It had no taste.
Rasmalai - Store bought brand was served.
Fruit custard -  This was also store bought mango pulp.
Rice Kheer - Totally Pathetic. I am still not able to figure out what it tasted like. 
Carrot Halwa - The halwa was dry, and bitter.
Gulab Jamun - My husband said it was decent.

They have an A LA CARTE menu  which serves many South indian items (so they claim). 
Overall I would never waste my money there again."}
{"text":"I am new to Phoenix. Tried this South Indian restaurant (as per the name) for dinner butordered North Indian food . Samosa and kadai paneer was awesome. Naan/roti was fresh. Dal tadka had homely touch (not very spicy).Overall I liked the food...."}
{"text":"I was there for lunch buffet recently and nothing great. Not sure I will return.

Pros:
1. Looks clean
2. Good variety
3. Seems like freshly cooked food

Cons:
1. Food is not tasty at all. The veg korma had a funky taste that I could not place.
2. Service at the table was lacking - our glasses were not filled and we were promised more crepes which never arrived."}
{"text":"Didn't look like much in the brown paper delivery bag, but WOW!  I think I have a new favorite Indian restaurant!  The lamb was delicious.  Be careful when ordering \"spicy\".  They mean spicy when they say spicy....Yahoooooo!"}
{"text":"I've never been to the restaurant yet, but I have ordered through Grub Hub with Aachi and their food is simply delicious. I usually get the samosas (just the right mix of spice and flavor, always perfectly cooked), garlic naan bread, which is always hot and buttery, and my favorite dish which is the Chicken Saag with basmati rice, which is always tender and flavorful. I finish off with a couple of the Gulab Jamun sweet dumplings and I'm happy."}
{"text":"We went last night with a group of 6 and shared many dishes- samosas, chicken curry, spicy masala dosa, tikka masala, aloo ghobhi, tikka kabab, garlic naan, and a side of bhatura bread.  Extensive menu and hard to find dosas.   Raj, our hostess, was gracious and accommodating.  She helped with explaining differences in the curries and spice level.  We have eaten at many Indian restaurants as it is one of our favorite cuisines and we all were very pleased with each entrée.  As the other reviews complained of slow service, we did not have any issue with such. The food came out in several batches but that is expected as it takes time to prepare meals and we had many orders.  Each dish came out hot and fresh.  My sons are big tikka masala fans and both of them were very glad they each ordered it.  We all agreed we would order the same entrees again but with the many menu options, we will have to try others in the future. Looking forward to a return visit and trying the naan stuffed with chili and another dosa."}
{"text":"Great place to have buffet. Nice ambiance, service is great, the food was awesome. I used to get to-go-buffet! The price is average. Would love to come back again!"}
{"text":"Given a choice I would give zero starts for this.We had veg Manchurian,chole bhatura,unlimited dosa($14) and fried rice.other than the fried rice everything was very very low quality and taste. The dosa was not even cooked and had a stale taste to it.They served sambhar and coconut chutney which smelled like coconut oil and was as cold as a ice cream. Had an uttapam and there was batter on the veggies. Im the end when we paid the bill and were giving the feedback,the chef came out of the restaurant and started yelling and began to insult us saying are u expecting the food to be free and all nonsense. He was literally shouting at us. Very bad customer service.I sincerely request people to abandoned this place ,you will end up saving you money and not ruining your weekend. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Bad food... sabji was too runny and tasted like just bunch of masalas thrown together"}
{"text":"Wish I had found this place sooner. Love the fact the buffet is only $7.99, even if you decide to get it to go instead of dine in...great for those of us who only get a 30-minute lunch! Good Indian food is hard to come by in Arizona and this place is pretty darn good. The owner is friendly and realizes a lot of her clients are Americans who are not familiar with this type of cuisine and takes the time to explain what the dishes are. Top off the cultural experience by watching some Bollywood on the many big screen TV's. Worth a try!"}
{"text":"Decor and cleanliness - Appealing decor not over done. Nice and clean.
Food - We ordered the Gobi Mancurian for appetizers. Presentation was nice and it tasted great. We ordered the Masala Dosa and the Spicy Masala Dosa. The flavors were good. The chutnies were very tasty, the sambar needed a little more flavor and they could have added a little more potato filling in the dosas. The dosas were a little too crispy for our taste.
All in all a great experience. We are planning to go back when we are in the area."}
{"text":"The food here was amazing. Good taste and good service. One of best indian place to eat food in Tempe"}
{"text":"Had been there for a lunch buffet and the food was not good at all. Most of the items were diluted and food tasted horrible. Hopefully the owner improves the food quality."}
{"text":"EXCELLENT food and restaurant. LOVE this place. Best Indian food in town. Buffet everyday and also ordering from the menu, you won't go wrong. Nice atmosphere and the best customer service!  Check it out.  I give it 5 stars."}
{"text":"I think this place was awesome. It was my first time trying Indian food (besides Gulab Jamun) and wow! The Butter Chicken was fantastic. My friends all knew what was what, so they helped me pick. The service was great. A little slow bringing me my hot tea but it's ok, still a 5 star experience. I live in west Phoenix but I definitely believe it's worth the drive. Thank you!!"}
{"text":"I tried this place on a friend's recommendation. Egg biriyani is exquisite here and probably the best I had in Tempe. They have the great Indian buffet which had so many varieties in both veggies and chicken. I loved it and will come back with my friends!"}
{"text":"Honestly, dont bother. I was really in the mood for Indian since its been a while and it is one of my favorite cuisines. I ordered the food for pickup as I believed it would be faster and a better chance of being warm. Well, it was warm because it took them 40 minutes to make it once I placed the order. I was not really mad as I understand it takes a bit to make a good dish. That was, until I got home and tried it.

I got the Chicken Kurma and asked for it to be 'spicy'. What I got was a couple chunks of chicken in what I can only described as a brown soup that was neither spicy nor flavorful. This was paired with rice that had no flavor to it and was very dry. 

I have a special place in my heart for naan. Well, good naan. They do not have good naan here. I can only guess that what I got originally came out of a frozen bag and was thrown into a microwave as an afterthought. It was flat, luke warm, and had no signs of ever being baked other than a couple brown spots on it. Well, I hope that they were signs of it once being baked. It tasted more like the crust of those pizza squares we used to get in school lunches than any naan I have ever had. 

My advice: Skip this place and get one of the frozen dishes at a higher end grocery store with the naan in a bag. You will save your self some money and your taste buds some grief."}
{"text":"Love the food here, I have been to several Indian buffets here in tempe and mesa, but my all time favorite is Aachi restaurant. The reason is because they have more varieties in buffet and it keeps changing, it does not stick to one set menu...they have more varieties for vegetarian as well as non veg, two kinds of Biriyani etc. I recently started using their new service which is called \"Dhaba\" they give you a mixed meal for different prices which you can take to work or school. Check it out its legit."}
{"text":"The food were four stars and the service was done by the owner's son.  Since he is very young, there are some concerns on if he knows how to be a server.  He asked my friend if he wanted one order or two orders of an entree?  Most people here in the USA will RARELY order two or more entrees unless he is ordering for his entire family.  The food were very flavorful as I expected most high quality Indian restaurant here in the valley.  The problem comes when I presented the offer from Entertainment which give me one complimentary entree.  The owner immediately question the offer and said that she does not recognized the offer and called the number on the screen to verify.  Entertainment company had closed at that time but she said she will honor it this time but it still didn't reflect them on my check so we ended up paying full price for the our visit.  Please  BUSINESS 101..Don't promise your customer that you will do it but presented me with a check with full amount. You were friendly but certainly NOT your business practice.  I will write the Entertainment publication and see if you will get this resolved.  Please do not BAIT and SWITCH..You will earn a ZERO star if this happen to more customers."}
{"text":"Atmosphere had a few contradictions that are eerily common at Indian restaurants in the Phoenix area - at first the place seems newer and nice with newer floor tile, paint, and better than average plates on the table... yet, the walls by some of the tables have unrepaired damage, the napkins are paper, and the restrooms are subpar.   The glasses looked incredibly dirty but upon closer inspection it was just an abundance of scuff marks from the dishwasher.  Nonetheless, why serve them when they look so bad?  Most I saw were like this.  Why?  When you know how easy it would be to touch up the paint and such, it makes me fearful of what goes on in the kitchen that we can't see to critique.  Well there is one thing I could see in the kitchen, as I found it odd the kitchen staff at the door was wearing a colorful tank top \"beater\" as he rolled some dough right by the door.  Seriously?

Restaurant was empty except for one table.  So guess where the server/host decides to try and seat us?  Yes, immediately next to the one other table that happens to be occupied.  After this we also encountered a language barrier when ordering and it was confirmed when the food arrived.  Somehow he was under the impression I wanted TWO of an item and given the context, it was absurd.

Food was average and took quite awhile, given how empty the restaurant is.  Prices are in line with others, neither high nor low."}
