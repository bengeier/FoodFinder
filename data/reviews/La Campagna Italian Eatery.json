{"text":"Just had dinner here. We were near York U and so hungry so it was between this and the Turkish place 2 doors down. Both had good reviews but I am happy we came here because of the experience. It was one of the sweetest restaurant experiences ever. The owner was attentive and friendly from the moment we walked in. The prices in the eatin and takeout menu didn't differ so we got a 2 seater table but he urged us to take a larger table since it wasn't too busy. I ordered white zinfandel and it was reasonably priced. My bf ordered the wrong drink but they gave him the right one for free even though it was our mistake. The server was so super sweet. The food was delicious and ample. The cherry on top was the fact that two little boys, presumably the owner's sons were around to help and serve. It was so cute/precious! You really feel like you're supporting an authentic family business when you eat here -- and the food/service was absolutely remarkable. It's a simple place but the feeling was incredible! Support local restos! Thanks Yelp for helping us find this gem."}
{"text":"I have been in to eat here and ordered off uber eats, and never once have I been disappointed.

Dining in is very casual, but service is attentive and genuinely kind and friendly. I ordered the chicken parmigiana with penne a la vodka and my boyfriend ordered the veal parm with fettuccine alfredo. I am absolutely blown away by their chicken/beef parm. I haven't had one this good in years!! This is always our default order for uber eats as well, and if you're debating ordering from here believe me you won't be disappointed! While eating in we also ordered the mussels dish and a soup and we were super happy with both.

So glad this family business opened up and is doing well with the help of uber eats, will definitely be back/reorder!!"}
{"text":"My last review of La Campagna was in April 2014, making it a full year since I was last at the restaurant. I just want to note, that although I haven't been in a year, the staff recognized me and remembered me. The young lady remembered that I don't like bread with my meal, and the owner offered me a coffee and thanked me for coming back. WOW, I am impressed. My position on their food remains unchanged - it's delicious! I really think this is the best \"fast food\" money can buy, because I know everything is made fresh, in house and with love. 

Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"What great service. Treated us like \"la famila\". Highly recommended. Team Snow's private restaurant. Thank you so much for awesome experience.!"}
{"text":"Went to La Campagna today with my family which included my parents who are originally from Italy.  Eating at any Italian restaurant can be tricky since my mom's food is as authentic as it gets.   We had no idea what to expect other then reading positive reviews on yelp.   I am happy to say the experience was fantastic.  This is a family run business with the most friendly service and real home cooked Italian food.  The restaurant is very casual.  We had as shared appetizer the Bruschetta,  calamari and Greek salad and garlic bread.   For entres we had seafood pasta, mussels, steak and veal with pasta.  The portions were good and we all thoroughly enjoyed our meal.  We were all surprised at how reasonable our bill was.  All around very positive experience.  My parents we very happy and we all look forward to going back.  Definitely a gem to be discovered."}
{"text":"Homestyled Italian food, simple but tasty. The service was prompt and friendly. The pasta was hearty and the portion was a good value for the price paid. A plus is that they also have a tv with tsn on. Would visit here again for a quick lunch!"}
{"text":"Ordered the veal Parmesan with penne pasta on the side off of uber eats. The food was tasty and flavorful. They also included garlic bread on the side. I would definetly order from this restaurant again. Read as 4 1/2 stars."}
{"text":"I don't know if this is a Yelp thing or a La Campagna thing but they/you are closed on Sunday but they/you indicate you are open. Specifically searched under now open. If you'd like to attract new customers don't waste people's time."}
{"text":"I delivered from Uber eats and was disappointing. The fries were gross, the sandwich was any typical sandwich you can find elsewhere (but this was $13)!! The Brucshetta was just gross, I have had in multiple other restaurants and they were better there. And the cake was just dry and lacked flavour. My advice: Don't spend your money here!"}
{"text":"Great food, friendly staff, great service. Impressed with their ability to resolve customer complaints in a prompt and professional manner. Will be a repeat customer."}
{"text":"Great pasta and attentive top notch customer service.  Maria and owner Luciano were already taking excellent care of another group before we got in and the celebratory mood set up the welcoming atmosphere just right for a perfect dinner service (can you say chilled grappa shots and red velvet cake!) 

Was delighted to discover the store had just got their LLBO 2 weeks prior so several white wines and zinfandels were available by the glass/bottle as well as a full bar and cocktails.  I got the pina colada to bring those warm beach memories back. 

We were starving and I ordered the soup of the day with beans in an almost creamy tomato base stock -  soooo super-satisfying. The bruschetta was good as well.  My friend's lasagna was very tasty and well-prepared and my spaghetti and meatballs were everything I imagined a great meatball to be and more.  The complimentary garlic bread Maria offered to us for our first visit was certainly an added bonus.  It was great bread! 

Unfortunately the cannolis are only made fresh during the week so we could not take that to go this time but I did take the nice light tiramisu and my friend took the red velvet cake we overheard the other table oohing and awing about LOL.  I have to admit it did taste very good with some sort of cream cheese icing. They have homemade creme caramel for those who prefer it. 

Highly recommended for a nice mid-size group dinner or date night. They also have a hot table lunch special weekdays 11-3pm that offers freshly made lasagna, meatballs, and other hot dishes. I look forward to trying that one day. Great to have this place nearby,  congrats on being open for a year. 

FYI : Dress is casual. Brightly lit small restaurant. Accepts debit and offers limited amount for cashback."}
{"text":"How good is this place?  We come to Canada once or twice per year for hockey and always make it a priority to eat here.  

Why?

Amazing service.  The two gentlemen often take your order.  Super friendly and attentive.  And they even remember us despite not seeing us often.

The food portions are generous and delicious.  It all is super hot and so tasty.  I'm tastes incredibly fresh.

The prices are very reasonable...some might argue too low!  Shhhh!

Some of our favorites...garlic bread, Cesar salad (best we have ever had), chicken parmesan, fettuccine Alfredo, penne Bolognese, and vokda penne.   

After living in a dozen cities and travelling extensively...we can say this is our favorite italian food anywhere!"}
{"text":"Lunch here was an unexpected highlight of our Toronto trip. My wife and I both had chicken Caesar and we both thought it was the best chicken Caesar we have ever had. The dressing is made in house and we wish we could buy it by the jar. Garlic bread was perfectly toasted and flavorful. Cappuccino was reminiscent of coffee I had in Italy. My wife loved the Americano I highly recommend."}
{"text":"4.5 stars. A friend and I had dinner here last night (Friday night) at 6:30pm. It wasn't busy at all and when we walked in, we weren't all that impressed with the atmosphere or d√©cor. However, this cozy family run Italian restaurant had super friendly service and amazing food! Who better to cook Italian food than Italian people? My friend ordered the chicken salad and I ordered the spaghetti & meatballs. Portion sizes are huge! Food is fresh. Chicken was cooked perfectly. Pasta was cooked perfectly, meatballs and sauce were nicely flavoured. Served with a basket of soft, fluffy garlic bread. We conversed with the owner/chef and he is so nice and humble trying to make a decent living and making great food doing so! Their most busiest time is during lunch because they are surrounded with all the businesses around. Definitely coming back here to try other things on the menu."}
{"text":"La Campagna is located in a small plaza at the intersection of Norfinch and Steeles. My mom and I came on a Saturday afternoon, and it's small-ish. It's not well known (yet), but to be fair they are a recent establishment. We ordered calamari and pasta with meat sauce. Both were very tasty and just enough portion-wise. I recommend this if you're ever in the area and have a hankering for great Italian food :)"}
{"text":"We were on a shopping expedition and one of us was having hunger pangs.  As it was about 4 in in the afternoon, this place was empty when we stopped.  It is a modest, counter set-up type eatery which  evidently features a hot table at lunchtime as well.

Service was not fast, but there was only one person working and she had a lot to do with both minding the counter and cooking, so we have no complaints in that regard - she was very friendly.

But I must say, the meatball sandwich was one of the best I have had in many years and the chicken cutlet ordered by someone else in our party was fresh, tasty and delicious.  On top of which I am not quite sure where they got their espresso maker, but it turns out excellent first-rate cappuccino.

If you are shopping in the Vaughan area or work there, this is a highly recommended place for lunch, a snack, or a modestly priced quick dinner."}
{"text":"Great food! Great owner! I'm working nearby. Usually I bring my own lunch, but if one day I do not, the first option comes up to my mind for lunch would be this restaurant! Love the pasta and meat ball here."}
{"text":"I ordered food from here through UberEats. I found that the portion they gave you was more than fair. I ordered the pasta with meatballs which I found to hit the spot! I am definitely looking forward to dining here :) would 100% recommend this as a lunch option for work (the restaurant is available under UberEats) as you get a lot of food for a very reasonable price"}
{"text":"Mm mm delicious!! Their chicken Parm is to die for, you def will crave it. I am also a huge fan of their lasagna such a great price for the portion side. All their cake assortments are such a nice treat. - nothing on their menu has disappointment me yet!"}
{"text":"This place is so awesome, the pasta is so good and made quickly as you order right before your eyes. Pizza is made in that homestyle Italian way.  Homemade meatballs that are big and moist. You should eat here soon before this place gets very popular."}
