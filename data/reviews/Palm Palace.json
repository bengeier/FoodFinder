{"text":"This is a great place for carribean food! There is a variety of delicious meals. However, the wait time kinda long."}
{"text":"Really good food and great atmosphere. Had my aunts birthday party there and everyone had a good time and enjoyed the food. Ended up staying until later and it turned into a party. Definitely good times going there. Will be going back again soon."}
{"text":"I just ordered $70 worth of food from here, if I could give this place zero stars I would. My orders of fried chicken wings and chicken and broccoli arrived by delivery with a pungent ROTTEN stench. After tasting the food, it was clear that the meat was completely rancid. I called the restaurant to let them know my food was very stale, however when I spoke to the manager he was adamant that the food was okay to eat and resisted having the delivery driver to come back to my house and give me a refund. Overall, save yourself the money and possible food poisoning along with the trip to the hospital. Hopefully this place gets shut down soon before somebody seriously falls ill. Absolutely disgusting."}
{"text":"Place recently opened offering Caribbean West Indian Chinese food. Didn't expect the place to be so spacious with a modern look that has a great bar area and a pool table for entertainment, which is different from all the other restaurants in the plaza. Manu has variety of dishes that are appealing. I ordered the oxtail with rice and curry goat with roti. I know I must be crazy to order such dishes from a fusion restaurant with no review. But the oxtail was very flavourful with the meat falling off the bone. As for the curry goat, it was tender and juicy, not what I was expecting. With great service, food and atmosphere, will definitely be a regular at the restaurant."}
{"text":"The food is good there, but the waitress service is very poor, have been going there with my family for awhile now but the last time we went there it took about 10 minutes before someone finally came to our table, they were hanging around where the guys were drinking beers, we ordered pepper scrimp fried rice, they brought the regular scrimp fried rice and lied and say that is pepper scrimp, the people In front of us said they mix up their order. That is the last time we will go there, time to try the other place on Kennedy road."}
{"text":"when to it the day before my b-day the club was proper nuff trini gals and guyanse music was bomb reggae soca rnb hiphop i havent tryed the food ye but i will was a good time i will be going back soon 5 dollar cover charge not a bad thing"}
{"text":"Caribbean Chinese food. A great combination and generous portions to match. Service is not the best, however the food makes up for it."}
{"text":"Don't go to buy anything there if you have no cash. The guy at the counter was very rude. I have been to the square a few times always said that i will try the food. So the day I decided to go and try it i did not have any cash on me. To use your debit card you have to spend a minimum of twenty dollars. I am sorry but not going to spend that much when it is the first time you are going to try something."}
{"text":"The BAD reviews must be from the competition running scared!!!   Everything on the Menu is soooo tasty.    Very Reasonable Prices.   Keep up the good work guys.   We know that your food is GREATTTTT !!!!!"}
{"text":"I must say the food is good but this place is a joke it took me almost 20min to place a take out order dude behind the bar is feeding the waitresses drinks one of them look so wasted it wasn't even funny ...... it's a beautiful place but the people that are working there will run this place to the ground"}
{"text":"We live in a generation of complaining so if anything goes wrong people tend to think the worst of a place unless it is really that bad. The 3 one star reviews are a joke.   Anisha: Many businesses have a minimum amount to use a card and why?  It costs them more money  for a small transaction.  Cee: No delivery that I know of. I could be wrong but I doubt it.   Cee and Raj: Howcome you only have 1 review each and only for this place? LOL  Aside from that i've been to this place several times. It is in a crappy mall and surprising how nice this place looks. Nice ambiance. Service can be slow.  I've had their lunch special. Enough to feed two people. If my friend and I knew we would have ordered 1 plate!  I've done take out and no issues.  I like their pepper shrimps, fried wings and sweet and sour chicken. I have no real complaints. I'm giving it a 4 because of the overall experience going there time after time."}
