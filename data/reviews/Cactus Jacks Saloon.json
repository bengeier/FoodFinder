{"text":"This bar is AWESOME for a Las Vegas neighborhood bar. It's clean, roomy, doesn't smell like smoke. They have darts and golden tee. The bartenders have personalities bigger than the bar that is stocked with good liquor, cold shots and kick ass draft beer. See you there!"}
{"text":"The WORST service I've had in a long time and I'm patient. Snotty bartender, have to ask for a water or drinks, pushes you off on another employee, ignores you and then wants to act like she's working when the owner walks in. I've worked in hospitality for 8 years and this behavior is never satisfactory and should never be passed as okay. I will never come back here."}
{"text":"Really enjoy coming here for a beverage. Decent prices with great customer service. Shuffleboard, darts, Golden Tee and an arcade hunting game are there for your entertainment. In addition, the food is pretty good and also reasonably priced. I would recommend to others!"}
{"text":"Awesome local bar that needs more love (and the customers) it deserves. Multiple flat screen TV's, darts, golden tee, a friendly bar staff, a comfortable couch seating area opposite the bar... really, what more can you ask for? Besides coming just during the week, I watched the Super Bowl here and was so glad I did. Forget those over packed strip spots! If you are a local you know better.  As for the smoking... well, its Vegas, people smoke if they want to. I'm not a smoker, but for everyone that rates a place 1 star because god forbid someone lights up, you suck and mess up legitimate ratings :) Not saying that happened here, just saying in general haha  Additionally, they now have a \"Chicken Shack\" chef here. Great wings, try the habenero honey, wonderful sides including coleslaw... Delish. Food comes out quick. They had a new chef training and he made a mistake but quick service to fix it with a genuine sorry does wonders... and takes away no stars! You just don't get local service like this in many other places. If you are around the area definitely check out this watering hole."}
{"text":"Don't judge a book by its cover! Cactus Jack's Saloon is clean inside and staffed with wonderful friendly people! D the bartender makes a mean Bloody Mary and Mo 's pizza and Greek salad is something to write home about!"}
{"text":"Great local bar, love the menu and the bar tender is fast. I had the chicken it was cooked to perfection, the portions are generous and fresh. It's a definite must have.   The Long Island iced tea is good too.   Great spot to watch the super bowl!!!"}
{"text":"Let's start out with this is a great place to hang out, Noel is a great bartender and should receive more stars. My rating is on food and gaming.   The food service has gone done hill with Mama's in there. At one time the food quality was good. The gaming machines have a terrible payback."}
{"text":"The new menu was really good to check it out I Rick highly recommend it come on down and check it out"}
{"text":"Do they serve food?   I went once and had the BEST Jalapeño poppers.  I raved on about it and took my friends there to try that and the bbq.   They said they no longer have a chef.  I thought ok maybe Ill try back in a month.  Once again, no chef.  The bartender was great, but what exactly happened I'm not sure.  I only know that I called again and still no chef so I gave up.  I pointed out to them that there was a restaurant posters stapled to their building that said food, it was gone the next time I drove by.  Havent tried again since then."}
{"text":"Bar is great. Love the setting, love the drink selection. It has an independent restaurant which is pretty disappointing."}
{"text":"Great local bar & restaurant.  the bartenders are great & the bbq from Jessie Rae's BBQ is the best BBQ i've ever had. . you must try it..  The customer service is AWESOME. . I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PLACE. ."}
{"text":"Bartender is extremely rude. Called to inquire about food & when he answered the phone it was a gruff \"hello.\" I thought I had dialed the wrong #. I asked if this was Cactus Jack's Saloon & another gruff yes. We ended up going in to try the food & there's no waitstaff for the dining tables. You have to order your food yourself @ the bar or sit at the extremely smokey bar. Whole venue is smokey as you're hit in the face with the smoke when you enter. Friend that was with me is a smoker & she even commented how bad the smoke was. Ended up ordering a couple of beers at the bar after eating in the dining area & bartender was more interested in talking withe the regulars that he knew than taking care of customers waiting to order. And a Coors Light isn't cheap. $5 for a 16 oz glass that doesn't even get filled all the way. I used to tend bar & made sure to fill the glasses to the top even after the foam settled. Both of us ended up getting sick later that night with upset tummies. Beers tasted funny in the glasses so my guess is the soap wasn't washed out all the way. This is the 2nd time I've actually been to this place as original time was about 6 months prior for a networking function that was being held here. Same rudeness then as well. Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"Great place to grab a drink and play video poker.  The bartenders are great and Roger (the GM) is great for conversation.  Even better... I hear they just added a new menu to go along with the bar!  Great local joint"}
{"text":"This is the best bar in las vegas!  The bartenders are awesome and fantastic service....great selection of liquor.  (the only royal flushes I have ever won have been at this bar, good machines)."}
{"text":"The new BBQ is fantastic!!  Everything is fresh, and they know how to smoke and sauce good meat!"}
{"text":"Moved to the other side of town and one of the things I miss most is Cactus Jacks!!!  So many good, fun memories there.  I can honestly say I have never not had a good time while there!"}
{"text":"This review is for South Side Pizzeria which is located INSIDE Cactus Jacks. I live down the street and have ordered food from here multiple times since I moved here in Fall 2013. The food has always been delicious. I've ordered pizza and some of the philly cheesesteaks. This is my go-to delivery pizza in my neighborhood. Admittedly, I've never actually been inside Cactus Jacks."}
{"text":"casual atmosphere and friendly bartenders. We like the new menu that is more mediterranean."}
{"text":"This place has undergone some changes and it's seriously awesome now. It's got some great beers on tap. There's a menu of standard bar food you can order from - think fried foods and pizza. On this last visit, they were pumping R&B 90s music, which was awesome. They have Big Buck World, darts, and shuffleboard. It's not too dark inside. The decor is themed and fun to look at. It's not empty, but also not crowded, on weeknights. All in all, I am now a total fan. This is the perfect neighborhood bar."}
{"text":"This place is great! Bartender was friendly. They have shuffleboard and some other games too! Awesome neighborhood spot!"}
{"text":"I like this place because it is close to home and on my way home from work. Drinks are a little overpriced; what they need is a happy hour. Haven't tried the food yet but they were pretty nice when I asked for the hockey game to be put on the tv. Now the overpriced beer is one thing, but the other would be the inattentive staff. On a few occasions I have been sitting at the other end while a full on conversation is being had by the bartender with his buddies at the other end. He's just gotta take a look around more often. Besides that this is a decent place to hang for a bit."}
{"text":"Roger's one of the kindest, most genuine bar men you'll ever meet. I'll gladly drive a half hour to hang out here while I wait for the finest Chicago pizza I've ever seen (and this is coming from a pizzaholic New Yorker who visits Chicago as often as he can)."}
{"text":"If you need real Chicago style food in your life then this is the place.  The chefs name is Pizza Mike for a reason.  Incredible taste in a bar/casino/casual eatery setting.  Great food at a great price!!"}
{"text":"The service was good, the food was great and they had a couple of good craft brews on tap. Had the pulled pork and coleslaw sandwich, it was awesome and a huge portion. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Recommended by my buddy. From Chicago and have been here 15 years, this was the best thin crust sausage pizza so far. Got a sample taste of the Italian beef with au jus and tasted great. Just my opinion.  Bernie P"}
{"text":"Love to see Mike and staff at CJ's!  Garlic bites are addicting, and perfect while we waited for our deep dish.  All good!!"}
{"text":"Cactus Jacks is a super chill place to grab drinks with friends. The bartenders are super friendly, and the prices are great! Love Cactus Jacks :)"}
{"text":"Good food and cheap drinks are a perfect combination.  Great place to relax without having to make reservations or stand in line.  Stop by and you will see what I am talking about."}
{"text":"This bar is dirty, the bartenders are rude and the ownership doesn't care how the customers are treated. I'm a disabled veteran and was yelled at cussed at and refused service after winning a small amount of money. The bartender was extremely rude and after I confronted management they didn't seem to have a care in the world. I will never visit this place again. I hope all of my veteran brothers will avoid this bar and go to any one of the surrounding in the area."}
{"text":"Rude service. The bartender ignored us. We love Noel and \"Dog\"... But every time we go in when this bartender is in he's always a douchebag and ignores us. He's too busy playing Golden Tee with his buddies."}
{"text":"I live within walking distance of this place, but I never go. If you play on the machines, you lose money. If you pay outright for drinks, you pay way too much. They have great staff at the bar, but the separate kitchen is terrible and everything is overpriced. I guess I missed the $2 beers."}
{"text":"Only gave it one star because that's the lowest you can go. The food is unfit to eat. Bartender is an ass. Avoid this place!!!!"}
{"text":"Great bartenders and now have added food from pizza mikes and it is great!  Don't let the name Pizza Mikes fool you it is not just pizza it is a full dinner menu, shocking how many items and how good the food is!!!"}
{"text":"We really like this place,  its close to home and the people are really really nice, friendly and the prices are decent. Try the western pizza from the restaurant inside.  Super yummy with an interesting hand made dough. The portion sizes are enormous. A medium pizza fattened up me and my husband! I'm glad i finally found a great pizza place close to home,  thanks guys!"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised! We live across the parking lot and a menu was found in our door yesterday. A Chicago inspired menu at that! Being from Illinois we are curious as to if their food could measure up. We got 12 wings, a HUGE order of Chicago Style Fries, and 3 drinks a piece for less than $40! And It was delicious! Roger, the bartender, was hospitable and friendly. The restaurant owner, Pizza Mike, came out and had a great conversation with us and a few other patrons. Overall, exceeded our expectations. We will be returning again!"}
{"text":"Buffalo tenders were good.  Bartender was an absolute douche 6/20.  He was too worried about doing shots with his wanker buddies."}
{"text":"Went here specifically to play Buck Hunter and had an awesome time.  I've always driven by but never went in before.  The inside is really nice with big comfortable leather chairs.  There are all sorts of games.  The bartender was very friendly and fast.  There weren't a lot of people there, about 20 maybe, but we met some people who were friendly and fun.  When we are looking to hang out at a local spot, we'll be sure to go here more often!"}
{"text":"Bartender is an ass, nothing special as far as the bar goes. It's the closest one to my house and I won't be returning. There's still plenty of bars still less than 5 minutes away."}
{"text":"Such good food... suuuuch good food!   My husband and I had dinner here around 10ish on a Friday night. We were there purely for the food, so I don't know very much about what the bar is like. I'll be honest, we had, um, enhanced our palates, so to speak, beforehand... so my memory of the food might be a little better than it actually was. BUT... wow, what a great memory to have. Haha...  When you walk in, (the front door looked GIGANTIC to us), there are two doors inside: one that leads to the bar and the other to the dining area. I accidentally walked into the bar, and from what I remember, it looked liked kind of a loungey. No blasting music or dive bar here. Real grown-up stuff, with nice furniture and lighting and the whole nine. I prefer my bars a little rougher around the edges, but that's just personal preference, nothing to hold against the place.  So we corrected our mistake and went over to the dining area. It was the same general gist in decor, just better lit. We ordered a mixed appetizer plate with calamari, southwestern eggrolls, onion rings, french fries and stuffed potato skins. Our waitress asked us if we were sure we wanted to order more, to which we were both like, \"Hellz yeah!\" The question confused me at first though, until we got the appetizer plate. It was ENORMOUS; I honestly wasn't sure how we were going to fit it all in, even with the \"enhancement\" we had going on. (That's what she said.)  We had gotten through maybe about half of it when the rest of our order came. I had chicken stuffed with spinach, mushrooms and cheese over pasta with a creamy white wine sauce that came with choice of soup or salad; I got tomato soup. My husband had a pasta dish with a light red sauce and sausage, and French onion soup. I wish I could remember what the dishes were actually called, but it was so good, I actually felt bad about having ordered the appetizers because that I meant I had less room for my main entree.  Our waitress was super friendly and attentive, the food was delicious and generously portioned, and the leftovers were a sweet reminder of the place the next day.   Definitely, definitely check this place out."}
{"text":"They only serve poor tasting fried food and the service is so bad. The bartender was rude and ignored me. I simply needed food to go but he was too busy talking to his buddy and reading the paper."}
{"text":"I used to live right down Maryland Pkwy within walking distance.  Great Neighborhood bar to watch a game.  Service was always good.  Food was jus let so so.  Had a burger with fries.  Burger was average and fries were cold.  I have heard that the food has gotten better.  I would much rather come watch a game and gamble here than go to a PT's or some place like that.  And I usually had good luck on the machines!"}
{"text":"Great place to chill and hang out. The food is always delicious and the prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely the worst experience I've ever had. The food was extremely over priced and I literally wouldn't feed it to my dog. Cold, greasy, old ingredients, and the chicken tenders were undercooked. Please do yourself a favor and don't bother ordering food from this place."}
{"text":"Don't go there at night you might get robbed walking out . bartender called the cops and me out to be the bad guy ... Will not be back"}
{"text":"Wow what can I say...but GREAT PLACE!! All the bartenders are outstanding  exceptionally Deanne she's the best :-) :-)!!!  The best little community bar where everyone is so fun and nice. I definitely recommend stopping by. Plus the food is unbelievably tasty :-) :-)!!!"}
{"text":"Let's first talk about how amazing the service is here. I have only been to a couple places in my life where the service is this great. We were watching the Falcons game (only Falcons bar in town) and we were able to thoroughly enjoy the game without ever getting up. Great food as well. The fries are amazing! And I would like to consider myself a fry connoisseur.   I like the atmosphere here with the cozy bookshelf and comfy seating. Bartender Roger catered to us before we needed him. Our food was delivered by (didn't get his name) and was just as great.   Very pleased with this bar. We will come back!"}
{"text":"Great staff all around! Special shout out to Deanna  and Noll. Games are friendly to me at least!!"}
{"text":"This your topical get a few free drinks locals bar/ slot machine bar the bar tenders make great drinks and if you want to spend some time with Lady Luck this is a great place.   The bar is quite for the most part the machines seam fair, great bar food( the chicken wings are my fav) later in the night is alway not to busy.  For the best drinks tip your bartender good and up front, that way you don't find your self looking for a drink.  I gave it only 3 stars because that as much as I can give a local bar, but it's great for what it is."}
{"text":"I always thought this bar looked like a really cool place to have a drink. There's a PokéStop and Pokémon gym right outside. It is Tuesday morning, January 3rd 2017. My best friend went inside and asked to use the restroom and said she was going to buy a drink. She asked for a Bloody Mary and bartender named JB said he's not making that tonight. So she asked for a shot of Crown Apple and JB said you need to write to the owner about that because he doesn't have any of that in stock. JB made us feel extremely unwelcome and said he was nervous because we were parked out in front for a few minutes so he called security. We said we were just collecting a PokéStop and decided to check out this bar because it's in our neighborhood. JB said he called security because felt threatened by the car being parked outside with us two females. seriously?  So she offered to pay for the drink. JB said it's not necessary. My friend put $20 in the video poker machine and tried to tip him five dollars for the Jack and Coke that she really didn't want and he tossed it back at her. What kind of place is this? I will never, ever come to this bar and I will tell everyone that I know to never come to this bar! Stay away from this bar! Please stay away from this bar. And make sure you definitely don't do Pokémon near here even if you're in the bar. It's not a friendly bar. There are other progressive bars and restaurants that actually welcome people who play Pokémon, but this place does not! He threatened and said that he will call security for any reason. The bar was completely empty at 4:20 in the morning. wow!  To the owner, can you please get a bartender that will make a Bloody Mary and can you please order some Crown Apple, because he said to tell you. There are other bars that welcome people who play Pokémon and like to spend money and they will get the business.  Your bar is completely empty. You may want to think about your bartender."}
