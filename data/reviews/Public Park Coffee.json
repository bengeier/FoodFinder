{"text":"A true hidden gem tucked away on Morrison Street across from Roblott's hardware. Don't blink or you'll miss the chic entrance to this austere coffee shrine. Immaculate interior design evokes scenes of a Kubrick film, with uncompromising attention to detail. The tiny urban minimalist space offers equally committed views of concrete and cityscape, punctuated unapologetically by Toronto's iconic CN Tower. Public Park Coffee (abbreviated to Pub Prk Coffee) is singlemindedly focussed on coffee, and the result is as exceptional as the interior design. No WIFI, no washrooms, just coffee. The espresso, to my great relief, is quite simply perfect. Instantly became one of my favourite caf√©s in the city. If you're looking for a trendy, sleek, secret escape in which to contemplate truly great coffee, it doesn't get any better than this."}
{"text":"This is definitely the kind of place you accidently run into and I was glad I did. It was raining and I was on my way to Rotblotts' to grab some nails and screws and I came across this tiny cool coffee shop tucked behind the Livssil store on Adelaide and on the laneway that's shared with the parking lot behind Rotblotts'.  It a really cool modern and minimal space, with a small selection of coffee drinks and small pastries. The place could literally seat just a few people, but it had a nice cool and calming atmosphere. I had a machiatto which was well made and tasted really good. The person working there was really nice and really appreciated that I stopped by in the rain. He even offered me a complimentary biscotti, which was really good (it had nice hint of lemon and not too hard which I like) and something I will order when I'm back.     If you happen to be nearby (Brant Park is across the street), be sure to stop by if you want a nice calming place for a coffee break."}
{"text":"Public Park Coffee is located around Adelaide and Brant St where the entrance of the coffee shop is on Morrison St. The small shop is pretty hidden and can be easily missed. The entire place has a minimalist design, all white furniture and walls.   I stopped by for coffee on a Friday afternoon at around 5:30pm. Even though they close at 6pm, the staff was super friendly. They also gave me some free baked goodies as they were closing for the day. Great coffee and friendly service, would return!"}
