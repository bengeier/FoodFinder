{"text":"This place is no longer open and has been replaced with a new, different, vastly superior Asian buffet.  All the better since I got food poisoning at the old place.  Do NOT confuse the new place with this place!"}
{"text":"I read a review about Hong Kong Buffet and decided to go there although I wasn't familiar with the neighborhood.  The food was average but there was a large variety from sushi and appetizers to main course meat and desserts.  My only complaint was they put cold shrimp next to the desserts in the buffet line, making the desserts look very unappetizing."}
{"text":"Average buffet, good pricing. General Tso is not hot enough. Lunch price is just over $7 and worth a trip for a quick good lunch. Sushi is fressh everytime."}
{"text":"The food was OK - typical fast food chinese fare, with some sushi and desserts, american food like fried chicken. Extremely popular and cheap (comparatively - 10.99 for a Sunday buffet with all you can eat seafood (crab legs, shrimp, mussels, clams).   However, it didn't seem the cleanest place, and while you were waiting in the buffet line the floors were pretty greasy. I just didn't get the best feeling and don't see myself going back ever."}
