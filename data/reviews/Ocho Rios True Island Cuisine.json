{"text":"A little restaurant that if you sneeze, you'll miss it. And if you miss it, you'll miss out on some of the best Jamaican Food in this part of the town. The Owner was friendly and polite. The atmosphere is chill, there is only one table if you would like to sit in. But that is quite alright, the other patrons that visit are friendly too. Its right across the street from a Barber Shop, and a light south of the Junior High School if you are driving down from Euclid on Ivanhoe heading to St. Clair. 

Now to the Food: The Portions are huge and tasty. I got a Medium Curry Chicken and that was enough to food 2 people with. I'm scared to see how big a Large is. The Rice was cook perfectly. The Chicken was tender, and not dry at all. The Curry sauce was delicious. The meal comes with a cute little bread roll/ball. The restaurant does not have a take-out menu. All the menu offerings are on a clearly labeled board right above the ordering window. Now if the Curry Chicken was fantastic, I can pretty much guarantee the rest of the food is going to be fantastic as well.  

The only issue that I ran into was its Cash Only, but there is a ATM at the Gas Station right down the street."}
{"text":"Great Jamaican food! And they have American food on their menu, such as: A variety of Philly Sandwiches, Steak Sandwiches, Fish Sandwiches, Burgers, Polish Boys, Wings, Seafood Dinners, Wing Dinnerand Breakfast items.

My favorite Jamaican dishes here are: the Steamed Jamaican Styled Fish, the Chicken Soup, Curry Chicken, Oxtails, Curry Shrimp, and Jerk Chicken. Additionally my favorite sides are their Cabbage and Rice-N-Peas."}
{"text":"A coworker went here for lunch so I ordered the curry chicken. The medium portion was enough for 2 meals, lunch and I took some home. The chicken was \"bits and pieces\" with lots of bones so I had to eat carefully, but it was tender and the curry sauce was great with medium spice. The rice, beans, cabbage, carrots, and potatoes it came with was delicious. The whole dish was a bit salty but I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Little place with one table - the world cup was flickering by on the tv and my friend and I basked in the menu scrawled above on the wall above the order counter. Goat Curry, Chicken Curry, Oxtail, Greens, Pepper Steak, Peanut Sip, etc. etc.

I opted for the goat curry - my friend the chicken and we brought oxtail home to his wife. We all loved it. The cinnamon bread thingy that came with the rice and beans was especially yummy. The greens were scrumptious.

Add friendly service and reasonable prices and this place is a keeper. I will be back."}
{"text":"Very delicious food and great customer service. This was my first visit, and I do plan to return! I ordered the medium oxtail dinner and it was soooo good! Like most others stated, the oxtails, cabbage, and rice and peas were generous proportions and well-seasoned. I am not from the neighborhood and it is a little scary at night but, I would go again at that late hour just to have this good food again. Bon Appetite!"}
{"text":"Good Jamaican food for Cleveland. Howevwr, horrible customer service! The owner seems like a good man, but the gentleman that works in the front is terrible, and has absolutely no customer service skills. While I'm used to Jamaican restaurants and their poor service, I will not drive 15 miles for this again!"}
{"text":"Thr best curty goat I've tried. Went somewhere else tpday becaise it was closer. Uuugh no comparison.. Although this other place was cleaner and more inviting. Ochos is tops foodwise. I sent several friends there and they luv it"}
{"text":"Let me first start by saying the food here is phenomenal. It was slightly hard to find but when I did it was such a soothing and clean environment. Jamaican music playing in the waiting area. The cooks are extremely polite. They have a lot of delicious Caribbean dishes but my go-to is the JERK chicken, yum yum yum it's served with rice and peas, cabbage and a dinner roll."}
{"text":"Umm Yeah.....this is GOOD stuff.  The other 2 Yelpers were spot on when reviewing this place.  The neighborhood is a bit sketchy and you place your order thru bullet proof glass, but the FOOD was fantastic!!

I ordered the medium portion of curry chicken (sizes are medium and large).  My entree came with rice/beans, cabbage and plantain bread ball which was delicious.  The curry chicken, consisted of a very generous portion of whole cut-up chicken with cubes of potato swimming in a delicious curry broth.  The rice and cabbage were delicious too.   Everything was well seasoned, generously portioned and freshly prepared.   I ordered the large portion of jerk chicken for my husband, the portion was huge!   The chicken was spicy, but oh so tasty.  I can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"I'm not going to lie, the food is good! However, if you're big on customer service, go elsewhere!! The wait time is ridiculous even if you call in. I called in an order today and was told 10 mins. I arrived and waited another 15-18 mins standing in line in this extremely hot restaurant. The older guy who tends to the food AND register ?... was not even acknowledging the 8 ppl in line waiting. After waiting forever, I received my order and it was WRONG!! they charged me an extra $2 for all veggies, no rice. Then literally gave me a pound of rice and peas and a tbsp of cabbage. I'm pissed to say the least !! I called back to complain and basically had to suggest my own remedy because the older guy (idk his name) is extremely incompetent and does not think it's proper customer service to admit to your mistake then compensate the customer in some way, for the great inconvenience. He blamed in on the young lady who took my call in order when in fact, I saw the ticket she wrote and she wrote my order correctly! A simple \"I apologize for the inconvenience, I can remake that for you if you'd like\" would've sufficed. That didn't happen. I will be finding another Jamaican restaurant in CLE!!"}
{"text":"Chef Brian does everything by hand with nothing left out at this unique Cleveland true island cuisine restaurant.  My trip to the Ocho Rios came after hearing it on the Art McKoy Radio Show Sundays on WERE Radio 5PM to 7PM.
    I ordered two fish dinners with all of the side dishes a plate could carry and enjoyed every thing the chef prepared.  
   One bad thing was that I failed to order a whole cake and not just slices because the three deserts I ordered were fantastic."}
{"text":"Disappointed that my meal was stuffed into a sandwich box! I don't care if my order was a small brown stewed chicken. Why throw everything ( meat, rice and cabbage all together in a sandwich box). I'm so pissed. This is the same box you place a slide of cake into and or a side item. Not a whole meal. This is totally unacceptable and will be my last time ordering."}
{"text":"so far, my favorite spot. good food. relatively fast service...not too far from the omega psi phi fraternity house on st. Clair."}
{"text":"My food was greasy and full of bones. On the flip side, my coworker had the jerk chicken and loved it."}
{"text":"BUYER BEWARE! 
If I could give 0 stars I would. I had heard this place had terrific food, and I haven't had oxtails in a minute, so I was looking forward to this order. First off I placed my order via UberEATS (to have it delivered to my home). I used a first time UberEats coupon to get $15 off my first purchase. So I place my order, and after about 5 minutes it is cancelled. I didn't want any extra requests, or outrages food requirements; and my total after the coupon was still nearly $12. I first thought it was close to closing  when I ordered and it was cancelled due to that....hmm nope! They close at 11pm and it was only 9:21pm. Very disappointed with this service!! I tried to call to clarify or even reorder, and the line rang busy each time. I then looked at other reviews on Yelp (which were nothing less than shocking), so now I will happily take my business elsewhere for the evening"}
{"text":"Long story short...was cravin good island food today in Cleveland area. Went to Country Style Jamaican Food.....I ordered Oxtail, but I was driving. I couldn't eat right away but my passenger started eating his and was not happy at all....and he can eat just about anything 

We went to the next nearest place....THIS PLACE. 

By his reaction and displeasure I ordered Oxtail...again...without ever opening my container from country style jamaican food...

I opened both at the same time..
Let the photos tell you the rest!!!

Left side Ocho
Right side Country style Jamaican food."}
{"text":"Proper, authentic Caribbean food in Cleveland? Yes, please! This place is a little hard to spot from the road due to not being very large and the sign not being very clear, but once you get past that and the more worn-down feel of the neighborhood around it, it's worth a trip. I got the jerk chicken, the chicken soup, and a bottle of Ting (which I haven't had since a trip to Antigua), and the food was perfectly seasoned and delicious. There was a fair amount of bone in the chicken, but the meat was tender and practically falling off, so that wasn't a problem. I'd suggest getting some additional sauce to put on the rice, though - my friend got the goat curry, and the sauce from that seemed to improve the rice.

I will say that they were out of some of their menu items (no other soups remaining, for example), but I'm not sure if that's due to those items being very popular or them just understocking for the day. One further caveat is that there's only one table (mostly because there's only space for one table), so this isn't an eat-in place."}
{"text":"This is the second time I've come here and been disappointed I don't even know why I gave him a second chance. This time the customer service was okay last time it was horrible the guy ruined my order and blame me and was angry with me I ended up getting my money back leaving! This time they prepared a Polish boy for me with no coleslaw and after the order was complete I was told that I could have cabbage on it instead I decline as I know that all polish boys can be only sold with coleslaw it's just not a Polish boy without coleslaw to me. Upon returning the police boy because I wasn't going to eat it without coleslaw. I asked if I could have a meat pie or something in place of it and was given one meat pie. I don't think I'll be back and it's sad because the food is good but the service is so bad that I don't want to go back"}
{"text":"go hard in the paint and they have boiled green banana and boiled dumpling i had the curry goat really good my only complaint is that i wish it was a little spicey. second place as for best jamaican spot in cleveland"}
{"text":"Love their Curry Chicken. This place is a 13 minute ride from my home. I was craving their food so badly one night I decided to leave out 10 minutes before their closing time (optimistic? I know). I called to see if they were closing on time and the guy told me he would wait for me to arrive :). I admit, the neighborhood is a bit spooky at night but it didn't stop me. 

When I arrived I placed my order no problem and happily waited. They can be a bit on the slow side. Depending on the number of people ordering food you can expect to wait 10-15 minutes before your order is ready. If ordering Curry Chicken, Ox Tails, Curry Goat, or anything else with \"gravy\" I would suggest ordering extra gravy on the side. I like the flavor of the gravy on my rice and peas and at times they don't put enough on the rice (for my liking). 

I have also tasted the Curry Shrimp, Jerk Chicken, Cheese Burger and Fries, and Banana Bread. The Jerk Chicken was average. I've had better honestly but it's good enough to try again. The Shrimp I received in the Shrimp Curry were small and chopped in half. I prefer much larger, whole pieces, of shrimp in my curry. It could be due to them practically running out of the dish when I ordered it, so I will order it again to check for consistency. The Cheeseburger and fries were actually pretty tasty. I would order it again. The banana bread was really sweet but not too bad tasting. 

Try this place. Let the Curry Chicken be your first go-to. You will NOT be disappointed. You get a very generous portion with all of their dishes."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic.  I've been to most of the Jamaican places around town, and this one is tough to beat.  Great portions, great seasoning, reasonable prices, friendly staff...that earns them four stars.  And, the food is fantastic.  Five stars.  

This evening I enjoyed the Kingfish and brought home the Beef Stew for lunch the next day.  Neither survived the evening.  The portions are substantial.  Your dish comes with a splendidly seasoned and well portioned main course and a well seasoned side of flavorful beans and rice, and a delicious side of cabbage.  

The Kingfish was well seasoned and delicious.  The Kingfish has a couple bones in it, but it adds to the flavor and they are easy to maneuver around.  The Beef Stew was tasty, moist and tender.  The gravy was flavorful and had just the right amount of salt and seasoning.  The stew had flavorful chunks of carrot and potato to compliment the tender bite sized chunks of tender stew beef.

I recommend this place 100%.  The staff is helpful, friendly and very welcoming.  I called them this evening to tell them their food was fantastic.  He replied, \"what did you have\", I told him.  He replied,  \"That is how we do it in here mon.\"

I will be back, mon."}
{"text":"I paid 18.50 for my food and I bought mac and cheese and it had ants in it.I will not be going back."}
