{"text":"Very good lunch here. Really enjoyed the lasagna and Veal Parmesan. Their marinara is very good."}
{"text":"We normally eat at location off S Tryon but this was convenient while shopping. I ordered a pasta with clam entr√©e. The clams were gritty and the sand had even made its way into the very salty sauce. My wife's lasagna was ok. I spoke to the manager and he was very combative so we decided to count our losses. The sandy gritty salty dish was waived and he mentioned \"he had to charge me for the salad which was included in my inedible dish\". I was shocked at his pettiness. We paid and vowed to eliminate their chain from our rotation. The meal was excused but the salad sealed the deal."}
{"text":"Heard good things about this place. All I can say is that this is a perfect candidate for Kitchen Nightmares. Bad service. Bad food. Only order pizza if you must eat here. 93 rating."}
{"text":"We were seated at the worst table this location has which is right in front of the kitchen door.  It was like a strobe light shining on our table as the wait staff ventured in and out of the kitchen. The food was served hot but was just ok in terms of flavor. The lasagna had to be the thinnest I have ever eaten and was just one layer thick.  Service was ok but nothing special. Don't envision going here again"}
{"text":"Update:  Chicken Marsala is excellent and if you want plenty to eat on the the calzone was very good.    Portafino is my go to Italian restaurant in the area."}
{"text":"Go! Only if you want the best pizza in town. Pasta dishes are tasty, too. We once had an inattentive server, but really everything else is boffo."}
{"text":"Fantastic!  Very cozy little italian place.  We were from out of town and took a chance on it and we were glad we did.  The best lasagna ever and excellent marinara sauce.  Great service and good wine!  Want to go back for lunch tomorrow!"}
{"text":"I can't comment on the quality of food or wait staff because we never got a table. We patiently waited for over an hour for a table for a party of 6. They were completely unwilling to make any accommodations for us even after such a long wait. We have never had such problems at the Ayrsley location."}
{"text":"Bad food for the price.  Specials suggested by our waiter were really bad.  Place and wine was ok.  I'm disgusted with the food they serve at this place.  I think the Restaurant Impossible should visit this place and fire the chef."}
{"text":"Poor customer service at the Arboretum location..I ordered Eggplant Parmesan to go, when I got home I find out it is Veal Parmesan. When I called to discuss with them, they basically said that is what I ordered, which is completely not true. I am a vegetarian.  Not one apology, he was actually a bit rude. Never again will we go here."}
{"text":"My goto pizza shop for take out and delivery. I've  ordered from many local pizza places over the years and Portofinos has always been the most consistent and best tasting."}
{"text":"Rude staff!! Super small portions!! I paid $17 for Zuppa de Pesce and there were 3 fork bites of linguini!! Do not recommend!"}
{"text":"we've been to portofino's for takeout at least 20 times over the years but finally decided to have a date night w/ the kids across the shopping center at an arts/crafts playdate... first time i've ever written the word playdate (sigh). to the point, we just ordered apps and wine - the antipasti was generous and fresh. the house dressing was phenomenal! my mussels marinara were equally as great - i've had these before but they've never been this good. the wines - as suggested by our server - were on point and matched our meals fantastically. thank you to portofino's for a great meal - we will be back."}
{"text":"This was the first time I've ever tried Portofino's and it will positively be my last. Upon entering, you are treated to a short, narrow \"hall\" and a desk where you can give your name to the greeter.   The very bored blonde teenager half way looked up from the paper and told me that our wait time would be 35- 45 minutes.  We found a small wine shop next door and decided to have a drink while we waited. After 2 glasses of wine and some lively conversations (about 45 minutes)  my husband walked back to the desk to find out how much longer it would be. He was promised that we were next in line.   About 20 minutes after that, I walked over to see what the issue was. I was told there was only one table that could handle a party of 6. Apparently they didn't take advantage of those math classes where you learn a table that seats 2 could be moved next to a table of 4 to accommodate a parry of 6.  After this totally crazy response, I asked to speak to the manager. When he finally realized I wasn't going anywhere without talking to him, he hung up from his fake phone call and addressed me. I explained what happened,  adding that there were several tables open that could be put together to serve our group. He acted like he had never heard of this thing called accommodating customers. Hmmm. Must be something he's allergic to.  Anyway,  after there wasn't any kind of apologies made, I walked out, head still on fire. My group walked down the street about 200 feet to another restaurant,  Bella Frescos and had a perfect dinner. Should have started there. Then I wouldn't have left a trail of burnt hair."}
{"text":"If you don't want to read a story: go anywhere else if you value your hard-earned money- this was the most disappointing expense of $70 I have had in recent memory- and I frequently Amazon Prime while drunk.  Portofino's disappointed me in a way I haven't been disappointed by a restaurant in a very long time. I enjoy a 'greasy spoon'-styled restaurant/diner of any kind- there's a time and a place for a big, crazy burger and huge plate of fries or onion rings and I love the brusque service of a mom-and-pop joint that puts out great food. I want my servers at places like that to not come and think \"What else could he want?\" with confidence, and know my answer would be \"Nothing, this is everything I was looking for.\"   What I didn't expect when visiting Portofino's was a verbatim translation of that to a low-tier Italian restaurant, and it frankly will ensure I never recommend this location to anyone.  The positives:   A Sangiovese-Cab blend I wanted with the meal was sold out, the bartender (via our server) recommended a substitute Super-Tuscan at an identical price point. It was at perfect temperature and opened up flawlessly for exactly what I was looking for from the bottle I earlier preferred. This restaurant does not employ a sommelier, but this was the mark of a bartender who knows their wine. I come from a wine sales background and have a very solid understanding of my regions and grapes, so for the recommendation to be this close to what I was seeking told me very good things. The wine turned out to be perfect- and the only redeeming factor of a $70 dinner.  The hostesses were keen to seating us quickly during the dinner rush and I noticed their attentiveness to leap to action in seating larger groups by merging tables and adjusting seating with lightning-speed.   The house salad dressing is good. Not the salad- but the dressing. Their angel hair pasta is good.  The cons?:  The atmosphere was unfortunate. After waiting 7 minutes for our table, my girlfriend and I were seated in the most poorly positioned and tiny table in the building- ensuring we would be passed on both sides by staff moving food into the dining room and outside. With a sizable table this is a non-issue, but given the large plates and unnecessary accoutrements stationed on the table, along with our order of a bottle of wine, two glasses, the oversized menus, a poorly spaced wine list that could be a single page in lieu of a bound book- we were already struggling to properly apportion the table before those items arrived. This table simply should not exist in the workflow of the restaurant, it serves strictly to increase total head count by two. I understand during a busy dinner rush as it's more important to put the people in their seats than to have them milling about in the lobby, but other 4-seat tables were filled by groups of two against a wall in lieu of being in direct egress of the kitchen and dining room. I was left with the impression I was expected to be in and out as quickly as possible and simply 'filling a seat' versus 'dining in their restaurant'.  Service was just poor. It spoke volumes that the most attentive member of the staff to my girlfriend and I was a young man who was not our server, nor anyone's server, and may have been a busboy that ensured we finally received attention from a server after waiting at our new table for the better part of 10 minutes. Our server was conversational and friendly, but hardly attentive- we spoke with her exactly 5 times, two of which were her ensuring we had left a card for payment while we finished our wine. After relocating from our anemic and uncomfortable table indoors to one outside (a request which was met by a brusque departure and no further attention for a further 10 minutes after being re-seated by the hostesses) we placed our orders with hope the food would speak for itself.  50 minutes after walking in, our salads were weak, supported only by the heft of their dressings. My veal marsala was utterly mushy- it had the texture of a McDonald's burger patty and no crust or browning to speak of with perhaps the most egregious error being the literal pool of red/brown grease it and my pasta sat in that tasted nothing of marsala wine and broth as it should, but instead of the remnants of boiling a veal cutlet in butter and lard poured onto a plate, as I suspect was what happened. Seasoning was nonexistent, and this dish was very much inedible, as I have developed an unfortunate case of acid reflux since. My girlfriend's tortellini alfredo reminded us of a bagged pasta we had purchased on sale at the grocery store months before doused in a wimpy saucing that had nothing to offer for texture or depth.  After leaving significant amounts of food on the plates, the best part of our meal was the wine and a busboy's attentiveness. Yelp describes a one-star as 'Eek! Methinks not.' Yep, sounds spot-on. At least Amazon sends things promptly and as I expected them to arrive."}
{"text":"Average food at best, got carryout. Food was hot, just lacked flavor...we had the chicken parm and the chicken cacciatori. Lots of cheese, sauce and food, but not appetizing. The bread was terrible...bland, dry, not a quality texture. Just another \"italian\" place with nothing to write home about; I will not be going back!"}
{"text":"Its better to go before 6 when it's not to crowded.....service was very good from our server Jeff. He recommended the Chicken Portofino and so do I. Fantastic meal...just enough to fill you up."}
{"text":"After hearing good things about Portofinos for a while, I finally went last night with a group of friends.  Luckily, we went family-style, so we ordered a number of items from the menu - all amazing.  From the get-go, we were super hungry, so we ordered the Fiorentina pizza for an appetizer while we contemplated the rest of the (huge) menu.  I guess I didn't realize just how large 16\" is (there's a joke in there somewhere), but I was surprised by how big the pie was when it came out; the 6 of us dug in.  The flavor was a perfect meld of hot, cheesey, pesto-y goodness.  We then also ordered the chicken parmigiana, pasta sorrento, and pasta alla panna.  I know a lot of other Yelpers have said the chicken parm was their favorite, and while it was very good, I think the other dishes were incredible.  The pasta sauces were light but packed immense flavor and left me wanting 2nd servings, even though I was stuffed.  And we got the house white (pinot grigio) and house red (pinot noir), which were both very drinkable for $25.    The location (strip mall behind the Harris Teeter) leaves something to be desired, but once inside, you feel the love and atmosphere of Italy.  Our waitstaff was very attentive, and our server did an amazing job of splitting checks (no easy feat with bottles of wine, one pregnant lady, and someone else ordering a healthy salad on their own).  I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"We went with the large Margarita pizza...delicious. Thin crust was crispy. Mozzarella  cheese was fresh on the capresse appetizer but we missed the sweet balsamic glaze. Our waitress was very attentive and courteous with us. Definitely passing by again."}
{"text":"This should be your go-to spot if you like old school, NYC Italiian...heavy on the garlic....heavy on the red sauce...etc. Let me start with their pizzas - while others have surpassed their pies (most recently Luigi's), these guys were doing authentic NY pizza before anyone else in Charlotte - great crust...better the next day!!! Their calzones are humongous, and I would put their Sicilian pie up against anyone elses...try a Sicilian with no-cheese (or 1/2 without cheese if you're hell bent on it having it on there) with mushrooms and/or pepperoni....they'll add some fresh basil to it, and it's reminiscent of tomato pie/pizza bread from northern bakeries if you guys know what I'm talking about.   Their fried calamari is perfectly fried w/ marinara sauce and some hot bread to go along with it. Their bread is awesome btw...so good that I'd buy some standalone!! I'm partial to the casalinga pasta dish which is red sauce, peas and veal chunks....traditional spaghetti and meatballs is also good. ALERT - their sandwiches might be the best in town...the best cheesesteaks, the best hot Italian sub, the beast meatball marinara, the best veal/chicken parm....MADON!!!!! I'm pulling a homer and drooling as I type. 9 times out of 10 I get it to go - and actually prefer the Eastway shopping center location (I swear their prices are cheapr, but they have the same takeout menu so it can't be true). No one is claiming this to be the best upscale Italian restaurant in town...but it fits the bill perfectly for the aforementioned NY style Italian-American comfort food."}
{"text":"Extremely poor service..server gave us a lot of attitude. Charged us 5$ for adding a pesto sauce..ridiculous"}
{"text":"I was thinking, Italian food down south? But let me tell you. One of the best lasagna dishes I have tasted. And the shrimp parm was also great. Shrimp wasn't smothered in mozzarella but each piece was covered just enough with it. And was delicious. Service was also great for a busy Sunday night. They have outdoor seating."}
{"text":"Having just moved to Charlotte, my husband and I knew that one of our first orders of business would be to find a solid family Italian restaurant. We both grew up in the Northeast, but have spent the past 4 years in Texas, and have really missed having a great standby Italian place.  We arrived around 6:30 on a Tuesday and were promptly seated. After looking at the extensive menu for a  bit, we ordered the Hot Antipasto for 2, I selected the Chicken Parmesan and my husband picked the Veal Saltimbucca, both entrees came with a choice of capellini or soup and a house salad. We both selected the capellini and salad with house dressing (I'd read a few other Yelp reviews that said the house dressing is the way to go - it was great!) I'm not sure exactly how to describe the dressing - it came out looking like Thousand Island - but tasted more like a creamy Italian with basil and garlic.  The Hot Antipasto arrived with 2 baked clams/clams casino, a generous pile of mussels, two delicious breaded shrimp, 2 stuffed mushrooms, and 2 eggplants rollatinis. The eggplant, shrimp and mussels were my favorite. The stuffed mushrooms weren't exactly what I was expected, just seemed to be mushrooms filled with ricotta cheese - but good nonetheless.  The salads promptly followed the appetizer and we both enjoyed the house dressing, as well as the salad, which included green olives, cucumbers, carrots, red onion and lettuce.  The entrees came out and were HUGE, my chicken was at least the size of my head. I don't eat veal so I can't comment on how the Veal Saltimbucca tasted, but \"wow\" and \"tastes like home\" were both uttered by my husband, so I think it was a big hit! I think Chicken Parm is a good dish to gauge an Italian restaurant from, and they did a great job. I think the chicken could have been a little thinner, but all in all it was a great meal, and it's always nice to leave with enough leftovers to make another meal out of it.  We'll be back for sure! They have a lot of really interesting dishes that I look forward to trying."}
{"text":"This is the first time I have been to Portofinos and I had an excellent experience.  Our waitress was very attentive, giving suggestions on dishes for my vegetarian friend and also allowing us to change any dish to suit our needs.  The portions were huge and the food was delicious."}
{"text":"Love Portofino's great food and good size portions"}
{"text":"We went here for lunch the other day.  It was busy, and seemed like a lot of business people came here for lunch. I took that as a good sign, since they chose to come to Portofino's over several good options pretty close by.  Unfortunately, I don't agree with their choice.  Our waiter was friendly enough, kind of a low talker, but otherwise the service was fine. We had the buffalo mozzarella and tomatoes for an appetizer.  It was good, though I would have real issues with a restaurant that could mess THAT up.  For lunch, I ordered the Ravioli special, my husband had a chicken parmesan sub and my mom-in-law had a salad with salmon and their house dressing.    My meal bordered on gross.  It looked like they had taken all of the different ravioli left over from dinner the night before, put them on a plate, then smothered them in a creamy basil sauce with way too many olives and roasted red peppers, so that they were unrecognizable.  There was way too much going on on that plate.  I like all of the things separately, but together, none of the flavors were distinguishable when it was all together.  There were heart-shaped mushroom ravioli, huge round meat-pie ravioli, smaller round cheese ravioli, and square sausage ravioli.  Doesn't that sound like whatever they had left over was what went on the plate?  The sauce was really gross looking: vomit-like in color and texture.    The salad looked fresh, and got reviews of \"good.\"  Jim's sandwich was good as well, though he said he would get something else next time.  The table next to us ordered pizza, which looked good.  I'll probably try that if we go back.  The other thing about Portofino's that I didn't like, was the noise level.  Normally in a restaurant, even a busy one, I can concentrate on our conversation and not hear others (unless I was trying :) ).  But this was a very loud lunchtime service, so I wouldn't recommend going there for a business meeting that you would like to pay attention to, or an intimate lunchtime date."}
{"text":"We had the Antipasto Italiano and it was amazing! I will be dreaming about this meal for awhile!"}
{"text":"Visiting from NY and these reviews made me want to try this place. Glad I did! Went on a Sunday evening around 7:30-8pm. Got seated right away. Our waiter was very polite and courteous (actually, I've noticed EVERYONE in Charlotte is so friendly and polite compared to NYers!). The food was GREAT with big pasta portions and the pricing is very fair. Would definitely go again if I ever came back to Charlotte."}
{"text":"Very rude and terrible customer service!!!! I ordered the special of two gyros and one of of fries but instead of the regular gyros I wanted chicken gyros, as I do not eat lamb. My order was delivered and they delivered the regular lamb gyros. I called back to let them know the mix up and the guy who answered the phone proceeded to tell me that I did not order chicken gyros, and as I tried to explain to him that could not be possible as I do not eat lamb, he proceeded to talk over me and tell me he's worked there for such n such years and would not make that mistake. He then proceeded to tell me he was not going to argue with, but I was not able to get a word in. He was so rude and I will not be spending my money there again. I've never dealt with customer service like this. He didn't try to apologize or offer anything for the inconvenience. He told me to send the old gyros back but I would have to wait another 45min.  To top it off I ended up taking the gyros back myself. No apology for my inconvenience and the guy still wanted to charge me for a side order of fries. Never will I order from here nor will I recommend to anyone. No one deserves to be talked to that way when they're spending their money!"}
{"text":"I really do love this place. Of all the places I have been to Charlotte I think this is my favorite. The staff is so nice and professional. Especially Woody he is our favorite waiter. They always make sure drinks are filled and we have enough bread. I have never felt rushed and the portions are big for the prices. I also love the outdoor patio so nice come spring to sit outside and enjoy a pizza! We took friends here last memorial day and they are still talking about how they want to go again when they are back in town!"}
{"text":"We came here on New Years Eve with some old friends - looking forward to some great Italian food. We left a little disappointed.  We started with some appetizers - the calamari was awesome, and the kids liked the mozzarella sticks. The hot antipasti for two was good, with the exception of the mussels (maybe just a preference of mine). We ordered two platters for seven of us and it was more than enough.  Dinner is where the struggles came.  Special tonight - lobster tail with scallops in a scampi sauce over linguini - who could resist it? We ordered two of them. Also ordered chicken parm, shrimp scampi, osco buco, chicken francaise (not on the menu but they said they make it) and a side of linguini and clams.   I'll start by saying our food came out before they started clearing our appetizers and salad, and there was stuff everywhere, stacked and ready to tip over.   The chicken parm did not disappoint, the guys loved it and the portions were very large. And the Osco buco was so tender and flavorful. Really special.  The lobster tails were so over cooked and tough that we could not get the meat out of the shell. And two of us ordered the same meal, one of us got five scallops and the other one (me) got 3.  We told our waiter  when he came back about the lobster and he said either give me your whole plate and order something else, or keep it. He did say it wasn't him it was his manager, but \"say what\"? We said can't we just keep the plate and you bring new lobster tails. He came back and said all he could do was take $10 off each plate. Ok we said. So much for lobster tonight.  The chicken francaise was COVERED in mushrooms. If you like them, that's awesome. If you don't, and don't expect them, it kind of ruins the meal. When we asked, the waiter said they always serve mushrooms with their francaise (never seen that before but ok) so my daughter took them off. She ordered gnocchi on the side but it was a bit doughy.  The pizza we ordered for our 3 year old came our about ten minutes after our food, we can only assume the forgot the first time around.  Drink refills were slow, again I assume because it was busy.  All in all we will go back, but thought the review was fair."}
{"text":"This is the best pizza in Charlotte,  hands down.  The pasta is awesome too. If you get a salad, the house dressing is very good.  Delicious!"}
{"text":"I've lived in south Charlotte for several years and finally decided to give this place a try. There was a short wait but it was well worth it. I was craving pasta and went with the chicken parm with the confirmation from our server Alex that I wouldn't be disappointed - wow, was it delicious! It was a large serving of food that is great warmed up as leftovers. The staff were also very kind and accommodating. Our server, Alex, gave us some great recommendations throughout the meal and once noticed the ice in my cup was low so brought me more ice (unprompted) - amazing service! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Good food but not as good  as their other locations. Someone needs to manage the service. Three bad experiences with poor service."}
{"text":"Close by work - Excellent lunch stop and GREAT for work related take out (so the gang will work weekends for this food!).  Pizza is always excellent and all the Italian standards are great.  I just tried a Seared Tuna (kind of Asian) with balsamic reduction, nice greens and GREAT bruschetta today at lunch.  Unexpected here but VERY GOOD stuff."}
{"text":"Horrible service.. I wouldn't recommend portofinos at Arboretum. Server Daria was extremely rude. She charged us double the amount from menu,when we asked her why ?she said because of the  spicy sauce, I should be paying 8$extra for each dish. Food was salty and not even close to any average italian restaurant."}
{"text":"I do not know what others have seen in this place to give it a four star rating. The wine was good, but that where it stops. My wife and I tried Portofinos at the Arboretum for the first time tonight. We ordered Bruschetta as an appetizer, average at best...Strike one. Our dinners came with a side salad. There were green olives (not black) on my salad. Really? An Italian restaurant using green olives on a salad? And the Balsamic vinegarette was    Like pure vinegar! Strike two. I ordered Chicken Tarantino, bland and over cooked, my wife ordered lasagna, tomato sauce tasted like chef boyardee... Strike three! I cannot recommend this restaurant to anyone who wishes to enjoy their meal!"}
{"text":"I come here's few times a month & normally have the same dish. It's the Boscaiola (prosciutto, fresh peas in a creamy pink sauce) I like the garlic bread app as well. I order both with no parsley - every time. Until last night, the order was always right.      When I got home, I opened the lid to the pasta - parsley...not as much as what was on the garlic bread, but noticeable. The garlic bread was covered in it. I called today and spoke with the manager Geosh/Josh. I explained what happened and he said come on in and they would take care of it.      I went in tonight, spoke to him & he said \"oh yeah, I remember the garlic bread. It had a lot of parsley on it.\".... Really? So you were still going to send it out? And he insisted he hadn't put any parsley in the dish. It looked as though the dish had been made and whomever expedited the dish put some on it, saw the mistake, brushed what they could off, flipped the pasta upside down and added parm to cover it up.         If I was the owner, I would be embarrassed at what transpired. They charged me $7.59...& I got no garlic bread. REALLY? Last time I checked, when something, ESPECIALLY TO GO FOOD, is made incorrectly - you fix it. You don't \"kindly\" charge them for the dish they screwed up in the first place!        It will be along time before I go back...."}
{"text":"Took an hour to make very bland chicken parmigiano and a seafood pasta on a slow Sunday afternoon. Bread was nice though. Very warm. Service slow."}
{"text":"Incredible food. Fair price. Impeccable service. There is usually a wait to sit so be sure to have a beer or a bottle of wine at the Vintner next door."}
{"text":"Delicious, fresh Italian food.  As mentioned by another reviewer, the house dressing, actually made on site, is very good.  Their marinara sauce is particularly tasty (is that a strong olive flavor in it?  I can't pick it out).  Prices and portions are on par with other restaurants in the area, which is to say \"low\" and \"more than adequate,\" respectively.  I've had the pizza twice.  It was never anything to write home about, merely average; why they are frequently cited as having some of the best pizza in Charlotte is beyond me (maybe the best of a mediocre bunch).  The staff at the Park Road location have always been efficient and professional... though they frequently look less than thrilled to see us, and hostess sometimes looks on the verge of yelling at me while seating me.  Don't let that put you off, though.  I've only eaten there maybe five times so far, but I've never been displeased.  This is probably one of the best Italian restaurants in Charlotte, especially if you ignore the chains (most of which are crap anyway)."}
{"text":"Severely disappointed tonight...  Date night started perfectly.  We bought movie tickets early and headed to dinner with visions of excellent Italian food in mind.  More than enough time to wine and dine before the movie, name taken, buzzer in hand.  An already agonizing 25 minute wait turns into not being buzzed or even acknowledged while standing right out front, buzzer in hand, and watching patron after patron get seated despite our earlier arrival, for an additional 25 minutes.  Upon returning the buzzer, the hostess staff had conflicting excuses, \"thought you were already seated\"; and, \"you're next to be seated\".  Taste buds were popping with anticipation and are now dwindling with remorse.  Being overlooked isn't usually our bag."}
{"text":"My Wife and I frequented this place almost on a weekly basis. Today we took my Mother in law  who is in from out of town. The restaurant was not busy.  When we were at the host stand, my wife over heard the server tell the host not to sit us in his section.  We were seated but no sever ever came to great us or take our order for about 20 mins. No one even acknowledged our table. Another table was seated and immediately greated. Needless to say, we got up and left.  NEVER COMING BACK"}
{"text":"Headed to try this place for the first time tonight. Having moved from New Jersey, we've been looking for decent pizza. We headed in at 6:45 on a Friday evening and were seated immediately on the outdoor patio. There were three servers working the outdoor patio, all of who made eye contact with me and my husband. But after 15 minutes, not one of them had come by to check on us, bring us water, or take a drink order. Finally we just got up to leave. I can't rate the food because we couldn't get any service to take an order. But the service was atrocious. Worst I've experienced in Charlotte."}
{"text":"I eat here way too often but that is not a bad thing. Portofino's is one of my Charlotte favorites...probably top 5. It's not the fanciest restaurant but the perfect neighborhood restaurant. Great for when the family comes to town or just Wednesday night take out.    Very hard to go wrong as everything I have tried (and I've been more than 80 times) is  consistently good and large enough portions that my wife and I always split the entree. Our go to is Chicken Sorrento, angel hair pasta and an extra side salad with house dressing on both. Let me say a few words about the house dressing. I look for foods to put that dressing on it is sooo good. It's a creamy, tomato, garlic of some variety. Perfect for salad dressing or just dunking the homemade bread in.   Other favorites are the lasagna, the Chicken Portofino, the Chicken Parmesan, grilled Chicken Salad, the tomatoes with fresh mozzarella.  They also have a special house wine, Portofino Ripasso.   Of the 80 plus times we've eaten Portofino's, 85% have been take out orders mainly because we live so close but also because the food tastes just as good at home as in the restaurant.  Love this place!"}
{"text":"Got pizza to go from here. We ordered a large with mushrooms, basil, and prosciutto on half. We also ordered the garlic bread with cheese. The pizza was good but cold, even though we live really close to the restaurant by the time we got it home. It did taste authentic Italian and fresh! The cheese bread was also good. It was like a cheese sandwich in a French bread type roll. Will order from here again or actually try out the restaurant next time."}
{"text":"We were given an exception when I booked a reservation for 5 on a Friday evening - normally they only take 6 or more. I asked for a red blend and was offering a fantastic Italian Cab Sauv/Sangiovese for a reasonable $6/glass.  The place looks clean but I did see a fruit fly or two around my meal and table.  Service was very fast (so fast my friend \"complained\" her food was TOO hot!) and attentive.  I had the zuppi de pesce. I asked for no squid but it was still on my plate. Normally most place cannot cook squid well and it was confirmed here. Sliced with skin and rubbery with a too salty flavor that tells me not only was it old but overcooked. However the sauce was very tasty, pasta was al dente n the rest of the seafood cooked well - although the mussels were a little briny.  I also got to try a chicken dish with an amazing white cream sauce prosciutto and I think peas. A little jealous I didn't get this dish!  Did not visit the restrooms or the bar area. Four stars for the seafood snafu, but I'd go as high as 4.5"}
{"text":"Wonderful staff, amazzzzzing food, and great little Italian restaurant.  This is my favorite spot in Charlotte for pizza and Italian food.  I love the staff, very little turnover. Enjoyable experience with great food timing so you never feel rushed.  Pizza is hands down the best in Charlotte.  This is the only location I got to even though I live closer to another Portofino's.  This is the best!  Highly recommended for a date night or family dinner."}
{"text":"Be sure to remember your pickup number if you order take out. After being ignored for five minutes the guy behind the counter yelled at me for not knowing my number.  Food is mediocre. There are better and more convenient Italian places in the area ."}
{"text":"It's a shame, they used to be so delicious- everything made fresh.  This is the restaurant we brought all our out of town guests to for dinner; a favorite every time.  Went tonight for the first time in about a year, my Garlic and Broccoli pasta was nothing more than olive oil, bland noodles and a pile of frozen broccoli.  What happened to fresh vegetables?  Isn't that the point of a vegetarian dish?  We paid the bill, no big deal, but I won't be back."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had a date night here last week and it was wonderful! It was raining but we sat outside anyways, they have a cover over the outdoor seating. I had the chicken gorgonzola but substituted spinach for mushrooms and penne instead of cappellini. The waiter had no problem accommodating my substitutions. The salad that came with the meal was fine but no tomatoes which I thought was weird. The bread was hot and AMAZING! I was astounded by the huge portion size of my entree, I got two and a half meals out of it! In addition to the gargantuan amount of food, it was extremely tasty. My boyfriend's eggplant parmigiana was equally huge and delicious. The service was quick and friendly. We've found our new go-to Italian place!"}
{"text":"You know how after you eat something not very good--you're angry you wasted calories?  I'm very sorry to say my husband and I both felt that way after tonight's take-out from Portofino's.   Let me preface this review by saying...I RARELY give 2 stars.  I always feel if it's a locally owned establishment, it deserves a few tries. But unfortunately, just based on food alone, this dinner deserved the low rating.   The restaurant had a 45 minute wait on a Friday night, so we got a large Margherita pizza and some chicken parmesan to go.  We tore into the paper bags and the pizza box, and to our surprise...the pizza had completely MELTED.  We hadn't tipped the box or shifted it in-transit at all.  It was flat and pretty still sitting on the floor of the car.  Cheese was everywhere.   Oil was seeping from the box.  Not just a little oil seepage, but the Exxon-Valdez had just spilled and permeated the box.  That takes a heck-uv-a lot of oil to penetrate a thick corrugated pizza box.   I was starving, and ate two of the massive slices.  They weren't bad...I mean the flavor was there (this is not really all that authentic tasting...since there was no fresh mozz on the pie at all) but again, my mouth was coated in grease after each bite, and honestly, had I not been so hungry, I would have thrown it all away.   Actually, after that, we threw everything away.   As for the chicken parm, we were underwhelmed.  It was forgettable.  No distinct flavor, just the standard chicken parm. The breadstick that was just leftover dough, twisted into a shape and baked.  It could have passed for a bloated pizza crust.   I could knock on it..like knock-knock-breadstick...  The salad, was equally as weak.  Romaine lettuce, red onion rings, shredded carrots, green olives...there was nothing special about this salad.  In fact, it was a bit wet as if someone didn't spin the salad spinner long enough after washing.  The dressing one Yelper called \"amazing\"-- was a creamy orange nothing.  It added nothing to the salad.   GAHH!  I'm so mad at this meal...just writing about it makes me frustrated!   The price, over $30 with tax...and frankly, after I told my co-workers, two of them said \"Why did you go there?\"--one guy said the pizza was made from a pre-formed pizza shell.  (Not sure if this is true...) Another woman told me, for the money, you could get TWO pizzas at another joint 5 minutes away.   Sigh.  I'd like to be fair and try this place again...but after the oil slick in my stomach right now, I think I'd rather not."}
{"text":"In the mood for Italian, we found this little placed tucked in the back of a shopping center.  You know it is going to be good when the person walking out as you walk in say, \"Boy that was yummy!\"  It has a nice authentic feel and the service was very attentive.  The brushcetta was excellent and they even pronounced it correctly.  Baked pasta was so tasty.  The marinara sauce was homemade.  Short rib was so tender, the fork glided through the meat like Michael Phelps in the water.  The only negative was that it took forever to get the check."}
{"text":"Best Italian food in Charlotte at a reasonable price!! The service is wonderful. My mother goes there all the time and they actually have memorized her order and treat her like family!"}
{"text":"Excellent Italian fare. Love the crusty bread! We had Chicken Parm, Lasagna and spaghetti bolognese. Wish we had one of these back home."}
{"text":"Restaurant doesn't close until 10. Was rushed out shortly before 9:30 by sweeping and chairs being stacked on adjacent tables. Service was appreciated by older gentlemen, and I over tipped him. Would have paid nothing for the food to prove a point. Food slightly better than Olive Garden. Would be back nor recommend."}
{"text":"The restaurant is staffed by attentive servers who treat you like family. The food is the best Italian I've had since visiting Italy 6 years ago, and the environment is family-friendly and welcoming. We'll be regulars at Portofino's!"}
{"text":"I DONT KNOW WHAT THE HYPS IS ABOUT!! I ordered a small cheese pizza that was lukewarm, and not cooked all the way. When I picked up a slice, the half melted cheese stuck on the surrounding side slices and I was left with crust and sauce. Not every day you order a cheese pizza and only get crust and sauce when trying to eat it. Not good. I also tried the  chicken parmesan which was very greasy and heavy, and sauce was bland.   I really thought I was going to have a great experience at Portofino's because of other reviews, but maybe they were having an off day."}
{"text":"Being born and raised outside of Philly, I literally cried when I ordered my first pizza in Charlotte back in '92 -- it was that bad.  I have yet to find pizza that rivals that of my home state, but Portofino's comes close.  I love the thin crust and order it extra crispy so it's not soggy at all.  I usually make my own pasta and do not order it out, but when I'm feeling lazy I do like Portofino's combination seafood (zuppe di pesce) in marinara over the pasta of my choice.  It is chock full of clams, mussels, scungilli, shrimp, etc."}
{"text":"I had Spaghetti with White Clam Sauce and the meal was fantastic. I was expecting a good dinner. What I got exceeded my expectations. The clams were in a small shell (very impressive) and the meal was hot, and tasted great. The wait staff was superb and very attentive. The price for the dinner was good, not too expensive. All in all I was impressed and it's not easy to impress me."}
{"text":"My wife and son and both grand daughters went there today for lunch.  We had some appetizers and a large NY style pizza with delicious sausage and real prime pepperoni.  My grand daughter had the fettuccini and it was also good.  Very rich and creamy.    Good service, nice atmosphere, very friendly workers.  Overall I would give this place a solid \"A\""}
{"text":"Every time I've went in the food was GREAT but the service was horrible. I've noticed that they also treat young customers very poorly as if they do not want them in their restaurant. I'm 20 and went in with a small group of friends, was not helped after 15 minutes and had about 4 servers make eye contact with me and not respond when I tried to call them over. We walked out after not being helped after about 17 minutes and received some nice glares from the staff upon leaving, not one asked if there was a problem or said anything. I will not be going back."}
{"text":"I drive past this place everyday when I go to work, so I thought I would give it a try.  I placed an order this evening at 9:07 pm.  It is now 10:50 pm and I still don't have my pizza.  I called twice and no one answered even though it's still between business hours.  Extremely disappointed.  Especially since it's too late for me to go anywhere else to obtain food.  Off to the vending machine I go. *eye roll*"}
{"text":"Tough critic here that can say this is hands down the best pizza in charlotte featuring high quality pepperoni.  They also frequently have delicious specials.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"This was our first visit at this location, but we love portifinos.. Our server was one of the best we have ever had. Our pasta was delicious.we ordered the caprese app and I love it. There bread is so good and I just keep eating that then when my food comes I am stuffed. But we had leftovers to take home and eat the next day which was great. Can't wait to come here again."}
{"text":"One of our family favs for delicious, plentiful, inexpensive meals...my daughters all time fav is chicken parm. No one does it better!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner with my aunt. Ordered the calamari first, it was chewy and overdone. The pasta was a tad pricey and to be honest, I've had better ravioli at Bellacino's and for much cheaper. My aunt had some sort of chicken Caesar salad and raved about it. The service was attentive and polite, but the food was pretty average and depending on what you order it may not be worth the price. Pretty meh in my book."}
{"text":"Usually fresh food and great service but tonight not so much. Will give it another try."}
{"text":"5 stars for the pizza. I consider myself picky and they do it right. It's hard for me to order anything else but when I do, I get the steak and cheese which is the best around too and the lasagna."}
{"text":"I had been craving Italian for a while and we randomly found this place.  I was so happy when we did - it was exactly what I was missing from the Italian restaurant in NY.    We got fried calamari for an app., which came with plenty of food and the marinara sauce it came with was out of this world!  I got chicken parm for my entree.  It was perfect and it came with a side of spaghetti with their delicious sauce.  The service was great and the prices for the quality of food was perfect!!"}
{"text":"The food and the service is REALLY good here.   It's not too fancy and not a dive.  Just really good affordable Italian food.  We eat here frequently and while I've tried many dishes, honestly my favorite thing on the menu is their pizza.  Highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"This is a great new restaurant. I love the pizza, it's New York style. I also had the garlic cheesy bread and that was delicious. Everything I've had there has been good so far!"}
{"text":"We just finished lunch at the new location in Fort Mill/Indian land. Unfortunately, it is not listed yet on Yelp so this review will be going under the Arboretum location. I ordered eggplant Parmesan. While the sauce was flavorful, the entire dish had a rubbery consistency. I only ate three bites of my lunch.  I hate that my husband wasted his money on my meal."}
{"text":"Portofino's has been one of my go to places for a good chicken Parm dinner and good pizza. We moved here two years ago from NJ and been going here since. We were introduced to the restaurant from our friends because the owners are from NJ and to find good pizza here was impossible. But we were just recently there and ordered takeout and we got 2 large cheese pizza and I got the chicken saltimbocca over spaghetti it must've been an off night because the chicken was super dry to the point I couldn't eat anymore and the pizza was over cooked but the crust was too chewy . Usually I have no complaints but I was so disappointed and not to mention the money we spent on 2 pizzas and a meal and I couldn't finish the meal ugh but that still won't stop me from going back. Restaurants are allowed an off night just hope next time around it will be much better!"}
{"text":"Many thanks to Paula for wonderful service. We will return and ask for her! This was one of the best dinners we have had anywhere. Entrees (chicken portofino,  eggplant parmesan,  and spaghetti) were excellent. Bread with dinner was out of this world. Even the house salads were unique and very good.The birthday dessert offered kindly was a great way to top off the meal, too!  Can't wait to come back to try other things on the menu. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Went to Portofinos last Saturday night when I headed over with the Mrs. for a belated anniversary dinner.  Unfortunately (and a pet peeve) the restaurant does not allow reservations or call ahead seating...aarrgghh!!!  When we get there the first thing I noticed was the amount of people hanging outside waiting for a table.  With very limited seating for waiting outside and no outside dining, there were too many people sitting on the ground or standing near the front door.  We go inside and get quoted 30 minutes for a table...a rough start to our visit but I'm patient.  At 45 minutes in to the wait I start giving the hostess the \"eye\" so we get sat shortly after.  We sit down and get Marina as our waitress...she was great!!!  We told her we had a movie to catch in a short period of time and she handled everything like a pro.   Food comes and IT WAS AWESOME.  Brushetta for an app, salads for the two of us, Mrs had the Chicken Piccata and I had the Chicken Portofino.  My meal was fantastic.  I now love that Chicken Portofino.     I would absolutely recommend this Portofino's location for a really good bite to eat especially right before a movie.  I wish they would open up the outdoor seating for dining so it would reduce the waiting time, or better yet...Take Reservations!!!  Overall I give 4 stars though.   If you go, ask for Marina's section.  I definitely recommend her.  She had a great personality, very attentive and professional....and try the Chicken Portofino, you'll love it."}
{"text":"Used Yelp to find this place during a recent visit to Charlotte and was not disappointed.  Service great and staff very helpful and friendly - they made a dish that was not on the menu.  Marinara sauce is sweeter than most."}
{"text":"Wow wow wow! Portofino's has killer Italian food.  I dug into the Chicken Tarantino and was blown away.  One of the biggest portions of food I have ever seen. Tasty and prepared with fresh ingredients also the house salad / dressing was great.  Come prepared to split a dish or take some home for lunch tomorrow.  Our wait was a little long even though we called ahead but no worries, if the wait is long head over to the bar and have a glass or three of wine!  I'll definitely be back - once I come out of this food coma..."}
{"text":"my first visit and it absolutely lived up to its hype.. excellent service and excellent food! will definitely return! already looking forward to it! so thankful for the leftovers!"}
{"text":"$2.50 for a tea?  We like Portifinos and my lunch today was really delicious. Mushroom ravioli with sun dried tomatoes, mushrooms , red peppers and onion with an olive oil sauce. However when we asked for teas to go we were charged an extra $.50 each for the cup. Are you kidding me?  You're already charging $2.00 for the tea and you're tacking on for the cup?  That's nuts.   Live and learn. Will go back for the food but maybe not as often now."}
{"text":"On Friday evening, we stopped in for dinner. This was our first time at the restaurant. As there was a small wait we sat at the bar and ordered a glass of wine. The male bartender was frantically running around and being very quick and short with the customers. This made for an uncomfortable experience.   We each ordered a glass of wine and a water. As he sat my glass of wine down in front of me, he accidently set it on the table pager which caused the glass to fall over. Luckily, I caught the glass and only a small amount of wine spilled on the counter and into my water glass. If I had not caught the glass of wine, it would have spilled all over the gentleman next to me. The bartender did not apologize, refill the spilled wine or replace the water glass with wine in it,  but he did say '\"Thanks for saving my butt\".   Once seated for dinner the rest of the staff continued in the same rushed manner. The table bussers were throwing plates around creating a very loud atmosphere and another came running in the back door, tripping and spilling an entire bread basket almost on top of me. He did not apologize, but the patron at the table next to me did ask if I was alright.   Our waiter was very attentive and the food was delicious. So although, we did not have the best dine-in experience we thought we would give it another try on Sunday with take-out as we were looking for our new go-to pizza spot. We ordered a large pizza and salad online, drove 15 minutes to pick up and when we arrived were told it was at the Ayrsley location, which is 20 minutes from your store and 35 minutes from our house. When we asked if we could cancel that order and place one with your store instead we were told \"yes, but that you would need to recharge us as it is a separate owner.\" There was zero concern on the restaurant staffs end for the inconvenience and not one suggestion for resolving the issue.   We called the Ayrsley location and explained what happened and the man on the phone demonstrated exceptional customer service and offered to refund the money.   We told the Park road staff about that and pointed out that this was our second time at the location in 3 days and that it seemed silly to be treating us this way and losing our business over $23.00. At this point the staff said \"We can make the food, but it's not our fault\".   We do understand the misplacing of the order was not their fault, however, the lack of customer service shown on both Friday and Sunday is.   I called to speak with the manager today to discuss the situation and again was met with poor customer service and a lack of concern for the situation.  This was truly a missed opportunity for the restaurant, had it been handled properly this could have resulted in a customer for life. Instead, we will not be returning."}
{"text":"Great meal with 10 at table. Service was prompt and smart!! Lots of food for the price. Delicious chicken parm, veal Marsala. Always a good meal at this cozy Portofinos. Wait time was 25 minutes at busy hour, but that's exactly the time they told us. Worth it!!"}
{"text":"Good food but had a really bad policy about sharing.  I shared a meal with my wife and they charged me $2.50 for a sharing charge. When I questioned the manager he told me that there is a sharing charge for an extra plate.  At the next booth were 4 people sharing a pizza with 4 plates and settings. They did not pay a sharing charge. So what is the difference?  Unfair policy.  Be careful if you go there. Unfair policy's."}
{"text":"We had a long day on the road maybe 450 miles and booked into our hotel and frankly just wanted some Italian food, the place was a little hard to find tucked behind some stores off a main road, we simply ordered Pizza as we were so tired but the restaurant was a very nice place with an outside patio area that was relaxing, the ambience inside looked like a lot of fun with a lot of smiling happy diners as well , the food was very good and the service was quick and attentive, no complaints in a very warm and welcoming restaurant, well worth the visit."}
{"text":"Usually, this is our favorite Italian neighborhood restaurant. Tonight was the exception. We were seated outside next to the sidewalk and two families of three wining kids and one persistently screaming two year old with oblivious parents. I was seated in a broken seated chair that continued to break apart as I increasingly became aware of our circumstances. After our order was taken, the \"busboy\" moved a small table diagonally between us and those of the parents with the kids and began to use it as the prime dirty dishes cleaning stand as customers squeezed between us and the stand to exit the  restaurant as their clothes brushed over the edge of our table. The food was good and our waitress very good; however, the eating environment was just plain poor!"}
{"text":"This inconspicuous spot could be mistaken from outside as a greasy pizza parlor due to the neon signs. Now, I have nothing against good greasy pizza but do not be fooled people, this is not one of those. Come inside and be treated to a warm and cozy spot with paintings of Venice (I think) on the wall. The seafood dishes really are a fair deal, you can get pasta piled high with clams, shrimp, scallops etc for less than 15 bucks. The service was friendly, our water glasses were never less than half full. Even the creamy dishes were light and tasty. I guess my scampi was a bit less garlicky than I like, but it really wasn't much of a loss - it was quite delicious. I'll be back."}
{"text":"We used to go to the location in Mooresville all the time before it closed down. Something made us think of it, and we decided to head down to Charlotte to give this one a try and be a bit nostalgic.   We opted for an early dinner and went around 5. The place wasn't very busy but definitely was getting busy when we were leaving. We were seated promptly and our server was very friendly but seemed a bit scattered.   We got the affettato for an appetizer which is basically just Italian meats and cheeses. It was tasty. For entr√©es we split the florentina pizza which had pesto, spinach, chicken, and ricotta. Tasty, but could have used more ricotta. The highlight of the meal was definitely the Stromboli. We got sausage and pepperoni. This thing was huge and delicious. My mom also got the Gorgonzola pasta, which she said she loved.   The pizza is good, not great but the Stromboli and calzones are awesome and huge. Also their meat and cheese appetizers (they have a few) are very good. It's actually rather inexpensive, especially for the portion sizes. We'd definitely be back if it was closer to home, but it was quite tasty and a good experience overall."}
{"text":"I love Poertofinos. Always good, especially the Spinach Lasagna. So glad to have a locally owned pizza restaurant with excellent food and service."}
{"text":"Very good food. Big portions which typically draw me away because bigger portion places typically have bad food. The old quality over quantity. But here you get both. I personally had the shrimp scampi which was pretty good. It needed some fresh garlic which I added and it was perfect."}
{"text":"I am updating my review for this place. I have been told that the other locations are better but I assume its just esthetics. But, every time my wife and I eat here. We both have horrible stomach reactions. The food doesn't taste bad and I don't believe it's bad either. Just something about it.   Personally I don't think I'll be going back. Gave tonight a shot and back at it."}
{"text":"The pizza was decent- we had Deep Dish and they served us very fast. The salads are however small"}
{"text":"It was my first time coming here. I got the pasta fagioli & the insalata napoletana. My boyfriend got the veal saltimbocca. They were both delicious! The service was also great. Our waitress was attentive. I will definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"Went out for a quick lunch, looking for some good Italian fare. We were not disappointed. Great menu, great food, great service,....what else could you want!!"}
{"text":"FINALLY tried this place the other day and was I impressed. Authentic menu at reasonable prices. On my recent trip, there were many great smells that filled the room upon entering, most of them from the fresh pizza that many customers had on their table when I was seated. I was tempted to go the pizza route, but instead decided on the Clazone which was HUGE. Started with a salad, which was average, but most side salads to me are, though it does the mind trick of having greens in the diet and feeling good about it...ha."}
{"text":"From their pizza, to their pastas and baked dishes, you just can't go wrong here. Always really friendly service and the portion sizes are huge! Never haven't left with leftovers."}
{"text":"When I'm asked where a good Italian restraunt in Charlotte is - I immediately say \"Portofino's on Park Road.\"  First off, this is the only Itailan restraunt in the area that my boyfriend doesn't raise his nose at and actually suggests that we go to (if you ever tried his mother's cooking, you'd understand).  Their pizza is MY FAVORITE in town, maybe anywhere - and I like me some pizza. I never even think to order anything but just cheese because it's so good and why mess with a good thing?  Their house dressing is awesome! I love getting the house salad to start off my meal (no onions, thanks). The bread is alright, not amazing, but good for dipping in sauce later.  Pizza - YES. Chicken Parm - excellent! Stuffed Shells or Manicotta - though not my favorite, delicious. Lasagna - yummmm. Penne Bolognese - YES YES YES. Baked Ziti - obviously.  I'm sure I've tried more, but those are the standouts as far as I'm concerned.   The wait is rarely long, even when they look slammed. The wait staff is always super nice. Our last guy was hilarious and had the best laugh I've heard in a while. Many of them have Italian accents, which I love for effect.   Decor isn't anything outrageous, but works for me. It's very pleasant and relaxed. Great spot to take the family or a date. (My dad hates going to Italian restaurants when he visits other cities, but makes an exception when he comes to Charlotte for Portofinos. Same with my mom.)  If you haven't been yet or are passing through town - GO. In fact.. you should probably go right now."}
{"text":"We LOVE this restaurant! We have tried the Mozzarella sticks, Lasagna, Tortellini Alfredo, Pizza, and Caesar Salads. It's all DELICIOUS! We have also tried the Chicken Parmesan, but we were not fans. There was no breading crunch to the chicken, it was soggy, and the flavor wasn't the best. However, that was only one dish we didn't like. Every dish is made from scratch and you can taste the freshness in every meal. The service has also been great during every visit! The wait during prime dinner hours on the weekend can be very long with no place to sit or stand so beware! Make a reservation or come at less demanding hours. We love this place and will continue to eat here!"}
{"text":"Seafood over cooked - tasted like rubber. My son had a hair in his pasta . The only statement the manager made was that the cooks don't have long hair. No apology was made to us. We paid almost $200 for our meal. Worst meal we have had."}
{"text":"First time I have been to Portofino's and will be back! I ordered Sorrento Pasta with eggplant. Amazing!"}
{"text":"Just as good if not better than my first visit.   I suggested this place to my girlfriends on Saturday afternoon, I knew it was going to be amazing but neither of them had been before. So I knew their mind was going to be blown!   When we walked in everyone...seriously everyone the hostess, waiters, and managers greeted us at the door! After we sat down we orders some wine and two appetizers the mozzarella sticks and the mozzarella alla caprese. The mozzarella sticks arrived hot and golden brown and that marinara sauce is addictive! And the caprese was so fresh and delicious!   For my meal, I decided to go with a classic...the lasagna. I asked the waiter if it was any good and he simply smiled and said everything we have is good but that is one of our signature dishes.   When it arrived, I was impressed with the portion size and the presentation but hands down this has to be one of the best lasagnas I've had! It's loaded with cheese and meat, the sauce acts as the perfect compliment and the noodles are cooked perfectly! I could only manage to eat half, but when I ate the rest the next night it reheated very well!    Its official...I'm a fan. I've even decided that from here on out this is going to be my top go to choice for really amazing Italian food."}
{"text":"I'm so glad we picked this place for our monthly girl's night out!   When we walked in we were greeted warmly and given some time to go over the menu. I appreciated that especially since it was my first time and they have tons of tasty dishes to pick from. We put in an order for some mozzarella sticks and after a quick recommendation from our waitress and some questions I finally opted for the Shrimp Scampi with linguini.   The Food:  Mozzarella Sticks: Classic. They arrived hot and crispy and the best part was that yummy homemade marinara sauce.   Salad and Bread: The salad was really good. It comes with topped with lettuce, tomatoes, onions, and green olives. The bread loaves are tossed in the oven fresh every time before they come out to the table. Be warned those things are so addictive.   Shrimp Scampi: Huge shrimp saut√©ed in a delicious scampi sauce and a heaping portion of linguini. Who could ask for more? Mmmm...more please!   If I had room for dessert I would have tried to squeeze it down but that just wasn't happening. But they trick you because they bring out a tray with all the selections on it and they all look sooooo good. Next time....one of them will be mine!!!!  Three and a half hours later...Amy and I left stuffed and happy! I'm definitely looking forward to my next trip here!"}
{"text":"We always come to Portofinos with my in-laws for celebratory dinners (birthdays and whatnot). This time we came to celebrate my father-in-laws 60th birthday. We had a group of 9 people set in the back of the first room.   We ordered the bruschetta, calamari, and mozzarella sticks for appetizers. The mozzarella sticks were my favorite, but the calamari was very good. I didn't get a chance to try the bruschetta, but it looked good. We also got bread that was served with butter, and if you ask they can give you olive oil and vinegar.   We were stuffed before our salads even came out. Luckily I got mine to go. I ordered the Gorgonzola tortellini with chicken and added mushrooms. It was delicious! It was the first time I had ordered it, and I loved every minute of it. We at the rest the following night and it was just as good reheated, which is a big plus in my book.   My husband had a few remarks he wanted me to add to this review so the following is from him. His entree came with olives and he asked if they could be removed because he's not a fan of olives. When his salad came, he remembered he forgot to say no olives, which it typically comes with. Knowing that he did not want olives on his entree, the cooks took the olives off of his salad as well. HUGE WIN for the kitchen.   He ordered the trout special for his dinner. He was not a fan. The trout was breaded with marinara sauce on it. Not really his style, he thought it would have come pan fried with no breading and maybe a light butter sauce. Lesson learned, ask about cooking styles before ordering the special."}
{"text":"I knew if I prayed to the Pizza Gods long enough, they would answer my prayers for an authentic NY pizza/Italian restaurant in Charlotte! AAHHH the power of prayer. :)  We popped in on a Sunday evening and to my surprise we had a 15 minute wait. What? Really? Did I hear you correctly Miss Hostess? As I peered around the corner I saw every table and every booth filled to capacity. This was a very good sign and I think I actually giggled out loud. My husband quickly reminded me that IHOP is always packed too and he knows how little I like that place but I digress!  Once seated, I actually got to see how small the new restaurant was. It was almost a little too small but as long as the food was good, I really didn't care.   We ordered a large Cheese, well done on the bottom (because that's how I roll) their Lobster Ravioli (one of 3 specials) and the Mozzarella Sticks.   The sticks were fine. Kind of generic but the Marinara Sauce they served with it was divine! Miss Waitress may I have just a bowl of the sauce and a large spoon? OK so I didn't actually say that to the waitress BUT I thought it.  The Lobster Ravioli came out and it was a beautiful plate of food. It really should have been sold as a Seafood Ravioli because the ravioli was stuffed with crab meat and topped with Shrimp. The ravioli itself was heavy, tasty but heavy. I like my ravioli pasta thin and these were not. I didn't see or taste much lobster. but the tomato cream sauce was very unique and the shrimp and crab were very good.  The Pizza arrived and it was like an event, carried in by a very tall Waiter with our Waitress on his heels with our plates. There was all kinds of commotion at our table with the waiter trying to fit the pie on our table and the waitress trying to bus the table, rearrange things and add new clean plates. It was all a blur really. He placed the pie on the table and my children's eyes got as round as silver dollars! The smell was amazing, the color was amazing and the bottom was cooked to PERFECTION!!!!! But how did it taste? Maybe I won't tell you. Maybe I should keep it a secret for fear that you will all go and now my wait will be double or triple the time...OK fine, this is a review after all. It tasted like heaven!!!!! It tasted like a true NY pizza with a little less grease (thank God) AND for a brief moment I was transported back to my beloved Manhattan"}
{"text":"While in Charlotte earlier this week (Monday through Wednesday), we wanted to eat at Portofinos since last year we had a delicious white pizza from one location.  Not being familiar with Charlotte, we kind of sort of knew where we had been; however, we relied on GPS and ended up here.  Either the owners have read the reviews about service OR the folks complaining went on a bad night, but service was excellent.  Our waiter, Stafford, was there when he was needed but not hovering.  Another young man stopped by to refill water and remove dishes as needed.  A table with some young women and children was to our left, and they also appeared to be getting good service.  It is VERY casual. The bread.......it's worth a visit for the bread! The food:  okay, this is where we get on the roller coaster!  Although the bread was great, ours was a little burnt on the bottom.  Not sure if it was on Yelp, but I had read reviews saying the house dressing was great; we found it to be bland and would not get it again.  The side salad has no cheese or croutons.  I just didn't eat the burnt bottoms, because the bread is so darn good.  The main event:  again, based on reviews, and NOT my normal preferences, I ordered the Chicken Portofino.  I'd personally never get this.  Again, this is NOT what I'd normally get, so keep that in mind!  The mushrooms in this dish should have been sauteed in butter, the ham should have been something other than what appeared to be the ham you buy in the prepackaged deli meat section of your grocery store.  The \"cream\" sauce tasted like a white sauce with milk without allowing the roux to cook long enough to kill the raw flour taste.  My honey ordered the salad with that same dressing; he agrees it's not great.  Although he complained to some degree about the lack of croutons and cheese, the main thing was that blah dressing.    His main event:  Zuppa de Pesce.  THIS dish and the bread (we'll get to dessert later!) are why this place gets 4 stars!  Since his favorite seafood is anything but shrimp, I got those.  The sauce was so good.  Very flavorful with just a hint of heat.  I've been with honey now for almost 10 years and this is the FIRST time I thought he'd actually have held the plate up and licked it clean.  You could tell the sauce was made with fish and/or shellfish stock, not water or chicken broth.  I believe he'd pick this as his last meal.  Dessert:  normally, I'm the sweet eater, but between the bread, the 4 HUGE shrimp, and what I did eat of my chicken, I was full.  Upon hearing that they have \"real\" spumoni, my honey took a chance on getting both that, a cannoli, AND an espresso.  Of course, I forced myself to try both!  According to honey (a real, true to life Italian!), the spumoni was \"real\", the cannoli was wonderful.  He thought the espresso should have been warmer, but oh, well, he managed to drink it and finish off the cannoli and spumoni.  So.......if you get burned bottom bread, just eat the rest!  Unless you really LOVE \"cream\" sauces, personally, I'd avoid the Chicken Portofino, and try their Caesar dressing......now that's a good a dressing!"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying I normally love Portofinos. When I first moved to Charlotte, I would always go the Eastway location. As I moved around the Queen City we would always hit the location on Park Road or in Ayrsley.   We live right by the Arboreteum so we decided to give it shot. Our waiter (Al) was great and the food very good, but we were extremely disappointed in our table. There is a little nook by the door to the kitchen where they sat us. Everytime anyone came in or out, the lights would blind half the table. The servers congregate by the door and it was quite a lousy location.  After being sat, I was told nothing they could do and that we would have to wait another 30 minutes when there were several tables available. I do not understand why they would even have that as a seating option. I will not go again to that location and highly recommend you go to the Park Road or Ayrsely location instead."}
{"text":"Not sure why but this Portofino's does not have the same flavor as the other Portofino's - less sauce on the pie or not enough salt in the dough it is just lacking flavor.   Love the one on Park Rd and Arsley haven't  been to Eastway Rd location  in 15 years."}
{"text":"The casual atmosphere was great. The was very fresh. Side salad with house dressing and hot fresh Italian bread was wonderful. The entrees were Shrimp Scampi and Chicken Sorrento. fresh shrimp and tomatoes, angel hair pasta. Reminded us of the same quality food we had while in Italy. Rated it a four because my wife likes her tomatoes chopped a little smaller. Other than that it is a 5. Friendly staff and very attentive. Price was very good. $40.71 for the two entrees with salad and one glass of wine. Very reasonable price."}
{"text":"This is a great place to go if you want to take someone for great food in a very casual atmosphere.  It has the looks (and is) a real pizza joint out front while there is seating off to the rear for a nice Italian meal.    Despite the Italian \"Pizzaria\" feel, the menu is quite diverse which allows for a wide range of choices.  It is just really hard to choose something other than Italian food with the aroma of Pizza lofting through."}
{"text":"Best home cooked Italian joint in NC so far.  Their special was awesome!  I wanted to get the Shrimp Scampi, but they had a special with shrimp and scallops and I couldn't so no.  Glad I didn't.  Absolutely the best thing ever.  Give this place a  try!"}
{"text":"Will not go back to this location! I have had great experiences at Park Road and order take-out quite often from there. The Providence Road location always under-cooks. I said I wouldn't go back but decided to give it one more try this past weekend because it's close to our house.  My Calzone was wrong, only had cheese in it and was still doughy. The pizza we ordered was also still doughy. I hadn't ate all day and just ate it and went to bed. Big disappointment at this location! I will not give it another chance."}
{"text":"Craving some Italian yesterday.  Tried to call in my order but they wouldn't pick up.  Had to go in and wait 20 mins only to get home and find the wrong order in my bag!  Too cold and rainy to drive back.  I will give them 2 for rolls and salad.  Not a happy customer."}
{"text":"We have always loved the Portofino's on Eastway Drive, so we were super-excited when we noticed the Portofino's sign go up in the old Avanti space at the Arbo.    Last night for dinner, we decided to go check it out.  We weren't the only ones...it was a popular spot last night!  When we arrived, we were told it would be about a 35 minute wait.  In fact, the wait turned out to be closer to an hour... but we didn't mind since we decided to go over to the Vintner Wine Market to have an appetizer and a beverage while we waited.    When we finally got a table, we were seated right in front of the kitchen. Not normally my favorite place to sit, but we were just happy to be seated.  Despite how busy they were, our service was pretty good.   I ordered one of the specials that had shrimp and chicken sauteed with garlic and tomatos over a bed of cappellini.  It was very good and like the Eastway location, reasonably priced.   I look forward to my next visit!"}
{"text":"We dined at Portofino's on Park Rd this weekend- the third time I have eaten at this location. We are huge fan of the Portofinos on Eastway - but for some reason, this location has not been good for us.     To start with, we selected a bottle of red (Portofino Ripasso) which was very enjoyable.  Sadly, the rest of our meal wasn't as good as our wine.  We both selected from the specials of the day which came with a house salad and bread.  It took quite a while for our entrees to arrive, and when they finally did, I eagerly cut into my chicken dish and was dismayed to find ham (before ordering, I had told our server that I did not eat beef or pork, yet he neglected to tell me that the special I had selected was prepared with pork). In any case, they were kind enough to take back this entree and let me make another selection. I selected one of the fish specials.  But sadly, by the time it arrived I was no longer hungry so they boxed it for me to take home. I ate it the next day for lunch and while the fish had a nice flavor (it was a bronzini sauteed with mushrooms, capers, and cherry tomatoes ), since it was a whole fish rather than a fillet, it was filled with bones to the point that it was not enjoyable to eat.  Also, it was served with a side of garlic pasta which was dripping in olive oil. (I love olive oil, but this was to the point of excess!!)  In any case,  I would not recommend this dish to anyone!   My boyfriend selected the other fish special of the day and he fared much better than I did. His seabass (which was a fillet rather than a whole fish) was perfectly cooked and served on top of a bed of risotto with a stuffed portobella mushroom cap on the side.    Since we had the mishap with my entree, they offered us a complimentary dessert with coffee. We selected the tiramsu. It was ok but they were skimpy on the marscapone and tried to cover it up  with gobs of whipped cream and chocolate syrup.  All in all, this meal was a huge disappointment given that we dropped over $100 (for 2 entrees, no appetizer, a bottle of wine, plus tip).  We probably would have been much happier if we had just ordered the wine and a pizza!  However, I must say that my experiences at the Eastway Drive location have been much better - the food is better and overall the service is much better (even though I don't particularly like that area of town -especially at night)."}
{"text":"Nice little Italian spot and very family-friendly. Food was great, generous servings and enjoyed our meals!"}
{"text":"We had a light lunch. Grilled seafood salad  Good flavor and  lots of calamari. Not enough shrimp. A little skimpy on the arugula.  My son and I both thought that the bread is tastier on Park Road.  Good service.  Pizza here is the best."}
{"text":"Our go-to Italian restaurant since moving to Charlotte from Chicago. Food and service are excellent. New York style pie is great."}
{"text":"I was crushed when Portofino's in Mooresville closed down, because when I was working in the area, it was my definite go to spot for lunch.  I was out & about today in the South Park area & just had to get my cheesesteak fix...& at the lunch price, no less!  I called my order in at 1:15 & was told it would be 15 minutes. I was at South Park Mall, when I called the order in, so I wasn't too far away. When I arrived at little before 1:30, my order was waiting for me. The restaurant was still a bit busy with the lunch crowd.  I headed on to the back of the restaurant to pick up my order. It was neat to see a familiar face in one of the waiters. He had worked at the Mooresville location & of course remembered me as being a regular. :)   The man who rang my order up was very friendly.  And of course, again, I was happy about receiving a seven-inch cheesesteak & a bag of Lay's plain chips for less than $7.   The restaurant is a decent size & as Jeff S. pointed out, it's \"done up\" in Italian style, as you would expect.  They do have a separate bar area, that's set off from the main dining area.  When I got back to the house about 20 minutes later, the sandwich was still hot, thanks to being wrapped in aluminum foil. As hungry as I was, it didn't take much time for me to devour it.  Ohhhhh, it tasted just as good as I remembered! Thin, chopped up steak, with melted cheesy yumminess, & nice sized mushrooms.  I'll definitely be back..."}
{"text":"I drive by this location all the time but haven't stopped by. I was in the mood for some pizza so I ordered a pie to go. Went with the special with Prosciutto and while the pizza was good, the prosciutto was a bit salty. My friend tried a slice as well with the same conclusion so it could been an bad batch, who knows? I'll have to go back and try some of their other stuff due to all of the reviews but it looks like a good neighborhood spot if you're craving some Italian food or"}
{"text":"I had a pizza topped with pineapples and ham (Hawaiian is my favorite!)  Although it tasted great, I did not like that the cheese was somewhat greasy.  The service was excellent; could not have been better.  The restaurant was very clean and the architecture is gorgeous."}
{"text":"Very consistent Italian restaurant.  My son take martial arts near here so I am in quite often for a beer (If I am early) or afterwards treating him to pizza.  I have had several different menu items and have enjoyed them all.  Service is always wonderful and the prices are great.  Not the perfect place for a date, but perfect for enjoying a good meal with great service."}
{"text":"Had the BEST Eggplant Parmigiana EVER there last night.  This was not the first time I had been and have already remembered everything being very good.   Would give the Eggplant 5 stars and the salad 3, so 4 stars it is!"}
{"text":"I really love this place.  Best pizza I've had since I moved to Charlotte from NYC 2 years ago - hands down.  Super friendly staff, great authentic Italian dishes, cozy outdoor patio - this is our GO-TO place for pizza and Italian.  They have a small pizza (satisfying enough for 2) that's $8.  It doesn't get better than that! :-)"}
{"text":"This is pretty much lunch room pizza. The cheese everyone is so crazy about is absolutely disgusting. The sauce is worse and the crust is equally as bad. I would rather get Papa Johns but being that there is not one near my house guess il just be pizza less.    On top of the bad pizza the service is bad also. You are always rushed off the phone when you call to order and they don't even say thank you. I went to pick up my pizza and over heard them complaining about a compliant they recieved online. Their response to their review was \"fuck it\".  Good job Portofino's"}
{"text":"Had another great dinner here.  For a saturday night we got seated in about 20 minutes, slightly under the expected wait time.  The wait staff was excellent all through our meal and the working together was excellent.  Our waitress was particularly great at timing the courses so that we had time to enjoy each one.  Everything was great but the salad dressings were outstanding.  We had the house and blue cheese dressings.  The only thing we couldn't enjoy was dessert because we had no room left.  But seeing everyone around us dnjoying them is a good sign.   Maybe next time we will reverse the order.  We will be back, it's worth the 95 minute drive."}
{"text":"I had the Sicilian crust pizza here last week and it was fabulous!! Very light crust, crispy on the bottom and the sauce was perfect. I am a hard to please pizza eater from New York and this was great. The service was fantastic and the merlot was great too! The pizza was so big for us three adults, I took home about six pieces and they were even better reheated in the oven!"}
{"text":"Completely terrible!!!!! They bring you the wrong glass of wine and when it is not taken off of the check,  the \"floor manager\" - \"Tyler\" comes to the table to announce he normally doesn't take it off when half of it is gone???? Trust me, ... I would have drank it if it was good!!! Not sure who drank it from the time it left our table but are you kidding me ????????? The food was also mediocre for claiming to be a \"true\" Italian place!!!  This place deserves NO STARS but you can't post your message unless you put at least 1 !!"}
{"text":"Best Italian food I have ever had. A neighbor of mine recommended this place and he didn't steer me wrong. The calamari to start was great. Their bread could be better but who wants to fill up on that! I ordered the chicken Gorgonzola and oh my gosh! The first bite in and I said wow! It was so delicious. My parents were delighted with their food as well. The service was prompt and we all left saying that was some of the best food we've had before. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"A generous antipasto, full of fresh ingredients with a flavorful dressing started our meal. Our pizza was delivered before our second mouthful of salad. It to was fresh with generous toppings but a bit dry with to little sauce for my taste. When near to Arboretum give it a try!"}
{"text":"No question best pizza that I have had in a really long time. Always friendly. Always on time when I order take out. Price is about right for the quality, did I say fresh ingredients ?  Yup.   Fresh."}
{"text":"This is probably one of our new favorite authentic Italian restaurants. You can tell they come from a rich Italian history with each and every dish. They have so many options, and we haven't gone wrong with anything we've had there before.   We were with another couple and decided to skip appetizers since we knew how much food was coming our way. The other couple ordered a \"small\" white pizza and cheesy bread. The pizza was much larger than expected and neither of them left hungry. I didn't try it but they said it was very good. My boyfriend got the old try and true, chicken parmesan with angel hair pasta and he left with a clean plate (completely stuffed). I chose to go with the stuffed eggplant which was an eggplant rolatini stuffed with ricotta cheese and ham and it was very very good. The sauce used here is more of a sweet sauce, which is different than what I'm used to but it tastes very fresh and I would prefer that over canned sauce any day.   The service was great, the food was hot, delicious, and very reasonably priced and I will most definitely be back again."}
{"text":"In town for one night and tried to find the best Italian food possible.  I found it!  Just back from Italy for a week and didn't notice a difference.  I wish I could give it 10 stars!  I'll be back every chance I get."}
{"text":"First time here and it was GREAT! From the atmosphere, to the food and even the waiting staff. I'm a simple gal and I got just your basic chicken Alfredo the portion size was just what I was looking for! Big and tasty! I'll definitely will be back for more!"}
{"text":"I have to admit that I haven't been to many pizza places in Charlotte since moving here, but this is the best pizza I've eaten here. The prices aren't too bad either. The last time we went, we ended the meal with a cannoli. It was delicious too. Sometimes the to-go orders back up and the tables fill up and there isn't anywhere for people to wait. The line will back up into the dining room, so tables near the front have a crowd around them, which can be uncomfortable for the diners."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved everything.  Our first time, but a new family favorite (and we eat out a LOT!). The fresh bread is wonderful, the pizza is by far the best we've had in Charlotte.  Baked sausage and peppers and Cappellini Mediteraneo were both fabulous.  Great service, fair prices, couldn't ask for more."}
{"text":"I really wanted to give this place at least one more star but alas I cannot. My husband and i came here on a Friday night and it was really dead. We ordered fettuccine and baked ziti. The food was ok. Not exactly wonderful but not bad. It wasn't worth what we paid though.   The server we had was also very rude. We were near the end of our meal and he stood at our table and waited for us to finish eating. Really? There were only 5 other people in the whole restaurant so it's not like he needed the table. Then as we were leaving no one of the 6 servers or hostess we passed said a word to us. No \"thanks for coming in.\" Nothing.   We will not be returning."}
{"text":"You'll almost always have to wait for seating here, but the pizza is a great option for south Charlotte!  They do have a tiny outdoor patio and most of the seating is inside.  Pretty casual atmosphere and great for just grabbing a pie, garlic knots or some other Italian fare!"}
{"text":"I did not enjoy my dinner at the restaurant . I ordered the  veal and shrimp. The veal was rubbery and tasteless the shrimp were covered in mozzarella cheese and had no flavor. The sauce tasted like water.  If I hadn't been at the restaurant with other people I would have given this place a one star, but the other couple I was with enjoyed their veal parmesan. just because you put a fancy name on a menu doesn't mean you know how to cook it and this is true with this place. There is more flavor in a jar of ragu then there was on this food. I suggest you try a different restaurant if you want good Italian food."}
{"text":"This location was a disappointment   The location on Park Road is better. From parking to food. Over all more of a hassle of wait and mediocre food. I had a chicken dish and my wife had a pasta entree. Both did not compare to the Park Road location. I do not plan on going back. Maybe we went on an off day and it was just bad luck. If I go back I will update this post."}
{"text":"What a nice find by my daughter Tiffany G. for a homey, neighborhood Italian restaurant.  After Frankie's on Morehead closed, and we moved too far from Ciro's in University City, I didn't realize how much I missed the joyous, casual, celebratory spirit that is unique to the Italians: gioia della vita!  Portofino's delivers.  We reserved a table for six in the corner and raised our glasses to life's blessing last night.  The place was slammed and our waiter never missed a beat.  Thank you!  All the food was very good, and my son's large calzone--wow!  Monstrous.  We joked it looked like a large pizza had fallen out of the oven and they folded it over and served it as a calzone.  Humungous. Understandably, he took 2/3 of it home.  In fact, we ALL took food home; Portofino's is generous with their portions.  And fine on the wallet, too.  An absolute repeat, especially when it comes to family celebrations!"}
{"text":"Middle of the road! We ordered a pizza with green peppers, pepperoni and mushrooms, and a dozen of their seasoned wings. I would put the pizza just slightly above Vocelli's: it was hot, but it was greasy and the sauce lacked depth. The wings were fresh, hot and crispy, but they were lightly seasoned and had very little taste. The delivery time was spot-on if not earlier than quoted. Most likely would not order from here again."}
{"text":"The rudest workers. They have no idea how to make certain dishes. Based on the service and the down right rudeness, I would not go back here. They better learn how to run a business and speak to their customers. They should also learn to check their to go orders before they give to you and you drive all the way home. Would be nice for them to compensate us for the error on their part after we had to drive all the way back. I have had this happen before at other establishments and they have been kind about it as well as made up for it, mistakes happen. As long as you handle it correctly, I would go back to those restaurants. Would not go back here!"}
{"text":"The BEST Chicken Piccata in town.  It's my favorite dish my mom makes and no one has ever come close to making it so good.  It's still not as good as mom's but it's darn close!"}
{"text":"Why, hello Italian restaurant tucked away in a Harris Teeter shopping area. Come to find out, this place has been here a while and that the owners are from Italy. Who knew?!  There's a nice sized patio and a pretty spacious interior (you would have no idea by looking at it from the exterior). It's a warm atmosphere.   The entrees are of large portion! The lasagna was tasty and the salmon salad was very good! The service was friendly and attentive! I hear that their pizza is really good...I'll save that for next time.  I plan on returning to try the other tasty dishes!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now and haven't really been able to find an entr√©e that I would order again. Not much of it seems to have a fresh taste. The pizza is probably the best thing on the menu.   They always seem busy so maybe it's just me."}
{"text":"It was good. The family agreed on their meals that it was just good. Would have rather had garlic breadsticks if some kind with meal instead of the French loaf. Male hostess and female waitress were nice and service was excellent  Spaghetti with meatballs. Penne with meat sauce and cheese ravioli with tomato sauce is what is pictured"}
{"text":"So this is a local \"chain\". I use chain loosely but these guys have a few locations around town. I used to live behind this location but I hadn't eaten here before until after I ate at the other one in Ayrsley. Anyways it's good, but not as good as their Ayrsley location. The menus also have a slight variance so my favorite dish isn't offered at this location. I don't live near this one anymore so it's doubtful I'd be back. Don't get me wrong the food is good, but I've been spoiled by other Italian and by the other location as it, after all, has my favorite dish that they serve."}
{"text":"I am a BIG fan of the Park Rd location (which is closer to where I live and work), but decided to take mom by the Arboretum location (over by Michael's and Versona) to try one of their delicious subs.  The Arboretum location is smaller and more intimate than the Park Rd shop, few seats, but comfortable and clean.  The waitress was an absolute delight - all smiles and she, along with the other staff, kept our drinks filled and made sure we had everything we needed.    My FAVORITE is the cheese steak, which I ordered the 7\" as to not get the \"look\" from my mom about ordering the 11\".  Steak, cheese, onions, peppers and crusty bread served with their fries (chips come with, fries are $1 more and well worth it).  Delicious!  Mom is a big fan of veal (I don't eat veal, but I do eat beef, I realize my hypocrisy, but it is what it is), so she ordered the 7\" veal parmesan, and declared it to be the best veal parm sandwich that she has ever had.  She ooh'ed and ahh'ed her way through it and said how tender and delicious it was.  A happy mom is what is most important to me.  Great visit, great location, should I be in the Arboretum again, I would not hesitate to stop by for a cheese steak (or pizza, or pasta... I love Portofino)."}
{"text":"The service was great & food was amazing.  Only downfall, server didn't go over the specials. We didn't see the board, as we were seated quickly & saw it as were leaving, and would have liked tohave tried them.  We got the tiramisu to go and it was perfect!! Definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Update #754 for me for this location - the dbag waiter is no longer at this location, so now I can go back to my weekly visits for CHEESE STEAKS and/or pasta.  HOORAY!"}
{"text":"Great pizza and menu in general - only problem is that the restaurant is way too small and you sit on top of one another."}
{"text":"ALWAYS an outstanding choice for Italian! Been here many times, and it's always excellent food for a very reasonable price.  If you have not eaten their \"Chicken Portofino,\" you MUST give this a try! OMG it is SOOOOOOOOOOO good. It's Chicken breast dipped in flour and saut√©ed with mushrooms, ham and onions in a cream sauce. That CREAM sauce is to die for! For those of you who know me, I'm a pretty darn good cook who's been taught how to make classic French sauces through my Johnson & Wales Chef Choice classes. Well this one is textbook cream sauce (though Italian not French). You can taste the butter and cream, and it makes this dish heavenly. I don't know how else to describe that taste. I've ordered this dish a dozen times before and each time it has been consistently prepared, and consistently AWESOME!  My date ordered their Osso Bucco special. She never had that before and she loved it! I tasted it and it was cooked to perfection. That slow braise did the trick. Super moist and tender, and very flavorful.  TIP: Ask for their \"Portofino House Red Wine\" and they'll bring you a Venetian Ripasso, which I call the \"baby Amarone.\" For $32 bucks you get an excellent bottle of red wine which drinks much better than the $32 price point....at least it does to my wine palate!  Just love this place. Hope you enjoy it as well!"}
{"text":"First time here, and for sure last. My husband asked for fried calamari on his seafood pizza, the waiter said ok. 3 min later...he says \"Manager said NO\"....not once did manager come to explain why not...we even said we were willing to pay extra he still said \"sorry Manager said no\". Not having a correct answer and Manager not even coming to explain means customers are not priority. Girl that was training with main waiter was very sweet and she was very understanding with us. Im new to charlotte coming from tourism capital Orlando, FL and im used to great service. Lets say I wont come back. Food was okay. Mellow Mushroom has better pizza."}
{"text":"Service, cleanliness, food, was excellent! We enjoyed an antipasto for an appetizer, wine, two entr√©es (lasagna and chicken parm) which came with bread and salad. The entrees are HUGE and very delicious. I want to get dessert, but was too full. This is my Italian spot in Charlotte. Most defiantly will recommend."}
{"text":"We picked up pizza here last weekend. Crust was good - could really taste the oven (maybe a touch overcooked?). Unlike many other Charlotte pizza places, the ingredients tasted fresh and nutritious. Staff were friendly and the dining area looked nice (as I ran in to pick up the order). We also ordered tiramisu and cheesecake for dessert (just to make our meal extra healthy), and they were great. Not the best pizza in Charlotte, but definitely worth trying/ getting from time to time, and we will definitely eat there soon to try some of the non-pizza offerings."}
{"text":"Did not know about this restaurant and came here because of a colleague's recommendation.  As we entered the restaurant, the hostess was figuring out where to seat the patron in front of us. Martino, the head server/waiter came over and asked will that be two for dinner? Would you like the patio or inside? The hostess came back and wanted to seat us near the entrance and we said no. We ended up with the table after the one by the entrance area.  Here is my review for the food and the service at Portofino's.  Ordered two appetizers  Fried Calamari- lightly breaded and fresh even the sauce was delicious. Not greasy or overly fried.  Roasted Peppers and Mozzarella- The mozzarella was fresh and roasted pepper were sweet.  Salad  Asked for a Cesar Salad with Anchovies and they made it to our specification. This is definitely impressive. Most places serve only what is listed on the menu.   Entrees  Rock Salt fish with Shrimp and Linguini- My friend enjoyed his meal.  Veal Saltinbocca Ala Romana- Prosciutto with melted mozzarella on top of veal which was so flavorful and tasty. Would have preferred the spinach to be on the side instead of on top of the veal.   Dessert  Homemade Tiramisu with a cup of cappuccino. Delicioso! Got my sugar fix for the rest of the evening.  This is definitely an authentic Italian restaurant."}
{"text":"Hm, it was a 3 star eating experience.  The service was fast and the food was fast too.  We were seated immediately and asked for drinks within 15 seconds. We ordered a large pizza for the four of us and a tossed salad to share.  The salad came out fast and tasted perfect except for a few pieces of lettuce that were soggy. Then the pizza came out and tasted average...The crust was slightly burnt and could have used some more butter around the edges."}
{"text":"It had been years since I had eaten at this location.  I have been to the one at Ayrsley a few times and it was just blah.  I decided to go back to this location and was glad I did.  The food was so much better and everyone working was very nice.  I ordered a gnocchi dish and while the gnocchi was definitely not made from scratch, the read meat sauce was delicious.  My friend had the baked ziti (which I usually get)  and loved it.  This location seems to have t together and will be the one I go to henceforth.  Lunch prices are pretty reasonable too."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful dinner there recently. Very good food, service, ambiance, and price. I'm hooked."}
{"text":"Portofino's is the kind of restaurant I can get behind. A small local chain with great food, equally great staff, and a warm and inviting atmosphere. I've ate there twice and both times were good experiences. Their food is hearty and filling and a notch above anything I could concoct in my kitchen. The chicken portofino has everything Italian food should in my opinion, alot of well seasoned tender meat, rich creamy sauce, and a huge helping with enough for leftovers. The shrimp parmigiana isn't quite as perfect, but I still enjoyed it and like that they use really fresh jumbo shrimp. Kudos for their tomato sauce too, some places have a tendency to make theirs overly sweet, but Portofino's keeps their sauce a little tangy, just as a tomato should taste.  I feel that great service can make average food subconsciously taste better, but luckily the quality of their food and service shine through in both areas. Their staff is superbly friendly and they come by frequently to check on things. They clearly want you to have a great meal, and as you can probably tell by my review, I like Portofino's quite alot. Skip the 45 minute waits at Olive Garden and come here, you'll leave with a full belly and a smile on your face."}
{"text":"Never disappoints...food is great...staff is friendly and accommodating...no complaints!!!"}
{"text":"In Charlotte, this place is good as it gets. It stacks up against the heavy hitters in Boston and New York. I had the veal Marcella which was fantastic. The service was great as well and don't you dare leave without a slice of their signature dessert Tiramisu. Enjoy"}
{"text":"Every now and then I just have to go gnab a big plate full of mollusks. The \"Scungilli and Calamari\" entree (evidently scungilli is Italian for conch) certainly delivers on that front. In addition to the plate reaching approximately to the South Carolina border, the pasta was utterly swamped in calamari rings and conch strips. I am pretty sure an entire reef's inventory of squid went into this dish. I certainly can't ding Portofino for skimping on the portions.  While I enjoyed the calamari, I was disappointed to discover that the conch was really rubbery and almost challenging to get through it all. Even though I just ate here last night, I really can't recall anything about the sauce, which tells you a lot about how interesting it must have been. Also, the salad went for the \"Titanic\" approach by seemingly having crashed into an entire head of Iceberg lettuce.  Nothing too exciting here, but Portofino is a nice little neighborhood Italian hangout where you can grab an enormous mound of decent pasta on the cheaps."}
{"text":"Great food but an on line menu might help drum up some additional business"}
{"text":"Seemingly always crowded, but for a restaurant that is a good thing: it lets you know that other people enjoy it.  I have been here twice now for dinner, and the wait hasn't been too terrible. The service was good, considering how busy they were, and the food was good to very good.  During my most recent visit, I had the lasagna, which was very rich and large-portioned. I can generally eat a good bit, especially of Italian food, but that evening I had a nice bit to take home as leftovers.  My girlfriend at the time said the Tiramisu was very good as well.  Prices are maybe a bit higher than some other Italian restaurants in the area, but you get a lot of food for the money, so that's not a big deterrent for me."}
{"text":"Both locations of Portofino offer great Italian comfort food.  This place offers great pasta and meat dishes, and also has great pizza.  The pirces are moderate but the portions are large enough to account for them.  I love to get take-out from this place because it can be a bit crowded for dinner.  The house salad dressing is really great, and a side salad is the perfect addition to a pizza."}
{"text":"Great spot. Love their pasta dishes and they have great sandwiches as well. Not many know, but they probably have the best Philly cheesesteak in Charlotte"}
{"text":"How can something so simple be so GOOD?  Basic New York style pizza, love the thin crust, flavorful sauce and perfect amount of cheese.  Pasta dishes are fresh and delicious as well.  Service is good and prices reasonable."}
{"text":"We get take out from Portofino's frequently. I really enjoy the tortellini gorgonzola, but all the  food is always excellent. The only issue is the guy taking phone orders. He's so abrupt and ready to get off the phone you feel like you won't get your food if you don't order properly, like the soup nazi."}
{"text":"I ordered from these guys the night I moved into my house last year and have tried to make it a weekly affair since. Great pizza, pepperoni rolls, and quick delivery. Thanks!"}
{"text":"I think what bothers me most about this place is the lack of customer service. I keep coming back because the food is good. My family and I have tried this place more than a handful of times hoping that the lack of service was just a fluke. But no, it's not. Everything we walk through the front door, I have yet to get a smile and \"welcome to portfinos\" we just get \"how many?\". The cooks are right by the entrance too. They see everyone that walks through the door. They could say hello and give a smile or welcome to portofinos, but no. So- I give this place a 3 star because of the lack of hospitality. If they stepped up their greetings at the door, I would give them a 4 star because I do like their food."}
{"text":"This place needs to update their hours because apparently at 11 o'clock when they say they close at one they don't pick up the phone"}
{"text":"Lovely and reasonably priced spot for good Italian food. We enjoy dining on the patio and the service had been consistently good. We prefer the pastas and pizzas, with good noodles and quality crust. The salad and bread the accompany the entrees are also excellent. We typically don't even need and appetizer and have plenty of leftovers to take home (not often the case for us elsewhere!). I have yet to try dessert because I've been so full after my meal but look forward to doing so. This spot makes you forget you're in a strip mall and is great for a date night, family outing, or celebration. Lunch prices are especially good."}
{"text":"My favorite Italian restaurant in Charlotte great for dine in as well as carryout.  I love this place everything here is amazing but my go to meal options are the chicken and veal parmigiana (I prefer the veal), great pizza, and I love the stromboli as well as the mozzarella sticks. The house dressing for the salads is also the way to go, delicious.  You truly get your money's worth here the portions are HUGE.  The HIDDEN TREASURE here is the philly cheese steak the best one I have had in Charlotte. (picture coming soon as in the next time I go)"}
{"text":"Fantastic osso bucco, grilled chicken cutlet parm. I heard that they have chicken cacciatore so definitely have to try that!! It's alot of work so can't wait to test it out. The bruschetta is wonderful and I want to try the calimari as it seems to be made in flour. Awesome restaurant and I can not believe I missed this gem."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Italian food in Charlotte! My wife and I go regularly and it's always consistently excellent. The restaurant does need some updating but we go for the food. We drive close to 30 minutes to go here for lunch that's how much we enjoy it."}
{"text":"I love this pizza place! I eat here at least 3 times a week for lunch during work. I usually order a salad or a pizza or a hoagie. I have never been disappointed. One time my order was incorrect they immediately fixed it and I was of course satisfied. They have the best sausage pizza!"}
{"text":"This is my first time at this Portofinos location and food is consistent at all the locations in my opinion. I am a big fan of their pepperoni pizza, it is always great ! I decided to try one of their pasta dishes this time. The shrimp scampi was amazing ! It was flavorful and the lemon was just enough, not over powering. The shrimp where huge and the portion size are big as well. Very well possible to share for 2 people. Nice atmosphere and good customer service."}
{"text":"Planned to visit this Italian cuisine on a Saturday night - expecting a large crowd we went early but surprised to get ourselves a table. The restaurant wasn't too crowded and there were enough waiters around every table. We went directly for the entree or Pasta to be specific. I got some Bolognese with Fettuccini which came with a Salad and Bread. Our waiter was very happy to fill up the Bread as soon as we finished it. The Salad came in and I was not thoroughly impressed with it - looked more like already prepared and the lettuce wasn't so fresh. The main dish came in -  Bolognese, the meat and sauce were mild and alright. I wasn't too impressed with the dish but it wasn't a let down too."}
{"text":"Food was delicious!! I ordered 3 musketeers , shrimp, veal, & chicken parm with gnocchi"}
{"text":"I love this place! My boyfriend and I just went to Italy this summer and it took months for us to crave Italian food again. Portofino's doesn't disappoint with their authentic Italian menu offerings."}
{"text":"Always good if you're just looking for a classic pizza. They never disappoint.  Pepperoni can get a little on the greasy side, but that happens almost everywhere."}
{"text":"Portofino's is a nice neighborhood chain Italian restaurant that offers a consistent experience, but nothing sticks out as spectacular.   It was pretty busy when we came in, but service was still fast and friendly. The margherita pizza was just okay, too much sauce and not crispy enough. The gorgonzola tortellini though was pretty good. Super cheesy in the typical Italian fashion. On the plus side we did have some leftovers for the day after.   Just okay, I may or may not visit again."}
{"text":"Portofinos on Park Road is one of the few places I go for good Italian cuisine in the QC.  I'm not saying it's the best Italian I've ever had, but it certainly ranks up there as far as Charlotte goes.  After living in New York for two years, I arrived in Charlotte less than satisfied with the pizza choices.  Portofinos comes CLOSE to having a perfect New York slice of pizza.  I say CLOSE because the cheese and sauce are deliciously tangy, with the perfect amount of spice and sharpness.  The crust is also delicious, and you can tell hand made.  The only reason I'm not giving this place 5 stars is because the crust is a bit thick. I think they could make it a bit thinner and truly have a winner.  The atmosphere is casual and inviting, their pasta dishes are excellent and their house dressing is TO DIE for. It's a cross between a Thousand Island and a French dressing.  If you're craving Italian, this place won't let you down."}
{"text":"Great food but the wait staff is off putting, our waitress  seemed  bored and not wanting to be their with a rushed attitude towards us. Unfortunately I was hopping this would be my go to neighborhood restaurant but scratch that idea."}
{"text":"Reasonably priced lunch considering the huge portions. I'm here for the Philly cheesesteak!"}
{"text":"I've been a regular at portofino's since 1996. But for some reason the pizza is not nearly as good.  The last time we went we had to bring the pizza back it was hard and there was no cheese on it. Me and my husband thought it was fluke. But tonight it was the same thing. It wasn't that ediable.it made my stomach hurt bad I tried to just eat the toppings because the crust was so hard but there was not cheese just a meatball. Needless to say I'm still hungry and I don't fell like driving all the way back to get another one it safe to say I will not return to this location by will go to arslye and park rd"}
{"text":"My son and I went in during a lunch break from a local Dr. appointment...we were able to get in and out in about 30 minutes, our server was exceptionally polite and the food was hot and delicious. Their fries are absolutely to die for!"}
{"text":"Food was horrible! tonight.    chicken parm. sandwich, soggy!!! no good.    Pasta Primavera, was like eating   pasta with half and half dumped on it!!!!!  no flavor,  too much cream, not enough veggies.   terrible!!!   could not even eat it!!!!"}
{"text":"Arboretum location.  Had take out, baked ziti, chicken parm.  Was good, but VERY SALTY!!   I can usually eat a big bowl of pasta/ziti but could hardly eat 1/3 of it.  Please lighten up on the salt.  thank you.  I don't think the Park Rd. location is as salty, I always liked the food there."}
{"text":"This is our go-to place for takeout Pizza. The crust is always on-point, thin, chewy and hand stretched. Ingredients are always great here, starting with the homemade sauce and sausage, all the way to the hand-chopped veggies. Service-wise they are always friendly and efficient.  Recently we actually ate there with a big group - excellent experience. Portions were HUGE, service was very accommodating. The Chicken Parm sandwich in particular is outstanding, especially the hand-breaded chicken and the crusty bread!  Worth coming back to again and again."}
{"text":"Chicken Parm.  Chicken Parm. All day. Every time. Order it. I can't not order it. I can't even explain the feeling of excitement I get when it gets put on the table in front of me.   Everything about this is fantastic. The chicken is cooked just right (could maybe use a little more crisp, meh, i don't need it), the sauce is just right, and the pasta is perfect. The people are friendly, food is good, it gets a little loud when its crowded - but its good. Go here. Take a date here.Take your parents here. If you're single, take me here. haha. I'm going to order the chicken parm."}
{"text":"Good Italian food. Best pizza in town. Dine-in or take-out and you will be happy.  Must be in the sauce"}
{"text":"We really enjoy this family restaurant each time we visit, great Italian food and good service. The stuffed eggplant is great and the pasta is always a crowd pleaser.  Good place for everyone"}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in Charlotte! By far!!! I've never had a bad meal there...ever!!! Btw best sangria I've had in my life. Love LOVE this place!!!"}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this little place trying to avoid yet another fast food lunch. The place is clean and well staffed. The food was very fresh and was actually NY Style pizza for a change from all the posers. I had the Pasta Primavera. The portion is quite large. I am a glutton and I ended up leaving a quarter of it in the bowl. For $7.95 its very generous. Amazingly fresh cream sauce over your choice of pasta with broccoli spinach and tomatoes. Awesome meal."}
{"text":"This is my first dine-in experience as I've only picked up pizza before. I arrived at 6:15 on a Thursday and possibly got the last table. However it was near the front door do it was chilly and I had to wear my coat the entire time.  My waitress recommended a nice cab blend to start. After reading other posts on here, I already knew I wanted the zuppa de pesce entree. First she brought me bread. It was warm but not great. But I ate more than I should. A house salad came with my meal which was perfectly sized and had nice flavor. The house dressing, a creamy tomato-basil dressing, was delicious!  My meal arrived and my eyes about popped out of my head! It was HUGE and loaded with seafood! Overall it was a somewhat healthy meal as it had a marinara sauce and linguine with even more seafood! Needless to say, I brought home a box and hope it'll be half as good reheated! I'm do glad I ventured out on this crappy night to try Portofinos! I'll definitely be back! (And the pizza I've previously gotten was tasty too!)"}
{"text":"We went to Portofino's last night after watching a movie and the service and food were excellent!!  Fantastic choice for my late birthday celebration.  I will definitely go back!  Great tasting food, excellent service and the price is unbeatable!"}
{"text":"Portofino serves up delicious Italian food and has an extensive menu, with pasta, meat dishes, pizza and subs. I've been there for dinner a couple times and tried the lasagna and spaghetti and meatballs. I'd recommend both dishes. The servings are pretty large so chances are you'll have leftovers to take home. The warm garlic bread is also a plus, as is the long wine menu. The restaurant has a cute intimate decor and the service is friendly. It's a good dinner spot for a romantic date."}
{"text":"I thought the food was absolutely delicious! I had linguine with clams & was some of the best I've ever had. The BF had a sub and said it was normal/average. The decor is just thrown up on the wall, nothing to ponder or talk about. Our bill came and it was more expensive than the prices on the menu. When I asked he realized he had charged dinner prices, not lunch menu prices and adjusted it, a $12 correction. For great Italian, highly recommend, for fancy date night/romantic dinner...it's not the place"}
{"text":"I heard a lot of good things about this place. Walked in and it was a nice atmosphere. However the food was very bland... the mozzarella sticks were obviously frozen and weren't the best and the pizza was completely bland. There was no flavor to it at all. The waiter was nice which was one of the bright spots but spending 20 bucks on a bland pizza is something I won't do again."}
{"text":"I went with a few friends for dinner last night per their suggestion. There were 5 of us that were sat by the door and they had to add an extra chair to accommodate us. The waitress brought us 2 pieces of bread to start off. When we finished that extremely fast we politely asked for more bread. The waitress said that we could not get anymore bread until we order our food? I have never heard of this in my life... did she think we were going to just snack on the free bread? I ordered the eggplant parm which doesn't come with pasta. It was very bland. The tomato sauce didn't have any flavor and looked to be out of a can and not homemade. For the price and quality I probably will not go back to this location."}
{"text":"We've been regulars at this location for years. But lately, I feel that they've slacked on quality and flavor. The last few times we've eaten here, the food has been bland. Their pizza is still top notch and I love the bruschetta. However, the pasta dishes have been disappointing, with runny sauces and no seasoning. Even a little salt could've helped tonight!"}
{"text":"I just have to say that this place has been consistently great. It's our go-to pizza place when NY Pizza is closed, and also when we want to treat ourselves to a fine Italian dish. The food is always fresh, filling and delicious. Plus the service is always delightful. Bravo!"}
{"text":"Food was excellent (stuffed shells), service was attentive, prices reasonable."}
{"text":"I chose A-OK rather then being a fan because of the 93 rating. Its a pretty small/intimate seating area and they seem to have a lot of servers.  The bring out bread($1 extra if you don't order entrees) with balsamic vinegar and oil which is pippin hot and delicious.  Entrees are $12.50 & higher but they do come with a side salad.  Baked ziti doesn't have ricotta cheese in it which is a HUGE bummer in my opinion. Pizza is fantastic!!  Not so much the white pizza though.  We would like to go back but will need the sanitation score to be higher."}
{"text":"Portofino's is the best! We order from them for our Office several times a month and we are always very happy! They always pay attention to detail and the food is ready for pick up when they say it will be. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Love it here only problem is the booths are SO uncomfortable they sink in badly other than that no problem at all"}
{"text":"One of my favorite Italian places in the city. I usually go for the Chicken or Veal Parmigiana. They come with salad and bread so on most occasions I can make two meals out of these heaping portions making it excellent value. Occasionally I will branch out and try other things and everything I had has been delicious and served quickly. Most of my friends come strictly for the pizza. It is hard for me to order one with the afore mentioned items readily available. But on the occasions where I have ordered a pizza, it was really really good with an excellent crust. They also come in HUGE sizes so they are great for a family or a bunch of friends."}
{"text":"I eat here almost every week with a group of friends. The staff is awesome and the food is fantastic.If you like fresh fish this is one of the best places in town!Very kid friendly too.I must mention the pizza...if you like NYC style pizza give this pace a try you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Hubby was craving pasta and we realized we hadn't picked an Italian place in our hood yet! We went to trusty yelp and found this portofinos in the arboretum. We had a great time. After being seated in the nearly full and cozy dining area, our waiter greeted us right away. I asked a ton of questions about the wine list and our waiter was knowledgeable and recommended a great pick. He had perfect timing and checked on us often, he was excellent. Hubs then ordered spaghetti and meatballs and I ordered the salmon with pink sauce. Everything was wonderful! Al dente pasta, perfectly cooked proteins, and flavorful sauce. The dessert plate looked amazing and I definitely want to try in the future, we will be back!"}
{"text":"In my opinion, BEST pizza in Charlotte.....and I've tried them all (hawthornes, brixx, intermezzo, luigis, fuel).  The tomato sauce is flavorful; the crust has a homemade fresh taste and the sausage is great as well.    Also, their house salad dressing is amazing.  I would go back just for the dressing.  It's a creamy sundried tomato, garlic, mildly spicey dressing.  Yum.    We went today for Valentines and despite the consistent flow of people, the service was still flawless.    I really want to try something other than the pizza but I enjoy the pizza so much that I don't want to be disappointed.    Our bill for a side salad, medium pizza, garlic bread and a glass of wine was $25.....not bad!  Definitely give it a try (for pizza and a salad at least)!"}
{"text":"We used to order at least once a week, (my boyfriend even more before I moved in) we loved their food, until one night we ordered pizza due to having family over(mostly kids) ordered 1/2 plain 1/2 mushroom. When it was delivered the whole thing was covered in pepperoni. Called to complain and was told they would send another up, but we had to return the whole pizza that was ruined, that's fine ( even the delivery driver said he would have let us keep it because they can't sell it). So we let that slide, then a few months later we ordered a pizza, and some pop, after an hour and 40 minutes (mind you I'm at the top of the hill from them) called and had a rude girl say they were closed due to weather (unless the driver had bald tires roads were fine because just got home) but our pizza was on its way, it was ice cold like they left it outside for an hour and then sent it. Never again. I worked in a pizza shop and I would never justify that treatment to someone who ordered weekly."}
{"text":"So let me start off with I order from here every Friday night and sometimes twice a week. I love their salads. The service has gone down hill this past year. I went from five stars to one. I also wanted to see if the second pending charge was dropped before it posted to my account.   So this past Friday April 13th I ordered 2 salads online and they were for pickup. My boyfriend picked them up. When you order online you get email confirmations. Later that night I checked my emails and I had 2 confirmations. I checked my bank account and I was charged twice. I called Portofino's and spoke with Lisa. I explained to her what happened and she goes \"hey bill it gets even better\" I said excuse me? She goes \"listen this isn't my problem, what's your name\" so I told her and she found my receipt and said \" I only have one charge for you...you were charged once\" I said I can send you a screen shot showing I was charged twice she replied go ahead. I said is there an email I can send it to? She said no...I laughed and said how am I supposed to send this to you she said I don't know it's not going to do anything if you send it...this is my problem. She continued to say this goes through a third party and you need to contact them.\" But she had no information of how to contact them. She was so extremely rude. No customer service. I get it's Friday and you are busy...however all she had to say was I have one charge on my end that I can see, I would wait to see if both post to your account and if they do call the third party and get a refund. Also have the number handy to give to the customer. This is known as customer service. Something Portofino's lacks.  I just called and talked to Shawn the manager and explained this to him. He did help me with the number for the third party and I explained how rude Lisa was. He said he was sorry and that they were busy on Friday..not that was a reason for her to be rude. Nothing more. I thought perhaps he would care when I said how much I order there and how she made me not want to return. He said he was sorry.   So that being said I will no longer order here. I do like the salads and buffalo chicken rolls. However the service is horrible. I have had delivery guys show up with a cigarette hanging out of their mouth. I have received the wrong salad but since I like them all I normally just keep what I got. I have had orders that are missing things. No one seems to care. I'm sure I can find an establishment that cares I am a customer."}
{"text":"Had lunch here yesterday and I was very impressed!  The ambiance is welcoming, and everyone greets you when you walk in.  I had the chef salad which was huge for only $8.50.  Everything was fresh and there was a ton of meat and fresh mozzarella too!  It was so much food I couldn't finish it.   The waitress was very nice and fast to get our order out.  You can tell this place is a local favorite."}
{"text":"In short, this place serves up super tasty Italian food and pizza with local hospitality and charm.  After receiving several recommendations for Portofino's, we finally got around to sampling their fare.  I ordered my standard Italian dish, lasagna bolognese, and my wife ordered a plain cheese pizza.  The lasagna was very good but that pizza?  Oh man, did I order wrong!  I could not stop asking her for just one more bite.  Be aware that this place is like a local version of a Carrabba's or a Macaroni Grill, only with MUCH better food and no cheesy artificial flair.  If you want a family friendly joint to serve up some great tomato sauce and cheese, this is the place."}
{"text":"Porto Finos is just ok. The food is decent-if you're looking for your basic local pizza shop you won't be disappointed with the pie. Other menu offerings are good as well. I've not been to the shop, but gotten delivery. This is where the trouble comes in.   They seem to not have enough people working ever. The last couple of times I've called they have taken WAY too long to answer the phone, then they set the phone down and walk away for a few minutes after hastily asking you to hold, and then when they finally talk to you, they let you know that delivery will take over an hour. Hire a couple more employees for the evenings!   Also, when paying with credit card they require the security code off of the back of the card. Not all places require this and it makes me a bit nervous. This is how people can hack accounts and I just don't like providing it over the phone. The guy who answers the phone will also repeat my credit card information back to me over the phone-in the middle of a crowded pizza shop! Also makes me nervous...and I'm not even a paranoid person. I just think that some things make common sense. Repeating a credit card number in a crowd does NOT make sense.   Overall, they have good food. They could use an improvement in customer service though. Step it up, guys!"}
{"text":"The lemon cake is to die for I fell in love with it just as I have the hot dogs you must go and see for yourself take it from someone that order two slices of cake and six hot dogs"}
{"text":"Mmmm. They have the most amazing pizza here. And it's not that expensive. The sauce or crust must be loaded with garlic butter, because it is fantastic, yet light at the same time. I say go for it, get a pizza that's loaded, because you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Fantastic little place! Verdict was out when we walked in. Wasn't quite sure what to expect but was pleasantly surprised! Delicious from appetizer to entree to drinks! Def would recommend it with surprisingly cheap prices!"}
{"text":"We really do like this place and the food is always on point and great family place. Most of the time we eat in the dining room cause we are with the familia but at times my wife and i eat at the bar. The last 4 times we have eaten at the bar Woody has been our bartender he is absolutely miserable, not only with most of his customers at his bar but how he talks and speaks to his fellow coworkers. Tonight was just bad overall on how he was talking to us and if i was the 2 coworkers he was talking nasty to i would have went off on him at the bar. From now on moving forward if the of us come in to have dinner at the bar and Woody is there we will go somehwere else. I know hes been there forever and the regulars deal with him but enough is enough."}
{"text":"My wife and I came here based on Yelp reviews. We recently moved here from NJ and are always on the lookout for good Italian food.  We started with the calamari, which was large enough for 2. It was average for calamari but the marinara that accompanied it was fantastic. My wife also had the crab bisque soup which she said was outstanding. For the main course my wife had spaghetti with clam sauce and I had eggplant parmesan. Both dishes were plentiful and delicious and we ended up taking half of each home for the next day. Overall an excellent experience. Plan on a wait when arriving as they are often crowded, another sign of good food. We can't wait to return to try other dishes."}
{"text":"This place serves great Italian food!  Plenty of pasta choices and (from what I hear) great pizza as well.  The portions are large enough that you'll want to take half of your dinner home (and quickly devour it the next evening!).  It's kind of fills the same niche as the Olive Garden, but that's not really a fair comparison because Portofino's is more authentic and much tastier.  The service was impeccable.  Drinks stayed refilled and everything was served exactly when expected.  Our waiter was not only pleasant, but entertaining.  He actually seemed to be enjoying his job (imagine that!).  The place is small, but charming.  I imagine they have the draw to fill a larger space, and that would certainly cut down on the wait for a table."}
{"text":"Don't believe the hype! The wait was long, the service was slow and food tasted as if it came from the kitchen of an old country Buffett.  The pizza was very good and had a good NY flop to it.  The chicken Parm wasn't any better that I could get a mom and pops pizza shop.  $65 for 2 kids and 2 adults is to much for this low quality food."}
{"text":"How does this place only have three reviews. I have been going for at least 10 years between this location and Eastway. Best pizza I ever had. It's thin but not too thin you can fold in half and it folds just right. Best crust. We love this place."}
{"text":"I normally only get take out from here (which is always good!) but man was I pleasantly surprised when we actually went in to sit down and eat. We called ahead to put our name on the list since it seems to always be a popular choice, and ended up only waiting 10 minutes. Soooo... we got a glass of the Cabernet the bartender suggested- DELICIOUS!  For appetizers, we ordered the roasted red peppers and mozzarella and the \"appetizer for 2\" to share. A lot of food but full of flavor! I may add that their calamari is always a winner but we had to try something different for once :-)   For our entree, we split the chicken cacciatore that was served with a white wine sauce. Not sure if I'm wrong here, but I normally make this with a red wine marinara sauce. However, the sauce was absolutely delicious!!! A lot lighter than I typically expect but really good. (Even though we had to take majority of it home!)  Definitely get the house creamy basil dressing! Cant get enough of it.   I also want to add our server was really great. She was super patient with us taking a little extra time to order and splitting an entree. Also, I loved how attentive each and every staff member was to not only our table but each table individually.   Authentic food. Wonderfully sweet staff. And great family/date atmosphere! Great job Portofinos :-)"}
{"text":"After ordering from Portofino's three times. I'm ready to review!  Just had my second order at this location and the first time I ordered from the Park Road location.  I will mostly overlook the RUDE hostess in this review.  She turnt out to be rude.  The young platinum blonde hostess greeted me when I came in but I decided not to dine in but was looking for a certain type of meal of the menu.  The manager was attentive and stepped in right away to see what I wanted.  He willing to give me a good price to try a combination.  I decided to give them time for my order so I went to two stores next door just to kill time.  When I arrived back the hostess was outside talking to a friend which I witnessed long before I made an entrance inside.  We were two steps from each other and she walked in ahead of me without holding the door open.  Then greeted me like she had never seen me before so I kindly said I'm picking up my order now ().  Other that that was I was pleased with my meal.  The chicken Parmesan is always consistently good.  Delicious thick Parmesan cheese on top and tasty sauce that's not sweet or bitter.  Today, differently I tried the cheese tortilini and it was amazing.  I had the exact cheese sauce on a pasta dish some months ago at an Italian restaurant near University City.  I missed that sauce son bad although the chicken was tasteless.  Portfolio has that same sauce and the dish itself was delicious to be meatless.  The pricing was fair for what I wanted.  Next time I won't be so skeptical to try some new."}
{"text":"After ordering from Portofino's three times. I'm ready to review the two locations I've visited!  I've first ordered from this location but the providence location is closer to my home.  I always pleased was pleased with my meal.  The chicken Parmesan is always consistently good.  Delicious thick Parmesan cheese on top and tasty sauce that's not sweet or bitter.  Today I ordered the cheese tortilini from the providence and it was amazing.  I had the exact cheese sauce on a pasta dish some months ago at an Italian restaurant near University City.  I missed that sauce son bad although the chicken was tasteless.  Portfolio has that same sauce and the dish itself was delicious to be meatless.  The pricing was fair for what I wanted.  Next time I won't be so skeptical to try some new.  The service is quick and a good use of space inside."}
{"text":"Amazing food! The pasta, salads and pizzas are all fantastic. Their pizza sauce is unlike any other and the baked ziti is wonderful. Never had a bad meal, we pick up food from here once a week. Everyone is friendly and I'd definitely recommend if you're craving great Italian and can stand a busy restaurant."}
{"text":"Mothers Day....not the best day to judge a restaurant because of the crowds! And we had a mix up, with whether or not they take reservations or not. We were told when we called earlier in the week there was NO reservations on Mothers Day.  But the Manager was very accommodating to us and found a place for us to sit, we were divided up but we had a huge party of 12 and two high chairs. So it is GOOD Italian food, large portions but good sauce and great salads. The House Salad dressing is great, a Tomato based, with basil and garlic. Salad is full of olives and onion and cucumber, a very nice house salad. I ordered two of the Appetizer trays for the two tables. I had the Veal Parmesan, with the tomato sauce on the side. It was two nice size pieces with a large helping of Angel hair pasta with red sauce. The Veal was crisply fried with a nice amount of Mozzarella. My husband had the Manicotti but in a Alfredo Sauce, it was delicious! Some of the other family members had the Tortellini and the Chicken Picatta . They brought around a dessert tray and I ordered the Chocolate Lava cake, that is the only disappointing thing we had. It was just like a small bundt cake but not any \" Lava\"  in it. Service was very good and it was a huge party, that was pleasing. I have been to a couple other Portifino's and they all have been good. Oh the Calzone is huge and stuffed full of delicious ingredients, I have to get one next time I go!"}
{"text":"Having been to the other location off Park Road I kind of knew what I was in for when coming here for lunch the other day.  This location has a rather small dining area it seemed but there is a nice patio for the better weather days if you so choose.    I ordered the chef salad and it was fantastic.  Big rolls of turkey, ham and cheese and fresh greens along with the home made ranch dressing really hit the spot.  Our waitress was nice and polite but I felt a bit rushed as I was asked if we would be having dessert and I literally hadn't even finished my salad yet.  Maybe she was in a rush to close out her lunch and leave for the day?  Either way, Portofinos is a solid selection for Italian style lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Good spot, reasonably priced, casual atmosphere with really great food.   Woody at the bar is the best!! I usually grab a table with a friend, but if you are dining solo don't get take out, I mean I'm sure it's great and everything, but just grab a bar stool and enjoy your meal with some really great company.  It's like a little local spot with really friendly people a tv and a pretty extensive wine and cocktails selection.  Woody was great. Super sweet and super attentive. (He's the bartender) I mean he even refilled my cannoli because I left some shell on the plate and it obviously needs filling to be eaten   I love their linguini with clams, their  Sorrento Pasta (pomodoro with mozzarella)  And the Arriabata? I think that's what it's called? It has red sauce and mushrooms  They have great house salads and really really good bread, like really really good. It's made fresh and is always hot and delicious!!   If you save room for dessert they have the best cannolis and my new friend Deb at the bar said their tiramisu is"}
{"text":"1) Big portions 2) Nice wine selection 3) Good service 4) Tasty food 5) friendly family style food  I have eaten all over Italy and this place wasn't close as someone else commented.  It's tasty, but a little bland.  NYC has better.  I had sausage and peppers as well as a few apps.  The seafood special was massive.  My coworker got it and it had swordfish, shrimp, mussels and clams over a half pound of linguini. He couldn't finish it."}
{"text":"Everything I have had at this restaurant is amazing. I love the pizza and even if it's just two of us we will get the specialty kind of pizza and split the leftovers to take home. One of my friends is addicted to their house salad dressing and they always let her have some extra to take home. Shout out to our recent server Mark! We had great service and will be back again."}
{"text":"Chicken Gorganzola was incredible! The salad was fresh and full of life. I think I just stumbled on the yummiest Italian in south Charlotte. Have to say the cust svc and \"hostess\" are not awesome so when I return it will be for takeout. But I do look forward to my return!!"}
{"text":"Not impressed. At first I was excited that there was a Portofino's location opening up close to where I live. When I arrived, I was met with 3 unimaginative cold looking pizzas laid out close to the door exposed to the elements and the biggest black fly I've seen in a long while. That must have been one well fed and happy insect.  Anyway, I had already called ahead and ordered the vodka penne with chicken. It was gross. I don't use that word lightly. I could've done better at home. There was no flavor. There was no seasoning. The chicken tasted deliberately bland. I had even dumped a ton of Parmesan cheese in it to rescue the flavor. Nothing was helping. It wasn't cooked with love as they say. I had also ordered a slice of lemon cake. It tasted like it had been sitting in the open air all day. I didn't eat much of any of it.   I am beginning to feel that if you are not Mama Ricotta don't try making penne vodka in the Charlotte area. LOL!"}
{"text":"The pizza sucks at this location the New York Pizza next to this place is 100 times better New York Pizza was closed on Sunday's so decided to try because of all the rave and by far worst pizza I've tried in a long time. Food specials are always over priced and don't always taste good. The Portofino's at the other location may be better I hope so."}
{"text":"I actually like this location better than the eastway location I love the food and the atmosphere it does get very busy here FYI"}
{"text":"Overpriced for what you get, a clear \"southern American\" style of Italian food--which is to say it is greasy, over salted, and (I suspect) frozen.  1) My date and I chose the \"balsamic vinaigrette\" dressing with our salad, but there was no vinaigrette to it--it was pure balsamic vinegar.    2) The chicken parmigiana was overly crusty along the edges and the breading did not flake off easily--indicative of pre-pared and frozen before reheating in the kitchen.  The capellini were good, al dente.  However the breasts were EXTREMELY greasy from either excess oil or poor quality cheese on top (which by the way, was hard to discern).    3) The arrabbiate was over powered by the salt.  I understand it contains proscuitto (which is usually thin-sliced by the way, not chunky), but the salt dominates all competing flavor from the tomatoes, olives, garlic and basil.  A sure sign of poor quality food! Also, I requested broccoli with the arrabiate.  The server replied \"of course.\"  No broccoli.  4) The cappuccino needs to be removed from the restaurant.  I understand Charlotteans are no Europeans, but the cappuccino is obviously made from instant mix.  I asked the waitress if she made it with an espresso machine and she replied \"yes, we have an espresso machine.\"    5) The only saving grace was the bread, which was served warm and soft.  One piece of bread is too small for two people, so you have to ask for more.  I'll go to Maggiano's for future frozen Italian food, at least they have white table cloths to match the inflated menu prices."}
{"text":"We got pizza here last Sunday and it was dry. The onions were black. OK it happens. We called and they were going to give us a new one. When my friend went in he was extremely rude and even blamed it on us \"because we took too long at Harris Teeter.\" First it was they left it in too long because of us. Then it was sitting out too long. Not that I need proof but I had my time stamps of all receipts and was there within the 20 minutes they told me. Never again will I go back. Things happen. I get it. Blaming it on the customer???? No thanks! I work in customer service I get how it works. We'll find a new place!"}
{"text":"The worst Italian food I've ever had.  The lasagna I literally wouldn't feed to an animal. I'm not exaggerating."}
{"text":"I got their chicken parmigiana (showed picture of breaded chicken) came with chunks of chicken and tasted horrible. Called the girl was extremely rude and I asked to speak to the manager/owner... he was to busy to talk to me. Wanted to credit me $5 for my next purchase.... I'm sorry I will not ever be eating there again.... disgusted!!"}
{"text":"A tasteless slopbucket like a soiled diaper. If you enjoy questioning the sanitation and origins of ingredients...this place has mystery! Forget TV...This place has everything!...Dirty DNA...dining tables that are never used...women over 50 in opiate recovery...cooks that use their sleeves for tissues! This food begs the question: Did I do something bad in a past life or Jesus personally...and is that my hair or a mystery chef? And someone tell them that Italian dressing isn't olive oil...food should be prepared hot...their website hours and their prices are wrong!  Never again. Go the Eagle and get a take and bake pizza....anything else is better."}
{"text":"One of my favorites.  I love the Tortellini Gorgonzola, however the house dressing is gross.  Service is hit or miss and manager seems like a jerk.  The food is the only reason why I return.  Period."}
{"text":"Best pie in Charlotte for my taste buds!  Dough is awesome, cheese is fantastic, and toppings are perfectly balanced around the pizza. Price is awesome too!!!  Thanks for putting out a high quality and consistent product.  There other menu items are great as well.  You should do yourself a favor and try this place out!"}
{"text":"There aren't many Italian restraurants that I have been to in the area, probably because when I get a craving I always come here. The food and service are good, the portion sizes are large and the prices are fair. I usually order a seafood pasta dish but dinning with friends I have never heard a complaint about any of their dishes."}
{"text":"Great spot! Family friendly, amazing service, massive portions and outstanding sauce!  You gotta try the Affettato!"}
{"text":"Great food and the staff was very attentive. The seating is a bit congested, but otherwise this place is awesome! We had the white pizza, eggplant parmesan, chicken parmesan, house salad, lasagna and a seafood pasta dish. All the meals were delicious and served hot from the oven. We had to wait a bit for the lasagna to finish cooking, but it was well worth the wait and the wine calmed our impatience."}
{"text":"One of the very best Italian places in charlotte - highly recommend the pasta sorrento. Comes with salad so lots to wait for"}
{"text":"I love so close and noticed how busy they always are. Unfortunately my experience was not so great  The wait person left us with no drink refills And I had to get someone else to find him to get me ticket to pay. Pretty sad when they were not that busy"}
{"text":"Simple, well made pizza and other typical pizzeria fair.   Portions of the pizzas are sadly not justified by their price. Too many nights ordering from Portos dropping over $15 and still hungry.   Perfect portions for lunches."}
{"text":"I've been to this place once to get a gyro,my husband took me there since it's near our place of business. So it was Saturday night and me and my daughter were hanging out at our shop,I figured getting a pizza would be nice for late snacks.  So let me start with my order taker,my order taker wasn't really that pleasant,I got this impression that it's like you're bothering them by calling them for delivery,I was ready to just hangup and call another place but I tried to remain calm so I ordered medium Hawaiian,fries and 6 pc wings. When I received my delivery,I got a cheese pizza instead,no pineapple and ham. I was disappointed but oh well. They gave me 7 pc wings instead of 6 probably to make up for the mistake idk.   The positive side is I love the wings and the fries,and above all,my picky eater toddler loved the fries and the garlic parm wings. The delivery guy was nice too and I got my order in less than 30 mins.   I will probably order from them again,they just need to step up their customer service."}
{"text":"Meh. Portofino's is fine--nothing over the top special, though. It's not bad, certainlly, but there's nothing about it that really distinguishes it from a standard Italian restaurant. But that's a pitfall that a lot of italian places can't avoid, so I don't really get upset.   Big, heaping servings, which is always a plus. Fast, attentive service--definitely a plus. And everyone there was pretty friendly.   Pretty packed though, so be wary of that--and lots of corporate diners, so it wasnt exactly a mellow experience in that regard. I'll be back, but I won't exactly be ushering friends here. Or you."}
{"text":"The food was four stars, a few other factors lowered it to three.  First the good: the pizza was excellent. We got the montese which had prosciutto, basil, and mushrooms. The saltiness of the proscuitto complimented the sweetness of their pizza sauce. The crust was very good. Excellent pizza. I'm a sauce and crust curmudgeon and they scored very high with both!  My wife and daughter split a kids style penne with butter and my wife said the pasta was al dente... cooked nicely. The salad and bread were also good.  Now the bad: first off, this is not a paper plate take out joint. There are near $20 entrees on the menu. That being said, there is no excuse for the servers not offering freshly grated parmesan at your table. They have packets of US Foods pseudo saw dust cheese and stuff out of the shaker which is US Foods pseudo saw dust cheese. Our server finally brought shaved fresh parmesan from the kitchen on attempt number three. So, there are fresh chunks of parmesan available.. why the fork is it not offered by the servers? Throw in the fact our service was slow and often inaccurate, that is why this is a three star review.  So, food good! Service and intangibles, meh. We will eat there again when in the area, but we will be well armed to know to ask for shaved parmesan."}
{"text":"LOVE this place! If you're looking for authentic Italian look no further. The pizza is awesome, cheesesteaks are great and the pasta is to die for. My favorite is Shrimp Fra Diavolo with a spicy pink sauce. I have been going since 2003 and have yet to be disappointed in any location."}
{"text":"This is my go-to neighborhood joint for solid Italian food when I'm in Charlotte. The pizza is good and the pasta dishes are delicious and reliable, especially the basics like spaghetti and meat sauce and the chicken Parmesan. Take out or dine in, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I love this place ! We have had the pizza, which is amazing they make sure to take care of you lots of cheese, lots of pepperoni, ect.  Gyros are amazing. Haven't had one that i wasn't satisfied with they pack in the meat and its real gyro meat not the kind that looks shaved.  Wings are super meaty ! Not little and stingy! I suggest that you go here for a quick cheap meal."}
{"text":"Walked away disappointed. Thought I was going to get the whole Italian experience but yet it's that \"New York\" Italian kinda place.  I have discovered I don't like NY style pizza- crust on pizza should be crisp & I hold it's shape- chewy doughy crust is gross in my humble opinion- but thats just the southern in me.  Anyway onto the experience: 3 stars- Were immediately greeted. the restaurant is nicely decorated although I felt teh entrance was to cluttered and a little boxed in. teh girl who seated us had a half smile and although was very nice and seated us in a decent place she just didnt seem geniunely pleased to be there.  2 stars- Our waitress came right over and greeted us and let us know she would be right back to get our drink order. When she came and we all ordered water with lemon she seemed a little irritated that we did not order something charge worthy.   3 stars- We pondered over the menu trying to deciede if we were all going to get a pizza or order entrees. So while ponderig some more we order the Calamari- I am a huge fan of calamari and have eaten it in every place that offers it. Next she brings the bread basket and plates. there is no traditional oil and vinegar on the table so we asked for it. but discovered later that there was little butters in the bottom of the basket- nice to know once we almost finshed the bread.  2 stars- calamari comes and is enough for 2 but not 3 people. the breading was light and very bland! no seasoning AT ALL. the ring parts were super chewy! either old or previously frozen or maybe just over cooked. we added lemon to it that didnt help enough but adding salt did help a littlebit. the marinara itself was just fine- although olvies gross me out andi have a huge tomato end piece that was a little green. i also added a bit of red pepper flakes to the marinara which seemed to improve it! and I ate it on my bread so the marinara gets 3 stars!  3 stars- we ordered the montese pizza. now ive had proscuitto before but there was just something strange about this. it was sour tasting and EXTREMELY salty and very tough. i dont kno if it was the brand or not sliced thin enough or maybe have 3 slices together on each pizza slice or maybe every being baked made it so unappetizing. i only ate one piece of pizza. the 3 stars is only because hubby and daughter liked it ok, but were not jazzed about it.  overall experience is a 3 i guess. lets just say I was so hoping for the authentic flavors I would get when at my Italian (not a NEW YORK ONE but the real deal who barely spoke English and was here from Naples Italy about 2 years before opening his on place) brother in laws restaurant back in the 90's near my hometown.  dont know if we will return but definately wont get the pizza next time"}
{"text":"It's probably not completely fair to review a restaurant based on a take-out experience alone, but considering my take-out experience was a good one, I figured it was ok!  Craving some Italian food last night, but not wanting to bother with changing clothes, dealing with the Saturday night wait times, and sitting in a restaurant for hour or so, I used the search features on Yelp to help me find Portofinos.  They have a specific take-out menu online, so I figured that was a good sign that getting food to-go was an acceptable option here. The guy who took my phone order was friendly & efficient & recommended the house dressing for my salad (it was yummy!)  You pick up your food right inside the front door. I saw some pretty tasty looking pizzas being boxed up. And based on other Yelp reviews, I'll have to give that a try next time.  I got a ton of food! A generous side salad with decent toppings (tomatoes, cucumbers, carrots & olives; no cheese & no croutons, which is perfect for me). The chicken parmesan was great. Just what I was craving. It came with a large side of angel hair pasta & sauce. I had plenty for last night's dinner & enough for today's lunch.  If a restaurant can pull off a successful take-out dinner, I suspect dining in here would be equally good. I don't splurge on Italian food very often (lots of calories for this health nut!), but Portofinos will now be on my short list of south Charlotte restaurants to revisit."}
{"text":"This is one of the two better locations of the local Portofino's chain.  It's a nicely laid out and nicely decorated with an Italian village style (go figure!).    The food is consistently good here whether it's the lasagna, pizza or salad and they have a decent wine selection.  And I LOVE their house salad dressing here...here's a tomato based creamy Italian.  It's also good as a dipping sauce on the bread.  The only thing I didn't like is the servers seemed to be hawking over you in this location.  But the last time I was there, they weren't that busy so maybe they were looking for something to do."}
{"text":"The food has always been good especially the bolognese and lasagna.  Salads are good also.  Cheese steaks are awesome!  Only complaint I have is the service is not consistent.  I have had good ones and bad ones.  Most of the bad ones just needed more training.  This is not the kind of place for teenage servers.  Most are not familiar with the food.  I also recommend that you come early or later or your gonna wait.  It's is smaller than the Park Rd location and if you show up at peak time, you're gonna wait so expect it.  The restaurant needs to be larger to serve more guests."}
{"text":"Best Pizza in town!  Everything is really great.  Portions are HUGE...good to split or have great leftovers.  The house dressing is totally addictive."}
{"text":"Best marina sauce around.  nice patio seating.  great for quick lunch as well as casual dinners."}
{"text":"They only take reservations for parties of 6 or more which was fine.  We went on a Thursday night and while they were busy, we got right in at 8pm.  Don't worry that this is in a strip shopping area & if it's a nice evening sit on the patio!  Oh, we were oh so happy here!  Italian food is a staple for us like so many people and thank you Yelp community for all the reviews.  I really enjoy finding new restaurants & places to go through Yelp!  We sat on the patio...it's right off the parking lot, but they've really insulated it from most noises with the landscaping & you rarely even notice anyone walking by and we sat on the side closest to parking!  The patio is quiet, cozy & intimate with a fountain that adds a wonderful ambiance.  (I will make a quick note here to parents...please....restaurants are not places for your children to explore/play in)  The pasta dishes: Boscaiola 11.95 With prosciutto bits and fresh peas in a creamy pink sauce, wonderfully smoky and the Linguini was perfectly cooked and the Chicken Gorgonzola 15.95 Chicken breast saut√©ed with garlic and mushrooms in gorgonzola cream sauce...YUMMY!  My sweetie doesn't like gorgonzola, but it was done so well with a light touch that he enjoyed a bit or two!  It was nice they brought around the dessert tray for us to see!  We chose to split the Italian Rum Cake!  It is served chilled and it was a light and lightly sweet, wonderful end to the meal.  I didn't realize there were 4 of these restaurants in town... but I'm not surprised!  Our server was Sophia and she was just wonderfully friendly and bright and charming...she's a keeper!"}
{"text":"I never have had a bad experience here.  I usually get my food to go.  I really enjoy the generous portions of cheese with any noodle based dish.  This is also my favorite Americanized Italian food.  I used to live in Buffalo and this food reminds me of that place.  Robust flavors, robust portions, reasonable prices.  I don't think you can go wrong here no matter what you order.  I stick to the lasagna, Alfredo, and baked Ziti."}
{"text":"Portofino's is one of my favorite in Charlotte.  Good NY style pizza is always a hit, but the real draw is the amazing homemade style sauces used for their various pasta and other Italian dishes.  My favorite dish is their Chicken Parm.  The dining area is small and a bit cramped and the wait for a table during dinner can be long, but once seated the service is fine and you can also call ahead as their take out service is efficient and the prices are reasonable.  Based on multiple visits and take out orders."}
{"text":"This is my favorite local Pizza! Fast, hot, and delicious.   They have some small seating areas but I have never utilized them, I mostly pick up from the counter or opt for delivery, which are usually very quick!  I also appreciate that they now have online ordering. I have ordered pizza for both pickup and delivery via the website, at times where it was not possible or convenient to use the phone. It's a great feature that I'm glad they've added."}
{"text":"This is one of my several times at a Portofino's. My boyfriend and I decided to go here for our date night, since I haven't been to this location before. Plus, we love going to new restaurants. The outside of the building looks very nice, but it is very crammed once you go inside. There is hardly any room, especially when there are multiple people standing around waiting. I did love that you could see them baking the pizza's though, I always love to watch stuff like that. However, the hostess was pretty rude. I didn't appreciate that all too much.  We had a pretty good seat once we got placed, and our waitress was extremely friendly. It did take a long time though just to be able to get our drinks, salads, and the bread however. But it was worth the wait, they were simply delicious. I ordered the Penne Pomodoro, and it wasn't at all what I was expecting. I didn't like it too much. Overall, we had a pretty good experience. Hardly any wait, and the food was pretty standard. A little pricey though."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place! This is the best Pizza in Pittsburgh, hands-down.   XL Mushrooms, Anchovies & Black Olives!   My only complaint is that they don't deliver to Brighton Heights. Why did I move??"}
{"text":"Portofinos is so good. I've gone there 3 times this week. I have fallen in love with in there bolognaise."}
{"text":"Since the first day Portofino has opened its doors, I got to eat there 3 times. First 2 times I went by myself. It went pretty smooth, good food and training staff, no problem. On my last visit on this past Sunday I took my wife, my son and my friend whose visiting out of town to here. My wife has celiac. She called ahead to make sure that they serve something gluten free.  She got the gluten free bolognese pasta. We triple asked the servers to make sure it's gluten free. They all said yes. I tasted the GF pasta which tasted just like regular pasta but staff said it's GF. So she ate it.  She's been having stomach cramps and all her system is screwed up now. What she ate wasn't GF, they served regular penne pasta to her.   Even though my experience was decent this visit ruined it for us."}
{"text":"Portofinos is one of my favorite Italian restaurants in the Charlotte area.    There are multiple locations.  The Park Road location has indoor seating and a really nice outdoor patio.  I went with my father-in-law and husband after the PGA championship.  We ordered a meat and cheese plate for appetizer, the chicken fettuccine to split, and my father in law got the veal marsala.  Our service was excellent and so was all of our food!  Our waitress brought out bread, vinegar, and oil to start.  We will always come back to portofinos!"}
{"text":"My family and I came in here for dinner today. Our waitress was a latino woman in her late 40s. She was very bland, did not introduce herself, and when I asked for recommendations as I've never ate there, she acted like she didn't know what I was saying. Then, we noticed after she took our order that our food was supposed to come with a side. She never offered a side nor did she show the sides. We ordered a small pizza for the kids, chicken marsala, and piccante. The food took about an hour to come out so we asked for it to go. When I got home to eat, the meals lacked flavor and our marsala and piccante were so dry that you could eat it with the noodles. I will NEVER go back. A total waste of $47!"}
{"text":"The best Italian in Charlotte.  Period.  I have been going there on Sunday night for 20 years.  The food, the people and the ambience cannot be replaced by any other restaurant I have ever frequented."}
{"text":"Great fresh food and nice environment. Clean and waiter was very attentive. Highly recommended. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We went to the location at Arboretum on Friday at around 8:00. We were able to walk right in and get a seat. There were a lot of choices on the menu. We tried a tomato garlic salad dressing upon our waiter's suggestion and it was pretty good. We also tried the house Italian dressing which I found to have a distinct olive flavor to it which I didn't care much for - I don't like olives but usually this is not a problem with other dressings. We got hot bread included which was good - it was soft - very much like a Pillsbury french bread roll. For the entrees I got the Pasta Sorrento and he got the Veal Parmigiana. I liked my dish - he loved his. The portions were large - we both had about half of our food leftover. Overall, the service was very good and the food was good. I would not say that this is my favorite Italian restaurant but it I did like it."}
{"text":"Authentic, tasty and hearty Italian cookin that even my wonderful, Italian grandma wouldn't mind diving into - and that's saying a lot. Yes, my grandmother is one of the best cooks in the world (major bias, I'm sure) but Portofino's throws down some damn tasty eats.  I stopped by Portofino's to catch up with a friend over a casual lunch. While their menu looked pretty enticing I went with their lunch special \"bake\": two jumbo stuffed shells, one manicotti, baked and covered in meat sauce. While I can't get grandma's cookin' in Charlotte, this was a very solid substitute! The shells and manicotti were perfectly cooked (not overly so) and stuffed with delicious ricotta. And the sauce - purty tasty too - although I would have been delighted with another manicotti and less sauce. But that's just personal preference!  The service was friendly and attentive and I never went without at least a half-full beverage. Plus, the prices are pretty affordable - my bake was $7.95. Not bad! I absolutely want to come back and try their 'za and maybe a whole tray of desserts. Nom!"}
{"text":"$9 for a delicious grilled chicken salad. Flavorful and healthy! Comes with marinated vegetables on top! Fresh homemade ranch. Small loaf of bread included. Owners are super sweet!!! Takeout ready in 10 minutes. Gladly support this business!"}
{"text":"Wow the best calamari I believe I've ever had. Perfectly seasoned. I didn't need hot sauce or anything. I don't eat marinara but I did try it and it was ok.  The bread they serve you is great. Crusty on the outside soft on the inside. For my birthday lunch I got linguine and clams in a white wine sauce. Different from any white wine sauce I've ever had but delicious. Will bring my husband back to try some pizza."}
{"text":"This is now the main pie shop I order from since I moved over here. Their Buffalo Chicken Pizza is soooo awesome. I have since also tried all the styles of pie and they are all pretty good. I'm not a fan of Chicago Style but, eat some tums and we're good to go . . ha"}
{"text":"We have been patron of this restaurant for 20 years. We dined Sunday night 12/11 for my husbands birthday. We cannot believe the reduced portion sizes. The food is still delicious but the baked pasta dish portions have been cut in half recently. What a disappointment."}
{"text":"I have discovered Portofinos after a coworker got some takeout for lunch.  I have been there three times in three days!   Having grown up in the Philadelphia suburbs, I know what it takes to be a good cheesesteak.  The closest I've ever come was Jersey Mike's, but their cheesesteaks are only meh.  Here, I can order one just like I did back home - a large cheesesteak with mushrooms and pizza sauce.  The rolls are just as good as Amarosos, the amount of steak is very close to what you'd get in Philly, and the cheese, mushrooms, and sauce are enough to complement without overtaking the steak.  By far, the best I've had outside of home.  I can already tell this is going to be a dangerous place for me!  I need to hit the gym twice as hard if I'm going to eat there more often."}
{"text":"Small location and packed! They make me off the menu linguine and broccoli and it is possibly the best I've ever had! Don't forget to check out the awesome specials"}
{"text":"I went here for dinner last night and was excited to try it after it had been recommended to me. I ordered the chicken parmesan and it was okay. The chicken tasted like it wasn't seasoned at all. It was mostly cheese and breading and very little chicken. The sauce was also very acidic and salty and lacking in flavor. It tasted like it was just pur√©ed tomatoes and salt. The salad and Italian dressing that I had with my meal was also unappealing. Our service was also very slow and they got a few orders wrong at our table."}
{"text":"Canned mushrooms on a pizza? Seriously?  Hello Potifino's....1980 called and wants their canned ingredients back.  We scraped the garbage toppings off the pizza only to find poor quality cheese, sauce (probably prepackaged as well) and tasteless dough.   Was really hoping for better considering the wait line on a Saturday night. More proof that food sucks outside Charlotte. If this place was near competition it would go out of business quickly."}
{"text":"Out of this world!  Superb!  The food was excellent, atmosphere friendly and workers very time efficient."}
{"text":"Nice place.  I've been twice, and the food is always good. The atmosphere is nice, too.  However, this time, there were supplies all over the place, as if they ran out of room or something.  I stared at two spray bottles of cleaner on the half-wall beside our table the entire time.  Kinda weird. The italian dishes are great, and they always have a few specials that are not Italian (steak, fish, etc.).  The prices are reasonable, too.   Their wine selection isn't the best, but it's not awful, and they're not marking the wine up 400% like most restaurants, either. The few times per year that I'm in the mood for Italian, Portofino's will definitely be in my top two choices."}
{"text":"The food here us not bad and we use to come here with a certain frequency. Tiday was an awful service experience, with an disinterested waiter, who barely knew the menu. 15 minutes to tell us that the pizza I ordered can't be done how I ordered it is not cool and very disappointing. Here's hoping for a better experience to others who venture here."}
{"text":"I had Zuppa de Pex and it was superb! Great Italian bread served with seasoned olive oil and balsamic...  Bobby had the chicken Parmesan and said the chicken was moist and tender with a light crust and excellent marinara."}
{"text":"The husband and I went here last night for dinner. We shared the large antipasti salad, the shrimp scampi pasta, and the clams casino. All were excellent and we left very happy. The house dressing is awesome...Not sure if I want to know what's in it, it's so good :) Service was very attentive. Food came out quick and food and wine prices are reasonable. What else can you ask for?? Definitely give it a try"}
{"text":"Yeah, their pizza is pretty friggin' good.  Came here after a round of golf and it was the best food ever.  Shared a large margherita(sp?) pizza and it was cooked to perfection.  Mozarella was melted evenly and tasted very good.  The tomato slices on top were not too thick nor too thin.  Bartender was attentive and made sure to refill our drinks.   Place looked busy and understandably so.  I'm sleepy--hopefully I dream of this place!  dmo out."}
{"text":"Great pizza, subs and even salads. Can't go wrong with anything on the menu. The wait time on the weekends can be a little bit insane though."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite Italian restaurant in Charlotte! From the bread, to the salad, entrees, pizza - the best! Service is consistently good and the prices are very reasonable. I'm from NJ where there are good, authentic Italian restaurant on every corner and Portofino's definitely measures up."}
{"text":"I am so disappointed.  Have ordered from here for years.  Used to be very good pizza.  Not today.  Maybe new management???  We were quoted 40-45 minutes for delivery.  I called after more than an hour and was told it was on  its way. Promised it was going to be hot since it was in the delivery bag.  After another 15 minutes (I only live 7 minutes from the store) I called again.  I asked for a credit or something since the rest of our dinner was getting cold.  The woman who claimed to be the owner/manager said she could only give me money back if I refuse the order.  She said it was not her fault and threw her driver under the bus.  She said If we eat it, full price.  When it arrived the pizza was NOT delivery bag and it was cold.  Will never order from here again -- too many other places to get good pizza for good price in good time."}
{"text":"Average food at decent prices. I can't speak for the Italian entrees, which they looked good. We had the pizza and a cheesesteak.  Pizza sauce was a little bland. NY style, fold over pizza. Cheesesteak was OK, nothing special. I would return to try some of the pastas. The service was excellent."}
{"text":"Store front restaurant is small, casual and usually crowded. We ordered the cheese garlic bread for an appetizer and it was huge!  Also, the Italian Wedding soup with  lots of meatballs in chicken broth.   I had Chicken Sorrento with gluten free pasta.  Chicken was tender with eggplant, peas, tomatoes covered with cheese.   The wait staff was attentive, smelled awesome and the place was clean."}
{"text":"My boss' favorite Italian restaurant when he travels here. We even had our sales meeting here and were very well treated. We sat at the tables outside and were treated to great wine, fresh tasting food, and delicious salads.   My only mediocre note was the dessert-but we really didn't have much room anyway!"}
{"text":"I heard coworkers say it's such a great Italian restaurant but I'm not impressed , the flavor was lacking and the pasta was definitely not fresh . The service gave this Italian spot 2stars . My family wanted to ask for ketchup for their sauces :( . Well , maybe the pizza is good ?"}
{"text":"Awesome family spot. Great Italian dishes. Always fresh and delicious. It all starts with a good red sauce."}
{"text":"LOVE. Portofino.  The Italian food is by far the best I've had in charlotte.  I know nothing of it's history, but I know the owner is from Italy and I can tell.  Several Italians were dining with us and it was really cool to see.    I ordered the Mediterano and hubs ordered the gorgonzola tortellini. Both were excellent and came out hot.  Portion sizes are huge and the flavor is oh so good.  Catering and take out are also available."}
{"text":"The best Italian in charlotte! Their house dressing is good, but their lasagna is to die for!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Their spinach and feta white pizza is amazing, I've been ordering it from them for at least a decade.  Truly awesome.  Everything else is above average, but the white pizza really is the best thing on the menu.  yum!"}
{"text":"Portofino's really hit the spot last night. I was craving some good italian, and not just pizza.  Don't be fooled by the shopping center, the place is quite spacious and they have a lovely patio. After some wine and chatting at a friend's house, we headed over to Portofino's for a late dinner. It was perfect, because when we got there, there was no wait and the weather was perfect for dinner on the patio (although it was a bit dark, they could use a couple more patio lights).  Our server was friendly and attentive. He gave us some time to look over the menus and didn't rush us. The menu is pretty diverse, with all kinds of options, and I definitely had trouble narrowing it down (I knew I wanted pasta, but wasn't sure what kind of sauce, all the choices looked great!). I finally just asked him for a recommendation, and he recommended the bascaiola. It sounded great and I couldn't make up my mind, so I ran with that (on top of penne). The restaurant was also super accommodating to my friend who is gluten free, and made her a special risotto (the special of the day was a veal risotto and she didn't want veal, so they took their chicken sorrento and subbed risotto for capelleni).   Our meals came with bread basket and salad. The salad was basic, and was the perfect size for a starter (a tad too many carrots). The bread was warm and crusty. My pasta was delicious; the sauce had great flavor, there was a ton of prosciutto and peas, and the serving was huge. I actually just ate some of the leftovers for lunch, and it was still just as good the next day!  I'm definitely adding Portofino's to my go-to list."}
{"text":"I have never been to this location before and I liked it.  The inside was very cozy and inviting.  The hostess greeted us right away and there was no wait.  The waitress was just wonderful!  She was attentive and helpful throughout the entire meal.  I ordered what I always get from their Eastway location: fettuccini with spicy marinara!  I'm a little boring, I know...but it's just so good.  I love spicy food and this sauce is great.  It tasted even better than the other location, more fresh.  The food came out quickly and I have no complaints!  I would love to come back when I am on the area."}
{"text":"Well, I had ordered from Portofino's since I received one of their menus in the mail.  I'm new to the Crafton area so finding my go to pizza place is a must.  I try to find the best of the best wherever I go so when I moved to Crafton, the search was on.  I had tried a couple places before discovering Portofino's...I didn't realize they were the place I had passed by many times prior to moving here...very convenient spot off Steuben St.  So, when I got the menu in the mail, I decided to try it.  I ordered an Antipasto Salad, which I've grown very fond of...it's the ham, salami And cheese that bring it over the top.  I had gotten the pretzel bites, which, for the price were a little short on size and portion...but good.  I had gone to Supremo's Pizzeria in Ross Twp, and their pretzel bites are, sorry to say, better.  But I ordered a hot Italian hoagie which the bread was crisp on the outside but soft on the inside, with a good portion of meats and cheese.  I ordered a pizza too and actually was very happy with the size and portion.  The toppings were plenty and the crust was crisp and not droopy like some other places.  The only disappointment was that my most recent order, I ordered a bottle of Diet Coke, and t didn't come with my order...can't eat pizza without a soda (pop).  I can't bring myself to call it pop...I'm not from Pittsburgh originally, so I call it soda.  Crafton has a several choices for pizza, but do give this place a try...I like it..."}
{"text":"Solid Portofino Pie. Not the best in town - and nowhere near the worst. But I like my 'fino's better.  Something about this super-clean Tuscan decor job, complete with painterly mural work, foliage-a-dangling, and faux columns in awkward places (not unlike the Eastway outpost) is amusing when it's in one of the most thug life strip malls in town. When it's part of this newfangled City Square stuff it just boils over into pretentious-ville.    Pie is good, tho."}
{"text":"Portofino's is decent place to go - once. I liked their pasta and the service was decent although the waitress could not understand most of what I asked and I couldn't understand most of what she said. But she was trying hard to make sure we were okay and that was nice. This place is over priced for the food quality and the menu which is pretty basic. If you're looking for value for money  I would look elsewhere.  I might go get their pasta again but not any time soon. I dont like places that try to be upscale but end up being only high end in their prices while the food quality and menu innovation remain stagnant."}
{"text":"We recently moved to Charlotte, and so far this is the most authentic Italian food we found around. Me and my hubby we eat at this location at least twice at week, love it ."}
{"text":"There was a bit of a wait on a Friday night which was unexpected because I didn't think they received so much business. Now, I know why! Excellent service, flavorful food, and gigantic proportions. I had enough food for dinner that night, lunch the next day and dinner again! Great value for the price."}
{"text":"Disappointing. We drove 30 minutes out of the way for a good lunch, but it wasn't a good lunch. Problems:  - Very small portion for Chicken parmigiana - Very cold and dark in front room (we don't know why they put us in this room, or why they didn't turn the lights on) - Waiter was decent at service but looked unhappy to be there - Waitress tried to help stack plates at end of meal, which was a nice gesture but she stalked every single plate right at the edge of the table less than an inch from my lap (it was awkward) - Pizza was average at best. Nothing special it all in regards to flavor or crust  Good Points:  - Bread with butter"}
{"text":"I went here for lunch this past week and had a pasta with grilled salmon. It was incredible! My friend had a Philly cheesesteak and it looked so good. It was my first time and I ant wait to try more menu items."}
{"text":"Get a pizza maybe other wise hang it up the place claims to have Italian food, please.  Bartender is a pretentious prick and the entre's are way over priced and trust they all taste the same. Never again!"}
{"text":"The penne ala vodka, though not on the menu is not disappointing and the tiramisu is one of the biggest portions of dessert I've ever seen. The atmosphere is nice and the food is very good although I would've liked more than one breast in my chicken parm. Their red sauce though, which is as important as anything at an Italian restaurant, is very very good."}
{"text":"Their pizza is great. I lived in NYC and have also spent a good amount of time in Italy. I feel I can be the judge of a damn good pizza now."}
{"text":"I must say, we found this place last minute, and I'm glad we did. The location was very nice looking, in a fancy Harris Teeter anchored shopping center.  There were a lot of people there and that really added to the atmosphere.  Our server was awesome.  He was a super nice guy, had the authentic Italian accent, and was on it all night.  We began our meal with plenty of delicious wine, alongside a a plate of fried calamari.  It was a little bit undercooked and under seasoned for me.   I opted for the special, the surf n turf.  The lobster tail was cooked perfectly.  It was so so good.  I haven't had that good of lobster in a long time.  It came with a ribeye steak, which was cooked great also.  The only down side for me was that it was probably only a 1/2 inch steak.  When I get a steak, I want thickness.  It's the only way to get that beautiful chargrilled outside with that perfect pink inside.  I would definitely recommend this one to friends.  My one caveat was the drive, so next go around I think I'm definitely going to have to check out the original location, off of eastway.  Originals are always the best.  Am I right?"}
{"text":"Well helllllo Italian delight!!  This place knows what they are doing when it comes to the lunch-size cheese steaks.  I can't attest to the dinner platters just yet, but this is a definite place to stop for a semi quick lunch.  I had the 11 inch cheese steak with onions and it was superb.  Like most sandwiches, the bread is what makes the difference.  It was right on point and perfectly toasted.  Give it a try and you will not be disappointed.    PS.  I just started at a new job and my co-workers thought they would haze me.  They forced me to finish the massive cheese steak in one sitting.  Little did they know, like the cow, I have a four chamber stomach and threw down that sandwich with some fries.  They brought their halves home in a doggy bag.  Enormous portion size!  Thanks Brad/Seth.  Enjoy..     -Ian M."}
{"text":"I've eaten here probably 5 times at this point, maybe more. The people here are very friendly and the food is good. I've had pasta and pizza dishes. All very good! Today I ordered the baked ziti. As usual it was very good. My only complaint, and it's minor, is that the red sauce is sweet. I wish they'd temper it a little more. Always worth a visit."}
{"text":"Last night after driving 4 hours with a 1 yr old. Then dinner, her & I both agree the chicken sorrento was absolutely fabulous. The serving size is perfect, enough to fill up up & then some to marinate over night for the next day. I can hardly wait. And my wife equally enjoyed her dinner, but I can't remember what she got & I'm not going to wake her up to ask. ; )"}
{"text":"Food was excellent here. Kids loved the pasta and the garlic bread. I enjoyed the pizza (and this is coming from a NYer)."}
{"text":"We were celebrating my Daughter being selected as the Teacher of the year for Charlotte Mecklenburg school district so there were 15 people in our group.  After the awards ceremony we headed to Portofino's without a reservation.  It was crowded but we were seated promptly on the front porch. The wait staff worked with us to seat our party of 15! They quickly pushed tables together and directed us how to sit so that everyone was together.  It was tight but we were delighted to all sit together.    Our dinner orders were taken quickly by a very patient and professional server who got every order right the first time!  He quickly rolled off the list of specials and seeing the size of our group offered us the lunch menu which contained more sandwiches.  All of the food ordered arrived together and the presentation was appetizing.  I wanted to try everybody's food but just asked for a thumbs up from our group.  All 15 gave their food two thumbs up.  My daughter had the Cheese Steak from the lunch menu.  You can customize your steak sandwich about 7 different ways and there are a number of subs, cold sandwiches, baked dishes, fish etc.  I can't wait to come back for lunch.  I had the Grilled Salmon Salad for $11.95.  It comes with mixed greens topped with grilled salmon and marinated vegetables.  The salmon was cooked perfectly, moist but seared.  You can't go wrong with a basic salmon salad at this point if your salad greens are fresh and your dressing is delicious. Score for Portofino's on both!  My husband had the same salad with Grilled Chicken.  He says the  chicken was very moist and well seasoned.   To top it off at the end of the meal the servers brought my daughter a Tiramisu with a candle to celebrate her accomplishments.  It was a delightful experience and I will definitely be back to visit one of the three locations in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Last night was my first time at Portofino's. I ordered the Chicken Tarantino, it came out looking pretty good but when I bit into the chicken it was bland and on the dry side. My wife ordered Gorgonzola Chicken which was probably the best dish at the table but still sub par to what I've had in the past. The waiter kindly asked the chef to make Chicken Francese for my daughter (it's her favorite food) which they kindly agreed to do but unfortunately it came out extremely dry and didn't taste anything like Chicken Francese other than someone squeezing some lemon juice over the top of it. My daughter who normally eats two servings at home took only a single bite and didn't touch it again. I'm hoping I had a bad experience as the service was delightful and the atmosphere of the restaurant was great but the food was not anywhere close to being as good as I expected."}
{"text":"Portofino's is definitely the neighborhood Italian go to for us! My boyfriend and I have gone here several times and it never fails to please. It is the type of Italian food that both Italians and non-Italians will appreciate because of the genuine taste. I'm very particular about my Italian food (because no ones ever beats my mother and grandmother's cooking) but they have the foundation of great food starting with their gravy (red sauce), warm atmosphere, and the generous portions they give you.  Every time I come to Portofino's I get the eggplant parm (since it is one of my favorite dishes) and a Lady Cello cocktail. I can rarely finish the entire entree in one sitting, and if I do I need to practically be rolled out. I am pretty sure they use an entire eggplant and marry it with gravy and cheese galore. Talking about this makes me want to sneak to the fridge and take out my leftovers.... ;)   Though I stick to my tried and true eggplant parm, my boyfriend has worked his way through at least half of the menu at this point and it has all been great. His personal favorite is the shrimp parm. You will always get freshly baked bread with your meal and a lot of dishes come with a  side salad, and for that I totally suggest the house dressing!!   The environment is always casual and laid back. Some nights the dinner rush causes a bit of a wait, especially on the weekends, but we have never had to wait too exceptionally long. The service is not always five star but we have never had any significant issues and everyone has always been friendly. The quality of the Italian feast you get makes up for the sometimes slow service.   Know going in that this is not a high dollar environment and they are not aiming to wow you with white linens and crystal, however they do want you to get a real feel of what Italian food can truly bring you: an insanely full stomach, comfort, warmth, wine, cocktails, laughs, and a casual place to enjoy your family and friends. That's what Italians are all about. :) Try it out!"}
{"text":"Been a long time since we went to a Portofino's because there wasn't one close to us. Now that there is, we were excited. To be fair, we didn't eat a wide variety. We had the Stromboli and salad and the wife and I split it. We thought it was very good. Would suggest the salad be served on a cold plate but other than that, what we had was good.  Service was good - not stellar but also training people at the time."}
{"text":"Our table had the Chicken Sorrento, Stuffed Eggplant, and Margherita Pizza. The chicken was super tender and delicious, the eggplant was a tasty way to get in some veggies, and the pizza was just the right amount of crispy and chewy. Our waiter, Gary, was fun, attentive and helpful. Thanks for a very enjoyable experience.   One note about parking: during busy times, parking can be tough because the small lot serves lots of businesses. It's worth a little bit of frustration, though, so just wait for someone to leave the grocery store and take their spot!"}
{"text":"Good food and service--Italian, pretty straight forward and nothing to really stand out.  The portions are decent and the price is good.  They did offer several specials., but we went with the standard lasagna and chicken parmesan.  One thing I liked is the entrees come with a side salad and plenty of bread. We brought our own wine, and thy do charge a $9 cork fee, which is better than most places.  My dining companion remembered the place as being cozier, but the lights are pretty bright.  Dim the lights and maybe some candles.  Good food, but not sure if warrants another visit."}
{"text":"The food was great. I ordered the shrimp scampi pasta other guest in my party ordered the shrimp parm, chicken portofino, chicken parm, and a pasta dish. Our service wasn't really there I've had better but I'll definitely return when I'm in the Charlotte area"}
{"text":"Delicious Italian food. Great pizzas and good tortellini Alfredo! Family atmosphere and good wait staff."}
{"text":"We where in the mood for Italian. You know the place is good when you don't understand half the menu. Rated it 4 start because the menu is a bit confusing as in what the Italian names mean, like your not sure what kind of dish it is."}
{"text":"Their food quality has gone down and their prices have gone up. The people who work here are not very friendly and seem annoyed to help you.    The positive is they usually deliver your food there in a half hour or less unless you order on a Friday or Saturday then it's closer to an hour.   I wouldn't recommend ordering online due to all of the issues they've had with their online ordering software. We were recently double charged and were given a hard time by Portofino's staff. They were not helpful and dismissed it.   All around just a poor way to do business and unfortunately lackluster food."}
{"text":"Went to Portofino's for lunch with a few coworkers and we all enjoyed our meals and experience!  We got there at about 11:45 and I'm glad we did, because as we were leaving there was a line out the door... That must say something for this restaurant!  The sever was really quick to get our drink order and to take our meal order once she brought our drinks.  She told us about three lunch specials that all sounded delicious but I decided to order off the menu.  I ordered a side salad to start out with Witt he house dressing and the shrimp scampi for my meal.  One of my coworkers ordered the chicken and vegetable lasagne that was one of the lunch specials and my other co- worker ordered the linguine pasta with arrabbiata sauce.    Our side salads were delicious and very fresh!  I loved that they put green olives on the salad...different but good (if you like olives)!  The house dressing is really good and tastes even better with the warm bread they bring with your meal!  The shrimp scampi was probably some of the best I've ever had!  I chose the linguine as my pasta choice and it was perfectly al dente!  The shrimp were huge and fresh!  I could only eat half my meal and it was still good the next day reheated!  My coworker offered me a bite of his lasagna...now I see what everyone was talking about in the previous reviews!  Amazing!  It must be on special a lot and I could see why!  My other coworker enjoyed his dish as well (he ate it too fast for me to swipe a bite)!  All in all I love Portofino's and can't wait to go back again!!"}
{"text":"Tried to order 2 hoagie special at 7:45 pm and was called back shortly after by a very sweet young lady by the name of Kelly and informed they were out of Hoagies and had one left?? Ok first thing i wanted to ask was how do you run out of your 2nd most popular item?? But my wife was ok if they replaced with a meatball calzone. Phoned back and my wife was greeted by a very rude man whose name we didnt catch. She informed him that the meatball calzone and the one hoagie would be fine. He proceeded to argue with her and told her that it would cost more than our original order for that one item. We told him to proceed to refund our debit card for the order. And he still felt the need to argue with her about it. Dont bother with this one unless you want yelled at."}
{"text":"Okay, since my review in 2013, I have been back several times and Portofino's definitely deserves an update/upgrade. So, as for the pizza. I recommend just ordering a small pizza rather than a slice at lunch because they do have some good darn pizza. I have tried multiple toppings including green peppers, olives, shrimp and have loved them all. I also have enjoyed their specialty pizzas too.  Note: I do order my pizza extra crisply. That way the dough is cooked just right and the crust is a little crispy! As for their entrees, you cannot go wrong with anything they offer. They have a variety of specials every night, but if you want to stick with a standard I recommend the Chicken Parmigiana, Shrimp Scampi (expect a garlic flavor) or the Meat Ravioli.  Service is always spot on, from the hostesses, bartenders, waiters and wait staff. Portofino's is my go to spot for good Italian and great prices in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Bravo!  Viva Portofino's!  Great pizza, truly a gem in the Arboretum neighborhood.  The fact that the price is reasonable only makes the value that Portofino's gives you that much better.  Service is great, and the Italian accent coming from behind the counter is like a warm blanket reassuring you that your food will take longer than usual, but will be worth every extra second you have to wait for it.  It is crowded, be warned!  Don't expect to swing by on a Friday evening for a quick bite.  Such is the price you have to pay when your food is so delish!"}
{"text":"Went with party of five on a Saturday night. Great service and good food. Had chicken parmigiana and pizza. Lots of food for the money and you always feel welcomed."}
{"text":"Food was good, not phenomenal. Service was good. Very clean. Overall enjoyed the experience."}
{"text":"Pretty good food, I gave a 3 star because my take out order was wrong... I will definitely go back, but I will go in to order takeout instead of calling..."}
{"text":"A Charlotte, Southpark neighborhood restaurant frequented by locals. This restaurant does not deserve a 4-5 rating. Average food, I can smoke these guys in my kitchen at home, but my kitchen was 500 miles away today. Big portions, I had the Chicken Taratino with Angel Hair Pasta $14.95. Weak side salad with dated ingredients. Yes, the meal was okay, but overpriced for the level of quality. The wine list was intriguing with all Italian wines. I had the Velenosi Brecciarolo 2002 and found it to be excellent. Great wine prices on wines you might not know about. It did irritate me that they serve wine in the small cheap wine glasses that only hold 3-4 ounces when not completely filled. My issue is price value. Lets stack it up, Mini shopping center location, good service, but very average food at somewhat inflated prices. They have Serv Safe Certification (displayed on the wall in the bar) which is is good. Big pizza carry out business. Pizza is cooked in a deck oven, so off to a good start.  I liked the service and the staff was friendly. This is not a BAM!...sorry!! See my other review for a serious Italian alternative in Charlotte."}
{"text":"there is better italian restaurant than this the food is mediocre I had veal marsala i taste garlic my son had alfredo with a ton of garlic too I am sorry to cook italian you don't put garlic in every dish my wife order tiramisu was frozen in the middle no thanks never again"}
{"text":"We found Portofinos a few months ago and have been back many times since.  The food is delicious, the service is wonderful with knowledgeable servers who can help point you in the right direction if you are caught in that enviable position where you can't decide between the three items on the menu that sound incredible.    The music is just right and the cold, crunchy salad and the warm bread just give you an idea of the wonderful things to come.    The chicken parm is out of this world and is a steady favorite for me while my wife tries something different each time all with the same end result that Portofino's on Park Road in one of our favorite restaurants in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Everyone is raving about how great this place is. I've been to twice, but each time, the food was decent and service was good, but not mesmerizing... It is open from lunch all day, so if I happened to be around and wanted to go somewhere at an odd hr (say 3pm), I go here. Maybe I haven't tried enough on the menu yet, but so far, everything seems average to me."}
{"text":"Portofino's nails it with delicious food, great/prompt service and a nice atmosphere. I've been to both locations for lunch, but this will be just for the one off Park.   We arrived at about 1:30pm for lunch, which is sometimes an awkward time to eat at a restaurant; the lunch rush is over, the cook is ready to prep for dinner and the servers are ready for their shift to slow down! Fortunately, we were promptly seated at a great table outside by the fountain. Our server was pretty knowledgeable of the food and seemed to have actually tasted all of them. She couldn't quite pronounce gnocchi in the specials, but the food and service was so good it didn't really matter!  I had my \"usual\" the boscaiola with penne and their great side salad with house dressing. The dressing is very light, but delish. The bread is always warm and crusty (crusty good, not \"I wore these jeans 20 times before I washed them\" crusty). And that boscaiola sauce is like heaven on a plate!!! The peas! The prosciutto! The creaminess! It all comes together in an amazingly perfect way that leaves you wishing the plate had more than the 4 servings it comes with! BEWARE! You will want to eat all of it! Try to resist and take some home! I highly recommend adding some crushed red pepper flake to the sauce if you give it a go, adds a nice kick! My co-worker had the special portobello ravioli, planned on saving a couple to take home, but couldn't resist the deliciousness!  I highly recommend Portofino's. The food is great and even if the staff can't pronounce all of the food on the menu, they're all still great!"}
{"text":"Disclaimer: I am not Italian.   I feel like I have to get that out of the way because Italians are some of the most opinionated foodies I've ever met in my entire life and HEAVEN FORBID I say something ignorant about their cuisine. So here is a review from a born and raised southern gal with an appreciation for  all things that come in marinara sauce:  I really like Portofino's. I had the luck of working in the same shopping center as this particular location and it quickly became my go-to for my lunch (great specials) and dinner options. I can tell that this is much closer to an authentic style of food than a lot of other mainstream Italian places and it has definitely helped me to refine my expectations.   All of their pasta dishes are phenomenal (OH- and as an added bonus- a New Yorker Italian friend of mine said that this was the best pasta he's had in Charlotte- so take his word if you have to). I also really enjoy their pizzas (the white pizza with spinach is perfect). The only thing I wasn't crazy about were their sandwich options- but I didn't spend my time trying to familiarize myself with this portion of their menu like I did everything else.   Good food. Super quick with orders to go. I would give 4.5 stars but apparently that's not an option."}
{"text":"One of those places I have to eat at every once in a while.  I've had a few different items on the menu and sampled a few of my wife's selections over the years, and everything has been phenomenal.  Easily one of the best Italian restaurants in Charlotte, the service is always above average and the food is appropriately priced.  I personally recommend.  - If you get salad, the only way to go is their house dressing. - Stromboli, it's huge, it's meaty, and it's cheesy, what else do you want? - Nothing washes down a nice Italian dinner better than a glass of Chianti. So have two."}
{"text":"Yesterday was my first time eating here. I sat outside. The food was delicious, fast service, and our server and the staff kept checking on our table to ensure we were taken care off. Definitely going back."}
