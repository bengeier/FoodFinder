{"text":"Best Korean BBQ in AZ! We just moved back after living on the east coast and touring Asia. This place is Amazing!"}
{"text":"The service was fast and staff were very happy and welcoming. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Overpriced! Atmosphere wasn't warm the service was not up to par the server was not knowledgeable about the food on the menu. Went to a place in Southern California food was great portions were great and less expensive than this place in Chandler Arizona and they didn't do a mandatory gratuity for four people how ridiculous!!! they jipped themselves I would have given more of a tip because that's the way I am not just 18% TIPPER! Won't try again....to bad.:-("}
{"text":"I just called this place to ask about the buffet and the woman said there wasn't one.. I saw the website earlier so either she had no clue where she works or didn't know what the website said but SHE HUNG UP ON ME!! I called back for a manager and she said they don't work tonight!! A manager?? Will not be visiting this place AT ALL!! Thanks lady for losing a potential customer!!"}
{"text":"The beef was good , didn't change out the grill as often as I am use to ..
Not a big selection on sides with grill.
Coming from BBQ in Los Angeles I have High expectations..
Good for first timer ..."}
{"text":"Food was very good and we had fun cooking up the various meats and other mix-ins, but service left a lot to be desired."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good. There are not a lot of Korean BBQ spots in Arizona that actually have grills. We sat in a nice booth and the table had a grill. The side dishes are not as good as other places. The meats were delicious. Overall we enjoyed this place and will be going back."}
{"text":"This place was amazing. For my boyfriends birthday, it settled everyone in nicely. The staff are friendly and some speak English perfectly. The food was amazing and the best part was being able to grill your own food. I gave it four stars because the tables were a little cramped if you had a lot of food to cook. And there was no one else there but us, you would expect some place as amazing as this to be hoping with hungry costumers."}
{"text":"This is one of my family's favorite places to go for Friday night fun...great service accompanied by consistently good food."}
{"text":".....I'm embarrassed to even say I went to eat here. That's how horrible it is. 

Atmosphere: not enough ventilation for a bbq joint. Only 1 of 4 burners we had were working properly so we had to ask the kitchen to prepare our meats.

Price: overpriced for the quality of foods. Your required to order a minimum of 2 of the kalbi and bulgogi which is $30+ an order but when you cook it it's less than a small Plate of meat for 2. I guess I'm used to California portions. 

Food: I think if we had the opportunity to grill our own meats to the doneness of how we like it - it would have tasted ok. My kids came to dinner bc they offered sushi.. They didn't have sushi at all. Hot stone wasn't even hot stone it was rice no crispy under bottom. 

Service: we asked for a couple minutes to look at the menu and the waitress never came back. My husband had to flag her down. Then well one of our burners didn't work bc our server elbowed our drink into the grill.  Changed it out but didn't work and then it seemed like it affected the burner next to it. They didn't replace the drink until I asked for it. Then we got a bill and still had to pay gratuity. After we paid our server came back and mumbled something about sorry for not giving us any service. 

Would I recommend? No never 
What I can I suggest to this place to improve? 
Have sufficient equipment.
Please please please train your staff if you're going to automatically charge gratuity so it's worth it."}
{"text":"Very nice food set up. There wasn't too many people when we came in so my friends and I were kind of worrying but the food was amazing we had the first platter which had beef, pork, and chicken. It was a good sampler and a good portion for 3. It was a cool experience because you got to cook the meat yourself. If you're afraid of that you can also ask them to cook it, but you won't get that same experience!"}
{"text":"Never coming back to this restaurant again! The staff is very unprofessional and disrespectful. My husband found a hair in his food and the manager didn't want to re-make his order nor give him a refund. Stay away from this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Checked this place out for dinner tonight and so glad we did! After living in South Korea for a bit I missed having really good Korean barbecue. We arrived around 7:30pm and there were a few families eating. We were seated and taken our drink orders right away. There were 6 of us so we decided to get the Korean combo number 6  (79.99) which came with about 6 different types of meat. We also got an order of chicken teriyaki, steamed egg, and garlic edamame.

We were given all the yummy sides (kimchi, lettuce, radishes, seaweed, squash, beans, and a bean sprout salad) and we each got a bowl of white rice. Our huge meat plate came out quick and we got to grilling! Our waiter was friendly and attentive and made sure we had all that we needed. 

The fun part is the grillin! Throw the meat on there with the peppers, garlic, and onion, wrap it with the lettuce and voala its amazing! The steamed egg is a must try and so is the garlic edamame! We paid close to $150 for all that food but that also included their charge of $23 for tips. All in all the experience was fun and the meat was delicious! I will definitely be back, I felt like I was back in South Korea!

*wanted sushi but the waiter said they didn't make it anymore, :("}
{"text":"Great service! I liked it when it was Takamatsu, but now they are Arirang, all the ban chan were fresher, the server took the time to get to know us, and unlike the last few visits when it was still Takamatsu, they weren't out of a single item we ordered! 

LOVE the new owners."}
{"text":"Never coming back to this place because we waited for 1 hour for food only to tell us that our order was never in! Lol. This place is such a joke and always will be. Horrible service. We will be telling our friends and family not to come here!"}
{"text":"I used to eat here ALL the time when it was Takamatsu and loved it!! Then they sold and it got really bad and then worse.... Today we gave it another try and we are glad we did. New interior and the food is at the quality it was before. No sushi though. I had the bulgogi with the little dishes of kimchi and it was great! So happy that this place is picking itself up again. 

4 stars because the tea was bad tasting and no sushi. 

I will be back!! :)


UPDATE: And they have lost another star! You guys are KILLING me!!!! Take Sushi OFF your sign if you are not going to have sushi. Clean out your disgusting tea container! Tea is cheap and there is NO reason to have rotten tea. Clean your table grills! No one wants to sit and look at dried up old food while eating. 

Potato salad in a Bento Box??? WTF!"}
{"text":"This will be the last time our family come back to this place. We have been loyal since Takamatsu to Arirang, and despite of numerous Korean places have just opened in town, we still try to come back. Tonight, the food is the worst ever even though service is good. I ordered Combo 1 and Seafood Tofu soup. All of the meats are poor prepared, sweeter than usual, and leave a bland aftertaste. Onion salad (our favorite) was mixed in a galore of extra MSG and oil. It was hard to swallow. Soup is very bland! Side dishes are too sour and old, especially the kimchi, it tastes so bad! 

I get really pissed to have to pay for over $50 for this meal but only could eat a couple bites. We wont be back!"}
{"text":"Came here at 11:30 am first, I just couldn't handle the smell. And asked to use the grill for all you can eat. Apparently they don't do all you can eat around that time. I'm disappointed"}
{"text":"It's good, no frills Korean food. Lots of dishes to choose from, good side dishes. 
Probably the best place in AZ."}
{"text":"Oh I too long for the the good ol' Takamatsu day's, greeted on a first name basis, free Sochu shots, and extra papering for us regulars. The newest owners changed the name, painted the walls, re-arranged the seating, and for some reason shut down the AYCE Sushi Bar. 

Little else has changed ... but wait ... there's good news!

The overall KBBQ experience is back, fast service, tasty Banchan's, quality Kalbi, grilling meats, and cold Beer.  That my friends is the main event and why I still frequent this joint. 

On a side note, just in case you all missed the memo ... Hot Sake went out with the Millennium. 
21st Century Sake Bombs are now served Cold ... help spread the Word!

My only suggestions, remodel the dated reception area and trash that boxed Sake heater along with your non-existent customer meet & greet policy. Plenty of room for smiles and a modern display cooler full of new Korean Drinks, Sake's & Sochu's to contemplate while we wait to be seated.

Now that's something we could all sing about."}
{"text":"For being one of the only Korean BBQ places in the Phoenix area, this place deserves 4 stars for simply existing.

If you are expecting California-style KBBQ, lower your expectations. It's a completely different market. 

The comments from previous reviews are accurate--the prices are a little high, the service can be inefficient, the meat isn't top notch, the grill doesn't get hot enough, and theres no ventilation.

Having said that, this place deserves more than 2.5 stars. Everytime I come here, I leave full and satisfied. If you love Korean BBQ and don't want to drive 6 hours for Kang Ho Dong, this is the place to satisify your craving."}
{"text":"Currently my favorite Korean BBQ restaurant. We usually get one of the combos, which come with lots of meat for grilling. The bulgogi is my favorite  service is always good, and haven't had any issues with food thus far. We come back on an almost weekly basis"}
{"text":"It was excellent, way better than Takamatsu was even when it was still good. I am a KBBQ lover and recently went to Ktown in NY and LA and ate it there.
Big portions and the combos give added value. I had a party of 7 adults. We had combo #6 for 4or5 people and also ordered lamb and shrimp. We feasted and were barely able to finish. It was my friends' first time eating KBBQ, which is why I chose Arirang so they could have the authentic grill experience. They were impressed and loved the food and veggies.
The ban chan was really good, and there were even dishes I had not seen before like brussel sprouts and eggplant. Great bariety and good quality. I found the quality of the meat to be excellent, and we had various types of beef, lamb, ribeye, pork, chicken and shrimp. I read one review that was negative and found it to be unfounded regarding quality. The ambiance is very bare and plain, but I review the food and the service typically, and I only comment on ambiance. For 7 of us with combi #6 plus lamb and shrimp, 2 bottles of soju, 2 bottles of magkoli and 2 sodas, the bill came out to $32 each including tip. We feasted. I will return, probably soon with my sister. My friend said he will be taking his mom there."}
{"text":"We have been waiting for a good cook-it-yourself Korean BBQ place to open around here (yes there's another but it is so SALTY).  Arirang had the benefit of sharing the name of our go-to back in Pasadena (closed after we left town... coincidence???).
You CAN make reservations so that should be updated in on this Yelp page.
The food was GREAT with all the sides we expected.  The meats were not fatty so 100% edible with tremendous flavor.  I wasn't a fan of the pork belly but the rest of the table completely loved loved it.  
The prices took me by surprise however the portions were huge, we got what we paid for.
HUGE plus was that they had cold noodle soup just like the wife wanted and gave her flashbacks to The Corner Place in downtown Los Angeles.
The real downside were the gaps in service.  Waited almost 5 minutes to get seated with no one else waiting and staff walking past us a few times.  And the wait to place our order was almost 10 minutes.  After that the servers were very attentive.
Kids had a good time.  Adventure eating.
We will be going back.  Depend on it."}
{"text":"So yummy!! Makes me want to visit South Korea again! The Beef bulgogi was amazing...And so was the pot bulgogi! Will be back here for sure!!"}
{"text":"The food here is worse than other places. Side dishes are below average. The price is expensive for the food. Air conditioner was not function as it should and made us feel super hot while grilling.

Overall We were disappointed with the food and service here."}
{"text":"We've been looking for a korean bbq place here in the valley, and have finally found one. Wait staff was really friendly and helpful.  We actually did the traditional \"grill your own meat\" kind of dinner.  Bulgogi meat was on point and very tender.  The pork belly was pretty good, except a little bit more chewy to my liking.  However, overall, the dinner was enjoyable.  We had some funny conversations with the wait staff, and they were really helpful when it came to showing us how to grill the meat correctly."}
{"text":"I went with my son because he loves Korean BBQ. We normally go to Chodang but we wanted to try another Korean place. A big mistake. First of all galbi dish is $29.99 for one person. Potsticker appetizer was $5.99 for 6 pieces. Both tasted so so. My bill was about $45 for one dish, one appetizer, and one lemonade. And you'd think with this high prices, side dishes would be pretty decent but they were TERRIBLE. We'll go back to chodang.

We were there a few months ago and since then the prices came down a bit. Still Chodang has a better price and much better food."}
{"text":"I guess I should of listened to the reviews but decided to give it a shot anyways since it was the closest Korean BBQ spot to me. Our raw meat dishes for BBQ took an hour to come out and even longer to place an order. No ventilation so the smoke from the grill was fogging up the whole restaurant."}
{"text":"No lunch buffet and the sushi bar is closed. Limited lunch menu but good prices. Place had a slightly odd smell. Practically empty for lunch. Menu could use some more English to explain what each item is.

Ordered a lunch bento. Food was bland and salad was just plain lettuce, no dressing. Won't be back."}
{"text":"I love Korean food.  I love Bibimbap, especially a good priced one.  Been craving Korean for a while so we decided to have it for dinner.

A while back this place was called Takamatsu but the name has since changed but they still server Korean and from what I can tell, they still also serve sushi.  But they did have a sign stating that the sushi bar was closed tonight.  Not a big deal.

The menu had the Korean basics with a couple of Japanese items.  We decide on the garlic edamame, japchae with beef, seafood pancake, and 2 orders of the Bibimbap for me and the wifey.  It was just the wifey and the daughter tonight so that was way too much food.

They brought the edamame and it was super garlicky, which I loved.  They next gave us the side dishes with veggies, sprouts, kim chee, and potatoes.  The usual.  Next comes the japchae and seafood pancake.  The pancake was very good.  It was crispy and not greasy.  Very tasty and not overdone with seafood.  The japchae was also very tasty.  Many places also make this dish greasy but this one was just right.  I also like that they has mushrooms which I have never seen in this dish.  Also the amount on the plate was surprising.  Other places don't give a lot but we had a lot to take home.

Now the Bibimbap.  As described in the menu, a mountain of vegetables and with a couple of slivers of beef.  Top it off with an over easy egg and furikake strips.  Wow...good stuff.  But wait, I like to take hot rice and some gochujang and then mix it all together.  Happy tummy.  

The ambiance hasn't changed in years.  When we went we were lucky cause the place didn't seem to busy.  I read reviews that service was bad but we were served right away.  We were lucky cause a large party came in after us.  All the food was good and the prices were very fair.  Korean food can be expensive but this place was wallet friendly.  

We will be back."}
{"text":"Update to my past review. 

Okay...it's rare but this place has improved ALOT! Great job to the management. It definitely took us by surprise. However, we did only have three people in our group and there wasn't a rush. 

We decided to give this place another go after realizing our intended restaurant was closed for the day. We had k7 and k10. Spicy pork bulgogi and boneless short rib cooked my the kitchen. The food were all prepared well and perfectly seasoned. My only concern was it did take awhile for our food to come out. Luckily we weren't that hungry. The service was great this round too. Tentative and helpful in explaining the menu. Water and side dishes refilled with ease. 

Second chances paid off after all!! I'm hoping and wishing they will stay consistent. We'll definitely be back again. 

Tip: Give this place a try if you don't mind walking out smelling like Korean BBQ goodness :). Large groups be ware of added gratuity still.

This place was takamatsu...now Arirang
Don't bother going...

This place was not prepared for a party of five and up. The customer service here is horrendous. We waited for awhile until the grill was cleaned. That's understandable if it took 5 minutes as discussed but it actually took them 20 minutes to clean. We had to ask for plates, drinks, sauce bowls several times until our request was fulfilled. It's bothersome when something has been asked of several times and they don't care. We were neglected as soon as the food arrived. No water refill. We had to wave a waitress down so many times for the bill. They are disorganized and the food was mediocre. Other Korean establishments are better.

PS. Party of five and up, be prepared for 18% gratuity! The price for bad service...Le sigh. 

Thumbs down!"}
{"text":"My family and I have been coming here ever since we moved to the east side in 2007.  After multiple owners, new cooks, etc, I think they definitely got it right this time around.  The quality of the food got better as well as the overall presentation of the food.  

We definitely don't come here for sushi, to be honest I've never gotten sushi at a Korean restaurant before, however the Korean dishes are definitely good.  Less priced too in comparison to their competitors."}
{"text":"Probably the worst Korean meal I've ever had.. everything was off and yes I'm Korean and have eaten Korean in all the major US cities including Seoul. Worst meal! Don't serve kimchi have to ask for it!!"}
{"text":"Servers were friendly. But the food was bad. I ordered ribeye and the meat had no marbling at all. I'm sure it was  sirloin or something. They must think their customers are fool."}
{"text":"I've been here three times and have only had the bulgogi so far.  I keep ordering it because it's SO GOOD (I recommend asking for a side of bean paste to go with it.  I think it's a great combination)!  The portion sizes of entrees and side dishes is generous.  The staff is very friendly and helpful as well.  I've only done take-out so far, but I plan to dine in and try their sushi soon.  The atmosphere seems very welcome and comfortable.  It's far enough from my house that I drive past a few other Korean BBQ places on my way there...that's how good it is!"}
{"text":"Look no more. This is the Korean restaurant you MUST GO TO in the Valley. The banchan is legit awesome, everything homemade. There were little anchovies and the fish cakes, bean paste to top it off. The LA Galbi is sweet and tender; kimchi chigae spicy and bulgogi luscious. We have been searching since coming to PHX for the genuine Korean restaurant. This is it."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite family restaurants!! The food is fresh, service is always friendly and it's fun to cook your own food. You have the option of having them cook it for you if that's not your thing."}
{"text":"Service is slow, have to ask for refills or slurp your straw.  Daeji bulgogi, short ribs, and  bulgogi are as good as any other KBBQ.  Kim chi Chigae and Dumpling Tofu soup not good, the flavor is just not right.  Side dishes are average.  Takamatsu was way better.  No kimbap.  Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"I don't know how this place is still open.
I've never been food poisoned from eating korean food. I've had bad food but to be sick for couple of days from drinking 5 scoops of the Galbitang soup is unbelieveable!!!
Even the kimchee was awful. I serously don't understand how Kimchee would be awful.
Everything tastes nothing like korean food, used ajinomoto/dashi for seasoning, spoiled & old/aged.
Hopeing this place will do well but instead of improving, everything dropped severely & way way over priced for the quality."}
{"text":"We used to come here all the time several years ago when it used to be Takamatsu but have heard so many terrible things about Arirang about people getting food poisoning, the food being made with expired and low quality ingredients, so we avoided going. Recently, I heard that they changed cooks so my family and I decided to come try their dinner. First of all, their restaurant says it's a sushi bar, but they don't have sushi. Their side dishes looked dull in color and not very appetizing. We ordered mool neng myun which is a icy cold beef broth with noodles and that was lacking so much flavor. Even putting in vinegar, sesame oil, hot mustard, it was still really bland not very good. We also ordered bibim neng myun which is a spicy mixed noodle dish but the sauce was so bland, even when we asked for more sauce to put on the noodles, the flavor didn't change because the sauce was watered down so much. They also use super thin noodles that didn't hold up very well and it just wasn't good as much as we wanted to like it. The galbi seemed ok, my brother ate all of his order. The spicy pork bulgogi didn't taste very good either. The décor inside is really weird, they use garden fencing as décor. The music went from Korean hip hop to acoustic Justin Beiber and it was just weird. Overall, the experience and food was very lacking and we won't be going back. There are way better Korean restaurants nearby that have good food and better atmosphere."}
{"text":"I love taking people here for the first time! I think the food is delicious and the BBQ tables are an experience you can't get just anywhere. We actually don't usually cook our own meat when we go, but when we have we had good experiences. I usually get jajangmeong (black bean noodles) which I highly recommend. 

Good
Cook meat at your table (if you want to) 
Expansive Korean food menu
Japanese menu as well 
Attentive and friendly service 
Good variety of panchan (side dishes) 

Bad
The sushi was ok here, but the last 2 times I've gone the sushi bar wasn't open."}
{"text":"It was my first time here and I had a great experience. The staff was extremely friendly and the food was great. I met the owners son who was very friendly and very helpful. I was only here for lunch but will definitely be coming back. They've definitely earned my business."}
