{"text":"Fancy plating not a lot of food I went with 2 others and 2/3 of us didn't enjoy out entrees but appetizers were good and service is good."}
{"text":"Overall bad experience. On a Wednesday night, there weren't many people, but our meal which consisted of 2 entrees and 1 app took 35 mins to get to the table. Then when we received our food, there was barely a handful of fries with one of the entrees. I'd have to say 11 french fries in total. Then for my entr√©e, which was a salad, it was absolutely drowning in salad dressing. It was basically a soup. To make matters worse, the spinach clearly wasn't fresh and was shriveling up. Portion was also very small. These two entrees, one app, and 2 beers came to 70$. 

Service from the waitress was good, but will never return because of the over priced food. Not impressed at all. 

The menu looked good, but everything was overpriced and I really doubt the food will be delivered as it looks on the menu."}
{"text":"The chicken wings and fries are good.  The dip comes in a pre-packaged container similar to the dips at McDonalds, which is a bit odd when dining in.

The manager/owner takes an interest in customers and the 3 times I've been, someone's stopped us to make sure we enjoyed our visit.  

This is probably a great place for sports fans as the multiple screens broadcast endless sports.  This, combined with the uncomfortable hard wooden chairs, make it an OK place for me, but not one of my favourites."}
{"text":"Love their chicken wings! Food here is great.. Manager at this location is very nice and actually stops by your table to make sure things are ok. Everyone seems to be happy working there, waitiess' come around to make sure everything is good and food is amazing. No complaints.
I only visit with coworkers during the day, on our lunch hour so I'm not sure about dinnertime or weekends but we have never had a complaint about this location."}
