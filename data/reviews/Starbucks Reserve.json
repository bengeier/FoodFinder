{"text":"Yah, I wasn't all that impressed.  It's not really anyone's fault probably, but I don't think I like dark roast coffee.  I had the coffee experience (same bean 2 ways) and while I got a seat fairly quickly, everything felt too crowded, rushed.  I can definitely taste the difference between coffee made with a Clover machine vs. pour over, but the bean was too bitter.  Brought some beans home from their reserve line . Either pour over or from my espresso machine, the Brazilian was too bitter.  Perhaps more suitable for sugary drinks.  Even the beans available at Whole Foods was better.  No, too trendy, too commercial for me."}
{"text":"Easily the best Starbucks in Toronto.  On a busy Sunday, there was a long lineup, but the black aproned baristas were patient enough to go over the pour over method vs. clover brewing methods for the different types of reserve beans they have in stock.  After choosing the pour over with the Nicaragua beans which are ground per order, I proceeded over to the counter where the barista explained to me the difference between the Starbucks pour over machine (200 degrees straight from a hot water hose), or using a goose neck kettle, scale, and Chemex.  No matter which way you choose, the coffee is poured into a kettle or cup of your choice, and presented on a wooden tray with metal utensils.  Not a wooden stir stick in sight for my order.    I would definitely come back when I want to elevate my Starbucks experience."}
{"text":"User friendly large gorgeous interior & terrific layout (can play angry birds seated at the bar while the barista crafts your beverage), courteous staff and more options.....your favorite Starbucks on steroids, what is not to like?  Will I seek it out? no. Will I miss it? not really (plain ole true north blonde is fine by me).  In Europe, I'd have no problems walking into a hole in the wall cafe or a convenience serving coffee, you know it's yummy. Only reason to pop into a Starbucks in Europe is for clean washrooms. In North America, coffee from even our fanciest artisanal coffee shops can taste like garbage or mediocre, hence my reliance on Starbucks here."}
{"text":"Dear Shultz,   Dropped in to taste what all the fuss was about. Fear not your store at Shops at Don Mills lives up to the hype, expectation, and lofty gold standard expected of our bored.    Black aproned staff Nick and the crew serve exceptional Reserve Â© menu - fancy menu if ya wanna impress the ladies - suggested Nitro Cloud did the trick poured like a home brewed craft beer...and even less foam!   Let's continue to pay homage to Italy's finest cafe experience with Reserve menu - Venti Nitro Cloud made with a mix of Jamaica, Nicaragua, and Guatemala Coffee beans.   Chairman of the Bored,  B.Y.E."}
{"text":"This is one of the first (or maybe the only) Starbucks Reserve in Toronto! The cafe has huge seating space and slightly different menu than normal Starbucks. We ordered Hazelnut Bianca, but it was out of stock. So they customized Dark Chocolate Mocha for us and it was fabulous. We took a side of marble cake which complimented well. I was quite surprised that this place was rated so low. Definitely worth a visit... I hope they open in downtown soon."}
{"text":"Went there yesterday after dinner. Heard things about this interesting new concept from Starbucks. The interior was emmaculete simple modern style. A go to spot for people who want to chat and enjoy a long stay.  The line was long but worth the wait. They served espresso shot ice cream and bunch of drinks regular Starbucks did not have. I ordered the hazel mocha as well as the ice float. If you want their signature cold beverage cup be sure to say to go!  Everything was done tastefully and a sure spot to chill and chat amongst your friends.  I think the crowd was there mainly because this is rather new so alot of curious foodies alike myself visited....hard to say if it will do as well in the future."}
{"text":"Opened yesterday Saturday in toronto. Have seen pics of starbucks reserve in china - this version in toronto is definitely not to par. However still a beautifully modern architecture coffee cafe to check out. Big hype with lots of people but very organized with lineups moving quickly. Lots of different coffees to try - i will define try the nitrogen option next time! Good seating space."}
{"text":"The store looks huge, almost cavernous in photos, but it's deceptive due to the high ceilings and long wraparound bar. It's really about the size of a small McDonald's.  Which is still about 2-3 times as big as a normal Starbucks. Music playing was upbeat \"Hot AC\" with some EDM mixed in, which was a lot better than some of the depressing stuff (country, ballads...) I have had to endure at other stores.    At time of writing there are only 3 Reserve Bars in Canada - Vancouver, Ottawa, and this one.  There's a hierarchy in the Starbucks chain, with the Roasteries (so far just Seattle and Shanghai) at the top and your run-of-the-mill \"Dairy Queen\" Starbucks decked in green at the bottom, the ones full of squealing high school girls in Hello Kitty gear lining up for stupid Unicorn Frapps.  Reserve Bars are about halfway up the chain.  Look at the menu on the wall here and you'll see the Frappuccinos are hidden at the bottom right corner. They don't feature prominently here at all. In fact during my visit I never heard the Vitamix run even once.  This is Starbucks for the mature crowd.   This is Howard Schwartz's answer to all those hipster coffee shops downtown.   The hipsters have US$30,000 Black Eagle Gravitech espresso machines (as used in the World Barista Championships), so does this store.  The hipsters have Nitro Cold Brew Floats and Affogatos, so does this store.  The hipsters have rare exotic \"small lot\" coffee beans, so does this one. The hipsters will brew a \"flight\" for cupping, they'll do that here too.  And so on.   If you love and appreciate coffee, come here. If you want dessert out of a blender, go find a Dairy Queen or Baskin Robbins, don't come here.  If you're a Starbucks Rewards member and have a lot of free drinks to redeem, this is a great place to do it. On my visit I decided to treat myself to dessert (to redeem 2 freebies).  On arrival I started with a Nitro Cold Brew Float, which is a scoop of vanilla gelato with nitro cold brew poured over it, and would have cost $10 after tax.  Wow.  Creamy foamy coffee greatness in a glass!  I followed that up with the House Affogato (also made with that delicious gelato) but I specified that I wanted it made with 4 ristretto shots (the standard order is 2 regular shots) of Micro Blend 21. (by making these mods that bumped the price over $10 as well, but this was a free order)  MB21 is a special blend of beans exclusively used at the Reserve Bars and only brewed in the Black Eagle machine (which is fully manual - the barista hand-tamps the portafilter and hand-pulls each shot... not that lazy \"press button and look away\" business).  The barista then added demerara syrup and dusts it with cinnamon.   The special espresso blend with that vanilla, heavenly stuff.  Try what I had today and you'll ask yourself, why did I ever waste calories and money on Frappuccinos?  Along with the Black Eagle and the Nitro Cold Brew on tap, they also can brew Reserve coffee beans on the $15,000 Clover Brewer, do a pour-over brew using Chemex glassware, or for a special show, have them brew it at the Mod Bar, which looks like a high school chemistry setup.  I was disappointed that the Reserve Bar (at time of writing) did not yet have the Siphon brewers, which are actually available at the new Yorkdale Mall store.  Hopefully this gets included soon as that is a fun presentation to experience...  Lots of Starbucks Reserve branded items, but you'll get sticker shock...  Cold Brew growler for $54, and a 2-tablespoon measuring spoon (!) for $10!  Ouch...   I can't wait to return to the Reserve Bar! I was ecstatic to learn we were finally getting one (how did Ottawa get one before Toronto?). Long overdue, Starbucks....  This is Starbucks as it was meant to be, not that Dairy Queen clone it mostly had become."}
{"text":"The House Adffogato was so good. Usually I don't like ice cream nor coffee. But at the Starbucks Reserve, they taste so good together! Love it. I was sharing this with my husband and asked that's it and he is like yea it's not a Sundae. I really enjoyed it!   They give you sparkling water and went very well with it. I did ask the staff there and they said this location will most likely serve wine in the future. Just like the one in Orlando. I really hope they will bring the truffle popcorn to Canada. Comfy seat and nice ambiance. I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Loud Starbucks. Can be busy at times. Expensive drinks. Fancier than other Starbucks locations. I wouldn't go here on a daily since it's a bit pricey."}
{"text":"So I decided to give this place a try again, as my previous review was rather harsh. Anyhow, after a long drive uptown hoping to find some place to just relax. We decided on coming to Starbucks Reserve. At first I had my reservations as my prior visit here was not that great due to the patrons at the time. My second visit has improved as it was easier to find a seat to grab a drink and just chill. I still believe that if Starbucks want to market their Reserve stores to be more exclusive, then they should use their fancy CRM system to determine who their Clover/Reserve Starbucks drinkers are and go from there."}
{"text":"First Starbucks Reserve in Toronto? Featured on BlogTO? Just take my money already, Starbucks.   Honestly, it's a bit gimmicky. Maybe I just don't understand why people would want to pay a premium on already expensive coffee but hey I bought into it. I got the dirty chai since it seemed like the most unique drink. I thought the chai foam complimented the cold brew quite well but my friend thought it was disgusting so 50/50 chance you'll like it too!   Service was super quick, although they apologized for being slow (I didn't think they were???). I came in the evening so there wasn't much of a line but there were quite a few people seated in the Starbucks, working or chatting away.   Come at your own discretion, just be ready to spend at least $6 on a drink!"}
{"text":"Seek out the coffee masters clothed in black (aprons) and they will show you the way to coffee enlightenment.  I had NO IDEA the adventure that was in store for me when I took my coffee lovin' friend to the Starbucks Reserve store. The inside has such a spacious and open air feel to it with 32,000 square ft inside, glass paneled walls and an outdoor patio. We wanted to be where all the action takes place so we parked ourselves at the middle of the bar; William was our wonderful and knowledgeable guide.   We ordered the House Affogato (2 shots of Microblend 21 espresso with candied citrus & dark chocolate undertones, vanilla ice cream, Demerara Syrup & cinnamon) and the coffee flight. I asked for regular water to replace the sparkling water they give as a palate cleanser. We watched in fascination as they used the following:  - High-tech Clover brewer - a full immersion brewer with vacuum filtration.  - Black Eagle espresso machine - the same as the one used in the World Barista Championships  - Siphon method - \"a theatrical display of science and coffee\". I would describe it as a caffeine addicted mad scientist using his bunsen burner and beakers to make a cup of coffee.  Now I'm not a purest and have NEVER drank coffee black. When I tried the first coffee of the flight all I could taste was the bitterness. I added a little bit of sugar to cut the bitterness and VIOLA! I could taste the subtle flavors of candied lemon, red apple, dark chocolate, caramel COOL! I found an interesting study by the Chemistry Department of the University of York on how sugar influences the fundamental chemistry of coffee (https://www.york.ac.uk/news-and-events/news/2015/research/tea-coffee-sugar-chemistry/).   Starbucks reserve really shines with their customer service (disclaimer: do not go during rush hours, the staff will not have the time to cater to you). The baristas in black aprons (the regular staff wear green) are undergoing or have finished a rigorous coffee master's training where they learn the history and science behind coffee; are trained on the different brewing methods; and even undergo a blind taste test to identify different coffees. Their passion for coffee really shows, as they eagerly answer any and all questions.   Drinks may be pricey but it's all worth it when you walk away with a new appreciation of all the work that goes behind making the perfect cup of coffee."}
{"text":"First time @ the Starsbuck Reserve we got there around 9pm Sat, thought It would be much more to it with all the hype. There was no sitting, music to loud thought I was at a club, not a good place to go and chat. Coffee we had was good French Press Style. Service was good overall. Won't be returning here."}
{"text":"In my hood...in my hood..in my hood!  After all the hype I decided to come over and see.  I came on a Monday morning when I was off - I figured it wouldn't be slammed like on a weekend.  While still pretty busy at 10am, there were plenty of seats available.  This is an elevated SB.  It's got that lounge like cafe feel to it.  Sleek tables, lots of chairs, you can sit at the coffee bar.  You can't get very many of the regular SB items here - they carry the better quality coffees.  All the baristas were super friendly and answered any questions you had.  They do also carry a small selection of pastries (not sure if they carry more extensive food - sandwiches -  later in the day).  I don't think I'd ever venture here on a weekend - i can easily see lineups and long waits.  But luckily since it's so close to me, I can pop over on one of my days off and just sit back and relax and people watch and judge what people are ordering for my morning entertainment :)  Plenty of parking in the lot - however be warned that the Shops of don Mills parking lot (in front and the 4 tiered parking garage) get filled up quickly."}
{"text":"This Starbucks Reserve Bar is super pretty and I love the high ceilings, pretty lighting, low bars, and spiffy-looking baristas in their black aprons. The only sad-looking part of this bar is behind the cash where it's a bit too dimly lit and I always feel bad for the people working at that position. But otherwise, I love the atmosphere in this place. It's a bit loud, but I love that when people walk in, all the baristas greet them even though it can be overwhelming sometimes.   If you're coming here to study, there's one long, large table that has outlets underneath, but otherwise outlets are a bit sparse. This is presumably because it's is a place to have a coffee experience rather than to study. However, if battery life and noise isn't an issue for you, the bar is actually a really nice place to study at because you get to watch all the different ways they brew coffee here.  The Reserve Bar has a bunch of the same things as any regular Starbucks but also has a lot more selection of the Reserve coffees, so many different brewing methods, and things you can't get at other stores like nitro cold brew float, nitro chai, and affogatos. I love their nitro cold brew float because the strong cold brew mixed with the sweet ice cream is a perfect balance. However I recommend saving your stars for their specialty drinks as it can get quite expensive - a tall nitro cold brew float is 8.50 before tax. Oh! Also get it in a to go cup as they're so much prettier."}
{"text":"TBH this is just a regular Starbucks with lots of seating and a different approach on customer service. I ordered a cold brew and it came in a different plastic cup which is the reason it cost me more. They do have different coffees which I have yet to try but personally I believe it is very hyped up.   Although I would probably go back if I was in the area.   Keep Eating, Angela"}
{"text":"Coffee was very different and they have some cool stuff on the menu. Had the Camex(name is sketchy ) which is essentially a drip. Really nice place but the crowd makes it less enjoyable. I was in line for a good 15mins before being able to make my order. Not sure how it would work for Takeout."}
{"text":"As a Starbucks Reserve, I expected it to be a large, grand space for coffee connoisseurs, but was disappointed. The space isn't that big at all, and it was packed on a Sunday afternoon so the wait time was 30+ minutes - lining up to order, waiting for the order, and finding a seat proved to be a challenge.   I ordered the Brew Comparison Flight for Costa Rica Reserve coffee ($8) - the same coffee brewed two different ways. The methods were Clover and Pour-Over. I couldn't really taste the difference, but I think Clover produced a stronger, more acidic coffee vs. pour over was more watered down and not as hot.  As an 'aspiring aficionado', I would have appreciated some direction, but I understand that they're busy and this isn't exactly the coffee class I had imagined.   As a regular Starbucks, it's fine, but it was not a particularly elevated coffee experience."}
{"text":"I have been planning on trying this out since it opened. Came on an early Saturday morning, parking was a breeze. Place wasn't busy at this time of day, but the baristas are full of energy and always ready for a greeting each time a customer walks in. Ordered a 2 cold brew floats, 3 double smoked bacon breakfast sandwich and origins flight. Sandwiches arrived first, then the floats. I had to follow up for the origins flight as  I have devoured my sandwich and still no sign of the coffees. After that, flight was ready in a few minutes, and I'd say it was worth the wait. I couldn't choose among the 3 - Nicaragua, Guatemala and Costa Rica. They were all equally good, smooth and clean tasting. A few minutes later, a staff approached our table to give us a 'Next one's on us' card. That just means they aim for good customer service and recognize when they're not able to. Nevertheless, I'd be back for sure as I enjoyed the great coffee. Next time, house affogato it is  oh and the brew comparison too, just for curiosity's sake."}
{"text":"This is a place of \"no-return\"; I wouldn't want to go back to a traditional Starbucks after I have been here.  There is a central bar where you can see the coffee masters in action and interact with them.   They have special menu and coffee; even their to-go cups are different.  Everything here is more stylish.  ** may redeem free rewards, excluding Coffee Press and Chemex **"}
{"text":"Nice cafe. It does feel a little more modern then your usual Starbucks experience.   During our visit it was crowded - so I do recommend if you don't want to wait in line to go and order on the mobile app - however not the whole menu is avalaible if you want the tasting flight.   Lots of tables and chairs to sit and the coffee bar is nice - offering several different options of brewed coffee.   I like the feel of this place; but it isn't as big as the mother ship in Seattle.   It is a good place to visit if you are in the area post movie, etc."}
{"text":"Visited on a Saturday afternoon with some friends to try the items we don't usually see in the regular Starbucks. The cafe is really spacious and modern. It wasn't too busy, we found seats at the long table within a few minutes. I ordered the House Affogato as recommended by the staff. It is vanilla ice cream in two shots of microblend espresso with a dust of cinnamon on top. It was delicious but I think if the vanilla ice cream was more flavourful (more vanilla bean flavoured or more milky/ creamy) it would have made the affogato even better. They can also do an affogato with iced coffee instead of espresso. My friend ordered the honey rose latte which she said was good but a bit too sweet for her taste. Note that you can redeem an affogato with your star rewards, which would make it a good deal. Overall great experience and will be back if I am ever in the area."}
{"text":"A few days ago, I finally had a chance to check out the Starbucks Reserve by Don Mills and see what all the hype was about. I definitely get it now after seeing the place and tasting some of the drinks!   First, I immediately thought of how it looked a lot nicer compared to the usual Starbucks locations that give off a more simple and cozy cafe vibe. This place is larger in space - complete with a sleek, long bar area with surprisingly comfortable high wooden seats, high communal tables, several tables and chairs for larger groups, as well as comfortable seating areas in the middle for conversations. The contrast between the black walls and the wooden elements of the space gave it such a cool vibe. I seriously love how chic this space looks - what a sleek cafe atmosphere to hang out in!  Though they did have the usual Starbucks lattes and espresso drinks, my husband and I figured that we might as well order drinks on the menu that you can only get at this location. It was interesting to see that they also had coffee from other countries like Costa Rica and Nicaragua.   After reading some of the reviews, we went with the Nitro Cold Brew Float which had vanilla bean ice cream in it, as well as the Nitro Dirty Chai. The Nitro Cold Brew Float had a nice, smooth coffee flavour with the right amount of sweetness to it - must have been the ice cream. I'm glad we ordered the Nitro Dirty Chai as well just for comparison. The chai cream foam flavour definitely comes through despite the thicker texture (almost like a milkshake) but it was a bit strong for our taste, especially when compared to the layers of flavour and overall smoothness of the Nitro Cold Brew Float. Between the two drinks, we would definitely recommend getting the Nitro Cold Brew Float and we'd personally get that ourselves again too if we're ever in the area again.   Fun fact: one of the staff members told us that both drinks apparently only come in the Grande size since there's so much caffeine in each drink. Trust me, the caffeine is definitely there - I didn't sleep until 3 a.m...  Adding to the nice customer experience from the staff member at the cash register was the nice barista who gave us a free Nitro Cold Brew Float since there was a mix up with someone's order. We ended up giving this to a friend we met up with after since it was too much caffeine for us with our other two drinks already.  Some tips: -Get your drink to go as cold drinks come in nice drink containers that can be reused (see my photos below) and hot drinks come in black cups -Use one of your Starbucks rewards drinks if you have one as the prices match the higher end experience (pretty much $10 for that delicious Nitro Cold Brew Float for example) -Really take your time here and enjoy the sleek setting :) Parking is free and ample anyway!  Overall, this place gets a thumbs up from me and I definitely think it's worth checking out if you happen to be in the area! I'll return again sometime to check out their other drinks!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday afternoon to catch up on some work. Really busy environment with a huge line due to popularity. The staff are awesome though passing through menus and apologizing for the wait.   I got a nitro brew float and my bf got the nitro cascara cloud. Both have a heavier coffee taste, but if you want a treat or expect more emphasis on the ice cream, go for their adffogato :)   Great atmosphere with lots of natural light.   The only thing holding back from a solid 5 star was the disruptiveness of those sitting down. The service is great if you're here for take out but the staff are sweeping around you and asking us to adjust during our stay. Maybe just do the sweeping when we leave...  Met my expectations for a fancier Starbucks."}
{"text":"Location/Service: Finally decided to check out this place since the hype has somewhat died down. This Starbucks is located at Shops at Don Mills, in the corner, on the same side as Panera Bread. My friend and I went on a Monday night at about 8pm and the place was still quite packed, albeit there were still several empty tables/seats. The store is actually quite spacious without loads of short and tall tables and seats. If you fancy, you can sit at the \"bar\" where you can see how the drinks are made. My friend and I sat at the \"bar\" and it was very comfortable. Actually, the entire place was very pleasant; not too loud and you can do your own thing and no one really cares. There are lots of seats with plugs too if you need to do work on your laptop.   The staff there were really friendly and they made my experience so pleasant. When my friend ordered the Microblend 21, which is a candied citrus flavoured espresso enrobed in dark chocolate, the barista/cashier suggested a lemon loaf to go with it because she believes that it goes well with the coffee. I really like that personal touch and I really appreciate her going above and beyond to make our experience that much better. Props to that barista!  Food/Drink: I ordered the Hazelnut Bianco Latte ($5.50). Unfortunately, I couldn't customize my drink because the base is pre-made. However, I asked for extra hot and they were able to do that. The drink was really good and there was a strong taste of soy milk there. I would definitely order it again.   Overall: I would definitely come back to try other drinks at Starbucks Reserve. The atmosphere is excellent, the drinks are great and the staff is phenomenal. Next time, I would bring my laptop and perhaps chill there for a couple of hours."}
{"text":"Greatest WiFi but  usually far too loud. Try the yogurt parfait if you are not allergic to dairy or nuts."}
{"text":"Incredibly loud music at this location inside. Who thought that was a good idea?  More expensive, but same Starbucks over-roasted coffee beans.  Also, this is a well known dog-friendly outdoor mall, yet we were asked to leave the patio when visiting with our calm and quiet dog. Manager said they received complaints... well here is another complaint."}
{"text":"I went to check out the new Starbucks Reserve Bar early this morning as to avoid the craziness that would probably occur later on in the day.  The reserve bar itself, very nicely decorated, different looking from the regular starbucks we are all used to visiting.  There is a large counter with very fancy looking machines where you can taste their reserve beans.   Coffee wise, we got a tasting option where you get to compare two kinds of brewing methods (clover and pour over) using the same kind of bean.  I found the pour over to result in much stronger coffee over the clover.  But both cups of coffee resulted in a much stronger coffee over their regular brews.  You can still buy their normal coffee options there as well. The downside, as with all new businesses, there are operational issues.  The people working at the Starbucks told my husband that they were confused since it was their first day.  We had to wait 18 minutes for our coffees because they lost our order (there weren't that many people in the place).  Our first coffee came out no issues, but the second coffee was missing.  So how are we supposed to compare 2 different brew methods with the same bean if the temperature of the drinks are significantly different?  Also, the ordering was kinda confusing.  So theres the a regular cashier line and apparently you can also pay at the reserve bar if you're getting their reserve coffees.  But of course, even though there was someone greeting us at the door, they never advised us of that. Having said that, I'll most likely return again to check out some of their other options (i.e. nitro cold brews) another day when they hopefully have ironed out their operations."}
{"text":"Loving this new makeover for the Starbucks Reserve! Their alcohol selection hasn't been rolled out to this location yet, but should be coming out anytime soon! They have a wider selection than the average SB, with many exclusive Reserve items on the menu... The staff in here is extremely friendly and very professional, helpful and very welcoming"}
{"text":"The Ultimate Starbucks!  I am just so happy and excited that Toronto finally gets our own Starbucks Reserve!   This place is so spacious and with different seating options! And here you can get \"coffee\" that you cannot get from your Neighbourhood Starbucks.   Best place to use your Rewards! That Nitro Cold Brew Float ($9) so rich and smooth! Drink like a milkshake. I now know what's my summer dessert drinks will be!  Staff here so friendly and outgoing. They must love working here!"}
{"text":"I came here on a Saturday afternoon just shortly after the grand opening to see what all the hype was about. And boy was it BUSY!  The lineup snaked around the front of the store and practically out the door! I also noticed that there were virtually no seats around which was kind of a bummer since I wanted to sit down and try the affogato. Luckily my husband and I managed to eventually score 2 seats by the bar.   While I was waiting in line I was given a paper menu to look at which had the reserve options. A thing to note is the reserve bar still serves the same drinks as the normal starbucks in addition to their reserve menu. We decided to go with the house Affogato and the dark chocolate mocha.   The house Affogato was definitely something I have been waiting to try and it did not disappoint! Only problem was that since it was busy one barista had scooped a bunch of ice cream into several bowls and left it on the counter while the other person made the espresso. So by the time I got my Affogato alot of the ice cream had already melted. Other than that the espresso was so rich and flavorful but not overpowering and blended so smoothly with the rich ice cream. I honestly I could have eaten about 10 of them! The iced dark chocolate mocha was also another winner to me. It was a very rich mocha flavor and just a little bitterness to it. It also came in a very classy modern reusable cup!  I will definitely be back to try the hazelnut Bianco latte which was sold out at the time as it was super popular."}
{"text":"I love it here!!! The space is great and they have ice cream.  Also enjoyed the nitro dirty chai.  I wish they had one in Pickering!"}
{"text":"Cute concept. It's the first of its kind in Toronto so I expected lots of Starbucks fanatics to drop by. The place is spacious, with professional coffee machine and an open bar type seating. You won't neccesarily see the same stuff at your average Starbucks at a corner of an intersection. Their menu changes according to season and what they can bring in from suppliers. It's like a grown up, classier version of Starbucks."}
{"text":"Great vibe. No menus on the wall.. There's an actual paper menu that you choose from. Nice selection of drinks...  Setup a meeting with a client here. Bad idea.. Place was loud (not complaining) and packed.  Definite worth multiple visits to checkout all they have to offer!"}
{"text":"Checking out the new Starbucks Reserve today. This is Canada's third (and Toronto's first) Reserve bar which specializes in unique brewing techniques and a specialty menu.  One of the specialty drinks you can get here is NitroBrew Coffee which is cold brewed coffee (coffee that is slowly steeped for 20 hours and then stored in a keg) which is then infused with nitrogen bubbles upon ordering. The nitrogen causes the brew to separate a bit with the darker parts drifting to the bottom and the lighter creamier parts rising to the top - much like Guinness beer. The result is an extremely creamy coffee with a smooth, thick texture.  To make it even more creamy, I decided to go with the Nitro Cold Brew Float ($8.50) which adds a scoop of vanilla bean icecream on top. I was quite impressed with the float. The coffee had a nice flavour a hint of sweetness and the icecream had little flecks of vanilla bean in it. But what impressed me the most was the texture. It really was extremely creamy and you get a slightly tingly sensation on your tongue after you take a sip. And then there's the foam at the top... OMG! So extremely light and creamy! I was scooping up every last bit of foam off the side of my cup. Very impressed. My next drink here will definitely be the Nitro Dirty Chai - can't wait to see what that tastes like!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed. I used to go to the Starbucks at Shops at Don Mills daily to get the peppermint hot chocolate. Ever since the Starbucks moved a couple of stores over and became a reserve location, it's terrible. They have not made the peppermint hot chocolate right even once and I hear so many people complaining about their order. I literally took my cup, took one sip and tossed it in the garbage. I am officially boycotting Starbucks... And hot chocolate. That's how turned off I am.  Regarding the actual inside, it's clean, modern and looks really nice. More selection too."}
{"text":"My new favourite Starbucks spot! The decor is amazing and I love the aesthetic of the Reserve.  Got their nitro cold brew float - delicious! One tip is to make sure the icecream starts to melt and to mix it together, taste much better! This drink is their most expensive drink on the menu, after tax it comes to just over 10$!!! But it's the perfect drink on a summer day (especially if you redeem your stars a free menu item )"}
{"text":"Heard about this special Starbucks, so I went and spent the afternoon there.  I liked how it's spacious and modern.  Lots of seatings with plug outlets for your gadgets. I ordered a nitro cold brew float for about $10.  It came in a decent size cup.  The coffee was smooth, rich and creamy with a hint of bitter.  In hind sight, I should have stirred in the overly sweet ice cream to neutralize the bitter taste.   I was enjoying my afternoon there and much to my delight, the servers came around periodically with samples of treats.  They were friendly and courteous.   What's not to like?!"}
