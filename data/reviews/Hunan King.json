{"text":"The food has gone downhill. We used to come often but we just revisited a couple days in a row and we were very disappointed in the food quality."}
{"text":"Stopped in with my cousins who live up here and it was delicious Chinese food! The same family has been running it forever and the kitchen is open and you can watch them make everything! My family that lives there is from Boston and very picky about their Chinese food. It's a fine line between authentic and American style and they sit right on that line. All the standards, Shrimp fried rice, Chicken fingers, Boneless spare ribs, and on and on. Great stuff and the price is right. The people there are a sweet as their sauces. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Been coming here for years. Menu is predictable for most Chinese places in the States but the food is consistently yummy.     Kitchen is open to view and is very, very clean.   They accept credit cards but have a $15 order minimum.  Dinner for two including appetizers was under $20."}
{"text":"Night 1 of our cross country drive brought us to Elyra. After checking into the local Ramada, I went on the hunt for my best meal option as a dairy allergic individual, take out Chinese. This place was the first non-all you can eat buffet Asian spot I came across, so I ducked in. The parking lot is a bit confusing (from someone who's never been in this town) but the service was fast. I didn't call ahead, ordered from the counter and had my take out in about 8 minutes. We ordered standard fare of General Tso's Chicken and Chicken Lo Mein. Tso's was OK, no spice heat there but sweet, warm and crispy and the broccoli was fresh. Lo Mein was the better of the two, not greasy, mild flavor, good veggie to chicken ratio and we demolished it. All and all, happy with the experience, it so hit the spot after a stressful day of driving many hours and sitting in a dumpy hotel room watching reruns of Modern Family."}
{"text":"This place used to be our go to Chinese food but since they changed staff, it's gone downhill. I believe they even started ordering lower quality food too. That really sucks because we used to go to them religiously but now, never again. Take this review for what it means....the food sucks now. Try the one by Walmart..that place is killer!"}
{"text":"Hunan King is pretty good if you want some good chinese food. I go here most often now when I need a quick dinner and am in the mood for Chinese. They are pretty quick at getting your order ready and I've never had any problems with Hunan King.  Lo Mein dishes and the General Tso's chicken are my favorites here."}
