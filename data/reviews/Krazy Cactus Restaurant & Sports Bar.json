{"text":"Just to preface that I specifically created an account just to voice my displeasure with the management.  I don't like to give good/bad reviews as people should judge for themselves, however I think I will start from now on.

We had a coupon from the Entertainment book and chose this restaurant over a few others in an effort to try a new place which will become a regular.  We walk in and the place had 4-6 people in the bar, around the same on the patio and in the main dining room there was not a diner in sight.  This should have set off alarm bells however we have been to places near empty at first and get busy later, and regardless we judge on the food & service anyways. (We  regularly come to Catz fish and chips next door however it is a different name now)

If you are not familiar, the Entertainment book is where the restaurant themselves have a coupon for 'xx' dollars off a purchase of any 2 lunch or dinner (almost 2 for 1 depending on what you order).  This usually excludes apps and specials.  In the case of this place, it was up to $25 with purchase of another dinner.  We find this is an excellent way to try or 'test' new places while seeing how they handle their own coupon, etc and hopefully find new hangouts.

We usually order drinks (non-alcoholic) 2 dinners and some apps and maybe a dessert if there is room, so it is not as if we just go in ordering water and just dinner and run.   Waitress confirmed it was anything on the menu excluding the apps which is understandable.

Service by waitress was quick and we were eating in no-time.  We had 2 orders of ordered 16 wings, an onion ring basket. mozza sticks and some pop.

Onion rings were good, mozza was not worth it, however the wings were surprisingly large and meaty with good sauce coverage.  We regularly visit Buffalo Wings and we actually found this a bit better.  So we thought we may have found a good new regular place for wings.  

The dining room remained empty throughout our dinner although a few people came into the bar area.  Maybe this place gets busy later, however for a prime time Saturday night, this was puzzling and it should have been a warning.  It felt like we had rented the whole dining area for the night, which was not half bad, being peaceful and quiet dinner.

So come time to pay, the waitress informs us that her manager notes that this coupon is not valid on wings and is intended to be for other items such as souvlaki, etc. 

This is the Discount Description:

---
Enjoy one complimentary LUNCH OR DINNER ENTREE when a second LUNCH OR DINNER ENTREE of equal or greater value is purchased - maximum discount $25.00

valid anytime
---

We asked our waitress if she could check again to see if they could do anything and she returned and mentioned that their manager was nice enough to take both apps off the bill.  

We have used Entertainment coupons everywhere for MANY years and this is the first place where we have encountered resistance to THEIR OWN COUPON. 

Being a long day we just accepted and mumbled, grumbled and left, vowing to never ever come back due to the way we were treated even though the food was not bad.

A Saturday night... near empty.... poor waitress and collecting tips for the night.... 2 potential new repeat customers trying a new place and getting resistance in using their own coupon by the rules.

I realize we have a 'coupon' and we do not drink alcohol, however if you do not want to honour YOUR OWN COUPON properly, than maybe DO NOT OFFER A COUPON.  (Also, do not think we are cheap, as we dropped hundreds on a meal a few weeks ago at a high end sushi joint ('Ja Bistro' downtown) and service/food was impeccable.).  If you do not appreciate new customers and my new money, than I will thankfully after this visit, never give you another cent ever.

To top it off as we were driving away, we spotted a family of 4 peaking through the window and stopped and went next door to Tim Hortons, which is what we should have done in hindsight."}
{"text":"Service is god awful. The server took 20 minutes to take our orders and argued with us over deal ticker coupon and gave us attitude about it. She brought more beers before we finished our first ones without asking and over all just had an awful attitude. Atmosphere is kinda dirty and more then half the light bulbs are out. Wings are mediocre."}
{"text":"The original location in Richmond Hill, Ontario has already closed, and now the \"franchise\" is down to just this location in Mississauga, Ontario.

It is an almost empty bar sports bar, even on a Saturday night.

There was a list of rap artists scheduled for 9:00 pm, something that didn't really fit in with a Mexican / bar / wing establishment vibe; we departed just before the $5.00 cover would have been asked, and arrival of security.

The food was decent as far as wings, fries, and ribs go; however, it was generally overpriced.

Don't even bother bringing in any type of discount coupon, management doesn't honour them. You will need to argue with the manager to get half of what you should receive."}
{"text":"The place was dead, it was a Thursday night in February... So that may not be the case all year. They have a fair beer selection and typical bar offerings, nothing special or notable. I had the \"Krazy jambalaya\" and it was hot... (I like spicy food) probably too hot for most to enjoy the rest of the dish. Talked with the new head cook, he asked how my food was and after explaining the heat, he said it would be fixed. Overall, an okay place."}
{"text":"NOTE: I think the place has shut down recently.

I have been here several times - initially used to eat there, but then just took the food to go (I live 5 minutes from the place - made sense to do it at home).

First time I went with my buddy we were really happy - simple place where you can take your friends, the kind of nice neighborhood place. Met the owner who was really nice. Wings were off the hook, delicious, crispy and could really taste the individual flavors. My buddy labelled them best wings in town, after we had tried several pubs and specialized wing places (Wild Wings, Buffalo Wings, Wing Machine etc). Tried their suicide sauce which was truly suicidal... Alcohol a bit on the expensive side, but that's the case with most places. Only thing that shocked me was that the place was really empty (it is a big place, but still) - and it was a Friday night around 8PM.  

Second time was good as well - but slowly the quality of the wings was going down, a tad soggier and harder to taste the individual flavors. Place was still empty, this time on a Saturday (a bit earlier though, it was around 6PM). The owner told us that the place fills up when they have live music - never stayed late enough to see that.

Eventually we started coming in just to get take-out wings - the wings were becoming worse and worse, soggier and cheap on the sauce - at a certain point we couldn't even tell which wing was which. Eventually started asking them extra crispy to avoid that soggy feel - improved them a bit but wasn't impressed anymore. 

Not long ago I noticed that the lights are off even Saturday night and see no activity inside. I haven't gone to check - but it seems that the place is closed now. Given the previous review saying that this is the last location - this may be very well the end of the franchise."}
{"text":"Just tried this place the other day -- this place has the BEST wings!!! The wings here are huge and there are 75 flavours to choose from.  The two flavours we tried were really good and the servers were great.  

We had a pound of wings each and also ordered their Angus burger with cactus fries to share.  The burger was pretty good and the price was awesome.  The toppings were fresh, crisp and still cold (Unlike other places that put warm lettuce and soggy onions on your burger!).  Their fries were crispy and just right.  

Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Ordered the penne pollo. Big time disappointment.lacking flav!!
No cactus fries despite on menu and restaurant name. Bunch of excuses!!!
Frozen stuff was as expected... can't really screw that up. ie jalepeno poppers, fries, chicken fingers"}
{"text":"As has been stated above, the wings should be called giant wings! It's fun trying out all the different types that are offered! They are cooked fresh - hence a possible \"wait\" time, but that would be preferred to eating a dried up, sitting around all day par-cooked wing, no? There are  different specials daily, too many to list.  The fries are very tasty, too. I can't post about any other menu items, because I just head there weekly for the super-fantastic wings!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Went for wings and ribs. Came out satisfied.
 Excellent. Nice big clean place.
Sports bar ambiance but nice and bright
Was waited upon by Nicky. (lovely service)
$7.50 for a Corona???"}
{"text":"This place didn't have a lot of promo for the opening but slowly its getting busier. It has really good deals. On sunday you can get half price apps and $5 per pound of wings, which are huge and delicious! They have fair priced beer and combos you can get (beer/wings). 

I have been there a few times and the food is good. It is mexican based food but they have burgers, wings, and other flavours of food. 

the restaurant its self is very very large with a big patio (closed now cause its cold) but in the summer will be nice. Theres a private party section too that seat about 30 i think which is key for that kind of resturant. 

reccomendations: 

Breaded wings- creative flavours: Bollywood, N'orleans, Fow'l Bowl. They regualr flavours as obviously awsome. Great thia and honey g sauce. 

The chicken fingers are awsome! they also have really good fries. For Apps i would say go with the snake bites for sure! Also the jalepeno poppers are really good, but they are super super hot when they just come out so becareful! lol. They have pizze too but it kinda tastes like frozen boxed pizza, not what im looking for when i got a resturant.

I have yet to try the \"mexican\" style stuff but overall this place is really good, quite for now but im sure it will pick up cause the food is awsome!"}
{"text":"It's midnight and we just got home from trying this place for the first time..  To summarize i would say This place is a bargain, seriously...

My brother told me he was doing work in the area and to try this place out because he and his coworkers both loved the food...

Me and the GF stopped in for their daily special which was $25 for a pitcher and 2 pounds of jumbo wings..  10 bucks for 2 pounds and 15 for the pitcher sounds like a great deal to me..  Especially compared to the prices at my local pub in Brampton

In my opinion a great deal for the size of the wings.  another thing that many will like is that they seem to be undusted and crispy.  Huge portions for the price , I don't see them this cheap anywhere else and we both love our beers and wings

They have too many sauces and more importantly too many that sound un appealing .. My suggestion to them would be get rid of those useless flavors and focus on homemade ones that are really good

The beer came in frozen branded glasses which is great too, exactly what you want in the summer

Server was an older fellow who was very friendly

I was pleasantly surprised enough to write this"}
{"text":"We actually had a really great time at the Krazy Cactus when we were in Mississauga for the TFConvention. I think we went there all three nights. 

The service was great -- which is why we kept coming back and the wings were great, and lots of flavour selections and the prices were reasonable."}
{"text":"THE BEST WING PLACE EVER!

FOOD
On Tuesdays, you can get 1lb of wings for $5. That's super amazing! They catch you on the drink ($2.75) but meh...you pay $5 for the best wings ever!

The wings should be called GIANT WINGS. They are HUGE.  And they are cooked fresh right when you order. You can taste the difference.

You can select from 75 different flavours. (don't try the dill unless you really really like dill). The Bourbon was very good.

DAILY SPECIALS
Monday -   2 toppings 12' pizza + Pitcher of domestic beer $19.99
so Tuesday is Wing night
Wednesday 2 for 1 pasta dish + Line dancing
Friday pizza 3 toppings for 12 inch pizza $10.99
Saturday - Domestic pitcher and Nachos
Sunday NFL Games - Angus burger and fries $7.99
1/2 price appetizers after 9

SERVICE
The man who served was was really nice. He let us know
- the restaurant has only been opened for 4 mths
- the wings started out big, and then became small but now are big again
- the specials they have each night (see above)

My only issue was that the service was so SLOW and this is the main reason for the 1 star deduction.  It was obvious my group was in a hurry. The server took a while to get our orders, to give us our food (this was more understandable b/c the wings were freshly cooked), to get us our bill and to return our change.  A 1 hour dinner took 2 hours with two servers working and the restaurant was practically empty."}
{"text":"Great wings and service is nice! Quiet during the day but apparently picks up after 2! Hope they stay around :)"}
{"text":"+ Lots of seating, cool bar section
-  Wings aren't that great

Went here on a Saturday night.  It was pretty quiet.  There is a lot of seating in this place with a separate bar area and a nice section with dart boards.  We sat in a booth where they have the elevated seating.  The waitress was super friendly, she said the place used to be a Mexicali Rosa's.  

We ordered the wings and souvlaki pita.  I agree with another reviewer, they have far too many sauces to choose from.  The food came within 20 minutes.  The wings were buffalo style, they seemed a little overcooked.  They were good, but didn't taste outstanding, the sauce really didn't taste like typical buffalo wing sauce.  They were $10 for 8, which seems a little high.  The chicken souvlaki pita was tasty with a nice portion.

I think this place is best for just hanging out with your friends. They have a large outdoor patio."}
{"text":"Really good wings ... So much better than All stars ! And they have 75 favors ... I always try the Cajun so I'm not bias by the favour and honestly I was not disappointed .. Also 29.99 everyday for a pitcher and 2bls of wings, that's a pretty good deal"}
