{"text":"Very good pizza! Can't beat the price. Awesome staff. The owner is very nice and outgoing. I don't live in the area and I would come back."}
{"text":"Ordered for the first time the other night because my boy was hungry when he finished playing ball at Falcone Field.  I was inside waiting for my pie and had a nice conversation with the owner.  I witnessed first hand what he did to make the food as good as could be.  He was making a Buffalo Chicken Pizza.  It looked delicious and I asked \"kiddingly\" if I could change my order.  What I noticed is that he cooked the fresh chicken specifically for this pie.  I know it may not be that big of a deal, but I would think that most shops would just cook up a bunch of chicken at the beginning of the day, cut into chunks and refrigerate it, and just grab and go for each pizza as they were put together. Not this shop.  This to me was a subtle example at how much they want their food to be fresh.  The pizza that I received was to order.  I am NOT a fan of thick, gooey, chewy, globbie pizza that seems to be the norm in the Burgh.  This was thin crust which was a bit crispy which I love. I will definitely be returning and this time probably will be trying one of those Buffalo Chicken Pizzas!"}
{"text":"They started offering lunch and pizza by the slice as well as opened up an outside seating area to enjoy your food for lunch and dinner. It looks really nice. The pizza is delicious and everything else I have tried has always been good."}
{"text":"Note that \"Family Restaurant\" does not mean dine in at this location. During warm months, there is sometimes outdoor seating."}
{"text":"We ordered from here about a month ago and got a traditional style pizza and it was very very good, we found a new pizza place! Ordered again tonight and this time we went with a Sicilian square style and it was terrible. The dough tasted like it was 3 days old and they just reheated the pizza and then delivered to us."}
{"text":"The pizza and the people are great. The crust was awesome. The toppings were plentiful. The pie maker even asked us how well done we wanted ours. They were willing to customize my girlfiend\"s gluten free pizza.  Highly recommend this place. Best pizza in Canonsburg!"}
{"text":"I live in Bulger but I work in Eighty Four, so I pass this place every single day twice a day. After almost a year of telling myself to stop in and \"just order a dang pizza already!\", I finally did. I regret having waited so long. I'm not really a review-leaving type of girl but this place is an exception. I've eaten many a pizzas in my day and this place has placed itself all the way up to the top(to be fair I was raised on commercial pizza joints but I know good quality food when I taste it). So back to the story. I finally stopped in and it was easy to tell they were up to their necks. Still, they were immediately receptive to me strolling in and politely told me it would be a minute. When it came time, I ordered a pretty simple pizza - a 12\" 8-cut with a single topping, mild pepper rings(I'm a sucker for these bad boys). I was told the wait would be about 30 minutes. Average wait time for a pizza, no biggie. I went out to my car and chilled for a bit. I set my timer for 15 minutes, figuring it wouldn't be bad to wait the rest of the 15 inside the pizza shop. 15 minutes rolled by and I putzed around for another 2 or 3 minutes before going in to the shop. So I went in, and right as I'm passing the threshold, one of the pizza guys(I'm sorry I didn't catch the guys name, he was busy working y'know) is setting my pizza down on the counter. Perfect timing and much earlier than expected. I paid and was on my way. So I'm driving home and this pizza smells incredible. I manage to drive the rest of the 30 minutes home without sneaking a piece, and even after the wait, this pizza is still straight up fresh. Hot, cheese still gooey, the whole deal. The best parts of this pizza were the crust and the sauce. I don't even know how I'd describe either but \"omg\" could do it justice. The crust was nice and soft inside but super crisp to bite into. The sauce tasted fresh, and it had that \"homemade\" taste. I hate saying that because its very cliche, but you know what I'm talking about. I would definitely recommend this place if you're in the area."}
{"text":"The family that owns it seems really. The pizza was very good and I loved the hoagie. We got a Hawaiian pizza and the Philly hoagie! It is a little but on the expensive side. But besides that, it's very good!!"}
{"text":"Great pies. Great service. Great prices. What more do you need? Beer. But they're working on that!!! Yay."}
{"text":"Love the pizza here! A little pricey but you get what you pay for. All fresh ingrediants. Our favorite is the buffalo chicken pizza!"}
{"text":"I order from here every now and again, a very solid pizza place in Canonsburg. Speciality pizza's are very good. No reason to order a pizza from any where else in Canonsburg. The calzones and fried foods are good too. They deliver on time, the pizza is hot and they've never messed an order up for me. Try the buffalo chicken with a side of garlic parm fries."}
{"text":"We stopped into Arleo's while visiting the area. First, the pizza was awesome! I wanted extra pineapple and they hooked me up good! On top of the good pizza, Will, the manager was the nicest! He was friendly, fun and made our experience so enjoyable. We left there talking about how nice he was! Also, I don't think I've ever been to a cleaner pizza shop, I probably saw him wash his hands 3 or 4 times in the short time I was there. I definitely recommend Arleo's!"}
{"text":"We order pizza from there often.  They have been great with making sure everything is safe for our daughter who has a peanut allergy.  The food is good and the owner and staff are friendly."}
{"text":"This is the 3rd time my husband and I have ordered from Arleos.  I have lived in Canonsburg for over 4 years and finally found a restaurant that has an amazing grilled chicken salad.  All ingredients are fresh with spring leaf lettuce and spinach leafs.  House Italian dressing is awesome.  My husband is a pizza guru and says the \"heat lovers\" is the best with a variety of fresh toppings.  Very friendly staff, and delivery is always fast with the food arriving hot.  Enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"Right on! Lee and his crew got it goin on.  Great pizza.  Best meatball sub in the area without question."}
{"text":"2+ hours for delivery, even though they said it would take 80 minutes. When questioned about it, employee got an attitude. The food came cold. You could tell it was cooked and placed in a warmer. The \"new mac & cheese bites\" should be discontinued. They're awful. The pizza is nothing special, and the sauce is mehhhh. If you like your teeth, don't order any breadsticks. I thought I was eating a garlic butter piece of cardboard. I will never order from this place again."}
{"text":"We've ordered the pizza many times. It has always been great. I love the crust.  They are always friendly.  We recently moved into the neighborhood and were excited to have a great pizza place so close."}
{"text":"Some of the best traditional pizza anywhere, with a great fresh dough crust and balanced flavors with the sauce and toppings.  The ownership does seem to care about product quality and customer satisfaction, and proactively offered to remake a pizza for me when they realized that their oven was under-temp, even though I did not complain.  I declined the remake because the pizza was fine, but they were clearly concerned about my satisfaction.  They have a small seating area on the side of the building, with multiple tables and umbrellas to shield from the sun (but it is otherwise uncovered, so would not be usable in inclement weather).  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Super nice people and great food!!!  Finally, a place that cares about their customers and also their young employees.  Great food from great people. Highly recommend their thick crust pizza, can't get anything close to it anywhere!"}
{"text":"The staff took strict measures.  Dedicated space , cleaned ovens, washed hands.  On top of that, the best GF pizza I've had in Pittsburgh. This is Gluten free pizza at its best"}
{"text":"I've been to Arleo's a few times.  I've had their pizza and Italian sub, both being very good.  You can't beat the price and the staff/owner are some of the nicest people you'll meet.  It's one small local business I love to support for all the reasons above."}
{"text":"So far, still our favorite pizza & excellent delivery. Toppings are delish & just enough."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza and amazing service! Visiting from Texas on business and had to try one of their pizzas based on the other reviews. It did not disappoint! Will try to come back here any time I'm in the Pittsburgh area."}
{"text":"I had a hot sub from Arleo's several years ago and it was pretty lackluster. Today however we took a gamble and ordered their classic pizza, with the veggies split half-and-half. When my wife stopped to pick it up, the server showed her the pizza to make sure they had made it correctly. When she got home, we enjoyed one of the best pizzas we've had in years. The sauce was bright, acidic, and well-seasoned. The meat was flavorful and seemed fresh. The crust was deliciously crispy on the outside, but still soft on the inside. I devoured half the pie in one sitting. The prices are certainly higher than most other local venues - we paid $21 for a large specialty.  But I feel like I got what I paid for, and I can safely say we'll be back.  Maybe the subs are even better now!"}
{"text":"First about me... I am passionate about pizza. I have ate at over 10,000 different  pizza chains in the last 25 years in 50 different cities.      This pizza is by far one of the best and most unique experiences I have ever had. Everything screamed fresh and smelled delicious! I could not wait to take my first bite. We ordered one round pie and one Sicilian both with pepperoni.  I would describe the sauce as being sweet bright and zesty. You can also tell that they're using a high-quality flour, it's got a nice sponginess to it with a great bite. The sauce the cheese ratio is spot-on with these guys as well as the toppings. The way the flavors meld is unheard of in other chains. To me it's like they painted a picture with flavor. I would definitely recommend this for anybody who likes Pizza.  To touch on the service a little bit.. it felt like family when I talk to them. They never made me feel rushed or unwanted.. I even called them back to let them know how great their product is and that I will be ordering more frequently.  This pizza is now my favorite pizza in the Canonsburg-Greater Pittsburgh area."}
{"text":"Well I guess I am not in the norm in this review. I wasn't impressed, and I'm sad about that. I made my order online which was easy enough and was given a 45-75 minute window for delivery. It arrived right on time at an hour, good start. The price was very steep so I was expecting a fantastic meal. We went with 2 large gourmet pizzas, the Steakinator and Chicken Bacon Ranch and an order of cheesey bread sticks. I have never seen so much cheese on something than I did when we opened the box to the cheesy bread sticks. Now I love cheese as much as the next person, but this was absolutely ridiculous. Never did I think if say something had too much cheese, but these did.  And the amount of grease in the box was overwhelming. They tasted good, but could have been fantastic with a little bit of restraint. The pizzas were also very nicely topped with a plethora of toppings, spread all the way to the edge of the pizzas like I expect. You can tell time was put into making them. But again with the grease, all over the box. Yes I realize that pizza is greasy, but it just seems out of the ordinary with our order. I'm skeptical to order again, but I feel like Arleos has so many good reviews that maybe we should give it another chance. I'm going to keep an open mi nd and think about it. Until then, 3 is the best I can give."}
{"text":"We came into town with a team of 23 and they did a great job getting all the food out quickly with great food that everyone loved."}
{"text":"Had the \"small\" meatball calzone and it was not only huge but also the best calzone I've ever had. I'll be back next time I visit Canonsburg."}
{"text":"Arleo's is absolutely the best pizza in Guntown. Fresh, hot generous toppings, quick delivery...all the things you expect but don't always get. They are always friendly and let you have a look at what's under the box lid before you take it, and that extra plop of cheese on the hot pizza is always welcome.  Recently I got the \"philly all the way\" sub and it was pretty much transcendent. No Steak-ums here, and when they say baked to perfection, they mean it!  Way to go, guys!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in Cannonsburg, the white pizza is outstanding & the owner is very friendly and wants the best for his customers! Order the white pizza chicken spinach and ricotta that will not disappoint!!"}
