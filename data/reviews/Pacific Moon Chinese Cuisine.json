{"text":"excellent food, a little spendy. Don't sit in the tables next to the bar. The kitchen door open sand close conactantly"}
{"text":"Just Horrible.  I've been here several times now and each time it seems the quality drops down another notch.  At first I was quite impressed when they initially opened but my impression has changed now 180 degrees.  I had the special tonight (BBQ ribs with rice and soup).  The hot and sour soup is now dull,  gelatinous and not hot at all.  The ribs were dry,  over sauced and tough.  I kept thinking I would find one that wasn't as tough or dry as the last.  No such luck.  They tasted as if they were cooked several  days earlier and reheated with more sauce. Perhaps that's why they were the \"special\". Just horrible,  and overpriced.  I actually don't feel well. I'm sorry to say so but this is a restaurant I won't be going back to."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, VERY clean.  Waitress Kristen is very hospitable and very welcoming.  
The cuisine is excellent and flavorful.  The vegetables are extremely fresh.  Will recommend Pacific Moon to all my friends.  This is the best restaurant I have visited since moving to Fountain Hills over a year ago."}
{"text":"Pacific Moon may appear to be your typical Chinese restaurant, but the food and flavors are anything but typical. Having had the Hot & Sour Soup as well as the Szechwan Chicken, I found both to be very fresh and super delicious. I would without hesitation recommend Pacific Moon to anyone looking for exceptional Chinese food in the Fountain Hills area. I know I'll certainly be returning in the very near future."}
{"text":"Walked into an empty restaurant. Now I know why. Exceedingly bland and uninspired food. To be punitive, the service was good"}
{"text":"Placed an order at about 4:30 for a 6:00 pick-up, should have taken the fact that they were out of snow peas as a sign. Got to the location and the place was NOT here, but Asian Bistro was, called the number and they indeed were the same place. Would have been good info for them to share when I phoned my order in. My husband runs in to pick it up and they say that they don't have an order for our phone number. He gets back in the car, I call and start rattling off my order that she has told me repeatedly does not exist and then recites my order (that I didn't get a chance finish giving her) back to me, oh yes, we do have an order from you, I'm told. But you already picked it up I'm told....ummmm, no, we didn't, and it's a pretty big order, hard for someone else to likely walk off with. So she says they can make it....so I think what a great opportunity to pen a review, so as I sit in my car.....here it is, my review. .....We'll see how the food is. Update: so they were kind enough to give us a 20% discount on our order. Get home and dig in. Spring rolls were ok, crisp, not too greasy but nothing special. I was told the egg rolls were ok (I don't eat pork and they do not have any other non-pork options) I ordered a shrimp dish, beef dish and a chicken dish, none of it was great. Runny, and even after a full pouch of soy sauce my portion was still bland. The veggies didn't seem that fresh and after all the holiday leftovers I was just really looking for some good Chinese. Don't look here if your after the same thing as I was."}
{"text":"Great Chinese food at fountain hill. The restaurant keep clean and looks nice, will come back again"}
{"text":"This restaurant is CLOSED.  Too bad they didn't make it but one time we ate there, food just ok.  When they charge $2.95 to have \"extra\" celery put in dish, you know they are not going to make it.  Completely empty restaurant now."}
{"text":"Newly opened on Dec. 31, 2012  Have eaten here twice since it opened, excellent food! Great relaxed atmosphere. Friendly service. No liquor license yet but coming soon, (within a couple weeks.)"}
{"text":"Overpriced, decor is lousy, customer service is less than friendly.  Don't waste your time here.  Food is just 'ok'."}
{"text":"What a wonderful find! My wife and I ordered take-out, to try out the new restaurant.  The food is delicious! Just dropping in to pick up our order, the atmosphere appeared to have good ambiance. We will return, again and again!"}
{"text":"We just tried this new Chinese restaurant in Fountain Hills and it's great.  Good service and excellent food.  Walnut shrimp was delicious with big shrimp and a great sauce.  Fried tofu is not easy to make but they did it.  It was lightly fried and the vegetables were crisp and definitely fresh.  So much food we needed a take-out box.  This is definitely going on our favored restaurant list."}
{"text":"Wow, I just had a very pleasant lunch right up  until I receive my bill. the menu price for my lunch with 799, and the finish bill ended up being 12 dollars and 50 cents. when I ask if the tea that I ordered cost 4 dollars the woman behind the counter told me no, the tea was include with lunch. We looked at the bill and not only was the Tea not included,  they also charged me for an eggroll. I then asked them to correct the check and they refused. I asked the man when did I ever order an egg roll? and his reply was I asked you if you wanted an egg roll. when I tried to explain to him that I didn't know that there was a cost involved he compared it to as if he had offered me a beer. in the end they made 12 dollars and 50 cents from me and will never see another penny of my money. buyer beware"}
{"text":"Probably the best place for Chinese food in fountain hills. Food is pretty good and the staff is friendly. No complaints"}
{"text":"Awful food. AWFULLER service!
It is seriously offensive how RUDE the people that work here are. We tolerated it for several months until the food started to SERIOUSLY BECOME DISGUSTING. Like most businesses in FH it seems they started to struggle a lot over the past summer and the quality of the food went from tolerable yet overpriced to NASTY and tasting like the sweet and sour chicken was made with listerine and ketchup. Then they send the wrong order and when we call to ask they send exactly what we ordered, the guy tries to charge my husband again for the orders that were missing and made it seem like a huge pain in the a$$ for them to bring the correct orders to our house just five minutes away. My husband is MUCH nicer and more patient than me so when I see him start to get frustrated with the jerk running the front I know we have been severly wronged. Furthermore I asked for 2 additional fortune cookies for my children and they refused even when I offered to pay a dollar a piece for them. They are Nazi's with their brown rice too and if they dont have any made they will just send you white rice and they act like it is SUCH AN INCONVENIENCE TO MAKE SOME BROWN RICE....why is brown rice even  on your damn menu?  This place completely sucks and their service sucks even more than their nasty crappy food.. Im sure it will go out of business in no time like all the other Chinese food places in FH that start decent, turn nasty and angry and rude and then flop. We used to eat here once a week since they opened but now Im never eating there again. What a tragic disappointment!"}
{"text":"Pretty good. I just wish there were more tofu or vegetarian options listed. :(

A dish that stood out the most was the salt and pepper tofu. It's listed on the appetizer menu, and it was super tasty! Next time I would get that as part of my main dish, and order some stir fried veggies to go with that or something. 

Being that I'm used to getting Chinese food in Los Angeles that is pretty damn good and a lot cheaper, I'm spoiled with that.

Nonetheless, I guess living in Fountain Hills does not give you the option to eat like in LA of course. I am grateful this place exists. Service was good.

They have pad thai on the menu which was interesting. This neighborhood could sure use a purely Thai cuisine restaurant instead. If they are going to mix up the types of Asian foods there, you might as well throw in some. Korean or Vietnamese while your at it and make everyone happy since you can't find these foods in Fountain hills."}
{"text":"Delicious!  We ordered the seafood pot and the won ton soup, and both were excellent.  The soup was filled with perfectly cooked vegetables and, as another reviewer mentioned, the won tons were fresh and flavorful -- nothing \"packaged\" here.  What a treat to have this fine new restaurant in Fountain Hills.  We will return often."}
{"text":"Well, it took me long enough! I ordered the pan fried noodles with chicken, and used their on-line coupon for the dumplings. I enjoyed both, nice large entre servings. The pan fried noodles were delightfully crispy, but softened-up nicely after soaking in the light yet savoury brown sauce the chicken and veggies came in. The dumplings were perfectly cooked. The gal at the counter was very friendly and helpful. Will be back!"}
{"text":"The food was spot on, I had Mongolian Beef and my hubby had the Szechuan Beef they were both very very good. The service was attentive and courteous, very good. The restaurant was kept clean and inviting it was a wonderful experience over all I would recommend this place to anyone, I will Definitely be back."}
{"text":"Overpriced !!!!!!!!!!!!

They are more expensive than Any chinese restaurant ever .Food is ok but the price is insulting. The soup potion is also small. Will never eat here again. Felt ripped off."}
{"text":"Keep it up!  Delicious!!  As New Yorkers, we were very skeptical but pleasantly surprised by the quality and taste of the food!!"}
{"text":"We arrived about 2 hours from closing time so I thought the buffet would still be fairly fresh.  Sadly, everything on the buffet line was cold.  It had good flavor and you could tell that if it was fresh it would be really good.  The staff was very friendly and very nice.  Right before we left they put out some fresh food so I had to try it.  It was what I expected.  It was delicious.  I will have to go again sometime and order from the menu instead of the buffet.  I would recommend this restaurant to a friend but to head the warning of the buffet.  Look at it before you order it."}
{"text":"By far THE best Asian food in Fountain Hills! And they deliver - what a pleasant surprise! I absolutely love their shrimp tempura, and also the tom yam soup. The fried rice was delicious, too. I really missed these dishes, living out here \"in the boonies\". I was truly surprised to find such tasty fare. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Well where do I start! It should have been a bell ringer when we walked in and there was no one there. The place looked nice and was very clean. I had the honey glazed chicken with fried rice. The one person staff was very nice and gave us good service. When we were served our meal it came out looking like it had been sitting in a fridge and had just been microwaved. Basically it tasted just like that. The chicken had been deep fried to death in grease that tasted like it hadn't been changed in a month. The fried rice had obviously been heated up in a microwave and was as bland as it looked. The only reason I gave it one star is because the waiter was very nice and treated us well. As for the food, I wouldn't waste your time. Definately won't be coming back here again!"}
{"text":"I have only ordered delivery from them and they are almost always on time if not early. 

The only reason I didnt give 4 or 5 stars would be because of the staff. Sometimes the driver that comes will actually ask for more tip. Thats a big turn off. A tip is a tip and we give that based on our own feeling as to whats reasonable, it shouldnt be demanded. We are never stingy in our tip so I know whatever we have given has been a fair amount. 

food is pretty good but nothing out of the ordinary. your typical american/chinese food."}
{"text":"My wife, daughter and I stopped in for dinner. 

The place was kind of busy and the service was okay. 

My wife ordered the Mu Su pork, I ordered the Combination pan fried noodles and my daughter the Orange Chicken.
The hoisin sauce the comes with Mu Su seemed to be watered down, not as thick as it should be. The ingredients were very fresh.
My pan fried noodles was excellent with fresh vegetables but too much sauce and not enough noodles. 
My daughters Orange Chicken was different. The chicken is sliced and not cubed and the dish also include the orange rind that was cooked beyond recognition. One note is that you can order it breaded or plain.
When you've had Chinese food in San Francisco for as many years as I have had you do get spoiled."}
{"text":"As always best food & best service in town.  I really like so many of their dishes but my favorite has to be the scratch made hot & sour soup!"}
{"text":"I took my mother for dinner at Pacific Moon the other day.  We were instantly greeted with smiles and the hostess showed us to our table right away.  The menu is great and reasonably priced.  I read through reviews before going and from what was said about the prices I expected it to be more expensive.  The food was amazingly fresh, the service was good and the decor was pleasant.  I will be back."}
{"text":"Horrible horrible place! 

My sister, niece, and grandparents went here for Valentines Day to try out the \"new restaurant in town.\" I must say that it was nothing short of horrible.

When we first walked in we stood there for about five minutes before anyone greeted us. They were pretty busy due to it being Valentine's Day...and whenever a new restaurant in Fountain Hills opens up, it's the buzz of the town for a few weeks. Anyway, we're finally seated in the back by the kitchen. We sit there for about 15 minutes before the waitress comes to take our drink order. We wound up putting our drinks in with our appetizer and food because we had so much time to decide. I ordered the pepper beef and asked if they could substitute tofu for the beef, as I'm a vegetarian. They said that this was no problem. 

About 10 minutes later our drinks arrive and they must have been sitting out for a really long time because the ice was all melted in them. Still no appetizer. By then, my sister, who is a waitress was growing irritable because she has two kids to feed and our appetizer still wasn't out. 

Finally, after about 25-30 minutes our food comes out and it's wrong. My grandfather, who is a diabetic, does not get his and my dish is wrong. Still no appetizer. 

My sister gets up to get the waitress who walks over, shrugs her shoulders and walks away. No apology, no remedy, nothing. So, finally, after 15 minutes, my food finally comes out correctly. My grandfather still doesn't get his. 

When the waitress came back around we asked to speak to a manager. No manager ever came by and the waitress just started to ignore our table. Our drinks weren't refilled and our check took another 30 minutes to come. What was supposed to be a 45 minute dine-in experience turned into over 2 hours. Get this, despite all of our complaints we were still charged full price! And, this place is NOT cheap. 

When I brought the check up to the owner to complain she just looked at me and kept saying, \"Yeah.....yeah.....yeah.\" In other words, I don't care, go away. 

We will not be back and I hope this place goes out of business!"}
{"text":"We are snowbirds from Canada where Chinese food is usually very good.  Finding a good Chinese food restaurant is pretty hard unless you go to Scottsdale.  This place just opened Dec 31, 2012.  We have had take out & gone there 2 times.  The food is very good.  The atmosphere is great.  The staff are friendly & very competent.  They have a good atmosphere, good food & good staff.  Once their liquor license arrives which is due in a couple of weeks it will then be able to serve liquor as well.  We are hoping they last through the summer as this is a nice place for an evening out as their prices are reasonable as well."}
{"text":"This is by far our favorite place it town!  The food is great, the service is very fast and friendly.  The prices are fair and the portion sizes adequate.  We will continue to come back."}
{"text":"I tried them when they first opened and know. food quality has improved alot !! before food was bland and took long for delivery however I have been impressed enough last couple of orders to write this review. MUST ! singapore noodles ! with or with shrimp, general tso, hot and sour - could use a little more vinegar to my taste thats me, overall food has improved will be going back for more singapore noodles !"}
