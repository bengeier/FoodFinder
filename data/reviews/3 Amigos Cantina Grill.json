{"text":"This place is ok. For me, the comparison was with Chipotle, which I love although there's none out here. The taste is not bad, and the quantity is pretty large. I cannot pin point where it really lacked. I would go here again if I was craving burritos since I haven't been able to find a good burrito place in Montreal. At least nothing of comparison to the Toronto burrito places."}
{"text":"3 amigos is a well known spot for mexican/tex-mex food in Montreal. Its younger sibling, Amigos Cantina Grill, is instead a quick-service restaurant that mainly offers burritos wraps and burrito bowls - similarly to M4 Burritos or Chipotle (in Ontario).  Although Montreal's appetite for such venues has increased in recent years, Amigos Cantina Grill doesn't seem bring anything new. Its food quality is also lacking. Base prices are ok (slightly more expensive than competitors), but the freshness of many toppings (e.g. pico de gallo, corn, coriander) is unsatisfactory. Extra toppings, such as guacamole (2.50$), are too expensive. The burrito wraps are huuuuuge, yet at the same price, the burrito bowls seem to contain less food.  Many improvements could be made to boost this venue's popularity."}
{"text":"Tex-Mex style fast food.  Not too many of them in Montreal.  Decent taste and quality. Seems a little overpriced however.  They do have a alcohol permit, which is a plus.  Will go again for Tex-Mex cravings."}
{"text":"Good place for a burrito experience in the downtown core. Food quality and service are good and prices are pretty reasonable.  Nice casual place for a quick bite."}
