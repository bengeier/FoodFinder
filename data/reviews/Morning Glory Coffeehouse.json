{"text":"I would give them 5 stars if it is not called \"coffee\"house. Love the atmosphere and the food. It's as comfy as a nice friend's living room and their food is as yummy and healthy as from my healthy picky mom.
Wasn't that happy with the latte I got tho. It's like... coffee flavored milk. Well, it's not bad, it's just ordinary..."}
{"text":"this friendly, unpretentious shop has great coffee and the best vibes in town. I come here to catch up with my neighbors, enjoy a latte, read the paper and work on my laptop. In fact, I'm posting from inside the shop RIGHT NOW (oh yeah, they have free wifi). 

Some of my favorite menu items include the bagel-egg-cheese-smoked salmon melt, the house-made chai, their quiches & the italian tuna panini. and of course the coffee is fabulous. they have quiet music performances most weeks, and they're usually pretty good too."}
{"text":"The food and beverages were good; my only qualm was that the service was really slow when I was there, despite the fact that there were only about eight customers sitting around. I'd recommend coming in here for the food and the atmosphere if you're planning to stick around for awhile, but if your time is restricted, you might find the pace frustrating."}
