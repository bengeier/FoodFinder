Only issue I had was with the size of the plates to the space on the table we sat at .. 
I highly recommend this place! 
Cost is also not bad for such great food.."}
{"text":"The service was exceptional, the food was divine, and we didn't pay $75 for our meal. Which made us happy. Highly recommend this tiny little restaurant."}
{"text":"Nous avions de grandes attentes considérant la note élevée de ce resto (4,5/5). Ce dernier est surévalué.

Voici notre verdict:

Beaucoup d'emphase est mis sur la présentation ce qui ne compense pas le manque d'ambiance du restaurant.

Les portions sont généreuses.

Il n'y a pas de salade de papaye au menu!

Nos choix:
- Soupe lemongrass (B+)
- Salade de mangues (A)
- Curry vert (C)
- Émincé de poulet au basilic (B-)

Le service est efficace mais les prix sont un peu élevés.

57$ taxes/service inclus (Pas d'alcool).

À mon avis, manque d'authenticité et prix trop élevés. À Toronto, préférez Nana ou Pai."}
{"text":"A friend invited me to have dinner at a newly opened restaurant co-owned by a friend of his, at The Beaches in Toronto. I am giving this rating based only on the food that we tried because other factors like service would not be that unbiased. 

The pad Thai with shrimp and chicken was very good! Actually on the menu, the option is only for a choice of meat. My friend had wanted to order the chicken version but I pointed out that for pad Thai, using shrimp will give it a better flavor so he made a special request for adding shrimp. The taste was very authentically Thai, so you will not disappoint unless you have grown accustomed and swear by the other more prevalent version in the west which I summarize as ketchup noodle. 

The pad see yew, the less famous noodle dish, is called the soya noodle on the menu. It was also very authentic Thai, where the flat rice noodle is beautifully flavored and flambé 'd with dark soya sauce and served with green crunchy stir fried Chinese broccoli green, carrot and chicken of meat. Chicken or beef would go very well for this dish. 

We also had one of their signature dishes, their spicy holy basil chicken, another favorite Thai dish: minced chicken stir fried with Thai hot peppers, basil leaves, long string beans, in possibly Maggi arome saveur sauce, and served with jasmine rice and topped with a fried egg. Also very authentically cooked, the only variation would be the amount of heat from the hot peppers that you can request. 

Their mango sticky rice, a Thai dessert, was very pretty but also very delicious, again very authentic. Leave some room for that. Would love to go back next time for the curries and tom yum soup

The only downside was that it took somewhat longer than usual to get our food. It is a new restaurant so maybe the chef is still trying to get used to the kitchen and the momentum. Food is definitely very authentic, and staff was very nice to us (of course) but I noticed he was also very attentive to the other diners and put in effort to chat with customers."}
{"text":"Came here after being in the area and craving Thai food. Thanks Yelpers! Cuz of you we had some of the best Thai food we've come across in the city. 

Super recommended and yes, call ahead for reservations."}
{"text":"We were thrilled to have found this Thai restaurant in the Queen Street  East neighbourhood. Everything we ordered was really tasty, especially the mango salad and Khao Soi chicken.
The service was superb, the presentation extremely attractive, and the price very reasonable.
Highly recommended!!!! We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Great restaurant! The decor was nice, staff friendly, food tasty and the care they put into their presentation was top notch. 

Will be back!"}
{"text":"We happened to go here because of the reviews on Yelp and this place does not disappoint! The service is so good, our servers were unbelievably pleasant. As for the food,you have to try it for yourself to believe how succulent it is! I'm not salad person and I loved the mango salad, really nice flavors. And the satay chicken and the pad Thai with shrimp, and the absolute cashewwith beef(I forget the exact name), I could eat till my seams burst! The sticky mango cake looked delicious but everyone wants too stuffed to have anymore, highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"My first time here this year. 

Amazing food and superb service from the team!!! Will definitely tell everyone about this thai kitchen in Toronto!"}
{"text":"So happy there is finally a good Thai restaurant nearby and we no longer have to head downtown to treat ourselves! We've tried Pattaya twice since they've opened--dine in (for 4) and takeout. Presentation is beautiful and service was polished and so prompt. 

Everyone was happy with what they ordered: squash fritters, khao soi, green curry with chicken, yellow curry and the pad thai.

I ordered the pad Thai and thought the flavours were on point but was a bit saucy for my liking. However when we ordered the pad thai again for takeout it was perfect. No issues with takeout--it wasn't a busy evening so we didn't have to wait long at all. Everything tasted as hot and delicious as if we had dined in. They also gave us free fried wontons with our order :)"}
{"text":"This is a fantastic new addition to the east end of the Beaches area of Toronto. Always delicious food always timely delivery. I haven't been disappointed in any dish yet. All so yummy!"}
{"text":"Bravo! A Thai restaurant in the beaches with wonderful flavours that does not cost an arm and a leg. Peanut curry to dye for! Yummy fresh pad thai, outstanding presentation, all this served with a great smile. Long live Pattaya Thai Kitchen!"}
{"text":"2nd time here n the experience was below average!! Food was v inconsistent in terms of spicyness n flavor. Also pad thai was flavorless in taste. Most disappointing was red curry, it was bland. 

I so excitedly took few of my frens here after a good first experience n we were all disappointed with the food especially Thai regular Pad Thai. 

Review 1: 

(Fantastic Thai food, nice cosy place and right spices! Keep it up Pattaya thai. 

Had the signature Holy Basil Chicken which has become my must have. And the Pad Thai was great too. 

My vegetarian frens had good options and they loved their food. 

The seating and decor is beautiful.)"}
{"text":"My wife and I enjoyed a take away last night from the newly opened Pattaya Thai. It's literally across from our house so very conveniently located.
Full marks for flavour, freshness, portion size and value. My order was the curry pad thai with chicken and my wife loved her panang curry chicken sided with sticky rice.
Inside the restaraunt is small but nicely decorated.
I can see this particular restaraunt becoming a take out hot spot.

Thank you Pattaya..will be back."}
{"text":"I had dinner there tonight and was thoroughly impressed. Very good, fresh food. Quality furnishings and cutlery (I know, but I hate the flimsy cheap stuff). I'll be back for the good food and service, for sure! A great addition to our Beaches neighbourhood even if it's a bit off the beaten path."}
{"text":"WOW, my wife recommended we order from there as she had it a couple of times with friends. Having being disappointed with other local Thai restaurants I said let's give it a shot. The food is simply fantastic, along with fast, free delivery. Very reasonably priced too. I hear the interior is gorgeous also, it's on my list for date night."}
{"text":"Delicious!!! I visited Pattaya for lunch on a Friday with a group of five. (Tip: The restaurant is small, with maybe 16 seats, so call ahead for reservations.)

Here's what I had:

Starter: Squash fritters 
- yummy!
- 5 or 6 large fritters per order
- Comes with a lovely house made tamarind sauce (sweet and tangy). 
- I was happy that the fritters weren't pieces of squash dipped in batter. The squash was incorporated into the batter making the fritters fluffy in texture. 
- There were a lot of delicate and delicious flavours going on. 
- Have not seen this dish before. 
- Everyone in the group enjoyed the fritters. 

Soup: Veggie Coconut Soup - regular size
- Very good flavours 
- Lots of fresh veggies
- Generous portion
- Their soup was one of the better ones I've had

Main: Spicy Basil Noodle
- I was stuffed from the soup and fritters, but managed a few bites. They were delicious!
- Thick noodles stir fried with veggies, tofu and a spicy basil sauce. Nice heat, good flavour to the sauce. Right balance of basil. 
- It tasted good as leftovers the next day!

We'll definitely be back. The service was very friendly. The food is great. The lunch menu is a great value. The rest of my group enjoyed their dishes and one person from our group returned to Pattaya two days later!"}
{"text":"Great place. We do delivery orders and the food is very tasty and you can tell made fresh.  They are very good about modifying the dishes to accommodate food allergies, etc.  and plenty of food."}
{"text":"It isn't often that I make it out to the Beaches area these days, but when I do, obligatory eating transpires. On a late Saturday afternoon, we waited for about five minutes before our party of two was seated in this small (but not tiny) Queen Street restaurant. Having just bought some Holy Basil for my herb garden, I immediately felt the need to order the Holy Basil lunch dish, with chicken. Obviously I need to set a baseline for my future cookery. As an accompaniment, a tall glass of thai iced tea.

After a quick trip downstairs to the washroom to give my hands a wash, a spring roll appear in front of me. I didn't order a spring roll... wtf? But it turns out that it comes with one! Woah. It was good. Hot, crispy, savoury, and most importantly, not greasy. An amazing spring roll experience.

After setting the bar so high, the thai iced tea arrive and this too did not disappoint. Once I gave it a good swirl to bring it to its final deep red-brown hue (and also to mix in the dairy), I took a long blissful sip. The rich, bold flavour brought back childhood memories of running through fields of grass along the country side, devoid of all cares in the world. Actually, it didn't. But it was delicious, and the flavour *was* rich and bold with strong black tea undertones, mellowed by a gentle sweetness.

Next came the ... Holy Basil? Wait. Where's the basil? After digging around a bit, I found a few pieces here and there, but it wasn't as basily as I would have expected. In fact, it wasn't basily at all. Instead, it was salty, like someone added too much soy sauce and not enough of anything else. But that said, I didn't not finish it, although towards the end when the rice supply was running thin, it was getting difficult.

So would I come back? Probably. Would I order the same main? Probably not. 1 star for the spring roll, 1 star for the thai iced tea, 1 star for the staff, and 0.5 stars for the main. 0.5 stars for my +1's main (because it was good and it wasn't mine and I didn't get to eat all it). Four out of five."}
{"text":"Great food, Beautiful ambiance and Friendly staff - Now that's a recipe for a fantastic restaurant, and that's exactly what you should expect as you walk in the doors of Pattaya. 
It's so hard to find authentic Thai cuisine without trekking downtown, but no more, Pattaya has filled the gap. 

As we walked in we were greeted by friendly staff and we requested to be seated by the window (with beautifully draped curtains - perfect for a date night) and they accommodated with no hesitation. The interior was simple but elegant, and they pay a lot of attention to details (there were designated glass place holders on each table!!). 

Note worthy moment: We asked one of the staff to take a picture of us, as we were celebrating a b'day and he did. But he went a step further by asking if it's ok if he took a picture from outside the restaurant of both of us since we were seated by the window. Now that's customer service - Going over and beyond to satisfy customers!!! Two thumbs up! :)

With regards to food I'm going to give Pattaya 5 full stars! It's up to par with the Thai holy grails downtown. The squash fritters were so crispy and fresh with a delicious sauce, and the presentation was beautiful. For mains we ordered Holy Basil Chicken and Curry Pad Thai w/ Chicken and they were both perfection! I really wanted their Mango Sticky rice for dessert but we were stuffed by then. But I shall be back, so no worries! :)

All in all, Pattaya is definitely worth the trek to the East end if you're not from this end of the town. It is rather small for a restaurant, but they have optimized the space to seat as many as possible comfortably. Do give it a try!!"}
{"text":"Editing because almost every time I've eaten here it's amazing. I think one time we had food that was a little less perfect than normal, but it was still good. 
OG Review: 
So good, best Thai I've had in 10 yrs in Toronto. 
We've tried the curry, basil noodle with beef, fried rice, kids noodle dish, wonton, spring rolls, the fried squash fritters, and the mango sticky rice. That mango sticky rice is decadent. Even the takeout is presented nicely. We've enjoyed every dish!! Maybe the beef wasn't top quality, but everything else has been, and the beef was still better than most. The chicken is perfect in every dish. The spicy curry was phenomenal. 
It's very expensive, but I think you are definitely paying for quality and effort. The staff are also very nice, which these days is pretty refreshing!"}
{"text":"Sunday Brunches will never be the same after enjoying Coconut Soup and Mango Salad instead of Bennies; Sweet Potato Fritters instead of pancakes; Tofu Pad Thai lightly dressed in a proper Tamarind Sauce (no ketchup substitute) instead of Chicken Waffles for a most respectable $20 tax included. Tapas only works when loaded with flavour and Pattaya succeeds where other Thai kitchens fail."}
{"text":"We had a quick meal here, just as the place was opening. The service was great, the waiter was really easy going and helpful. 

We got the lemongrass soup and the classic pad Thai.

I thought the soup was ok but my girlfriend loved it, the vegetables really complimented the soup well and were not overcooked.

The pad thai was served inside of an omelet which we both thought was great (their classic pad thai) and the presentation was also really good, and I liked that there was so many different ways to garnish the pad thai (bean sprouts, crushed peanuts, red peppers, onions, pickled carrots and radish, and chives all separate from the pad thai) 

We got the vegetarian pad thai and I thought it was very good, not too artificial tasting like you get at cheaper thai places, and flavours similar to the pad thai at sukhothai. 

My favourite is still sukhothai but this is definitely a great option in the east end, plus there's lots of other stuff on their menu that I would like to try. So I will definitely be going  back there."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. It has great tasting food prepared with a real flair for drama. The service is quick and friendly. It is a small restaurant so definitely call ahead for seating."}
{"text":"Perfect place for a dinner date. It's a nicely decorated restaurant and feels really fancy. I thought the service was exceptional, the waiter came by a couple times asking if we needed anything which was awesome. We were given complimentary shrimp chips with dip, then our main dishes came pretty quickly, and it was amazing! The portions are good for the price. It tastes very authentic and of good quality. It is also extremely vegan friendly! All around great experience and I would definitely come again!"}
{"text":"First off, the food is really good. But I'm giving them just the one star because they do the worst practice in the restaurant industry - upcharging you on substitutes (ex: beef for chicken) without informing you. We were a party of six, three of which three did substitutes. We only found out at the final bill. The menu clearly says \"choice of\" but, in fine print elsewhere on the menu, there is a substitute charge. What made this whole thing worse is that management even acknowledged this, but still didn't change our bill. Terrible customer service considering we've been there many time. Could have retained a customer with a simple act, but their poor handling of this issue have lost them a customer for good."}
{"text":"I usually don't like to review places based on one visit as I find that all restaurants have good and bad days and our experience can vary tremendously and accordingly to so many factors. With that said, I thought that Pattaya deserved a review based on my one experience (of many more to come, I'm sure) because the place is that good and more people need to know about it. 

I visited the restaurant for lunch and arrived there just after 12.30pm on a Sunday. A group of six people arrived shortly after and that left the restaurant with six available spots. That's right, the place is tiny (sits 16 people), however everything is extremely well laid-out and you'll find the place to be both cozy and spacious. Like everything in the restaurant, it's clear that lots of attention has been placed on all details; from the beautiful marble tables, to the comfortable seats and passing through the J. A. Henckels cutlery. Everything here was well thought of and looks great. 

However none of the above would matter if the service and food weren't good... It was the outstanding quality of both that prompted me to take some time and write this review. 

The service was excellent, with both waiters that helped us being extremely polite and attentive. The food came fast, with only a small comment that I believe that when in two or more people, all dishes should be served at the same time. That wasn't the case with us but because all food made it to table within a few minutes I don't believe that it's a big deal. 

As for the food, what can I say? I believe that the Beaches has a couple of decent options but none has good as Pattaya. There's a clear attention to detail in how each ingredient complements the other. The ingredients are fresh, the presentation is amazing, but it's the taste that takes Pattaya to a whole different level. Somehow they managed to make me enjoy mango, which is something that up to this day I've always despised and couldn't even be close to it!  :D 

If you're from the Beaches, please take the time to visit and support this amazing little gem. If you're not from the neighbourhood, hop on the streetcar, drive your car, ride your bike, or walk to the restaurant. It'll be worth your time!"}
{"text":"Definitely had Yelp find us the best Thai Food in Toronto. We are never disappointed. I would say it was somewhat of a small and tight restaurant space but it worked for the guests and workers. It was prime time for a busy diner rush on a Saturday. My husband and I were okay sitting at the bar. We typically get the best service there anyways. The menu was smaller than I was use to but they had lots of dishes that would work for everyone even if you were a picky eater or it was your fist time having Thai Food. We went simple and ordered pork and chicken skewer with sticky rice, beef salad, and we had to order the green chicken curry soup that was served in a coconut. Need I say more. I think it was fantastic overall. Very happy to have tasted Thai food in Toronto!!"}
{"text":"An overall a very pleasant dining experience. The squash fritters were delicious! I ordered the pineapple fried rice but would not likely have it again. It was healthier than most fried rice dishes as it did not seem fried at all. The dish was quite bland and certainly not what I was expecting. Also, the onions (green and white) were too raw and pieces too large and plentiful for my liking. The pineapple fried rice should really be called \"onion wet rice\" as pineapple was not the main veg/fruit of the dish and it was well oiled but not fried. I would definitely come back for the fritters and try something else for my main entree."}
{"text":"Their food is excellent! Service is friendly and the restaurant itself has a charming and cosy feel to it. And they deliver!

I would recommend the Khao Soi!"}
{"text":"Great find! Shrimp crackers with peanut sauce for fantastic. Fried spring rolls were delicious. Curry Pad Thai with chicken was some of the best pad Thai I have ever had. You won't be disappointed here."}
{"text":"3.5
Cozy little Thai place with a very quite and good atmosphere inside.
We ordered:

Squash fritters: Very good and a large portion. Some parts were not crispy but thats okay. I am generally not the one to notice presentation of food, but the way squash fritters were arranged, it made sharing very easy(look at my photo).

Golden Curry:
Never had before but was pleasantly surprised by the flavour, we told them to make everything spicy and they honoured it with the curry. If I go again I'll definitely get this.

Pattaya Pad Thai:
Very lacking in taste and the only thing I didn't like about the restaurant. It was not spicy and tasted like sweet boiled noodles :(
Next time i am going to try Curry Pad thai and hope it would be flavourful.

Service was excellent, we were sitting on a small table and were running out of space frequently. Our server kept an eye on us and took empty dishes from the table, also filled our water couple of times."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night with Jen, close to where Queen Street East literally begins, which is away from the craziness of downtown.  Feeling the urge for some delicious Thai food we came across Pattaya Thai Kitchen.  
Upon entering the ambiance is romantic with hint of Thai and contemporary fixtures, I absolutely fell in love with this place because of how cute and quaint it is.
Our server was very friendly and attentive but also provided us some recommendations while we browsed the menu.
With the great selection of authentic dishes, we narrowed it down to the following:

Squash Fritters - beautiful presentation, fresh in-house made, very creative, served with a sweet sauce. I would recommend this. 
Coconut soup- Jen had and enjoyed this, the broth was flavorful.
Curry Pad Thai - Melody of flavors, portion and presentation bang on!
Panang Curry - can't say much, but based on Jen's feedback she liked this dish. 

I will be returning very soon!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. East end hidden gem, small, clean, unpretentious. Looking forward to coming back."}
{"text":"I was a little torn with this one. I am really on the fence of a 1 or 2 but I've decided to give them the edge on this one. A bonus! Why so harsh? or generous? Well, for one this is The Beaches. There's sunshine, sand, water and beauty everywhere but food isn't exactly what you would come here for. So expectations were low low but I had that glimmer of hope after reading these rave reviews from other Yelpers. Admittedly, I was gravely disappointed with the results but I am a generous man so I am going to give them that extra star.

It all started with an empty space, chic and spa like (I wouldn't second guess that this was probably a former spa LOL). The music is loungey and the space is cozy and inviting. Our server did his job; took the orders, brought our food, filled the cups and asked us how was the food at the end before thanking us.

As for the food..  It was certainly reminiscent of Thai food but the flavours are so muted even an infant may find this bland. I guess, they've toned it down a bit as to not to stir up too much excitement for the laid back beach goers - that may be a good thing. Prices are on par with other Thai establishments nearby but the portions are a little skimp for the most part. Except the unkind amount of chewy chewy protein you get with every dish (yeah, that's chewy twice! Two times the chewiness, double chewing!). In fact, there was just way too much chewing going on. Anything from the under-cook veggies to the grainy ginger pieces and somehow-perfect-cut-so-they-are-unavoidable pieces of lemongrass was choo-choo chewy! The curry was mundane and that's all that is needed to describe it. Pad thai was adequate but it felt a little like it was assembled on an assembly line rather than stir-fried - lacking that wok flavour if you know what I mean.

All in all, one of the most disappointing Thai meals in recent memory. Sigh!"}
{"text":"Small Thai place in East Queen. We ordered from lunch menu the price was very reasonable. From the side dishes We ordered lemongrass soup 5/5, fresh rolls 5/5, Shrimp chips 4/5, chicken satay skewers 5/5. We also ordered phat Thai the dish looked amazing but the taste was 3/5. Over all it was a good Thai food experience."}
{"text":"It's lovely to have such a great Thai restaurant in our neighborhood. 

There was 5 of us and we had a variety of items. The squash fritters are amazing. If you like peanuts you can not go wrong with the Penang curry. The presentation was beautiful and staff were very nice and attentive without being intrusive. 

We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"I was so happy to come across this restaurant! Its interior is small but very nicely decorated, the service was great too. Our waiter was super sweet and attentive. The food... was absolutely delicious.
I ordered a veggie pad thai, my fiancé ordered their basil eggplant, and my friend ordered another stir fry chicken dish, we all loved it! If you go during lunch time on the weekends, it comes with a spring roll, which was also very yummy.
I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I went here for dinner, food was very good and most of the options were standard for Thai restaurants. Taste wise the food was good, it was very authentic, and the portions were deceivingly big - probably due to the massive plate which are nice but are quite big for the small table. Service was good, though mind you it was quite empty when I went, and we were served shrimp chips as a starter which is always a plus (I really really like shrimp chips). Food-wise I would say it was quite standard Thai food  - good, but quite standard nonetheless - nothing to write home about. Basically if you want to go to a nice clean Thai restaurant with a bit of a modern decor and and a classier, quiet environment, Pattaya is a great option to consider."}
{"text":"This was one of the tastiest Thai food experiences I've had in the city, certainly the best in the Beaches area. This new restaurant is a humble size having formerly been a sandwich shop, but still makes good use of the space they have with clean lines and appropriate furnishings. Each item was plated with attention and care. Complimentary shrimp chips and a lovely peanut sauce were a nice start. I ordered the fresh rolls to start, they were, well, fresh haha (healthy and yummy) as well as the vegetarian delight for my entree, which came with a side of steamed rice. The flavouring of the sauce was light and yet absolutely delicious, so much so that I ordered a second steamed rice to soak every last morsel of sauce. One of my friends ordered their specialty, the Kao Soi. It looked and smelled divine and got a 2 thumbs up from my \"picky\" friend. Overall the ingredients were fresh and had the essential elements of authentic Thai flavour (catering slightly to the North American palette). The menu is simple and doesn't attempt to cover the exhaustive rainbow of \"pan Asian\" cuisine; a fact that I found to be refreshing especially given the many Thai places in town that fit into the \"Jack of all trades, master of none\" classification. Pattaya also included a large variety of Gluten Free and Vegan options throughout the menu so all our parties dietary needs were easily met. The service was probably the best of all. The owner, Alan was incredibly attentive and actually served us himself; you could just see the pride he took in his work. Although it is a bit far on the East end of town, I'll certainly be back to make my way through the menu. I'd recommend it to anyone in need of a Thai fix whether it be take-out or dine-in, its that tasty!"}
{"text":"I had the Khao Soi which was really tasty with lots of great fresh ingredients and the coconut soup which was also very tasty, my only slight problem was with the fresh rolls, now it wasn't the rolls themselves, they were very good and not full of cheap lettuce, it was the super sweet dip that they came with, just was not good with the fresh rolls at all. I had to find something more appropriate (peanut sauce would have been perfect) this could just be a personal preference of mine so don't let it deter you if you love well made fresh rolls because they were a lovely combination of ingredients."}
{"text":"Atmosphere: (4 stars)
Very nicely decorated place.  (-1 star) for the very small dinning room).
The washrooms are located in the basement but are clean.

Food: (5 stars)
The food is plated in very interesting way, you would expect it to be 3 times the price.
The portions are generous and the food is very tasty.  You can notice that it is made from fresh ingredients.

Service: (4.5 stars)
Super friendly and attentive.  We came on a hot summer day, and he kept refilling our water non stop.  
(-0.5 star) for not being able to explain how spicy a soup was and allowing us to order it while promising it will not be spicy."}
{"text":"Went here for my birthday and it was great.
The food is not just pretty to look at, but it is tasty too! The flavours are definitely up there with khao san road/sukho thai in terms of thai food... but they aren't in the downtown core!

The squash fritters were great, and definitely large enough to share.

I had the holy basil chicken, which I liked and was filling. And my wife had the khao soi which she said she might even like more than the one at sukho thai and that is saying a lot coming from here. I would definitely come back here, and have recommended it to others."}
{"text":"This pace is fantastic - our food was just perfect, came out pretty fast - presentation was fantastic, service was 5+ starts. They accommodated us with the stroller, very pleasant and helpful! This place is a hidden jewel and absolutely MUST TRY!!!

Cheers!"}
{"text":"We saw this place had good reviews and decided to try some takeout for dinner. After looking through their website (which is very nice btw), I called in to place the order (note that you can order online, too). They said it would be ready in 20 minutes.

I showed up 20 minutes later to find out they had accidentally given my order to someone else, so I had to wait for them to re-make it. They were friendly and apologetic throughout the whole process, but of course it was still a bit disappointing to have to wait another 15 minutes.

Once we got back home and had the food, though, it helped to amend my disgruntled-ness. Everything was very delicious and fresh. The chicken satay appetizer was especially good, and the Khao Soi was also tasty and well-spiced. I would recommend getting the Khao Soi with something other than shrimp, though - they were just a bit more obnoxious to eat due to needing to peel them.

Overall we enjoyed the food, despite some hiccups in the ordering process. I'd also say that the interior of the restaurant is lovely - so this would also be a nice place for a dinner in. Check it out if you're in the area."}
{"text":"For now I'm rating it as three because I've only tried one dish (take out) and hope some others will be better. I ordered the Red Curry with veggies & tofu and substituted the jasmine rice with coconut rice for an extra $2. From the reviews I expected a phenomenally seasoned, exceptional quality meal. Sadly, I found both the curry and rice on the bland side needing much more seasoning and intensity. The coconut rice was the mildest I've ever tasted. Pros of the dish were an abundance of fresh vegetables with lots of variety. There wasn't as much tofu as other restaurants but I wasn't bothered by the overall quantity.  I also had a mango salad which wasn't anything extraordinary, it was as expected although I did enjoy the addition of mint and cilantro. I'm willing to try a few other dishes before making a final verdict but overall I was a disappointed based on the reviews."}
{"text":"It is quite an experience from the moment you get in. Clean and simple lines for decoration make a great environment. My eyes were in for a treat as much as my palate. Dishes were stunning and incredibly flavourful. Coconut soup was unreal and the squash fritters, insane. I really recommend this place. Really."}
{"text":"This was a place very east in the beach I found with the highest rating on Yelp and thought we'd give it a try
We ordered way to much and it , wait for it,
blew our mind ! ! !

Lemongrass soup, Mango salad, peanut chicken satay, spicy basil noodles, green curry, spicy pineapple rice all fantastic!!!

Best Thai I've had in years my husband would not shut up about it but to be fair he was right
Amazing 
worth the short drive from Leslieville and worth a few more bucks to avoid greasy stale friendly thai 

We'll be back"}
{"text":"The pad thai: pretty good.

The lemongrass soup: Absolutely incredible!

This is the first time I've tried lemongrass soup, so I have no idea what it's supposed to taste like, but this was amazing. 

The soup was very flavourful and fragrant. If you don't like spicy things this might be too much for you, but trust me, it's worth it. It was the perfect heat for me, just enough for stimulation but not so much that it overpowers the other flavours. 

Highly recommend eating here!"}

The server was especially attentive to my little one, entertaining him and bringing him orange slices. My Penang Curry was delicious, as was my partner's Pad Thai. The squash fritters and fresh rolls were tasty, too. Highly recommended!"}
