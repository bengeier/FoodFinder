{"text":"A friend  recommended this new place to try. I got the famous PBJ burger,it wasn't what I expected  it to be it was just that PBJ sandwich  with meat I don't know what all the fuss  was about. Let's talk about the waiter  it took him 10 min. before  he evan asked what we would like to  drink  and even longer to ask about our order. I guess  since this location  was in Scottsdale  he thought it would be better to attend the older ladies that were there alone rather than a  family. The service  for me means a lot about a place, but the food was ok. I would not be going there again."}
{"text":"Was in the Scottsdale, AZ area and heard people raving about this place figured I had to stop by and check it out for myself.

First of all definitely not what I expected, to be honest I was expecting more of a \"Five Guys\" setup but to much pleasure it was a more intimate, personal and relaxed environment.. The surfboard outside kind of hints at the environment inside.

But wait I was in basketball shorts cross trainers and a tank top normally I wouldn't wear this to a sit down restaurant just personal preference but the very nice lady informed me they do take out as well. Perfect. I paid after settling with \"The Hangover Burger\" which sounded amazing. It was about $14 not the cheapest but I'm from CT and that's what I would expect to pay for a good burger. 

I waited outside in my car since she said it would be 15 minutes, called a friend and in 12 minutes she came out with my food without me asking. That was very sweet of her to do so. I drove back to the hotel go to my room then remember I didn't ask for any utensils or condiments! To my surprise though it was all there paper plate, utensils, napkins and even an assortment of condiments. Wow, I was pretty impressed with the customer service and I haven't even tried the burger yet. 

Since I know this review is getting lengthy let me just say the above and beyond customer service was not let down by the phenomenal food. Cooked a perfect medium as requested with some sweet potato tots I have never tried that were simply put, addicting.  

I will definitely be recommending this place to friends and those who love to get lost in different cities and try great food. Bravo Rehab Burger bravo."}
{"text":"Quality of food combined with amazing service makes this place a new family favorite. We were out and about exploring Scottsdale, i told my husband I was in the mood for a burger and so we ended up here. The food is amazing and we will be going back for sure!!! I really wish they had a location closer but we will make the drive for this place!!!"}
{"text":"I was very impressed, fast service, great food, friendly staff, unique menu.. The owner of this establishment should be very very proud. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"This place has a great location right in Old Scottsdale. Cool menu with lots of different options for burgers, salads, etc. Went with the porkster burger, which pretty much says everything. Burger with pulled pork. Delicious. 

Really enjoyed the sweet potato tots with the different sauces. Favorite sauce I think was the pineapple teriyaki.

Overall great place to come and get some delicious food in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"My friends and I came here and we were blown away by the service we received. We were seated instantly, our server was great. I ordered the pb&j burger, I was pleasantly surprised how amazing it was! We were impressed by how well the staff including the hostess becca handled the rush of customers coming in. When we were paying our tab, a customer yelled at the the hostess. She handled the situation so well, and even tho the situation might of upset her she smiled and whole heartedly thanked us for coming to rehab. We will definitely be back because of the service we received! Who ever owns this place needs to give Becca a raise or a pat on the back for being so great at her job!"}
{"text":"Decent burgers and adequate service. The burgers were ginormous so prepare to come with an appetite. Seems like a cool concept adding new flavors and making the burgers unique. I'm not a big burger fan but if you like burgers and are in the area, check this place out."}
{"text":"I have only been here once but that was enough to ensure that I never go back again.  The location and atmosphere were fine and a chirpy waitress provided hope of a good experience when she suggested the day's special of some kind of thinly sliced tri-tip burger.  The outcome however was disappointing as I bit in to my first mouthful of gloopy bits of meat with what I think were peppers, causing a river of grease to descend on to my plate.  The whole thing tasted of something soaked in oil and when I informed the waitress she simply smiled and replied with 'yea', as though I was simply stating the obvious and that was the intended result.

If you're normally a healthy eater and feel like treating yourself to a burger, you might as well buy one from a roadside burger truck and save the disappointment."}
{"text":"Service exceptional. Wait staff were nice. Food....on another level. I had the hawiann burger and even though I was so stuffed I HAD to finish it! Only thing is that it is tight spacing because it was so packed. They need to expand ASAP...but  Definitely coming again."}
{"text":"I've taken my Toyota's here for service ever since I became a Toyota customer 21 years ago. Rich Taylor has been my service advisor since he started working there, perhaps 15 years or more. I've never gotten anything less than profession, courteous, and friendly service, which is why I continue to return, year after year.."}
{"text":"Happy hour 7 days a week from 11-6
ToDays visit is for a rehab burger Saturday nights can be tuff in the desert"}
{"text":"I've been to Rehab (the restaurant!) several times since they opened and have left happy and full each time. The place is very cute and relaxed with a beach and surfing theme. Every server we've ever had was excellent and attentive.

I've tried a variety of items of the menu:

* Hawaiian Burger  - It was tasty, but the slab of Ham on the burger was a bit much for me. Personal preference thing.

* Veggie Noogie Sammy - I incorrectly thought this would be similar to Oregano's Veggie Wedgie. It is not, but that doesn't mean it isn't good. 

* Shelby's Shpinach Salad - This is my favorite with or without the grilled chicken breast on top. I love that you can get the mini size of this salad w/o chicken for only $5. It is a steal!

I've also tried the onion rings, french fries, and sweet potato tots. The tots are where it is at!

Most everything on the menu comes in two sizes - Rehab (small) and Relapse (huge). Even the small size is really big if you don't normally eat big portions. Be forewarned!"}
{"text":"One of the best burgers in the Phoenix area. I had never eaten a pretzel bun burger unitl I ate here - loved it!"}
{"text":"WOW! This place is awesome!!! First of all the selection of burgers will blow your mind - super creative for any palate...and gluten and lactose friendly which usually shy's me away from enjoying a burger. I had the turkey burger on a gluten free bun and it was mouth watering! Our sever was so fun and friendly contributing to the greatness of this place. We arrived just after the lunch rush and it was packed! You know they are doing something right! Next time we are in Old Town Scottsdale we will definitely be back!!!!"}
{"text":"Tried the PBJ Burger on a recommendation from our server and wow. It was amazing I will definitely be back when I am in Scottsdale next time. Also the sweet potato tots are great as well as their onion rings. I was impressed to see a lot of the locals there as well as visitors like myself. Great burgers and cold beer."}
{"text":"The turkey burger with bacon jam was out of this world!  And they make a mean pricky pear margarita!"}
{"text":"I was in the mood for a burger and thought I would give this place a try based on reviews and being in close proximity.
The atmosphere is good, but the hostess that seated me looked more like a customer and was busy talking to a friend.  I ordered the 5 oz Relapse Know Poblano Burger cooked medium wrapped in lettuce with the Sweet poToToes.  I was surprised how quick it came out and after my first bite, it was obviously undercooked.  Basically it was lightly browned on the outside and cold and raw in the middle.  I sent it back and it was replaced with no problem, but still more on the medium rare side than medium.  The sweet potato Tots were ok, but I think they could offer something of better quality.
I was not impressed enough to go back and prefer the burgers and fries at Red Robin over the Rehab Burger Therapy."}
{"text":"Rodrigo Da Vinci salad was amazing!  Be careful...very spicy!  Sweet poTOTs were as good as advertised.  Can't wait to come back to try something else on the menu!"}
{"text":"Awesome burger joint. Fresh, super tasty, bread is fresh and moist.  Try the pretzel bread!!  I has the PB&J (no sriracha, please) and it was deliciously unexpected. Although my hubby had to go with the Blue Cheese and Bacon with ingredients on top (vs the 10oz original which has all embedded in the beef), it was definitely rehab worthy. The sweet potato tots are a bit greasy but great. Thanks to the reviews we chose this place and it was well worth it.  Note, it was packed at 11:45am...it is a popular place and the wait could be long. The tables outside were open yet the heat was unbereable (this coming from an islander)."}
{"text":"Service was awful, order was wrong and we were forgotten by our server-will not be back as 3 shots your out will spend my money elsewhere"}
{"text":"Absolutely AMAZING!! We had Kens Bbq burger rehab size and we split it... Perfect portion fort splitting!!! And sweet potato fries... YUMMO!! Wonderful service by Jeff!!!"}
{"text":"Best burgers I've had in Phoenix! And a very very fair priced. This will be my burger spot every time I am in Scottsdale. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Been here once great service awesome vibe and the burgers OMG get in my mouth I definitely recommend but be prepared for a wait"}
{"text":"Great place for a meal.  Service wasn't bad, but not the best.  Food however is worth the trip!  Their burgers are very impressive! Order any of them and you won't be disappointed.  Fun atmosphere and lively.  Bring your appetite and be ready for something deliciously different!"}
{"text":"Excellent service and outstanding burgers! Try the PB&J burger with sweet potato tater tots. We'll be back, but probably not on a Sunday."}
{"text":"Really good burgers , like the kind when you take the first bite and say,\" Whoa- this is tasty!\" The service is also very peppy."}
{"text":"Well...it doesn't happen often but when it does its AWESOME! 5 stars easy! Killer burger, huge portions, sauces were amazing, and the entire staff was so fricken friendly dang! Arow you made my day 4sho! I had the Ghost Burger and it was phenomenal, with super delicious guacamole and just spicy enough to taste good!!!
Will be back if I'm in town!"}
{"text":"Yum!! So many burger choices but everyone at my table went with the spicy mac n cheese burger. So much food, most of us ended up taking some home but it was delicious. Also tried the onion rings which were super crunchy and delicious. Hope to stop by again before leaving AZ."}
{"text":"Have the bbq sauce I've ever tasted.. It should be bottled and sold.. Definitely will be back"}
{"text":"Good service. Always accommodate my being vegan. Love the roasted corn option instead of French fries. Although the sweet potato tots with the spicy ketchup are hard to beat."}
{"text":"Ghost burger is a MUST TRY! I ordered medium rare and came out just perfect, spicy grilled onions with the smooth avocado made an excellent combination. Friendly staff and great service, definitely will go back!"}
{"text":"The food was Awesome the staff was awesome; In fact just about every waitress and waiter stopped by our table to say hi and ask how the food was. We had the Hawaiian burger  and the Bacon cheese burger, fries and the sweet poToTos. all of their Aioli sauces served with the burgers and sides were really tasty. Did i mention how great the staff was? We gave it 12 stars and will be going back for more!!!!!! I recommend it to any one."}
{"text":"Ok so I maybe a little bit biased because when I came here it was for my post figure competition cheat meal and I was literally starving!! I was craving nothing but a really good burger and heard that the PB&J burger here was the BOMB.COM so I had to have it. I arrived with a large party and was told the wait would be 2 hours!!!! I was so mad but set on eating that burger! After the horrible wait (which was more than 2 hours btw) I got to sink my teeth into my meal!!! I also had the sweet potato tots! My husband ordered the Poblano Burger with onion rings and subbed the regular patty for a chorizo patty!!! The food seriously doesn't get any better than this! Although it really isn't for health nuts, the food tastes fresh/in house made/not crap that has been sitting in a freezer! My new fav burger stop!!!!"}
{"text":"The service was great, refills brought without asking.  First time, it was the perfect spot to eat while waiting for plane arrivals.  Much better to skip the parking and not be waiting in the cell phone lot.  The times after were meeting friends and enjoying the food.  Come for the food and try the outdoor patio that has plenty of misters to keep the temperature down."}
{"text":"We had fabulous sandwiches the service is great the Joe Montana was huge and the patty melt tasty. Will be back and send friends."}
{"text":"Astounding burgers. Never had anything like it anywhere else. We are from New York, and this was worth coming out to Arizona for."}
{"text":"I absolutely love the atmosphere. The service is great everyone is so friendly!  Calamari is amazing and enough for 6 people there is so much!  The Hawaiian burger amazing our server was Saira she is the best!!"}
{"text":"Good atmosphere good decoration BOMB.com Thats all I need to say ! GO! Ask for :Robin !"}
{"text":"We love this place! Incredible burgers and incredible atmosphere. The employees were really friendly and the service was prompt and everything was done well. Highly recommend in Old Town Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Great place. Amazing service. I just saw a waiter literally run after someone who left their food. 

This place has it dialed in. Xtra crispy bacon was delivered as asked, which normally is s risky bet. Great quality"}
{"text":"Great food and service. Nicely nested at the back of the Old Town, I guess you have to be in the know to find it! Try the pulled pork. Period. Turns boys to men."}
{"text":"Had the Alfredo San Carlo! Awesome pasta from a burger joint. Perfectly cooked and lots of cheese and alfredo sauce with garlic tomatoes and it ha a little spice to it as well! So great job guys! If the pasta is that good I can only imagine what the burgers taste like!"}
{"text":"I have never written a review in my life, but the service here was so bad enough that I got compelled to write a review to warn others. Our party of two arrived around 2 p.m. hoping to get a quick lunch, but what we received was quite the opposite, it took about 15 minutes after sitting to even get a server for drinks. We had been waiting so long that we went ahead and ordered our food as soon as we were able to flag down a server, 45 minutes later not the nearest sight of our food coming, to cut it short we didn't receive our food after more than 50 minutes of waiting, we had no choice but to leave at that point. Will not be returning here ever, or at least until they drastically improve their service."}
{"text":"If you get the PBJ Bacon burger, you will not regret it!!!!!! It also has sriracha, and I was hesitant to get it at first because it sounds absolutely gross, but you will be super surprised to discover how the flavors combine to create something amazing/incredible/mindblowing. I would have enjoyed just peanut butter on the burger, but the sriracha is a surprising balance to the sweetness of the grape jelly. I went with my family to Rehab Burger, and everybody else said my burger was better than theirs. I'm so happy I got it and I will be recommending it to everyone I know! I got it with a side of sweet potato tater tots, which by itself is enough for a second visit. The only thing I was disappointed with was the soggy onion rings but everything about the meal was worth it! I understand now why it was 45 minute wait."}
{"text":"Just tried this place for the first time and it was awesome. We had Rocco as our server and he was great; he made a lot of great recommendations and he was on top of everything. 

My buddy and I both had the BBQ burgers with sweet potato tots. Both of the burgers were cooked to perfection and with high quality beef. 

We wrapped it up with the \"pot brownie\" with Reese's peanut butter cups and I was literally speechless. This blows oregano's pizzookie out of the water. 

I definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"burger was good and fries were even better. quick service in a casual place. pretty busy during lunch time."}
{"text":"The Porkster Burger at Rehab Burger Therapy is a monstrous creation. Featuring a beef patty and a healthy serving of BBQ pulled pork that is then placed between a pretzel bun and topped with cheese. The pretzel bun is the perfect platform to savor the flavor of meat. Unfortunately, the burger I enjoyed was more of a pork sandwich than a burger, and the BBQ sauce was just a little bit too peppery (making me miss out on the all the flavors of the beef). The beef was very flavorful and the bun was perfectly moist and tender. If the BBQ and pork were toned down just a bit the burger would be in elite territory."}
{"text":"Super busy and had a wait (not much room to wait so you stand outside): burger was excellent, milk shake was awesome. Just a little too packed in to the place."}
{"text":"Burgers are great, better than Cold Beer & Cheeseburgers. However, our server Jen was short and curt, at one point asking us if we were OK with our beers, then three minutes later asking us if we wanted our check. When I said, \"No, we're probably gonna have another beer,\" she told me \"OK, no rush.\" Really? Because now I feel like I'm being rushed. No personality, whatsoever. I'll come back, just not with her as our server."}
{"text":"Overrated. I honestly don't understand why this place has such great reviews. I don't think it's that's great. Service is awesome thou and so is the ambience, but the food is nothing special."}
{"text":"Great burgers, good music and genuine people. It's really all one could really ask for. 

Support a local AZ eatery that's bomb as hell."}
{"text":"Came here based on reviews and it was worth it! If I could give this place 4.5, I would. The only thing that kept it from a 5 was the onion rings because the onions were too wide...not enough flavor. Love their sauces and tater tots! This place may be known for their burgers but the pork was fantastic....it'll get me back here for sure! Would most definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Every time we have tried to eat here there is at least a 45 min. wait, so we usually just go somewhere else as the location in old town permits just walking 5 mins in any direction to find 10 other places to eat. Finally decided to wait it out on Sunday and had a 45 minute wait, which is awkward as there isn't actually anywhere to wait....people just kinda stand around in the parking lot between cars. Anyways we get seated at the end of a community table and the food was good. Not amazing, but good. The last third of my burger ended up being too underdone for me so I didn't finish all of it. Service was okay. I'd eat here again, but I wouldn't wait for it again."}
{"text":"Good burgers, not great. Sweet potato tots are super sweet, like they have sugar added, so it makes for an odd paring with the burger - imo. Service was friendly and overall I wouldn't mind going back."}
{"text":"Little disappointed in service and food. Sat at the bar and was told by bartender she would be right back. She was and I ordered a beer. She came back five minutes later and took the guys order next to me and then took my order. Guy next to me got his fish tacos within five minutes. I waited fifteen to twenty for my burger. I understand a burger takes longer than a fish taco but it was obvious they forgot to grab my order when it was done because when I got it, although it tasted good, the burger was luke warm as were the fries. The real kicker is the entire time I waited for my burger I was never checked on. That in itself will cause me to think twice before eating here again."}
{"text":"Skip RnR and walk 10 feet for a better burger, service and atmosphere! Hangover burger is insane! Actor/Comedian Brian Posehn was walking in as we were leaving."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I shared the bacon cheeseburger... Delicious!! Thank god I don't live here otherwise I will be eating way too many burgers!"}
{"text":"Sooooo damn good!!!! One of the best burgers I have ever had! Wings were superb too!! Great laid back atmosphere."}
{"text":"THE BEST BURGER IN TOWN, in the state, in the country, IN THE WORLD!!!! The staff are awesome too! Great place to come. Cant wait to return :-)"}
{"text":"Wednesday lunch. 3 person party. Seated immediately @ noon. Waited on immediately. Drinks with the quickness. Atmosphere is chill. Has a Hawaii/So Cal beach vibe - like Islands but less corporate. 

Burgers are enourmous. Had the Jalapeno Popper Burger, medium rare and subbed in onion rings. Burger was alright. Had a charbroil-flavor overtone to it, which, unfortunately was the predominate flavor. Also, there's too much going on with this burger. Massive amount of guacamole, little fired pieces of jalapenos seated within the guac and well, you need a knife and fork to eat it. I never have a problem with the size of a burger - it's a beautiful thing. 

Going to try a more simple, straight-forward burger next time but if the overly-charbroiled flavor persists the second round, it'll be my last visit. I'm optimistic.

It's in line with Scottsdale Old Town pricing - $16 for a badass burger. Cheaper burgers are to be had, and for me, the next time will be less extravagant, which will obviously be better on the ole pocket book."}
{"text":"This place is over the top great :) The staff was some of the friendliest in AZ, and the food was amazing. For sure the Relapse burger was more than enough, can't even imagine the size of the Rehab. Love the option of not only picking a size, but also sub out the burger for turkey or chicken at no extra cost (which I forgot to do). And just a side note, this is a place that butters and toasts the buns, so if you don't want it too greasy ask for a bun right out of the bag. Decor is super fun. Would be a great place to take someone new to AZ. Happy hour every day until 6pm, can't beat that!"}
{"text":"Dig this place! Liked the decor. Loved the food. My wife and I both had the hangover burger with the brioche bun, friggin yuuuum! She had the sweet tots and I had onion rigs. My Mom came along and she had the pork wings. 
Service was on spot.
Wish we could have stayed and tried more on the menu. Definitely will be back next time in town."}
{"text":"OMG! What a find this fun, yummy place! Fantastic food and our waitress Nicole was awesome too !"}
{"text":"Exactly what the name says, perfect hangover food! I recommend the pretzel bun if you get the hangover burger-it will hold up with all that delicious, runny, yolk.  Great place to go for some hangover related day drinking in old town!"}
{"text":"We here with a friend that had been there a week before. The way he described it put me in the mind set I was about to eat a piece of meaty heaven and a cloud like bun. So we went on a Friday night around 6 pm. The place has a nice chill atmosphere. The wait staff is very nice. We started with an appetizer of Pig Wings, which are little ribs on the bone covered in a sweet and spicy peach and hablanero bbq sauce. They were mighty tasty but took at least 20 min to come out.  Like most places in phoenix, they had Four Peaks beers on tap. This is fine with me. So we had a few beers, the ordered our burgers.

I ordered there specialty burger, The Hangover: Fried egg, bacon and a split green chili on it on a pretzel bun. As a side I choose the sweet potato tots. The burger was cook perfect to my order, but lacked seasoning. Even with a green chili on it I didn't get the heat I was expecting.  The bacon was crispy and the egg was cooked nice. The pretzel bun was excellent. It wasn't a bad burger but it didn't have that wow factor I was looking for.  The side of sweet potato tots was great. They even give you a side spicy catsup. This was good, but with sweet potato tots you need to serve them with a maple, or sweet sauce. 

So overall I would go back to give this place a second chance. My friend had a BBQ burger that I want to try. So check the place out. It is worth it."}
{"text":"I've loved my food every time I've come here, I love the \"normal\" burgers but have also branched out and had the mac and cheese and pb&j burgers, love em all."}
{"text":"I really like the beach atmosphere and our server was nice, but my food was mediocre. My fries tasted like they were reheated (blah) and the burger was ok, but didn't wow me. I had a bacon cheeseburger and I would choose 5 guys bacon cheeseburger over this places any day. They have lots of specialty burgers there, those may be better then the \"average\" one I got but I don't think I will go back to try it. Also, no kids menu which I didn't like because I have a family."}
{"text":"I've been here about 6 times in the last year or so. They have blown me away each time with their food, service, and cool vibe. Had the bacon cheeseburger last night with the pretzel bun. It was delicious, juicy, and huge!  

A solid \"go to\" place every time I am in town. Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"I stopped by 2 days in a row for lunch not long ago. The bacon cheeseburger was more than perfect. One of the best burgers I ever had and the wings were superb. Very warming atmosphere."}
{"text":"What a great place! Our server, Rocco, was spot on~6 adults and 3 kids are hard to please, especially someone that has been in the service industry for over 18 years! ;) We will be back the next time we are in Scottsdale!

{"text":"This may just be the best burger in the city. The sauces are awesome! I come here as often as I can."}
{"text":"What an amazing find! The hubby and I were in the mood for burgers and brew and happened upon this little gem! If there were a way to give 10 stars, Rehab Burger Therapy would absolutely deserve it! 

The burgers were inventive and delicious (we tried the Jalepeno Popper and PBJ and Bacon burgers- trust us the PBJ is WAY more delicious than it sounds), the brews were icy cold, the service was phenomenal, the restrooms immaculate......we seriously could find no flaw with this place. You have to come check it out for yourselves, and need some Rehab from your newfound addiction to Rehab Burger Therapy!"}
{"text":"A good time was had by all. We had everything and split it and passed it around. Mushroom burger, pig wings? (Pig wings?) Great!  Tator tots really! Where else can you get tator tots. Mac & cheese, a blue cheese wedge, and a chili burger.
E erything was good and hot. We gave the server a run for her money - unintentionally but my group was needy.... so sorry for the trouble."}
{"text":"Burgers, etc.  Sounds like run of the mill?  Definitely not.  Creative menu makes eating here a true pleasure.  Burger on pretzel roll is my husband's fave, mine in the Di Vinci salad which is more like a casserole!  Delicious onion rings, too!  Funky music and decor, as well as GREAT service with smile, round out your night!  Open late, makes it a convenient stop for apres anything!  Make sure you share a home made brownie for dessert.  We met owner's mother while she was delivering a huge pan to the kitchen!  Delicious!  Real food, real people."}
{"text":"Excellent burger place! I was stopping by after a baseball game on my own and sat at the bar. The bar staff was very friendly and gave great food recommendations. I had the PB&J and Sriracha burger and it was delicious. The PB acts like a cheese and the texture was really good. As a bonus, fries dipped in the jelly is a great combo. I will be back here again soon!"}
{"text":"Found this place off a living social deal months ago and absolutely fell in love with this place!! I'm surprised it has taken me this long to review.

I am addicted (no pun intended) to Rehab; think I've literally been there 3 times in a two week period. I have never had a bad experience or have had anyone I brought complain about their experience. The customer service is phenomenal. The servers and bartenders are awesome and give great recommendations. The regulars at the bar there are super friendly with great advice on what to order.

The food, phenomenal!! The burgers are huge and you get great portion sizes. You can substitute anything with no hassles! Their sweet tots, out of this world! And their sauces, absolutely amazing (pineapple aioli is my fave). 

Definitely a must try for anyone living here or just passing through!!"}
{"text":"After walking around Old Town Scottsdale, we decided on Rehab and didn't regret our choice at all. The menu of burgers is very creative. Who's ever heard of a PBJ burger? My son was curious, then went with the 10 oz. jalapeño popper burger & fries. Burger was huge & fries were crisp. My husband went with smaller Patty Melt & onion rings. Both were very good. I had the chili burger with no bun & the sweet poTOToes with chipotle aioli. The chili was very meaty & had the right amount of beans. I would have liked it with a touch more heat, but it was still tasty. The sweet potato tater tots were quite crisp & good with the aioli.
The atmosphere is definitely bar-like, but I wouldn't have a problem taking young children there. While not haute cuisine, Rehab serves good burgers and a good selection of beer. The rest of the menu looked good as well. I would recommend it to someone looking for burgers in the area."}
{"text":"Waking up with a hangover from the night drinking before, my friend and I scoured Yelp to try and find some food that would catch our eye.  Upon seeing a highly rated burger joint with 'Rehab' in the name, we knew it was meant to be so off we went.  

I wasn't sure what to expect but on first glance it seemed like a restaurant I'd find on the beach, with colorful decor and reggae playing throughout.  Our waitress (and hostess) immediately greeted us with a smile and asked where we wanted to sit, and being how perfect it was outside, we chose the patio.  

The first thing that caught my eye was cheap beer for happy hour.  $2 domestic and $3 imports had me rethinking my hangover from the night before but I stuck with a soda instead.  Next thing was to peruse the menu.  Based off recommendations on here, I knew I HAD to try the Sweet PoTOToes with whatever I got (I love me some sweet potato fries whenever possible) so that was one less thing to worry about.  I ended up going with the Porkster burger (BBQ pork on top of a 5oz burger) and it was EXACTLY what I needed.  I ordered Chipotle Aioli with the poTOToes and, as always, that is a killer combination.  The meal was the perfect cure and it helped that the service was top-notch.  The waitress had a smile, joked and seemed to know the right things to say and was speedy as can be.

I can't wait to go back and give it a go again, as they have won a customer for life!"}
{"text":"Awesome place! We classified it as a grand slam: 1st base - good location, 2nd base - quick, 3rd base - very good service, and great tasting food to send it out of the park. Should I say any more?"}
{"text":"Great environment, had the most friendly waitress, and the PBJ & Bacon burger tasted outstanding! I would recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Most of the time I rave about this place, but my last visit was dissapointing. The patty melt we ordered was over cooked and under seasoned. Their milkshake also tasted like McDonald's soft serve.  If this was my first visit, I'd never come back."}
{"text":"I have visited Rehab Burger Therapy several times.  Every time I have been there, I have been greeted promptly and with a smile.  The atmosphere is so relaxing! The music is so laid back with Bob Marley, Sublime, etc.  The service spot on and friendly!  The servers have always been great with their recommendations  The burgers are innovative and oh so tasty and juicy.  The onion rings are to die for and the sweet potato tots are a must!  I took my brother and his two year old daughter today and the server couldn't be more attentive and super sweet.  My only recommendation would be to offer a couple of options for kids meals, but other than that...  Try the Hangover Burger or the Peanut Butter and Bacon Cheese Burger on Pretzel Buns!  Yes, I said it!  Delicious!!! Top Notch"}
{"text":"Wow. Excellent service, friendly, easy to talk to, and make you feel extremely welcome at their place! Food is wonderful, be sure to get the sweet poTOToes!! Don't expect to get in and out in a reasonable time though, this place is about relaxing and enjoying your time. This is my kind of therapy!"}
{"text":"I have been looking in to this place for quite some time and finally got the opportunity to go it was by far the best burger I had in a long time from start to finish we felt very welcomed our  server Robyn took very good care of us and was very friendly to my son everything was served in a timely manner we actually got to enjoy our food and we where not ruched to leave like other places some of the burgers brought out where OUT OF THIS WORLD lol I'm definitely going back and I am recommending this place to all my fault and friends"}
{"text":"My son wanted to eat at Rehab and I wasn't thrilled about going to another burger place.  I LOVED this place.  The food was amazing.  I had a poblano burger at our waiter's suggestion and didn't regret it for a second.  The sweet potato tots that my son had were awesome but those onion rings were unreal.  We watched some football while we ate which was a bonus.  Everyone that worked there was really friendly and very fast.  Our waiter brought out aioli for me without me asking because he said he thought I might like it and then brought me a lid in case I wanted to take some home with me for my left-overs.  Amazing!  It was great service and it was obvious that the people there loved their jobs.  We will definitely be going back there and I will be bringing friends."}
{"text":"Lovee this place! The mcgnarly burger is a tie for best burger in Scottsdale. The sweet potato tots here are amazing and it's a really place with great music and dos equis on draft."}
{"text":"Wow!! The food here is amazing! Extra big helpings and they will customize your order. Laid back atmosphere. We are outside. Be prepared to take food home! Chips and salsa and the sweet potatoes tots are a must! Every burger imaginable is there. Chicken turkey ham and veggie sandwiches options too"}
{"text":"Two words: PINEAPPLE AIOLI. Also, my burger, the pulled pork burger, was DELICIOUS.

Our waiter was super friendly and attentive, atmosphere fun, casual yet still clean (read: no dive bar here!), and total bonus points for offering gluten-free buns.


Came with 3 co-workers, in town for work, but would come back again an surely recommend to people looking for a different twist on some junk food treats!"}
{"text":"The service was great. Our server Caylee was very pleasant and really knew the menu well. You could really tell she loved her workplace.

The food was fantastic. All 3 of my friends were really happy with their food also. I will definitely be coming back soon.

Best burger ive had in a long time!"}
{"text":"WOW!!! I never desired nor tasted a peanut butter and jelly burger, but it was the most wonderful experience I've ever had. Was last there two weeks ago. Been craving it every since. Going back this Friday. A MUST HAVE."}
{"text":"Sat outside tonight. We were seated quickly but it took awhile to get our drinks. We got guacamole on the special menu for cinco De mayo and it was excellent. I had the bacon cheeseburger with a pretzel bun. The chipotle ranch tasted great with the fries. My sister had the portobello  burger with sweet potato tots and loved it! The food and atmosphere were great. Service was slow but still a solid 4 stars!"}
{"text":"LOVED it!!! Had the medium gold medal wings and they were perfect! Our BBQ burgers AMAZING!!! Can't wait to go back loved it"}
{"text":"Had the PBJ and bacon burger with a touch of sriracha. It was amazing. Messy and tasty! A local place by me has a similar burger (I'm from out of town), but they don't add jelly or sriracha so when I go home, I'll suggest it for my burger. Also had the tots and they were savory and tasty. Sat outside which for us Michiganders is always a treat. It was busy and we were there for lunch. To be expected! Drinks were always filled."}
{"text":"We went here to try something different and we love it!!  The food was fantastic but our server was a little slow.  She kept on forgetting to refill our drinks when we ask, but it was also busy, so I am not to upset about it.  This atmosphere is really fun and laid back.  The decor is fun also.  My kids are already asking when can we go back."}
{"text":"Hamburger buoni, ma eccessivamente grandini ed elaborati. C'è cmq la possibilità di farselo fare solo con gli ingredienti che si desidera ed è l'unica soluzione se non si vuole un panino con 100 cose e super piccante.
Il servizio non è eccellente"}
{"text":"We decided to give Rehab Burger a try when my sister told me that this place has the best burgers we would find in the Phoenix area. We luckily got the last table, and didn't have to wait on a Monday night. I couldn't imagine how busy this place gets on the weekends. I enjoyed the atmosphere. It felt like it was a little burger shack in California. I liked how diverse the burgers were. I decided to get the PBJ bacon burger. I'm a huge fan of sriracha, so I was sold when I found out that it came on it. I got the sweet potato tots for the side. To be honest I was a little disappointed. Don't get me wrong it was a very unique, and good burger. Unfortunately, it was just that.. a good burger. The sweet potato tots were fantastic though. But for how well known they are I expected a little more bang for my buck."}
{"text":"Had a fantastic time at this place. The service was great and very friendly people. The burger, sweet potato tater tots and brownie dessert was bomb dot com. 

I have recommended this place to family and friends already."}
{"text":"This is the place to get the best burgers in Old Town. Great location, well staffed, and awesome food. Never had a bad thing come out to our table from here. Will be coming back for as long as they keep their doors open. Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"Burgers are great, relaxed and casual environment and great service. Kaye our server was terrific! Great place for a burger and fries!  Also the Portabello burger really hit the spot."}
{"text":"Great burgers and great atmosphere...even better service. Nick our server was amazing and made our dinning  experience extraordinary...try the pig wings (on recommendation from Nick) the burger was huge and tasty especially with the pretzel bun...overall great experience. It sucked that we had to leave the next day back home to El Paso, Texas..."}
{"text":"Just visited again and had the burger with the peanut butter and jelly!  WTH,  it was unlike any burger I've ever had and is now my newest favorite!  Freaken amazing!"}
{"text":"Yummy burgers, fries & huge onion rings. Fun beach type decor. Glad to have found them on Yelp!"}
{"text":"Super fantastic food. A must stop in Scottsdale.  Love the turkey burger and sweet potato tots!!!"}
{"text":"Rehab burgers are the best in Phoenix,  period. Nice, casual atmosphere.  We love this place."}
{"text":"Very good place for a burger. Laid back and friendly yet professional and quick even when they were busy. 
Only reason not 5 stars is they plated burger wrong and my rare went to someone else at table and I got stuck with medium.  We were under a time crunch so left it as it was delivered. Still all four of us enjoyed everything we got."}
{"text":"First of all, the restaurant's A/C wasn't working properly since it was quite warm (even muggy.) The server welcomed us briefly and took our order a few minutes later. We waited for over 15 mins until we had to ask another server to bring our drinks and she apologized for her fellow server's mishap. While all of this was taking place we noticed our original server was having a laugh (flirting) with a fellow coworker.

The burgers weren't that good but the fries were very good, though. A tip, order the small version of the burger of your choosing since it's actually quite big. I wouldn't imagine having the large sized burger, unless I haven't eaten for a day or two.

Maybe I had bad luck with my server and the joint's temperature control, but who knows it could be business as usual at RBT. Will not be back in a while."}
{"text":"Got the hatch chili burger on a pretzel bun. SO GOOD. It's all about their pretzel buns for sure."}
{"text":"Top 10 best burger joint in town. The place is a bit small thus waiting is more likely to happen. Good location and good customer service. The burgers are awesome and the tater tots are out of this world. I took away a star because of the heavy smell that was in the restaurant last 2 visits...(sorry). Still a big fan"}
{"text":"Be prepared to be in pain - food was good - services was good, we were in and out on a game day in a very timely manner. But my oh my,  even the small portioned burger is huge - couldn't finish even half of it. We'll split one when we go back!"}
{"text":"I heard this place had some unique burgers, and do they ever.  I tried the peanut butter, jelly and bacon burger; I know it sounds weird.  I've only heard of burgers like this on Dinners, Drive-in and Dives.  Let me tell you it was one of the best burgers I have ever had.  The service was great and the decor is laid back.  It is a small place so get there early.  If you are in Old Town Scottsdale, this is the place to go for burgers.  You can also get any of their burgers changed to a chicken or turkey burger at No Extra charge.  Now that's awesome!"}
{"text":"Just.....Amazing.....Big Double D-s in your face good. PB-J Sriracha burger is unreal. The taste of meat is on point, the buns are on point, good beers and vibe, unique burgers and sauces. Good waitstaff as well."}
{"text":"Delicious burgers and fries and onion rings with attentive service. You can order (and then actually receive) a rare burger, which is much appreciated! I would be happy to go again."}
{"text":"Burgers and portions were delicious. I had the bbq backyard burger in the small size and it was more than enough. Corona Rita's were also a favourite. Only let down was paying at the end. We wanted to split bills and in doing so they spilt the bills entirely wrong. Mild inconvenience, not enough to overwhelm how good the burgers are."}
{"text":"We visited this place for the first time on our honeymoon and when you walk in, you instantly feel like you are at the beach. Once we were seated, it was hard trying to decide what to order. We ordered pineapple bbq wings, BYOB burger, Jalepeno Popper burger, and had sweet potato fries with all the dipping sauces. The food was amazing but our waitress was awful! 15 mins before we got our check once we finished eating and it was not that busy mid day. I had to ask for Coke twice, my burger was cooked wrong, and she rarely checked on us. Go for the food not the service"}
{"text":"Spicy Mac n cheese burger was the BEST ever. I chose the veggie patty option, and it still turned out to be super yummy!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is fun and the service is as well.  I had the calamari which is very different but great!.. I also love the wedge salad.  This place is a winner, I will be back."}
{"text":"l love this place, it makes you feel like you are at home!! devin, ryan, cheryl are amazing!!! the food is ridiculously mouth watering amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Great burgers,good service and friendly staff.  Went with coworkers. I  had the jalapeño burger minus the cream cheese,it came with cheddar and cream cheese cheddar was enough. Delicious! .  My coworker asked for a recommendation between the PBJ and bacon buyer and the Pineapple burger.  Hands down the recommendation was the PBJ and  bacon. Both of my coworkers had the PB&J and bacon. Both said it was amazing. In fact one was going to make it that weekend with family at home. I highly recommend Burger rehab if you're looking for a great burger"}
{"text":"Simply put - A GREAT PLACE. The hardest decision is what to order. My fav's are the burgers, wings, sweet potato tots with pineapple aoli and the cobb salad. Great owners and staff. Don't miss Happy Hour. There's parking along side, across the street and in the parking ramp behind.
:-)Greg"}
{"text":"Great food, great server.. Couldn't believe she's a Grandma.  We were a party of 9, and she steered us in the right direction. 

Apps and Food were great.  Would come back again."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers I've ever had.  
I'm not typically a burger fan, but on whim I decided to try this joint out.
I was not disappointed!  Atmosphere was a big... busy, but the burgers are to blame!"}
{"text":"I have been to the Rehab in Scottsdale and found myself in Tempe so I was more than happy to be able to get my fix. I love the Mac Gnarly burger.  The burger proportions are huge, and by huge I mean split with the family huge.  I am no small eater and can maybe get through 3/4 of the relapse size.  The chili con fritos are also excellent and brings me back to my Texas days.
The service is good and the wait staff provides great recommendations. The noise level is a little loud but you can still have a conversation.  But the taste and food quality is what sets this place apart.  I would say it is one of the best burgers I have had."}
{"text":"Great burgers and tots! Cool atmosphere which can fill up quickly. But the employees are great and helpful and generally cheerful. Cant wait to go back!"}
{"text":"The burgers were phenomenal as were the sweet potato tots. The beer selection was lacking a little, hence the lack of a fifth star. I can go to a ton of burger joints anywhere, the beer and atmosphere need to earn my fifth star."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch. Had the veggie burger and was excellent really hit the spot. They have good drinks here including thirst quenching soft drinks. Love their pineapple sauce. They  have many different sources to choose from."}
{"text":"Great burgers great prices and wouldn't mind com by here again next weekend highly recommend"}
{"text":"I was there last night with a group of 5 other ladies.  The burgers were very good and cooked just the way we asked BUT several of the orders were not done right.  I asked for lettuce, tomato and raw onion with my burger and got sautéed onions with no lettuce or tomato and then I was charged for those onions.  Another of our diners did not get the avocado on her build your own burger and had an extremely long wait for her drink.  A third diner received her French fries ice cold.  She did get some that were nice and hot but that took over 15 minutes to receive.  I'm not sure what was going on last night that contributed to so many errors being made.  I hope they get their act together because I would like to give them a second chance."}
{"text":"Heard a lot about Rehab burger Therapy and was dying to try it out. Maybe my expectation was too high, but I was not very impressed with this place. Had to wait for a long time, which is acceptable taking into consideration that it was a weekend. Ambience was nice, beachy type. Definitely a fun place to hang out - 4 star for that. Staff was polite and friendly - 4 star. Very few servers, and I found that our server was attending to almost all the tables, which made the service super slow (the forks/knives took about 15 mins to come to the table, the napkins took another 15 mins, the check took around 20-30 mins) - 2 star. Menu had quite a lot of options including vegan - 3.5 star for that. But the vegan patty comes only in 10 oz size, which is HUGE - 2 star for that. Food was ok, nothing extraordinary (I was bummed because I have heard so much about how great their burger was). I have had much better burgers - 2 star for that."}
{"text":"Props for the menu ideas but the burger flavor itself seemed average. The sweet potato tots moved this place from 3 stars to 4 stars in our books."}
{"text":"Great Burger!  I had the Hangover burger with the pretzel bun. Ordered medium. It was great!  I left full and satisfied."}
{"text":"Food was awesome and the outside seating was comfortable and cool on a hot afternoon. If you love the band sublime then the music will take you back. The esthetic is very long beach California so it made me think of where I grew up. It is a little piece of the beach in downtown scottsdale."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, you just feel cool when you're there. Must get the PB&J, bacon burger on pretzel bun. BEST BURGER EVER! just go for it."}
{"text":"The service at burger rehab is very good. I ordered a mac and cheese veggie burger (I am vegetarian) and I loved it the decorations were great and is was a good time with the family at rehab burger therapy"}
{"text":"Very very good food. I had the PB&J burger and it was cooked great and tasted delicious. Sweet potato tots were perfect. 4 stars because the service was kind of slow, granted they were pretty busy, but still not an excuse for empty drinks."}
{"text":"I had the Backyard BBQ burger. It was worth the wait. My dinning partner had the porkster, subbing chicken breast (at no charge) for the beef patty. It was d'lish.  I had the 10oz rehab this time but going forward I'll take the 5oz relapse from here on out. Bottom line Rehab Burger Therapy deserves its rating."}
{"text":"good poblano chili burger, very friendly service by every one who looked at you. owner was on premise, cool scene. just around for a visit would recommend to anyone with a burger jones."}
{"text":"Fogo's De Chao in Scottsdale is a great place to dine if you are a meal lover!  They serve varieties of beef, chicken, pork, leg of lamb, lamb chops, prime rib, filet, sausage, ribs and an extensive salad bar!  Dinner meals are $50 which includes the salad bar.  They also serve one fish entry if someone in your party prefers it.  Wine bottles start at plus $40.  The service is great, food in delicious and restrooms are very clean.  Do make reservations because they are busy on weekends. If you are celebrating a special occasion, do mention it during your reservation.  There is a surprise for the Birthday person that you can share. Can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Really surprised by the appearance to find good quality food and gluten-free options! Most of the sauces and dressings and the fries are gluten-free and they offer gluten-free buns!"}
{"text":"Craving a huge, juicy burger cooked perfectly? Rehab is the place. Went here for my birthday and a month later was here again for my husband's. Fries are outstanding and lots of bun options including gluten free and lettuce wraps. If you arrive during dinner rush, be prepared to wait. Grab a drink, take a look at the menu and wait with anticipation. Service was friendly. This place won't let you down."}
{"text":"As per other reviewers and my servers recommendation, I tried the PB & J burger with sweet potato tots. I did enjoy the burger. I thought it might be too sweet but it wasn't and had a nice little heat. I guess I'm not a tot fan but I didn't really like them. Next time I think I'd get the corn as a side. Other people around me had it and it looked good. I felt it was way too much food for me.  It was one of those meals that started out great but by close to the end of it I was getting a little sick of it. Maybe I would go for the smaller burger next time.  Service was friendly and prompt.  Overall Good experience. I would recommend this place and would return."}
{"text":"They got it right!  This burger joint would fit in with the many Gulf Coast towns and cities in Texas.   

Felt like I was back home on the Third Coast kicking back with a burger, beer, and good company jamming to reggae on the sound system.   

Bugers were stellar, both the vegan and the Hatch Chile burger.  I grew up 30 miles north of Hatch NM and can say they did it right.  

The Red Stripe beer was fresh!!!  Something you don't see on a regular basis here in AZ

The real surprise was the sweet potato tots!  Usually not a fan of them, but their version just made me a convert!!!

The only thing lacking was the beach, so, barring California sliding into the Pacific,  it is something I will just have to deal with."}
{"text":"Awesome!  You can tell they really thought about the different burger combinations and dressings.  The sweet potato tots were awesome!  Our server recommended the pineapple aioli with the tots and it was delicious.  I had the Poblano burger.  Great flavors and just the right amount of spiciness!  The restaurant looks like a beach side bar.  the service was great and our server was full of great suggestions and was very polite.  They have options for people that don't eat red meat or need a vegetarian option.   I am definitely going back to try the other burgers!"}
{"text":"My burger wasnt cooked the way I ordered it however they made me another one on the house. I loved the burger and I am definitly going back!"}
{"text":"A must-go anytime you're swinging through Phoenix. Funky and fun burger combinations and bartenders that will shoot the shit with you all day long.

No matter what burger you order, make sure to get the sweet potato tots with chipotle aoli and pot brownies (brownie/peanut butter cups made in a cash iron pot with peanut butter and marshmallow). KILLER."}
{"text":"Great service and food, highly recommended.  Located in scottsdale.  Has large portions good burgers."}
{"text":"My friend recommended this place! Bartender was great! The Mac and cheese and burger was great! Sweet potato tots were amazing! Have to check this place out!!!"}
{"text":"Service is absolutely terrible. My husband and I frequent restaurants and lounges and cafes pretty often and have had our share of unpleasant experiences. We were excited to have burgers after a spring training game, but our waiter didn't look like he cared whatsoever. He did not bring the correct order, misguided us about the happy hour drinks and my burger was not well done as I requested it to be. When i tried to tell him about it, he WALKED AWAY.  Manager came and started making excuses for the waiter. In the end he took our bill and gave us a 10% discount, which would not even start to make up for a terrible experince that we ended up having. Honestly, i would consider this to be one of the worst restaurant experiences of my life. We won't be coming back and i would not recommend anyone to visit rehab burger."}
{"text":"Ok, I don't review often, only either very bad or very good.  I'm sorry, I wanted to like this place, very cool vibe but lets get down to the heart of the matter.  They make burgers.  If you don't care about the quality of the burger and are easily distracted by add ons like poblano peppers, chili, mac and cheese and the like than this may be for you.  For a burger purist...um... no.  This is the second time I gave them a try, I order my double relapse burger medium rare so as to have a little juice and flavor....denied!!  I don't know how they get a burger to be pink inside with absolutely no juice left whatsoever!  I'm serious, I am eating a tasteless dry ass pink burger.  I show my GF as I squeeze the burger on the plate with a fork and.......nothing.  Not a bit of juice, no frigging flavor whatsoever.  This tasteless burger is hiding behind all the bells and whistles of the toppings. If you have to go, just trust me and try a piece of the meat without all the crap and sauce.  Bland, bland, bland.  As for the sides, not terrible, but the gf tater tots came out cold and soggy.  They were replaced with hot ones on request, but really!!!  For $40 plus for a beer, hamburgers and frys for 2, you would think it would be hot and fresh the first time everytime.  If you are looking for cool place to chill have a beer and drop $40-50 bucks on very average burgers, then come on in. Otherwise, check out Cold Beer and Cheesburgers, Smashburger, Habit or any one of a dozen places where you won't feel like you just got hozed and a burger comes out like god intended, pink and juicy."}
{"text":"With friends visiting, we don't usually try new places, but take visitors to our old favorites, but being that we are all new parents, out to lunch with the babies, some of the usual Old Town hangouts were off the list. We walked up, and there were quite a few other families inside, so decided to give it a try. The staff was incredible.  The 2 hosts were above and beyond. Having babies with you comes with a lot of accessories...diaper bags, stroller, shopping bags, and the crazy kids! They were unscathed by all of it, and helped us out. The hosts went out of the way for us, and made our whole experience terrific. They were attentive, made small talk, and played with the babies. 

The food was good.  The Bloody Mary's need some work. But the overall experience was above & beyond for us. Would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Another great find in Arizona! We will certainly come back when in the area. Informal beach/surfer theme but great food/fun. Bring a huge appetite or share

Like:
Four Peaks Pumpkin Porter!
Spinach Salad!
Pesto Spaccini!

Wish:
I had ordered the dressing on the side
They had crushed red pepper"}
{"text":"Drove 45miles for a big disappointment. After so much hype around the web about their burgers we decided to try it. It wasn't close to what we were expecting! The burgers looked poorly constructed and didn't fit the pictures online, not to mention it took them 32minutes to serve us our food, and we went on a Sunday so there wasn't much of a crowd. The taste of the burger was 3/5 the fries and tots 1/5 the customer service was 4/5 except the wait time was horrible and gets 0/5 definitely will not be returning sorry!"}
{"text":"Excellent burger and service. Sweet potato fries with special dipping sauce were awesome. Denise, the owner, was very welcoming and intimately involved in the business which unfortunately is very atypical these days and seeing this was refreshing."}
{"text":"The wife and I had dinner here tonight. The food is five star all the way.  The burgers were big, juicy, and cooked perfectly. Sides were done well. Beer Battered Onion Rings are awesome.  The only reason I take away a star is because it is a small space with horrible acoustics. This caused an almost unbearable amount of noise. However, they do have a patio area which I am sure solves this problem when the weather is nice."}
{"text":"Just ate at the Tempe location for the first time. The food was killer, the ambience was chill, and the service was top notch.  Our server Dominic was excellent...his recommendations were on point and he was super attentive.  We brought our 2 year old daughter, and although they didn't have a kid's menu, Dominic suggested several menu items that would be appropriate for a toddler. The portions are huge...some people in our party ordered the 10oz burger when the 5oz burger would have sufficed. Other than being too full, we have no complaints.  We will most definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great food - we tried a few apps. Loved the chili cheese fries and the spicy mac and cheese. Onion rings were just okay - a bit too much breading. Great burgers - mostly cooked to specifications (maybe a little closer to medium than medium rare).  The menu is large and difficult to choose which burger you want. I like the multiple bun options. Service was attentive."}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME!! First time here, atmosphere is great, lively m7sic and great staff. I got the Hatch Chili Cheeseburger, with onion rings and the Maui Coconut Porter. The burger came out perfect, well seasoned and the hatch chili very tasty. The onion rings were to die for. The wife got the Mac Narley on the pretzel bun with sweet potato tots..... all awesome. All in all, we just found a new joint when we come to Phoenix."}
{"text":"Expensive but good on the overall. Environment, seating, some crazy people were there but yet it's a college area, we had fun."}
{"text":"I've been to the location in Scottsdale and finally made it out to the Tempe location off Mill Ave. This is absolutely my all time favorite burger place. From the fries and sweet po\"TOT\"oes to the BLT's and AMAZING burgers, great beer selection, plus the extremely friendly staff at both locations...this place is the #1 burger spot. I still cannot believe my favorite burger that I now always order is the PB&J Bacon burger...yes, I thought it would have been gross...now I can't NOT order it! Try it!"}
{"text":"We went to Scottsdale for a visit and chose this bar for lunch. I ordered a BBQ burger with grilled corn (medium) and my husband ordered one with onion rings. We checked in and had chips and salsa as well. My burger was super delicious. But I was a bit surprised by the size of onion rings here. Overall we were satisfied and this place worth a visit:"}
{"text":"good food, good service, good vibe great place to eat at before a night in old town."}
{"text":"Love this place!   Laid back vibe, lots of options on different burgers & sauces, and great happy hour that starts at 11 AM on Fridays!   I love that they have an option of sweet potato tater tots as a side......try them with the Pineapple Teriyaki sauce!  So good!"}
{"text":"Great vibe, pleasantly surprised by how busy it was. Robyn was our server and although she was busy, she hustled hard to take care of us. Hostess did a great job getting us watered before our server came over. Mushroom Swiss Burger with sweet potato tots was awesome.  Great Happy Hour specials, Thursdays all day HH.  Patron bucket is one of the best deals in town if you like Patron.  Bucket of ice comes with 4 Coronitas (the little ones) and a bottle w/ 4 shots of Patron for $28.  I don't know anywhere else you can get four Patron shots for that cheap, plus the added bonus of the Coronitas.  Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Love this place for an amazing burger! Cool ambience, good service, good prices and close to home-what more could you ask for?!"}
{"text":"Just when you think you've had just about any kind of burger, you stumble across Rehab Burger Therapy. The burgers were great, and the service was amazing!"}
{"text":"We have been back several times and every time the service and food are great. but, tonight they totally knocked it out of the park. Fantastic friendly service, great food, and the wings were as good or better than any wings you can get in a dive bar back in Western New York. 

Great job!"}
{"text":"I am cringing as I write this; My husband and I have a 1 year old so date nights are at a minimum for us. This being said, we try to sneak in a 'date lunch' here and there. After reading some stellar positive reviews, we decided to try Rehab Burger Therapy out. Parking was fine, we got into a good spot right away, but as soon as we walked through the door, we were disappointed. We stood in the doorway for a few minutes before anyone noticed us, were sat and ignored for at least 10 minutes. We finally ordered and the server returned 5 minutes later because she 'forgot to take drink orders'. 25 minutes later we were served our food... this is the only reason I gave this joint 2 stars-- the food. The Hawaiian burger and sweet potato tots were so delish, but still didn't make up for the super disappointing service-- after all we didn't lunch until 1pm so it wasn't swamped. We will try again, on an occasion where we have more time bc the food truly was yummy!"}
{"text":"This place was really GOOD!  Great, quick service out on the patio.  The Margatini was perfectly chilled, the Bacon Cheeseburger was delicious (with all the fixins); even the Sweet PotTOT's were perfect!!!"}
{"text":"Great lunch joint - huge helpings and the burgers are ridiculous! Come hungry, for sure."}
{"text":"Huge burgers super good quality meat love the sweet potato tots and how everything tastes like its grilled"}
{"text":"Awesome place. Feels like a Southern California beach bar. Super laid back and great food. The ghost pepper burger is a must try!!! Will be back soon"}
{"text":"Awesome!!!!! I ordered the pbj burger and it tasted heavenly! Service here is great, as well."}
{"text":"I have been to Rehab a couple of times, the burger place not the real kind, and each time I have enjoyed my meal and the excellent service.

The owners are always around and will stop by to chat, they really want the experience to be a good one for their customers.  The sweet potato tots are awesome, especially with the special dipping sauce that has some heat to it.  I always get the smaller sized burger, and with all the toppings and the tots, it is more than enough food.  My favorite one is the Hatch Chile Cheeseburger, just enough heat and they always cook them perfect (I like mine medium rare and I am always getting them overcooked!)  The Turkey Burger is also a solid choice with avocado and pepper jack.  And, unlike many of the other burger places, they have other stuff on their menu too, pastas, sandwiches, and salads.

If I need a burger fix in the Old Town area, Rehab is my top choice."}
{"text":"happy hour 3-7p weekdays. drafts $2 domestic, $3 premium. four peaks brews including peach. some other decent drink deals. 

at the time of this post hh is all day on thursday!

sunday is 11 til 4p. 2 bucks off frozen margarita which is just so damn tasty.

the food and burgers ive tried are all excellent. 

the pot brownies are ridiculous. add ice cream.

whatever you get you probably wont go home hungry."}
{"text":"I dream about this place in my sleep. Yes the wait was long but it is WELL WORTH IT. Food is delicious! Best wings and tots i'v ever had!

Robin (i think that was her name) is the most helpful and caring waitress alive. She recommended small alterations to fit our taste and she knew what she was talking about. Although she was very busy that night, she still sat with us while taking our order and helped us find the right mix to satisfy our hunger. GO SEE ROBIN."}
{"text":"Good bergers. Interesting menu. Be careful ordering the large Berger unless you are real hungry. Good margaritas."}
{"text":"OMG - such a funky cool place.  The waiter - David - was a super cool guy.  Stood there and chatted with us and made us feel super comfortable.  The food is really, really good - great burgers with different styles and toppings.  The sweet potato tots are awesome, as are the onion rings."}
{"text":"I've been a happy Rehab customer for a few years now. Today's combination was a real treat. Chips and salsa started if off (I prefer w/o the Mermaid Dust - just ask nicely, they'll gladly oblige). I don't know what they do special w/ those chips, but it makes me crave them more than is reasonable.   Then ... call me nutso.. I don't care... The Cobb salad. Piled high with all the goodies (I got it w/o the pecans, really). Half the salad is in my fridge right now daring me to hold out until midnight snack! 
First timer or long-timer, drop in ASAP and tell (owners) Denise or Ken \"Dan told me to ask when Tempe grand opening is coming!!\" Yes. Rehab 2, baby!"}
{"text":"Yum yum yum! Fantastic burgers, delicious sides, and great service! Heard a fair bit about this place and I'm happy to say it did not disappoint. Will return without question :)"}
{"text":"There were four of us who went here before a Giants game for our \"pre game\" meal. The highlight of this experience where the mac and cheese burger and the pb & j burger that I had. The pb & j was recommended by our waiter Ryan and it was unbelievably delicious. Our friend who had the mac and cheese burger said it was the best burger he had ever had. Ryan said we had to come back the next day for the Saturday special. 

We came back the next day and 3 people in our party of 7 had the special. It consisted of a 10 oz patty with cheese, bacon, ham, maple syrup, a fired egg and all of the fixing on a bun that was a glazed donut for the top and 1/2 glazed donut for the bottom. They loved it!  For me it was the jalapeño popper burger, it was fantastic. Our waiter, Devin, was a lot of fun, as was Ryan. 

The onion rings and sweet potato tots are the best. 

With 10 days left in our trip we plan on going back for more of this \"health food\"."}
{"text":"I love this place. Great food. I strongly recommend giving the pig wings a try. The burgers are huge and and the sweet potato tater tots are addicting. Huge portions reasonable prices for the location and great service. Would like to see some better beer selections on tap but all in all this place is definitely worth going to when in old town."}
{"text":"Great place!  All four of us went and everyone loved their burgers.  Three of us had the McNalrly burger which reminds you of the old Bobs Big Boy but much better. Thank goodness I got the small size but it was interesting to watch my brother in law eat the full double burger.   One had the chilli burger which was great as well.  The fries are great as well as the sweet potatoe tots. I'm didn't care for the onion rings but everyone else did.  We came from Glendale and will most definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Been there twice. First time would give it 3.5 stars. Was decent. Was there last week. Took forever to get our food and there may have been at most three other groups there ( of maybe a total of 12 people) so it was dead.  Finally got food and every order was wrong. When they finally corrected and got our food, it was below average.   There are far too many other places to go and get burgers, so this place needs to step up their game or they will be done."}
{"text":"This place has great burgers and our server was very chill and overall a rad experience! Seriously the food was unequally prepared, with fresh, high quality ingredients. Our glasses were always refilled and the atmosphere is very casual! Not cheap, but well worth the price! I had the Mac and cheese burger (5oz) which was perfectly cooked! I totally recommend this place, and the downtown Scottsdale location is cool!"}
{"text":"Amazing burgers and sweet potato tater tots. They are big, too. My husband said his turkey burger was the best he has ever had. We will be back the next time we get to Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Best Burgers I have ever had.

I know the PBJ + Bacon Burger sounds weird, but it is oh so good! Sweet and salty and spicy! 

I ate there on three different occasions and every time my burger was perfectly cooked.

Onion rings were awesome too!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday afternoon. This place has awesome specials!!! I ordered the \"hangover burger\" without bacon and without the hatch green chilli with the sweet POTotOES. Omg, you MUST have the sweet POTotOES!! Presentation, food quality, value and service were excellent. If I ever return to Scottsdale, this will be a pitstop! PLEASE OPEN SHOP IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA!!!! :)"}
{"text":"We started with the Calamari which was very delicious and was enough that it could have been a meal in itself. My wife had a Veggie Noogie which is a Portobello mushroom/eggplant/sprouts on a bun and I had Backyard BBQ Burger. Both of our dinners were very good and we had enough leftover for dinner tomorrow night. The waitress was very nice and did a great job! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Not only the best damn burger in Arizona, yes they were rated the #1 burger in the whole state, and it's in our backyard, but they have one of the best chefs who always has more than just burgers for options that are equally amazing. I eat here at least once a week, even though I live 30 mins away. The owners are always nice and striking up conversations, and the staff gives off a vibe of relaxation as soon as you arrive. And if the PB&J burger sounds too weird, it's definitely not. It's my favorite burger and I've had nearly everything on the menu, including weekend special burgers. Go get you some now!"}
{"text":"I wad craving a burger and didn't want the usual chain restaurant type. I found this place on yelp and I am beyond happy with the choice. From the start service was 5 star--the server sat at our table welcomes us as first time patrons, went through detail about the menu options, introduced us to the \"milkshake man\" and gave great recommendations! The burger was amazing, tots excellent, and to our surprise the milkshake man gave us the very first glasses of the vanilla milkshake!!! This place is an A+! I'll def be back! Thank u rehab for satisfying my burger craving"}
{"text":"On a Saturday afternoon we decided to come here. The restaurant was really busy but the servers would take a long time to come around and check on us, the burgers came out cold and the fries were also cold; from what I've heard about this place, I had real high expectations and they all came crumbling down."}
{"text":"Tried this little place out, on the advice of a friend......TOTALLY AMAZING!! I do believe its my new favorite place for a terrific burger! Sweet potatots are addicting and a delicious change from fries! Service was outstanding, everyone smiling and truly looking like the were enjoying themselves! We will be back!!!!! Soon!!!!"}
{"text":"I have an obsession with fish tacos and since moving here 7 months ago, I haven't been able to find one that is even tolerable. I have now, thanks to Rehab Burger Therapy! 

I enjoyed every last bite of my fish tacos the other evening. We went during happy hour and they had cheap beers and pinnacle drinks. My husband had a chicken burger on a pretzel bun and he said the chicken was well seasoned. His fries were also delicious. 

We will definitely be back! I'm still searching for the perfect fish taco down here but I have renewed hope now!"}
{"text":"Are you kidding me with this place? My server was fun, funny, and got everything perfect! She also brought out a ton of the different sauces for us to try without us even asking. 
P.S. I know it sounds terrifying but do yourself a favor and get the PB&J burger...it's like an \"O\" for your mouth!!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered a bacon cheese burger tonight. They charged me an extra $.69 for cheese! The manager told me it was extra. Don't let them rip you off too!!! Double check you bill."}
{"text":"Service was a little slow but they got the orders spot on. The atmosphere was a little to Scottsdale stuck up for my taste. My actual taste buds were pleased though! Had the Hatch Chili burger with the pretzel bun = perfection! The fries had a chili lime seasoning for a great twist! I will certainly be going back to try the Chill Cheese burger."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers I've ever had!  Being very partial to the burgers, I sometimes forget all of the many other options available to order. They have appetizers, 7 different Salads for entrees, wings, Pastas (The Mac & Cheese is AMAZING!) and then...2 1/2 pages of delicious hamburgers!!  They have 2 sizes of hamburgers.  The \"Rehab\" is 10 oz of ground beef and the \"Relapse\" burger is 5 oz of ground beef - the absolute perfect size for ladies. My faves...\"Mushroom and Swiss burger\" and the \"Spicy Mac and Cheese burger\".  They also have a Veggie burger, Turkey burger, and multiple sandwiches.  The restaurant itself is a very laid back vibe. There is seating inside and outside and these beautiful Spring nights make sitting outside an even better experience. Wait staff are very friendly and seem to appear when you need them, yet don't hover at your table. All in all...GO! Go eat one of the best burgers in town. You'll be glad you did!!"}
{"text":"Have a Backyard BBQ and a couple Coronas!
Not too much, not too little!
Great place!  Loved the decor!  Great service!  
Really reasonably priced, too! 
I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Delicious!!!! I had the hangover burger which was so good and I could only eat half. The sweet potato tots were my fave with whatever yellow sauce they serve on the side. I topped it off with a chocolate lava milk shake... Yes please! This place gives a relaxed vibe, good food, decent prices for the sometimes over priced Scottsdale area & I will def be back to try the pb&j burger :)"}
{"text":"Really disappointed after reading all the wonderful recommendations on YELP.   This hamburger place is overrated.  The burger was ok, the onion rings and french fries were not fully cooked and small size.  We struggled to find our waiter to get our drinks re-filled.  The atmosphere is nice but the seating is not super comfortable.  We would not go back there are too many other great burger places."}
{"text":"Waited 20 minutes to order.  Drinks forgotten. Pressured to purchase additional drinks. Food took 45 minutes from ordering. Tables that sat after us received food before. Server stopped bringing out our food to check with other tables. When order was requested to be canceled server rudely said it was already made a few times before finally canceling. Would never return worst service."}
{"text":"If you want a burger where the patty itself is the star of the show, you do not want a rehab burger. Here, the patties are overcooked, under-charred, and under-flavored. The menu offers a wonderful variety of fixins to add to your burger, including at least three different types of buns (brioche, pretzel, and gluten free) and lots of package deals like the Hawaiian burger I had last night (ham, pineapple, jack cheese [I think], and a mostly tasteless liquid claiming to be a teriyaki wasabi aioli) but the beefy taste, if it's there at all, is almost entirely buried beneath the rest. And I say this even though neither the ham nor the pineapple were very tasty. My wife had this problem last time with the PB&J burger, which tasted pretty much like a PB&J sandwich without the burger. I'm not telling folks to stay away, but I think they'll find the sandwich descriptions on the menu more pleasing than what they find on their plates."}
{"text":"This place is the BEST ... The food is amazing the atmosphere is wonderful i highly recommend this place it is the best burgers i have ever had and my daughter loves the fish tacos ... Keep up the good work"}
{"text":"Not what we thought: My fiance and I were really excited to have a burger here since it was the #1 Yelp rated burger place in Scottsdale, but we were disappointed with our burgers. He ordered the Swiss Mushroom Burger and after I took a bite out of it it was really bland. The patty seemed to barely be seasoned and hardly had any savory flavors or high notes. I ordered the Backyard BBQ Burger, and the pineapple BBQ sauce was good as were the 2 giant onion rings, however, the patty was also quite bland and seemed to be seasoned the same way as the Swiss Burger. The Sweet Potato Tater Tots that Yelp users seemed to be raving about was just missing something. They were far too sweet. Maybe it was the batter? Perhaps we just caught them on a bad night. However, the SERVICE was EXCELLENT. Very pleasant and cheerful staff who checked on us frequently and we were also seated very quickly. Our food  arrived without much waiting. The ambiance is fun and inviting with a relaxing, casual beach vibe. All in all, it was ok, but not the type of burger place we anticipated."}
{"text":"Really good burger joints are few and far between and sometimes places try to mask their food quality with great service and a cool atmosphere experience. Old town Scottsdale has a gem in their midst that delivers on all three! These guys are not posers! They know burgers! I had the relapse (5oz party) hangover burger with bacon, fried egg and green chili peppers and a side of sweet potato tater tots. Almost worth killing for! Can't wait to go back into Rehab!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here several times and brought friends and family, they all love it.  Trust me and order the PB&J burger and sweet potato tots, delicious!  Staff is friendly, food is delicious, and beer is ice cold.  You'll love it!"}
{"text":"Food was great..but the wait for those burgers was long!! Our taters were cold, but the waitress did bring us hot and fresh ones upon request. Overall everyone enjoyed the food and would definitely return...but bring your patience."}
{"text":"A great place with an outstanding atmosphere, BUT unfortunately the staff and food need to be improved upon! I ordered a bacon burger cooked medium which I apparently didn't know medium means different things in different restaurants. My food was delivered and looked great , sadly my fries had been cooked too many times and there was no potato left in the middle. I explained to the waitress who wasn't very impressed and grudgingly bought me fresh fries. My burger was raw not medium ( before everyone shouts I eat blue steak) when I  explained this to my waitress she advised me that this is how they cooked their medium burgers and I should have been more specific on how I wanted my medium burger cooked!,,,, Really explain and be more specific! Surely medium means medium. Needless to say I won be going back"}
{"text":"It's not often the BF and I find a place to eat we both enjoy. I'm vegetarian and gluten free while he's a Bacon, Bacon, Bacon, Beef, Potatoes and any other kind of red meat sorta guy. Anyhow, this place is perfect for us! He ordered the PB&J Bacon Burger (which he absolutely loved) and I ordered the Veggie Nuggie with a gluten free bun (very filling and delicious). We both enjoyed our meals and are planning another trip back before we leave the area. There are many great menu options for both of us to choose from, the service was great and the atmosphere was relaxed and welcoming. I highly recommend Rehab!"}
{"text":"First I must say the food was excellent. Definitely a must try if you are a burger fan. However, service was lacking energy and familiarity with menu, hope to go back and possibly just sit at the bar!"}
{"text":"I have only had the turkey burger and sweet potato tots, but it was great!"}
{"text":"ummmm PBJ & Bacon Burger.... whoever the heck came up with this is a freakin genius!!! if you like pb&j and you like bacon, then you will love this. crazy a$$ flavor combination, but it works. Sweet potato tots are pretty dang good too. i'll be back :)"}
{"text":"First visit on Saturday. Great burger and good service. Arrived at 11 and glad we did. Was mobbed by noon."}
{"text":"The mac & cheese burger is probably my favorite thing ever!!"}
{"text":"Love finding different places that offer something more than the norm. We got there 20 after they opened on a Monday and it was packed!!! Was really tempted to get the pb&j burger but couldn't bring myself to do it. Went with the safe Mac & cheese burger! It was good but not amazing. I will definitely go back & try the other stuff at some point but it's just not a must have for me based on the first trip."}
{"text":"Great burgers and service.  Try the pablano burger.  Outstanding.   The fries are goid as well.  Great pkace with great food at a great price."}
{"text":"This is our favorite place in Old Town for a great burger.  The happy hour is fantastic as well.  I really enjoy the staff as they are very hard working yet laid back that makes for a perfect mix."}
{"text":"Yum!!! Best burger in Scottsdale. They have amazing pretzel buns and chili fries, I don't even like chili. The blue cheese burger is to notch! If you like burgers out of the box try this place"}
{"text":"Awesome burger joint! Cool, relaxing atmosphere which goes with the theme so well. Always have had super friendly servers.  Ask for lettuce, tomato, onion and pickle if you're used to your burgers coming with them, will not be assumed that you want it. They got creative with the dipping sauces and are always happy to recommend which goes best with your order. Love the sweet potato tots with the pineapple sauce! My only negative is that when I've taken burgers to go they have always been overlooked. But then again when is take out ever as good as being served a hot dish you can dig into right away?! Definitely give them a try if you're in a burger mood...very accommodating burger options. The poblano and hang over burger are two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"First time I haven't finished off a late of food in a long time and it was sooooo good!!"}
{"text":"Burgers are delish... try one with a fried egg!  Tried the claims as well.  Good portions and fresh!  Service was outstanding!   Will return"}
{"text":"Local, authentic, getting it done right. Friendly staff, great burger, great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Love this place.  The pig wings are a must!   They are sweet with a slow perfect burn."}
{"text":"Great lunch spot, enjoyed the vibe of the place and the food was great. Poblano burger with substitute of the chorizo patty, excellent. What really made our day was our top notch server who answered questions and provided some local suggestions for further fun. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Well just let me say:  \"The food  is amazing\".   Great little spot with super, super service!   The bartender, John, was the best!  The chili was the best I have ever had.  Burger was on a nice brioche roll and cooked just as ordered. Chef send out several samples to try and everything was delicious.  Chipotle aioli and pineapple sauce were delicious.  Sweet potato tots were great.  Very nice frozen margarita and margarita on the rocks.  Several other options if you are not a burger fan. Tuna salad was very good.  Will  definitely be back!"}
{"text":"they have great service, great burgers and phenomenal wings! we go here all the time, even for take out :)"}
{"text":"This place was freakin AWESOME! Came here for the first time  after a baseball game and  was totally worth it! Burgers are delicious, corn on the cob was sooo good must have like crack in the seasoning cause I want more lol! Wish we had this in Vegas! I can't wait to come back down for spring training, definitely a must go to place!"}
{"text":"I've heard about this place since I've been here so I finally got a chance to try it out for lunch yesterday.  First off you can't beat happy hour every day, $3.75 for a pint?  Dang, maybe that's just me coming from LA and expecting $9+ for a beer, but regardless, still happy to see that.  I got the Turkey Burger which was delightful and light enough where food coma was no that H(ard) Core.  It came with sprouts on top which was a first for me to have tasted on a burger and it was not poorly regarded.  I am also a big fan of TOTS!!!  I got the sweet potato tots in place of the fries which of course made me happy!  The plate also, much to my delight, came with 3 AWESOME dipping sauces, garlic aioli, chipotle mayo, & spicy ketchup.  Each sauce was just awesome!  I had to spread the sauce on my burger for each bite i took!  Man oh man!  It was definitely a very satisfying lunch.  I would recommend this spot to anyone, happy hour from 11a-6p :)

Cheers!"}
{"text":"I expected a lot more from this place, but the burger was just mediocre."}
{"text":"We came here at the tail end of our \"Spring Training\" trip in Scottsdale. This could not be a better meal to end the trip. My friends and I all got the PB and J Burger because it was similar to the famous Jiffy burger in Chico, Ca and we were not disappointed! It was amazing and the service was great! Wish that we had one of these in SF."}
{"text":"Just got into town and had the hangover burger. Delicious. Get the sweet potato tater tots with it. Pretty awesome. Great service, fun atmosphere. Will be back."}
{"text":"Amazing food and great service! Everything tasted fresh and the sweet potato tots were a pleasant surprise of deliciousness- definitely recommend them! Our waiter forgot to give us the yelp discount on the brownies but no biggie because they were soooo worth every penny!"}
{"text":"I happened to be in Scottsdale around lunch and discovered rehab burger therapy. I have never been before but I will definitely be back.  I ordered a chicken,  mushroom and Swiss sandwich and the first thing I noticed was that it smelled amazing.  That doesn't happen everywhere.  When I took my first bite I was so happy!  The flavor was amazing and the serving size was generous.  I will definitely be back.  I want my husband to experience this too! 5 stars for sure!"}
{"text":"The food is super good. I went for the Mushroom & Swiss burger. I was hesitant to get the Rehab size since it is 10 ounces, but our waitress gave me a tip--they use the same size bun for the Rehab (10 oz.) and the Relapse (5 oz.) burgers, so I immediately took her advice and went Rehab. The last thing I wanted was a bad ratio of burger to bun. I also opted for the pretzel bun because I am obsessed with them, so any time I see them on a menu I have to indulge. I also opted for the sweet poTOToes, which were so-so. My husband went with the skin-on fries and I liked those better."}
{"text":"A wide variety of burger options and we're not talking about the run of the mill options here.  Large servings, great flavors and a friendly staff.  Would recommend."}
{"text":"HEY YALL...Thanks, but NO THANKS. I ordered the bacon burger. The worst burger that I have ever eaten. DRY DRY DRY....besides the Coolest Bartender and Worlds Best Corn on the Cob...This would just have been a waste of gas. I really really had my hopes up...oh well :-/"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the food is amazing and the people are better. I can't wait to return the next time I'm in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Excellent Hamburger cooked the way you want it.  You don't realize how many times I have ask for a hamburger pink & warm & get a hockey puck instead.  This one was excellent!!!!"}
{"text":"Our first visit here. Staff was very friendly. Salyna (pronounced Selena) was extremely nice, efficient, and checked back frequently to refill tea and water. Ordered the MacNCheese burger on pretzel bun. Since I am retired from a national restaurant chain that specializes in hamburgers, I'm discriminating in my opinion. It was an excellent hamburger - we order the relapse size and my wife had a little of it, and I was still full with my portion. The meat - cooked medium - had a little pink, which is what we wanted, and the MacNCheese was flavorful with a good kick from the sirachi sauce. Toppings were fresh, fries were tasty. The fry portion that came with the burger wasn't huge, so if you are a big fry eater you may want to add an extra order. Saw the onion rings go by to another table and they looked large and fresh. Had a frozen margarita which was well blended (probably a machine which we like) with a tasty margarita mix, lots of salt on the rim, and a large portion. We arrived at 11:15AM  on a Thursday morning and by noon they were on a wait. Just a note: we had a small medical service dog with us  and they were very accommodating and didn't hassle us. We will definitely go back and try other burgers and sides."}
{"text":"We read reviews and had some people talk to us about it... It was exactly what we expected!
We all loved it! I had the Rodrigo da Vinci said it was amazing, I had plenty of left overs for lunch. My boys had the Mac N cheese burger, it was good.
If you do plan on going, go with time because this place is busy! But well worth it"}
{"text":"This was my favorite spot in town when I visit Scottsdale...until tonight. Just got in after a long day of travel, was told I could sit anywhere. Sat at the counter outside, such a nice spot on a wam night!

Was not greeted by someone asking for a drink order, but instead that they were closed. I asked if I could order take out at the bar and was told that would be fine. Walked up to the bartender who said, oh sorry, we're closed.  

I did have a chance to speak to the owner, who was apologetic and offered a seat and to keep the kitchen open for me, I'd lost my taste for Rehab Burger. 

Would I go again? Yes, if in the neighborhood. Would I drive all over Phoenix after a long day of travel like tonight? No."}
{"text":"I've driven past this place a number of times.  This evening my wife and I decided not to drive past.  Glad we did.  I have the Hawaiian Burger with Jamaican corn.  Fries are usually pretty hard to beat but the corn was a stunning surprise.   Wow.  And the burger?  Couldn't put it down.  Definitely a new favorite to add to the rotation."}
{"text":"Love love love this place! Let's start with the laid back beachy vibe and the fun service. Makes me feel like I'm in some surf town not Scottsdale. The food is really yummy. I love the mushroom burger but my favorite thing on the menu is the pig wings with a side of the pineapple aioli. It's amazing. This place gets really busy on the weekends so expect a bit of a wait but in my opinion it's worth it. Their specials are usually really delicious too so don't be shy to try them!"}
{"text":"Great food. Really cool fun atmosphere. Kay was the best and gave great advice about the town to us. Thanks again."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful dinner here during spring training. The burgers were great and the service was amazing. We sat at the bar to have a drink and wait for our table, but the bartender was so good, we decided to stay put and eat there. Kay was hands down the best bartender I have ever watched work. She is super friendly, and VERY competent. The atmosphere is very casual. There are several tv's at the bar, which his pretty big. Even though it was crowded, I never felt smushed eating at the bar. We had a great time."}
{"text":"Whoa! PBJ and Bacon burger was unreal. Service was fantastic and the servers were extremely pleasant and helpful. I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Awesome location in the heart of Mill Ave. This Rehab Burger location is more spacious than the Scottsdale location. The outside patio is very inviting and perfect for enjoying the mild Arizona winter. The staff and food are just as great as in Scottsdale. Been to Tempe Rehab Burger twice with no waiting."}
{"text":"Fun!  Great burger and beachy atmosphere..felt like Southern CA vacation.  No parking but good food!"}
{"text":"I needed a cigarette after the No Poblano burger it was that good."}
{"text":"Very cute place. Not large by any means. We got there at 5pm and it was already pretty filled. There was a variety of people from seniors, to college age kids and families with kids. The burgers are AMAZING! (And beautiful to look at, lol.) Did you check out the photos? I had the onion rings as my side and I loved them. My friends and I were extremely happy to find this place and will be back. They have a small outdoor patio for seating as well, and a public parking lot next door which is convenient."}
{"text":"After making the move to the Scottsdale area from Indiana just a couple days ago, me and my dad were looking for a spot to grab a great burger and beer. Once I began my search the name Rehab Burger Therapy caught my eye. I read the reviews from fellow Yelpers and couldn't help but make the trip to try it out.

Most every review I read had something great to say about the PBJ & Bacon burger, which is what I went with. Now let me remind you that I had already had the best peanut butter burger on earth, the Duane Purvis from the famous Triple XXX in West Lafayette, IN. Don't believe me, just ask any other Purdue alum & they will tell you the same. Although it's hard for me to say it is better than the Duane Purvis, it was damn good. I was a little skeptical about the jelly & bacon part of the equation, but it was a great compliment. An unusual burst of flavor that most any would enjoy, especially if you're the adventurous type. 

As far as beer goes, I just had a simple Bud Light. I would like to see them incorporate more beers into their selections. Perhaps some beers from local micro-breweries, since that is all the craze at the moment. But it was nice a cold, just the way I like it.

Safe to say I'll be back soon to try out one of their other numerous burger options!"}
{"text":"They are dog friendly on the patio and the happy hour is pretty good but unfortunately Im not a huge fan of the taste of the burgers or the heavy thick buns. I will definitely be back though as the staff and little patio is great!"}
{"text":"Great experience! Food and service was great. We had the pig wings, sauce was amazing! Jalapeño popper burger with the pretzel bun and the sweet potato tots were great! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Just wonderful! Can't say enough about the menu and overall vibe of this place!! Excellent service!! I recommend the Tuma Sammy! :)"}
{"text":"PBJ and Bacon Burger was soooo good. Amazing. I'm usually blah on burgers but I'm coming back to have this again. And the sweet potato tots were equally as good. The server was awesome. Totally personable and attentive and cool. Great atmosphere. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This being my first time in Scottsdale, I read the reviews and looked at the pictures and it was a must try. I get there about 10pm on a Saturday night and was attended to right away. The service was awesome and the food was also awesome. The time I got my food from the time I ordered was impressive. Highly recommended to anyone who has never been to this awesome area know as Old Town Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Cute little place.  Very relaxed \"beach cabana type\" atmosphere.  Burgers are monstrous.  I ordered poblano burger with onion rings.  Call me old fashion or just old, but I prefer a traditional juicy flame broiled burger, which this is def. not.  Too much going on with my burger that it completely took away from my meat experience. Patty wasn't moist (I ordered Med well) was lean, I give them that.  Onion rings were meh.  Wine burger has the best onion rings to date.  Kid and family friendly.  Glad I tried it.  Friendly servers."}
{"text":"This is the best place to get a good burger the fries are amazing and the suave selection is great, our server was very friendly and gave my girlfriend and I very good service. I left with my stomach full and didn't break the bank. I strongly recommend this place for any occasion. The setting is very creative and you can outside or inside. Will be coming back soon."}
{"text":"Beer was cold. Staff was attentive. Burger was a MAJOR disappointment.  The burger was Thin and dry as was the bun. Given the reviews.....Was I at the wrong burger joint?"}
{"text":"If you and your family are looking for a quick meal that is reasonable tasting and in the middle of the road, this is the place.  I had one of their burgers which was Ok and my wife had a salad which included lots of greens but no special taste or character.  Service was fast and reasonable.  Ok for a burger bar but I have had better nearby at the same price range."}
{"text":"Some of the best service I have had in a while! Have had the same waitress on both visits -she is a rock star. Plus a great burger. Awesome sauce selections, secret menu / ghost burger & corn on the cob side."}
{"text":"Ok so I'm from out of town and wanted a big juicy burger !!! And I came to the right place. As soon and we walked in  we were greeted by both owners with smiles and hellos. It felt very mom and pop as soon as we sat down. We chose the the bar to sit at because the bartender looked like he was having fun with customers and a SHAKEWeIGHT !!!! Haha oh and it was happy hour!! He did not disappoint ..walking us through the menu and keeping our beers ice cold!!  We got the wings!! Yummy and split the BBQ burger with bacon!! Both fantastic.  This will be a great spot for spring training. Ask for Reno behind the bar. He will turn your day around!!!"}
{"text":"Hit the spot on so many levels,  fresh ground chuck and delicious pretzel bun yummmm. 
Great ambiance, great service.  Really  feel the therapy working. Can't wait to relapse and come back :)
Good job."}
{"text":"Oreganos is missing out!   Rehab has one of the best burgers I've ever tasted and the sweet potato tots are incredible!"}
{"text":"Live in the neighborhood and this is one of my faves that I frequent.  Burger and tot's joint with a tasty spin on burgers with sweet potatoes, dipping sauces and unbelievable portions.  I've tried the apps (wings are awesome), salads (they all taste great and are massively huge), several of the burgers (all good), and believe it or not...I can eat A LOT but I cannot ever eat the Venice Beach Club sandwich by myself.  Only drawback is they need more space because they get busy and you might have to wait a little during peak times but that's because the food is so awesome."}
{"text":"Oh my Goodness, absolutely excellent food and service! Our waitress Nicole really knew her stuff!"}
{"text":"This place was good.  Not the best burger I have ever had, but it was good.  I had the PB and J burger, which is what my server recommended.  It sounds funky but it actually worked out pretty well.  I liked the flavors.  I had the larger size because, why not.  It was definitely filling."}
{"text":"Fun place, fun menu, good burgers ... painfully slow.  Careful if you're trying to squeeze it in a lunch hour."}
{"text":"A-mazing!!!!!! Loved it! Waitress kept my drink full and kept my husbands beers coming. Husband had burger with onion rings and I had the pulled pork on top of mine? will definitely making  the drive to come back again. Fries had just the right amount of spice to them"}
{"text":"I had the Hawaiian Burger today:  Black Forest Ham, Swiss Cheese, Fresh Cut Pineapple and a side of Teriyaki Pineapple Aioli. I chose the pretzel bun.  

The place was clean, the staff friendly and attentive, and the food was really good and cooked as ordered (medium had pink in the center and was juicy).   I would return, and bring friends."}
{"text":"Tons of choices and lots of unique hamburger variations to choose from.  Awesome service from our amazing waitress.  Management is superb as well.   Looking forward to our next visit!"}
{"text":"Not sure if it was just a off day or what not but...

Had to clarify our order twice with the waitress and it still got messed up. Not a custom order or anything, we just had never been their before so all the options for buns, sizes and cooking temperature were never asked so we never got want we expected. Slow and inattentive throughout our stay, really bad.

Burgers were really nothing special. Patties were tough and flavorless (ordered medium and rare respectfully). Toppings were ok but they seem to try to counter their mediocrity with huge portions. Fries were underdone and just... meh. I wanted to love this place based on its pictures, and the food /looked/ good, but just didn't taste good at all. With the lousy service it was a total fail unfortunately :-/"}
{"text":"I've been to this establishment a few times, not sure what all the service complaints are about. The service here has never been shitty but it's possibly because I choose to eat at this pretty popular and tiny restaurant at non-peak hours or take my food to go. 

My personal favorite, the peanut butter jelly bacon sriracha burger, sounds gross but i've recommended it to people before and the daring few who have tried it, enjoyed it.
Their spicy mac n cheese is pretty good, not the best but definitely worth the price and if you like a kick of heat with your cheese.
I've tried several of their burgers and none have been a disappointment, so I feel this place is worth trying especially if you enjoy trying weird burger combinations or just want a tasty gourmet burger in general. 
They also have a good happy hour."}
{"text":"I wish I could have loved this place because it has a great location and inviting atmosphere.  I was too disappointed that when we ate there (on a Sunday) they were out of quite of a few items.  No avocado or gluten-free bun today?!?  I tried to look past that an ordered a protein-style burger instead.  It was good, not anything to write home about."}
{"text":"This is my 2nd favorite hamburger place I have EVER eaten at!... My food is always perfect! I love the pretzel bun! I would strongly suggest trying the pretzel bun! The sweet potato tots are amazing!!! All of the staff I have meet are amazing, the owners are awesome, and the Kimmy special drink is not only refreshing but almost guilt free. I practice out of a clinic close by so I have even had lunch meetings here! I couldn't recommend Rehab Nurger more!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, great service, phenomenal food! The decor and music gave a mellow vibe. If I didn't live so far away I'd be back on the regular!"}
{"text":"It's been three hours since I finished eating at Rehab Burger Therapy and I'm still stuffed.  I had their Backyard BBQ Burger and when it came out with a huge knife through the middle of a soft Brioche bun and with two HUGE onion rings I thought I was in heaven (with a little indigestion).  The burger was cooked perfect and the Spicy Ketchup rocked.  The fries that came with were just ordinary (under seasoned) but the dipping sauces made it worth the calories.

My mother had the hatch Chili Burger which was equally great mainly because of the chili's, chipotle aioli and the incredible Pretzel Bun.  I don't think I would order another sandwich from here without the Pretzel Bun.  She also had the Sweet Potato tots which which were a great twist on regular fries.

We had a very small amount of room left in our tummy so we decided to split an Orange Milkshake. Great decision!  It tasted like the old Orangecicle from my youth.  It was nice and smooth and not so thick that it gave you a shake ache.

Place was fun, service was friendly and food was outstanding.  Will go back again soon!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times now since it opened. Best burgers in Tempe, so many good ones to choose from!  

Great atmosphere, very attentive staff & nice patio. Cheap drinks for happy hour plus all day thursday. Always looking forward to returning."}
{"text":"Really solid burgers and salads. 

Everything on the menu comes in HUGE portions so consider sharing.

The wait staff is really nice! 

If you are in the mood for a burger - this is a good eat!"}
{"text":"Poor customer service. Waited 45 minutes just to get a beer and water. Waited another 30 minutes to put in an order. During a slight rush, I still should not have waited that long. 

Chill vibe, doubt I come back to visit."}
{"text":"Seriously the best burger I've ever had! The atmosphere here is so awesome too. Everyone is so chill. When our family was in town, this was the first place we took them to try! They loved it too! ;)"}
{"text":"Place is a joke and their portion's are hit and miss. You never get what you pay for it's more along the lines of if the cook staff are being lazy that day not giving the correct amount of food to everyone and the servers not caring enough to send back to the kitchen before giving it to the customer."}
{"text":"We visited based on rave yelp reviews, and now we can say we've been there. :/  we sat at the bar & service was fine, although they ran out of gluten free buns (on a Wednesday??) so I had to eat a burger patty with watery iceberg lettuce. There were many burger offerings, so that was kind of fun, if you don't care about how bad all the ingredients are for you . So if you are a health conscious person, you might want to pass on this place."}
{"text":"Awesome experience here! A little unsure about the PB and J Bacon burger when I saw it on the menu but it turned out to be an excellent decision when I was licking my fingers at the end. You got to try this one!"}
{"text":"Very quick, respectful service. Tasty food, Liked the atmosphere. No complaints! Ian was great! I recommend this place."}
{"text":"so bomb! fries are solid too!  really cool environment and in a sea of burger places that all feel and taste the same Rehab is crushing it!!!!"}
{"text":"Good burgers but rude service. Overall not very responsive and didn't seem to want to serve our table because we were here with a big group."}
{"text":"I am so excited about this location. I had an out of town guest come to town and I knew I wanted to have him try a Rehab burger. I was worried about driving to Scottsdale on a Saturday night, and having it be packed with a long wait. I was pleasantly surprised when I learned there was a location only a few blocks away from where we were! I called to ask what the wait looked like and was told they were busy- but there were a few spots at the bar open. Kassie at the bar was so kind on the phone, and since we were on our way, and two blocks away, she said she would hold a couple spots for us. I was shocked, that was so thoughtful of her, and it made me feel taken care of, and welcome before I ever stepped through the doors. This location exceeded my already high expectations, and it didn't disappoint in any way. The PBJ burger is my all time favorite and can't be missed. Amazing food! Perfection in the burgers all the way. The staff and vibe are so welcoming, and the customer service was simply awesome. Ian was our server and even brought us a small side of his favorite sauce to try for dipping the yummy sweet potato tots.***!! It's the little things that make the biggest impact. Special thanks to Kim, Ian, and Kassie- You made our dinner date perfect! We will be back- I'll be dreaming of pretzel buns, tots, and PB until we do:)"}
{"text":"Outstanding service, excellent food, great atmosphere and over all one of the best ever. 

For those in town visiting, you will not be dissatisfied, you will walk away full, happy and wanting to go back. 

Enjoy, outstanding!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Fantastic burgers! Great service! Dog friendly to boot! More detailed review to follow."}
{"text":"every time i come here i order the clams... the mushroom burger's yum as well as the sweet tater tots - surprisingly the PB&J burger is quite tasty"}
{"text":"Great burgers! Great atmosphere! Vibe is relaxed and laid back! Had the bacon cheese burger, husband had the hangover burger. Perfectly cooked to medium as we requested! The onion rings were awesome! Definitely must for all you burger lovers!"}
{"text":"Probably 2 1/2 stars.  Given all the 4-5 star reviews it is likely a bunch of college student reviews.  The burgers look great in the pictures.  They are just OK.  We had a Hatch chili burger, bacon bleu with pretzel bun and a chicken sandwich.  They were cooked as ordered but the beef, toppings nor bread had any great flavor to speak of.  Not bad, just not good. Service was timely and polite and friendly .  The atmosphere - specifically the menu design is very chain restaurant-like (hokey).  Looks like a good place to have a couple beers. 

The bigger issue was the staff dress.  The hostess was awful.  She was wearing an ill-fitting tank top and tights.  There was another waitress who was wearing a sleeveless t-shirt.  But she also had something tying the shirt back in such a way that her back was showing off a large tattoo but also ridiculous side-boob.  Trashy in general but disgusting as a food server.  Not sure if everyone got cold suddenly or the manager made them cover up as these two had jackets on when we left."}
{"text":"I will never forget the first time I ate the \"porkster\" burger here, mostly because never before had I had impure thoughts about a hamburger. 

the decor is fine, though i do wonder why there are so many damn bikes strapped to the walls/ceiling. the servers have been friendly and attentive every time i've been there."}
{"text":"I have loved this place for years and the fact that part of the ownership is from CORONADO helps. LOL!  Denise and Wiley are phenomenal people and know what the public wants or needs.  I love their vegan choices and my family loves the non-vegan choices. LOL  LOVE the atmosphere, wish it was bigger to accommodate everyone as there is usually a wait to get in. There is a reason for that.. they are GREAT!"}
{"text":"My family and I liked this place. The whole restaurant is very small and cramped, but I do like the decor and theme. Our waitress was extremely nice and helpful and funny as well. I love how extensive the menu is. Our food came out pretty quickly and the favorite among my family was the spicy Mac n cheese burger! Very tasty and I would definitely come back for that burger! Also very well priced and even the build your own burger was pretty good. I wouldn't recommend this place for families with small kids, but I would definitely recommend to everyone else! The only really I'm not giving it 5 stars is because of how cramped and tight the restaurant was."}
{"text":"Great food and great service.

We parked next door and as we walked up, there was a bright and happy hostess to greet us. Everyone in the restaurant was smiling and said high to us. I felt like I was Norm walking into Cheers.

Our waitress was excited and knowledgeable, bright and fast. We had some really good burgers, but I would pass on the sweet potato tots next time.  I love sweet potato fries but I've tried SP tots at a few places now and they always seem to be bland.  But the burgers and the service make this place.

I wish we had one of these in the west valley."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times now, and every time, had a wonderful experience. So far, some of the best burgers in town in my opinion. I love the atmosphere, and the service has always been good. Great destination for a bike ride!"}
{"text":"My friends and I set a goal of eating at a different restaurant each week. Each of us rate the restaurant from 1-10 on service, atmosphere, and of course the food. This week we choose the Rehab... all three of us rated it a solid 10, 10, and 10. We recommend the Rehab Burger Therapy in that it inexpensive and it will provide a lasting memorable experience that will bring you back again."}
{"text":"Yummy and hot  - good margaritas. Never had a bad experience. Love to sit outside. Calamari is better than you expect at a burger joint"}
{"text":"Wanna start by saying this was a slightly better then decent burger. They're pretty large for the price and better then many places I've been in Phoenix but not all that amazing overall.

I had the Hangover Burger. It was a 10oz patty with cheese, bacon, a fried egg and green chiles with a pretzel bun. 

The burger looked fantastic however it seemed a bit light on flavor, slightly bland. Usually when I order a burger with a fried egg I don't need any type of sauce however I found myself dipping it in the ketchup they brought for the fries. The bottom bun became soggy pretty quick and it got annoyingly messy. 

The service was good and the ambiance was typical for a place like this however the beer selection was kind of mediocre. 

I'd probably come here again if other people wanted to try it but otherwise it was worth trying once I guess. Judging from the reviews maybe I just didn't order the right one or they were having an \"off\" day. It happens."}
{"text":"This is a solid burger place. Loved their brunch selections and patio seating area. The Turkey Burger that we customized was juicy and flavorful. I don't eat Red Meat so finding a good Turkey Burger is like finding gold. Nice variation of wine, beer and cocktails. Sweet potato fries were on point too. Go here and you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place was great upon entering. Crowded, good ambiance, really nice and friendly staff. It had everything you'd want walking into a restaurant.

Unfortunately, it stopped there. Burgers were just ok. Asked for mine medium rare and it was more medium/medium well. I've had better burgers in lots of other places.

You know it's not a great experience when you go to a place with \"an amazing burger\" and the best part was the onion rings.

Fun time, great service, below average food."}
{"text":"Outstanding! Just came into town from Los Angeles and the servers went out of their way to take care of me! The pb&j burger was phenomenal so many depths of flavors, one of the servers (I think Jon?) even stated \"you should close your eyes and experience everything that's happening right now!\" Lol. They even had some tips on places I should visit while in town. I highly recommend this place, super friendly and great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"The reason we picked out this place is because they have gluten free buns! Which is awesome, cause I still like to eat burgers even if I can't have gluten!

The burger tasted delicious, the fries were really good (and as a Belgian you can say I know a thing or two about fries) and the staff was super friendly! We'll return to this place.

I would suggest to make a reservation, since this place seems really popular.."}
{"text":"Loved this place ,visiting from California and wish we had one there!! Great burgers and really great service by Rian!! Highly recommend, get the mac & chez burger on pretzel bun !! Insane!!"}
{"text":"Love this place ! Mine and my husband's favorite burger spot in Scottsdale! (All it's missing is the ocean view!) We like to split the double Gnarly Mac burger on pretzel bun with fries which is modeled after the Big Mac  (burger is always plenty but might want to order a second basket of fries if you're sharing!) I'm pregnant right now and totally missing their frozen Coronarita's - they're better than anyone's in our opinion! Service is always friendly and they are always busy- tend to wait 5-25 min for a table of 2. Try to hit it up on a Thursday when Happy Hour is open-close  or weekday 3-6!"}
{"text":"YUMMM! Was craving a burger and decided to take the 20 minute drive to Scottsdale to try this place and I am glad we did! Hubby got the PB&J burger which he says the flavors melded really well together and didn't taste like a straight up PB&J. I had the Poblano burger With their spicy onions on the side...so good! Atmosphere was fun and inviting. For sure will be back."}
{"text":"Excellent! Happy hour all day. We enjoyed the Bacon Blue burger and it was perfect. Save room for dessert. We had the brownie marshmallow fluff toasted with ice cream. And it was fantastic."}
{"text":"Probably the best burger I've ever eaten in my whole entire life. Out of all the burgers I've ever eaten in my life, this was the best burger I've ever had. The atmosphere is so welcoming and they have so many burger options to chose from. I really wish they had a rehab burger in Maryland. I would fly to Arizona just for the burger. I am in love"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place! The burgers are always amazing, bartenders are friendly and make great drinks, and even when it's busy service is efficient. Sweet potato tots always, and you can't go wrong with any of the burgers."}
{"text":"This is a great place to eat!  My wife and I stopped here with outer two kids and we all found something to eat that we all enjoyed!  Service was friendly, attentive and prompt!  We will definitely come here again the next time we are in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"A friend from out of state and I went here last night for the first time. This is my first unsolicited Yelp! review. It was just THAT GOOD.

The service was excellent (Ryan)! We felt both very taken care of and not smothered at the same time, which is really remarkable and so so satisfying. The food was great - I had the turkey burger and fries.

I'm not a wordsmith and I don't think the review needs to go past: Excellent service, great food, amazing time! :)"}
{"text":"Yummmmm! The peanut butter jelly bacon sriracha burger is not to be missed! It is absolutely indulgent. And go for the sweet potato tots! It gets rather warm inside with the door opening up and letting all the A/C out. And the bathrooms were like a sauna! However, I will brave the warm environment for that burger.  
The guys in our group ordered the bigger burger the first time and then realized quickly that the smaller size is just fine. With the side, you definitely won't leave hungry. 
I tasted my fellow diner's pork and, although tasty, would definitely order the burger."}
{"text":"My rating is more of 3.5 than a full 4 but oh well, its still good. Rehab Burger Therapy is maybe one of the worst names for a restaurant I've heard but still it didn't stop me from going in. Decor has no relation to name. Surfer looking joint. Which is fine. Menu doesn't relate to either concept, surfing or Rehab other than the sizing of the burger being \"Rehab\" for bigger and \"Relapse\" for the smaller.  Walked in on a February afternoon, restaurant is a bit on the warmer side, air's a little thick. Maybe just the day but still not perfect setting. Who cares about setting really, lets talk about the food. First of all the main reason I leaned to the 4 instead of 3 stars is mainly due to the waitress being pretty cute. That's a plus in my book. We started out with the calamari which was a great choice. Really good. They gave a really generous portion and we devoured it right away. Waitress brought us 3 different dipping sauces not sure if thats the norm, one was medium buffalo sauce that they put on the wings which she said \"one of my favorites\", 2nd was a chipotle something another, and the 3rd was the marinara that they give normally. All were fantastic! The buffalo sauce worked really well with the batter on the calamari and the other two were equally great. Like i said, we devoured it. Great start. We ordered beers, decent prices but not as chilled as they should've been. The three of us ordered all burgers, one had pulled pork on the burger but we were told they didn't have any pulled pork. Not good. We eventually ordered the bbq burger, chili cheese burger and the whatever the name was that had grilled pineapple, cheese and ham on this burger. BBQ burger went over really well. Pineapple ham burger also went over splendidly. My chili burger not quiet as good. The chili is good, would've been better as a side dish then on the burger. The whole plate when brought out was covered in chili. The bottom of my pretzel bun couldn't be found as it turned to mush from sitting in chili. Not good. The burgers are large but could use some kind of seasoning, a little on the bland side. Pretzel bun was ok, I've had better. You can buy better at Costco. Maybe they should do a daily run over there every day instead. The fries sucked. Barely ate any. The sweet potato tots were ok at best. Their sides need work for sure. Service even though she's pretty she was not the most prompt and kinda didn't show up for a while even though business was rather slow at this time. So there is some negatives but there was more positives so therefore a positive rating. I like the place but it does have room to improve. Hopefully if there is a next time, and it will be."}
{"text":"Ridiculously good burger, added the Chipoltle aioli sauce. Should have ordered the 5oz and not the 10oz as it was massive. nice bar atmosphere, can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"Overrated... Pretty good burger (nothing to come back again for) and non crispy tots! Also the place is filthy and has birds inside. My silverware was much less than clean and the napkins they gave us had sauce stains on them ew! Skip unless you like eating in filth."}
{"text":"My teenage son found this place when we were in Scottsdale & it was a great find!  I'm not a big burger fan, but even I thought it was great!  Both of my boys loved their food & were filled up by the portions (amazing with their seemingly bottomless stomachs!).  The service was good, the place was clean & had a fun vibe.  A great find that I would go back to again!"}
{"text":"I LOVE REHAB BURGER! I'm in once a week for a regular order, and Courtney behind the bar always knows what I'm in for! Love the food, love the vibe. My only request is a dedicated to go service during spring break....I like to call my order in and pick up instead of mingling with the out of towners and that option isn't always available."}
{"text":"While the service was fine, the mushroom Swiss burger was completely overcooked and under seasoned. They also initially gave me the wrong order but as much as I tried to overlook it, the burger was just bland, dry, and grey.  I wanted to like this place but the food was just terrible. I can only stomach a few bites before I called it quits."}
{"text":"Excellent food.  One of the best burgers I've ever had.  Staff was overly nice, clean restaurant, and nice environment"}
{"text":"Ordered the Know Pablano Burger, it was amazing. Cooked perfectly. I got the onions rings as well which were good, but probably just stick with fries next time. Their side sauces are very good, but the burger dint need them and I enjoyed it without."}
{"text":"This place is a lot of fun and the service is exceptional. The portions are YUGE! I've never seen so much calamari on a single plate. I'm a big guy and a big eater, but couldn't finish the salad that I ordered. I would definitely seek this place out - it's fun, a good value, and yummy in a part of Scottsdale that tends more to the pretentious. If you have to wait for a table there's a pawn shop next door where you can pick out your next guitar, gun, or power tool."}
{"text":"Great place for a great burger , my boss tried to talk me into the PB and J burger swearing how good it is , I stuck to a trusted favorite \" mushroom Swiss . Popular place , so get there early for good seating . Good burgers !!"}
{"text":"KICK BACK and enjoy a burger.  One of best places to come in, sit back and chill out.
The staff is really friendly.  The food is great.  You have a huge selection of burgers.  While, I'm still loyal to the Chili burger, they have been trying to get me to eat the PB and J burger.  95/5 quality meat.  Order with pretzel bun.  I recommend this place to everyone...even vegetarians.  Keep up the good work...."}
{"text":"I went again yesterday, and had a totally different expierence. Everyone was awesome, instead of making my one I just ordered the huge rehab sized Mac Gnarly Burger with fries and had an infinitely better time/meal."}
{"text":"Absolutely love rehab burger! My family and I go every Sunday so we have gotten to know the staff and they always take great care of us. 
Amazing food and the best burger in town. Love the McNarghly burger! We are so excited to see them growing to more locations."}
{"text":"Came here in hopes of finding a gluten-free burger I could actually eat after being diagnosed with Celiac disease...and was pleasantly surprised! Not only was there a GF burger on their menu, but it was delicious! We had awesome service, and left completely content (and FULL)! Will definitely be visiting again soon."}
{"text":"Very friendly and informative staff here, got right in and seated... Prompt service and drinks always full!! Good job guys I enjoyed the food, burgers cooked great!! Great selection of buns and they have gluten free buns, which my wife really loved with the turkey burger cooked to perfection!! I cant wait for the Mill ave location to open COMING SOON!! I actually bike with the partial owner Wiley who let us know about their new burger concoction also COMING SOON!! See ya soon!!!"}
{"text":"This is the best burger I've EVER had!!!    Fair prices, fun atmosphere and a very polite staff.  Never had a burger here that I haven't liked, but the PB & J bacon burger is on another level!  ONE OF the best if not the best burger you will eve have.  This is my favorite spot in Scottsdale and they just opened another location in Tempe.  I've MADE at least 10 people try the PB & J bacon burger (a few of them against their will and everyone agreed that it is one of the best burgers they've ever had.  I know it sounds like it wouldn't work, but try it.  I can't stay away!!!!"}
{"text":"Just visited today for lunch. I can't remember the last time I saw a place with every single table full. Food was really good. My pretzel bun was my only complaint. The bottom half was a bit soggy. I highly recommend the sweet potato tots. Service was great even so far the whole place works off of team service. My husband thought that something was missing on his burger. The manager immediately noticed and came over to see if everything was okay. We were in and out within a reasonable amount of time. We went here based off of the thousand plus Yelp reviews. Glad we went :)"}
{"text":"We got seated, near the front door, the other side of which had people smoking, and each time the door opened, we were hit by smoke.  Waiter seats us, gets our drink order, we receive it, and he vanishes, never to be seen again.  Waitress walks by, spills a plate of food, I get hit with some sauce all over my pants, and waitress vows to come back with something to clean my clothing with.  Evidently she vanished with our waiter because she never returns.  So..after all that smoke, wet clothes, no service, we walk to the cashier, explain what happens, pay our bill, and get nothing even resembling an apology.  So, we vanished too, not coming back, if we see the waiter and waitress out in the other dimension, we will tell them to go back to work."}
{"text":"We don't usually frequent the area, especially at night, but a meeting brought us in the area...  We searched Yelp for quite sometime trying to figure out what we wanted for dinner.... We landed here...

It was a great find.  While I don't usually find myself comfortable mingling with the Scottsdale crowd... makes me feel old... the crowd here wasn't too \"typical\".  The staff here was uber friendly and fun.  The decor was eclectic and amusing. They pour a mean drink and the Four Peaks Peach was the coldest I've ever had it poured. The menu was quirky and there were quite a few great choices on it.  The burger was delicious, the brownie was awesome.... definitely blow on it first... that peanut butter cup was a scorcher on my tongue. 

Definitely a fun place to be and plenty of free covered parking next door is a plus!"}
{"text":"We loved it. A lot of food.  The pb & j burger was delicious   I would stick to sweet potato tots. Onion rings nothing to speak about"}
{"text":"Turkey burger was excellent but didn't really care for the sweet tots. Other than that we loved everything!"}
{"text":"This place rocked my palate. This I had the Philly burger. It was one of the best burgers I've tasted in my entire life. I don't like sweet potatoes but I saw every table in the entire restaurant had them so I went for the sweet potato tots. Epic. Highly recommended.  Eat here at least once.  I will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"Looks like we had the same experience as a few otherS. Seriously fun food choices! Everyone liked their food, some of the flavor combos were a bit too weird for me- but I appreciated the creativity! Our only negative was the service, she seemed overwhelmed or under-trained??? Long wait for drinks, the check and especially returning the redit cards aftr we paid."}
{"text":"Great service,  The waitstaff is always checking on how your food is and are you having a good time.The burger was great the french fries were great and the sweet potato tater tots or unique and really good."}
{"text":"I love this place....  I can never decide what burger I want any time I go here because they are all so good.   Also the sweet potato tots!  Seriously awesome go try it.  One of the best burgers in Scottsdale"}
{"text":"Today I'm having the pbj burger with sweet potato fries and like always great service and great atmosphere"}
{"text":"Besides the burgers I really like the wings in rehab burger. They also have a good customer service, and the restaurant's atmosphere is very warm and friendly."}
{"text":"By far, favorite burger place in the valley. Burgers are always nice and juicy, and good size. Lots of great toppings, and their sweet potato tots are insanely good! (Don't forget to try one of they're many sauces, the pineapple BBQ is my favorite)

Friendly staff, nice decor. Always busy on weekends. I'd give it 4 1/2 stars, service is sometimes a little slow. Otherwise very solid burger place, worth the the money!"}
{"text":"Tried the Hangover Burger on a pretzel bun. It held up to the hype. Excellent burger. My wife had their Hatch Burger? I didn't pay attention to what it was called.  Anyway, she loved it so much that she  considered  ordering another one to go. Lol. Great atmosphere, great service and excellent Burgers."}
{"text":"Small place with a relaxed beach feel to it.  

Not the best burger I have had, but it is definitely up there towards the top.  They have a lot of different burgers on their menu.  I have only tried two of them, but they were both great.

Not a good place to watch sports though, I think I counted 2 TVs in the whole place (including the bar)"}
{"text":"Food is pretty good, but you made a poor choice with one of your servers. There's a guy who works there, best way to describe him is by what I believe is a half-sleeve tattoo.  He wasn't friendly, or at all accommodating.  It's frustrating to go out for dinner and have a server ruin your meal, when you're just trying to have a good time. Rarely do I ever comment on a server, as it takes a lot to really irritate me, but this guy needs some training and how to provide a basic good customer service experience.   

Our group could not figure out why he would act like that, when clearly servers should know that friendliness pays, and the tip could be affected if they treat our group like crap.

Please see that he undersrands how to better treat your paying guests. Thanks"}
{"text":"The pbj burger with the pretzel bun it is to die for and great atmosphere and owners are awesome as well stop in for great drinks great friends and good times"}
{"text":"Peanuts and jelly were amazing combinations. It was very tasty. I want to eat this again. I will definitely come again."}
{"text":"We waited 2 hours for burgers that we ordered. We finally asked how long it would be and were told we were still the third order in line. The rush for lunch was long over when we ordered. Maybe they were just too exhausted from the earlier rush. The bartender was very friendly! We ended up canceling our food order so we can't rate on it."}
{"text":"I love this burger place. When I tell people about the menu they give me a look like I'm somewhat crazy but I have tried at least 6 of the specialty burgers on the menu and they have not failed me at all. Especially the PB&J burger. From the peanut butter n jelly to the Sriracha sauce. It just works. The service is always good, beer n alcohol choices are good and the bucket of jawbreakers on the way out is just an added plus. Definitely a good spot to grab a burger n a beer"}
{"text":"Had lunch here and the food was great!  The only reason for the four stars was the location and parking.  We had a heck of a time finding it and God was no help.  We persevered and it was worth it.  Even the $5 to park in the garage.  Burger was deliciously messy and the fries were scrummy!"}
{"text":"This was a great, fun little place.  The whole family had great meals.  I had the Bacon & Blue.  I would highly recommend."}
{"text":"You probably have to be a lover of red meat to fully appreciate all that Rehab Burger Therapy offers.  I do not fit into that category but I'm a fan, nonetheless.  They have a pretty tasty turkey burger.  When you add all the 'fixin's', some fries and an ice cold beer; it makes for a darn good meal!

What stands out even more than the food, in my opinion, is the service.  I can't recall having more genuinely friendly service.  John is awesome and made sure I was well taken care of during my visit; however, everyone in the vicinity greeted me warmly and chatted me up as I ate.  I appreciated that, as I dined alone at the bar.  

The menu has a variety of items that sound tempting.  It is definitely worth a return visit."}
{"text":"Amazing food, service, atmosphere!!! Sit at the bar!!!! Reno will take good care of you! Ask him to do toothpick trick!"}
{"text":"great place, love the atmosphere. Great food, only bad thing was they forgot the cheese on our Bacon Cheeseburgers. The waitress needs to relax a little and have fun. Would definately go back."}
{"text":"The burger here is one of best I ever had, my wife and son both had a salad which they raved about, service was excellent. Bottom line this is a true five star."}
{"text":"tried this new joint craving a good burger and it delivered! I had the turkey island burger and my girlfriend had the mushroom swiss burger. Both were juicy and cooked perfectly. It offers two sizes and the even the smaller portion is enough. The service was great and friendly and the decor had an \"island feel\". The bar had any and every spirit possible. Try the spicy ketchup with your amazing sweet potato tots. We are definitely going back to try something new!"}
{"text":"Excellent.  Food is outstanding, fresh and oh so tasty.
New waitstaff, just as excellent as my last visit."}
{"text":"Great food, but the beer menu greatly lacks. No true craft beer - Four Peaks is owned by the massive giant that makes Budweiser. And what goes better with a handcrafted burger than a handcrafted  beer?

Hopefully the next time I'm in town, they'll at least have 1-2 options from their independent local breweries."}
{"text":"First time there and it was amazing. Our waiter David made sure we were 100% satisfied! That place is how customer service should be given. Love, love, love. We will def be going back."}
{"text":"Very creative burgers type, good service great food. The 5 oz was big enough can't imagine the 10 oz."}
{"text":"Needed a burger found a burger. Awesome burger and fries cooked perfectly. Full bar, TV for sports and relaxed atmosphere. Our waiter was awesome and food came quick and hot. Go for the pretzel bun!!"}
{"text":"I love looking for the best burger in whatever city I find myself in. 'Rehab' fulfilled my wildest dreams. 

Think about the PBJ burger. I know I know, it sounds like a reach, but the flavors work very well. The sweet potato fries and the cold slaw (with a sweet base- as opposed to vinegar) round out the meal. 

The wait staff are awesome and friendly. 

Two thumbs way up."}
{"text":"I have been going to rehab burger for years! Funny thing tho, I don't eat red meat, but I get their Da Vinci salad every time! It's my favorite chicken salad and the portion is shareable! I have to take half home every time! Today a couple of my friends and I came in to grab a quick bite for lunch and ended up staying unusually long and ordering more food because we were enjoying ourselves so much. Kay was waiting on us and was exceptionally helpful, knowledgable of the menu and specials, friendly, and with a fun personality to boot! Always a good meal, great staff, and I love the beachy decor!"}
{"text":"AMAZING FOOD!!!  

I got the PB&J Bacon burger...heavenly!!  My husband had the Porkster Burger...also great!!!  The Sweet PoTOToes were amazing as well.  The dessert just topped everything off!!

The servers were busy, but very attentive and friendly!! 

We will be coming back here again for sure!!"}
{"text":"This place is great! It is by far my husband's favorite restaurant and we are here weekly. Serving sizes are huge! Even the relapse burger (the \"small\" one) leaves me with leftovers. Drinks are great and my favorites are the Margatini and the medium Bloody. For burgers I always go with the Spicy Mac and it never disappoints. 

I'm not always in the mood for a burger so sometimes I just eat my husbands tots and get extra veggies to throw in my Bloody. The weird part is they also charge me a couple bucks for the veggies, but $2 isn't bad so it doesn't bug me, it's just weird to me. Other times I get their pastas which are great or an appetizer. My favorites are the queso dip and the calamari. I'm from CA right on the beach so I'm used to picking out your seafood from the traps on the patio and I can tell the calamari has been on ice, but I still order it so it isn't bad enough to not go back for more.

It is deceptively inexpensive too. We brought my parents and a family friend here last weekend (5 hungry adults total) and ordered a burger each, the pork wings, and a cocktail each and it only came to about $100. I expected it to be more than that so when I sprung to pick up the tab I was pleasantly surprised. They also have cash back through Yelp which is awesome because I get paid to eat somewhere I'm already going to be.

We all were pretty let down when we went on a Sunday at 5pm and they were out of pretzel buns and onion rings. They blamed it on being busy and us coming on a Sunday saying that's the norm, but why not order enough materials to accommodate the weekly needs of your guests if that is the case? One complaint my dad had was that the burgers can be a bit overloaded and busy. I think it's just a millennial thing that we do to food and I agree, but as I watch my husband devour a maple bacon donut burger dripping with Swiss cheese and all kinds of sauces, I can't fault them for it. I swear he'd leave me for that burger if you made it a normal item on the menu, lol.

Come with an appetite and be ready to walk out with leftovers."}
{"text":"I went there for dinner with a coworker.  The waitress was very friendly and got use hooked up with her favorite items on menu.  

I highly recommed the burger with pineapple abd my coworker recommends the pablano pepper burger.  Fries and tots were really good.  

They even disclaimer that their portions are large.  They were right.

Highly recommend this place to anyone.  Save room for dessert."}
{"text":"Excellent food, the burgers were huge, the small pasta was a very full plate. Great atmosphere, a great beachy feel right here in Scottsdale. The prices seem a bit high but for the amount of food you get it's not bad. The pot browny was huge. Really a great meal, so large we ate half and are saving the other half for later. Definitely a good value and great tastes."}
{"text":"Delicious burgers and dogs! Atmosphere is cool! Been there several times. The mac & cheese burger is amazing!!!"}
{"text":"This place is all hype!  I waited over hour for the driest burger I've ever had.  Service was marginal, they had nba on tv during March madness just shows how out of touch they are.
I don't get it???? Why such a high rating when this place blows!
Don't waste your time!  It's just hype.
Say it with me...I ain't going to rehab, l say no no no...."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time yesterday, and it was the best experience I've ever had in Scottsdale.  The bartender was very friendly, energetic and passionate, the food was out of this world, I had the BBQ burger on a pretzel roll with fries.  The BBQ sauce was spicier than I expected for a \"house bbq sauce\", they really went on a limb for that, I enjoy spicy foods so this was a welcomed surprise for me.  

I had the smaller of the two burgers, which was huge!  I will be back anytime I'm in Scottsdale, I will send anyone who asks \"where should I go in Scottsdale?\" there.  Needless to say, I was impressed."}
{"text":"The food was quite good. I loved the burgers and the sweet taters, and the dishes were well crafted. The Spicy Mac-N-Cheese was not all that spicy by my standards. The service was the biggest issue-it was a busy night, but it took an hour to get our entrees and a good 15 minutes to get the condiments and 15 for the check. I wish they would hire more staff."}
{"text":"Go here, you won't regret it. The burgers were SO creative and delicious on top of it all. I got the Mac and cheese burger and my boyfriend got the jalapeño popper burger, both were to die for. The sweet potato tots are fantastic too. Don't have anything bad to say, great atmosphere too!"}
{"text":"Greasy. 

Really enjoyed the patio. Would have preferred salad or coleslaw as tater tots were hard. Cool pawnshop next door."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place, the food, the service.  Everyone is friendly.  Bartender remembered my drink upon my second visit without me asking.  I always meet friendly visitors and locals there and everyone is welcome.   Try the sweet potato tater tots and ask for all of the dipping sauces.  They also cook their burgers to order - not over like a lot of places here and the quality of the meat is very good.  It's my Sunday funday place."}
{"text":"In town from the East Coast - trying to find the best eats in the area. Decided to try this place out after seeing the reviews and who doesn't love a good burger.? This place really fell short for me - ordered the bacon cheeseburger - burger was just dry and had no real flavor. Def disappointed."}
{"text":"WATCH YOUR CREDIT CARD. After lunch, the server came by to collect my credit card. She had one other wallet folder (bill) in her hand and walks out of the gate of the business (seated outside) and around the corner of the building an meets a waiting blue van. She has both bills (my card), up in the window of the van with a female driver. Went back in and asked for a manager and a lady came up and said she could help. I said are you the manager, she said no but she has worked here a while and could help. I said I wanted a manager and she said it would be 20 minutes. Then a guy appeared who said he owned the place (Wiley), and said he could take care of the issue, but didn't have a card. I told him the story and he would speak with her. Then he told me that someone maybe forgot their credit card and she was running it out (NO WAY).  No by the owner to take my phone number or for me to get his. Thought it was a poor response from the restaurant owner."}
{"text":"A great true yelp find. I'm from out of state and tried this on a whim, worth every penny. Very good food - enough on the menu if you don't feel like the burger. I had the pulled pork sandwich - amazing! Fast & friendly service as well. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"The food is very fun and creative. 
Portions are large but perfect for when you have that hankering for a nice hardy American meal."}
{"text":"3 stars aka A-OK.

A-OK is exactly how I feel about this place. 

Happy hour ends early at 6:30- (Ra goes 'til 7 and they are practically next door).  Happy hour savings aren't exactly great.  $1 off an appetizer?  Thanks for covering the tax, I guess?

Decor is sort of a beachy stoner motif?  Um...cool?  There's a magazine rack between the stalls in the ladies room?  Um...awesome? 

Food was good, though I only shared some appetizers (fries, tots).  These came with an amusing (and awesome) amount of interesting condiments, which I enjoyed, considering my fridge is 2/3 full of dressings and sauces instead of actual foods. The \"small\" burgers are ginourmous, so that's probably why they don't have such good happy hour food discounts (they can't be making a ton of money on these).

Where this place shines is the service (surprisingly good), beer selection and the music.  Could've sworn they tapped into my iTunes...

I'll probably be back sometime, if friends want to go here."}
{"text":"Sweet poTOToes were amazing, piineapple dipping sauce...oh so good
Philly cheesesteak fries...yummy"}
{"text":"I choose this place because I wanted sweet potato fries. Hubby ordered a chili burger on a gluten free bun with a side of corn, my daughter ordered a Jalapeño popper burger on brioche bun and I ordered a basket of sweet pototoes .  And all of this was to be delivered buy Door Dash.  Door Dash sends a text to say they are out of gluten free buns and brioche buns. So we changed to wheat and pretzel.  The buns came wrapped in the side, burgers and corn was tough and I ended up with chili Fritos instead of sweet potatoes fries. Disappointed!"}
{"text":"Can't miss the sweet potato tots, onion rings, Mac 'n cheese & the Hawaiian burger. Definitely the best place for burgers and all the fixings"}
{"text":"My hamburger was excellent cook just right. The burger was full of favor and the prices are not bad at all."}
{"text":"A nice large list of burgers to pick from although all us of thought they were just OK. Nothing was amazing and nothing was bad. The atmosphere was just like the food, sort of middle of the road. I am not sure we would be back."}
{"text":"I wish we had one of these in the SF area! The burgers are amazing!!!! I have a hard time paying over $10-12 for a burger but these burgers are so so good! Worth it, and the staff and manager are great with attention and hospitality!"}
{"text":"When we got there the line wasn't too bad and we only had to wait about 20min. Ambiance is really chill and fun, good bar selection with decent service.  I got the jalapeño popper burger it was ok, too much cream cheese to burger ratio but the fried jalapeño were amazing."}
{"text":"I ordered a bacon burger in a lettuce wrap. The meat was seasoned perfectly with a great hickory bacon flavor. I do have a gluten sensitivity, and they were very accommodating. Most of their sauces were gluten free except the aioli. Their sweet potato tater tots were delicious!! Definitely recommend this place. Despite the fact that I got a lettuce wrapped burger, they do offer a gluten free bun. If you're looking for a great burger joint this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"Oh burger heaven, how can I ever repay you?

I love my burgers.... and what can I say?? I am impressed... 

The Burger... the POBLANO buger.... man oh man, that burger has the right amount of kick, and the burger itself melts in your mouth... just typing this review makes me want to drive over there and get one. But they have a HUGE selection of burgers you can try, and the option to make your own burger. Get the pretzel bun, you won't be disappointed. 

The Fries... I believe they're called \"Skin-On fries,\" well let me tell you about these fries... They're the perfect balance of soft and crispy, and that mermaid dust... I only dream about it. You're probably asking yourself, \"What's mermaid dust?\" Well my friends let me tell you, its this magical dust that they put on their fries... and it's best flavor you'll ever taste... I can't even describe how perfect it is. Not to mention that it goes great with the spicy ketchup. YUM
The Drink- I got a Dos Equis... and that was only because I was craving it. But I do know that they have a decent selection of beers, and other drinks. They have excellent daily drink specials... and that  is number one in my book. 

The Staff... I would have to agree with some of the previous reviewers, they're not in your face... but they're attentive. And they're up for recommending burgers for you. The service overall was impressive, and VERY quick. Super friendly. 

Will I come back? HECK YES. I might actually head over there right now. :)"}
{"text":"The burgers are amazing. They can make most of them vegetarian and many vegan. The beer list, while not extensive, offers a number of great deals, especially happy hour. The service is quick and friendly, even though they were very busy when we were there. Most recommended!"}
{"text":"The most stars for the Hawaiian vibe; cute fun place.

However,  I don't know what the fuss is about.  Yes there is a pile of Mac and cheese on the burger but that's it?  I personally didn't care for the texture of the hamburger meat.   It was too dense for my taste.   

I'm glad I checked it out but think the ratings are too high given my experience.  

Not to mention they ask you how are things tasting about 10 times while you try to eat.   Tip:  let people enjoy the place don't ask so much!!"}
{"text":"Was starving and came in here for lunch. Cute little beach theme beatnik place. Well...Burger and margarita it was...and did NOT disappoint! Also bartender Cortney was friendly and sweet. I am allergic to high fructose corn syrup. I asked her if she knew what was in the mix. She right away pulled the mix and showed me the label. Quality ingredients and Patron was on special. Oh hell yes! Burger was cooked perfectly and fries were yummy not greasy. It is SO NICE to see a kick back place use QUALITY ingredients. The burger meat is a mix of balanced flavors.  Coming back for sure. Keep it up guys! P.S. the music is perfect mix of beach and mello reggae. Fab. The owner of this business is a genius."}
{"text":"Perfect spot before or after a spring training game seeing the Giants. The sweet potato fries are a perfect compliment to the pulled pork burger. Plus, the vibe is super laid back and is the perfect match for a toasty day in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Holy smokes where do I begin? We were lucky enough to bypass the line and sit at the bar. 
The two bartenders that waited on us were super awesome sweet and chipper. Happy hour is very reasonable with pretty great options. The corn on the cob may as well be called crack on the cob I could have done a dozen.  This mermaid dust they put on everything is bananas good. The pb&j burger on a pretzel roll was indescribably good. Sweet potato tater tots yum!!!!"}

{"text":"Chili cheeseburger was great and prepared just the way I like it.  Good portion size, friendly service and a relaxed atmosphere.  I will go back next time I am in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"My co-worker and I came here during our lunch break. We decided to check it out since it just opened. Their burgers were amazing and their fries have this mermaid dust (which tasted exactly like Lucas). I got the burger with the onion rings and BBQ sauce! I had their smaller burger and it was more than enough! The service was good and atmosphere felt like we were at the beach. There was a TV monitor that looked like they had an aquarium! It was so cute and probably low maintenance. Just remember they are closed on Monday!"}
{"text":"First let me say that I don't think this place is worth the hype.  I had a BYOB today with bacon, hatch chilies, cheese on a pretzel bun with fries.  The meat lacked seasoning, bacon was a little under cooked and I thought that the chilies should have been diced.  The fries were cooked and seasoned well but the two dipping sauces where store bought, kinda lame in my opinion.  I will not be going back to Rehab! 

Food Guy Out!"}
{"text":"A+ service. A+ food. Excellent way to start off out Scottsdale vacation! 

We came at a busy time with a 20 month old who was hungry,  tired,  and cranky from sitting in an airplane and then a car seat for hours. 

Even know there was a wait, they seated as quickly and one of the ladies, who later I found out was Denise, one of the owners, brought out a plate with chopped turkey, ham, cheese, and strawberries for our little one to start munching while we decided what to order.  So kind! 

I had the poblano burger on a pretzel bun with a side of Jamaican corn and my husband had p_b and see a burger on a brioche bun. He opted for sweet potato tots his side. 

The place had several children, but no children's menu. They were so nice to tell us that they could do a variety of different things for the kids and we ended up getting a taco with chicken and cheese for our son. We asked him to please bring it out as soon as possible even if our food wasn't ready yet. They brought it out very quickly and when the bill came, the even said the taco was on the house because they knew how hungry he was and they didn't bring it out fast enough for their liking. 

Such a wonderful place, a wonderful atmosphere, kind people, an excellent food! If this place was in my hometown, I would be there every week."}
{"text":"Not impressed with service at all. While they were very busy and have many good reviews, the place seemed severely understaffed.  We called ahead for reservations - and were told no wait and just to come down. Well, long story short, we got there and ended up waiting another 40 minutes until we decided just to leave.  If you have three hours to kill on a Friday night, then I guess this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Ordered Rehab Burger through GrubHub and was delivered fresh! Everything was fantastic! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Really delicious burgers and sweet potato fries! Kudos for having gluten free buns as well :)"}
{"text":"This place was pretty good, kind of strange servers and my tots were burned, so it doesn't quite make the five star cut.

I had the bacon cheeseburger, with the pretzel bun and cheddar cheese-- it was super delicious and really a big burger so I saved half for an after-drinking snack.

My boyfriend had the MacGnarly burger or whatever it is called, which is a double decker burger smothered in thousand island dressing, and he had it on a brioche bun, which was really good.

The fries were good.

The sweet potato tots would have been better if they weren't burned, and if they gave me some garlic aioli on the side instead of ketchup (sweet potatoes and ketchup? Ummmm no)

I also had a spicy bloody mary and that thing was DELICIOUS!

Parking can be gnarly around there, but if you park in the structure and take the super short hike to Rehab Burger, then you'll be fine.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the BEST burgers in phoenix! The mac n cheese burger is out of this world! The ghost burger will have your taste buds jumping! The decor will definitely keep your eyes busy and the burgers will fill you up! Sweet Potato tots are incredible!"}
{"text":"Went on a Thursday at lunch. Place was busy and it's not that big. Service started out a little slow, but our waiter fixed that by the end of the meal. The Chili con Fritos was a good start. All the burgers were good and the hot dog my daughter got was the best hot dog my wife had ever tasted. Overall a good place to go and get adventurous with your burger."}
{"text":"We brought the Boys' Burger Club here today. I ordered the Ghost Burger with bacon and a side of onion rings. We've been doing the BBC for a while and I can tell you this is the best burger yet. Maybe one of the best I've ever had. Also, the service was magnificent. Looking forward to coming back."}
{"text":"Some of the best burgers around! Not a thing to complain about. Good service, great food. Little spendy but what do you expect in old town Scottsdale."}
{"text":"The food was great, however, when deciding what size burger to get, our watress (knowing I really wanted to try the dessert) suggested the bigger burger. Unfortunately after sharing an appetizer and burger, we were too full for dessert. I also feel like since we didn't want the extra food to go to waste that we over stuffed ourselves and couldn't really enjoy the meal as a result. Some day soon I would like to go back there and get a smaller meal so I can fully enjoy it. Over all the quality of food was great and I LOVED the \"dive bar\" atmosphere!!"}
{"text":"Pretty darn good burgers with the not to be missed sweet potato tots! Happy hour will get you some nice cheap beer too :-)
Friendly service, great ambiance, stop in and you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This place is great!!! Food is awesome and the service is super good everyone was happy.  I had the \"No Poblano\" burger on a pretzel bun.  It rocked.. great paddy, manchego cheese, spicy grilled onions and a Poblano pepper.  If you check in you get a \"Pot Brownie\" sundae for $3.99.  Chocolate brownie stuffed with marshmallow cooked in a pan and topped with ice-cream!!!  Very friendly and helpful staff.

P.S.  Gotta try the sweet potato tots with the Pineapple aioli!"}
{"text":"This is a fun burger restaurant with a beach you atmosphere. Very casual. We sat outside in February. There is an extensive choice of creative burgers. The fries and onion rings were delicious. The service was excellent."}
{"text":"I came here on Saturday 10/14/17. When Asu played Washington. The place was well packed and the atmosphere was upbeat and alive. I ordered some wings which were cooked amazingly and well seasoned. I was a little disappointed about the margaritas and how it did not come blended. My boy friend ordered a burger and did not even eat all of it because it came to us this raw. The only reason I would be back is for the wings and fries."}
{"text":"This has got to be the BEST dang burger I have ever had. You have to be open to trying a new/different type of your regular lettuce/onion/tomato burger. We tried the PB&J and bacon burger and also the spicy mac-n-cheese burger! A MUST TRY!!  The staff was friendly & quick at getting your food out as well. I highly recommend this place. The only thing the could do different, is open one in Tucson, AZ next. haha"}
{"text":"Excellent service and food! It took a bit to seat us as a bunch of friends went together but they were very friendly and accommodating. Our server was very knowledgeable about the menu and did not make 1 mistake. His suggestions were simple - get the pretzel bun and add a fried egg on top of whatever you get. Needless to say, his suggestions were on point and we all had a wonderful experience! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"}
{"text":"Accommodated our large party of 13 on Thanksgiving weekend...great service and amazing burgers!"}
{"text":"Probably some of the best burgers in Scottsdale. I always build my own. Great place to go watch a game, get a beer, and have a burger or just bring your family to dine in."}
{"text":"I came thinking I would get one of the unique burgers offered on the menu. Well I decided to have a \"relapse\" portion of the Mac & cheese and slowly decided to try the Cantina TaCODos (fish tacos). Everything was delicious. I even got a to go order of the fish tacos as well as the chicken wings with spicy pineapple BBQ sauce. I would definitely go if in town again."}
{"text":"I must've come during a group happy hour, at 7pm on a Friday, the crowd was LOUD but quieted down as the group dissipated. I had the Coco Nutty to drink (it's amazing btw, makes you feel like your on a beach) and felt compelled to get the Hawaiian Burger. Burger was great, but the fries were FANTASTIC. They have this chili-lime seasoning that makes the fries so addicting. Needless to say, my plate and glass were completely empty when I left feeling very full and satisfied. Definitely coming here when I need a burger fix."}
{"text":"Another gem in old town I have had all but 4 of the burgers on the menu, and have had nothing but great meals and excellent service!"}
{"text":"The jalapeno popper burger is off the hook. Also, try the Jamaican corn.....so delish!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible. From start to finish, virtually everything was a disaster. 

When we first arrived, we we're promptly seated and given our menus. Our waiter came over a few minutes later to take our drink orders. Upon receiving my drink, I noticed that the glass I was given was dirty. I informed the waiter took it back to get me another one. At this time my wife had ordered a beer as well. I received my beer fairly quickly, but she did not receive hers. We had then reminded him of this, he said he would get on this. 

We then went to ordering. We ordered a quesadilla for an appetizer, two hamburgers with veggie Patty's, and an order of their spicy Mac & Cheese without the bacon. After putting in our order, we reminded the waiter AGAIN that my wife hadn't received her beer. 

The quesadilla had came, and my wife still hadn't received her beer. We did not have an silverware or napkins, so we also asked for these. Finally, my wife's beer had arrived. She ordered a pint of Blue Moon, which usually comes garnished with an orange slices, but there was not one on it. This isn't the most important thing, but was disappointing. 

Our burgers and side of Mac and Cheese came maybe 5 minutes after getting the appetizer. This sounds like fast service, but we were expecting to have more time to enjoy the rest of the appetizer before our burgers came. So now our burgers had to get cold while we finished our quesadilla. I instantly noticed the Mac and Cheese had bacon in it, so we had to send it back. We also noticed that the buns we order on our burgers we're on the wrong burger. At this time we still hadn't received napkins or silverware. 

The waiter finally came back with the Mac and Cheese, and silverware! 

After taking one bite of the Mac and Cheese, we had realized that it was unedible. We had asked the waiter if they microwave their Mac and Cheese, he informed us that they don't, but it really tasted like they did. As far as the burgers go, they did not taste at all what we we're hoping for. For $15 a burger, these we're a HUGE disappointment. 

Overall, I do not think we will ever be back. We would try another location, since they have multiple in the valley, but at this point I would just have to say to AVOID."}
{"text":"The burgers are awesome and the sweet potato tots are even better! They do not have a very good beer selection and my burger always seems to come out overcooked (I request medium rare, always). But I will continue to visit, nonetheless."}
{"text":"OH MY GOD!!!! This place is amazing!!!
I will admit I was skeptical at first. I went on the recommendation of a few friends and when we got there the feel of the place was very laid back and more like a beach atmosphere than I would have expected from a place with part of the name being \"Rehab\".
The menu is very large and the options are plentiful for any palette. Secret... they have an amazing soup that is not on the menu. It is a bit spicy and the ingredients are very non-traditional but it is something you will crave after you have tried it once. I won't tell you the ingredients here... you will have to discover it for yourself!
Oh yeah... did I mention they have awesome sweet potato tots? Those are great with the soup and pair well with any of their burgers too!
Swing on by and try it sometime.. I have been known to show up after a good swim on a Thursday night... maybe I will see you in there! 
Cheers"}
{"text":"Loved this place and the atmosphere!! The Mac and cheese burger really hit the spot! I also suggest getting some nacho cheese on the French fries that come with the burgers! Would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Great food, killer music, good indoor or outdoor seating.  Service was friendly!  Try the chicken and cheese appetizer dip with the fresh chips!  Its amazing!  I will be back next time I visit Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Lots of great burger options! I had the BBQ Burger and Fries. Great lunch spot for a tasty burger!"}
{"text":"This may be the only restaurant where you can order and receive a RARE hamburger with no argument over company policy! That goes a long way with me. The taste of the meat itself is good but not quite as tasty as Red Robin's Angus beef. Two negatives: (1) The wait staff is so crazed serving drinks that they have no time to check on you once your food has been served. And (2) Like What-a-Burger, Rehab also has a strange and annoying FETISH about condiments. Like What-a-Burger, there are no ketchup bottles. Rehab gives you a little cup of ketchup which is not enough. At least What-a-Burger let's you take as many of their silly  ketchup packets as you want. At rehab, the waiters are too busy and the place is too loud to get their attention for more ketchup. Any restaurant manager who refuses to serve ketchup in bottles has a screw loose and should stop the childish nonsense. Do you hear me, Rehab??"}
{"text":"Went with a group of friends from lunch.  Nobody tried the PBJ burger but we all left happy and would definitely go back.  Meat was very flavorful, rehab was a pretty big 10oz portion but cooked perfectly to order, and service and atmosphere were great."}
{"text":"Their burgers are messy and delicious! The PBJ and Bacon burger is unique, but the flavors really compliment each other. Be prepared for that burger to get all over the place. Same with the Mac and cheese burger, delicious and messy. The hatch chile burger was just the right level of spicy! Sweet potato tots are delicious as well. Large portions, delicious burgers!
Note that burgers ordered medium were still pretty pink inside."}
{"text":"We came here on the recommendation of one of the store owners and we enjoyed ourselves. I had the Mac and Cheese Burger and my husband had the Prime Rib burger. The waiter asked me if I wanted the regular size, which I thought meant the smaller size, but it was the bigger one. It was HUGE! The meat was really good and cooked well. The bread was good and didn't fall apart as I ate it. The mac and cheese on it was ok, but was a little bland. It had bacon and green chiles in it, but could have used some salt or hot sauce to flavor it. I got sweet potato tots with mine and really enjoyed them. My husbands burger was also huge, but due to all the toppings, he felt that the meat to bun ratio was not right and his sandwich was left falling apart from not enough bun to hold it all together. Both of us had enough burger left over to take home for dinner. Next time I would order a smaller burger. 

The service was friendly and our waiter chatted with us and provided us with suggestions. The environment was fun. Overall it was a good experience and I would go back again, but I might try something different next time, maybe a spicier burger."}
{"text":"Great bar & fun atmosphere! We shared the porkster burger which was awesome. Good thing we shared it. I couldn't have eaten it by myself. So many more things we want to try. Can't wait to have friends come to town and take them here."}
{"text":"I really liked the burger! The Backyard BBQ burger only whole wheat with onion rings! The meat was high quality and juicy the bun was as good as it gets... onion rings get 5 stars. Service was fantastic"}
{"text":"Burger was good, nice big 10 ouncer with fries. Very pricey, but kinda worth it. Was a bit busy for the lunch rush so the food wasn't gonna come out sizzling. Service was good, bar tender was very kind and polite. It was a good fix. Gives off a Hawaiian/Californian vibe with the reggae music and interior decor. Appealing to the board enthusiast. Gives off the indication that the owner like skateboarding, snowboarding and surfing. Carry a few $20s in yer' pocket because a Heiniken in a bottle will cost you almost $6. Them Cali/Hawaii prices. Maybe when I come back on my next visit my review will be a bit more enthusiastic."}
{"text":"This is a great burger spot, I had trouble deciding between the Hawaiian and the Mac and cheese one, I was very happy with the Hawaiian.. Service was a bit slow at the outside bar top, compared to what people were getting around us, so I'd recommend getting a table if outside or sitting inside.. But everyone was friendly and the burgers delish."}
{"text":"so full it hurts I come not stop eating the burgers are so good I got the ghost pepper it 10oz meat perfectly cook medium super juicy   two slices of ghost pepper cheese and so much guacamole the onion rings are some of the best crunchy and think now the milk shakes are just OK had the orange sickle to sour and and crystals of sugar or something tried the strawberry one the the wife had just OK too tasted like nest quick the server was grate but she had to be super blazed because every thing was super good to her will definitely go back"}
{"text":"I'd heard a lot of people recommend Rehab Burger over the last year and finally got to try it yesterday. It exceeded my lofty expectations. The burgers were huge, delicious, and a great price (especially considering the price of ground beef). Sweet Potato Tots are an amazing thing and I don't know why this is the first time I have heard of them or had them. Beer selection is standard, nothing too exciting, but our wonderful waitress Megan added some shots (with our permission) to our orders that made each drink order unique. Speaking of Megan, she is the most fun and outgoing waitress I have had in a long time.

If you haven't already, go try Rehab."}
{"text":"Stopped in here after reading a few reviews.  When out of town I always want to pick a place for a good damn  burger.   This place did not disappoint.   I had the pulled pork over a burger on a bagel bun.   The thing was off the hook.   I enjoyed  every bit of it.   Sweet potato  tots were lightly fried and very tasty.   Bartender was a cool dood and his recommendations were right on point."}
{"text":"This is my second day here in a row. All I have to say is WOW. First time here I had the Beefstro burger. Absolutely outrageous with Pineapples aioli on the side. The sweet potatoes tots maaaad good. Came the second day and had the Jalenpeno popper burger with the corn. Awesome as well. It's small so you may have to wait but it is so worth it. I'm sure they are going to expand even further. Stop reading my review and place your order."}
{"text":"Fantastic! We ate on a weekday evening. Staff was phenomenal and explained everything to us (gave us free samples). Pretzel buns are amazing. Sweet potato tots with the pineapple-based sauce were very good. Lots to choose from!"}
{"text":"This place is the BEST burger is Scottsdale... I'm also obsessed with the sweet potato tots!"}
{"text":"Ghost burger all the way. Hit the spot. Onion rings are deceivingly filling. This place belongs in Tempe, but I'm not complaining. Good food, friendly staff and chill atmosphere."}
{"text":"This used to a good place but wow the cook doesn't know how to make a burger that isn't rare lol. I had to send my order back twice because both times my burger was bleeding."}
{"text":"Yum I love visiting Rehab burger! These burgers are massive and SO good. I normally do the ghost burger with fresh avocado- it's quite spicy but the taste is awesome. Sub the fries for sweet potato tots & chipotle mayo, you won't be disappointed! The staff is always great and very helpful. Will always be back!"}
{"text":"Have been seeing posts online for a while, and have wanted to give the place a try.  Disappointed to drive from across town to find out their specialty burger has sold out the day before, sounds like poor planning to me.  Anyway, we had the PB&J, Spicy Mac and Cheese and the Calamari.  Wife really enjoyed the PB&J burger, I wasn't as impressed with the Spicy Mac & Cheese.  The mac had a gritty taste, and was served lukewarm, and not the least bit spicy.  The flavor wasn't bad, but it wasn't a $14 burger either.  The calamari was surprisingly good, which is funny because it would seem the burger should be the star and not the appetizer.   Two burgers and a appetizer for $38, to me seems a little steep, but I'm cheap.  Kicker to the whole visit is when I check my bank statement the next day, the upped the bill by $3.  I guess someone wanted a little larger tip than the 20% we paid.  Not sure it's worth driving across town to not get what you want, but I can now say I have been there.

UPDATE: After calling and speaking to the manager, the entire tip amount is being refunded as this was an error on the part of the server."}
{"text":"Really good spot, the sweet potato tots are next level and I love their assortment of sauces you can order to dip them In. I highly recommend the garlic sriracha aioli sauce! They have a ton of burger options as well and my friend got the PB&J burger which was way better than I expected it to be. I however got the bacon and blue burger which I do not recommend. It has the blue cheese and bacon cooked into the burger and that's all. No toppings or sauces so it was really dry! While I like this place I would advise against this burger! Also get the pretzel bun it was the best part"}
{"text":"I'd had Rehab bookmarked on Yelp for awhile and finally got to go check it out this weekend. My friends and I arrived around 1pm on Saturday afternoon and were lucky enough to snag one of the last two open tables. 

We were greeted right away, given waters and informed of their happy hour specials. Yes, you read that right, happy hour on a Saturday! Rehab has HH seven days a week, from 11-6 I believe. I was a little disappointed to see the discounts applied mainly to booze. All appetizers are $1 off, which isn't much, in my opinion. But that didn't deter us from ordering a huge plate of chili cheese fries for the table to share. (And we saved $1, woo!) 

On to the entrees. Us girls ordered burgers, one rare and the other two medium rare. The \"rare\" burger came out med-rare, not really a big deal, but mine and my friend's \"med-rare\" were without a doubt overcooked. Mine came out mid-well, and my friend's came out well done. Mine had just enough juice/pink that I ate it anyway, but my friend sent her dish back. For a place called Rehab Burger Therapy, you'd think the cooks would know their way around a grill and proper temps?! Also, on the menu's description of our food it said our burgers were served with condiments; my Poblano burger was supposed to get spicy ketchup and my friend's was supposed to get a chipotle aioli. Both were absent from our plates and we had to ask for them. Weird. Or maybe I'm just a condiment freak. 

Our server, Devon (sp?), was super nice, funny and energetic throughout our experience. He apologized for the kitchen's mistake and fixed the situation for my friend. 

All in all I'd be back. The pretzel bun I chose my burger to be housed in was delish, and Rehab's fries are slightly addictive. Perhaps I'll try again at a less busy time when the cooks can pay more attention to the grill temps."}
{"text":"The Burgers uniqueness I would give a 5 star too. The quality of burger itself, i would give in-between a 3 & 4 star.
 One thing I was not happy about, on two separate occasions, they were out of several beers on draft. I don't think my situations were luck of the draw, it seems like a management/ordering issue."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Walking by we weren't sure how great it would be but when we came inside at 1:45PM it was packed. We were immediately greeted by a silver fox of a gentleman who cleaned us a spot at the bar. Rian was very friendly and helpful with the menu! He provided great service and could tell he wanted us to have a wonderful experience. 

I ordered the 5oz Mac n cheese burger with a pretzel bun and Mexican corn. OMG....I am so full and it was DELICIOUS! 

We will be back!"}
{"text":"Loved the poblano burger fun atmosphere and terrific wait staff. Keri had a yummy messy salad with carnitas. Langton liked the kids macaroni & cheese."}
{"text":"Listen, if you're in a rush.. Maybe order carry out. You are supposed to enjoy the experience here. We came in on Saturday afternoon. We all want to sit outside, but let's get real, we are HUNGRY. We sat at the bar and had some drinks and the chips and salsa. It didn't blow my mind but it is what it is.. What kind of chips and salsa is really to die for? None.

We eventually were both able to sit at the bar so we decided to dine there. The bartender working was a hilarious brunette who kept us laughing and of course happy. 

I got the hangover burger, my fiancé got the PBJ. The siriracha scared me a bit on the PBJ.

Look at me right now.. (virtually)... GET THE PBJ. It was the most amazing thing I've eaten when it comes to burgers. You won't regret it.

Overall good was amazing, service was great, and we left happy. 10/10 would come back."}
{"text":"I have nothing bad to say about this place. We found it because o the yelp deal. We had the calamari and the quesdaillio which were both delicious! For our entrees I had a Caesar salad and my friend had the chicken sandwich. Huge servings perfect for left overs.

I also have to give a shoutout to our waitress Cheryl from jersey. She was hilarious and always kept my diet coke filled.

The atmosphere is great and the place has awesome positive energy. Will be back soon."}
{"text":"Cool place with fun vibe. My friends ordered PBJ burger and the Mac Narly burger...both said they were great. Then it went off the rails....my Backyard Burger was a no show for about 15 min. Waitress apologized and said someone had touched my burger so the kitchen felt it needed to be redone. While I appreciate not eating something a stranger touched, my friends were completely done when mine finally showed and then....it was cold and overdone. The waitress was cool and adjusted the tab."}
{"text":"Damn good burger, especially if you're nursing a hangover! Huge portions, great food!"}
{"text":"CAUTION: Only eat here if you want to be throughly happy! 

I'm from out of town and found this burger haven on yelp. We started off with the chips and salsa yelp check in offer. The chips has a really good seasoning with a hint of lime. The salsa was fresh, had a good bit to it, thick so it stays on the chip and satisfied that little spot that needed instant filling before our burger! 

After looking at the pictures I decided that it would be best if the other person I was with and I split a burger because we didn't think we could finish one on our own! My assumption was correct. We got the PORKSTER BURGER and it was delicious!! The perfect amount of meat, you definitely get your money's worth. We got the Sweet Potato tots that are extremely addicting!! And the sauces that accompany it are very complimenting. I enjoyed the Chipotle sauce while the person I was with liked the pineapple Teriyaki best. 

The service was excellent. Everyone there was happy, helpful and attentive, which was refreshing! The vibes are laid back and allow you to \"chillax\" which is written on the TV screens of floating fish. 

We will definitely be back! :)"}
{"text":"Love love love this place! Have to go on a regular basis to get my fix! Staff is friendly and helpful. Food is incredible. Cool little joint! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Did not disappoint! Delicious burger and unique sweet potato tater tots. Cold can of Modelo for only  $1.75. Cool place, great vibe, great food and cold beer! I'm sold!"}
{"text":"A friend of mine told me that Rehab Burger Therapy was better then 5 Guys.

Yeah...right.

But I thought I'd give it a try. So my best friend and I went down on a Tuesday afternoon.

What a cute place! It reminded me of a place I bar-tended at in Florida! Very relaxed, reggae on the speakers...awesome! Our waitress was the best! I didn't get her name (and I meant to!) but she was knowledgeable, entertaining, and patient with us...and super fast, though we were there at around 3:30 PM in order to avoid any rush.

I ordered the Know Poblano Burger (Relapse size) on a pretzel bun with the Sweet PoTOToes...it was out of this world!! Cooked to order, in this case medium, and covered in these spicy, grilled onions and a HUGE poblano pepper!! Our waitress brought us each 2 different dipping sauces as well...Spicy Ketchup and Chipotle Aioli. Both were excellent on my Sweet PoTOToes, which are sweet potato tater tots!!

My bestie ordered the Hatch Chile Cheeseburger (Rehab size) on a pretzel bun with the skin on, homemade/cut fries. He LOVED his burger so much I think he bgan a serious relationship with it!!

For dessert (we really ARE pigs!) we shared a Pot Brownie...O...M...G...!!! Two brownies with marshmallow cream in between, baked, and coated with Hershey's Sauce!! It could not have gotten any better!!

This place is a gem! We adored EVERY minute of our time there and we will most definitely be back...as many times as our waist sizes allow!!"}
{"text":"Wundabar!! My friend and I both got the PBJ bacon burger on a pretzel bun and I have been dreaming about it ever since! It was a treat to the tastebuds and so messy it was awesome. I got onion rings and my friend got sweet potato tater tots and both were amazing. Our service was great and our waitress promised is that this burger would change our lives and it did!"}
{"text":"Amazing burgers!! Saw this place on yelp and went there for date night and it was awesome! I got the bacon cheeseburger and my boyfriend got the porkster burger and they were both phenomenal! The bacon was so good & the pork on his burger was absolutely delicious and the perfect hint of spicy! Can't wait to go back soon! Definitely recommend this place!!!!"}
{"text":"Came here alone for a super late lunch. I waited up front for a few minutes before someone finally recognized that I needed to be seated. The place was not busy as I came during a weird time (3:45pm). My server, Kristin, was really attentive. She was informative about the menu and paid attention to when I wanted her to come by. Loved her.
I ordered the spicy Mac n cheese burger with a pretzel bun and sweet potato tots with the spicy ketchup. The options for burger toppings are pretty superb. 
My biggest disappointment was that the food came out at different temperatures. My burger with the Mac and cheese spirals was warm, but my sweet potato tots were cold. How are deep fried sides cold? I ate the burger as is but told my waitress about the tots. I got new tots, and these were hot almost burnt. The spicy burger was not spicy at all. There were a couple of small chunks of chile, maybe, in the Mac n cheese.
Overall, this might have been better had I come at a different time maybe? It was tasty, but kinda disappointing as I keep hearing that it's the best place in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Was visiting Scottsdale on vacation. We were all craving a hamburger and wanted to try somewhere new, so started doing some research of Yelp and found this gem.

Such a cute place, feels like your in Cali! The burgers are delish and the service was great! So glad we came here. We will be back the next time we come to visit Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"My favorite burger place!

I have tried almost every burger and I swear each one is better than the last!

They posted a photo of their meatloaf with mashed potatoes the other day and I cannot stop thinking about how delicious it looks and how I need to get it!

My favorite is to get their sweet potato tots and pineapple dipping sauce! I could probably drink all of their sauces they are so good!

They have the best staff between both of their locations and always play the best music!"}
{"text":"I'm addicted to their burgers and sweet potato tots! 
Their medium wings are delicious!
David is our favorite server!"}
{"text":"This is now my go to spot in Old Town! Came in for the first time today and was alone and in a hurry... Well I sat down and ordered my drink planning on just staying long enough to eat and run.. Then one server sitting down the bar from me was making jewelry, Robin. She was so nice and friendly so we meet and she gave me 2 bracelets made while I was waiting on my food and had an awesome belt she made that I bought right there!! Be sure and ask for her if you like cool and vintage inspired accessories;) she's awesome! So after I meet her I am introduced to almost everyone working tonight, which I think is really cool and makes the visit much more fun;). I met Jon, who was so nice and welcoming also, I believe he is either the owner or manager, and my server was a super cool chick named Chi Chi I believe, at least that's what my recipt said!! She helped me choose what to order and I got the Relapse or smaller version of the build your own burger with sweet potato tots!;) AMAZING! One of the best burgers I've ever had, not too big, perfect for me and those who like a thinner, smaller burger! You can get big ones too! That's the awesome thing about this place, each and every sandwich can be made as the smaller version for us light eaters or huge for those wanting more! Great idea! I hate it when I get a huge thick burger and it's falling off the bun and just feels like trying to eat a brick... Not here! You choose between 3 buns, pretzel, wheat, and I believe brioche.... Wheat was perfection! I loved the peach margarita that my bar tender made, and we talked a bit and later she brings me a glass of what looks like a milkshake with whipped cream on top and says to try this and tell her if I like it... I was a little nervous because that can either go really wrong or really right, but it was great and sweet of her to bring me free desert;). It turned out to be a Fireball milkshake!!! I hate Fireball but this was really good! It was really nice to meet so many of the staff, and they were so nice and said I need to be a regular since I live walking distance away:) I think I will do just that! My favorite place in Scottsdale for sure so far!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is such a fun environment and the burgers were amazing. Our server Kaye was so helpful and knowledgeable. I can't wait to come  back again because there are many burgers I want to try."}
{"text":"PUT. THAT. BURGER. IN. YOUR.MOUTH! Lost a * for no guac on the menu.. but I ordered the BYO (build your own) Hot Dog w chili, cheese n chicago relish; hubby got the Hash Burger on a pretzel bun. Did I mention the Sweet PotaterTots and Adult Milkshakes?! Get your discerning Snobsdale ass over there!!"}
{"text":"It was hot and humid inside and the communal bar top seating may it awkward to catch up with friends on a Sunday afternoon. The food was alright, but I will try another place before I return to Rehab for a burger fix."}
{"text":"Rolled out of bed on an idle Sunday afternoon, and my head felt like someone hit it with a hammer. I must have had a few more brews than normal the night before, and I felt a hunger for something different. I worked my way through Yelp, and found this place. We drove to old town, and parking was easy to find for this location. It was busy, but we got seated right away. There are an assortment of wild burgers on the menu, and the one with \"Hangover\" in the title was calling my name. After ordering, the food took a good 25 minutes to come out to us. We ate, and the burgers were ok, slightly under seasoned in my opinion. Fun little place to try, but I doubt I'll make my way back again."}
{"text":"So I needed to go try out the most ridiculous burger I could and this was the place. You know what, it is more of a kids place than not on one hand, and yet again it is not due to full bar and higher quality/prices. 

So the whole party was adventurous, but I went with the PB&J burger Rehab Size w a side of onion rings. So it came in, and I have pictures, and I was impressed. Now the PB ran down the sides and invited for a messy meal, so I went for it with knife and fork as a proper European. It was good. I mean, it was interesting on a novelty level. The peanut butter was powerful, and the jelly kinda just provided a sweet tone. The burger itself was amazing and the pretzel bun was stellar. The 5 massively onion rings was a little disappointing at first, but they delivered. They were huge - in my opinion a little too big actually. I mean it looks great, but the onion becomes slightly underdone this way and provides the crunch to a thick breading. But back to the burger. This place can cook burgers for sure. It was a big meal. I was full all night on this one burger - I didn't even finish all my onion rings. 

I will come back here, for the burgers alone - but then I will go for something else. PB&J burger was interesting but will never become a staple. So burger was a hit, the onion rings were not my style. Too big. Fries were good though. And everybody was happy with their burgers. 
 
Our waitress was cute and personable. She gave her opinion on food and drinks when asked for it, which is something I really like. But besides that she was quite confused. She mixed and matched up orders on the bills, and then she lost a credit card - but found it again. Just one of those things that doesn't impress."}
{"text":"Holy cow!! This place is simply magnificent! The burger was over the top and delish. Their burger choices vary from the expected to some crazy combinations. I mean... A PB&J burger with bacon & siracha???  Whaaaaaat??? I will certainly return, and I think I just may try that PB&J!!! Give an idea how awesome this place is? To get a table had a 30-minute wait at 2:00 on a weekday!! Be sure to get Kaye at the bar, she is fantastic!"}
{"text":"Possibly the best bacon cheeseburger I have had this decade! Nice cool Blue Moon beer on draft to wash it down.  Restaurant was clean.  Wait staff effecient and courteous."}
{"text":"This place is my new all time favorite!! Amazing food, atmosphere, and service!  They have every burger creation that you can imagine and the quality is excellent.  I haven't had one thing on the menu that wasn't good!  I hope they open a Rehab Burger Therapy in Gilbert! I recommend the PB and J burger, and the Pig Wings as an appetizer."}
{"text":"Spicy mac and cheese burger. Nuff said.

Seriously though, this place is delicious. They have a lot of great options, from salads big ass burgers and turkey sandwiches. I've tried the Japaleno Popper burger, Spicy Mac and Cheese burger, and the Veggie burger. All were very good, but I'd recommend getting some spicy sauce to go with the veggie burger, it's a little plain if you have a zesty palate."}
{"text":"Really good.  My wife has the fish tacos, I had the bacon cheeseburger.  Quality was excellent, portions huge, price reasonable."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The peanut butter and jelly burger seriously might be my favorite burger of all time. The sweet potato tots on the side are to die for. Their dipping sauces are all awesome as well. Such a great place and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Was hoping for more. Had the Ghost burger. Was expecting something more spicy. Burger itself didn't have much flavor or seasonings. Guacamole also didn't have much flavor. Everything was just very average for me. 

We also tried Mac n cheese with bacon and it was pretty good but still average."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing burger. I tried the Hatch Chili Burger and it was perfectly cooked. The Sweet Potato Tater Tots were an excellent side. 

I highly recommend any burger lover to try this place."}
{"text":"I have dreams when I am out of town about the Cuban here...I realize how ridiculous that sounds but I literally crave it. The service here has always been top notch and they have great drinks. You really do have to try it once and then you will be like the rest of us.....5 pounds heavier because you keep coming back! The burgers are amazing too, cooked to perfection."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers in downtown Scottsdale.  Hangover is a must. Enjoyed the music, misters and service. If you're not in the mood for a burger try the taco trio with fish, pork and chicken. The spices they use make you thirsty for a beer or two. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Service was slow and the burger came out on a soggy bun.  Asked for a fresh bun but took forever so ended up just eating the meat.  Also, the place was super hot.  Everyone at our table was sweating.  Maybe they were just having a bad night but I wouldn't go back to this place after this experience."}
{"text":"Great food great vegetarian options food came hot and fresh love the Frys and tots come here off hours to avoid busy times"}
{"text":"Horrible experience a few weeks ago with bad and slow service and them throwing a fit because my aunt wanted a different bun. Will NEVER be back to this location. The one in downtown Scottsdale is much better!"}
{"text":"Fantastic Food and Service! The Mac and Cheese burger is the best!"}
{"text":"Yummy! Definitely a place to share food. Perfect time to try something different."}
{"text":"This place never dissapoints. 

Big portions,lots of flavors! Staff are always friendly and ready to help.


Great job guys."}
{"text":"Want a fun burger that you can't get anywhere else? Here we are. 

PB&J on deck with an extra patty to boot. Sweet potato Fries on deck. The look on your face when they bring this monster to you - and it actually tastes amazing? 

Ya. I came back."}
{"text":"Excellent service! Food was great! Nice laid back atmosphere. Don't have anything negative to say! I had the hangover burger with half fries and half sweet potato tots. They came with a few sauces that were good."}
{"text":"Expensive and One hour waiting time but told only 30 minutes and then took nearly 50 minutes for 4 burgers and 1 hotdog to go to the table. I will not be back. The waiter was not friendly either. Not a good experience and was really expensive. Food is ok but not special."}
{"text":"This place is really cool. Definitely a fun coastal vibe about it. My love of burgers brought me here. Initially we had about a 15-20 minute wait. The hostess seemed very distracted or overwhelmed with something so probably could have been seated within minutes of getting here. I had the PBJ burger with sweet potato tots and it was pretty amazing. Definitely saving this as one of my go back to places."}
{"text":"Love this place, you will NOT be disappointed!!! Great food, fun vibe and awesome service!!!"}
{"text":"The closest your gonna get to Kuma's Corner of Chicago. The burger was incredible. Not only is it 10oz. but it's affordable and perfectly cooked. I got the chili burger which is no joke. Pretzel bun all the way. Chili was real freaking good too. Rehab has the best burger in Arizona."}
{"text":"The burgers here are excellent and so are the sweet potato tots.   They are especially good with the sauce they serve them with.  I tried the jalapeno popper burger, which was fantastic.  The burger itself is so flavorful and there are so many options to top it with.  Will definitely be back to try others."}
{"text":"Come here with a ravenous appetite because you will definitely be served a nice hefty burger! 

We came to this beach-themed restaurant on a Sunday around noon. It was already buzzing with hungry rehabers. Wait time was only 15 minutes and we were seated at a communal table bench which is always fun!

We ordered calamari and mac n' cheese to start. The calamari was very heavily breaded, almost like fried fish sticks, but our friend loved them. The rehab sized mac n' cheese was delicious, but we could not even finish half of it between 3 people. I can't even imagine how big the relapse size is. I split a pretzel bun Hangover Burger and just half was a nice hearty and heavy meal for one. But because the slab of meat is thick, the inside wasn't as juicy as I hoped it would be. French fries and the tots were pretty standard. Overall, a pretty decent experience. 

If you're hungry, Rehab Burger Therapy will definitely get the job done! :)"}
{"text":"Went to rehab for a burger with the family. There is ample parking next to the restaurant in a public parking garage which is easy.
We opted for burger (what else) and took the mac-n-cheese and mac gnarly burgers. I had the sweet potato tater tots as a side.
The burger was super delish - cooked to order, full of taste in patty and fresh toppings and a great bun. The tatter tots were also great were sweet and well flavored.
Service was attentive and prompt.

Overall - super yummy w good service. I'm hooked. Will be back every time I'm in town."}
{"text":"I love the burgers here! I had the spicy Mac and cheese burger and it was heaven on a plate. I love the atmosphere at this restaurant as well. Would recommend to anyone and have recommended to many. Will definitely return in the future!"}
{"text":"I love it I have tried three different burgers with sweet potatoes tots all delicious had a margarita Corona drink in honor of Cinco De Maya at Rehab the service is amazing they aim to please you must come by and enjoy the moment Alice Gibson  PS they said the peanut and jelly burger is to go bananas for top seller but I did like the Gost Burger it rocks!"}
{"text":"Everything was amazing. Food incredible, service great, and good beer selection. If your in town, you MUST go here."}
{"text":"OMG!!! First and last stop on our trip to Arizona. Fun environment, great staff - and crazy good burgers.

We knew we were ordering too much - but we couldn't resist. The burger combined with the ribeye, cheese and poblano chilies, accompanied bye sweet potato tarts and onion rings accompanied by a beer and a glass of wine.

Winner, winner - chicken dinner!!!"}
{"text":"One of the best burgers I've had perfect cooked to my taste and I had the ghost pepper burger with ghost pepper cheese. The burger was spicy of course lol but it wasn't too bad I enjoyed it. My lady had a lettuce wrapped jalapeno popper burger and that was too. The food was really good the place was a nice cali surfer beach style spot and I loved it. The margaritas were good as well. The only reason i don't five it more stars is because of the long wait to get served. We sat at the bar to avoid a long wait and still at the bar it took a really long time to get a menu then to get our drinks and even longer to get our order taken. It was Friday afternoon there was a good size friend but the wait was kinda crazy even for old town. Definitely a place I'll go to earlier or during the week to beat the crowd and get better service."}
{"text":"Delicious!!  By far, the peanut butter, jelly, and sriracha burger is my favorite but all of them are amazing!  I also love the sweet potato tots with all the various aiolis.  Hands down my favorite place to get a burger in Old Town."}
{"text":"On our way to Dodgers spring training we decided to stop at this popular spot, it was a great choice indeed! Menu options with fun names: gourmet burgers (10oz or 5oz)/sandwiches/pasta/salads and dessert. We tried the P&J burger/Meatloaf burger/Philly cheese burger/Tony Montana sandwich.  The burgers are HUGE & come with regular fries or sweet potato tots. Tip: skip fries & go for tots....YUMMM YUM! The sandwich is a black forrest ham with pulled pork on overly toasted bread (sigh), but still pretty good. We left very stuffed & satisfied. I'd like to go back & try other items, overall food is pretty good!"}
{"text":"Okay i've only been twice but everytime has been awesome! Right behind RNR and everytime I go they have an awesome bar and waiting staff! You can't go wrong with their burgers or sweet potatoe tots! Warning Rodrigo Da Vinci salad is the most unique and awesome tasting salad i've ever had! It is always busy which tells you something and the people are all around my age also seen some pi phi shirts inside that I had no complaints about haha definitely a must go!"}
{"text":"Great experience and delicious burgers.  My wife's was BYOB but I took the plunge and went for the Porkster Burger.  Wow!  Will visit again next time in PHX."}
{"text":"Best burgers in the valley, best frozen margarita in the valley, with a fun and relaxed vibe. This is one of my new favorite spots."}
{"text":"Awesome vibe, comfortable casual, delicious burger topped with pork!!! Great/friendly bartender(Courtney) made the night even better. Overall great experience."}
{"text":"Best burgers in town and reasonably priced! Good service too. Try the Know Poblano Burger.....Its wonderful! Be ready to wait though, the place is not huge, but has a lot of people who love it. I've been sat right away and been waiting 45 minutes depending on what time you go."}
{"text":"PB&J Burger, Thank me later :) A very cool, laid back restaurant with a creative menu.  I am a burger fanatic and Rehab is a must try!  The service was very friendly, they have a full bar and I've tried burgers with peanut butter before, but never with jelly and I must admit, the jelly takes it to new heights.  My kind of place - casual, fun, friendly and unique menu items.  BOOKMARK it!!"}
{"text":"Ordered medium burger and it was on the medium rare to rare so I ate half. The waitress was nowhere to be found. She was either dancing in the kitchen and chatting with coworker's at the bar. Still tippped her 30% only because I was a waitress in my college days but she didn't deserve it and she was old enough to know better for good customer service"}
{"text":"This place helped me get over my double cheeseburger addiction and after 2 weeks I was a vegan"}
{"text":"Popped into Rehab Burger after a busy shopping day at Fashion Square.  We arrived for an early dinner and were immediately seated.  The decor inside is cute... definitely surfer/California vibe.  I like it.  It was a bit hot inside... could have used the AC turned down a notch or two.  Service was great... our waitress offered her recommendations and was very friendly/helpful.

The burgers were great... messy, but great.  I had a standard cheese burger with thousand dressing (I don't remember what it was called).  It was fab... everything you'd want in a burger.  The Hubs had a burger with pulled pork on top.  He ate every bite and was in 7th heaven.  Both of us felt our sides were pretty cold... fries for me and tots for him.  They would have been much better hot, but they were still pretty good.

We were able to get some beers on happy hour, which was great.  We will surely hit this place up again.  Next time, I want to try that pot brownie... sounded delish."}
{"text":"Got a PBJ &  Bacon Burger since they were out of the Mac and Cheese burger special. The PBJ burger was well cooked, the PBJ was a different combo but enexpectedly tasty, I would get it again. The sweet potato tots and the dipping sauce were a nice change from the usual fries and ketchup.

The downside to the restaurant was the wait. We were seated in under 5 minutes, but after that we waited almost 45 minutes from seated until our food finally showed up! There were people seated after us who got their food before and the same time as us. Not sure what the big hold up was.

TL;DR - tasty food, long wait. I'm not sure it was worth a 45 minute wait."}
{"text":"While we were definitely coming during a lunch rush, the total time for full service was definitely a bit longer than I would expect of what is ultimately still a burger joint. 

Our total time from the moment we sat down, at the bar till the time we left was approximately 1hr. That was for 2 burgers & 2 waters. 

The burgers were quite good, and filling. Portion were not overly large, but still large enough to leave me completely full. The sweet potato tots were moist on the inside and crisp on the outside."}
{"text":"It's definitely 5 stars for the food, but 3 stars for the service. I don't know if it was because of the weekend, or because they were supper busy but the service wasn't good. On the other hand, the food is AMAZING!!! We enjoyed every single dish and every single bite.

Overall the place is really good."}
{"text":"A gem in old town!!!

This was a roll of the dice tonight. We wanted a burger and we were around Scottsdale. It came up on Yelp with great reviews.

My only complaint is that there is not one closer to my home in QC.  

The food was great!! Burger cooked perfect.  Had an appetizer of the Pig Wings.  A must!! They would be a great Happy Hour order. 

In the mood or a burger and don't want the standard fast food, don't let the Old Town Scottsdale scare you away from trying this place!!

BTW... The owners are the same owners as Oregano's Pizza..."}
{"text":"Really good, but be careful. They have two size burgers, and if you don't specify, guess the one you get? The big one. Even with a big appetite this burger was TOO big. Get the smaller one (5oz.) plenty big and cheaper unless you are REALLY REALLY hungry. 

Also note, other than fries, the sides cost extra, but the side salad was pretty big. Overall prices were a bit high, even for Scottsdale, and the reviews for the sweet potato tots were not good at my table. Also service was friendly but also slow. On the plus side, they split our bill without even asking. I would go back, but definitely get the smaller burger, and stick to the side salad or coleslaw."}
{"text":"Aside being out of the pretzel buns, everything was really good. We purposely went for the pretzel buns, and was disappointed to find out they were all out by 7:00 pm."}
{"text":"This place has a great atmosphere.  This place has A great variety of burgers and beverages.   Is a great place to have some food and some beverages and a good conversation."}
{"text":"Amazing! PBJ Bacon burger and Spicy MAC n Cheese Burger. Seriously best ever. Great waitress too! Atmosphere was pub like with indoor or outdoor seating. Fair prices. The 5 oz burgers were plenty and I actually put some in a to go box for midnight munchies. 
Don't know if any other burgers could top them, but from what we saw passing by on plates, I'd be willing to find out!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, lots of locals frequent here. I had the cobb salad and hubby had the blue burger and food was delicous! Look forward to coming back when we are back in town."}
{"text":"This was a surprising find...newly opened in a location of several other restaurants, this place has great food at reasonable prices. Offering both 10oz and 6oz burgers, along with a complete menu. The burgers were great. Prepared exactly as ordered, mine med-rare. They offer set burgers, plus, a build your own option. The fries were first rate, fresh and hot. The atmosphere is fun. The staff was efficient and friendly. They offer both patio and inside dining. I would definitely go back..."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely incredible. I'm seriously considering trying to find a week in Phoenix just so I can try more of their fantastic burgers. The fries are also amazing, and even the pickle here was good, something I almost never enjoy. It's a laid back and unapologetic vibe, serving up probably the best burgers I've ever tasted. Don't miss it!!"}
{"text":"So a friend introduced me to Rehab. burger when I came to visit Scottsdale and she couldn't stop talking about the PB&J burger and sweet potato tots. At first I was skeptical at the sound of such a burger but then decided since I love beef and also love PB and J and let's be real, who doesn't love sweet potato tots, that I would give this burger a try. The Burger was Amazing! It was cooked to perfection and blended well with the PB and J and oh I forgot to mention, Siracha! The burgers we ordered were ready in a timely fashion and the service there was great. The menu had many great options, and was very fairly priced. Would definitely recommended Rehab Burger to all my friends."}
{"text":"Amazing place!!! Highly recommend! Amazing manger Phil, and great service!!! Everyone is super nice!!!"}
{"text":"GREAT FOOD!! Great service!! Relaxed atmosphere/bar setting. I had asked the waitress what was good and she praised the PB&J bacon burger on a pretzel bun, so I ordered it with with sweet potato tots, it was good but def have to love pb&j to enjoy it, next time I'd say light PB! The tots were great! My husband ordered the Ghost Burger, BEST BURGER EVER!!!! I can't even!!!! The grill taste of the patty and oh the CHEESE!!!! He had onion rings with his, they were huge. We're from Texas and LOVE hot and spicy food, I got the chips and salsa and it was HOT and the chips were so crispy and yummy!!! We would def eat here again!"}
{"text":"I can't believe the negative views on here about this place. Came here mid-day and sat outside. This place offers tons of choices on burgers. I had the Spicy Mac-N-Cheese burger and it was too die for. While it was messy, after you cleaned up the sides of the burger you were able to cut it in half and eat it without it falling apart. I would definitely come back to this place next time on vacation."}
{"text":"Sooooo..... We had the chips and verde chicken to start and that was the shizz!!! I had the macaroni and cheese burger and my husband had the pb&j burger!! Both were super yummy and very filling for 5oz. Our server Laura was on point and most friendly! We will be back for sure!!!"}
{"text":"Always a wait. Honestly the place should be bigger they could just buy out the pawn shop next door and open the place up a lot more. There is a queso bean dip that is outstanding! Best thing there."}
{"text":"Any time I'm in town I go to this place now. Their menu selection is really awesome! I ate the PB&J with bacon burger my first time here, and don't let the description fool you, it was awesome! They usually have good beers on tap too. The wait staff was SUPER knowledgeable on everything from what extra sauce goes great with every burger, and even what dressing is best with what! A must if you're in the mood for a great burger!"}
{"text":"Great place.  Been there twice and will go back again.  Try the peanut butter and jelly hamburger."}
{"text":"I was going to go with 2 stars but since in the past I have been here several times as this used to be one of our favorite burger places.   I am so disappointed in our entire order of food.  I took my family from out of town bragging about how good their burgers are. Boy I was shocked at how downhill the food has gone.  The burgers were dry and unflavored.  I had to add salt which I hate doing.  I ordered the chili burger, super bland.  The fries were not fresh. My niece ordered a turkey burger and they brought a vege burger. My nephew ordered no tomato and they brought him tomato. They didn't bring his onion for a very long time, service slow and it wasn't busy at that point. Plus he told them he has a tomato allergy.  Brownie is super hard and dried out and the pineapple dessert tastes awful.  I'm super disappointed."}
{"text":"We were in the area and I wanted a burger, so I checked Yelp and I found this great burger place that had great reviews. Now that I ate here, I know why..... The burgers are cooked to order, which is something I haven't gotten in a while. We sat at the bar and the bartender was friendly and informative. A glass of red wine and a delicious burger is perfect on a Friday night. This place is hopping tonight.
Good food and fun atmosphere. Highly recommend it!
We will be back."}
{"text":"Had the Veggie Noogie was really good and the Sweet Potato Tots were good as well. Food was a little slow getting out, but I would come back and try more off the menu."}
{"text":"Well, I thought I had walked into Hooters.  The waitress was showing off all her goods, as were the other two.  One was pregnant with shorts on and the other was obviously a mother.  Funky decor was fun, food was average. In Rehab people should wear more clothes.
Ordered burger medium and it was rare, service was good- if you could keep your eyes off Hooters in training."}
{"text":"Great food.  Great service.  THIS is how a burger is supposed to be cooked and taste. If you come here and order a Veggie burger OR eat your burger cooked Well Done, please skip this place and patronize McDonald's. Had the Jalapeño Popper burger w/ sweet potato tots. Awesome.  Anyone who rated this place less than 3 stars must be a high maintenence P.I.T.A!"}
{"text":"First time in today and we had a fantastic experience! The food was great. I highly recommend the PB&J burger. The service was even better! It's hard to find good service now a days but the manager, Michael made us feel so welcomed and made sure we had everything we needed. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Ate there last night, excellent burger and salad. Even better service and the beers were cold"}
{"text":"duh Y do you answer every booties questions on dee Facebook just not mine yo'lo? sum lee. i hee the fut is gut here but i have de questions yo'lo"}
{"text":"I don't think I have ever had a more enthusiastic server in my life.
A short brunette helped my girlfriend and I out, and obviously loved her job.
The burger I got was huge and delicious.  The fries and tots were great, too.
The patio was perfect on such a beautiful day.  
This is a great spot to relax with a burger/sandwich and beer.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I am definitely a burger snob as funny as that sounds. That being said, I know Arizona is not known for its food, it is very hard searching for an amazing place to eat out that is also consistent. I found some ok and above average burger places like delux and zin burger, both very good but Rehab Burger holds the crown hands down. 

My only complaint ever is the wait times can be that of were ancient asian meditation techniques are required to contain the hunger wrath from the scent emanating from the kitchen, that place gets PACKED. 

My absolute favorite is the McKnarley Burger with a side of onion rings - you must try this!

I can't wait to try the other locations, the location in Tempe now offers Yelp cash back at 5% to that place is locked and loaded in my crosshairs.

Excellent job from the service staff and chefs! 5 times over and not one let down. Keep it up!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend took me here for the first time today. So I'm one of those people who likes his meat well done lol trust me people I know I here it everyday that you loose all the flavor when it's well done but that's how I like it. Nevertheless I ordered my burger well done and when I received it it was medium at best I'm not one to complain so I didn't say anything and I ate it. Wasn't bad but I would still rather it been well done still a great place"}
{"text":"You know it's the best when you wake up craving a Jalapeno Popper Burger. I'm headed there now because it is just that amazing."}
{"text":"Great little spot in old town Scottsdale!  We went there midday and the wait was quite long (~30 minutes).  It's so tiny that we had to wait outside...thankfully, the Arizona heat had not hit its high since it was only about 100 degrees.  At any rate, we finally got it and was worth the wait.

The service was great, the loud atmosphere fun, and the food was yummy.  Our waiter was very attentive and quick the get ice cold waters and even colder beers.  He made his recommendations and we did not oblige.  We ordered our style of burgers...in true LA fashion :/  They made us our burgers as requested and we were happy.

Will definitely stop again on a future visit!"}
{"text":"Best sweet potato tots in the world and the burger with Mac and cheese on it? Epic! Great bar and patio seating that's pup friendly!"}
{"text":"Good vibes all around at Rehab! I loved the atmosphere of the beach bar, decorations were spot on. The service was ok. Our waitress was decent - she kept the drinks full and always asked how we were doing when she walked by. She seemed a tad stressed, but rightfully so as she was also helping a table of around 20 people. I was craving mac and cheese, and decided to go for it on the mac and cheese burger. DELICIOUS! The fries, burger - everything! Definitely planning to come back and experience the food again!"}
{"text":"Great burger joint.  Party of six and we all had something different . The two best burgers (my opinion) were the bleu burger and the bbq burger. Big portion sizes and friendly service."}
{"text":"I had the best burgers here.  So good I went back the next day.  Very nice place.  I have been there twice and ordered the same burger because it was so good.  It was the bacon and blue cheese burger.  The second time I was there I also ordered the sweet potato bites.  So good.  I know I will go again and promise myself to order a different burger.  The atmosphere is amazing.  The music is also great.  Service was good.  It is a very nice place to have great food and a great time with your friends."}
{"text":"They all know me at the bar. Save today no one has ever rubbed me the wrong way.  The pb&j burger is amazing. I always come back"}
{"text":"Rehab Burger is one of my favorite burger places in the valley. The food is delicious, the staff is friendly, and the environment is inviting. I have been to the Scottsdale location as well and everything is the same. The only reason why i did not give this a 5 Star is because I requested to have no jalapeños and green chilies on my Mac N Cheese burger, and the waiter gave my another customers Mac N Cheese hamburger with the green chilies still in it. To be honest it was not that big of a deal and the place was not busy at all."}
{"text":"I had a wonderful experience here ! The staff was friendly and welcoming. For food I got the Mac n cheese hamburger and boy was there a lot of Mac n cheese on it, but it was delicious!"}
{"text":"Everything tasted delicious. Staff went out of their way to accommodate us. Cook sent out some avocado and pineapple for our baby. Female bartender was a sweetheart. Waiter was awesome. We will be back."}
{"text":"GO HERE!!!  Great vibe, great veggie bean burger you can change the toppings on to any of the regular veggie options.  I love this place, the bar is great. bartender is nice! Thanks girl"}
{"text":"Ate here after 3 months of hardcore dieting and I couldn't have made a better choice to expand my waistline. Ended up with the pulled-pork burger but was really debating the mac & cheese situation. Had to eat my food with a fork and I was all delicate and soft and small after 3 months of salads but I managed to put that delicious wreck down into my gut. So amazing. 

Boyfriend go their weekend special, the Elvis. It sounded really awful, being topped with a Hershey Bar, Reeces Cup, and like peanut butter &  jelly... but it was stinkin' great. Holy fricken cow. 

Drinks are waaay expensive (weeak Coronaritas) but honestly you wonder why you even got a drink as soon as they put the food down... no room for beer!"}
{"text":"I've been trying to get over to this place since we moved to Arizona 2 years ago. Finally I convinced my wife to go because it was Father's Day. I was not disappointed.

Starting off I think the beach bar was fun and not over the top with the surf boards and Tiki bar decor. I noticed a very reasonably sized bar right when we walked in which is very convenient if you just want drinks and a little food.

The place was packed and we only had to wait a bit because all the low tables were in use and we had someone in a wheelchair with us. It wasn't too long of a wait and the food would have made a longer wait worth it.

I'm a beer snob so the selection was pedestrian at best but their specialty drinks and hard liquor selection makes up for the lack of high end beers (I didn't show up for the booze though).

We ordered the pig wings appetizer which were melt in your mouth good. We ate the appetizer so fast that the timing for the main entree seemed long but was, in reality, reasonable. 

I ordered the spicy mac n cheese 10oz burger and fries with the pretzel bun. My first thought when the plate arrived was that the food pics I've seen match the grandeur with which I was presented. Also, my burger was cooked medium which may be too much. Next time medium rare (and I usually like meat well done). I also think that the 5oz option is more sensible unless you are 20 years old and really hungry. The fries with the chipotle ranch were cooked well and complimented the whole meal ( I didn't have that \"I loved the burger hate the fries experience I was expecting\"). There was even a huge tasty dill pickle spear served on the side.

The service was great. The only oddity was how soon our server asked how things were. Just so they know you don't need to ask how things are when you have such epic creations. The service was so much better than what I've experienced in many other restaurants in Arizona and that alone will keep me coming back. 

The next burger on my list will be the PB&J with Sriracha."}
{"text":"Great Burger place. Good service and great food. Hard to beat. Popular and can get very busy. So be prepared to wait. It`s worth it."}
{"text":"Sorry, this is a tad late!

I met up with a good friend recently to hang outside and have a burger...since I only have 3-4 a year, it's kind of a big deal.  This place is tiny with a great patio and horrible parking but that is a minor hassle that ended up being worth it.

We got seated and began looking at the menu.  My friend is cutting a lot of things from her diet and was able to get a GF bun.  She was happy that the staff was able to recommend some things she COULD get.  Our waiter was fabulous that way!

I love 1000-Island burgers but Rehab doesn't have that sauce so I opted for fish tacos instead, with a side of sweet-potato tots.  OMG, they were heavenly!  The order was huge so I took them home and had leftovers for a week.  The tacos were great but messy.  

We had a lovely time visiting with our neighbors at the next table and I noticed a lot of first-timers and was able to compare notes with them and even share some tots.  All seemed happy with the ambience and food, which says a lot about Rehab's menu selections.

The prices were very reasonable, which is always a reason to go back.  I could make a meal out of the tots alone and will become a regular when I can get a cheeseburger with 1000-Island.  Remember, it's a big deal!"}

{"text":"Got to try the pb&j bacon burger , so good.. I was impressed and have to give them the #1 ranking now and did tuckered goes to #2"}
{"text":"If you've been around Scottsdale for a while you might remember Pischke's Paradise which was a casual, beach theme, Jimmy Buffett, style restaurant where you could go without having to feel like you were in \"Snobsdale\". Rehab has that same vibe, although it focuses almost exclusively on burgers and doesn't have the same menu selection that Pischke's had.

However, the burgers are really good, so that makes up for it. If you're really hungry, get the Rehab size burger and if you're not so hungry get a Relapse. However, either way, get a side of sweet potato tater tots to go with them and you'll thank me later.

Service is fast and friendly, seating is ample, and there's rarely a wait to get a table. If the weather is nice, go ahead and sit on the patio. But most of all, just relax, rehab, and have a great time."}
{"text":"This place is great!!! The customer service is fantastic and the food is great. I bring any friends visiting out of town here and they're always impressed. Also rian was our waiter this last time and he was great"}
{"text":"Rehab Burger has time and time again given me great tasting burger combinations with wacky toppings that I enjoy. Everything I've had here is flavorful yet very distinct from other burger joints - not an uncommon cuisine by any means - with reasonable pricing and a cool vibe.

I like the environment, with the chill surfer decor. With tables and high tops it doesn't feel crowded at all. Although I find it extremely difficult to fit large groups - most tables are arranged for a size of 4. I just eat here with a couple friends so not my concern.

Back to the burgers - fantastic. They have innovative toppings like the PB&J Bacon Burger with sriracha and Ghost Burger with ghost pepper jack. Ghost's my favorite, and the pepper jack is definitely elevated compared to jalapenos but not like sign-a-waiver hot.

My favorites here have been off the menu specials. They have a Mac and Cheese Burger with hatch chill M&C pouring off the patty - twice the radius of the burger itself. And the weekend burger that's essential egg's benedict on a burger. 

Get me a 10 oz Rehab size of any of those with my sweet potato tots and I will always leave super satisfied."}
{"text":"This is a great spot for lunch in Scottsdale. It's conveniently located with free public parking next door. We arrived a little before noon on a Friday and the place was already jammed. Definitely worth the wait . Beer at happy hour prices available at lunch was a first for me! The burgers were awesome. The small was pretty sizable and the pretzel roll fresh and delicious. A  crunchy pickle and sweet potato nuggets or fries came with. The nuggets with a pineapple teriyaki aioli were very, very tasty! And the service was great. Our waitress ( from Wisconsin ) was friendly and quick, great combo when your in a hurry!"}
{"text":"Yep...this was yummy stuff folks.

We had supper here before heading to The Sugar Bowl for youngest son's first birthday celebration.

Our crew started with the Pig Wings. Mine is a family of carnivores and they were all super happy with these little pork nuggets. I tasted them and they were so good! Very tender and the sauce was amazing.

We all had burgers or some sort. We had the smaller sized burgers since we were headed for ice cream next and they were more than enough (for me they were at least!)

My favorite at Rehab was the sweet potato tots. Pure genius. Served with a little pineapple sort of dip. My baby boy and I loved them! 

The decor was relaxed and the service was EXCELLENT!

If you are in Old Town Scottsdale don't miss it!"}
{"text":"Amazing burgers with a wide range of unique flavors that surprise the pallet such as the peanut butter and jelly and  sriracha.  A surprisingly amazing burger. Well worth the 30 minute wait for lunch. The classic burgers were delicious if not one of the best, but you must explore the different and unique other flavors that make this place amazing. Let's not forget the French fries with the skin. You must! Eat here at least once!"}
{"text":"Wanted to love this place.  Service was slow, but the place was packed.  Asked for onion rings but was told they only had enough for the burgers that had onion rings on them.  

Opted for a Hawaiian burger.  It was good, but they didn't bring the aoli that was supposed to come with it.  Finished 1/2 my burger before I was able to flag down the server.  (He never came by to check to make sure everything was okay.)  

While waiting to flag down the server for my aoli, the table next to us received a basket of onion rings!!  I guess they decided they had enough now.  They offered to bring us some... if we paid for them.  We were almost done with our meals by that point... we declined.

No drink refills were offered.  We were without water and soft drinks throughout most of our meal.   Overall the service was very lacking...being busy is not an excuse for virtually no service whatsoever.   Even if we lived in the area, we would not return.  Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Killer!  Almost literally.  I had my burger with Ghost pepper cheese.  The burger was really good, but the ghost pepper was knocking me down.  It's hard to fully enjoy your food when the pepper is burning.

Otherwise great burgers.  Tried a bite of the peanut butter and jelly bacon burger.  Really good, but it also had a bbq flavor that threw me off.

The sweet potato tater tots were delicious!  Overall great place and I would recommend going."}
{"text":"Oh. My. Goodness. 
This place is incredible. All four of us LOVED our burger. Including one notoriously picky kid who said (after 2 bites), \"This is a 5-star burger.\"
Service was great! So glad we came!"}
{"text":"NOT your average burger joint... Great burgers when you want something different!

ALSO... impressed that management called the police when a Ferrari was blocking the handicap spots!!!!  LOVE IT!!! THANK YOU!!!

FYI--- Peanut Butter / Bacon / Cheeseburger... Just DO IT and thank me later!"}
{"text":"I'm so sad! Everyone - literally everyone - raves about this place. We've tried to check it out several times, but it's always been packed. Fortunately one day we got off of work a little early and were able to beat the dinner rush. I got the Jalapeno Popper burger and it was such a disappointment. I was expecting fresh fried jalapenos, but they were the frozen/pickled peppers with no taste and to top it off the burger was dry and bland. And then the final straw was the soda was flat and not enough syrup. I mentioned that to the server and she replaced it with a different selection, and even that was flat. We were super hoping to love this place like everyone else, but just didn't meet par with what we'd expect from a burger place. However, the music selection was great - and if we were craving the SoCal vibes and there's not a long line, we might try it again, but I'll just stick with the basic burger next time."}
{"text":"Amazing food. First time there I had the ghost burger (rehab edition) with fries and it was amazing. Very bold flavors and fresh ingredients. It's very Island like with island music so if you don't like that kind of music it may kinda throw you off. Other than that very good food. Thank you for serving delicious food!"}
{"text":"I've been to this place several times and I'm never disappointed. It's become my go-to place when people come to visit. The portions are kinda large so it's nice to share or take home the extra.  I've had the burgers and the salads...all very good!"}
{"text":"Truthfully, my rating lies somewhere between 3 and 4 stars. I came here recently on a business trip. My deep love of cheeseburgers and the high reviews here had me convinced that I just HAD to pay a visit. 

We arrived around 7pm on a Wednesday night and the place was pretty packed. After a 10 minute wait we were seated. Our waitress was friendly and quickly available. We ordered a couple drinks and a burger each. I opted for a Corona-rita and the Hatch burger, my friend ordered a Mike Tai and the Hangover burger.

The drinks were alright, my friend felt that hers was sickeningly sweet and mine was good, but nothing to write home about. Our burgers arrived quickly, hot off the grill and each with a large serving of fries. The burgers were good, although the bun on mine was fairly burnt in a few areas. I was happy with the food, but I wouldn't consider it amazing."}
{"text":"OMG!! So delish. We shared the Hangover burger, salad, sweet potatoes tots and the corn. Everything was excellent. Paired with a great beer. Wish I lived here to be able to come back more often. Great decor, service and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great food and drinks! So happy to have Rehab burger in the neighborhood. The staff was friendly and the patio was perfectly comfortable with the misters. The temperature was in the high 90's!"}
{"text":"THE BEST BURGER PLACE!!!! We went to Rehab after a hike and we were so glad we stopped.  The staff could tell we had not been there before, so our waitress took it upon herself to tell us everything there was to know.  It was wonderful to be welcomed that way.  We got our food quickly and she even brought over different sauces for our fries/ sweet tater tots that were far beyond the usual ketchup.  The sweet tater tots with pineapple sauce was to die for! Salty and sweet and it hits your tongue just right. (I don't even like pineapple and I ate it up!) The chipotle ranch is amazing and not too spicy for a wimp like me.   The burgers are giant, def order the smaller size, and the pretzel bun is a MUST. We also enjoyed some of the best calamari as an appetizer with the chipotle ranch.  The atmosphere is so fun and it seemed like a vacation within a vacation for me.  I wish there was one close to where I live, I would be a regular."}
{"text":"I don't particularly enjoy eating out. But this place was a pleasure!  I don't recall the last time I went to a place where every item brought out was stupendous. I ate with two others and we all shared, so I sampled three burgers, four sides (one person doubled up), and all the sauces. I loved every single thing!  I just moved here from Chicago and have been rather disappointed with the food here but this place gives me hope.  Also, our service was amazing.  Not just our waitress, but the entire staff went out of the way to make our table comfortable. Super impressed.

I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Amazing place....great atmosphere and incredible burger.  My son got the fettuccine with pesto and he loved it.  It's a must go to!!!!!!  I'm from NY and very picky...this is a winner"}
{"text":"I had a bacon cheeseburger from at this place the other day.  That was my first time eating here. I am huge burger aficionado and am always on the lookout for the best burger ever. Hodad's in San Diego is my #1 and has been for a long time. This place would probably make my #1 in Phoenix. I will definitely be going back. I would order the fries over the onion rings... you pay extra for rings and I only got 4. I did try the fries on my friend's plate... they were good."}
{"text":"We had a reservation and sat down for 10 minutes and then the waitress came over and said you have to move to the bar, we have a party of 10 coming in and we were a party of 7. We moved to a smaller table, it was very hot inside, then five other people came in and sat at that table we were moved from, i went up to pay for my drink and asked if that was their party of 10? She said that they tried to call the party of 10 and the party of 10 and could not reach them. They could have moved us back. We left, they will never get our business again. Bad business practice on them."}
{"text":"Stopped in there with a friend for the first time and was very impressed!
Plenty of parking, fun and friendly vibe as soon as you walk in.
Had the ghost burger which was delicious and the bun fit the burger size too.
Since we sat at the bar we thoroughly enjoyed the fun banter with our bartender Courtney! 
Since I eat out a lot this place seems to have gotten it right with the fun dining concept. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Had the turkey burger with avocado and aioli and it was great! They also have a decent beer selection.  If you really like burgers and beers, give this place a shot!"}
{"text":"Came here last weekend with some family and friends.  We were surprising someone who didn't know we were in town, and the staff was more than willing to help us surprise this person.  Besides the staff being really helpful and hilariously playing along with our prank, the food is soooo good.  We had a side of chips/guac for an app, we felt the side of guac was a little small, but we are all from Cali, so maybe we are just spoiled.  3 of us had the BBQ burger, which was delicious, and very very filling.

We would definitely come back if we are in town again."}
{"text":"Whoever came up with adding Sriracha to the PBJ burger is a genius!  The Sriracha added just the right amount of heat to let you know it had come to the party without kicking the door down with a pink wig on and screaming, \"I'm here!\"  Great stuff, love this place."}
{"text":"The food is delicious! We ordered bacon cheeseburgers and I got a chocolate shake that was so good! The young hostess seemed a little aloof at first as she didn't make eye contact, but she was nice when we asked her a question and a hard worker as we saw her multi-tasking between clearing tables and greeting patrons. Our server was super friendly and down-to-earth and a woman who appeared to be the owner or manager also stopped by to check on our experience, which was nice. There is a mix of a young hip crowd as well as plenty of people over 40 (thank goodness!) and there is a cool, fun vibe here. Not a major deal, but the women's restroom was the tiniest one I've ever seen with barely room for someone to wait without being hit by the door. It's located in Old Town Scottsdale so it's fun to walk around and sightsee in the area as well."}
{"text":"Nice place, really laid back feel, reminds me of cali which im sure was the intended vibe. we'd go back one day. Friendly waiters, good food."}
{"text":"The PB&J burger has flavor unbounded!!! It has been by far the best inventive burger I ever tasted. If you love peanut butter you will be in love with the combo of peanut butter bacon and jelly! Definitely
try it!"}
{"text":"My friend and I had lunch here today. It was 110 outside, and we were looking for relief from the heat. Sadly, it did not feel much better inside. When I mentioned it to our server, she actually said yeah it's 92 degrees in here, our ventilation sucks... So apparently this is an everyday thing, not an a/c on the fritz. 92 is not an ok temperature to have lunch indoors! Temperature aside, the service was friendly but VERY slow. I ordered the Beijing Beefstro salad. It was greasy and just not appetizing. I can take partial blame for ordering a a salad at a burger joint, but wow this salad was just gross. They did take it off the bill when I said it wasn't what I expected, so that's the bright side. My friend liked her chicken sandwich and sweet tots. I tasted the tots, and they were good. I don't think I'll come back here... definitely not in the summer."}
{"text":"Just stopped by for chips and salsa and a coke while waiting for hubby at surgery center. Food looks amazing and smells good too. I will definitely come back and try a burger!! Never mind customer service stinks!!!! Chips and salsa is good thou! OK so I had to go ask for my check...I told the manager of the bad service I experienced...She apologized and offered to cover my bill. I told her I was happy to pay for my order as the food was good. But she politely asked that I let her take care of it and that poor customer service is not the normal there. I thanked her....So I'm upping to 3 stars until I go back as see how the normal really is!"}
{"text":"Not impressed. I ordered the turkey burger - which I guess, who does that at a burger joint - but I was looking for something semi-healthy, and a good turkey burger done right is pretty good! This patty was rubbery, garbage meat from Frozen Foods of America straight off the truck. To cover it up, they used a pound of shredded cafeteria iceberg lettuce. Woof. Although the portions are big, I'd rather have smaller, better quality. In addition to the crappy food, we had a crappy service. We were a party of 8, so larger table and I get that. But it took an hour (literally) for the server to take our order- after I had to go tell the hostess we were ready to order (also, they weren't busy on a Tuesday night at 7pm). And it took an hour (literally) for our food to come to the table. The atmosphere is fun, and the menu items sounded good, but I don't know that I'd go back. Not even to try the PB&J burger!"}
{"text":"We came in on a Tuesday night a group of about 30. Our server was training a new server both girls were very attentive. Service was fast, helpful, and friendly. Food came out fast and all cooked correctly. I tried the Hawaiian Burger this time. Meat was cooked perfectly, the Pineapple Teriyaki Aioli and grilled pineapple made the burger both sweet and savory. Fries cooked nice and came out hot. Great job on everything."}
{"text":"Yum, yum! Food was delicious and the all day Happy Hour on a Saturday didn't suck either. Had the PB & J & Bacon burger... Ridiculous! I'll be back FOR SURE!"}
{"text":"I went to Phoenix this weekend and my brother told me I needed to try this place. I wish I would have listened to my brother's suggestion and ordered the \"Beefstro\" burger. I ordered the \"Mac Gnarley\" burger, which was good, but not as good as some of the others. My boyfriend ordered the a pulled pork burger, that was Delicious! The Beefstro my brother ordered was apparently amazing (I didn't have the chance to try it, he eats really fast!) The salsa was pretty tasty, but I would have liked some better chips. 

The place has a fun atmosphere with mostly high top tables, there are plenty of TVs to watch sports, and our server was super sweet and helpful. 

When you go, get the fries. I had the sweet potato fries, and they were a little too sweet for my taste, and were in the tater tot style (little pops or pieces I guess). 

Oh and beer was cold. Very important. :)"}
{"text":"Good burgers, fun menu, large portions and friendly service! I was there in a group of five, two of us were interested in Hatch burger, so we ordered larger portion (rehab size) to share - they didn't have a problem with it, brought an extra plate with the order and it looked like they actually added more fries."}
{"text":"Great food. The chicken wings were good. Loved the hangover burger with a fired egg, bacon, and a hatch chile. The sweet potato tots were good as well."}
{"text":"The burger was good but EVERYTHING was cold. Cold burger, cold fries and SLOW service. The house salad had a ton of cheap shredded cheese on it.?The key to a good burger place is to server HOT fries and a hot burger."}
{"text":"Might be the best hamburger we have ever had. Great selection. We had a poblano and a hatch burger and split them to taste both. The hatch burger was very good but the poblano won out. The sauces for each were very tasty. Atmosphere is more of a bar so it's probably not what I would call a family restaurant, nor is it meant to be. Prices are reasonable and service was top notch. This was our second time there and won't be our last. Was it worth the drive from Gilbert  just for a burger? Absolutely! Have to try the mac and cheese... looks yummy."}
{"text":"I travel for work and always try to hit local places. Took the recommendation of the waiter to try the PB&J burger with bacon and sriracha. It was amazing. An odd combination of flavors that work. Place has a cool laid back vibe and lots TV's. I highly recommend it if you are in the area. A great find for this business traveler!!!"}
{"text":"Great inventive burgers and love the casual laid back vibe. Customer service was great too. The tropical theme made me want to plan our next beach vacation!"}
{"text":"I've heard from a few friends that Rehab has some of the best burgers in town. I was in Scottsdale & decided to give it a try.

The atmosphere is beach-like and I got a table outside. The menu is pretty extensive, but I decided to get the Rehab Bacon Cheeseburger with Fries & a side of Spicy Pineapple BBQ Sauce. 

The food came out and the burger was massive. It was pretty intense and I was unable to finish it. The burger was cooked medium just as I asked and had great flavor. 

I would definitely go again!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome from The service, food, drinks, & atmosphere.  The best happy hour every day from opening til 6! Great menu options and if you are gluten-free like I am they have great tasting gluten-free items and a large variety to choose from. I ordered the byob burger on a gf bun with the pineapple bbq sauce and it was cooked exactly the way I wanted it and it tasted so good. If you are gluten-free you know how difficult eating out with your family can be and your choices can be very limited,  but not at rehab! 
Definitely try the sweet potato tots, they are amazing! The service was excellent from everyone we encountered, the hostess, the manager, the server, and the bartender. My bloody mary was perfect and my husband's beers were ice cold. The decor is very relaxed beach vibe, makes you want to hang out there all day. I'm definitely going back!"}
{"text":"Big burgers. clean restaurant. Beers for 1.75 cents during happy hour. Andy was the bar tender he did a great job knew the menu and was proactive making sure I had everything I needed."}
{"text":"I had the PBJ burger like 7 months ago and it is still in my dreams. I want one so bad haha!"}
{"text":"This place sets the bar of what a burger should look like and taste like. This place is great fries are good. The burger is the star here."}
{"text":"Favorite Burger Joint!! The poblano mac and cheese burger makes my arteries cringe and my tummy rejoice!"}
{"text":"This is a great burger place! Dont get overwhelmed with the many burger/sandwich options-just give in to the idea of multiple future visits! 
The jalapeno popper burger was ok (i wish the popper had more jalapeno-less breading), but the Hangover and the ChiliCheese burger was a big hit with my family. 
Our server Cassidy was fantastic, had great food suggestions, AND makes an AMAZING caramel shake. The restaurant had pretty clever sayings on their employee shirts, which we will look into buying when they restock... i guess we are just gonna HAVE TO go back,  *sigh*"}
{"text":"love rehab.  Found this place a couple years ago with a \"group\" dinner.  We have beenn going back ever since.  We love the burgers..and to be honest..the calamari is EXCELLENT..didn't think I would ever say that about a hamburger joint.  LOVE IT"}
{"text":"Pretty good burger! The meat was really tender. Of course I asked for it rare but it tasted delicious and wasn't rubbery like some red meat tends to be. Delicious sauces they add to the burger and pretty good fries. They're very salty which I love!"}
{"text":"This was my first time here and it was pretty good. The service was pretty slow but the food made it worth it. I used to work in the restaurant industry so service is a big deal for me. I understand if it's busy the server may be doing several tables but tonight wasn't that busy. It took over ten minutes for us to be greeted... that's pretty ridic- if you're busy at least stop by and say hey I'll be with ya in a few. Took another five min for our waters to come, then five more for drinks from bar. Once I had my ketel one I was alright tho since our burgers were ordered too. For how slow the service was I thought the food would've been slow too, but it was the opposite. It came really fast so I was happy. I had the hangover burger and man was it good. Slap any burger with a fried egg on it and I'll be sure to try it at least one time."}
{"text":"I haven't ate here yet, been awaiting for it to open. But after reading Kristy's review I now will totally go. Because any place that treats a bitchy lady like that, has my business. 

Will update after my official meal here.

*Update*
I stopped by here Tuesday after work for dinner. Parked in the back and walked through their sliding, automatic doors. 
This place has a great little neighborhood vibe. Greeted by a few servers and I think management who were all very pleasant and told me I could sit anywhere. 
Ended up sitting at a high top. Our sever was very quick, ordered a beer and right after management asked if we would like to see the Diamondbacks game on the tv in front of us. (Hockey game just ended), \"hell yes\". 
Took a look at the menu, definitely packed with all sorts of burger arrangements. I hear their pbj burger is amazing. 
But I'm stubborn and a picky eater so I went with a build my own burger. 
RARE (aka, the only way one should eat a burger/steak, up to medium rare). 
BOMB.com
Burger was juicy, and a pretzel bun. 
Needless to say, I slept like a baby after dinner. 
Can't wait to go back and try the wings.!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place. Burgers are super yummy. Atmosphere was  chill, lots of energy and people. Staff is very friendly and helpful. Try the Ghost burger."}
{"text":"Dinner.   Great burger.  Had the P.B.and J Bacon on pretzel bun with the sweet potato tots.  Weird combination, but was surprisingly tasty. The combo of P.B., Jelly and bacon together was a unexpected flavorfull surprise.  Tots were great.  Great bar service.  Will be back."}
{"text":"First time here and won't be the last. Amazing! They were out of onion rings though :( so definitely will be back to try those!"}
{"text":"I arrived and was the third person in at opening. I was greeted very warmly. I looked around at all the cool tvs playing all types of everything except news. The decor was great. Surfer, bicycle, RC Planes and snowboarding props all around. The music was beach themed and fun. I decided to sit at bar to look at some basketball. The bartender was very friendly and knowledgeable. She let me sample a beer that I havent had before. She was very helpful in helping me decide which burger to choose. I went simple and got the huge burger with 1000 island, The MacSomething.  She upsold me to the onion rings which looked great. I also ordered the pig wings which I knew were going to be too much, but I wanted something to munch on later that night. The food arrived and looked fantastic.  I jumped in on the onion rings first, they had a nice golden brown to them. I got 5 with my order.  I picked one up and it was cold. That put a disappointed frown on my face. They were ice cold. I waved down the bartender and explained to her my problem and she said she would take care of it and get me some more. I said no problem. I decided to go to the burger next. I cut it in half and it was perfectly cooked to med-rare. Happy happy. It taste great too. You could taste the smokeyness of the fire on the meat. Darn good. I tried the pig wing, it was alright. Alittle overcooked in my opinion, but good enough. I received my onion rings and \"Viola\", they were the same ones I had originally except they were re-dropped into the fryer and came back dark and burnt, black on edges. Very un-cool. To the owners, is it really going to kill your food cost to re-cook 5 slices of onions? That wrecked and really affected your scoring.  I was the second person to get my food, it wasnt even busy yet. If you are having staff upsell something, make sure the product is delicious. Sounds like kitchen staff made onion rings before burger, and they sat in window along time. I made sure the bartender and, I think she was the manager or owner, see that I was not pleased with onion rings and left them in clear view. They never said anything. Kinda disappointing considering it was a upsell. By the time I was ready to leave, the place was packed. Understanding the business, I know it takes time to get check. I even stood up to get their attention and the bartender finally came over after 10 minutes and asked if I needed anything else.
Place needs 2 bartenders. The woman working cant take drink orders and food orders and then run food. She is not Superwoman, and Superwoman couldnt handle that rush either. You get bad customer service. Which I received. 
Damn good burger though. If onion ring problem didnt occur, probably would have given a 4 or 5."}
{"text":"Excellent burgers with an amazing selection.  I had the smaller (5 oz.) Poblano burger.  Outstanding.  Many of the burger joints that will prepare a rare burger (and many won't) do not know how to do it.  This was a rare burger - crispy on the outside, pink and chewy in the middle.  Perfect.  The much-discussed sweet potato tots were bland, but there were plenty of them.  The beer was cold, and Thursday was all-day happy hour.  Overall, this is an excellent place for an affordable and interesting burger experience."}
{"text":"I know it's trendy now to make a burger that has everything but the kitchen sink on it. Too big to pick up and makes a mess of everything to try, (Thanks Guy Fieri) but it just isn't for me. I ordered a burger with Thousand Island and it looked like a 55 gallon drum of Thousand Island dressinf was dumped on it. \"We go big here\" is what the waiter told me as I sent the inedible mess back. The service was good and staff helpful and courteous but it's a burger not a construction project."}
{"text":"The vibe in this place is amazing. From the music, the staff to food, this joint is the ultimate beach bar right in the heart of Old Town Scottsdale...and they do they're burgers RIGHT!"}
{"text":"Great burgers at this joint in Scottsdale. The beef patty was cooked to perfection and they offer a nice selection of specialty burgers to choose from or just the traditional. Staff was friendly and the prices are fair. Like the sweet potato tots... Definitely try this place out if you are hungry and in mood for a burger!"}
{"text":"Over-rated burger joint. How much can they put on a burger..or the real question is how much can they take out of your wallet and let you think that a hamburger was worth it. I had to eat outside and spent all my time shewing flies and the service was poor."}
{"text":"Unique place any Burger that you can think of and want it is there open atmosphere great service enjoyable music food was very good if you can think of the burger that you have in mind from a mac and cheese with jalapenos on a pretzel roll to a bacon cheeseburger with blue cheese and gouda this is your place to go ahead and check out and explore very unique area in Arizona don't sleep on it.

I would recommend that you get there early school is back in session so the college kids do crowd this around seven or eight nice stroll down Mill Street love this place make sure you continue Explorer restaurants and bars are all over everywhere."}
{"text":"The peanut butter and jelly burger was life changing! Mac and cheese burger was also good. Pretty cramped inside, more bar atmosphere than restaurant."}
{"text":"Gotta tell ya....every single time I go to Rehab Burger Therapy, I'm thrilled with my decision to go back.  From the laid-back and welcoming atmosphere; to the delicious burgers (can't find one that my friends or I don't like), to the great wait-staff (Megan was our awesome waitress on my most recent visit).....RBT is the kind of gastronomic and dining therapy I want over and over again.  

IMHO: this is the best burger place in the Valley of the Sun."}
{"text":"This restaurant is easily five stars. The restaurant is a good burger place. Plus this place has salads if you are a vegetarian. Also this place has really good beer, and has GREAT appetizers (chips). I would recommend this restaurant to everyone. Bomb.com!!!!!!"}
{"text":"2nd visit there and wonderful again.  The burgers are great and the sweet potato tots are the best!  Highly recommend"}
{"text":"There are no words about Rehab... but let me attempt anyway. This is burger nirvana. And whatever they put in that pesto voodoo sauce/aoili they serve should be illegal. 

Always a great atmosphere and the burgers are always on point! We love Rehab and always take out-of-town family to this crazy, hopping little joint where they care about their food, their customers, and their reputation. Bon vivant!"}
{"text":"Good people good is good. I take my family here although My sister could use less burger and more  Rehab."}
{"text":"My favorite burger place in town.  All of the burgers are great and even their wings are amazing."}
{"text":"They have the best burgers anywhere in Phoenix!  Great seasoning and excellent varieties.  Very creative with flavors that I haven't seen anywhere else before.  

One drawback was cold fries.  We complained and happily got a new batch.  They were cold, too, so we just ate them."}
{"text":"Loved the beach vibe.  Burgers were as described with creative options as well as build your own. Yummy sweet potato tots and a generous portion. Fun outdoor patio"}
{"text":"This. Was. Amazing!  PBJ Sriracha burger has made me look at life in a whole new way!"}
{"text":"I had the PB and J burger with sriracha and bacon - GREAT!!!!  I have to go back now to try the sweet potato fries!  The bacon was high quality and cooked just right!!  I wish I could have had a beer with this, but had to hit the road back to Tucson.  The burger was cooked just right, and it the oozing pb and j ran onto my fries for dipping.  It had the perfect combo of sweet and spice.  Good service, nice ambiance - I kinda felt like I was on vacation on the beach - a nice desert oasis.  I want to go back and try more of the burgers - there are so many to choose from!"}
{"text":"Love their burgers, It can get super busy but it's a sign that they are good, right? Great friendly service too"}
{"text":"We had a wonderful dinner! The Cobb salad was fantastic. My youngest and her friend had the pbj with fries. My oldest had the alfredo. A friend of my oldest had the bacon cheeseburger. All 4 kids had chocolate shakes. We were all very impressed with the food, service, and ambience."}
{"text":"Excellent for out of towner. I give it a five for the food and portions.  No way could I eat the entire burger at one sitting.
The atmosphere is more relaxed casual pub which is why it only got 4 stars. Service for water was fast and as soon as we got low it was refilled.
The food did take a while to come out though."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers I've ever had! The mac n cheese burger was unbelievable, the poblano was equally as good and the service was incredible. Great experience!"}
{"text":"Delicious!! Back yard  BBQ burger , bloody  Mary was on point! And the Jalapeño Popper Burger!! Mmm.."}
{"text":"Definitely lived up to all the hype! We came here after receiving multiple recommendations. Husband got the PBJ & Bacon Burger and I got the Spicy Mac & Cheese Burger. And woah. We were blown away! Especially at the PBJ one, which was also widely recommended. It's one we would have never thought to order, but did because of how many people, including our server, told us it was amazing. My husband already had really high expectations for it, and it even exceeded those. The spicy Mac one was also delicious. Both the sweet potato tots and the fries were great - we got an order of each. Get the chipotle aioli with the tots!!! Their ranch is also really extra good. Highly recommend. Will be back! Oh, and it's also extremely reasonably priced! We were actually very pleasantly surprised by the prices. :)"}
{"text":"Welcome to the hood! 

The place was pretty busy. Full of old people and families, which just seemed weird to me. (My neighborhood usually seems to be young adults 28-35 year olds) 

After waiting 10 minutes to get seated we were warmly greeted by our server, placed our order and waited 45 minutes for our burger. I was literally starving at this moment. The place isn't THAT BUSY.. but I'm sure they don't have a groove yet..another 15 minutes, no burger. 

LITERALLY turning into a snickers commercial..

WHY DIDNT I GO TO ZIPPS? SANTAN? I'm morphing into the crying baby next to me.. FEED ME. 

The burger comes. It's boring, cheese, medium rare like I asked..but no jalapeños, no lettuce, no tomatoes..a super lame pickle and the pretzel bread is kinda hard.. and the onion straws were burnt to a crisp..I don't mind burnt food, but would've liked more onions. *see picture*

Let's just say I'm not impressed. However, I've been to the other locations and know how good it can be..

Our server was 5 stars, but I have plenty of friends.. I came here to EAT. 

3 stars for amazing service. 
Rule for all restaurants.. Don't make me eat carbs I don't love.  

I'll give you another try. TBC.."}
{"text":"Oh my lan. The food at this place was soooo yummy. We walked into this small, quaint place got a table and had the sweetest Hostess ever, Sarah. 

The burgers were well portioned and well priced. They all come with the option of fries, sweet potato tots, or onion rings. 

The service and food was prompt and they were really busy. 

Let's just say I loved this place. And would so come back my next trip to Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Rehab is by far the best burger joint in the Valley. My favorite burger there use to be the Mac and Cheese burger. Best homemade mac and cheese I have ever had until recently. They seemed to have changed the recipe because when I went there this last time it was horrible. It made me nauseous. I'll never order that again, good thing they still have a menu full of other amazing food."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is hip and fun. As a native of San Diego, I felt like I was home by the beach! The service was fantastic and the food good. My burger felt a little dry and flavorless but others at my table didn't have that problem so maybe I need to go medium well next time :) Oh, and their fries and ranch dressing are amazing."}
{"text":"Oh.....my......god. The PB&J Burger was the best burger I've ever had in my life, I think. Peanut butter, Jelly, Siracha, and Bacon on a pretzel bun with a delicious, perfectly cooked patty. I think this place will be a regular stop when I'm in the Tempe area. 
Not to mention, the service was good, and the vibe was relaxed and fun, reggae music playing loud enough to be fun, but not so loud to make conversation hard. We sat on the shaded patio and it was just great."}
{"text":"Rehab burger was an enjoyable atmosphere. The music featured rock ranging from The Eagles to Sublime. I enjoy the warm feeling and concept they are going for. I thoroughly enjoy a good burger. I was not particularly blown away from the meal. The French fries tasted like the oil needed to be changed in the fryer. In all fairness we didn't go out until 8pm at night: the burger was not bad just not something I was happy paying $14 bucks for. I'll attach some pics. We had the honey medium wings and they were better then the burger. The wings were not fatty, had plenty of meat on them, cooked perfectly, and tossed in a great flavor sauce. It's possible the wings set the bar too high. I chose the rehab hangover burger. This included, bacon, fried egg, 10oz patty, Colby cheese, chipotle mayo, and a very fresh flavorful hatch chili. The idea behind the burger was perfect. The execution was not there. The patty was cooked medium but had an over char to it, giving it a burnt taste, the fried egg was over cooked, I was really looking forward to bursting the yoke! The bacon was over cooked. The bun had good flavor but should have been toasted longer and was a bit tough like it had lost some of its freshness. The hatch chili had great flavor! Ultimately, I will go back on another day perhaps when it's slower to see if the execution is better. The servers and bartenders were polite and friendly."}
{"text":"What a fanatic fun place. Last night was the first time there. We had a party of 11 and got seated right away. Waitress was so nice and checked on us often. The food was so good. We ordered many different plates and we all where happy with the food, I  had the basic buger and it had so much flavor and the frys where great also. This place was in old town Scottsdale, love the feel of the place. Will come back again.
They have table service."}
{"text":"Vettes and Rods Car Club has a GREAT time at  Rehab Burger Therapy this last Sunday! Awesome food and AWESOME service! We had at least 35 members there and we could not have had a better time! MOST COOL! And - I heard a few friends say \"I think we have found our new favorite place\" :-) Thanks again for a great time!"}
{"text":"This place was average. We made a trip down here to old town Scottsdale due to the great reviews. The place was very busy and we luckily got a table. The server was nice but the wait for the food to come out took a while. We had the hangover burger with sweet potato tots. The bread was not super soft. The green chilies in the burger were not spicy at all. The burger was also a bit dry and lacked flavor. The tots were really good. With all the hype and reviews we thought this place would be amazing. It was average at best. Won't be back..."}
{"text":"Visiting Scottsdale this weekend and had the best burger ever!! The place was way over-crowded, the wait was long and the waitress had too many tables.... but the friendliness of the staff and the amazing food was worth the wait and the crowds. Gluten-Free option for one kid and the bun was delicious. Turkey burger for one kid and it actually tasted great. All fresh and homemade. We'll definitely be back on the next trip"}
{"text":"Ok. I watched a review of this place and my friend at work dared me to try the PBJ Burger. I'm a little adventurous and did it. AMAZING!!!!! It did NOT disappoint. If you want to have fun and explore a little, they have flavor combos that really will blow you away. Try it!"}
{"text":"Great food, casual environment and good drinks!  It gets crowded at lunch so make sure to come early."}
{"text":"Made it out to Rehab.  It was Friday night and it was busy.  We waited about 30 minutes and were seated inside.  Our waitress looked super high but was very nice.  She took our drink order and came back with them promptly.  Then she took our order.  

Then we waited, and waited, and waited...and... waited.   I dont know exactly how long we waited but it had to be close to an hour.  I understand you are busy but Im talking wings, fries, and burgers.  Did the blazed waitress forget our order?  Finally our food comes out.  She forgot a couple of our requests but we were so hungry we were just happy to eat something.

I had the hangover on a pretzel bun sweet potato tots and some wings.  The bun was awesome.  The burger was a good size and above average.  The hatch chile was almost flavorless.  The tots were not good.  The wings were hot, crisp, and excellent.  My wife had the hatch burger and fries.  She was not happy with her meal and couldnt even finish half of it even though we were starving.

We both agreed the food is drastically overrated and the service is poor.  So then we wait for our bill, and waited, and waited...and wait...theres our stoned waitress doing some kind of charades with another table laughing and hugging them.  We watched her for at least 15 minutes chat and visit with them.  I finally waived her over and paid and left.

I have been wanting to come here for a long time and have heard great things about it.  Maybe it was a bad night.  Maybe a bad waitress?  Maybe I ordered wrong?  I'm not sure but the food was very average.  Actually reminded me of Islands Burgers.  Both the decor and the taste but with a terrible wait time.  

If I was in the area and wanting a burger I'd consider giving it another try but its not at the level of recommendation or top burger joint at this point in my life."}
{"text":"I had heard such good things about Rehab, but with expensive, mediocre food and dismal service I was very disappointed with my visit.

My friend and I decided to stop here before a Giants game at nearby Scottsdale Stadium. It was totally packed and there was an estimated 20 minute wait. Not bad, we had about an hour before the game started. Once seated, we all decided on our food quickly, but no waitress was to be found. It had to be at least 15 minutes of sitting alone in our little corner table before the waitress came. I ordered the smaller relapse backyard BBQ burger. 20 minutes later we finally had our food. By the time we had finished our meal and paid the check, we were late to the game. 

The food was bleh. No flavor, my burger was cooked well-done when I had asked for medium. The spicy pineapple BBQ sauce was gross. Whoever thought of that flavor combo should be fired. It just didn't work. The onion ring on the burger was soggy. The fries were bland as well. My friend wasn't happy with his bacon cheeseburger either. His burger too was overcooked and flavorless. For the quality of food we were served, we way overpaid. Our total was around $35 for two people. 

We came to Rehab thinking we could: A. Save some money, by eating before the game. and B. Have a great burger. Neither of those things happened. We should've just had eaten at the game. Maybe they had an off day, but I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"This was a great experience.  The beer was excellent the menu and burgers were great.   Service was fantastic.   Try the mac and cheese burger. It is great"}
{"text":"So just got back from \"Therapy\" I'm cured! That Mac an Cheese with bacon, and siracha  burger was killer! So freaking good and our waiter / bartender Andy says the PBJ burger is even better. So next time I'm all in on that. My wife had the Philly cheese steak burger and loved it also. The beer was nice and cold and Andy was super helpful, we can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Saw it.  Tried it.  Probably won't go back.  Bacon cheeseburger was a 4 out of 5. Big. and burger was cooked well.   Bacon was burnt.  Fries were sub par.  Server was pretty good.  Cool atmosphere."}
{"text":"This is an outstanding burger place! I looked up best burgers in Scottsdale on Yelp & Trip adviser. They suggested Rehab Burger! Let me tell you this is an awesome hamburger restaurant! Waitress are awesome, service is outstanding! Loved everything! Wide choice of burgers! Casual dress, mix of people. My husband ordered the blue cheese burger, that is infused with blue cheese, ordered extra blue cheese on top, I ordered the hatch burger, yummy! Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Rehab burger needs to go to rehab.... All these great reviews but I don't know, are these people to drunk to notice that there's a lot of things going wrong because of it being close to old town maybe it's the liquor and they just don't care about anything. Well I was fully sober coming into this place. The girl upfront is clueless let's just say that I really don't want to be mean but they really hired a girl who doesn't know anything about a simple job of \"Hi welcome to Rehab burger! How many do you have with you?? Would you like to be seated outside or inside???\" I walk in and she was busy so she tells me she will be right there to help me when she's done so instead of blocking the door because the desk is right in front of the door and it being such a tight place I walked outside thinking she will help me. Two other people walk in and the girls at her desk just waiting.. So I'm like okay I guess she's don't doing what she's doing so after the people in front of are done I walk and she doesn't even take me before them which one makes no sense and she tells me 25 minutes of wait.... I perfectly see 3 tables open.. She also had a low voice so she mumbles and you have to ask her a couple times to repeat herself. She just shouldn't be doing that job I guess it's so hard to do (Sarcasm) so she said 25 minutes my friends getting mad because he sees the tables himself but I say I bet it won't take 25 minutes and he agrees. So we wait outside and she calls the other group in 5 minutes and us in 10 minutes and those tables still being empty she asks me if we wanted to sit at the community table.. I think that should of been a question before us waiting because there were multiple open spots so we took them we didn't even care. We sat and our waitress was very nice and was quick I give her props she should maybe switch positions with the other girl but I think that would make it worse i would probably order a cheese burger and get no cheese and she would probably ask me if I wanted cheese after getting the cheeseburger I ordered... Sorry for the joke let's put all jokes aside. I ask the girl what's the most popular and what's your favorite and to both of those was the Peanut butter jelly Sriracha sandwich. So hey why not let's try it.. One, way to much peanut butter that you can't taste the burger meat.. So what's the point of the meat?? And I didn't even taste Sriracha either it had no spice to it at all.. Maybe less peanut butter so we can enjoy the meat because if not just serve it with just toast. My fries were also cold with it being busy should I have fresh fries?? I was really confused. The prices are good the waitress was cool but the burger I got recommended was kinda disappointing..  And the girl in front just needs to find something else to do maybe make sense.. Next time I come here I'll make sure I'm drunk."}
{"text":"I split the Donut Burger & PB&J sriracha burger with sweet potatoe totts OMG!!! Amazing!"}
{"text":"I was stoked to check out Rehab--I'd heard really great things about it from a handful of people, it's close to my house, and they offer happy hour every day for those jabronies who work M-F, 9-5 (don't worry, I'm definitely one of these jabronies). But the experience as a whole was pretty underwhelming. 

So to begin with, Rehab is on a pretty busy corner of Mill. Totally fine, and not at all a complain, just something to note if you're planning on driving. The restaurant itself is pretty spacious, with a huge bar, plenty of inside tables, and a sizable patio--bonus points for tons of TVs so you can shout at your favorite sports team from wherever you're seated. 

We came here late afternoon on a Saturday, so it wasn't very busy at all. In fact, there seemed to be equal number of patrons and employees in the building. We were immediately seated and our drink orders taken pretty quickly; all standard stuff. But then our waiter didn't come back to take our food orders for probably another 15 minutes. Would've been fine and understandable if they were busy, but they definitely were not at all. After placing our food order, it didn't come out for another 40 minutes. What? It's a couple o' burgers. Again, would've made sense if they were slammed, but we were one of a dozen tables in there. Our server was very nice, but overall we were pretty disappointed by the lack of attention... And we are not typically people who want a whole ton of chattin' with our servers. 

As for the burgers themselves, they were fine. I had the Mac Gnarly, a pretty simple burger in comparison to the rest of the menu, but I was feelin' it. I got the relapse (smaller) size because I am a small human, and it was still a ton of food for me. And super messy, but I can't hold my lack of grace against Rehab. It was a perfectly fine burger, just nothing particularly special. I feel like if I'm ever going to pay $10+ for a burger, I'm expecting it to knock my socks off. It was just fine. And a little bit closer to well done than my request for medium doneness, but that's not a huge deal. The fella had the Know Poblano on a gluten free bun. He had a pretty similar summation of it: perfectly fine, but not mind-blowing. He did, however, say it was one of the better gluten free buns he's ever had. 

I will say that I really enjoyed the fries. Seasoned, but not too salty, and very crispy but still with a good amount of potato in there, they were very tasty. Pro tip: dip 'em in dat chipotle mayo. The sweet poTOToes were also tasty, and I don't generally care for them. 

Overall, we were just expecting more from Rehab. Maybe we just happened upon an off day for them, but it's hard not to be a little bummed to pay a little more than standard for a burger that's a little lacking. At this price point, I'll be sticking to Cold Beer and Cheeseburgers."}
{"text":"After reading all of the reviews, I had high expectations of the food and what a disappointment. First, the good. The ambience is fun, good vibe. The food was disappointing. We had chicken wings with sauces on the side, as recommended by the waitress. The sauces were good. The BBQ hamburger on brioche bun was supposed to come with onion rings, cheese and BBQ sauce. There was one huge onion ring (too big for the burger and not flavorful),  the cheese was a little sprinkle of grated cheese (next to none), sweet potato tater tots which were flavorless.  All the food lacked seasoning. Too many good restaurants in Scottsdale to go back."}
{"text":"2 thumbs up! Our server, Tina was great! I am on a continuous quest for the best , according to me, hamburger. I wasn't sure which direction I was going to go in and Tina directed me to the Hangover burger. Perfect! I always like my burgers rare and again perfect.
Definitely within my top 5 burgers. Thanks"}
{"text":"The Rehab \"Hangover\" burger is awesome. Cool spot and super friendly staff! You won't be disappointed whatsoever."}
{"text":"Best burger I have ever eaten!  Wasn't brave enough to try the pb&j, but the Hawaiian was excellent. Perfectly cooked, soft pretzel bun, good fries and great staff. Loved it!  Will definitely come back next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I give 5 stars for a reason. Everything I've ever had at Rehab is like a party in my mouth."}
{"text":"Once again a visit to burger rehab therapy. The best food the best service. Thank you Roco for once again the best service ever. Not a glass went dry, when the kids are taken care of first and fed fast. Everyone left happy and full. I've never had a bad meal and there were 16 off us and like I said we were well taken care of. And the food was amazing as always. Peanut Butter and jelly burger, chili burger, mushroom and Swiss, bacon burger, quesadilla, Mac and cheese and a spicy Mac and cheese burger, fish and chips. Sweet potato tots, onion rings, French fries.  That's how my friends from Colorado roll .  Yum"}
{"text":"Tina was my ideal server (friendly and attentive but not overbearing). The place is clean. The weekend special Philly burger with ghost pepper jack cheese was spectacular. My girlfriend (EXTREMELY picky) ordered the bacon bleu burger and loved it. My only complaint was a 20 min wait (packed house). Bravo Rehab Burger!"}
{"text":"Based on reviews I was excited to try this place out. You can't really go terribly wrong with a burger. The menu is great. I like when places think outside the box with their food. My man ordered the Mac N Cheese Burger... He was less than thrilled the Mac N Chz was cold and the burger just was. I ordered the PBJ & bacon burger. You have to be adventurous but I like that stuff. It was again just ok. Nothing spectacular. Maybe because it was cold or maybe because they messed up our buns. The chips and salsa were pretty good. I can't get overly thrilled about it. Would I come back? Possibly just to try something else but I would split it with someone because the price is not worth the food."}
{"text":"This place is very good.  The burgers are fat and juicy with unbelievable brioche or pretzel buns!

The bar is kinda small but has great craft beer.  I love the decor which has funky old radios and TVs with a DVD playing of a fish tank!"}
{"text":"YES. This place was great. Big juicy burger with a bunch of great fixings. I had the BBQ burger and their sauce was excellent. Service was great and this place was packed. If I'm ever out here again, I'll be back!"}
{"text":"This place is officially too crowded and food quality is suffering. A recent burger eaten by dining companion was greyish, looking more fast food color than fresh meat color. My pasta dish also suffered from under seasoning and not enough alfredo flavor. Seems like every tourist that still remains in Scottsdale is trying to eat at this tiny restaurant."}
{"text":"To start with,  the hostess and server were very attentive.  Server knew his beer list well. I ordered the jalapeno popper burger and it was delicious.  I'm loyal to a burger place back home so it's difficult for me to order burgers elsewhere.  This was worth it. Burger was cooked perfectly, spiced well and delicious.  The sweet potato tots were very good too. Fast service and great food.  Would definitely recommend to others."}
{"text":"Oh burger! Came in and sat at the bar on a Sunday evening. There was baseball on TV and burgers to eat.
The PB &J burger. I was a little skeptical of how this was going to be but with the umami of the beef and bacon and the sweetness of the peanut butter and jelly it was such a surprisingly amazing combo. The only thing I wish they had done was have a better separation between the peanut butter and the pickle. Not my favorite combo in the world.

The hatch burger with a turkey patty was also a great combo.

Try the home made mustard!"}
{"text":"Great burger place right in old town. It has a nice patio and it's not that big, but it was packed. I got the 10oz hang over burger with sweet potato tots and had to add the corn on the side as it looked amazing and it was good. The atmosphere is very cool with bikes hanging from the ceiling and cool signs all over the place. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"GREAT food!

Had the bacon cheeseburger, sweet potato tots, and pork.  Killer awesome food!!!  I will definitely be going back to this place!

got it to go and the food was still super yummy, bacon not soggy, etc.

can't go wrong here!!!"}
{"text":"Rehab Burger Therapy helped me turn over a new leaf. It honestly changed my life!

My name is Bobbi Billard and I was a Boring-aholic. I went to the same restaurants and I ordered the same thing every time. I was about as vanilla and predictable as it gets. And then I went to Rehab Burger Therapy and expanded my horizons. Mind blown! BOOM! 

What?!? You mean there is a place where you can go to that actually combines a burger with bacon and adds some oooey gooey peanut butter and grape jelly with sriracha sauce to it (PBJ & Bacon Burger) and you will try it out and not only will you not get sick, but instead you'll think it is out of this world AMAZING? Like it will become the stuff you dream about and can't get out of your head, until you go back and partake in it again? No flippin way, guy! I'm \"Same Girl\"! I go to the same places and order the same thing, every time, like a broken record... I'm scared to venture off the beaten path. I may get lost and never find my way home. Yep, I was a real snoozefest! *Zzzzzzzz!*

It took a little coaxing for them to get me to realize the errs of my ways & maybe it was the fact that I was feeling adventurous because I was on vacation, but once I got on the same page as these people, my life, as I once knew it, was never going to be the same! I've seen the light! This place was so magical that pigs can even fly here. Im not kidding! Order the Pig Wings and you'll see for yourself. 

No going back to Boringville now. All it took was a little trust and faith and I've forever changed, 100% for the better. I am no longer \"Same Girl\" and I'm now a recovering Boring-aholic. Admitting that I was one was the first step. I owe many thanks to John (the bartender) and Rehab Burger Therapy. Special shoutout to the other Yelpers for suggesting this place and what to order in the first place! Jon... Black 13! It's on! See ya soon dude! And THANK YOU for saving me from my boring ol' self!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Wow! The food was amazing! Peanut butter and jelly burger with bacon (sounds gross) was amazing! The salad we had was even better.... Wish I remembered the name of it. But it had tortilla strips and chicken and a whole lotta goodness! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I'm so glad I gave Rehab Burger another try after my less-than-stellar experience on my 24th birthday. 

This time, I came during peak dinner time on a Friday, and I went again on a Saturday for their special maple bacon donut burger! Both times we were served without a hitch. We had great customer service and I was really REALLY happy with my food. Their sweet potato tots are so good and I love that you can order TONS of sauce.

I am meticulously checking their social media to see if there are any fun special burgers coming up, because I don't want to miss out! They usually have a special or unique burger that's only available on Saturday/Sunday. (I learned the hard way that they don't serve the special burger on Fridays... hence the reason I went 2x in one weekend, lol!)

The only thing I noticed going two days in a row is that their rare/medium rare cooking is a little inconsistent. On Friday, the medium rare was already a little bloody. But on Saturday, the medium rare was different. Just something my boyfriend noticed. (I got rare both times and had no complaints.)

I also wish they validated parking!"}
{"text":"Stopped by here on an early Sunday evening. Placed was pretty packed, however they managed to get us a corner table. Burgers were delicious but they really should season their offerings just a bit more. My burger was a bit under seasoned as was my son's mac and cheese. All in all, I would come back to this place. Bonus points to our waitress who brought us milk for my son in a styrofoam cup with a lid, and didn't fill the damn cup all 24oz!! So my son was actually able to eat his dinner without filling up on milk."}
{"text":"Great food and drinks!  The service was a bit slow but our waitress was extremely nice and the place was packed.  My burger was well prepared and delicious.  The fries are tasty and the sweet potato tater tots are interesting (eat 'em with the spicy ketchup).  It's quite loud but it's a great atmosphere."}
{"text":"I have eaten lots of burgers in my travels, and I have to say that Burger Rehab Therapy is one of the best I have ever had. The meat is fresh, seasoned and cooked perfectly, the buns are fresh and soft, the toppings are fresh and the service is great. This is the burger that I will forever judge all burgers by. The other patrons are very friendly too. Lots of burger knowledge in this place."}
{"text":"Holy Schnikees this place ROCKS!!! The burgers are a dream, the atmosphere was fun and they have a great beer selection. The manager checked in and made sure we had a good time. Servings, sauces and selection give this 5 stars! Solid!!!"}
{"text":"I stumbled on this place as I was in Scottsdale for business. Didn't have a taste for burgers but wanted to swing by because of the high ratings. I'm pretty adventurous, so to see a menu filled with all kinds of burger combinations I'd never seen or experienced peaked my interest more. I ordered to PB&J burger with sweet potato tator tots. The burger, to my surprise was pretty good. I really didn't know what to expect but I'd definitely recommend to a friend. It's one of those things that you loved while in the moment but wouldn't try again, like Mardi Gras, lol. The only reason I gave this place 4 stars instead of 5 were the employees at the bar (2 men) where I was sitting. Let's just say they were way more attentive to the hot blonde sitting 4 seats down to pay the other folks at the bar much attention."}
{"text":"Went here last night. They didn't seem busy - however our waitress stopped by at most twice. Didn't ask how anything was, if she had, we would have showed her the medium burger that came out absolutely undercooked and mentioned that I didn't really care for my meal either. I would give 0 stars but that's not an option."}
{"text":"I had the Hatch Burger and Spicy Mac and Cheese Burger. Great food but the service is a little slow."}
{"text":"Love this place!!!!!! awesome food especially if youre hungover..."}
{"text":"Our waitress was awesome... The burgers are awesome and huge.  Definitely get the burger on the pretzel bun.  French fries and sweet potato tots are both good, hard to choose between the two.  Adventurous burger combinations, someone let me know when they try the one with PB&J.    One plus to their beer selection they have a tasty Maui coconut porter, which isn't as gross as you may think.  Nice and stout with a hint of the coconut, add a shot of Vanilla Stoli to give it a bit of a flavor and alcohol boost."}
{"text":"Thanks to Yelp we found this little gem and oh boy! My husband's medium rare burger was perfect and my Wedge Salad with grilled chicken was piled high - crisp and fresh, it was too big to finish! 

For a family of 3 to dine for under $50 was great!"}
{"text":"Never had a bad meal here. Every burger is an art. 2 people can be full from a burger. So watch your potion size. Mac cheese burger is to die for :)"}
{"text":"I really want to like this place, having seen a couple restaurants come in and out of the building. It looks kind of like the Bonfire did inside (previous restaurant), but it has a surfer vibe, and upbeat atmosphere. 

My boyfriend ordered a standard cheese burger, and I had a green salad and garlic bread because I wanted to eat light. My boyfriend eats A LOT of burgers, it is one of his favorite foods, and when he got the burger the bun on the bottom was soggy. As he checked out the sog, I helped myself to some of his fries, which weren't piping hot. It made me suspect that the burger had sat for awhile before they brought it (note to owners). 

My salad was pretty standard, I mean, I did order a green salad so what should I suspect? But, the one thing was that I felt they could have done was sliced the tomatoes. I could tell the tomatoes were the same ones that they used on the burgers, and they just cut them in half, meaning that I had to cut them into tiny pieces myself. I also thought that the cucumbers could have used a chop too. I would suggest cutting the cucumbers and tomatoes into smaller bite sized pieces to make a better salad since that is one of the only fresh/healthy things on the menu. On the first bite of the burger my boyfriend said it was good, but 3 bites later he said something tasted funny and he was not happy. We think it was the onions. He didn't finish the burger. 

I might give this place another try, but I am not sure..."}
{"text":"The Mac and cheese burger was fantastic. I highly recommend it! The service was attentive and the restaurant has a cool beachy vibe"}
{"text":"The burgers here are absolutely outstanding. Definitely give the Sweet Potato Tots a try. The tap is a bit small for my taste (I'm a beer guy), but there's enough available that you can find what you're looking for. We'll be coming back."}
{"text":"Had the backyard bbq burger (pineapple bbq, onion ring, cheese) which was amazing. It is served with a choice of side and I chose Jamaican sweet corn also delicious. Also had Philly cheeseburger the best Philly cheese steak in AZ. Cannot wait to come back and try other burgers and bring the rest of the family and friends. Nice island vibe. Should play ialoharadio.com even better."}
{"text":"The whole experience was terrible from the food to the waitress. We sat outside and waited 15 minutes till Arrow our waitress came out to take our order. Once the food came out everything was cold so we didn't even get to enjoy. She didn't check on us one time after we finished eating so we just sat there until I went in an asked for the bill. I waited another 5 minutes till I went back in and saw her cleaning her tables. I went to the bar and had the bartender print the receipt. I wish I could of enjoyed the experience"}
{"text":"I believe I have went once or so but I order a hot dog with fries and just eat that plain. No complains just a simple girl- simple order. No condiments, no likey. Customer service could be a little better, mostly getting distracted or just busy but overall great."}
{"text":"I have been here twice and both times have been great. They really have a nice service staff & very Attentive! Food is pretty good as well! They seem to be always busy but super glad you are there with them. Well done!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed rehab burger. The quality of the meat is excellent and their burgers are HUGE.  Service is excellent! If you're ever in ritzy Scottsdale I recommend trying Rehab burger."}
{"text":"Great spot for AMAZING burgers. You can dress super casual, even wear flip flops. Thanks Dave for such good service"}
{"text":"I attempted to dine-in but the wait time to be seated was insane. Figured that was a good sign of how tasty the food was so I ordered a Hawaiian burger (rehab size) to go with a side of sweet potato tots. I wandered around town until it was ready, about 20 minutes later. Took the burger back to my hotel. It was HUGE. I'm embarrassed to say I ate the entire thing in one sitting. Super juicy, and the aioli on the side was amazing. The tots were a bit soggy...was like eating fried mush. Also, this experience cost me somewhere around $12-14. A little spendy. But, it was an awesome, juicy burger. Would do a relapse size next time."}
{"text":"This place is great!  Fantastic burgers with a hip atmosphere, reminiscent of \"Hodad's\" of ocean beach, ca. Not because of the hundreds of different burgers, but because of the decor, etc. 

I would say this is the second best burger joint I've ever been to. Number one being Hodad's, and number three being the old Bobcat Bite that used to be in Santa Fe, nm. 

My favorite items are the relapse green chile burger, the street corn, and the onion rings.  Definitely try the pretzel roll buns.

Always fresh, cooked right, and great service, even when it's packed. 

(I hear they may be opening a second location...  lets hope!)"}
{"text":"Omg omg I can't wait to try everything on the menu! They have some very interesting burger combinations that are worth going out of your comfort zone to try! I highly recommend trying the pb&j burger.. sounds gross but seriously just try it before you judge. I was surprised surprised at how weirdly good it was. Also the chili burger... YES! And lastly the mac and cheese burger... So. f'ing. GOOD! I'm afraid ill never be able to order anything else ever again haha. Try this place! Large portions, nice service, comfortable atmosphere and delicious food!"}
{"text":"Place to go if your hungry. Huge burgers that are actually cooked to perfection.  Wings were so delicious we could not stop eating them (Smoky BBQ) I love the turkey burger with side salad and rita. This place was a bit challenging to locate but defiantly worth the drive. Our server did a stellar job as we sat on the patio and enjoyed our Labor Day Weekend.

{"text":"Rehab Burger Therapy is all about the Southern California, beachy, laid-back surfer vibe in the middle of Downtown Scottsdale, AZ complete with palm tree and surfboard-esque decor- which is cute. I mean, they tried it. Overall, I felt that everything was \"fine.\" The 5oz Relapse bacon cheeseburger is a good portion size for me to share and it was pretty standard in terms of taste. Nothing I have to run back to have again. Their fries were very good and they had a little bit of seasoning which I appreciated. Probably the best thing I had. Overall, this place is A-OK, but nothing I'd rush out to take friends to. But they do have off-brand Jawbreakers at the door when you leave."}
{"text":"Had the jalapeño popper burger and the Jamaican corn ! Delicious ! Will definitely be returning , service was great and good amazing !"}
{"text":"Wow! Truly an incredible burger! Visiting from California and came across this place on yelp and had to check it out. I'm so glad I did because it did not disappoint! I ordered the Porkster burger and added deep fried jalapeños. Was loaded with bbq pulled pork, so much I was glad I ordered it with the relapse (5oz) patty. This was the perfect sweet/spicy burger I was looking for! Awesome house made bbq sauce to match. Would definitely be back if I was looking for the best burger spot. Cool vibe as well but super busy. Get their early to put your name in."}
{"text":"Best place ever. We try and eat here once a week. Love sitting out on the patio. Food is great and the service is even better. The owner is there often and you can truly tell they care. Really fun place."}
{"text":"An overdue 5 mo old  review. The place was chill & relaxed, fun decor, frart music, & the service was excellent. Attentive & fast. Good selection of beers & The burgers! Oh so delicious, the exboyfriend & I both agreed it was one of the best burgers we both had in awhile. I can't recall the name of the ones we ordered, I remember one had peanut butter. Yes. Peanut butter! Don't knock it until u try it! The pb just added another taste level to the already tasty pretzel bread bread & flavorful juicy beef burger. Along with the onion rings ...oh my.  I wish this was in my state near my house so I could get my once a month burger fix. I have yet too find a place that delivers one so scrumptious."}
{"text":"Great burger and great service!  We had 4 people that ordered a different burger and they were all cooked perfectly to order and tasted great!  Staff was fun and kudos to Aurturo for the awesome blue cheese sauce!"}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE the food, the vibe and the crowd this joint reels in! Out of 7 visit, this is the only time I dealt with impatience, mostly because of how short staffed they were for Friday around 3:30ish. My server forgot a couple of requests I put on my order, and it took a good 15 minutes to get his attention because he was so occupied with every other party in the room. There was one server taking care of the entire floor, literally (besides the bar). It was unfortunate for the server cause he was bustin his balls, and for my tummy because I waited for my extra add on before eating! My only suggestion would be extra staff on Fridays. Cause I know this place gets packed every Friday, better to be prepared with more staff than having one guy run the show!"}
{"text":"The PBJ and bacon burger is by far the best burger I have ever had. Sounds weird but worth the try for sure. Great prices and great service too."}
{"text":"This place was great.  They went above and beyond to make sure we have a great experience and made sure our drinks were always full.  Burgers were great as well as the drinks and service.  Love the drinks.  Drinks were great.  Have to get more drinks.  And burgers more burgers.  They should make a burger drink shake.  That would be a drink I would get.  Love the drinks here."}
{"text":"And two hours later after my dinner I cannot move from my bed. Not for any other reason that I am completely full and satisfied with the meal I had tonight here at RBT. 

OUr server was perfectly attentive with the right amount of chill, so we felt comfortable in a new place. We were five seconds away from happy hour ending and he let us sneak in our orders so we could knock a few bucks off the bill, score! 

To start we shared the chicken chile lime dip, I think it was called. So good and spicy. Their homemade tortilla chips were really great too. 

I ordered the hangover burger with the sweet potato tots and my man ordered the porkster burger. Thank goodness we ordered the smaller, five ounce ones, because we hardly finished what we got. I wasn't crazy about the tots, but  I did enjoy the sauces that were brought out with them. 

Major props to our server and this place for standing out in this town."}
{"text":"Fantastic burger and sweet potato tots. My only complaint is that I wish they had a bigger beer selection. It has great service too. Very happy I found this place."}
{"text":"Kay, is the best! I've never heard of this place and so me and my friend decided to try it out, absolutely one of the best hamburger joint ever, every bite into everything they have to offer is nothing short of amazing."}
{"text":"Fantastic burger? Sure. 
Great atmosphere? Absolutely. 
Friendly wait staff? Yes sir. 

We enjoyed our meals. I had the No Poblano Burger \"rehab 10oz\" and fries. She had the turkey burger with onion rings. Both meals were delicious! 

We were engaged in great conversation with our server, Devon, (a local AZ). I am glad we were here before the spring training crowd, because I doubt we'd get the chance to talk. 

We will be back to try another burger ASAP!"}
{"text":"2nd and last visit to Rehab.  Horrible service and average food. All 3 meals were delivered with mistakes- none of which were addressed. I'd only come here to have a drink and enjoy the music. You can get a comparable burger at Denny's or much better at Hop Doddy, Shakeshack, or zinburger at a similar price."}
{"text":"Pleased to help this place edge closer to 1,000 great reviews.  And it was the reviews that drew us here, although we were a little suspicious at first.  Next door to a pawn shop?  Check.  On the very outer edge of Old Scottsdale?  Check.  Looks like a bar room?  Check.  Twenty to thirty minute wait on a Tuesday evening even though it looked like there were some empty tables left?  Check.  Would we be disappointed??  NO!  It was FANTASTIC!  Our waitress was very attentive and the food was all great.   The onion rings were some of the best we have had and the burgers were cooked perfectly.  I had the chili cheeseburger and my husband had the bacon cheeseburger.  The sweet potato tots are delicious, as are all of the various dipping sauces they offer.    Caution:  the burgers come in two sizes.  Do not overestimate the size of your appetite.  We both brought a good chunk of our meals home, too stuffed to continue."}
{"text":"Visited again and again.
Rehab Burger is my favorite. 
Had the PB&J burger and as weird as it sounds... It is perfect. The sweet and savory complimented each other perfectly. 

I also tried for pesto sauce for my tots and it was amazing. Another plea... Sell your sauces by the bottle! I'll be your number one customer."}
{"text":"4.5 stars
So we arrived here for lunch after getting off a plane from Detroit.  With surfboards on the wall and TV's with videos of the beach looping on flat-screen TV's, it felt like we had landed in Hawaii and not the middle of the desert! Loved the open-wall style of the restaurant, so you could eat inside but still feel warm breezes. 

Hawaiian and Know Poblano Burgers were tasty.  Almond vodka margarita was strong and helped to reinforce the island theme.  :)  Chipotle aioli was fantastic with the fries.  Sweet potato tots tasted like fried bits of sweet potato pie (too rich for me, and I have a sweet tooth).  I'd recommend if you get a smaller burger (\"relapse\" portion) you make sure to get it medium-rare or rare, not medium, if you like your burger juicy.  Service was somewhat slow at the early side of the lunch rush on a Friday (40 min or so to get food).  Our server was attentive and did a good job with recs."}
{"text":"Very good food! Sweet potato tots are to die for! I was looking forward to trying a burger that I has seen on yelp in a picture, to find out that it is a Sunday special only, but the pulled pork that burger that I did get was amazing, I had a yummy lunch the next day too! Service was good, I was surprised by their uniforms or spaghetti strapped belly shirts, but I guess that is what adds uniqueness to an establishment. The place was packed, so obviously they are doing something right. Very upbeat establishment, but parking was hard to come by."}
{"text":"Burger quality is great and these things are massive. I ordered a 5oz but was brought, and charged for, a 10oz.  If you have a normal-person appetite, split the 10oz with someone for a reasonably priced meal.  The fries were pretty awful though. They should be hot and crispy; these were not. Sweet potato tots also seemed like they had been sitting out for a while. I like my tots with extra crunch. The beach setting was a bit forced and over-the-top...cmon you're sitting in the middle of the desert! Put some good games on the screens instead of electronic fish swimming around."}
{"text":"Burger was delicious , add pretzel bun ! Well worth it! Although it was a Saturday night at 7:00 pm and  the kid working the front told us it would be an hour plus wait and it wasn't . Either people left or he underestimated . But we were seated pretty quick."}
{"text":"Oh so good. HUGE burgers with any twist you'd like. I often do the grilled chicken sandwich which is on amazing bread, or the grilled portobello (Veggie Noogie). If you get a salad instead of fries, you might as well call it two salads, as the sandwiches have loads of veggies too! Fantastic stuff. Biggest drawback is the place is always packed. Tip...Ask to sit along the rail on the outside patio. That's up for grabs and you can sit immediately! Works fine for 2-3 people. Patio heaters make it very comfortable during the colder months. Love it."}
{"text":"Great burgers and great service. I got the mac and cheese burger and boy was it a monster! I loved it and even though I got the relapse, there was no way I was finishing it. My friend got a regular cheese burger and it was very simple (lettuce, tomato, cheese, etc) and she couldn't finish her's either. . And we're big eaters. We visited on a Tuesday night and the place was packed. Definitely coming back soon!"}
{"text":"Ok, if you are looking for something healthy here just don't. That being said , one of the best burgers I've ever had!  I got the Porkster and it was insane. BBQ on top of the patty, inside a delicious pretzel bun with sweet potato tots on the side. Pretty sure my life expectancy dropped 5 years after eating it but I would do it again tomorrow. Every bite of everything I ate was heavenly.  Definitely give it a try! I didn't give it a 5 because nobody is perfect but it's very close for what it is!"}
{"text":"Really good burgers in Old Town Scottsdale. We went on a Wednesday night so it was full but not long wait times. My Backyard BBQ burger was great. My wife's salad was enormous. Don't need appetizers, and you will leave most of potatoes."}
{"text":"I had the PB & J with bacon and Sriracha burger and much to my surprise it worked pretty well. No lack of flavor there or on any of their other options from what I could tell. You would have to go in with a serious appetite to finish the rehab size burger but the relapse size was about right - hearty but not so big that you feel sick when you are done. Another thing they did well was the aioli sauces. Creative but not overboard."}
{"text":"I went here based on a recommendation from a friend. I had the bacon and blue burger with fries. The pretzel bun was very good. The burger was average, but the other burgers on the menu sounded good, too. I will go back to try the others."}
{"text":"I've gotta say...this place is pretty good! Huge burgers and the sweet potato tots are to die for! 
Great causal beachy vibe! I had the mike tai (pretty strong) and the bacon and blue burger on a pretzel bun! 
Great quick service!"}
{"text":"This one place I've seen & heard about for some time. I was nervous that the experience would not live up to the hype... But they definitely did. 

The rather small space made for an awkward wait in the door way... But the hostess was insanely friendly and answered any questions we had while waiting. 

There were 3 different meals ordered. First mine was the PB&J bacon burger with sweet potato tots. I have to say that the tots were awesome, and dipped in their teriyaki pineapple aoli made them a perfect side. I highly recommend that combo. The burger was delicious. Sweet, spicy, salty & nutty. I personally loved it... But I know not all will step out of their box for this kind of burger. It was juicy and messy just like a burger should be. I ordered the small which was a 5oz patty and couldn't even eat half. The Ghost burger (10oz) & regular fries were yummy... The best part about the Ghost burger was the generous melted gooey cheese & avocado. I don't know what sorcery they used to make the huge burger stay together & stacked when eating.. But that was great. The fries good, but nothing special in my opinion. The last meal a large Mac Gnarly burger and Jamaican corn. The corn was delicious... But for me it needed more of the seasoning blend & salt. The burger had a great 1000 island dressing, messy, delicious.. And again stayed together very well for a huge burger. 

I'm definitely going back and if you're looking for a great burger check them out."}
{"text":"Man, is this place good. We found them because of a Living Social or Groupon coupon (I don't remember which) and we've been back at least a dozen times. We've tried most of their burgers, and they are to die for. We've never had a bad experience!"}
{"text":"Great ambience & really cool & fun burger selection.If you wanna feel like your by the beach in Az this is the place for you! Good service great burgers!"}
{"text":"Food is bomb, but so one needs to tell Aaron it's not the customers fault he hates his life #gtfoh"}
{"text":"The burgers are awesome. They have so many unique options and all the ones we have tried so far are great!!! The service is always good. Their sweet potato tots are Amazing!!"}
{"text":"The staff is amazing! 
The food is to die for! 
The ambiance is so fun! 
Best Burgers in town, best service around!!!!"}
{"text":"Best burger  & great sides !!!!  Huge and crazy selection like peanut butter & jelly burger.  Nummm!"}
{"text":"Very good burger, had bacon and blue burger on Pretzel bread. I usually don't eat many buns, but had all of this one. Had a Pale Ale with it. All Good!"}
{"text":"Hangover & Porker burger so good !! perfect sweet tater tots Awesome Burgers !!! 
Burgers are around $10 a plates ....fries included  :)"}
{"text":"Seriously the best burger in Phoenix. HUGE portions! It's like two meals in one, so well worth the price. Even on their busiest days the service is fast and friendly. It's in a great location in old town, lots of parking!"}
{"text":"I ate at rehab! It was fantastic! Nicole was my server and she was absolutely the best! I had a great time and I will be back to see her again!"}
{"text":"Tried after reading reviews on yelp for burger places.

It was good, not amazing, but good.

The Mac Narly burger is a spin on a Big Mac, I give it a 3 out of 5. It's got nothing on Culinary drop outs Mac burger.

The onion rings were to heavily battered as I tasted the flour.

The chicken, dip,cheese , soup was ok, like soup with tortilla chips, mah."}
{"text":"Two words- the best!  Sweet potatoe tots with cajon mayo dip awesome!"}
{"text":"After months of hearing about this place, we finally got tinted it this past weekend with some friends.
The wait was quite long, on a Saturday night in March, during spring training, we waiting an hour.  After getting anxious, hungry, and a little hangry, we finally got seated.
Obviously a burger is what we ordered.  Our table ordered the PBJ burger, which had a nice blend of peanut butter, grape jelly, and siracha...and bacon.   We also ordered jalapeño popper burger and a build you own breakfast burger.
The burger itself is a quality piece of meat that hasn't been frozen.  This is one of the best burgers in Arizona, and trust me when I say that I have tried a lot of burgers.
I was a little hesitant, but orders the sweet potato tots...they were nothing short of amazing!
I'm already planning our next trip here...I can't wait!!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff. The burger was kind of dry. We ordered the hangover rehab and asked for medium rare but got medium.   We also ordered the chips and salsa with the guac.  The quac was under seasoned.  I had to add more salt to it.  The salsa was spicy but was pretty good.  

I give it a 3.5."}
{"text":"Disappointing.  Medium rare burgers requested were Cooked VERY well done.  I even considered returning it (which I've never done before) but it took 25 minutes for us to get it in the first place (no wonder it was so dry!) and my stomach was already  grumbling.   The service overall was okay but one weird thing was the waitress ran up to us when our mouths were full and said \"how's the first bites? Delicious? Okay!\" And then walked away before we could say anything.  Maybe we came on an off day but it seems like they are just hiding poorly cooked burgers with a lot of fancy toppings.  I want to add a pro so I'm not just being negative because the staff was nice:  very dog friendly patio, we had 3 different servers bring us water bowls for the pup."}
{"text":"We love Rehab burger the burger are always great tasting and the sweet potato fries a great compliment. My wife and daughter's favorite is the peanut butter and jelly with sriracha."}
{"text":"I have been waiting to try out Rehab Burger! Food and service was fantastic. I came with some friends for happy hour before a spring training game and we had a fabulous time. Drinks were awesome!! And apps were great also. We split the fries, chips and salsa, as well as quesadilla. Can't wait to come back and try more!!"}
{"text":"Best burgers in Arizona! Can't go wrong with the jalepeno popper burger with a pretzel bun"}
{"text":"I love this place! If I lived closer I would be there all the time! Doesn't matter if you get a salad or a burger, you never leave hungry. Very relaxing with a wonderful staff. Even the regulars go out of their way to talk and say hi.  This is one if my favorite spots if Im with my son or just having a beer at the bar. 
Thanx Rehab! :)"}
{"text":"This place is off the hook good. I tried the peanut butter and jelly hamburger and it was actually good!. You're kind of stuff in there like sardines when busy. That's really the only bad thing I can say about it. I've had several hamburgers from there and they're all good."}
{"text":"This place came highly recommended and definitely didn't disappoint. We survived the 20 min wait out in the corral as this place was packed. But mercifully our food was quick to arrive. Bring a healthy appetite, these burgers are freakin good - and huge. One of the best we've ever had. The blue cheese burger has the blue cheese cooked inside the patty and I honestly had a hard time finding it, but it was still delicious. Verdict -our party agreed it was worth it to find this place."}
{"text":"Way over hyped. I was expecting greatness and didn't really get it. Bar is way too big for one bartender to handle plus server tickets for an entire restaurant. Burgers were alright kind of bland though. Order the spicy Mac and cheese and both the burger and macaroni was lacking"}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in while in the area and were very pleased with our experience. Our surver Devin was on his game, friendly, quick and responsive. My husband had the PB&J Bacon burger, super messy, loads of peanut butter and delicious! Worth the mess, the Sriracha gives a little heat with the sweet. I had the Hawaiian burger and modified to my preference with a turkey patty.  Great atmosphere, friendly staff. They were busy however our wait was super short. We'll definitely recommend Rehab Burgers to our friends."}
{"text":"Good-to-very-good burgers at an appropriate price.  It was mayhem to get in (don't hope for a nearby parking space on Farmer's Market mornings) but we did enjoy our burgers.  We both ordered medium well but my wife's had more pink than mine (and she shies away from pink in the burger).  Mine was unique and tasty but not blow-me-away tasty.  My wife said she thought it was very similar to Cild Beer and Cheeseburgers (the restaurant).  We may go again but are still searching for our \"favorite\" new burger spot since relocating to the area last summer."}
{"text":"Only been here once but ambiance was good and staff was very friendly. I got the Mushroom burger with pretzel bread was delicious. Also, get the sweet potato tater tots!!!!!"}
{"text":"Wow!!! Fantastic Burgers! Helpful friendly servers! Great atmosphere! Can't go wrong here!"}
{"text":"Being from outbid town we try as many places as we can when we visit. This place was fantastic.

My gf and I ordered blue cheese infused burgers that were out of this world. Add that to a yummy CaronaRita and cheerful service and you're well on your way to a great meal.

We visited early early for dinner but when we left the place was packed. Looks like a great spot for tourists and locals alike!"}
{"text":"The best burger joint EVER. Wow I was so impressed! My boyfriend and I stumbled across this restaurant after our flight and we were starving. I wish I lived in Scottsdale or could ship it up to Seattle. 

 Has it been awhile since you had amazing service? Well it has been a long time for me. My streak ended here. This was hands down the best customer service I had ever recieved. We were greeted at the bar with a big smile and recomendations. We were served our drinks promptly and Bar tender was amazing. Our drinks were fantastic! Our Bar tender was very informative with her menu! She was nice and attentive and the same with the patrons around us. Thank you so much!

I had the Know Poblano Burger with a Lettuce wrap. The spicy grilled onions were delicious. I ate the whole burger it was so good. I'm so happy they have the lettuce wrap option. I'm a low carb type of gal and they made it so easy!

Drinks were also happy hour priced! Lucky us! Our lunch was somewhere around $30 for 2 meals and 4 Drinks! We left a hefty tip since we were so pleased!

You can't beat the taste, atmoshephere, service or price. If you want a great burger and a great experience, Come here!"}
{"text":"If you're craving a burger while in Scottsdale I recommend this place. We started with an order of chili cheese fries; the plate was piled high with fries smothered in cheese & chili. The fries are skin on fries, the appetizer was delicious. He had the backyard bbq burger, I had the jalapeno popper burger. The backyard bbq burger was like one you would get at a family gathering, it was full of flavor. The jalapeno popper burger was good, the cream cheese under the cheddar tasted so good; we both had sweet potato tots, make sure you order a side or 2 of their sauces for dipping. A server at a table next to us took time to go over the menu & told the table about their most popular burgers which our server did not & I wish he would have because I probably would have ordered the pbj burger."}
{"text":"My poor review of them on Facebook was deleted, and I was subsequently blocked from their page.  So here it goes...  This place had the WORST service that comes to my mind in the past two decades.  My wife and I walked in when they opened for lunch.  (Keep in mind they were not busy at the time.)  Not a single welcome from the staff, so we sat ourselves.  When some of the other staff finally decided to finish hanging-out from behind the kitchen, our order was taken from some obviously hung-over dude who was WAY too cool to take off his sunglasses.  Not only did it take forever to get our food, but the sweet potato tots were bland and terribly soggy.  The burgers were sub-par, and left on our plates not worth taking home.  Our server came to our table exactly three times; to take our order, deliver the slop, and drop-off the bill.  Our drinks were NEVER re-filled.  There is NO HYPE to checkout at this place.  They don't even deserve a single star.  Spend your money elsewhere if you want better food and service."}
{"text":"Thought the burgers were pretty good! Usually not a fan of old town crowd, but this felt more low key and relaxed.  Also had good service, even though it was kind of hard to hear our waiter with the loud music. Dessert was yummy and drinks were good too.  I would return for sure!"}
{"text":"In a nutshell...Friendly & inviting ambiance, outstanding customer service, owners work along side staff to give you a great dining experience, peanut & tree nut allergy considerate, a menu that satisfies everyone from the meat-lover to the health conscience to the vegan to the youngest member of your group, reasonable prices & PHENOMONAL FOOD!!!  Try Rehab Burger Therapy & you'll become a regular!

{"text":"Awesome calamari, awesome burgers, awesome drinks and awesome service. Loved the Reggae music and laid back atmosphere too!"}
{"text":"This place offers a variety of different styled burgers, but just because they're unique looking doesn't make the taste any better.

I loved the atmosphere, customer service, and appetizers. Although this specialty burger joint doesn't deserve 5 stars... the burgers were just \"okay\""}
{"text":"The Burger was pretty awesome! For $16 I thought it was a little pricey but that's just my personal opinion. I would definitely go back, and I do recommend though!"}
{"text":"Wow! This place is soooo delicious. Great prices for the amount of food you get. It's a fun atmosphere, never too crowded!! I had the tuna salad on the wheat roll with cheese... so yummy! My fiancé gets the peanut butter and jelly and bacon burger with siracha sauce!!! I've only had a bite but oh my gosh!!! Everyone needs to stop in and go to Rehab... lol! Best thing since slice bread! :)"}
{"text":"Sprint training is here! It was crazy insane in here on a Saturday afternoon. Wait time for a table was 1hour. We sat at the bar; which turn out to be a pleasant experience. We spoke with several vacationers. 

The bar service was prompt; staff were courteous. I order the relapse bacon cheeseburger on a pretzel bun. Yum! I had a choice of sweet potatoe fries, tater tots, or regular fries. I choose the regular fries. What a burger! I was stuffed halfway thru the meal!

I enjoyed the meal, the atmosphere, and the service!"}
{"text":"We got the bacon cheeseburger and the \"kid-friendly\" mac and cheese, and would totally go back again! The mac and cheese was probably the best I've ever had. Service was prompt and friendly. Would recommend 100%!"}
{"text":"Absolutely awful!!!!. This was my third and last visit. 

First two visits everything was ok. No complaints. But this afternoon 12-6-16 the burgers were overcooked and cooked unevenly. Asked for medium and got well done to rare. Must have been frozen. Had the jalapeno burger and bit into an avacodo shell. A slab of avacodo placed on the burger was not cleaned all the way and it was suppose to be quacamole. My girlfriends burger was cooked unevenly and she could not eat it. The burgers were plain garbage for place that specializes in burgers

We informed the server several times and shortly after a cook came out and began staring at us. This made my girlfriend uncomfortable.

What is more disappointing is that i am on a diet and only have a  burger every now and then. Needless to say we will find another burger place."}
{"text":"This place has really good service and the burgers are tasty. Lots of flavor combinations to appease your palate. We came here with two large families and the waitress was accommodating to the group on a busy sunday afternoon. I would def. eat here again when in need for a great burger!"}
{"text":"Service - Excellent
Side Salad - Nothing special
Calamari - Skip it!
PBJ & Bacon Burger - A MUST!!!

PBJ = Peanut Butter and Jelly, and yes, as a burger with bacon and sriracha. It sounded awful and my bf isn't a fan of peanut butter so he wasn't anxious to try it. But the reviews and our server made it hard for us not to try it and it was AMAZING. The peanut butter part is a bit decieving, it tasted more like a Thai peanut sauce that usually comes with satay. For some weird reason, this combination works very well. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Our waitress helped this group of first timers navigate the menu, select three burgers that were somewhat shareable, and then helped us coordinate our sides so we could try as many as possible! We tried the macaroni and cheese burger, the bacon peanut butter, and the pulled pork. All were stellar!! Will definitely be back when I'm craving a nice, big, flavorful burger! Plus our out-of-town guests were pleased!"}
{"text":"We eat here at least once a month. I have yet to have something I don't love and the wait staff is like family. Their Sunday surprise burgers are always amazing and fun.  Simply the best Burger and food you could ask for."}
{"text":"I absolutely loved the PB&J Bacon Burger.  I would return to Scottsdale just for this burger, no lie.  As odd as this mixture sounds, it was amazing.  The staff was wonderful, prompt, and extremely efficient. 

If you, however are not a big fan of very sweet meals, I wouldn't choose this burger.  (There are plenty of others to choose from).

Rehab also offers a variety of drinks, plus a happy hour!

I'm not sure about the parking as I took an uber here."}
{"text":"Our waiter Rian went above and beyond to accommodate us and the entire staff provided amazing service. I never leave reviews but we are so impressed and satisfied! We are visiting from California and have our puppy with us. We asked to be seated outside but it began to rain.. we were invited in--and even given bacon for our dog. Thanks for the hospitality and excellent food!"}
{"text":"While they have fantastic happy hour deals, I have been both pleased and unimpressed by my food. The first time I had a breakfast burrito and sweet potato tater tots (fantastic) and the second time I had an overcooked, dry veggie burger. Their drinks are extremely well priced on happy hour (which is practically all of the time). My friend had a burger that she was pleased with. 

The atmosphere was fantastic! I highly recommend this for day drinking or meeting a friend. Great for both family and a good time."}
{"text":"I love the wide selection of burgers and the service is always on point! I always make sure to get the jalapeno martini! There's two valley locations to check out and i always have an awesome time here!"}
{"text":"Love, Love, Love this place! Its the day after my dinner at Rehab and Im still thinking about it...maybe I am addicted, cant wait for my next fix! The service was on point, our waitress had lots of recommendations and suggestions on what to order. The inside was decorated with a really fun vibe. The food was bomb! I substituted my burger for turkey burger and it was still awesome. My favorite part was all the dipping sauces the waitress brought over, around six to choose from. I cant wait to go back and recommend this place with 5 stars!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I had the cheeseburger on a pretzel bun and it was sooo good! Can't wait to try it again"}
{"text":"All I have to say, is the PB and J bacon burger is .  We sat at the bar, bartender was super helpful and took really good care of us.  She suggested mixing two wing sauces and it was amazing.  Overall loved the laid back/beach vibe and the food is on point!  Pretty reasonably priced.  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"After years of hearing about this place, I finally was able to experience it. The ambience was perfect for our loud group, the drinks were strong and the burgers were great!"}
{"text":"Our experience with Rehab started before we even got near the place. Meg was organizing a belated birthday get together for myself that turned out to have a lot more people coming than expected. Our guest list topped out at 21 by the time we were ready to set up the reservation. When we found out how big it had gotten, we began to worry we might get turned down. I mean a small place like this reserving 21 seats on a Friday night? Most places would've turned us down or charged a fee to reserve the space. But when Meg called in three days before the event Wylie, one of the owners, made it happen without a single hitch! No charge for reserving the space and no gratuity despite the size of the group. A good way to start an excellent experience.

Once there our server, David, went above and beyond to take care of us. Extremely friendly and took time to chat with us whenever he got the chance. He didn't have any problem splitting the checks for such a big group and did a great job of making sure everyone got the right bill.

The food itself was fantastic as well! I got a Ghost Burger (minus avocado) on a Pretzel Bun with onion rings instead of fries. This thing had a bite to it! Definitely spicy but not to the point it was inedible and the burger was cooked perfectly. The onions were very good. Admittedly the substitution price as a little high for five rings but the rings were very good size and fried just right.

I also got to sample the Reese's Pot Brownie as well. If you order one of these things, I hope you're sharing because four bites and I was beyond done. Lots of brownie and tasted amazing but very very rich in flavor. Would not order this for myself but perfect for groups to share.

All in all we had an amazing time there and the service was spectacular. I love the surfer vibe decor and all the unique burger combinations there were to choose from.  Would come back in a heart beat."}
{"text":"Prices here are great... we got an incredible chicken green chili dip for $9.   Burgers can be made with a 5 oz patty for two or so dollars cheaper... my build your own was $8.75... with a sod Carla's.  Great place to stop when you are in Old Town Scottsdale... fun atmosphere with a relaxed vibe... just loved it."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and enjoyed myself. Both times I had a great bartender named Courtesy who is friendly and helpful. The happy hour is great and both food items I've had have been very good. First visit I had a burger which was awesome and a lot of food. Courtney gave me a few different of their house sauces to try and they were all tasty. Second visit I had a wedge salad that was great on a hot day. Maybe just a tad too much dressing but that's my only complaint. I'll be back when I'm in Scottsdale"}
{"text":"After a full day of walking around Scottsdale, we were hungry for a great burger and discovered Rehab Burger on Yelp. We were not disappointed! Great variety of burgers and plenty of other options for those wanting something else. We were there on a Friday around 7, and it was fairly crowded and noisy, but the great vibe overcame all that. 

Our waiter provided great service, and I really appreciated that he told me to best order my relapse-sized burger cooked medium. I prefer my hamburger not have pink in it but sometimes when I ask for medium-well, the meat is too dry. Medium was perfect. I had the poblano burger with sweet potato tots and it was all delicious. My husband really liked the hatch chili burger.

If we lived in this area, we would make this a frequent eating spot."}
{"text":"Really wanted to try this place today. Had a burger already picked out and everything. Called in to place a pick up order but their phone just rang. We figured they were busy so drove on over at 1pm on a Sunday only to find they were closed. Their hours said they were open and Yelp showed as being open as well. 

*if they were going to close unexpectedly it would've been nice for them to update that on a voicemail message or something"}
{"text":"Great trendy hamburger restaurant.  Great place to people watch in downtown Scottsdale.  Lots of great hamburger combinations with a speciality pretzel crust. I really recommend the appetizer Nelson's Verde Con Pollo, i get every time I am there"}
{"text":"Literally the best burger place in the world!  Their burger meat is very juicy and tastes amazing and they have a long list of unique burgers.  My personal favorites are the spicy Mac and cheese and the PBJ & Bacon burger (I know the latter sounds odd but it's amazing).  I always chose to have mine on a pretzel bun with a side of sweet potato tots."}
{"text":"Love this place! The burgers simply can't be beat and its beachy no-fucks-given vibe is refreshing in old town Scottsdale. Bonus points if you get David as your waiter, been here a million times and service can vary. 

I also suggest BYOB with chicken breast if you're not feelin a burger but honestly you can't go wrong with your order!"}
{"text":"I was disappointed given the very strong Yelp reviews. My opinion is clearly in the minority since we arrived on a Tuesday night in July to a restaurant so a full of patrons that we had to sit outside. Perhaps the combination of the full house and the 4.5 stars on 792 Yelp reviews raised my expectations too high.

The service was a bit slow, which may have had to do with the big crowd in a weeknight, however I wouldn't say it was terrible. The food menu had a wide variety of choices but as a craft beer lover I was disappointed in the beer choices. There were mostly macro breweries with a sprinkling of craft beers, which left limited choices for my taste.  I ordered the pablano burger, which was good but I didn't see why the place was rated so high as I can think of several other places in town that make a better burger. 

None the less I indicated to my girlfriend that I would go back and had already decided on a \"3 star\" Yelp rating as the food was good but didn't blow me away and the service was a tad slow but acceptable.  Then I went to the restroom and discovered that THERE IS NO MEN'S ROOM. They have a ladies room and a family restroom. So I had to wait a LONG time to use the restroom. I will not go back to a restaurant that expects me to spend my money there but will not provide me with a restroom."}
{"text":"Some of the best gourmet burgers around, made and served by people who care.
We've heard of Rehab Burger Therapy for a while now, and finally got a chance to try it out. Wow! The service and the food are absolutely top notch. 
We went on a Sunday night and parking was not a big issue - there is a large free lot right next door. Located in the heart of Old Town Scottsdale, Rehab gives off a relaxing beach vibe with the décor - it's like a cantina in Montego Bay that serves hamburgers unlike any you've had before. Great laid-back ambiance that is enhanced by the friendliness and approachability of the staff. The place is not that big, but the table arrangements are so that you never feel cramped, there is room for everyone to be comfortable.
We told the hostess it was our first time, and they just jumped at the opportunity to treat us like VIP's - even the owner, a super cool dude named Wiley stopped by to say hello. You can tell this is a place where management truly cares about every guest that walks through the door. It's not a corporate or franchise atmosphere - it's a local family-style atmosphere, where you feel like they care more about you as the diner, than just getting you to pay the check. This is rare in today's fast-paced high-turnover restaurant industry, and it sets Rehab apart from the others.
Our server, who was very attentive and funny, took our orders promptly and got us our beers really fast. We enjoyed the funny stories he told us, especially about some guy who ordered 3 10oz patties and topped that burger off with pulled pork & a fried egg and ate the whole thing! Yikes! While I will never order anything like that, I wasn't quite prepared for the monstrous sized portions you get here. While the prices are in the $10-15 range for the burgers, you definitely get value for your money.
We started with some yummy appetizers - chicken wings and \"pig wings\". The chicken wings were the smaller sportsbar variety but they were nice and crispy with a delicious spicy pineapple bbq sauce. I like that the sauce was more of a zesty kick than a burn-your-mouth hot wing. It was perfectly balanced. The pig wings are basically bone-in pork knuckles and are out of this world! The meat was incredibly tender and tasty. We also got a side of the pineapple teriyaki aioli, which was fantastic. I would definitely order those again without thinking twice.

My girlfriend ordered the Chili burger - it was cooked medium as she asked, and she loved it. While I'm not a chiliburger guy, I tried a spoonful of the just the chili and it was quite good, perfectly seasoned.
I ordered the Mac Gnarly burger, medium well and it arrived cooked-to-order (this is important as so many places either under or over cook their patties), and omg this thing was a MONSTER. It was two 5 oz patties, with a bun in the middle too, smothered in aged cheddar & 1000 island dressing. Seriously the largest burger I have ever seen in my life - it was a masterpiece. You'd think this was a fork n knife meal, but being the experienced burger eater that I am, I was able to eat most of it with my two hands. I cannot overemphasize how hugely massive and tasty this burger was. Definitely one of the best I've had. Wow factor x1000. 
The dessert menu has 1 item, and after tasting the pot brownie, they don't need anything else. This was a supremely decadent and carefully prepared delicacy. As stuffed as I was after the Mac Gnarly, this brownie was just too darn good to let my girlfriend eat alone! Needless to say, we went home absolutely satisfied with our meal. 
I highly recommend Rehab Burger Therapy - the quality of the food, the value for the money paid, the quality of service, and the fun relaxing ambiance make this one of the best burger joints in the Southwest. No surprise they keep racking up the awards! When you go...arrive hungry!"}
{"text":"Came in here on a random mid-week night with a few friends. When we got there, we were greeted and seated immediately. Our server was very bubbly and explained every aspect of the restaurant and menu to us. I was incredibly impressed. We all order our food. I got the Rehab BBQ burger (11 oz) and our server recommended the pretzel bun. Food came out quickly and it was soooo good. Hands down one of the best burgers I've ever had. They also had a bunch of awesome dipping sauces and another bottled sauce that's to die for. Everyone I was with loved their food. I was only able to finish half my burger, and I have a big appetite. The fries were great too. It's so nice to find a nicely priced restaurant and bar in Old Town that also has great service and great food. I've already brought friends in again to try it out and they loved it too. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Pretzel bun wasn't worth the risk. I had never had one and decided to try it but I now regret it. I got the jalapeno popper burger but it wasn't that good and I thought it had too much peppery spices on it. It wasn't too spicy, but overpowering taste."}
{"text":"Great place for an amazing burger! Atmosphere was relaxing, felt like was on a beach somewhere. Margarita was delicious and the staff was on point. Very speedy service."}
{"text":"Plus: the burgers are excellent

Minus: the soundtrack switches from 311 to Rebelution

Plus: the burgers are awesome

Minus: beer selection is putrid 

Plus: the burgers are amazing"}
{"text":"Great burger, I had the Philly Cheesesteak burger. The 5 oz is PLENTY! My buddy had the PB & J burger and the sweet potato tater-tots! He said next time he would go with regular fries because the jelly and the sweet tots were too sweet"}
{"text":"Where to begin... This place put me in the deepest food coma my consciousness has ever been (that is a good thing). I ordered the bacon cheeseburger with avocado (rehab size) with a side of sweet potato tots and French fries. While this is a pretty standard order in the food industry, there was something indescribably different about this place. Maybe it was the seasoning, maybe the vibes or music; regardless my experience here was great and I will be returning in the near future."}
{"text":"A little island feel in Phoenix.  Enjoyed the background music mix of Sublime, Bob Marley, etc.  If you want quantity in a burger, then this is the place.  I had a mushroom and swiss with an added fried egg.  It was pretty tasty.  We also ordered the peanut and butter and jelly burger.  Different and unique with a crazy burst of sweet and savory in each bite.  The sweet potato tater tots were pretty amazing though.  The service was excellent.  I just with they had more variety in their draft beer.  I feel in this type of place should have an extensive list of beers on tap."}
{"text":"We ate here during our vacation in Arizona. It was better than I expected. Good food and good atmosphere. The food came pretty quickly but we arrived around 2pm and there was plenty to watch on the flat screens while waiting."}
{"text":"This place is wonderful! Ask about the secret menu! I had the Jalapeño Popper Burger! It was delicious! The waitress was extremely attentive and very knowledgable of the menu. She made a few recommendations about what we were ordering and what worked well together. She right on the money! The sweet potato tots were so yummy dipped in the pesto sauce or the pineapple sauce. Best part....they have the option of a pretzel bun for all their burgers!! I can't wait to bring my husband back to try another burger and enjoy the relaxed, cool atmosphere! I live completely the other side of the valley from Scottsdale, but I think this will become a regular spot for me! It's just that good.  Oh, and the bathrooms were way cool too. Actual towels to dry your hands and real tp, not the scratchy stuff! Impressed!"}
{"text":"Brought my friend here earlier tonight and she loved it! My burger was so delicious as always! And I'm obsessed with the sweet potato tater tots, they are my fav! The vibe here is so awesome and I love everything about this place. Oh and it's always busy so just plan on there being a wait"}
{"text":"Great burgers, awesome sweet potato tater tots! And great service! They have gluten free options too. We have eaten here 2 times and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Bottom line: The most incredible burger I have ever eaten.

Got the Mac and cheese burger, and it far exceeded my expectations, but be ready because it comes with a lot of good homemade Mac and cheese.

Other than that the margaritas are also good and the bartender was very friendly and attentive even though the bar was packed."}
{"text":"Went here yesterday with a couple friends and to be honest, I was quite impressed. 
The staff wasn't too in your face and their burgers were phenomenal. 

We started with some chicken wings that were scrumptious to say the least and didn't last long between the 3 of us. 

A friend and I shared the \"Rehab\" size of the Chili Burger and it was delish. With the Pretzel bun and sweet potato tater tots, I was in love! Although her and I both agreed \" WE WANT MORE CHILI!\" on the burger next time. 

I am now addicted  and the only treatment is more Rehab."}
{"text":"The PB&J is off the chain, don't do it
On your first date unless you can do no wrong in there eyes already"}
{"text":"Great food, awesome service and place was very cute. We sat in the patio and they had water sprays that maintained the area very cool. I ordered the Hawaiian burger with the sweet potato tots and they were amazing! Would definitely come back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Yummy food, good service, and great atmosphere. Relapse burger is a good size, Rehab is huge."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I are regulars here and we LOVE it!!! Denise, one of the owners, is amazeballs! She's always smiling and making sure everyone's experience is a perfect one. I love the vibe! I forget that I'm in the middle of the desert when I step indoors because it feels like I'm on a vacation at the beach. Rumor has it they're opening another location on Mill Ave in Tempe... I wish them all the success there that they've seen in Scottsdale. The place is always packed and I love seeing small, creative business owners succeed! Oh yah, almost forgot... The food is awesome!"}
{"text":"Wasn't a huge fan of my burger. Ordered the bacon cheeseburger. Didn't think the meat had enough flavor. Really wish they offered American cheese because the cheddar didn't bring enough flavor to the already bland meat. The only \"okay\" part of my meal was the sweet potato tots. Those were pretty good. The fries were pretty bland as well. Nothing to write home about here."}
{"text":"Best place for service. My daughter has many food allergies and the staff accommodated everyone of them. Our server Andrea was a STAR. I recommend this place without hesitation. Food was fresh, hot and absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"Great burgers in a laid back atmosphere.  The burgers are creative - we ordered the Spicy Mac-and-Cheese burger and the Jalapeño burger both of which were cooked to perfection.  The burgers come either in 5oz or 10oz sizes - we got both in the 10oz, which was a bit much for lunch - would recommend the 5oz unless your really hungry.

The fries are good - but would suggest substituting for the sweet potato tater tots.  They come with an aioli dipping sauce which is a nice combination."}
{"text":"I have to admit this is a fantastic place!  Ambience, burgers, fries, service. It was all good. I came here with a client and wished I was here hanging with friends having a beer. Very comfortable!"}
{"text":"This is my second time around at this place and I must say it did not disappoint. The last time I came here was on my 40th birthday but for some reason   I remember the burger having more more flavor back then. The burger tasted a little bland so I added some salt & pepper and that fixed the problem. I ordered the Relapse Hatch burger medium well and it was Huge, juicy, and delicious.  My wife ordered the byob burger, mayo, tomato, onion, cheese, and she said it was great. I went there with my whole family and they ordered all kinds of stuff it was ridiculous. The peanut butter and jam sandwich was huge/delicious, hot wings- good and so was the Alfredo San Carlos pasta. If you go here make sure you bring your appetite because there are no small portions served. The best thing about it was the price because there was 12 of us and the bill was 110 bucks and we had 4 to go plates left over. The only thing that I can complain about here is the wait and bathrooms. Sometimes the wait is 30 mins long or more and the bathrooms are small."}
{"text":"I first came here over a year ago.  I was super excited about the gluten free buns and the sweet potato tots.  It was delicious.  I've been several times since then and the past couple of times, I have been drastically disappointed.  The burger has been dry and the sweet potato tots have been sgggy and smooshy.  The fries were good, so I switched.   I have recommended this place several times, but I'm hesitant to recommend it now, especially to out of town guests."}
{"text":"I'm not really a burger guy, but I was with a bunch of guys who were probably not into \"ethnic\" food.  We were in Old town Scottsdale, and as much as I was trying to steer everyone to italian food, they weren't going for it.  We ended up here.  It's kind of weird place, I thought it had a great vibe, but the rest of my group didn't.  One guy ordered the peach beer which was terrible.  I got the sweet tots for an appetizer, which were really good.  You could also get it as a side for a burger.  I ended up with a turkey burger, which was okay.  I got a side of onion rings with it as well.   The rings were only alright.  The rest of my group had burgers, which they said tasted pretty good, but nothing out of the ordinary for the cost of the burger.  My group didn't like the beer selection, I'm a fan of the four peaks beer, so I wasn't complaining about that.  All in all, it was a pretty average experience."}
{"text":"Great burgers! Fab onion rings! Great servi ce. I would make this a definite return place. We started with sweet potato tots and dips. The know poblano burger was great...best burger ice had in years."}
{"text":"Place was great - communal table was fun - service good.  Food tasted just fine - THEN 1a.m. both of us were sick sick sick sick.  Not fun anywhere especially in a motel, while traveling, and needing to hit the road by 7a.m."}
{"text":"What can be said that hasn't already been said? Great food, fun environment, good service - there really wasn't anything bad about it. We had a hot dog, a plain ol' cheeseburger and a hatch burger  - all if which were delish. The fries have a unique salty/spicy flavoring that drew me in and I couldn't stop eating them. Also tried the sweet potato tots and the chips and salsa. The chips and salsa was some of the best we've had in Scottsdale, hands down! The tots were a fav with our kiddos. Our daughter told the waiter she was giving this place \"21 stars\" -- We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"If you go home hungry, its your fault.  This place reminds me a little bit of Hodad's, a hugely popular burger joint in the Ocean Beach neighborhood of San Diego that emphasizes a laid back beach style atmosphere with crazy burger concoctions.  Seems like owners Ken Likewise, Denise Nelson, and Wiley Arnett had something like that in mind when they opened this place in 2012.  And being that all three owners are former Oregano's execs, the food portions at Rehab are (like Oregano's) somewhat ludicrous.  Seeing that so many fellow Yelpers have been here with such positive results, a lunchtime stopover seemed long overdue.

Located in Old Town Scottsdale on 2nd Street just east of Scottsdale Road, Rehab is hard to miss.  The beach style decor, outdoor patio, chill background music, and stacked bar all beckon you in (you could be forgiven for at least initially thinking you were walking into a tourist trap).  I came at opening expecting the Saturday lunch crowd would quickly swell (which it did), and grabbed a spot at the bar inside.  There's seating for probably 75 inside and another 25 out on the patio out front altogether.  Plenty of TVs here if you want to come and watch a big game.  Otherwise you can just admire the surfboards, beach cruisers, and other beach themed decor on the walls and ceiling.

As other Yelpers have noted, Happy Hour extends from opening all the way to 6pm so plenty of opportunities for cheap eats and drinks earlier in the day.  They also have a $4 chips and salsa Yelp check-in deal (just over $1 cheaper than their normal price), but I wasn't here for chips and salsa.  I did grab a $1.75 can of PBR, well, just because.  But the burgers were the real driving force here.  Take your time deciding though as there's at least two dozen burger options by my count.  And that doesn't even count the different burger sizes, buns, and sides options.  One burger that immediately leaped off the menu for me was the Porkster.  I like pulled pork, I like BBQ sauce, I like beef, and I like cheddar cheese.  And yes I would very much like to try all four at once in between a bun, thank you very much.  I chose the house brioche for my bun as I love brioche.  My side of choice was the sweet potato tater tots.  Total cost for the beer, the food, tax and tip came to $20.

I should note that I ordered the Relapse size burger, which is the smallest size they offer. The Rehab size is twice the size of the Relapse for only $2 more, but after seeing my meal, I'm sure glad I stuck with the regular.  This thing was huge.  Overloaded with pulled pork and copious amounts of cheddar cheese.  The bartender alertly gave me a big stack of napkins with my meal knowing this would be messy.  I had to chip away at some of the loose pulled pork (which was solid by the way), before I could attempt to grab the buns with two hands.  That first big bite was awesome.  Great mix of beef flavors and the bun was perfect.  I also liked the tater tots (including the sauce it came with, which I believe was a chipotle ranch).  I had absolutely no room for dessert this go around as I was totally stuffed.

So I'll reiterate what other Yelpers have said and confirm that yes, the hype is well deserved.  The portions are huge, the staff is friendly, the atmosphere is super chill, and the menu is as inventive as it is expansive.  If this is what Oregano's looks like in burger form, chances are the owners of Rehab will be here for a long time (and likely opening more locations in the near future).  Time for me to go to rehab, for a food coma."}
{"text":"Literally, top 5 best burgers I have ever had.

I had the macaroni and cheese burger with green chile. It was phenomenal. I go back through my pictures on my phone to glance at this burger because I am constantly craving it. Also, my first time having mac and cheese on a burger, and sweet potato tater tots. 

I am from New Mexico, so I can't tell you how happy I was to hear that they use green chile from Hatch, NM! The burger was cooked perfect, the mac and cheese was amazing, and the green chile had a nice kick. I was pretty determined to finish the entire meal, but ended up only eating about half (Yes, I took the rest to-go and finished it later). Service was great, I believe our server's name was Lauren, or \"Lo\" - she was awesome. Probably some of the best service I have experienced in a long time. She was super attentive, always filled our water cups quick (it was hot), and made great suggestions. We didn't have to wait for a table either, and we went on a Friday night around 7pm. I think I will make the drive to Scottsdale specifically for this burger."}
{"text":"This was the first time I have ever been to Rebab, and as I sat there looking at the menu and saw other people's burgers coming out, I was super excited and impressed at the size of the burgers. However, when my Hack Burger came out, it was HALF the size of the others, dry, overcooked, the bacon I requested was missing (as well as the extra aioli sauce I requested) and the waitress brought me the wrong beer as well. She didn't earn a good tip that's for sure, since apparently refiling water was too hard as well. 

Although I was not impressed with the service or the burger they brought me, I will say that I think I just had bad luck because my boyfriend's burger was amazing and much more what I had originally expected to get. If I had gotten his burger, I would have been leaving 4 or 5 stars. Give this place a chance, but don't be surprised if you have mediocre service or have to ask them to fix your order."}
{"text":"Rehab was the first place I discovered the art of putting fried egg on your burger. The hangover burger (Fried egg, bacon, colby jack cheese and hatch green chili) is on point--whether or not you were overserved the night prior. Great staff and comfortable (albeit island inspired) setting. Extra credit for it being a local business!"}
{"text":"Believe the hype, this place is 2 legit to quit! Went here New Years day, with my massive hangover in tow,  because LOLO's had a 45 min wait. Lucky for me we were sat immediately.  Our server was pleasant and quickly brought all our drinks. The most notable of drinks were the chocolate milk shake and bloody mary; both were exceptional. 
Our table ordered a Poblano burger (relapse size), Hatch chili burger (turkey patty) and hangover (rehab). 
All burgers came cooked to order and were A-mazing. I had the relapse size Poblano burger with onion rings and couldn't finish it so don't worry about not having enough food! 
I had a bite of my husbands Hatch turkey burger that was equally as good! He said he didn't miss the beef one bit because the turkey burger was just as juicy and flavorful.
If I had to complain it would be about the onion rings and lemon pepper on the fries. 
The onion rings are thick with more batter than I prefer as I like a crispier onion ring that is more about the onion than batter. 
The actual fries are great but they sprinkle lemon pepper on them. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't good either. 
Both of these complaints are just a personal preferences and have nothing to do with the way they were cooked or quality of the food. 
Next time I will just get the fries without the lemon pepper : )
I would love to see them add regular tots to the menu for those who are not a fan of sweet potato tots.
All in all, it was a great meal and I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"This burger joint is pretty awesome. Very casual, family friendly, yet at the same time got the beach bar/sports bar vibe. Friendly staff and lots to choose from on the menu. Got some crazy burgers like spicy mac n cheese, pb&j, the hangover, etc. I went with the jalapeño popper on pretzel buns, 5oz, with potato fries. My burger came with guac and fried egg. Mm mm, SO good. 4 different sauce they give you on the side are amazing too. My favorite was the spicy ketchup. Overall, I left the restaurant feeling full, satisfied, and happy."}
{"text":"I really liked my burger.  Good quality.  My husband got the larger \"rehab\" size patty while I got the smaller \"relapse\" burger.  His burger seemed a little bit too large and was extremely messy.   Since my burger was also a good size + a lot easer to eat I was glad I went with the smaller option.

Call me a stickler, but I was really bothered by the fact that some of the employees were wearing flip-flops and other open toed shoes in the kitchen.  I know that laid-back beach style is sort of a thing here....but really?  What other gross health code violations are going on back there?

All in all I liked the place, I like the food, but I can't make myself go back in light of that one little thing (inappropriate footwear) especially when I can find many other burger places to get a good burger."}
{"text":"Last Sunday I went here for the 2nd time. This place seems always busy. The burger was so good and the sweet potato tots was absolutely amazing!!! Rocco was our server. He is the best. He was really nice to us and I usually have specific order but he got it right. Definitely come back to this place !!!"}
{"text":"5* Customer Service is Exemplary/Awesome here!!

Stopped by on a rush lunch near an appointment only 45 minutes out. When we asked whether we would be able to complete our lunch in the allotted amount of time, we were informed that, after ordering, it would only take 15 minutes to receive our food. So, we went for it. After a table was cleared and care taken to properly clean it (very nice touch) we ordered drinks and looked through the menu. I ordered a Hatch chili relapse (single) cheeseburger (which comes with a choice of sides like onion rings, salad, etc.) and hubby ordered the fish tacos. His was the better dish. While my cheeseburger was really tasty (the beef is incredibly good) the chipotle sauce got lost on the pretzel bun (sauce was only found on the top bun) and I could only taste it in one bite. Overall, I would say that the burger was nothing special. However, the fish tacos (the byline under this menu item states, \"We don't need no stinkin' badges!\") were excellent!! We went over our allotted time by only 2 minutes; everyone who served us went out of their way to get us in/out the door in a reasonable amount of time, and we enjoyed our meal. The only cautionary note is that the noise level is `quite loud' and one toddler who came in with her parents seemed not to be able to tolerate it well and added her crying to the general noise level."}
{"text":"Best burger joint around.

Ever been to Slater's 50/50 for the PB&J Bacon Burger?  Thought that was good?  Wait until you try it at Rehab!  Oh yeah, they added Sriracha to the mix...what a great idea! 

What else - how about the spicy mac and cheese burger?  Wow!  You could make a meal just with the spicy mac and cheese that comes with the burger, and you would say, 'That was great!', but add it to a burger, and a side of sweet potato tater tots with dipping sauce pairings?  Amazing.

Cool vibe in Old Town Scottsdale - park in the big lot east of the restaurant.

This is one rehab where you want to check in - not check out!"}
{"text":"This is a really nice place for chilling and eat, my friend and like it so much.

Environment: it's pretty chill in here, I decide to sit outside for my meal, the lights and high tables are cute. 

Appetizer: I ordered the onion ring. I would say the onion ring here is a must have if you come over, I haven't seem this huge of onion ring in my life, super satisfied!

Burger: I order the spicy Mac&cheese burger, side with sweet potato. Mac&cheese has crunchy bacon on top, the burger portion was so huge, 5 oz is definitely good for 2 people. Sweet potato is so good with their homemade special sauce.

Service: my waiter was so friendly, he come to check on us like three times, he gave advices on the choices. I left my cigarettes on my table, he ran and gave it back to me. Love him! 

I'll recommend this place to all of my friends."}
{"text":"Would've have given it four stars but:

1) I placed an order for pick up. Got there and waited for the server, Lexi, who didn't show up for 10 mins so another server tried to help me and got me my food. Then kept waiting because apparently only she could take my payment! I was annoyed so in fact I asked another server \"do y'all not want me to pay?\".. Finally a third server took my card over to Lexi who then took my payment 

2) they didn't give me any plastic ware or napkins or anything 

3) disappointed with the sweet potato tater tots

The veggie burger was delicious! I asked them to give me crispy onions instead of lettuce and tomatoes. Loved it!! It came with some sort of dipping sauce - I think cilantro lime which was super duper Yum as well!

I probably paid about $12 for the burger excluding gratuity. 

Got to the place on a Wednesday evening at 6pm and it was packed! Looked like a fun place to hang out at. Very very casual decor."}
{"text":"We were in Scottsdale on business and took our casual client here.  The inside is a fun decor with a smiling wait staff. Most of us had different kind of burgers, fish sandwich & pasta.  All the food was delicious.  There is a good selection of drinks and beer.  Even though it was a business dinner this place certainly made it so much fun!"}
{"text":"Great service, great menu, great quality. In town for few days. Took a shot from Yelp! suggestions. Highly recommend. Only thing - if I had to find one....I got a choice between a 5 ounce and a 10 ounce burger. I chose the ten because the five was just too small for a guy my size. Whoa nelly, that was a hunk of meat. Probably more than I needed. But boy, I left there well fed and happy. Also, my wife got the black bean burger. Said it was about the best she's ever had."}
{"text":"This restaurant was tasty for lunch. My husband had a burger and beer, and I enjoyed a delicious salad. The salad was large and each topping was fresh. It's not always easy to find a place that makes a sizable and yummy salad. I would happily dine here again. The weather was so pleasant when we visited that we enjoyed lunch on the patio, another highlight."}
{"text":"Yes! Love the scenery and the burgers were amazing! I have to get gluten free options which they had. Gluten free bun was good, it doesn't just fall apart like at other places. Burger was huge and it seems priced well. The French fries were really good as well. Our sever, Hanna was very nice and accommodating. 5 stars, we will be back to enjoy drinks and burgers!!! Come here if you are hungry and want to be full/satisfied."}
{"text":"Ok. 
Just had a crazy good burger. Here it is:
10oz of beef, pretzel bun, delicious good thick bacon, sirachi, and .... Wait for it .... PEANUT BUTTER AND JELLY!!!  
Crazy but off the hook good!! The spicy nutty sweet flavor was harmony! My son Jack (PB&J and burger guy would love this)
Love it!"}
{"text":"Ended with really bad food poisoning from it. The reviews were great and the food was tasty but not worth it with such bad food poisoning."}
{"text":"Seriously good food!! The French fries are okay, but the burger was stacked high, juicy, well cooked to how you ask, and delicious! Truly a gormet burger joint. The ideas and amounts of burgers are amazing! A little hard to locate at first, but once you find this gold mine, it'll be worth the time and money."}
{"text":"Salty...every thing. I was not impressed.  Service could have been better but was not badd."}
{"text":"Tasty burger and the tots are amazing!  Service is good, they have turkey burger options that are quite tasty."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE ROCKS. Eat there about once a week now. The Hangover Burger on a pretzel bun with deep fried corn on the cob and $1.50 PBR's cannot be beat. I travel a lot, I always come here the night I get home. The staff is the best. The food is the best. The atmosphere is the best. Instead of a bowl of mints at the door, there is a bucket of jawbreakers. Classic!"}
{"text":"Had the Jalapeño Popper burger on the pretzel bun with the sweet potato tots. Overall tasty. The peppers didn't bring much heat and the guac was a bit heavy on the burger. But would definitely recommend and eat again."}
{"text":"I swear I used to LOVE this place.... it used to be amazing, but fast foward to three years later I really feel the quality has gone extremely down hill. I'm  sure I will probably never come back. But if you're new to it, and don't know what it used to be, you might like it. I might go into detail later, but all I will say for now is...you can do better
Last thing... do not be fooled by the sauteed mushroom swiss burger!!! They do not know what Sautee  means,  they actually mean warmed up mushrooms"}
{"text":"I had the BBQ burger with pretzel bun and  tater-tots sides with spicy ketchup. Good food, kid friendly environment. Lol like the beach atmosphere. Staffs are awesome."}
{"text":"discovered this place while waiting to pick up a friend from Scottsdale Healthcare!  Amazing place!  We only had a short time sort we ordered appetizers.  We had the quesadilla with chicken which was HUGE and cheesy, and the calamari.  Calamari is for me sort of a barometer of how good everything else on the menu might be, and usually I'm disappointed, but not here.  It was a little different than your normal calamari in the breading, but it was perfect!  Cooked perfectly, not too chewy and had a really nicely flavored marinara sauce to go with it, and two lemons, which is nice.

I saw some of the burgers go by our table and they looked amazing, big and juicy.  I wish we had more time so I could have had one.  Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Well...FINALLY...made it to Rehab! (That sounds funny) Been wanting to drop in for a while but it took my daughter and her boyfriend inviting me to actually get it done and WOW was I floored. The place is my kind of joint, beachy casual environment with friendly service.  My daughter got the Hangover (love the egg), he got the Macncheese burger (insane) and I got the Elvis....Win!  All the burgers were great but we all agreed the Elvis was the hands down favorite. Double patty with PB, chocolate, and caramelized bananas.BAM!!  Pretty sure it's only served on the weekend. Get the sweet potato tots...you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is a great find! A bit off The main strip of Old Town Scottsdale, which makes for a great location, free parking round the back to boot. My boyfriend got the Pescado Barracho and he loved it, his only complaint was that they gave him a lot of fish, so he had some left over, which isn't a real complaint. I was a bit adventurous and got the PBJ Bacon Burger and it was awesome! Great service, great food - we'll definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Place was so awesome. You felt like you were dining by the beach. Staff was super nice and friendly. Peanut butter/jelly bacon burger was delicious."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere with great food. You can't go wrong with any of the burgers. Good happy hour. Don't eat at a chain of this is nearby."}
{"text":"First time and loved this place in hooked you get what you paid for I will be coming back"}
{"text":"The food was amazing. The burger quality and size for the price is top-notch. I left completely full which rarely happens at restaurants. I wanted to try their dessert brownie but was so full after lunch that I went back the next day just to get the brownie and a beer. Great food, friendly staff. I highly recommend Rehab Burger."}
{"text":"The Porkster plus green chili, you'll never go back to another burger. Side note, the Sweet Serrano dressing is phenomenal."}
{"text":"I love me some burgers and this place has some great burgers! It can get busy at certain times and its not very big so if you don't want to wait plan accordingly. 

If you are a fan of a good burger this for sure is a place you should try out."}
{"text":"We stumbled on this place after going to a museum.  It was delicious!  I had the tacos with pulled pork, the pork was tender, moist and soooo good!  My husband tried the Philly burger..he did end up eating the philly cheese steak portion separate from the burger as it got a bit messy, but told me it was delicious all the same.  Would definitely go again. They had an extensive burger menu with lots of interesting choices."}
{"text":"Rehab fully embraces the idea that fried foods play a critical role in comforting society from hangovers and bad days. I showed up because Pig & Pickle had a gas leak, and quickly scanned Yelp for an alternative.

Rehab lets you throw a veggie patty, or any patty (turkey, chicken, etc.), on any burger. So the menu felt expansive. Look closely enough at the huge menu and you'll find endless puns about rehab. 

The ghost burger wasn't spicy. Maybe because it used \"ghost pepper jack cheese\" instead ghost peppers. I'm not even sure what that is. The \"relapse\" (two patties) was too much patty; I'll put that one on me. 

But the patties themselves were not so great, which was disappointing because the menu called it hand pressed. The guacamole was a disaster, too, emblematic of the American avocado craze gone too far. I only finished about a quarter of my burger before calling it quits. 

I will say that the bun was decent and the sweet potato tots were worth the upgrade.

My favorite part of the night was when I was talking with my friend about kids while eating at the bar. A complete stranger waiting at the bar looked over and said, \"Whoa man you don't want kids. See that girl over there? I knocked her up and now I gotta support her, and she isn't even that hot.\" I looked over at him, then down at my burger, uncertain how to respond. I guess burgers and alcohol bring out the honesty in people. It also made me realize that Rehab was probably more bar than burger.

The service was pretty slow . One bartender had to manage fifteen people's food orders, plus all the drinks for the restaurant. I felt bad for him; he was certainly overworked.

If I come back, I'll take the burger into my own hands. I expect to request some toppings combination of fresh jalapeno, onion rings, BBQ sauce, extra ghost pepper jack cheese, hot sauce, etc. Maybe that will do the trick."}
{"text":"Yummy. My son's first burger and he's 14.  He ordered the mac and cheese burger and we split it. The mac and cheese was so good.   It had a kick to it.  My younger ones had a grilled cheese and bbq wings.   Both were so tasty.   The wings also had a kick. It was sweet, tangy and spicy.  Just the way we line it. The outside had a crunch yet moist inside.   The grilled cheese was in thick pieces of bread, like Texas toast.  Great crunch. Cheesy. Your choice of any cheeses. We also had a side of sweet potato tots.  Those were also very good.   Very good customer service. It was busy and our waiter kept up very well.  No errors at all and friendly."}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp. We had the mushroom and Swiss and the poblano burgers. Both were very tasty and yummy. The interior has a beach like atmosphere that makes you feel like you are on vacation."}
{"text":"A-M-A-Z-I-N-G Burgers here.  Cute atmosphere and great service.  Will definitely be visiting again soon!!!  Wish you had a location in N. Phoenix.

THANKS!!!"}
{"text":"Eh, wanted to see for myself what the hype was all about. The burgers here are normal and nothing to scream about. They do have pretty insane flavors like a PB&J burger, which was pretty good. However the meat is mediocre and the ingredients are alright. I was hoping it would be fresher. The side salad was mostly lettuce and the pomegranate dressing just tasted like vinegar. Service can be better also."}
{"text":"My husband wanted a good burger and we decided to branch off from our usual favorite, ZinBurger. Rehab is quite a drive for us but well worth it!

Fun atmosphere, although a bit warm inside for us. The hostess and waiter seemed to really enjoy working there. The hamburgers and chicken burgers were fantastic! How great that there are bun choices, the pretzel bun being a unanimous favorite. Three of our group liked the fries, but I didn't particularly care for some spice on them (chili powder?), which is a slight bummer since I'm the fry-person in the family. But I was very happy with the onion rings and will try the sweet potato tater tots next time. The waiter even said he'd let me try a tater first to see if I liked it... what great service! Too bad I was way too stuffed to shovel in another bite. We will definitely be back; only wish it were closer to home."}
{"text":"We have tried about 4-5 of their burgers now. First off yummy!!!! The unique varieties make it an experience. 4 stars because I personally ordered medium rare but the burger felt dry to my taste. My colleagues all loved their burger and did not have the same complaint. Also 4 stars because the burger architecture made it so it did not hold up well while eating, the burger was half in my hand and half on the plate. 

Overall burgers were good not great and no where near my favorite place. You should patronage this establishment for sure, I will continue my search for the beat burger joint elsewhere."}
{"text":"Rehab burger is your total local dive bar but has a cool vibe to it as well. They offer great drink specials, and have a great burger menu. I had there Hangover burger with the sweet potato tots and to me it was pretty mediocre plus I ordered my burger medium rare and received a well done burger so of course I am sure that had something to do with the taste. Would I go back and give em another shot? Probably not considering there are alot more great burger joints in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"This is a great place to grab beer and a delicious burger.  There are tons of burger selections and you can expect it to be busy.  
Def come with friends and hungry cause you'll leave satisfied."}
{"text":"Fantastic burgers and service. The wait is usually a little long but for great food that's understandable."}
{"text":"This is hands down my favorite place to grab a beer and burger! The atmosphere is perfect and the music can't get any better. Their burgers are huge and amazing and food/drink prices are on par. 

FYI their porkster is the best damn burger!"}
{"text":"Rehab Burger Therapy is fun.  The atmosphere is very bright and friendly and you feel good as soon as you walk in.  The service is quick as well.

The food is great.  I had the hangover burger and it was fantastic.  The food is in no short supply either, as I was unable to finish my meal.

Prices are appropriate for what you get.  It's not a steal, but it's not overpriced either.  Overall, very happy with my experience."}
{"text":"Ok so this joint is pretty good. The atmosphere is more of a Cali scene. With Sublime playing and surf boards all around.. it's a small space but they do have outdoor seating available.

Side note: I found out they do not take reservations for a party of 2 for indoor seating. But I'm assuming for large groups there is reservations available.

Now on to the burgers. I got the Philly Cheeseburger 5oz, and Hubs got the Ghost Pepper 10oz. We loved the burgers. Nice and juicy cooked the way we liked/wanted The Philly is amazing basically what it sounds like. I definitely paid more attention to my burger than my fries. But they were good too.

Surprisingly the ghost pepper had a kick to it for the hubs. Which is very rare. This is the guy who likes triple jalapeños on his sandwich and burgers with them being stuffed jalapeños and pepper jack cheese. So he gave it a thumbs up!

Now I know where to go, to get some good burgers!"}
{"text":"Just about the best place to get a burger in Scottsdale!  Fun environment with friendly bar staff. Can be tough to get a table but you can't blame them for being awesome!  Everyone should go!"}
{"text":"Wanted  to try something different what a Very nice surprise. Enjoyed a Porkster with Dennis a great share burger"}
{"text":"LONG wait that really wasn't worth it. I liked the idea of the pretzel bun but it wasn't executed well. Poor service."}
{"text":"I recently went on a trip to Scottsdale and hit this place up again.  I can't even say enough about this place it seriously is so good.  Everytime I go to Arizona the family wants to go here.  This time I got the pbj&bacon burger.  I know it may sound gross but it is so good I crave this burger.  My hubby got the Mac Gnarly burger and he absolutely loved it.  My boys got classic bacon cheeseburgers and they were in heaven.  Trust me this place is so so so so amazing!!!!"}
{"text":"My first time at Rehab. A stranger that I met months boasted about this place having one of the best burgers in town. Specifically she told me to get the PBJ which I thought sounded gross. I tried it anyway (smaller version) and it was interesting and fairly tasty. Unfortunately, the burger that I requested to be cooked \"medium-rare plus\" was more medium-well (see pic) so I didn't enjoy it as much as I probably would have had it been cooked as ordered. Nonetheless, the onion rings were good and the service was cool so giving it 4-stars. Total bill (including $4 tip and almost $7 Stella that I ordered) was $24.24. I would take a 1/2 star away if I could since that's kinda a lot for a meal that I didn't fully enjoy or consume."}
{"text":"The. Best. Burger. I've ever had. In. My. LIFE! The boyfriend and I were in Phoenix for a vacation over Memorial Day weekend. Burgers are our thing so I looked into what Arizona had to offer. I came across Rehab on Yelp and saw it was the highest rated place around us -- of course we decided to come.

We sat outside on the patio, it has a laid back and welcoming ambiance. For starters, we ordered the Chili Con Fritos and Nelson's Verde Con Pollo. Both to die for! The Chili Con Fritos is a dream for anyone experiencing an oh-so-unfortunate hangover. Nelson's Verde Con Pollo is SPICY! But the flavor that comes with it is well worth it!

I ordered the Spicy Mac & Cheese burger on a brioche bun. I forget the name of my boyfriend's burger but in addition to the 10-ounce beef patty, it was topped with shaved rib-eye and a wasabi ranch dressing. He ordered his burger on the pretzel bun. And as I mentioned before, both burgers came with a 10-ounce beefy patty. You can choose a 5-ounce patty, \"the relapse\" if you prefer a smaller portion.

As soon as I took a bite of my burger, I looked at my boyfriend and said \"This is the best burger I've ever had in my life.\" Something I never thought I'd say, just because I eat so many burgers! But man, this burger had everything. The flavor, the texture, the crunch, the bursting spice of the poblano peppers --- I couldn't ask for more!

Each burger comes with a side --- sweet potato tots or fries are included in the burger price. You can upgrade to various other options if you wish. I chose the sweet potato tots and I am SO GLAD I did. I also had the pesto aioli and chipotle aioli for dipping. They tasted best dipped in the pesto aioli...or maybe the chipotle aioli...I can't decide! It was all just so good!

We topped off the night with the Pot Brownie. It was made with both Hershey's chocolate and Reese's peanut butter cups, topped with marshmallow fluff and ice cream. Oh my goodness. Who came up with this?! Genius, I tell you.

Later on that night, as I was doing my own random burger research (yes, that's how much I love burgers) I came across an article that listed the best burger joint in every state in America. Funny enough, Rehab was the best in Arizona. :)

Needless to say... I WILL BE BACK! I will refer anyone and everyone, and I will gladly speak HIGHLY about my experience at Rehab."}
{"text":"Scottsdale location messed up our take out order for the 3rd time--I'm over this restaurant."}
{"text":"The worst service of my life! If I could give them less than one star I would. It took thirty minutes to get a waitress and forty five minutes to get water. Tons of waiters and waitresses but nobody seems to know what is going on. I am never coming back and would never recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Great sized burgers, large Dr. Pepper drinks, and pretty good fries."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!!! Burgers are huge!! and absolutely delicious!!!

The service is always impeccable, and the staff is super friendly!
They are usually packed, but even then, food still gets delivered in a couple of minutes. About 10 minutes.

I go to school nearby so I try to come here as much as possible!"}
{"text":"We waited an hour to get in to this joint the other night but the wait was worth it. The burgers were excellent. Our server, Shawn, was friendly, funny, and very capable of dealing with a hungry crew of 10. The restaurant was packed so the service was a bit slow, but the food was worth the wait. We recommend the PBJ burger. I had the chicken sandwich which was excellent. Another friend said the Caesar salad was AWESOME. Lots of choices for even the most finicky of eaters. I wouldn't recommend it for the kids though. We bought our 3 year old and although the choices on the menu were ok for him, there is no kid menu. The restaurant is loud and raucous which is great for a night with friends, but not really for kids. Outside where we sat is mostly high tops so it's hard for kids to sit on chairs that high without worrying they are going to fall off. It's like constantly worrying about your drunk friend falling off the chair, except they aren't drunk..and is 3. LOL. Anyway, we are looking forward to going back for a grown-ups night soon! :)"}
{"text":"1) service was mediocre. 
2) I did not receive my meal, the owner, not the waiter, had to come and tell me that they didn't have what I ordered after an hour of waiting. 
3) the owner didn't actually make up for anything and said that he was \"sorry\" 
4) I left hungry and the original waiter never came back to the table after the food was brought because he knew that he had screwed our table over."}
{"text":"I'm giving Rehab Burger 5 stars, first off because their staff is awesome!  Probably the best service I've had in Old Town.  My 3rd visit, and twice Melanie has been our server, she's the best.

Wings, burgers, fish tacos, and the spinach salad, all delicious!  But you have to try the 'Chili Verde Con Pollo' appetizer!  Make sure you bring a friend to share!

Great Happy Hour & patio, cool decor, best of all, no smoking patio!!"}
{"text":"Great fun, great atmosphere and fantastic burgers. Just like the story goes, this is a great place to unwind and enjoy friends and ridiculously amazing food after a tough week at work. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Horrible service today. Love the burgers but service was terrible and left with no food. Had the Aloha festival this weekend and thought I would get a burger instead of standing in long lines at the festival with my son. I sat down and ordered a burger right away. Server brought waters and never saw her again. Asked the hostess after 25min if the food was going to be longer and she said she would see. Another 10 minutes go by and still no one comes by or checks on us again. Ended up leaving after 35-40minutes. I could understand if it was busy but there were only two other tables with people at them in the front and only couple people outside. Don't think I'll go back again after being disappointed by the service."}
{"text":"Been here 3 times now and this burgers just can't fail,  best in town for sure,  great atmosphere,  great service."}
{"text":"This place is AMAAAAZING. Every time I go I am more and more impressed with their food. Even beyond that the atmosphere is awesome and the staff is always the best. One server in particular stands out above the rest....if you have the opportunity you need to sit in Nick's section. If you can't find him ask for Pickle! He'll make you feel like family and his happy mood is contagious! After eating here and seeing how this place runs, I don't think I can ever go to another burger joint again. If you're looking for a great time and some tasty grub this is definitely the place :-)

-Missy"}
{"text":"This was great!  I got the PB&J on a pretzel bun which was everything promised and more.  I'm not used to the siracha heat, so the sweet potato tots were a good pairing to take down the heat in the first few bites.  We sat outside on a very chilly night so we were alternately frozen and then thawed by the heaters.  The server, Kassie, was really nice and ran the whole patio very easily.  We had the brownie to finish off the night, which was a mess (too many layers) and not very good in the end.  But it didn't ruin our night and the whole meal for 3 people was very reasonable.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Rehab Burger is known for its creativity when it comes to burgers. They've got some crazy concoctions. I'm a traditionalist when it comes to burgers - just give me ketchup, pickle, tomato and lettuce. Their buns and burgers are top quality, the fries are amazing, and the service is very good."}
{"text":"Not too bad.  Lotsa hype, other also commenting they heard about it on the internet.  Service is excellent.  The corn is a treat.  We got the PBJ burger, just what you'd expect it to taste like.  Also, the beefstro with shaved ribeye.  I though I ordered the double, but only one patty plus shaved meat.  Burger meet was ok, this is about toppings. And quantity.  Not bad.  Then again, I may not be in the burger mood.  Ordered rare, although it seemed medium rare.  Slight gastro trouble later in the eve, couldn't swear it was caused by that meal.  If I lived here I would try it again."}
{"text":"I took my friend to dinner here, it was her first time. The food was amazing as always! However the service not so much, which is why I'm giving it three stars. 

I always come during lunch and get great service and I thought it would be the same during dinner. It wasn't. We had an elderly server who seemed very forgetful and flustered. I arrived at 4:30pm this past Friday When I first walked in letting my friend, it took her about 10 mins to realize I was there to take my drink order. 

We ordered our entrees right away, however when our food came out, she didn't bring any napkins or utensils. She came by and asked if everything was good and I asked for some silverware, she said she would be right back. She never came back. 15 mins later, she comes back to refill by water but no utensils. I couldn't eat my side salad cause I had no fork! Not to mention no napkins to wipe my greasy hands! I went to the hostess and asked for some. 

The server took a bit to give us our check, we asked for two checks, she came back with one check. Okay fine, we'll split it no big deal. But she took a good 15 mins to get it, my friend moved it to the other side of the table for her to see we were ready. Another 10 mins go by and she hands us the check... We then realized there was no merchant or customer copy, she never swiped our cards! So we had to wait again for a while until we got her attention again to swipe our cards. Her response was, \"I've done that to two other tables just now too!\" Good thing we're nice people and didn't dip out due to her mistake. 

I will still come back but I hope I get better service."}
{"text":"Haven't been here in about six months and am wondering why. We ordered the Hawaiian and Jalapeño burgers and they were on point! Burgers came out quick, hot and prepared exactly as we ordered. Frankie, the manager, was excellent as was our server. We will be back, and it won't take 6 months!!"}
{"text":"They have a lot of burger options but I wouldn't say any are outstanding. I ordered a burger medium well and it wasn't cooked. As a burger place they should know how to cook a burger properly to how it is ordered. They eventually corrected the order and gave it for free. The service was good but overall experience disappointing."}
{"text":"I gotta say, I was not expecting such great service!  The place was packed so we decided to sit at the bar.  Luckily the hostess followed us because we couldn't find 2 seats together like a fellow customer had thought she'd seen.  She put us in between a couple groups at the long table, one was about to leave anyway.  Service was prompt, food was prepared in a reasonable amount of time and served hot.  Is that too much to ask for?  In Scottsdale, so often it is.  It was refreshing.

The burgers are solid.  I had the chili burger with sweet potato tots.  Love the tots.  They were cooked perfectly.  Burgers were done to order.  I really liked their creative sauces - chipotle(?) aioli, pineapple aioli, spicy ketchup.  We also had the calamari which was great.  The prices are pretty solid too, but the portions make up for it I think.  

We also did the Reese's pot brownie with ice cream.  Get a dollar off if you check in on Yelp btw!  Paid for the ice cream addition.  :)  Its a brownie on top of Reese's I think in a bed of marshmallow fluff topped with ice cream if you add it.  Very sweet, probably nice to share with like 2-3 other people to get a good portion without feeling sick.

All in all, its a worthy establishment that justify the pricing with great service and solid food.  Happy hour deals are mostly just drinks at this point.  A buck off appetizers too, but not great for food as far as happy hour goes.

Updating my review to add the backyard bbq burger - its awesome!  Burger with bbq sauce and a fried onion on top.  YUM!"}
{"text":"Great selection of burgers, even build  your own, I had bacon and blue which was mixed in with the patty, son had poblano burger, it was very spicy, he had to take out the spicy onions, fries were excellent and offered with ranch and ketchup, just wish they had better beer selection"}
{"text":"Always great. Never just good. Excellent service, clean surroundings and best of all - amazing menu."}
{"text":"Every time we order take away something is cold and the whole meal feels limp.  I've always enjoyed my meal while dining in.  If you want it to go, avoid calling ahead and instead order on the spot and relax at the bar while you wait.  Pineapple aioli and sweet po-TOT-oes for the win!"}
{"text":"Best burgers in Scottsdale. Love that pretzel bun easily handles my chili cheeseburger. Burger is flawless, sides are great, service is exceptional"}
{"text":"Great all around. The atmosphere, service and food is exceptional. If you're lucky enough, you'll get Kay or Jon as your bartender. They are very good at what they do and truly enjoy your company. Must visit!"}
{"text":"Such an original place. Go with an empty stomach...preferably don't eat for a day or so prior because you will be happily stuffed afterwards. Food is awesome, variety is fantastic and a must to visit if you are in the area. Staff is also super friendly."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite burger places in Tempe! Their sweet potatoes tots are so tasty and you get your money's worth with the HUGE portions. Their drink list is also delicious, and I would recommend the Mai Tai!"}
{"text":"Finally got to this location yesterday.  Had to pay a meter to park out front.  Put in an hour but it took longer than that for lunch and dessert.

Had a smaller burger with blue cheese, avocado and a fried egg.  The egg should have been skipped.  I am an egg snob and this was neither a quality egg nor was it prepared well.  The rest including the tots and the dipping sauces was delicious.

For dessert we had the pot brownie with Reeses cup, peanut butter, marshmallow, ice cream and chocolate syrup.   So good the way you burn your mouth on some bites while cooling it with the ice cream at the same time."}
{"text":"Creative burger joint with a cool ambiance. Fun music, tap beer, miss the old style onion rings (extra crunchy) they changed them up so....Regardless, the burgers & fries are great!"}
{"text":"Visited the Tempe location today with my boyfriend for the first time and was very impressed. This location was much more spacious. The food was great as always, I actually think they did a better job preparing our food than they did at the Scottsdale location. Our quesadilla was less greasy and more flavorful than the one we ordered last time we went to the Scottsdale location. Our waiter Brandon was awesome. He was very efficient, and courteous. Probably one of the best servers we have had. Both locations are great, but I was very impressed with the new location and the service we were provided with."}
{"text":"Overall, less than impressed. Having been to great places in Chicago, NY, ATL, LA, basically everywhere, my expectations are always high. Food was overcooked and dry. Sauces were all over the place and weren't anything special. The one with pineapple was just weird. 

Highlight of my meal was sweet potato tots. I'm a fan of tots and sweet potatoes. Not sure if they made them in house, but they were good. Beer selection was not focused on quality micros, mostly all main stream junk. Had a Four Peaks that was decent, but that was literally the only microbrew that they carried. Disappointing. 

Overall, would definitely not be back unless I had no choice. Pick another place. Underwhelmed."}
{"text":"My first time here let me tell you it did not disappoint, had the burger with shaved prime rib on it, juicy delicious bomb burger cooked just right ordered it medium and it was really juicy they also threw those delicious southwest chilies on it I love, wings and onion wings were really good too they combined two sauces for our wings that really went well together sweet and savory, beer bar the works, and our waiter was great, can't wait to come back when I'm back in the AZ, from Chicago where we have lots of great burger spots and this is in my top 5...."}
{"text":"I went here twice on my visit to Scottsdale! The first time with a group of gals and the second time with my husband. The outdoor patio is cute. The hamburger menu is creative and the 2 different choices I had were both really good. The fries and beers (maybe a few more draft choices?) were good too! Good burger spot!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere but we felt the food was average. The burgers were dry. Served without veggies (unless you ask for them). Fries and sweet potato fries were both ok. Gluten free bun was cool but so dry that I took it off. I'd recommend lettuce wrapped over the GF bun. They have lots of sauces which were fun to try. I wouldn't rush back but might try it again if we were in the area."}
{"text":"I had the chicken sandwich here when I was with my family and was pleasantly surprised! The chicken was tender and flavorful, and the bun was great. 
My family all had burgers and really enjoyed them, although they said it wasn't the best burger they had ever eaten. 
I loved the fries but my sister said they were a bit too salty, so if you like flavorful fries these are for you!"}
{"text":"This place is wonderful! I will definitely be going back. The PBJ, bacon and sirracha burger is worth the return. The sweet poToToes are also delicious. Fun atmosphere with friendly staff. What a gem in the heart of old town Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Friggin awesome spot! Great service. Ridiculous burgers. Come hungry!!!!! We got
The pulled pork burger, the ghost burger, and the dude next to us got the double decker monster. Obnoxiously large burgers. So good."}
{"text":"We are in from out of town, and despite being extremely crowded with the Spring Training/Spring Break crowd, the service was excellent and the food was delicious. I don't remember the name of the burger I had, but it was the one with ghostpepper jack cheese, and it had the perfect amount of kick. The onion rings are huge and tasty. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"The food is good. We has a nice waiter, however... The hostess' were beyond  rude... Smh"}
{"text":"Rehab burger is a great place for a burger and wings in Old Town Scottsdale. The patio is small but on a beautiful day is a great place to enjoy a drink. We typically order the Gold Medal Wings and the BYOB. This is the perfect place to eat prior to a spring training game. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  Went last night with a group of 9. Fun atmosphere, great, quick service and everyone loved their meals. Only minor complaint was the bbq burger was hard for a friend to eat (he said he would have ordered the sauce on the side next time bc the flavor was spot on, just super smothered). I had the Mac n cheese burger-- to die for! My husband had the ghost burger and our kids had plain burgers. We all loved everything and the staff was all on point and very nice.  Sweet potato tots were so good too!  The bill was only $112 for a group of 9, and we were convinced there was a mistake-- nope, just super reasonable prices!! We are on vacation but will be back next time we are in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"If you want a killer burger, this is the place to go. I've never written a restaurant review, but this one is worth taking the time. The sweet potato tots are crispy on the outside and melt in your mouth on the inside. The BBQ burger was insanely good. I can't  wait to go back and try another burger."}
{"text":"We visited the Phoenix metro area from California and I can honestly say my first experience with a Arizona burger joint did not fail to impress.  

The decor is something straight from a typical So Cal beach boardwalk: Lots of wood, surboards, bicycles, VW mini-buses, tiki torches...  All they were missing was the sand!  Plenty of flat screen TV's playing everything from surfing competitions, downhill MTB'ing and other various sporting events.  The overall atmosphere is clean, well presented and very laid back.

We had the Poblano and Mac Gnarly burgers, both of which were HUGE, cooked perfectly and very tasty.  The sweet poTOToes with Pineapple aioli recommended by our waitress were awesome.  The food was excellent, prices are very reasonable and the service was great.

Overall, a fantastic experience.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"We just had to go since we were in town for a therapy conference. We sat down and immediately saw a Rose All Day sign with sparkling rose for $20 a bottle. Then we had some really great service, kind, fun and attentive. We ordered spicy Mac and cheese burgers which were super rich but good. Had a great meal and lots of fun."}
{"text":"Our GO TO place for awesome incredible burgers!  So many options, and all that of them in big or ridiculous big size!  Get there early, very popular and the wait gets long quick, but if you have to wait, it's worth it!!"}
{"text":"So what do you want to know about this place.  You walk in and you think yourself at a beach bar in the Caribbean or maybe the Texas coast?  Surf Boards and fish surround this place.  Sadly I didn't not imbibe in their mixed drink selection as I can only tell by the fare they'd be luscious as well.

I forget my Waitress' name but she had this attitude and spunk that was perfect and was packed with tips when asked.  That tells me she at least had eaten something there.

So there's two way about stopping your colon, the 10 oz or the 5 oz.  I went the 10oz route with the Porkster and Tots.  Well everyone got the tots.  My Step-Dad got the Ghost, and girlfriend the Mac and Cheese...oh that mac and cheese was delish, like word.  Maybe I'll just sneak back around and get some of that sometime.

I had been waiting to come here after a long workout and am glad I did so this day.  That Porkster was delicious, 10oz of prime ground juicy beef with cheddar and 8 oz of luscious pulled pork all on a pretzel bun.  Just nom.

Can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"Can I give this place 6 stars?  We had a great experience here the other night. We arrived with a toddler who was really hungry and the owner bent over backwards to accommodate his needs despite having a packed house on a Thursday night.

I had the PBJ burger and my wife had poblano and both were excellent. At first I thought PBJ would be a little gimmicky, and though I'm always seeking out highly-regarded burgers wherever I go, I felt this was something genuinely innovative and well executed.

Visiting from Austin, this place reminded me of a many of our local favorites: Hut's Hamburgers (menu), Hula Hut (tiki bar atmosphere) and Freebirds (decor/quirkiness) with an extensive bar on top of that. 

I returned to get something to go on a Sunday at 3p and every seat at the bar was full along with half the tables so it's no secret that this place rocks."}
{"text":"Fantastic.

If you can put up with the typical Scottsdale vibe in the area, this place is a must! Awesome burgers, fries, and service. This little place does it right. 

The BBQ burger is amazing, but I get the onion rings on the side. It's the perfect setup."}
{"text":"lunch 6/29: 3 of us had wings with \"medium\" sauce - just right. all had burgers; mine hatch burger - cooked perfectly med-rare, brioche bun and sweet potato tots which were great. one of the best burgers i've had in a long time. grandson had the big 10 0z burger - huge! didn't fade him ate the whole thing in minutes. great place, will be back regularly'
,"}
{"text":"We stopped here after a couple drinks next door and the burgers and HUGE and delicious!!  I would strongly recommend tying it out.  Good price too!!"}
{"text":"I was her last night, this would have to be the best burger ive had. The atmosphere of the restaurant was cool,chill back like a bob marley theme just made you eat and enjoy the best burger. I orderd the ghost burger with unions rings, pretty spices but enjoyable, i had it made medium well and was brought out exactly that. It was soft and delicious as it had ghost pepper cheese and guacamole, great combination. If others think its expensive dont listen its well worth it, i will be coming here soon again ."}
{"text":"So many burgers, so little time. Tried the Hawaiian burger because I've never seen anything on a menu like it. Boy was it good! Topped it off with sweet potato tater tots and the orange creamsicle shake to put me in a food coma. :)"}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday and it was pretty dead at about 10.. the location is great and the food was decent. The portion sizes were huge and we weren't able to take any home since we were checking out the rest of the bars in the area. All in all, it was cheap and portion sizes were huge."}
{"text":"Fantastic food! Amazing service! Quick tea refills! The chicken was the best I've had. Rich flavor! Mac and cheese was very flavorful and spicy. This was our first visit! We would recommend it to anyone or guests for a delicious burger! Tons of options on the menu to choose from and an extensive wine list!"}
{"text":"Pretty good..but not amazing?  Then again in NY we are spoiled with tons of great burger options so maybe I'm biased?  Though I will say that I am a fan of the ghost pepper burger and it is not spicy!  Definitely a good use of the pepper in this burger so bravo for that!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time on Saturday. They were decently priced, especially for how big their burgers were! It was a nice little area, it had plenty of parking across the street. Husband had the PB&J burger which he loved. I was the simple soul and just got a cheese burger. We both loved our choices!"}
{"text":"IS THIS REAL LIFE...? Y'all... pretty sure we found the best burger place in the valley. The spicy mac n cheese burger was OUT OF THIS WORLD  the staff were all so nice, accommodated us and our puppy, Goose, and were so great. y'all over at Rehab Burger Therapy.... you outdid yourself  20,000 out of 5 stars."}
{"text":"If you're craving a burger, well then you need to get your booty to Rehab Burger Therapy. Super fun vibe and lots of energy in this restaurant. Get their early, it gets busy at lunch. Great people watching too.

I came here last week and ordered the pulled pork and ham sandwich, could only eat half of it, so filling and so delicious. 

Wouldn't recommend bringing kids here, lots of high top tables and chairs, more of an adult hamburger joint."}
{"text":"This was my first time here and I was so impressed. Amazing food and atmosphere. I had bacon burger on a pretzel bun with fresh avocado and sweet potato tots with two awesome dipping sauces. Can't wait to go back with friends."}
{"text":"Absolutely an amazing burger. I decided to go with the ghost pepper burger. Oh man! Delicious but I now know the true meaning of rehab. That lasted a few days. I guess the sweats were pretty noticable because I was brought a cool tall glass of milk. I told them I was a man and didn't need milk! But asked if they could make it chocolate milk. That was the manly thing to do. She threw down on some Hersey's. I was able to save some dignity while putting the fire out. All and all, an outstanding burger and will definitely be in to get some chocolate milk again."}
{"text":"Best burger i have ever eaten!!  PBnJ burger...sounds bizarre but holy canoli...DELICIOUS!  And our server Tearin was great!  Very friendly and knowledgeable.  The sweet potato tater tots r really good too!"}
{"text":"This place is so good! Went here yesterday and found out they have happy hour everyday of the week from 11 am - 6 pm, can't beat that! Not only are their burgers good but I think that they have the best onion rings in all of Arizona and my boyfriend said the same thing about their sweet potato tots. I got the relapse size chili cheese burger, and my boyfriend got the relapse size of the porkster burger (yes a burger topped with pulled pork lol) and both were still huge and so delicious. This isn't typically a regular spot for us because we leave in a food coma but we love it every time we come!"}
{"text":"My Arizona experience continues. Was craving a really good hardy burger at the end of class today and this was one the first places that came up on Google. Called in a to go order for the Rehab Burger Mushroom Swiss style on the pretzel bun. Didn't realize how far this was from my hotel, but it was worth it. They really do make a very tasty burger here! I will have to make at least two more trips to this place before I head back to Southern California."}
{"text":"Great food but the ac must not work. Sweating while eating is no bueno. Wont go back till winter for sure. Veggie burger was ok should not deep fry it. Corn on the cob was super but that's about all"}
{"text":"Loved this place!  Was even able to enjoy sitting outside on a cold night.  Had one of the coupons for an appetizer, 2 entrees and dessert.

Tried:
skin on fries - GOOD

Shelby's Spinach Salad - huge, beautiful and GOOD

Hatch Chili burger on Gluten Free Bun- He was in HEAVEN

Sweet Potato Tater Tots- SERIOUSLY AMAZING.  I don't even care for sweet potato french fries but something about this being mashed up in the middle and crunchy on the outside with salt.  I can't wait to have them again.

Pineapple Teriyaki Aoli - SERIOUSLY AMAZING 2.  I am slightly allergic to pineapple and don't like mayo at all so I almost never like aoli.  This dip with the tots is the bomb.  

Ketchup - what's there to say?

Spicy Ketchup - okay.  what you would expect.

Chipotle Ranch - My second favorite dip.

Chocolate Lava milkshake with a shot of Bailey's - YUMMMM

They had run out of pot brownies by the time we wanted dessert and that made me really sad.  I guess it gives us a reason to return soon though."}
{"text":"*This is not a fancy burger place! Come here in sandals or feel super over dressed.

I came here for a work event recently, and I know it's been in Scottsdale forever but I somehow have never stopped by. The interior is like that of a beach shack, they specialize in burgers clearly, but they also have a lot of other options like fish tacos and some fried appetizers. 

I ordered the margatini which was pretty much everything I like in a glass, a fancy martini glass at that! I don't really know where my aversion to frozen beverages came from, but I hate frozen margaritas, and I'm so happy they have a different option. But, that being said, all my coworkers loved their frozen drinks. 

We ordered the calamari and chips and salsa to start. The calamari was excellent, the chips and salsa weren't anything special. For entrees many people did the BYOB and sweet potato tots, they all looked amazing! I ordered a turkey burger with a lettuce \"bun\" and their onion rings. I loved the turkey burger itself, but the lettuce wrap was more like a bunch of little lettuce pieces, like a salad. The onion rings with the chipotle aioli are a must! 

We as a group skipped dessert. I will say this was reasonably priced and the serving sizes were huge. For a super casual vibe and quick service I'll definitely come back."}
{"text":"Worst Service Ever our waitress was rude to me because I had a hard time hearing her when we were ordering.  They brought our food and no utensils or napkins. My burger was raw and my husband ordered a second cocktail that didn't show up until our bill came. We came here last year during Spring Training and thought it was wonderful my how things changed in a year!"}
{"text":"Love the service! 

We were immediately seated upon arrival. The environment made us feel like we were next to the beach and having a burger. Our server was so adorable and very friendly.

We ordered the spicy mac and cheese burger with regular fries and I ordered the Hawaiian burger with pretzel bun along with sweet potatoe tots. We waited about 5-10 minutes and our delicious looking food came to us. My server also included different sauces for me to try. 

The sweet potatoe tots were yummy with the Ketchum and by itself. They weren't crispy tots but a little on the soft side. Our burgers were hard to hold and eat so we just cut them up. My Hawaiian burger was a little bland, so it helped that I had a pickle to kick in some flavor. My friend couldn't find her patty under the mounds of mac and cheese she received between her hamburger bun, but she said it was pretty good! However, the amount of carbs were getting to her. What I liked most was our burgers were not disgustingly greasy and I didn't feel the nasty heaviness you usually feel after eating an epic burger.

Would really love to come back and try the other burgers though :)  love the friendliness and the ambience."}
{"text":"I've heard so many good things about this place, and so I was super excited to try it out. Went there today and ordered a Mushroom and Swiss burger and fries. 
Burger was over cooked and not even exceptionally warm anymore. Fries were good. Server looked like she was either having a bad morning or still waking up, at 11:30am. 
The grilled cheese my boyfriend ordered was pretty solid, but the milkshake could use something more than Hershey's syrup and milk with a scoop of vanilla. 
Overall a pretty meh experience :/"}
{"text":"First impressions mean a lot to me and when I went there I was disappointed. The flamboyant guy who sat us down was rude  to us. First he skipped us and waited on the people behind us. (Mind you that there's always a long line to get in.) I simply asked him how seating works and he raised his voice to us, then he sat us in the back by the restroom isle. 
Our waiter was extremely great though. He introduced us to the place and went over the menu with us. He's the only reason why I'm giving it 2 stars. 
The food wait wasn't that long given the huge amount of people in there, so that wasn't an issue. Now the food just lacks flavor. I am from New Orleans and I am used of flavor. My bacon burger on a pretzel bun was just bland. I only enjoyed the side order of onion rings. Overall my burger was messy. 
I'm going to stick to David's Hamburgers and Mexican Food on Main Street."}
{"text":"Thought the rating here on yelp was too high. Great service but the food was not worth the high ratings. Pretzel bun lacked that pretzel flavor (probably not enough salt in the dough) and the Jamaican corn was wrinkly and missing that plump juiciness you expect from corn. Also the mushrooms on my burger tasted like they came from a can... Pretty disappointing."}
{"text":"Fantastic atmosphere. Amazing food. Well priced. Very slow service- good thing the setting was great."}
{"text":"Horrible. As an out-of-towner, very surprised that this place was PACKED. Sat outside, comfy. Then the server scratches HIS BALLS with NO SHAME in front of us. Not just a quick scratch, but a lengthy one so that we can actually notice him doing this IN OUR FACE.
I don't know why we stayed to eat, probably because someone else brought our food. It was greasy and unflavored. Just horrible. Especially since I went off of the reviews on Yelp to pick this place.
Would NEVER recommend!!!"}
{"text":"My son and I came in for a burger based on the reviews and they didn't lie.  The burger was amazing.  The server, I wish I could remember his name was super funny and guided us through the house specials and best options.  They have banquet style seating for big parties and smaller 4 personal tables for smaller parties.  Out door patio if you want some fresh air Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Divine burgers, great bar staff (we sat at the bar and the bartenders were friendly, accomodating and fun).  Hubby had the Hangover Burger and raved about it.  I had the Chili Cheeseburger which was yum and also had the sweet potato tator tots. 

Also, the bartenders are very, very generous with their pours which was cool.  The atmosphere, decor, food, music and vide was fun.  We had a great time and hope to return someday soon.  Living in Denver, where there are a lot of fantastic burger places, this was a gem and highly recommend."}
{"text":"my only problem with the place is the Margarita's were way over priced and should be in a Margarita glass not a tall soda glass bartending 101 the food and service was perfect"}
{"text":"Turkey Jalapeno Mac-n-Cheese burger with Green Chilis, Siracha Mayo, and Poblano Peppers on a Pretzel Bun. Or some combination of all of that.  This place is ridiculous!"}
{"text":"Spicy Mac N  cheese burger is so ono!  Would have loved to have had the moco Loco burger they are featuring this weekend.  Winner winner no matter!  Ask for Alyssa, she's awesome!"}
{"text":"Thursday's are all day happy hours! Went here for the first time last night, it was great! I got the PBJ and Bacon with a turkey burger instead and the slaw. The burger was amazing, the slaw was very blan- I wouldn't pay the up charge for it again. Our server was super peppy, smiley and helpful. We will be back!"}
{"text":"So, the reviews are spot on...this place is amazing!  We stopped by today right when they opened and snagged a great table on the patio with our pooch...the host recommended a super dog friendly table and brought out some water for her.  Our server was great - friendly, efficient and so nice to our dog.  The food was fantastic too...we tried the chili cheese fries to start (don't judge...we went to the gym that morning) and each of us had the hawaiian turkey burger - one on a pretzel bun and one on a wheat bun with sides of fries.  The portions were really large (I took half of my burger home) and everything was made fresh.  This is a great spot to enjoy the nice weather on the patio with some good food and drinks or inside to catch the games.  Definitely worth a visit!"}
{"text":"A friend and I decided to try this place out since the staff at Scottsdale HonorHealth highly recommended it. 

We were staying at the hospital for training, and it was great that this place was just around the corner from us. The interior decoration is like a beach hang-out theme, which I totally digged, but I felt like this would appeal more to party-goers and college students... ANYWAY, we were totally blown away with the amount of choices this place has to offer. I couldn't decided between three items until I finally settled for the turkey burger. (There's actually a PBJ and bacon burger on their menu ) IT IS HUGE! And it was very good for a turkey burger. I really liked the sweet potato tots they gave me, I was totally hooked.

I wouldn't mind coming out to this restaurant again in the future and would say this is definitely a place to check out at least once when you're in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"This place is so good! Great food great vibe. Overall a super enjoyable experience, servers are great super friendly and helpful. Food is delicious, burgers are grilled and delicious, fries crisp and addictive, and the best onion rings I've ever had! 10/10 would come again!"}
{"text":"The bacon cheeseburger was very good except the bacon. Even though it had good flavor, it was closer to beef jerky than bacon.
My friends swiss mushroom burger was killer.
Other buddy's gargonzola bacon burger wasn't. The cheese and the bacon were suppose to be in the beef paddy but we never saw either.
We got a side of onion rings and they were very tasty but they had more hard breading than I like. I prefer a thinner more delicate  breading. 
The fries were top notch; nothing to complain about. 
Over all, if you are in the mood for a great big burger and fries, you can't go wrong with Rehab."}
{"text":"I'd give this place a four star review, with the deductions coming from service and partially the food. This time I ordered the ghost burger rehab style which is only one patty. The burger was plenty spicy and I enjoyed it, however, the burger was not well done as I requested. There was some link in the burger and the fries were cold. Aside from that it was a great experience, although I anticipate Wait staff to be a little more attentive and bring out hot sides. I personally  convinced a friend of mine to come and he was pleased except for the service. Gentlemen serving us seemed complacent or Like he was ready to go. I understand as we've all been there, although if you want to attract repeat customers you have to show them attention. Just a thought...."}
{"text":"Holy moly!!! If you get a cheat meal, this is the place. Every calorie is so worth it.
We had the BYOB with peppers, an egg and the sweet potato tots.
And a ghost burger... Again with the sweet potato tots, even though the fries looked good too. The burger wasn't even that spicy, but had a great flavor with a generous portion of avocado. 
Order the spicy ketchup too!"}
{"text":"Service was absolutely stellar! We were seated sooner than anticipated and even though the place was packed, we were served in a timely fashion.  Having read previous reviews I was anticipating a euphoric experience with a juicy, tasty burger.  The burger itself was a little dry and was not seasoned.  French fries were frozen shoe-string and sweet potato tots (also frozen) were very tasty.  I want to give this restaurant a 3 1/2 star rating but Yelp doesn't do half-stars."}
{"text":"I actually wasn't a huge fan of this place. The food was mediocre. They have a lot of options but I didn't think either my fiancé or my burger tasted great. I had the mac and cheese burger and he had the ghost pepper burger. One plus is that the ghost pepper burger was hot. Also, the hot wings were good. 

I was also disappointed that all their salads had so much junk in it. Not one single healthy salad option on the menu. I ordered a side salad with my burger and the lettuce tasted dirty and unwashed. 

We also ordered a Bloody Mary which we never got. They seemed understaffed and this was a Monday night. 

Wouldn't come back but didn't hate it or love it."}
{"text":"Great burgers, great service, and delicious fries! Will definitely come back again! :)"}
{"text":"Just had a great lunch. Bacon cheeseburger added a onion ring and 3 Coronas. My wife had a BBQ burger and a Bloody Mary. Everything tasted great. Service was spot on and a friendly staff. The atmosphere was a fun tropical vibe and very clean."}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would. I ordered the spicy Mac and cheese burger, which I've had in the past, tonight it was so spicy there was no flavor so I asked to sub it out for a different burger. I took one bite of the Mac and cheese not even the burger. The manager came over after already putting in my replacement burger and actually shouted in my face that I ordered wrong and he would charge me for both burgers but would not take the first burger off. When I asked to cancel the new one he said they were already making it and I would have to take both. He continued to yell I did not know how to order and this was not his fault in front of every. I cried and I will never go back."}
{"text":"I'm not too easily impressed by burger pubs, but this place was really fantastic. My grilled chicken sandwich was exceptionally delicious, the sweet potato tots in honey mustard aioli were great, the server was helpful and funny, and the atmosphere is chill with cool decor and great music that isn't too loud. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to grab lunch! 

My boyfriend and I always start out with a basket of fries (half regular, half sweet potato). It's great because it comes with sauces - I think you get to choose three - and the fries are always so crispy and delicious. Sometimes we come JUST for the fries. 

If you're feeling adventurous, try the mac n'cheese burger. It's cheesy and messy and might give you a heart attack on your way home (they don't call it Rehab for nothing), but it's soooo good.  Another thing I love is their Gluten Free buns - they don't crumble or fall apart while you're eating your burger, which can be hard to find. 

The burgers are really rich in flavor, so I tend to split one with friends. It's usually really busy, but if there's a wait, it's worth your time! Parking isn't the best, but there's a lot nearby that you can park in and just walk over."}
{"text":"Rehab Burger Therapy is a really good burger place in Scottsdale.  A bite expensive, but well worth it.   We ordered the Mac and Cheese Burger and a Philly Cheese steak Burger.  Both are excellent.  Mac and Cheese has just enough spices to make the burger sit up and take notice.  And the sweet potato tots are to die for.  The Philly Cheese Steak burger is very tasty.  It's a lot of meat.  It comes with a burger patty and Philly Cheese steak on top of it.   I will definitely come back here.  The Onion ring is not as good.  It has too much batter for my taste."}
{"text":"Great burgers, great fries, sauces, and drinks. So far, my favorite burger in the Valley - this includes in-n-out, the Stand, paradise valley burger company, and the other familiar franchises.

The service was outstanding. Some of the best i've experienced in a long time"}
{"text":"The burgers were huge and they have pretzel buns! I had the veggie burger and the patty was yummy and not too crumbly. Sweet potato tots delish! Fast and friendly service too."}
{"text":"Another one of my favorite places to bring guests from out of town. They have great appetizers, beer and food! I got their wings with golden sauce. Everybody LOVED them. The atmosphere is like going to and island. It's awesome. There is lots of free parking nearby too."}
{"text":"Amazing!!! If you're in the Scottsdale area this place has really good burgers. The Mac and cheese burger with the tater tots was awesome!"}
{"text":"Tried out Rehab finally for a nice Sunday brunch with some friends. The atmosphere was fun and beachy, which is a nice twist for Old Town. Parking is tough so expect to wait a little bit.

As for the meal, the burger is huge and absolutely love the pretzel bun twist. That might have been the best part of my meal. I tried to BBQ burger and it was decent, a little over cooked for my liking.  I also highly recommend the onion rings as a starter for the table to share! Lastly, I ordered a beer with my meal and I waited, waited, and it never came. The server finally realized but at that point I was almost done with my meal. If some of these things get fixed, my review may be able to get to 4 stars."}
{"text":"Great burgers, sides, and staff. Went here for lunch with my family today and we will be going back for sure. This is a family friendly restaurant with reasonably priced foods. I had the PBJ and bacon burger and it tasted exactly how I imagined. A+"}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant 3 times, each time bringing friends that haven't tried it. The first experience was great! The second and third time have been very disappointing. The food has always been really good, but the last 2 times we have waited over 40 minutes for our food! Both times they have not said anything about the long wait. Both times, other tables that arrived after us have received their food first. I actually asked the server about it this last time and she just made excuses. No apology! I'm sorry but it shouldn't take 40 minutes to make 4 burgers! I won't be back! BTW, we were there at 3:00 on a Sunday afternoon so it wasn't like it was super busy."}
{"text":"This is a bar type atmosphere like Cheers but the food is out of this world. Within 15 minutes I had met the owner and head chef and they were really great people. Then I got the Calimari which is meatier and better flavored than any I have ever had. I thought that was great but then the pulled pork sandwich with fries showed up along with my wife's bacon cheese burger. My mouth was druling over the Bar-B-Q sauce on the fries when my wife made me try her hamburger. WOW! Finally I dug into my pulled pork. In order to understand how good this is you need to know that I am a true redneck that smokes pork, beef and poltry weekly at home. This Bar-B-Q  sauce was so smokey and delightfully spicy that I told the owner he should get it bottled. He then brought me a 20 Oz cup of it to take home for free. Seriously I just went into this place due to the name and I wanted a beer. I will make the 60 mile round trip here regularly because this makes my Bar-B-Q suck in comparison."}
{"text":"This place is great. Amazing patio, delicious burger. Place is more than packed on sat after spring training game and still phenomenal service with a smile from our server Lauren!"}
{"text":"it rained and we were outside was put into another table with another couple; but overall food was good and experience and interaction with a different couple was good... So over all was a great eating experience and the food was good!"}
{"text":"I had the turkey burger and it was awesome! Not dry at all. Our server was really cool and the tator tots were delicious! Great atmosphere and great food! The reason for the four star was the the burger was almost too big. It was hard to take a bite because it was piled high with stuff. Most people enjoy this but I like food that I can actually bite in and not food that I have to cut down. Food was delicious though! I will be back!"}
{"text":"I don't think I've ever been addicted to a burger joint before. I've never categorized myself as a \"burger person\". This place has converted me! I've decided one of my life goals is to try every burger on the menu. 

So far my favorite is the PB&J bacon burger--it sounds insane, but it's just insanely good! The Mac and Cheese burger is bomb too! I love the pretzel bun. Sweet potato tots with their special sweet sauce is heaven. The fries are delicious too, so either choice is a win. You can eat lighter and choose healthy subs like a salad for your side, and a smaller patty with a whole wheat bun.

Last time I was there, I wasn't sure what I wanted to drink before heading out to a comedy show with friends. I just knew it was cold outside, I was getting sick, and I needed a boost of energy. The bartender custom made my drink: coffee, peppermint liqueur, whiskey, and whipped cream. It was one of the best Winter drinks I've ever had! Every server I've encountered here seems to enjoy working here, they are helpful figuring out what to order and always friendly. 

The bathroom offers fresh hand towels, perfect for freshening up after a hike at nearby ASU mountain. Reggae/rock music for an awesome island vibe. A full bar, outdoor seating, and tucked away from the noisy nightlife of Mill Ave, but close enough too all the action that DT Tempe has to offer. 

I'm hooked! You just have to try it!"}
{"text":"The sweet potato tots were amazing! All the different sauces they have are really good too. The burger was good but nothing too special I've definitely had better being from Chicago. I'd go back again to try different burgers though, I had the hangover."}
{"text":"Their burgers are amazing...you won't be disappointed!  Bartender was cool and staff was very engaging.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I had lithe ghost burger but substituted chicken for beef. It was Amazing! Highly recommend and will be back again."}
{"text":"The \"porkster\" burger with the fries is absolutely delicious. I would recommend Rehab Burger Therapy for lunch or dinner. There are 2 different sizes of burgers. The patio at night is great even with cooler weather with the heaters. 10/10 recommend!!!"}
{"text":"AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
This is a fun place with great food. The owners are there and come over to say hi, the wait staff was friendly. A lot of people have gien bad reviews because it takes a little bit to get your food, this is a BUSY place, and the food is cooked fresh. So it will take a little bit of time, NO DRIVE THRU, this isn't a fast food place. Come in sit down, relax and enjoy the people you are with and have a GREAT meal!"}
{"text":"Oh my god I love this place! Fantastic Mac and cheese! PB&J BURGER TO DIE FOR! Great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Craving a burger and fries spot in Scottsdale? This is it.  The atmosphere is chill, the food is always great.  I highly recommend the Backyard BBQ Burger and their sweet potato tots with the chipotle mayo - so so good. Only drawback to this spot is that service can get a little slow on a slower night - but we never cared because the staff was so nice, the food was so good, and the atmosphere was so on point we didn't want to leave."}
{"text":"I went there the first time with two of my friends who had previous been.  The environment is very laid back, with serves in jean shorts and boat shoes.  The place itself isn't very big, and there's outside seating available, but we sat inside.  
Despite the waitress not looking old enough to drink, she gave me a good recommendation to go with my turkey burger and sweet potato tots.  The burger itself was perfectly done and delicious, but not knock out amazing.  My friend has the PB&J burger, which, if I go back, I think I'm going to indulge in.
The onion rings are HUGE and perfectly done and the side sauces are pretty inspired.  
Definitely stop by if you're in the area and craving a burger."}
{"text":"Dig your toes in the sand and sink your teeth into one of Americas best burgers. Not big on TV's, beers are cheap, and service is always on point. Relax and Rehab"}
{"text":"One of the best burger joints I've ever been! With their specialty burgers every Sunday and their amazing staff, it's hard to stay away. It gets busy fast! And seats are limited. So I'd advise getting there early or expecting a little wait. To recommend, the Spicy Mac 'n Cheese burger is so good and gooey and the Jalapeño Popper burger is a favorite. Good fun place for singles, families, or couples. Always recommend when friends and fam are in town."}
{"text":"Went here with a massive hangover....left feeling great!! The onion rings were legendary.....I ordered the Mac gnarly burger, and it was the size of a human head. Leftovers for dinner! A definite thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Bacon PB & J burger on a pretzel bun was amazing! Wow. Their fries are delicious as well. Reasonably priced, too for the quality of food you're getting."}
{"text":"Second time coming in to visit Rehab Burger Therapy.  During the first visit we were largely ignored by the server - he only stopped by our table after we had been sitting there for 10 minutes, didn't check on us after food was delivered, didn't refill our drinks, and only came back to drop the check.  The fries came out cold so we had to flag down another server to get fresh fries.  To their credit the manager/owner ended up comping the meal for us.  She asked that we give them another try to correct their shortcomings.

The second visit the fries came out cold again (I even tried a fry right when the plate hit the table).  The same manager replaced the fries for us, but again this server didn't check on how we were doing after the food was delivered.  The burgers themselves were okay, but for the price I expected something special.  I've had better at other burger joints in the area.

Burgers: 6/10
Fries: 3/10
Service: 3/10


I wanted to like this place because of all the other positive reviews, but I can't say that I'll be back."}
{"text":"My family was in town for spring training this weekend and when I read the menu for this restaurant online we HAD to stop in.

The wait for a table was about 15-20 minutes so we decided to just sit at the bar and eat. The bartender/server was super nice, attentive and had a great sense of humor!!

I love all the TVs in the place. Very fun tropical atmosphere. The bar area was just super cute.

I had the chili cheese fries for my meal and wow the chili is amazing!! I believe they said it was their own recipe and it was soooo good. I'll definitely be back the next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"Tractor pulled pork is my favorite permanent menu item, as their sauce is rich and tangy but sweet enough to balance it well. Sweet Potato tots, are you kidding me? So amazing! And their happy hour is one of the best in Scottsdale! Pb&j Sriracha burger is not for the squeamish, it's messy, it's spicy, and it's daring, but a must-try for any gourmet burger lovers."}
{"text":"Went for son's birthday dinner special treat...there was hardly any wait...got seated quickly and orders were taken promptly...great service and attention to customers...food was decent...I tried Zinburger and was not particularly impressed with it...I am not big on eating burgers and compared to five guys; in-out this would be OK burger spot based on the taste of food...would not really seek it out to eat next time but would not be averse to trying out another time with different selection from the menu..kids friendly and ample parking outside....lines start to form after 6:30p"}
{"text":"The food was alright. We ordered chips and salsa they never came. The waitress took it off the bill. I had the pulled pork, the bun was soggy and there was no taste of pineapple in any of the sauces. There was too much meat on the sandwich when it came but that's just personal preference.  The sweet potatoes tots were disgusting, and soggy. Perhaps they were undercooked. The place was crowded and very noisy."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try Burger Rehab for a while. With so many positive reviews, I was absolutely sure it won't be a disappointing experience and it was indeed a very good one. 

My husband and I were in the area so we decided to finally try it for lunch. We went pretty late, it was around 3:00pm when we got there. Restaurant had some occupied tables inside and outside. The first thing you'll feel when you sit and start looking at the menu is how relaxing the atmosphere is. The laid back music & staff contribute to this feel,
I like it! 

I checked in on Yelp and I was happy to find out there was a free chips and salsa offer for checking in. Our waitress (who was great) asked if we'd like to add guacamole and we did. Soon after that, the drinks and chips, salsa and guacamole came out. I must say, their chips was fresh and the guacamole was great! It looked and tasted like it was just made! Great job you guys. 

We took our time to look at the menu. My husband ordered their mushroom and Swiss burger, I with so many limited choices due to dietary constraints now, had to go for a less exciting option which was he build your own and I say less exciting only because of what I am allowed to pick! My burger was basically your standard burger with tomatoes, and a small twist, grilled onions. On the side both my husband and I decided to order fries and I asked for some spicy pineapple BBQ sauce on the side. 

The burgers came out after a little while and we dug in. The taste of the meat was great. You could tell it's meat (vs fat!). The fries were cooked fresh and the BBQ sauce was super! Overall I enjoyed the burger but wasn't absolutely wowed and I say that and insist that it's not because their burger is not good but because I would have liked a funky burger rather than my basic one. This is how I'm impressed usually! 

My husband enjoyed his meal a lot and was very pleased with his choice. 

Definitely worth going to especially if you could try their mouth watering options. Oh and by the way, their salads (which a lot of ppl decided to order) looked amazing! I might try one of them next time! 

Good food, great service and a relaxing atmosphere! Well done!"}
{"text":"Just had the porkster with sweet potatoe fries. The burger was cooked perfectly. Pork and BBQ said we as good but not great. Friend had the Hangover. Said it was fantastic. The egg and green chile were cooked perfectly. Service was great. Sides came out wrong and they gave us an extra side. No questions asked."}
{"text":"Not your traditional burger. Great selection excellent atmosphere and fun environment!! Great for the adventurous eater!! Try the macaroni and cheese burger!! Would recommend for the entire family!!"}
{"text":"Hike up Camelback Mountain, been on a super healthy kick the past 2 weeks. 
Enough Turkey and chicken, I need a burger and I told my girl i knew EXACTLY where to go. I've eaten here 4 times now, good solid burgers. 

Sat on the patio, ordered a couple of Hop Knot IPA and waited for our burgers.
Now I don't want to under sell my poblano burger, which was good, but my wife ordered the Peanut Butter and Jelly Burger with THICK cut bacon.

WTF???  The combination of these 3 flavors work so incredibly well together it made me dizzy. I didn't even want to eat mine. Mind blowing good. All the melted peanut butter and jelly that dripped out of the burger and onto the plate made a great dipping sauce for the fries too!!

Out of all the burgers I have eaten in my 40 year old life, this will make my top 3 of all time. Shout out to our awesome waiter Pickle for being so awesome too!"}
{"text":"Oh my gosh! Burgers are giant! And so was the club sandwich I had. The fries were awesome, love fries with the skin on. Just wasn't crazy about the sitting. Wish they had more booths. But the long table counter type doesn't create much eating enjoyment because kinda impersonal. The prices were very good  considering the amount of food you get. I would come back."}
{"text":"Discretion: this place would likely get a solid 3 -4 Star likely if I had ordered what they are known for and that is their BEEF...


Great service great atmosphere and great fries.. only reason these guys get a 3 is due to the fact  I ordered a turkey burger and it was easily the worst turkey burger I have ever had .... seasoned with who knows what .way way over the top..

Will be back to give it another shot with a burger this time"}
{"text":"i don't ask much in my search for the perfect burger. Yes, it's nice to dine in a well kept restaurant. It's also enjoyable when the staff is interactive and friendly. A buzzing atmosphere is always a nice touch. 

But when it comes down to it, when I'm looking for the Taj Mahal of burgers, it all balances on what is served. And let me tell you, RBT knows how to serve a burger that will satisfy your deepest bovine desires. 

The menu is full of unique and staple burger offerings. The one that caught my attention, however, was the PBJ and Bacon burger. Upon reading the burger's description,  I felt more conflicted than a Southern Baptist at a Castro District drag show. 

\"Wait a minute, PBJ does not belong on a burger!\" 
\"What?! The patty is drenched in sriracha?!\" 
\"I can get it with a pretzel bun as well?!\"

The universe, as I saw it, was collapsing everywhere I looked. None of this made any sense to my respectable burger palate, and I yearned to taste this forbidden concoction of beef, bacon, thai hot sauce, and pb&j. Not to be outdone by the unique burger, I forewent the pedestrian side of fries and ordered the Jamaican corn to accompany my otherworldly dish.

What happened when dinner was served is somewhat of a blur. No, I was not intoxicated (in the traditional sense) - I can only compare it to the moment when you first meet your soulmate. That moment you will never forget, but cannot remember to the fullest detail. With my very first bite, my synapses were firing at a rate that a M134 Minigun couldn't match. My eyes bulged with intense fulfillment, my skin emitted a cool sweat of indulgence, and I could have sworn I heard the faithful tune \"Take my Breath Away\" ringing in my subconscious state of euphoria. I had found it, the perfect burger was in my grasp and I felt unworthy. 

The burger, like most fleeting romances, was gone before I could sincerely take in the magnitude of this event. Fortunately, the Jamaican corn was still at my disposal, and may God turn me into a horny toad if that side wasn't an outstanding compliment to the burger. Now the Jamaican corn wasn't from the same metaphysical realm from which the PBJ and Bacon burger originated, but it was more like a swan song for my recently departed dish, an ultimate tribute for the tantric experience of RBT.

RBT delivered when it counted most, and I'm not talking about a swift thrill, I'm talking about the kind of satisfaction that is almost melancholy, as if my burger pilgrimage was finally complete. Time will only tell if this is true, but until then, RBT is the home of my favorite burger."}

{"text":"We stopped by Rehab Burger Therapy for dinner before our Segway Tour and it did not disappoint!  It has a surf vibe decor and a large bar. I can't remember the exact prices, but we hit a good happy hour deal on Thursday around 5pm.  My veggie burger came with sweet potato tots which were delicious! I would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Great place, great service. 
My Poblano Burger was perfect, and I enjoyed the sweet potato tots. Ask for Courtney, she was amazing!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch today and everyone was pleased with their orders! We all shared the homemade nacho chips and salsa! Very crunchy and tasty. The salsa had a little bite to it but good! I hid the piglet Wings and they were delicious! They are actually riblets and the pineapple salsa is baked into them. They are more than enough for a meal! My husband had the chili hamburger and he enjoyed it very much! The chili was coming out the sides and he couldn't finish the whole sandwich! Onion rings huge! Service was attentive and friendly!"}
{"text":"Solid drinks, great food. Burgers are huge, sometimes messy, but always satisfying. You'll need a nap after the food here...happy zzzz's
Chicken wings are awesome here, so is the calamari. All the burgers are great here. Sweet tots are also a great side option.
Vibe is chill and friendly. Small place though, so expect a wait during prime times and days. It's worth it!"}
{"text":"We picked this restaurant passed on the Yelp reviews and were not disappointed.  Walked into a busy restaurant on a Monday afternoon of Spring Break.  The hostess was great about getting a table cleaned off for us quickly though.  We were seated and immediately greeted by a friendly server.  We ordered the Corona Ritas because why not!  There were great.  My son had the wings and mixed 2 sauces on our server's recommendation.  He LOVED them.  My daughter had a plain burger and I had the Hatch Chili Burger.  The burgers were so good!  The meat is very favorable and tender.  Fries were good but not the best I've ever had.  Love the vibe of the restaurant too.  We almost went back while we were in town but didn't want to be lame.  Ha!  Wish we had though."}
{"text":"Situation:
- Dinner with friends (October 2017)
- One of my friends ordered a burger, I ordered the Grill Chicken Sandwich
- We are at the bar

Pros
- The service is fantastic
- Large portions of food area nice
- Not a bad beer selection
- My friend really enjoyed his Burger

Cons
- The grilled Chicken Sandwich was just okay, which makes sense at a burger place (the bread that was used was really nice, the chicken was a bit overly cooked)"}
{"text":"Looks like a surfer joint.  Great decor.  Fantastic staff.  Delicious burgers!  Each come with a side and a pickle.  Whatever you order, put it on a pretzel bun.  Yum!!!"}
{"text":"This is my husband favorite place to eat when we fly into AZ. This visit didn't disappoint. The place was packed mid afternoon but the wait wasn't long. Took a while for our server to actually get to us but the sun was shining and we soaked up the heat from our seats on the patio. We had the mac and cheese with our P&J burger: delicious!"}
{"text":"Service was very prompt tonight & food very good.. Excellent drinks..menu is large with many choices..different size burgers available is always a plus"}
{"text":"They were able to get our large party of 13 in on a Saturday night; this is not an easy task for many places in Scottsdale. 80% of our party got burgers and not one complaint was heard... I got the spicy mac and cheese and wowza, was it spicy. You better like spice if you order this one - I really liked it a lot.
The staff was very nice and they did a good job getting our food out to us all about the same time, this is important to me since it's nice to start eating together."}
{"text":"Fantastic experience in Old Scottsdale.  I had the mac n cheese burger and it was incredible.  You can't eat like this too often if you're over 30 or you'll be 400 lbs.  But for that once in a  while throw-caution-out-the-window decadent burger experience, it's awesome.  Also the management and staff are unsurpassed in service and hospitality.  It's worth the wait."}
{"text":"Sat outside because it was a cool day, not sunny, unfortunately the misters completely wet my pants and toes, so I don't recommend sitting outside. 

The waitress was very nice and attentive, so good job on the customer service for that visit. 

Fries and sweet potato tots were the best of anything else we ate. I was not raving about the burgers, and I wanted to try this place out because it was considered to be best burgers, unfortunately I asked for my burger medium and I got well done, it was so dry and I could taste the burnt spots throughout my burger. That alone ruined the taste of my basic bacon cheese burger, because there was no flavor at all or juiciness to it. 
The ghost burger was decent but also could've been made a bit juicier and less cooked. But atleast the flavoring of the cheese and guacamole overcame the dryness. 

Just wouldn't recommend going if looking for a good flavorful burger because they are overlooked and have no flavor to the patty."}
{"text":"Visiting family and we were looking for a place to grab some food in the Scottsdale area.  Found Rehab Burger Therapy on Yelp and decided to hit it. 

Very cool place.  Definitely has personality here.  Bicycles hanging on the ceiling.  The staff was great, lots of beer selection.  The burgers were fantastic!  I had the Hangover Burger Relapse with their taters.  Let me tell you, the relapse size was perfect bc then I had room to eat the taters dipping them into the various sauces they have.  The spicy ketchup is delicious!  Everyone at our table were very happy with their choice of burgers.  Big, juicy, and perfectly cooked all of them.

This place is great if you want a casual burger joint in the Scottsdale area."}
{"text":"After hearing lots of people rave about Rehab Burger therapy I figured I would take my family and try it out .. it was Mothers Day so sort of busy but we got seated right away on the patio .. our server brought us waters quickly and we ordered .. he brought my kid's drinks right away and some how forgot my drink and my friend's drink.. so after we reminded him he finally brought us our order .. food was good I got the PB & J burger and it was pretty good .. I thought I ordered sweet potato fries as did my daughter and we were served sweet potato tots.. oh well .. 
never heard a Hppy Mother's Day either lol ..
Anyway it was good but I think I'll try a few other places before coming back .."}
{"text":"I've become a regular at this place, and for good reason. If you want a new take on burgers, rehab is the place to check out. All of the staff keep a laid back and chill mood. Very nice and they deliver great service. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu. Plus, they have a great happy hour and bar selection."}

{"text":"Had a veggie burger. I was not crazy about it. Seemed to be flavorless and there were cold spots due to the avocado. Lots of bread so it appeared to look really big but it didn't measure up to it. The sweet potato tots I didn't care for. However I do love regular potato tots but these didn't Measure up. I left the meal Unsatisfied.

I was very satisfied with the service. Very attentive, happy and outgoing. Fun atmosphere with sports on the TV and music"}
{"text":"Correction, they now have hot wings that will burn your face off (if that's your intent).  Thanks for hearing me guys.  Love them!"}
{"text":"Amazing!! Finally went there today after talking about going for a long time. The food was so good but unfortunately we had to take home boxes because we just couldn't eat everything  we even brought home a hatch turkey burger for my mom and she LOVED it! Hands down we will be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"Pretty disappointing. $17 burger I had to eat with a fork and knife, the buns came out so soggy it was gross. The meat would have been pretty good if it was seasoned better. The water tasted so terrible I had to order a soda, the bartender agreed with me, lol...gross. I'd give this place a second try but for a $17.50 burger it's just not worth it, should be top notch."}
{"text":"First visit to this location of Rehab. Worth a try! 

We sat at the bar. Service was a little slow, but the place was pretty busy for Sunday lunch and we are always happy to see that. Lindsey at the bar is sweet.

Tons of menu options and I loved that you have a choice between different burger patties, buns, and sides and sauces! So awesome.

Our food was ready from the kitchen window and waiting to be brought out for us for about five minutes with at least three different servers looking at it until one brought it our way. 

I got a poblano burger with a turkey patty. Very good! The turkey had a ton of flavor. Sweet potato tots were awesome. Husband loved his Mac burger with a generous serving of Mac. They forgot to add the sriracha (listed on menu) and the other server was a little confused why we asked for a side until we explained it. Then she grabbed the side of it from the kitchen but didn't realize Lindsey had a bottle of it behind the bar. Kinda funny.

They have a great happy hour, so will probably be back to check that out soon. Otherwise, I think we will need to order the 5oz burgers next time - the 10oz were monster!! Very good."}
{"text":"Had lunch on Wednesday- not crowded at all. Service was very slow..25 minutes for food to arrive. I had the Tony Montana, it tasted good but was very dry. Sweet potato tots are excellent"}
{"text":"The 4.5 star reviews convinced me to try this place. Pictures of burgers looked amazing. I'll never know how good they were because we never had a chance to order. My brother and I sat at the bar, ordered beers right away, got menus then were ignored for 20 minutes. I tried to get someone's attention behind the bar but I guess they didn't hear me. The bartender finally stood right in front of us and I said we were ready to order whenever he was. He looked at us with no expression and after a few seconds he said ok as soon as I serve these beers and he walked away. Not sure what these employees think, but there are lots of other places to spend my money with better attitudes.  We went next door. Had great service. Spent our money there. Now I realize that the $45 Rehab didn't get from us won't put them out of business but if enough patrons are treated like this it will eventually make a difference.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"Great burger!! I had the hangover burger with pretzel bun and sweet potato tots.  The burger was full of flavor and almost too much to eat (5oz).  Not only was the food great the service was even better.  There was limited seating when I arrived, but the hostess made a spot for me at the bar area.  The waiters and waitresses were all exceptional, equal to what you would expect from a high end steakhouse.  I will definitely come back the next time in in town!"}
{"text":"I have been waiting for a good burger joint in uptown forever! Been to a bunch of restaurants all over the area and have yet to be impressed with any of the burgers.  Went in and was immediately seated. The service was spot on for being such an young business! I must say I was impressed! They seemed to have even an abundance of servers which I suspect  because they are feeling out the neighborhood. Probably a good thing because they were busy! We were  immediately greated by our server Sara she told us that they were still on Happy hour for another 10 minutes and recommend some signature drinks. I got their version of a mai tai, it was boozy and delicious. My friend ordered a frozen strawberry margarita which was also delicious (except the brain freeze haha).  

On to the burgers... They are juicy monsters and delicious. I ordered PBJ and Bacon and was blown away! Who would have thought peanut butter and jelly  would be so good on a burger but you gotta try it! My boyfriend ordered an old Americana classic Mc narly burger which is rehab's take on a big mac. But jumbo sized with secret sauce and everything.  As soon as we had finished eating a nice woman who I believe was the manager, Jamie came by to check on us and was very sweet and made sure we were enjoying ourselves and everything was great.  We told her it was fantastic and what other drinks do you recommend? She was very helpful and recommend the Kimmy special, a vodka mix with fresh lemon and lime. Give it a try! 

All in all we had a great experience not sure why other people are saying Zipps and San Tan burgers are better.. that's a flat out lie. And cold beers and cheese burgers, don't even get me started. 
The staff was great, the atmosphere was relaxed, and the drinks were strong! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great patio, food, beer selection and service staff."}
{"text":"This is my favorite burger place...ever! I have tried multiple burger bars and counters and nothing outshines rehab. The food is great and the atmosphere is really cool. The pricing is very fair as well. I always get the Mac gnarly burger, and I just love this place."}
{"text":"I really hate to do this. I know that writing this will only bring more people to this gem that my wife took me to. Simply put, this place is awesome! Its a little place on the South End of Old Town in Scottsdale. My wife had the Blue Cheese Bacon Burger and I had the Hawaiian Burger. My wife is not a burger person per say, but really like her's which she ordered on a pretzel bun. I on the other hand love my beef, and the sweetness of the pineapple was perfect. The Pineapple Teriyaki Aioli sauce brought it together nicely. The sweet potato tater-tots where the best!

The restaurant is done in a \"surfer\" theme with one TV showing surfing competitions and the rest showing a range of sporting events. Sitting in the bar you expect to walk out onto the beach.

If you are ever in Old Town and want a large choice of beer and a great burger, this is the spot. But shhhhhhh, don't tell anybody."}
{"text":"This is by far the best burger place I have found in all of Arizona. Amazing!! Excellent food....excellent staff. I have nothing bad to say about Rehab Burger!!  If you are looking for a great burger in Arizona this is your place!"}
{"text":"Met a friend for lunch and tried Rehab Burger Therapy.  Had the bacon cheeseburger (Relapse size) with optional onion rings.  Both were really good.  The burgers are cooked to order so I got a medium rare cheeseburger just the way I like it.  I opted for a pretzel bun which was crispy on the outside and soft inside.  The onion rings were really king size with a tasty batter.  Service was as good as one could expect given most all the tables were filled.  No complaints.  The decor is sort of California surfer which is kind of weird in the middle of the desert but I guess it works.  We ate inside but Rehab has a nice outdoor patio.  Would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Food was good, ambiance was an annoyingly overdone beach theme. (I admit I'm probably not their target demographic.) I had the Hatch Chili Cheeseburger with onion rings. It was good, and the onion rings were decent, too. They served the burger with their spicy ketchup (decent), their barbecue sauce (weak and thin), and their smoky aioli (really good). 

I was disappointed that they only had two local-ish beers on tap and the one I had (the Four Peaks Eighth Avenue) was not very fresh. Service was decent. I probably won't go back as there are too many other better places to eat in Scottsdale that aren't as aggressive with their decor theming, overly loud music, and multiple television screens blaring from every wall. I liked the food but hated the ambiance."}
{"text":"Sooooo yummy..  the atmosphere, very local pub feeling.. food was fantastic.. as a vegetarian they had lots of great options for me..the staff is friendly and attentive.. try this place I promise you will not be disappointed..."}
{"text":"This place is simply amazing! I came here during lunch, luckily the lunch rush had not hit yet, so there was plenty of room. The service was friendly enough, and the food was beyond good.

I ordered the PB J burger medium rare. When it came out I cut it into 4 pieces just to make sure I wouldn't make a mess (this is one messy burger) It was cooked perfectly medium rare, which is apparently harder to do than it sounds. Words can not describe how good this burger was, its a must try. The fries were pretty good as well. 

If your looking for a good burger and your in the area, stop by, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Stopped in to check the place out. We ordered a dozen wings with the golden sauce and a couple of burgers. Our waitress couldn't have been nicer! I don't know what subdivision of heaven that golden sauce came from, but holy crap it was good! The wings were perfectly cooked, not too dry. We were jet lagged and groggy so we ended up boxing up the food to take back with us. The burgers are huge! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Dear sweet baby Jesus this place is amazing! We make the trek up to Scottsdale from Gilbert at least once every two months for these burgers. The peanut butter & jelly sriracha burger is to die for! We usually try to switch it up every time we come and the specials are delicious but we always go back to ye olde favorites....pb&j or hangover. Try the sweet potato tots with the Chipotle aioli.... SO GOOD. Decent beer selection too. Sometimes you run into your douchey Scottsdale bar goer pre-gaming on a Saturday but the burgers make it worth it."}
{"text":"Sitting at the bar. Courtney is the best bar tender ever! Loving the service and the food and the happy was great. We come every year for spring training... hope to see Courtney again"}
{"text":"Too bad all the staff here hates their lives and pretends you don't exist. But the food is not that special either so it's a lose/lose situation."}
{"text":"Drove 45 minutes for a burger based on a friends high recommendation. 
I ordered the bacon and blue burger on a soft pretzel bun. I added extra blue cheese crumbles on the burger. 
I need to say, I am a burger snob. I know what a good burger is, in fact I've been known to drive 5 hours just to eat at one of my favorite burger joints. 
This burger was one of the best burgers, if not THE best burger I've ever eaten. 
The portion was huge (included fries) for $12.50
This burger has bacon and blue cheese mixed into the patty and it was outstanding. 
This burger was way better than I expected and I love the fact that I only have to drive 45 minutes to get an outstanding burger. 
I also need to say that the service was excellent. I went it just a lunch rush started, the server visited me at least 3 times to check in on me. She even gave me a soda refill in a \"to go\" cup for the road   
Great burger! Great service!"}
{"text":"Good service. Nice beer selection. For a place that \"specializes\" in burgers, the burger was just ok (but cooked to perfection)."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to eating here, then at the end of the night I immediately regretted my decision to even show up here. It had nothing to do with the food... the burger was good... It all had to do with the terrible service my friends and I received. We sat down and waited a little longer than we really should have to place our drink order. She then returned with our waters only to tell us she had forgotten what we had ordered for our drinks. We then had to repeat the various drinks we all ordered 5 minutes before. We put in our order and sat and waited for over 45 minutes for our food. While we sat there waiting... And waiting... And waiting... We watched as table after table who ordered after we had get their food. She also came by and tried to force another beer on me. She then brought my friend his burger, then went to check on the table next to us while the rest of us sat there for another 5 minutes waiting on our food. My friend told her just to cancel his order (I believe he has also written a review). The burger was good... But would have been way better had I gotten it about 25 minutes earlier than I actually did.  I forget my servers name, but she was an older woman, a lot older than the other waitresses there. P.S. They were out of Mac and Cheese!!!!! Ridiculous!!!!"}
{"text":"YUM! Oooooohhhhh yesssssss. Yes. I could eat here everyday if my wallet (and stomach) would allow it."}
{"text":"It is a cool space with lots of TVs, neat decor and an EXCELLENT FOH staff. Really fun environment. Great bar with a great list of drinks.

Had the Backyard BBQ Burger. Pineapple BBQ sauce is a treat. Really enjoyed that. Otherwise the burger pretty  bland. Needed work. Fries were great.

There is a saying that says \"you can put it on the walls or you can put it on the plate\". If you are looking for great food go elsewhere but if you are looking for a great place to hang out, have drinks and eat decent food, this is your place."}
{"text":"It was just ok. The staff was really friendly and the food came out timely. I've had better burgers, not my favorite but the atmosphere was cool, kind of like a beach side joint."}
{"text":"Found a shard of glass the size of a silver dollar in the bottom of my glass.  The manager took $3.50 off of our bill. I've never been so shocked by such terrible customer service"}
{"text":"Once again the experience was fantastic. Turkey burger was great yummmm. And their wings were even better. I never ever been disappointed.  I highly recommend this spot."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to try this place out for a few months but my problem is that I rarely find myself in old town Scottsdale. Well the stars aligned the other week when a charity event my wife and I were attending at Scottsdale Stadium was cancelled so I was driving around and spotted this place next to the parking complex.

I had the bacon burger which was huge and delicious. My wife had the grilled chicken and loved it. They give you a choice of two different size burgers. I had the larger burger which I believe was 10 ounces. I probably should have had the smaller one because I was completely stuffed for several hours after lunch.

The surfer motif is tastefully done and they have a ton of flat screens all over the place. And a big THANK YOU to MANAGEMENT for not blasting the music. It was definitely at the right decibel level so you can carry on a conversation. In addition, I really dug the music as well. They also have a great patio space so I'm sure this place will be rocking during the Spring Training season. The service was excellent even though they were slammed due to that charity event being cancelled. Our server explained that the kitchen was backed up. It wasn't a problem for us and it was nice to get some communication from the server as well.

This is definitely my go to burger place in South Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Burgers are divine! You can even get a donut as your bun choice which I did not do because I already put my order in! But any place that offers tots on the side is pretty much a winner in my book. Burgers were a little messy but let's be honest, you can't really fit it in your mouth. Give your taste buds what they've been asking for!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. There tends to be a wait as soon as the door opens for dinner, but it's definitely worth it. This was our second time at BR. My fiancé got the PB&J burger... It sounds kinda weird but it was delicious. I got the Mac N Cheese burger and it was one of the best burgers I've ever eaten! Huge portions too. I could only eat about half my burger and took the rest to go. It was still good for lunch the next day! The service was very good and even though it was a packed house, our food was out in 20-25 minutes. The guy that walks around cleaning the tables is so nice too... Always has a huge smile on his face and speaks to everyone. It's a friendly and enjoyable place with great burgers. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Rehab Burger Therapy, located in downtown Scottsdale, goes for a beachy, laid-back surfer vibe  - there are surfboards mounted on the walls, reggae music playing on the intercom and employees dressed in shorts and trucker hats. For seating, there's a small bar area as well as both inside and outside seating. 

A friend and I ordered the Bacon Cheeseburger Relapse size (4oz of meat) on a traditional Brioche bun with a side of fries and an order of their Onion Ring appetizer. The burger was just alright, nothing spectacular. BUT their onion rings were so good and massive too. The beer batter makes for an extra thick and crispy crunch. It comes with a yummy chipotle ranch sauce for dipping. Yum! 

As for service, our waitress was nice but a little slow in checking up on us periodically, so it took a little longer than expected to get our check and pay. This didn't bother me though because I assumed service would match the informal, laid-back atmosphere Rehab is going for. 

Overall, OK experience. I might come back for a beer and their onion rings but probably not to have a full meal."}
{"text":"Service and food were excellent. Our waitress Robin did an amazing job with us and our 3 kids. Port-a-Burger burger and sweet potato tator tots is a great choice. We also tried the PB&J burger, which ranks very high on my personal burger chart."}
{"text":"The food was good not great and the place was busy for a Sunday. If you are in the area it's worth checking out."}
{"text":"Ordered Hatch Burger mid rare with sweet tots. After about 20 mins it comes out minus the aioli, and overcooked to the point it needs the extra lube, and tots are ice cold..I tell the server the Burger is overcooked, and missing the sauce. Here's the important part, all I wanted at that point was the sauce. Not the management attention, not the rolling eyes of the judging server, not compensation, free food, sympathy, or a hug, just the aioli that was promised on the description. They took it very personally, like their elderly grandpa was back their flipping those grisly hockey pucks..long story short I got the sauce, the burger was comped. The tots remained frozen to the plate. I left, never to return."}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere, great food and friendly staff. Perfect combination!  Some of the combos on the burgers will sound odd but trust me they work. Don't substitute and go for it, you'll love it!  
My favorite is the PB & J Bacon burger with fried egg on pretzel bun with sweet po tots for my weekly cheat meal.  Pure heaven! Makes eating clean all week worth it."}
{"text":"Normally I don't go to eat in downtown Scottsdale because my experience has been overpriced, overhyped food -- served with a side of attitude. It's as if they assume because of their location or the head-twitching house beat in the background, the food and service don't matter all that much. 

No so with \"RBT\". I loved this place. We've already been there twice and we will definitely be back. The menu is creative (I recommend the \"pig wings\") and the burgers are high quality for the price. I especially like the \"pretzel\" burger rolls, although I wish they were offered on both the small and large burgers, not just the large.

The ambiance is casual beach-boardwalk with a touch of Maui, complete with fishtank HD screens and tropical slide-show picture frames. It's well done but not over-done. The wait staff is friendly and easy on the eyes to say the least. The beer is extra cold and crisp (no \"old tap\" taste like some other Scottsdale establishments - yuk) and they are good at keeping an eye on the level in your glass. I also appreciated that one of the owners came to our table to chat.

I am somwhat stingy with my five-star ratings, but this place earned one easily. Overall, it fits everything I'm looking for in a casual dining experience."}
{"text":"Our first real meal post 202 miles with my team. We were a table of 11. We got there towards the end of 9p and they were closed at 11. We waited an hour for our food because they had printer problems. As you can imagine 11 starving people wouldn't be too happy, but they tried to keep us busy. Which was nice of them.

I feel like if any restaurant I go to offers Hawaiian anything I have to try it. I love pineapple in my food. Period. My Hawaiian burger came with a turkey patty, ham, and a FRESH pineapple. You can tell that wasn't a can pineapple. They also gave you a teriyaki aioli of some sort. It was yummy. My fries are a bit cold and stale, but I'm forgiving.

I don't plan on ever coming back to Arizona, but I would recommend this burger place."}
{"text":"Amazing burger and great prices on happy hour beers! The service wasn't the best, but it wasn't awful either. I look forward to coming back and trying other burgers as well as their large tequila menu"}
{"text":"These appetizer ribs, piggies something?, are fantastic!!! The pineapple  dessert is to die for! This is a must stop by little stop!!!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere and service were excellent. I had the Hawaiian burger which was OK but the mac & cheese burger looked awesome so I'll be having that next time. Definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"Only reason I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 is because my expectations for the PB&J burger were much higher than the delivery. However, the food was delicious, service was certainly exceptional, and it was jam packed at 11am on a Tuesday (which can only mean great things). I wouldn't personally get the pb&j burger here again, but I would without a doubt come back for another round of burgers. The roommate loved his burger just for the record! If you're in he area - I definitely recommend dropping in for a bite! Food is cheap, but high grade food and delivery! Thank you!!"}
{"text":"Best burgers ever, my favorite place. The staff is really nice, relax get a beer order your favorite burger and must try the Jamaican corn"}
{"text":"Second visit two stars for service which was outstanding.  Food is just average at best. Old town has way too many options to ever go again."}
{"text":"Pretty crappy service for us unfortunately. Came in on a work trip with a couple of my peers(4 total) on a Monday night. Service was awfully slow. We ordered and waited about 30-40 mins for our food. 2 parties came in after us and were both served before us by a large margin of time. Our waitress didn't come check on our drinks or ask how our food was, which was OK at best. She messed up a couple of our burgers by trying to memorize and not write our orders down and that was a bummer because we already waited so long. They weren't busy so I am not sure what the deal was. Maybe she didn't like that we all wanted separate checks, but its a business trip. We're from Vegas so we know how to tip, but she sort of ruined that for herself. Shame when people don't do their jobs and then will complain about a crappy tip."}
{"text":"Being from SoCal, we found it humorous to have a beach themed restaurant in Scottsdale!  Great relaxed atmosphere, casual dress. Staff was friendly and quick to serve. My husband had the 'pig wings' which were pork riblets that he said were amazing. They were tender, almost fell off the bone tender and the sauce was incredible--sweet with a bit of heat on the backside. 

I was extremely please to find a burger joint with gluten free buns!  My first time ever--usually have to order protein style. Kudos for this wise choice!  I ordered the hatch burger but with a turkey burger instead of beef with the Jamaican style corn on the cob. The flavored were absolutely fabulous. But that heat on the chile...wow, I need ice cream!  

We are planning a return trip before we go home.  I highly recommend this place. Great for our picky teenagers as well!"}
{"text":"I consider myself a burger connoisseur and this place definitely ranks up there. Great selection and great quality of burgers. Unless you are a huge football player, the 5oz will suffice. Brioche bun has good integrity. Patty came as ordered (medium) - not overdone as found at many places. Onion rings are epic as are the chicken wings. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious and not too expensive, I especially enjoyed the vibe from this place. The staff were very kind and attentive, but not too attentive to where they became annoying.  This is my second time going and I'll continue to go."}
{"text":"Came here on a Thursday at noon and the 3 of us were seated right away. 2 of us shared the PBJ and bacon burger with sweet potato tater tots!! It was soooo good. We all shared the pot brownie for dessert, also very good. I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Stopped into this place a few ago. 

Had to be one of the best burgers in Scottsdale.

I order a regular bacon cheeseburger, until the waiter the waiter mention a burger with peanut butter and jelly? 

I tried it something new experience. You would think, how would that make a good combination? But it worked! Majorly best burger I had . 


A bit pricey , but for the quality very well worth it .."}
{"text":"The Manpanion and I are BIG on burgers. In the week that the Manpanion was here, we visited this awesome burger joint TWICE! Of course, I'm definitely making my way back. The atmosphere is extremely friendly. They really treat you like you're part of the family and as a newbie to the area, this really means a lot. 

During our first visit, there was a glitch in the kitchen, which delayed our order. Our waitress explained what happened and said that we'd get a slice of key lime pie on the house. We thought this as a really nice gesture... until we realized how LONG this wait was going to be. (Note: The Manpanion and I came in HUNGRY, so to have our meal delayed made us really CRANKY.) Since we finally received our burgers near closing time, we took the key lime pie to go.

The burgers (both times we went) were absolutely delicious! Yes. They were SO good that we were able to forgive the long wait during that first visit. The regular sized burgers are pretty hefty and consistently tasty. So far, my fave is the Hawaiian burger. It's meaty, so next time I'll opt for the smaller size. The Manpanion is all about the Hangover. You MUST have the tots or the fries. A major plus is they give you different sauces! Tip: The pineapple sauce goes perfect with the tots!

This is a yummy place and I give the folks major kudos for winning me over, despite a not-so-stellar first visit."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best burgers I've ever had the pretzel bun was excellent you must go to here to have a burger and chillax read on the back of the menu of the guys come up with the burger joint"}
{"text":"Stopped by with a friend since we were walking the downtown area. The decor is very much a beach setting with the bike cruisers and surf boards. Love the story on the menu of how the place was created. The menu is very hilarious to read. It was not too busy when we got there, so we were given choices of regular table, high top, or outdoor seating. The place is not too loud to have great conversations. 

The food was super yummy. The burger was cooked to order. The sweet potato tater tots were a smaller side but they cooked up really nice. 

By the time we left the bar was packed. Note this was a Sunday afternoon, before a holiday so they must be bringing in business.

The waitress we had was very funny, her personality was great. I think the service team here helps to make the place outstanding on top of everything else it provided."}
{"text":"Heard about this place on Yelp. With all the great reviews I had to try it. Went on a Saturday after spring training. The restaurant is tiny so when it's busy you have to wait a little bit. We only waited five minutes. Got a great waitress who was very down to earth. She offered good recommendations. I ordered the PBJ burger. Kinda crazy. But believe me, it was awesome!  The blend of peanut butter, jelly, bacon, and a sauce was awesome! Messy but tasted wonderful. Then the tater tots are so wonderful. My boyfriend also got a burger of course and loved his! I recommend this highly. Awesome place and the best burgers in town."}
{"text":"The food here is absolutely amazing! The pb&j burger is phenomenal! You can never go wrong the with sweet potato totes and any of the amazing dipping sauces. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"This was pretty good. The calamari was pretty good. . . a bit heavy handed on the batter, but over good. I got the Pablano Burger which was excellent! The chicken wings. . . eh, ok. The view and seating is very nice."}
{"text":"Unbelievable burgers!!!!  The combinations are so creative and tasty. Great service too!"}
{"text":"Place is very busy on weekends, plenty of burger selections and very good GF selection."}
{"text":"it's the best and biggest burger I had in a long long time. the sweet potato tots didn't disappoint as well. I had the pobalano burger and it rock. margaritas and beer are good"}
{"text":"Great food great atmosphere!  Love to bring my guests here for a casual fun time."}
{"text":"Visiting from California. We had wedge salads and bacon cheeseburgers. They were spectacular. Cooked to perfection, and the fries were crispy delights."}
{"text":"This is an update to my previous post.  I strayed from Rehab and tried Cold Beer and Cheeseburgers just up the street.  MAJOR MISTAKE!  It was way over priced, crappy food and nothing special as far as ambiance.  I actually left Cold Beer and Cheeseburgers and went straight to Rehab for desert.

 I'll never cheat on you again Rehab!"}
{"text":"Crazy good!  We love bringing family and friends here.  Service, employees, quality of food are all fantastic."}
{"text":"My birthday party at Rehab Burger was so much fun. Nine ladies kept Rocco busy, he was charming and quick to take care of us. Most of us had burgers, and I had the mushroom and Swiss and it was perfect. The fries were crisp and tasty, same with the onion rings. One of the dipping sauces has pineapple- it's light for a hot day! Rocco brought me a brownie with toasted marshmallows, ice cream with chocolate and caramel drizzled all over. Perfect for a party and atmosphere is summertime happy!"}
{"text":"I don't know how this place isn't rated higher! The burgers are amazing and the staff is always friendly. The sweet potato tater tots are my favorite things on the menu. Its a causal place with good burgers and the first place I take people from out of town to. The burgers are really big! I usually can't finish the smaller one!"}
{"text":"An above average high end burger place.  The burgers here run to the thick style. I personally like thinner burgers with more charred flavor so these were not in my sweet spot.  That being said, they are done well and interestingly topped.  I had the Jalapeño Popper Burger which was tasty but surprisingly un-spicey.  The Backyard BBQ burger had a tasty pineapple based sauce and a huge onion ring on top.  The last burger we tried was simple with bacon and tomato and onion.  We had the regular fries (pretty decent), sweet tots (sweet potato tater tots that were a little sweet for my liking). Fun atmosphere that can get loud.  Overall I like the place but due to the price ($50 for 3 with one beer) I expected more."}
{"text":"I have a love hate relationship with Rehab. First time I went I thought it was the best of the best and then it wasn't. I have been chasing that experience ever since. Today I had the special Meatloaf Mash and it was the bomb! It needs a permanent place on the menu. 

The 10oz burgers (or larger) are infinitely better tasting in my opinion. They are more flavorful and more moist. I order medium rare and the 5oz always seems dry. I almost quit going, but you know...chasing that first date fun is a hard thing and I couldn't give up. And of course the 10oz are too damn big for an average human, hence my love hate relationship. However, due to this issue we have discovered a few other treats they have to offer and highly recommend both the tuna and the club. 

Oh and the sweet potato fries with teriyaki pineapple sauce means you don't even need to order dessert."}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch on St Patty's day. The wait was about 30 minutes but we were lucky to even get a table because they were really busy. The service and food were both AMAZING! Our server was so sweet and attentive even though she had a lot going on. Happy hour from 12-6 every day?! Hell yeah. We ordered the backyard bbq and the hatch chile burger and both of them were dynamite. They give you the option for \"relapse\" or \"rehab\" size burgers, the relapse was the perfect size for us. The fries and sweet potato tots were delicious too! 

It's right next door to some other cool restaurants and bars and had a cool atmosphere. We were in town for spring training and super glad we stopped in here."}
{"text":"Everyone needs Rehab now and again.  Check in to Rehab Burger and Check out any burger on a pretzel bun.  Their pretzel bun is probably the best I've tasted.  It has that full, salty, pretzelly taste!!!     The sweet potato tots on the side were good too.  Good drink selection and awesome wait staff."}
{"text":"I cant express enough how much i love this place!! Andy the bartender is phenomenal always suggesting new things to try and he never lets us down!! This is a great hang out spot great staff and the food is amazing! Ill be a customer for life!!"}
{"text":"It's like a Jimmy Buffet themed restaurant, the only difference being that these cheeseburgers really are paradise.    Relax, enjoy the casual vibe, and don't think about the requests for therapy that you will receive from your dietician when you inform them that you are a regular."}
{"text":"Great place for unique and incredibly delicious meals!  I love the jalapeño burgers and the ambience is wonderful.  Very rustic atmosphere and genuinely friendly staff.  It is a place I recommend to everyone who wants a great hearty meal to fill your appetite.   Drinks are great.  Make sure you also try the peanut butter and jelly burger. Outrageous"}
{"text":"Loved the bacon and blue cheeseburger, but would have liked it more if the burger had bacon on top of the patty and not just in it. The bacon flavor got a 'lil lost. Overall great atmosphere and service. Be careful not to go at high-customer times though, or you might be stuck with a long wait or a seat outside."}
{"text":"Just went here yesterday for my friends birthday. I love this place this is the third time I've been here. Last two times I had the PB&J burger and I just love this one. Yesterday I had the Ghost burger, I love spicy and this wasn't super spicy but it was just right. Get the sweet potato tots with their jalapeno dipping sauce I believe the waitress told me (wish they had honey mustard but this sauce was delicious.).  Our waitress was on point and I plan to go here again for sure."}
{"text":"Oooooh man. I had the mac and cheese burger, I felt like the lady from the life alert commercials. I bit into it and fell to the floor and couldn't get up. Who thinks of these combos???? Best burger...I....have....ever....had. Hands down. Will return for the others, for science......."}
{"text":"Cool staff.  Tasty food.  Fair prices.  Check it out.  Nice atmosphere.  Cute servers!!  I like the sliders."}
{"text":"Great food. Try everything! Our server, Andrea, was super accommodating & sweet. Our burger wasn't cooked to order and she was quick to fix it and keep us happy while waiting. The misters were a nice touch, great music and just a nice first time experience."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness! I visited Arizona and on my last week there I ate at Rehab Burger Therapy twice... it is that delicious. My favorites are the PB&J burger and the Spicy Mac 'N' Cheese Burger. Service is exceptional and the atmosphere reminds me of a burger joint near the beach."}
{"text":"This is a great, casual place for some filling food. I really appreciated that they had a delicious vegetarian burger--a panko crusted bean patty. It was one of the best veggie burgers I've ever had. I wasn't a fan of the sweet potato tots. They were kind of bland. Wish I'd gotten the fries. The service was wonderful--very fast and friendly."}
{"text":"It is awesome food. People who work there are nice. I do burger wrapped in lettuce. My husband favorite restrant. It's has 2 location tempe,az and scottsdale,az."}
{"text":"Been here a few times now. Told the server to pick which burger I got, as long as I hadn't tried it yet. Every burger was probably the best burger ever."}
{"text":"I've been here three times. The food is just alright.  Burgers aren't bad by any means - they are good burgers but they just seem sort of average.  I am a fan of the chopped salad which I was not expecting from this place.  It's a good location with a colorful atmosphere."}
{"text":"Huge burgers great sides choices of bones and eclectic mix of pretty much whatever you want to burger highly recommend it"}
{"text":"My friends and me decided to hit this Old town burger joint this past weekend night. The wait to seat 4 people took over 30 minutes which was understandable seeing the large crowd and limited seating available.
We still decided to wait and explore the food options. After a long wait we got seated, offered drinks and our hostess Lauren was very friendly, suggestive from the menu list to choose our food.
We started of with the chicken wings in medium and gold sauces and some onion rings. Both appetizers were really good, wings being made to perfection. 
The real attraction were the big list of burgers on the menu.
I went with the Hawaiian Burger (medium) on pretzel bun. The burger was just perfect with little pink inside and it was a huge burger. Along with the sweet potato tater tots (best tots ever. Hands down) this burger has to be among the best I ever had.
Altogether this joint made me a big fan and I will be visiting here often from now. 
Thank you for the wonderful experience."}
{"text":"If you're hungy this is the place to be. You get the choice of a few different buns (go pretzel) along with two different burger sizes and sweet potato tots, fries or both.

When you're not in the mood for a burger than the fish tacos are a must! Seriously so good.  

Aside from this place being occasionally busy the service is top-notch."}
{"text":"If you are in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area this place is a must! It was hands down the best burger I've ever had. We ordered the Chili Cheeseburger and the PBJ & Bacon Burger and both were delicious. For the sides we got the fries and the sweet potato tots, which I highly recommend. 

We went on a Wednesday night and the wait was only about 10 minutes. Regardless of how long you have to wait, this place shouldn't be passed up. The atmosphere is fun and casual and was a good time with great food."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now. Both times were good!

I ordered the turkey burger with a side salad.
My boyfriend ordered the mac n cheese burger with sweet potato tots.

All the food was good....but the sweet potato tots were AMAZING!!!

Wait was only about 15 minutes for 2 of us. We got there right before the dinner rush on a Friday.

This place gets packed and has a long wait. The restaurant itself is pretty small so plan accordingly!"}
{"text":"the bartender was awesome, it was so crowded but he was very accommodating to our large party. From what i remember the burger was huge and i couldn't finish it. All servers were great. Burgers and Beer, eat here if your in the area!"}
{"text":"Waiter on the patio was great. Attentive, knew the menu and answered questions. We ordered wings and the burger with brisket and wasabi mayo and a few drinks. The food was amazing! The Serrano vinegarette was hands down the best vinegarette I've ever had. Gonna stalk you to get the recipe. The burger, although we were missing the wasabi mayo due to being bun less I assume, was hands down best burger my husband has ever had. And this guy is picky! I had the wings, which I always order and seldom like, tasted fresh and juicy. All in all I would definitely come back and recommend to friends. Great job Rehab Burger!"}
{"text":"OMG this place is amazing and the staff was fantastic.  I asked what they recommended and they gave me the top 3 most popular burgers.  I had the bacon, peanut butter and jelly which I was nervous about but it was the BEST.   You might as well skip the fries because the small burger will leave you so full you can barely walk out of there.   One of the best burgers I've ever eaten."}
{"text":"We ate here on 11/20/17 during happy hour. Our waitress Jori told us about the discounted beer options. My husband ordered the $1.75 can of Modelo. After getting back to our hotel room I noticed that we were charged full price for his beer. I called and spoke with a gentleman who said he was the manager. He apologized for this mistake and told me he would refund the full $5.00 to my husband's card. Well... here we are almost 2 months later and still no refund. Extremely disappointing.
The food was adequate. Service was average. And the lack of accommodations for someone with a small child was impolite. I'm suppose to change my child's diaper on the restroom floor. Are you kidding me?!"}
{"text":"What a fantastic restaurant! I am from out of town and continue to come back here as much as possible. The burgers are amazing and giant portions. The best item on the menu is the sweet potato tater tots which are truly unbelievable. Service is great, but there can be a wait unless you get there early."}
{"text":"As we walked in this fun 'sports bar' like restaurant, it felt like we were in California with the surf boards on the wall. 

The staff was very welcoming and friendly. We were immediately offered the happy hour specials. 

There were so many burger options!  We settled on the Mac Narly double burger. I split it with my sisters. I was totally satisfied with 1/3d of a burger on the pretzel bun. 

We tried the sweet potato tots. They melted in my mouth. 

I can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Since there isn't any Hodads in AZ this place will have to take the reigns for best creative menu and Pb&j Burger..........sounds disgusting but WOW, if your not living on the edge you are taking up to much space...JJ"}
{"text":"Fantastic quality greasy gut bomb food!  When you are in the mood for that kind of thing, you cannot beat Rehab. The PB&J burger is awesome, try it. Wings are good, onion rings are good, fries and sweet potato tots are good.  You won't be disappointed as long as you aren't looking for health food."}
{"text":"The burgers are this place are some of the best I have ever had. The atmosphere is really cool. The restaurant itself is pretty small, so expect a full house on the weekends and during happy hour."}
{"text":"Lively atmosphere....great burgers....I enjoyed tacoders...cod tacos. Sit inside or outside.. Happy? hour all day....will come back soon."}
{"text":"This place is like I designed it as my own restaurant.  Cool beachy theme. The sweetest servers in Scottsdale. Not just one server helps you they all make sure you get good service.  The food is cool too.  Burgers with hatch peppers my personal favorite.  And then sweet potato tatortots.  Who ever thought of something so cool.  And too top it off home made fresh pretzel rolls for your burger.  Now all I need is a banana shake.  Which they probably have with rum. I just didn't ask. They have dietcoke which is hard to find is most phoenix restaurants so I just had one of those. Which I think they filled twenty times."}
{"text":"Started off with the $3.99 yelp check in chips and salsa. The salsa and the chips are very fresh, but in reality the burgers were so big, I probably didn't need the chips! So full! 

I ordered the backyard BBQ burger, one of my favorites with the sweet potato tots. They come with this yummy sweet sauce. The BBQ sauce is nice and tangy and its topped with a giant onion ring!!
My friend ordered the Mac and cheese burger, I've had this before. It's pretty amazing. Spiced with Sriracha, poblano peppers and green chiles. The Mac and cheese taste homemade! And the pretzel bun is a win combo with all those flavors! 

My third trusty favorite is the hangover burger. You can't go wrong with bacon, egg and beef! 

Be sure to grab a jaw breaker on the way out!"}
{"text":"A very popular place in Scottsdale. We've come here twice and it was packed both times (inside and outside). The burgers here are average at best. I had tried both the Hawaiian burger and the BBQ burger. Sadly, the burgers were overcooked both times. I always like to eat my burgers medium rare...not medium well :/ I do have to say that the sweet potato tots are very tasty. Being from the tri state area, I am a bit spoiled when it comes to burgers...rehab is one of the more decent burger spots in Phoenix/Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I loved this place. It was fantastic. If I could have I would have eaten two Rehab burgers. So delicious. I will be back when I get back to Scottsdale in October."}
{"text":"Wow.... Wow... Wow.... this place is gooooood!!!! Had a bacon and blu burger with pretzel bun. The burger was delicious. Far exceeded my expectations. Let a friend has a bit of my burger, and I almost didn't get it back from them. Just Amazing... have to come back here again."}
{"text":"Only come here if you want a good pickle. 

I was really excited to try this place after its 4.5 star review from over 1000 people; however, it didn't live up to my expectations at all. 

We ordered chips and salsa and for an extra $2 you can get guac, but don't do it, it was bland, the chips needed salt and the salsa had no real heat.

I ordered the hatch burger which came with a hatch chili on it and cheese. That's it. No lettuce or veggies or even a spread (menu said chipotle aioli but that came with my tots, not the burger). The burger and the tots were luke warm at best. 

Service was mediocre at best."}
{"text":"I booked a 20 person reservation here for a work group and they were fantastic to work with.  The service was also great once we arrived and everyone was blown away by how much food each plate had.  I was told to try the sweet potato tots and I loved them!  They accidentally had given me fries instead, so to fix it they brought out a giant plate of the tots - very generous!  I have to say I wasn't overly wowed by my burger (I did a create-your-own), but it definitely was delicious.  My co-worker ordered the mac 'n cheese burger; I got to try it and I loved the little bit of sriracha spice it had.  That thing was overflowing with mac 'n cheese everywhere; it was quite the sight to see! Loved the atmosphere there with its fun vibes.  Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Best burger in AZ hands down.  If you are hungry this is the place for you.  Rehab has a wide variety of creative and imaginative burgers.  There beef patties are cooked to perfection.  The burgers i recommend there are the spicy Mac n Cheese burger and always choose the pretzel bun for your burgers.  The mac n cheese has a nice little sriracha kick to it which pares great with the meat of the burger.  The second burger i recommend is the PB&J burger.  Yes, i said it PB&J.  By far the best burger on the menu.  Be sure to get the sweet potato tots with the pinapple aoli.  Wow knock your socks off.  There Onion rings are massive and super crispy and the dipping sauce is a chipotle ranch which is on another level of awesomeness!  If you have room for dessert you have to get the pot brownie.  Nice warm brownie with the with the cool feel of the ice cream which is drenched in chocolate, peanut butter, and marshmallow.  You cant go wrong with the menu.  The food there is well worth the wait.  So WAIT!!!

{"text":"My husband and I love this place when going out for a burger. The mac n cheese burger is awesome as well as the Macnarley (I think that's the name) burger. We have tried several more and they've all been good."}
{"text":"I LOVED Rehab. Came here after an Angel game during Spring Training and it wasn't busy at all. Our server was on point and friendly, and the food came out fast. I had the PBJ & Bacon burger (no sriracha for me) and loved every single bite. I got the sweet potato tots too, and they were amazing. This is the perfect place to watch a game, get a drink, and eat a big juicy burger. I will definitely be back next time I'm in AZ."}
{"text":"Burgers Galore!  Very large portions and jumbo burgers.  I purchased my 1st ever PB&J burger here, and it was delicious. If you like a more traditional burger you might not like how sweet the peanut butter is. Burger was juicy and bacon was thick. The Arts festival was going on, so walking 2 mins off Mill Ave was easy. 
The Beach theme is cool, and staff Friendly. 

Definitely worth a visit. 
$13 for the larger 10pz Burger Option. Came with sweet potato tots, and large H2O. 

Cheers"}
{"text":"The best way to describe this place is WOW!!!!! The sliders and Bacon is amazing.....if you are in the area and pass this place up......you have really missed a special treat."}
{"text":"Was really looking forward to trying this place after reading the reviews from previous patrons.  Similar to a previous review, upon arrival we were informed of a 20-25 minute wait.  No big deal. However after ~ 45 minutes and seeing 4 parties be seated who arrived after us, we decided to ask how many people were ahead of us on the list.  The employee informed us there were still 4 groups ahead of us on the list somehow.  Unfortunately due to this individual's lack of any idea what is going on in the world, we decided to leave.  The food did just look like an overpriced cheeseburger anyway."}
{"text":"Awesome burger and cooked just right.  Friendly staff and excellent service on a busy Wednesday afternoon."}
{"text":"The previous restaurant in this space didn't last long, but Rehab Burger Therapy hit the nail on the head!  They have a great menu of food and drinks and some really tasty beers. There are about a dozen different burgers on the menu and the cool part for me (not a beef eater) is that you can sub in a turkey burger or chicken breast, instead of the beef, for no charge! You also get your choice of bun, and any place that offers a pretzel bun is a winner in my book. Burgers come with skin-on fries or sweet potato tots, both of which are really tasty.  They also serve up a half dozen or so different dipping sauces for your potatoes.  

I had their wings on my first visit, in 2 different flavors ... the medium and the Gold Medal sauce.  Both phenomenal!  On my next visit, the server suggested to a friend that his favorite was to mix those 2 flavors for one amazing sauce. I believe it... I'm still sorta day dreaming about those wings.  Mmmm, wings. On this visit I also had the wedge salad as a cooling agent to the spice. This was probably the largest wedge I've had in a while.  It also had about 3 pieces of bacon in large chunks all over it. So good... 

Second visit I had the Porkster burger ... I felt like a porkster after eating it! This burger is topped with a heap of pulled pork in their peach-habanero bbq sauce (I subbed in the chicken breast) and cheddar cheese. It is nothing short of magnificent. I ate the whole darned thing, but had to sacrifice and not eat my tots. 

The happy hour pricing could be better, but their margarita is pretty delicious and warrants me ordering it again. This is a fairly small place, but its intimate and not too noisy.  I like that they have serene underwater footage playing on the tvs and not just sports blaring at you from every angle. Its pretty peaceful.  And the service here is outstanding.  Both times my servers have been uber-friendly and eager to get you anything you need.  I will be back!!"}
{"text":"A solid four stars for this Old Town Scottsdale burger joint.  

I went with the Porkster Burger which was basically a pulled pork sandwich with a cheeseburger inside.  5oz of pulled pork piled on top of a hamburger with cheddar cheese and bbq sauce.  

Yup.  Damn good.

I've eaten at the best bbq joints all over the country and, honestly, the pulled pork sandwich would have been great even without being included as ingredients in a novelty burger.  

The sweet potato tots were also pretty tasty.

I'll be back.  There were several other burgers I've got my eye on."}
{"text":"Great food! Love this place!!!i i do not eat meat but my family does! The veggie burger is amazing! The dipping sauces are amazing. The sweet potato tater tots are amazing! We all love our food every time we eat here."}
{"text":"For the number one burger in Scottsdale I was a little disappointed in the food. I ordered the hawaiian burger which came with pineapple and ham in addition to your normal hamburger. I've had hawaiian burger where the pineapple really set off the flavor chemistry but at Rehab, they didn't use a ripe pineapple and didn't properly grill it to carmelize all the sugar from the fruit. 

The sweet potato fries were actually sweet potato tater tots, but I loved them with no reservations. 

The service was pretty prompt and friendly, all of the servers looked younger. I really liked the atmosphere too, good music and nice decor inside (it was too hot for me outside)."}
{"text":"Fun, relaxing atmosphere, with great crazy tasting burger combinations!"}
{"text":"1 star is what they deserved. No spinach, no steak, food came out cold and bland. Not impressed, at all. Brought some of our friends who are out of state and they were also very displeased with the food and service. Bad, bad."}
{"text":"Love this place! The food is amazing and the atmosphere is a blast. The staff are all friendly and outgoing, I don't think I have had a single bad experience with any of them. My boyfriend and I practically lived at this place during a particularly rough semester when we needed to treat ourselves to some good burgers and drinks on a more regular basis. The owners are extremely friendly and can always be seen walking around making sure everything is up to standard. The chef is an awesome guy, we had the pleasure of talking to him for a bit during on of their slow times. I love meeting people who are passionate about what they do and no one has more passion than a good chef. He was excited to hear what we had to say about to food and even gave us samples of some of the dishes we had not been able to try yet. If you go on a weekend or during lunch time, expect a little bit of a wait. But trust me it's worth it. And if you go on a Sunday, I would HIGHLY recommend their Benedict Burger! A thick slice of ham on a patty with a nice big egg on top, tucked into a pretzel bun and drowning in home-made hollandaise sauce!!! The next Sunday I have off will be spent devouring one of those bad boys."}
{"text":"A winner in Old Town Scottsdale.  Sure it is a burger place, how good can it be? Well, I am telling you it is pretty darn good.  

The vibe is a laid back kind of beachy shack, not huge with half of the seats outside. We had a great waiter who was helpful, friendly and checked on us often.  

Good happy hour. Decent beer selection and the burgers are legit!  I had the hatch burger on the pretzel bun (beyond yum) and fries.  I loved it completely!  

Really fun, laid back place.  I would come back!"}
{"text":"Most flavorful burgers. If you like sweet potatoes, try the tots and ask to try all the sauces. I'm a Chipotle aioli kind of guy."}
{"text":"We shared the Hangover and it was really good. Burger cooked exactly MR the fries were hot and yummy, no extra charge for extra ranch OTS and the place had a super cool vibe. Happy we finally tried it and will be back for sure with the rest of my family."}
{"text":"Okay,  ya know when you walk in before noon and it's pretty packed AND there's a table with tired,  looking,  hard-working crew (maybe landscapers) all seated looking full..it's gonna be plenty to eat!  

So,  two in our party ordered the PB&J, bacon & Sriracha burger.  I ordered the Bbq burger with the chef's creation of spicy pineapple bbq sauce. So you need to know the \"Rehab\" burger is 10oz of flame broiled deliciousness and the \"Relapse\" burger much more manageable (but still plenty) with a 5oz patty.  You get a choice of a brioche or pretzel bun..we all opted for the pretzel bun which was perfectly soft but held together well for the burger that definitely is smothered & covered in the respective sauces. 

A bit after ordering we realized waitress hadn't asked us of the size of burger & after checking,  she'd assumed the guys wanted the larger size (one didn't) & mine the regular size.  So,  PB&J burger had plenty of thick, crisp bacon, no skimping there!  The grape jelly & peanut butter melt with the hot burger creating a bit of a slippery handful!  One in party said too much pb...he said would order again, without the pb. The other said would absolutely order again.  Mine,  absolutely smothered in tangy bbq sauce, not too spicy & cooked perfectly!  Sauce everywhere! 

They did great job with correct meat temp. All had the sweet potato tots-delish! The sweet & savory dipping sauces also very good.  We had elsewhere to be so couldn't take leftovers but was stuffed full! 

Ok,  so this is a little thing but in the restrooms they had actual towels to wipe your paws off..this was very nice! 

Fun,  surfer - dude decor, good music and bar! Fun place!"}
{"text":"Awesome place to chill and have delicious burgers and food!!!  Burgers are so big you can share them!  This place never disappoints!"}
{"text":"Hands down the Best Burger in Town.

Was in the mood for a burger and had to try this place.  I went for the Mac Gnarly Burger and upgraded to a side item of Jamaican Corn (grilled).

The corn was really good fresh corn on the cob.  Yummy.

The burger.  Oh my goodness.  So yummy and the ingredients tasted so fresh and healthy.  It was not a grease burger.  Lean beef that looked and tasted very fresh.  I orderded it medium and it came out perfect.  The pretzel bun was a nice touch to it.  This is a remake of the Big Mac, or should I say the way a Big Mac should be.  $12 bucks for this sandwich.  It comes with 2 5 oz. slides of beef.  None of the the burgers here are cheap.  That is the tradeoff.

These people know how to do burgers here.  The staff was wonderful.  Very friendly.

This is not a fast food burger joint.  You have to wait 15 minutes for your burger.  It's more like a bar and grill restaurant."}
{"text":"Bartenders = just annoying as can be - the type of people who you intentionally avoid eye contact with in hopes they don't speak to you - kind of like you would with a crackhead that is on a muttering, ranting binge attacking anyone who comes too close to them.  Boynerds on a self-manifested coolguy pedestal  dancing to their own tune (read: Rebecca Black's \"Friday\"). If you do sit at the bar, please make sur eto take note of the tool pool (read servers) that feed off every move the tenders make - like groupies at a One Direction concert. Except it's all guys. all guys.

Wings = Quite good actually, though the menu says they were supposed to come with celery, which for some unknown reason really upset my girlfriend when the celery didn't show up. 

PB & J Burger = 2 words (food poisoning) - yep, thank you Rehab for allowing me to enjoy my first bought of this wonderful gem. The idea is controversial, but from the common opinion from staff and patrons alike, we went for it. Maybe they are good when cooked properly - but that's not what I got. I got a hot pile of slop in the shape of a burger. All I could taste was mushy,warm peanut butter and the juices of meat that I suppose was the burger. My gf and I split 1 burger. I ate 3/4 of my half, she ate 2 bites. I already had a lump in my stomach. We paid and got to safety."}
{"text":"PB&J burger all day.  Peanut butter, Sriracha & grape jelly.  It tastes like a spicy sweet bbq burger.  You will not regret it.  We moved to Scottsdale 3 months ago and have already visited multiple times and will continue to do so!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Great service and the food was excellent!! 
Couldn't decide what to have and our server Cheryl was very helpful with recommendations. Highly recommend this place and super laid back environment!!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here a bunch and they are consistent with great service. I'm super critical when it comes to burgers and I think the meat could be more flavorful. Atmosphere is great and everyone is always happy here. Nice place to hang out."}
{"text":"This place was overall great with very reasonably prices considering the portions. This was honestly one of the best burgers I've ever had with some amazing fries on the side. The fries do not cost extra like some places and the place itself is nice. Very friendly staff and we were seated within seconds. I would definitely recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Love this place!!

I'm gluten free, so I love that they offer gluten free buns, and lettuce wraps for all burgers and sandwiches! 

They're sweet potato tots are sooo good!! And all of their dipping sauces have been amazing so far! The pineapple aioli is to die for!!

I've yet to taste anything I didn't like! 

The staff is very friendly, and you hear several \"byes\" and \"have a great days\" upon leaving - even when it's busy!! Awesome place!!"}
{"text":"always good food and good service! My boyfriend had a hawaiian chicken sandwich and I split the wings with a friend. Soooo good! Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"One of my favorite burger joints in the valley. Love the vibe that I get when I walk into this place, the great service and the wonderful selection of beers. FINALLY got my first pumpkin beer of the season being that everyone has been out!! I have been here several times and bring someone new every time. I will continue to come back and support this lovely, laid back, local eatery. Keep doing what you're doing Rehab, you guys are amazing!!"}
{"text":"Probably the best service and friendliest people I ever met (and they were busy!) the food was absolutely amazing and I can't wait to go back! I had the turkey burger which was huge. Tons of different burgers to choose from or build your own style."}
{"text":"Best burgers around!  We went there for the first time today, recommended by a friend, my wife and I both looooved it. 2 thumbs up!  Staff was super friendly, attentive, atmosphere was fun like at the beach, and the Backyard BBQ Burger was amazing!
Thank you Rehab for the great experience, we live way down in Gilbert, but we're definitely heading back up there again :)"}
{"text":"Get the pretzel bun. I had the hatch burger, which was good, but really its all about the pretzel bun so just get whatever burger sounds the best! Also the sweet potato tater tots were good and i'm not a big sweet potato person so thats saying something."}
{"text":"Super friendly staff and I loved the laid back atmosphere. 

Right when I walked in it was packed but I was offered a drink and it ended up only being a 5 minute wait.

I got the bacon burger which was pretty satisfying and not overcooked. My girlfriend got the PB&J burger with bacon. She said it was definitely different but she did enjoy the burger. Just be careful because it is VERY messy. Also I got the normal side of fries which were excellent. 

Andrea was our waitress and she was SUPER friendly and helpful as this has been our first time there. I am a big burger guy and I wasn't disappointed. 

Also reminded me of being at San Diego which I had just came from which was awesome. Beachish atmosphere with super relaxed music. Honestly no complaints here!"}
{"text":"Had a late lunch here today (2:30). Place was pretty busy, but were seated right away. Service was friendly. Don't understand what the big deal is, though. Food was average at best. Had a bacon cheeseburger, couldn't taste the cheese, although I did see it. Burger itself had very little beef flavor. Sweet potots were ok, would rather have actual potatoes. Also, they were cold when arrived at the table. It was no problem sending them back for a hot batch, though. Onion rings were cold also. Ghost burger is HOT! Women's restroom is odd, and poorly arranged. All things considered, not worth the drive for me to go back. There are plenty of good burger spots nearby."}
{"text":"BURGERS BURGERS EVERYWHERE! This is a burger lover's heaven. They have pretty much any type of Burger you can imagine. Mac n Cheese on top of a burger- CHECK, Peanut Butter & Jelly Burger (it is amazing) CHECK! If you like sweet potatoes TRY THE SWEET POTATO TOTS- They will blow your mind! It is worth the workout that you'll have to do after! The staff there are all wonderful and nice!"}
{"text":"Delicious sweet potato tots!! Highlight the sweet potatoes, and order those! We had the backyard bbq and the porkster burgers. Service is fast. Burgers are cooked to order with custom buns. Lots of meat. I thought the chocolate milk shake was just okay. Love the side sauces to choose from, excellent addition to the food."}
{"text":"I love Rehab Burger so much. It's my favorite all around restaurant in Old Town and it's also a great place to take guests and friends. The atmosphere is friendly and the service has always been on point for us. 

The menu is amazing, the variety of burger options is so great. We always start with the calamari - it's exceptionally yummy for a burger spot (order a side of buffalo sauce with it if you love hot sauce, their buffalo sauce is delicious). I've tried at least four of their burgers if not more and they are all perfect. My roommate always orders the PB & J burger and won't have anything else. I usually just get a classic burger with bacon, yummy cheese and a pretzel bun. Always get the pretzel bun, people. I love everything about Rehab besides the nap I need to take when I leave ha. I'm not kidding, go to Rehab Burger! And try all of their sauces too :) -- forgot to mention that above."}
{"text":"I have been to 48 of 50 states.  I'm a foodie and love trying the local restaurants.  Hands down this is one of the, if not THE, best burger I have ever had.  Staff was great as well.  I went in at 8:30 not realizing they close at 9 but they were still happy to serve.  It was so late and they were so busy earlier that they had run out of french fries but they were happy to sub some delicious onion rings.  If I'm ever back in Scottsdale I'll be back at Rehab Burger Therapy!"}
{"text":"Excellent burgers and great service. Would have liked my medium rare to be on the rarer side that's all."}
{"text":"Awesome experience! The peanut butter and jelly hamburger was really good! Little scared about it when I ordered it but it was really good. Will be back again"}
{"text":"I'm so sorry that I'm just having Rehab two days before I'm leaving to go back to Los Angeles. I got the pbj and bacon burger, I was feeling adventurous and I'm glad I was, my burger was amazing. The peanut butter, jelly, sriracha and bacon are an epic combination. 
The sweet potato tots were so tasty, I could have eaten an entire plate of them especially with the pineapple teryaki aioli. 
I might just have to eat there for lunch tomorrow before I leave."}
{"text":"REALLY enjoys this new addition to our area. The burgers were very good! We had the PB&J and bacon burger, the hatch chili and cheese burger and the green chili and cheese burger. They were all delicious as were the sweet potato tater tot's. Very friend and efficient servers and fun atmosphere. We will be back!"}
{"text":"I dont remember the last time I had a really good burger, Oh wait, yeah I do, It was here at Rehab Burger!    

I had the Hangover burger and it was pretty damn perfect, a fried egg, bacon, colby jack cheese and a hatch green chili! Let alone on a pretzel bun and choosing between the large RELAPSE size or even larger REHAB size.  I got Sweet poTOToes on the side with the chipotle ranch sauce and ive never had better.  I highly recommend this place, plus it has a great happy hour and its in old town but the crowd is nothing like youd expect when youd say that which is a plus.  I cant remember my waiters name but he gave awesome service and will be back again!"}
{"text":"Jesus* has returned as a savior and fry cook and in Scottsdale, AZ turning ground beef into patties of bliss. I know this because no one else can make as epic a combo of perfectly cooked beef and just the pepper bite as their hatch chile burger. That more places don't have sweet potato tots is a crime against man. Do yourself a huge favor and get the tots.

{"text":"Biggest down-side is they need to admit they have outgrown their current location. Food was amazing!  Started with pig wings. The sauce was sublime. Had a margatini. Excellent cocktail. No watered-down margarita here.  The burgers exceeded our expectations. Husband had the porkster - a perfect blend between a cheeseburger a and a pulled pork sandwich. He loved the pineapple the waitress recommended to add. I had the jalapeno popper burger. Cool avocado and spicy poppers on a great cheeseburger. Sweet potato tots for both of us. Where have those been all our life?  Hubby was driving, so I enjoyed a second margatini - and then a nap when we got home. This place was super!  Service was great, and we will go back."}
{"text":"This place is the absolute best! One of my favorite restaurants in Old Town. The food is so darn good whether your eating healthy or splurging. The vibe is chill, music is great, and the service has been fantastic. Bartender Kaye is awesome."}
{"text":"Disrespect. My girlfriend and I chose this place because of the menu and the reviews, we came in very optimistic about it. Unfortunately we had the opposite experience. It's been a long hot day and my girlfriend and I were craving a ice cold beer. My girlfriend had a question about the size of a beer and he insulted her intelligence and told her she's acting like a 19 year old. This obviously upset her right off the bat. He also mentioned that because of our California license being vertical that we cannot order our drink. Major let down. Must be the law, but we double checked and the law passed April 2016 that it IS accepted. The second time he came along we showed him the law article just to kindly ask if we could order now. He came off stand offish and threw his hands up in the air and said \"idk man\" and then we ask for the manager and he threw his hands up again and walked away. No one came. We felt so disrespected as customers and he made us feel like we were being jerks. We looked at each other and walked out equally feeling pissed off and really ruined the excitement. This guy had a buzz cut and arm sleeve tattoos and really needs to be mindful on how his words and actions come across to others. It really gave us a bad taste in our mouths.  Now we're enjoying our dinner down the street and along with a delicious cocktail."}
{"text":"Never been here and was the first time checking it out after hearing all the good word about it. I got the pb and j burger. Ahhh man what a good burger. I will have to definitely come back and try some of the others some time."}
{"text":"Super bomb but wanted one of these awesome burgers after 9pm! Gotta stay open later, you're on mill!"}
{"text":"Awesome!  Professional.  Great food.  Great service.  So glad to have finally got a chance to dine here."}
{"text":"Cool place, feels like it should be on a beach. Laid back and casual. Usually a wait to get a table. Great happy hour. It is not possible to leave hungry! The burgers are huge!"}
{"text":"Peanut butter and Sriracha burger is the best burger I've ever had. I go back to this place just for the sweet potatoes tater tots."}
{"text":"I'm here on vacation and was excited to try this place based on the yelp reviews. I love burger joints and always seek them out when I travel. This place had a five star vibe, but for me the food I sampled was a little more average than that. PBJ burger (which I usually love) was way too sweet for my taste. The sweet potato tater tots were paired with an odd, sweet sauce when I was looking for something savory. As a major plus, however, they accommodated 10 people on a busy Friday evening and they were very nice to the children."}
{"text":"Needed a \"dog friendly\" restaurant in the area after a vet appointment and they certainly did not disappoint!  Easy parking right next door, fun and quirky atmosphere, and EXCELLENT food with huge servings.  The pulled pork burger was amazing- even with us both working on it there was no finishing that sucker!  The service was very friendly and went above and beyond to make my pup feel welcome.  My boyfriend and I will be adding this place to our regular date night rotation!"}
{"text":"Sat at the bar and had a perfectly made swiss mushroom burger and sweet potato tots.  Just great.  Bartender was friendly and replaced a beer I wasn't thrilled with when he saw me slugging my way through it.  Nice.  Staff genuinely likes each other and is having fun.  Good management, great atmosphere, solid food.  Decent value too.  Can't beat it."}
{"text":"Amazing and unique menu with a great vibe. Sweet potato fries/tator tots were amazing! Busy area so parking is always annoying but thats not their fault."}
{"text":"I love this place!! Awesome beach vibe and chill little spot for drinks and tasty food. Service has been great every time. The PB&J Burger is seriously out of this world! TRY IT! Get it with the pretzel bun...You'll be hooked!"}
{"text":"I had been meaning to check out this spot for a while before finally getting to it tonight. Having tasted many great burgers over the years, I have very high expectations, and I can honestly say, they were met with flying colors!

First, the service was absolutely pleasurable. Our server was super chill, nice guy and did not bug us every five minutes. He was friendly and helpful.

The food: I tried the PBJ and Bacon burger after some hesitation and man, it was a real great treat! I think everyone should be adventurous enough to give this one a try...be dangerous and live a little! Sweet and spicy, the peanut butter jelly and chili really had a surprising twist - a very much BBQ like taste...very delicious. Instant favorite. I had a bite of my friend's cheese burger and it was great, but of course not as adventurous as mine haha!

The sweet potato and skin-on fries were both delicious, rounding out for a great epic burger dinner. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This is a great place.  Seems you always have a wait to be seated, but it's worth it!
The variety of burgers and fixin's is great.  I've tried several and never been disappointed.  Because of it's uniqueness, it's a great place to take folks from out of town."}
{"text":"Terrible cut of meat, too much fat in the pulled pork.  Taste was meh, I could have heated something from safeway for half price."}
{"text":"I brought my haircutter here today to thank her for a nice job. We started off with the Calamari.  Large portions and very tasty. The marinara sauce could use a little more punch with more herbs.  

I don't think I ever had a bad burger here. Great little place to grab a burger in downtown Scottsdale.  Burger was perfectly cooked.  Good bread that doesn't fall apart when you start grabbing your sandwich.  I think I've eaten most of their beef burgers except the PBJ (Peanut Butter and Jelly) burger.  PBJ on a burger doesn't really thrill me, but I've heard it's really popular.

My haircutter had the Hawaiian Burger and she loved it, but I think she would loved anything after finishing off three frozen margaritas.  I pity the person who gets their haircut after I drop her off at her shop. LOL."}
{"text":"Amazing burgers, good atmosphere, super super friendly staff, large drinks. It's a recipe for a good night.  try the brownie!!"}
{"text":"Came again on a weekend (Saturday) and I will not be coming back. The service was horrible. The hostess could not estimate a wait time to save her life and didn't say more than 3 words to us. The server couldn't remember our order although he was writing it down and then didn't bring us our appetizer or drinks. We pointed this out when he brought our burgers, he seemed annoyed at us and didn't apologize. He brought us our check mid-way through the meal (I kinda wanted dessert) and disappeared. Also, is it a rule that none of the people that work here are allowed to smile? The burgers are good, but not good enough for me deal with the poor service. :-("}
{"text":"I looked forward to Tempe opening for weeks. They have a good reputation at least at the Scottsdale location. My family and I went recently. My daughter and I both ordered well done burgers, not burnt. They served us both extremely over cooked meatloaf on a bun. It was so dry I had to drown it in ketchup to eat it. My daughter only ate a few bites. They were very expensive which made me feel extremely disappointed. My daughter and I always get our burgers well done anywhere we order them and they are still juicy. For the price they charge they should teach their chefs to cook a burger right. Just don't order well done and you should be fine. Loved the atmosphere and the music! So much potential. Could be a new chef but Im sorry those kinks need to be worked out before you open for business and charge on the high end."}
{"text":"Great place to go if you want to be adventurous and try something different. PBJ burger was good and fun to try. Boyfriend had the mac and cheese burger which was also good but the mac and cheese was kind of bland. Sweet potatoes tots are killer and come with interesting sauces. Great location. Parking can be difficult at peak times."}
{"text":"One of the best burger joint in town , the quality of the patties is top notch . Get the poblano burger !"}
{"text":"This is keeping up my streak of amazing restaurants I've tried in the past month or two, loved it! Was surprisingly busy when we went, which was on a weeknight, there were no tables available inside. Sign that this place has got to be good. Also I love the California-type decor and vibes going on, cool looking!
We sat outside and the heat lamps were like burning us so when I go again if it's cold I'd probably wait it out and sit inside haha. Our server was awesome, very attentive. Wait staff deserves a high five! The menu was huge, and once I realized you could substitute a veggie patty for any of the regular burgers that made my decision a little harder. I decided to just get the regular veggie burger though because it comes with avocado! My boyfriend had a tough time choosing between the turkey burger or the bacon burger, but he couldn't resist the power of bacon. Another nice thing is that you can choose what kind of bun you want, wheat, pretzel, or brioche. We went for the brioche, but I'd like to try the pretzel! Was feeling indecisive for my side so I asked for half sweet potato tots and half regular fries. Was an excellent choice, best of both worlds haha. They were both perfectly crisp and yummy sides, the tots were especially good when I stuffed a few into my veggie burger. Oh and the veggie burger was phenomenal! It was kind of unique too which I love! White beans, black beans, and panko crusted, yum! Also the avocado on top was so fresh. I usually refuse to cut my burgers in half but this one I had to because it was massive. And messy! But so tasty. I liked the aioli it came with too, was the perfect touch. My boyfriend enjoyed everything as well and we both ate way too much haha. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Best burger in phoenix! Love the atmosphere, service, and people too. Laid back scottsdale burger joint/bar. I had the poblano rehab burger and cajun corn. Went the extra mile to give us refill cups to go. A place that many professional locals go to lunch and will be back for happy hour!!"}
{"text":"Such a cool spot in old town, and one of the best burger experiences I have had! We waited about 40 minutes during prime time on a Saturday night. We ended up sitting on the patio (table of 7) during an awesome AZ Winter night. It is not a huge place, so I am guessing a wait is pretty common. I like the semi-tiki theme and am kicking myself for not trying a mai tai or one of their cocktails. I went with a bottle of red stripe from there decent beer menu. My 5 star rating is all about the food. There were at least 8-10 burgers I considered ordering. I went with the spicy mac and cheese burger. Mac, bacon, jalepenos- whats not to love? It was everything I thought it could be and more. Everyone at the table had a burger, many varieties, and they were all a hit. Big flavor, quality toppings, and solid fries on the side as well. When I get that burger craving, the hangover burger is the next one I am crossing off the list. Thanks for the rehab!"}
{"text":"My first ( last) time visit. Fri 2 pm. 

I wouldn't recommend this place unless it's 11 pm your already drunk and you want warm food that's half way decent.

First, Its very small inside. The bathroom was dirty, and nothing to wipe hands on.

Waitresses, All haggard. Seem like they have been burnt out of the business and couldn't get employment other places than Dennys. ( being 100 percent honest)
My waitress was horrible, not attentive, Never brought napkins or refills,  forgot items etc.

Food came med warm, sent fries back because cold. 

I wouldn't repeat. I do suggest the health dept do a food and cleaning check."}
{"text":"Consistently great food and service.  I enjoyed a wedge salad with a bbq burger and it was really delicious.  Awesome stuff!!"}
{"text":"If your looking for a good or unique burger this would be the place to go. This was my first time there and I played it safe and got the mushroom swiss burger, which was very good and tasted like a good burger you can get most places. The people I was  with though really went all out and got some of the crazy unique burgers on the menu. Like getting a friend egg on the burger. If I ever return I will def be trying something more unique. I am not usually a sweet potato fan, but the sweet potato tots were actually extremely good and the sauces paired with them really gave them a unique but awesome flavor."}
{"text":"Whenever I visit Scottsdale this is where I go. Great burgers and the best wings ever. Hoping to be back in June. Great atmosphere and service and prices are not bad. Cold beer as well which is always a Plus in Arizona."}
{"text":"3.33 
The laid back atmosphere was perfect for this flip flop wearing type of guy. 

The service was amazing, not so much our server, but the rest of the staff were on point. The hostess (with too much eye makeup) was by far the best employee they have on today. She was running around and helping everyone, while doing her job perfectly. 

I ordered the 10oz Hatch Chili Burger, medium rare, with fries and a Dr Pepper. The bill was $13 or so before tip. The burger was cooked perfectly, red and juicy. The burger was not seasoned or very little. I tried a bit of salt but it was still lacking. The chili and the cheese were good, the brioche bun was good. The whole thing as a burger was a bit bland. I used the Chipotle Aioli to season the flavor a bit.

The fries were forgettable and were on the colder side when we got them. 

Overall, I did like the place, I would go again. I would just ask for salt and pepper on the burger and a salad indstead of fries."}
{"text":"Very satisfying burger! Definitely one of the best around the old town area. Drinks were okay. I ordered a frozen margarita and it was mostly just tequila with nothing much. Overall, I've had fun experiences during the day and night and would definitely  bring family and friends."}
{"text":"We ate a couple great burgers and the chili cheese fries all amazing.  Happy hour is almost all day on Thursdays.  When we come back to AZ we will find ourselves back here."}
{"text":"This was a great place to get something different. All three of us had something different and they were all excellent. Sweet potato fries with dipping sauce were fabulous."}
{"text":"Verdict: Yes to this kind of therapy. Just stick with the single or you might actually need some rehab.

Okay, so I got the the PB&J burger with the pretzel bun. It's a crazy combination of peanut butter, jelly, bacon, and burger. Right about now, you're probably saying ewww but don't knock it 'till you've tried it. That burger was great and the pretzel bun was sturdy enough to keep it together.

They have a lot of creative options if what I got isn't appealing. For any burger, get the single or split a double with someone. It's a lot of food. My friend got the fish and that was huge too. You won't leave hungry.

The sweet potato tots were underwhelming for flavor but the burger made up for it. Maybe try the regular fries. Either way, I'd totally go back here. Too bad I don't live anywhere remotely nearby."}
{"text":"My fellow AA members (affordable alcohol), you need not worry about your massive hangover!

For it has become a burger, yes The Hangover is not just a movie & a state of \"man I'm never gonna drink like that anymore\" feeling; you know who you are Mr. Patron!
Now a Hangover is also a burger served at the Rehab Burger Therapy!  When I first walked into this bar I thought of Bar Rescue on Spike -- where's Jon Taffer!?  The place had some pretty cool decor and design; surfboards, guitars, and an aquatic background.  

Anyways, I sat at the bar where I was greeted with a smile.  Great service here I must add!  Read the menu up and down and decided to go with the Hangover.  Boys, I saw her first!  It was DE-licous with a capitol D!  For Damn!!! That was good!  Medium done with bacon, fried egg, colby cheese, and green chilies - Yum!  I went with the Relapse, which was a smaller version of the regular sized burger.  HH everyday till 6pm so if you can make it I definitely would stop by.  

The place has the rock n roll, surfer, tiki ambience.  Reminded my friend of Hawaii she claims.  I've never been to HI, but personal I'm content with being at the Rehab for now with a few drinks and enjoying a Hangover - yes I said enjoy the Hangover. - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Rehab has the best burgers in town period. I  have tried almost every burger and I have yet to be disappointed. The burgers are always fresh and delicious. I love their bar and happy hour. The staff is also super friendly. If you want to have the best burgers in town, you need to come to rehab! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere, thick/juicy/tastey burger, delicious sweet potato tots, and my bartender/server/possibly-owner ended up being a pretty nice fella who supports both Uber and Lyft (a wise choice since many people leave here intoxicated). Rehab definitely has a San Diego, beachy vibe, reminiscent of Hodads. I'll return to try another of their wide array of burgers for sure."}
{"text":"If you're wanting to get a good quality burger then come here. The burgers are huge and everything they have on the burgers is over flowing! I got the Mac N Cheese burger and it had jalapeño and poblano peppers on it. It was so good!!! The service is quick and the staff is very friendly. Definitely a place to hangout with friends if you're in Old Town!"}
{"text":"Had the Spicy Mac n Cheese burger.  I was not prepared for the mound of mac n cheese that accompanied my burger.  It was just the right amount of spicy and absolutely delicious.  Went with onion rings on the side--equally delicious, and everything was served with ranch and ketchup.  Trivial to some but a great touch to me:  the ranch was fantastic.  Our server was wonderful and was really knowledgeable about the menu, answered all our questions, and was generally awesome.  I'm only in the area for a few months, but I will definitely be hitting this place up again before I leave."}
{"text":"Over 900 reviews? I was excited about trying this place.  When we walked in, I saw a few open tables but was told 15 mins wait... (It wasn't lunch or dinner time, i think it was around 3pm on Sunday).  After perhaps 5-7 mins wait, our table \"became\" available... but it seemed that particular table was available from the moment we walked in..  This place was very busy and slow service was expected.  When our server spilled a drink, she said \"that's why I brought extra napkins...\"  

If you check in on yelp, it's $3.99 for chips and salsa.  Chips were thick and I wondered if these were homemade at this restaurant.

I ordered mimosa with cranberry juice. Never had one before and I thought I would try it. I think I prefer one with orange juice.  Now I know..

The burger I ordered was very big, I ate about 1/3 of it and couldn't eat anymore.  Very huge. Perhaps I wasn't that hungry, but I thought I had better burgers before.  Perhaps it was a bad day for me."}
{"text":"RBT is the place to be. Full of eclectic fun and outstanding food. The burgers are larger than life and made with love. 
We ordered the chips and salsa which came to us as a thicker tortilla chip and a sweet salsa that complimented well. 
We ordered the Porkster and the Bacon Cheeseburger both Relapse sized. I ate the pulled pork first thinking I could eat the burger next, but I was foolish! Add the sweet potato tots to that mess and I was so full there was little room for breathing. 
Also keep in mind that Relapse size is still as big as your face, so order wise. Also a good time to go to RBT is in between the dinner and lunch rush. Even though the place serves the biggest burgers, the actual established is small. Lines form fast and in a blink. 
We had great service and I also recommend the pretzel bun, just because I can and because it was delicious."}
{"text":"I finally made it in after seeing the incredible Yelp reviews... and wow, they did not disappoint! The depth and breadth of the menu is fantastic! You honestly cannot go wrong.

Hopefully the amazing Kay is working the bar, and you have made the proper choice of ponying up to the bar.... she is remarkable. She will even answer questions you didn't even know you had!

Enjoy! #yum"}
{"text":"Awesome. Chicken breast version of Poblano Burger. Great fries. Service was top notch. Thanks!!"}
{"text":"Met some family at Rehab Burger and was very excited to give the place a try. Upon entering, the vibe is lively and the setting is eye popping. Impressed at this point. Our server made her way over and took our orders and again, impressed to this point. She was outgoing and offered a few recommendations. We started with the guacamole and chips. Nice to see a little yelp discount on the chips but not very impressed by the item. Chips and guacamole were both just okay in my book. For our burgers, I rolled with the PB Burger and others had the Blue Cheese Burger and the Burger covered in BBQ Pork I believe (sorry forgot the name). As for my burger, I loved it. The PB was oozing out and oh so yummy. The recommended bun was on point and the fries were good. As for the other burgers, the Blue Cheese filled Burger just missed the mark. It was very dry, I mean very dry and felt bad for family who ordered it. The Burger covered in BBQ Pork was good. Again, burger was a little dry but the pork was good. Overall, the PB Burger was amazing but the others just missed. I would give the spot another try but at this time, won't be giving any super praise."}
{"text":"Excellent burger, ambiance and service. Laid back place to hang out. Not a date night place 
Had the hangover burger 10 oz. w white bun rare. Very good - done perfectly. My wife had the ghost burger. Spicy w the perfect amount of heat.. Not overwhelming. 10oz is big not huge. Will come back next time I am in AZ."}
{"text":"Delicious. I love that you can get the different sizes, and the different fries/tots options. 
I had the Relapse Hangover Burger - and it was plenty. Couldn't have finished a Rehab if I wanted to. 
Husband had the Rehab either Hatch Chili or Poblano burger. Either way, it was delicious. We both ordered our burgers med rare, but his was more on the medium side. 

Would definitely come back; parking is the only drawback."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the top 2 burgers I've had IN MY LIFE. Fresh baked bun, well seasoned meat... I had the mushroom and Swiss with grilled onions. Sweet potato tots were awesome. The place was completely packed and we still managed to get a great seat and fantastic service!"}
{"text":"What a great burger I had at rehab Burger therapy. Down-home place with absolutely spectacular burgers and sweet potato fries. I highly recommend it. If you ask for your meat medium rare you get it that way. If you asked for your bacon crisp it shows up like that."}
{"text":"Beachy feel to this place!

Just off of Scottsdale ave, without that Scottsdale feel...thankfully.  

Anywhoooo...great beer selection and...they have corona-ritas! HOLLER!

Ok...for the burger.  I got the Hangover Burger.  Green chile (could have been hotter), Bacon (OH THE BACON!), EGG..yeah...an egg!  This thing was delicious!  Onion rings...kinda felt like I needed a crane..these things were HUGE!  The burger had a great flavor and cooked perfectly medium.  Just how I like it.  My bff got the PBJ burger.  Peanut butter, jelly, sriracha...yeah I know right? But damn that thing was good.  Very much like that one dog at Short Leash!  Try it...you'll see!"}
{"text":"Wandering old town Scottsdale and felt like a burger. How lucky we stumbled upon rehab. Lots of great drink specials! Burgers were really yummy - I had a bbq burger and my hubby had the special, a jalapeño popper burger. Sweet potato tots were fun and the regular fries had great seasoning. Service was great, super friendly. Nice patio seating area."}
{"text":"Service was good, food was delicious. I never would have expected that peanut butter and jelly with sriracha could possibly work on a burger, but somehow it does. I would order it again in a second. Tater tots were great too."}
{"text":"Soooo good. Enjoyed our visit. Food was great and so was the service. We made modifications to our meal and our requests were met with a \"can do\" attitude. We will be back."}
{"text":"Great food, great service... Awesome beach vibe! I have the hangover burger and shared some wings. Both were phenomenal. I really enjoyed the reggea playlist! Great spot to chill and eat after a long day at work!"}
{"text":"I love this place! We were lucky to find two open seats at the bar upon arrival and skipped a longer wait on a busy Saturday night. It's a small place so be prepared to wait if you visit during peak time. A highlight for me was the ability to sub out any one of the awesome burgers for a chicken breast. Tue Mac n cheese burger subbed with chicken was one of the best things I've ever eaten. We will definitely come back if we travel through Scottsdale again."}
{"text":"Wow, one word discerned the food the service and ambiance. Poor describes the restroom situation. Had to wait in line 20 minutes to wash my hands, if you don't to use the facilities great if you do terrible.

The burger was juicy and hot until I was done. I added the onion rings which were not greasy at all and the only dessert they serve the brownie with ice cream is to die for.

Can't wait to go back next week with my daughters. My wife and I sat outside and enjoyed a perfect afternoon."}
{"text":"I really liked this place, especially liked the name of the place, very clever. A friend of mine and I stopped in for happy hour and enjoyed a couple of drinks that were both good and reasonably priced. We came on a Monday at 1pm and left around 2:30ish. There was quite a crowd there during that time, many of whom were enjoying some really nice looking burgers. What I liked most was that the patrons were made up of people of all ages, young to old. The ambiance is inviting and easy to enjoy, they have indoor and outdoor seating with shade. The waiter we had was great, no complaints. The only potential problem I can see here is parking. We parked directly north of the restaurant in a dirt patch. Other than that, it didn't look like much parking was available."}
{"text":"Truly the best restaurant i've been to thus far since moving out to AZ two months ago. I got the pulled pork sandwich & it was not a normal pulled pork. The flavoring/sauce was SO GOOD. And the portions are huge! My boyfriend got the barbecue burger and he said it was one of the best burgers he's ever had.

The decor, music, & overall vibe was what really got me hooked though. I'm into the whole surfing/beach life so finding a place like this in the middle of the desert is beyond perfect. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I was looking forward to checking this place out after reading the reviews on Yelp.  It's decorated in a beach theme and seems like a fun atmosphere.

I sat at the bar and it took a little while to get my menu.  I ordered the bacon cheeseburger.

And then I waited.  And I waited.  A half hour after I sat down at the bar I still didn't have any food.  I put a couple bucks on the bar for my Sprite and walked out."}
{"text":"Stopped in while in Phoenix, had the Mac and cheese burger, it was very good, cool restaurant and fun atmosphere"}
{"text":"Awesome burgers! Definitely recommend the jalapeño popper burger on a pretzel bun. Fun environment & nice staff. The dessert that had hot brownies, ice cream, marshmallow fluff and peanut butter was AMAZING. We split it amongst 3 people and we all enjoyed it!"}
{"text":"Hey!  Wanted to stop by and say Thank you from the bottom of our full bellies!  Last Wednesday night, I brought a friend from Colorado to rehab, as part of her journey.  She was here on business, and coming there was, as always a great visit and vibe.  We were chilled on the patio... But the staff scrambled to heat up the patio.  My guest had the pesto pasta, I had a bacon cheeseburger, subbing for blue cheese crumbles.

As always... You didn't leave room for any disappointment.  Thank you!  See you again soon!"}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem. We live out of town and found this on yelp. We ordered too much food. I don't even remember what we got. Something with a pineapple bbq sauce and something with macaroni and cheese. Excellent food. The service by our waiter could have been a bit more friendly, but the food was great."}
{"text":"Swung through here for lunch while visiting AZ.  Super chill spot.  Service was good and food was on point.  Would go back for sure."}
{"text":"My wife & I stopped in for lunch the other day....been meaning to try this neighborhood gem for some time ( some of Rehab's staff hang @ our club : Karsen's Grill , right around the corner ). Totally satisfied with the burgers .....my swt. pot's were great ! Our server was totally cool; she was knowledgeable about everything in the restaurant......we're definitely coming back for the pineapple desert !"}
{"text":"Visited Scottsdale for the first time in late February. Went for an early dinner when we arrived after our flight. Waitress very helpful and accommodating. Place was very laid back and fun. Was not busy (we went early). Food and drinks very good, and very reasonable for burgers, especially for Scottsdale. Try the PB&J burger- sounds odd but delicious! The sweet potato tots and fries are both delicious too!"}
{"text":"Seriously some of the most unique and delicious burgers I've had. They should come with a warning sign that you're going to need about 40 napkins and maybe a fork, because some of these burgers are really stacked. Mac and cheese burger was exactly as awesome as it sounds. If you've never had a PB&J burger, this is the place to try it. Sounds weird but was really good. Fries and sweet potato tots are both amazing. Went back multiple nights in a row just to try different burgers.

Décor is really fun, too. It's small so it gets crowded fast. I tried to go early, around 4PM for dinner thinking it would be emptier but it was just as packed. 

Staff was super friendly and attentive. The only thing I didn't understand were the way they set up the drink specials because it was like a \"pick your own\" alcohol plus soda but it never really worked for me. I'd stick to the regular drink menu."}
{"text":"If happiness is derived from a great meal, then I am the happiest man in the world. This place was awesome. The BYOB with lettuce and bacon was mouthwatering. The service was quick to respond and very friendly. The atmosphere was relaxing and I will be a valued customer from now on. Burger please, I do believe. I am now an avid fan of this great little nook in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Really 4.5 stars but the half isn't the option. Only a half because it is a little expensive for a burger. 

First off, gluten free and customer service are my issues and this place is solid on both these issues. The creative manner that they can make a burger is spot on. The servers were helpful and professional. 

Definitely try the spicy Mac and Cheese, my son absolutely loved it. 

Parking can be a little challenging but the lot next door was available. I would also suggest the outdoor patio seating."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers I've had the pleasure of eating.  Service is prompt, friendly and more than willing to offer suggestions for neophytes.  Pricing is about what you would see at the other \"gourmet burger\" chain, but this place is a better bang for the buck.

Had the chili cheeseburger with onion rings - a true fork and knife burger, but everything was great, down to the brioche bun.  The onion rings are about 1\" thick and beer battered, and well worth the upcharge.  Other options include sweet potato tater tots as well as conventional skin-on French fries.

Most definitely will be back for more."}
{"text":"5 stars for everything I tasted. Onion rings, know poblano burger, salad with and awesome spicy sweet vinaigrette!"}
{"text":"This is probably one of my favorite burger joints in the whole US!! They have a really great variety of amazing burgers. I've been here several times and I still can't wait to return every time. You can't go wrong here! This is the first restaurant I recommend to anyone asking for a bite to eat in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I was seriously craving a burger while I was in AZ and decided to come here and check it out.  My guy and I came in around noonish and were promptly seated outside.  It was a nice day out but the sun was beating on us so we decided to move inside.

As we were looking at the menu, we realized there was happy hour til 3.  Sweet.  We ordered a couple of beers and the hangover burger burger (rehab) to share and regular fries.

The burger was a perfect medium with all the juices, cheese and sauces blending together so deliciously.  I could taste a hint of the hatch green chili which gave it a nice little kick.  Loved the fried egg, loved the bacon= great burger!  I'm glad I shared it though because between the beers and fries, I was barely able to finish my half of the burger."}
{"text":"Omgeeee!!! The FOOD is Delish... BUT the service is THE BEST EVER... is there a better word for best?! K AND BEETLE RULE!!! Come here ALOT and show them how much you love them!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service and we loved the décor and atmosphere!  I don't live in the Phoenix area, but visited a lot over the years because my father and grandmother both moved there a while back.  This place caught my eye while I was with my MIL and daughter on a spring break vacation.  What a fun place - lots of neat, cool and just plain bizarre stuff for décor, which is just what I enjoy, and we all were very happy with our food and with the service.  We were there on a weekday, just after what's considered prime time for lunch.  I'd recommend it to anyone who likes a variety of foods [prices were reasonable, as well] and likes funky places."}
{"text":"This is a must hit when I visit Scottsdale. Awesome little place in Old Town, which is a super attraction in its own right. I've always sat outside and since I'm from MN I consider this a distinct pleasure. They usually have New Belgium \"Ranger\" on draft. Love that beer. The burgers never fail. I had the \"Hangover\" on this visit, but I can swear by several others too. Then there's the chill atmosphere with an impeccable music playlist. Restrooms with towels ...awesome and very clean. Can't wait to see you again in late March."}
{"text":"I know this is a burger joint. I went in to try out the burgers. They were decent. The fries too. Sorry to report, the burger was not the star of the show. This review is all about the Pig Wings. I have had some in Orlando a while back and they were my first encounter. The Pig Wings at Rehab are more of a Hawaiin Fusion BBQ sauce. In my opinion is an improvement from the first ones I tried in Orlando. So, needless to say, I'm hooked. So much so that I have had them for lunch more times than I would like to admit.  The service was great. The place gets busy so be sure to keep that in mind during lunch or dinner times on the weekends. The menu is extensive and they offer beyond the burgers and wings mentioned. It is for sure a spot that anyone can find something on the menu to sample. Check it out."}
{"text":"Rehab is one of my favorite burger joints in the valley. The variety of burgers is great, can opt for a pretzel, white or wheat, get to choose if you want a \"relapse\" or \"rehab\" size and then the lovely choice of sweet potato tots or fries. For the price, you can't really ask for a better burger or portion. Cheaper than Zinburger and also superior."}
{"text":"Brought friends from out of town. 

Chips and salsa were great! Chips seemed to be homemade. 

Burger was HUGE! My wife and I shared, it was AWESOME! 

Parking can be nuts, and it's a small joint."}
{"text":"Great Friendly staff, Food portions and quality Great. Jamaican Corn is a MUST Try. Best Bloody Mary I've ever had (it was the spicey one) Not too hot just right ;)"}
{"text":"Second time visiting this location, I am always intrigued by their extraordinary menu and love that they have a variety of options. My meal today just felt like it was done before my partners because nothing on my plate was fresh, however, I still ate it. On the bright side the corona-Rita made up for the burger's shortcomings. Hopefully if I visit again this won't be an issue."}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would. Service was awful. We were seated right away and our drink orders were taken. The server forgot half of the two of our drinks and never brought the other one until our food was there. They forgot to put in our food order. We waited 20 minutes for them to ask us what we ordered because he forgot. They then brought us the wrong food from a table next to ours that arrived after we ordered. By the time they were done eating and paid we almost got our food. Five more minutes went by and we got chard burgers. We had also ordered ranches with our meal and asked again when he brought it. We finally got that 3/4 of the way through eating. I wanted to like this place since I've heard such good things but it was an awful all around experience."}
{"text":"My burger was tasty but not spectacular. The pretzel roll was actually the best part of the burger. The decor and vibe were cool."}
{"text":"Awesome burgers! Gotta try the PBJ, bacon hamburger! Staff was very friendly, manager was awesome! We live in Washington, if we are ever back we are definitely going to this place again!"}
{"text":"Best burger of my life. My coworker and I came here on Tuesday for dinner. This time I had to bring my crew of six.
I asked the server what she recommended and she suggested the PB&J bacon burger with scirracha (spelling?)  sauce and a pretzel bun. 
Best burger of my life!! Sweet, savory, spicy, salty. I wanted to try something different for this trip but I couldn't. I knew I would regret it. So I tried to convince my partner to order the jalapeño popper burger, but lo. 
I also love the sweet potato tots. Again, I wanted the Jamaican corn, but lo. 
Will be here again the next time I find myself in Arizona. Perhaps they have a room to rent I the back....."}
{"text":"I returned home here in the east last night, from visiting old friends in Scottsdale, AZ last week. One of the things I like to do is eat at local places that are recommended by local people. (They always know best!) So on Friday evening, they brought me to Rehab Burger Therapy.  I must admit, the name had me just a little worried. But my friends said \"You WILL love this place!\"  I am SO GLAD they brought me here. The atmosphere is exactly what I like about these local places. You could tell the people were locals who came often - because it was good! This isn't a fancy, overpriced restaurant. It's a great local establishment that is obviously busy for a reason! Even though it was busy, the service was friendly and attentive. The burgers are SUPER! I also enjoyed the sweet potatoes - heck, everything was good. If someone from the business reads these, THANK YOU! Next year when I visit again, I WILL BE BACK! After we left, I told my friends that we have to come back next year and they said they go there all the time. I'm going to recommend some Burger Therapy to anyone I know who is heading out west to Scottsdale! Thank you again!"}
{"text":"Absolutely loved this place. It is all the hype. I got the philly cheeseburger (5oz) which came with either fries or sweet potato tots. Those toys were just amazing! Especially the dipping sauces for the tots. Burger was huge and I only finished half but it was sooo good. They had a wide variety of burger options too. Definitely gonna come back to try other burgers and appetizers, despite the long wait (30min or so). 
And service was great. Our waiter Sam was really nice and accommodating and funny."}
{"text":"For a place that prides itself on being a 'burger joint' & has a large menu of fun burgers, the actual patties are pretty gross. They are dry, poorly cooked, flavorless and way over sauced. I wouldn't be interested in spending any more money here, especially for what you get at this price point. But at least the fries and the aioli were decent. Granted, they also might have only tasted good because of how bad the pulled pork burger I had was."}
{"text":"Best burger in a long while. Great job with Hatch Green Chili even for those from New Mexico. Also great Sweet Potato tots, never had such before, unique."}
{"text":"Probably my favorite place for burgers. The place is always busy and the staff has always been great. The burgers are creative and more than filling. My favorite has gotta be the Porkster, relapse size."}
{"text":"Besides having a waiter high as a kite and our orders being wrong and cold, the burgers were okay. We tried the Mac n cheese burger and the poblano, both were cold whenever they came out and I'm sure that's because our waiter forgot our food. Once we had it, he asked us how we were doing every few minutes when he didn't speak to us very much in the beginning. Probably not going to visit this location again but we might try somewhere else."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Awesome food for reasonable prices! Staff was very friendly, we will definitely be back!   Very unique burger choices, their sweat potato tots are the best! This restaurant does not disappoint."}
{"text":"The picture says it all really good food, great service too. Will come back whenever im in town"}
{"text":"Been to Rehab several times this year, I go to Scottsdale about once a month to play and I think this will be my new go-to spot!
The first time in I sat on the patio....waited 15 minutes for a waitress, then went and found her and asked for a beer....never saw her again. But I am very glad I went inside and tried again. The bartender helped me, apologized for the poor service outside and proceeded to make me a convert! I have been back several times since and the staff and owners are great. John and Reno the bartenders, as well as Denise, one of the owners and a very pretty addition to the place, have all been very friendly and made me feel at home every time. The food is great, the atmosphere is relaxed and welcoming. Absolutely going back!"}
{"text":"I was not impress.  My daughter asked for fries and corn with her cheeseburger and the waitress even repeat the order and forgot her fries.  I ordered the hatch burger with sweet potatoes tots and when I went to the restroom these other table had more tater tots than I did.  I was pissed off.  I had like 9 pieces and I didn't say anything.  Then my daughter went to the restroom and noticed the same thing and told me mom how come you only got little bit of tater tots and the other table theirs are over flowing with sweet potato tots.  .  I didn't say anything because I don't have time to get upset over tater tots."}
{"text":"I just can't tell you how much we love this place!  We tell everyone about it and they always thank us for the recommendation.  
If you don't get the PB&J burger, you'll be sorry.  Seriously.  Sounds weird but it's just that dang good!  The staff is fun and friendly. It's an absolute must visit place for us every year during our spring training trip.  Sometimes we go two days in a row. ;)"}
{"text":"This is hands down my favorite burger place in old town. Definitely get the pretzel bun and if you like hott then ask them for the ghost pepper cheese for that extra kick that's on the secret menu!"}
{"text":"With a daily HH from 11a-6p... this place is def appropriately named. With hippie, beach vibes, Rehab provides a great escape for guests looking for a quick drink or a hearty meal. 

Drinks:
Personally, I like a beer with my burger, but their HH feature a number of alternatives if that's what your heart desires. 

Food:
**disclaimer** Great burgers are one of two things holding me back from being a pescatarian so I'm slightly biased.

I asked the bartender and the waitress about their faves & worked my way down the list...

The PBJ & Bacon Burger: 
A- amazing!
B- better try one ASAP!

I traditionally loved peanut butter on a burger, but was def hesitant about the jelly - I hate grape jelly & adding the J felt like overkill, but it worked marvelously! Plus, the pretzel bun sealed the deal for me. Show your kindergarten self some love & try it! 


The Spicy Mac-N-Cheese Burger:

Another combo of things everyone loves. Things to note with this one:
A- the mac'N'cheese is fab! It made my super Southern, super picky heart smile.
B- the burger is ginormous! I think it took me three sittings to finish it. Come hungry, leave happy! 
C- about the spiciness... As a NOLA native, I know spicy. I love spicy. I live spicy. There's def a kick to it, but it's more like a tiny toddler throwing a tantrum kick than a black belt karate kick. Expectation management is everything. 


Most burgers come in relapse (10oz) and relapse (5oz) sizes to fit your hunger level.

They offer an assortment of accompanying sauces for pairing.

Fries were standard. You can go halfsies on fries/ sweet potato tots if you like.

One of my friends loved the Know Poblano and my vegetarian friends raved about the veggie burgers. The food is def the highlight at this spot.


Service:
Expect goldilocks service at this place- not too great, but yet not terrible. They'll prob get your order right, but don't expect much as it relates to attentiveness. 

Ambience:
Vibrant. Youthful. Neighborhood bar vibes. Great for solo sipping at the bar, table for two, or group outings!"}
{"text":"In town for a long weekend with ma' boys for spring training.  Dodger game was sold out so we wound up going to the Giants game which is a few blocks from Old Town Scottsdale.  Snuck out of the game in the top of the 8th because all the starters we're out.  Wandered those few blocks back into town and stumbled into Burger Rehab Therapy.  Got a table just in time as the \"after game rush\" was a few minutes behind us.  The place was buzzing.  Staff was pleasant, fun and attentive.  Reasonably priced drinks were ordered, served quickly, and tasted wonderful.  Second round was ordered immediately and again served in a flash.  For me, music can add or subtract from a dining experience. For this encounter it was a big plus.  Good classic rock & roll, the Stones, U2, the Eagles, and for good measure they threw in some Beach Boys.  The only thing missing was Stairway to Heaven and Free Bird. The place was filling up fast with the \"tardy goers\" but I didn't notice any change in the pace at which our troop was being taken care of.  We reviewed the menu and discussed the many choices with each other as well as the servers.  They were happy to outline the choices in detail and include the \"extras\" locals (not us) usually enjoy.  This was a big help in deciding.  Among the squad we wound up going all burger.  No shrubs or calamari for these cavemen.  Again the service was stellar.  Quick and on point. Burgers were cooked as ordered.  The man-boys had the Porkster, the Hangover and the B.Y.O.B. We had onion rings, skin-on fries, sweet potato tater tots and Jamaican Corn.  I went way off the radar and had the PB& J Bacon Burger on Brioche.  Oh my word! It was sloppy. It was sweet. Couple that with bacon, cheese and a well cooked beef patty and it was hands down the craziest and one of the best burgers I have had in a long time.  It was a sticky, sweet, savory, tasty, mess of a burger. I felt I needed to take a shower afterwards because that peanut butter was everywhere.  Even found a little behind my ear the next day at the Angels game.  I wholeheartedly recommend this place to anyone that wants to relax, enjoy a good meal, enjoy some music and make new friends.  Can't wait for spring training 2019.  Save a taco, eat a burger!"}
{"text":"Best burger I have had in a really long time. They come in two sizes, the largest one was the perfect amount of meat, filling me up without me wanting more. Hawaiian burger used real pineapple, not the canned kind. Swish and mushroom was also very tasty. Good quality beef, cooked to perfection. A nice array of dipping sauces that the waitress brought out without us even asking. Variety is the spice of life"}
{"text":"The burger was excellent, and so was the service!  I had a \"Know Poblano Burger\", and it was very tasty and creative!"}
{"text":"We are huge foodies, and we are so glad to have discovered Rehab Burger Therapy! Here, we had one of the best burgers we've ever had, and we've tried a lot of burgers.

As extreme food fans, we're always looking for a good burger with a twist, and we found it at Rehab Burger Therapy. We ordered the server's recommendation, which is their 'hangover burger', and we customized it.  This burger has a fried egg, bacon, colby jack cheese and a hatch green chili. We customized it to include their ghost pepper jack cheese and crispy onions with a side of hot sauce - and it was simply fantastic. No hot sauce was needed, the burger stood on it's own merits. :-)

Instead of ordering standard french fries, we opted for the Jamaican Corn, and WOW - phenomenal! I could order that every day. Our server told us that their Jamaican corn (which is a Jamaican-spiced corn-on-the-cob) is deep fried - and cooked this way, it was perfectly done, juicy and perfectly spiced. We've never had fried corn before, but it was definitely some of the best corn we've ever had.

Try their corn at least once when you visit - you will not be disappointed. And the burgers? You can't go wrong! Loved it!"}
{"text":"Came here the other day around 5 pm. The inside area was completely sat (maybe because it was 110 out) so we decided to sit on the patio. I had the Mac and cheese and a burger, the food definitely made up for the scorching heat. Great place to grab a burger if you feel like having a cheat day."}
{"text":"Three stars is good by my standard and worth the experience. 
Hit: Fun, energetic Saturday afternoon atmosphere. Great people watching with an essence of Mission Beach (San Diego).  Burgers were great, I had the hatch green chili burger and it was phenom. Service was quick and to the point. .

Missed: Wasn't as big a fan of hubby's PB&J burger, but it was definitely a fun experience to try. They were out of the famed tater tot so we had to miss out. Also, worth noting that it definitely feels more like a bar than a restaurant - \"not that there's anything wrong with that...\" but make sure you get in the mindset. 

All said, a good experience and fun to try something different. ."}
{"text":"Just ate here for the first time and it was amazing. Great ambience and very very friendly staff. The service was great and the food was even better. I had the bacon cheeseburger in a pretzel bun with sweet potato tots. I've had my fair share of the sweet potato tots but these are by far the best I've ever had. They come with two dipping sauces, spicy ketchup and garlic aoli. I found myself alternating between the two sauces every other tot. Delcious. I heard about this place thru word of mouth and will definitely be spreading the good word about this establishment."}
{"text":"The place for a really good hamburger!  I got the taco hamburger and its enough for two people.  It cam with fries..........which seemed to be home made.  will be going back for another kind of burger."}
{"text":"So much food! Service was great food was great! No wait for a table! Try Mike Tai! Won't disappoint."}
{"text":"This burger place is one of the under meat and eateries of Valley. 

Rehab ranks higher in my over The Grind. Portion Con-trol or Outta-control are some the nice perks of rehab. Their pretzel bun game is hella strong. 

For only being here for the second time ever, this place needs to stay on the rotation of yum."}
{"text":"Our burger was cooked to perfection. Fried calamari dish was well done. The size of both dishes was very big. 
All day happy hour on beverages is unbeatable."}
{"text":"Overall I was not impressed with this restaurant.  The Burgers we had were decent but they were all lacking something to make them amazing.  Maybe I have just been spoiled at other burger bars but attentive service here and decent food.  I probably wouldn't go back here when visiting the area."}
{"text":"Like to switch up your burgers? You've come to the right place. PBNJ burger? Jalapeño popper burger? Need I say more? OK, Ghost pepper burger was my choice and let me tell you...it was superb!!!"}
{"text":"Food (4 stars): After consuming so much food since we are on vacation, I wanted something on the lighter side, so I opt in for the Shelby's Shpinach Shalad. It is a spinach salad topped with walnuts and blue cheese and drizzled with a sweet/tangy strawberry vinaigrette dressing. My fiancee got the Chili Cheese Rehab burger. Note: the rehab burger is burger than the relapse burger. The chili cheese burger was not bad, however, I still prefer chili cheese burger from Tommy's in Los Angeles, CA just because there was nothing spectacular about the burger from this restaurant. We substitute the fries for the sweet poTOToes. The sweet poTOToes were a little under cooked so the outer shell of the tots were not crispy and the inside was soggy. 

Sauces: We tried Pineapple Teryaki Aioli, Chipotle Aioli, Chipotle Ranch, and Pesto Aioli. We were not a fan of the pineapple teryaki aioli since it was too sweet but if you are looking for something interesting to try then this sauce would be it! The sauce we liked the best was the chipotle ranch. 

Service (4 stars): The server checked on us every so often to see how we were doing. 

Ambiance (4 stars): There is in and outdoor sitting area on high bench chairs with umbrellas to provide shade. This is a chill place for those who are looking for a place to hang out after work or on the weekends. There is a parking lot next door. 

Overall, I would come back for the salad and to try the other burgers."}
{"text":"I have been to the Scottsdale location and I wanted to try out this location. First off great location. They are located off of Mill Ave and there is parking super close. The staff was awesome. The general manager greeted me at the door and she also made her rounds checking in on her guests. My hamburger was super good. I had the Tractor Pulled Pork. The BBQ sauce was delicious and the meat was so tender. I would get again. I had corn on the cob as a side and it was amazing. They added some seasoning on it and I loved it. I would eat it just as an appetizer it was that good. I enjoyed my food and will for sure come back for some more. I can't wait to go back to Rehab."}
{"text":"Creative and amazingly delicious food!  Get the sweet potato tots with teriyaki dipping sauce.  I love the peanut butter and jelly, bacon and sirracha burger.  So good!"}
{"text":"Maybe the best burger places I've ever been, and I can't wait to go back. Inexpensive drinks full of flavor, solid staff who went the extra mile, and outdoor seating right in the middle of it all. Had to wait 45min to seat 3, but it was worth it!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night and shared the PB&J Bacon Burger 10oz! So. Much. Flavor. Sweet jelly, spicy peanut butter and crispy bacon. Cooked to perfection, huge portions, and quick service. We were in and out within 30 minutes. We sat on the patio which was decked out in surfer themed decor."}
{"text":"Really Good.  Went with a buddy and his couple of younger kids.  It was loud and they are loud.er.  Perfect place for them.  Food was good, drinks were good. Had the Hawaiian, cooked perfectly.  Sweet Potato tots are always a good alternative to simple fries.  Will be back"}
{"text":"So before my favorite burgers where from delux on camelback. Then my friends took me to this place. This is now my number one place in az. Amazing atmosphere, service is a little slow, but food is the best."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite burger joint.  The BBQ burger was outstanding.  The 10 oz rehab patty was more than enough for 2 people.  The service was great as well.  Try this place, your going to love it."}
{"text":"We decided to try Rehab because it smelled good.  I can not ever remember having a burger that was this good.  Service was fantastic.  We will be back"}
{"text":"So far so good. I had the Mac & Cheese burger on pretzel bun. I ordered the smallest one but it was still huge and i could not finish this burger. It was so so delicious tho, i had the regular fries with it. My fiance had the BBQ Burger, we ordered the smaller one and that was still a big burger also. He said it was very good also and had regular fries with his. The place was so Cali surfs up style but clean. Everyone was nice we were greeted as soon as we walked in.  Im hoping to go today since i have to drop off my rental car in Scottsdale. Im really wanting to check out the PB&J bacon burger i have been hearing so much about and jalapeño popper burger. This time ill try the sweet potatoe tots. I will be doing another review for the other burgers if i end up that way today."}
{"text":"We went here for lunch over the weekend, having heard great things. The place was absolutely packed, which seemed a strong indicator of the quality of the food, and the service was great. Naturally, I was expecting the burger to go hard (this place does have the word \"burger\" in the name, after all), but, wow, what a disappointment.

I had the Know Poblano Burger. First, let me say that the combination of grilled poblano and manchego cheese was excellent. If that had been all I ate, this would be a different review, though. The problem with flavorful toppings is that you cannot use them to disguise an under-seasoned burger, and that's exactly what I got.

There was virtually no salt or pepper on the patty -- a big issue when the beef is 3/4 of the actual burger. Does anyone in the kitchen have basic culinary training? I'm not even a trained chef, and I know that if you forget to season the main ingredient and attempt to cover it up with ingredients that are seasoned, the whole dish comes out bland. You can't put spicy poblano and salty, melted cheese on top of a flavorless puck of beef and expect me to like it.

Even the bun was soggy, which is mind boggling. How does a place that specializes in burgers not know to put some sort of leafy green between the meat and the bun? This is textbook stuff.

Also, the place was hot. When there's a weekend heat advisory, you might want to turn your thermostat down a few notches -- especially when the restaurant is packed with warm bodies.

By the way, that second star is for the fries, which were perfectly cooked."}
{"text":"This place is so great there is a line outside the door!  Staff is friendly we were seated quickly and the environment is totally casual.  The menu is pretty extensive with plenty of burger choices as well  as sides.  My bbq burger was great, the sauce was sweet and smoky, and the onion rings I ordered were perfect.  I received 5 huge ones.  Wait staff is really friendly and makes you feel completely comfortable.  I'm definitely going to be back."}
{"text":"Best burger in town!!! 
Amazing service, delicious food!! 
This is a must try if you are in the mood for a burger!
Go right now!!!!!!"}
{"text":"We bought a groupon a few years ago and loved it and went back this past weekend and it is exactly the same as I remember...delicious! The buns on the burger are amazing. We brought our three year old and the server was so sweet with her. Will go back over and over again! They have a great happy hour time frame :)"}
{"text":"We USED to like this place, then ......Lunch @ 230pm, my party was all returning customers.  Good service, the waitress was very knowlegable.  I got (2patty--$14) Ghost burger, huge, made my stomach feel bad, & too spicy!  My dad got the same thing he got lasttime, Black &Blue burger. He asked the waitress \"is there any bleu chz in this?\"  she said \"yeah it's stuffed inside the patty\"---he even said \"well it seems theres hardly any\"---she did nothing to reconcile this.  My bf had one of the (single-patty, med-well) burgers w/peppers on it (undercooked in some parts!!)--plus he got the mushy sweet potato tots (bleh). For 40$ (no alcohol &not incl. tip) 3people, you might as well go to Carls Jr"}
{"text":"Gotten take out order twice now, and both times service has been speedy, complete and kind. Last time the bartender gave us extra sauces to go because he thought that we would like them. My wife and I love this place and are looking forward to our next take out! Go for the hangover burger with sweet potato tots + the gluten free buns are AMAZING!"}
{"text":"Amazing food. Will be back again. Had the sweet potato fries, onion rings, and regular fries. All we do good. Pulled pork sandwich huge and so great."}
{"text":"Rehab was just what we needed, without realizing it! Were searching for a place with a local feel and they certainly delivered. The food was fresh and varied; everyone at the table sampled. The onion rings were especially delicious. Best of all, free parking at the surface lot next door!"}
{"text":"Pretty good, would have given it more than 3 stars if they had fresh SEASONED turkey burger patties.  Their patties were from a pre - packaged store, like Costco ' freezer section...I could do that bland at home. I had the Hatch Chile Turkey Cheeseburger (I don't do pork or beef) and it was good; the toppings and the pretzel bun put the bland formed turkey patty to shame. My sister had the Know Poblano Burger (turkey too), she liked it and LOVED the pretzel bun. O'rings were good and so were the fries; better than most.  I was a bit disappointed because of the use of pre-formed turkey patties because it didn't really appear that they seasoned the patty and they charged extra for the choice of turkey. I understand it's a burger place, I know their speciality is beef...but pre - formed turkey patties...meh!  I will say, the other diners looked like they were enjoying their chow.  Don't know if I will go back, unless they figure the turkey patty thing but I will say...looking at the other diners eating their beef, they looked pretty happy. So...you eat beef...go! Turkey....just don't be shocked about the bland pre-formed patty...BYOSpices! 

Tip: Get the Pretzel Bun...it is nice and light...D-licious!"}
{"text":"First time here and I do have to say that they hyped up this place way too much. I got the mushroom Swiss burger and the Mac and cheese with bacon. When the food came out, the burger tasted very plain and to be honest it did not have a fresh taste and it wasn't juicy like I expected it to be. Very dry and tasted microwaved. Our waitress was very distracted. She was taking our order and her focus was on other things. Our Mac and cheese that was supposed to be our appetizer, came out the same time as the burgers which irritated me a lot. The look of the Mac and cheese looked tasty but as soon as k tried it, it tasted very plain as well! Overall, I do not think I will come back to this place but it's always good to try new places."}
{"text":"I love Rehab burger. I had my birthday party there and it was the best. The staff was the best!!!! Only 15 people said they were coming, but 38 people showed up. The staff went with the flow and had no problems seating everyone. I was really impressed when the staff brought the right food to the right people! There wan't any confusion of who ordered what. The staff is super friendly, personable and  take time to help you order when you're unsure of what will crunch your hunger. The food is amazing too!!!! I would eat there any day of the week. I love burgers and they are on the top of my list of places to eat. If anyone has a large group of people and not sure where to go, this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"We had a late lunch here and it was delicious! The pig wings - I can't even describe how amazing they were. You must have the pig wings, they were so tasty. I wish that they serve the pig wings on the East Coast because I would have those every week. I also had the peanut butter and jelly burger which I know sounds questionable, but it works. It's different and you should try it once you get over the fact that there's peanut butter on your burger. Swing by if you're in Scottsdale because this was definitely one of my favorite restaurants we ate that during our trip."}
{"text":"Loved the mushroom & Swiss as well as poblano if you want something spicy...
Very hip atmosphere, feels like on vacation."}
{"text":"This burger joint has my favorite cheeseburger in the universe! I could eat there daily but I eventually wouldn't fit through the door. We came here for my husband's birthday, our daughter got the peanut butter and jelly burger and liked my cheeseburger better. So, remember that sometimes what you know is better than the excitement of the unknown. Joe's birthday dessert was a double brownie with Reese's peanut butter cups melted between the brownies, toasted marshmallows, vanilla ice cream drizzled with hot fudge and caramel. I took a picture for you! The food is amazing. It is a little loud in there due to its popularity and it's a very casual place. Shorts, t-shirts and flip flops are the norm and they have a full bar. You can't go wrong! It's a small place not really set up for babies and toddlers, so leave them with a sitter and enjoy the cool vibe of this gem."}
{"text":"I have been here twice, both times we sat at the bar.  Both times not stupid busy but busy enough.  Our burgers are always amazing and I love that they have so many other options to choose from for people who do not eat burgers and such (like my vegetarian sister)  So if I were to come I could get my burger as usual and they could have all the time in the world to read up on the rest of the menu.  I like the hangover burger the best because I love eggs especially over easy on my burgers.  Kind of a constant staple for me lately.  I have to go and try their shakes and pot brownies still. so once I try more and the desserts I will add more to this review. But if you are looking for a great burger spot in Scottsdale this is my first choice for this city!

As far as service goes, nothing worth raving about but its never horrible. Consistent is the word for their service but not persistent if that makes any sense. So if you need a refill...Speak up."}
{"text":"This more a review of bartender \"Kaye\" than the food.  Ordered wings which were (actually) delicious but watching Kaye in action was great. Super attentive, communicative, enthusiastic and cheerful.  Really sets a great mood for the place."}
{"text":"I  LOVE LOVE LOVE Rehab Burger!! The food is awesome, there are two sizes, Rehab (bigger) and Relapse (smaller), the smaller burger is really big! I always get the Bacon cheeseburger, mainly because I am to scared to try new things....but....the other day my friend tried the PB&J burger...I know, that's what I was thinking too, how gross peanut butter and jelly on a hamburger, disgusting.  OMGawd!!!!!  IT WAS AHHHHHH-MAZING!!!!  It was so good! The sweet potato taster tots are awesome too.  Feels like it's always super busy when I go there, but I guess that speaks to how good it is.  The wait staff is not the best, every time I go no matter what day or time of day, the wait staff is pretty slow and sometimes forgetful.  If you can overlook the so so waitstaff (they are always friendly) and go solely for the food...you will NOT be disappointed !!"}
{"text":"We were not impressed with our first visit to rehab burger!  When we got there for an early lunch, they weren't busy at all, but the hostess tried to sit our table of 6 at a table for 4, just squeezing extra chairs in.  We had to complain to get moved to a bigger table.  Service was SLOW!! We waited forever to get our order taken, then after 30 minutes when the food finally came they hadn't even put my husbands order in to the kitchen, so he had to wait FOREVER to get his food, we were all done eating when it came out.  The food was ok... I wanted a lettuce wrapped burger but they were out of lettuce so that was kind of a bummer.  Also I ordered well done and my burger was really pink in the middle.  Overall not impressed, will not be back.  I'm not sure why so many people like this place! 

*** also to those asking if this place is kid friendly I would say it depends on the kid.  They have no kids menu, and it is LOUD in here.  My almost 2 year old didn't like the loud music.  Also they tried to seat us as a bar height table and stack 2 high chairs for him to sit on, I don't see how that is safe."}
{"text":"What a Great Clean suprise in Scottsdale , with all the over done facades, this place KNOWS HOW TO PLEASE the customer right from first contact !

{"text":"Hubby had never been here before and had been wanting to try it so we decided to go on our way to the aquarium. I had already been here before and knew how good their burgers or so I was looking forward to it. I also knew to come hungry so it was a good thing that I skipped breakfast! This time around I opted for the Philly cheese burger on a pretzel bun. The shaved ribeye paired with the provolone cheese and sautéed peppers and onions was a match made in heaven. The burger was cooked perfectly and the dollop of cheese whiz they topped it with made me think I was back in Philly. Hubby ordered the Chili cheeseburger on the traditional brioche bun. We decided to split half-and-half and I'm glad we did. The chili was full of flavor and topped with cheese and sour cream. One of us got the sweet potato tots and the other opted for  onion rings and I would be hard-pressed to say which was my favorite. Both were delicious! Neither one of us could finish all of our burgers so we had a pretty good size takeout container to take back to our furry daughter back home. Service was really good and even though they were extremely crowded our server did a good job of checking up on us every now and then. Hubby enjoyed it (as I knew he would!) and can't wait to return to try one of the other many burgers that he wanted."}
{"text":"Seriously creative burger menu! I mean, when have you ever seen a macaroni & cheese burger or a P B & J bacon burger? Well, they have it there and we ordered them! Well I didn't, but people at our table did...  And I think they were 10 OZ. burgers. You had your choice of 2 sizes; rehab or relapse. We're talking some big burgers here! They said the mac n cheese was very good and the pb&j was very interesting. Both plates left not a crumb, so that tells you something, right? I especially liked the choices of buns & sides and the sauces to accompany them were great. 

We started with calamari which I thought was a wimpy thing to do since they serve it everywhere. However, they proved me wrong because it was really good! Breaded strips of calamari steak with a fantastic marinara style chunky sauce. Yum!

I opted for a lighter fare - or so I thought, and ordered a salad. Here's the lowdown on it:  Rodrigo Da Vinci -A spanish masterpiece created with a blend of iceberg and romaine lettuce, tomatoes, cilantro, scallions and corn tortilla strips tossed with chipotle ranch. Then topped with spicy grilled chicken sauteed in peppers and onions, more tortilla strips, shredded cotija, cheddar jack cheese, a dollop of sour cream and a sprinkle of cilantro. it's art for your hunger! it was really tasty. My only complaint was that it was way too overdressed.  I should have thought to say light on the dressing or order it on the side.  Next time...

All in all, a terrific place and the service was great too!"}
{"text":"Bought lunch for my employees here last week to try it out for the first time we all loved it.  Had the spicy Mac and cheese burger for lunch and was so full only had half.  Ate the rest for dinner that night.  So amazing.  
Will be back!!!!"}
{"text":"Been going to Rehab Burger for months now and absolutely one of the best burgers joints in town and plus the owners come to table to table asking how is your food and feels great getting to know there customers, I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Finally found the best burger place in town! The burgers were perfectly cooked and absolutely delicious.  According to my 10 year old the fries were the best ever and I agree. Amazing onion rings and wings too. Plus, the service was outstanding. Words cannot describe the pot brownie. Heavenly doesn't quite do. We cannot wait to come back!"}
{"text":"I've been to rehab burger therapy several times and enjoyed it. I've even recommended people go there. It isn't the best burger in town but it's okay.

We had family plans to go last night and made a reservation a week in advance because there were going to be 8+ of us and I know how busy it would be on a Saturday.

When we arrived at the time of our reservation, we were told we hadn't made a reservation. When my mother persisted that we had made a reservation a week in advance she was yelled at the night manager and told that they only had one reservation that night and that it was filled. 

... He was extremely aggressive, condescending and frankly ridiculously rude... he didn't even take the time to actually check the reservations... 

... when he did, he discovered that we actually did have a reservation and came out trying to apologize for the wait... offering no explanation. 

Turns out they had given our reservation out to another group and when he (night manager) found out about it, he yelled at the waitress who had made the mistake. 

Listen, mistakes are made... that's easy to forgive. 

... But there is NO excuse for the way we were treated and particularly the way my mother was treated my the manager. 

They did hustle to accommodate us and gave us free appetizers as an apology for the wait... unfortunately the damage was done.

I'll now actively not recommend burger rehab therapy and certainly won't go back."}
{"text":"I have yet to find a better burger! They're delicious and you have to try the spicy mac and cheese!! I'm from out of state and every time I come into town I have to stop here. We were recommended it by some locals and were not disappointed! Definitely worth stopping by!"}
{"text":"By far my favorite local eatery! I love the food, it's delicious!! I've tried everything there and life be it all! I recommend it to everyone."}
{"text":"Just awesome! We started with the pig wings which were just the best! I had the poblano burger, which I subbed for chicken. It was so tasty and spicy, I loved it. My bf had the pescado sandwich. I took a bite and I could actually smell and taste the beer. It was so good! Lo was our waitress and she was awesome! We will be back very soon!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Based on the yelp reviews, I had to check this place out during spring training.  Place looked like an awesome joint to have a burger and hang out. I ended up ordering the bacon cheeseburger on a brioche bun with jamaican corn. Definitely one of my top 5 burgers I ever had, the only regret is that I ordred a small patty instead of a large. (I felt that the bread to meat ratio was a little off.)  My friend ordered a swiss and mushroom burger on a pretzel bun.  The pretzel bun isn't really my thing, but tasted delicious otherwise. Would and will definitely come back here if I'm in town!!"}
{"text":"I love coming to this place. They always have reggae playing which I enjoy. The servings of food will never disappoint. I think your getting a huge bang for your buck as the quality is there, huge serving, and happy during the day makes it even better."}
{"text":"One of the better burgers I've had. The unique burgers they create keep the basic burger relevant. I had the pb&j burger and enjoyed every bit. I will definitely be back to try another interesting combination!"}
{"text":"Great burger! 

We passed through Arizona on our road trip and this is one of the more popular place and I can see why. We got the 10 Oz. Burger and I barely finished it. You can get the 5 Oz if you want, but you might as well go big or go home! Well... Actually I can imagine the 5 Oz being just fine, since you do get a side with it. 

I got the hangover burger and the pepper was grilled, the egg wasn't oozy, the meat was juicy (medium), it was a good burger. I would say it's more on the pricey side, but it's worth it!"}
{"text":"Stopped in to eat dinner at Rehab Burger while visiting my sisters fiancé with my family. It was amazing! The atmosphere is very cool- causal and fun, and the outside seating would be prime if we came during the day. 

The hostess was very friendly and our waitress was so nice. She was very knowledgeable about the menu and even helped with suggestions when we weren't sure what to try. She checked on us numerous times throughout our meal to make sure we were doing ok and to make sure we didn't need anything. 

The unique variety they have for burgers is awesome. They have mac and cheese, PB&J... you name it they have it. The PB&J burger is amazing. You would think it would be a little strange but it's awesome and has a great taste to it. 

We ordered chips and salsa to start and the chips were very fresh and crispy. The salsa was great but it had a little bite to it. I'm a plain jane so I ordered a cheese burger but it was absolutely delicious! My sister got the mac  and cheese burger and it was great. 

Overall great restaurant, cool and causal atmosphere, friendly staff and great customer service. Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"AWESOME - JUST AWESOME!! One of the best gourmet burgers I've ever had. Great service. Now.... The wings could be the best in Phoenix. We will definitely be back when visiting next time."}
{"text":"Excellent burgers that are very unique for the menu. Such a \"Chill\" atmosphere with plenty of bar tables and decent size bar. Perfect place to start and end your happy hour. Andrea is an excellent server and you can tell everyone helps out with the guests. The food is made exactly as I expected and asked the first time!"}
{"text":"What a cool hamburger joint. We found Rehab Burger when we were leaving dinner at nearby restaurant. We could smell the food coming from Rehab and knew we had to check it out. We were not disappointed. They have so many way to make a great burger, greater...  I had the Porkster Burger. Very tasty pulled pork and a great hamburger, it was awesome. We shared the Rehab size, 10 oz patty, with Sweet potato Tots and side of fries. All were really good. Beer selection is, ok. Would have liked to see more micro brews on tap. We'll be back on a game day."}
{"text":"I've went to Rehab Burger twice and both times had absolutely AMAZING food!!  The first time we went the bartender was so nice he made the experience really fun while we sat there and ate.  The second time I went was last Wednesday for lunch and the young girl waitress with the long brown hair had the worst attitude, she was very snyde & not very helpful at all... which is too bad because I brought my friend who had never been before and he got a bad impression of the atmosphere.

Hangover Burger - My favorite!!  Love a fried egg on a juicy burger.

Chili Burger - Also delicious but not as good as the Hangover in my opinion.

Definitely check it out but don't sit in the snotty girl's section if you want to enjoy your experience!!"}
{"text":"So everyone in Scottsdale raves about this place, and when we by chance wandered past it, we had to stop and see what all the excitement was about. 

First of all, this place feels like a bar more than a restaurant - just some to keep in mind if you're bringing the young kids.  It's not an obnoxious bar though, but possibly not a place for babies if it's a busy weekend. 

Peanut butter and jelly bacon burger on a pretzel bun?  This is the standing \"burger of the year?\"  Definitely not something on the menu in my hometown.  Ordered the petite size with tater tots. 

The food arrived quickly, after less than 15 minutes. Taste and quality were good, but perhaps less explosive than what I expected after hearing so much raving about this place. Fortunately it wasn't overly greasy, which is surprising considering it was covered in bacon. It's def not on my normal healthy diet, but this was a special weekend for friends so what the heck.  

My verdict was that it was pretty good, and I can check it off the list - but don't need to go out of my way to return here again, and it's still simply a bar that sells burgers and has friendly service."}
{"text":"The table was too tall for us tiny gals but the burger.. wow! Yum. PB&J won my heart. The decor had a very relaxing and casual atmosphere, kinda sporty. The staff was very friendly, and prompt. It was a very clean place, and it felt good having some water (like 10 glasses) of it on a hot day while waiting for my coke, and my wifes beer. The selection of burgers was nice and large, and while we shared the PB&J, others jumped out at us too. We will definiately be back now that we live in the area!"}
{"text":"Had high expectations after all the reviews and wasn't disappointed .  The mac n cheese burger is to die fir, better than PBJ one, which was amazing.  Fun and great food."}
{"text":"This is our current favorite burger place and has held that title for us these past few years.  That's saying a lot, since we eat burgers in Nashville, Dallas, California and wherever else we may end up.  I could classify my husband as a burger connoisseur.  Burgers are one of his four food groups.

This Reggae playing, Island Beach themed establishment is one busy place.  Get there early if you have a preference for inside or patio seating.  The wait for the food is always worth it!

Rehab has a large selection to choose from and they don't only offer Burgers, which they serve just about anyway one could dream up, (i.e. PBJ Burger, the Farmer, the Porker), they have salads, sandwiches and awesome service by an excellent, humorous, and attentive wait staff.  

I usually build my own burger, choosing the Brioche Bun, which is always fresh and not in any way a bland old white burger bun.  One may also opt for a Wheat or Pretzel Bun, which I want to try every time, but I can't seem to refuse the yummy Brioche.  My husband ordered an 'un-hinge your jaw' humongo burger which he thoroughly enjoyed.  To name a couple of their quite delightful sides:  sweet potato tots and deep fried Cajan and Butter seasoned fresh Corn on the Cob.  This isn't an ordinary nor a boring burger place. 

It's a good thing Rehab is 4 states away from us!  This is the kind of restaurant where most
everyone leaves wishing they hadn't eaten SO much.  Good is not the proper adjective to describe this 5 Star Burger Bar."}
{"text":"We've been going here for years, it's the best burger I've ever had. My husband, whose favorite food is burgers, agrees. I get the 5oz Jalapeno Popper burger (best one!) with pretzel bun and either fries or onion rings. Onion rings are great with the spicy pineapple bbq sauce. It's not good for you but man is it tasty!"}
{"text":"I arrived on Thursday night it was not busy which surprised me.  They have happy hour all night on Thursdays.  I ordered a spicy Mac burger and it was huge and very good!   You have a variety of sides and dipping sauces.  I chose the sweet potato tots and could not pick a sauce so the bartender brought me his four favorite.  They were all good!   The staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"Great place and great food! Loved it! Burgers are amazing! The service is good. Just be aware the place is small. So if someone has a party reservation of at least 15, it can take up the whole restaurant. We had a party of 6 but Rehab was waiting on a bday party so we had to sit at the bar. I think they shouldn't offer huge party reservations on Saturday evenings but  it happens."}
{"text":"The service was a little slow at first. I wasn't impressed with the burger. I was disappointed we drove 40 mins when we have better burgers closer to home. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"We were looking for somewhere new to try so we came to Rehab Burger Therapy last night. It was Saturday about 7. We were welcomed and got seated right away. It took about 10 minutes for anyone to come over to our table to ask about drinks or anything. We ordered a chili burger, build your own burger and a hot dog. The chili was very plain with lots of tomatoes. I'd have to say this is the first restaurant where my kids didn't devour the French fries. They have an odd seasoning salt of them. 
The food was okay. I thought the prices were reasonable. The service could have been better. Our server was super nice. Overall super slow. We may try again, not sure. Definitely worth at least trying once. 

The easiest way to find is to access 6th street off of Mill Ave.  They are next to the parking garage."}
{"text":"Last time I was here I took my daughter and I made a big mistake. I should have shared my burger with her, we had a lot of wasted food because we don't eat a ton of food. What we did have was really great, the burgers were cooked great, the fries were really great...it's hard to mess up fries but it happens...

It was the middle of the day and it was slow which is the way I like it. We were in and out quickly, the service was friendly and the place has a great eclectic atmosphere. Check it out."}
{"text":"This place has such a chill vibe!! Always greeted warmly and gave great service. Burgers are giant of course, and plated very pretty - awesome photo op! Tasty tasty too!! Been several times and always can only eat half.. so if you can agree on a burger with someone, best to go splitskies. If you follow then on Facebook, you get the inside intel on the special weekend burger creation they always have- stay tuned, there's some pretty cool stuff! Both fries and sweet potato tater tots are fantastic, you won't go wrong with either! Keep up the great work, Rehab!!"}
{"text":"Excellent burgers. Quality beef makes a difference! We split the 10 oz for lunch and it was PLENTY!  Sweet potato tater tots wierd and not very tasty. Cannot recommend those.

Nice selection of beers. Liked special offerings to dress burgers.
Great location right before a game at Scottsdale Stadium. EZ walk. 

Service good. Young crowd. Burgers took a little while, but worth the wait."}
{"text":"Being raised within New Mexico and in contact with hatch chili, the Hatch Burger was surprisingly spicy! It was good but it would have been much better with some lettuce tomato and onion, which is offered in the menu. 

I did notice a woman order a mac and cheese burger, which is why I will be going back to try such an intriguing burger. Do not order your burger with water. A root beer or a beer would definitely leave you feeling full and satisfied."}
{"text":"This place rock super hard . Try out the PB&J burger sandwich , it will blow your mind. They have a variety of burgers, so come in here and blow your burger mind away."}
{"text":"Fun place with tasty burgers!  We were here two years ago and happy to stop again. Twenty minute wait went quickly people watching outside. 
My husband's plain ole burger was cooked just how he likes it...rare. My poblano burger, medium well, had some kick to it!  Friend's Swiss and his wife's ghost were a bit off in how  done they were cooked. (Her medium well was pink.) Three giant onion rings were tasty as were the fries. Fries were a bit on the cool side. 
Drinks were refreshing.  Mine had some coconut and pineapple juice in it...mmmm. 
Great service and a friendly atmosphere made for a great place to stop. Free parking next door is a bonus in the public lot."}
{"text":"The burger here did not disappoint. Hubby and I were in the area and have wanted to visit this restaurant for awhile now so we were pretty excited. The restaurant was not very busy to our surprise. We decided to share the ghost burger with fries. The plate was definitely enough for two because the burger itself was pretty big. Our server was also pretty friendly. Very happy we tried it. I definitely recommend if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere. Excellent food. Good service. Thanks waitress Cassidy!! Definitely would suggest to a friend or even a stranger!!!!"}
{"text":"This seems like a place to go if you want to feel like a hipster.  Turns out, I have no desire to be a hipster.  The food was only subpar and the service matched. The only way I'd go back was if it were on a weeknight so hopefully both my food and myself would get more attention. Not worth the half hour Friday night wait."}
{"text":"Here's the deal: I only went for happy hour and thoroughly enjoyed my Mai Tai. The menu had many selections and a wide variety of burgers. My friend ordered the Hangover Burger and it looked amazing. 

The chips & salsa/guac were not my favorite but overall I loved the fun, vibrant west coast ambiance. It's a great place of your looking for something casual, laid back and satisfying."}
{"text":"Pretty cool place and good burgers. I liked it because it's different from the rest of Scottsdale. Staff was friendly, tables and silverware were clean and the whole vibe was casual and inviting. Our burgers were huge and tasty. There are many varieties on the menu. It is also reasonably priced. There was nothing negative about it and that's why I gave it 5 stars. I love these little places like this one. Local, small, inviting, casual and amazing food."}
{"text":"Let's get this right off the bat, Rehab serves up one of the best burgers in AZ. The lean/fat ratio, seasoning, and cook on the burger patty is always on fleek. Your ability to choose what delicious bun is unique. Burger toppings are high quality and unrivaled. On this particular visit I ordered the PB&J Bacon Burger, and was a bit surprised how well the flavors blended together. I also had a bite of my dining partner's Hangover Burger which was also delightful. 

That being said, their sides are AWFUL. French fries - so over cooked and bad that I almost broke my sobriety. Sweet potato tots - so soggy and bland that no treatment could help them. Onion rings - enough grease to fill a few shot glasses.

The service was awesome and not your typical Scottsdale vibe. Expect a 5 star burger and service but stay away from the other menu items."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place.  Food is always consistently fabulous and service is great tool"}
{"text":"I've come to this location over a dozen times. It truthfully depends on where you sit I've noticed on how well or how terrible your service is. I've had one gentleman that is amazing every time I've gotten him. Every other waiter has been ok to horrible. The food however? Amazing. This is my second worst experience I've had at this location. Today I came in, after waiting over 10 minutes for someone to ask for our order, we asked a random waitress & inquired about the weekend special burger. The waitress had no idea there was even a special burger today. The worst part was when she asked who our original waiter was, she didn't know, turns around & simply blurts out \"what do you want?\" I'm not a waiter or waitress but the tone of voice which this was said in, atrocious to say the least. I drive all the way from Laveen to come eat here the times I do. This may very well be my last. Even with the food being as amazing as it is."}
{"text":"The burger was outstanding. I had the pb n j burger. I would of never thought in a million years that I would order that kinda of burger. But it was awesome. It also had bacon and sirracha on it. It was just a little heat to go with the sweet. This place was awesome the wait was a little long for 5 of us, but well worth it."}
{"text":"Came here during the Tempe Arts Festival and lucky for us because they are not right on Mill Ave. we got a patio seat for 4 right away.  I am always looking for a great HH place for my work group as I work down the way and was excited to try the Rehab.  The burgers were excellent/delicious/juicy/pretzel bread bun/awesome!!!  The service was over the top compared to the previous establishment just a few doors down.  We tried the green chili burger and it was delicious.  I was very impress with everything and the price for a 1/2 pound burger is around 10 bucks, which you can split with someone easily, it's more than enough.  Very happy with everything and I will be back."}
{"text":"This is my 3rd time at Rehab in 1 week. The ambience, staff, food & location all add up to AMAZING!!!

I could go on & on about this place, but I will try to sum it up succinctly:
If you want a comfy environment, people to interact with that also serve food/drinks, sports on the big screen, a central location, full satisfied stomach/liver...this is your place. Locals & tourists align perfectly. Come here. You'll be back.

Big shout out to CW, Kate, Stefi, Robin & the rest of the team."}
{"text":"Great burger spot. Unfortunately I was there too meet family & friends for drinks. The girls had ordered a burger with pb & j & siracha?  I love burgers. I couldn't do it altogether tho. Love siracha. On the burger:awesome. Pb & j? Not on my juicy burger please. Separately it was fantastic. Sweet potato tots or was it fries? Ohmy!  I can't remember. Did I mention I was here for drinks?  In all, I would come back again. The menu looked delicious. Tip: public parking lot was just around the corner."}
{"text":"Let me be clear. Best. Hamburgers. Ever. Period.
Go try them and see if i'm lying. I think you can still cook a better burger at home if you are serious but let's be realistic in today's times. Amazing awesome unbelievable. Believe it. Go there."}
{"text":"This place is is the best! I had a veggie portobello mushroom burger, vegan style (I'm not vegan, but try to eat more plants). My server brought out 4 vegan sauces, but I found I didn't need to add sauce, as the mushroom had a nice marinade. The burger was packed with fresh veggies. It was served with a side of sweet potato tots. The portion was so huge, that I'd recommend sharing dinner so you can share a milkshake for dessert. Mmm."}
{"text":"Excellent combos and beef. The brioche bun is the only way to go! Service is great and the place is nicely decorated with cool music. Patio is nice. Sweet potato tots are great alternative to fries."}
{"text":"I love the crazy burgers you can get here.  We asked the waiter for recommendations and he said that as crazy as it sounds the PB&J bacon burger is a top seller.  I went for it and it was good.  I would like to try it again.  The burgers are very large and filling and the service is good.  I have tried 3 other weird burgers here and they have all been great."}
{"text":"Definitely lived up to the crazy burger photos that they post to Facebook. My burger was great and the sweet potato side was great. Certainly an unnecessary quantity of food for lunch but who cares."}
{"text":"Not Bad, not great.  Typical trendy burger place.  It was a lot of food, I'll give them that.  Our server was a standard Scottsdale waitress with little patience and crappy customer service.  I could take or leave this place."}
{"text":"Need a good quick dinner and did not want to pay exuberant prices.  This burger joint filled the spot.  Lots of varieties on a classic burger.  Awesome fries and great drinks.  It was super busy when I was here but I sat rather quickly at the bar and made some new acquaintances.  I had a very delicious burger.  I do not recommend the sweet tater tots...too sweet, not sure how that happened since I love sweet potato fries.  I will likely be back next time I am in the area."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite burger place. I had the PBJ and Bacon Burger and it was absolutely the best burger I had in such a long time. The fries were really good as well. We went during happy hour so we had a mimosa for $5 (regular $7) and that was pretty decent as well. The service was nice, not too loud, and just an overall really great experience. Can't wait to go again!"}
{"text":"My family loved this place!  Cade was an excellent waiter, and we had a great time.  The dessert was fabulous, and the burgers were awesome."}
{"text":"Must have the pb&j burger it sounds odd but so incredibly good! The tots are yummy as well!"}
{"text":"Rehab is the best burger bar in Scottsdale.  Service is great, and the food always comes out perfect.  The only doeskin is the wait.  Typically it runs 10-20 minutes to get a seat.  Off-hours, tables are always available."}
{"text":"If you want a quiet place to eat, with minimalist  decor, and inexpensive burgers, go to McDonald's. If you want a hoppin' joint, funky and eclectic atmosphere, fun crowd, great service, with ginormous burgers that earn the title Best Of AZ, go to Rehab. Great flavor to the burgers and condiments, heck even the fries were delicious! Decent selection of beer. Not as much as some other local places, but you came here for the burger anyway. They also have non beef and vegetarian options for their burgers. It's not a super cheap place, but it's not outrageous, and you get MORE than your money's worth. 
Added bonus, there were two Pokéstops within range of our table, so the kids were extra happy!"}
{"text":"Rian the bartender ROCKS, \"Serious Mike\" seems cool too! My husband and I are new to the area and this was our first time here. Had a few drinks at the bar and onion rings, YUM!! will be back for sure. Thanks Rian and \"Serious Mike\" for a fun time!!!"}
{"text":"Great, burgers, great waitress and great beer! The bacon burger was decent along with he chicken wings, the cute waitress was nice and the Kilt Lifter beer really hit the spot!!!"}
{"text":"Super good food. Great service. They even made me a jalapeño vodka margarita. Delicious burgers."}
{"text":"Omg this place was awesome!!! Their poblano burger and sweet potatoes tator tots were delicious!  Service was great and the waitress Selena was very personable and informative!  We are from California and will definitely recommend this to our friends that will come and visit!!"}
{"text":"As far as California surf town joints go, I am a fan!

This location creates the complete surf town ambiance with its beach cruisers, surf boards, and flat panels with aquariums and beach scenes.

You can expect to find bar food here such as chicken wings and chili cheese fries.  And of course there are the burgers.  You can choose from about a dozen burgers, as well as the ability to build your own.  You also have the option of a \"rehab\" and \"relapse\" size.  The smaller of the two, happens to be the perfect size and portion.

Rehab offers a variety of unique dipping sauces, such as their pineapple aoli, chipotle ranch, habanero ketchup, sweet habanero, and their stone ground mustard.  The pineapple aoli is perfect with the sweet potato tots, the mustard outstanding with the burgers because it has a very mellow sweet and tart flavor.

I ordered my burger medium rare, and it was cooked to perfection.

Despite the restaurant being quite busy, food and drink orders were delivered very quickly.  All food tasted fresh and made to order, and temperatures of the cooked foods were perfect.

There were other options on the menu such as sandwiches and pasta, even smaller portions for kiddos - but this definitely is a burger joint.  With the average burger costing $7.50 for a small and $10.50 for a larger version, the prices are very competitive with other burger joints.

This place can become your local hangout with weekly specials such as thirsty Thursdays where domestic pints are $2 and premiums are $3 as well as $4 drink specials and a dollar off on appetizers.

Furthermore, Happy Hour is 7 days week, until 6p.  You don't get huge savings on the appetizers, but you can definitely drink on a budget here."}
{"text":"Started out with the onion rings with various sauces  delicious! I was in heaven with the ghost cheese burger and the spicy Mac and cheese, it had fried red onions and some amazing sauce. Yum! Bring your appetite the burgers are Colossal.There was a 25 minute wait but me,my man, and our son ate every last morsel! Highly recommended"}
{"text":"My husband and I recently moved to the area and stopped by this place on Friday night after reading Yelp reviews. We absolutely loved it! The atmosphere was laid back and had a great vibe. In addition to having an incredible burger menu, they have a great bar/beer selection. I had the jalapeño popper burger and my husband had the hangover burger. We loved every bite and cannot wait to return!!!"}
{"text":"We started the meal with onion rings which were perfectly crispy on the outside with moist non-stringy onions inside.  I then ordered the veggie burger, being from CA I'm a sucker for a tasty, in-house made veggie burger.  It wasn't the best I've ever had since it had a two bean base without veggies but I enjoyed ever last bite of it on a pretzel bun.  If I had anymore room in my stomach I would have definitely gone for the \"pot\" brownie."}
{"text":"After researching burgers spot, I found this place. One of the best burger joints in town and they did not disappoint! I ordered a bacon cheeseburger and it came with fries. The burger was delicious. The problem came with the service. I watched the gal take my check and money and run back to the cash register. Then I watch her chop it up with staff and just kid of stand around. So I had to go and get her to get my change. She goes, oh yeah your change. I was thinking, how can you forget that. Then she asked her coworker to give her some change  for my bill and hands me 8 bucks no receipt. I then ask for a receipt. As I was walking out, I looked at the receipt and it showed total charge, $9.45. I gave her a twenty and got 8 bucks back! I go back and say how did you short change me so much? So, then she hands me ten dollars...and I look at her like, where's the other 45 cents? She and her coworker told me that they don't keep or give our CHANGE! I said, well your not keeping it! Then she hands me a whole dollar and I look at her like, Are you serious? I hand her back the dollar and told her to keep it. I then called and complained to management which said, shes been here for a long time and we haven't had any problems with her service. Really?? I'm scared to go back for fear of my food being harmed...#Rehabbing from being pissed right now!"}
{"text":"Rehab Burger Therapy is an example of how sometimes 2 rights can make a....not so right. Burgers? Yes! Mac and Cheese? Would doesn't love it! Jalapeno poppers? Delicious! But everything together? It's just not a burger to me, especially if you have to eat it with a knife and fork. Isn't holding in your hands a delicious piece of fresh, ground cow between buttery, fat buns half the beauty of a burger?

I had the Spicy Mac-N-Cheese burger, and our table also ordered Ghost burger and the special burger, the Loco Moco. My burger had mac n cheese spilled everywhere, and it felt like eating a decent burger with a side of mac and cheese. The Loco Moco burger had rice spilling every where...and rice in a burger? Not sure if they even thought about the logistics of it. The burger itself was mediocre....if you're a high end burger joint, you should have a very excellent burger patty as a base. 

Service was ok, I think staff could use a bit of training on at least their specials (I overheard at least 2 servers not know what the daily special was). It is, however, very conveniently located in walkable distance from the Giants Scottsdale Stadium, and a nice post-game restaurant to head to. In the end the food felt like messy combinations of anything they can think of putting on a burger. Fun place, but far from being the best burger I've ever had (Fergburger takes the crown on that, and all burger joints need to take note), and not really a 4.5 rank in my book."}
{"text":"Holy crap, this place is re-DONK.

We came by here starving and damaged after Tough Mudder the other weekend. Our waitress (bless her heart) was the sweetest lady, and even went out of her way to cut an aloe vera branch from the plant outside for my friend to tend to his wounds. Seriously, is that excellent service or what??

I tried the know poblano burger (grilled spicy onions, manchego, and roasted poblanos) which was absolutely mindblowing. The burger was cooked perfectly, the flavors were unique and punchy, and I finished the whole damn thing despite being full 1/3 of the way in.

And on that note, if you're debating if you're hungry enough to get the 10oz vs the 5oz....seriously, don't be a pansy, get the 10oz."}
{"text":"Great burgers.
Ordered the frito app and ate the entire thing before I could take a photo!  Well worth it!"}
{"text":"Reminds me of going to one of those places on the boardwalk that has surfer appeal. The burgers are excellent. I had my first ever ghost burger with ghost peppers because I wanted to live dangerously. Full of flavor and sneaks up on you. While I could only eat half my leftovers were just as good the next day. 
The place is small and the wait can get long so get there early"}
{"text":"We love rehab burger and eat here every couple months. The staff is nice, great, cool, on top of their game, and everything else positive you can say about a team of servers and bartenders. The food is out-of-this-world good, especially the side sauces and sweet potato tots. I try to have something different each time we go.

I don't know what else to say other than you'd be doing yourself a disservice if you didn't come here."}
{"text":"Do not hesitate to order the PB&J burger! And our mushroom Swiss burger was perfect too. Service was awesome...can't wait to come back next time I'm in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"I grew up in Scottsdale and when I come to visit I have to come here 2 or 3 times. I love this burger place but don't let the name fool you. The pasta, appetizers and salads are phenomenal. They never disappoint. I highly suggest the calamari and pot brownie if you have room for dessert."}
{"text":"Boom!   A big ol burger, funky flavors, something a little different and great service.   You gotta try this place.   

I've heard about this place that mixed peanut butter and jelly, sriracha sauce on a burger made of choice, and no, it wasn't from someone who was pregnant.    I scoffed, but the look on their face showed they were serious about how much they liked it.   I had to try.    

We rolled in and gave it a try.    The place has atmosphere, which I liked immediately.    The service was johnny on the spot;   friendly, and fast at the end of a work day.  

Our waitress was funny and was spot on.   We liked her immediately.   Then the food came out.  

BP&J Bacon Burger:   its ridiculous.    I like to think I know my way around a kitchen, and am a bit creative bit this thing changed my life.   It was epic.   I didn't even know you could do that, but they did.    It was seriously sloppily delicious.   I'll go back, but next time with a knife,  fork and a giant napkin that won't be big enough to to wipe  the smile off my face. 

The only star I can knock off, is the chef wasn't quite paying attention to the difference between medium rare and well done.   A couple burgers had to go back, and still weren't right.  Don't ask how you want your burger, if you're not going to cook it that way (or the chef doesn't know what the difference is as it pertains to his brain and when to flip the burger). 

You guys almost have it nailed!

Nicely Done Rehab Burger!"}
{"text":"Let me begin this review by asking you this: you remember that kid in \"Daddy Day Care\" that would throw fits and would immediately become docile and mesmerized when someone handed him a dollar? If you don't know what I'm talking about then I'm sorry that you don't have the same love and appreciation for great cinema that I do ;)

If you do remember that kid then this is exactly what happened to me during my first visit. We came here on a whim. Sunday night trying to figure out what to eat, looked up burgers on Yelp. The pictures by Yelpers looked great and this place was offering a Yelp deal. 

When we got there parking was easy, and the place looked neat and clean inside.  We got in with about 40 minutes 'till closing time. The staff was really welcoming and friendly. Ordering was made easier with great suggestions from our server (I took the Hangover with fries while my gf took the Poblano and sweet poToToes

We were set, then waited for our food. About 10 minutes into our wait (maybe less) our server informed us of an issue in the kitchen that would delay our order. She also told us we'd get some key lime pie to compensate for the extra wait. That's good service folks! Our food ended up taking quite a bit. But when it finally arrived we were NOT disappointed. 

The burgers are BIG. Each burger comes in two versions rehab and relapse (10oz vs. 5oz). While I was able to handle the rehab I think I could have been satisfied with the relapse version of this monster. The flavors of the egg, bacon, cheese and chile complemented the savory beef well. The patty was juicy, despite my penchant for well done meat. I also had a taste of the Poblano and thought it was very tasty. The cheese used on this burger stood out for me as I like a sharp cheese.

If you are in the area consider giving this place a try. I know for certain, future rehab sessions are in my immediate future."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The chicken sandwich and burger was delicious. We really liked the vibe and how we were treated. Best place I've been to recently! The only thing I thought they should have is a kids menu but that's it really. I mean the sandwiches were big enough to share with my nephew but overall, great place, awesome workers and location."}
{"text":"They give a LOT of food and their service is great! I think I got the bigger version of the burger and basically was in a food coma half-way through. I chose the sweet po-tot-oes and they were soo good, but again, WAY too much! Their burger was delicious and I will be going back. :)"}
{"text":"Didn't start off so well (they forgot my friend, and my order)...so they compt our meal, which we didn't expect cuz it was no big deal.  Atomosphere is great, burger is great,...will definitly go back, well runned restaurant and friendly."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing! I can't say one bad thing about this place.  The inside decor is very cute, made me feel like I was on vacation. Every menu item that came out of the kitchen looked great. This was my first time here and it will not be my last.  The portion size was big, but thats never anything that bothers me! The pictures speak for themselves!"}
{"text":"I've got to say I am quite disappointed.  I ordered a Hawaiian burger and it was pretty much tasteless. The ham must've been really poor quality because you couldn't even taste it on the burger.. I ordered it cooked medium and it came well done as did the other three burgers at my table.  They did bring us new burgers when we requested it. The waitress was very nice."}
{"text":"This is an perfect place to burger and chill. The Tots rule! The chili, Mac and chz, and hangover burgers were very very good. The ambiance is also what makes the place. This place is on the small side so the wait my be long. The larger burger is the way to go, the smaller one has a tendency to get lost."}
{"text":"PBJ burger is the main attraction here. And sweet potato tater tots.

Not sure if they invented it first, Slater's 50/50 chain in LA, or whoever, but they do their PBJ burger right and it's only $11 for a small or so (plenty big with a side of fries/tots) or $13 for a big on avg for all their burgers.

Lots of TV's, outdoor seating, good drinks at the bar. If you're in Old Town definitely a burger and drinks spot to watch sports too. Service also excellent."}
{"text":"This is one of the best burger places I've been. Every time we are in Scottsdale we come here for burgers.  Believe it or not the peanut butter and jelly with bacon burger is to die for. It is the best tasting burger. I make it at home too but it's not the same as Rehab burger. Highly recommend trying it you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Visited this place in Scottsdale recently and it was so good! They were packed even at 4pm on a Sunday. They have some really unique menu items (I had the peanut butter, jelly & bacon burger), delicious!! They need to bring some locations to Dallas/Ff Worth!"}
{"text":"Met a friend there early evening. The margarita I had was  great, but a bit sweet. Similar to the Belini at Oregano's.  Great veggie burger. Got part of my order wrong but i didn't mention that as it was only the bread and I didn't care. Was very warm and dark inside. Temperature outside was 110 so the AC might have been strained. Hard to find home made veggie burgers so for that reason I would go back if i were in the area. Server was great and did not hover. Fun place to go in cooler weather to sit on patio. We got there early so there was no wait, but by the time we left, the line was out the door. Not sure it would be worth the wait but it was definitely good enough to try again."}
{"text":"OH MY GOD!  By far the yummiest burer i have had in a long time!  What a great menu!  The sweet poTOTo tots were amazing with the pineapple dipping sauce.  Not too sweet but a perfect combo with these perfectly sized crunchy tots!

Cold beer, awesome drinks and their happy hour rocks! EVERYTHING here is amazing! Get the pretzel bun!!!!!!!!!

Will definitely be going back and i can't wait!"}
{"text":"This place rocks. Great food. Great owners. Great prices. No bullshit.    

I have been here a few times.  It looks like San Diego or a place you would come in on right off the beach.  

The owners are always there and they seem to love what they have created.

They have clams on the menu which I have yet to get to, but so far I have had variations of their Turkey Burger and have yet to be disappointed.

The staff is real friendly, love to talk and have a good time.  They also care about making sure you are being taken care of.

I wish more places in Olde Town had the quality of people, food, and service this place does."}
{"text":"Great burgers, service and vibe...  We both received perfectly charred medium-rare burgers with crispy onion rings.  Keep up the good work, Rehab.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"So I went to Rehab Burger Therapy... I really liked the name and the burgers looked DELICIOUS on other yelpers photos.
My hotel is close by and it was walking distance, but for some reason I didn't know where anything was because it was so dark out in Old Town. I'm from Houston, and we like a lot of light. 
Anyway I walked in and loved the decor.. It kinda gave me that fun playhouse surfer type beachy feel. (sometimes when I explain stuff it sounds weird, but you'll get it when you see it)

I sat at the bar and read the menu, I decided to order the Bacon Bleu on a Pretzel bun togo. 
It took like maybe 10 minutes. 

When I got back to my hotel. the burger was okay... It was my fault for not asking for lettuce and tomato, but the burger was okay... Not the best but not the worst either. I'll go back again to try a different burger, and give you guys feedback on it!!

I also wish hey had given me napkins for my togo order though.. :-(

Sidebar: there was this girl that worked there, she sounded like and kinda looked a little like Lindsay Lohan... (I'm random I know)."}
{"text":"Well... I've been here a few times and have to write a review.  This place is amazing.  Somehow it seems to get better every time I go.  First couple times I just had like a Hang Over Burger and it was darn good and a little unique with the chilis.  Then I had a BBQ Burger.  Hard competition because ya know, everyone has one on their menu, but I was impressed with their own BBQ and of course, the pretzel bun.  Then I tried the PB&J Burger on a whim.  OMG.  Fricken Amazing.  I mean like amazing enough that I will crave it and have to go for it.  All their sides and tots are great and then I tried the Jamaican corn.  Also amazing and totally unique.  So good I went again last night and totally went PB&J w/ corn.  I had to go back though because I was in NYC and someone who travels to Scottsdale says, oh have you heard of Rehab...  YEAH I HAVE.  Tells me to try the Medium/Gold chicken wings.  So that happened.  Cooked perfectly, sauce was spicy and mustardy and delicious.  Off the charts.  Someone else got the pig wings where were also great.  I'm thinking they ought to put that medium/gold sauce on some pig wings or pulled pork too, it would be great.  At this point, it's going to be hard for me to be in the area and go somewhere else.  Also, I should add that every time I've been the crowd has been good and the service is always great and the people are very friendly."}
{"text":"It was really really good! Food was yummy and service was excellent. K was our bartender and server and she was on it.  Tried the hangover burger and it was out of my comfort zone but really good. Pretzel bun was good but I would do a regular bun next time. Wings were our starter and they were good with the homemade Wing sauce (bomb) It was a fun place to try !"}
{"text":"Stopped by on a Saturday afternoon while waiting for an oil change. Just wanted a good burger, and was definitely pleasantly surprised! I got the Turkey Burger, which was phenomenal, and not dry at all for a turkey burger, and my boyfriend got the Bacon & Blue. Both were amazing! P.S Get the sweet tots! Conner, our server, was speedy and personable! Definitely a good vibe if you're looking for a chill island-type burger joint."}
{"text":"Ok... This may be my second review for this place, but all I can say is AMAZING!!!  The food, the atmosphere, and Kay... Was amazing!!!  She could sell ice to an Eskimo. 

I had the Elvis burger.... Bananas, peanut butter, chocolate on a bacon hamburger.  It was like cocaine & whiskey on the toilet... To die for!!!!

Thank you Kay for an amazing time at Rehab Burger!"}
{"text":"Wow!! PB&J Burger and Mac & Cheese Burger over the top!! Most importantly they killed it on the service. Come hungry my friends!!"}
{"text":"My favorite Burger Joint in all of Arizona! Sweet potato tots are always on point and service is constantly 5.  Burgers are always cooked as ordered, never any complaints!"}
{"text":"I understand why this place has such a high rating. When we first walked up to the restaurant I was a little nervous. We were seated immediately and our server greeted us shortly after that. Our server was amazing, super attentive, kind and funny. He offered suggestions and recommendations for what was good.

My mom and I both started off with corona-ritas. They were delicious. You can tell they were not made with a mix, but fresh limes and lots of tequila. Very good choice and worth the price. 

With each burger you get to pick a different kind of roll and either French fries or sweet potato tots. Taking our servers suggestions, I got the PBJ & bacon burger on a pretzel bun with French fries. My burger was amazing. Don't be afraid to try this burger. I made my whole family try it and it was the best burger at the table.

My sister ordered the bacon burger, my dad ordered the BBQ burger, and my mom ordered the patty melt. Everyone enjoyed their burgers and how they were cooked, but the PBJ &a bacon burger was still the best. 

Overall food is delicious and the prices were reasonable! Definitely give this place a chance!"}
{"text":"pig wings - gots some kick to it.
chile verde con pollo - good.
hatch chile burger - good.
sweet poTOToes - good, on the sweet side.
the atmosphere was really nice."}
{"text":"Arrived with a friend at 4 pm. Perfect, not busy seated on patio, greeted by waiter.  Ordered the onion rings as appetizer and they were good. Burgers next. I ordered mine rare, it came medium well. When you have a burger joint, I am the only customer, you charge $10 for a burger and you can't get it right, three stars is my max."}
{"text":"They kill it, best burgers in old town. Great menu, great staff. Pb&j is a must for first timers or people out of town"}
{"text":"My husband and I ordered two different burgers to share. The PB&J burger was delicious! I held the siracha on the side because I'm not a fan but once I tried a little on my burger I wish I would have left it on, it intensified the flavors. We also got the Hawaiian burger but it was really dry.  If they add some sort of Hawaiian BBQ or other sauce it would help the flavor and dryness! Overall, pleased with service and experience."}
{"text":"This place was super fun. The burger was larger than my face but I still enjoyed it. They have an outdoor patio which looked lovely but I ate inside. They have a great variety of condiments, an essential for a great dining experience in my opinion. Our server was so nice."}
{"text":"Super yummy food and fantastic staff (we like Mike!) Their dipping sauces are bomb, especially the wasabi mayo. Outdoor dining has heaters, seemed to be a fun spot for a group although I was there on a date. Great prices on beers!"}
{"text":"After months of waiting to try this famous pb and j burger....I was in the area and gave it a go.

I was working, so I ordered pickup. I got sweet potato fries instead of regular...and they were the ish! Customer service was excellent as well. High energetic place which it seemed, the little time I was inside of course. 

I told them that it was my first time, so they put all of their sauces in my bag to try as well. They were all great. Scottsdale was a little out the way for me, but I will definitely be making my way up their again for this burger. They won me over, easily."}
{"text":"If you like thick beef patties, then maybe you'd like this place. I asked for well done for my beef patty, not burn it so that it's bitter and nasty. The chocolate shake tastes like it was made from Hershey's chocolate syrup and low quality shake base (disgusting). I prefer sweet potato fries over sweet potato tots. The tots taste like regular potatoes to me. We got the BBQ pork wings and some of it was good, some were dry. It was also way to barbecue-ee for my taste. The place was way too loud."}
{"text":"The service was TERRIBLE!! Our servers name was Ben and he was awful! He basically ignored us the entire time we were there. All he did was set our food down and walk away. The food looks good in pictures and even in person but the taste is just ok... My husband got the Bosa burger (Bosa doughnuts as buns) the bottom doughnut was literally sitting in liquid when it arrived and as my husband picked it up it disintegrated in his hands. I got the burger with pulled pork on top and it was swimming in spicy bbq sauce which, if you like spicy bbq sauce probably would have been really good however, I don't like spicy food and it said nothing about it being spicy on the menu. If it did I wouldn't have ordered it. As the manager walked by and asked how everything was I explained that I didn't really like spicy food and was unable to really eat any of the burger she said \"Aw, I feel bad\" and walked away. So we paid $14 for 2 bites of a burger. I live in north Phoenix and would never drive all the way back to this place. It's not worth the time out of my day."}
{"text":"A good hamburger is one of my favorite meals.  Throw in some good sides and done!!  I ordered the Know Poblano burger and my wife ordered a basic salad with chicken.  Also got sweet potato tots and french fries to go with it.  The burger was amazing-perfectly cooked and the toppings did not outweigh the taste of the meat.  And the tots were on another level.  No complaints whatsoever about Rehab Burger."}
{"text":"Wow, had the PB&J Bacon Burger...and I would have never ordered it had it not been for what I saw in the other YELP reviews....it was amazing.   The combination of PB&J with Sriracha and bacon is out of this world.   Very messy but worth it (not first date food.)    My husband had the Porkster Burger and he also gave it a thumbs up.

Do not miss Rehab if you are in downtown!"}
{"text":"Not to be a douche, but meh. I wanted to love this place, but the fries were soggy, that was my first bite. Second bite was a cloyingly sweet tot. Not my thing.

Burger was huge. I'll say that. A Rehab, got three meals out of it. Fair is fair. But unremarkable taste.

Service was slow, if vaguely friendly. Again, not terrible, but a $14 burger? Umami it wasn't."}
{"text":"Very disappointed this visit. We drove an hour to get here today and they supposedly ran out of the father's day special  burger at 11am.. on father's day. Also out of gluten free buns as well. Been coming here for years but this was a disappointing visit. Ironic cause they open at 11am on Sundays and our server said they ran out of this burger at 11am... then she laughed and said \"great father's day marketing on our part\". The greasewood burger.. how can you \"run out\"? Has all the same ingredients as the other burgers you offer. Poor planning. One of us in our party is gluten tolerant and when a place who specializes in burgers with buns runs out of gluten free buns and only was open for 4 hours..? Management is going down hill here. I counted 3 parties of 2 walk in and leave cause the wait was \"25-30\" minutes yet there were open table tops. Time to find a new burger place. 

Edit: went once more, same terrible service. Went from a 2 star to a 1 star."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers I have ever had. My fav burger is in Pittsburgh. But most def the best burger in phoenix. I love the sweet potato tots. They give you so much food. I love the breakfast burger."}
{"text":"I love the burgers here. Always make my burger right, medium well. Great fun atmosphere. sevice is never lacking. the servers are attentive and quick. they are always smiling. manager always checks on each table. restaurant is clean as well as the bathrooms. easy to find parking. overall excellent experience every single time."}
{"text":"First of all, service was awesome! I was so pleased with our waitress, she knew it was our first time here and gave us suggestions and was patient with us. She gave us different sauces to try with our super yummy sweet potato tots, and even though I don't like ketchup...the spicy ketchup was really good.

I got the Backyard BBQ burger, relapse (5 oz) size and my boyfriend got the PB+J 10 oz size because our waitress told us it was the most popular and he wanted to be bold.

Well anyways, the PB+J burger was actually good. What?! Life is full of surprises. The menu says there's sriracha in it but he couldn't taste it at all. 
I substituted my onion rings w/ pineapple instead and it was very hawaiian tasting. 

The menu is very creative. The burgers were good but wasn't amazing. The sweet potato tots were verrry delicious. I love anything sweet potato. And the sauces made it better."}
{"text":"I love this place!!! A great addition to the neighborhood- fun vibe, cheap and refreshing drinks, yummy food. Been here several times since they opened and will keep coming!"}
{"text":"Got two stars bc have been there in the past (4x past year) and loved it. Today was a BIG disappointment. Premises (inside and out) seemed uncared for. Sat on patio... and with this heat, would expect wait staff to be prompt with waters, instead we had a long wait. Once we ordered, staff neglected to ever bring table settings until we requested three times! And by the end we KNEW what to expect; got carry out boxes for ourselves."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere!! The service was phenomenal!!  Good beer selection and the food was awesome!! Sweet potato tater tots and the burger with pulled pork on top was great!  Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Cool burger place. Asked waitress for recommendations on unique burger to choose and it was excellent. Will visit again when I return to scottsdale."}
{"text":"Love this bar!! Me and my boyfriend come here all the time and it's so close we just ride our bikes and come for a great burger and the pig wings!! The staff is great and it's such a great place to just have a drink and chill"}
{"text":"It's 9pm on a Saturday night and you've just gotten through roughly six stoutly beers and the drunk bees in your stomach are making it known they want company. This is the place to go. 

I start off with the fried calamari, which were cooked to absolute perfection, not a soggy piece among them, a whole meal's worth by themselves. For my main course, the Hatch Chile Cheeseburger with a turkey substitute and the pretzel bun, and an overabundance of sweet potato tots with a chipotle aoli sauce to dip them in. I am in food heaven here. THe chiles gave the burger such a good amount of heat and the flavor...intense. 

My companion and I then split one of the Pot Brownies, reese's style, cuz you gotta have peanut butter with chocolate to cut that much chocolate. I'm not sure if it's because the dessert was thought up by a pot head or because of the cast iron EasyBake pot it comes in but this darkened brick of brown love is delivered, swimming in a lake of what I soon discover is mallow creme, and topped with (you have to mention you want it or you'll sadly go without) two scoops of vanilla ice cream. It's not a dessert for the faint of heart or with diabetes, because if you don't already have to take regular insulin injections you probably will after consuming it.

Whether stoned, high, drunk, or just come down with a super case of the munchies, this little gem in SoSco will hit all your right buttons."}
{"text":"We went here right after a spring training game and it was packed, as expected. We had a 45 minute wait but were able to stand at the bar and have a drink while watching the NCAA tourney. The staff was very friendly despite is kind of being in the way!

When we got seated we got our food pretty quickly which was surprising given how busy it was. The burgers we had were great and you can choose a pretzel bun which was amazing. 

I couldn't resist and had to order the mac N' cheese burger. It was good, a bit rich but it did have Mac N' cheese on it. Overall it was much easier to handle than I anticipated and I was very pleased. 

I'll be visiting again while in Scottsdale. If recommend it to anyone in the area looking for a good burger and good prices."}
{"text":"Did I ask them to cook my burger perfectly... no, but they did!!!

As a matter of fact they never did ask me how I wanted my 10 ounce burger cooked, but when it came out and I had my first taste I knew it was love at first bight! I dont think I have ever had a better cooked or tastier burger in my life! The carmlized onions were bliss and the pretzle bun had just the right heft to hold up to this massive burger

The place was only 11 days old on our visit so when the Pig Wings didnt fly, that misfire was excused, but with a tad more work this intersting cut of pork could soar. The \"wings\" were just a tad dry and the sauce was one dimentional, but I like the concept. 

Our server offered the wedge salad $5 and said it was good- she was flat out lying, it was amazing! By far the very best wedge I ever ate, made myself, or served any one of my customers. Our group of 3 were still talking about it 3 days later, and we are all foodies that work in the Biz.

One of the owners stopped by the table to chat, that was a nice touch and her crazy beautifull smile was a more then welcome addition to our lunch.

Is this the best restaurant in town... Heck No! it's far to cassual to compete with the very best, but its my new favorite place in Old Town.

{"text":"Since the last review I wrote over a year ago (it was delicious then), I can now say this is one of my favorite spots in AZ. The service and food are both amazing. I have yet to order something here that hasn't been delicious -- my favorites (besides the burgers, which are all amazing) are the wings, sweet potato tots, and the chili cheese fries.. SO good!!! The place gets very busy so get here early, also, all day happy hour on Thurs!"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING!  My favorite burger spot by far.  I've actually tried a lot of the menu items and have never had a bad thing.  The PBnJ Burger will not disappoint.  Also, staff and service are always on point.  I go here at every opportunity."}
{"text":"Great burger joint with a good music playing.  I tried the PB and J burger, which is surprisingly pretty good.  Girlfriend had the veggie burger and said it was delicious as well.  We came at 1pm on a Saturday, which happened to be the time the farmers market next door ended.  Things were pretty hectic but we squeezed into some open seating outside on the railing.  It took a little bit to get service but the waitress was pleasant and kind.  Hostess could use s little guidance and some slight tweaks would make things run smoother, but either way we would definitely eat here again!"}
{"text":"Holy Dirty word Batman!  These burgers were amazing.  I had the PB and J Burger and I loved it!  I wasn't sure what I was getting into but it was worth every bit. They had a great beer selection and the atmosphere was laid back Marly Style. I highly recommend it!  The guy next to me had the macaroni burger and was in heaven.  He was making A lot of obscene noises rivaling that of \"when Harry Met Sally\"'s famous Diner scene.  Definite stop when your hungry!"}
{"text":"Super satisfying gourmet, fresh burgers. The ambience is relaxing. Service is great. The food tastes like its from scratch. Prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"We found Burger Therapy quite by accident.  And although it broke very dietary rule .. it was well worth it.  I don't remember the name of the burger  I had but it was pepper jack cheese, with hot peppers, with hot sauce, with a grilled poblano on it and a stack of crispy o'rings.  2 drinks and the check and it was great.  And that outside in 120 degree weather ... the menu reads like a piece of heaven.  Very casual laid back atmosphere. Put on your list - no regrets."}
{"text":"The only downfall to this spot is the location, it is small & seating is limited, and they don't allow call ahead reservations, so you can end up waiting for a very long time. Worth the wait, but still frustrating. We love the sweet potato tots & the PBJ burger...yummy!"}
{"text":"Outstanding service and food. Our waitress was very welcoming and courteous. The atmosphere is perfect and goes well with the music/beach style vibe. Love it here!"}
{"text":"My husband, 6 year old son, and I came here last Sunday and am so happy we tried it out! Large portions are served here, so make sure you come with a vengeful appetite! We arrived at around 3PM and the place was packed. We waited for about 20 minutes. No benches to sit and wait indoors. Not so bad to wait outside around this time of year in AZ. But waiting outside in the summer heat for that long... Yikes! Yeah.. No, thanks! Anyway, we ordered my son a hot dog and fries. The hot dog was massive for the little guy but he put up a good fight. They charge extra for fixings. Luckily, he's a plain old ketchup and mustard kind of kid. I ordered the hangover with lettuce and tomato on a wheat bun and the husband ordered mushroom and Swiss with lettuce and tomato on a pretzel bun. Well... Boy was it tough to wrap my mouth around that giant burger! It's like I had to strategize on how to approach it. Should I take a bite from the top, then a bite from the bottom? It was massive! But so so yummy! Egg was perfectly fried. Runny yolk and all! Oh, yeah! Sweet potato tots were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Delicious. In spite of the long wait to get in and get served... We all walked out 10lbs heavier and 10 times happier."}
{"text":"Great place for burgers. Sometimes can be a pretty long wait, but between bar/outdoor patio its no prob!"}
{"text":"It's finally open! I'm doing the first Yelp review! Great food! I got the porkster burger and it did not disappoint! The burgers a little pricey, but great quality. Totally worth it! Lots of fun libations too."}

This is tucked between RNR and a pawn shop. It has both patio seating and inside. You check in at the front door and wait outside. You can also grab a drink at the bar but if it's busy then  pull have a hard time doing so. We arrived on a Sunday afternoon around 1pm and there was a 25 minute wait. The sun was kinda brutal and shade was scarce but we were lucky to find some. 

Granted, I'm here during my spring break so I figured other people are too cause it's like a scene straight out of a college movie. The islander/beach decor and loud groups bring me back to Spring Break In San Diego or Florida.

We got the 10oz spicy mac and cheese burger, pig wings, and sweet poTOToes. I wish the burger lived up to its name because it wasn't spicy at all. Yes there were jalapenos but when you call something spicy I was hoping the bun would also have a kick. The mac n cheese was an interesting and yummy addition. The pig wings were really my favorite because it was tender and a good combo of savory and sweet. The sweet pototoes were crunchy but I got tired of them really quickly. 

All in all, this is a great place to go for a hearty burger and to get that Spring Break vibe."}
{"text":"not worth the wait to get in here. Service was slow,host unfriendly and food taste like everyone else's hamburger.  Giant tourist spot! I guess they don't have McDonald at home!"}
{"text":"Really good burger! Some can be very big so don't waste your money if you don't think you can handle it. Try the sweet potato tots."}
{"text":"Deserves every single star. Seating was super quick despite being peak lunch hour. The hostess took us to the patio but we ended up grabbing a seat right inside the building (so still got the great breeze). 

Our server (Rian) made some suggestions for drinks and pointed out the happy hour selections. 

We ordered the PB&J burger- tastes like it sounds and was A LOT but definitely good. Also got the Jalapeño popper burger (substituted with black bean burger instead of meat). AWESOME!!! Both came with sweet potato bites (but there's an option of fries, etc) and a variety of sauces. 

Such a great way to end a holiday weekend. Will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"First off, my burger and tater tots were great. I got the large Porkster burger which is a hamburger patty topped with BBQ pulled pork - 10oz of meat overall. It came with cheese on a brioche bun and I could only finish half! The sweet potato tater tots were a nice side, especially with the pineapple terriyaki aioli sauce for dip. No complaints here!

My 10oz burger with tots, mom's 5oz burger with tots, and a lemonade came to just under $30. 

However, had a big disappointment with the lunch time service. Our server was nice but way too much of a space case. He was really attentive until we got our food and then went MIA as the lunch hour started to pick up. Never got another refill on my drink, had to grab the usher for a to-go box, and when we finally got his attention after waiting for a bit we asked for the check and to try out the dessert (\"Pot\" brownie). Instead of dessert, we just got our check (sans dessert listed, with no mention of said dessert) so we just paid and left. Ain't nobody got time for that!"}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of Rehab Burger! Happy hour seems to be all day, everyday, so who can complain about that?! And the burgers are really creative and delicious. I always get the peanut butter, jelly and sriracha burger, and although that sounds like a crazy combination, it is really delicious! Great vibe and service too."}
{"text":"Great burgers... I've been a couple times already and the burgers have been consistently good!"}
{"text":"Perfect. Great atmosphere. Spectacular service, at least at the bar where we ate. Outdoor seating with heaters. Fantastic burgers. Every option you ca think of or make your own. Location is nice. Right next to free public parking. The bartender even rings up an extra drink to get in on happy hour but delivers it later when you are ready. Music not too loud so you can talk. If you are in the area and want a burger, GO!  I think it was well worth the trip"}
{"text":"It's a good burger. But nothing out of this world amazing that I need to pay $15? It just feels forced. Nonetheless if you go, you'll get a good burger. I just feel like I can get a better one somewhere else with a better beer selection and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Wow!  Sweet potato tater tots are the bomb!

Wow!  Sweet potato tater tots are the bomb!

Wow!  Sweet potato tater tots are the bomb!

Yes, they deserve three call outs!

Bacon and blue burger was big, juicy, tasty and enough to make me want to return again to try more!

There are lots of great restaurants within walking distance of this place.  Don't discount it because you think it is just another burger joint.  They offer a whole lot more!"}
{"text":"When visiting for a bachelorette weekend, we stayed in the Old Town area and were looking for something low key and delicious for dinner. Since I know on of the managers here, this was my suggestion.

Love the kitschy beach theme and that there were tables long enough for our whole group.

Everyone at our table tried something different, and thankfully there was something for everyone. The swimmers got their salads, the southern girls got their chicken sandwiches, and I got my ever holy PBJ & Bacon burger. Seriously, dont knock it til you try it. Im from MA, so I grew up eating peanut butter on burgers, but with jelly? And BACON?! I had to have it. Ah-mazing. Messy, but amazing.The sriracha is a nice touch too. It cuts through the sweetness of the grape jelly.

I highly recommend stopping in here. Thank for having us , Dave!"}
{"text":"Definitely a new favorite! I had the poblano burger and it was so good! My husband had the Mac Gnarly burger and even though it took some technique to eat the monster size double patty burger, he really enjoyed it. 

Service was great! Our server was very nice and took care of us well. Happy hour is daily until 6pm

Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"FUN place with good burgers and fantastic sweet pot tots!  Patio was too busy so were inside and it was loud but nice, fun décor and excellent service.  The regular and turkey burgers were outstanding and the pretzel buns added to them.  Lots of choices on sauces."}
{"text":"Definitely some very tasty food at this place! My old uncle is cautious about new places but after the experience, he has no problems coming back! 

My brother and I ordered the Spicy Mac N Cheese Burger, Rehab size and the portions of the burger did not disappoint. Everything there that we tried was really well made, especially the onion rings that can be substituted in. 

Our other family got BBQ pulled pork sandwiches and the pulled pork was amazing! Definitely a good choice and there was quite a large amount of pork justifying the price. 

My main complaint is that the location is pretty small which would not be a problem but the time we went there, it was packed! Which in the end is a good thing since everybody knows how good it is. The service was also really timely and observant of our drinks and helped specify some items on the menu. 

My major complaint is that the Spicy Mac N Cheese Burger was not spicy! It had only a little dollop of sriracha on a bit of it but they definitely could have done better with the spiciness level. Still tasty though!"}
{"text":"I got the spicy mac and cheese burger and it was AMAZING. you really get a ton of food. good service and we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The burgers here are best in town . The sweet potato tots are reason enough to go here . They have an array of different dipping sauces to choose from to accompany your dish . I really like the chipotle ranch and chipotle aioli.  I've tried just about all the burgers and my top two by far are the Bistro Burger and the siracha peanut butter burger .  If you're on the fence about ordering a peanut butter burger or maybe you've had one in the past and didn't care for it , pull the trigger on this one . The flavors are excellent and it will change your whole perspective on what you thought a burger should taste like . Service is always great and they always have good happy hour specials. If you're in town and looking for a great burger you have to check this place out . You won't regret it . Just make sure you don't order the rehab size burger if you plan on going out drinking and walking around . Rehab size will put you in a good coma and you'll be in Netflix and  Pajamas mode in a hurry . Not that it's a bad thing ..."}
{"text":"Super fun place and OMG the burgers are fun, creative and memorable. Definitely a great place to step out of your comfort zone.

Hubs had the PB&J with a side house salad. It was messy in a wonderful way. I dared the McNarly (see photo). It was huge! Totally doable if you pass on the buns. I'd probably do salad instead of fries, or maybe tater tots. 

It was Sunday brunch and the brunch bevy's were also great. We will be back soon."}
{"text":"Customer service was over the top . The burgers were imaginative and downright fabulous! I have never had sweet potato tator tots but now I can't wait to have them again . Ask for some of their dipping sauces or the spicy ketchup. We will be back!"}
{"text":"So you go there with hopes and expirations of getting a hamburger to maybe even for for the Super Bowl. To find out they're closed. Closes on the Super Bowl specially a hamburger joint? These guys"}
{"text":"Great! Love to see out on the patio. Bring your appetite, the burgers are huge and the sweet potato tots are to die for!"}
{"text":"Stopped by Rehab on a Sunday afternoon. It was pretty busy but after a short wait we managed to snag a good spot on the patio.

I really liked the big selection of burgers and toppings possibilities that they offered. I ended up doing a BYOB (Build Your Own Burger) with cheddar, lettuce, tomato and thousand island dressing on a pretzel bun, along with the sweet potato fries. My boyfriend got the mac and cheese burger without the hot peppers and regular fries. 
Our orders came out quickly. Mine came out with regular fries and when I mentioned that I had ordered the tots they brought me the tots with no hassle at all.

The burgers are big, even the smaller size. But they were very flavorful and the ingredients were fresh. The bun was nice and soft too - good bun to burger ratio. 

The mac and cheese on the burger was a fun combo. They really load it on! And the tots and fries were good too. 

Overall it's a lot of food, a cool laid back vibe and solid burgers for sure."}
{"text":"Not sure what all the hype is about.  The toppings for their burgers are interesting for sure (pbj, or Mac and cheese, etc)-- but the burger itself?  Not so great.  Best part of the meal was the fries."}
{"text":"Best burgers I the city absolutely love this place the new location is much bigger than the one o.k. Scottsdale which is nicebut both locations are AMAZING"}
{"text":"Very laid back place. Fits with the area.

Burgers are the thing here. They don't disappoint. Also, I am a fan of pretzel buns, which they have here.

They are huge and two of us in our group split one. Servers are friendly and good atmosphere."}
{"text":"Amazing place! It is definitely a hot spot in downtown Scottsdale. We waited almost 40 min for a table but it was worth the wait. Even though we waited that long,the food was fast and very tasty."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time because we originally went to Cold Beer & Cheeseburgers and the wait was over an hour.  We are so glad we didn't wait.  Besides the burger being excellent (and it was), the service was amazing.  We were seated immediately and opted to sit outside.  They have a great mister system and even in June, in Phoenix, we were actually a little chilly!  The burgers come in 2 sizes (10 oz & 5 oz).  We opted for the smaller because I don't think I could eat 10 oz.  Burgers come with a choice of side (unlike the \"other\" place mentioned earlier) and were delicious.  Every single server went out of their way to be nice and helpful.  Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"The food was great but the server we had with the Detroit tattoo was a total dick. He rolled his eyes when we asked for water. Someone at our table was once an alcoholic, I feel it's completely inappropriate to whine because your bill won't be higher than what you want since alcohol isn't involved in the initial drink order.

Then once the other members of the party decided to have a celebratory drink, he asked how we wanted it and interrupted us to let us know it's one way or no way. I'm sorry, who's paying this bill? 

Your food could be free and it excuse the awkwardness at our table from one of your employees. Not sure if he enjoys attempting this hard ass front but it's not cute."}
{"text":"I can't understand why this place gets such high ratings.  The burgers are just not good.   The meat was flavorless and tasted low quality.  The fries and tots were ok, but nothing special.  The worst part was the service-we waited an hour to receive our burgers.  The only highlight was the Jamaican corn side dish.  I would not return."}
{"text":"Their wings are the bomb!!
Good pricing
Their burgers keep you sooo full cause they're so big
Oh and ps bring back the loco Moco burger pls
It was gone before I could taste it
Rehab is my fav for burgers thou! 
And I love that they play rebelution and iration. They play my California reggae music
Makes me feel home !"}
{"text":"What an eclectic environment...I love the décor, it's fun and whimsical, which usually means this place is going to be fun.  Well, I was right, medium size dining room and additional seating on patio available.  Good size menu with all kinds of signature burgers to choose from.  This was my first time visiting, and I ordered the Spicy Mac N' Cheese Relapse size (5 oz).  All of their signature burgers offer 2 sizes (Rehab 10 oz-basically 2 patties, I believe).  You can tell their mac is made from scratch and it was tasty with chunks of fresh jalapenos and bacon.  As the waiter says, \"don't be afraid to get messy,\" but flavorful and delicious.  The fries are good as well, thick cut and seasoned to perfection and crispy.  My waiter (Ben) was nice and attentive.  And, I watched other servers interact with their tables and it appears all of the wait staff is that way, which makes for a good place and nice environment.  I will definitely be back to try other things and bring others..."}
{"text":"It would be silly for me NOT to give this place 5 stars! 
My husband and I decided to spend the day in old town Scottsdale, when we chose to eat lunch at this local gem. We walked in and were greeted right away, and seated. The place was moderately busy. Our waiter Ryan was over right away, with a great personality and a big smile. He took our drink orders, and gave us time to look over our menus. They have two sizes of burgers to choose from Rehab is the bigger one, and relapse is the smaller one. I chose the relapse Hawaiian burger. It came with pineapple slice, ham slice, cheese, sweet mayo, and I chose a gluten-free bun. I chose the sweet potato tots for my side. Our good came out in a reasonable amount of time, and was delicious! My burger was cooked perfectly, and the sweet potato tots were very good. We started with the chips and salsa, as they were only $3.99 with the check in offer! The chips were homemade as well as the salsa and both very good. Ryan made sure our drinks were never empty. The decor is beachy, and there is ample seating inside, and outside on the patio. They have a bar. I can not wait to stop by here again to try another 5 star burger!"}
{"text":"For awhile the name scared me but wow, great burgers and fries. The onion rings looked good too, next time..."}
{"text":"Relaxing, Jamaican beach vibe. Best food my husband and I have had since we moved here from the Midwest. Sky high burgers, great pasta dishes with added hatch chili to give it just the right amount of kick. We even ordered food to take home since everything looked good! Great drinks! Wide selection of Tequilas to chose from. We are telling all our friends about this hidden gem, and will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"I have been saving this place for a special occasion. Well 18 pounds lost, and I am so happy I left this for my celebratory meal! We ordered the green Chile appetizer and it is a must! A tad spicy but full of flavor! I ordered the Spicy Chili Mac & Cheese burger and although it was still amazing... the Mac and cheese lacked flavor and not really spicy. But, the burger patty being perfectly cooked and seasoned made up for it. Their Coron-Rita is strong but super good! Overall a great place, nice and attentive staff. I'll definitely be back to try their infamous PB&J burger!"}
{"text":"This place makes me happy. Great burgers, so many varieties, laid back atmosphere. The famed is the Mac and cheese burger. We have yet to try it. Recomending the Swiss and mushroom with sweet potato fries."}
{"text":"Came here for a brunch/dinner spot that had a happy meal menu.  This place is large, has an outdoor and indoor seating area.  Servers were nice and attentive, spending time answering our questions.   They took care of our needs with haste.
We ordered sweet potato fries, regular fries, and onion rings as well as a margatini.  potatoe fries I didn't care for.  The sauce didn't make it any better as well, which is disappointing.  The fries and onion rings were good, nice and crunchy but not oily at all.  The sauces were good especially when mixed with the hot sauces they had there.  Then we ordered a to go ghost pepper burger which was really spicy.  Didn't care for that too much. The margarita was strong and hit the spot most definitely.
Overall the vibe was nice.  Cool little hangout for th3 college kids there.  Service was excellent.  Food made it a 4 out 5 star rather than a 5 starbut overall it was q nice experience"}
{"text":"Try the porkster burger, just remember to bring some wet naps"}
{"text":"Great chill burger place in Scottsdale! Love their décor and music (think various reggae, alternative, classic rock, etc.). A well-misted patio w/ample umbrellas defending the harsh Sonoran sun always is appreciated!

Shared their fried calamari - wonderful! Big chunks in a delish coating of herbs. Served w/lemon wedge and aioli sauce.

Good Happy Hour prices - $2 for Bud Light drafts? Can't complain - I can dig for that under my car seat. 

Service very friendly and attentive. Recommend outside on patio but the flies are driving me batty! Maybe consider adding some citronella candles?"}
{"text":"I had been wanting to come here for a long time because I heard really good things. I finally got the chance and came here for lunch with a co-worker today, but unfortunately I was kind of disappointed. We got there and there was a short wait which was fine and to be expected, but there was literally no where to stand to wait without being in someone's way. (It was raining outside so maybe people normally wait on the patio? There are no chairs or benches or anything.) We got our table within a few minutes and our waiter got our drink order pretty quickly. He was helpful and knowledgeable about the menu, made some recommendations for us, and we placed our order. 

The lunch rush was starting to end shortly after we ordered, so there were plenty of open tables after being there for 15 minutes. But somehow it took a good 25-30 minutes to get our food. When our food did come out, our waiter dropped it off and didn't come back to check on us for quite some time. I wanted to ask for a side of mayo and another side of chipotle aioli (which was really good) but he disappeared. I finally saw him seating another group and I tried to make eye contact with him several times but he just kept going back and hanging out at the bar. I finally got him to come over and he brought my sauce quickly, but then it was the same thing again with our check. Because it took so long to get our food (which was just 2 very simple burgers and tots, nothing too fancy) we had to get back to work quickly. We finally got his attention and we asked for our checks, but it seriously took another 5 minutes for him to bring it. Kind of frustrating. 

My burger wasn't that great. I got the hatch burger and it was just a green chile and a really thick piece of cheese that was not even melted. Nothing else, which made it pretty dry (hence my desire for more sauce). I wasn't really impressed at all. I love the mexican burger at Lenny's and was hoping for something similar but it's really the opposite. The sweet potato tots were pretty good though, I did like those. And I liked the atmosphere of the place, they played a lot of Pepper which is one of my favorite bands, so it wasn't all bad. Overall I wasn't impressed and I'm much more interested in trying some of the other burger places around here than coming back."}
{"text":"Salyna was amazing! The food was just mediocre but would probably come back just to hang out with her! If you get her as your waitress you're a lucky table for sure!"}
{"text":"Had an amazing time w friend at this place.  Fun atmosphere, great service and amazing food.  10 oz burger was huge.  Couple have got 5 oz n been enough food.  I definetly recommend this place.  Get here early as it was busy. Dog friendly."}
{"text":"We went to Rehab for a late lunch today and while it started out with good intentions, in the end we were extremely disappointed. On the bright side, I loved the decor. It's very well done with the surfer vibe and the sweet potato tots are some of the best I've had. 

The real issues were coming out of the kitchen. As I was people watching, I noticed tables coming in. I also noticed table by table, food was coming out for them before ours. Shortly after we ordered our second round of drinks smoke did fill the small restaurant and we made jokes about our food being on fire, so we chalked it up to our order actually being the cause of the smoke. It was a late lunch so by this time it was past well past 1 p.m. Our server cruised by and said we were waiting on the wings one of us ordered.

Finally the food arrived and it couldn't have been the wings, since they were cold. Both burgers had burned pretzel buns, and one side of tots was half a serving of cold tots. The server said he would bring more, then never returned. The restaurant was quite busy, so we took matter in our own hands and asked someone to bring the tots and fill our drinks, but the burgers weren't great. We ate them anyway because at this point we were just so hungry!

Finally we were waiting for our check to be split and who I assumed is the manager came by our table and asked how it was. We were honest and told him it wasn't great. He arrogantly replied \"Not great? But you ate all your food\" I looked at him and said \"Yeah because I waited a long time for my food while all these tables who came in after us were served their meals\" It was ridiculous, I watched many of those tables leave as well while we were dealing with our tab. 

He pressed the issue, even though we didn't want to get into it because a) it seemed petty and b) we just wanted to leave, but he insisted . We told him our issues with the meal and 10 min later he returned with the food removed off the menu. The weirdest thing was his delivery. He pinned the checks on the table facing us so we could read it, and goes, \"How are we doing this\" holding our cards in his hand. I  pointed to my check and said \"I'm the blue card, so that's mine\" He just stared at me. I repeated, \"I'm the blue card\" and reached over to pull the card out of his grip, and he goes, \"Okay, so the $2 on the blue card and the $6 on the red card\" 

It was sooo rude. His demeanor was that we were being ungrateful, when we honestly just wanted to leave. When he returned he was full of excuses, (we're a new restaurant, we are very busy, etc.) which is FINE. I eat out all the time, and new restaurants all the time, and I expect growing pains, so I told him I liked the place, I would be back to watch a game, grab a drink. He replied, \"Well we are not a bar with good food. We are a restaurant with good drinks.\" 

What the hell? First of all, I wasn't even drinking, so I was just trying to be NICE. Thanks for not taking our constructive criticism YOU ASKED FOR then making us feel BAD about the discount you gave us that we weren't looking for. It was such a turn off, we talked about it the whole ride home and all day I've been telling people what a nightmare it was when they asked me about it due to me checking in on social media

So I lied to the manager... I won't be back. There are plenty of other mediocre burger shops around town that I can give my business to, and if I do end up there again, I'll be ordering the wings and tots. Their burgers are average. For a place with BURGER in the name, there is just absolutely nothing special about their signature menu item. Shoulda gone to In N Out."}
{"text":"The food is the only thing that saved this review. 
Just my experience here. I am sure there has been better and worse but this was mine:
We put our name in and we're told it would be a 15 minute wait. No problem, went to the bar for a drink. 15 mins go by and a party of 3, just like ours, walks in and gets sat immediately. I bring it to their attention and they get us sat at a different table shortly after. Confusing a mojito with a margarita, no silverware, forgetting condiments. Maybe just a bad day..... I'll go back again though, the food was that good."}
{"text":"This is my favorite burger place! I love there bacon cheeseburger, vanilla milkshake and the sweet potato tots! This is mine and my boyfriends go to place for a date. The patio area is the best place to sit!"}
{"text":"First time here, and my mind was blown, outstanding, I have never seen a burger menu with such different combinations"}
{"text":"A Tiki Lounge meets burger joint! What a cool concept! Rehab was pretty quiet when were were there for an early dinner. The TVs had a mix of aquarium scenes and people are awesome videos playing.

I had the mushroom swiss burger and the fries. The seasoning blend they use on the fries is killer. Add some of the Aioli sauce and you have a wild flavor combo. The burger was cooked perfectly and the buns are so fresh and tasty.

For the gluten free crowd they have several options. You can do a lettuce wrap or they have a gluten free bun too. 

My biggest regret is filling up on the burger and fries. I would love to go back and try the pot brownies. I bet they are worth the pain of over eating."}
{"text":"Went to dinner with my girlfriend and her mother. Our waitress Jennifer was awesome and most of the other staff checked on us frequently. Thumbs up for the customer service. Now on to the food... 
This has to rank as one of the better burgers I've had in my time. I had the Bacon and blue burger which was cooked perfectly. It was seasoned correctly so the burger developed a crust on the outside and hot and juicy on the inside. My girlfriend had the hangover burger which was as equally delicious... I only know because I stole some. It was nice and relaxing on a Tuesday evening. Give this place a try and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Burgers were absolutely delish and were definitely worth 5 stars, but unorganized service caused me to take away 1 star. The place has a very casual, beachy look and feel to it, quite nice! There are two choices in sizes for the burgers 1: the Rehab which is 10 oz of angus beef. 2: the Relapse which is 5 oz of angus beef. But for only a couple dollars more, my husband and I decided to go \"Rahab\" for our burgers and take home leftovers. Well when our burgers came, mine was noticeably smaller than his and I asked the waitress. She said yes that what I received was a \"relapse\" and that she would go check the computer to see what size I had ordered even though I told her  .  I had ordered the \"rehab\". When she came back, she said that the smaller size was what was written down but that she will go and have them make me a Rehab. That was fine with me, I don't usually get upset easily. But she took away the wrong size burger so I was left staring at my husband eating his gigantic chile cheeseburger and nibbled on his yummy tater tots and my onion rings that came with the burgers. 15 minutes go by and another waiter comes by and asks if we would like boxes to take home leftovers! I told him that I have not received my burger yet due to a miscommunication. He apologized and said that he would bring my burger out as soon as he sees that it's ready. 10 more minutes go by and I my burger comes out, but by then I was not hungry anymore and my husband was done eating. So I took a bite just to taste it and to appreciate the freshness. It was so delicious!  Then our waitress came by and I asked for a box. She took a look at my almost untouched burger and actually said \"Stuffed huh?\" I just smiled cause it was actually quite funny how she didn't even acknowledge that my appetite and dinner were kind of ruined because of her mistake. I understand that that mistake easily happened because the place was packed and the music was loud and that \"Rahab and Ralapse\" can sound the same. I just wished they had tried a bit harder to make up for the mistake. Perhaps they could have left me the first burger to eat at the same time as my husband and let me take home the one I ordered? Or maybe discount my check? Idk...but we did think the burgers, tots, and onion rings were delicious and the prices are great."}
{"text":"Took the family while in Phoenix. Great atmosphere. Background music was perfect: reggae, kick back tunes. Food was great. Burgers huge and kids sizes were large. Nice local feel.  Wait staff was excellent."}
{"text":"The best burger I have ever eaten, the next time I'm in Phoenix I will definitely stop there again!"}
{"text":"We are a huge fan of the Scottsdale location, so decided to foray into Sun Devil territory to check out the new location.  It's bigger, but louder.  We are used to loud, but it wasn't that crowded yet and had to repeat ourselves a lot. 

Same amazing menu.  My favorites include their Pig Wings, and Hawaiian Burger. We love their sweet potato tots. A nice feature is selecting your dipping sauces. We like their pineapple teriyaki aoli.  Patrick's favorite menu item is the PB&J burger. 

We love the option of two sizes of burgers and salads. Relapse vs Rehab. 

On a whim we tried a different burger. It was our first time ordering the Pablano burger.  It had spicy onions on it, which were a little overwhelming.  But otherwise very tasty. 

The service was great.  Good teamwork. I love that they want your food to come out the way you want it and sincerely check on your satisfaction.  

We will be back."}
{"text":"Always such good food and their mixed drinks are to die for! Plus super friendly staff and the restaurant is always clean!"}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp of course. What a find it is too. Easy parking, fun place as soon as you walk in. Our Server, Cathy was super friendly and made sure to explain the menu choices to us. I went with the Poblano Burger and it was one of the better burgers I've ever had. Wifey had the Mushroom Swiss and loved it. The Sweet Potato Tots are awesome. Our friend got the Hatch Burger and said it was great. We also tried the Frito Chili appetizer, so good. This is a great restaurant and can't wait to return."}
{"text":"The pb and j burger is definitely something to try! I added a fried egg on mine and it was truly a glorious mess, maybe not too suitable for a first date unless you want your partner to know you can get down and dirty. The sweet potato tots and chili cheese fries were lit! It was happy hour so the Mai tais were flowing and were also delicious and strong. My boyfriend got the large bistro burger and plain fries and said that the taste after a while got boring, because it was so big. I just had one bite and it was pretty tasty! Our server was super helpful and nice! I definitely recommend coming, especially during happy hour, if your ready to go to town on delicious food."}
{"text":"This place knows burgers at least while I was there they cooked mine perfect I like it still medium rare and it was exactly that portions are big for a good price brought family from out of town and first time myself and it was quick service and waitress was on point with ordering and getting food to table will be bringing my husband"}
{"text":"I forgot about this place until my friend suggested it as a less busy dinner option. We still had to wait 20 minutes on a Saturday night but that was probably less than other spots.

We decided to get the chicken wings appetizer and our server suggested we mix the medium sauce and Gold Medal sauce, a Southern BBQ mix of vinegar and mustard. Those were delicious and we finished them. For our burger, we ordered and split  the jalapeño popper with the veggie patty. The description sounded promising: guacamole, cream cheese, cheddar, and jalapeño poppers on a pretzel bun. However, all together it was bland. The flavors didn't stand out and there was no kick, the jalapeños weren't spicy and I had to add salt but it didn't help. It needed spice and heat for sure, maybe something sweet to balance too.

Not sure I'd rush back anytime soon, considering how many other dining options there are in Old Town, but the wings were worth it."}
{"text":"Great is followed by burgers, sides, service, menu, and decor!!  I can't wait for the Tempe location to open near my work!!! It is called Rehab, but it is addicting!"}
{"text":"Great food, pig wings and spicy mac and cheese burger are fantastic. Next time I have to do the pb&j burger."}
{"text":"Wow! I've never had a better burger.  Cooked exactly to my request and phenomenal taste.  Cheryl was an awesome waitress,  tentive,  friendly and fun.  If you're wanting a burger,  RBT is the place to go."}
{"text":"I had the jalapeño popper burger (relapse size!)-- the flavors were pretty good, but the meat itself was ordinary.  I think this place depends on its toppings to provide flavor, and they aren't wrong, but I really prefer it when I can't get enough of the meat itself.

The sweet potato taters were just okay- I'd stick to the fries next time.

All in all, I wouldn't go out of my way for this place but I wouldn't be opposed to eating here again.  Its a cute place to hang out too and the wait/bar staff were really nice!"}
{"text":"We found this place due to such high ratings on multiple reviews. Not sure what everyone is smoking. The decor, menu, and service are akin to an Applebee's. Guess what? The food is about the same caliber. Shared the pork wings which were average. I had the hangover burger with fries. The fries were a dingy, brown color and mediocre. The burger on a pretzel bun was uninspiring. If you're looking for a good burger... Keep looking"}
{"text":"So this is the second time I had gone to the Tempe location. We even had the same waitress, anyhow we had a great experience. My burger was cooked perfectly; med rare and I was astonished, since my last experience was not cooked to how I ordered. These guys especially our server made an incredible effort to make our experience great. Thanks guys and we will be back for sure"}
{"text":"Let's just say nearly 24 hours after eating the ghost pepper burger my insides are still on fire. The burger and tots were delicious and made for a very satisfying lunch. Also, the service was unparalleled in friendliness and speed. However, things went awry as I was performing oral sex on my partner and my insides could simply no longer tolerate the heat. The untimely projectile vomit incident inflicted terrible spicy heated pain on my face and lips and of course on my partners genital area. I'll certainly be returning to this location but I'm sure I'll go for the mac n cheese burger next time."}
{"text":"This does not happen often that I completely disagree with the rating of the \"masses\" but I really struggled to see what's so great about this spot. I have been in the past to a number of spots specializing in throwing literally anything on a burger (peanut butter, chocolate, sardines, etc) and attracting a crowd just because of that. My genuine impression of Rehab was no different.

The decor is junk yard meets a restaurant, but has some recurring themes to it and tries to be badass with the bikes and all. It reminded me a bit of the theme at the Vortex in Atlanta, just not satanic. Stuff like that does not get me excited, but perhaps some people enjoy it. I'll just skip that and go straight to the one darn thing that matters, the food.

Onion Rings were mediocre, but huge. The Fish burger was quite disappointing, the fish itself was tasteless, but the burger was huge. So just picture getting something huge that you aren't really excited about eating. I've had better ingredient quality at airport restaurants. The pretzel bun was kind of cool and the only reason I'd give this spot more than 2 stars. I presume the idea is to eat this thing like an animal, as there was literally no way to fit it in the mouth. I was fine with that. My coworker had one of the beef burgers and was also rather disappointed by the meat quality. If you do come here, I'd suggest doing it more for a beer instead of food. If you want a damn good burger, hit up Relish Bistro at the Phoenician."}
{"text":"Been here 4-5 times now and the burgers keep getting better and better. Best burgers in Old Town!"}
{"text":"I'd like to give a review but never saw a server.  Sat down and nobody ever stopped by to welcome us our offer a drink. As we walked out b/c we were tired of waiting for a server the hostess just smiled at us?  She was 5ft from our table and never stopped to ask us if we needed anything. We stopped at AJ's on the way home and will grill our own burgers.  Shitty service, won't go back."}
{"text":"Dog friendly and chill patio. Burgers are awesome and they have pretzel buns."}
{"text":"So of course I had to have a PB & J  burger and am I glad I did! So good so much interesting fun in every bite. Something they leave out of the title is that there is a small bit of sriracha mixed in and as crazy as all this sounds (peanut butter, jelly, sriracha, burger) it is SO GOOD. If you know anything about food experimentation, the oddest combinations make some good tastes.
Cheese and chocolate, bacon and syrup, cottage cheese and chili cheese fritos. The PB & J Burger is up there with it! But this iconic burger is not the only thing to come here for, all their unique burger choices sound amazing. I literally had to ask the waitress to come back two different times because I was so undecided on what to get! They all look so good and so do the appetizers ( be warned though. The burgers are huge and filling so only order apps and burgers if you're really hungry or eat a lot usually).
The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars was the decor is dated and just screams \"Islands Burger knock off\" and the tables around ours were pretty filthy and set for people to sit down. 

Also, REHAB BURGER EXEC CHEFS: please make a 4-6-8 Slider plate that can serve almost as a taster so we don't have to decide on one of your delicious burgers but can try a multitude for different kinds (great for sharing too) so when I come back I won't have to gamble on a burger I may not like. Just a golden idea I'll pass along for free"}
{"text":"This place is really chill.. the servers are all pretty casual, but attentive and helpful.  I've been twice now; the first time I had the Hawaiian burger which was reeeally good.  If you're a fan of pineapple, give it a go.  The sweet potato tots are a great side.. I haven't tried their fries yet but I hear good things.  Last time I went, I had the special, which was a burger with PB&J, bacon and sriracha.. WHAT.  It was a combo that I had to try--when else would I have the opportunity?  It sounds crazy but something about peanut butter and beef was magical.. haha.  They also had this Jamaican jerk-covered cob of corn that was excellent.  Seems like they have a pretty solid happy hour.. all around, good experience!"}
{"text":"I've never been much of a quitter but I'm thinking I may need a longer stint in Rehab.   This place is great.   These people made one of my other fav's so why not start anew.  

We started with the Pig Wings (the sauce will be my new favorite on everything), YUM.   We proceeded to have the burgers (Hatch Chili Burgers and Mush/Swiss).  The hub ordered a 1/2 Shelby Spinach Shalad (he wasn't sharing).   We enjoyed the Fries (I did not see a Mermaid) and Tots (oh so good).   I recommend the sauces in this order  Peach Habanero, Spicy Ketchup, Chipotle Aioli, Stellar Mustard, Teriyaki Pineapple Aioli.    Like we really needed more so we had the Key lime pie.   

The team at Rehab are great!   Everyone is helpful and engaging.   

Whatever your addiction, they have the Therapy!   See you soon."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers I have ever had. And fantastic frozen margaritas I could easily drink  alllllllllllllllll night long! Staff are excellent and good fun, if you need some therapy from the stresses of life, come here and feel rejuvenated!"}
{"text":"OMG (regarding wait time complaint). Yes it takes a few minutes to cook 10 oz of beef to perfection. Slow down, order a specialty drink and enjoy this place!! Yes, I tried the wings (I always do) They were awesome. They call them medium but they were pretty hot, I ordered a side of hot sauce and that was great,  No complaints. But you must try the PIG WINGS!!! They are like bone-in riblets, pig drumettes, whatever... with spicy sweet peach hot sauce that is just worth the trip. And the burgers are great, 10 oz is HUGE, Everything cooked as ordered. The Hatch Chile burger was especially good. Staff was fast, fun, environment was full of energy and a very ecclectic clientele which I crave here in the desert. The beer was cold, and the bartender whipped up some specialty frinks that would knock even a seasoned drinker on their A-S-S. Try the blue rufie if you're a wimpy drinker, tastes like candy. Also good is the blueberry martini. YES, FULL BAR. Burger buns were really good, maybe they flew em in from Jersey but AZ never gets bread this good. No complaints ...will be back. Oh, and girls hula hoop in the parking lot if you get bored. They will share."}
{"text":"The PBJ burger was very good. I was hesitant to order it but it did not disappoint. Look forward to trying some more of their burger creations next time I'm in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Great burgers and tots.  Wife and I split a burger and it was more than enough for two.  Busy but friendly staff!! Would go again"}
{"text":"Food is ok. My first time was excellent. This time it was dry. They give out catsup in tiny dishes so couldn't choke most of the meal down. Service is sloooooooooooow. We came on a Sunday close to 145. It was almost 3 by the time our food came out. No apologies no explaining. Just a bunch of workers looking and dancing and messing around. Too bad food is good but dealing with the place is not worth the wait."}
{"text":"Place is just over the top for burgers. We tried quite a but and everything was phenomenal. Extremely messy so bring some wet wipes. 

I had the Mac and cheese burger and !"}
{"text":"The food is delicious! My husband had the ghost burger and I forgot what I had but it had pineapple, onion ring and barbecue sauce - both were fantastic! And yes they came with fries and a pickle. For sure on next years visit we're coming back. Both service & food were fantastic! Thanks for a great meal."}
{"text":"Yummy BYOB, relaxing vibe, good music, friendly staff. Definitely perfect stop before our 5 hour drive back to Los Angeles"}
{"text":"We went to the Tempe location recently on a Friday night at 6-7 pm. We were excited to try this place. I love burgers!! The place is fun looking.  After being seated and given menus our waitress asked is what we wanted to drink. When I asked what was in a tropical named drink she said \"I don't know , probably tropically things like,pineapple or coconut\". Now I think the menu should break down signature drinks but it does not, but the waitress should know. Now I know it was a new location and she's likely new, so I would have had no issue w her saying, sorry I am new, I'm not a 100%sure what's in it, so let me ask the bartender (now this would have been VERY simple  as we were at a table RIGHT next to the bar) she completely blew us off and did not even attempt to figure out what the drink was made of. I assume restaurants mAke a good profit off of the alcohol. We did not order any due to this. Next, I order a burger on brioche.... sorry they were out and only had pretzel or wheat . This seemed quite odd to me as this was early Friday night and I assume brioche is pretty popular. I didn't end up ordering a burger due to that. I know it sounds picky but I would think a burger restaurant would have that and it was what I wanted. The prices were good but service was not. Sadly I left hungry and disappointed. Maybe we will try again later."}
{"text":"Rehab is great. If you love burgers and don't mind taking an adventurous approach to your cuisine, then this is the place for you. From traditional burgers to burgers with two maple donuts as buns, this place has it all. Expect lots of options here, a fun environment, and a busy dining rooms, since it's on Mill Ave. There is a pretty generous happy hour with both drinks and food on the menu, so start your night out right and stop in at Rehab for a good dinner before a night of drinking!"}
{"text":"It was jumping on Thursday night.  We had to sit at the bar which wasn't a big deal.  Would definitely recommend this place fun atmosphere. I had the mushroom n Swiss burger which was excellent.  My boyfriend had the Hawaiian burger.   Quick service, other than waiting for our mojitos.   Bar tender needs to be more friendly, seems patrons were a bother other than two woman he knew at the bar.   All of the female employees were very attentive and made sure everyone at the bar was happy.  Would go back but get a table next time."}
{"text":"Fun and hip.  Great atmosphere.  Great service.  Loved the old bicycles hanging from the ceiling.

The burgers and fries were delish.  We also ordered the Mac & Cheese.  HUGE portion.  Ended up bringing half of it home which was fine by me because it was also delicious.  Spicy and flavorful.  Not your ordinary Mac & Cheese.

The drink menu is rather basic; nothing exceptional.  But you don't go for the drinks; you definitely go 'cause you're craving a burger.

We went on a Friday night.  Very loud and busy and fun.  Plenty of little crying kids in the restaurant too, which can be a good (or annoying) thing, if that's your thing.

Our first time.  We will definitely return."}
{"text":"My 2nd time at this spot and it didn't disappoint. My husband got the peanut butter and jelly burger and I got the burger with onion rings and BBQ sauce on it. He really liked his burger. I am not a PB fan so it was weird to me. My burger was delicious! The sweet potato tots were the bomb."}
{"text":"Service was great! The corn on the cob was delicious but the burgers were just a little too much! I got the Mac n cheese burger but it was literally overflowing and I was unable to pick it up. I think you could share a burger for sure!"}
{"text":"The burgers are all original ideas and you must order the pretzel bun!  The beer and cocktail selection is excellent.   What a great locally owned restaurant.  We return often.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Rehab Burger Therapy has been on my list for a few years now. Unfortunately, my girlfriend and I rarely venture into Old Town Scottsdale. And sadly, the only therapy I'm familiar with focuses more on speech than it does on meat.

Honestly, Rehab is a little different than I expected. I fully anticipated that it would be presented like all of those other \"high-end\" burger joints that are opening up on every street corner. I expected to be able to order a basic burger, and then proceed to have my bank account raped via upgrades, such as grass-fed beef, pretzel buns, premium ingredients, and all kinds of ridiculous tactics to raise your end price. 

Surprisingly, none of that is to be found here. Rehab Burger is about showcasing both traditional and unique creations that are executed incredibly well. You can pick your bun and choose how you want your burger cooked, and at least from what I could see, there were absolutely no sneaky \"upcharges\" for any changes we opted to make.

The place itself is decorated in what I'd describe as a beach house. It kind of reminds me of some chain you'd find on the Las Vegas Strip or at a tourist destination. I was prepared for the stereotypical twenty/thirty-something hoity-toity crowd to be out in full force, but surprisingly, the clientele is a vast mix of different people. Everyone from bikers, families, teenagers, working professionals, and those guys that look as if they eat here on a daily basis. It was quite a buzzing, yet oddly comforting environment.

The menu itself is somewhat bloated and can be a little intimidating at first glance. I opted for a Spicy Mac and Cheese burger in a Relapse (5oz), while my girlfriend chose the Hangover in a full-blown Rehab (10oz). We did this so we could split the Hangover in half and I could sample both burgers.

Meat, which we both requested to be cooked medium well, was done perfectly! Great quality and flavor that clearly puts them right up there with the best we've tried. I was skeptical about the mac and cheese, as subpar mac could be the equivalent of dumping ketchup on a juicy steak. Thankfully, it delivered as promised. The spice was present, while not as overwhelming as I had feared. My girlfriend enjoyed her Hangover, but removed the pepper due to her dislike of spice. Realistically, the Relapse is more than enough for one (normal) individual, so after I finished mine, I was only able to have a few bites of hers. I thought it was done quite well, honestly.

Fries were good quality and while sweet potatoes are not my thing, the tots were just okay. I enjoyed the variety of dipping sauces that our server brought out for us to sample.

Overall, I thought their burgers were excellent and we fully intend to come back in the future to sample some other offerings. While my girlfriend wasn't quite as enthusiastic as I was about the food overall, I still feel that it's one of the better options you can find in the surrounding area. 

A full five-star bump will require that we return to sample two other burgers and their dessert, which looks quite promising.

Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere, great downtown old Scottsdale area. We arrived around 2pm had a bit of a wait. Seems like it's always busy. Great food, beer and service. Only complaint was the desert. Ordered the brownie sundae and it was awful. Everything else was great!"}
{"text":"The burger components, sauces and accompaniments were all good. I just don't feel the quality of the beef was that great or stood out in any way."}
{"text":"We chose the B.Y.O.B burger, always a fan of keeping it real! The B.Y.O.B. burger stands for build your own burger, and our only addition was the cheese. They have plenty to choose from so you can find one to suit your taste. All burgers, and sandwiches , come with your choice of Skin-On-Fries or Sweet PoTOToes, which are sweet potato tater tots. Definitely go with the tots and ask for a side of the teriyaki pineapple aioli. They make it in house and it is to die for. Perfect for the tots. You can thank us later. If you do choose the fries, get the spicy ketchup to accompany them, its' also made in house.

{"text":"Best Burger of my life. Hangover relapse. A single patty with cheese, bacon, and fried egg on a pretzel bun."}
{"text":"Burgers are soo good, especially their pulled pork. But lately the service has been slow... I think they're just short staffed. For the most part though defintely a good bang for your buck."}
{"text":"Came here for Sunday funday, brunch, dinner, happy hour, and this place never seizes to satisfy! Burgers are all great, wings are to die for, let's just say everything on the menu is great, come here with my BF and friends and we always have a good time!"}
{"text":"You have to try this place! We had the PB&J burger and the Mac&Cheese burger and both were worth coming back for BUT the winner was the pig wings. Ah-mazing!"}
{"text":"HOLY PIG WINGS!!!  Seriously, if you like pork, you don't LIKE PORK, you just heard of it PORK... whatever...U NEVER HAD PIG WINGS BEFGORE!!    These addictive morsels of                       \"FOOD CRACK \"             are a must try...whoever you are try the pig wings, you won't be dissapointed.  It's a full lb so may have to share to leave room for the amazing burgers!"}
{"text":"We love going to this place.  The burgers are phenomenal. If you can't be in a surf shack on the beach listening to Caribbean tunes, this is a great alternative."}
{"text":"This is such a fun place to check out and eat at. I am surprised by all the different burger combinations. The burgers are big enough to share for sure. I was blown away by how delicious they are for how weird they sound but it works. My partner had a PB and J burger and I had Jalepeno popper burger and they did not disappoint at all!"}
{"text":"Burger rehab, has such a great vibe in such an exciting feeling inside I'd rather eat inside and out.

The staff is wonderful. And I do mean wonderful. They are very efficient and fast paced and yes I'm sure they get lost in the weed sometimes but I've been here twice and I've had a great time both times.

The first burger I ordered was the gnarly burger and I guess it could be best described as your regular ordinary double Dekker burger but it's huge. Next I ordered the spicy macaroni and cheese burger it was smaller than the gnarly burger but it was very good, and you get macaroni and cheese all over the place and it's actually tasty macaroni and cheese.

This is going to become a regular spot for me is I really like the vibe it's adult yet fun."}
{"text":"Awesome place, great staff, very accommodating of our group and 2 young kids, and the food was fantastic. Hit them up!"}
{"text":"Outstanding burgers and sweet potato tots. The place has a great vibe as well. I felt like I was on a Carribean island."}
{"text":"Amazing sweet potato tots, and I don't even like sweet potatoes. Burger was done properly, parking can be a little bit rough during peak hours tho."}
{"text":"Always amazing.  Never disappoints. The bartenders are always super friendly, helpful, and give great recommendations. The PB & J burger is one of the best I've ever had. I've been here about 10 times and have always been impressed. Thanks Rehab, keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Not knowing what to expect, we entered this run-down looking joint after free parking in the Parking Corral next door.  What a surprise!  Thanks to the flat screen TVs giving us views of tropical aquarirums, surfing movies, bicycles suspended from the ceiling and surfboard memorabilia everywhere, we felt like we were at a beach hut!  The platters of delicious burgers coming out of the kitchen predicted a burger phenomenon!  Our server, David, was very laid back and made some excellent recommendations for us, so we split one of our favorites, wedge salad (dressing was especially tart and savory,) and each ordered a \"Relapse\" (single) burger.  My wife went for the poblano burger, cooked medium as David recommended, with a grilled poblano with provelone cheese and spicy mustard and spicy catsup, on brioche.  I went for the hangover relapse, which included a fried egg, provolone, bacon and spicy catsup to dress it, also on David's recommended brioche bun.  We drooled as we ate they were both so tasty!  For a side item we both selected the Jamaican corn on the cob, a full cob grilled with island spices and wonderful.  Top this off with two happy hour beers each, the local Four Peaks 8th Street draft pints, and this was a perfect meal and we were seated immediately (kitchen was a little slow,) but got our bill and got to the theatre two blocks away with time to spare.  Can't wait to go back and try another taste sensation!"}
{"text":"In a world of extremely good burger joints, Rehab is a place to try.  I wasn't \"wowed\".  I thought it was a good burger, mediocre fries, and not enough parking, and too high of a price.

Does not come close to knocking The Aioli Burger off the top mark, but I don't think this place would be a disappointment to anybody.  Id be a fan with better parking."}
{"text":"We moved here from a city known world-wide for its food (Go Saints). Without question, Rehab Burger makes the best hamburger I've ever eaten, and that includes the time before I was forced to eat gluten-free. Their gluten-free burgers are addictive. Get the bleu-cheese infused offering, and you'll need a 12 step program if you decide not to eat one again (but why would you? The thing is amazingly good)."}
{"text":"Great chili burger and porkster burger, super onion rings....ya gotta try this place!"}
{"text":"I've only gone here for lunch, but I can assume it's just as great for dinner or an evening drink. I've taken co-workers here for lunch and thought the atmosphere was fine for a super casual lunch. The wait staff and bartenders always seen friendly and accommodating."}
{"text":"PBJ and Bacon burger is  heaven sent!!!!  No Joke!  Don't be afraid because it sounds funky... it is DELISH!!!!!"}
{"text":"First time here my buddy told me about it ...right around the corner from us. This place has a casual and relaxed atmosphere with a big garage door that rolls up and connects the inside bar with the outdoor patio. There are plenty of tables and some nice comfortable booths. If you like ska or long beach dub, the music is great (tribal seeds, slightly stoopid, stick figure, irration) that kind of music, it will be playing continuously (best part for me). The PBJ hamburger is a good item to order (get the small one it's plenty) and get the sweet potato tots for the side (they are dynamite). There is a decent selection of beer (when I went they had moon juice, ranger, a few other IPAs and typical domestics). The waiter (he) was great and the service was excellent. He checked on us several times, kept our waters full and the beers coming. (He even found and held something at the bar for me after I realized I had left it after leaving and went back). I will definitely go back to Rehab!"}
{"text":"One of scottsdale's many hidden gems. Burgers are amazing! We had a classic cheese burger and their chili cheese burger. Needless to stay, we left with our taste buds bursting and bellies full! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Very good food, incredibly friendly, helpful staff! Love this place."}
{"text":"Seriously wicked burger for carnivores and vegans alike! Who knew going to Rehab to be awesome?!?!  Lindsay Lohan would have stayed stayed all 60 days if she would have made it to Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I ended up here because the place my group wanted to go was closed, but it turned out to be amazing. I'm vegan so I wasn't thinking a burger place would be my scene, but the veggie burger is delicious. The waitress was very helpful about what was vegan on menu and even gave me a heads up that the buns have an egg wash on them. She put my veggie burger in a lettuce wrap instead and it was so good! My meat-eating friends were happy with their meals as well. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Service was great, despite being busy. Had the mac n cheese burger. It was very good. But I've had better: Guy Fieri's place in Vegas dominates the domain of mac n cheese burgers. 

If it weren't for my loyal devotion to Paradise Valley Burger's weekly special, I'd have given Rehab 5 stars. (If you're reading this PVBurger guy, I'm sorry for being infidelitous. Forgive me.)"}
{"text":"Amazing burgers! I've tried about 1/2 of their burger menu and NOTHING tops the PBJ, bacon, and shirachi hot sauce! Sounds strange but is incredible. Service is also great, everyone is friendly and welcoming, especially Trisha. Go try this place!"}
{"text":"A resounding yes!  I have been a couple of times and sat on the porch.  It is definitely worth the wait!  The service is spectacular and the menu is fabulous... even the pasta!  The serving sizes are huge so come hungry and come often!"}
{"text":"There are so many burger joints all over the place and this one does not disappoint at all.  Super laid back and easy going. Not quite fast food, but not high end.  

The sweet poTOToes are excellent, but warning: you get a pound of tots and they aren't the greatest warmed up if you take them with you so I advise sharing.

The burgers are enormous and they offer a wide variety of options including different types of meats, buns, condiments, etc.  

Happy Hour deals are mediocre, but if you want a good burger and you are in the area, this is a decent spot."}

It's a classy joint"}
{"text":"I expected a lot more for the hype. My sweet potato tots were a bit burnt, and the service was just okay. The waitress seemed like she really didn't want to be there. She wasn't rude or anything, but she wasn't particularly helpful.

The decor and ambiance of the place are really dingy. You'd expect from such a popular place that they could put a bit more effort into presentation. It wasn't like the food was cheap, either. I think I've been in nicer McDonald's, actually. The whole restaurant was uncomfortably hot, everyone smelled like they'd been in the sun all day, and it was as loud as a bar you go to find a one-night-stand. But it was 1pm on a Sunday, so that was really bizarre. Would it kill them to turn up the A/C? It is Arizona, after all.

I wanted to order one of their spicier menu choices, but I could barely stomach any food at all because of how stuffy the place was. I stuck with a fairly bland cheddar burger with thousand island dressing. I did not have any complaints about the burger, but it wasn't anything to write home about.

My brother ordered a frozen strawberry margarita to cool off. I'm glad I held off ordering one myself until I tasted it, because it tasted like that cheap corn syrup mixes you get on the bottom shelf in the liquor aisles at Walmart. I can make better at home, thanks.

I really expect better from Scottsdale than this, especially when this place has so much hype. Maybe it was an off day, or maybe not. There's dozens of awesome places in town to get a burger, and this one -- despite all the raves -- doesn't make my list."}
{"text":"The food here is AMAZING and the service is fantastic.  Huge portions, one burger was enough for two people to share. We ordered the PB&J bacon burger, and the Porkster burger. Both were delicious! Try the Quesadillio it's a meal in itself, kinda spicy and super tasty."}
{"text":"This place is a must.....we ordered the McNarly Rehab burger both of us with sweet potatoe tots..yummm & we shared an order of onion rings which were huge, crispy & delish. Wow....the McNarly was a double patty so juicy..piled high with lettuce, tomato, onion & cheese....with just the right amount of thousand island. I could only eat half b/c this is a BIG...Definately this is a burger you could share!! 
We ordered take outsince my friend had her pup with her but we will try again & next time we plan on eating in on the patio.
 I do wish this place had a bigger patio. It's a little pricey but worth every penny. This is the best buger that I've had & you will be very satisfied...Can't wait to go back & try some of the other burgers & some wings baby!!  
Happy Munching"}
{"text":"Good atmosphere with great sandwiches!  Try the Porkster!!  It's definitely a one of a kind burger with cheddar and pulled pork on too!  So good!"}
{"text":"Great food, awesome workers! Loved the environment! The best wings I've every had! :)"}
{"text":"I'm really disappointed because I've heard this place be hyped up so many times. I'm sure a good experience can be had here, but we did not have one. 

We got to the restaurant around 8 on a weekday, a little close to closing for me, but it wasn't busy & they took us. We sat & it took about 5ish minutes for someone to come over & take our drink order which is pretty average for me. We took until our server brought the drinks back to order because we were a little indecisive. After we ordered (Know Poblano Burger & Veggie Noogie), the wait began. In total wait time, we sat for close to 55 minutes waiting on our food. The average wait time is usually 23 minutes (and my fiancé being in the business knows places usually push for that). About 40 minutes in, we asked how much longer the food would be (let me say in a really nice tone) and the server just told us when it's ready. I really wanted to leave & just go to Whataburger, but I was trying not to be a jerk. Our drinks didn't get refilled until we had our food on the table. The food wasn't the worst, but I wasn't impressed. The wait time had already created a lackluster experience. The fries were cold on both of our plates, the eggplant on my sandwich was so tough I just ended up removing it, but his burger was fine. 

I don't think I would ever return as a sit down customer, maybe takeout, but that's pretty out of the way for us, so I don't see us driving out there to come home with cold food (especially since we could've gotten cold food there)."}
{"text":"This place is so good! Great service and wonderful food. Definitely coming back for these weekend burgers"}
{"text":"If you want a burger and cold beer, mission accomplished. Awesome burgers. Best in Scottsdale likely. Some unique burgers and sides are awesome too. It's exactly what you want in a burger joint. Love it!"}
{"text":"Best sweet potatoe tots I have had. The PB & J plus bacon burger is infamously delightful."}
{"text":"Little joint with Hawaiian decor, good music, and stiff margaritas. We had great service and the sweet potato tots were good. Burgers and fries were fine, but peppery."}
{"text":"Can we talk about these burgers for a minute?  I love a good burger place and this ranks right at the top of my list now.  They have a very wide selection of unique sounding burgers.  Their burgers come in 2 sizes and the portions are very large.  Thankfully I ordered the smaller size but even at that I couldn't finish my meal.  My husband got the pb and j burger and I had the hangover burger.  Both were awesome, as were the fries and sweet potato tots.  

I love the decor and funky island vibe.  Without a doubt I will be back when in the mood for a bomb burger!"}
{"text":"wow, I don't eat burger much, so not qualified to say this would be the best burger so far.
but based on what I had in the past from other burger places, this one hit the spot as one of the great burger."}
{"text":"Headline: Mac N Cheese is a push up bra for burgers...if you have to use it, you're probably flat.

I have come to believe that if a burger joint needs to add things like Mac N Cheese and Jalapeno Poppers to their burgers, it probably means their burgers just aren't that great. This holds true for Rehab. I went with my parents and we got the Bigger Beefstro, Black & Blue and the Grilled Cheese (odd choice by mom, but I still love her). The bigger Beefstro came oozing out with havarti cheese and shaved rib eye. It was a beautiful site. But once I dug in, I realized that it just was flat. I could barely taste the burger itself and the pablano peppers were no where to be found. The Black & Blue was the same...I would simply describe it as bland. Overall, definitely not worth the hype or the wait. Even though there are cool shops around to help the wait go by pretty quick.

On a positive note, we were all happy with the chili verde appetizer. It came with great chips and was a delicious creamy mix of green chiles and chicken. 

True Rating: 3.4

{"text":"The best burger I've had. They buy there meat daily from a local butcher which means it's never frozen. I had the blue cheese and bacon burger on a pretzel bun cooked rare. Also the customer service was great. They were fast and very friendly. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"By far one of the best burger places I've ever been to. It's not healthy by a long shot but it is amazing. Their sweet potato tots are too die for. The portion sizes are huge and it's very reasonably priced. I would definitely recommend this place to try at least once!"}
{"text":"Well worth the wait.  We arrived on a Saturday at 1:30pm for a group of 7 and we waited over 30 minutes.  Server and overall vibe was enjoyable.  The burger and the speciliteis are really huge."}
{"text":"I've been to the one in Scottsdale and had a pretty good experience, so decided to try this location as it's closer. Burgers and sides are great! Service was pretty awful. I think our server was new as he kept forgetting things and the tables around us seemed to be thinking the same thing. Besides the sub-par service, I was really looking forward to trying the pot brownie dessert and it looks and sounds delicious. It was very disappointing. The brownie tasted like something you'd buy frozen and microwave :/ I wouldn't say that I will never go here again, but don't see myself going out of my way. Definitely worth a visit for some good burgers if you've never been!"}
{"text":"Came in at 11:15 am on a Friday. Started out NOT busy. Within 20 mins., it became quite busy and much noisier. Acoustics contribute to this. I'd say they have a good tasty worthy burger. There are options to satisfy the most finicky burger patron connoisseurs! Served on a very fresh lightly toasted bun. I opted for the regular nicely cut fries. Also, freshly made. You can have the REHAB 10 ozs.! Or, half that size, 5 ozs. (a RELAPSE). They didn't disappoint and the staff is friendly. The young waitress didn't seem all that familiar with their menu, but she was quite pleasant and apologetic for this. Table service was above average. Go when it's not peak hours for better service."}
{"text":"I like everything about this place! From the food, drinks, staff and atmosphere I've never had any complaints. I'm a burger guy and the burgers here are better than most in Scottsdale. This is a tough location and several restaurants have failed here in the past few years. I see this concept staying here for a long time as it's always packed.

Go check this place out!!"}
{"text":"Stopped here 2 nights ago last minute.
Started with a 35 minute wait to get in but was worth it.
Meals are huge - beers are cold and service is good.
Forgot to take pics but had the PBJ & bacon burger - wow. Never thought PB&J would find its place on a burger, but this is definitely a surprise and a little unexpected..
The Hatch and Hangover burgers were quite similar and the sweet potatoes tots were scrumptious.."}
{"text":"We decided to swing by on a HOT Sunday afternoon.  When we walked in, we knew inside was the only option.  Even though they had a nice sized patio with misters, you could tell they would not help on a day like today.

It was a busy day, for sure.  We watched all the burgers being served while waiting and got pretty excited for what was in store for us.  While waiting to be seated, we noticed a long table in the middle of the room.  There were roughly 8-10 empty seats at this table.  So we were naturally wondering why we weren't being seated at this table.  

There was also another couple standing next to us that had finished their meal and waiting inside.  They had commented that it was just too hot outside to wait to pay for the bill.  And the waitress was taking too long to bring their bill.

The hostess let us know our table was now ready (about 10min wait) and seated us.  So we sat down and started going over the drink menu first.  We needed to cool down!

Once our drink order was placed, we couldn't help but notice how hot it was inside the restaurant.  At first, we thought because it was a hot day and we were waiting by the front door.  But now that we were seated, it was just plain hot.

After carefully mulling over the menu, we decided on two burgers... one Turkey burger and one Spicy Mac N Cheese burger.  Both with the sweet potato tater tots.

While waiting for the food, we loved the vibe in the place.  The cool beachy decor, and 90's jammin tunes... all made for a neat chill space to hang in.

The burgers arrived in good time and looked fantastic!  The tots... perfection!  Though, I think it would be nice if they offered the various sauces in a sampler setup, to dip the tots.  Ketchup was the only sauce brought out.

The mac n cheese burger was great.  The trick is to eat all the mac n cheese first.  It's almost like an extra side meal in itself.  The lil hits of Sriracha were a great flavor adder.

The turkey burger was HUGE.  It was fresh n juicy.  Too many places serve something small and dry.  Rehab does a great job avoiding that pitfall.

So in summery, to get up in that 4-5 star range, Rehab should be offering seats when they are available and be cranking up the AC and fans on a hot summer day."}
{"text":"Was visiting from Seattle and Rehab was our first stop. Unfortunately it was a big disappointment for us. the burgers are grossly over rated. mind you we hail from a city that hosts Paseo and Red Mill (in Seattle) and Rehab definitely tasted like much hype about nothing. Also I must say the place is relatively expensive (cashing on their popularity) and are not very kid friendly."}
{"text":"Headed there for lunch today with mouth watering thinking how good it was last time we were in town!"}
{"text":"This is a good place to grab a burger and drinks with friends. The burgers are not the best, but are good. That combined with the cool environment make it a quality joint. We sat at the bar so we could watch the games while eating. Our bartender was attentive, knowledgable and friendly. They have good drinks specials. Also, they have special burgers off menu so be sure to ask about them.

I ordered the PBJ & Bacon Burger. It comes with peanut butter, grape jelly, Sriracha sauce and bacon. The burger meat its self is just ok. The toppings made the burger very good. The flavors combine extremely well together. It is a rich burger with the peanut butter, but well worth it. My only mistake was ordering the 10 ounce burger. The five ounce would have been plenty of food for me.

For my side I chose the Jamaican Corn. It is grilled and then briefly fried. It creates a very interesting texture. The flash fry hit some of the flavors. If I was to go again I would add some sauce at the end to give some of that flavor back."}
{"text":"This place is delicious! My boyfriend had a Hawaiian burger and onion rings and I got s side of fries and the spinach salad with chicken. His burger was cooked perfect, nice and juicy. The French fries were well seasoned and a lot. I like how they already have you a side of ranch. It was perfect. My salad was fresh and delicious. The only tip I would suggest would be to order the dressing on the side. We had this tall waiter and he was on top of us, gave us to go drinks. Just great."}
{"text":"Maybe my review isn't fair because I haven't eaten yet, but it's the first Saturday of March Madness and all tv's are on. Golden State San Antonio NBA game. We have asked several people to switch one tv but were told that there is a table here that will throw a fit if they change the channel. The food needs to be the best ever or I won't come back."}
{"text":"Rehab is reliable and consistent. Great, tenured staff, always delicious food, and the most relaxed, fun atmosphere. Definitely our favorite burger place in Arizona. Try the PB&J burger-- you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Huge fan or their burgers. Can't really go wrong with any of their options and definitely get the onion rings. I also enjoy how friendly their staff is."}
{"text":"Had a good burger here forgot the name but it was quality 
A couple of friends had recommended it 
Im glad They did
Went there for lunch time, enjoyed the service prices were not too bad
Would definitely go back anytime I'm in the area"}
{"text":"Amazingggg. Hands down not only best burgers that are creative, but allll the food is good here. We've had the pasta, chicken wings, calamari, fish tacos and more. All the food has been amazing. 

Recently one of our visits the manager was a little bit of a jerk. It was a Friday night and they were swamped, but still... he came off as very irritated and made us a little uncomfortable. Only complaint we've ever had and only issue with staff yet. Servers are always very nice and helpful. 

If you want some amazing food with a great atmosphere give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Love rehab they are always busy, because it is so good! It's nice and convenient in old town!"}
{"text":"Had a delicious PB & J burger!  Sounds crazy...crazy good!  The atmosphere was fun and the service was great!  I'll be back next time we are in town!"}
{"text":"Bah humbug. I admit this used to be my fav burger joint in Scottsdale. Maybe they had an off night but all of our burgers were just so-so. Fries were nothing great and soggy onion rings. And to top it off, asked for lettuce and tomato on my burger and they served it on the side, not a nice crisp leaf of iceberg but shredded browning wilted lettuce. How somebody let that leave the kitchen to sit on a table. Embarrassing. Let's hope it was a misfire but not sure I will return anytime soon. On a positive note, cheap happy hour beers on draft all night (Thursday in Dec.)"}
{"text":"Amazing burgers, atmosphere! One of my favorite spots in Phoenix hands down!"}
{"text":"I don't know how anyone can give this place a negative review. The burgers were DELICIOUS. The wings were AMAZING. The service was AWESOME. And the atmosphere was SUPER FUN. David was our server and he was just about perfect. We can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Very laid back surfer burger bar.  Enough burger combinations to suit any preference.  The Hatch Chile burger was an awesome pairing of a medium spicy large chile, thick cheddar slice, and cooked to a perfectly requested medium rare 10 oz patty.  Had to resist the fries so I could put it all away."}
{"text":"This was our first time here and it was very good. The place is clean, and mellow. A nice spot to hang out on a patio. Our server Mike was outstanding. We couldn't ask more from him. He was friendly, helpful, informative and suggestive. He got everything right and was always prompt. The food was very good also. We had the tractor pulled pork, and the big beefstro burger. I highly recommend the big beefstro burger!! And the Vidalia onion rings!! Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"You need rehab, admit it, go get rehab.

Worth the wait for a table!  This place is not too big, real casual, friendly and busy.  Started with the Pig Wings.  Sooooo good!  Crisp outside and moist inside.  The sauce was incredible with just enough heat.  Two person portion size.  For a burger I settled on the Spicy Mac-N-Cheese Burger at my son's recommendation.  I was not disappointed.  The homemade Mac with the peppers made the burger explode with flavor.  Very filling.  Go there now."}
{"text":"Fantastic experience with Rehab Burger Therapy from start to finish! 

With lots of work travel and Dude starting a new job, we missed out on holding a get together for his birthday with all the Yelpmigos in July. 

He decided on this joint, so away I went to post a UYE! 

When I saw our guest list hit 21, I was a little concerned about being able to get a reservation on a Friday night in a smaller venue. 

Wiley the owner made it happen and was nothing short of freakin' delightful and pleasant. 

Rehab's team had a space set up for us upon arrival. I loved the stoner and surfer vibe of the place, brought me right back to Santa Cruz, CA. 

David was our one and only server for our massive group, and MAN he ran the show like a boss. Did not miss a beat with the food and drink orders, hilarious guy - and was a hit with my younger sister! 

Which, since she accurately guessed his age (and was underage), guess who got to drink the \"shot prize\"? Thanks, Lolo, for fueling your big sister's night of liver killing! ;) 

As for the food, absolutely delicious. 

Dude ordered the Ghost Burger, which I got to take a bite of. Ghost Peppers, yes, but not so blazing your face hurts. 

I decided to live ridiculously, and ordered the Rehab size (smaller) PB&J Burger after reading Mar L.'s review. Bacon and sriracha also included.

Don't knock it before you try it; this thing was the perfect blend of sweet, salty and savory. 

And totally required a fork and knife. Prepare for ooooeeyy goooey messiness, folks. 

Wasn't too impressed with the fries; immediately regretted not ordering those Sweet PoTOToes! Next trip . . . 

Also, our buddy Joe B. ordered a Reese's Pot Brownie - Which unfortunately wasn't packing actual POT, but came in a giant pot. 

Sweet, melty delicious Reese's all wrapped in a brownie with vanilla ice cream, this one is sure to please. Get it if you have a large group to share! 

Have to comment about the service, we weren't the only large group. There was a group here having a rehearsal dinner, and not once were there any hiccups. 

We had an absolute blast here. Can't wait for my next stint in REHAB! 

Thanks Rehab, Wiley, David and Co for making this a fun night for all!"}
{"text":"It's worth a trip here to experience the burgers.
They are legit serving sizes - I eat a lot and I have trouble with the big burgers here.
I'd actually suggest going smaller burgers on a date or something because you'll be waddling around town afterwards.

It's a nice vibe here as well. Space isn't very big and it's been crowded the times I've gone, so there might be a wait."}
{"text":"Brittany was absolutely amazing! She was so personable, friendly, and attentive- she is an absolute jem! Definitely coming back to see her!"}
{"text":"It's true what they say... Rehab is as good as it gets! I recently dined in for a second time, and just as the first, I was fully satisfied. I don't know what it is, but their food is spot on. The service was really great as well. You'll love this west coast vibe burger joint! A Scottsdale hidden gem, and one of the best burgers in AZ. I will keep coming here for different occasions - lunch, dinner, large groups - you name it and I'm certain they will accommodate.

For my most recent visit, I ordered a turkey burger. SO delicious! I really liked how my server asked if I was enjoying the turkey burger specifically because they can sometimes be a hit or miss with me. Thank you Rehab for another delicious dinner!"}
{"text":"09/26/12

3.5 stars.

For my second visit, I brought Mom, her two sisters, and a cousin along to take advantage of a Yelp deal I bought for Mom.  We couldn't sit at the community table we had enjoyed before, since it was reserved for another party, but we were able to get a five-top by getting two tables next to each other.  The weather was much cooler than on our first visit, so we were comfortable in that aspect; However, the music, which had gone from tropical/surfing sounds to loud contemporary/rap/rock music, so a few of us (at least an aunt and me) were annoyed.

Rehab now offers Four Peaks' Peach ale on tap!  Sheryl (sp?), our friendly and energetic server, informed me that the bar began to serve it this past Saturday-- hurray!!  I'm so happy this has come to pass, since I've only seen this peach ale offered at three other bars/restaurants BESIDES Four Peaks: Tempe's Lucky Break (during a Yelp event held there), Vincitorio's, and Mac's Grill and Bar.  Rehab offers $3 draughts during happy hour!  Be wary of their happy hour food menu pricing though, as they're only $1 off apps...

Since Mom and I had just eaten brunch right before our massage session, we weren't hungry, but I had planned on at least enjoying a half-pint of peach ale or a little bit of wine while my aunts and cousin enjoyed their burgers.  We decided to order the app Sheryl suggested, the Pigs' wings ($9/HH) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/3l54GTr8-E3XPbIxnF_sAA?select=KZrg3VgZMoHE0xJgASMR8Q#KZrg3VgZMoHE0xJgASMR8Q, her favorite, which comes with a peach-habanero BBQ sauce made in-house.  An aunt spied calamari ($6.50/HH) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/3l54GTr8-E3XPbIxnF_sAA?select=Ewn0r0HcfU9xW_7-481BgQ#Ewn0r0HcfU9xW_7-481BgQ on the menu, and since that is also Mom's favorite app, I asked Sheryl to bring some for the table, as well.  Mom and her two sisters decided to split two Rehab-sized burgers (mushroom and swiss, $11, and green chile hatch, $10.50) and their sides of fries and sweet po\"tot\"oes.  My young cousin thought she was ordering a sandwich when she went for the Chile Con Fritos ($8).  Since I had been disappointed with the chocolate milkshake sample we were given on our first visit, I decided I'd take up Ken's offer to try one of their alcoholic versions on this visit.  Ken was absent, however, so I asked bartender John what my options were, and we decided on a vanilla-based liqueur, Frangelico, and Kahlua concoction ($8).   http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/3l54GTr8-E3XPbIxnF_sAA?select=hP3IwyweWGHoAHexT4OhHw#hP3IwyweWGHoAHexT4OhHw

My aunts enjoyed the calamari!  The pigs' wings were also good-- I enjoyed the outer crispiness and the sweet spiciness of the sauce.  I don't think I'd order it again, though, and the same goes for the calamari, which weren't as crispy as I like them to be, plus I wasn't wowed by the \"original marinara.\"  Personally, I'd just concentrate on the burgers.  I waited too long on trying the fries (as I mentioned, I wasn't hungry, and I concentrated on enjoying the sips of peach ale and the milkshake), for they were already soggy.  My aunt had sliced a portion of the hatch green chile burger for me to have, enough for two or three bites, and I still found it very tasty, even though I'd forgotten to add some chipotle aioli.  I don't think cousin enjoyed her Chile con Fritos, which didn't look very appetizing to me (and corn-based Fritos isn't something I can eat any longer) and she, the aunts, and my Mom didn't find the kitchen's idea of using a Fritos bag instead of an aluminum sheet to line the platter amusing.  I thought it showed Rehab's playful side, but you can't please everyone.  Come to think of it, I don't think it's wise to use a bag with so much ink as a liner when food's involved.  Hmm...

Last, but not least, the milkshake, which was much thicker, and that's a very good thing!  I enjoyed the first few sips, but the sweetness started to get too cloying by the mid-mark, and that's with all of us sampling.  I would only order this if I could share it with one or more people, and if I were to crave for alcoholic ice cream, I'll just head over to Lee's Cream Liquors!  :))

Props again to the management/owners on stocking up on Four Peaks Peach ale.  It's nice to patronize local bars/eateries local-based beverages and food!"}
{"text":"Probably the best burgers we've had since we've moved to this area.
The atmosphere is totally casual. It's comfortable, The staff was friendly. The burger options are plentiful, including (of course) a make your own.
I should have done this review at the time, it was a VERY stressful day for us and I can't remember what we had. I know we each had burgers, we were each happy (and they were cooked PERFECTLY). He had the sweet potato tots (which he enjoyed) and I had their fries (also yummy). Unfortunately, that's all I remember. But trust me when I tell you that we liked our burgers. We commented on it a few times during the meal."}
{"text":"Rehab Burger Therapy is a nice little restaurant ran by locals. All staff are very nice and food was excellent! This is definitely going on my list of quick, good food!"}
{"text":"Holy cow, literally! One of the best bacon cheeseburger I have had. I don't know if it was the bacon, the burger, the pretzel bun or just the combo. Mmmmm.

Portions are very large as described in other reviews and photos. No kids menu but my little ones shared a hotdog and fries and left very full. My other daughter had the pasta alfredo and said its the best she has ever had. Even said it was better than olive gardens which is HUGE for her. 

Not a lot of parking up front but a parking lot next door. The restuarant itself was smaller. We got there around 5:30 pm on a Tuesday and it was already busy. Luckily we didnt have to wait but if we had arrived 20 minutes later we would have been waiting awhile. We almost didn't come here because another yelper said it wasn't that kid friendly due to sitting. Sitting is rough and I would partially agree with not being kid friendly but defitinely somewhere you can take your kids if they can sit still. 

You can get 7% cash back and $3.99 chips and salsa for checking in. 

Staff was also super friendly and can handle a big crowd. 

Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Love Rehab Burger.  Great atmosphere, service with a smile.  Love their fish tacos, and the peanut butter/jelly bacon burger is unbelievable.  Beers are super cold, great prices.  Get a seat on the patio and people watch.  Enjoy"}
{"text":"Really great burgers. Fresh buns. Great service. I prefer this location over Scottsdale. I had the hatch Chile burger. You have to get it. Sitting on the patio was the best."}
{"text":"Pretty good burgers. Their influence from Oregano's is clear. Good food, fair price.  Limited seating We have been here several times.  One block off of Scottsdale Road.  Fresh bread makes the burgers good.  Many toppings available from cheese to peanut butter!"}
{"text":"Rehab is a little gem that's big on flavor. I have been here a couple of times and have always had great good and a good experience. I think the staff is very nice and tremendously accommodating. 

My husband thinks the peanut butter and jelly burger is the bomb, he often talks about it in his sleep. I prefer the veggie burger and really appreciate that Rehab extended the menu to include many vegetarian items. The portions are huge... as in gargantuan. You can easily split a burger and be a happy camper.  

Go here, it's totally worth it."}
{"text":"First off , the service . Fantastic. Everyone was so accommodating . Drink were refilled without EVER asking . Straight up, Lo rocks ! She was our server and she's on point ! She was on top of EVERYTHING . When we ordered she helped with the choices .Kudos to her..so laid back and in the cut , even though the place was busy we felt like the ONLY table.  

That's just the beginning. The food , wow ! I get it - it's bar food ,but wayyyyyyyy better ! The Pig Wings , dear lord - fantastic ! I'm a complete wing snob admittedly and these were unbelievable. The crispness ,the flavor ,the size ,the sauce(sweet with a little heat) ...absolutely great ! Next time I'll try the regular wings . 

The main meal was Pescado Borracho and Poblano burger. Both were fantastic ! The choice of condiments, pickle and sides were plentiful . The food was ALL at perfect temperature. you can smell and taste the beer with the fish dish . The tartar sauce was a perfect compliment . Also , the portions...hell yeah !! BIG portions , no filler -all killer . $40 and a little change was the bill . COMPLETELY worth it ."}
{"text":"Burger joint in the heart of Old Town with a surfing theme.

I don't eat red meat or pork so I'm always search of a good turkey burger and Rehab did not disappoint.

The menu is pretty extensive and offers everything from your basic fries and sweet potato tots to clams to wings to beef burgers to fish and chicken burgers.

When I'm starving, my eyes are often bigger than my stomach so I opted for a side salad, half order of buffalo wings, and turkey burger with cheddar on a wheat bun. 

The salad was made with mixed greens and tasted really good.  

I had the wings cooked extra crispy and they came out perfectly.  They were cooked in a buffalo sauce that had really good flavor.  It had little pieces of garlic mixed in the sauce.  So far, these are definitely the best wings I've tasted in Scottsdale.  

The turkey burger consisted of a really good size patty that was super juicy (uncharacteristic for turkey burgers).  It was definitely the best turkey burger I've had in Scottsdale.

If you are search of a nice, tasty burger joint with a beachy, hipster vibe, then look no further.

Definitely check out this place!"}
{"text":"Wow, this place is awesome. The burgers were incredible and the waitstaff was funny and engaging. A definite must stop if you are in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"This place is great! Decided to go here on a whim when family was in town and was not disappointed. I had the \"Hangover Burger\" (the one with the fried egg) and it was delicious. Had the sweet potato tater tots as well and couldn't stop eating them! Great atmosphere and fun environment for all ages. Even if you don't like burgers, there's something for everyone. The kids got quesadillas and enjoyed them as well. The Long Island iced teas were spot on, and our waitress Kaye was super attentive and friendly. Her hair flip wasn't too bad either.  I will definitely be coming back here and can only hope they expand to chandler and tempe as well. My one recommendation would be to put the Long Island iced teas in the bigger water glasses. Ha ha. But seriously, check this place out!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice before and every time I've received top level customer service whether they were slammed with people lined up out the door or just wandering in and getting seated immediately. Yesterday I came in a little early thinking there might be a wait considering it would be what peak happy hour is (happy hour is all day Thursday!) But instead I was sat immediately, the waitress was so nice and brought me some water while I looked over the menu for a drink. I chose their New Belgium seasonal IPA which wasn't bad for an IPA but I can feel really hit or miss on IPAS, I drank about half of it before asking for a blue moon instead - defeated by feeling adventurous. Never once did she rush when my friend was late, when it took us forever to order as we were catching up, and she was nothing but patient and accommodating the entire time - I was impressed because we definitely sat there twice as long as the other patrons. I ordered the Hawaiian barbecue burger, rare, with the tator tots. Everything was PERFECT. Burger rode the line of rare and raw but honestly I can't even complain about that because there is nothing to me more annoying than ordering a burger rare and getting it medium well at best - kudos guys! She made sure our drinks were thoroughly filled throughout the entire experience and when the check came I was shocked to see she hadn't charged me for the IPA! I was definitely planning on paying for it considering I had drank just about half but that little detail was nice and it was even nicer to see that a year between both visits no amount of customer service, quality or value was lacking. Simply impressive!"}
{"text":"Best Burger this side of anywhere!  Love, love, love this place except of course for the wait.  This time we went late, they were near closing yet staff did not seem worn out as one might expect after a busy Saturday night.  The food is consistently good and menu is so diverse, definitely not a boring, lackluster burger joint, just the opposite! We live a bit far from establishment which is a bit of a blessing in disguise due potential waistline damage from temptation of too frequent visits!"}
{"text":"I remembered why I quit coming here just now.  Food has always been great, this is my third time with terrible service here.  I wish I could say I was able to enjoy the food this time but after waiting 8 mins to get acknowledged by an employee( over 4 employees walked by and looked at me didn't say a word) I decided to just sit my self hoping a server would acknowledge me.  The server came up 4 mins later telling me I couldn't sit there and that there was a wait with 4 open tables in restaurant. The only wait was 2 people that were waiting behind me and never sat down. Once I asked for a manager they said I was fine to sit and she would return for my drink order.  8 MINUTES goes by and not one single employee comes to ask if we want a drink.  I WILL NEVER RETURN TO THIS ESTABLISHMENT AGAIN. I can understand if it is busy but it was a Wednesday night with multiple open tables everywhere and no SPORTS playing.  I am 100% about customer service and this is the third time in a row I have had terrible service."}
{"text":"Rehab is one of the best burger establishments in Maricopa County.

I ordered some type of cheeseburger with thousand island dressing.  It was extremely messy and difficult to eat due to the thickly sliced pickles, but cutting it up made it easier to handle.

Some little sweet potato tots came with my burger and I also ordered a side of onion rings.

The onion rings were in my top 5.  No complaints there.  They automatically bring you ketchup, ranch, and a chipotle sauce for dipping.  Way to be on the ball, Rehab.

The sweet potato tots came with a yummy pineapple concoction for dipping.  It was good at first, but quickly became too sweet and I had to abandon it for the ranch and ketchup.

Everything was really good.  I would definitely go back.

Even their female employees were easy on the eyes.  Apparently, they are allowed to wear tight, revealing clothing to work.  Again, no complaints there.

In sum, go to Rehab if you like cute girls and awesome burgers."}
{"text":"One of my fave places to come get a burger, tots and enjoy happy hour.  

I waited quite a while to write a review though.  As an Old Town local, I've seen many restaurants come and go.  Way too many actually.  

But I waited because the same thing always happens.  When I find a great place, I need to keep it a secret because when I come back, it's bombarded with patrons and I can't get the same experience I had before everyone else found out.  

Honestly, I don't like crowded places.  I like to enjoy the experience and relax.  

Only 4 starts because I really like the food & the atmosphere, but the place gets too crowded.  The patrons are squeezed in so tightly that I feel like we're all dining together.  Not cool when other customers can breathe on the food you're eating."}
{"text":"Rehab Burger Therapy? 

I may Need to go to rehab soon because this place could get Addicting. 

Sitting there among the hanging cruiser bikes and surfboards, it feels like you've left Scottsdale and entered a beach bar somewhere. The atmosphere is laid back without sacrificing service. The staff is quick and friendly. Their efficiency was impressive.

I ordered the 5 oz. Backyard BBQ burger. It's stacked with two big, delicious onion rings, Colby jack cheese and loaded with bbq sauce (almost too much sauce, if there is such a thing). 

The fries were fresh, and crispy. The pickle spear that comes with the burger is no slouch either. It's not a limpy, weak pickle spear. It's stout and crunchy. Yup... I just complimented a pickle. 

If I knew therapy could be this good, I'd have gone years ago."}
{"text":"First time eating there! Great food and service! Cold beer! We had a MacGnarlyRehab Burger! It was awesome ! Fries and onions rings! Can't wait to go back!great atmosphere! Fun place and busy!!!"}
{"text":"OMG.  there food is outrageously wonderful!  Its not just burgers.  you can replace the burger with Turkey meat or chicken.  A Must go to place.  The service is great.  everyone is friendly."}
{"text":"Wouldn't have known about this place without Yelp. Thanks guys!

Interesting restaurant, with a sort of Island/surfer attitude. The burgers were great, although my Hangover had a bit too much Hatch chile--it dominated the flavor of the burger, so it would've been nice to cut it up into slices rather than a huge layer. The fries were awesome (especially the dipping sauces). Best burger I've had in Arizona."}
{"text":"Nice place in Tempe just off the beaten path of mill ave. Burgers are good and staff is friendly. Walked in 15 min before kitchen closed and still got great service and a fast turn around on my order. Not a lot of the college crowd so you can actually hear yourself think"}
{"text":"I feel awful that it took me this long to update my review, I'm sorry Wiley! Rehab Burger is now one of my favorite spots to grab a great burger, and a cold beer! The staff is always nice and funny, the music makes you feel like you're on the beach in Cali, and the food.... Well the food is awesome! I love the Mac Gnarly burger as well as the PB&J burger! Check it out, you won't be disappointed! Oh, be sure to start out with the Pig Wings!!"}
{"text":"Ahhhh, the burger craze. New burger joints seem to be popping up on every corner and at some point the beef frenzy will subside and we'll be left with empty restaurants. However, I think Rehab has staying power that would even keep Linsey Lohan here!  The patty and condiment combinations aren't that unique but the ingredients are fresh and the sauces are good enough to eat with a spoon. In fact, I really think it is the sauces that make the burgers here. I ordered a classic cheddar cheese burger which I know sounds boring but it was a great choice as it highlighted the yumminess of the chipotle aioli sauce. As many other reviewers have said, the \"sweet poTOTatos\" (sweet potato tater tots) are good but for me, it was once again the sauce, this time the pineapple teriyaki that made the dish.

This rehab center has patio seating complete with a zillion umbrellas, fans and misters. But vampires need not worry, as there is a great interior too that is dim and cool. Also, despite being a super casual place, the bathrooms were neat and nice."}
{"text":"This place absolutely rocks!  Great, friendly service and phenomenal burgers.  Can't ask for much more."}
{"text":"For a quick snack before going to the Tour de Fat, my son and I stopped here. 
We didn't get any burgers, though all of the ones and the rest of the food I saw looked very good. I'll probably go back to try one.
Instead we had a couple of beers and the Calamari app. Being strips I was hoping for some thick cut, lightly bread, tender morsels. Instead we got thin short pieces, heavily breaded and very over cooked. Include a Marinara sauce that is so thick it's takes a spoon to dig it out of the bowl, and you've got meal frustration galore.
We ended up asking for some Ranch and Blue Cheese dressing instead which help a great deal. Though to be very honest, a spicy thinner sauce, like a Thai Chili or even a good Salsa would have been much better.
The server was great though she took her time getting to us and checking on us as we ate.
If you go, try a Burger. They looked like the best option for something satisfying."}
{"text":"my husband and I found this on accident and now take anyone that comes to visit us! I also let my clients at work know about it, it reminds me of my home-state,California and the burgers are delicious! you taste the quality in the meat."}
{"text":"I just went here tonight for the first time! I ordered the hangover burger and medium wings! Everything was so good! The staff was really nice as well! They have so many cool burgers on the menu!"}
{"text":"Sometimes the food I have here is 5 stars worthy, sometimes not as much. I really think it depends on the day but overall good burger experience. They have unique combos."}
{"text":"I was super excited to check this place out thanks to their creative list of burgers with crazy toppings. Our service was fine and food quality was fine, but it was mostly just that - fine. The burgers and toppings were average. The fries were average. I'd say the most fun I had was with their sauces! The sweet potato tots tasted great with all three that I tried (pesto mayo, teriyaki and chipotle ranch). 

Again, definitely not a bad place at all. It was laid back and is probably a great place to meet friends"}
{"text":"Amazing burgers reasonable prices.   I finally find a great place to get a burger in old town.  Go here a try this place out you will thank me."}
{"text":"Sharyl waited on us and she was friendly and professional. Ordered blue cheese and bacon burger and my hubby ordered the special burger with tortilla bread and he was very satisfied. Will come to try different yummy looking food."}
{"text":"I must be a traditional burger kind of guy because this place really was just \"OK\" to me. If you're the type that likes a regular burger, this burger joint might not be the best for you. It didn't really stand out as amazing or wow, but I have to say that I would gladly recommend it to those who enjoy the new style of New American foods. The party I went with really enjoyed their PB&J burger so I'll go ahead and recommend that if you're into that kind of stuff."}
{"text":"Gluten-Free Veggie Noogie with Sweet poTOToes - Yes Please!!!

It was amazing and Ill be taking my foodie sister and brother in law here pronto!!! 

Make sure to sit in Nic's section....superb service!!!"}
{"text":"This place made me feel like I was in a surf shack joint in Hawaii. It was a really fun laid-back, casual restaurant.

My burger was great and those sweet potato tots with the sweet pineapple sauce were the best!"}
{"text":"The sweet potato tots are to die for!! And my boyfriend got the mac n cheese burger which was amazing. Next time I want to try the PBJ and bacon burger!"}
{"text":"Been to this awesome burger joint in Old Town a number of times now. Never a bad time here. Food, service and atmosphere is always awesome. 

There is a wait to get a table from time to time, it's worth it. The bar topically has open seating. Both fries and tots are awesome, put wings are great and as always, the burgers rock."}
{"text":"Sweet lord order the pig wings now......(did you do it yet?) .... you get a pound of pig knuckles (like little ribs) with a little bark on the outside and crazy tender on the inside, saturated with an amazing homemade spicy pineapple BBQ sauce. You'll want this sauce on everything! We were lucky enough to have sat down next to one of the chefs at the bar, a super nice gentleman who suggested what I should order and I did not fail to take his advice. I got the PBJ and Bacon Burger which the menu said \"will freak your mouth out with a ridiculously delicious flavor combination\"........ the menu was right! Bacon, grape jelly, sriracha sauce and this amazing homemade peanut butter somehow combine to form a flavor nirvana. I paired this with their sweet potato tater tots which were dusted in some kind of brown sugar love. Yummers! At this point if your hangover is not fully cured, you have to try the toasted s'more milkshake made with dutch chocolate and toasted almond vodka. Next time I'm going to try the spa treated clams and the Jamaican Corn."}
{"text":"The service was a bit slow waited with empty glasses to get a refill for approximately 30 minuets. We knew they were new and working out the kinks. We waited about 45 minutes for our meal to arrive. The Burger I received the wrong burger topping and cooked rare, when I ordered well done. The waitress was very pleasant apologizing and exchanged it immediately. I thanked her she explained that it should not take long the kitchen was going to fix it. I thanked her and waited patiently why it was corrected. A Female manager came over pointed her finger in my face and said \"was it you?\" I asked her excuse me? You did you have the wrong burger? I said yes. \"she stated well I guess I can comp it\" we stated  she didn't have to do that, It was  was being corrected. We just hoped it didn't take another 45 min apparently this upset her, she turned away very abrupt walked away from the table. Several minutes later The Manager/owner of the establishment asked us how everything was. He asked about my order being incorrect and I started to explain, he immediately got on the defense cutting me off stating they have only been open 5 days. I said I understood but was just giving constructive criticism. I pointed to my drink and said there was no salt on the rim of my second drink. (No biggie but he was asking) The manager immediately got on the defense and started talking very nasty to myself and my husband. I told him I was giving him positive feed back so he could be successful in this heavily saturated area where everyone sells burgers. He stated he grew up in this neighborhood and this is a very successful Business. He took a step back from the table and told us to \"GET THE FUCK OUT OF HIS RESTAURANT\" I asked if he was serious when he yelled again to \"GET THE FUCK OUT\" so we exited the restaurant. He followed us out into the parking lot yelling that we didn't pay for our food, and we should be proud that we were the first to get 86ed, and if we ever return he will call the police. 

The one bite of my corrected burger wasn't enough to make a decision on the quality of the food"}
{"text":"Went to Rehab this past Sunday around 6PM and it was PACKED! I'd been a few years back and I know the burgers were very good so when my friend told me he wanted to try for his first time I was totally IN!  When we arrived we were advised of the 35 minute wait and waited with no problem. The host was a bit snippy so I didn't really appreciate that but I let it go since he was probably overwhelmed. Once we were eventually seated I ordered the Yelp special chips and salsa right away and they took forever to come. Once they arrived we ordered our burgers since the server was often gone for long periods of time. Don't get me wrong, she was extremely nice and efficient I just feel she was too busy. They should've had more servers IMO. Anyway.. the chips and salsa were very good.  Chips tasted fresh and home made and the salsa is as mild and flavorful. I ordered the hatch burger and my friend ordered the backyard BBQ burger. Both were phenomenal and the small side of onion rings set it over the top. All in all it was a great ambiance and very good food. 4 stars for the snippy host and the Fact we had to stay there for 3 hours because the server hardly came around :/."}
{"text":"Short and sweet. Passing through and found this place on Yelp. Friendly service but don't look for fast. I had the rehab sized Know Poblano burger - 10oz on a brioche bun with sweet potato tots. The burger was huge! I was super hungry and barely finished the burger and only ate 1/3 of the tots! The manchego cheese paired nicely with the roasted poblano and beef. The 10 oz patty was lean and flavorful! It was a really good burger. The tots were average. They served it with a side of a chipotle aioli that was decent. I only used a tiny bit, in full disclosure! 
I sat outside on a beautiful evening so all in all a good experience. I'd come back. Knocked off a star for attentiveness and the average sweet potato tots. Burger is a stand up 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Nice place, if small and loud at times. Patio is nice in the winter, bar is always good. Staff has been great every time I've been in and more than willing to offer advice on the menu items...even suggesting items off-menu now and again.

Burgers are all pretty solid. I've tried a few, mostly on the spicy side, and none were all that spicy that they would scare away the average consumer. I would have liked a little more kick, but I can always add to it.

Tots are great. Other sides have always turned out well and their complement of dipping sauces are really nice.

Definitely worth a visit or two."}
{"text":"The burgers here are a1 and the hot wings are just as delicious! My first time in I decided to sit at the bar. David was my bartender and he's the only reason I go back!!! Takes excellent care of you and will recommend his favorite meals. Cool atmosphere and amazing food."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. I just wish I could go more often!!! There is a lot of fancy burger joints popping up, all over Phoenix and Scottsdale. Place is hip, clean and the burgers are down right delicious. I always order my burgers medium rare, only hoping that it will at least come out medium. But as always it will come out just perfect. I love bacon & blue cheese, but I need to expand my horizons!!! Can't wait to make this a regular spot, especially with my hot wife."}
{"text":"It's my son's birthday and he wanted a great but unconventional burger. The Peanut Butter, Jelly and Bacon is the top seller. If it wasn't for Serena's awesome customer service he wouldn't have been open to it. He loved it! We all loved what we chose."}
{"text":"It was a rainy Sunday and you can say we were craving some good old burgers and fries. What we discovered was the good, the burgers, and not so old food. Let me explain! We had some NEW...creative style burgers...the Hawaiian and the Hatch burger (Relapse). Both were delicious. Robin, our waitress, is awesome. She brought us extra sauces so we can try them as it was our first time there. Although her recommendation to get the mix strawberry/chocolate milkshake didn't quite turn out as well (can't blame her...we were imagining a chocolate covered strawberry mix), she was a good sport. Robin offered to get us a new one or to try their Pot Brownie without us even asking. She definitely went above and beyond. 

Go!! Great service...good food...prepare to have a food baby o.O!!! AWK"}
{"text":"Excellent first time visit.  Cold beer and fresh onion rings, can't go wrong.  Thanks Rian and \"Serious Mike\"!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars

It's still one of the best burgers in Arizona, but after going back to the East Coast, I've realized it's average in the burger world.

We tried the Bacon blue burger and Hawaiian burger. Our medium rare burgers were a little over cooked and not as juicy as we had remembered it. The toppings were pretty good but the meat lacks flavor. 

Service was fast and friendly, and the wait wasn't as long as estimated."}

{"text":"Great selection of burgers. Mac and cheese or fries are amazing. Huge portions so should probably order accordingly"}
{"text":"If they tried to make me go to Rehab Burger I might say Yes Yes Yes! I actually tried to go to the Scottsdale location a few months back but the wait to get a table was so long that we decided to eat somewhere else. We were in the area and saw that the Tempe location had just opened so we figured we should check it out!

The location is a bit hidden, right next to the Brickyard garage exit off of 6th Street. There is outdoor and indoor seating and in the winter they have heaters out if you do decide to eat on the patio. It was fairly busy when we came here on Saturday in the afternoon but we were able to get a seat with no wait. 

The menu has an extensive selection of burgers and drinks. They have a daily happy hour from 11-6 which includes discounted drinks. Every burger can be made into a 5 oz relapse size or 10 oz rehab size, and there are multiple protein options, such as beef, turkey, and veggie patty. Feeling in a spicy mood, I opted for the ghost burger, labeled as such due to the inclusion of ghost pepper cheese. I tried some of the chili cheeseburger as well.

Since it was pretty busy it took some time for our orders to get out to our table. Service was good though as we were waiting and drinks were refilled as needed. The plates were impressive looking. The execution though left something to be desired. Our burgers were supposed to be medium rare but came out more like medium to medium well. The burger itself had a dense tough texture, not very juicy, and didn't have a lot of flavor in it aside from a faint taste of char from the grill. I did enjoy the guacamole but the cheese wasn't fully melted in the center of the burger and had a slight grainy texture. The ghost pepper in it was actually not too spicy. I'd say it was about the spiciness of a jalapeno. The pretzel bun was decent but I didn't really enjoy it with my particular burger. 

The chili cheeseburger was admirably smothered in a large amount of chili. The taste itself was OK, nothing spectacular, and I had the same problem with the beef patty being too densely brick-like in texture and lacking in flavor.

The fries were light and crisp, dusted with some seasoned salt and very plentiful.

Since it was so busy they seemed a bit rushed for us to finish and get our table cleared. Everyone here though was friendly and attentive.

I'll give them another try; maybe another type of burger will taste better."}
{"text":"This was my second time trying Rehab burger but at a different location (The first was the newer Tempe restaurant). We had a 15-20 minute wait which wasn't bad at all. We had actually tried to go here months earlier but there was a two hour wait so we went somewhere else. We browsed around the pawn shop next door to kill time and came back in about 20 minutes. Timing was perfect because they were just finishing up cleaning our table. 

The check in offer on Yelp is for discounted chips and salsa ($3.99), the regular price is $5.50. We decided to forgo the offer since it was just a discounted price and go straight for the burgers! I forgot how many different choices there are on the menu, so many of them sounded good it was hard to decide. Finally, I spied the word Hatch chile... I can't resist anything with Hatch chile in it! The smaller 5 oz size automatically comes on a beef patty unless specified differently but if you get the 10 oz size you can get a different patty. I also spied beef chorizo patty... Chorizo and Hatch chile, what a perfect combo! Our server recommended the pretzel bun and anything up to medium for the doneness of the burger, so I went with the pretzel bun and medium rare patty. You also have a choice of sweet potato tots or fries but can upgrade to chili fries for an extra fee (I got the tots).

It took quite some time for our burgers to be made. I got hungrier and hungrier and the din from the other customers seemed to increase in volume as it got busier. Finally... our burgers arrived! Mine was piping hot with a generous serving of sweet potato tots. Biting into the burger, I liked the pretzel bun and the cheese was nicely melted over the patty. The actual patty was disappointing though. It had a very mild chorizo flavor and was like eating a hockey puck it was so overdone. I pulled back the bun and noticed the chile wasn't your typical Hatch chile color and was a very very dark green instead of light to medium green. It also didn't have the same flavor and texture as a Hatch chile...perhaps they pulled a switcheroo on me and used a Poblano instead? 

I liked the sweet potato tots which had a soft sweetness with lightly crisp exterior. They did taste more sweet than your usual sweet potato though... Perhaps they mix in a generous amount of sugar in the sweet potato mixture?

My burger was $11 and I felt it was very overpriced for what I got. I haven't been really that impressed with their burgers so I suppose there's no need for me to go into burger rehab for Rehab Burger!

2.5/5"}
{"text":"Ok.. So let me tell you first before you get the wrong idea because I put 3 stars. It has nothing to do with the food. They may just have the best burgers I have EVER tasted!!! This is my second time coming to this restaurant. The first time I waited about 35 min to be seated. Which was annoying but! I stayed because with that long of a wait, it must've meant the food was good. I gave it 3 stars because of the wait the first time and the 2nd time was the service! Service first time was great! The guy at the bar was awesome! But the 2nd time of me going I feel like within the first 2-3 minutes I should be addressed. Asked for a drink, or acknowledged at least! And I wasn't. I waited about 8 minutes before someone came to my table. And didn't get a \"sorry for the wait\". It was just like... Ok what can I get you.. And even more bothersome, the couple that came in and sat next to me was addressed immediately.. Hmmm. But she did have a different waiter. Other than that. I would give 5 stars. Food is excellent!!"}
{"text":"We stopped in on a whim while visiting old town Scottsdale and were very pleasantly surprised.  The burger was excellent!  The place was packed, even on a Saturday late afternoon, so the service was a bit slow, but the staff was friendly when we did interact with them. If you are a burger aficionado, and I would definitely suggest a visit if you are in the area."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I shared a Popper Burger and Spinach salad.  It was one of the best burgers I have ever had.  The fries were good - but the burger was outstanding.  The salad was also top notch.

It was crowded so we had to sit at the bar - but that ended up being OK.

The burger was perfectly cooked (medium) and loaded with cream cheese.  Melted cheddar on top of that.  Deep fried jalapenos on top of that.  It was loaded and luscious.  

The salad was huge - plenty of strawberries, goat cheese and pecans.  I wish I lived in Scottsdale because I would definitely return."}

{"text":"One of the places I miss in Scottsdale. Very good burgers, typically friendly service."}
{"text":"Best burgers in town. Hangover Burger is the ultimate, only burger I ever order.  They once made me try the PB&J burger, sounds weird but it's strangely amazing. They spoiled me on getting burgers. Everywhere else I go the burgers just don't compare. I stopped ordering burgers everywhere else because they just disappoint me & make me wish I would have just gone to Rehab."}

B. Great service from Megan.
C. Fun atmosphere inside and on the patio.
D. Kilt LIfter draft beer was perfect !"}
{"text":"My Regional manager loves burgers and was pretty faithful to Culinary Dropout whenever he was in town. I pleaded him to venture out and took him to Rehab. Our waitress suggested the PBJ and after some convincing, we decided on that and the Blue Cheese. My manager took a bite of his half of the PBJ and I asked him how it was... Silence. He continued to eat his half and then stared at my half. He said it was the most mind blowing experience he'd ever had. I took a bite into my half and immediately knew what he was talking about. It is definitely unexpected. The mixture of creamy, sweet and spicy....there are no words!"}
{"text":"This is the second time I've been to Rehab Burger and it never disappoints. Great food, I went untraditional this time and had the BLT. Outstanding with sweet potato totes. Only reason I gave 4 out of 5 stars is waitress was a little disconnected, she seemed a little overwhelmed so her service suffered. But definitely should be on your must try list."}
{"text":"It's been a while since I have eaten here, but I thought I should review it anyway. 

We started with the chips & salsa. Nothing special, just wanted something to munch. I wouldn't recommend getting them. For our meals, I had the Jalapeno Popper Burger and my boyfriend had the Spicy Mac-N-Cheese Burger. The star of each burger is in the name: jalapeno poppers and mac-n-cheese, respectively. I loved the creamy texture of the cream cheese in the burger. For obvious reasons, my boyfriend loved the mac-n-cheese burger (there's also bacon). Both were a good size. I don't remember the fries being remarkable. The real star of the show is the creative burger.  

Good burger place. Worth trying out if you don't mind the heartburn afterwards."}
{"text":"I was worried a bit when they opened this location hat it wouldn't live up to the reputation and. Quality of the old town Scottsdale location but I must admit I was very wrong. As a matter of fact I thought this location was better! I was with a group of three and we arrived at around 12pm for lunch and got seated right away. Service was prompt and our waiter suggested and brought out multiple dipping sauces for our fries and sweet potato tots, DELICIOUS!! I recommend getting a burger your first trip, more specifically the rehab size!"}
{"text":"Great place! Obviously all the burgers are top notch. The Rehab burger is over a half pound of juicy deliciousness. You can also get a half size burger thst is still plenty big.  They cook the burgers the way you order them. Too many places ask how you want your burger cooked than completely ignore your choice. Plenty of non burger choices too, delicious salads, yummy sandwiches and wonderful pastas. Awesome milkshakes, fries, sweet potato tots and pig wings (just try it). Great drink specials and happy hour for the cocktail and beer drinkers. Last but not least is a friendly and knowledgeable staff eager to please. Run, don't walk over to Rehab today!"}
{"text":"I was in Phoenix on vacation and came across this place online. The atmosphere was cool. The bacon cheeseburger was good, buffalo wings were average. My issues were that it took almost 45 minutes for my burger and my server seemed to be more interested in socializing with other patrons that he knew. Another server ended giving me a to-go box and taking care of the check. Overall I's say my experience was average."}
{"text":"Great happy hour times. The service was off the charts and the burgers are excellent! I had the hangover burger which had bacon and eggs and other good stuff. The burger was cooked to perfection. I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Recommended by a friend and this place did not disappoint. I got the fish sandwich and it was delicious!! It was a huge portion and I got it with their sweet potato fries. It also came with a few sauces for dipping. My husband got the rehab burger and he liked it. He said it was a good version of a burger and very filling. 

My only negative was the lemonade. It had a real funky aftertaste. Maybe it was the plastic cup it came in but not sure..

We came early on a Tuesday afternoon and was seated right away but it fills up quick. When we left, there was a huge crowd out the door. We sat at the outdoor patio and it was a nice lunch. I would definitely recommend if you are in the Old Town Scottsdale Area."}
{"text":"This is a super fun burger joint with great burgers! There is a burger for everyone here. Atmosphere is cool too. Great location and easy parking with great service. I will be returning."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place. The burger was \"OK\" but definitely not worth the hype. The sweet potato \"fries\" are basically mushy tator tots."}
{"text":"So glad we didn't go for the Rehab (10oz). Relapse (5 oz) was wayyyy more than enough for our two day worth of caloric needs. $2 more to double the size of beef patty sounded really appealing. But your arteries and waistline would thank you. 

My husband and I almost made the mistake of not accounting the crazy amount of toppings and sides included in our burgers. The nacho taco burger had enough taco meats to make at least two tacos. My beefbistro had enough rib eye to make another hearty sandwich. Topped with ooey gooey cheese, oozing condiments/sauces - we struggled to even lift our burgers. And who could forget the sweet poTOToes - stuffed to my the brim from the burger alone, I couldn't leave these sinful, bites sized treats alone. \"They are small, I'm sure my stomach has room for one more\". 

You honestly can't go wrong with any of the options. Very fun combinations, explosive flavors. Wished we have a Rehab back in LA for us to try more of the burgers!"}
{"text":"Pretty great spot for a burger. I had a chicken burger with sweet potato tots and I went to watch the game which was filled with big screens. Such a laid back atmosphere."}
{"text":"Incredibly pleased. Prior to coming here I thought, it's just another gourmet hamburger place, boy was I wrong .Allow me to paraphrase my visit.
Snappy, knowledgeable staff, and a menu that is so awesome for so many reasons. Let me just say this, we all know there are lots of great choices available in this part of Scottsdale, but mark my words you will be impressed and will walk away saying to yourself \" that was just a great experience\" I will defiantly return. Your place shines brightly! Good job."}
{"text":"One word \"AMAZING\".....read a lot reviews and they live up to the hype. I had the hangover with sweet potato tots and it did not disappoint. I will definitely be back to try the PB&J burger. My wife had the Mac and cheese burger with green chili which was a dream burger."}
{"text":"Awesome burger!  Had the Jalapeño popper burger.  Great flavor definitely worth revising on a future trip.  Service was great and the staff friendly.  Was also good for the kids!"}
{"text":"This place is great! Compared to their Old Town location, this one feels bigger and more open. The vibe is pretty relaxed which is nice. I've yet to have a burger that I didn't like from Rehab. I also highly recommend their fries. So much flavor!

Definitely a place I will come back to."}
{"text":"When we travel, we want to hit up a highly rated pizza place and a highly rated burger place wherever we go.  The reviews and the menu for Rehab looked solid, so we went, and the only conclusion I can come to is that there are a lot of really crappy burger places in Scottsdale.

The food was passable.  The patties were fine and cooked correctly but unremarkable, and the toppings were varied and included some interesting choices.  The potatoes (sweet potato tots and regular fries) were more of the same.  Not bad, but nothing terribly interesting.

But the service.  My God, the service.  I don't know that I can remember all of the things that went wrong, but I can assure you this stands out in my mind as one of the top three worst service experiences I can ever remember having.  We were seated for about 10 minutes before anyone came by to say hi.  We had some salads and burgers and we were here for over an hour.  This is not a fine dining establishment, and we were not loitering.  My burger came out with no fries.  Nothing, just a burger on a plate, and no one thought \"Hey, that looks funny.\"

And it wasn't just us!  The couple seated next to us sat down about 15 minutes after we did.  They probably sat for 15 minutes before anyone came to take their orders.  They got a couple beers about 15 minutes later, and by the time we left, they STILL had no food in front of them!  We told our waiter when we left that these poor people had been completely ignored all night, and we hoped that would maybe get some attention to them.  For all I know, they're still sitting there silently, waiting for someone to give them some food.

The food was fine, but not in a million years would I come back here to be disrespected and ignored just to have a burger and fries."}
{"text":"This is one of the best burgers I have ever had.  The buns are baked fresh daily.  The meat is cooked perfectly.  It was a flawless burger.  The pork quesadilla was also quite good."}
{"text":"The burger was the best I've ever had, had the Poblano. Everything from the pretzel bun to the meat and toppings was top notch. Unfortunately I waited 35 minutes for my food during a slow period, the service was abysmal. But, I will be back for the burgers. If not for the service, would have been five stars."}
{"text":"Well, after many chances i have given up on rehab. When it opened i gave it my best burger award, sadly, no more. If my burger is cooked correctly half the time i would be lucky.  Just tired of having recooks. This is not a one-off or random occurrence, this has been the case for over a year. This burger was supposed to be no pink."}
{"text":"Special burger experience. Once you are there definitely a recommendation. Try the ghost burger - hot but the guacamole made it perfect."}
{"text":"Solid burger place. Got the chili cheeseburger with sweet potato tots, and had to waddle myself out of the restaurant. Food was tasty. Restaurant is super small, so you feel like you're sitting on top of other people. They should really consider expanding. Our server could have been a little more attentive with refilling out drinks, but no real customer service issues here."}
{"text":"OMG!!!!!!!  I got the mac and cheese burger when I visited this place about 2 months ago and I LOVED IT!!!!!!  It was an amazing mac and cheese dish on a burger!!!!  I cannot believe how amazing there food is!!!!  I even loved the fries and I am hard to please with fries!  EVERYONE should go here and try as many burgers as they can!!!!  The atmosphere is awesome and the service is fantastic!!!  I cannot wait to go back!!!"}
{"text":"How Rehab won a Phoenix magazine award, I'll never know. I had a vegetarian option, the Noogie, and it was loaded with grilled eggplant, portabella and havarti but lacking in flavor. Beer was pricey at $5 Pacifico bottles, and my friend's green chili burger looked horrible and tastes mediocre. 

Service was way too relaxed, and everyone looked unimaginatively dumpy."}
{"text":"Came here based on a recommendation from one of our favorite Pattie's bartenders and boy was he right.

First, my biggest problem with Burgers today - a half pound burger should not be your standard size!!! When I was 10, the half pound burger was a novelty item for pigs to order and bring half of it home . Now places just assume \"oh, they want a hamburger? They must want to cry from how full they are...\" 

Now back to Rehab - sure, they have the ten ounce patty for soft suicide, but they also have the reasonable, tasty, cooked perfectly 5 ouncer, or 1/3 pound burger that most people remember. It was cooked right, juicy and not bland. I liked it so much, I went there twice during my vacation, and everything was fantastic - the fries are fresh, and shocker - taste amazing with the skin still on them. All their sauces are home made, and their wings are great. Then the burgers - I got pretty similar ones, the second day getting what I call the breakfast burger - with Bacon and a fried egg - combine that with the pretzel roll, and it was most likely the BEST one of those I've ever had! 

My friend had some fish tacos that looked screaming and I think he almost lost a finger when eating them. 

I never had a Scottsdale burger place I had to stop by - I had pizza (Grimaldi's) Italian(the Italian Grotto) Sandos (Defalcos) and steak (Don and Charlies)... Looks like I now have my burger joint! 

Service: 4 stars
Atmosphere 5 stars (cool servers, awesome laid back music, outside couches)
Food 5 stars (All Good - Burgers, Wings, Fries and Fish Tacos!)
Price 5 stars"}
{"text":"Best burger in town!!!!  I'm a pretzel bun kinda guy.  Try the clams too, you'll thank me! The calamari portion is huge as well!  Burgers are cooked to order, I always get the large on a pretzel bun with the works.  A go to place for us. Burgers are $10-12, comes with fries, sweet potato tots, or a small salad (not the greatest salad).  You will leave full! Full bar.  Service is good-great, especially at the Bar. Or ask for Kay!"}
{"text":"Can you please roll me out to my car because my food baby is killing me!!! This location in Tempe is just as awesome as the location in Scottsdale. Great food (as always) and wonderful friendly staff. It is located right behind Casa, right off Mill. I think it is a great addition to Mil Ave. The inside feels a bit bigger than the Scottsdale location and they have an awesome outside covered patio. They kept the same menu and decor as their other location, which is perfect because if something isn't broke, don't fix it! Rehab, you guys are my #1 burger place! Keep it up! :)

PS if this is your first time here, get the smaller burger, because the larger ones ARE HUGE! I recommend the Jalapeno Popper burger or The Hangover burger. Their fries are scrumptious AND if you have a Gluten allergy ask for the Gluten free bun, it actually taste great!!!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. I went here a few days ago and was really blown away. It looks \"ok\" from the outside, a little ran down and kind of shoved back behind RnR off the corner, we weren't expecting much. Little did we know when we walked in how cool, fun and delicious this place would be. It's definitely got the Cali feel to it, with pics on the walls, bikes, surf boards, and fish tanks on the TV! It's really neat the way they gave this tiny place such a big Cali feel.

The place was packed on a Sunday early afternoon, so we sat at the bar. I ordered the chicken pesto pasta and my friend ordered the hangover burger. It didn't take long for the food to get out to us, while waiting we people watched and enjoyed our beverages! The food was AMAZING!!!! The pesto had a weird mix to it, when I ate a bite with no chicken it was meh, on the ok side, but when I added a piece of their marinated chicken in the mix my taste buds went bananas! It was crazy! I started laughing so hard because the chicken brought out so much more flavor of the pesto sauce! Man am I becoming a foodie. Their hang over burger was to die for. It sounds weird at first, but then when you think about it, you're trying to figure out why no one has combined eggs, bacon, colby jack cheese and green chili on top of some deliciously cooked hamburger before! I had one bite of my friend's hamburger and I was hooked. We both started chowing down like we hadn't eaten in days! I didn't think this lunch could get any better, until I checked in and noticed a coupon for their brownies! Ahhhhh man that did us in! The brownie came out super hot (watch your tongue ouchy) with some recess chocolate pieces in it, with of course ice cream on top.....DELICIOUS! I literally don't remember the drive home because I was in a food coma from this place! My friend was lucky they didn't have to roll me out the door!

I can't wait to go back! This place is awesome!!!! Keep it up Rehab, you definitely showed me what I have been missing out on!

PS - Staff was fantastic! Everyone was so happy, smiling, courteous, and helpful, it was awesome! Not one sad face in the whole house! You don't see that much anymore! You're staff is awesome!"}
{"text":"Great service thank you Ben and the staff here but most of all the food was very off the chain delicious, the Rehab Beefstro! Yummo!! We will be back and have more amazing mouth melting greatness"}
{"text":"This place doesn't seem like much from the outside but GO HERE! The spivey Mac n Cheese burger is out of this world. Service was top notch. Highly recommend this place for a casual dinner!"}
{"text":"BEST BURGERS EVER. 
When I first went here, they had mentioned a PB&J Bacon burger.. Instantly as most would think, I thought \"Gross.\" But one of the waiters were saying it is their best seller, so I thought fine, it cant be THAT bad right?
SO GLAD I took that chance, it was easily one of the best burgers I have ever had. I recommend Rehab Burger to everyone!"}
{"text":"We came to Rehab Burger because of the great Yelp reviews and maybe our expectations were a little high as a result. It wasn't a bad experience but not quite as fantastic as we expected. The food was good and our server was good. The atmosphere was interesting with lots of stuff to look at and admire on the walls and ceiling. There are more than a few televisions that also act as a distraction. The menu has an interesting (I use that term loosely) collection of burgers, including a Peanut Butter and Jelly Burger. I was quite curious as to what that was like but not curious enough to risk ordering it and I couldn't convince anyone in my party to order it either - so I guess I'll continue to be curious. The food we did get was all good except for the sweet potato gator tots...our server said they wouldn't be mushy and alas, they were mushy. Bleh!"}
{"text":"My favorite burger place! I used to work near it but now I go anytime I am up near it. The food is great and the service is fun. It's a hole in the wall joint that not many people find, but I will always go for this place. I wouldn't say its health food by 10 miles, in fact I would make sure you're not on a diet and head over here, you will not regret it! The food is just so great, and the spicy ketchup is a must!"}
{"text":"Decided to finally visit the highly talked about restaurant and loved it! It was suggested that I try the mac-n-cheese burger. It was good, but it was a little too much for me. I still really wanted to taste the \"meat\" of the burger not just the mac-n-cheese.

But even with that comment, I would still definitely go back to try everything else on the menu! :)"}
{"text":"Finally went to this place after many people told me to check it out.

We left thinking about all the people we plan to bring back. There are all the wild and crazy burger options that fit the needs of everyone. The most popular burger is the PBJ burger and my husband had it-- was good he said! I tried the veggie burger with the onion rings and BBQ sauce topper. I liked it! The veggie burger is a fried panko bread crumb and black bean patty. It was a bit hard to judge the flavor since it was doused in BBQ sauce (which is how I like it), but I do wish it weren't fried. 

Tip for kids: They don't have a kid's menu, but you can order half orders of PBJ or grilled cheese (what we ordered, and also mac'n'cheese and other items I can't remember). They are HUGE portions and I would've been full on the half order of grilled cheese or PBJ! The even come with fries and were only like $3.25 each. 

I changed my mind and upgraded my fries to Jamaican corn at the last minute because I saw it come out on another person's plate (was DELISH, btw) and they brought me that WITH the fries at no additional charge. Super kind of them considering I was the one who made the mistake in ordering late.

The portions are huge, the food is pretty good and the prices are super reasonable considering that burger is very likely to serve as two meals for you!

Can't wait to head back!"}
{"text":"Wanted to try something new, this place didn't dissapoint. Tried the spicy mac-n-cheese burger and the PB&J burger! Not a fan of the Hawaiian burger though. Topped it off with an orange creamsicle shake. That is a must have!"}
{"text":"Swell place indeed!  Awesome staff and holy gamoley! Crazy burgers! Our party had a little bit of everything. ..
Sweet potatoe tots with ALL the dipping sauces 
Onion rings
Macaroni and cheese
Macaroni and cheese burger
Mushroom and swiss
Hangover burger
Jalapeño popper burger. 

Summer Shandy on draft as well :) 

All quite splendid!"}
{"text":"Oh my gosh, this was only my first time eating here, but it was sooo good you guys. We decided to come here thanks to you fellow Yelpers, and ordered the much raved about PB&J with bacon burger. I ordered it with the sweet potato tots, and the Chipotle aioli. The sauce alone was amazing, but then with the tots, it added some great spiciness. And okay so the burger was AMAZING. I could not even finish it all, and I got the 5oz (other option being the 10oz). I was hesitant at first, because what a weird combination! But PB&J is a classic, and when you add bacon the smokiness takes it to a whole other level. Our waitress was attentive, and the ambiance is fun. I went on a Sunday evening and didn't have to wait, but I imagine this place can get super packed because one visit just isn't enough!"}
{"text":"The peanut butter jelly burger is so gooooood!!! The salads are huge and yummy! The service was a bit slow but the food made it worth it. Who thought jelly and peanut butter would go good with a burger"}
{"text":"Looooove this place! Awesome atmosphere and friendly staff. Get the PB&J Burger!"}
{"text":"Our server Alisha was on the ball big time. She kept walking by keeping a solid eye on every table in her section. It was nice to have a rock star, professional server taking care of us.

We've been here many times. We often come here when we bike to Old Town Scottsdale, especially for spring training games and general #barcycle rides.

Tonight, I had the Bacon and Blue. The burger has the blue cheese and bacon embedded in it. Does make it a little less messy while eating. I had the kaiser wheat bun. Everything was delicious. I ordered the burger medium rare and it was spot-on. The flavors were amazing. Because, umm, cheese and bacon and beef. Also, try the spicy ketchup. Yum. 

Love their fries with the skin on. Beer was cold. There was oxygen in the room because we didn't pass out. This is a great little place right off Scottsdale Rd. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"So love this place. Took co-workers, while we were in town working, and we all had the PBJ Burger, Awesome. You have to try it to understand how yummy it is.  Have it on the pretzel bun with sweet potato fries. You won't be sorry."}
{"text":"I meant to go here a few weekends ago but because parking in Old Town is occasionally horrible, we passed and went somewhere else. I was back in the area a few nights ago and decided to get dinner here with a friend after manicures. The super friendly server seated us and was very attentive throughout the meal. We didn't get any appetizers, but we both had the Backyard BBQ burger with regular fries. The restaurant has a very low-key relaxing vibe, my only (minor) complaint was that for a Wed night when it wasn't brimming, the music was pretty loud. We got our burgers and they were very good. I had the spicy ketchup and if you have your doubts, it is most certainly spicy, but I loved it. Since Old Town isn't really my scene I'm not sure how often I'll be back, but I'd definitely return."}
{"text":"We decided to go to the tempe location because the last time we went to Scottsdale the wait was very long. We went on a Saturday night and it wasn't that busy, we didn't have to wait at all. I gave it 4 stars because our waitress was rude. The chili frito pie is so delicious. Im not really a burger person but the burgers were good but could of use more seasoning. Nice atmosphere and very busy area."}
{"text":"Waited about 25 minutes to be seated which is no deal and expected on a Saturday. It was cooler outside on the patio under the mist then indoors. I ordered mac n cheese burger (med well) which was ok. The mac n cheese was good but the burger was bland and well done. My 13 y/o son ordered their hawaiin burger and he said it was very good and seasoned. His was cooked med well. Their pineapple sauce is pretty good. I would like to come back and try a different burger."}
{"text":"Service was very disappointing for me a few days ago. I asked for a table and the lady pulled the menu out of my hands and told me there was no tables available outside or in and would be a twenty to thirty minute wait. I looked at my coworkers and decided to to go to another place to eat and as we approached the patio we saw two empty tables and a whole bar stool area empty ... was very upset because I was looking forward to the tator tots and onion rings."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere and the food is great! The sweet potato tots are really good. I went one time and the terrible service and when I mentioned something about it to the owner they immediately addressed it and bent over backwards to make sure my friends and I left happy!"}
{"text":"The service was awesome. Our waitress Tina was friendly, and so great with recommendations. I had the Rehab Burger. I split it with my daughter and still couldn't finish my half. We have so much extra to take with us. The brownie dessert was worth saving room for. Warm chocolate and peanut sauce with two warm brownies topped with ice cream. Great vibe and music makes this a feel good place to come to. We sat outside with the mister keeping us cool. If I'm in the area next time will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Deliciousness - 4/5
Happiness - 5/5

Wow! Talk about blowing you away. 

Right off the bat, this has to be one of the most ideal Happy Hour possibly. 11:00-6:00 most days, and one all-day happy hour on Thursday. 

That wouldn't matter if this place weren't SO good. The food is high quality and lots of fun burger combos. Plus it has bucked the trend of high-end burger joints by refraining from shoestring fries (a bane of my existence) and instead, offers nice medium-cut fries that look like they came from a potato. The burger was out of control - a hamburger topped with prime rib and horseradish sauce. Obviously not designed for a healthy lunch, but a real plus for total satisfaction. 

Best yet, they have multiple sauces. I love sauces, particularly aioli. I was able to taste 3 (horseradish, chipotle and pesto) and all were wonderful and summarily devoured.

But what really puts this place over is the wait staff. They were all very friendly and attentive. But most of all, constantly busy. I was so surprised to watch the bartender cleaning the shelf they have their display bottles on. In all my years of bar-sitting, I don't know I've seen anyone do that. Seeing how hard working and nice the staff is shows that they are being treated well by the ownership and love what they do. I will never turn down a chance to eat at a place like that.

Two small minuses. I really want to try a shake or dessert, but the burgers are ridiculously filling. And then, the beer selection was underwhelming. But neither remotely earns this place anything less  than 5 stars."}
{"text":"Going to keep it simple. The BEST burger I've had. I mean that as in a fancy burger, not one I made at home. I ordered the Sunday Special \"Mac n Cheese\" burger. AMAZING! Also, sweet potato tater tots. YUM.
The service was great and friendly too. Only 4 stars because I wasn't able to order any adult beverages since I was going to work... But it was a nice place, cheerful folks and GREAT food. I'm totally coming back."}
{"text":"Awesome burgers and pleasant staff. It does get crowded,  so recommended checking it out weekdays."}
{"text":"Considering Ive driven past this place a billion times and i love burgers...I was anxious and starving once we decided on lunch here. To start with the hostess threw off a vibe like she was annoyed with everyone. She didnt even try to mask her aggravation. We werent even sure if we were suppose to be following her when she seated us, Im still not sure. Because after we chose our little corner on the patio she didnt leave menus and walked away and sat another group (with menus). The food took quite a long time. And was just ok. I can say I tried it, and thats done with"}
{"text":"It looks better than it tastes.  No amazing combination that makes me say I have to go back there for that burger. The onion rings were good that was the only item that was good. Frozen burger patty. Nothing special. Costs as much as a burger at Hillstone but no where near the quality. The restaurant is also very dirty. It serves the hangover late night crowd who does not notice the dirt. Our thoughts."}
{"text":"This place was founded by the same people who started Oregano's Pizza. It has some of the same type of vibe, but a burger vibe instead of Italian. The hamburger was very good, but I probably wouldn't call it great. Mine was a little over cooked and therefore a little dryer than I like. I didn't go with the fries, so I can't comment on them. Instead I went with the onion rings and they were also very good. I look forward to going back and trying some of the other items on the menu."}
{"text":"HH very marginal.

Extremely sub-par beer selection. 8 taps. Blue moon, Coors Light, 1554, Dos X, Bud Light, Corona Light (!) and two Four Peaks. Ok, you say, they make up for the big, national, unoriginal taps with a great bottle selection. Nope. Mike's Hard Raspberry, PBR (12oz!), Red Stripe, Negro Modelo, Heineken, Corona, Corona Light (!!), Pacifico, Dos X dark, Landshark (?!). Seriously."}
{"text":"Husband and I went a bit overboard at the pool so we woke up late and needed good food ASAP - burger rehab was the closest answer without a wait. BOOM SOLD!

Luckily in the desert there was this funny little place with super great service and a menu filled with creative options.

Usually my husband is pretty apprehensive about trying new, weird food combos but we were on vacation so I think he was feeling adventurous - we got the bacon peanut butter & jelly one and the spicy Mac and cheese one with sweet potato tatter tots and whoaaaaa we were not disappointed!

Please note: This is NOT DATE FOOD! 

It's as messy as it is delicious and it really takes commitment to a FULL BITE each time in order to get the fully balance of the flavors. The portions are huge too!

The menu was put together with much  creativity and the staff was really passionate about being welcoming and kind. We sat at the bar and noticed several regulars they called by name - a good sign of a good place.

Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Let me just say that if I was ever in a burger rehab therapy clinic these would be the burgers I'd want for my meds. I bookmarked this place on Yelp a long time ago but since we live in Maricopa and work in Chandler we rarely ever venture to Scottsdale. But the other day we were like \"F-it, let's do it!\"  There were no wait times when we arrived, which is nice. They have patio seating but the décor was so fun we opted to sit inside. This place was completely decked out in beach décor. We truly felt like we were sitting in one of our favorite food shacks in San Diego off mission beach. We ordered some chips and salsa to start since we had our Check-In coupon from Yelp. If you've read my other reviews you know how super picky I am about chips AND salsa. To my surprise both were great!! Usually there is always one I'm a little \"eh\" about but at Rehab both were really good! For the burgers I ordered the Hawaiian Burger and added guacamole and my boyfriend got the Ghost Burger and we both decided to try their sweet poTOToes. (Yes that's how it's spelt!) Holy beefy amazingness batman! These burgers were delicious! They were perfectly cooked to order and I love the traditional buns they use. The tots came with this chipotle aioli sauce that was a \"I'm-ganna-just-drink-this-sh*t\" kind of good. My only regret is not being able to finish all my food! You know where you're eating and you know you're too full but you keep saying to yourself \"just one more bite...\" Yeah...that was me. It was so good but it was so much food. We all know burgers and fries/tater tots don't reheat well at all so I knew even though I was taking leftovers it wouldn't get eaten. So sad... At least my boyfriend ate all of his. Service was great too! Drinks always stayed filled, food came out at a normal time frame and the staff was very friendly. Overall this was fantastic experience and we'll definitely be making our back here soon with some friends. So should you go here? Yes. Should you come hungry? Yes. Should you expect to feel like an overstuffed thanksgiving turkey ready to bust? Yes. Will you love it? Absolutely."}
{"text":"My husband took me here for Mother's Day lunch. I have to say we almost left because of how it looked but stayed because of the reviews and DO NOT regret it at all. This place has the BEST burger I have ever tried. We had the chili fries, the chips and dip(don't remember the name), the chili cheese fries and the PBJ & bacon burger and OMG everything was perfect! I totally recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Amazing!!! Burgers were awesome! Tater tots were awesome! Blood Mary was spicy. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Burgers were amazing, service was fantastic, atmosphere was laid back - I honestly couldn't ask for more.

We were seated the moment we walked in the door and our waiter (oh I wish I got his name!) gave us the rundown of the menu since it was our first time there. Crowd favorite: PB & J, his personal favorite: spicy mac n cheese. I love that he offered up his recommendations so of course, I went for the spicy mac n cheese, with sweet potato tots and say what, it comes with a fancy sauce too? I couldn't decide for the life of me, so he offered to give me three different sauces, which was greatly appreciated. The hubby got the bigger beefstro and fries and I believe, chipotle ranch.

Both burgers were phenomenal, cooked to a juicy medium. Not to be biased, I preferred my spicy mac n cheese. Let's be realistic here, this burger is overflowing with mac n cheese and unless you're some sort of burger magician (what am I saying) you're not going to get any mac n cheese on that burger. So dig in with that fork and eat up all that mac n cheese. It was so cheesy, and this is an understatement, but I am a fan of cheese, so this was right up my alley. I was really hungry going in, and as much as I wanted to wolf down my burger, I had to stop myself and just savor each bite. It was that good.

I'm just going to stop myself there, I'm getting too hungry thinking about it to continue. But a word of advice: Get yourself that spicy mac n cheese burger, and no sharing!"}
{"text":"Great food very juicy burgers everyone just loved them and can't wait to come back for more"}
{"text":"Worst customer service experience. The hostess needs to be trained or replaced. Walked in and there was no hostess, waited 5 minutes and an employee came over took our name for first available seating. 20 minutes later and several groups seated (some that arrived after us) were seated. The hostess came out and asked who wrote our name down and I described the employee and she told me since she didn't write the name we had to go to the bottom of the list. That's poor customer service."}
{"text":"Great place for a fabulous burger and a beer. We had a salad and the Hawaiian Burger and left very satisfied! There are many options on the menu especially in the burger category, allowing you two sizes of meat patties and three choices of buns Loved our server, sorry I didn't get her name, who was very attentive! Great decor and atmosphere as well!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places for a burger. So many choices, and all are awesome. The fries and onion rings are fantastic. They offer a large variety of sauces for them. I recommend asking for a little of each until you narrow down your favs. 

The service is always good and I love the fun beachy decor too."}
{"text":"We have been here twice and both times had really good food and decent service.  It is a small place but never has felt closed in.  When the weather permits they open the front doors to the patio to give it an open feel.  I really like the decor also.  We will be back again!"}
{"text":"Am amazing mix of flavors, that are delicious. My server suggested the PB&J burger which I was not interested in. She let me know it was their most popular and her favorite. I did ask what I HAD to have there and that was the top dog. 

PB&J burger sounds gross to me but I forged ahead and damn glad I did. The sweet with the kick of the Siracha was totally on point. I was totally blown away and stunned that I liked it.

I also had the Mac n cheese burger that was phenomenal. The server said \"you might look weird eating two burgers!\" She also didn't think I could do it. I finished the burgers in principle and was full for two days!!!
The fries are great the tots are delicious and the soda cup size is large and appropriate. I also liked the Jimmy Buffet feel to the place really chill and welcoming.

This place has enough reviews but I had to put my two cents in, it is a fantastic burger spot!!!"}
{"text":"The decor is like your at the beach reminded me a lot of a beachfront So Cal location!  I love it!  Took the dare and tried the peanut butter jelly and bacon burger!  It sounds weird but once you taste it, it's freaking amazing!  One of the people with us had the hatch burger, I found it to be a little plain.  I sampled the porkster burger as well and I have to say fan freaking tastic!  The pig wings make a super tasty appetizer too!! Def will be making this my new burger hangout....sorry zenburger"}
{"text":"very nice service, friendly people, fast delivery to the table and very good food; the only thing keeping it from a 5 star is the price...a little high for a burger place and very small so during busy nights it would be tough to get in."}
{"text":"Super fun atmosphere! We chose inside dining and had a group of six. We ordered a couple of appetizers - onion rings and the chicken verde dip (don't remember exactly what it was called) and both were good. Everyone had burgers and all were great. Portion sizes are BIG. We went at happy hour so had drinks as well. It's a college town and it's a bar so it was loud. We didn't find it an issue and enjoyed our meal and company."}
{"text":"Great burgers and cool environment.... Love the stuff all over th place. Super beachy.  The staff and very eager to help and make sure the dining experience is on par. 
Nice large portions , so left overs for next day. 
Had Hatch burger, patty melt, cheese fries and beer. Really great place, our first time here and we will be back."}
{"text":"Awesome food and the best service I have ever had in any restaurant. Make sure you ask for Robin...she is the role model for anyone in the service business! We'll be back but only if Robin is here. Thank you Robin!"}
{"text":"We saw the restaurant reviewed on \"Check Please\" a local program on places to dine and looked interesting.  The place is fun, indoor and outdoor seating with a large inside bar,  and right on the edge of Old Town in Scottsdale so easy to walk.  There was parking across the street as only two cars can park in front of the restaurant.  The food was outstanding!  The PBJ hamburger was my husband's favorite of all he's tried, a friend had the Philly burger, salads were fresh and every bite was eaten.  The sweet potato nuggets are baked and exceptional!  We saw the mac n' cheese burger on the TV review and it was being ordered by several people - if you like mac n' cheese, one to try.  Lots to choose, wings, salads, etc.  Add to your list of \"must try!\""}
{"text":"Seriously you can't go wrong with anything here.. but the fish tacos and sweet potatoes tots are the bomb! Ask for marshmallow fluff with your tots and prepare for heaven. 

Wait staff is always extremely friendly, too."}
{"text":"I love Rehab! Their food and drinks are always delicious! The service is always great too! They have happy hour all day on Thursdays"}
{"text":"Great Place, lively atmosphere. I had the mushroom swiss and my date had the healthier turkey burger and salad. Our waitress Cheryl was wonderful and brought us alll the diff sauces to try...my sweet potato tots were delicious with all the diff aoili's and I snuck a taste of the pomegranite vinegarette my date had which was very tasty too.  Hurry and get to Rehab burger to try their delicious menu. Patio misters going full blast if you like to sit outside."}
{"text":"Food was delicious, service was quick and friendly. Everyone seemed happy and satisfied. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The food is usually good here but should not take a whole hour for a burger. When I mentioned how long it took the server pretty much ignored the comment as she kept walking away. The restaurant was pretty empty which added to the frustration. Luckily lots of other choices in the area"}
{"text":"I have probably been here 10 times, and every single time I have had a great burger. Their regular bugers are great, but I love how there is a different \"specialty\" burger every weekend. They come up with some amazing stuff. The icing on the cake is their sweet potato tots!.... I am a big guy and I can't finish their smaller bugers size. Great portions at a very reasonable price."}
{"text":"This place is great
You have to try the pig wings they are amazing.
The ghost pepper burger was great they actually cooked it the way I asked portions are huge they are not cheap at all
Overall a great location great Ottmus fear great people the service was good I would be definitely coming back and I would highly recommend"}
{"text":"Burger was so good and huge. Also got a salad which was massive. Salad was average. Great burgers fun vibes."}
{"text":"Hair in my fries...and the burger was just okay. I've been here a few times and enjoyed it but now I think I'm going to pass. Not a fan."}
{"text":"I've been here a handful of times. I LOVE the sweet potato tots. I always get a burger with swiss cheese and blue cheese with some sauce. I've never been disappointed, they are so delicious and I TOTALLY recommend. This is my favorite place to get a burger in the valley"}
{"text":"I really love the service at this local spot. I pop in for lunch and they are fast and friendly. The burgers are amazing. I suggest trying the hangover burger with the fried egg and the poblano pepper. Even the smaller burger is huge. I love the assortment of buns and the spicy ketchup. They have a nice relaxed atmosphere where you will want to stay a while and relax. The decor looks like it belongs on a beach and the people are fantastic. It is always clean and food arrives quickly."}
{"text":"Based off of Yelp, we decided to come here. We were not disappointed:

Pros:
(+) Were seated right away by a friendly hostess
(+) Our waitress was very friendly and attentive
(+) Had some kind of peach beer that was absolutely delicious
(+) My boyfriend and I both had the porkster. He added egg and bacon on it. Both on the white bun. (I really wanted the add-ons but was trying to make it at least a little healthier, lol). Half pulled pork half beef, with a super yummy bbq sauce and cheddar cheese. mmmm so good. Absolutely no complaints.
(+) The sweet potato tater tots were amazing! I could eat those all day. And I chose the spicier of the sauces, super yummy
(+) Cool funky decor, nice atmosphere

Neutral:
( ) The Pig Wings (Pork on a stick doused with peachy bbq sauce) - it was just okay. The sauce was a bit too much (completely doused, the menu description wasn't lying). The pork was tender, but I wasn't blown away.

This place was delicious. Top two burger places on my list (first is Holsteins in Las Vegas if you would like to read my review).  I would definitely come here again when I'm in the area, and looking forward to it!"}
{"text":"Kinda layer back, beach vibes place.  The food is good but my only complaint is that it can get very loud in there and is the summer time people come in to wait to be seated and they leave the front door wide open.  Like come on, totally not fair.  The staff should at least say something when the door stays open for a long time a nothing but hot air gets in.  The food is good and I guess it could be worth the hot air blowing in as long as u have a car parked outside with cold air conditioner when you leave."}
{"text":"We ate here and loved it, I actually had the grilled chicken sandwich and it was awesome, everything fresh and yummy, my brother had an appetizer which was also very good , the server was on point which made everything perfect!!"}
{"text":"Loved it here! Our server was very friendly and it was my first time there and didn't know they closed at 10pm and he offered us water to go after a few cocktails."}
{"text":"This place has such a fun atmosphere and great food! Their pig wings are amazing and I have never been disappointed with any burger that I've ever ordered. If you want to escape the desert for a little, come by and grab a burger at this little beach shack!"}
{"text":"OMG. Do yourself a favor and go here when you need rehab or just want a relapse. 

I shared an order of chips and salsa, as they gave us a check in offer. The chips were hefty (thick goodness) and the salsa tasty. I made a comment at the time we were eating these that they were almost like pita chips. 

Then my Hawaiian burger arrived. I had ordered the pretzel bun on the recommendation of our waitress (who was very helpful and attentive), and then I worried about it until the moment that I took my first bite. Wow. The blend of flavors of the Hawaiian with the pretzel bun was perfect, and those sweet potato tots were addictive!

The place was packed on a Thursday evening; maybe having happy hour all day long on Thursday had something to do with it, but my guess is the tasty food brings people here. The decor on the walls and ceiling gives the place a real beachy Ron Jon feel. I'm not a big fan of the high chairs and table arrangement, but there are \"normal\" tables and chairs here too; we just ended up with the high ones. Big patio outside and plenty of space inside.

I didn't see a lot of parking spaces other than a few right in front. Most people were parking on the street, and the line stretched down a few blocks."}
{"text":"Went on a golf trip and found the best burgers ever!!!   Had the Mushrrom Swiss on a pretzel bun.   The burger was disgustingly great. The fries were fantastic and are waitress was funny and fast.  I will be back twice next year!!!       Oh, and our waitress recommended the PB&J and I thought she was just being cute, but lots of people(locals) around us were ordering it and I think I must have it."}
{"text":"5 Star for scene...fun great vibe...it's like a beach bar.
5 Star for Staff...friendly, helpful and accommodating.
4 Star for the food.
I had the bacon cheese burger and Buffalo Wings.  Cheese burger was cooked medium and was fairly large if you order the 10 ounce.  It was served with these amazing sweet potato tater tots and plenty of them that are worth going there alone for.  They are light and not greasy.  My Brioche bun was a nice compliment to the burger nice and fresh.
Wings were  fine but I would say stick to the burger...AKA  why it's called Rehab Burger Therapy...it's a burger place.  Don't forget the margarita...high quality!  Check out the place if you are looking for a fun spot and be beach like spot."}
{"text":"Why does this place not have a/c? We were sweating like crazy in this joint. It was PACKED and I think it's because it's one of those places people want to love. 

Gotta say, however, I wasn't impressed. I see a lot of \"burger snobs\" in the reviews. Hmm... I love burgers, it's my favorite food, but I wasn't impressed. The kitchen also messed up our orders and the waitress did, too. She did try to correct it however, so I'm not complaining too much. 

The food was good, the atmosphere is very college-sports-bar place, just like everything else in the area, but as far as a hands down fantastic burger? Hmm... I'll say it's 4-stars, but not 5."}
{"text":"My bestie and I live in the neighborhood and frequented this bar before it was burger therapy. We love it the new way! We don't eat meat but they were super accommodating! They have happy hr until 6! The menu is diverse (except the salads) and is reasonably priced! I got the tuna salad sandwich and she got the veggie burger, both were amazing, and the server brought us some of their amazing sauces to try!"}
{"text":"Service was a bit slow considering it wasn't very busy when we were there but our waitress was very friendly and helpful, giving us insights into what we might like. I ordered chicken wings and they were fantastic! Drinks were excellent. My sister had a burger, which she thought was good. I will definitely come back to try something new!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend  and I checked this place out for the first time today. We ordered the Pig Wings- GREAT DECISION! I would come back just for those alone! Most of the places we check out have happy hour that ends at four, but we were pleasantly surprised theirs was until six. The staff was friendly, the food was great. Definitely ask for the pretzel bun, they are delicious."}
{"text":"I love when a burger joint can live up to just a simple burger... There is so much more for me to try but let's just say they have tots. Tater tots."}
{"text":"This is the best burger I've ever had. I had the porkster burger and a Mexican beer. The beer was cold. And the burger was fabulous. Highly recommend. Enjoy. Also, my step father had a salad. It was also amazing. Highly recommend. Enjoy."}
{"text":"Solid food with trendy vibe.  Great burger, average fries and good people watching in a convenient location."}
{"text":"We were celebrating a friends birthday tonight so I thought I would honor his aging with a little child like ordering of my own. I had the PB&J Bacon Burger. It is exactly what it sounds like: creamy peanut butter and grape jelly melting over a juicy beef patty with hearty bacon slices. There is also a little sirano chili in the mix to further confuse your taste buds. It was served with sweet potato tots and a pineapple dipping sauce. I washed it down with a Corona Rita. I probably won't do this one again, because there are so many other great burgers on the menu I want to try next but if you are a little brave and very hungry, give this one a go. It will make you feel like a kid again."}
{"text":"Visiting Phoenix for a Cardinals game and my husband found this place on YELP!  When we drove by it looked a bit sketchy and I was a bit leery to go inside.  I checked out the pics on YELP and boy was I glad I did!  The burgers are fabulous!  The place is small but the atmosphere was fun and the food did not disappoint!  I would definitely make Rehab Burger a go to spot when we are back in town!"}
{"text":"Gold Medal Wings!  I know it's Rehab BURGER but if you haven't tried the wings you are missing out!  The sauce is simply amazing melt in your mouth delicious. The best wings in AZ"}
{"text":"I loved  this place. It was amazing the food was fabulous and Michelle is the best   First time there will most definitely be back the bloody Mary was wonderful"}
{"text":"Escaping the cold weather in the North East , my wife and I saw great reviews for Rehab Burger and decided we would stop there for some lunch. Who doesn't love a great burger? It is very cool looking almost to the point where it reminded me of a Senior Frogs. It seems they spent more money turning the place into a tourist trap and forgot they were supposed to be selling a top notch burger. But that's ok - after eating the dried out patty - I went back by the pool which was the real reason I was in Arizona."}
{"text":"A must try & unique menu offerings. Portions are huge & we couldn't finish our meals but everything we ordered was delicious."}
{"text":"Excellent service and the burgers are some of the best in the valley, outdoor patio with the party vibe makes rehab the perfect place to go for food or fun with friends"}
{"text":"Wow. So many choices here. I ended having the jalapeño popper burger, very good. Hubby had fish tacos, huge and couldn't finish. 
The caramel shake was delicious. I had onion rings, average."}
{"text":"Located off Mill Avenue this burger joint brings in a fun crowd .. outside patio seating has the much needed misters or plenty of indoor seating .. 

We were invited to a private taco party and I am so happy we made it .. our group shared fish, chicken & pork tacos (only the fish tacos are on the menu), huge guacamole, salsa & pico de gallo.. we ate family style .. 

The battered cod fish tacos were my favorite .. served with cabbage & a sprinkle of cotija cheese, tomato, cilantro and salsa.. squeeze of lime .. yum

Summer drink specials were very good.. the strawberry crush with jack Daniels was my fav..

Servers took excellent care of our group.. looking forward to our next visit... thanks again for allowing us to celebrate at your spot!!"}
{"text":"Did not disappoint at all best onion rings I have ever had in my life, burger was excellent love this place would highly recommend"}
{"text":"Yay we have ReHab Burger in the Central Phoenix Corridor! ( it moved into where The Garage used to be). 
So happy to see it open. Popped in today. 
Wish I was drinking today because Happy Hour All Day Thursday from 11- closing. 
Alas I had to stay awake today. 
Greeted by several employees with a cheery welcome! Seated promptly and ordered some cokes. 
Inside is fun.... less cramped than the one in Scottsdale. I really like it!! 
Ordered the Hangover Burger for Husband... 10oz and I got the Mushroom/Swiss. 5 oz! 
Sweet potato tots and onion rings. 
Everything came out perfect. Hot and fresh. The lettuce/tomato/red onion were crispy!  Nice touch! 
Can't wait to come back!!"}
{"text":"Well, the reviews dont lie! This place is the shit.
I had to go all out and get 2 meat patties. The burger was as big as my head. Not only that but ooooh so good! The fries were on point as well as the ranch! I admire this place. The staff are extremely friendly and so nice. The burger comes with shredded letuce which ive always loved on a burger and the cheese is soo good it looks like it would belong on those grilled cheese commercials where they pull it apart and you can see the cheese just pull but not break. Ughh this place has my heart. This is soo not a good thing for me. 
The chips and salsa were good too!
Ill be back!"}
{"text":"Delicious, fun and unbelievably perfect margaritas. Our waitress made every detail great. We had four kids with us, and some of the food was a little spicy for them -helped figure out a solution on the fly so they were filled up and we didn't buy four additional meals. Quick tip...call ahead for large parties. We had our table waiting for us upon arrival."}
{"text":"This place is magic!! Try the pb&j hamburger!! I was very scared at first but it was really good. I wanted to order 10 more!! The service was great and the pawn shop next door was fun too!"}
{"text":"Excellent burger. If you are gluten free be aware that the sweet potato tots might be coated.  Would return."}
{"text":"Best burger joint in Scottsdale!!! Food is always great and staff is always friendly!!! Definitely a must when deciding on places to go!!!"}
{"text":"Burgers are pretty good!! Very unique and tasty but huge!! Been here a few times it's a good place to go for some comfort food."}
{"text":"Service was great.  The food was amazing. We had the spicy Mac n cheese and the hatch chili.  Both excellent!  Sweet potato tots are really good."}
{"text":"Grabbed dinner here and was not disappointed. Our server was very pleasant and personable with just the right amount of check-ins with us. He seemed to really enjoy his job which was something nice to see in the service industry.
I was torn between trying the PB&J Burger, the Poblano or the hatch chili burger. 
PB&J was out because that only came in rehab size & I wasn't that hungry. (The rehab is a pretty large burger, so either come hungry, share with others in your party or plan on bringing leftovers home.) Our server recommended the poblano and I was NOT disappointed...it was done perfectly and very flavorful. The sweet potato tots were tasty and came with a selection of dipping sauces.
This place is worth return visits.
FWIW, we went on a Friday night and when we stepped inside to check in the ambient noise was pretty high. We ended up getting a table outside which seemed to have a much lower noise level."}
{"text":"Only bad think I can mention about this place is the single bathroom. One for Men/Women and one for Women so if you have to go on a busy Friday night, you'll need to get in line. But not a big deal. 
Service was quick and friendly. Burgers are great. Big and juicy with your choice of different buns. The fires are good and plentiful. My wife like the sweet potato tots. 
Get there early on the weekend as there is usually a line but it moves quick. Been here 8+  times and never disappointed. I like the McNarley burger. Be prepared, the Rehab burger is two patties, hugh and messy. Ask for extra napkins."}
{"text":"This place is great! The food was delicious, and the service spectacular.  We came here for lunch and sat out on the patio. About 10 minutes in, a Roto-Rooter truck unexpectedly pulled up next to the restaurant and began doing its thing - think loud noise and terrible smell. The staff of Rehab quickly moved everyone inside and shut the doors to keep the offending noise and smells out. They were apologetic (even though it wasn't their fault) and the rapid response to an unanticipated interruption during the prime lunch hour was impressive.  Food came out and was amazing. I'll be back next time I'm in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"This place is soooo good. I love the burgers, they are awesome. The menu has a wide variety, and I have tried a few other things, and they too were delicious. Happy hour is also great. Love the place, the atmosphere and the help have always been great."}
{"text":"Great food and amazing service, had the Philly cheese burger; it was really good. Great atmosphere, definitely a must try!"}
{"text":"Fantastic burgers and really tasty tots and fries! Tried the spicy mac n cheese and the ghost burger, both were really delicious. The mac n cheese on the mac n cheese burger could have gotten serious props on its on, but being on a burger just elevated its creamy, cheesy flavor even more. Ask for the diablo hot sauce to try on the ghost burger (SO FREAKIN GOOD). 

The fries and sweet potato tots were also super yummy. Great potato-y flavor in both, and they went really well with the huge variety of sauces the waiter brought for dipping. Speaking of the waiter, the service was also very good, with the manner being a little casual and brusque, but everything we ordered and subsequent requests were treated graciously, and brought out very quickly. He also took the down to sit down (casual manner I was talking about), and explain which were the best and most popular burgers. He said the PBJ bacon burger is the most popular, but my friend thought it sounded gross so we didn't order it since we had decided to split them. 

We got the smaller (relapse) size on both, and they were more than big enough, especially given the VERY generous portions of mac n cheese on the spicy mac burger and guac on the ghost. 

Overall, a very well-rounded establishment with very good food. If you are a burger lover, you'll love this place, and it's easy to see why it was voted best burger in AZ last year. It was even most recently featured on the travel channel (last Sunday I believe). 

PS Get the burgers on the pretzel bun!!"}
{"text":"Came in for the first time today. Oh my god. I had a salad. A Ceasar salad. And it solved all of my problems. The coronarita took me back to heaven where I met the gods of all things beautiful. And the gods brought peanut butter a jelly bacon burger and I said ohmygod god thank you this is so freaking good. I think that the peanut butter and jelly burger could stop somebody from committing suicide. I think it could turn Ganondorf from demon to saint. I think I might come here for dinner for the rest of my life. I'm so passionate about this place now idek.

Screw engineering. I want a degree in rehab burger therapy."}
{"text":"Awesome funky laid back surfs up dude vibe.. I opted for the classic grilled cheese ( crazy right ?) , I know I was in a burger joint but I also know if anyone can make a mean grilled cheese it's a place like this. Pair it with some jumbo onion rings and a crisp dill pickle chased with a local cold draft beer and I'm in heaven"}
{"text":"Awesome place for burgers in Tempe!

I've been to the Rehab burger in Scottsdale, and this one in Tempe does not disappoint as well! In fact, it's a lot more spacious than the original.

We ordered a couple of burgers and I also got the signature spicy Mac n cheese! Everything was phenomenal!!!! The service was great!

If there is one thing I urge you to try it's the spicy Mac and cheese. The flavor of it is amazing, and it's actually not that spicy! I would highly recommend going here again! 

Tips:
1) get the sweet potato tater tots, they're the best! 
2) parking here is scarce since it's on Mill, you may need to find a spot anywhere and just walk here
3) get the spicy Mac n cheese, it's sooo good! If you get the \"rehab\" size, it's definitely easily shared with 5-6 people"}
{"text":"Holy Smokes!!!!! These are some BIG burgers!!!! 

We came into rehab burger excited to try these CRAZY looking burgers based off the pictures we keep seeing on yelp and Facebook, and we were not disappointed! 

The Scottsdale location gives an island vibe to the restaurant and was packed even when it was on a Sunday night. We waited for around 30 minutes but this place was definitely worth the wait. 

I came in hungry and I ordered a bbq pulled pork burger win sweet potato tater tots!  I also ordered some spicy Mac n cheese! The burger was HUGE and it was also super tasty! Be ready to make a mess cause you will definitely NOT be able to fit the whole burger in your mouth when you bite into it.  The sweet potato tater tots are soooo good too! They are SOOO much better than getting regular fries that I need to get this every time I come here! 

The spicy Mac n Cheese was also sooo delicious! I know you are probably gonna come in here craving a burger, but if you're with a lot of friends, order the Mac n cheese cause it's sooo good! 

Overall this place is awesome for some big freakin burgers that taste great! I'm so excited to try the one in Tempe now! 

Tips:
Come hungry, cause these are are HUGE burgers
Get sweet potato tater tots, they're the best side you can get with your burger
If you have some friends with you, try the Spicy Mac n cheese, it's sooo good too! 
Be expected to wait if you come for dinner, it's pretty packed in there"}
{"text":"I went here for a solo lunch, sat at the bar and had a great time. I ordered the Cobb salad (my typical favorite) and it was huge and awesome. It's one of those salads that gets piled so high you have to really be careful when you first start eating it or it will end up over your table--and that's a good thing if you ask me.

I also ordered the mac & cheese, and if you like mac & cheese with a kick I would highly recommend ordering it. Even the smaller size is pretty large so it's good for sharing. I ended up taking at least half of my meal home which was great for lunch the next day.

When I'm back in town this is definitely on my must visit list!"}
{"text":"Losing a bar that has become such a big part of your life is hard to swallow. 5 seasons of 49ers football on Sunday, rehearsal dinner for our wedding, countless date nights & happy hours... The Garage was a home away from home. I say this only because it leads up to the understanding that, so far, Rehab Burger Therapy has done a incredible job moving into the neighborhood. The staff is outstanding, food is on point & the adult beverages never go wrong. If you were a garage regular, I 100% encourage you to come in. You might just see some familiar faces. If you're apart of this great neighborhood, rehab will be a home away from home. I'll definitely be busy on the Your Phix In Phx Instagram posting plenty of pics."}
{"text":"Unique flavors that wow the taste buds.  Peanut butter and jelly burger?  Sounds weird but it works so well.  Every burger I have tried is amazing.  

Meat and ingredients are top notch.  Ambiance is casual, service is friendly and efficient. 

During busy spring season line is out the door for good reason.  I'm a local so I get to go when it's not so busy.  I almost always recommend this place to friends coming to visit."}
{"text":"I was craving a burger--a REAL burger--and Rehab was everything I wanted and more. It is truly rare to have one's expectations met so well!

Every menu item looks great, but I needed something spicy, so I went with the Know Poblano burger, with manchego cheese, actual, actually grilled poblano peppers, and sauteed onions. Because this wasn't enough spice for me, and I felt brave, I went with the beef chorizo patty. 

It was everything I wanted and more.

The chorizo itself was surprisingly lean without being dry. It was basically a burger loaded--LOADED with spice. Like, it only burned my tongue a little bit, but the whole thing was so full of seasoning that the steam would make my eyes water every time I lifted it to take a bite. That's not a complaint, that's freaking amazing. On the side were *perfect* fries seasoned with garlic salt, as well as some sriracha aioli. 

I washed it down with a large margarita, which was discounted thanks to Thursday's all-day happy hour. It was definitely not weak, and for sure not too sweet. Spectacular, just like everything else. 

If you're not into (red) meat, there are legit fish tacos (I tried a bite! They're good enough!), as well as veggie burgers. 

So there. You have no excuses to avoid this amazing, amazing restaurant. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Delicious as always !!! Lunch date with my husband which was nice. $34 for two!!! No alcohol, just one soda and a water. I got the turkey club but the middle bread makes it too much. I took that out right away and got a box for the other half of my sandwich. Much to large to eat. Husband got the McNarley and the bartender suggested he omit the middle piece of bread which helped. I will get that club again but on smaller bread. She said they have a marble rye which is smaller. I will go for that. Waitress was super helpful and friendly!!! We got there at 11:45 and ended up sitting at the bar to eat because it was going to be a 25 minute wait!!"}
{"text":"Worst burger I have ever had. Asked for my burger medium, it was so burnt i tried to eat it but felt sick, and had ZERO flavor! after half of the burger it was so bad I let my friend take it for her dogs.  So food wise I would say a 0 but we did had good service (even though a little pushy) which made me give this places 3.. pretty disappointed cuz I was so excited to try a new place!"}
{"text":"Thanks Mike A for being A1 can't wait to come back for some exotica!!!request for Mike A!!! GO CUBS GO!"}
{"text":"Fantastic! 

I have seen and heard about this cute burger joint for a long time and finally tried it the other day. We wanted to pick up burgers and fries for the championship march madness game and this place did not disappoint! 

We had:
2 bacon cheeseburgers (one with an egg) 
Poblano burger 
2 orders of crispy fries
onion rings
wedge salad 

Every single thing was delicious! The burgers were cooked to perfection and the fries as well as the bacon on our burgers were crispy and yummy. The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is because I didn't get the egg on my burger and the food wasn't ready when I was supposed to pick it up. 

A great place for good food and a cool atmosphere; they have themselves a new frequent customer."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a chill spot, this is it. Super friendly staff. They talk to you like you are one of their friends! Great food! I personally suggest the pulled pork with the pineapple teriyaki aioli. Or just some fries with that as a sauce to dip it in. They also have a really good happy hour (11am-6 or 11am-Close in Thursday's). One of the top places to be at on Mill Ave for sure."}
{"text":"Today I took my kids and my husband to this restaurant. I got the sweet potato tater tots they were literally the bomb! Also our server was Sam she was really kind. She did really well and it was only her third day!!!! This restaurant had some \"bomb\" beers. Also if you are a vegetarian they have great salads. The burgers were normal size and good tasting. #bomb.com!!!!! Hahaha tell your family and friends!!!"}
{"text":"Outstanding burgers, I had the backyard BBQ, the others in my group had the Swiss & mushroom, bacon cheeseburger, and hatch chili burger. We all agreed best burgers we've ever had. Fries were fresh, the sweet potato  tater tots are good, the onion rings were excellent. The staff was attentive and friendly, the owner popped over to check on us. Overall a very we'll run burger joint with excellent food. I will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"I had the mushroom swiss burger and my husband had the turkey burger. He absolutely loved his! Mine was good but the fries were not hot. Not the biggest deal breaker. They were super busy and our server was awesome! But I'm sure it's hard to get everything out hot when under super busy conditions."}
{"text":"Great service! They seated our party of 8 with care. Took our toddler's order first. Great service! We ordered a different burger and all were great. Hit of the table was the PBJ, which was delicious. I have no idea why it works... But it does. Order with tots and Chipotle sauce and you won't be disappointed! Only downside was the crowd noise. You literally cannot hear what the people on the other side of the table are saying. Probably best for younger crowds as we had varied generations with us. Overall great food and good service."}
{"text":"Would have liked to try it today. Was meeting a friend for lunch. The reviews didn't say anything about paid parking. We already parked the car in the underground garage when we read the sign that said that they closed on Mondays. Darn it. So we went to the taco place next door which was great but a little expensive"}
{"text":"Good burgers, but super greasy! The French fries were alright but nothing too great. Good customer service though"}
{"text":"Amazing burgers! Highly recommend the Hangover burger with the chorizo patty! Very very good place!"}
{"text":"Terrible take out experience - we did NOT get what we ordered the barbecue burger got home with a basic burger with cheese (take out order) and soggy beyond belief fries that I am trying to reconstitute in our toaster oven. Will not go back not worth it!"}
{"text":"Great burgers ! Way to much to even finish solo. We recommend maybe sharing a burger and fries. Chili  cheese  fries  are out of this world. This is definitely a spot you got to try while in Scottsdale"}
{"text":"Really awesome burgers! The atmosphere was kind of hawaiian barish.  The staff are really nice and attentive.  We got the pb&j burger and I really forgot the second one.. he said it was like a big mac.  

Pb&j- SO good, gotta say it has super umami flavoring.  Has to be the peanut butter and shiracha.  A warning though it can get overwhelming so I would share this. 

Big mac?-  Nothing special just a burger with lots of toppings and overwhelming sauce.  So I guess not knowing the name of it isn't that bad.  

It can get crowded so I'd come early if you dont want to wait.  I remember these people right behind me and up in my personal bubble.. felt so weird. But I guess the awesome burger made up for it"}
{"text":"Great burgers and fries, also surprisingly good fish tacos. Cocktails a bit overpriced for size and strength. Service was very friendly. Music is too loud, sit outside of you can!"}
{"text":"Came in for my sons Birthday on April 19th. It was a Wednesday & this place was \"packed\" we had about a 40 minute wait. 
Nevin was are server. Great customer service. It was our first time in and he explained the \"run down \" of how this place operates! Either you're gonna Relapse or Rehab! 
Had the wings, offer a few different flavors and options, they were good! 
Outstanding burgers, the best order in our party was the Hangover & BBQ burger. Suggest ordering your patty medium! I also suggest- getting the onion rings, a little more costly, but well worth it! 
The atmosphere here is really cool, kinda a beach style scene! 
Only downside: an extremely long wait after placing our burger order. However , do to the service we received & how often our server check in with us, we'll let that slide! Also, I wasn't to impressed with my Gnarly Burger. It was sorta plain, nothing special  & just average tasting. When we come again I'll try another burger they offer as they have many different options."}
{"text":"Simply amazing the pbj burger is by far the best I have ever had. Parking is simple. Service is good. The place is pretty busy with a small wait but the burgers do not disappoint."}
{"text":"I'll go ahead and add my 5 stars and spare you the 2 cents - other than to say the food here is fantastic, the place is clean, the staff is nice, the decor is cool, the location is awesome, and they had jawbreakers in the candy basket on the way out. 

Definitely go here and eat."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Unpretentious, delicious and affordable.  Some of the best burgers in the Valley.  Ask about their secret menu!"}
{"text":"First night in Scottsdale and tried Rehab Burger on a whim.  Couldn't have picked a better place!!  Both my hubby and I thoroughly enjoyed our burgers - he had a Philly Burger and I had a turkey burger.  Both were bigger than we could eat!!  Service was excellent.  We are outside and they even had the warmers on to keep us toasty.  This will not be our last visit while we're here!!"}
{"text":"Good burgers and decent service.  If try it again to check it out.  Good assortment of burgers.  Good quality food"}
{"text":"This place was so good. I had the pbj bacon burger and it was mind blowing hands down the best burger I have ever tasted. There located in the heart of downtown Scottsdale but there prices for the amount and quality of food you get for under$10 I feel like I was ripping them off. I know it sounds weird but if you want to step outside the box and try there most popular burger you have to try the pbj burger."}
{"text":"Awesome burgers and fries! The wait staff were efficient and super friendly. They have everything from a regular cheeseburger to a peanut butter and jelly burger. NIce patio to sit outside with mist blowing  to keep you cool in the heat."}
{"text":"I've always wanted to try this burger joint and my kids wanted to too. So we came here on a Saturday night. I figured it's a burger joint and Yelp says no reservations which makes sense. It's just a burger. My son got here a little earlier than us and tried to get a table inside but found out you have to make a reservation to sit inside. So he got us a table outside. 

Outside is not that big with about five tables and chairs on the railing too. Almost all is high top tables. They had the misters and small fans for the heat in the afternoon. I think they turn those off around 6pm. All I know is the outside cause I never made it inside. First time this has ever happened to me. 

I ordered the Spicy Mac n Cheese rehab burger. There are so many options. Rehab 10oz. Relapse 5oz. How it's cooked, bun, and potatoes you want. So I got a pretzel bun with sweet potatoes tots. Man was this good but really filling. Thick and juicy 10oz burger cooked perfectly with huge serving of Mac and cheese falling off the burger. Mac n cheese had bacon bits and it really wasn't that spicy at all. I was barely able to finish it all. Tots were good and love the different selections of dipping sauces they have. Really good. Really filling. 

My wife and mom got the Hawaiian burger. Had pineapple and ham between the burger. My daughter got the Hatch. Everyone enjoyed the burger but no one could finish their burger but me and my son. Oh well. 

The service was great. She brought out our water cups and drinks right away. Kept tabs on us and our food came out pretty quickly. Can't complain about that. 

It was pretty fun eating outside. Nice breeze to keep it cool and watching the traffic go by was pretty interesting especially those traveling bars where you have to pedal while drinking. 

So great burgers. Filling. Fresh and don't forget lots of options to make your burger special. Service was great and if you like the outdoors it's great. Otherwise I suggest you make a reservation to get inside. Oh yea there is free public parking just steps from the place so you don't have to worry about where to park especially in Old Town Scottsdale. 

Enjoyed it a lot and will most definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great service but we were unhappy that the burgers did not live up to the Yelp hype.  They were dry and dense, you could tell they took the meat and used a machine to compress it into shape rather than hand forming the patties. Also practically had a whole head of lettuce on my burger. Beer choices were pretty pathetic and dominated by the big brands while ignoring local craft beers (sorry Four Peaks does not qualify as craft anymore since they are owned by Budweiser.)"}
{"text":"I really like this place. So many good burgers to choose from. The PB &J burger is something everyone should try. You won't be disappointed! For a burger place I really have to recommend the pasta too. Amazing. The mac and cheese is so yummy. Their appetizers are good as well. I haven't had anything I didn't like. As a side try the Jamaican corn, wow. When in Scottsdale this is a must.  Their brownies are amazing. Such a fun laid back atmosphere that everyone can enjoy. Great food, great drinks, great service! Wish we had one in Tucson!"}
{"text":"I'm new in town and was looking for a good place to eat so I decided to try this place out. It was actually really good! I god the Hawaiian burger which had ham on it so it was different than any other Hawaiian burger I've ever had. I went for the smaller sized party and was still stuffed. The sauce was also delicious and our waitress was super nice. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Best Burgers in town. They are HUGE!!  they have some funky options but all are good. The pretzel buns are great. Fun atmosphere, great service and awesome food.
Try it out you will be back!"}
{"text":"Also das war ja mal ne Überraschung, die ich ohne Yelp nie gefunden hätte. Von außen echt eigenartig, wollten erst garnicht rein. Aber drinnen wie die Tardis. Irgendwie größer, als gedacht und voller Leben.

Die Bedienung war amerikanisch typisch äußerst aufmerksam, zack schon hätte man die großen Becher Gratiswasser. Burger gibt's ohne Ende - wer nix findet macht sich einfach selber einen. Zudem kann man sich auch die Buns noch aussuchen + Bratgrad + Beilagen. Probiert die Süßkartoffel Tots, der Dip ist zum Reinlegen.

Die Burger gehören zu mit dem Besten, was ich bisher zwischen zwei Brötchenhälften genießen durfte. Am Ende kam die Rechnung, 25 $ für zwei Personen. Da fällt Dir nix mehr ein. So wenig zählt man hier bei keinem Fastfood-Kettenladen.

Wer Burger mag und hier vorbeikommt - absolutes Pflichtprogramm!"}
{"text":"Awesome find. Loved all the choices, loved that you could get large and small portions. Great service, great atmosphere, great prices, great food. Oh we didn't mention the awesome draft beer choices and prices! We'd be regulars if we lived here. This is what yelp is all about... thank you Yelpers for helping us find this place!"}
{"text":"This place is a gem in the southwest...We Buffalo people know food and this place rocks...I would suggest the pbj burger...phenomenal... just saying"}
{"text":"Jon the bar tender gives amazing service!! The food here is off the hook! Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I went out with some friends and most of us had burgers, but all of us had fun!
Even though the night we went there was a big group of people having fun too and it was a little loud at times, we were still taken care of. I saw all ages there.

Burgers are GOOD and could SHARE, but why would you want to??

David our server was absolutely great, especially for us newbies to Rehab.
I had the BBQ burger with wheat bun, another had the Mushroom with pretzel bun. The \"outlier\" had fish tacos, which to them were just okay. 
I prefer the wheat and it was great but I did try the pretzel bun and it was good.  Everyone LOVED LOVED LOVED the sweet potato tater tots!!! I was quite full after eating just the burger.

One tip I have to share is there are 2 types of burges, the regular sized rehab and the smaller \"relapse\". The bun comes in one size (the big rehab size) so the relapse can look kinda odd being small on a huge bun.

Parking is, I agree, kinda weird, but you still gotta go here!

All in all, the burgers, atmosphere and busy yet attentive waitstaff are worth it. I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Tried the spicy Mac and cheese relapse burger. It's like a side and sandwich in one! Very good, not too spicy. Skip the onion rings. Should have tried the sweet potato tots."}
{"text":"Where to start? The food is absolutely incredible. Pig wings and calamari are my faves from the ap menu. Chili is the name of the game of the burgers whether its the chili cheese burger, poblano, or hatch you can't go wrong. Fish tacos (not on the menu) are huge and tasty! Milkshakes (virgin or not) will hit that sweet spot.

What really separates this place from any other spot around town is the level of service. Ownership roams the floor greeting and conversing with customers. Nothing fake about it either. Wait staff is highly personable and the bartenders are friendly, knowledgeable and quick with a suggestion.

If you haven't checked out Rehab Burger Therapy yet, you are missing out!"}
{"text":"Burgers are creative and big! Came with a large group and the service was great. Really enjoyed the music they played and overall it was a nice restaurant. 

I can't say that I'd come back just because the burgers didn't have great flavor. I got to try at least 4 off the menu as well and in this case, bigger isn't always better."}
{"text":"THIS. PLACE. GETS IT!

Awesome start to finish. It's so great to find a place that appreciates their customers. 

Success in the restaurant business is tricky. You don't buy food, cook it, serve it, get paid and go out partying........ Sadly...that is the attitude at 7 out of 10 places, regardless of city/state....

Rehab Burgers is wonderful. Starting with the extremely friendly hostesses, the exceptionally friendly waitstaff, the amazing bartenders, and the whole time, the owners ARE ACTUALLY THERE, asking if everything is ok?

What a concept! Are you listening Scottsdale restaurant groups? (you know who you are)............So many places serve cheap food with an attitude, and get crowded for  happy hour 2-for-1 well drinks, and the doosh DJ playing loud house music from his jump-drive, wooo freaking hooo.......yes I am over 25....

Ok, anyway, went for Sunday afternoon Burger Rehab. Cold beer, reasonably priced, fresh burger, cooked the way i asked, fresh bun, amazing sweet potato tots, and homemade spicy ketchup (are you kidding me?)

The most important thing ............... staff... Exceeded expectations...

The food is great and reasonable. The staff is exceptional...
THAT IS WHAT BRINGS PEOPLE BACK......Best, Duke ........."}
{"text":"Love this place. Been here twice-once for lunch, once for dinner. The surfer/beach atmosphere sets a great mood. Love the reggae music! Staff has never let us down... Friendly & Attentive. The food is just off the wall. My husband always gets the McNarly burger which is what the McDonald's Big Mac in a 5star restaurant would be. I personally am addicted to the sweet potato tots. And they let you have whatever signature sauces you want. I love this place."}
{"text":"Totally unimpressed, was expecting a way better burger.   Way better burgers in town than this. Nothing special"}
{"text":"Tremendous burgers... good prices.  This may be the best burger place I've ever been to.  Not much to look at but boy is the meat fresh.  Highlight of my visit to ASU to see my son.  Wish we had one back here in Boston."}
{"text":"You don't need my review to know that these burgers are delicious and creative. But what I will add is the fact that they have a GF bun. It's often a great inconvenience to have to find a place that's serves anything GF. I was going to opt for lettuce wrap but glad they had an actual bun. Their sweet potato tater tots are delicious! I was really impressed overall. Highly recommend this place to try."}
{"text":"Some of the best burgers I've ever had! The jalapeño popper burger is my favorite, but the mac and cheese is a close second!"}
{"text":"Awesome fish tacos coming from a gal who does not like fish!!' Burgers are fabulously gigantic! You will not leave hungry!!"}
{"text":"The only reason this gets 2 stars is because of our server, Sarah. She made the whole experience not suck! We went for my husbands 30th birthday, only the two of us, and after we ordered appetizers and dinner as soon as we sat down, waited an hour for the wings to come out. People say after us were served their meals before the wings came out... Thank god he liked them. Another 50 minutes later dinner came out and it was cold, not even warm. They offered to remake things, Sarah was lovely, but sitting for 2.5 hours to get food is ridiculous. We agreed to have it remade, and paid for the meal. By that time neither of us were even hungry...it was our first time in, not sure if we will be back. So bummed!"}
{"text":"Rehab Burger has the best burgers in town in my book! From your simple cheeseburger to the most outrageous combinations possible. I love the selection of different buns and made in house sauces too. Can't beat the flavor of a fresh flame grilled burger. I knocked off one star only because once we ordered the clams as an appetizer (who orders clams in a burger place,i know :/ ). The white wine base wasn't reduced well enough, so instead of a subtle sweet hint of white wine was nowhere to be found, only the taste of acidic alcohol. Just remember to stick to their killer burgers and salads too!"}
{"text":"We had a great visit here, even with an issue with one of our meals.

We visited on a Monday night and were seated right away. Service was great. We had the salsa and chips for an appetizer, while I ordered a frozen margarita and my husband had Kiltlifter.

The problem arose with our son's order. It turned out that they were out of the bread they usually use for a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. We were given a choice of sourdough--which our server said most kids aren't crazy about--and brioche. We were hesitant, but decided to go with the brioche. It ended up just being way too thick for the kid to handle. We let him pull it apart and scraped off a lot of the filling, but the thick bread with PB was just too much. He couldn't manage more than a few bites. We were very pleased that we were comped for that sandwich without even us requesting it. The restaurant handled the whole matter very well.

Meanwhile, the grown-ups were delighted with their food. My husband had the Hatch burger and was in complete bliss. I had the Shelby's spinach salad with added chicken, and loved the blend of flavors. The chicken breast was perfectly grilled and quite large.

We'd definitely come here again, and maybe our son could have the PB&J, too!"}
{"text":"Peanut Butter Burger.... Yep, Amazing!!!  All of the Food here is great..."}
{"text":"This place is always packed but somehow we always get a table.  The service is terrific and the food is really good.  Too bad the patio is so small!"}
{"text":"Holy Cow this place is Phenomenal! Great Food, Service, Drinks, Atmosphere, Music...Great place to watch Football on a Monday Night! Definitely would recommend to anyone!"}
{"text":"If you are gonna be closed for some nonsense football game, how about a message on your voice mail? Rookie  mistake my friends..."}
{"text":"Rehab Burger Therapy was delicious. I got the Swiss mushroom burger, the burger was well seasoned and cooked a perfect medium. The restaurant was clean and had a California vibe. Overall this place was delicious and I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"I thought the bacon burger was very standard, so the 4 stars aren't really for that... the 4 stars are for the amazing wings!!! Best wings I've ever had! The service was great as well. We will be back!"}
{"text":"I can literally say that I don't have one complaint about this place. I don't eat red meat but I can tell you that their turkey burger is to die for and the pretzel bun is one of the best things I have ever eaten. Also, best bloody mary I have ever had in my life, and let me tell you I have had my share of bloody marys. I even get virgin ones because they are just THAT good. The sweet potato tots are out of this world, I'm getting hungry just thinking about them. All food aside, the service is amazing! The servers are so nice and friendly and accommodating, I was absolutely stunned. One day I came in extremelyyyyy hungover, so obviously hungry and the waitress took one look at me and knew I was dying. She literally whispered and purposely sat me at the furtherest table away from the bar so I wouldn't have to see any alcohol. LIKE REALLY? Talk about going above and beyond. Not to mention that we got our food in like 10 minutes! Sooo basically: amazing food, amazing service, and amazing price. My favorite place to eat in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"PB&J burger you are life changing. Initially we came here due to the high ratings we saw on yelp. There's a wide variety of different types of burgers to choose from. Everyone raved about the PB&J one and I was skeptical at first but I figured why not...

Best decision ever. The jam and pb were oozing out every bite and it was the perfect combo of sweet and savory. I also ordered sweet potato tots and they were the best tots that I've ever had. 

I'm not from Arizona but that meal is making me reconsider my residency. Jk. But you get the point it's that gooooood!"}
{"text":"Overall had a pretty good experience here. The service we had was awesome. We came in on a Thursday night around 6 or 6:30 so it was pretty relaxed and wasn't all that slammed aside from a company party sitting at the middle table. 

I had a Burger with a hatch chili on it and it was pretty good. One thing you always fear in burger shops in if they are going to cook your burger properly but mine was cooked perfect and so was the persons who came with me. The fries were good as well. Again no complaints. 

I know you are probably thinking, well you didn't complain about anything so why not 5 stars? Well the food was good. But it didn't wow me or anything. The food was good for the price and the service was great. Not the best burger I have ever had and definitely not the worst. 

The only caveat here is that if you are interested in just grabbing some food here it can be a bit of a pain because it is on Mill basically which means parking is extremely limited and you will more than likely have to pay to park to get here. 

Again, overall good quality place."}
{"text":"As a non red meat eater, I love Rehab. They offer many of there hamburgers with chicken or turckey. I personally love the Mac Gnarly Burger and sweet potatoes."}
{"text":"the pig wings!!! those were the best things there. the charred crispy exterior, spicy taste, complimented with pineapple sweetness, and then the meat just strips clean off the bone. UGH, it's like eating mini ribs that were cooked perfectly!!!

ya, the burger is good too. is it the best i've ever had? nope. BUT would it be a place i would come back again to order a burger from? yes. the burger wasn't overly juicy, the patty wasn't super thick so u can taste the rest of the burger, and the buns were good too. maybe if i ordered a burger with one of the house sauces it would have taken the burger to another level. that is exactly what i did when the server asked if we would like additional sauces so do it. ask for additional sauces. 

the sweet potato tots were pretty good. i'm not a sweet potato fan myself but my gf is so we ordered it. it wasn't as crispy as i would like it but it was crispy enough. i do like how they were perfectly bite sized though. 

the mac n cheese was alright but it's not something i would order again. it wasn't bad but it wasn't exactly great either.

service was very friendly and in a great timely manner. our server was very chill and attentive which pretty much set the mood. i wish they had one of these places in the bay so i can pig out on those pig wings with a beer while i watch a game."}
{"text":"The fiance and I had planned for a bike ride from Arcadia to Old Town and was searching Yelp for a good happy hour that ran on weekends too. So we came across Rehab Burger Therapy and we were sold since I had been wanting to try this place since its opened. The happy hour is pretty awesome, you can get domestic for $2 and premium beers for $3!! So we got a round of Blue Moons and I tried the Four Peak Peach ale while the fiance got the 8th street. OMG the peach ale was so good! We got hungry and decided to split a burger since we saw a bunch of appetizing looking burgers pass us to other tables. We agreed on trying the hatch chili burger and it was cooked perfectly. They had a lot of interesting sauces like spicy ketchup, teriyaki aoili and chipotle aoili. I smeared chipotle aoili on the burger and it was the perfect compliment to the charred taste of the burger. The fries were okay, we got half regular fries and half sweet potato tots. I will definitely return for more burgers, I am especially interested in trying their hangover burger since I love me some breakfast foods (it has a fried egg and bacon), and of course I'll be back for more happy hours!"}
{"text":"Indoor and outdoor seating. We sat outside on the patio which has misters, a nice touch on a warm evening. I ordered the relapse size Backyard BBQ burger with french fries. It was great. For this being the \"smaller\" sized burger.. it was definitely still a decent size!! I was hungry coming in and ate half. Our waitress was super nice and helpful. The only thing that kept me from a five star review was I asked for added bacon on my burger and did not get it.. I would have said something to the waitress but didn't happen see her again until we were finished eating."}
{"text":"Tried this for the first time today after wanting to since I've moved to Scottsdale. It was well worth the wait! I had a bacon cheeseburger on a pretzel bun and it was fantastic. The fries are just as good but the sweet potato tots weren't the best. The service was above average but I found it impressive how much they knew about every burger on the menu. They made good recommendations to the other guests around me that I over heard. Overall, I had a great experience and will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"This is the only gourmet burger place I'll go to. Not only is the food outstanding - but you get a crazy portion for the price. I love all the creative burger recipes, and I think I am addicted to the sweet potato tots. Great atmosphere as well. It can often be extremely crowded but I've never had a bad experience. The servers and bartenders are always friendly, working hard and are a fun group of people! This is a must do if you are visiting old town Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Went here for our first time! And it was delicious totally worth it!! Good vibe and chill waitresses.. Had Ariel as a waitress, really nice and chill.. Definitely coming back and is our new burger joint!!!"}
{"text":"Second time coming here and won't be my last! This time I had the wings.. did not take a pic but let me say they are juicy and flavorful! We got the spicy pineapple I believe. And the burger in the picture is the spicy Mac and cheese burger! Second time getting that burger!! This place is so cute! Waitresses are so sweet. The menu has a lot of choices and the alcohol as well! If you're in Scottsdale and want great food, come on over!!!"}
{"text":"Great staff, great atmosphere & fantastic food!  If I'm ever back in Old Towne, I will be stopping here again!"}
{"text":"PB and J Bacon Burger... \"Shut the Front Door\" Hands down best burger! Did I mention I travel and eat out 150+ days a year. Can't beat this place. Must stop every time I'm in Phoenix/Scottsdale areas. Club sandwich is good and massive. About to devour a spicy mac'n chz burger:)"}
{"text":"Average spot in my opinion.  Have been 3 times within the last year and normally order a fairly straight forward burger with some fries.  All 3 times the burger has been over cooked with not a lot of flavor.  2 times the fries were cold and limp.  It's not a terrible spot to put some food in your stomach if you're in old town, but there are several burger places well ahead of this one."}
{"text":"I think I may need to go to Rehab after eating this burger!  Just kidding.  I like the way they have a Hawaiian theme going on in here.  Guess everyone would like to rehab in Hawaii!

When I arrived, the host asked how many were in my party, I told him 9.  He said he's never seated a party that large before.  Hmmm.  Ok.  So, after discussing it with another person, they arranged to seat us just past the bar.  It worked out great!  They do have patio seating which might have been a better option, but I don't like any amount of warm weather, so I chose to be seated indoors.

The place was fairly easy to find, but it is located almost right next to the border of the ASU Campus. There's a parking garage on 6th Street (not free) if you can't find street parking.  

To dive into this place, figuring out what you want may be a feat in itself!  They offer so many types of burgers, some sound super crazy!  Don't worry, if you don't want a burger, they do offer salads, wings, pastas, and other sandwiches.  The Rehab size is a 10oz burger and the Relapse size is a 5 oz burger.  The cost difference is only $2.00, so it's worth it to get the Rehab size.  The burgers are just overloaded with so much stuff, it is almost easier to deconstruct it while eating it!  It's like getting an extra side!

I got a Hatch Burger (Relapse) with Ghost Pepper Jack Cheese.  They will make substitutions for you, or at least they did for me.  It was a very good burger because it was just like a cheeseburger with a chili, not over the top with toppings!  Everyone else seemed to enjoy their burgers, too!  You can change up or request extra sauces.  The Wasabi Mayo was killer!  Went extremely well with the Sweet PoTOTers!  Mmmmm!!

Here's a short funny... my Dad usually eats small items that are soft to chew.  He decided that a Tuna Salad Sammy would be harmless.  It was the tallest sandwich that was served!  Yes, it was soft, but he had to eat it with a fork to manage it better!  

Being right off the ASU Campus, there is a bar in here, too.  I didn't take a look to see what all they offered, but I'm sure you can get something to suit you.

They do take a little while to get your food to you, but it wasn't a terribly long wait.  We kept busy talking and visiting with each other.  This would be a great place to come to if you are in the area!"}
{"text":"This place is the real deal! From the patio to the murals on the walls to the awesome staff it's all 5-Star worthy! My favorite burger is the Spicy Mac and Cheese! You have to try it!"}
{"text":"Burgers, Babes, Booze & Beer. The 4B's. What else will give you that warm and fuzzy feeling inside.

The house decor is straight off the boardwalk. The guys and gals are laid back with that beach cruzer, surfer feeling.

The founders of Rehab Burger Therapy are Wiley Arnett, Ken Likewise and Denise Nelson, who had been with Oregano's Pizza Bistro for the past 18 years and decided to do their own thing.

The menu is small but the burgers are large.

The meat was fresh ground and not over worked with seasonings. The burger patty was formed perfectly, thick and very moist. The cheese was also perfectly melted. There was a double portion of fries.

To wash down this tasty burger, I ordered a Four Peaks 8th Street Ale. Poured into a clean thick glass, it has a clear amber color with a medium head that laced nicely. Aroma is mild, with some hops as well as a slight malt finish.

I believe the trio knows how to get good food to the table."}
{"text":"This is the second time I've been here and it's been great both times! Sometimes it gets busy and loud but the music it's good and the servers are super nice!

The first time I had the Jalapeño Popper Burger and this last time was the Spicy Mac n Cheese Burger. The meat cane cooked the way I asked!

The only reason it wasn't a 5-Star was that the tots came out soggy and the mac n cheese wasn't really spicy, but I'd definitely go again!"}
{"text":"Yummmm yummy yummy yum yum Mac and cheese burger to die for. Split the burger  still stuffed tots tots tots we'll worth any wait time."}
{"text":"We came on a Sunday afternoon and had to wait about 25 minutes for a party of two. There is parking along downtown: there's a parking lot right next to the restaurant (with underground parking) and there's also three hour parking along the streets.

They have happy hour 11am-6pm daily and all day Thursday. You can check in and get chips and salsa for $3.99.

PIG WINGS ($11.50) - They give about 8 pig wings per order. I really enjoyed the tenderness of the wing along with the sweetness and spiciness of the sauce. It was literally fall off the bone which is always a good sign. 4/5

SPICY MAC-N-CHEESE BURGER ($15.50, REHAB) - There are two different sizes of burger patties: 10oz Rehab and 5oz Relapse. We got the rehab because we were splitting the burger. I expected the burger to be spicier than it was given that spicy is in the name of the burger. The mac n cheese didn't have as much cheesiness or just taste in general. There were a couple jalapenos but even those weren't really spicy. 3.5/5

SWEET POTOTOES - We ordered these alongside our burger and oh my goodness these are so addicting. I could eat these for days and would never get enough of them. I loved dipping them in the orange-colored sauce (don't know what it is but it was delicious together). 5/5

If you're from the SoCal area, this place reminds me a lot of PB Cantina and Cabo Cantina in terms of their decorations and drinks. Their happy hours are a lot better but Rehab has much better burgers and other foods and isn't only a place to get wasted but a family friendly place to get lunch or dinner (doesn't mean you can't get wasted here though because their margaritas are good and strong)."}
{"text":"Had the pbj burger! It was so good glad I took the chance and tried something daring!"}
{"text":"My mom and I visited Rehab during a recent trip to the area for spring training. It was crowded, and there was a wait, but they were extremely accurate with their estimate, and we were able to walk around Old Town a little bit before we were seated.

Our server was wonderful - that perfect combination of chatty and unobtrusive, helpful and not annoying.

We started with chips and salsa as something to snack on, and they were good. I loved that there were two sizes of burgers to account for all appetites. I ended up having the chili cheeseburger with fries. It was actually not so messy that I couldn't pick it up and eat it on the bun - a rare feat for a chili cheeseburger.

The beer was cold, the food was good, and despite the crowd, we never felt hurried or neglected. Rehab is definitely worth a revisit the next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Peanut butter and jelly...mac and cheese, burger sound good...welp it was! Tater tots fries are kinda a desired taste as they are kinda sweet maybe if they were paired with a spicy ketchup they'd have been better...but the mac was delicious! The drinks were good and there's a nice (when the sun is down) patio. There were lots of options and dozens of combinations yum! If you haven't tried it you should!"}
{"text":"Best burger in Phoenix. The PB&J Siracha burger is delicious, even though it sounds weird, it's the best burger ever."}
{"text":"Probably the best joint to get a veggie burger in all of PHX. Nearly every burger can be modified to fit the needs of vegetarian and vegan customers and I'm never disappointed! Love that veggie items aren't an afterthought at Rehab!"}
{"text":"BEST WINGS IN SCOTTSDALE. I'm not kidding. My boyfriend and I have been coming here since before we even lived in the state of Arizona. We've finally gotten our orders down. At first, we'd order a little bit of everything and be absolutely stuffed about halfway through. Now, we stick with splitting a caesar salad and each ordering 6 wings. I'm obsessed with the gold medal sauce (don't like spicy things); like...I'd like to take a bath in it. Such a fun spot, great location and Sunday happy hour! Do yourself a favor and stop in. Also, I don't eat red meat but every single person I've talked to about this place has recommended just about every burger, so I assume those are great too. They're also dog friendly!"}
{"text":"Just get the PB and J burger.  It sounds crazy but it's probably one of the best burgers I've ever had.  Love it.  Pasta is okay.  I would just stick to the burgers."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointing.  I am really surprised by the good reviews.  The 5 of us were seated.  No napkins, silverware, etc.  We ordered 3 burgers, 1 chicken sandwich and 1 hot dog.  All three burgers were cooked above ordered level.  All three burgers were so dry, you thought  you were eating saw dust.  Also the flavor of the meat was nothing special.  Seriously people, you must be kidding if you think this is a good burger.  I bet if you try just the burger, without all the toppings, you will realize the burger is not so good.  Maybe this is why they offer so many burgers with toppings.  Oh, after our burgers came, and asking twice, our napkins and silverware came.  My son liked the hot dog.  My daughter thought the chicken was overcooked and dry (I could see burnt pieces).

The onion rings were excellent.  The sweet potato tots were really good.  This is why I gave it 2 stars, otherwise, I would have given this place a 1 star.  

We planned on ordering dessert.  The waitress came by, in passing, and dropped off our check while our main plates were still on the table.  We thus assumed she did not want us to order dessert, and we left."}
{"text":"Great burgers with many different options for toppings. I was torn between the chili burger and the PBJ & bacon burger. I went with the chili burger (10oz) and was not disappointed!  My wife, a vegetarian, had the pesto pasta and she said it was terrific. We will definitely be back to try the other imaginatively constructed burgers."}
{"text":"Went for lunch on a Friday in a small group during the workday.

Got calamari for an appetizer round.  Breading was great, good flavor, and dip wasn't half bad especially when combined with their special hot sauce (I guess they also sell it at $5 a bottle - spicy / sweet).

Each of us got a small burger (they're all available in large / small which is great), but unfortunately each of our medium ordered burgers came back well done.  I imagine such a smaller burger would be tough to cook appropriately, but I would hope that a place that specializes in burgers could figure out proper times on these things.  I had the same issue at another burger joint (not to be named in this review).  That sort of thing just blows my mind.

In the end, we'd prefer burgers cooked to order, but we're not terribly picky.  Everything else about the burgers was top notch.  Our server was very friendly, outgoing and helpful - when she overheard a comment about the burgers (seriously, we weren't ones to complain) she offered to comp the meals which we didn't want - ended up hooking us up with milkshakes (also quite good).

Oh, I can't believe I'm leaving this for the last item on my review - but the sweet potato tots.  Oh, the sweet potato tots!  I'll come back here often for those alone.  The texture and the taste, and the dipping sauces...  Amazing!"}
{"text":"Oh, my g-d!! This is a major delicious burger! I had the Poblano Burger. Huge! Tasty! They have a big selection, if you can't find a good burger here you don't need one. Lol."}
{"text":"The best burger I've had in a long time.  I ordered the rehab burger with the egg.  It was amazing.   Great menu choices to be flexible to choose your own bun and substitute for chicken and turkey as well."}
{"text":"Love the food here! Some odd burgers like the PB&J with Sriracha burger....but it was amazing!! The desserts are simply delicious! I really enjoyed the pot brownie.... not what it sounds like lol"}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this place through yelp and I'm glad I did. Great service, the bartender recommended the PBJ&Bacon burger on pretzel bun, amazing! Definitely coming back next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"I'd been wanting to come here for a while. Sadly, I was watching my diet so I did not get a burger, but next time for sure. I did however get the recommended tacos and was pleasantly surprised. You get three and can choose all three meat options. So of course I got them all. My favorite was the beer battered fish. It was definitely beer battered. Everyone I came with got a burger and was elated. So good job Rehab!"}
{"text":"We came here on Cinco de Mayo for dinner.  The place was packed but they were ready us since we made a reservation.  It was a noisy and loud evening with several sports events on the television screens.  

Our group of five ordered several different burgers from their creative menu. My Hatch Burger was very good.  I got the 10oz Rehab not the 5oz Relapse version.  The burger consisted of 2 or 3 large pieces of grilled green chile peppers of the famous New Mexico Hatch variety, melted cheddar cheese and chipotle mayo.  I went with the whole wheat bun option.  Delicious!  The bun held together even with the juicy meat and mayo.  The fries that accompanied the burgers were also good

I tasted the Bacon and Blue which was a little dry.  The bacon and blue cheese are inside the meat.  I wished they had been on top.  

I also sampled the Ghost Burger.  It is made with two 5oz patties.  I was sure it would be too hot. The chilies are actually in the cheese and added a great spicy flavor to the meat.  An order of the tater tot like sweet potatoes were a very nice addition.  The are well prepared and tasted much better than I imagined they would. 

The place had good quick service even on a crazy evening like Cinco."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Great music! Even better service! Ryan was awesome! Poblano burger was the bomb.com!"}
{"text":"PB&J burger is incredible. Outdoor seating was nice and the waitress was super attentive. Was very pleased with the experience."}
{"text":"I was so excited to come try this place with all the great reviews while on vacation . This place is nice also great music but with that said the mushroom Swiss burger wasn't very good , was dried out and not hot. Server was chatting away with other employees and wasn't doing his job/ bad service. One the good side the sweet potato tots were great !!! Maybe it was just the server and the mushroom and Swiss burger but I would not recommend this place !"}
{"text":"This is a really goid place to bring friends and travelers for many types of burgers. I can't wait to try the drinks!"}
{"text":"One of the best burgers I've ever eaten.  I had the spicy Mac and cheese, 10 oz burger (well done) and sweet potato tater tots."}
{"text":"We got take out from here, called it in and they said it would be ready in 20 minutes, got there in 15 and had to wait a couple. Drove home 5 minutes away and fries were cold and burger was over cooked ... It was OK"}
{"text":"Either table service or sit at the bar to enjoy lunch, dinner or a late night meal."}
{"text":"Great burgers! When you ask for Medium Rare, you actually get a medium rare burger!! Not overcooked! Great price for such big burgers. Great onions rings and fries too!
One of the best burgers I have had in a very long long time!"}
{"text":"I had the peanut butter and jelly and bacon burger! It was amazing! Definitely recommend the sweet potato tots and the aoili sauce. I found the waitress funny and really kind. Definitely a place I will bring my husband to when we come back! Next time I want to try the mac and cheese burger"}
{"text":"Stuffed Bacon and blue burger ALL DAY.  One of the best burgers I have ever had.  Oh, and the sweet potato tots.. get them."}
{"text":"Peanut butter and jelly burger with bacon and sriracha? Yes please! The burger was awesome but if I have one knock it would be the fries not being hot. Warmish is not good for fries, it was pretty busy so we didn't make a stink. 
Great place with a lot of character and attentive servers."}
{"text":"The burgers here are great and have an awesome and interesting selection. The sweet potato tater tots are delicious, and the decor of this place is great. The downside is the service was awful, the server I had had an attitude and the alcohol selection left a lot to be desired. Oh well will give it another shot later on when I get a chance, but won't be drinking here."}
{"text":"I had the Hangover burger (fried egg, bacon, cheese, and green chili). The relapse size was perfect, the rehab size would have been way too much. The burger comes with a side of fries or tots. I got the fries. They were good but nothing to rave about. I like to have my fries with a side of honey mustard but they didn't have any, so that was kind of annoying. No big deal though. 

There is outdoor seating. A lot of customers had their dogs with them. Super cute. 

I would recommend this restaurant to others. The food was good, the atmosphere was fun, and the service was quick and friendly."}
{"text":"Great food. Very busy so get there early. We ordered the pig wings which were so good I had to go back the next day for more. We also had PBJ burger which was pretty good too. The last thing we had was the pot brownie. The pot brownie I got to go and it was amazing. I can't imagine how good it would have been if I had it there."}
{"text":"This place is pretty damn good. I tried the mushroom and Swiss burger and it was very flavorful. The onion rings were just as good. We had to wait for about 20 minutes and our big boobed waitress was a little slow but other than that everything was great. Definitely recommend"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch no wait required the wedge salad was excellent and I should have stopped with that my burger was not good at all the service was great for good service was very good what I go there again wouldn't be my first choice but I probably would give it another try it may have been an off-day however the price for what it is it's not worth it in my opinion"}
{"text":"I haven't felt relaxed in a long time, but sitting down (wait was 30 minutes), outside with my glass of wine, hearing the familiar tunes of my home (Hawaii), I felt my body completely relax. Our waitress was amazing! She was so friendly and helpful, as this was our first time. We didn't get appetizers because we knew some awesomeness was on its way.  I chose a bacon cheeseburger with onion rings, hubby got the pbj burger with fries, MIL got the ghost burger with sweet potato fries and her boyfriend got the bigger beefstro burger with the corn on the cob. All of the sides and burgers were so good!! We saved room for the pot brownies with ice cream. Omg. Best dessert ever! Everything came at a decent time and everything was wonderful and relaxing. We will definitely be back to try new things!"}
{"text":"Nice location. We enjoyed sitting on the patio.  Our burgers were cooked to our liking ( well done). My friend got the burger with peanut butter and jelly and said it was delicious. It sure looked good! 

My main reason for writing this review is for others with celiacs disease- I decided to try rehab burger after discovering that they had a gf bun and was able to access a list of their gluten free offerings online. I was excited to try! Unfortunately the waiter we had knew very very little about what was offered and that right off the bat made me nervous. All  he knew is that the burger patty wasn't spiced with anything with gluten in it. Otherwise I read off the online list- really the only options turned out to be the build a burger or salad.  I got the build your own burger...Fries were not gf so I subbed a side salad with my burger...after extensive conversation with the server the salad still came out with croutons on it :/ The burger was decent. Not something that would make me return in and of itself.  At the end of the meal and my salad was pushed to the side untouched the the server gave me a funny look then apparently realized that I ordered it without croutons. He was a nice enough guy so I just said don't worry about it (I was a little disappointed to see that he hadn't subtracted it from the bill however as it was an additional charge to have the salad instead or fries for a side).

Overall this seems like nice enough place, just not for those looking for gf options. It's curious to me that they offer a gf bun but are not very gf friendly otherwise."}
{"text":"Low-key, island-feel burger bar. Quite busy during dinnertime weeknights.

Mac-and-cheese burger is two meals in itself - pretty tasty with the Pablano peppers. Onion rings were a bit over breaded. Sweet potato tots were overly sweet for my liking, the island corn was tasty. Next time we'll try the PB&J burger."}
{"text":"Really great burgers with combinations that sound strange but are AMAZING!!!  Please try the peanut butter and jelly burger. 

Service was so-so - bartenders were good enough."}
{"text":"been great everytime weve gone, good wings too! just like organoes wings"}
{"text":"Love the overflowing tater tots. My fave by far. Sometimes I use the big Baba Booey soup spoon to just scoop up about 6-7 per bite-nothing beats mouthful after mouthful of tater tots. I pretend I'm eating a giant bowl of oatmeal, only it's tater tots."}
{"text":"I came here after RnR was too busy and i ordered the quesadilla and portabello burger and both were delicious. The server we had was awesome and a riot. The happy hour is great and def choose this over RnR."}
{"text":"The service is good. Onion rings came out fast and are thick, juicy, and beer battered to perfection. They don't have kilt lifter anymore, but plenty of other beer. The hangover burger is really great. Just messy. The egg will pop when you bite in the first time. I will certainly visit again next time I am in town. Our waitress Melanie was fantastic."}
{"text":"Loved the beach-themed interior decor. Even on a busy, Fathers' Day lunch there was room at the bar and plenty of time to order. I absolutely loved what I saw on the menu; specialty burgers topped with mac and cheese, or peanut butter and jelly and all sorts of other crazy stuff that people must go wild for! Though we were apprehensive to try those ones, we did grab a BBQ/Onion Ring Burger and the Hatch Chile Burger (not sure if that's what they're actually called). The flavor was outstanding in both, but neither burger was cooked the way they were ordered. In fact, one of them was so dry it was difficult to eat. I am pretty confident that our overdone burger was an uncommon incident, so this place deserves a second chance. I'll certainly be back, and hope to dive deeper into the menu when I return.  Sunday was a memorable experience, for sure, however I wish we'd left the place with more in our stomachs than in the take-home containers."}
{"text":"This place has excellent burgers in two different sizes. All different combos that include the mouth watering PB and J burger. Their onion rings and tater tots are good. The cocktails are just so-so including watery margaritas. Stick to beer.    Its always busy so plan to wait during peak times, but you will enjoy it as you can get your burger fix on."}
{"text":"A good burger is hard to find - Flannery O'Connor

Okay, O'Connor didn't say this. . . but if she had Rehab Burger then I am pretty sure literature would be a bit different.

A co-worker and I decided to give Rehab a try after I read a few reviews. One thing about me: burgers are something I crave, not necessarily a frequent on my to-eat list.

My friend ordered the Porkster and I ordered the Hangover. 

   1)  Each burger patty was seasoned to perfection. 
    2)  The chef understood what a medium burger should be and it was perfect
    3)  The Porkster was great if you really enjoy meats. To be honest, I could have had  
          the pulled pork alone. The burger patty was just more awesome under a bun
     4) The Hangover was devoured by my co-worker (we split our burger in halves and   
          shared) but I felt like something was missing. I would have preferred to have      
          some sort of spicy...something on it . . .or a bit more cheese. Next time, I'll think    
          about the sauces they provide and request something different. 
      5) Order the sweet potato fries and make sure they give this white sauce to dip 
          'em. I am pretty sure that sauce is made from love and a dash of Heaven.

We arrived before the restaurant started pouring in with customers (around noon) so if you're wanting a quick in and out lunch, I am not so sure this is the place.

All around you get what you pay for. I couldn't finish half of my Rehab burger and had a lot of Tots left over. Go there and expect to be satisfied!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here...Momster had a Turkey Burger and I had the Chicken Caesar Salad. The prices were reasonable, the service was fine and we wound up taking most of our meals home. The atmosphere was very relaxed, and the owner would check in on us to make sure things were going well. This was in addition to our server's inquiries. They have a nice, varied menu and you feel like you want to settle in. It was crazy hot when we were in Scottsdale and I love the heat, but it seemed like the air was a bit too much. That's a small quibble given the rest of the experience. Next time (and there will be a next time), we'll just sit outside and enjoy the misters!"}
{"text":"The service was very very slow. The waitresses and hostesses were dressed very young and not very professional. (I get this is a chill restaurant with a chill vibe, but when the employees look like they just left the gym with tight spandex leggings, form-fitting tank tops, and messy buns, I couldn't tell who worked there and who was dining there). However, the sweet potato tots were TO DIE FOR (I found myself craving them weeks later) and the burger was really good. I will definitely be back to try the PBJ & Bacon Burger that everyone has raved about, but the slow service could absolutely use some improvement."}
{"text":"I came here with five of my friends. This place is normally pretty packed and you'll end up waiting in line a pretty long time. The burgers you get here are honestly the most unique burgers I've  Ever seen . They have a peanut butter burger and a bunch of other ones that I'm sure you guys have never tasted. So if you're down to try new stuff I love burgers got a pop into this place. I think this burger place was maybe just a little too much for me. That's why gave them only three stars it's a personal opinion. Sometimes I like my burgers more simple"}
{"text":"A fine addition to the old town food scene. Top quality burgers, beer, service and decor. This is a relaxing place to hangout with friends/family. Try the chicken wings and the wedge salad (not on the menu). They also have a nice patio for the cooler months."}
{"text":"Rehab is awesome. What can I say that hasn't been said? It's all true. I love pretzel buns and the PBnJ burger will surprise you, it's actually damn good!"}
{"text":"I was in Arizona for the weekend and happened to find this spot on yelp! It definitely didn't disappoint! I got the hangover burger....it was delish!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! My boyfriend had the Mac n cheese Siracha burger and I had a regular cheeseburger, but both were amazing. Definitely a must try place!"}
{"text":"My friend would have given this a 5+.  I am sticking to a 4.  Whether you eat inside it out it has great ambience.  What a fun place to go with excellent staff and service.  The burgers were great.  I had the poblano burger and my friend had the blue cheese and bacon burger.  Both burgers were excellent. I am knocking it down one star for the wings. People raved about them.  Not me....mine must have come from a hen as they were what I would call skinny wings.  No meat and all bones.  I will definitely come back.  One other issue is that the head is a one staller.  Don't like to wait when duty calls."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, cool atmosphere! 

Came for an early lunch right when the place opened and all the staff seemed pretty cool. Built our own burgers and tried out all the sauces. Really good! Def recommend this place for a cool restaurant with a great burger!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Burgers are outrageously great. Fish sandwich rocks too.  Service could be better but well worth the drive we make from QC on a regular basis."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a great place that has great food, then Rehab Burger is the place!  They have the friendliest staff and great happy hour specials.  I have been here several times and I have not been disappointed.  They have happy every day with fantastic specials.  I highly recommend their frozen Margaritas!  The Skinny drinks are amazing too.  

They have a great menu to make any customer happy.  They have a burger menu that allows customers to sub any Rehab Burger with a turkey burger or grilled chicken breast at no additional cost.  I am a huge fan of the Turkey Burger.  I tried the Bacon Cheese Turkey Burger with Sweet Potato tots.  The server recommended Manchego cheese and I thank him for this great suggestion.  The Mushroom and Swiss Turkey Burger was full of flavor and delicious.  The sweet potato tots are the perfect size.  They offer several dipping sauces for the fries and tots.  My favorites include Pineapple Teryaki Aioli, Chipotle Aioli, and , Chipotle Ranch.  

I think the secret is out about Rehab Burger.  It does get busy but it is worth the wait.  This is a great place to grab a bite to eat with friends."}
{"text":"After reading some of the previous reviews . . . this place was definitely one burger joint that was on my to visit list . . . loved the curb appeal, and the inside decor was great . . . the food . . . well, how do I say it . . . not so special.

I ordered the Hatch Chili Cheese Burger Rehab on a prezel roll with Sweet Potato Tots . . .  when it arrived . . . it looked unbelievable . . . but the taste . . . kinda bland, seemed to lack any kind of seasoning . . . ordered it medium so that it would be nice and juicy . . . kinda dry, and while it was cooked to medium, it appeared to be a much leaner burger than I was expecting, and the pretzel bun . . . tasted kinda stale.  The sweet potato tots we okay . . . but again nothing special.

Will I ever visit Rehab Burger again . . . probably . . . but maybe if I sat at the bar and had a couple of adult beverages first . . . the burger and tots would taste better."}
{"text":"I'm genuinely excited that one of my favorite Burger joints came to Mill!

I love Rehab Burger,  and especially their green chile version as well as peanut butter and jelly.

Don't let the location daunt you. It's hidden- but worth the hunt.

Please give Rehab the love it deserves!"}
{"text":"Wow!  This place did not let me down.  Respect to whoever came up with the hamburger ideas and more.  I wish I had one near my house in Utah.  Bravo! Bravooooooo!"}
{"text":"Tough week at work....had to have some rehab.....Rehab Burger that is!

Location & Aesthetics - Located on E. 2nd St. in Scottsdale which was a bit of trip for me from my usually stomping ground in the West Valley but it was worth the drive.
Parking is a bit of a mystery as I couldn't figure out where I was allowed to park.  There weren't any signs where patrons was instructed to park so I just followed the crowd and parked across the street where there was a large parking lot.  
The restaurant itself looks small on the outside and even the outside patio with its fans and misters was small and seemed crowded with the arrangement of the tables and chairs being in close proximity to each other.  The inside was the same - small.  
Another mystery was how customers were seated.  For example, from my observations, a party of two was sometimes seated at a table with four chairs with the two other chairs being unused.  On the other hand, I noticed a party of two with a kid was seated at the long table - a long table with a slew of high chairs on either side of it, where the couple was supposed to sit opposite each other and not side-by-side.
The couple with the kid had to put their kid on one of those high chairs which, in my opinion, didn't look too safe or too comfortable.
The way the chairs are bunched up together at the long table, was in close proximity to each other, meaning that on a day when the place might be packed, I could envision folks sitting elbow-to-elbow at said long table which is really not comforting in my opinion!  (-1)
Thankfully, when we went (on a Friday evening), there wasn't anyone sitting immediately next to us at this long table but rather a chair over from us on either side which didn't make the situation stifling.

Menus - The usual, given upon arrival and when you're seated.  Very large, self-explanatory, and easy to understand.  

Service - The staff was nice, friendly, warm, welcoming, and answered any questions we had about the meals.
Our waitress was prompt with introducing herself to us upon being seated, and was also prompt with the complimentary glasses of water (which tasted stale), and our drinks.
Despite having folks around us and having their orders taken after our orders, we did notice that our orders came well after theirs but it wasn't unnerving.


Food - The burgers were very tasty and creative.  I like the fact the have their own names, sizes (only 2 - Rehab or Relapse), their own particular and peculiar set of ingredients which I think makes each one a unique creation and a taste unto itself.
I ordered the BBQ Burger but couldn't tell if it was a Relapse size or a Rehab size as I had forgotten to mention it to the waitress but nonetheless it tasted superbly.
I also like you can choose the type of bun to go along with your burger.  Unfortunately, for sides, you're only allowed fries or sweet potato tots (two dipping sauces supplied with it); the latter was very tasty.

I can see the great variety in their burger creations can possibly bring me back despite the place being small."}
{"text":"Visited this establishment last night, my second visit. I had been here with an out of town friend over the holidays for cocktails but did not eat on that occasion. Last night we ordered burgers, my friend got the Chili Cheeseburger and french fries, I ordered the Hatch Green Chile Burger with fries, on a GF bun. It was really not tasty at all. I didn't even finish it. The fries were meh. My friend said his burger was ok but not the greatest chili burger he's had. I think this place really hopes you will down a couple of their tequila shooters from their extensive list so that you won't know how awful the burgers really are. Our server, although polite, was clearly paying more attention to other tables, from what we heard they sounded like regulars, or maybe friends of hers. The atmosphere is trendy and fun, too bad the food is not comparable."}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere of this place. The rehab burgers themselves are huge.  We ate the MacGnarly burger from the recommendation of the waitress (she said it was their version of the Big Mac).  It seemed like everyone in the restaurant gasped when she placed it in front of me since it was easily over half a foot tall.  It was messy, difficult to eat and the flavor didn't blow me away.  Now the PBJ burger was a different story.  I ordered it on the recommendation of yelpers and was very scared to eat this burger that was dripping with hot peanut butter.  I have to say though that I was pleasantly surprised and gobbled that thing up.  I also enjoyed my friend's pulled pork sandwich which was spicy and the onion rings.  The sweet potato tots were a little bland to me.  All in all a cool place and would love to go back when I'm in town again."}
{"text":"Happy hour is the way to go. $1.50 modelo especial in the can! And then $2 off signature cocktails and similar for appetizers as well. The green Chile chicken cheese dip was amazing and my turkey sandwich with sprouts, harvarti, onion and tomato on beach toast was sooo good and crazy big I could only finish half the sandwich. Also tried their frozen margarita which was pretty good, not crazy strong but it had good flavor to it(on the sweeter side). Alyssa was an awesome server! Attentive but not overbearing! Obviously their a newer restaurant so you gotta cut them slack, but there was nothing to cut them slack on. Everything was awesome! Will definitely back!"}
{"text":"First of all my review is based on the service.  Not the food.  The food was AMAZING!!!!! Brought my husband and 2 kids. The drinks were not good. We had tea and soda.  Soda was thick n syrupy w little carbonation (coke) the tea looked ok but had no flavor at all.  I've seen more flavor in a Lipton used tea bag. The food came out as ordered in a timely manner. And beautiful. A feast for both the stomach and the eyes. So we start eating. And we'll our drinks was empty. For 10 mins n no refills.  Looked around the room and I also noticed that everyone else also had empty glasses with just ice. They don't check up on you during meal.  You have to get their attention and that's hard in such a loud room. So a while passes and our waitress is finally passing by and snagging her attention. But we was already done eating and also requested boxes. Note: the rehab size is a very ambitious serving, huge. So we get our boxes. And pack up the food.  But still so check.  So another 15 mins goes by.  And we finally have to ask for the check. The wait staff doesn't pay attention to their customers for drinks or checks.  Not rude. But definitely not conscientious. Or personable. We loved the food. But next time we gonna try the Tempe location. See how service is there.  As for here it's a one n done. Off note: those of you w kids that are picky, they do not have American cheese. Nothing to complain about there. Just FYI."}
{"text":"The PB&J burger is one of my favorite burgers ever and I always look forward to coming here. I also really love the Mac n cheese burger. The staff are friendly and helpful which is always nice. Oddly enough, the tortilla chips and guac are especially good for a burger place. Also, make sure you get the ice cream brownie desert!"}
{"text":"Went here a few year ago as I moved to AZ. Their atmosphere is friendly and their Mac and cheese burger was all I wanted in the world. I enjoyed everything but the parking experience, which had to be done next door in public parking. Nothing wrong with that but I didn't really know what to expect!"}
{"text":"The Hangover Burger is LEGIT- fried egg, bacon, colby jack cheese and hatch green chili. They also have a PB&J with bacon and siracha for anyone brave enough to try it."}
{"text":"Very good. Excellent service. The PB&J bacon cheeseburger was delicious! Had a very nice experience."}
{"text":"Last night was first time there and OMG I was craving a good burger and it hit the spot I sat at the bar and the guy bartender suggested I tried the Mac n cheese burger  and I'm hooked I'll be coming back and bringing some friends it's nice when the staff knows the menu!"}
{"text":"Went to this place after RnR was too crowded, plus 45 minute wait.  Love the beach house decor, very friendly staff and great food.   Perfect place to post up for a sunday funday. I can remember what it was called, but I had a burger with an egg in it and it was Great!! I will definately be back."}
{"text":"AMAZING burger! I had the swiss and mushrooms, on pretzel buns. Perfect! I liked the sweet potato tots, but I would have  liked even more if they were crispier. I keep the 5 * for the outstanding burger"}
{"text":"Great tots. Great gluten free bun."}
{"text":"We took our kids and sat on the patio. Very fun and the food was great! High quality burgers and fries. The sweet potato tots were yummy!!"}
{"text":"The service was great. I was seated right away and everyone kept up with my table. The music and atmosphere were good too. The blue cheese burger I ordered sucked terribly. There was more shredded lettuce then burger and no blue cheese or bacon. When I called the waiter back he said it's cooked into the dry ass patty they served. So disappointed, the did bring me some blue cheese to put in it but come on. It was the driest hockey puck of q burger and if I wasn't 9 months pregnant and starving at the time I would've sent it back and ordered something else."}
{"text":"Easy going restaurant with few outside tables, Phoenix weather in October is perfect in the evening! Extensive menu. Chicken wings with BBQ sauce are some of the best we've had. The little stubby pork ribs are bbq-ed to perfection. As for the Burgers, they are incredible in taste, size, cheese, condiments, bread and dressings, the fries, side salad and sweet potatoes tats were great too.  Awesome service.  The lady was so nice.  The owner came and checked that we are happy with the food.

This is a feature of Phoenix and needs to be in all guide books and websites. A real Phoenix gem!"}
{"text":"If you're into a huge variety of burgers (with ability to substitute red meat for a Turkey Burger, Grilled Chicken Breast, Beef Chorizo Patty or Veggie Burger) and BONUS, it doesn't cost extra, then you'll love Rehab Burger! I know if I come here hungry I'm going to leave with some leftovers; they do not skimp on the portions. My husband got the Ghost Burger and he absolutely devoured it as he loves spicy things and has gotten it twice in a row now; I got the Hawaiian burger and that with the pineapple teriyaki just bring all of the flavors together so well.

They have a huge variety of sauces, their french fries are out of this world, and their drinks are delish!

The place itself has such a cool ambiance. The way it's decorated-it's like you stepped into a restaurant off the beach somewhere, and the staff have such a laid-back vibe and are so helpful with menu suggestions, they definitely have our business and we will keep coming back for a long time to come!"}
{"text":"Went here at noon on Wednesday with a party of 9 people. I ordered hangover burger 10 oz, pretzel bun, with onion ring

-restroom has real towel

The bad

{"text":"Seriously one of the best burgers I have ever tried! I had the Hawaiian Burger, it was perfection! Also, their sweet potato tots- amazing, again the best ever!"}
{"text":"This is a really well run restaurant, and creative. The host was really on top of his game during a busy dinner period,  and the service was fast. But, with so many great places in old town this just doesn't quite measure up.

The alcohol selection leaves a bit to be desired in terms of variety.   There are however, a lot of different, and unique burgers here. I tried the PB and J burger. I was hesitant to try it because I wasn't convinced the textures/flavors would win me over like it has for others who reviewed this restaurant.  Personally, the thickness of the peanut butter made it difficult for me to enjoy. I wouldn't order it again,  but it was worth trying.  

Overall,  its a nice place to stop in if you're feeling adventurous and craving a different kind of burger from the norm."}
{"text":"This was One of our favorite places to take friends and family. The burgers are great. We took my daughter and her husband and 2 small sons at Christmas time and received horrible service. We basically had to get up and get our own water, ketchup, and silverware. They wait for service and food was miserable and not pleasant with children. I hope they have improved service because I'm scared to go back. They gave all their attention to a table that was drinking continuously. Wow...how about us over here? Very obvious we were bugged but the more we asked for necessary things the worse our service got. I was embarrassed as I had raved about this place and they didn't deliver."}
{"text":"We love Rehab Burger Therapy!  Excellent food, great service and fun atmosphere.  This is my favorite place to have lunch with my family and friends.."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to not only eat, but to hang out. It has such a great atmosphere to hang out with friends. Their PBnJ burger is one of my favorites. The staff there is always friendly. Our last server was Kaye who is the depiction of a great server."}
{"text":"The  servers were friendly and all ,  the  chips and salsa were  pretty good  spiced up  just right,  the burger was present well  but  was very dry,  and not really tasty ,  Id probably come back for a beer or something  but won't overly  impressed with the burgers"}
{"text":"If you eat here regularly and you eat a rehab burger (not a relapse burger) expect to gain about 20 pounds per week. 
The 10-ounce rehab burger, which comes in many mouth-watering disguises, is not a burger for the meek. It starts at about 5 inches in height and, if served with a pretzel bun and a variety of added toppings, it may reach a staggering 10 inches in height. You will find it a challenge to get your mouth around it and when you do be prepared to catch the juices that slop out of the enormous concoction.
You want fries with that? Of course you do, especially as they come automatically with your burger. You can have regular fries or sweet potato tots.
Chips and salsa--why not.
Beer-what the heck, go for broke.
Enjoy this exceptional burger joint with its surfing, motor-cycling and California style decor.
The waitresses are all very attentive and will serve you with a smile.
There is outdoor seating but I don't recommend eating there during the summer as it will be really hot out there.
This is a primo burger restaurant that knows how to serve you a man-size succulent repast. If you aren't that hungry order a relapse burger as it will only be five ounces and it will still fill you up."}
{"text":"We sat outside & had a really fun & tasty experience. They were very busy & managed the crowd very well. We ordered the specialty burger that's prepared with 5 oz of beef & another 5 oz of taco meat, Doritos, cheese & burger dressings on a pretzel bun!!!! Yum. We shared it & still had 1/2 left, it was huge! We also ordered the specialty corona/margarita, which was perfect. The staff was friendly. Onion rings are huge & wonderful!!"}
{"text":"Burger Rehab therapy. I have been to your place three times and have never been disappointed. Your staff is friendly, you all are inclusive with your patrons and you make amazing burgers! What matters the most about reviews In a restaurant is the service and the quality of the food. If people give you bad reviews because it was too hot outside to wait for a check well guess what!!! Your in in Phoenix!! It's not your fault. I love you guys!!! Your the best ma and pa burger joint around!!! Keep up the great work!!!"}
{"text":"I cannot believe we paid close to $40 for two burgers here. The burgers were tasteless and extremely undercooked. My \"medium\" burger was still bloody. There was no seasoning on the burger itself and the toppings couldn't help it. The bun was extremely soggy and fell apart. So gross. I will never eat here again! So dissatisfied."}
{"text":"They have a wide & wild selection of huge burgers and a really creative decor with surf boards, and cool things all over the walls and ceiling.  It has the feel of a young, hip bar & burger place where you'd go on vacation by the ocean."}
{"text":"Amazing PB and J burger!  Took an old friend to this restaurant tonight!  3rd time there. This place has amazing food.  Great service. Loved it."}
{"text":"The food and drinks are exceptional. The chicken wings medium hotness were perfectly prepared and delicious. We ordered 5 different burgers all outstanding the French fries are addicting, the beef is fresh and was cooked as ordered. 
If visiting the Phoenix area this is the place not to miss"}
{"text":"Best Burger ever, and I love the pretzel bun. Great sweet potato tots. They always have great service, and great specials on beer and food."}
{"text":"Delicious!! Great service!! The bar was fun and the hamburgers are HUGE.  They have way more than burgers."}
{"text":"Very good burgers - big selection. Went with family & friends and didn'thave to wait too long on a Friday evening.

Had the Spicy Mac and Cheese Burger - tasty. Everyone in the party was pleased.

I'll be back!"}
{"text":"\"YUM\" If you are a Burger lover, put this place on your list. The Burger patty itself burst with flavor, aside from building some creative Burgers they nailed the flavors of what a Burger should be! Aside from their lively ambiance the entire Staff is working endlessly to make your experience great!"}
{"text":"Went here while in Scottsdale for the Goodguys hot rod show and it lives up to its yelp ratings no doubt!!! This is a damn good piece of meat stuffed inside a bun! Don't skip this joint! Stuff your face!!!"}
{"text":"I got sick after lunch, I don't think I will ever step foot into this place.


Good luck"}
{"text":"Had a chicken sandwich and was in pain for two hours after. Called-apologetically-to avoid writing a negative review to give them a head's up (on the chance it wasn't me suddenly becoming sensitive to chicken) and so nobody else needed to go through the trouble. The manager said he had had no other complaints and was quick to get off the phone. I repeated I was calling as a courtesy but it seemed like he thought I was trying to get a free meal. So yeah, according to my one chicken sandwich, you might have immediate onset stomach pain and subsequent bathroom badness. Also the manager didn't seem to care."}
{"text":"Large menu. Fair prices for the very large portions. Good wine prices & great happy hour. A great \"joint.\""}
{"text":"Best burger in Arizona. Lots of choices. Very kid friendly, even for a 2 and 3 year old. A must if in a burger mood."}
{"text":"I think the words I am looking for are \"HOLY HELL THEIR BURGERS ARE MASSIVE!\" This place is always packed when I walk in but somehow they always accommodate us. Their service is attentive and the food! OH THE FOOD! Salads are huge, burgers are even bigger and I struggle to even eat half of it! Haven't been disappointed yet!"}
{"text":"Cool burger place - fun ambiance, lots of burgers (and other stuff) to choose from. Shelby is great - super friendly, very attentive and just plain nice. Good crowd even late in the afternoon. If you're into burgers definitely check it out!"}
{"text":"Ok, for anyone that has given a bad review to this place ... you either came on a very very off day or you are just too damn picky (or prefer to be paid for your good reviews).  This place has an amazing atmosphere and staff.   Hands down the best burger place in town.  You can literally make up something and they will make it, the ultimate have it your way place.  It's nice to know that you can come to a place that actually cares about its customers.  If you find yourself there while I am there, say hello."}
{"text":"New Rehab location!! Same great food, awesome atmosphere. When the garage doors are open and the weather is nice, great spot to catch a happy hour. Staff is awesome, super attentive, and the bartender never let my drink go empty (shout out to Rian, Lo, Kim, Jamie, Andy, David, Arturo, Samm, and of course the owners Denise, Wiley, and Ken... This crew never disappoints and always makes it a fun place to be). Don't be shy, try the PB&J (my go to burger). The parking in the back is super convenient too.  Definitely worth a pop in. Congrats Rehab on the new location!!"}
{"text":"Excellent Burgers, friendly wait staff. Quality is there...will go back again! Thank you Rehab..."}
{"text":"The wait was worth it!  Great food and Drinks.  Great wait staff.  This is one of the best restaurants I've been to in a while.  Met some nice people here."}
{"text":"This place has an awesome burger selection. Waitress suggested either the PB&J burger or spicy Mac and cheese burger. I tried the Mac and cheese burger. Meat was high quality and cooked as ordered. Burger had a full serving of Mac and cheese. Mac and cheese was so good I'd have ate it alone. I had a pretzel bun, overall, awesome burger. My father ordered the PB&J burger which he really liked, peanut butter was more of a peanut sauce. Service was pretty good. Place was packed for lunch. Would come back to try some of the other burgers."}
{"text":"Would highly recommend this place. Cool environment inside the restaurant, our waitress was nice and the service was great. One of the best burgers I've had, their happy hour today (Thursday) lasts all day so drink prices were very good. Overall, great service, great food, good prices, I would recommend this place and come here again for sure."}
{"text":"Sometimes THE BIG DOG HAS GOT TO EAT.

Enter Rehab. Glutton's Paradise. Gordo Nirvana.

Rehab Burger has caused so much plaque build up they could own a trophy shop.

Rehab Burger has made Scottsdale so fat they call it the Bounce Castle.

Burgers so fat they got a zip code bigger than yo mama's.

Burgers so juicy your farts will be sharts for days.

Burgers so thick Nicki Minaj got jealous and wrote a diss track.

Nuf said. When I gots to eats, I hits the streets and get my 'Hab on.

WHEN BIG DOG NEED TO EAT, HE NEED TO EAT THE REHAB MEAT"}
{"text":"Really good food that was worth the wait. We had the chili Fritos and they were amazing and super unique. The atmosphere was also really cool. Our waiter was very nice and comfortable to talk to, he gave us some info on the town since we were visiting. I had the pesto pasta with chicken and it was amazing and the portion was huge. Definitely would go back again when I'm in town."}
{"text":"Rehab Burger reminds me of Hooters with more modern outfits. The food is ok, the waitresses are friendly, and the ambiance is sorta sports bar ish.  Service was fast, location was great. No complaints on those fronts.

I ordered a burger, but just when I remembered we had reservations for a steakhouse that evening, I quickly changed it to a grilled cheese sandwich. Unfortunately, the sandwich was pretty disappointing. The bread was 90% of the entree: huge one-inch thick slices that contained a couple slices of barely warmed (let alone melted) cheese. The sweet potato tater tots were fine."}
{"text":"I don't write reviews often. I really need to either be wowed or angry for me to find the motivation to do this. Having said that, I was wowed by my entire experience at Rehab Burger. The food was amazing. We were celebrating a birthday as a group of 7. The staff provided us with service that would make you think you were in a 5 star restaurant. The menu was diverse enough for everyone to choose something that appeals to their tastes and from the chicken wings to the sweet potato tots to the burger itself everything was done perfectly. I had the BYOB burger. I added avocado, havarti cheese, and a fried egg. It was delicious. To the staff at Rehab thank you for treating us like kings. Thank you for the excellent service (especially during the Friday night dinner rush no less) and thanks for the burger therapy!"}
{"text":"Pretty good food but always a long wait to sit and a long wait to receive your food. Limited seating is expected."}
{"text":"On the advice of the other customers at the communal table I sat at and the advice of the waitstaff I tried the peanut butter and jelly and Siraccha burger... And as bizarre as that sounds... it was amazing!  Can't wait to go back and try a few of the other interesting combinations."}
{"text":"Great burgers and good sized portions for an excellent value. Nice beer selection on draft. Server was friendly and knowledgable of the menu. Great area & location."}
{"text":"I'll start with the positive, I loved the atmosphere, it was a cool vibe but that's all that I can really comment on that I enjoyed.  I found this place incredibly disappointing and I really wanted to like it.  I went there based on the yelp reviews and was really looking forward to it.  I ordered the patty melt which clearly wasn't a good choice.  I like to think of myself as a bit of a patty melt expert, it is probably my favorite cheat meal. This one was not worth the cheat.... a patty melt is supposed to be on \"grilled rye\" the bread was not grilled at all, it was simply dry lightly toasted marble rye, so disappointing, I pulled the burger off of the bread, no use in wasting carb intake on dry bread.  The burger itself was ok at best, I've had better at Denny's and that's pretty sad. The staff seemed friendly but not very accommodating, I don't like over anxious servers but maybe a check in occasionally would have been nice... bottom line, would I go back? Not a chance."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service!  We had 3 different burgers, fish tacos, fries, Tater tots, and a pot brownie, all were awesome!  This is a definate We will be back ASAP!"}
{"text":"This place is the real deal. Had the spicy Mac n cheese burger with their fries. The burger is HUGE and absolutely delicious. The fries are seasoned very well and the portion is generous. Their sauce game is ridiculously on point. Definitely recommend the wasabi mayo, their medium wing sauce, and their honey mustard wing sauce. Service was top notch. We brought a puppy and all of the staff came out to meet him and bring him water. Servers were so nice and incredibly attentive. This place is a must visit. Can't recommend enough!"}
{"text":"Great burger. Got a little smoky and hot inside but other then that no complaints. Amazing food"}
{"text":"I've had a couple different burgers from this place always cooked to perfection. Was a big fan of the Mac and cheese they have as well. I would literally eat a bowl on mac and cheese with there burger patties right in top. It was pretty busy both times I went, but that always a good sign because it means GOOD FOOD! The waitresses were knowledgeable of the menu when I asked for suggestions the first time I went as well. Good place for just chilling and good eats. Kind of has a lounge feel to it. No so much a sports bar. Would recommend as a great spot to bring fam and friends who enjoy a great burger."}
{"text":"These burgers are the freakin BUSINESS. I love everything about this place, the building in itself is like a neat on the beach burger shack. It's very close, kinda loud, and very tasty. The chips and salsa changed my life, not sure what type of chips they used but I was funneling that junk in my mouth nonstop. It took a very long time for the burgers to come out but it was well worth it. On a busy day, if you have like 2 hours to spare, definitely come here and enjoy your much needed rehab!"}
{"text":"Great comfortable and everyone welcomes you like a local. Try the PJB burger may not sound like something you want but loved it."}
{"text":"Went last Saturday night with a bunch of friends. (thank goodness we made reservations - there was a decent crowd waiting to get in!)  We had a variety of burgers and sandwiches and everyone enjoyed their meals. Service was fine. Sat outside and it was a perfect night for it. Glad we were outside as inside gets really loud. Only complaints -  the appetizers came out with the meals, and our burgers were inconsistently done. Three of us ordered medium, and they were all three different - from well done to rare. Guess I expect more from a place that specializes in burgers... It won't keep me from going back though!"}
{"text":"Poor service.  Star is mostly due to immediate lack of greeting. I think need to take some lessons from their Canadian neighbors chain cactus club and get a better business model than actual hire enough staff and those that want to work rather than chat.  We waited to be acknowledged at door and then took another time to get us seated. Then once seated we were on our own for a good 15 minutes before any welcome.  Crazy.  Our server was super friendly once he spoke to us.  I expect to be greeted at door pretty much immediately.  There were three servers standing at register at back of restaurant chatting.  Do they know who is sustaining their job.  Obviously not.   Food cam fairly quickly with good recommendations. Server was very helpful and attentive.  Good food. Had calamari and poblano burger with onion rings.  We are pretty spoiled in Vancouver so can't say it was outstanding. Corona Rita was ok as I thought it was usually served with full size corona. At least it is in Vancouver.  So in a nutshell first impression was poor but overall I give it a 3 star."}
{"text":"Decent burgers.  Long wait.  Pretzel bun was good. Chili cheese fries was pretty good as well.  Cool concept and nice variety but the meat could use some improvement... Maybe five guys is just hard to beat."}
{"text":"Awesome staff, great fish tacos and guac! Fun atmosphere for small or large groups. This place is a hidden gem on Mill Ave. part of the fun Mill Ave scene but not part of the super young college crowd.  If you like burgers, tacos, and beers this is the spot for you!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, good food and service, prices are reasonable...but why not GREAT ? My friend ordered her chili hatch  burger cooked medium and it was served rare. She did not notice until I did and was so hungry that she decided to eat it and  only bring it to the server's attention versus complain.

I had the grilled chicken sandwich and it came piled high on \"Beach\" toast with layers of avocado, tomato, havarti cheese and sprouts...it was a delicious monster of flavors and came with sweet tater tots (you also have the choice of french fries) which were to die for. Shame on me,  I also ordered a chocolate lava shake which was delicious and not too sweet. The shake was served in a tall glass topped with whipped cream and M&M's.

The restaurant itself is not pretentious at all and rather casual in atmosphere sporting surfboards against the wall and cycles hanging from the ceiling.

Overall, it was a nice experience, a good discovery and a nice change from the other burger joints. I enjoyed the fact that RBT is more of a sit down place versus standing in line to have to order your food. It's also nice that the burgers and sandwiches come with a choice of fries versus having to pay extra for them. The restaurant also has a full bar and a heated patio."}
{"text":"I've been in here a few times and had a good experience. The staff is friendly but not annoying. Prices are great. They have a ton of burgers to choose from as well. I think a few local magazines also rated them the best burger in the Phoenix area. They have opened two new locations in a little over a year so that gives you some idea about their success"}
{"text":"Awesome environment. Slow service sometimes but I like to hang out there so it doesn't bother me. Best chicken sandwiches around"}
{"text":"One of he best burger places in Scottsdale! Atmosphere is very beachy, makes you think that you are on a tropical island! Very friendly and helpful waiters. The food is absolutely excellent! I got the Spicy Mac n Cheese burger with the sweet potato tater tots. Both were amazing!! We came to watch football, and they turned the tv to the game we wanted. Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Not sure what is up with the negative reviews. Some people just want to find something to complain about I guess. Great burgers, great staff and service, great location, great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Thanks to a Yelp search of \"fries\" after drinks along 2nd Street, my fiance and I stopped in to RBT for wings and fries, and they hit the spot! We were cutting it close to when the kitchen was closing so we appreciated that they were willing and able to take a late night eats order for us :)"}
{"text":"Wow. So happy we tried this place out! New favorite! After some convincing, my husband ordered the PB&J burger. I ordered the Hangover burger. We both got the sweet potato tots. The PB&J burger was so different and SO delicious! I liked it more than the Hangover, but mine was good as well. Our service was amazing and the vibe is super chill. We will definitely be returning with all our friends!"}
{"text":"It was late on a Friday evening and we didn't have a reservation, so we did have to wait a little for a table,  because we had 5 and they had very few larger tables.  But that was just our bad planning.  The hostess up front was so friendly and kept checking in on us to give us status which I appreciated, and once a table became available, their team rushed to get it cleaned up for us.  Their options are great, with something for everyone.  I had my 4 year old with me, and even though they don't have a kids menu, the waitress advised of the options they could make for her.  She had a chicken breast and fries, and she loved it.  Most everyone at the table had burgers and fries, which were pretty great, and the sauce options for dipping were awesome.  I had the Beijing Salad.  It was huge and like nothing I have had anywhere else.  Very spicy, but the waitress offered Ranch to cool me down.  I love hot, so it was very good for me.  We sat outside, and it reminded me of being in Baja.  Loved it. I will go back again."}
{"text":"I got animal style fries, my husband got the southwest burger. We drank their special drinks sweet samarozjia, bochys brew and a bloody mary (it comes with bacon). Everthing was exception waiters were so helpful and friendly, food was delicious and atmosphere was great!"}
{"text":"I had heard several people rave about this place,  so my family and I decided to give it a try while out in the area tonight. 

The raves were justified.  While I am not a red meat eater, the menu caters to all types.  Veggie burgers,  chicken burgers,  chorizo burgers and of course good old fashioned beef burgers. 

I had a turkey Hawaiian burger on a pretzel bun with Jamaican corn.  They were simply incredible and complimented each other perfectly.   My wife had the turkey bacon cheeseburger with onion rings.  The onion rings were huge and flavorful. 

Our server CW was prompt, efficient and helpful.   When we were done,  we all agreed it would be worth the 30 minute v drive to go there again."}
{"text":"The service out of the kitchen is horrible.  We waited 20 minutes for appetizers, and 1 hour for 3 hamburgers.  Really, it's just a burger.  There's no excuse for an hour wait.  The waitress took 20 minutes bringing our drink orders over to the table, and by the time they arrived, the ice was melted, the beers were warm. When someone commented on the wait for the drinks, she made them feel as if it was our fault.  Rude, unprofessional, burgers poorly cooked.  Far too long a wait, and the price too high.  McDonalds would have been a better choice than this poseur of a \"hip\" restaurant.  If you want to pay too much for a burger, have shitty service, and a lackluster kitchen, by all means, waste your money here."}
{"text":"This place is delicious! I had got the PBJ and Bacon burger and my hubby had ordered the Hawaiian Burger. They both were big and delicious. They had outside and indoor seating. It seems to be consistently busy. I would recommend this place !"}
{"text":"If you've read my reviews, you know I am in an endless search for a burger as good as Indulge Burger, which closed and broke my heart. I have heard really amazing things about this place from a lot of my friends. Although I prefer to only eat natural, antibiotic free, grass fed meat, the feedback on this place was so great I knew I had to give it a try. The location is great and parking not too bad. We didn't have to wait to be seated. Once we were seated though, it was 40 minutes before we got our food, which felt like a really long time. Our waitress was a really nice laid back lady, and the other staff seemed really nice. Sadly, my cheeseburger was good, but not amazing. I loved the bun and the meat was good, but it just kind of was like most other burgers, flavored with pepper. The fries were very good, but not quite amazing. The shake came out and was the consistency of chocolate milk, so I asked them to remake it. It came out thicker and colder, but was average, not great. 

Maybe I just am holding everything up to a standard from a place that I can't have anymore :) I will have to give this place a try again another day."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!!!!! I've been going here for almost 5 years and never been disappointed. Best burgers specially Mac cheese burger HEAVEN. I absolutely recommend this place and whoever we took with us to this place, been satisfied as well! Like I said HEAVEN"}
{"text":"Came here because if the reviews. Waited a short time and sat in the communal table. If you don't like sitting next to a stranger eating don't come here. Ordered the pb&j berger and split it with my younger son. Older boy ordered a plain burger and my husband order a spicy burger (can't remember the name). The burgers came with a huge plate of fries. The server was attentive and very interested if we like the peanut butter and jelly burger. It was fabulous. I know it sounds gross but it was super yummy. Everyone loved the burgers and we almost finished them. Lotsa stuff on the walls to entertain and play I spy. Next time I'm in Scottsdale again I will definitely come back!!"}
{"text":"I have only been here once, but will surely be back! I'd be a regular if I lived or worked in the area. I can't remember what my burger was called, but it was the one with blue cheese. When someone orders a blue cheese burger, it's because they LOVE blue cheese and lots of it. This one did not disappoint in any way, shape or form! I wanted to cry over not being able to finish it from lack of stomach space (I tried really hard though). The sweet potato tots were really good with the pineapple sauce. I also had a VERY generous \"Mike Tai\" (their spin on the Mai Tai). I love it when a place gives you a drink you can feel! The service was outstanding and it seemed the owners were there working too (I can usually tell). They clearly have a lot of pride in their restaurant.

Now that the review of MY awesome experience is over with, I will say that my boyfriend's burger wasn't as good. He was a huge fan of this place already, so it's no big deal, BUT... the waitress that talks up the PB&J burger really should stop (I'm not the only Yelper who thinks so). Some things are an aquired taste. I love Braunschweiger but that doesn't mean I'd recommend it to everyone. The PB&J burger SOUNDED intriguing, but it just did not work for him. He really didn't like it at all and neither did I (of course I tried it!). It was also incredibly messy."}
{"text":"Beachy vibes and good burgers (including turkey and veggie menu options). The staff here (especially the waitresses) are incredibly personable and witty.  Would definitely recommend this place. Awesome service! Stop by if you're walking through Old-Town, and visit often.  We need cute, and fun places to stay downtown.  

And they have a patio!  Would be perfect to come here during the evening to have a few beers and hang out."}
{"text":"I went here on the 24th of Feb and the place was packed. The decor is awesome and the vibe is hip. The entire staff was friendly and met my needs. I thought the burger was ok. I was expecting a much better burger for the $13.00 price I paid. I went here because of all the great yelp reviews, however was a little disappointed. I will be back to try a different burger to see if it changes my thoughts on the food."}
{"text":"Loved this place - particularly the PB&J burger. Probably the most unique take on a burger I've seen, and not weird unique - like absolutely unexpectedly wonderful unique. 

Came here with a bunch of co-workers. As usual I couldn't decide on just one thing, so I split two burgers with a co-worker/buddy of mine: the PB&J burger, and the turkey burger.

I believe we got the PB&J on a prezel bun, and the other one on a focaccia. The turkey burger was pretty good (it's main characteristic was the massive 10 oz patty), but it was the PB&J burger that really shone. It mingled sweet and savory, with the textures of tender beef, hearty but soft/moist prezel bun, light jelly and hearty peanut butter into what I can only describe as a culinary journey to another world. 

It was gone before I could fully process what I was eating. 

Of course the sweet potato fries and the whole host of unique dipping sauces was great.

The other star of the night was the pot brownie (no there isn't pot it in), but IT'S in a large pot... of marshmallows, brownie, caramel, ice-cream... just overwhelming delicious and excess. 

Finally, there was a well rounded and delicious selection of beers. 

Definitely make the trip if you can."}
{"text":"The food is great. Their service on the other hand is horrendous. When I come it seems the employees do not know what is going on. They need to work on their structure to ensure each customer is attended accordingly. This will be my last time coming here."}
{"text":"We loved this place!!!  DELICIOUS burgers!!  I had the relapse size (5 oz) Porkster Burger, which is a burger with a TON of spicy pulled pork on top on a brioche bun. It was holy yum. I got sweet potato tots for the side and I appreciated how their sweetness cooled off the spiciness of the barbecue sauce. My husband got the rehab size (10 oz) Jalepeño Popper Burger with fries and he loved it. Service was great, all the staff was friendly, the music was good and not too loud - great place for our dinner!!!"}
{"text":"Great burgers!   Cooked to perfection and incredibly nice service every time we go.  

The only thing I would warn about is their skillet brownie. It tastes like a charred burger because I'm assuming they use the same skillets for their brownies as they do their meat...so that was a little weird, but everything else made up for it."}
{"text":"Been here 3 times. First two were ok, but never going again after my last visit! In a nutshell - horrible service, cold burgers, no AC! This place has gone downhill ... Don't be fooled by the old reviews and ratings!"}
{"text":"Salad was incredible, but probably twice as large as it needed to be. Flavors were great but a little spicy. Prices normal."}
{"text":"Excellent delicious and more than ample serving sizes for the burger,  chicken sandwich and salad we ordered.  If you're hungry go here!"}
{"text":"\"H-hey, man. Cou'I cop a bite of that? Nah, nah I ain't fiendin'! I mean, y-you know I got you next time...\"

You tell yourself, \"I could stop any time I wanted to.\" But you don't. You don't want to stop.

And this is how it starts.

You KNOW most people get just a cheeseburger OR a BBQ pulled pork sandwich, but you had to go and mix them, and now you can't go back. The interaction of ChB and B2Q coursing through your veins gives you the kind of rush that keeps you up at night. Your friends don't understand, but how could they?

\"Just one more porkster burger... people do it all the time, right?\" Once you've inevitably built up a tolerance to the BBQ pork-topped cheeseburger, and you're jonesin' for more, Rehab is there. You can start doing 10 oz. of patty a day instead of 5 oz. like it's nothin'.

As you spiral further and further out of control, speedballs of sweet potato tots mixed with BBQ pork, pineapple aoli, pretzel rolls, and brioche buns... the kinda shit you'd only heard about... it's all a part of your daily routine.

One day you're a successful young hopeful, the next you're pulling tricks for porksters.

Warning: Rehab once, Relapse forever."}
{"text":"I guess if you like burgers this is your place! They have really really great potatoes!! There veggie burger was alright but would i go back I don't know! Service was pretty good! But my partner enjoyed His!!"}
{"text":"Rehab burger is my favourite burger joint in the Valley. My first visit was at the Scottsdale location and I was so excited to see signs for this place opening. I waited and waited... but still no burgers. Finally, months after they started construction, they were open!!! I was thrilled. I had high expectations and they've been met with every visit.

First the Food: Every burger provides mouthfuls of flavour and happiness. My favourite is the PB+J+Sriracha burger. It's messy, but it is AMAZING. I could eat this everyday. But... I probably shouldn't. Right? Also high on my least: the mac and cheese burger, the Hawaiian burger, and the poppers burger. All so good. 

There are two sizes. If you're into sharing, get the bigger burger and split it. It'll be more than enough food. 

Pretzel buns are the way to go. Dense and chewy, and oh so delicious. 

Also, sweet potato tots? Just say yes. Unless you like normal potatoes. They're good too.

Service: they're dressed in Hawaiian shirts. These guys are chill. 

Come and get a burger, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and great food. Burgers are really good, good beer selection, but the sweet potato tater tots are the best thing there!"}
{"text":"Amazing!  Don't be afraid to leave your comfort zone.  I have wandered around the menu and have never been disappointed.  This is my go to place for a burger and beer (or 3).  A word of advice when deciding on relapse or rehab sizes (Rehab 10oz & Relapse 5oz)  - unless you are a competitive food eater avoid the rehab especially if you plan to have a beer or 3. 

If you can only go here once try the PBJ & Bacon Burger on the pretzel bun. Don't be afraid you coward!  Order the damn PBJ & Bacon Burger."}
{"text":"Rehab seems to be the answer to all my burger prayers. Huge portions, and the food is amazing. There can be a bit of a wait sometimes, and I'm actually not sure about the reservation policy. I have a really hard time deciding what I want because everything is so good. Seriously. The Mac n Cheese is awesome. I live further away from Rehab now, but I am already looking forward to my next trip there."}
{"text":"I went here for dinner with my mom and dad after seeing it earlier in the day. Our waitress Tina was amazing ask for her. We started off ordering the chicken wings (mixing 2 sauces medium/gold medal sauce) they were absolutely unbelievable! So we were pretty excited about the burgers we had ordered. I ordered a Backyard BBQ burger and it was fantastic. Cooked perfectly, great flavor, piping hot, and very well played. My mom got the hangover burger and my dad got the mushroom and Swiss burger.  They absolutely loved them. We went to Cold Beers and Cheeseburgers several days ago and Rehab Burger Therapy absolutely smashes that place. If your in old town Scottsdale and you want a good little hole in the wall feeling place go to Rehab you won't regret that decision."}
{"text":"When I want a big juicy burger, this is the place I go to! They have some tasty calamari to start off the meal and a fabulous selection of burgers to follow. My favorite is the hangover burger, and let me warn you, it gets messy! If you have no fear getting messy whilst eating, then that's the burger for you. Their fries are always crispy and delicious, not to mention they have a great dipping sauce (sriracha sauce!!)."}
{"text":"On a day out splurging with a group of friends, we decided burgers were the way to go! What we received was much more than a burger it was a fantastic experience all the way around.

We bombarded this place bathing suits, pool hair, and flip flops and fit in like they made the place for us.  Super laid back, beachy, bicycle on the boardwalk feel.  Absolutely opposite of what we are used to in Scottsdale, thank you for the breath of fresh air....literally.....great open air feel with patio a patio as well.

This place was busy so accommodating 6 may have not been easy, but the owner made it happen. ( The owner alone deserves  5 stars) alright enough gushing... The Food!!!!

We ordered the chili con Fritos appetizer Fritos smothered in just spicy enough chili with cheese and sour cream...terrific!
Rodrigo Da Vinci salad~ zesty and creamy with huge chunks of Chicken.  Peppers onions, jalapeños!  Enough for all 6 to share 
The tractor pull burger ~burger was cooked perfect medium and the Pulled pork on top was fall apart and rich with BBQ goodness.
The PB&J Burger~ Ummmmm.. Go try this, I don't want to ruin the movie by telling you the best parts!
The McGnarly~ burger cooked perfect again, it is along the lines of a Big Mac.....yet so deliciously done right.
The Tuna fish sandwich~ the tuna salad was loaded with celery and onions.  It was fresh and cold and literally stood a foot high! It was a masterpiece made by cooks who show they care about what comes to your table!

I'm not usually this long winded, but if only one person sees how right these people have got it because they've read my babblings than hooray!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love ALL the burgers at Rehab and the wait staff, management and owners I've encountered on my numerous visits have been awesome!"}
{"text":"I was apprehensive about going there because it is on the other side of the valley and is a burger place.  I had no idea it was as good as the other reviews had provided and well worth the drive.  The atmosphere was great, staff was attentive, and manager really did show up at the table.  The beer was as cold and plentiful as identified, with all the favorites represented.  

The food was spectacular and I had the Hangover, with my wife having the Pablo, which was also awesome.  Who knew?"}
{"text":"MMMMMooooo tasty sad cows. Very sorry mr cow but you're so tasty and this joint makes it so much more delicious ... :( Please do not go vegan for sake of the tastiness happening here.

Only issue is it's a bit dingy and the waitress seemed uninterested in the quality fo our experience, but actions comiserate said tip."}
{"text":"Don't order the 5oz burger because their buns are the same ones they use for the 10oz burgers. If you like bread order this burger... The bread smothers the burger. Tried the Mushroom Swiss... The tots are good though... The 10oz burgers look good and will give it another try"}
{"text":"Burgers at Rehab Burger Therapy are just what the doctor ordered! Scrumptious!"}
{"text":"I'm very shocked at all these nice reviews because mine is not so nice. Came here for first time expecting a great experience and great food and my trip was not even close to great. Out waitress basically forgot about us and even took care of the table next to us and never checked in. We had to ask another worker for the check. The waitress came to cash us out and never once apologized for disappearing on us. 

She wrote my order wrong and therefore gave the the bigger burger and charged me for it too- even though I ordered the smaller one. I can't believe I actually paid the check, I wanted to leave so quickly since the food and the service was so horrible. I will not be back! :("}
{"text":"Amazing and Yummy. Mac and cheese burger with bacon and a turkey party. Good night!!! Love it. Our server was bomb too."}
{"text":"Ok, you know how sometimes when you eat a burger you think I need a little more...just a few more bites? Well, that did not happen here! I ordered the 10 oz bacon bleu burger on the pretzel bun and it was huge! I got the onion rings and they are amazing compared to other places. I also tried the fries with the spicy ketchup which our server told us is based in habanero and it had the perfect amount of kick. If you want a good burger, give Rehab Burger a chance. By the way, never go into other places named rehab because A. Quitting is for wussies and B. The food isnt as tasty!"}
{"text":"Great place for beers and a burger that's above the normal.

I writing this months after the visit- I remember a great bartender and enjoyable people on either side of me at the bar. With a couple good beers- not much else is needed.

Cheers!"}
{"text":"So happy we found this place!  Great food, great atmosphere & Great waitstaff!  Loved that our waiter suggested to try the PB&J burger as an appetizer with sweet potatoes fries. It's fabulous!  PB&J with burger, bacon, sriracha sauce on a pretzel bun.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Service at the bar was great.  I ordered the spicy mac and cheese burger substituted a veggie patty and forgot to tell them to hold the bacon but the kitchen caught it and asked me before the order was done which was great teamwork because I didn't want the bacon.  I definitely recommend the pretzel bun and the side salad was clean and fresh.  I love that they will do any of the burgers vegetarian.  All and all if you are looking for a delicious gut bomb with great service look no further. :)"}
{"text":"Legit, legit, legit! Could be one of the BEST burger spots I have ever eaten at. Ate there twice on our recent trip. Went Ghost Burger the 1st night! Money, can't go wrong. Then went PB&J burger 2nd visit. Before you say \"huh PB&J\"? It's a MUST try. The flavors mix together to provide an outstanding burger!! Modelo's were on happy hour from open to close too! $1.50 a beer, can't beat it! If You haven't been, go! You won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"This place rocks!  I had a bacon cheeseburger on a pretzel bun with half fries and half sweet potato taters. All were flavorful and super yummy. The burger was amazing with the right balance of cheese and crispy bacon. Try the chipotle spicy aioli. It's wonderful on the burger. Lauren was my server and she was attentive, provided great service and smiled the whole time. It was a great dining experience. It's now my fav burger joint in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"OMG. I have never had better chili than what was on the Chili Cheeseburger at Rehab!! It was amazing!! Everything was great including the service. Our server helped us out with what to order from what kind of sauce to what kind of fries we should get!! He was such a great help. 

I had the Chili Cheeseburger with the Sweet Potato fries. I also got the Chipotle Ranch sauce and the Pesto Aoli. So good!! 

We also had the Bacon Blue Cheeseburger which was fantastic as well!! And the regular fries were delish too!! I would highly recommend this place. I loved it!!"}
{"text":"Rehab burger totally lives up to the hype! They have a fairly extensive burger menu with the option of doing a larger Rehab size (two 5 oz patties) or a smaller Relapse size with just one 5 oz patty. I opted for Relapse because each burger also comes with a choice of fries or sweet potato tots (went with the tots) and your choice of buns (got the pretzel bun!)

I got the Know your Poblano burger and my boyfriend got the spicy Mac n Cheese burger. Poblano burger came with peppers and grilled onions plus a sauce of your choice (went with chipotle aioli) that comes on the side. Burgers are cooked perfectly and come out hot and juicy. Bf's mac and cheese in his burger was seasoned with jalapenos and sriracha sauce and sooo good. 

I also really appreciate a place that has pretzel buns (AND doesn't charge you extra) and also has sweet potato tots. 

Prices were reasonable. My burger with tots was just $8.75, which is probably how much a pretzel bun burger with fries at a generic fast food chain would cost.

Service was speedy and attentive and super friendly!"}
{"text":"Shut up. Go Here. And get the Mac Gnarly Burger or any burger...yum.

Beachy vibe...awesome fries too man i'm hungry. Just do it."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and get the PB&J bacon buger. Absolutely delicious and they don't skimp on the PB&J (there is plenty for dipping). Happy Hour prices were pretty good too. Definitely a good place to kick back with friends and some drinks and enjoy Rehab's fun food and atmosphere."}
{"text":"One of our favorite local joints. If you're feeling adventurous, try the PB&J burger, which has peanut butter, jelly, bacon, and sriracha. Sounds kinda scary but trust me -- it's amazing. Great service, cool vibes, awesome food."}
{"text":"I love the casual beach ambience and the huge selection of the  burgers to choose from. You can select the type of buns you want, and pick fries, sweet potato tater tots, or do like I do and get half and half. Burgers are huge so we always end up taking leftovers or I'll split one with my daughter. My favorite is the PBJ bacon Sriracha burger on a pretzel bun. Today i had the beefstro burger which was humongous, greasy and messy to eat. Just the way a burger is meant to be. I'm in a food coma now."}
{"text":"Rehab Burger wins on all measures.  Customer Service - Spectacular.   Food - delcious!!  We stopped by for lunch today and had a time crunch.  We let the hostess know and she actually checked with the kitchen to see if they could accomodate us!!  That's service above and beyond.  We decided to take our chances and stay and I'm so glad we did.  When we thought we weren't going to make it, the waitress offered to make our lunches to go.  We got our food - gulped it down and made it back to work.  They even brought to-go boxes with the food just in case.   Now, we would have gulped it down even if we weren't in a hurry because it was DELICIOUS!!  My medium burger was perfectly pink and I want more!!  My friend's medium well was also perfect.  The onion rings were beautiful and scrumptious.  Fries were great.  I'm sorry none of us orderred the \"tots.\"  They looked great walking by.  I'll have to go back soon to try those out.  So, environment (tvs, sports, surf board, flip flops) - Thumbs up!  Food -Thumbs up!  Service - I'm out of thumbs so they just get a good tip!!  Thanks for a great lunch and great service.  I have a new favorite place to eat in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Rehab burger therapy? It sure is!
I couldn't wait to try this place out due to all the positive yelp reviews. On New Year's Eve, my boyfriend and I stopped in for lunch and we were blown away by the amazing customer service, quality of food, and happy/fun sheek environment. We had the bacon cheeseburger with a side of sweet potato tots. Yum yum yum. We also had the frito chili appetizer--holy was that delicious.

I will definitely be back and break my New Years resolution diet."}
{"text":"Just meh... The burgers my family had weren't cooked at the right temp, and when the waiter said he'd take care of the bill, he subtracted a total of $.50 for their mistake. They said the burgers were alright. The French fries and tater tots weren't anything special either. There's far better places in old Town to eat at."}
{"text":"Best burger place I have ever been to. This is my favorite place to eat I love the chill environment and the great service. I absolutely love coming here!!"}
{"text":"Sat at the bar on Friday night on the far left side closest to where the employees punch in on the computer. My friends and I overheard them gossiping the entire night and talking crap about everything and everyone. It was kind of annoying. Our bartender was really nice but service was kind of slow. I got the turkey burger and it was extremely underwhelming. I tried a few wings that my friends ordered and those were delicious. I would be reluctant to come back here, definitely no experience to write home about."}
{"text":"This place is really hard to get into at lunch & dinner time, which is to be expected from anything in Old Town. The prices are on par with Old Town as well $$. My burger, fries, & drink were $14 (closer to around $20 depending on how you tip). They try to make the place feel like your in Key West or San Diego. The burger was OK, the service was average. I feel like, with this place, your paying more just because it's in Old Town, which is totally fine. I think there are better, cheaper alternatives nearby so I wouldn't make a special trip for the food. That being said, if your in Old Town & are looking for a burger joint, Rehab is a solid option."}
{"text":"You must try the new Chorizo-Beef Patty!!  There are rarely new flavors in the Scottsdale culinary world but today, with the discovery of the Chorizo-Beef  patty at Rehab Burger, I can honestly tell you that your taste buds are in for a brave and fantastic treat!

When I was a kid, my grandmother would wake me up with the smell of chorizo and eggs, frijoles and homemade tortillas.  Mama did not call for me, her food did.  The aroma and crackle of fresh chorizo and eggs beckoned me to the kitchen where I would enjoy the spicy flavors of her homeland. Today, with the style and flare that only Rehab Burger can muster, a new chorizo con beef patty replicates the taste that heretofore  only could be found in my grandmothers East Los Angeles kitchen.

You can order any of the burgers with the Chorizo-Beef patty, but I chose the Pablamo Burger.  Wow!!  Ken prepared my burger medium, and it arrived just as it should, with just the slightest pink in the middle. Served with an egg on top, bacon, cheese, a sweet Pablamo pepper, and sauce... the flavors were amazing!!  So many different tastes burst into my mouth, and the spicyness of the chorizo arrives late, almost as an after-taste... so subtle but unmistakable.  Normally I can't finish one of Rehabs generous plates, but this flavor was so inviting, I kept picking up that burger, bite after bite until it disappeared.

Want a burger you can truly call unique and special?  You must try the Chorizo and Beef Patty now! My Ma Ma is gone, but the special taste she produced each morning in her East Los Angeles kitchen lives on! Thank you Rehab Burger for the flavor and memories I thought were long lost!"}
{"text":"Food is decent. However the waitresses here are worse, even more rude than at Dick's Last Resort, and I don't think that's the theme here. Maybe they call this place \"Rehab\" because the staff is on drugs?"}
{"text":"Just as good as I remember, I used to go to the one in Scottsdale and it's fantastic. If you want a great burger and super awesome staff come here."}
{"text":"At 9:30 pm on a Saturday night, good dinner options were slim. My boyfriend and I decided to try this place out on a whim. We arrived about 30 minutes before they were to close. We were greeted by the friendliest bartender who was super cool with us taking our time to order. I love the laid back atmosphere! They had Four Peaks Arizona Peach on tap, which I decided to try. 

I went with the Port-a-Burger and my boyfriend got the Porkster. I've had a portabella sandwich at a few places, but it's usually nothing to write home about. This was the best portabella sandwich I have had in ages. Smothered in havarti cheese with lettuce, tomatoes and sprouts-all served on a delicious pretzel bun. The sweet potato tots were also quite tasty. My boyfriend enjoyed his sandwich as well, which was massive and covered with BBQ sauce. 

The decor is very Hawaiian/stoner-ish. The bartender kept us entertained with stories about traveling to different cities and the owner even asked us what we wanted to listen to! It was a pretty cool experience. Food was great, atmosphere awesome and we were there past closing time. No one ever rushed us. Overall a very good experience and I look forward to coming back and having another Port-a-Burger!"}
{"text":"Nice ambience, great variety of appetizers, burgers, sandwiches, etc. I had the chili cheese fries - very good! Followed that up with a bacon cheeseburger - also very good. Had a couple glasses of Kilt Lifter beer as well. The place was fairly crowded at 1 pm when I arrived but the crowd thinned out a little by the time we left. There are also large and smaller sizes for each burger."}
{"text":"We had a work function in Scottsdale so we decided to have a late lunch/early dinner.  I was surprised when we walked in and found all the tables full but one. We were happy to take the last one. The decor has an island feel complete with the music and decor. The beer was very reasonably priced and there was a great selection. I opted for the coconut porter which was yummy. 
We ordered the chili con Fritos appetizer which took a while to come but it was worth the wait. The chili was good and just spicy enough. I opted to the special burger a bacon blue cheese burger. I ordered it on the brioche bun but it came on the pretzel bun instead. I'm going to call this a happy accident because I loved it. 
The service was a little slow but it was really busy in there. The food was reasonably priced and very tasty. I would definitely return and may be dreaming of that pretzel bun.."}
{"text":"Visited Scottsdale for the first time, went here with 4 adults 2 kids ages 4 and 1... everyone was impressed... small place,  but I am sure when it's not as cold the patio is great.  Hubby had the PBJ burger and couldn't believe how great the combo was. I had the spicy mac burger and it was also amazing... and I don't usually care for Jalepeno! 

Definitely a stop for anyone who likes good burgers!!"}
{"text":"Stunningly good burger! I'm from out-of-town, it was my first time there, so I \"bellied up to the bar\". I had the \"Relapse\" (small) \"Know Pablano\" burger on a pretzel bun with their standard fries. I slathered about half of the Chipotle Aioli on the bun and left the rest for dipping the fries (Belgian Style...). I savored *every bite*. I drank some Four Peak 8th Street Pale Ale to complement the meal, and afterward had a pleasant talk with a local couple who frequent the restaurant. Friendly atmosphere, good music, clean establishment, and a nice surrounding area. I plan to come back and try their other burgers on future business trips!"}
{"text":"I don't really understand the hype for this place... I had the Mushroom Swiss burger here and it was literally the worst burger I've ever had in my life. No, that wasn't an exaggeration.

It's too bad. A lot of the pictures Yelpers post here made this place's food look pretty good. Unfortunately, my burger was pretty disgusting with a grease-covered bottom bun floating in a pool of even more grease. Everything was made fresh, sure, but nothing was really outstanding here. Flavorless greasy burgers, mushy sweet potato tots, flavorless onion rings, all paired up with questionable sauces \"recommended by the chef\".

Oh, and our server was horrible too. Apparently we weren't interesting enough for her to give decent service to, as she let our food sit in the kitchen for five minutes while she chatted up with people at the bar... Then went right back to ignoring us after she had finally served us. Not all service was bad here, the table right next to us had a server that went back to them about 8 times compared to the 2 times our server wanted to grace us with her presence.

In summary: I'm not sure why this place seems to get the most love out of the 100 other burger joints you could hit up off of Scottsdale road, but to people who want something better than below average bar food, pass on this place."}
{"text":"Food was defiantly different. I have never ever tried burgers like they offered before. Honestly it was an awesome experience.  I will for sure go back again."}
{"text":"One of the Best tasting Burgers I have ever had. Service is excellent, recommend this place to Burger lovers!"}
{"text":"Our 10 mile drive through rush-hour traffic is so worth every mile once I bite down on your burgers.  Great servers who always care that they get my orders right, but also take a moment to chit-chat when they have time instead of hiding behind counters and only being reactive servers.  Your cooks are always on point because the many times I've visited, never once has food come out less than perfect.  And best of all, the very reasonable prices are so appreciated.  I get the best quality burger I've found here in Phoenix, jumbo wings graced with outstanding custom sauces, and at prices lower most anyone else.  I seriously can't go back to Long Wong's, or even my past favorite, Buffalo Wild Wings.  Rehab is THAT good!

If I had to complain about something (and I had to grab at straws to find something); is that I guess I'd ask that you introduce a hotter version of your hot sauce, because I typically go with people who like things a lot hotter than I do.  Oh, and that I'm still looking for a replacement for a \"Wild Wing Cafe\" wing sauce flavor I'd had back in Charlotte, NC a few years ago that they called Jalapeno Cheddar.  It seemed to be a mix of Velveeta, chopped jalapeno pepper, and hot sauce perhaps?  Whatever it was it was fabulous, and I miss it something fierce!"}
{"text":"This place has a very different approach from what most restaurants do. The nice colorful place with some unique objects inside and takes you to the ocean. I had the jalapeño popper burger and was really good. They have funny names for the menu items. Next time I come back, I will be in need of speech therapy."}
{"text":"4.5 stars, rounded up.

I'm a huge fan of burgers, and the food here is quite delicious. Their burgers are HUGE, and I very much enjoyed my meal. We ordered the Backyard BBQ Burger (swapped out the colby jack for cheddar cheese) with sweet poTOToes (so good!), and the Mushroom & Swiss Burger with a side caesar salad. 

The BBQ burger was amazing - the flavors were on point, the burger was juicy, and the onion rings added nice texture.

Mushroom & Swiss burger - good cook on the burger, but it lacked flavor. The meat was quite bland and under seasoned, especially since Swiss cheese and mushrooms are both very mild in taste. Not as good as the BBQ burger. 

The service is good, portions are very generous, and the prices are reasonable. The menu is extensive and there are SO many burgers, drinks, sides, etc. to choose from. I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"A perfect place after a night of drinking!! Love the relaxed atmosphere! Sat on the patio on a perfect AZ 84 degree day and watched the Parada Del Sol parade. Thank goodness my husband and I share. We had the backyard bbq burger  so good!!!"}
{"text":"I just ordered a delivery, the driver is on time and the burgers taste good. The problem is they dont know how to follow simple instructions, i said separate the veggies and cut the burger in half. But its not what i received. Also the fries are too soggy."}
{"text":"I went to Rehab tonight to celebrate my last day of work for the school year! Also, we had a yelp deal...so that was cool too. The atmosphere is very casual, that I like. I got a frozen margarita and oh my goodness it was boozy. As I am writing this, I am still tipsy from that single beverage...wow. For dinner I had the hangover burger on a pretzel roll....it was delish! The burger was perfectly cooked and it had egg, cheese, and bacon on it...how could it be bad? It was super delicious. The sweet tots were just ok, but the BF's fries were really tasty. He also liked his turkey club. The service was prompt and friendly by our nice server Pickle. Anyway, I will most definitely be back and next time I will get a pot brownie :-D"}
{"text":"I'm visiting family in Arizona, I have very strict dietary needs for health reasons. I was pleased to learn that this restaurant offered a gluten free hamburger and sweet potato tater-tots that are not cooked in corn or soy oil. I got my order to go, and called ahead to place it so when I arrived it would be ready. I show'd up 15-20 mins later and my food was ready in the time they quoted me. The staff was helpful although it did take longer than I anticipated to pay. 

The burger itself was nothing special, it was bland and had absolutely no flavor, they just grilled a meat patty and put it on a gluten free bun, which also wasn't that great. It's hard to find good food that tastes great when you have special dietary needs. All in all I would have been better off making the burger at home. This is a place hyped up by the locals and over all is OK for the price. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone that wants a really good hamburger. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for bland mediocre food that will fill their bellies but put their taste buds to sleep. Also if you have special dietary needs, you should be ok to eat here, just don't expect anything spectacular."}
{"text":"I'm new to Phoenix, coming from Southern Cal. I was looking for good places in Scottsdale. Went here yesterday, it was great! My husband and I shared a burger and it was huge! We did the build your own burger, we did a hamburger with portabella mushroom and avocado, it was delish. The cook added more mushrooms cooked in a wine sauce I believe. It was very good! Next time I'm in Scottsdale I'm going here. Oh and the staff is great and so is the atmosphere"}
{"text":"Ughhh... I wanted to like it. I really did. I had my second visit and I possibly may try to push Rehab back on myself one more time just so I can say I really tried.

The place is a complete cluster. The staff looked stressed and unsure what they are doing.

Our server was flustered. Talked way too fast, kept calling me babe, hun and touching my arm. She was maybe 23? You don't call strangers babe. She couldn't keep up with her own words, only came by when she had to deliver something to us. Food took awhile and it flat out sucked. It was super bland and we all agreed we rather of gone to in and out or jack in the box, which is sad. Our server was too distracted with the little amount of tables she had to notice no one finished their plate or ate much. 

There's nothing special about this place and it honestly reminded me of a cheesy airport bar or tourist trap in ft Lauderdale. 
Maybe if the cooks learned how to use salt or any spice for that matter."}
{"text":"Great food and great atmosphere. One of the best places to get a burger in the Valley."}
{"text":"Delicious! Had a backyard burger. It was on a pretzel bun (yum!) a fried onion, cheese, and bbq sauce. Burger was done perfectly. Had sweet potato tots, and those were great too!"}
{"text":"Where do I begin? The terrible service began waiting 5 minutes for a server to bring me water, the Arnold Palmer was weak and watered down. Now let's move onto the \"burger\" which is what their known for. Issued for American cheese but the server \"corrected\" me and said \"that's not cheese\", I said cheddar and he said yes. My burger came with no \"cheddar\"! It went back to the kitchen and they just threw on a piece of cheddar that wasn't even melted. On top of that the burger was \"dry\", no juices at all. Maybe I just had a bad experience nonetheless it was my experience. Worst $7.50 burger I ever had. Hard working people deserve better than this as are money should not be wasted on bad food and a bad experience."}
{"text":"Came here with my girlfriend's mom who came from out of town. This was the second time I have tried this place. The first time I had the mac n cheese burger and it was amazing. The second time, not so amazing. The macaroni and cheese was cold and the sauce was bland. My girlfriend got the MAC burger and thought the thousand island sauce tasted like Kraft. When I asked for bacon (from who I think was a manager) he came back with BURNT bacon. Not just in a couple of places, but totally black and hard. If he really was a manager, why would he serve a guest something terrible and inedible? We let the server know we were not impressed by anything very clearly and let her know about the burnt bacon, yet no manager came around or anything was fixed on the bill. Don't know if I'll give this place another"}
{"text":"They take a long time but these burgers are really good with a good char yet still juicy. But 20-25 minutes is a long time to wait after ordering so get a drink and appetizers if you're really hungry."}
{"text":"I normally get a BYOB (build your own burger) on a pretzel bun, and it never disappoints!!

When I'm not getting that I try one of their salads. I've had them all and I love every one.

I like to end the meal with one of their \"pot brownies\" which is a brownie in a cast iron skillet with ice cream and marshmallow fluff. You can get it with Reese's or Hershey's, they're both amazing."}
{"text":"Meth heads are casing the corral parking lot and stealing stuff out of cars..park out front.no cameras or security on lot...happened on 10.5.17...lunchtime...very bad experience...dont care for food myself. Good luck"}
{"text":"In town for a conference and a coworker had this place recommended to them. All I can say is I was glad we went!!

Had a choice between 5oz and 10oz burger. Went with 10oz cheddar hickory bacon burger and loved every bite. 5oz would have been enough but double the size for a few pennies more

And our server, Lauren, was the best!!  Ask for Lauren and make your stay in Scottsdale worth the time away from home!"}
{"text":"So it's superbowl weekend at 11:15pm Saturday and we walk into this place that's about 75% full and sit at the bar ready to grab a burger.  We hope to just relax at the bar and grab some tasty grub after a long night but instead we are greeted with a bellowing and extremely unfriendly \"sorry guys, we're closed for the night!\" from behind the bar.  Really?? At 1115 on a Saturday night, the Saturday night before the Superbowl in Scottsdale? ????  I am neither a Seahawk nor a Patriots fan and didn't travel far for this treatment, rather,  this place is in my very own neighborhood and I have left an amazing review here once before.  I will tell everyone I know to steer clear of this place.  No excuses.  Nobody deserves this  treatment."}
{"text":"We ordered burgers at the bar, the menu is extensive.  We had a BYOB and veggie burger.  The burgers were OK but the sweet potato tots were soggy and under done.  Disappointed."}
{"text":"Great tasty burgers. I am so glad they offer the half-size version! Fabulous sweet potato tots! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Once again Yelp comes through. Over 1100 reviewers rate this place 4 1/2 star average. They were right on. One of my Yelp friends wrote a review that convinced me to come in for Therapy. My wife and I came here for lunch. First of all let me say parking shouldn't be a problem as there is a parking corral just behind the restaurant. The décor is tropical leaning toward a beach theme. We showed up around noon on a weekday and were seated immediately. Right away I got a coupon when I checked in for $3.99 salsa and chips. Our waiter brought them right out with our drinks.

I got the Ghost Burger. This comes in 2 sizes. The relapse size which is like a quarter pounder, and the rehab sized which is like the half pounder. After reading other reviews I knew I should only order the relapse size. The Ghost Burger rehab size comes with two relapse burgers grilled to order, blanketed in ghost pepper jack cheese and topped with crispy onions and fresh guacamole. The relapse size comes with one burger.

The chips and salsa were amazing. They use flour tortillas and deep fry them making the chips a crispy golden brown. The salsa is made fresh and has a little bite to it. The Ghost Burger is a fire ball of deliciousness. The burger was juicy and grilled to me specification perfectly. For a little added kick I asked for some siracha. I chose to have mine on a Kaiser roll. It's a little larger and held all the toppings well. We were planning to get dessert, but had no room. I will have to return to try some other unique burgers."}
{"text":"Great burgers and tots.  Seating isn't the most comfortable but a fun atmosphere.  Try the PB&J burger.  Sounds gross but is truly awesome."}
{"text":"It's a funny place - but that's it. The service is slow and the food is average. Don't order water, it tastes horrible!"}
{"text":"That burger was the bomb (black and blue).  Would have been a great environment for a date.  Beer was good.  Staff was on it and very polite.  The sweet potato tots would have been better had I been stoned.  I'd go back for sure."}
{"text":"The sweet potato tater tots are heaven and the siracha pb and j burger is my fave, soo good :)"}
{"text":"Not impressed. Their burgers are big but they weren't that tasty. I went there due to the raving Yelp reviews but was sorely disappointed. I tried them twice hoping the first time was just an off day because they were super slammed but no, I would rather go to hop doddy or in and out."}
{"text":"Excellent burgers are the standout attraction for Rehab.

PROS: the best thing about the burgers was the quality beef--very tasty and just the right balance of lean/fat to make for an excellent flavor. Brioche bun was fresh and lightly toasted. Service was friendly and efficient.

CONS: for me, a good burger must be complimented w/ good french fries.  Regrettably, the spuds came to the table barely warm, and they sure didn't improve as the meal progressed. This cost a star from my rating . . . Side salad came to the table looking like it had been stacked under 5 other similar plates when it was pre-made several hours before. The cheese and croutons didn't help hide the \"pressed\" salad, nor did they inspire the bland taste.

I'd definitely return to Rehab . . . the burgers are worth it. However, I'll be sure to ask for fresh and hot fries . . . 

Cheers!
RS"}
{"text":"Food is really good. Don't miss the PBJ burger. The hangover would make a nice breakfast too. The atmosphere is chill good music not too loud thanks for that. A mix of people but more younger peeps. It's bathroom is a bit dirty but otherwise a don't miss this one place."}
{"text":"5-stars for the food.  Service probably only 4-stars at best.  Had the Ghost burger and the spicy Mac and Cheese one.  Both were excellent and the pork wings were tangy and awesome.  The place was so crazy busy and crowded that service just couldn't adequately accommodate everyone.  Staff were friendly though.  Will go again."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place!  Very relaxed atmosphere. Surfer vibe but always full.  Price a little high for burger and fries but they aren't a little flimsy patty on a normal sesame bun.  I get the small 5 oz patty but they do have a 10 oz. omg!  Different bun choices like pretzel which really give it a unique flavor.  Never been let down but today we got the large \"gnarly\". Which is all u want to say! It's a Big Mac on steroids!  The most delicious burger I've had here but so big couldn't fit it in my mouth!  Yum.  I was thinking about giving this a 4 star simply bc the service was just mediocre   But the food is really why we go and that deserves a 6!"}
{"text":"Burgers are enormous and delicious. Service was excellent & quick. Definitely coming back. Mac n cheese burger was spectacular!"}
{"text":"This place is bomb.com!  So good and so many varieties.  I never thought a burger with peanut butter and jelly would be a good thing but it is absolutely delish!  Great service as well.  It is always packed so there is sometimes a little wait but nothing too crazy.  The spicy Mac and cheese burger is to die for....best, creamy, cheesey mac and cheese I have ever eaten."}
{"text":"We were driving around in Scottsdale and very hungry after a 4 hour flight. This place had a cute patio but was too full for us. The inside was ok and feels kind of tropical. I had the backyard BBQ burger (rehab) and the sweet potato tater tots. The burger was juicy and very saucy. Not the best burgers I've had but nonetheless very good! The rehab (10 oz I believe) burgers are bigger than my face and I had to take some tater tots home with me."}
{"text":"I was pretty disappointed in my burger! I had a B.Y.O.B. so maybe the key is getting something else on the menu? My burger was overcooked, the fries were nothing extraordinary. I did enjoy the atmosphere and had good customer service, it just wasn't as delicious as I'd heard. I'm always looking for a great burger and this just didn't live up to its reputation, not this time."}
{"text":"The service was mediocre and unfortunately the burger wasn't much better. It was my first visit and I tried the 'ghost' burger. The patty was nothing special and it had no spice whatsoever. I was meeting friends and the waitress just let us sit there with nothing to drink because we had already received our checks. I will not be back. So not impressed."}
{"text":"Best burgers in town.  PB&J burger is outstanding - you've gotta try it!!  Always busy and for good reason."}
{"text":"This place is freaking legit! I had the porkster burger on a pretzel bun with sweet potato tater tots and spicy pineapple bbq dip and my partner in crime had the pb&j and bacon burger and both were out of world. Now  I see what the hype is about. Also, the service was great. I would highly recommend it to anyone eating out in old town."}
{"text":"Rehab Burger has a great, laidback, beach-vibe environment. The staff are friendly and seem down to earth. They have outside high-top seating that's great for any time of the day. 
They have a huge menu and the burger options can be a little overwhelming if you're indecisive like me. I went with the turkey burger that had avocado, lettuce, tomato, and sprouts on top. It was huge and super tasty. The burger came with sweet potato tots that were warm and crispy and there's a unique selection of sauces to dip your tots in. Some of the burgers have the option of 5 ounces or 10 and the turkey burger only comes 10 ounces, so I wouldn't recommend eating it all, especially if you plan on drinking! I didn't drink here, but I hear the margaritas are strong and really good. I absolutely love this place and can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Awesome burgers at great prices in a casual bar environment. The hatch burger (10oz) outsized the bun and had a generous amount of cheese and pepper slice. Sweet potato tots were amazingly good - why do these not exist anywhere else?! Great side sauces."}
{"text":"The burgers are large.  I could literally eat only half of it. I tried the green Chile burger. It was awesome. The only negative comment I have is that they always have a long wait. It's definitely worth the wait."}
{"text":"Best turkey burger I have had thus far from restaurant. I usually go for chicken because the turkey has little hard parts inside.... However this burger was amazing!!!!!!  The staff  is very attentive, anticipates the needs of customers and never left me hanging for a refill on my beverage, side sauce, or  a smile even. Everything was fresh, made to order and large size lol!!!!!"}
{"text":"Every time I have eaten here it has been great. From the staff to the food. This is one of my favorite places in oldtown to go unwind with friends"}
{"text":"First place we ate lunch the day we moved to town. Hot day but the place was cool and Hiphawaiian.  Cold Beers hit the spot while trying to decide on a burger as there are so many interesting and temping things on the menu..  We got the smaller size each and skinny fries and Tots.  The small burgers are really big and quite a mouth stretcher but oh boy are they tasty and cooked to perfection.  Exactly Medium!  Good Skinny Fries which are great with the many dipping sauces offered.  The Tots are popular but a little too sweet for us. Love that they use local beef and Fresh never frozen.   Overall a great experience and my fav local burger.  Got to try the PB&J one at some point."}
{"text":"I wish I could eat here more often.  I'm rarely in a good enough mood to buy a $15 burger.  When I am, I go to Rehab.  You can't make a burger like they do over at Rehab, unless you decide to put on your burger whatever you can find in the fridge.  That's pretty much how their Sunday specials work, but you won't make a Sunday special as good as theirs.  And always get your burgers with the pretzel buns."}
{"text":"While wandering around Old Town Scottsdale we decided to yelp what was nearby for something to eat. We found Rehab and decided to wander over there.

The place had a laid back hippy vibe (our waiter had an amazing mustache that the wife would never allow me to grow!) and a great happy hour special. The burger was to die for. The pretzel bun was one of the best I've ever had the burger and bacon were crispy and cooked exactly the way I like it."}
{"text":"The Yelp rating doesn't lie. This place is great! Small and comfortable. Island theme. The staff was friendly and informative. They explained that all the menu items are customizable which is great for a picky eater. Everyone in my party of 4 was extremely pleased with what they ordered. We'll definitely return and recommend!"}
{"text":"A good burger but not great. Lousy lemonade didn't care for the fries. Colleague sent her burger it was way over cooked. They did offer to replace it it and took off the bill but not a place I'd visit agains."}
{"text":"Heavy burgers.  Not the best if you want something healthyish.  Probably 800 calories per burger"}
{"text":"This has become one of our fam favorites! We love the peanut butter burger and the sweet potato tots. YUM!!! It's a fun laid back atmosphere. There's usually a wait, but it definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"Damn good burger. Decided to try the pb&j burger. It was delicious. The service was good too. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"This place was pretty great all around. Awesome burger selection, fun/friendly staff, and pretty timely service, especially considering we were in a group of about 12 people.

I had the pork wings to start and they were delicious. There were some rogue bones to watch out for, but they're definitely worth it over the traditional chicken wings.

For my main course, I had the 10oz hangover burger. I'm a big eater and the burger with fries was plenty filling. Really good tasting burger, although it did come out overcooked...I order medium-rare it was medium-well, but it didn't matter much.

I highly recommend trying this place out if you're in the mood for a good burger and fries!"}
{"text":"Very cool burger joint, complete with a full bar and plenty of cold brew selections. The menu, however is the star of the show with a featured PBJ Burger that comes with Sriracha sauce...are you kidding me?

I joined some fellow Yelpers last night for a birthday shenanigan shindig, and we had to keep adding tables as our group of about 20 kept growing, and it seems like a popular party place, for an even larger group took up the center of this bicycle and surf board ceiling hanging therapeutic pub. Plenty of therapy was provided, too, as the servers were hustling, but also taking time to be a part of the crowd, friendly and personable...I like that. 

I inhaled the Spicy Mac-N-Cheese Burger, medium well, with a side of their sweet po \"TOT\" oes...so yummy. It wasn't too spicy, either, with just enough poblano peppers to give it a kick. Not usually a big-burger fan (size-wize), so I got the 5oz'er, which is referred to as a Relapse. A larger version, the Rehab 10oz was available if you happen to need that type of therapy!

My Speech Therapy (great way to describe the effect alcohol may offer) was the first thing on the menu, a Kimmy Special...a grey goose and lemon refreshment that went down smooth like water. I could have had about a half dozen, but thought better of it, for I was reminded of our county's' famous TENT Therapy, which is offered to those who forget how to drive.

Great spot to bring visiting out-of-towners for an original, and fun burger hangout!"}
{"text":"Although this location is closer to home, I still prefer the Scottsdale location. Staff is more friendly there. Our waitress seemed pissy. Food and beer was worth the attitude."}
{"text":"Nice burgers love the music and the wait isn't so bad try and get inside to the back porch and have a beer in the meantime it will be worth it"}
{"text":"So delicious! I had the poblano burger, it was spicy but really tasty. My boyfriend had the pulled pork burger combo, also super yummy. And we had the warm brownie, marshmallow, reece's, ice cream dessert, it was amazing! Super affordable too, a glass of wine, 2 meals and dessert for under $40!"}
{"text":"Loved the jalepeno popper burger with no bun!  Huge portions of everything.  Our server Madeline was friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"I find myself coming back to this restaurant as it is a great place to go for lunch (and study). I had the relapse B.Y.O.B with lettuce and onions and it was one of the most delicious and juiciest burgers that I have had. The seasoning was tasty and the burger was cooked to perfection. The fries were also amazing - thick, crispy on the outside and soft on the inside."}
{"text":"The peanut butter and jelly burger blew my mind and was cooked perfectly medium!  Happy hour prices were good too.  Super friendly bartenders.

Rehab is located a few steps off the main street and is pretty small so if you are going during prime hours, be prepared for a wait."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE SERVICE! Was excited to stop in and try dessert. Came in at 8:58 pm, no one was willing to take us to a table finally a guy came and showed us to a table at 9:02 and a manager lady came out and said no we can't sit down because the kitchen was closed. Meanwhile someone was just coming out of the kitchen serving burgers to a table."}
{"text":"Great spot for burgers beer and a relaxed atmosphere. They have two size of burgers 5 and 10 ounce both are delicious. A good deal on specialty burgers around $10-13 for the 10oz, plus comes with a side. Has a theme to the place. Easy going friendly informative attentive staff."}
{"text":"I've visited this establishment a couple times with friends. It's always a fun time there's a lot of energy and friendly servers. Great time all around."}
{"text":"Funky looking place that is great for people watching.  The burger names are a hoot and you get good sized portions of food.  Although food was pretty good, I would rather go to 
The Stand for the best burgers."}
{"text":"Found this gem of a place when we were out in Scottsdale in January.  Great food and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great food and great service.  Prices are a little expensive, but you can easily get two meals out of the larger sized burgers."}
{"text":"If you need a sloppy hangover cure this is the place to go. 

Their burgers fill your stomachs with happiness."}
{"text":"hostile staff when trying to place a pickup order for Postmates. It's not my fault you can't comply with the Postmates system"}
{"text":"The food was amazing.  Cobb salad was a hit. Many sauces to choose from. Hamburgers are delicious. Went with the bbq."}
{"text":"Every time I leave Rehab Burger, I swear I'm going to check myself into Rehab... Fat Camp, actually.  Last time I was there, I managed to eat the Mac Gnarly burger, and we're not talking the \"relapse\" size (which is the size of a normal large fancy burger).  I'm talking the legit Rehab size.  You know, the double patty special that you stare at when it arrives, not even sure if you get get your muscles to pick up the thing.

I've also had the Jalapeno Popper burger, which is great if you're craving something fried and slightly unhealthy.  I love the Mac Gnarly, though, because the large amount of veggies makes it feel *almost* healthy...as long as you order the small size.

We've also split an order of the pig wings, which come with a BBQ sauce even better than it sounds.  I've been hoping to try the Pot Brownies sometime (no illicit drugs included - wrong state, people!) but have been too stuffed from the entree every time and haven't been able to order dessert yet.

I've made a promise to myself... next time I go to Rehab, I'll walk out a new woman, instead of being rolled out in a wheelbarrow."}
{"text":"Food is great! Service is mediocre at best. But again the food is great! Nice fun ambiance."}
{"text":"Had a Ghost Burger because the menu said limited time. This thing was wowza! The medium rare beef with spicy guacamole and caramelized onion is heavenly! My god it's good."}
{"text":"First time getting to try Rehab Burger Therapy. Went with this family on a Saturday afternoon and it was crowded but we were seated nearly immediately. The waitress asked if it was our first time and explained the menu to us and noticed we had kids and (since there isn't a kids menu) named some of the most ordered items for kids. She warned us that the portions were large and are usually split between children. 

We ordered the Spicy Mac n Cheese burger and the Jalapeño Popper burger, as well as the Quesadilla and a grilled cheese for the kids. I opted for onion rings and we also got fries and the sweet potato tots. The burgers were delicious as were the sides. The kids were happy with their choice, it was definitely a lot of food. You can't leave this place hungry. The waitress was nice and attentive, the food was great. Definitely happy we decided to give it a try. We will be back."}
{"text":"We were in the area so stopped in for dinner.  It was very busy but we were lucky to find a table.  The beer was frosty cold and the burgers delicious.  Our only complaint was the sweet potato tots.  They are mushy and not very good.  I should have ordered the onion rings.  The service was very attentive and we left happy.  We will return."}
{"text":"I love this place. The chicken chili verde appetizer is crazy good. They make their own tortilla chips, probably some of the best I have ever had!

I have tried their salads and burgers both are fresh and HUGE! I got a half salad and could not believe it was half! The large must feed an army.

Great drinks and service to boot!"}
{"text":"You know when you have to wait 30 minutes on a Tuesday at 3 PM there must be something good going on. It's true. The food here was fantastic. The PBJ Bacon burger was my favorite, although I also enjoyed everything else we tried: calamari, chips and salsa, and the jalapeño popper burger. 

The service was a bit slow, but that's my only complaint."}
{"text":"Love the vibe and the staff is really friendly and seem to love their job. The burger was awesome. I had the poblano burger and hubby had the blue burger and both were perfectly cooked. Ian was our bartender and we will definitely go back to enjoy his  jokes and attentive service."}
{"text":"Fantastic burgers. I am impressed every time I visit. Definitely my favorite burger place."}
{"text":"Awesome chips and salsa, although the yelp 'deal' is only one dollar off or regular happy hour price...but I guess when food is as bomb as it is at this place they don't need to offer a great deal to get people in here. Due to the overwhelmingly fantastic reviews of the PB&J bacon burger, I gave it a (apprehensive) try. The reviews were definitely accurate. It was delish!! A little sweet/salty kinda deal...really great! Fun place to watch a game too!"}
{"text":"Interesting Atmosphere. Good Burgers   

Friends had recommended Rehab Burger Therapy some time ago, but when I reviewed the menu online, it didn't hold much appeal for me. 

Finally, the other day when I had a taste for a Plaza Burger (burger with sour cream and chopped onions) Rehab was the only burger place I could identify nearby that definitely had sour cream on the menu. 

I walked in for a late lunch, and luckily found a seat at the bar. The place was packed both inside and outside. The staff was really swamped, but my server took the time to flash me a big smile when she came to take my order. I ordered my relapse (small, 5oz) burger medium rare with sour cream and onions. I was about to order sweet potato tots, but the woman to the left of me looked like she was really enjoying her skin on fries, so I decided on them instead.

When my server brought my food, she again smiled, and I noticed that she made a point of smiling at everyone. It was a nice touch. My fries were hot, delicious, crispy and perfectly salted. My burger, unfortunately, was over cooked (well done). I didn't take the time to send it back because I was very hungry, and short of time. I did mention it to the server and she indicated that the kitchen tends to overcook the small burgers. She suggested that the rehab burger (large, 10oz) is more likely to be cooked to the desired level of doneness, but I also might want to order the small burger rare the next time. (I appreciated the information) She offered to have it remade, but I had already nearly finished it. It wasn't bad by any means, just more done than I like. If I could have given an award to her for friendly service, I would have done so. 

Overall I liked the place and enjoyed my food enough to go back and take a friend a few days later. We ordered our small burgers rare (with lots of emphasis..) and we received perfectly cooked burgers, although our fries were barely warm. We were short of time and happy with our burgers and let the cool fries slide. She loved the Hatch Burger, and I stuck with my sour cream and onion burger again."}
{"text":"OMG the burgers were sooo good. A group of us all ordered different burgers and were not disappointed in any of them. The winner is there PB and J burger hands down."}
{"text":"Its been a while since I've been here so we decided to check it out since we all have had excellent experiences here. We walked in for lunch about 230 and it was pretty busy but we found a table right away. Cassie was our server and she was very busy but really nice. We got the bacon bleu burger, the cuban, the hatch burger, onion rings and mac n cheese for the little guy. They really dont have a kids menu but they can make a few things like PB and J or mac n cheese. Everything was super tasty but COLD. Everything. From the onion rings as an app, burgers, corn, mac. All of it. Cold. We all just ate it because we were truly enjoying everything. When the manager came by and asked, we just told her it was delicious but cold, her reply was..\"REALLY? That never happens\". This would have been a 4 star review had we not been accused of lying. They were busy, our food sat in the window...period."}
{"text":"Went to Rehab Burger and had the weekend special the Elvis Burger. 2 two hamburger patties.,Cheese bacon, fried caramelized banana, peanut butter, and a chocolate bar on a chocolate chip bun. Oh so Yummy!  Went great with the sweet potato tots.  Hope they make that again really soon."}
{"text":"This place has a ton of high ratings; therefore, I had high expectations. Unfortunately, my expectations were not met with their burgers.

I ordered the chile hatch burger with a pretzel bun with the beef cooked at medium. The pretzel bun didn't taste that special and the burger was not juicy. In fact, it tasted kinda plain. In comparison, I just went to Habit burger and their burgers had more flavor and juiciness in the burger. All in all, still a good burger, just not amazing. 

However, the happy hour (before 6pm) prices for drinks were a great price. I had the Blue Moon pint for $3.50. The servers are also very attentive and nice. The sweet potato tater tots were very delicious because they are crispy on the outside and moist in the inside. The two dips also made it taste delicious."}
{"text":"Excellent burger. Ordered it medium rare and it actually came out that way!! Fries weren't my fave but the burger more than made up for it. Sat at the bar and the bartender was very attentive. I'd told her I needed to get to work so a few min after I started eating she dropped the check. I appreciated that as I was in a hurry. The decor is great--beachy and fun. Reminds me of Jimmy Buffet. Great patio with misters. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and great burgers! Afternoon happy hour $1 off drafts. I would highly recommend the BBQ burger and sweet potato tots."}
{"text":"Seriously,anything on this menu will leave your mouth watering BUT my personal fave is the hangover on a pretzel bun!! Yuuuummmmyyyyy! :)"}
{"text":"Love the vibe and wacky-cool decor but wasn't all that impressed with the food. I got the Hawaiian chicken burger (with pineapple and ham) and it was super dry and bland. The fries were nothing fantabulous either - kinda dry and mushy. My husband got the chili burger, which he loved. My kids didn't want anything on the menu - there's nothing offered for children. The hubs and I will come back sans kids sometime and see if I just ordered the wrong thing."}
{"text":"Loaded drinks, great service,  super friendly staff... burger hit the spot... stop by for some R&R"}
{"text":"If you are in Scottsdale this is a must... I'm gluten free and they have the BEST bun... The service amazing there are so many options... The pbj and hangover burgers are two of my favorites... And the sweet potato tots are on POINT"}
{"text":"First time in Scottsdale and did some research on a great dinner spot. This was hands down one of the best burgers I've ever had if not THE best.

The wait was about 15 minutes which wasn't bad at all for a Friday I'm guessing. Had to share a long table with another group but it made the meal more intimate. Our waitress was so fabulous and friendly and very helpful.

Appetizer:
You MUST order the PIG WINGS. Don't think twice about that. They are all meat (no fat at all!) and fell right off the bone.

Burgers:
- Spicy mac n' cheese burger was AMAZING! 
- The Porkster burger was even more amazing! Get this one if you can't decide between these two.
- Get the 5oz relapse size (rehab is way too big) 
- Order the sweet potato tots (SO DELICIOUS) 

Great food, great service, and great atmosphere. Would definitely come back if I'm ever in town again!"}
{"text":"OMG I love this place...I finally found a place where I can have my baby brother, who has an appetite of football player, Tapout....hahah....burgers are huge....the taste is the bomb.com will be bringing all my visitors from out of state here!!!!! Servers are awesome!!!! Great service!!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place!!! We always get the chili cheese fries and the hangover burger. Amazing flavor on everything!"}
{"text":"I've been to the Scottsdale location but this was our first time to Tempe Rehab. It was Thursday all day Happy Hour so we enjoyed a couple of Four Peaks drafts for a decent price. My wife's Hatch Burger (she got the relapse size - 5 oz) was outstanding. The chile on top was grilled, with a bit of smoky flavor. I opted for the Hawaiian burger (rehab size - 10 oz). It was huge with a large grilled pineapple slice on top. 

I had ordered it well done and, unfortunately, it came out still very red throughout. If it had been close I would have normally accepted it but I had to send it back. The waitress apologized and quickly took the burger back. I kept the plate of fries so I would have something to nibble on while I was waiting. A couple of minutes later, the manager came out and apologized about the mixup. She offered me a side salad or something while I waited. Because I had the fries I declined. She also said, \"of course, when you get your burger back this will be on me.\" The manager also came around a few minutes later to refill our water glasses. A few minutes later the waitress came by to say the burger would only be another couple of minutes. When it arrived it was cooked perfectly. 

I'm going into a lot of detail about this because this is how you want to be treated when things don't go right. I did not expect to be comp'ed for the burger but it was a really nice touch. BTW, the burger was delicious, especially with the pineapple teriyaki aioli.

I'm not a gourmet and so as long as the food tastes good, the thing that matters most to me is the service. This one was top notch."}
{"text":"I love Rehab, and will miss it! Best Mac n Cheese burger, Best Sweet Potato Tots, Best Pretzel Buns!

Always great food, the margaritas a little sweet, but overall great!

Staff all great, and the one that wasn't didn't work there too long.. 

For sure hungry for some food form here right about now!"}
{"text":"This place has the best burgers around, with an awesome variety. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu, but I would definitely recommend an order of sweet potato tots...best I've ever had. Service at times is slow, but the food is worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Just had the worst experience here and I will 100% not be returning. I waited over 15 minutes and the server did not come to my table nor even address me. I told the hostess I am leaving and am disgusted at the level of non-service. Train your employees better please. Completely awful service."}
{"text":"As I was walking around Scottsdale Old Town, this place popped up on Yelp...probably because one of my co-workers has written about it. He recommended the PB&J Burger, which sounded like an odd combination: peanut butter and jelly on a piece of meat? 

Well, I gave it a try and I have to say that I'm convinced: it's a good combo. Although, I have to say that I'd probably like to eat two smaller burgers: one with this unusual combination and the other one in a more traditional style...it was all a bit too much in the end. So, if you're here with a friend: share this one!

It's a busy place; luckily I was by myself and was seated at the bar right away, but I saw other folks who had to wait for a table for quite some time."}
{"text":"I have been dying to check out this place for awhile now! I was sooo excited when we finally got the chance to! The décor itself is really fun and busy. We were expecting them to be busy but luckily we got a couple seats at the bar which is open seating. The Bartender was fast with our drinks and very friendly. She was patient with explaining the burgers and the toppings. I chose the Ghost pepper burger and my wife got some mushroom burger with onion rings. 

It didn't take long before we were staring down what looked like almost a undoable task. The burgers were huge! We dug right in and my wife was absolutely in love with hers. She told me she could tell this place used real mushrooms, not the canned stuff. As for mine.. Damn, I underestimated the hotness of Ghost Pepper.. It snuck up on me and it was a constant burn.. The whole time. I enjoyed it though (However, I didn't enjoy it 6 hrs later). The burger was cooked to perfection and the toppings were amazing. I do feel like they could have salted and peppered the meat a little bit though. Other then that It was bomb diggity! I will def make it back and try another one of their amazing burgers."}
{"text":"This place is amazing Just as good as the Scottsdale location. The bacon and Bleu is the best burger I've ever had. It's so smoky and just....wonderful. I haven't tried their pb&j and Sriracha one yet but everyone raves about it. The owners are awesome and the waitstaff is always so friendly.  Great laid back atmosphere and decent prices too"}
{"text":"Not impressed at all. Burger had a funny taste to me, and just didn't have the wow factor. Just not that great of a burger, for the hour wait to be seated. I had to ask for fresh hot fries because the first attempt were cold and burnt. Sad after waiting so long as well for the food. Nice environment and friendly staff, but that's it. Not worth it and Won't be back."}
{"text":"Rehab is in a great location and atmosphere!  We were looking to grab some food before heading out into Scottsdale for the day and fell into here.  The patio is cute and the inside has a great beachy feel.  A girlfriend of mine got the Veggie Noogie and loved the crunch from the sprouts.  I on the other hand went with the Venice Beach Club.  Note to self: IT'S HUGE!!!  It was a double stacked sandwich that was hard for me to even bite into, but I'll be completely honest...it was DELICIOUS!

Our other friends went for the massive burgers which they both loved the pretzel buns.  Seems that's what everyone raves about so I'm not too surprised.  The only thing that I was kinda bummed about was the beer.  All of our beers were luke warm.  I like my beer so cold it hurts my teeth so it was hard to ignore that it was warm.  

Other than that this place was great!  I will absolutely go back and take family/friends when they are in town from home.  How could you not love it ?!  I felt like I was on vacation. :)"}
{"text":"Seriously some of the best burgers I have tasted.  Lots of variety and options to suit everyones fancy.  I love the laid back decor.  If you haven't tried it you need to, and if you haven't been in a while you need to go back soon.  I am getting hungry just thinking about it."}
{"text":"fantastic. reasonably busy on a saturday night. We were able to grab seats at the bar.
Food-
- portions are enormous. My wife's saladwas enough for 2 people to eat for 2 days.
- bacon and blue burger was amazing. perfectly cooked (med. rare) and flavor was outstanding.

Drinks-
- Margatini was great 
- drink service was prompt and quick on refills

Service-
- overall fantastic, prompt and courteous,"}
{"text":"I was visiting Tempe from Georgia and, at a hotel employee's suggestion, walked to Rehab Burger in 109-degree heat. Worth it. Great menu options. I opted for a salad that had generous amounts of chicken, avocado, and pecans, all items that other restaurants tend to be stingy with. The salad was great, the grilled chicken was flavored well, and the bartender who took my to-go order was personable. Great experience."}
{"text":"These burgers are so damn delicious. I always have to get one to go. I drive from el mirage to Scottsdale to eat here. Why?  Because they are the best burgers I've ever eaten. I love burgers, but these just make me wet thinking about them. Holy moly I just can't contain myself here. Let's nor forget to mention that the staff is fabulous and they have a pretty nice bar too. I love this place almost as much as my husband. He also almost lost a finger the first b time we came here together. I don't think he will ever try to take a sweet potato tater tot off of my plate again....."}
{"text":"I'm usually not a fan of the island-bar atmosphere at restaurants like this, but their burgers and service are awesome enough to keep me coming back. The burgers are huge, served on soft brioche buns (the buns make the burger!) and super juicy. The pesto aioli is really good with both the fries and sweet potato tots, even though it sounds weird."}
{"text":"Called in a late night To-Go order. I chose the mac-n-cheese w/fries. They said it would take 15 minutes, but it took far less. Staff was attentive and respectful. The burger was amazing and not too heavy for the size. Only gripe is the price. $14 for a burger and fries is a bit much."}
{"text":"We arrived at rehab burger on a Sunday afternoon in late July- thought it would be not be crowded, but pretty much every table was taken.  We got seated right away, and the waitress came over pretty quickly.  We asked for water and some time to kook at the menu.  Took a few minutes, but got the water.  My husband ordered the hatch chile medium well with fries and I ordered the byob with mustard and pickles and onion ringsI ordered a glass of wine and my husband ordered a beer.  After a long time -10 minutes or so the waitress came back with a beer and a mixed drink- said no that's not mine and she asked could I repeat my drink order.  I did and about 5 minutes later it arrived.  And then we waited, and waited and waited.  Finally the food arrived.  Hatch burger medium RARE (not well) with sweet potato tots not regular fries.  No ketchup; aioli instead.  My hamburger arrived with lettuce, tomato, onion, mushroom and pickles, no mustard in sight.  I took it all off and asked the hostess for mustard - which she delivered quickly.  I was also given fries instead of onion rings because according to the waitress they were \"still in the fryer,\" and would come out later.  By the time the rings came out I was full and didn't want them.  We then asked the waitress to change our tab due to the problems and she said she would send the manager over.  Well she didn't and we had to ask the hostess to send the manager over.  The manager came over quickly (guess the waitress didn't tell her) and was very sympathetic and accommodating.  She comped the whole bill, even though we were willing to pay for drinks and things that had gone ok.  I think the waitress was the problem here, not the food or the management, but it was hard to know since we didn't eat much."}
{"text":"Found this place by accident....and what a nice surprise!!  It was beachy...which I love, it was clean, the staff was all VERY friendly....and the Cobb salad......the best I've ever had!!

Note to management: great job on the staff training! I travel for a living and NEVER find staff members do much more than collect your money! Your folks engaged the customers in conversation, checked back on us...just the right amount....and made the visit very warm and enjoyable!!  Great job!!"}
{"text":"This place excels on so many levels. I love both locations and it's worth the wait if you get there and see a line.

I don't want to go overboard in detail but I haven't had a burger here that wasn't amazing.
Top favorites so far are the PB&J (don't say eww just shut up and try it) and the mac n cheese burger. 
I follow them on facebook to see their limited time burger specials, this fills my fat kid happiness meter.

Wings- delicious
Corn- I don't order corn at restaurants, I order corn here
Chili cheese fries- must try
onion rings- huge!
sweet potato tots- wow, get the pineapple teriyaki or the pineapple bbq sauce with these
***Actually try all the sauces***

The staff is all really friendly but you can't beat Mike for a server or Bartender."}
{"text":"Been here twice before and came tonight because Paradise valley burger is closed on Sunday. Service was great the food not so much this time.
08/24/15- Wiley sent me an email and is sending me a gift card for my next visit! I am very impressed with his fast reply and eagerness to please his customers.

3/12/2016
I finally went back to use my gift card. It was a very crowded Sunday afternoon and my minis and I sat at the bar. The service was excellent the food was excellent (their wings are so amazing) and everyone was apologetic for my last visit! I met the owner and she was great as well. You have won us back!!!"}
{"text":"I don't give many 5 star reviews but this place deserves it. It's our second time in Scottsdale and for this second visit our first stop before we even checked into our resort was the Rehab Burger Bar!

First of all their margaritas are the best I have had. Order one of those right away while deciding on what burger you want to eat. 

I ordered a bacon blue cheese burger, with everything mixed in the patty. Patty they make is huge! Burger was cooked perfectly and went well with my drink and sweet potato tots.

Atmosphere inside is great also. Very chill but a great bar atmosphere.

Only drawback is there are not one of these in Chicago!"}
{"text":"Had the Hangover burger with frys and it was fantastic!  The burger was huge and cooked to perfection, loaded with bacon and delicious.  The frys are very good as well. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Best and biggest burgers in Tempe, a must do when in downtown Tempe.  Build one in Ahwatukee!"}
{"text":"Can't wait to get back for a dessert item I spied on the menu - some kind of delectable brownie concoction, but I digress. The place has the coolest beach vibe with groovy art, tv, and music making it work. Very friendly service, and the menu is ridiculously impressive. Their burgers cannot be beat and your choices/combinations are limitless. I had a pineapple bbq backyard burger with giant crunchy onion rings atop. I couldn't get the thing to smash below a 4\" gap and had to make do with knife and fork. Hubby had the bacon/egg burger combo (can't remember the names of these bad boys) but they were both cooked to perfection, juicy, and the bun... oh my land. Don't miss out on the sweet potato tots - full of flavor and crispy good. Next time, I may share a burger so I can land that dessert. Will be SOON."}
{"text":"Wow, I am really sorry that I waited so long to try this place. And really, the only reason I did was because I had a groupon (Amazon Local, actually). It was a deal for couples where you get to share one appetizer and then you each get a burger and then share a dessert. Wow, that was a lot of food! We ended up taking most of it home because their burgers are huge. I ordered their special for the night which had sirracha, peanut butter, jelly, and bacon on it. I know it sounds a little crazy but it was incredibly good. And I loved the pretzel bun; a lot of burger places try to do a pretzel bun but are unsuccessful at it. All the burgers on the menu had a lot of interesting toppings and most of them sounded pretty good. The best part for me was the sweet potato tater tots. Those were fantastic! We also ordered wings which hubby said were pretty good (I didn't try any). And for dessert they were out of the pot brownies so we got a strawberry milkshake which tasted like it was made with fresh fruit. Mmmm good!!

I really liked the laid back island vibe of this place. They had a lot of surfer and beach paraphernalia decorating the walls. It was fun without being too corny. And I really liked the music, too. Some surf and some rock. While we were there they played a lot of Sublime which always puts a smile on my face since it takes me back to my college days. Everyone seemed really friendly and our waiter was awesome!

I definitely will return. I wish I had found out about this place while I was still working in Old Town!"}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place! We were on vacation in Scottsdale and saw this place on yelp so we had to try it. We ate there everyday for lunch! Yes, it's that good. We tried several of the menu items and everything was excellent, but our favorite was the Rodrigo Da Vinci salad.  The service was great, everyone was helpful and friendly. The atmosphere was inviting, very trendy and comfortable. Wish I lived in Scottsdale just so I could eat there everyday."}
{"text":"I was torn between a couple different burger options, and asked Kaye (server) for a number of recommendations.  I ended up with the ghost-pepper burger, which was delightfully flavorful without being crazy hot.  She was extremely helpful, including some suggestions I hadn't read on the menu (e.g. pretzel roll which was really good).  Even though it was a busy and hot night, she stopped on her way by to offer soda refills before the glass was even empty.

The burger (larger \"rehab\" portion) was ENORMOUS, with a ton of cheese and a bunch of sautéd onions.  It was juicy and greasy, but in a very good/non-disgusting way.  The onion rings were pretty good, but not amazing.  I was intrigued by the \"pot brownie\" dessert, but had absolutely no room left to even consider it.

Really good food, really good service, and really good value.  If you leave there with any room left in your stomach, you've done something wrong. :)"}
{"text":"This restaurant is located on a busy corner on Mill.  It's a rowdy area with lots of foot traffic and I would not recommend that you get here by driving.  I'm sure there's a parking lot nearby somewhere but I didn't spot it.

Booths are short and comfortably seat 4.  I ordered the mushroom and Swiss burger done medium with a side of sweet potato tots.  The burger comes with your choice of traditional brioche, wheat, or pretzel bun; all are excellent choices.  The waitress recommended the Chipotle aioli instead of Ketchup and I'm glad she did; it was a novel and delicious flavor pairing. 

Overall a delicious burger and large portions.  I had a bite of their fettucine alfredo which comes with buttered toast, but I would recommend against it.  If you're going to come here, then you should definitely get a burger!"}
{"text":"If you go here, go hungry because the portions are huge.  Rehab has a fun vibe with a beachy atmosphere. We arrived early enough (11:30) to not have to wait for a table but there was a line when we left. Service was attentive with everyone working there chipping in to clear tables and get things moving. We had the soup- very hearty- the porkster and the veggie burger. I ordered the veggie burger thinking it would be a lighter alternative than the burgers but I only make it through half of it. It was very tasty. Our sides of onion rings and sweet potato tots were yummy and generous. We took half of our meals home and enjoyed the rest last night. They have indoor and outdoor seating."}
{"text":"I was not enthused! I was invited to come here for a friends birthday and was not very satisfied. The service was bad and the food was just there. I wouldn't recommend coming to this burger joint as there are many others that are more tasty."}
{"text":"Intricate burgers with a LOT of flavor! Their sauces are amazing. Restaurant is small and can get quite loud especially on nights/weekends. There are a lot of tables packed inside, but it doesn't keep this restaurant from being awesome. Definitely a place you should at least try once in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Favorite place of our entire family! We love all their burgers and my personal favorite is the PB&J.  It is excellent!"}
{"text":"Ben was great seeing us. The pig wings were incredible with the homemade pineapple barbecue sauce. We also shared the poblano burger. Cooked perfectly medium rare. Onion rings were crunchy. Sweet potato tots were ok. Happy Hour 11-6 every day"}
{"text":"I love this place and have visited several times now. But tonight I ordered a burger and onion rings to go.  Everything tasted great as usual.

My issues were that if you order onion rings you expect more than 3 onion rings. Also, I ordered chipotle aioli and my order was dry with no aioli at all. Very disappointing experience"}
{"text":"Best Bacon Burger in Valley!!!  

Onion rings--- 10 of 10--- out of this world good !!!!

Shake--- 10 of 10---old fashioned shake-- tastes amazing 

Hamburger---10 of 10--- the best for last. Just melts in your mouth. Delicious and amazing. Had their bacon burger but they have about 15 different specialty burgers"}
{"text":"Get the PB&J Burger on the pretzel bun with the sweet potato tots! Seriously the best burger ever!!!! The only complaint I had was the the hostess girl, blonde, was a real bitch to us. Other than that we loved our waitress, bartender, and food!"}
{"text":"I've never met servers who were so friendly, patient, and just overall cool people.  

Burgers are excellent. I've had the chilli and mushroom swiss and they were both exquisite. 

Sweet potato tots are mediocre.  I prefer the fries."}
{"text":"Came in simply because it was close to my hotel. Tucked away just off Indian School road, you wouldn't expect such a gem behind a simple, friendly facade. Themed like a Hawaiian dive, it is anything but. The staff was friendly, the music was always reggae, and the air conditioning was a kiss compared to the dry, desert heat outside.

I had the Know Poblano burger (small) with sweet poTOToes, caramel milkshake on the side. Delicious all around. The owner gave me some 1:1 service, suggesting the spicy ketchup, coming out also with a teriyaki dip as well. I can only recommend this place and will definitely be coming back next time I'm in AZ."}
{"text":"My 13 yr old son and I went here today for lunch.  He was craving a big burger.  I was craving a relaxing sit down meal w/vegetarian options.  We both got what we wanted (his, a burger w/double meat and mine a veggie burger w/no bun (sounds bad, but it was delicious!).  And, I also got one of the best bloody marys I have ever had!  When I walked into this place, I just got the feeling that they must make really great bloody marys and they do!  Yum!!!"}
{"text":"Just a nice neighborhood burger bar!  Very low key, not the typical Old Town noise pounding restaurant.  The burgers were very tasty (mushroom burger, cheese burger and turkey burger) each were filled with flavors and perfectly cooked.  When we arrived there was a little bit of a wait and had to sit at a high top with two younger children; in the future I probably wouldn't come here with the kids as it felt more like a bar with really good food versus a restaurant with a bar."}
{"text":"Hi had a terrible experience dining at this location.  We ordered bloody mary's and the spicy one was not spicy, the horseradish one contained little if any horseradish, the mixer was watered down and the pour was light.  When we ordered a double for round two the waitress spilt most of the booze on the floor.  The chili cheese fries....  huge portion of not delicious.  Canned cheese product, kidney beans, and marinara sauce.  We nibbled on these for 30 minutes waiting on our burgers while they severed the rest of the restaurant.  By the time our main course arrived, we were so unhappy they comped our meal and we left.  My hamburger was raw.  I did not eat it, but I shudder to think what would have happened to me if I did.  Beware the coleslaw.  We took one bite and decided there was something sketchy about it.  We had been looking forward to trying this place for months and it was the worst dining experience of my life.  We only went here because the wait in Scottsdale was an hour plus.  There's a reason."}
{"text":"Was looking for a place to eat, since we were in town for a baseball tournament. Stopped here because of the Yelp reviews. I liked the decor of the place, laid back, surf atmosphere. We got a table rather quickly outside, with heat lamps. The guy that helped us was really nice kept checking on us to make sure we were ok.

Our waitress came and was telling us since it was Sunday they were out of alot of stuff.
Not a big deal. We ordered 2 appetizers and only received one. We didn't say anything figured food will be out soon so we'll just wait. WRONG! Don't get me wrong she was nice but slow as dirt! The place wasn't crowded at all. She never came to refill our drinks, the nice man that sat us down was the one checking on us. He even said good burgers but the customer service was crap.

The Burgers were just ok, nothing that would make me want to come back. Maybe if we came back when they had everything in stock, but the customer service tells me otherwise thanks but no thanks."}
{"text":"Had company from out of state and we were looking for someplace different to eat....we found it.  We all had a different burger. The most unique was the Peanut Butter & Jelly with Bacon Burger.  Not a normal combination for a burger....but it was AWESOME! I had a Patty melt w green chili....very good.  It was a bit crowded....but it was also lunchtime on a busy Saturday in Old Town. We only had to wait about 20 mins.  Waitress we had was great and attentive. Nice family atmosphere or great for a date.  Reasonably priced and definitely enough food for your money.  I'm ready to go back and try something else from thier menu!!!"}
{"text":"I went with some friends and they wouldn't even let me order for myself. The PB&J Burger was what they wanted me to eat and that's what I got. I did get to order my side, sweet potato tots, great choice! The place was very busy and I can see why. I've heard a lot about the PB&J burger and to be honest, I was underwhelmed. Don't get me wrong, it was good, just didn't live up to the hype that I've heard. The burger itself was very tasty, the bun was great, I just think I'd pick one of their other many choices the next time I go, and I will go again."}
{"text":"I'm shocked that I have to give this place two stars. My husband and I were so excited to try it out but we were extremely let down. The drink I had -the margarita/Martini was not good at all and both of our burgers were extremely overcooked. We honestly could make a better burger at home! The vibe and the whole idea behind the restaurant is awesome but they really need to work on the burgers! We really wanted to enjoy this place but it fell very short :/"}
{"text":"I was in town to see Jerry Seinfeld and wanted to try a few places for lunch. Christina J suggested this spot to me so I said I would try it out. The weather was so nice that I was able to eat outside in this college town. The food was very good. The burger was moist and the onion rings were crispy. The price point is terrific and if I'm in the area again I will surly stop in again. The staff is very friendly as are the folks that eat here.
       All said and done if you are in the area and want a quick but good bite to eat this is a place you must eat at. No disappointments had."}
{"text":"This is an intriguing place for sure. The concoctions of burgers here seem very odd when you read the menu of ten or so speciality bizzaro burger mixes. I mean a PBandJ hamburger with bacon and hot sauce? ( they insist it is great!)  A Mac and Cheese hamburger? Ha! However, our burger was pretty delish! We got the Ghost burger which has Ghost Pepper Jack Cheese on it. Pretty spicy but not burn your face off either. Not sure how a whole one would fare since the last bite of a half had my mouth pretty fiery. The serving was large enough for two people to share, which we did. The Onion Rings which came with it at an extra charge were only fair so maybe stick with the fries. 

The server was pretty cool, funny and talented. The place was packed. We were a large group of over ten taking up a lot of space. He handled it all pretty well and was gracious. I would go back to try some of their other unique burgers."}
{"text":"Very good burgers the only improvement i would recommend would be that the sweet potato tots were actually too sweet if that is possible. Other than that awesome burgers."}
{"text":"What a great place! The vibe is chill and beachy which I love! The servers are friendly and happy to be at work! Sarah and Marie took care of us and they were above and beyond helpful! Great cocktails, burgers were delicious..... happy you are on this side of town now!"}
{"text":"First time at this location, been to the location in Old Scottsdale.

Ordered the Hangover which consists of fried egg, bacon, colby jack cheese and hatch green chili and we ordered it on a pretzel bun.

Very much enjoyed every bite and was cooked as ordered medium.

We decided to eat here before the ASU Basketball Game against UCLA, maybe it was our fault, but I expected to eat here an hour and go to the game, instead the service was extremely slow and took 1.5 hours and we were late to the game and missed over half of the beginning of the first half of the game.

I don't like bashing a restaurant for service, but this was extremely slow.

Burger and fries were very good and would come back again, maybe just need to communicate our plans to be prompt.

I will give really 3.5 Stars, so a 4 star, definitely not a 5 star"}
{"text":"Have heard a lot of good things about this place and it did not disappoint. 

Was very busy for a Sunday afternoon and was told it would be 20 minutes but ended up around 10 minutes. We were seated in a community table, a long table that could sit maybe 20 people. Was not my first choice and then when a group of 12 came and sat by us it became more uncomfortable.  

I ordered the Hangover Burger which has egg and bacon on a Pretzel bun and sweet potato tots. The burger was huge and delish,  the tots looked to good to pass up even though I am not a sweet potato person.

The service was back and forth,  you would get swarmed one moment and then would not see anyone for a while. 

Nice patio area but wanted to sit inside, the decor was fun and one that you would see next to the beach. Reminded me a little of Hodads in Ocean Beach,  San Diego. 

Great place to eat with great burgers.  Will be back again."}
{"text":"Rehab Burger Therapy makes an excellent burger stop! We have visited twice and were pleased with the food and environment on both visits. The staff is friendly and the food is always up to standards. My new favorite is the PB&J Sirracha burger; sounds unusual, but the sweet and the heat really work well together! My only reservation is that seating can be a bit tight when the restaurant is busy, but otherwise highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"Ok... Rian was our bartender... Dude was crazy amazing... Attention to detail... Burgers were cooked perfect... cocktails were amazing... everything about this place was great... Rian anticipated our needs amazingly... (no.. I have never met Rian before today)....

HIGHLY recommend!!"}
{"text":"Since moving to LA I have rekindled my love affair with the hamburger.  We were in Scottsdale for vacation and I came across this place on Yelp - so we went.

The good:
- decor is great
- prices are reasonable
- food is great (side note - I tried the Sriracha PB&J bacon burger.  Yep, you read that right.  It was ok.  I thought the PB took over the taste of the burger but it was definitely a different taste.  My wife loved her bacon cheese burger)
- sweet potato tots are a refreshingly different option - tasty

The not so good:
- I wouldn't say our server was overly attentive.  When she came by she was very friendly and attentive but she rarely came by.  I had finished my water (prob a 26oz cup) and waited for a while to get a refill.  Most other restaurants you barely get through 1/2 of your drink before a refill is offered.  

The service wasn't a deal breaker and I would probably go back.  I think you should give it a try!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite burger spots! My little family and I go here all the time! My personal favorites are the jalapeño popper burger the pb&j burger and the spinach salad they have. Great prices and always wonderful service. If you are looking for a awesome burger spot I highly recommend rehab!"}
{"text":"We read the reviews so wanted to try it out.  We got there at about 11:30 and we're glad we did by 11:40 it was packed.  We had the jalapeño burger and tots, it was very good.  The servers were really friendly."}
{"text":"Nice environment, good location, decent service.

Food is quite overpriced for what you receive.  I recently paid $12 for a burger, plus upcharges for pretzel bun and sub sides...  And it was certainly not worth the money.  The meat was dense and somewhat bland.  It tasted like it was prepared well ahead of time.

There are better options out there for burgers at those price points!"}
{"text":"This place was fantastic. The space is cool and the servers/bartenders are very friendly. Everything on the menu looked outstanding and worth trying. I went with their award winning PB&J burger. It's well worth the \"risk\". It was outstanding as were the sweet potato tots I got with it. They also have a great cocktail menu and a decent selection of beers. I would definitely hit this place frequently if I was a Scottsdale local."}
