{"text":"The food was good, but service was terrible. We were eating at the patio and It was quite cold and one of the waitress simply removed the heater that was next to our table without asking and moved close to another table. Service is definitely not a priority for Chileans"}
{"text":"Beautiful place. The food is very good but the service is horrid.  They took forever to even serve us water.  The only reason we were served water and wine is because we asked another waiter. In the future, I'll just do a simple tasting and skip in the food."}
{"text":"This is a very fine restaurant located on a beautiful vineyard. The staff here is very friendly, speaks english, and are very helpful with the menu and wine list.  We ordered a bottle of their gran reserve sav blanc. Absolutely delicious. To eat grilled shrimp, seared tuna with carrot and ginger puree, salmon ravioli with a pesto pec romano sauce, and lavender panna cotta for dessert. All were excellent!   Next we are in the area, we will be back."}
