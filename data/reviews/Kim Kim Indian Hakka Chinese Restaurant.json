{"text":"My wife and I used to visit this restaurant quite often when we finished work and needed a quick bite to eat (i.e. we didn't feel like making dinner). We usually ordered the crispy spicy beef to go. At the beginning everything was fine, however the last few times we ordered take out, the portions were very small. Furthermore, I ended up getting very sick.  Although the food can be tasty, I would caution customers regarding the quality of the food coming out of the kitchen. Also, since this is Hakka Chinese food, expect to consume A LOT of grease and spicy peppers."}
{"text":"Went here with my family based on reviews from yelp. Staff was very very nice.  Food was fantastic and servings absolutely huge.  Much tastier and less greasy than the more well known Scarborough places. Wish I lived in Scarborough. I'd be here once a week!!   My parents originally wanted to go to their standard place at pharmacy and sheppard, but I convinced them to try this based on yelp reviews.  Needless to say, they now have a new \"standard\" Hakka place."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant. I recommend spices and pepper chicken and mixed Hakka chow mein   Mmmm enjoy"}
{"text":"I can't believe how many great reviews this place got!!! I was desperate for some good hakka when the weather was crappy last week and didn't want to travel to my usual joint. The food was ready in ten minutes, but now I know why. I got stale and cold chilli chicken, rubbery (not) crispy beef and overcooked singapore noodles. Definitely not going back EVER!"}
{"text":"Hadn't been to Kim Kim in years. Grabbed a couple items to carry out and it was quick and reasonably priced. The quality of the food is just as great ad it used to be.  The service was very good, the young lady at the counter very helpful.  I will be back soon."}
{"text":"Took a friend from out of town. He was very impressed trying Hakka for the first time. I was too! Had the shrimp Pekora, Hunan Chucken, Manchurian Fried rice, Beef and Veg Cashew. All very good and tasty. Not many people on a late Thursday evening so server was very attentive. Good portions the 3 of us didnt even finish. I will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"Went for a friend's birthday and it took a while to get food but there were about 12 people. The food was great and not too spicy. HUGE menu and great prices."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years now. Love this place. They always have you're  food ready on time. And you can always ask them to make it spicy and they will make it the way you ask for. Crispy and spicy just the way I like it.  Best Hakka restaurant ever."}
{"text":"Family run restaurant. Lots of parking.  Fast service.  Spicy food.  I recommend the spicy chicken ball.  I think its in the appetiser section.  Portions are huuuuge!! I can't handle spicy food in general but I find their dishes had just enough spice to bring out the flavours.  You can always ask for extra spicy or even ask for hot sauce on the side if you're feeling adventurous."}
{"text":"I rate this place **** 1/2 stars.  Sure it won't look like a highly rated restaurant from the outside (actually it doesn't look like it from the inside either) but when I get a craving for good hakka food that doesn't give me horrid stomach problems *cough**Lin Garden**cough*, this is the place I go!  Depending on how many people I am with, I usually order the Chili Crispy Beef, Chili Chicken, Chicken Pakoras, Manchurian Fried Rice, and occasionally the spicy calamari. When asked \"spicy or mild?\" I always get \"extra spicy please!\" and it brings a smile to the waitresses faces. But don't torture yourself if you can't handly spicy, I find that many of my friends find \"mild\" quite spicy already so don't overdo it or you'll miss out on the flavour.  I've been to almost all the frequented Hakka places in Scarborough, Markham and a few in North York. I think Kim Kim's has one of the best (if not THE best) Crispy Beef! Why? Because it's actually crispy!!! How many other places offer their soggy version of crispy beef and pass it off as authentic. Kim Kims doesn't mess around. Their chili chicken is good, though at times I find I'm eating more breading than chicken. Chicken pakoras are the bomb-diggity as well!  I love eating at this place with our group of 8-10, eating like Kings with more than enough food to go around, and getting the split bill of $7-8 PER PERSON! Yes...they split bills :)  My go-to place for cheap, delicious, no-nonsense Hakka food any day of the week. Too bad they close at 10pm though."}
{"text":"Horrible chilli chicken, batter was mushy and the chicken was dry. Came out literally 1-2 minutes after ordering (microwaved and was NOT cooked from fresh)"}
{"text":"Amazing Hakka food! We ordered the vegetarian masala chow mein, Manchurian veggie fried rice, Chilli paneer and spring rolls. Very fast and friendly service. A hidden gem in Kennedy Rd. The restaurant is clean and spacious. We went on a hot summer day and they had fans on which was great."}
{"text":"Great value for lunch ($6 for a large portion), good food, fast and friendly service, had the chilli chicken but would try other items next time"}
{"text":"I have ordered from Kim Kim on two separate occasions, once as take-out and the other sitting in the restaurant. The food overall was tasty, met expectations and was definitely priced fairly. While their regular menu is not expensive, the lunch deals are phenomenal with most meals priced at less than $7 before tax which comes with a carb (rice or noodles) and a side. The service is quick, snappy and to the point. Some might like a more personal connection with a restaurant staff, but in a place like this it's all about the food. My only qualm about the experience was the hot pepper oil, which didn't have much of a flavour except for the bitterness of old oil. Other than that, it is definitely a spot to check out for quick and easy Hakka lunch in the Scarborough area."}
{"text":"Not bad....not as spicy as what I'm used to at federicks..I prefer federicks tho...restaurant is a little run down. Food is not bad..we had Manchurian noodles, chilli chicken and chicken pakora..but its not the best we ever had...it was nice the owner gave us some cilantro chutney to sample with the pakora..that was pretty delicious."}
{"text":"This is definitely the best Hakka fare in Scarborough!  The inside atmosphere is nice, the service is always excellent, and it's not very expensive, either.  I love their chili chicken, manchurian fried rice, pakoras... there's so much that's delicious on their menu that you've just got to try it all!  I frequent a lot of Hakka restaurants in the GTA, and I must say that this one is near the top!"}
{"text":"Was looking for food in the area, found this hakka place. Not bad. But not my fave hakka place. Had the combo with fried rice, chilli chicken and hot n sour soup. Chilli chicken is pretty good. Rest is decent-standard."}
{"text":"Friend took me and we order a few dishes to share. First thing was the hot n sour soup, it was delicious just the perfect amount of heat. Second we ordered the lunch special chili fish on steamed rice. Very nice sauce fish was done perfectly. Lots of sauce to mix with the rice it was very good as well. Good attentive service but the dining room is very cafeteria style, still a place to seat and eat I guess. I would definitely go back. The reason I gave a 4 out of 5 was the lack of decor, but food was definitely a 5 out of 5"}
{"text":"Kim Kim is another restaurant that I often go to for Hakka food. They offer really good dishes. I would usually order masala fried rice, chicken hunan, crispy chili beef, crispy Cantonese chow mein, tandoori, chicken pakora and a side of hot and sour soup. Their portions are quite big so definitely worth dining in. Their spice level ranges from mild to very spicy. If you've never had hakka food before then this is a great spot to try!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love Hakka and after checking out the reviews we decided to try Kim Kim and have been going here frequently.  What my husband loves the most is the chili chicken, this is the only place that has ever offered options (dry or with gravy, extra spicy).  Their Cantonese chow main is good.  Tried their hot and sour soup was delicious but really spicy.  Took some time eating it but did eventually finish it.  We stick to that order but looking to try other things on their menu. When we do I will update this review."}
{"text":"Have been buying for over a year now. The portions are great, it tastes fresh and it is always consistent in quality. Chili chicken is a favorite but haven't tried anything here that hasn't been bursting with flavors."}
{"text":"Love this place come here every chance we get. The portion of food are big and full of goodness. The prices are really good and best part always left overs to take home.. If you haven't been then go you won't be disappointed... Cheers."}
{"text":"First time being here in over 5 years and its still really delicious. Ordered the Bombay chicken and chilli chicken and both were incredible. Good quantity for the price and the servers were extremely polite and helpful."}
{"text":"I went here recently with my parents for a late lunch.  Mondays through Fridays from 11:30am to 3pm they have a lunch special where you get a choice of main course with steamed rice and hot and sour soup or 2 spring rolls or a can of pop for $5.75.  We started with 2 appetizers, the Thread Chicken ($6.99) and the Chicken Pakora ($8.75) and then we had 3 lunch specials ($5.75 each): Chili Chicken, Satay Beef and Manchurian Beef.  I got the hot and sour soup, my dad got the spring rolls and my mom got a can of ginger ale.   The hot and sour soup was ok.  It was spicier than at most places.  It was full of mushrooms, egg and tofu.  They also had carrots, peas and corn in it.  No bamboo and it was less gelatinous than at some places.  My dad said the spring rolls were not that great.  They were vegetarian and didn't have much filling in them.    The Thread Chicken was the highlight of the meal for me.  It's pieces of spicy chicken surrounded by pieces of noodles and then deep fried.  It's crunchy on the outside and then soft and spicy on the inside.  Totally awesome.  You get 5 pieces and they are the size of chicken fingers that you get in the frozen department of supermarkets (but infinitely tastier than those chicken fingers).    The Chicken Pakora were too salty and oily in my opinion.  They are pieces of chicken and onions dipped in chickpea batter and then deep fried.  You get 12 pieces, each the size of a golf ball.  They were crispy on the outside and the chicken was a little chewy.  They were not my favourite, but my parents really enjoyed them.  I got the Chili Chicken dry (without gravy).  This was the best of the lunch specials that we tried.  The chicken is lightly breaded and then fried in a chili sauce with onions.  I got it medium spicy and it was perfect.  The chicken was moist and juicy and bursting with chili goodness.  My dad's Satay Beef was ok.  It was stir-fried with carrots, onions, pineapple, and green peppers.  The beef was tender and there was a good amount of it.  However, I didn't feel that this dish was anything special.  My mom's Manchurian Beef was probably my least favourite.  It was beef in this black gravy.  It looked really unappetizing.  The taste was a bit unusual, not necessarily bad, but hard to describe.     We had lots of leftovers, enough for dinner for the 3 of us.  The portions are huge and the prices awesome (especially if you just get the lunch special and no appetizers).    It's in a strip mall with lots of parking.  Washrooms are clean, as is the dining area.  Service is nice and competent.  I would come back!"}
{"text":"This restaurant made me eat chicken for the very first time. The chicken lollipops tasted really good and the chili corn. One of the best Indo-Chinese restaurants I've ever been too. I would highly recommend this restaurant"}
{"text":"I HAD to try this place out being that I was in the area over Mother's Day weekend, I had to see what all the rave was about.  After all, I LOVE Hakka and have had my fair share of it around the GTA, why not add this one to the list too right?   Ordered the chili chicken lunch special (we asked for hot and sour soup being one of the choices that come with the lunch specials, the other two choices are either pop or an egg roll) and one Hakka beef noodle dish from their regular menu.   Our first request (& we do this every time we go to any hakka restaurant is ask them to make any of the dishes we order spicy) to have the beef hakka noodles spicy was confusingly denied by the waitress claiming \"no, sorry they can't do that\" When the noodle dish was brought out, I was looking at it, and in my head thinking, OK, I know what spaghetti looks and tastes like, and I bet you anything that this \"noodle\" dish is spaghetti. I tried it, yup, spaghetti. To our disappointment, we asked the waitress if it was spaghetti, we mentioned that we didn't like the taste of it either (which we really didn't as it was overly salty, very bland and barely had any beef in it whatsoever) and then asked if we could get another dish of our choice.  & the plot thickens....  The waitress took the noodle dish and had to ask the cooks to see what they could do, and then brought the same dish back out, pointing at it and claiming \" that this is what we serve here, and you ate so much of it, I don't know what we can do\" O.o Before getting into any further debate of why Hakka noodles are different from spaghetti, the waitress took the dish and took our, for the Singapore rice shrimp and chicken noodle Hakka dish instead. When that was brought out, it just tasted soooo SALTY! Again, not much chicken or shrimp in it either.   The chili chicken and soup? Salty. *sigh* such a disappointment."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here last week and really enjoyed every dish we ordered! We came in for an early dinner - around 4:30pm - and were the only ones eating in the restaurant.   The set up is very simple and far from fine dining, but the service is fast and friendly and the dining area is neat and clean. Located in a strip mall, there is ample parking as well which was nice!  We ordered the tandori chicken, crispy chili beef and hakka chow mein. Every single portion was extremely generous! A HUGE plate of noodles for such a small price! The chicken was so good, I had never had anything like it before! Spicy and tangy, excellent flavor and texture. Lots of chicken and vegetables. The beef was great, too - dry and crispy and full of flavor! Definitely spicy but not overwhelming.   We had tons of leftovers and the bill was under $30. Will definitely come again, can't wait to try new dishes!"}
{"text":"Spent a Sunday afternoon on Kennedy Rd. looking at blinds and furniture. This would have been a fruitless afternoon save for our stumbling upon Kim Kim Indian Hakka Chinese Restaurant. As we're quite familiar with Lin Garden and Frederick, our Hakka bar has been set pretty high. To our pleasant surprise Kim Kim was up to the challenge. The Chili Chicken was exactly as expected and the Manchurian Fried Rice was spicier and included shrimp, a welcome addition. The portions of the two dishes were humongous for the $20 price tag and we happily enjoyed them for dinner again that night. We would be back if the location was closer to our home."}
{"text":"As cheerful and cheery as it gets for Hakka food. It's super tasty and addictivie. I found myself coming back often for take away when I was around the east end."}
{"text":"I love hakka food!  The fish pakora was so fresh and yummy I wish I can have them all the time! the tandori chicken stirfry was... interesting - it's like a tandori/chinese fusion. I think i prefer the traditional tandori chicken better. Veggie balls were not what i was expecting - there's a lot of corn in them, i like in other restaurants there's more cabbage and other vegetables. on that note: is corn even a vegetable? it's starchy and full of simple carbs, like potatoes.   The flavor overall was pretty amazing, I will come back and try other stuff on the menu (they seem to have a quite extensive menu!) and fish pakora of course!  10% off with check in yelp was legit!"}
{"text":"Huge hakka fan! This one is one of those that you either like or you don't. The soups, fried rice and the noodles are really good and have a massive serving size. The chili  chicken is not the best in town but is still above average. The meat here is always fresh and well cooked unlike most places. Fast service, friendly staff and a very clean environment like it should be."}
{"text":"Came here for a quick work lunch and it wasn't too busy. Tried the chili chicken dry with white rice and chicken pakoras. Very happy with the dry chili chicken, which had enough sauce to make the rice flavourful. It was delicious and I would order again! The chicken pakoras had a slight tangy taste which I didn't enjoy as much, but the portion was good and my coworker seemed to like.  Overall, would come back and get their lunch special again."}
{"text":"-Big interior -Friendly staff, -Superior chili chicken  -Excellent chinken pakoras  -Web coupons from time to time  A very good Hakka restaurant, if you find yourself in Scarborough for reasons unknown, it is worth stepping in and ordering some delicious food, youcannot go wrong."}
{"text":"Looking for a place to eat and stumbled on Kim Kim. Sparse decor but clean. The waitress was quick and efficient: she took our orders, brought us water, brought out our soup and spring rolls right after and before we finished them, she brought out our entrees.  We ordered the lunch specials: General Tso Chicken very spicy with hot and sour soup and egg fried rice (additional $1.75) also Manchurian Beef med spicy with spring rolls and egg fried rice (additional $1.75).  The hot and and sour soup was ok, but we had to occasionally stir it because it would separate. The top of the soup would be watery and all the flavor would be at the bottom, I've never had that happen before. The spring rolls were crispy on the outside but soggy on the inside, not good. The egg friend rice was a little dry but it was fine since our dishes were saucy.  All in all a decent place to grab some Hakka food that will leave you full and with some extra money in your pocket."}
{"text":"I wrote a review years ago and since then I've been many many times and its still great.    I've made huge orders for family get together and orders just for two and have never been disappointed.  I think i've had about 60% of the menu at this point and its still my favorite hakka place."}
{"text":"Initially we were heading to another place to get our grub on...but imagine our surprise when we pulled up to the other restaurant and they were closed!  No worries - Yelp to the rescue!  It took us here and we weren't disappointed.  This place is't as nice inside as Fed's, but its clean and actually bigger than we thought from the outside.  The servers were really nice and made some suggestions.  We had the chicken pakoras (I liked Fed's better as I found them crispier and these ones oilier); tandoori fish (dry) which comes with a big bowl of rice (my fave meal here so far) and the crispy dry green beans.  These are drier than Fed's but I didn't mine them.  It's in your preference.  Definitely going to come back and try some different dishes and of course get my fish!  We had so much left over as the portions are a good size.  For 2 people including drinks, tax and tip the bill was $40"}
{"text":"A fried recommend this place and it's worth it. Very solid Hakka food. Their fish and shrimp is very tasty. We loved the Mirchi Corn. Most of the folks dinging in there are desi and so the servers do ask if you want the food spicy. We loved the Bombay Fish. The Chicken Shrimp rice is always a favourite. The place is crowded but the servers do their best to make sure that they get you seated at the earliest. It's a good place and I'd definitely come back here again."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Hakka take out in Scarborough. Food is always delicious, staff is friendly and call ahead order is ready when you pick it up.  Best dishes are Hakka Tandoori Chicken, Lollipop Chicken & Singapore Fried Rice."}
{"text":"The ten percent off check-in offer is legit!  Think of it as a fusion of Chinese and Indian cuisine. A great place to try if you're looking for a slightly different taste.  The fish is excellent here. Mild spice is actually quite mild, so if you want to taste some spice go for medium  The Pakoras are great and.  I didn't like the Lollipop Chicken that much. Just not my thing.  The noodles we tried were ok, but certainly were not a highlight.  I will gladly return."}
{"text":"It's been a while since I ate at Kim Kim. Went to visit my cousin and decided to take her here to try it since she lives not too far from it. We ordered Chilli Chicken, Singapore Noodle with chicken and shrimp, Fish Pakotas and their traditional steamed rice. They haven't lost there touch and I will always go back for more because it's delicious, hot, fresh and fast. I wasn't too happy with the shrimp pakota that I ordered to go for a friend but overall, the food is great."}
{"text":"Have come here umpteen times over the last 6 years or so, for dine-in and take-out. Tried many different dishes--enjoyed all of them but Mixed Pakora and Chili Chicken are outstanding! Staff are wonderful, portions generous, parking ample. Always have leftovers to take home. Very good prices. Love their food!"}
{"text":"A very nice place to eat. The prices are good and the food is tasty. The inside is quite cozy. Friendly customer service too. For those who are new to Hakka food, it is Indian style Chinese food. So it can be spicy -- be warned!"}
{"text":"Kim kim is a pretty decent Hakka Chinese Restaurant, with mediocre interior decor and just tables and chairs.  I had been there couple of times , and I tried Chilli Paneer Dry and Chilli Chicken Dry. Both of em were average. They have raw broccoli in their Fried Rice which is a big no no for me. Spice wise , it's not that of a spicy even If it is three hot peppers. Manager came and checked on us and was refilling our glasses. Overall it was average."}
{"text":"Have now been back several times.  Truly a delightful little restaurant."}
{"text":"It was our first Hakka and we had a great experience.  Cannot compare to other Hakka places, but we frequently go to Indian and various Chinese restaurants and we were not disoriented by the menu.    Everything we had was excellent.  Our kids (3,5 and 7), who have a good tolerance to spicy food, loved their meal too.    We started with hot and sour soups and very good chicken pakoras.  Followed with chili crispy beef (loved it!), bok choys and Hakka chow mein (which had less character than the other items but was still good).  Friendly and helpful service.  All in all, we had an excellent experience and definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch specials and quick takeout.  Casual seating. Lunchtime doesn't get too busy but many people get takeout here.  I came here for lunch on a week day and they have great deals for lunch specials, including chili chicken with rice for less than $10! You get a good portion of chicken, dried or with gravy, and a side of either spring rolls or soup I think. Also tried the chicken pakoras and they were tasty and they come with 12 in one order which is quite a bit! Keep in mind that it took about 8-10 minutes for the pakoras to be cooked. We originally wanted vegetable pakoras but it would have taken 20 minutes. In total for the chili chicken lunch + chicken pakoras ended up costing $20 including taxes and tip. I'd definitely come here again for lunch whenever I'm craving a flavourful and heavier meal."}
{"text":"Amazing food, great service, clean restaurant and very affordable prices!"}
{"text":"This is quickly becoming an excuse to travel out to Kennedy. Been here quite a few times over the last year and have enjoyed many a dish here. Can't say exactly which is my favorite yet But i bet the Hunan Chicken ranks up there.  Only wish it was a lot closer so i could come by more often  Definitely recommend this place"}
{"text":"Good food and great prices. Chilly chicken and Hunan chicken are my usual when I go here"}
{"text":"Kim Kim ... more like yum yum !   Kim Kim was recommended by some friends as THE place for Hakka food in TO, I had to try.   Location Kim Kim is located in a sketchy plaza ( maybe it was dark?), I nearly missed it when I was driving.  Plenty of parking tho. Lots of tables, 10 +.   Staff and service Waiting staff was friendly and efficient. They sat down the menu, and brought the drink orders in no time. The food came within 10 mins. It was steaming hot! The waitress checked our table a couple of times thru out the meal. At the end, they brought to go counters without any prompt. In addition to dine in, they also do take outs.   Food and portion  So very delicious. Must try the paneer. I never had anything like how they prepare it. The Kim Kim house special fish was good too.  Please note, unlike most places, they provide complimentary rice. With our 2 dishes, they gave us tonnes of rice. Without knowing we would get the rice, we ordered noodles. It was a huge plate, however it was a little plain.   Overall  Very good. Will go back!"}
{"text":"Soooo good!! Try the chicken masala fried rice and the lollipop chicken!!"}
{"text":"I went with a group from the dining group I belong to, it is certainly a new experience for me as I am not familiar with Hakka Chinese food.  Essentially Hakka Chinese food is a fusion of Chinese and Indian cooking so it is like spicy Cantonese cuisine.  There is a whole history of the tribes of Chinese who settled in India or vice versa...the details are not clear to me, but I will make a point of looking it up.  The truth is out there...somewhere.  The dishes ordered were: - Chicken Lollipops (spicy) X - Hakka Noodles - Kung Pow Chicken (really spicy) - Mixed Vegetables - Shrimp in Lobster Sauce X - Dry Fried Calamari (spicy) X - Crispy Beef (spicy) X  Most of the dishes were really good they are the ones with the X next to them on my list.  Some of the group were more critical, but then again I do not have anything to compare with as a base line.  Nonetheless, the top dish for me was the Shrimp in Lobster Sauce (with rice).  It is really the closest to the real thing that I've ever had.  So good in fact that I ordered a take out order to bring home.  I am looking forward to our next Hakka food outing when ever that will be.  Overall: 4/5 Food: 4/5 Service: 4/5"}
{"text":"I just tried their chili crispy beef at Kim Kim for lunch. It was about 9 bucks and you get a fairly substantial plate of perfectly cooked and addictive beef.  I am no expert at chili crispy beef as I've only had it a couple of times elsewhere, Kim Kim is by far the best.  The dish is loaded with sauteed onion and lots of chili pepper.  The beef is crispy which is not always true at other places.  The dish overall is 'dry', which is a good thing and thus the beef remained crispy.  It comes with a bowl of steamed rice and I polished it off.  It was a lot of food for lunch and given the wide selection of lunch specials available for under 6 bucks, the chili crispy beef was a splurge item and it was well worth it.  I've tried chili chicken before and it was also good.  Service was attentive and were good at refilling water and taking dishes away when were were done.   One advice though...if you ever feel like ordering a glass of red wine at Kim Kim, make sure you ask them how fresh the bottle is.  The following exchange took place :  Co-worker: \"Hmmm...this wine tastes a little off, how long ago was this bottle opened?\" Waitress: \"Oh, that was opened last week!\" Co-worker: \"Oh, really? Like seriously last week? Today is Friday, so the wine's been opened for 7 days?\" Waitress: \"Ya, not too many people order red wine here.  It's really a matter of luck if you get a fresh glass!\" Co-worker: \"Hahaha...I wish I knew that before I ordered it.\"  Waitress: \"Haha...ya, guess its not your lucky day today!\"   My co-worker drank the 'off' wine and definitely need to time his wine order better next time.   One last thing that knocked the one star off was they charge 1.25 for chinese tea.  I was a little surprised to see the charge but realized they put a tea bag in a teapot, my co-workers all got a tea cup, so if you are going to order Chinese tea, be prepared to pay.   I will continue to come back for the chili crispy beef whenever I have the craving for it."}
{"text":"I went on a Friday night. The staff was friendly. There is a lot of seating and the decor is good enough. The food came out around 10 minutes after we ordered (or maybe even less time, I don't remember for sure). The Manchurian chicken/shrimp fried rice was pretty good. The KimKim special chicken was excellent. We packed leftovers in takeaway containers and had them the next day for lunch. The prices are very reasonable for the amount of food you get. Considering that the price for 2 entrees after tax and tip was under $25, I couldn't expect any more."}
{"text":"There was a point in my life where my family and I ate here every week. The combination of great customer service and delicious Hakka food kept us hooked. The staff is super prompt with seating and bringing out food. They're also good with take-out orders which are usually ready in less than 15 minutes.  Unlike other restaurants, their spice level is pretty accurate and mild is actually mild. Some of my favourite dishes include crispy ginger beef, chilli chicken with gravy, beef and broccoli, chicken with black bean sauce, and deep fried banana with ice cream for dessert."}
{"text":"Great food, lots of choices, reasonably priced!  I've had take out from here twice, and everything I've gotten was fantastic!  Surprisingly, my least favorite was the hot and sour soup.  The Calcutta chicken and Calcutta fish is great!  Food was ready in a jiffy, and service was friendly!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service, Calcutta chicken is great if you like heat! Only very local delivery, and cash only"}
{"text":"Food was really good. We normally get Hakka from fredericks or Lynn garden but wanted to try a new restaurant. We order General Tao chicken, chili chicken and masala noodles. Everything was delicious. I would definitely come back here"}
{"text":"Big quantity low quality food. Service was good though. Can be improved. Prices are good not very expensive. They are better hakka places in toronto though"}
{"text":"Simply tasty servings. Decent staff and amazing food. We ordered hot and sour soup, a medium portion was enough for three people. Then we ordered the Calcutta chicken which is superb and the manchurian chicken again splendidly prepared. They also gave a lot of rice. I would be back there for sure when I am in Scarborough area."}
{"text":"Awesome place! Nice atmosphere and really excellent food. The hostess was warm and welcoming. I recommend this place to anyone who loves Chinese. I'd come here again in a heartbeat!"}
