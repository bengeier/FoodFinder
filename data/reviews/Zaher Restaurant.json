{"text":"Delicious food and wonderful service. Everything was very fresh and tasted really good. Absolutely recommend it for anyone, including vegetarians!"}
{"text":"This was a new discovery for us. It was through \"vegetarian restaurant\" keyword, however only one dish was vegetarian. We weren't so bothered by that (we're happy when we can find 1). That being said, food was a bit slow to come and was a bit on the cold side. Nevertheless, we hope to see them add more vegan options in the future as it was very delicious."}
{"text":"Late lunch/dinner here. Got the charbroiled beef skewer platter..forgot what it was called. Meat was tasty. Persian rice made with saffron very flavourful. Nothing particularly fancy. Solid meal. The dressing for the side salad was a little too acidic for my taste.  That's my only real complaint. Service was prompt though only three tables occupied in the restaurant when I arrived since it was an odd time of day. Noticed the keyboard in the corner on a mini stage and disco lights. Does the place party it up in the evening?"}
