{"text":"I just discovered this place a few weeks ago and I was very pleased! Coming from Vancouver, I am always on the look-out for cheap sushi that is tasty and doesn't skimp on the salmon and this is one of the best places for that in the city. Sure sure, their service isn't very awesome, but you can't have it all! We ate the sushi at the resto and I didn't think it took too long - maybe that's the way to do it (as compared to delivery). Looking forward to eating this sushi in the summer on the mountain :)"}
{"text":"My husband and I have ordered from here many times and while the sushi is very tasty, it takes way too long.  We live downtown and from the plateau, it always takes over a hour for delivery.  The last time we ordered, we got our sushi after 2 hours! I called and asked for a discount given that we waited two hours and she said \"No, your order was small so it takes a long time for delivery\".  Their menu says delivery over $15, and my order was $28.  No discount, and when I told her she'd be losing our business, she just said that was fine and hung up.  Not ordering from here again."}
{"text":"Première fois que j'y allais avec un ami, assez étrange de dehors, mais comme on dit, c'est la beauté intérieure qui compte (et c'est le cas!). Nous sommes entrés. C'est un petit restaurant pour take-out principalement mais il y a 3-4 tables pour ceux qui mangent sur place. Employés accueillants et courtois. On vous donne un petit menu pour commander. Les choix sont multiples. Moi étant un gourmand, je sais que je mange pour une famille de 4 personnes. Alors on a commandé et on a pas regretté! Je vous conseille de goûter au ''Chanel No10'' qui sont des sushi tempura avec des garnitures de fruits de mer. Écoeurante! Les portions sont très généreuses (gros morceaux) et le prix est très compétitif. La propriétaire était très gentille avec nous. Je n'ai pas regretté d'être entrer dans ce resto. J'y retournerais!"}
{"text":"Long time fan of Sushi 111.  I used to live a block away from their previous location (at 111 Mont-Royal W) but moved several years ago.  I was *just* outside of Sushi 111's delivery zone, so I experimented with other options.  Most were fine, but definitely of the same caliber as 111.    So imagine my surprise when one rainy evening last summer I was walking along Mont-Royal and spotted the familiar takeout menu in a window, looked up and sure enough: 111 was back in business!  Bigger than the previous location that was tiny, if the situation presented itself I would definitely consider eating in at this location.  However until now I have only done takeout and delivery.    Like their previous location, the sushi is delicious!  Even just plain old avocado hosomakis are delicious, with gigantic pieces of avocado.  The rice is just perfect too.  I like that they have a bunch of different combinations you don't see elsewhere, and everything I've sampled has been great.  I'm docking them one star for service issues.  I'm not difficult at all, but there have been a few hiccups along the way.  I usually order via just-eat.ca for convenience (I can easily repeat the same thing as last time)  and often I will get a call telling me my order is ready waaaaay ahead of the time I indicated I would be picking up.  Not a big deal, except that I've had the opposite happen too: I show up when just-eat says my order will be ready, to have to wait a few minutes (no biggie, just inconsistent).  Depending on who is working you might get met with attitude \"what do you mean you're here already?\" or a super friendly \"Sit yourself down and relax a few minutes!\"  The other little hiccup I\"ve encountered is that for the longest of time it seems they didn't update their delivery zone postal codes from their old location, which means my old address could get delivery but not my new one (despite living a 10 minute walk away).  They seemed to have fixed it on their website now, but not yet on just-eat.ca last I checked.  Small details that take a place from good to great.    But don't worry Sushi 111, I'll be back!"}
{"text":"This is our neighborhood sushi place.  It's the next block over from a Sushi Shop, but as long as it's open I'll always go to Sushi 111 for takeout.  They have an extensive and creative menu, with prices on par with any other sushi place.  My bf and I will often stop in and choose a couple of rolls to share, and are always satisfied with what we get.  For less than $20 the two of us can enjoy a nice lunch or light supper (they always include a couple of avocado or cucumber rolls with orders over 10$, which rounds things out well).  The only downside is that it always takes awhile to prepare, but at least that means it's fresh, no rolls that have been sitting around for us!"}
{"text":"Cela fait maintenant plus d'un an que je commande des sushis chez Sushi 111 et c'est un véritable plaisir à chaque fois. Nous avons bien essayé de voir chez les concurrents quelques fois mais à chaque fois la même conclusion tombait \"on aurait encore dû prendre les sushis de Sushi 111...\".  Nous leur sommes donc maintenant très fidèles! Sushis moins chers que la concurrence, plus originaux et plus goûtus!  Avec une grosse commande ils n'hésitent jamais à vous en rajouter des gratuits!"}
{"text":"Un ami m'a emporter ici l'été dernier, que c'était sa place préférée. Le décor du restaurant à l'intérieur est simple, une vingtaine de places assises. Service était courtois et rapide. Mais le vrai review, c'est sur la livraison. Du sushi, j'en ai commandé souvent, mais je peux dire qu'à chaque fois que j'ai commandé là, j'ai TOUJOURS été satisfait de la qualité de la nourriture! Je vous recommande fortement de les contacter directement au lieu de passé par Just Eat. Vous sauvez des frais + à l'achat de 54.95$ et plus, vous recevrez 5 ou 6 maki de DragonEye, sont trop bon. Les avocats sont toujours ultra frais. Allez y simple, prenez les spéciaux du chef, vous serez ravi de ce que vous allez recevoir. Ma recommandation serait d'avoir un fichier de livraison, pour qu'à chaque fois que je commande, juste en donnant mon numéro de téléphone, qu'ils verraient mon adresse directement. Mais sinon continuer votre bon service (Ils livrent dans hochelaga!)"}
{"text":"This is hands-down the best sushi in Montreal. I used to come here weekly at their other location on mont royal and Esplanade. The rice is always fresh and perfectly seasoned, the fish is delicious and fresh and everything is a rolled with love. They have a special sesame sauce that no other sushi place has. I have tried every sushi place on the plateau and this is by far the best. Really friendly service, if you come here regularly, they treat you like family"}
{"text":"I ordered the assorted plate of 28 items and the seaweed salad for my roommate and I and unfortunately we were very disappointed. We normally order from Royal Sushi, and find that though their sushi is good, their delivery can be a bit slow (45-75 mins.). Sushi 111 delivered in about half an hour which was great, but the delivery man told us that he couldn't provide a receipt, and then rounded up the price so that he was automatically given a tip (we still gave him a 5 dollar tip because we were excited to chow down).   The yelp reviews for Sushi 111 are quite good, so I assumed that my roommate and I would be equally satisfied, but to our unfortunate surprise, the fish was not fresh at all! A crust had formed around it and the avocado was beginning to turn brown. I think this was the first time we actually couldn't bring ourselves to finish sushi. Don't waste your money."}
