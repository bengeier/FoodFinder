{"text":"Cute place, kinda tucked away. The food was okay. I got bacon, egg and cheese biscuit and he got some sort of chicken biscuit with a not so appealing sauce on it. 

I got food poisoning after visiting. So we won't be rushing back."}
{"text":"Walked into Roots on a Sunday afternoon stroll . Enjoyed a light brunch with delicious coffee. The ambiance was great.For brunch I tried the Latkes with two sunny side up eggs and lightly swirl with sour cream.
The staff at Roots was amazing and welcoming. Will definitely be back soon to try the local brew and wine."}
{"text":"Been here twice and great experience both times. The BLAT is amazing. For breakfast recommend the burrito with bacon. It's a sweet potato wrap that is sooo good!"}
{"text":"Came in for the first time for the Thursday night wine tasting and had an amazing experience thanks to Aaron! Great wine, great food, and great atmosphere to hang out with friends on a weekday night! Came back for brunch (at the recommendation of Aaron) and it did not disappoint! Would recommend roots cafe for anyone whether you are looking for a dinner and wine with friends or just a place to grab a coffee in the morning!"}
{"text":"No high chairs. How can a restaurant be open for several months and advertise as kid friendly but not have one high chair in the whole place?! Unreal."}
{"text":"Meh, just ok. None of the staff was friendly, kind of acted bothered that we came in. Sat morning 11am for breakfast. Menu small but ok. I think prices are high in comparison to the quality and experience."}
{"text":"The most cutest spot in Charlotte. The setting is very cozy with an emphasis on nature at the hanging vines hang from the ceiling and the bamboo chandeliers. The food did not disappoint. The ingredients were fresh and refreshing to the body and mind. With a wonderful cold brew coffee to get you through the afternoon drag. We will return very soon for more."}
{"text":"Yum!! Had the kale grits and would definitely have those again! Menu choices are unique, farm fresh and delicious!"}
{"text":"Went today and my breakfast was amazing. Perfect portions and the latkes were so good! The service was amazing and definitely a place I could've hung out for hours in feeling totally relaxed. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Visiting from Asheville and we decided to get breakfast at this place. Food was OKAY nothing to rave about. I got a breakfast burrito which was more like a breakfast wrap and my husband got the latke which he felt like it was still cold and flavorless. The coffee seemed to be somewhat better than the food."}
{"text":"I used to love visiting the food truck when I worked uptown and the cafe did not disappoint! The chicken and dumplings were outstanding."}
{"text":"Cozy cafe in southend, feels like a hideaway! My friend and I were searching for some caffeine & lunch in south end. We found Roots cafe and they have great coffee and a quality lunch menu. I had the coconut milk latte with cold brew coffee. It was amazing and strong and lovely flavors of coconut! The turkey sandwich had goat cheese (my favorite food) and pickled red onions and cucumber and it was delicious! I have never liked onions but pickled red onion, with the turkey and goat cheese was yummy. Each sandwich comes with a side, I chose the pickled cucumbers, nice flavor. They also have wine and beer and kombucha, so I must return. The vibe at 11 a.m. was cozy and private and great for conversations. The parking lot is tiny but it seems like you can park on the street too. Service was great, awesome people !!  I had previously eaten their catering food at a Christmas party so I knew they had good eats!"}
{"text":"Cute breakfast place. Had the breakfast burrito on special. BEST BREAKFAST BURRITO IVE HAD! Love the atmosphere here with the plants too. Coffee was good. Service was great too!"}
{"text":"I placed an order for pick up online. When I got there, I had to wait behind a customer that was ordering. I told the lady I had a pick up and she seemed confused. She asked how I placed it and I told her online. Had to wait about 15 minutes and the lady that placed her order there received her food before I did. This is the second time I've ordered for pick up and it wasn't ready.  I should have at least gotten my food before the lady that just placed her order."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed coming here last Saturday. Not so much for the food but for the atmosphere. It is a nice quaint little restaurant that does not feel like Charlotte. There are plants and cool accidents all over the restaurant. Saturdays and Sundays are brunch only so that is a little bit of a letdown. I got the chicken and biscuits which came with cornmeal biscuits and chicken thigh chicken. So keep that in mind when you order if you're partial to those selections. They have cold brew coffee on tap and the staff was very friendly. It is a small restaurant so city may be limited."}
{"text":"This is one of those reviews I'm hesitant to give because I don't want anyone else to be in on the secret! 

Roots Cafe is just lovely. It is one of our favorite spots for a weekend breakfast. The atmosphere is so calm and homey, the staff is always kind and friendly, and the menu offerings are tasty! 

We usually order two entrees and then share. The menu seems to change often, I'm not sure if it's just because they are new and trying to figure out what works or they just like to keep things fresh. So far, our favorites have been: the roots hash, the Spanish style tortilla, the latkes and the breakfast burrito. We also had a biscuit sandwich once, that has since disappeared, but I wanted to shout out that biscuit, it was quality! The coffee drinks are well done and the every changing assortment of baked goods are always fresh. 

I really recommend this for a low-key, high quality breakfast stop!"}
{"text":"This is a cool little cafe. 

I stopped in with a girlfriend to grab a glass of wine and we shared a few apps. 

The place wasn't very busy and the service was okay. We shared a bottle of wine and order the roasted butternut and beets with feta, roasted brussel sprouts with cider glaze and bacon and cauliflower gratin. 

Hands down...my favorite dish was the cauliflower gratin. Seriously, this dish is a requirement when you visit. It's baked cauliflower in a cream sauce, with parmesan and a pinch of nutmeg. It is fantastic. The brussel sprouts were a close second. It's something about bacon that makes every dish tastes better. 

I'll have to come back and try their breakfast and dinner items but overall this place was a-ok!"}
{"text":"Jacob and I stopped in here for a light afternoon snack and we made a great choice. If you are looking for a light brunch or light lunch this place is great. I didn't give them 5 stars because I would have liked to see 1 or 2 more options for food, but the food we did order tasted great. At one point Jacob looked at me and said \"wow I just found myself eating this as if I haven't had food in days\". He had the vegetable hash entree and added sausage, I had a side of the vegetable hash. I am not a coffee drinker I have never liked the taste but I did get the coconut cold latte they have on draft and it was very tasty. Jacob got a shot of espresso and their beer-mosa, he said both were delicious. I'm not sure if this will become a regular spot for us because we typically don't go out for a small meals very often but it was very good. 

Also, the guy working behind the counter (I didn't catch his name) was very nice and really knew their product. Everyone that worked there had a friendly attitude which is always nice to see and sometimes hard to find in the service industry."}
{"text":"Came into Roots today for brunch with some friends. I've visited the cafe a couple times for coffee and have always been pretty pleased. Today, however, was a little different. I placed my order at the counter, ordering the special and breakfast tacos. The special, was a Torta Espa√±ola, so, being of Hispanic decent, I ordered it pronouncing the item in Spanish. The gentleman at the counter, who I have seen multiple times before, gave me the most incredulous, condescending attitude as he answered \"so you want the special\" - yes, I ordered the special the way you have it listed on the menu. 

I then asked about the \"Cubano con leche\" that was listed on the HOT coffee menu and found out it was hot coffee poured into COLD milk. When I asked why, the same gentleman at the register said, \"Cubans don't like hot coffee\". Being Cuban myself, I'm not entirely sure where he developed this notion that we don't like hot coffee, because every single version of Cuban coffee is served PIPING HOT. And to continue down the condescending path he was headed, he then asked \"have you ever been to Miami?\" - I chuckled, and answered, \"yes, I was actually born and raised in Miami, both my parents are Cuban and I promise you, we don't drink our coffee cold\".  His response? \"Glad you made it out (of Cuba)\" 

I write all of this to say that today, after having moved to Charlotte just 14 months ago from Miami, was the first time I have encountered such a rude individual in the customer service industry. I doubt we will ever return to Roots. There is no place for such an attitude. The food was not terrible, so I'll leave you with 2 stars, but the service? 1 star at the very best. If you're going to serve Hispanic themed items on your menu, don't serve an attitude to your customers when they order & pronounce those items correctly."}
{"text":"Had the rose (which was $5! What the world?) and the chicken and dumplings which were phenomenal! I've never had chicken and dumplings with so much Rich non-overwhelming flavor before!  Can't wait to go back! My friend got a salad and it smelled so fresh! Great spot! Wonderful environment and fabulous service"}
{"text":"Cute little cafe style spot in Southend that has great light and a cool setting.  I had roasted turkey wrap and a cup of chicken and dumplings.  Turkey wrap was tasty with brown mustard, Gouda cheese and onion.  Chicken and dumplings were ok, smallish dumplings and could have used a bit more seasoning.  I took home a savory scone for hubby who devoured it.  Would recommend this place and will go back again."}
{"text":"Roots Cafe was a quaint little place for a Sunday morning brunch with a friend. They're bustled back in a shopping area but luckily I was able to find parking. The first thing I noticed was the cute outdoor seating area. It was a nice warm day and strongly considered taking a seat out there.  Once I arrived inside it was easy to navigate. There was a small line leading up to the bar and menus laying on the bar. I grabbed one and started searching for what I wanted to eat. I saw the French toast and didn't turn back. We ordered at the bar and were given a number to place on our table so we were able to seat ourselves. There were three tables available at the time so we didn't struggle for seating at all. Our mimosas were brought out within 5-10 minutes which were the perfect brunch sips. Our food was delivered about 10 minutes after that. Like I said I had the French toast and my friend had the breakfast tacos. The French toast had great flavor and was perfectly sweet. The toast itself was a little burnt but I didn't totally mind it. I also wasn't super impressed with the portion sizes, like I definitely could've ate more but maybe that's just my own problem. I had originally left my tab open so I could get another mimosa but without servers or anyone checking on us, it honestly didn't even cross my mind to go back to the bar and order another. We stayed for about an hour and the tables were flipping fast so we didn't feel rushed. Very cute brunch spot and cute atmosphere but I would be interested in trying some other spots next time I'm in the need of a brunch date."}
{"text":"Service was awful. Food wasn't even ok. I wouldn't recommend this place at all. Staff was to busy try to get a hotdog on picture for the Instagram account."}
{"text":"Great brunch place. Mimosas are fresh and tasty. The service was friendly and quick. Loved the inside of the place, bright and sunny and well spaced."}
{"text":"Got a chance to check out this spot while catching up with a business contact for coffee.  The gentleman working this morning was patient in explaining their offerings .  The coffee was smooth and only needed a bit of almond milk - kudos to the cafe for having that as an available option.  

I had the pleasure of enjoying the croissant, it had the right amount of flakiness and was bigger than expected.  The atmosphere was casual and laid back.  I now look forward to trying this place out later in the day."}
{"text":"Hi, I went to Roots cafe for my Friday morning coffee shop review.  I seem to be drawn to southend but it is on the way home. I got drip coffee and it was great. Very smooth.  The menu was much to be desired to be considered a cafe. I got a croissant with butter and jam. Nothing special. With so many great coffee shops around I would skip this one."}
{"text":"I really miss the food truck, but the truck is no more so I occasionally venture over to southend to satisfy my Roots craving.  This location is within a neighborhood so I'm sure they get lots of foot traffic, which I'm sure is good for business.  They offer a limited menu that usually includes a breakfast burrito that sometimes changes pretty often.  The roots hash that they served on the truck is usually offered on the weekend, and is along with the breakfast burrito my favorites.  It doesn't matter which breakfast burrito they offer, it will be delicious, the only issue I had a few times was that when they decide to change it up and show the ingredients on the board they may forget an ingredient or two or give me something I didn't order.  Also, they go back and forth when I ask for egg whites, sometimes it's no problem other times they say it's not an option....fine no problem, just be consistent.  I have tried some of the breakfast specials as well and still no complaints with the food and the zucchini bread is good also, so for me 4 stars for the food less stars for consistency and service which was never an issue on the truck."}
{"text":"Roots has been our go to brunch place for the past 6 or so months. We would be there every Saturday morning sharp. We always loved their freshly prepared food and Brooklynish atmosphere. Unfortunately, the past 4 visits ended up being extremely disappointed. Every single dish tasted not the way it used to. Latkes felt like they were prepared the night before and thrown into microwave prior to serving (super dry), hash tomato sauce is lacking in flavor and potatoes tasted like they were warmed up as well. 

What happened to Roots? Did the kitchen staff change? Chef? Giving 3 stars for all the good experiences we used to have there before and on the hunt for a new brunch place."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, but food left much to be desired. Veggie burger was sweet...like they used a lot of sugar. Their take on Italian wedding soup was interesting. Unfortunately the meat was not drained properly so the soup was greasy. Also over seasoned...too salty."}
{"text":"Today I came in for dinner with a few friends. Our server Aaron was outstanding, he made sure all our needs were taken care of. My pastrami sandwich was amazing, kudos to the kitchen as well for the amazingly prepared items we ordered. I can't wait to come back!!!"}
{"text":"I write this review with a bit of reservation. I am selfishly wanting to not tell anyone how fabulous this place is so that it will not become crazy over crowded. This is a cozy cafe with a lot going on! Who would have known that during my Sunday brunch I would get to do a great wine tasting. The wine for this cafe has been carefully chosen and by just tasting 3 varieties I am hooked. I walked out with a bottle of yummy wine. I enjoyed their root hash for breakfast. It was well prepared and very tasty. Before serving the main dish, I was treated to a tiny quarter size biscuit with marmalade (which can be purchased at the cafe). Again the presentation was spot on!
I can not wait to try their lunch and dinner menu. I will definitely be back for their Thursday wine tastings (which will change to Tuesday's in November).Root Cafe, you got everything right!  Cheers to you!
Foodies, do not pass this cafe by!  It is awesome"}
{"text":"Great little breakfast place.  In town for a conference and found this place after another was closed.  Good food and quick.  Recommend the breakfast burrito!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to get casual meals. Everything has been excellent. Breakfast croissant with bacon, cheese, and avocado fantastic. Also has selection of wine and beer. Outstanding coffee. Staff is wonderful."}
{"text":"I visited Roots Cafe on a Tuesday evening with four other ladies for our monthly book club meeting.  We arrived around 5:30 pm and were one of two tables in the restaurant.  The bartender (owner? manager?) greeted us immediately and got us settled at a table with a large bottle of water to share.  He invited us to come up to the bar to order.  We went up for drinks first (of course!), and he was very helpful with selection and tastes before choosing the wines.  I love that there are several sub-$10/glass options.  

We then re-visited the bar to place our food order.  We ordered 2 bunless veggie burgers, 1 chicken and dumplings, 1 brussels tartine and 1 veggie noodle bowl with chicken.  Overall, the table agreed that the flavors were good but the execution was lacking.  There were a number of things that could be improved:
1.  At the time of ordering, we were the only table in the restaurant.  But, delivery of the food from the first plate to the last plate was about 7-10 minutes apart ...plenty of time for the first plates to get cold if you are waiting for everyone to receive their food, which we were.
2.  The food didn't meet the description of the menu and/or the order placed.  The bunless veggie burgers didn't come with the cruncy sweet potato strips and the veggie noodle bowl was served without the chicken.  The latter was corrected by bringing out a separate saucer of sliced up chicken, but it took minutes - time where the broth and veggies were cooling.   
3.  I know this place doesn't offer table service....but, since they have tables...maybe consider it.  We would have loved more wine, but no one wanted to interrupt the conversation to get up and order more.  No one checked to make sure the food was good or that we didn't need anything else once delivered.  Again, I know this is their model - but, if you are serving hot food to tables, maybe add one more person to serve the tables.

Overall, the flavors were good...but, I think Roots needs a bit more time to mature."}
{"text":"This place is so cute and in a great location. It's a very green menu (meaning I didn't know what half the ingredients were) but that's what made it so cool. The hubs, fellow yelpers, and I went here for a quick lunch and I'm really happy we did. It's a smaller menu, but that's nice so the decision making process isn't overwhelming. They have sandwiches, salads, and sides and veggie options too for you herbivores. On the back, they have a ton of drink options; I think more drink options than food haha

I got the BLAT - bacon, lettuce, avocado and tomato sammich, and dill pickle chips as my side. So. Good. Portions were a good size for the price. There wasn't a lot on the menu for picky palates like the hubs, but if you have an open mind and like lots of different flavors, give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Brunch here was very good!! Different concept where you order at the front and then the food is delivered to the table. However, the menu is very inexpensive and the BEC croissant was great along with a side of grits. Additionally, make reservations as the place isn't huge and on nice weather days I'm sure it'll be full!"}
{"text":"Came one morning and loved the look inside, very earthy and cute.

Ordered the coconut milk draft latte. It was good, but didn't blow my mind like I was hoping. Needs a little more sweetness or flavoring.

Got here right after lunch started. Got the root veggie salad with a side of chicken and dumplings. 

Salad was great. I'm a big fan of beets and butternut squash so this was a great hit. Could do with a little more goat cheese cause I also love that but highly recommended healthy filling noms.

The side of chicken and dumplings was a perfect addition. So hearty and filling and warm. 

Have a few more things that look great so I will probably be back. Last of not least for the booch on tap!!!"}
{"text":"While looking for a new, fresh spot to do a working lunch... We stumbled onto Roots Cafe'. Yes, it's the same Roots as the food truck!  

The menu is farm to table, ridiculously fun mixtures of ingredients. I had the BLAT (bacon, lettuce, tomato and avocado) on fresh brioche with a side of corn salad. It was fantastic! Full of light and fresh flavors. My business partner had the veggie burger with a side of the cucumber salad.... same reaction!

Great vibe and friendly staff! 

Roots is officially on our rotation of local spots to enjoy!"}
{"text":"Roots Cafe offers a fresh, creative take on breakfast/brunch! I ordered a bowl with quinoa and greens topped with and egg. The kombucha on tap is delicious too!"}
{"text":"Roots was great! The menu is farm to table and everything was delicious. I have only gone once, but look forward to going back, as I'm sure they are the type of place that will change the menu. They weren't busy and the decor was adorable. They also have free WiFi so if you need to get some emails out while you enjoy a nice lunch, that's definitely a perk. The barista on staff really knows her stuff too, so if you're a coffee snob this is the place for you too. I really enjoyed my experience here, and look forward to returning soon."}
{"text":"Roots cafe is a quaint little caf√© and southend. One thing I didn't know you order at the counter and they bring you your food. We went yesterday for brunch, it was very busy, lucky enough we got there at the right time. We didn't have to wait for a table but upon leaving people were waiting. I had the egg tacos, they were delicious but didn't really fill me up. Friends got the quinoa bowl, eggs and bacon and chicken and biscuits, they all enjoy their food. We really enjoyed this place, would definitely go back."}
{"text":"I'm giving Roots a high rating than the food I actually ate because I honestly think I ate the wrong thing. 

When I went it was a cold, rainy day and I decided to order the grilled cheese and tomato soup. The soup was really good, thick and creamy. The grilled cheese was a little much - grilled cheese can be too cheesy. 

The soup and sandwich was pretty expensive too. I think my meal was about $16. That seems steep for what it was. 

I definitely want to go back there and try something else. It's super close and the interior is actually really sweet. There's something sweet about it. It get's high ratings for a reason and I want to find out why!"}
{"text":"Got stuck in Charlotte at the Holiday Inn Airport when I missed my connection! This cafe showed up on yelp when I looked for breakfast near the hotel. It was a 15 min drive (only like a $10 Uber) and so worth it!! 

I got the breakfast burrito which was delicious, (especially the aioli). The cafe is small and really cozy. I stayed there for a few hours checking emails on my computer and no one asked me to leave; quite the opposite, they were so friendly and kept refilling my water! 

What a nice introduction to Charlotte. If I lived anywhere near here, I would definitely come back! Would recommend to anyone in the area looking for coffee/mimosas/breakfast!"}
{"text":"Very cool space, nice staff, and a lovely americano on a rainy day.  It's not very clear when you walk in, but you order and pay at the counter first and then pick a seat. It's a small space, not sure if it's tough to get a seat on a weekend, but on a week night it was not busy at all.  I'll be back to try out the food menu, which looks very delicious!"}
{"text":"I needed cofffee and bacon and this place does both great!
I came on a sat afternoon not crazy and service was at the bar but I like that and plenty of table seating. 
The menu is great but I just wanted bacon and eggs and the guy said no problem !!! 
The coffee is in a big mug and fresh and strong.
Wicked inexpensive for farm to table food. I love the 80's music ..... the cars make every meal good"}
{"text":"I went to roots cafe tonight in my sweatpants and unkempt hair. I went to order the bunless black bean sweet potato quinoa burger because I had it the other day and it was amazing and I wanted it again. Fresh, filling, layers of flavor. It's the kind of thing you want to make for dinner at home but you probably won't. This evening I was warmly greeted by Jamie and Casey. They were holding the fort down at Roots. Jamie took my order and chatted with me while Casey whipped it up. The pickled peppers on the entree are my favorite and those guys threw in a little extra for me (I hope I don't get you in trouble guys!). My only complaint this evening was that they didn't have pumpkin cheese cake I was craving or a single glass of red wine to go. But I did get a side of cauliflower au gratin and what do you know but that white veggie covered in cheese satisfied both of those cravings in one fell swoop. Thanks, Roots! I'll see y'all soon. Maybe tomorrow."}
{"text":"So, here is Southend hip and cool and funky and creative!   The vibe in this space is worth the trip,  not to even mention the food.   When you walk in the door, you are struck by the originality and character!  I met a friend for lunch.  The restaurant was quiet enough to have a great conversation.  Chicken and dumplings is what I ordered.  The menu had some great bowl options.  Being from the south, the chicken and dumplings weren't exactly what I had expected. It was more like a thick chicken noodle soup, but still very tasty.  My friend had a turkey wrap and a small bowl of the soup.  Very enjoyable, and not too much to feel bloated.  One of my pet peeves is when a restaurant does not have sweet and low for unsweetened tea.  This restaurant was out of all artificial sweeteners, which was a small disappointment.  Had it not been for that, this would have been a five star review.  Regardless, this is a Southend treasure and I hope they are here to stay for the long haul.  Charlotte needs more funk like this and fewer big chains, IMO."}
{"text":"Well this was a pleasant delight on my Saturday morning food adventure this week! Roots just opened this week, so my coworker and I decided we wanted to try it out since it was in our neck of the woods!

They have a very limited menu, food wise, but I guess that's not a bad thing. They know what they're good at making and you don't have to waste time pondering over an extremely ridiculously large menu. My coworker went with the burrito. She said besides the plate being a little too compact (as it looked like the burrito was about to explode from the plate) it was good! Good flavor. The potatoes looked like they could have been cut up a bit more, but she didn't seem to have complaints. I went with the tortilla. I don't know that I've ever had a tortilla or knew exactly what it was, but I wasn't upset when it arrived! It was delicious, all of my favorite ingredients! It could've had a little more flavor, onion and peppers, but overall it was good and I would order it again (and recommend it). I also got a side of bacon... GET THE BACON!!! Perfectly crisp and delicious! The food was great and I was impressed for them being spot on, on opening weekend! Well done Roots.

Lots of drink options - cooler of cold beverages, coffee, lattes, hot tea, mimosas and more!

This is a cute little cafe that has a nice, cozy and intimate atmosphere. Like a said it's a small cafe so the seating is limited, but a nice mixture to choose from: regular tables, high top and a little bar (4 seats or so).  

I'm not sure the pricing on their limited breakfast menu will keep this place afloat (it's a bit pricey), but I have a feeling their $5wine/$16bottle selections during the evening hours will keep the happy hour crowd pleased and coming back time and time again! Can't wait to come back and check out the evening/wine scene!"}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped by for breakfast last Sunday morning.

I had a biscuit with a fried egg, bacon and cheese and a side of the roots hash and a cup of coffee.  The biscuit was pretty good... probably the star of the experience for us.  The hash was a combination of roasted root vegetables and was pretty tasty, but could have used a bit of salt (and we couldn't find salt available in the dining room).  $9 for a biscuit, however tasty, is pretty steep, though.  Maybe if the hash had been included, it would have been a fair price, but they hit you another $3 for the hash.  The coffee was well roasted, brewed and of a good quality, but I'd bet it was a Mexican single-origin... it was pretty one-note.  

My wife had the lemon cream pizelles with a side of crispy bacon (we specifically asked for it crispy and the guy taking the order spent some time typing in notes (I assume), so the request made it back to the kitchen).  She liked the pizelles, but the bacon came out limp, so we sent it back... and it came out limp a second time.  Granted, they use a very European style of bacon  that is hard to get crispy... it's a lot more like ham than American bacon, but since they used the term 'crispy bacon' several places in the menu, I expected 'em to get it right the second time, at the least.  Again, the dish was overpriced for not having a side item included.

You can tell that they are putting a lot of energy into high-quality ingredients.  We also appreciated the euro-style water service, using old Champagne bottles and a chilled filler-tap.

It was OK, but we probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Only get the coffee here. The food isn't good and isn't worth the price. Pretty disappointed. The atmosphere is great, but they should have stuck to just a coffee shop."}
{"text":"Recently had lunch here with my son. He ordered the chicken sandwich and chips, while I had the turkey wrap with a side of chicken and dumplings. My son was very happy with his sandwich and after taking a bite (or two) I have to agree. It was delicious! My turkey wrap was ok. The dumplings were meh. Coming from a southern family, I know what really good chicken n dumplings should taste like.  If we return, we will be ordering more chicken sandwiches!"}
{"text":"The breakfast burrito is the best! I could eat it every day. Also just tried the iced vanilla latte and it was SO good. Love this place. Our fave breakfast/brunch place."}
{"text":"We needed a quick bite to eat before heading back to Maryland. It was very nice that we could sit down and enjoy a fabulous breakfast! The service was friendly and the kitchen was quick. Very cute decor with a small, quaint atmosphere. The food was delicious. I had the breakfast burrito that was loaded with sweet potatoes, Kale, egg and spices. It was pretty large so I saved half!  My latte was perfect. The hubs had the fried egg on a biscuit with ham. He also got a scone to go. It's waiting for us to dive in when we need a snack (hopefully not in traffic). Happy Thanksgiving weekend . We will be back here for sure!"}
{"text":"I had really high hopes for this place knowing how much everyone likes the Roots Food Truck, but I think it kinda falls flat for me. Here's why:

I've been here a few times for lunch to eat in. Sandwiches I ordered were good, but nothing noteworthy enough to remember a few months later. Another time my fiance brought me soup from there when I was sick. I remember it being a little bland, but I was sick, so I could hardly judge.

Looking for a quick, healthy dinner last night around 7:45pm, we stopped in for take-out. We ordered at the counter, paid (around $20 for a sandwich with side and a hot veggie noodle bowl), and waited a about 10-15 minutes. When we got home and dug in, both of us were disappointed with the lack of flavor. My fiance didn't say much about his sandwich, but his side of roasted veggies were herbed nicely, but needed salt. My veggie noodle dish was in a curry sauce that was super watery and also had no flavor. I kept shaking salt on it and it was never enough. 

For the price, I can't really say this place is worth it. The concept is great, the space is nice, and the food could be good, but this place isn't doing it for me."}
{"text":"I went to this cafe for brunch and it was delicious!  I liked the concept of the limited brunch menu.  I chose the pizzelle and it was a light dish with fresh fruit.  The atmosphere is cozy and the staff is friendly.  I will definitely go back to try their normal lunch menu!"}
{"text":"After the gym, my friends and I decided to try out Roots Cafe. It's a new-ish spot located in Southend, and I highly recommend it. The staff were extremely friendly, the coffee was amazing, the food looked so good (I'll be ordering next time), and the place was so cute inside!  I ordered a small skim cappuccino with an extra shot of espresso. This was the first place where I didn't need to order the extra shot. Their espresso was rich and carried itself with a strong and bold flavor. Coffee on point!"}
{"text":"Outstanding flavors in this new all time favorite comfort food choice, for me!  Locally sourced items and prepared with love and great attention to flavorful details!  Highly recommend dining here.  Also a great choice for catering.  Visit their website and check out the well curated selection of items."}
{"text":"here now, arrived at 10:50 am, an although advertised as a breakfast/brunch place...
guess what? no breakfast/ brunch availabe!"}
{"text":"I simply adore Roots Cafe! This is probably the most charming gem in South End. 

This was my second time visiting Roots Cafe. Here's a tip, if it's Sunday, make reservations ahead of time. This place gets packed around 11 AM - 12 PM. My first visit was on a Friday afternoon, fewer people. Either way, the staff here is VERY accommodating and nice.

Honestly, I come here for the $4 Mimosas which are available daily! So awesome! There's a complimentary wine tasting on Thursdays from 6-8PM, I look forward to many girls nights here!"}
{"text":"Their food is great , their service is sometimes great and others just ok . I always get their chocolate chip cookies they are amazingHowever today i had the worst experience. After walking to there during my 30 minute lunch break i walk back to work ate my food and just as im about to take a bite of my cookie it was like a brick . I had a hard time breaking it in half and when I dropped the one half in the bag it sounded like i just threw a rock in it instead. I wish i could post a video for everyone to see and hear it . I did post it on instagram and tagged them ."}
{"text":"Went here for the 1st time yesterday. Great breakfast food, unreal iced coconut latte, on tap!

Great atmosphere tucked away right behind south blvd. 110% worth checking out."}
{"text":"Great lunch spot. Not very busy when we went but great ambiance and music. Rarely do I find a restaurant whose music I actually listen to at home, (mostly Indie R&B when I was there). The bartender/server was friendly. The ordering situation was not what I expected. You order and pay at the counter, then they bring the food to the table, which is fine. However, we ended up ordering more mimosa's, and they brought another bill. I would rather have paid at the end of the meal, but no big deal. The staff was attentive and service was solid. This place is in a bit of a hidden location but certainly worth the experience."}
{"text":"I used to have breakfast from their food truck at Atherton Mill so I was BEYOND excited when I found out they were opening a restaurant. The menu, location, people...it's everything I hoped it would be!  The vibe is so easy going and chill. The menu isn't fussy or busy, it's just good ol feel good food!"}
{"text":"This was our first visit to Charlotte to visit our daughter in her new place.  She was excited to take us to breakfast at this cute trendy spot, but our  trip to Roots was anything but positive.  

It's a tiny place with just a few tables so, upon entering we were trying to decide if we should stay or go, as there were no open tables.  This must have annoyed the gentleman at the counter, so we went ahead and ordered.  We asked a couple of questions about the menu, and that obviously annoyed him, as well.  He was incredibly pushy, rude and condescending -  and definitely killed the mood of our fun breakfast out.  I felt sorry for my daughter, who was embarrassed by what was happening, so we tried to make the best of it.  However, I can't give a positive due to the extremely poor service.

Bottom line, I spent $14 on two tiny breakfast tacos and a basic drip-brewed coffee in addition to receiving horrible service.  Roots needs to coach their employees to offer a warmer, more welcoming atmosphere to their customers as there are way too many other better restaurant options nearby.  Needless to say,  we'll all be finding a friendlier place to enjoy breakfast next time."}
{"text":"This is a cute neighborhood cafe, I got the steak and eggs and it wasn't what I excepted at all. I was looking at the picture of the food on yelp before I went it had a nice medium sized steak next to two over east eggs but when I ordered it, I guess they changed it, there were just tiny little strips of steak with a super sweet but bitter glac√© all over it with my two eggs. Wasn't super pleased about it but it was still eatable."}
{"text":"Love this place for a healthier brunch or lunch!  Order at the counter and they are pretty quick to bring out your food, making it a great spot for a weekday lunch!  They have kombucha on tap and an excellent coffee menu. 

I love their sandwiches, breakfast burrito, grain bowl and breakfast biscuit!  Tucked away just off of South Blvd, makes this a great go-to in South End!  Greta addition to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"When I first heard of Roots Cafe I was a little confused as to why Alex Haley had decided to open a restaurant. Once I got inside and didn't see Lavar Burton I realized I was mistaken. They also don't have Quest Love of Black Thought inside the venue. 

I came in here for a bit of breakfast on Saturday. They weren't very crowded and had a very laid back atmosphere. The menu for breakfast was pretty simple but very filling. They also had a lot of coffee options. If you're looking for a nice place to grab a light bite to eat and a latte this is the spot for you.

I also asked for a side of toast and it was so big it might as well have been a loaf of bread! LOL I wasn't able to finish it but good to know you get your money's worth. The same way you'll get your money's worth if you go see Thor: Ragnarok. It's an excellent movie that really breaks the mold. 

In a time where it feels like so many things in America threaten to pull us apart Roots Cafe is tying to bring us back together."}
{"text":"Sooooooooo yummy! I got the breakfast burrito with sausage, it was soooo hearty and filling and I knew I was filling my tummy with great ingredients!!! My boyfriend got the chicken and biscuits and licked the plate clean. Service was short and sweet but in a good way and they had a wonderful selection of beers, which I loved! I drank the pumpkin pie porter. Yummy. Will definitely be back and 10/10 recommend. Thanks Roots!!!"}
{"text":"First and las time here. 
We found an ENTIRE PIECE OF A GLOVE in the Hash, we all know they cook all the vegetables together, but we only got a refound for the plate with the problem, so the rest at the table had to eat the exact same, which means WE DIDN'T EAT AT ALL.
Service was also terrible, we had to get a chair ourselves cause they didn't let us take one from another empty table. 
So disappointed, upset and STILLL HUNGRY!"}
{"text":"Went to Roots for the first time and had lunch with a friend. We both had the salad with lemon, pickled red onions and avocado and added salmon. It was delicious, and the service was fast and friendly. We sat outside and enjoyed the beautiful day, so I can't say much about the inside. Oh, and don't be intimidated by the parking...there's a small deck, too, so you should be OK (unlike other Southend eateries)."}
{"text":"Cute cafe in Southend. The Latkes were good but a little tough, still very good. Warm croissant was delicious. The employees were friendly and the seating is nice. Really nice decor and it has a hip vibe to it. There's only one bathroom so go easy on the coffee."}
{"text":"Wow! Excellent choice for our brunch today!! My root veggie hash with added local sausage was delicious! Veggies were cooked to perfection- not overcooked. There was a slight sweet taste which just made the dish over the top amazing!! My hubby got the bread pudding french toast. He ate every bite but said next time we could get one to share since it is so sweet. Loved the 1 ingredient orange juice. Wonderful to know the food is local- you could definitely taste the difference. Aaron took our order- he was terrific:)"}
{"text":"What a super little place and now the kitchen is open all day Monday through Friday. They have redone the patio right in time for summer. Inside hasn't changed too much; there is still a 7-seat bar and then several 4 or 5-top tables. Weekends are brunch only, but until 3pm. Roots maybe my new brunch go to.

The lunch menu is mostly split between sandwiches and salads plus side items. Everything sounds great. I had the capresse salad; it was beautifully presented and tasty. Heirloom tomatoes make the difference. I guess the rest of the menu is equally good. The evening fare is small bites and I intend to try them all.

Coffee looks like a big seller - for the breakfast menu plus you can buy a monthly coffee subscription. They have a good wine selection plus 6 beers on tap.

The little things like getting a pitcher of water when you sit down is nice and makes the difference. The staff are super friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"A really good breakfast burrito here and a strong cup of coffee, while I was waiting for my car to get serviced around the corner. It's a neat little spot with several tables and a bar that looks a bit more \"wine\" than \"breakfast\" but that's okay.

Breakfast burrito had some delicious cubed sweet potatoes in there and that was super delicious. Eggs and cheese and more. Yum!

When I'm looking for a small spot to meet for a glass of wine, I'll be back to Roots."}
{"text":"My first visit... I liked it and will be back. 

I had the Pastrami Reuben, with a side salad.  The  pastrami was excellent, a mix of thick cuts and thin sliced, it had a great smoked bark, very tender, and tasted great. The bread was supposed to be a local rye, but what I received was wheat. It worked though!  The sauerkraut was delicious. The salad was a nice mix of greens and vegetables in a very light dressing."}
{"text":"Finding superb, unique restaurants is one of the reasons I love Yelp, and this is a great example.  We wanted something light for dinner, and the menu at Roots was perfect.  Finding it in the gentrified area of Charlotte could have been a challenge, but Google Maps took us right there.  Anyway, the food was fresh and locally sourced, and the employees very pleasant.  Too bad there weren't more customers."}
{"text":"Went for brunch on a Saturday, had the burrito which was really good since I am pescatarian. it fits into my diet, taste it really fresh the only thing is they get a little crowded for brunch and not a big place. So it got a little crowded with everybody trying to wait for a table or standing in line but other than that food was great the staff was really nice."}
{"text":"Came here for a wine tasting tonight. It's a beautiful space with great service. Monique and Aaron were very friendly at the bar. Food is fresh and delicious. Great location for a first date or a chill night with a group of friends. Would highly recommend to anyone in the area."}
{"text":"Visited here for breakfast!  Ordered the egg, cheese and bacon sandwich served on an everything roll.  If you like smoked bacon, you will love this sandwich!  The only thing I would ask for different the next time is to toast the roll.  Heavy smoked aroma and flavor.  Atmosphere is small and inviting.  Order at the counter and they bring it to you.  Worth a visit!  I will come back for lunch and dinner!"}
{"text":"The Cafe that is much more than a cafe.

Food: the food is phenomenal. Everything is farm to table and healtht but delicious at the same time. Not one of those places thag sacrifices taste for healthiness.

Vibe: The vibe is really chill. This place would fit in perfectly in Noda. Tons of plants everywhere. Great spot for dinner lunch or just grabbing a drink after work. An instant classic in Charlotte's new restaurant scene."}
{"text":"After stalking Roots Cafe Instagram page for a few weeks, i told myself i was going here one morning for breakfast and so i did. I have to say i was somewhat disappointed.My friends pretty much depend on me to find good places to eat different etc, so i suggested we try this place out. To my surprise they had a very limited menu. My friend didn't like her meal at all. My meal which was just a plain Jane bacon,egg,and cheese croissant i felt like it was just something i simply could have made at home. When you order your food you have to order when you first arrive and they give you a number and bring out to your table. No one ever came back and checked in on us asked if we were enjoying our food or anything. Unless they broaden their menu a little more i don't really see myself coming back here at all. The staff wasn't the friendliest either."}
