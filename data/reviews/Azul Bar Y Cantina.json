{"text":"Without question, the best, and most authentic, Mexican restaurant in town. We're not talking Mexico City Mexican, we're talking Baja California Mexican.

The menu is quite simple and the food is awesome. The margaritas are small, potent, and pricey - but worth it.

My favorite dishes include: the shrimp cocktail appetizer with chips (good for sharing), and the mahi-mahi fish tacos. The burritos are huge and also recommended - try the surf n turf, wet (red sauce). It is enough for 2 to share (especially if you have starters).

No reservations are accepted, so if you go on a Fri or Sat night, be prepared to have a few cocktails at the bar.

Also, if you are a fan of chains like Mad Mex or Don Pablos, I wouldn't recommend trying Azul. You will come out of this place saying the prices are too high and the portions are too small. 

If you prefer quality over quantity, Azul cannot be beat (unless you fly to LA or head south of the border)."}
{"text":"Really good experience. Chips were really good. Large draft was only $6. Mahi mahi tacos were good. Only issue was there black beans side."}
{"text":"Love It!  Best restaurant in Sewickley area.  Guacamole and soups are favorites.  Margaritas can't be beat."}
{"text":"Terrible slow service, cold food and small drinks for a high price.  Only positive was the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch while on the road traveling for work. At first glance the place is small but has a nice atmosphere, good drinks but the food left a lot to be desired. I ordered the plate of tinga tacos and the meat was very dry chewy and had little to no flavor. After reading reviews about the chips and salsa I tried these too and again was disappointed with the bland taste of the salsa. On the upside they do have a fully stocked bar and some of the drinks I saw the bartender making looked pretty good. Over all I give it a 2 stars as it has potential to be a good restaurant but from what I witnessed and tasted they had a lot of room for improvement."}
{"text":"Margaritas - 5 star, the best house margarita I've ever had. $7

Chips and salsa - my mouth is watering right now for the dark smoky almost paste-like salsa. I wish I knew how they got this flavor - much roasting? Paprika? The chips were clearly fresh and housemade but somehow thicker than usual chips. Unusual and delicious. $3?

Enchiladas - very good, a bit heavy on the cheese/sour cream/grease but with good taste. Not hot spicy but very flavorful. Served with a small side of black beans. Veggie (onion, pepper) - $10.

Service - meh. Server couldn't keep the simple drink orders straight. I got black beans instead of pinto. Didn't bring check for over an hour without checking whether we needed anything else. Didn't split check or ask for clearly a party of separates.

Atmosphere - nice typical Mexican though well done. Very loud. Hot (though to be fair it was over 95 outside) and stuffy.

Website says open til 9 on weeknights and at least a couple tables came in and ordered after 8:30, eating at 9. Private room upstairs may be available for large parties? Small so I'd guess there would be a wait (no reservations for parties under 6) on weekends. Note that while this place is 2-3 miles north of Sewickley it is on a residential street a block off Route 65 from the Leetsdale Industrial Park sign on the Ohio River.

Other fillings sounded unusual (to be tried next time because there will be many next times): a pulled chicken with chipotle and a pork with pineapple. The fillings are listed as options at the bottom of the menu but not described anywhere that I saw so ask your server. May be upgraded to 5 stars after trying more entrees."}
{"text":"Go there all the time.

I never had aproblem with the service, in spite of what I raed from other reviews. Food and drink always really good. Always seem to see friends whenever we are there. Home made guacamole is the utmost.

Recommended."}
{"text":"Met friends here on a recent Friday night.  I was running late (per usual!) and our dining companions had a table by the time we got there, so I can't speak to any wait time.  The service was great - waitress was attentive and got all of the orders right.  One of my friends is VERY picky and her food was correct the first time, which was impressive.

The guacamole is mixed fresh table-side and was phenomenal.  Between that and the homemade chips, I was full by the time our entrees arrived.  Three of us got enchiladas, and the fourth had fajitas.  All four meals were perfect and delicious and very good reheated the next day.  Recommended it to everyone I talked to the rest of the weekend!"}
{"text":"This is the first time in a while that I have been terribly disappointed with an overall experience. The restaurant looked nice, but was so hot and full of flies. We were seated right away, but there were only 2 high chairs so we had to wait for another family to leave before one became available. Drinks took 15-20 mins to reach the table (and I'm just talking water) and there were no complimentary chips. We were confused as to while service was so slow because there was ample staff and the place wasn't full. They were out of one of the main dishes that my husband wanted. When we received our food 45 mins after sitting down, it was a mixed bag. The portion sizes were small for a Mexican place and the rice tasted like cigarettes. The carne asada tacos were good, but a bit spicy, but the pork dish that my husband got was flavorless. Overall, ok food, but incredibly poor, slow service. We are very unlikely to return."}
{"text":"I used to like this place a few years ago when there were Mexicans running the place, but since there are new people, it's gone way down hill.  It's no longer the place you would go for good food and and good people.

The food:  First let me say that while I'm certainly not an expert on Mexican food, I lived near the border for many years. I think I have been exposed to a lot of good Mexican food.

Some  comments about some of the things that I have ordered: The Margaritas are good. That's where it ends.   The salsa is BLAND!  It needs an element of freshness and salt. The tortilla chips come out brown and dry as though they are cooked in old oil.  The chicken tacos that I ordered the last time I was there needed salt and flavor in general!  The same is true for the fish tacos. The pork has a strange after taste. One of the reviewers said cinnamon and that is a decent description.The rice looks and tastes like mush. Again, no flavor. It used to be much better. The Mexican chicken soup is oily and lacks flavor ( big surprise). How can Mexican food be under salted?! It's perplexing.  

The people/the place:  It's decorated nicely but that's where the warm fuzzy feeling stops. When we walk in there, they are always \"too busy\" to even acknowledge us.  I never feel the owner ( or at least I think she is )  is warm and friendly. It's a real turn-off. 

Once we are seated, and after the ships and salsa arrive, we always have to ask for silverware. Is it too much to pre-set the tables so we can at least have napkins?
I have the feeling they are trying to cut corners. It's not like it's a cheap place. Very sad because I really want to like this place because of the convenience. It's just not worth it!"}
{"text":"Probably one of the most disappointing places I've ever eaten and I went twice to give it a fair try.. Waitress was nothing short of nasty and we were her only customers,  the charge for oily chips is excessive,  food was mediocre... Parking very limited,  emailed the owner about the issue with the rude,  unhygienic,  nasty waitress.. Never even acknowledged.... Find another place to eat... Lovely interior,  absolute shame"}
{"text":"Came here hoping for some good Mexican food and was very disappointed. I got the chicken quesadilla and the chicken was burnt. I ordered a side of rice it was $2 and got about 2 bites. It was way over priced. Flavor was very blan."}
{"text":"We went to Azul last night. I was really excited to try this place, but left feeling very disappointed. We sat for 10 minutes watching the wait staff sit at the end of the bar playing on their cell phones before someone came to our table to greet us. The waitress we (eventually) had was very nice but really didn't seem to know anything about the menu. The margaritas were good - not the best I've had, but decent - and the chips were tasty. The salsa tasted like toothpaste. When our dinners came out, the black beans were undercooked and the rice was cold. However, the meat was very good, seasoned perfectly and nice and tender. Overall though, I will not go back. The woman running the bar (who I am assuming was a manager or owner) seemed more concerned with sitting around with regulars drinking tequila than with what her wait and cook staff were doing. For the price, save your money - there are definitely other Mexican restaurants in PGH that are better, cheaper and more welcoming."}
{"text":"Lots of good reviews led me to Azul, but my first try here was less than memorable.  Expensive, small portions, marginal food and nowhere close to \"authentic Mexican\" as other reviews claim. Maybe it was just a bad night???"}
{"text":"The food is pretty good, and the service was fine.  But for me problem is the prices.  The food is kind of expensive, but the drink prices are OUTRAGEOUS.  I work in downtown Pittsburgh, so I don't mind paying for drinks - but $11 for a teeny-tiny Tito's rocks is just unreasonable   This is Leetsdale- not midtown Manhattan."}
{"text":"Food was very bland.  I had the steak fajitas - the steak was pretty rare (they didn't ask how I wanted the steak cooked) and didn't have any flavor.   My wife ordered the queso dip which also was very bland - and rather expensive - $10.   I won't be rushing back there"}
{"text":"Sat for a half hour while my waitress waited on people behind and in front of me. Walked past me enough times for me to realise she wasn't going to bother with me. 
I like the food here a lot, and it's a shame that my first review is regarding an incompetent waitress. It shouldn't be my responsibility to hound the waitstaff for service; if she couldn't be bothered with me, I wasn't going to be bothered with eating there. 
Total bummer."}
{"text":"Not bad. Never feel good after eating the salsa though. Over priced in my opinion. Staff is friendly though. I can say it is not consistent. There have been times I would give it 3 stars."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in Pittaburgh -shrimp tacos are amazing. great guacamole, chips and salsa. Neighborhood gem!"}
{"text":"I have recently moved here from California where I had all the great Mexican or Mexican inspired food I could eat, so I wasn't sure how this would really compare. I was pleasantly surprised. The chips and salsa were excellent! I had shrimp tacos - the shrimp was perfectly seasoned and cooked with a great mix of flavorful toppings. My mom is still raving about the Azul salad with chicken. We ordered the fried ice cream for dessert which was delicious and HUGE. I would definitely recommend this spot!"}
{"text":"I was spending the night in Ambridge, naturally I was looking for a local place to eat. My host suggested Azul and I was rather pleased. The service was a bit chaotic, but the food and drinks delicious for an acceptable price.

The place is rustic/modern, a bit loud and not really suitable for a romantic meal. If you are looking for good Mexican fare at a fair price, Azul is a great option!"}
{"text":"Great margaritas! Had the fish taco special with three different types of fish. Flavor was amazing. Hate that you have to pay for chips and salsa but the chips are delicious. A hidden gem for sure."}
{"text":"Wow, what a decline in food quality! Service pretty bad also, food delivered no one ever checked back...not that busy to never come around. Only reason for two stars is margaritas were good...but expensive. Not what it used to be, should have put the clues together, 6:15 Friday and empty tables. Go to Biba in Beaver 10 times better."}
{"text":"I've been to Azul 3 or 4 times and always thought it was soooooo good. Last night was no different as far the food goes, our experience with the waitstaff, not so much. We got there at about 5:30 and the hostess had us sit at the bar while she cleaned off a table for us. She then motioned us to sit at the table she had just cleaned and it was completely wet, as was my fiancé's chair which he realized after he sat down because his butt got really wet. It was kinda gross, and there were broken chip crumbs all over the floor. And our waiter wasn't very attentive at all but looking around made me think he was seriously overworked and frustrated so he still got an awesome tip. The food at Azul - amazing. Has been every time I've gone there. I could go there and just fill up on their homemade chips and salsa.  I certainly won't let one not so great experience keep me from going back."}
{"text":"I would have not found Azul had it not been for a kind co-worker tipping me off to this place!  Our family has been here two weekends in a row.  This last visit was even better than the first - and our first visit was pretty great!

First, when your server asks you if you want chips and salsa, make sure you say YES!  OK, it's $4 for chips and salsa.  But, it's totally worth it.  However, I would not recommend the spicy salsa.  That's an additional $2 - but it wasn't that spicy or flavorful.  This is probably my only major criticism of this place.

My first visit, I went with the carne asada tacos on flour tortillas.  Amazing.  This last visit, I went with the pork belly tacos on flour tortillas.  Double amazing.  The pork belly was crispy, so tasty and just the right amount of food.

The kids menu is pretty simple - just a handful of options, the price was right $5 or $6 with a drink included.

The ambience is very much a neighborhood cantina, a little on the louder side on Saturday night, service is great ... it's worth a visit!"}
{"text":"I don't typically write reviews but everything about the food tonight was terrible. We started with chips and salsa. The house made chips were dripping with grease and the salsa lacked flavor of any kind. I am fine with paying for chips and salsa, but I expect them to be above the complimentary chips you would get in other Mexican places, these did not come close to that expectation. For dinner, my wife got chicken fajitas. The chicken came uncut, just 4 pieces of chicken. She said there wasn't much flavor at all and had to ask the waitress for some salt. I got the chile relleno and it was the most disgusting thing I have ever eaten in my entire life. The only thing that it tasted like was grease and that was because it was soaked in it. It was pretty obvious that their fryer was nowhere near the temperature that it needed to be to cook the relleno and that just shows that the chefs took no pride in the food they served. It had been a while since my wife and I had been here and we wondered why that was. We now understand why it had been so long and why it will be a much, much longer time until we go back."}
{"text":"Just wanted to try a new place to eat as I was visiting PA with a friend. The atmosphere was very relaxing and laid back. The bathrooms were very clean. The chips and queso, especially the white cheese, were amazing. The chips alone have a very sweet/salty taste. We had a nice waiter, Ben who seemed to really know the menu and what they had to offer. Honestly the only con I can give is the curbside appeal. The restaurant sits in between houses and just not normally what you would picture as a restaurant. With that said, once you walk through the door, everything changes! Overall just a very laid back and enjoyable place to eat!"}
{"text":"Just had to leave Azul on Cinco De Mayo, because they were not prepared to handle large volume. No wait list system in place. No greeter or hostess. Holding tables for ghost parties who \"haven't arrived\" (while patrons are flooding in the door). Odd. I expected better. Rain or shine. This is essentially your Super Bowl."}
{"text":"Food was great, service was the worst I've experienced in a very long time.

The only thing keeping me from giving this one star is the food, which was very good yet completely overshadowed by the horrible service.  We arrived at 9PM and by 9:30PM, only 5 tables were filled yet service took over an hour and a half.  Our waitress spent more time talking with other staff than actually being a waitress.  We did not get utensils until we were 10 minutes into our appetizer, she never gave us water until my boyfriend had to ask for some halfway into our meal, we bought $10 guacamole and she never refilled our chips (she kept looking over at us, though), and the table that was seated a few minutes before us had their takeout containers ready to go before our entrees even got to our table.  The only time she was quick was to give us the bill and our tip was commensurate with the service received."}
{"text":"Decor nice, service ok, food ehhh. One of the nicer place to eat in the area but then again there's not too many places to eat in the leetdales  area"}
{"text":"It was a great atmosphere and ambiance along with great food.  The service was good and quick. A nice choice for Sewickley.  I"}
{"text":"No Bueno !!!  Service very very slow and the food was mediocre. Not worth the price. However the margarita and table side guacamole were quite delish, but not enough to make me go back"}
{"text":"I met a friend here for lunch today to give it another shot.  My first experience was a few years ago and the only thing I remember is that the rice had a weird fishy taste to it.  I thought I would give it another chance to change my mind about this restaurant.  Being of Mexican descent, I think I have a good grasp of what Mexican food should taste like.  
Once again I was very disappointed.  First, the rice was cold, dry and tasteless.  
The meat (carnitas) on the sopes was very blah. 
The beans were luke warm.  
My friend only had a few bites of her meal because her's was also bland and tasteless.  She agreed with me about the rice.  
When I told the waiter about our experience and how we were unhappy with the food.  He only said oh sorry to hear that, or something like that and was not very concerned about it.  No manager came over to discuss our bad experience with our meal.  
Needless to say, I will not be going back to give it  3rd chance."}
{"text":"Azul has all the atmosphere of a trendy S.F. restaurant right here in Western PA.  The small stature from the street does belie the nice open feel of the interior.  

As for the food, it is superb.  I immensely enjoyed the chicken burrito I had. I thought the bean salsa was good, but could use a bit more kick, as I like things spicy.

It's definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"Back again. Even better. Blue margaritas. Guacamole. Queso. Enchiladas with Tinga and Machaca (chicken and beef). Flan. Everything wonderful."}
{"text":"The atmosphere can be fun, don't get me wrong. The wood tables, the mosaics et cetera. 

But...the food and service...that left something to be desired. 

Firstly, you pay for your tortilla chips. That is somewhat unusual in a Mexican restaurant in my experience. Sometimes, they don't even ask if you want chips, they just place it on your table and then charge you later. It's not hugely expensive, but it is good to know. 

The drinks--they were good. I mean how can you screw up a margarita? It was fairly small for the price as well. They didn't have anything terrifically interesting when I looked at the drink menu either. 

The food--I've been here several times and I've gotten the tacos, carnitas, and the fajitas. The tacos were good, the shells were clearly very fresh...but the contents were less than stellar. The carnitas were interesting...not a ton of flavor, but the texture was good, and the fajitas were your run of the mill fajitas with an upscale price. The sides as a whole were fairly bland, and the rice itself seemed like a flavorless placeholder.

Nothing seemed to be worth the price at all."}
{"text":"The food was really good, but it was a little expensive. The chips and hard shells are clearly made in-house, which was delicious, and the margarita was small but strong. But $4 for chips and salsa and $8 for a single margarita is just a little pricier than we expected."}
{"text":"We've frequented this restaurant for years as the service and food was always great, however, our most recent trip will be our last. Our party arrived at the restaurant well before the normal Saturday dinner rush and spent a significant amount of money on appetizers, food and drinks and had another round of drinks after dinner to finish the conversation. Before even finishing our drinks and after already spending $140+ we were asked to leave as there was a long wait for tables. Our group had only been at the table for a little over an hour and just had spent an additional 10+ dollars a drink that obviously was wasted. Immediately after the manager made the rude comment, he ran away as if this was normal to treat guests his way. If this is the level of service provided by management and deemed appropriate, we will never spend another dime at this restaurant. If you want to be treated fairly, don't come to this establishment."}
{"text":"SO delicious! I had vegetable enchiladas and they were absolutely amazing. We also had chips and salsa which were super fresh and awesome. Service was fine, I ate way too much and would be happy to go back anytime!"}
{"text":"I had dinner at Azul last night.  The service was pretty good, not great.  The food was delicious, but not really Mexican food by any stretch.  Similar, but not very authentic.  The prices weren't bad except for the $7 shot of regular whiskey my girlfriend wanted to mix with tea and honey for her cold.

It's not bad, but not good enough to make me anxious to come back."}
{"text":"Azul has been my family's go to for great Mexican cuisine for years. You can never go wrong with the enchiladas or the tacos. The portions are very big, so lately we just order the table side quac and split a chicken quesadilla, and we still end up with leftovers. It can get kinda busy on the weekends, but on week nights it's usually a little quieter. The waitstaff is always friendly and attentive. Though it may be just off the beaten path, it is certainly worth the trek and has become a fan favorite here in Sewickley."}
{"text":"First let me say that the food we were served was ultimately  very good, I just thought that we were an afterthought
The table side guacamole had good flavor but it would have been nice if the pieces of avocado were broken down to less than silver dollar size
We have noted a trend recently where waiters try to memorize all the food orders and always get something wrong .  That was the case here; red and green sauce are not the same
Again the food was good; the experience would have been better if the wait staff took the time"}
{"text":"To the person who compared this place to trendy San Francisco restaurant has obviously never been to SF! I'm a Sewickley native and currently live in San Francisco, and have to say that this place is nowhere near as good as a place in the mission. I agree, that for being a mexican restaurant in the Sewickley area it does offer something besides pizza, italian, or bad chinese food. The menu is very simple and the food is so-so, I found that many of the dishes were just not 'fresh' enough for my liking. I could personally taste the pesticides on the veggies and antibiotics in the beef. However, the place has a great atmosphere, and Angus and Donna are amazing people. My only grip was over the quality of freshness, this place would be awesome if they stuck to organic products and expanded there menu to more then just 'baja california mexican'."}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican, guacamole made at table.  Great dinner"}
{"text":"Randomly place in a residential area amongst houses. You would never know its there unless informed.  Salsa is good. Best classic margarita I've ever had. But outrageously over priced. It's $12 for a smaller sized glass."}
{"text":"I don't understand the one star reviews!  I thought the food was flavorful without being overly loaded down with chili powder and too spicy.  I've been to Monterrey, Mexico and the salsa there is like Azuls....not overpowered with cilantro.  Nice size portions and great margaritas and I liked the atmosphere.  Our waiter was attentive, friendly and professional.  Prices were not cheap like Taco Bell but the quality of the food was well worth it.  I never thought I'd see a great restaurant in Leetadale.  It's worth the drive!"}
{"text":"Azul is a nice place for a Texmex meal ... I had the mahi-mahi tacos and found them a very nice mix of different flavors.   You could taste the grilled mahi-mahi and a light hint of the cabage and citrus sauce in each bite.  The place was humming with a lot of people, but very easy to hold a conversation at the table.  My wife had the Steel City burrito, it was made with grilled steak, French fries and cabage, a nice homage to the steak salad with fries that Pittsburgh is known for.   We ended the meal spliting some fried ice cream.  The ice cream took a while, but was worth the wait and it was a nice size portion for the two of us.    I will be returning again soon.....  A great place for a nice dinner out."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this place, and as such I was very disappointed when it didn't live up to expectations. I've constantly heard that it's the best Mexican (or most authentic) in the city, so I guess I had very high expectations.

Our service was awful - granted it was a Saturday night and busy, but that's no excuse for mismanaged hosting and a waitress who didn't wipe off our table, check that we had napkins & silverware, or even let us know why we got chips first and then salsa about five minutes later. The guacamole was flavorless and some of the worst I've had.

My wife and I decided to share a bunch of tacos, our favorites and a staple of any good Mexican place. We got three each of Tacos al pastor, tinga, and veggie. The vegetable tacos were the worst: literally just peppers & onions in tortillas. Well-cooked, but obviously just whatever they put on with fajitas.

The pastor was overcooked and tasted strongly of cinnamon. The tinga was braised white meat which meat it was flavorless and overcooked. The tortillas were tasty, but that's about it.

Drinks were excellent: the best margaritas I've had. But other than that, there's no reason to come back. Mad Mex doesn't pretend to be \"authentic\" (whatever that means), but orders are well-cooked and taste good. The same couldn't be said at my visit to Azul."}
{"text":"Loved the queso fundido and the brown salsa!   We sat at the bar.  The strange thing is that classic rock was blaring.  What about some music themed to the restaurant??  Great place overall."}
{"text":"I have always gone to eat at Azul despite the fact that it is always hit or miss. This last visit will surly be my last. The service, for once was actually good. The food was mostly bland & tasted much different than it ever had before. Usually the pork enchiladas are quite tasty, but for some reason they were over powered with cinnamon. I had hardly any sauce on my plate. Also, the pico today was only diced up tomatoes, and as usual -- no queso fresco! Just take it off your menu already! They NEVER have any on the dishes that claim to have it. The pinto beans have either been changed or we were just served whatever beans were just laying around. Not to mention I was served a pretty rotten avacado. The rice didn't taste very fresh & was more bland than anything. So sad the owners have let this place go down hill so much!!"}
{"text":"I live in the area and have been here many times.  I like the food so 
I keep coming back despite the fact that the service is consistently terrible."}
{"text":"They said they had a new chef starting that night and it shows. I didn't think this was good food much less good Mexican food. The carne aside was tough, the chicken on the kids tacos was burnt and the black beans were still raw.  The service was good and they were very friendly. The chips were good and so were the margaritas but that's about it. For the price I doubt we would ever go back. Very pricey especially given the poor quality."}
{"text":"One evening, my family of six and friends with a family of four arrived at Azul on a Saturday night at 6:00.  It was pouring down rain and together, we had 6 children with us.  Initially, they told us there would be 45 minute wait.  That was going to be impossible for our large, young group.  However, before we could turn around to leave, someone approached us to tell us that we could use the room upstairs.  It was fabulous!!!  We had our own room with a wonderful waiter to meet our needs.  They accommodated us beautifully when it would've been much easier for them to make us wait for a table downstairs.  Margaritas are wonderfully delicious (and I am very picky)... All natural ingredients, no doubt!  The food was also outstanding!  Highly recommend!!!  Thanks Azul!  See you soon!"}
{"text":"We are very fortunate to have such a great place so close to home. Great atmosphere with a really cool look inside and out and even better food. The entrees, chips and salsa are way above what you would get in an average chain type \"Mexican\" restaurant. The salsa is darker and richer and addictive. Chips fresh and made onsite. Have never been disappointed with any entree. My go to is the chicken enchiladas. Has to be able it 3 oz of chicken in each of the 3 enchiladas. Great flavor and portion size. Servers are always friendly as well."}
{"text":"Started off with the home made chips/salsa.  At first I didn't care for the salsa; which I think was because of the texture, but ended up liking it.  Has a nice kick.  The meals on the other hand could have been better.  For the shrimp enchilada they fold the tortilla shell and put 1-2 shrimp on top of it, while it seemed only stuffed with melted cheese.  While the shrimp wasn't bad tasting, I felt like I was just eating a bunch of tortilla shell.  Husband had the shrimp fajitas.  If you're a Mexican restaurant, I feel the fajita should come out on a sizzling cast iron pan and the tortillas should be warmed/served in a container w/ a lid.  Shrimp/veggies all served on a plate with the tortillas wrapped in foil.  Presentation is EVERYTHING!!!!!  Also had a mojito & fried ice cream; both of which were good.  Would have given 3 stars if I was more impressed with the main courses."}
{"text":"The food at Azul is delicious. It isn't your normal Mexican food. It has a nice southern California mix thrown in. The burritos are enormous and you can get them \"wet\" or \"dry.\" If you choose wet then you can choose between two great sauces, green or red mole sauce. I recommend trying it with both. They always give you more than enough food. 

The art and atmosphere in the restaurant are great. It is very bright and has great funky art on the walls. 

Their desserts are great. I recommend the fried cheesecake...it is so good! 

They have a great selection on their menu and I recommend trying it."}
{"text":"Per local friends who had a kiddo who wanted to stay at home instead of going out to eat, we picked up take out from here. We ordered beef fajitas, shrimp fajitas, a carnitas plate and mancha (shredded need) enchiladas. Of course we added in an order of salsa, guac and chips.Everything was very delish! Will have to remember this place when looking for Mexican in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"We have been here before decided to try again. Waitress was sweet and drinks came right away. However we hardly saw our waitress for water refills or questions. I did send my meal back of chili relleno due to being saturated in old oil.  The steak tacos they sent out after were wonderful."}
{"text":"I have been a patron of Azul for as long as they have been in business.  Over the yearsIi have witnessed the decline in the quality of the food and service, and today was the last straw.  To make a long story short: The service was very slow for no reason, over 1 hour to receive my lunch order,  the quality of the food was terrible and when I spoke with the manager she some how blamed me for not liking the horrible food they served me.  I have been a loyal patron for years and I will NEVER go back to this restaurant and I urge anyone reading this review to consider eating somewhere else until Azul gets their act together."}
{"text":"Nice Mexican Food. Love the Mole, chips and salsa are great. Pork and chicken are delicious. Flour not corn tortillas, wished they were corn. We will go back."}
{"text":"I suppose the cuisine is Cali/Mex. Whatever it is I hope they will be serving it in heaven. Food guy my whole life and this is very original, delicious food. Hats off to this place. Wow. Do not remember the last time I ate something that was so delicious, but original. The flavor profiles and combinations are unique and genius. Three thumbs up if I had that many."}
{"text":"I have to give Azul five stars because when it comes to Mexican restaurants in Pittsburgh, Azul is hands down my favorite place. Authentic food, fun colorful atmosphere, and GREAT cocktails. 

Naturally, the Margaritas are a staple and a 'must-get'if if it's your first time at Azul. So tasty and a perfect start to the night.

Tejitos - a mojito made with tequila - this is one of my favorite cocktails in Pittsburgh - absolutely delicious. I like mine traditional but last time I was in I tried a mango version, it was pretty damn good too. 

And, unexpectedly, they have the most amazing Bloody Mary's - made with orange juice and Tajin (a new favorite spice of mine) - no horseradish. Slightly citrusy and very delicious. 

The wait staff is friendly and attentive - especially if the owners are around - and they generally are, doing their rounds making sure everything is going smoothly and that their customers are enjoying themselves.

The food is just phenom: 

To start - The best homemade (and if they aren't homemade they are still just the best) chips, served with a few different salsas - so those are necessary for every trip to Azul. Table-side Guacamole, and my new favorite - Queso Fundido - a cheese dip with a kick to eat with your chips. If you are ever there on a night when they are serving mussels, that's a no brainer, also a must get.

For your meal - If you haven't filled up on cheese dip, salsa and guac - then you have an array of options to choose from. I usually go for whatever taco special they have, last time I was there it was a wild mushroom taco, I've also had duck tacos and probably my favorite was a pork belly taco. You are typically served two tacos on your choice of corn or flour tortillas, along with rice and beans. There is a host of other options available as well, from salads to steaks, quesadillas and Azul Soup (which is really more of a delicious chicken stew with tortilla strips, avocados with delicious spices and veggies).

Usually pretty busy on weekends for dinner, so if you're coming on a Friday or Saturday,  you may have a short wait. But they have a gorgeous bar, and as mentioned, awesome cocktails so I never mind. As a general rule of thumb, if you're coming with six or more be sure to make a reservation any night, just in case. They also have two private rooms upstairs for parties, which is always a good time. 

Well worth a trip to the 'burbs for this great find."}
{"text":"Azul continues to be one of the finest Mexican restaurants in the Pittsburgh area. The ambiance is inviting, comfortable and charming. The food is delicious and authentic. They serve the best guacamole in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Love love love Azul!!!! 

 Probably as close to west coast southwest cuisine as you can get in Pittsburgh. My husband always gets either a Sol beer or a lime margarita and I always have the white sangria..... Goes down just a little too easy.  We take our daughters who love it. From the chips and homemade salsa to the burritos to the fish tacos. It is an awesome culinary experience. Only problem is we are always too fulll and happy to try the fried ice cream for dessert. 
Service is exceptional. Prices are good and the place hops on weekends. Good news is you can have  a drink at the bar while you wait for a table."}
{"text":"Margaritas are good. We came in on a Friday night with a table of 7 and our waitress forgot to put in an order for 2 of the 7. Our waitress dropped a plate and somehow he got a new dish and ate his meal and our dishes still had not come out. She kept saying it should be out in a minute until she finally figured out that she forgot to put in our order. We were seated for 45 minutes for our food to come out and everyone was ready for checks when our food arrived. I calmly asked for a box when my food finally came. Then the bill came and everything was charged full price. I guess we should have complained more but it was almost comical how terrible an experience it was. Never would give it another shot and obviously would not recommend"}
{"text":"Good place to eat definitely one of the nicer places in area. It was my first time here and will be coming back for sure"}
{"text":"I really want to like place but it always lets me down... Food is always a let down. I keep coming back Hoping it will be better and it never is...good margarita!"}
{"text":"OK food, too pricey.

I liked the food at Azul. Everything I ordered was a little different than I expected it to be...which was sometimes good, sometimes not so good. 

The salsa here is great, a little smokey. The queso dip had a texture that was more like melted cheese (stringy, ooey gooey) rather than saucy, which was a fun surprise. Note that unlike most Mexican joints, they charge you for chips and salsa refills!

The house margarita was excellent and tasted really fresh.

I ordered the chicken fajitas ($14), and I expected them to come on a huge sizzling platter, but I was a little disappointed. The portion was smallish and there wasn't any kind of sauce so it was a little dry. The rice and black beans were both bland.

Overall, I think I would have preferred to go to a traditional Mexican-style restaurant where I would have paid less and had more flavorful main dishes."}
{"text":"I work right down the street from here and had no idea it was here. It's a very hip place that seems kind of out of place in Leetsdale. The menu is a good assortment of your typical Mexican  fare. They make the guacamole fresh at your table, which is a fun touch, but I found the guacamole to be pretty flavorless and unimpressive. I got the soup as my meal and it is a giant bowl of a chicken tortilla-type soup. I thought it was really good and had great flavor. The other diners I was with got the salad with steak or chicken. They all seemed to enjoy it, but no one seemed overly impressed by it. I didn't eat it though so I can't really make a fair judgement on it. We were the only ones dining when we were there during lunch and it seemed like our meals took a very long time for a place with no one else in it and also considering we just ordered soup and some salads. I think we waited at least a half hour."}
{"text":"Why go all the way to Mexico for great Mexican food when you can go to Leetsdale and dine at Azul? The food is consistently wonderful, the owners are friendly and professional, and the ambiance is lovely and unique. This is not a \"me too\" Mexican restaurant. Lots of care has gone into the menu and the dining experience. Here are some hints: (1) the Pork Belly tacos are excellent - - my favorite item. You can get them for lunch as well as dinner even though they only appear on the dinner menu. (2) Always get the HOUSE MARGARITA, and get the double on the rocks. They use good tequila and other ingredients in the house margarita so there is no reason to opt for the more expensive options. (3) Get the tableside guacamole. Delicious and entertaining as well - - one of their signature items. (4) Ask your server if the kitchen is backed up. I've eaten here many times and my only complaint is that on some occasions the food can be a bit slow coming. That said, it has always been worth the wait and the made-in-house tortilla chips and salsa are worth the price and make the time go quickly. Final tip, try to get either Marin or Benjamin as your server if you can. Marin is charming and Benjamin is MANTASTIC. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This used to be our favorite Mexican restaurant as we ate there frequently (at least one a week) for a couple years.  But we stopped going there a couple years ago for multiple reasons (I won't cover them here because it was too long ago).  But last night we met friends there.  I am an extremely patient person when it comes to the food business (I worked in the industry for years) but last night was arguably the worst service I have ever experienced.  It was 20 minutes before we were greeted at the table.  It was 45 minutes before we even got napkins - even longer for silverware.  There were issues with the drinks which were not rectified until I spoke with the owner.  But she seemed more put out by my concerns than anyting.  The food is pretty good but I can get good Mexican cuisine a lot of places.  It will be a long time before I ever return to Azul ... if ever."}
{"text":"We have tried Azul a few times before and decided to go back with friends.  What a wonderful experience.  Crystal, our server, was fantastic - friendly, attentive and well versed on the menu.  I had the chile relennos with the pork and it was excellent.  Our friends had the fajitas and enjoyed them as well.  Guacamole made table side was also a hit.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed the food and service.  Table quac was above average.  The restaurant was very smokey from cooking that evening, but very good and we will be back."}
{"text":"Sketchy-looking location, really nice atmosphere inside though - the outside of the building was definitely deceiving and we almost didn't want to go in.. food was great but too much chipotle in the salsa...waitress was extremely short with us and acted like we were interrupting her day or something - she was just very unfriendly and rude so it kind of tainted the whole experience."}
{"text":"As soon as I walked up to the door I knew I was going to love it! The architecture and ambiance of the place was amazing! I loved the art and the interior of the restaurant. The food was awesome and I can't wait to go back and try something else on the menu. 
Although, the reason why I didn't give it 5 stars is because some of the menu items were a little pricey. 10 dollars for a margarita, seriously?
Overall, it was a great experience and I will definitely go back, and bring more money!"}
{"text":"I lived in Southern California for over 16 years and Arizona for over 6 months. I've been to Mexico MANY times. I've eaten at many restaurants run by people born in Mexico in the US. Since Azul was only listed in the best margarita category, I was expecting the drinks to be better than the food, but hopeful the food would be good, too.

I love Mexican food and especially guacamole. They asked if we wanted chips & salsa, so I assumed they were charging us for them, but it was odd that they didn't TELL us they would charge for them OR suggest that for just $6 more we could get the chips, salsa, & guacamole (they call it tableside guacamole, but it was NOT made anywhere near our table or anywhere that I could see him. (Bryan said he could see him, but he wasn't near our table.) Normally, they ask how spicy you want guacamole that's made fresh. They didn't ask us and ours was SUPER bland. More bland than the guac you'd pick up in a super market or Costco. The chips were even more bland. Horrible - no taste at all and NO salt at all.

I got a house margarita, since that seems to be the best way to judge a margarita - no extra flavoring and they should be able to make that one really well. It was okay. Not bad, but nothing to write home about. And I certainly would never vote for it on the Best of List for Pittsburgh.

The worst thing about Azul is that they CLAIM to be the only authentic Mexican restaurant in Pittsburgh, but they're really not. The food is generally very bland and mostly uses FLOUR tortillas, which are not as common in Mexico. Personally, I like flour tortillas, but in Mexico you encounter a lot more corn tortillas.

My burrito was delicious. Very flavorful and delicious. Service wasn't very good. We were never asked if we wanted more drinks (and I would have tried one of the flavored margaritas - Bryan would have probably gotten another drink, too - this is how you increase your tip... it was like he didn't realize he was working for tips). Our waiter was nice and our food was warm when we got it, but the rest of the service was unimpressive. 

I'm sure we'll go back and I hope the food will be better next time, but I really think they need to remove the blurb about being authentic. I probably would have been a bit more forgiving of the bland food if they didn't present to be the only authentic Mexican restaurant in Pittsburgh. I call BS on that claim... Very disappointing if comparing to Mexican restaurants. If comparing to Pittsburgh Mexican restaurants, it's not too bad, just a blander version of Plaza Azteca."}
{"text":"Love this place!!! Always great service awesome food and amazing margaritas! Try the quest with chorizo in it... and table side guacamole.... to die for!!"}
{"text":"I can't help but hit up Azul anytime I'm in the Sewickley/Leetsdale area.   The problem is that unless you are looking for the restaurant, you will never find it.   It is in a house on a residential street and is rather unassuming.   You probably wouldn't even know it was a restaurant on the off chance you were driving down the street.

I've always wondered how they stay in business because every time I've gone here for lunch, the restaurant is relatively empty (one to three tables full).  Because of that, I haven't had the bad service that others have mentioned.  I really like the chips and queso.  I recommend the queso or guac over the salsa.  Why the salsa is good, it doesn't have enough flavor/spice for me.  Also, this is one of the few Mexican restaurants that charges you for chips and salsa.  

I can't speak for all the items on the menu because I always get the Azul chicken burrito (served 'wet' or with sauce).  It's delicious, steaming hot, flavorful and filling.  You can't go wrong with this option.   Everyone I've ever brought here for lunch has been very pleased with their order.  I haven't had any drinks with lunch but looks like they have a ton of tequila options."}
{"text":"I've been back multiple times. While I still prefer El Paso in Chippewa I do like the quality of the food. Their fajitas are yummy but don't expect the sizzling plate. I'm not giving them 5 stars Bc I still think that they are overpriced."}
{"text":"This Mexican restaurant is amazing. The enchiladas were amazing. The chips are so good and the salsa was really fresh. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Best margaritas I've ever had! They were not syrupy and fake and they were strong! The prices are higher than your typical \"pick a meal 1-50\" but it's evident they use high quality ingredients.  The chicken was so tender and juicy and smokey from the grill, and the jumbo shrimp were HUGE!  Everything was wonderful, I was trying to be healthy so we skipped the chips and salsa but I'm hoping to come back and try them because everyone around us seemed to be inhaling them and they looked delicious! This is definitely elevated Mexican cuisine and we will put this on our list of places to eat at monthly.  I felt like I could eat a real healthy meal here too which most times I feel like crap after going to for Mexican."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now. 

Pros:
- It's practically the only restaurant in Leetsdale, and a real hidden gem.  Both times I went, I parked right out front on the street without a problem.
- Service is decent
- Good ambiance.  It's definitely a Mexican restaurant, but not over the top cheesy
- Speaking of cheese, the queso dip is delicious.  You can tell they use real cheese and not the traffic cone orange melted plastic version.
- Vegetable enchiladas.  Trust me on this one; I'm not even vegetarian or vegan.
- Pork belly tacos.  See above: definitely an omnivore!
- They bring out Cholula hot sauce with your order
- They offer mole sauce as an enchilada option--not many places around here do, so I was delighted to see it.  It was respectable!

Cons:
- Chips and salsa aren't gratis.  They aren't expensive either, but just something to note so that you aren't surprised by the bill later.
- I make it a point to try the carnitas plate at almost every Mexican restaurant I patronize, and I must say that this one was disappointing.  Small quantity, tough, and didn't have that signature crispiness
- The texture of the rice is fluffy-bordering-on-shredded and I didn't find it particularly flavorful

And honestly, those cons aren't deal-breakers.  My standards on Mexican food are pretty high on account of my ethnic background (My Grandma made fresh tortillas every couple days, fo' real.) and the amount of time I spent living in SoCal, and while Azul would probably not come on top if pitted against my favorite spots back in San Diego, I really like this restaurant and plan to be a semi-regular for as long as I live in the area!"}
{"text":"Small restaurant, loved the decor but hated the food. Maybe I'll try it again when I'm not In a rush and I can ask questions about the menu."}
{"text":"We came here on Cinco de Mayo, feeling festive.  We so wanted to like this place but were underwhelmed.  Cute decor, but the all-male staff offered slow, mediocre service.  Not sure what was going on with them that day but it sure wasn't a \"fiesta.\" They had nothing going on for the \"holiday\" that we could tell.  We weren't offered chips & salsa and it took an hour to get our food.  The beans seemed old or canned.  Kudos to them though for setting up shop in an otherwise dreary neighborhood. I hope more small businesses come to the area."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying, I'mreally hoping that I visited on a bad day.  I LOVE Mexican and I wanted to like this restaurant so much because I thought I found a 'hidden jem' near our new house + all the reviews were so good, but...yikes.

Personally, I would think of this restaurant as more of a trendy take on Mexican.  Sort of Mad-Mexish maybe? But not exactly. I am normally not a person to salt my food, but I felt like just about EVERYTHING needed salt and/or was very bland.  It started with the salsa, then the guac, the pico then the rice and beans.  I mean TOTALLY BLAND.  I even got a pineapple margarita lacked flavor.  I thought there was something wrong with me but my friend I was eating with confirmed it. 

The salsa was brown and I'd guess was roasted tomato flavor?  I can appreciate a non-traditional salsa, but I dind't taste any seasonings and it didn't have a citric taste like any tomato salsa would normally have.  Next we ordered the tableside guacamole. We are guac finatics, but the pico they added had no citrus zing and it needed salt. They made it tableside, but it was already all in the bowl when she brought it and she just mashed it at the table.  

The pineapple margarita seemed to be made with fresh pineapple juice, which is awesome.  I ordered it blended and it was very watered down. but I dind't think $8 for an Avion margarita was that bad. 

I had the surf n turf burrito which was loaded with delicious tender steak and big shrimp, both cooked very well.  It was topped with a creamy orange colored sauce that was very tasty...but then they stuffed it with rice that had NO flavor. It looked redish orange, but had literally ZERO flavor. I had to ask the waitress for a salt shaker to even be able to eat it, but it barley helped. 

My friend had the grilled mahi mahi tacos which she said were really good.  But she had the same opinion on the rice. It also came with black beans that tasted like boiled, rinsed, dry black beans. No seasonings that we could detect. 

In fairness to the restaurant, I did not complain.  When this many things are wrong, you just kind of assume that this is how they make their food and that we just wont go back.  I'm teetering about trying it again because if the food was this bad all the time I dont know how it could still be open."}
{"text":"Great chips and guacamole! Margarita's are OK, but nothing too special, and the prices are high."}
{"text":"We came here on a recommendation of a friend and her family. Watch out here; They charge you for the chips and salsa that are free everywhere else. I had chicken fajitas; chicken was moist and tender but not grilled and had no seasonings. Veggies were tasty. Black beans were so-so. Margarita are not sweet and quite strong. My friend had a Caesar salad, she was not impressed. I didn't remember what our other friend had. After dinner we all agreed that we would not return nor recommend it to others."}
{"text":"This place was a great surprise on a recent trip to visit friends near Pittsburgh. Great  chips, salsa and food. A great place to meet up with friends and hang out. Definitely on par with our top fav's for mexican back home."}
{"text":"Had a late lunch there today. Good service.  Cold food.  Too expensive. All four chairs at our table were wobbly.  Not just a little wobbly but dangerous.  This is my fourth time there and I won't be going back.  I had the Azul Combo.  The only thing that was hot was the black beans that were probably nuked.  They weren't busy so there is no excuse for cold food."}
{"text":"So good! My boyfriend had the steak burrito and I had the guacamole with a classic margarita. Reminded us of home in Arizona. Will be back again."}
{"text":"I'm looking for any excuse to go here, and the fact that my kids can see trains from the front window has been a perfect reason to bring the family on more than one occasion. Super nice staff, absolutely amazing food. I love it here!"}
{"text":"Found myself in Ambridge today, and hungry for Mexican.  \"Here is a place that seems nearby\", said Faithful Siri, so off we went.  Significantly off the beaten path is this little cantina!  The place is cute with far more tables than one would expect in a small area.  It was about 1:30 pm and only three tables were occupied, one server on deck.  Despite this, service was pretty slow, not only to just be greeted, but to get a menu, a drink, salt and pepper (Oddly, not on the table to begin with.) etc.  The lunch menu was pretty limited--only one side of one page, and I felt a little expensive particularly given the Ambridge location.  A $3 charge for chips and salsa, but I get this--the chain places can afford to toss what customers waste, a small place cannot.  I ordered their combo, a taco, an enchilada, a tostado served with rice and beans of choice.  It made for a HUGE plate of food, which actually made the $12 price understandable. The rice, which looked almost...grated, I found to be very dry and tasteless, and the black beans, while tasty, could've benefitted from more than just the 3 cheese shreds on top.  The main food items were awesome, however!  Hot, flavorful and delicious.  I ordered chicken, (which means all 3 items are chicken--no mixing and matching) and I thought the flavors were well-blended and the presentation was pleasing.  I' ll probably come back, and I'd recommend to others, although hoping they would receive more cohesive service.  By the way, parking is either on-street in this family neighborhood, or in 4 or 5 spaces on the side of the building."}
{"text":"Azul is not that bad. Went here for lunch the other day for the area this place is not bad. The salsa was really good and my enchilada was not that bad also (Steak). The place is really nice and clean, good atmosphere...they do have some really funky chairs though.

We sat at the bar and our waiter was okay but spent most of her time talking on the phone, not a huge deal. Service was fast but they were really not busy. 

May visit again in the future but honestly this place was just average to me. Although if you factor in the area there is nothing like this around for miles.

Give it a try."}
{"text":"Grossly understaffed!  The wait staff are scattered and not focused on the customers, they are taking names at the door, bussing, breaking down and setting up tables.  The manager was working the bar (with no other bartender), the door, seating customers and bussing tables.  We took a seat at the bar to wait for a table (over an hour wait) and were told by the manager/bartender that she would be with us in a few minutes; ten minutes later we asked if we could get a drink and were met with a big sigh and \"I am doing the best that I can, be with you as soon as I can.\"  Really?  Once we were finally seated we placed orders and started waiting all over again, for over an hour for a table of tacos.  The food was below par, the rice was over cooked, the black bean went from the can to the plate and the tacos were bland and not at all as described on the menu.  My order was incorrect, but I sucked it up and ate it anyway as I did not want to another 45 minutes for a correction.

This charming place has the potential to be really good, but right now there is too much chaos, which appears to start at the top and trickles down to the rest of the staff.  HIRE MORE PEOPLE AND GET ORGANIZED."}
{"text":"Great service, even better food. Cool little local spot. Waitress was very nice and patient (we had two little kids). Surf n turf burrito was amazing!"}
{"text":"This is a jewel of a joint. Great, happy, knowledgeable staff. Great tequila selection, outstanding margaritas. Food is delicious and authentic. My first five star review."}
{"text":"Well, i really wanted to hate this place.  $2 for a side of sour cream?!?  Pay for the basket of chips and salsa that are usually free?  However, the food was above average.  

The \"tableside\" guacamole, was definitely guacamole, but certainly NOT made tableside: our waitress just dropped off a mortar half-full of $10 guac.  Overpriced say the least.  

The drinks were awesome, the tequito, with freshly muddled mint was great.  In fact, everything was good.  I had the Mahi tacos, with cabbage and aioli.  The portion of fish in comparison to the tortilla was generous, and the fish was cooked well.

We had a large group, and what seemed like a fairly new waitress, so the service was sub-par.  She never asked how the food was, but did keep up with the drinks.

Would be a solid four stars if not for the overpriced (and not tablside) guac, and the $4 chips and salsa that is free at every other Mexican place in the free world."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant twice with high expectations. However, both times were a disappointment.

Now, I should have prefaced this review with the fact that I grew up in southern California where one can get extraordinary Mexican food, and at reasonable prices, too. So, I'm already a bit biased. Just the same, I went to this restaurant with as open a mind as I could muster.

the food: nicely displayed, but bland and somewhat skimpy servings

the service: poor

the tables and chairs: surprisingly uncomfortable

the ambiance: probably the only good thing about the place

the prices: depending on your point of view between high to exorbitant, especially the latter if you should want any alcoholic beverage, even as simple as a beer or glass of wine - also expensive considering its location"}
{"text":"Anytime my husband and I are craving authentic Mexican food, we go to Azul. 

The Azul Margarita is a must try. If margaritas aren't your thing, they have a very nice selection of Mexican beers. My only complaint with the drinks is that they are very expensive-- $12 for a margarita! The first time we visited we were in shock that we managed to spend $48 on 2 margaritas each-- so keep that in mind so you aren't shocked when you get the bill. 

Anytime we visit, we get an order of the table side guacamole to start our meal-- some of the best guac I've had. I got the Mahi Mahi Tacos and my husband had the Carne Asada Steak Tacos, both entrees came with rice and the choice of black beans or pinto beans-- we both got black beans. The tacos were fantastic, the rice and beans were only okay-- not my favorite. 

Overall, Azul has great authentic Mexican food and we will be back!"}
{"text":"Been coming since it opened and have always enjoyed our dining experience. I have heard lately that it's gone down hill. I'm not really one to complain...but hopefully a poor review will help this business get its act together. Came with some friends on a weeknight...and they were out of my fav the half of a chicken.  No real issues, ok, I'll find some thing else...few weeks go by and my out of town daughter comes in late on a Friday...so I suggest Azul.We got there around 8pm and sat at the bar. It wasn't crowded at all. The waitress took our drink and chip order informing us it would be a few minutes for the chips...they were making fresh batches. We received the drinks quickly.....and that's where it totally fell apart. Our waitress disappeared outside on her phone. We sat for about another half an hour...and two of the waiters came up, got us drinks and gave us free guacamole . They said they saw us sitting there the whole time and felt bad. One offered to take our order. I'm not stupid...and I wanted to leave...but it's nearing 9pm and by the time we drive elsewhere....bottom line I was famished. The waitress reappeared and apologized...but went back outside on here phone!!!! They were out of the chicken AGAIN.....so we ordered salads  which were stupidly dinky and left.  We got in the car and I realized it was 10:10.... Unbelievable . Never again\"..."}
{"text":"Been traveling to this restaurant for years.  Can't believe they were out of gaucamole, just lock the door!  Abt 4pm only one other couple eating, very slow svs.  Think they do better evening svs when more servers.  Than close during day!  At least 1 fam member needs to be around, this is what happens when you trust fam bus to someone else!  Food was ok, but I have had better there.  Disappointed but w return."}
{"text":"So far, this is the best \"elevated\" Mexican fare that I've had in the 'Burgh! By elevated, I mean ingredients beyond pork, chicken, beef, steak, and veggies and not a hole in the wall or a truck.  

Don't get me wrong, I love me an awesome hole in the wall Mexican place; The kind you go into and aren't 100% sure you understand what the ingredients are in that enchilada, but you know it will be awesome no matter what! Or that cool taco truck you chase all around town, trying to figure out their hours... 

Well, this place is not that!  It's a just a great restaurant with a great atmosphere and, when I've gone, great service!

Try the chile rellenos - Best Ever!!! Their steak nachos are also to die for, with big chunks of steak and pickled jalapenos and carrots.  The pinto beans are made with pork fat, and they are delicious! And, I really love their sangria... maybe too much.  It's in the middle of nowhere, so keep that in mind when you order your second glass.  Of course, there are worse places to be stuck than a restaurant that serves Awesome pork belly tacos!!!"}
{"text":"I have been to Azul before when it was a solid 4 stars.  Great homemade chips and salsa, very good guacamole, excellent drinks, and some good menu items.  Tonight was a 2 star experience but I still gave it 3 stars because I suspect it was just a bad night.  I tried to order the special fish tacos that sounded interesting.  One salmon, one tuna, and one mahi mahi.  Waitress informed me that the special had been modified and instead of one of each kind, I could get 2 tuna or 2 salmon.  I should have bailed at this point and ordered off the menu but I picked the tuna.  Bad choice.  It was described as \"seared Ahi tuna\" and the waitress confirmed it was rare.  Sounded good. Instead, I got 2 chunks of over cooked dry chewy not at all good tuna.  Took two bites and stopped.  Waitress asked if everything was good and I told her \"no, the tuna is over cooked and not good.\"  She said she was sorry.  My daughter's enchiladas were good and the chips were excellent.  I came home and ate a sandwich. I might try Azul again but I won't order fish anything."}
{"text":"People say this place is a little pricy, and it is, but in my opinion it's absolutely worth it.  I don't think we ever go without getting the house made chips, salsa and guacamole.  The steak quesadilla is something that will make you want to slap the person next to you.  The steak is almost melt in your mouth tender.  The carnitas are also really good.  The layers of flavor in the pork are something I haven't experienced at any other Mexican place in the city.  I honestly have nothing negative to say about this place.  The drinks are always on point, the staff is always friendly and the meals are always great."}
{"text":"Good Mexican restaurant. Homemade guacamole is great! They make a great sangria also! A little drafty as there isn't a storm door. Don't recommend sitting near the entrance in the winter since constant traffic with people leaving and coming in the door brings the cold air in."}
{"text":"We were looking forward to some good Mexican food after returning to the States from overseas. Unfortunately our queso came with a gigantic black hair in it. Yuck! No apologies. No visit from the manager. These things happen, but a proper manager should know how to handle it. It was hard to enjoy a meal after that. Also, the atmosphere is so loud, it's difficult to have a conversation."}
{"text":"FANTASTIC! We ad steak tacos and they were so good. They weren't salty and it was cut up steak. Everything was fresh and Donna the owner was so nice. Go you be happy you did!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy Azul.  I've been coming here for years (I couldn't try their amazing mojitos when I first started coming here, it's been that long).  Definitely get the tableside quacamole and chips.  The quac is a little expensive, but it's prepared fresh for you the second you order it.  The chips are homemade and perfectly crunchy and salty with that amazing \"just out of the frier\" sheen to them.

The food has been better, though.  I heard a few years back that it changed hands.  It used to be \"authentic\" Mexican food with a great family running the show.  One of our favorite servers is never there, and I think he was part of the first iteration of Azul.  It isn't as spicy as it once was and the sides are just that - sides.  Easily forgotten.

I still enjoy their huge burritos, my mom gets chiles rellenos like always, and my step-dad gets their enchiladas and fajitas and happily finishes his plate.

Expect to eat, drink, and be merry here.  At night when it's swinging, the ambiance is a nice warm buzz and you leave feeling super-satisfied."}
{"text":"Greasy and insepid - there is clearly no thought or love put on not the food being served. They couldn't even fry the chips correctly. On the bright side - the margarita is on point."}
{"text":"I was absolutely horrified by my experience here. I am from the south and constantly in search of the best Mexican restaurant in Pittsburgh. I have found a few I enjoy. We wanted to try Azul for a special occasion. There was a wait, which we expected. We made friends with the people in front and behind us while we drank our Margaritas. The foursome in front of us was celebrating as well (engagement); the couple behind, just out for a nice dinner. When we were sat after 40 minutes of waiting, we immediately ordered since we had been eyeing up the menu for a while. 1 hour and 20 minutes later (2 hours of waiting total), we noticed the foursome who sat before us still not received their food and were subsequently complaining, while the couple behind us had. We still had no food. We had ordered Chips and Salsa with our original order. After noticing those who sat AFTER we ordered, we asked the waiter to bring us our check with the drinks and chips so we could leave. After handing over my credit card with the $29 check to pay for the chips, salsa and margaritas, the waiter mentioned that the food was in the window and he could wrap it up \"to go\" for us. I responded that it was fine if it was still there. 
He returned a check that was not the one I had sent my card with. I totaled and signed for the amount of the chips and drinks  (2 drinks, chips and salsa $29.) We left the boxed up food on the table - stunned that we were charged. for the food. Then after we left the restaurant, the waiter RAN  up the road saying we didn't pay for the chips and drink. We signed for the total of the first check ($29) and did not authorize the food. We explained we signed and authorized the charge for $29 but would not pay for the food since we did not take it.  I honestly can't leave a review for the food since we did not try it due to the wait, but our experience here was just awful."}
{"text":"I've had some great meals here, but more recently the quality has fallen off a bit. 

The deop in the quality of service has been the most noticeable to me - forgotten drink orders, empty glasses, and room-temperature entrees have become the norm for my most recent visits.

Azul has a great atmosphere, and fantastic margaritas. But I would like to see the quality of service increase a bit before I go back."}
{"text":"This was  a little gem of a restaurant in Leetsville, PA.  A gritty little town on the Ohio just down the road from Swickely, PA which has addresses that used to belong to the steel barons back in the day and now home to Mario Lemieux and others.  The restaurant served good mexican fare and I had the mahi mahi tacos, along with chips and salsa and the chocolate flan for dessert.  There were nice touches inside such as using the heavy mexican blown glassware.  The night was pretty slow but probably not unusual for a Tuesday evening in mid January.  My issues are all things easily corrected.  One, the place was  freezing.  I would  have died for a little warmth.  This in fact leads to my first complaint.  The chips could have been kept in a warner as they come to the table stone cold and the salsa, while flavorful lacked  any spicy heat and was served at refrigerator temperature.  The fish tacos were excellent but I would have liked a little chipotle aoli to spice them up a little.  Now, the dessert...Oh My God...it was a masterpiece.  The chocolate flan must have been made in massive dishes.  A 3x3 chunk of lovely cake topped with a perfect flan was served on a chocolate drizzled plate along with strawberries and fresh whipped cream.  It is almost indescribable. While I didn't imbibe in the margaritas and stuck to draft XX amber I saw their tequila list and it was impressive.  The staff was fairly attentive although aloof.  I would  definitely go back as I was travelling on business and this little place made the trip a little less dreary in the mid winter."}
{"text":"BJ was in the mood for Mexican on Friday night and I had been wanting to try this restaurant for quite some time.  So, it was pretty easy to talk him into driving to Leetsdale.  This place is easy to find, it's located just one block off of Ohio River Boulevard.  When we arrived, the place was pretty busy with people coming and going and only a couple tables available.

We were greeted right away by our server.  We started with the $4 chips and salsa and BJ got a Pacifico beer and I got a frozen strawberry margarita.  My drink tasty but I thought it was pretty small for $8.  Also, I must say, we were kinda put off by the salsa.  We couldn't really figure out what is was or what was in it.  It took quite a few tastes before we got comfortable enough to eat it.  Our server later told us what the ingredients were, but I couldn't recognize them.  Also, for being made from roasted vegetables, it really didn't have all that much flavor.

It took awhile for our meals to arrive.  We both got shrimp.  BJ got fajitas and I got tacos.  Very few hits, mostly misses.  The fajitas were just okay.  The corn tortillas were thin and limp.  My tacos were just okay, too.  The rice was uninteresting.  Boring, actually. The black beans were bland.  My pinto beans were very good.  We really wanted to like this place.  But, sorry to say, it was not worth the $50+ price for two."}
{"text":"For months the teaser for writing a review about Azul appeared above my Yelp feed. I looked it up and realized it was a few miles up the river from where I live, and figured that one day I should give it a try. But driving farther 'into the burbs' wasn't very high on my desire list. So I waited for the right opportunity, and the day before the 4th of July, a friend and I were out and about and decided to give it a shot.

So off to the burbs we went, passing it at first thanks to Google directions, then back tracking and voila...there it was.

A very nice looking building with lovely decor on the outside, an impressive wooden door, the name, very modern and trendy above the door. At first we couldn't tell if it was open because there were no cars around, no people around, and it looked kind of dark inside. I got out of the car and peeked in the window and the staff was hanging out far in the back at the end of the bar and they all waved like 'we are HERE!'. So the car was parked and we prepared to enter.

We looked up and down the blocks surrounding this building. Leetsdale. Little tiny houses from decades gone by. A teeny tiny church on the next corner with a satellite dish on the side, and a few boarded up buildings across the street. It kind of made we laugh, thinking a tornado had whipped through Shadyside or the South Side, sucked up one of the trendy hipster establishments, and dumped it here in the middle-of-nowhere Leetsdale.

We went in, and there was one man at a table, and four staff members (ironically, not one Latino), one of whom, (Ben? A fresh faced and clean cut college aged boy with cute fuzzy legs) seated us and gave us the basic intro spiel, and took our drink order. Coke products. Thank goodness.

Again, the decor of the interior was very modern, trendy, well designed...and hilariously out of place for middle-of-nowhere Leetsdale. Very comfortable. I guess they get credit for taking on the challenge of going where the real estate is less expensive.

The menu was the typical round of Mexican fare, all of the usual offerings that you would find at Patron Grille, or any of the El Campesino group spots, but with a slight leaning toward Mad Mex, without the abject pretense.

I ordered a steak burrito, my friend the quesadilla. The burrito was very nicely stuffed and flavorful. They didn't make their own hot sauce (boo) but brought bottled of Chahlula to spice it up a bit. Decent sized burrito, cut in half and propped askew on the plate, with about a table spoon of sour cream and a pinch of lettuce with some diced tomatoes. Choice of beans IN the burrito, I had black beans, and the steak was actually very good steak with a lot of flavor. The quesadilla was, well, a quesadilla. A tortilla stuffed with cheese, folded in half, and grilled. On the plate with the same pinch of lettuce, diced tomato and spoonful of sour cream.

Now, the only issue I have with the place...for Mexican food, in the middle of nowhere...the prices were WAY too high. For a basic no-frills burrito and quesadilla, a Diet Coke, and a water, the bill was $35. Would I go back? Absolutely. The atmosphere was lovely, the staff was terrific, the food was as good as one would expect for Mexican food. Would I go back REGULARLY? Not so much. Patron Grille and El Campesinos are much more reasonable in price, for pretty much the same food, and they're a bit more generous in their offerings. They bring the first basket of chips and salsa free to the table, Azul offered it for $4. Patron and Campesino bring the burrito, sided with beans and rice. Azul just brought the burrito. If the prices were more in line with the usual Mexican restaurants, then it could be a regular spot. 

For a while, there were only three of us in the place eating, and then as we finished, the dinner crowd started to trickle in, and they soon had a decent amount of clientele filling the space. A couple of the tables looked like older monied daddies and their 'boys' from the burbs. Made me chuckle a bit. 

All in all, I would give them all five stars, except for the pricing, which is prohibitive of making it a 'regular' spot for 'regular' folk. But for Mexican food, they really are the ONLY offering of it's type in the area, and they ARE on the edge of Sewickley, so I guess pander they must. I just can't imagine anyone from outside the immediate driving range making it a 'destination' for much more than a one-shot deal. So four stars and special occasions it is."}
{"text":"Four of us went in August.  We had to change tables because of the awful fly problem at the table near the front window.  

Changing tables to one in the center of the room didn't help.  

We should have left. 

The salsa is watered down and tasteless.  No flavor at all.   We attempted to order three dishes off the menu which are no longer available according to our server.  

The same server forgot to bring beer orders as well.  

The entrees are so bland.   

We won't go back."}
{"text":"Beautiful atmosphere. That's it though. The food us very bland. Will not give this place a second chance."}
{"text":"What a terrific find!   Went with another couple and had a wonderful meal. Table side guacamole with house made chips, shrimp tacos and burrito all were very tasty topped off with a couple of margaritas. Crystal our server was extremely pleasant and attentive. Will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"This was my third visit and it did not live up to previous experiences. 

The staff was dramatically overworked with no bartender, and only two waitstaff working the bar and the whole floor. It wasn't their fault, but the service was slow and inattentive. Drinks went empty and were never refilled. 

Worse, though, was the food. Every bite, except the salad, was dramatically under-seasoned. I'm not one to like a lot of salt. In fact, it's often over used in most restaurants, but every single component of every dish was severely lacking in salt making them bland, sometimes bitter, and unappetizing.  

Also, charging $4 for chips and salsa is fine. I get it. The ingredients are not free. But the salsa was tasteless (again needing salt among other seasoning).  But the worst insult is then charging another $1.50 for a refill. 

I'll have a hard time justifying going back for a 4th visit."}
{"text":"Azul will take away your blues!  Prepare yourself for awesome home made salt and pepper tortilla chips and queso dip that tastes like joy in a bowl.  

Attentive staff served us a constant flow of home made Mojitos and Margaritas, as well as Mexican Beers on tap.

Everything tasted that much better served up on giant feasting hall style tables, surrounded by cool Mexican art, beautiful wood, and a blue tin ceiling.  

As good as the drinks, decor, and apps were, the entrees fell a bit short.  Definitely good, just not TREMENDOUSLY GREAT like the rest.  

So next time you're feeling blue, come to azul, get a little sauced, load up on starters, and leave with a smile!"}
{"text":"I had a great birthday lunch there yesterday.  Food, service and ambiance was very good.  I will definitely put Azul on my best Mexican list. Large portions and great Sangria."}
{"text":"This place is refreshing. The architecture alone of the building and restaurant coupled with being a stand alone business on a residential street earn it three stars alone. Extensive Mexican beer selection. Oddly enough no beers were available on their empty taps and the bartender didn't include a lot of the beers when I asked about the selection. Chips and salsa were top tier. My entree chicken burrito was good, but not great, but my wife's pork enchilada was superb."}
{"text":"Stopped by here on a Saturday evening with the family.  The place was packed, and there was about a 20 minute wait for a table.  We ordered a variety of entrees.  I really enjoyed my chicken enchiladas.  I asked them for all three sauces (green, red, and mole).  Mole was by far my favorite.  It's one of the best mole's I've had.  Their queso dip, and guacamole were also very good.  I couldn't put my finger on what they had put in the guacamole, but it was very flavorful.  The highlight of my meal was definitely the margarita.  It was fresh, not from a mix and very strong.  Definitely one of the best Mexican places I've eaten at in the burgh."}
{"text":"Great and not too heavy mex. Best guacamole east of San Antonio. Well behaved staff is full on knowledge about the menu. Clean and casual. Well done!"}
{"text":"Only reason for the one star is because the service was decent. People talked this place up so much, what a let down!! Wasn't even real mexican food. Carnitas were sweet. Enchilada was cold rice tasted like cardboard and cold. Beans tasted as if they were out of a can. Salsa was bland. Tostada wasn't a real tostada beans should have been refried and layered on top. There was no Asada probably because they don't know how to make it. I will admit that the chips were the highlight of the meal."}
