{"text":"Beware that the transition to summer grass is slower than at other courses and the fairways are rather bare now (June 16, 2013).  Add the inability for divots to grow back and it makes the fairways pretty ugly.  They are watering like crazy, so some fairways are closed to carts.  Greens are coming in a little faster.  This north Scottsdale location was 3 degrees cooler today than my Tatum and Shea neighborhood.  Breezier too!  Nice course layout and vistas.  Short and sporty.  If you've never played here before you'll enjoy the partial fairway views from the tee boxes.  Nicely constructed and maintained.  Elevation variations typical of a north Phoenix desert course.  The greens are spongy and hold well.  Great value, but wait for the grass in 2 weeks!  Water jugs on course are emptied by 1pm, so bring water."}
{"text":"Very fun course, difficult and affordable.  They keep this course very well maintained in the winter and super fun to play in the summer.  I would recommend this course to anyone looking to have a great time :)"}
{"text":"I bought a coupon for $59 to play at Orange Tree and Legend Trail a few months ago. I basically just bought it to play at Legend Trail and get the Orange Tree round as a bonus.   First off, this course is a long drive away even from the Scottsdale Airpark area. I don't mind driving this far if the experience and or value makes up for it. This certainly wasn't the case at Legend Trail.  The driving range had minimal grass that hadn't been mowed in quite some time so it was basically like practicing out of thick rough and the balls are pretty seasoned. Then when I was practicing on the chipping green, a maintenance employee pulled the flags out that I was hitting at and started mowing right in front of me. I was a little annoyed but wasn't going to let it bother me much.  Playing my round, the course was in pretty bad shape. They probably had aerated a few weeks ago would be my guess so I can't really hold that against them.  What did annoy me though was that I was having the same issues repeatedly with maintenance staff not showing any etiquette. I had multiple greens I was hitting into from 100 yards or less and the staff would not turn off their weed whackers while I was hitting. One guy on a hole was standing 5 feet from the flag and even saw I was trying to hit and he didn't even move! There were three weed whackers going around one green while I was putting too. On another hole, I was standing over the ball to tee off and three maintenance carts drove right past me. I have never felt like such an inconvenience to staff at a golf course. I wouldn't even expect that at a course like Orange Tree.  Not sure what Shane S was referring to about management understanding customer service there. I went in the pro shop afterwards to ask for a manager and the employee informed me that he was gone for the day and asked why I needed one. When I told him I was upset about the maintenance staff, he sure couldn't have cared less. I filled out an online survey letting the course know about my experience and never heard back.  All in all, not worth the drive out there. If you want a nice golf course and don't mind spending money, go to Boulders or Grayhawk. If you want a nice course but are more price sensitive, then go to We Ko Pa. It's just as far away, almost the same price for residents, and a difference of night and day for course layout, amenities and customer service there."}
{"text":"I love legend trail and here's why.   From May-September it's $20 on GolfNow.  I can get there an hour or two before and hit balls and have the whole course to myself after 2 pm.    I love the range.   Greens at about 100 yards, 125 yards, 150 yards, 175 and 200.   It really helped my game tremendously and the range alone makes the $20 worth it.  Then you get out on the course and it's so easy, yet so easy to make difficult.   The first few times I went I was shooting around 78-80 from the 2nd to back tees.  After that I played about 5 straight rounds at this course without hitting a driver and wasn't above 73.  It's a course that you really need to think your way around.  You need to hit it straight off the tee and if you do you can put yourself in a position to score.      It helped my mid iron game a lot playing this course.  I can't' wait for next summer.   I will not play this course during the winter though.  If i'm paying $100+ to play 18 holes I need to be able to hit the driver in some spots.  Hitting Driver at this course will make you go through a lot of golf balls.  Great course.  Lots of fun."}
{"text":"Pretty tight layout but interesting. Don't need a driver on every hole that's for sure. Plan your way around to shoot a low number. The course was in pretty rough shape (May 5th is when I played). One of the sand traps actually had some sort of burlap mesh showing through that is just waiting for someone to shatter a wrist on. They need to fill the traps with real sand for sure. And the driving range was beat, no grass to hit off of and the balls were in pretty rough shape. The greens were bumpy yet rolled a good speed, they didn't hold a ball at all though. When this is in the peak winter shape it looks like a fun course but I always though the greensfee's  were a bit steep. I wish I got a discount, I live a few feet from the clubhouse."}
{"text":"Great course, Fair to all abilities and in great condition. Only bad thing is the kitchen closes at 4"}
{"text":"The course  was in good shape  . The pace of play was 4hours. The Marshall was constantly  che:king on us. The greens  were  fast and in good shape. The course is very challenging  with forced carries. I do like the course"}
{"text":"A very enjoyable desert course.  We had a fun here.  The ranger and cart girl were nice! The layout was excellent with the desert in play on every hole.  Being from back east, I got a rush trying to blast the ball out of trouble.  Of course, I failed miserably but who cares? The back 9 had more memorable holes than did the front 9.  All par 3s were interesting and challenging.  A few long forced carries over waste areas.  The course was green and lush when we played in mid October.  The only downer was a miserable woman swearing at my friend for driving his cart onto the fairway.  Bleep you if you read this review, sweetheart.  Overall, a must play for those wanting a good value on a course with a private feel."}
{"text":"For the price, you can't beat this place during the winter.  $75 (after tax, including range balls) during January, when everybody else in the area is charging $200?  Yes, please!  Everything was in great condition.  Greens rolled fast and true, and dead spots were nonexistent.  It's not the most interesting track, but it's got enough variety to keep it fun.  Really loved the back nine, particularly #11, #14, and #15."}
{"text":"I am an 8 hdcp and have been playing golf in the Valley for more than 25 years - been to Legend Trail before but after this past Sunday - NEVER AGAIN!  We teed off at 8:15 behind 2 twosomes and a threesome.  Of course they ask you to keep up with the group ahead and we tried our best.  This is one of the more typical 'desert' courses where if you get it going a little crooked off the tee you find yourself fending of snakes and thorny bushes in search of your ball.  After losing the group in front of us on #4 (The #1 hdcp hole par 5) after 2 in our group found the dirt - we didn't ever quite catch up.  We were met on the 9th green by the ranger who was asking us to skip 10 because we had fallen behind the threesome and 2 twosomes in front of us - DESPITE our 9 hole turn at 2hr and 2 min!!!  We objected - they didn't care - they moved us to 11... where we waited, then 12... where we waited again - This time I called the golf shop and spoke with a the most UNPROFESSIONAL 'Head Pro' James NaPier.  After STRONGLY voicing my (our) continued displeasure, Jimmy offered an ultimatum 'Come of the course and get a raincheck - or finish our round' (Like we were ever coming back!) - I told Jimmy if we waited again, I would be calling back.  We got to 13... WAITED AGAIN - so, just like I said, I called back! Jimmy thought a proper customer service move was to tell me \"Now you know what it feels like to wait!\" THEN HUNG UP ON ME!  Here's where it gets really interesting!!!  After finishing #18 - the ranger met us again and escorted us to #10 where we were inserted in front of another group to play #10 and cause undo delay to anyone starting the back side around noon!  Really?!?!  What the hell is going on here!?!?!  Obviously NEVER AGAIN - but fair warning to any that intend to play here - be sure to put heavy priority on speed rather than the enjoyment of a pretty decent track.  Also - fair warning to anyone willing to risk their reputation on hiring one James NaPier... he could use a solid 6-8 week course on Customer Service!"}
{"text":"I have played this course numerous times, and when it is in good shape, it is a spectacular course to play. Yet, when I experienced my last play over the weekend, my views are starting to change. We booked our rate through the website, and when we go to the course we were told the greens had been punched. In most cases the website would warn us this is going on, but not here. I felt like I was sold a bill of goods.  The other issue is one I have experienced a few times playing here, and that's the ranger speeding you up for no reason. This weekend we were on pace consistently for a little over 4hr round (4.5 hrs is pace). The group ahead of us was blowing through the course, and because of the gap, the ranger kept coming up to us to tell us to \"pick it up\". Each time he was more and more adamant. The stress of trying to speed up, along with crappy greens we were not made aware of, I don't know if I'll be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Played here for the first time yesterday.  Staff was very friendly and accommodating.  Course is challenging, yet fair.  Front nine a bit easier than the back, which has more carry over the desert from some of the tee boxes, plus back-to-back par 5s, (#16 and #17).  Course is in very good shape and we played in about four hours.  Paid $49 + tax with range balls included, a good deal in my book.  Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Pretty solid track at a really good price.....great practice facility (I would go just for this). It is a bit of a drive from the center of town....  Arrived 1/2 hour before our tee time and the guys working bag drop and the club house were GREAT. They were able to re spike my shoes (a bit pricey at $20) before the round while we warmed-up on the excellent range.  Played from the silver tees at 6400 yards and it was a bit challenging, shot 86, but very playable.  Not a tradition desert course because there must be at least a million homes surrounding the course...and it doesn't feel like you are out in the desert, and limits the views of the mountains.  But it is spectacularly maintained, tee boxes, fairways and greens were all in GREAT SHAPE. Only down side is that it is a bit unimaginative with not much variety through the holes.  I will say the pro shop is very nice, dogs at the turn were EXCEPTIONAL, and it was a lovely experience.  A bit of a drive back to the airport (45 minutes), but I would return to play when back in the Valley.  Total - $150.00 (for two of us)"}
{"text":"DO NOT PLAY HERE!! I REPEAT....DO NOT PLAY HERE!  My friends and I play golf every weekend in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area and have for over 20 years. I also worked at a country club as a teenager, so I know a few things about golf course policy and etiquette. NEVER have I had an experience like we did last weekend at Legend Trail. We had a foursome with a tee time of 8:15. After receiving a 5 minute dissertation on how to play golf from the starter, we started our round 5 minutes late.  We played behind a threesome, who was behind a twosome. Throughout the first 9 we were told constantly that we were behind pace and the group behind us was waiting. On one hole that was accurate, but for the other 8 holes that group NEVER waited. We finished 9 holes in 2 hours and 2 minutes (not fast, but average pace) and were greeted AGAIN by the Marshall who told us we were so far behind that they we had to skip 10 and go straight to 11. WHAT?!? We pleaded with the Marshall explaining that we just finished the front at an average pace. He explained that they don't measure pace by time, rather they are only concerned about keeping up with the group in front (remember the group in front of us was a threesome playing behind a twosome). SO...we skipped 10 and went to 11, where the THREESOME WAS STILL ON THE TEE BOX. We waited. We then waited again on 12 as the two some teed off. At this point we called the golf shop and spoke with James Napier who was extremely rude and unprofessional. After waiting on 11 and 12, we waited again on 13 as the group in front teed off. We called the shop again and James Napier said \"Now you know how it feels to wait\" and hung up the phone. Not sure how this guy has a job as a golf pro. Shame on him and the staff that made this ridiculous mistake. THIS IS THE POOREST MANAGEMENT OF A GOLF COURSE I HAVE EVER EXPERIENCED!"}
{"text":"Great spot to golf. The course and staff were awesome!  Their green fees are very reasonable and the course is in nice shape.  Wow...did I mention the views? They are pretty awesome!!   A bit cooler climate over other courses closer to downtown Phoenix/Scottsdale.    This course can be a bit of a challenge if your a beginner golfer.  While there are many choices around the area...this one is a top choice for us!  They also have a small bar/restaurant called the Cantina offering breakfast and lunch (I think they close at 3pm).   Good nachos, burgers and fish & chips!  ?"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I'm sure this course is a fantastic one, and I don't want to take away from that at all.   However, I do want to say that Kevin and Andy in the pro shop, are two of the most unprofessional people I have ever come across in this industry. I have played a lot of golf in my life and being from Southern California, I have seen some great courses and met some odd people. These two are by far the worst and if you are looking for an experience where people welcome you to their course, this is not the one.   I guess in a way, this course is legendary; I'll never forget the way Andy and Kevin treated our group. I'll also never return. Hope this course finds some new staff."}
{"text":"I love Legend Trail for a lot of reasons.  It starts at the top with management.  They always have it together and they understand customer service.  You can always expect to get treated with respect from everyone there.  The practice facility is really great.  There is a large short game area with four greens and a really nice driving range.  Practice balls are always included so be sure to show up early.  As many people have mentioned, the course isn't all that tough, but if you don't play smart, it can eat your lunch in some areas.    Also, if you play as a single, there are a lot of members and regulars that play here.  It's always been a delightful experience when getting paired up at Legend Trail."}
{"text":"Very nice golf course. Good driving range and very friendly staff."}
{"text":"Played this course yesterday. The man at the golf shop could have been nicer but the rest of the staff were awesome. Met 3 ppl that were residents and they helped me with their local knowledge which was a plus.  The course itself was In good condition. The first few greens were ok but the rest were so much better. The fairways were well manicured and some were very tight...very nice. If you're not too accurate with your driver, I suggest clubbing down. Lots of houses. The bunkers were in good shape, thank god I didn't hit but a few . The range could have been better and maybe it was time for some new practice balls...at least it came with the greens fee.  Some very nice scenery, not much water but challenging course nonetheless. We had the unfortunate luck of playing behind a very slow group and we waited from the 3rd hole to the 8th where they finally let us go through. When we were in the way to the 10th green, the ranger thought it was us and that \"we\" were 3 holes behind in pace. 3 holes..!!!  We corrected the ranger's error.  After that, we pretty much breezed through the course and had a more enjoyable time.  I would play this course again for sure. Booked via golf now and paid $45."}
{"text":"Overall, Legend Trail is a very nice track.  The course is well maintained, the staff were consistently friendly and compared to some of their peers in the area, the price was quite affordable for the quality of the course.  Definitely one I'll be playing again when I'm back in the area."}
