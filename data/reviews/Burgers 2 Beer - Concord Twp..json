{"text":"Great beer selection, great side dishes, but not a great burger.  This was a disappointing experience considering the namesake of the restaurant.  I tried the Vampire burger with Mac n cheese.  The Mac was great but the burger was bland.  It didn't have enough seasoning.  The price of the burger was out of line."}
{"text":"First time at this place! Went for a date night :)
We ordered the nachos with no olives, but it came out with olives. They made a new one right away. They were ok, but nothing special about them. I would not get them again.
I ordered the burger of the month of April. It was the peanut butter peep burger! I took a risk...I've wanted to try a burger with peanut butter on it, but never thought of Peeps being in a burger. However, the burger was amazing!! It was the perfect balance of sweet and savory. It had bacon and habanero cheddar cheese. It was delicious. My fianc√© got a mushroom burger with garlic aioli sauce and they accommodated to his needs of wrapping the burger in lettuce instead of buns. He really enjoyed it. I also got a milkshake for dessert because our waiter recommended it. He said he could make special requests; it doesn't have to specifically be directly from the menu. He made me a chocolate caramel pecan crumble milkshake. Surprisingly, it wasn't overly sweet! And I loved that. 
I have to note that our waiter was exceptional. He was very enthusiastic and gave an amazing vibe, where we felt very welcome. Unfortunately, we forgot his name (sorry!!) but he was phenomenal. 
Lastly, a little hiccup at the end- We ordered some wings to go, and they were mistakenly given to someone else who had placed a to-go order. They had to remake our wings, but they came out promptly. Overall, there were a couple mistakes, but we had such a fantastic waiter that our first experience there was very nice. Kitchen was very fast, too. The atmosphere of the restaurant was comfortable and relaxing. It was not too loud. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"First time at Burgers 2  Beers and we love this place, very nice people, good food, good drinks. Serve was great. Amanda did a great job. Will come back here. Give it 5 stars."}
{"text":"We met friends here and were seated after a little bit of a wait. The waiter quickly came over and took our drink order. I got watermelon limeade and husband got raspberry iced tea. The waiter explained they make their own syrups for the drinks, so we could have them less sweet, which is appreciated. 
We ordered sloppy tots as an appetizer and our friends got the me so corny (corn fritters). Sloppy tots were awesome - nice crispy tots with nacho cheese and sloppy joe. We all cleaned the plate, we loved it. I didn't try the fritters but they looked good.
Burgers were good - both men got Vampire Hunter and they both said they were great. Another dining companion had the Krafty burger and she loved it. I had the Like Butta burger with bacon, truffle aioli, and caramelized onions. SO GOOD.  I opted for an upgraded side (Mac and cheese) and it was really good.

Everyone liked the meal, service was great, but my only complaint is the noise level. It is so loud there but it's part of life. It'll be nice in the summer when the windows can be opened.

Looking forward to returning!!"}
{"text":"This was my first time ever at this super nice sports bar in the brand new location. The interior was a lot of red and black with a sporty farmhouse kind of vibe. Sounds odd but it worked. I think they have about a dozen or so humongous flat-screen Tvs for your game viewing pleasure. Or if you're not much of a sports fan, you could just go there for it's namesake, like I did. 

The hostess and staff were very friendly and prompt. The main food menu is huge and a bit overwhelming at first, so be prepared!

My hubby and I started out with the Oh My Cod appetizer. And oh my yes they were excellent! The tasty cod strips had a parmesan and basil breading, weren't too greasy and were served with a bomb ass horseradish dipping sauce. 

I ordered a Vampire Hunter burger, with a veggie burger and no pepperoni. It was a homemade tasting burger topped with creamy garlic sauce, carmalized onions, tomatoes, smoked Gouda and cheddar cheese.  Very good! The hand cut style fries were a bit salty with a dash of rosemary. Not too soggy or greasy though. I washed it down with a Deschutes Fresh Squeezed IPA on tap. 

My hubby ordered the Beat Up burger. It was cooked well to perfection, topped with blue cheese, house made Cajun seasoning, lettuce and tomato. Really good! 

Yes, I would recommend this place and do plan on going back for a double date night!"}
{"text":"Let me first emphasize that I have no complaints regarding this location. The food, service, atmosphere, & price points were good. Some personal preferences I noted were the double grilled cheese burger I ordered could have been slightly crisper, I would order fries without seasoning, & the music was too loud. Again, only my preferences.

My 'issue', if you want to call it that, is there is nothing here that is unique; no 'wow' factor. It's really no different than two other places nearby & at least a half-dozen other places within a five mile radius. It's typical & average in comparison to everyone else who has jumped on the beer, burgers, & sports bar bandwagon.

Whether you're traveling I-90 or live in the neighborhood, it's a decent place to eat. If you're considering it as a dining destination, you'll probably pass a dozen comparable restaurants on the way.

*If you have read my review to this point, please indicate if you found it useful, cool, etc. It helps keep me motivated! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Horrible service no one on a Wednesday night there took over hour and half will not be back! Burgers are ok would rather go to Chagrin to a real burger place! Waitress spilled half my drink & never brought out waters that we asked for."}
{"text":"Was in town visiting family and came by for lunch. It's a really clean place with a nice atmosphere. It was about 60% full at lunch and surprisingly quiet, which was really nice. The menu has a lot of tasty unique choices. I had a wrap that was good. My son had a hot dog, which was tasty and super huge. All in all the group loved the food. The service was a little slow, but the manager came by to make things right for the slow service. He was a super nice and attentive guy. I would totally come back for a burger, beer and to watch a game on a weekend. There are TVs everywhere, so you'll never miss a game or a play."}
{"text":"My son and I stopped in on a Thursday night to have a boys night out get some burgers and quaff a few Ales. Well he drink a lemonade but you get it cuz he's 11. Anyway the general rule of thumb is with new restaurants I always kind of give him a break because they're still trying to figure things out even 6 months later build a clientele hire the right kitchen staff Etc.

So showing up at 6:30 on a Thursday night in the place is half empty on a beautiful patio night is a little disconcerting. And as I said before it does take awhile to build up a decent clientele. So we were asked to be seated on the patio which is fenced in with six foot boards which kind of makes you feel like although you're outside your kind of cramped into the small room which is a little weird feeling. I think they would also benefit from having maybe some live plants out there or I don't know if it's possible but a bigger lower some of the fencing so you can actually see outside even though there may not be much to see.

We were able to order our drinks and bypassed the appetizer. Our server had a trainee with her and I do understand the importance of training new people and we certainly give more leeway when it comes to that. Our issue was not necessarily with our server or the training at all but the amount of time it took to get our hamburger. Even though the place was half empty it was a good 25 minutes before our Burgers actually showed up. It should have been no more than about 12 to 15 minutes from being seated to actually have your food delivered to the table.

My food was not the warmest which led me to believe that it was either cooked and sat back there waiting for someone to bring it up or it was cooked and ignored either way I probably should have come out a whole lot faster than it did based on how busy the restaurant was. I had a turkey burger it was okay but sometimes long wait times sour the experience"}
{"text":"Service is good.  Beer selection is great.  Happy hour is worth while.  Vegetarian options."}
{"text":"Food is overpriced for the size of the servings you receive. The customer service was very slow and the waitress didn't tell us about the specials or promotions till after we ordered. Go to McDonald's!"}
{"text":"I'll give it a three with higher marks for atmosphere, location, selection and cod strip appetizer. Waitress was maybe the slowest any of us had ever had. There was 7 of us and it was painful... I don't want to list her name cause it may have just been a bad day. I had the Danny Greene which was the blandest corn beef sandwich, nothing made it flavorful. It's almost like the forgot a sauce? I could taste just the egg. Chips were perfect. Two guys didnt get there Cole slaw until meal was over. Two guys wanted deserts but gave up cause of the wait. I'll go back, plenty of reasons to go back"}
{"text":"Come to it out. New place in town. Well we waited for our buffalo chicken dip but only because they had to make a new batch. Wasn't bad but not blended together very well. Big chunks of cream cheese in it. My wrap wants bad just ok nothing to right home about. The fun part was when the kitchen staff all walked out. This happened just after we got our food. Servers went around telling everyone there was no cooks or kitchen staff. I guess the owner is not a great guy to work for since they walked out.  Not sure I'd come back. Wasn't worth it to me."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time, I'll start on the positive. Atmosphere was nice, even if the layout of tables was packed tight, the staff has to wait for other staff members to negotiate around tables. My waitress was excellent. Mgr. was happy to change channel on one of 20 plus very large TV's.
Now to the food... Over priced lots of fries ( of course fries and bread are cheap) the meat, the very heart of the burgers, was small 5 oz at best, yes yes I'm sure the little guy starts at 6 oz when he's packed at some factory. Sad peice of meat. If they sold this with a 10 oz that would be appropriate. However a second patty is 5 bucks !!  Hell the whole burger is only worth 5 bucks but what do I know with 25 years as a traveling business person who searches the midwest for the best burger joints. To add insult to injury this place charges for any change or extra sauce, gluten free bun etc. you'd like. It's not bad enough they overcharge for their subpar food they then nickel and dime you..... This owner should go back to selling Falafel and Kibby. However if you have low standards and don't understand value and are just there for the overpriced beer you'll love it, PERFECT for the under 30 Holi polloi."}
{"text":"House sitting in Concord so decided to try this place. Had to wait a little bit to be seated and for our waitress to come over. It wasn't busy. We got seated in the bar area where we quickly discovered about 8 drunk, loud bro's sitting at the bar dropping F-bombs every other word. Our waitress, Bethany, was great and the cod appetizer was yummy. Very good seasoning. I ordered the Hot Chick sandwich. The chicken was dry and I think it was supposed to come with a sauce, but that was missing. I guess my issue is that the drunk a-holes got louder and more offensive even when families with young kids came in and older couples. Would have been nice if the bartenders or management would have asked them to bring it down about 10 notches. Not sure we'll be back."}
{"text":"I used to go to the highland heights one on the regular so I was excited to hear they were opening up a B2B near where I live. The waitresses were forgetful and the cooks obviously didn't know the menu very well since everything that was cooked for myself and the people I was with came out half cooked or nearly completely wrong. Asked for a well done Billy burger.I ended up with a med-rare(pink and a little bloody) burger with no pretzel bun. Some friends of mine got the Oh,Cheesus and the cheese wasn't even melted. Also,the B2B BBQ sauce was clearly watered down. This place really needs to get better waiting staff,bartenders who know their craft and cooks who can follow a menu. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Most people don't have 2 hours for lunch...

I have been to this place twice and two opposite experiences. The first experience was a weekday lunch where the food was pretty good and the service was adequate as well as there was hardly anyone there.

Today I went with my mom for lunch. The place was not even half full. Our hostess seated us inside at a booth and explained that our server would be over in a bit as she was tending to a large table on the patio. Hostess then took our drink order and when she brought them back went ahead and took our lunch order. Everything is fine up to this point. Then we waited and waited and waited for our food until we finally could not wait anymore. Over 45 minutes waiting on 2 burgers is kind of ridiculous for a burger place that wasn't that busy. 

Also, don't tell customers that the food is taking a long time because of the large table on the patio as it makes it seem like their food is a priority. 

We told the hostess we had to leave and left $5 on the table for the iced tea and water."}
{"text":"The Concord Burgers to Beer NEEDS A NEW MANAGER IMMEDIATELY! Mike is his name and he is a total and complete incompetent, slithrery, rude and apparently a pathological liar. I ordered take out online and that went smoothly. I go to pick up my order to find out they were out of the rib rub I ordered. Ok I'm a grown up and I can deal. I pick another,  sorry we are out of that, ok, I chuckle and pick another and bingo. About 10 mins later Mike comes up with my order. I asked is everything here? Yes, he replies, in an impatient manner.  Well, I get home and no ribs or pretzel order are included. I call, the hostess gets Mike on the phone and he proceeds to tell me he packed it himself, he knows they are there and he doesn't know what to tell me and that I shouldn't get defensive. What???? Are you calling me a liar? I said I will never ever be back and that his customer service skills are deplorable.  Now my husband is pissed!!!! He calls and Mike slithered to the phone and proceeded to berate my husband and wait for it.....said the ribs and pretzel order were still there and that he screwed up. Wait, I thought he packed it himself. So he can't stop there, he tells my husband that he offered for me to come get another order!!! No you didn't, you implied I was lying and that I had the food. No apology, just him yelling and swearing at my husband. He is a liability to the reputation of that new business in Concord. We were so excited about having a new place in our area! Mike, I hope you read this, I hope the owners read this and kick your lying, hostile, incompetent butt to the trash where you belong. I'm sure your Mom is patting herself on the back for raising such a fine young man!"}
{"text":"I went back last night, much better than the first visit. Although they should make an effort to seat people faster, or at least be greeted as they come in. Our service once seated was good, food pretty good. I tried the vampire hunter this time, fries could be crisper. But burger was cooked to temp and I appreciate it is 100% grass fed and all that."}
{"text":"Cool place good food however dear mgr:  columbis bodhi, an 8.5 abv bee, is NOT served in a ten ounce brandy sniffer.  Having ordered this a hundres times, including at columbus brew pub in columbus, this is served in a pint glass.  Dont charge me pint price and serve in a ten."}
