{"text":"I'm giving this 2 stars instead of one only because the food was at least hot. Service was awful. Ordered at 6:27, and it didn't arrive until 8:06. They are 1-2 miles from my house. When the delivery man arrived, he didn't say a word, just handed me the food and walked away. We won't be ordering from then again."}
{"text":"The best pepperoni rolls ever. Ask for ranch and Marinara to dip them in. People are friendly too"}
{"text":"Under new owners ... Pizza good!!! Service is terrible. The girl behind the counter is very rude... They forgot my tomatoes on my gyro .. And when i told her she proceeded to had me a slice in my hand .... They also wouldn't take my coupon they sent me because she didn't know how to use the computer ! Inside doesn't look very clean either .... Not a happy customer"}
{"text":"I know the foods actually are good.But I still have to say,you really forgot my pepsi!!!!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy getting the extra large pizza w/ the 12 hot wings & a 2liter of soda for $24. You can't bet the taste, price and the ppl. are nice too. I've never had a bad experience here. 5 stars!"}
{"text":"The best in the area. Tried them all. The dough and sauce are great. Mandy's and Maisies got nothing on this place. If you're looking for 5 star pizza you'll have to go to Piccolo Forno in Lawerenceville or Wingharts in Market Square. Good luck an d good eats!"}
{"text":"Buffalo wings and two gyros (one with no tomatoes)!!  This place is awesome! I tried  the same order from five different places and their's was and still is the best.  Great prices, delicious food, quick service, and friendly smiles."}
{"text":"DO NOT ORDER GYROS FROM HERE!!! Old meat, when I called they wouldn't fix the problem and were rude. Worst ordering experience I've had in Pittsburgh...avoid at all costs"}
{"text":"Since new ownership took over, the food is actually better. The hot wings were great this time around and tossed in the sauce as opposed to having it drizzled over the wings. A great place that's even better now. Always friendly, always delicious."}
{"text":"I ordered a fettuccine alfredo with chicken from Pizza La Bella last week. The sauce was awesome, pasta was cooked fairly well, but it was the chicken that was an issue. They cut it up leaving the tough tendon in the pieces, which meant I bit into it and it was hard and un-chewable. I will probably give them another shot, because it is primarily a pizza joint so maybe that is better, but I was very disappointed with my experience.

**I'm editing this 11/14/14 to say that the owner did contact me to try and make it right with a free meal. Due to a diet change, I don't eat that stuff anymore, and will not be giving them another shot in the near future- but they did try to make it right, which says a lot. Most places don't take that initiative, so I'll give credit where credit is due."}
{"text":"Ordered the Spinach and feta rolls, I was looking for a lenten alternative, it was very clean on the inside, friendly staff and the rolls were pretty tasty!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place pizza delivery fast owner is so friendly pizza is delicious and so cheap"}
