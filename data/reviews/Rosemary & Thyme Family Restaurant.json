{"text":"Decor: Odd. Outdated. Clean though if you strive to find a positive.

Starter: Soup for the starter is the only reason this place got a two star rating. 

Service: Waitress is cold. Akward. 

Main meal: Can i get a steak in my oil? The food on the plate tasted like oil.  

Overall: Stay home and save your cash and tastebuds from a lofty blow."}
{"text":"Really great place to have breakfast on a Sunday morning as long as you get there early and avoid the line. Good old fashioned food, service and atmosphere. The breakfast special is the best."}
{"text":"We visited after our daughter's dance show so we had a large group at 1pm on a Saturday. They had great space, were really kind to our loud 2 yr old and served us quickly. We all ordered breakfast food cause that's what we read was excellent and we weren't disappointed. Great greasy spoon restaurant if you're looking for home casual comfort, which was perfect for our family."}
{"text":"Other than waiting for the seating everything else is always great! The staff is friendly. Portions are good. We always pop in for breakfast and always leave happy. I wish they were open in the evening like back in the days...If you're in the area, make sure to go grab a bite. You can't go wrong with any item on the menu."}
{"text":"Best breakfast in Toronto. The food at this place is outstanding. The portions are huge and everything is fresh. I love places like this where you get more than what you pay for.  LOVE THIS PLACE!"}
{"text":"Had the \"Early Bird Special\" .
Eggs were perfect. Lots of bacon (5 pieces), that was also cooked perfectly. 
Potatoes were ok, I'd say average. Tasty, but more on the mash / chopped side, which lends itself to be more like mashed. They weren't crispy, but, we're still tasty.
Coffee was hot and a bit above average.
My wife commented that the water for her tea was hot, which if you're a tea drinker, you know is essential. Most places it is not hit enough.

Will be back."}
{"text":"Basic family restaurant with lots of regulars, a good sign.  As far as the food goes, I've only been here for breakfast but their portions are big enough to share so the price ends up being quite inexpensive per person.  I am a big fan of their peameal bacon.  One thing is that if you substitute your potatoes for tomatoes, no charge, if you want said tomatoes grilled....extra charge.....a little nutty!

Great place with good basics."}
{"text":"I have come here a few times.  The food is average.  I like the waitresses and the place is clean."}
{"text":"Our favorite breakfast place. I'm all about supporting mom and pop's type businesses and this place is a gem. I love their early bird special. Best bacon out there; ask for extra crispy bacon and it's even better. Their prices are fair, the ambience is cozy and inviting, and the servers are so lovely. I love the servers there! They know my husband and I since we're regulars and they always make a point of saying hello to us. The place is usually busy, so expect to wait for a table, but it's not very long and well worth the wait. Oh, and they have really yummy pancakes and French Toast too!"}
{"text":"We usually go here for breakfast after a late night. The food is okay, and most of us usually go for the breakfast special which is about 7 bucks plus tax. One thing I noted, is that the average bill usually comes around 15-20$ after the coffee and a side order. One thing I despise is water served in plastic cups, the ones you see in Dominican or Cuba all inclusive resorts. Just ruins the taste of the water. Also tried the chicken souvlaki on a pita, pretty good, lots of onion and garlic tho, and it seems it's just chicken strips on the grill, not the authentic \"souvlaki\". I like it, comes with a salad too. On Sunday mornings there are lineups sometimes, so be warned."}
{"text":"Used to constantly go here, but a month later, they seem to run out of everything. The wait time would be quite long considering there were several empty seats. Used to have a larger menu but now it's down to a few decent dishes. Was here with my friend, ordered a salad so we could share, was just a plate of lettuce with dressing on top, had to ask them to put tomato and cucumbers on it. Tomatoes were large tomatoes cut into big slices. Ordered a steak with shrimp, was just a piece of steak and two pieces of shrimp on top. Steak was stale, didn't taste fresh at all. Was over cooked even though I asked for medium rare. Vegetables seemed cooked but were over cooked to the point where they could get mashed when you use your fork. Overall this was the most disappointing experience ever."}
{"text":"We happened upon this restaurant yesterday, after discovering that the plaza no longer housed a fish & chip shop I remembered.  It was bustling  at 1:00, and as soon as we were seated, our waitress brought two toys for our preschoolers to play with. This was hugely popular. We had a variety of breakfast items, and all were good and ample. Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"Better than Cora's. 

I was there for brunch and found that the food was delicious and the portions were very good. I had the Harvest breakfast and my girlfriend had the banquet burger. My French toast and sausages were better than ones I would have in other brunch places. My girlfriend usually eats pretty slowly, but she devoured the big burger within minutes, and she wasn't even really hungry. She said the burger could be better than Burger Priest...

We read some poor reviews about their service but I thought it was ok. We like the family ambiance of the place and the more casual service style. It wasn't too slow and the hostess was nice. I definitely would go back and I recommend people not to go for weekend brunches..only because I don't want to wait in line to get a seat..."}
{"text":"This is my weekly fix of stuffing my face full of breakfast special and cheap lunches. I feel like one of those flies on the wall that never go away. Why? The staff know my exact taste in coffee. No I don't want double double! They know my exact taste in food specials. Yes, I do dig the egg Hollandaise with everything the size of France. They ain't sticklers on the portion sizes. If you want to be like a Norm at Cheers, this is a place for you."}
{"text":"Love this place.
I love their French Toast.
And the Crispy Bacon is done well.
Continued Sucess."}
{"text":"I've only been here for breakfast, but its a great family restaurant if you're looking for comfort food.  The ambiance is very classy, and so are their foods.  The prices are very reasonable, and the staff are accommodating.  I usually order their Early Bird, or NOT SO early bird breakfast.  Their pancakes are another yummy early bird thing to order.....nonetheless a family dive you can always go to where everybody knows your name...like CHEERS..."}
{"text":"I live very close by in the area and have known about this place for quite some time... Managed to stop by this morning for brunch and it was not what I expected.  For some reason, the exterior of the Van Horne plaza is pretty off-putting, but the inside of this restaurant is very homey.  My friend and I got the early bird and it was pretty good!  The scrambled eggs were done very well along with the rest of the potatoes, toast, sausage/ham.  Will come back again in the future!"}
{"text":"Don't go to any of the franchised breakfast places and come here instead. Your stomach, wallet and community with thank you! This small restaurant is located in the inner corner of a strip mall that looks very abandoned on early mornings. This will be the busiest little corner.

I got here on a Saturday morning at 930 and grabbed one of the last open tables. And from that moment on, there was a steady line of waiting patrons for breakfast. The staff is friendly but efficient, the food is great and I love the family-run vibe that is harder to come-by these days. The prices are decent for what you get, and they deliver on the usual breakfast choices without any issues. Will remember this place for breakfast in the future!"}
{"text":"Small place and service was alright. There was a line up at the door with a room full of staff but no one acknowledges you at first. After standing there for 10 mins, more people start showing up and finally starts to seat everyone.

First time at this family restaurant for breakfast. I got the \"early bird\" which came with 3 eggs, sausage or bacon or ham and served with home fries, toast and a coffee. Food was good nothing over the top. Typical breakfast food. Our server was great, very nice and kept checking up on us. They kept up with the coffee refills so that was nice."}
{"text":"Finally tried the Oreo pancakes. It would not be my first choice of breakfast type food (maybe for my son).  I will stick to classic breakfast and unlimited coffee! Yum"}
{"text":"This cute little place is really nearby my house and they have a lot of nice comfort food here.  I've only ever gone here for brunch and their portions are definitely big enough to share.  You can add little things (ie: side of peameal), etc.  The food is especially comforting when you have had a hangover the night before...

The decor is A-OK - very average - could probably use some updating.  The waitresses are all very sweet and polite.  Some are more accommodating than others.  One of them had let me upgrade (at an extra cost) from ham to peameal bacon whereas another told me that I had to order a side and I still had to deal with the piece of ham which I didn't end up eating.  

Good food - not for everyday but if you want a nice cheap satisfying (high calorie) comforting breakfast.  It's good once in a while definitely and really much better than those main-stream brunch places."}
{"text":"They have a great and generous breakfast.

And their eggs benedict are one of the best i've had.

It's a great place for the regulars. Been there at least 50 times."}
{"text":"The food here used to be decent & the portions generous. I'm not sure when exactly it changed. But I ate here last night with my mom-in-law & hubby. It was not good at all. Firstly the portions were skimpy & secondly it seemed the food was made in a hurry, without any pride in the craft of cooking. It didn't taste the freshest either. I won't come back again."}
{"text":"When I first found this place, We were just driving around looking for a new place to eat. We came across this place hidden away in a small corner of the plaza. To our great surprise it had a very friendly \"family diner\" atmosphere. On top of that, it had an all day breakfast section of the menu that I just can't get enough of. 

In short, the prices are very reasonable, the location and staff are super friendly. Needless to say, I have gone there quite a few times and plan on going again."}
{"text":"I met up with some friends for brunch and when we arrived here i was a bit surprised--amidst all the ethnic food in Scarborough, there is actually a very american family diner. The decor is perfectly dated and the food is classic. All day breakfast for about $10 gets you ample amount of eggs (3!) peameal bacon (3 giant slices) and home fries. I couldn't finish. The coffee is nonstop and the service is fantastic. One of my friends said she's been coming here with her family since she was little. How cute and cozy is that?"}
{"text":"Skip this place!!! Neither the food or the service worth going there.

I'll keep it short and straight to the point.  I came for breakfast and ordered the following: Corned beef breakfast with tea, I asked the eggs to be over medium and to substitute home fries with tomatoes. 

As soon as I got the plate I noticed that they forgot the tomatoes, so far, not a big deal.  I pointed out the mistake and within a minute or two I got my plate back with 4 slices of tomatoes.  The eggs were over easy and not over medium as I asked, the corned beef was salty, greasy and loaded with sodium, It's one of the rare times were I didn't finished the meat that was on my plate because it tasted so bad.

After I finished the meal I asked for additional slices of bread, the waitress asked me if I want brown bread like before and I said yes.  the yes didn't seems to matter because I got white bread instead.. I didn't make a big deal out of it because I didn't want to stay there any longer.  

Water refill for my tea was given only after asking specifically, they don't seems to walk around often to offer top-up.  At the end I was also charged extra for the tea despite the fact that their menu says \"free coffee and tea with every breakfast\", I asked the waitress why I was changed extra and she replied \"oh, this was an herbal tea it cost extra...\" It wasn't herbal tea it was Earl Grey tea, and last time I checked  Earl Grey  is not herbal but it didn't matter, they charge extra for that!!!

At the end of the day, this is the impression I got:  They can't get orders right, the food is oily and they charge extra for no reason.. 

 I am not going there again!!!"}
{"text":"Definitely one of my favourite breakfast places! The portions & options are fantastic, it's got a family-vibe, the food tastes great, and the staff are wonderful. I've been coming here for years and have never had a bad experience.
I love that they have the \"usual\" breakfast option (eggs, homefries, coffee, toast) WITHOUT the meat! I'm vegetarian, and most places I go, I have to ask for no meat.. but the cost is the same, and some places (I.e. coras..) won't even let me substitute. 
10/10 would come back and recommend!!"}
{"text":"Nice place for breakfast and brunch. Friendly staff and a local's place. Inside a neighbourhood   plaza"}
