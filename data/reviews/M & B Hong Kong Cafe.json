{"text":"*Food OK la!
*Service here OK!
*Cold HK milk tea here, very bad!
*Price not too high but I can get more better at other HK style restaurant!
*Don't request a take out box, it's cost $0.5 each ( whole sale price for it not more than $0.1?why they earn this money!"}
{"text":"The restaurant has gotten new ownership a few months ago, and as a result much of the menu has changed. Unlike most HK cafe restaurants, most of the \"western\" influenced chinese lunches such as baked pork chop and rice are no longer present. Instead there are a lot of items that you would normally find in Chinese fast food, and less prominently at other HK style cafes. The closest thing to \"western\" style chinese food here is french toast, fried chicken and fries etc. which is really very disappointing for a HK style cafe.However, according to the owner, he said he intended to change the menu  soon, since he's not allowed to have an overlap of dishes with the Chinese restaurant in the same plaza, so I hope to see some positive changes. Food wise, items came out pretty slow, even though the restaurant was not busy. Food quality is ok, but nothing beyond typical chinese fast food, and leans towards the salty side. Overall, the restaurant is more of a 2.5 at best, but I will give them that extra .5 star due to the understandable struggles of ownership transition as well as free wifi and friendly service."}
{"text":"Everything is just so-so about this place.  Ok menu selection, ok food, tolerable service, and ok price.  Ok to go if you are in the area and need a quick bite.  

I did notice quite a few people come to get take-outs; perhaps this is their strength?"}
