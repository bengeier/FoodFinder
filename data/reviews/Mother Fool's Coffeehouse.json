{"text":"A laidback, unassuming little coffee shop where you can plop down on a couch with a book. Lo-fi Willy Street ambiance, decent vegan selection at the counter if you're of that persuasion. As a tea drinker I'd have liked some loose tea offerings, but the bagged stuff was more than decent. I spent many a happy afternoon here. Live music on Friday and Saturday nights."}
{"text":"I've gone to Mother Fool's more than any other coffee place on the east side, mainly because they're one of the few that stays open to 11 pm. (RIP, Escape Java Joint!) It's not exactly my cup of tea, no pun intended, but definitely comfortable and friendly enough. Some of the critical comments below are just plain asinine: MF's prices are no higher than any other coffee shop around, and I think every business has the right to toss a freeloader who comes in, uses the Internet, and doesn't buy anything. (WTF?) True, the Wi-Fi service is a little spotty at times, but it's never been more than a minor annoyance for me. In short, this place is authentic, independent, idealistic, and welcoming, and the drinks are good, and you could do a lot worse than all that."}
{"text":"ATMOSPHERE:  Music is usually grunge or alternative, can make some people uncomfortable.  I'd also say it's too loud to be able to study or read anything that needs a lot of attention.  Tables are small but there is a back room that has comfy couches/chairs and is a wee bit quieter.  Definitely has the feel of a certain crowd. COFFEE:  Great coffee drinks.  They also don't make you pay extra to substitute soy for milk, which is unique.  They are very pro-vegan. FOOD/BAKERY: Their bakery is almost exclusively vegan with the exception of their cream cheese.  The cookies are amazing, I'd suggest the chocolate walnut cookie.  Good value, filling. PRICE:  Good prices, especially for those avoiding milk.  Lattes will run you about $3.50 even with soy (good deal) and bakery items are all about $2.  Very good value for the price.  Overall, I say this is a great coffee shop but a bit intimidating for the usual crowd.  Most staff is semi-friendly but the place is a bit \"loud\" for me and my friends agree.  However, if you want to rock out to some Foo Fighters or Nirvana while reading The Isthmus and you want to make some eco-friendly choices, this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Now that there's a real alterra in town there is no need to go to this cash only hippie hole!  I'm only rating the place based on its hipster vibe and overpriced espresso drinks and an extra 1.19 or something ridiculous for an extra shot, kudos to them for serving alterra coffee but the only reason I keep going back to this place is because I live right nearby."}
{"text":"Mother Fool's hits a lot of marks for me:  They offer soy milk at no extra charge. Their bakery goods are vegan (and delicious). they offer 10% off with Bicycle Benefits. The atmosphere is cozy and welcoming.   The only disappointment I've had was a soup (sourced from the Green Owl), but Mother Fool's really isn't a lunch destination for me. It's a mid-day or evening spot for when I have a hankering for hot chocolate and the newspaper someplace other than home. The peanut butter cookie with chocolate chips is a great idea if you want to have just a little more chocolate with your chocolate.  A note about that hot chocolate: it comes in a tall glass of the sort usually used for water or lemonade. They pour hot milk in and then add squirts of chocolate syrup. It's delicious, but it's a bird of a different feather from your standard cafe hot chocolate. It's not too sweet, not too chocolatey, but instead very milk forward. I was thrown off at first, but once I wrapped my head around the fact that I was drinking milk with chocolate in it rather than chocolate with milk in it, I liked it.   The mochas are made in a similar style. My drink last night came in that same tall drinking glass with lots of milk, chocolate syrup, and a shot of espresso. Perhaps because of the volume of the glass, the espresso flavor wasn't very present. We added another shot of espresso to it, and it was much more of a mocha. In the future, I'll ask for two shots when I order.   Finally, the fougasse are delicious. Made by Batch Bakehouse, they're chewy and savory and just the sort of thing I want to take home, warm, and eat with a big bowl of steamy tomato soup. And indeed, I have."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place eight million stars. I would come here a couple times a week for hours at a time to read. The baked goods, coffee, and soup are all delicious. The baristas are all really sweet. I love the mismatched furniture and ever-changing artwork. Also a really intimate music venue. I moved back to Chicago last year and I think MF's is definitely in my top 5 most-missed Madison things."}
{"text":"$3.10 for a 12 oz iced coffee!! I want to support a beloved local landmark, but can't afford to do so anymore."}
{"text":"The only thing good here is the overpriced baked goods that they get from someplace else. The wanna-be pretentious staff are extremely rude (we stayed long enough to see 3 different rude employees) and it isn't even a TRUE coffee shop. A TRUE coffee shop has the following: good aura (its small, smells weird in the back, and doesn't have enough seats, the only table that is comfortable is reserved for huge groups), lets you sit and study once you buy a drink (all they care about is getting your money, they don't want you to sit and enjoy the environment, they just want you to buy coffee and leave, they are not welcoming to those costumers that stay), and friendly staff (nope). Go someplace better! Barriques, Michealangelos, and Fair Trade Coffee! Trust me! Don't be Fooled by Mother Fool's \"hipster\" appeal. Tis nothing but sick, overpriced coffee and snobs in a smelly room. Word of advice Mother Fools: Make your employees shower, improve your atrocious coffee, and move out the the welcoming Willy Street environment where you do NOT fit in."}
{"text":"This is a pretty good place. Interesting atmosphere inside. Fits nicely into the eclectic neighborhood. Talkative, friendly staff with decent Alterra coffee. The pastries are ok; all vegan. If you happen to be in the neighborhood, this is probably the best coffee shop on Willy st (neck and neck with Ground Zero). Unfortunately, there isn't really an OUTSTANDING coffee shop on Willy (weird right??). If you are looking for breakfast, however, head a couple blocks down to Lazy Jane's."}
{"text":"MotherFool's provides the best coffee in Madison, the most comfortable seating, and a great overlal atmosphere.  The baristas are all friendly, and the music is kept to a good level (complaints to the contrary on yelp are dated; the owner has cured whatever problems might have existed a couple years ago).  My only complaint is that internet connections can be spotty.  Otherwise, the food is consistently great and all vegan.  And no extra charge for soy."}
{"text":"I'm always running around, trying to find new spots to enjoy a good cup of coffee.  This happens to be one of the first cafes I checked out when I moved to madison a few months ago.    Mother Fools is a solid coffee house in the Willy St. Neighborhood.  It offers everything you'd expect from a cafe... decent coffee, tasty treats, a pleasant atmosphere.  Unfortunately for me, it's just missing a certain something that would make me a regular.  Not my first choice when I crave a cup of joe, but certainly not my last."}
{"text":"A great cafe in my old neighborhood. They serve strong Alterra coffee and have unusually friendly staff. The cold-brewed ice coffee is perfect on a warm day. Between their punch card deal and free refills, the coffee's dirt cheap. All the snacks are vegan-friendly, which means some of it is great and some are a miss (Sorry, some things are meant to have dairy in them.).  A few groups claim this as their regular business meeting spot and won't be afraid to push you around. Be warned. However, the early morning retirees are always fun. The place has few windows, so the back area feels a little on the dungeon side. Try to get a window seat near the front. Come back in on Friday or Saturday for live music."}
{"text":"Within 24 hours of each other, both my roommate and I were thrown out of this place for not buying anything.   \"This is a business,\" some tattered crypto-reactionary shrugged at me.  The problem is mother broke the promise. The promise to be a neighbor and not just a business.   Bad marketing choice and bad community choice, mother fools.  You lost my roommate, but I'm writing the review from one of your squishy couches and eating vegan dal. (Reminder: even Indians aren't vegan!).  In short: mother fools is run by a mother of all fools who likes to refuse hospitality to his neighbors."}
{"text":"I find their prices very reasonable, their coffee and teas eminently drinkable, their staff earnest and friendly, and most of their food pretty decent.  They have changed some of their seating around since the last time I was in Madison--there are more seats around the perimeter, facing walls.  I appreciate that they are trying to create more space for their customers, and I think you should appreciate that too."}
{"text":"This place is a wonderful hipster/grunge scene, filled with sexy slouchy punks and artists.  The art is wonderful (both inside and on the graffiti wall)  and the food is, as previously noted, veganese. The chairs are comfy and well situated. My favorite items are definitely the coffee, the sugar free chai (with some real spice!) and the baked goods.   Come here to sketch, feel poetic, listen to the small shows on the stage or sit outside and watch the graffiti go up.  Do not try to make this your home if you routinely bacon/clorox everything in your general vicinity."}
{"text":"This is my favorite shop in Madison. I've been coming here for about 10 years and love the feel of it. It is as close as I could come to a favorite coffee shop since I left the neighborhood I grew up in, in Minneapolis.  Beautiful artwork, mosaics, colors galore. Nice music, great staff, and love the murals outside."}
{"text":"I love the coffee, atmosphere, staff and colorful decor. We need more independent coffeeshops like this!!! The vegan pastries are also delicious. :)"}
{"text":"Stopped here recently because I wanted to support Willy Street amid all the construction. The girl behind the counter treated us like we weren't cool enough to be there. I felt like an outsider instead of welcomed, very discouraging when I was trying to patronize a local business in the middle of a tough time for the street as a whole. I definitely will not be going back."}
{"text":"I would have rated today's lunch spot 5 stars if there were a few more options, but my lentil soup (from Green Owl Cafe) was delicious, although Vanessa didn't seem to enjoy her Miso soup w/ tofu and carrots quite as much as I did mine.   The atmosphere and attentive service were delightful. I'm glad I didn't pay attention to my Google Maps copilot last night and discovered Mother Fool's Coffeehouse and this lovely neighborhood.  The vegan hot chocolate was just right for this snow covered day in Madison."}
{"text":"Pretty cute coffee house that's relatively close to my house. Though to me it has nothing on the coffee place that I had reviewed about before this. But still pretty good.   Walked into the cute, little, yet busy coffee house, and the barista was ready to take our order right when we walked in.  This was the first time here for all of us, so we took a few to check out the menu (which was kind of all over the place, Had about three chalk boards with menu items, then another sign in the back with just flavors, as well as menu items on the cash register.)  My roommates got a regular black coffee, and the other a double shot Pumpkin Spice Latte. I on the other had wanted something more soothing rather than something was going to keep me up since we went there around 8:30 in the evening. So I opted for the Hot Apple Cider...it was good. Nothing special, it was store bought cider out of a jug that they warm up. But it did what I was intending it on doing, soothed, and warmed me up!   I'll probably give this place another shot, and try some other things on the menu.  **They Do Not accept cards, but they do have an ATM on site**"}
{"text":"I'm a little biased maybe, because when my fiancée and I just began going out we spent a lot of time here, but I really like Mother Fools.   It;s a very chill place to hang out in the Willy Street neighborhood and just chat with people or get a bit of work done. I would always see people writing or doing whatever.  The furniture is all mismatched and a little ratty in some cases, but it gives the place a bit of neighborhood charm that you're not going to find at any corporate coffee shop  The actual coffee is great. I've never had a burned cup or anything like that from Mother Fools. I've never tried their soups or baked goods, but it's mostly (maybe all? I'm not sure on this point) vegan friendly.  I haven't been back in quite awhile--I'm not in Madison much anymore and I'm not much of a \"hang out at coffee shops all day\" kind of person, but this place is definitely worth checking out if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Iced coffee is cold brewed, which is great, but for some reason it's served in a paper cup. Condensation and paper don't mix and that makes for an unpleasant drink.  Peanut butter cookies are terrific. Some if their other bakery is bland. All vegan. Unfortunately, the staff is not very friendly, and that combined with the soggy coffee cup keeps me from frequenting this establishment often."}
{"text":"I'm not sure about this place. It's about as contrived a coffee place as you can get.  Cash only, art on the walls, limited seating, indie music, standard coffee selection, etc...   Not really my cup o' joe."}
{"text":"I want to like Mother Fool's, but apparently, I'm not cool enough to hang out there.  I always feel way less than hip here and therefore, don't frequent the place often.  I appreciate that they have fair trade/organic coffee, BUT, I'm not sure why they use Alterra when Just Coffee is literally down the street."}
{"text":"This tiny coffee shop is a great option for vegan treats and excellent beverages. FYI - they are cash only but do have an ATM. I have three vegan youngsters in my life who love the cookies, and a non vegan husband who got a kick out of the dinosaur cookie I bought him. They have WiFi and a comfortable atmosphere. It's an enjoyable alternative to Starbucks, and you can't go wrong buying local."}
{"text":"If you are looking to send a 1990s postcard from Las Vegas from somewhere in Madison, this is your place!  This is a cool little coffee shop on Willy Street. Enjoyed a refreshing house blended cold brew here. The coffee was a little over $3 for those trying to compare with other local prices. CASH and CHECKS only accepted here but they do have an ATM available if you need one. They also seem to have a wide selection of vegan treats if that is something you are looking for.   Really interesting seating. A few tables available and a lot of couches too. There are outlets all throughout for people looking for a place to work. I enjoyed the colorful and eclectic interior. Different sorts of lights around. Staff was really friendly. David Bowie playing while I am working which is always a plus. Overall, a good relaxing place to get a little bit of work done in the afternoon.  Edit: 11/17  This has been a long time coming. I'm changing my review from 4 to 5 stars because this has quickly become my favorite cafe on the East Side. The staff is always so friendly and patient. The music is generally excellent. It is a place where different kinds of people feel welcome. The coffee is really good. I even enjoy the desserts, and I'm not someone that looks for vegan options (love their pecan sandies).   Especially as it is getting colder outside now, if you are looking for nice cozy couch to get some reading or other work in, this is the spot."}
{"text":"I was in the area and wanted a coffee. I like to go to local places if at all possible.   It's a place you can relax at a table or sofa if you want. Very cool atmosphere that you would expect from a local liberal type coffee shop.   The server was very friendly and welcoming     I had French Roast and it was smooth and bold.  Very good choice.   I little pricey but if they give refills it would be a good choice.   Enjoy."}
{"text":"Good coffee and a dazzling collection of teas, each in a jar you can twist off to take in the aroma before you purchase. Chairs and tables are a bit wobbly but you'll never be left frantically searching for an outlet. Haven't tried the baked goods but folks seem to enjoy them."}
{"text":"Quiet and cozy place to get some work done, have a quiet conversation, or read. Employees are always friendly. Tasty pasties/cookies."}
{"text":"I live here on the Near East side and meet people here for business purposes.  Nice low-key music, accommodating staff, and free wi-fi.  Really good selection of beverages, also."}
{"text":"Still sooo in love with this place. I was able to drink my tasty hot coffee, eat a simply amazing vegan cherry chocolate muffin and get most of my final done in one sitting. The vibe here is simply wonderful and the conversations among the groups of people here is chill.  This place is the real deal with transient intellectuals roaming in and out. Drumming up conversations with locals. I would honestly open a Mother Fool's-inspired coffee house in my neighborhood... if I had the funds to start it up. Any investors? Let's talk..."}
{"text":"I often pop in at around 10:15 to enjoy a bit of late night coffee and vegan treats.  If you are not in the mood for coffee they have a nice selections of teas and cold beverages.  They have a few games that I like to take advantage of and usually the music is good.  There are some days that the music is off though, and I end up leaving shortly after I arrive only for that reason.  The staff is nice and at the time I go it's usually a quiet and peaceful place to be."}
{"text":"Love the decor and the ever-changing local art.    Hate the spotty internet (only count on it if there are less than 5 laptops open in the whole place), and the fact they serve hot 16oz drinks in water glasses - hard on the hands!  The staff are very variable in their friendliness - some are really nice, some make you feel like you aren't cool enough to be in the cafe.  Overall, I prefer Ground Zero a few blocks down the street."}
{"text":"Nice relaxing place. Would give it 5 stars except it is quite small ao when it gets busy there is no place to sit and there was only one person working and was kinda slow. The coffee is excellent, all natural. It's refreshing to not drink artificial flavours and chemicals for once :)"}
{"text":"This is my now go to neighborhood coffee house. Their coffee is truly amazing, and their staff is extremely friendly and helpful. They also have great music playing in the background and the atmosphere is always filled with interesting people. It is a great place to spend the morning with a cup of coffee and a vegan muffin while you work on your lab top. They have free wifi, and offer free refills on your coffee too. The only downside is they only accept cash/check, so put your credit card away and stop in for a wonderful coffeehouse experience!"}
{"text":"Mother Fools has a nice, comfortable atmosphere. I love that their baked goods are vegan and -- my favorite part -- they'll make the drinks with soy milk as no extra charge!"}
{"text":"Mother Fool's is a small, cozy space perfect for studying or quiet conversation. There's nothing I like more than a comfortable atmosphere and this place has that.   I found my way in here after supper. I ordered a double shot pumpkin spice latte, of course, seeing as the weather is dreary and fall is here. It was, and is, delicious as I sip it while writing this review. The barista was knowledgable about the assortment of teas, and very friendly. I gazed at their baked goods and the like, but nothing stood out tremendously. I was in a bit of a hurry though, so I didn't give them a proper chance.  I will be back to explore a bit more and to relax with a good book or a nice companion. I might even see a show here. I think the setting would be super intimate."}
{"text":"Great local spot.  Cozy.  Inviting staff.  Hot, strong coffee.  What more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"I can't believe this was the first time I've ever been to Mother Fool's! My friend suggested meeting here for coffee, and it was an excellent choice. I really liked the folk music playing and the latte I ordered was so. good. When you drink terrible office coffee all day, a well made latte tastes amazing.   The cafe is small, but doesn't feel crowded. There were quite a few people working, studying, and chatting, but there were still chairs available for new arrivals. I didn't try any of the food, but the vegan cupcakes look tempting!   Seems like a great workspace or place to meet up with friends."}
{"text":"One of my favorite coffee shops on Willy Street. Good sized spot with lots of comfy chairs and beautiful artwork hanging, which are also for sale. Tons of vegan options for dessert; their lemon bars and blueberry lemon cookies are two of my favorites. I usually get a drip coffee or their house made Kombucha. Great place to study or catch up with a friend."}
{"text":"Quintessential coffee house.  I don' even know what that word means."}
{"text":"Really cute place to come in to drink some coffee.  Totally worth coming here it's a hidden gem. My boyfriend took me here for some coffee and some desert it was really good the coffee no need of sugar.  Their cookies are amazing I like it. I saw people in their laptops when I came here."}
{"text":"After having several problems with the internet here during peak hours, I am getting a bit frustrated with Mother Fools for having a cap on the amount of users that can access their WIFI (becuase of limited capacity?). Because one of the main usages of space there is studying that utilizes the internet, I hope they do something to address this issue for my sake and theirs."}
{"text":"I like this place, but I'm working on loving it.  I still can't 100% get over the feeling that, a) Some of the staff thinks I'm not hip enough to be there, and that b)  The customers who are looking at their MacBooks are actually listening to my conversation and judging me.  Paranoid?  Yes.  But there you have it.  Anyway, I reeeeally want to love MoFo's.  I think a few more time's exposure and it'll happen.  I already love the decor (the color of the walls has such a warm tone), the paintings are always fun to look at, the fact that you can buy plant & veggie seeds there is awesome, the baked goods are vegan (I'm not vegan, but I love when places cater to crowds that are smaller than the general populace), and let's face it: The iced coffee is amazing.  Let's give it up for cold-brew processing!"}
{"text":"Showed up on a Saturday to meet a friend.  Grabbed tea and a muffin.  Pretty standard fare.  A violinist showed up and impressed the entire store with his passionate fiddling.  its really the atmosphere that makes this place, comfy seating, good music, nice lighting.  Plus they take Madison Hours - super cool."}
{"text":"I will start by saying I am very picky about my coffee shops.  Just moved to Madison recently and so far, this is one of the only coffee shops worth going to :) Awesome atmosphere and my coffee was good!  Wish I lived a little closer, would bet here frequently."}
{"text":"One of a series of reviews of places my boyfriend and I visited during our weekend trip to Madison.  We discovered this coffeeshop while meandering down Williamson Street (aka \"Willy Street\") in my car, looking for cool stuff.  We passed by Mother Fool's and I immediately commented to D. that it seemed to be where all the cool kids were.  We stopped in a bit later when we were ready for some caffeine and free Wi-Fi.  My suspicions? hopes? were confirmed: the kids were cool, the place is great.  The decor is crazy, lots of bright yellow and red and blue painted walls, the funniest paintings hung on them, and best of all, weird plastic chandeliers all lit up in a corner.  My espresso, brewed from their house blend, was delicious.  Didn't try any of the vegan sweets since I was too full from a weekend of overeating in Madison, but they sure looked good. As a wimpy, weak-toothed girl who can't stand even a sip of ice water, I died of happiness when I saw that their little water cooler had two options: \"chilled\" and \"room-temperature.\"  They even asked my boyfriend, an americano snob, how much water he wanted in his drink: filled up? Or just halfway? Just one star off for his still-not-entirely-content expression upon sipping it.  Love it."}
{"text":"I've tried to give this place so, so many chances, but I'm done. I never last more than 30 minutes. When the owner isn't there, the other baristas (one guy, in particular) blast uncomfortably loud music. Yes, I do expect there to be a relative degree of noise at a coffee shop. But, this is overwhelming and unbearable. Working in the seating area of Willy Street Coop, a grocery store, is more comfortable than this place.   I just can't be bothered anymore--especially when there are way better coffee shops with more a much better atmosphere and attentive and courteous employees in the vicinity (Ground Zero, Cargo, etc. Hell, I'd rather pay for the overpriced coffee at Johnson Public House).   Oh, they will charge you for refills before you even decide to purchase one. So, if you only plan on having one cup of coffee, let them know before paying."}
{"text":"No credit cards, yo  Soups are vegan, get an amazing fougasse to accompany it to make a filling meal.  But save room for the awesome vegan baked goods :) sooooo many choices of cookies, muffins, cupcakes- YUM!  tasty coffee  grungy hipster vibe."}
{"text":"So - I've only been here twice but both experiences have been great. First and foremost - the ambience is so great. You instantly feel comfortable, especially if you need to study or do some work. The coffeehouse allows you to just relax and focus yet appreciate the bustle of the Near East. A few things worthy of mentioning - wifi speed is pretty good, their herbal iced tea is refreshing, there is ample seating to your preference (tables, couches, loveseats, etc). I also had the lentil rice soup the other day and it was pretty decent. Did the trick!   I'll definitely be making this my to-go place as a Badger graduate student!"}
{"text":"Can I just say that I miss the Chai lattes here???  Mo-fo's is the only place I know of that uses ACTUAL tea to make these, and not that crappy syrup. I'm ruined for any other Chai experience...RUINED. Someone find me a respectable chai on the west side, please!"}
{"text":"Vegan baked goods were not quite stale, but getting there; almond milk latte was burnt. So if you're vegan, and you happen to go here on a day when the baked goods are fresh and the barista knows how to steam soy/almond milk, it might be awesome! But otherwise, try the Americano or drip coffee?  The atmosphere was lovely though. A nice place to sit and read. And the barista was friendly."}
{"text":"Mother Fool's... A Near East neighborhood classic here in Madison. I am not a regular customer, but I have been here a handful of times, and generally enjoyed it. The best part about this coffeehouse is the atmosphere... Think Berkeley, CA. Think alternative, intelligent, vegan-friendly, and cozy.   This place is a truly unique destination coffeehouse in a sea of local coffeehouses in Madison's near-Central district, many of which are nice, but don't have the same star-power.   The cafe features a lounge area at the back of the shop, with comfy chairs, although the shop is quite compact, and this area proves popular. There is a Madison Metro Bus Monitor with real-time arrival information (airport-style). Very cool.   The only thing I didn't like... We ordered some squash soup with was delicious, although, lukewarm at the time it was served. Sure, I could have popped in the microwave, but I shouldn't have to. Also, my large mocha was served in a tall glass, which was odd, and almost too hot to handle for some time. It also had what I can only describe as a burnt taste...   All in all, this place is super vegan-friendly, which is awesome, and I am assuming I came on on off-night as far as the food.AMD.drink was.concerned... I will be.back shortly to try again."}
{"text":"Love it here!!! Excellent, cheap coffee and teas!  Very relaxing and inviting!  I love the ever changing wall decorations!!!  My new coffee shop that I will be frequenting!"}
{"text":"A lovely near-East spot to hunker down for an afternoon of work. Mother Fool's has got a homey feel with mixed and matched furniture, doodles, and knick-knacks that reminds you of hanging out at your one hippie friend's house in college. The baristas have been invariably nice and I've only had one issue with the WiFi cutting in and out over the years. They offer herbal iced teas which is nice for caffeine-free folks like me. I've tried a handful of the vegan baked goods and they've been hit or miss. Some are great and some have been on the dry/crumbly side. My first visit to Mother Fool's was ten or so years ago for a concert with Hayward Williams - they turned all the furniture to face the front and it was a fun and cozy night, especially since we snagged a couch. They've got a distinct building that'll catch your eye; next time you notice it stop in!"}
{"text":"Coffee here is good, as most all specialty shops are. No credit cards accepted, which cramped my style a bit. Not much for food items, but ok. I would return for sure. Comfy seating."}
{"text":"This is a cozy neighborhood coffee shop with decent coffee (although I'm far from a connoisseur, so take that with a grain of salt). The employees and clientele are friendly and relaxed and there's a nice back room where you can get some work done.   Minus one star for the very limited, unappealing food selection. It's mostly vegan pastries that look like they'd taste like chalk."}
{"text":"Totally vegan bakery. Muffins are so-so, but the cookies (especially pecan sandy, peanut butter choc chip, double chocolate walnut) are good. Yes I've tried all the flavors.  98% of the patrons are on computers or working on their own, so it's a good place to work but not the best to socialize. Did you hear me say all-vegan bakery?!"}
{"text":"Mother Fool's has a cool, edgy, artistic vibe and is also quite cozy. Maybe it's a little bit too cozy, as the place is small and single people tend to sprawl out with laptops, hunker-down for hours and take up tables designed for two or more people.  As such, my friend and I had a hard time finding a place to sit down even though the place wasn't busy by any means.  We eventually found a table tucked in a back nook, separated from the main room. The lighting needs improvement back there, as each table has a tiny desk lamp with a mega-high-wattage CFL bulb, which are blinding in tight, confined spaces like that. Kudos for using eco-friendly CFLs, but we had to put our lamp on the floor because it was too bright at eye-level (but shutting it off would have put us in the dark).  I liked that they had loose-leaf teas. Their baked goods are all vegan and we tried their gingerbread cookie and also a cranberry scone. The cookie was decent, but nothing spectacular. The scone was oily, soft and completely under-baked, but still tasted okay, oddly enough. What I liked best were the prices: the baked goods maxed out at $2 each, with most hovering around $1.50-$1.90. That's cheap.  Nice atmosphere and nice prices at Mother Fool's. It just needs more space and better lighting. The baked goods could use a quality upgrade, but at least they're inexpensive."}
{"text":"Cold brew coffee over steam was delish, I never had anything like it. The bakery is also delish never would've guessed it's all vegan."}
{"text":"If you like vegan baked goods, you'll probably like this place. I do, for that reason and because it's a perfect place to grade papers and read.  I usually order tea and a vegan yumminess and sink in a chair - it's pretty nice.   I don't know why it took me the longest time to review this friendly joint.  I've been here more than dozen times already.   And I got a vegan cookie from them at the Capitol when I was protesting. This is just too awesome."}
{"text":"Great Colectivo coffee, a homey, welcoming aura, and interesting art are great features of this charmingly divey little coffee shop. Plenty of well used vintage mix-matched upholstered chairs and couches to settle into, as well as a fifties style dining room table and chairs to accomodate larger gatherings. I love the mosaic wall that frames the front entrance.   Vegans will appreciate the wide variety of bakery and soup offerings daily. You can even buy organic seeds for the garden here, and Colectivo coffee by the pound as well. Live music and other performances are offered frequently, a nice bonus.  Big glass front windows means great people watching opportunities while you sip your beverage, if that's your thing, something that's never boring on Willy St. You will need cash or check, they don't accept cards. Four stars for wifi that is somewhat intermittently functioning, at least the last time I tried using it."}
{"text":"This is great study spot because of the free wifi and ample outlets. The staff is always super nice and the coffee is great. A couple negatives: the cash only thing is annoying (I get why they do it though) and they frequently have events that make it hard to study. While studying for a final there, they had an art show & suddenly people were standing all around me. Someone even set their coffee down on my notebook, leaving a ring. Weird stuff. The majority of the time, though, this place rules."}
{"text":"I want to like this place. The coffee is better than most places in town, they have vegan baked goods, and it's just a few blocks from my house. If I want to chat with a friend or read a book, it's definitely a good place to go.  BUT...this is a university town, I am a student, and I need my internet access to be consistent. I'm fine with restaurants and cafes not offering internet, but Mother Fool's is just a tease. If there are more than a few people using the connection, it fizzles out and I can't use my computer. Even worse, I mentioned the problem to an employee, and she told me that internet is seen as \"a courtesy\" here, and not something they have to provide. Sure - they don't have to provide it to customers, but it seems like they get a lot of business from wi-fi users, and maybe they could get more from people like me if we knew the internet was working at all times."}
{"text":"Standard cafe with more food offerings than most on willy but cash only and limited places to pop a squat. Aaand by limited I mean unless you're solo or dos options are slight."}
{"text":"Very chill and relaxed place, with a staff to suit the mood.  They were very friendly and eager to tell me the origin of the espresso beans.  Pricing was fair, and my cappuccino was very good - hit the spot in that bone-chilling Madison climate.  My cousin got a chai latte that was delicious and not too sweet, in a good way.  Oh, and there's rad Invader from Pacman posted on the side of the wall.  Bonus points."}
{"text":"I've always liked this place- the coffee (they brew Alterra here) is the strongest around. It's like rocket fuel. I have no idea why I haven't reviewed it before, since I used to live right across the street. Doy. MF has these other things going for it, too: vegan bakery, soup from scratch, good music (including live shows!), lots of seating for internetz folks, and real-deal quirkyness. The ever-changing mural on the side of the building is really neat, too. The only tiny flaw? They lack any more substantial food choices. Even a pre-made sammy wrapped in plastic and a bag of chips would be nice..."}
{"text":"I haven't been coming here for very long, but so far I really like it.  I don't drink coffee, so I can't speak to that, but they have a decent tea selection (some loose leaf, some in bags) plus Izze sodas, which I enjoy.  They have a vegan fruit bar which is delicious and a great accompaniment to a mug of tea.   I think it has a reasonable amount of seating for the size.  I've never been unable to find a spot to sit, even though I generally need an outlet for my laptop.  I've also only had trouble connecting to the wi-fi once and when another customer told the staff she was having difficulty connecting they re-started the router for her right away.  I love that they're open late - until 11, as there aren't many places around here that are, and I've never been made to feel bad for staying for a while and enjoying my beverage."}
{"text":"I started coming to Mother Fool's because they were open late, but I've continued coming because the atmosphere is great, the staff is friendly, the pb cookies taste like my mom made them, the tea is bottomless, and the wifi is fast.  At first I liked Mother Fool's, but as I've spent more time here and uncovered more reasons to be a fan I've grown to love this place."}
{"text":"A small cozy space to spend the whole night. Too bad they don't accept any cards... Haven't tried the food yet, but would definitely like to try it in the near future!"}
{"text":"Been going to this place for years. Used to be a great place to hang out but lately it's been overcrowded, the staff has an attitude and the noise level is sometimes unbearable as the staff keeps the stereo super loud. The wi-fi connection as of late has also been hit-n-miss. They often have great local music on the weekend and I noticed the staff is much better then."}
{"text":"First impression: great location to people watch along Willy St. There's potential in this place.  The coffee was good and the staff treated me very well. The music, however, is terrible. I feel like I'm sitting in the gap. 80s pop doesn't really set the scene for one to be loner on a Sunday night. I will be back. For the sake of the place, I hope the barista is just out of touch. I'm leaving my Rolling stone behind as a gift.."}
{"text":"I thought I liked cold brew coffee from other coffee shops, but then I had Mother Fool's cold brew and now NOTHING else compares, so smooth and so strong but not bitter at all, truly a divine iced coffee experience. Mother Fool's is cash only, but conveniently has an ATM inside and is the main reason I keep paper money on me these days."}
{"text":"Nice and cozy coffee house.  The couch looks old but comfy. Coming here with friends for some chats or being solo with your books in the afternoon, accompanied with a glass of coffee, which is not insanely costly would always give you some warm feeling. This coffee house somehow gave me some tranquility feeling - that detaches me from hustle."}
{"text":"\"Cash-only\" usually means I end up paying a $1.75 ATM-fee, but I'm occasionally willing to make that concession.  I theoretically understand the the theory behind it ... keeping the money local.  As far as I can tell, Mother Fool's keeps it local.  Their coffee is from Colectivo and their baked goods are from around the corner (I can recommend the apple pastry).  It's a strange mix of people who visit this place.  It looks like some of them are old townies and others are really cool hipsters.  At times I felt like this place was too cool for me, but I still appreciate the local artists on the wall, and appreciate at least the concept that they have live music and open-mic nights.  I say, \"Keep it up!\""}
{"text":"I love Mother Fool's... As a barista myself, this IS my all-time favorite spot in Madison.  The Baristas here are consistently friendly.  -Despite the hipster atmosphere the Baritas don't act \"cooler-than-you\" than extremely helpful, friendly, and they earn their tips! As for the coffee, i honestly say i enjoy it the most out of anything. I always get a flavored Latte but once while talking to the barista he forgot to ask what flavor i wanted and made my latte plain, which was something i'd never get by choice. But it was awesome!  He had taken his time to steam the milk to perfection and i could take the quality of the espresso instead of the sugary syrup flavor i've been \"enjoying\" my whole espresso-drinking experience.   Don't even get me started on the food products.  All bakery items are vegan?!?!?! I'm in.  And they're never too-dry or stale.  They're delicious and nothing i can get anywhere else. I love that they partner with local bussinesses like The Green Owl Cafe and Ladonia Cafe.  Those are also, high quality eats, in my books. All in all, this place is DEFINITELY my cup of tea.  I'm a regular."}
