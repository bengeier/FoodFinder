{"text":"Tried this place yesterday for lunch. I arrived early (11:00 a.m.) and was the first customer. Decided on  the pizza combo-choice of pizza (I had the Buffalo on thin crust), side salad (Italian) and drink for $10.99. The meal was not bad, fresh ingredients, prepared right in front of me and came out quickly. The owner is super friendly and accomodating-extra star just for his friendliness and attention to detail."}
{"text":"I'm in search of the perfect pineapple pizza. Pie Five's pineapple and ham pizza was absolutely scrumptious. The classic pan crust was so fluffy and the sauce and cheese blended beautifully. The pineapple was pretty fresh and the ham was tasty. The Magic Dust was the perfect touch and it helped make the pizza truly unique. I thoroughly enjoyed eating the pizza. The ambiance was casual even though I grabbed the pizza to go.  I used a coupon which made the pizza a few dollars cheaper."}
{"text":"This pizza was a disappointment. The young people molding the dough did not use gloves and when I mentioned this I was told they didn't need to! GAG! I left my purse at the table and returned to find it there, untouched. Is anyone paying attention in this store? I won't be back."}
{"text":"Have been three times.  Staff are welcoming and prepare the pizza according to my desires.  Very clean and well-organized.  The only problem is each time I have visited I have received a pizza that is cold And uncooked in the middle. Tonight's pie did not have cheese melted in the center. I've noticed the last two times that the server reaches into the oven and pulls the pizza out, thus, there may not be enough time for it to finish.  Again, the ingredients and pie are tasty... Just cold in the middle as it may not have enough time to fully cook.  Have a wide variety on the menu."}
{"text":"It was ok at the best. Salad was no worth it. The bread bowl was hard as a rock. It hasn't been someplace I've returned to."}
{"text":"PIZZA LOVERS BEWARE!  You cannot buy a full size pizza at this \"restaurant\", only personal sized pies. This is definitely not your local pizza joint. I would call it a \"poor man's Brixx\" or a pizza version of McDonalds. Not only were we disappointed in the quality of the pizza (personally, this does not even qualify as pizza for me) but the place was extremely dirty. There was trash, napkins, pieces of food, etc all over the floor. There were plenty of employees hanging out behind the counter, and not many customers, so I am not sure why it was in such disarray. I can see this \"restaurant\" as a go-to place for people with small children who may all want different toppings on their pizza. However, my husband and I were very sad we wasted our \"pizza night\" on PieFive."}
{"text":"It's fast, it's inexpensive and it tastes awesome. The Farmer's Market pizza is great. I'm in there at least once a week."}
{"text":"I like this place. I like the concept and I like the choices. But, there is way too much garlic used in their sauce. Which is the reason I only give it 3 stars. I don't like pizza places that don't have enough confidence in their product and ingredients that they feel compelled to over garlic their food. Next time I will get pizza without the sauce."}
{"text":"Pie5 pizza is good classic pizza. I preferred the thin crust over the thick. It's very tasty and the service was great."}
{"text":"Can you give less than one star? I went into this PIZZA RESTAURANT hoping for one tiny personal pan and guess what they didn't have---- pizza!!! How an establishment  formed for the sole purpose of serving pizza runs out of pizza dough is beyond me. Guess it never occurred to them to be prepared to make the product they advertise."}
{"text":"Pie Five was really good for the price. You get to choose your crust type, and then pick your sauce and toppings. It was also pretty fast...my friend recommended running it through the oven twice to get the crust crispy. So I did, and it was very good."}
{"text":"Horrible. Almost inedible pizza. We ordered six pizzas. The crust was like cardboard and the toppings were incredibly sparse on my families pizzas. We would have rather have spent the money on a legitimate pizza restaurant."}
{"text":"My daughter loves this place. Like that they have a gluten free option for my wife, but a really good option for quick and fun pizza."}
{"text":"I give this place 3 stars on the fact that the restaurant itself is pretty neat and tidy. The food on the other hand is average at best. The cheese is low tier, the dough is okay, the pepperoni is average. It's a standard pizza place, except there are better pizza joints in town."}
{"text":"New concept, great taste! It's sorta like a better alternative to going to a local pizza joint to pick up slices, except getting a whole personal pizza with all the topping you'd want. The pizza was $6.79, and I will be back soon. With Chipotle in the next plaza over, this is the area to grab a quick, personalized bite to eat.   I had the Athenian pizza with traditional pan crust and ranch sauce, and added bacon. So delicious, and it is more than enough for one hungry person. I also got a slice of chocolate chip cookie pie which I will skip next time."}
{"text":"Since being diagnosed as having type 2 diabetes I have had to try, and the keyword here kiddies is \"TRY\", to watch what I consume. I have to check my sugar numbers each morning. I go here and order their whole wheat thin crust pizza with some of their fresh toppings and guess what? My numbers didn't rise not even a little after eating the whole thing all by myself. I also have to say that it is one of my favorites as well as far as taste. Great concept and follow through for this chain. Very well worth anyones time for a pie 5 pizza experience."}
{"text":"Worst restaurant experience I ever had. Went today for dinner at 7:00. There were 4 people working and they all were just standing around talking and no one even asked us anything when we came in. They just starred like deer in headlights. We had to ask how they want us to order. The guy that was suppose to make our pizza stood there lost and the other three I think was either high or just didn't care about there jobs. The ashore I'm not sure if he was a guy or girl nor did he. Pizza was the worst also. My advice eat at similar pizza chains that are busier and have a whole let better service. Uncle Maddio's , Blaze Pizza, or MODS are millions times better than this crap. . And service at these are amazing."}
{"text":"Love the fact that I got to create my own pizza, just the way I like it and it taste so good~! You can add as many toppings as you like for the same price~! Definitely one of my favorite places~!"}
{"text":"Pie five is the most delicious and genius idea in the world! Every time I go I make sure to get the buffalo chicken pizza and sometimes add either bacon or more tomato ! I absolutely love making and creating my own delicious pizza. The service is always attentive and helpful and the food is alway amazing.  I love bringing friends and letting them experience Pie Five!"}
{"text":"The pizza, salad, and drink combo is a great deal!  Wow the side-salad was amazing.  The  peach tea is unforgettable!   The pizza is ok for a fast foody type place, but overall love it."}
{"text":"Not only is the pizza amazing, the service is impeccable and second to none. Its my pleasure to pay for this product"}
{"text":"So we have visited Pie 5 twice now, love the concept and the prices can't be beat $7 for a pizza LOADED with good toppings of your choice.  Today I had the \"High Five\" but added mushrooms and red onions, my wife got the Athenian, we got a side salad, a dessert and 2 drinks for $18.  The concept is simple, you can order from their suggested toppings and crust or build your own...not as complicated as some make it to be.   The side salads are good, we had the Italian today and it was really good.  The desserts are ok, we got the turtle brownie  and my wife and I both agreed it had a cinnamon taste which we didn't care for.  The menu boast \"craft beer\"...was VERY disappointed at the beer selection....from memory Bud, Bud Light, Miller Light, Mick Ultra, and Stella (that was the one considered craft).  Spoke with who I assume was the owner, suggested they work on getting some better local beers....in case they read this review NoDa Brewing Co starts canning their beers this month, also Foothills, Highland etc are some other real craft beers you could have on the shelf easily.  If your in the area and like pizza I'd check it out."}
{"text":"Not great, but not awful. Only one of the young ladies was friendly and seemed to care about being there. Notice the workers who were kneadinfg the dough were gloveless. Think I prefer the thin crust to the traditional here. Allows to cook the toppings bette. Nice they have a rewards program and would go again, just no more special trips."}
{"text":"What a good find! Think subway meets pizza and voila, you have Pie Five! The pizzas are made to order, right in front of you. You choose the crust, the sauce and as many toppings as your heart desires. Then they pop in the oven and about 7 minutes later, fresh yummy pizza! They also have a menu of speciality pizzas so you don't have to do much of the heavy lifting. Best part? All of this ends up to be around $5-$6! My ABSOLUTE favorite combo is the BBQ Chicken pizza with a pan crust and of course, I add pineapples. Talk about a foodgasm! I guess you can have yours without pineapples, but I mean, that would just be silly."}
{"text":"Updated review. Original review bellow.  So, it turns out my neighbor who is disabled liken this place and wanted me to take her up there.  Figured I too would give it another try. It wasn't that I didn't like it before, I just was not close to be filling up after spending $11.  I utilized the check in to get a pie for one of my kids for $5 (he enjoyed it).  I then went with the Pizza, Side Salad and drink combo for $11.49 with the total for myself and my kid being over $20 and that was his pizza being discounted $2.50.  I ordered the same pizza I had previously ordered. The first thing I noticed was the guy putting the toppings on was putting on more of each topping then the previous person who made my 1st one put on.  While the pizzas were cooking, I mentioned this to the guy and his response was 'thats pretty common...we dont pile them on because its easier to add more then to take some off and some people like a ton of toppings while others like less, and since the customer can simply say please put more of this or that on, we normally go light on everything, knowing the customer can always ask for more'...  I replied back and said 'ok, makes sense, but I didn't ask you to go heavier on anything..you just did it'. He then said 'well we all make them a bit differently since we know the customer can always say more/less etc...and when I look at a guy, im going to go a bit heavier on each topping then if you were a 70 year old lady'.  Ok, in any event, once the pizza was out of the oven I could tell it weighed a lot more then my previous one.  And yes, it did fill me up. Not 'stuffed' but satisfied. Ate the side salad last as I wanted to see how filling the pizza on its own would be. After the side salad I wasn't quite in 'loosen the belt...fully stuffed' mode, but somewhere in between satisfied and stuffed, which is good for lunch.  Still think it was a tad expensive at a bit under $12.50, so will try them again with a to go order, no drink, no salad and will tell whoever is putting the toppings on to go heavy and see how that fills me up for the $8 it'll cost.  My kid liked his pizza, and did eat the whole pie (not the kiddie version, the regular one), but he only got 4 toppings as he's a bit picky.   The key will be my 2 other kids. Guaranteed they will go with fully loaded pies so im curious to hear their verdict as well the overall cost for myself and 3 kids. Eating there, we will have to go with drinks and possibly deserts of breadstix.   Likely will be pretty expensive. I know typically we can go to our favorite pizza place and get a large with 4 drinks for $20ish, give or take a buck, and we are all pretty filled up.  So, lets see how things go with this place when I take all 3 kids up there, and what the cost ends up being as compared to other places we eat.  It will be more expensive, but how much more will be key. If not too much more expensive its likely worth the extra $'s, because each of the 4 of us can get 2 toppings or 20. If its way more expensive, not sure if it would be worth it.  But we shall see."}
{"text":"This sure ain't pizza! It's a fast food chain's simulation... Don't waste your time or appetite on lukewarm assembly line pie."}
{"text":"My go to lunch spot on mondays! Pizzas are on special. They also have the most phenomenal pizza salad!"}
{"text":"I think this place is worthy of 5 stars given what it is... Fast food pizza.  If you're in a hurry and want some good pizza, you can't go wrong with this place.  Your pizza is made right before your eyes with fresh ingredients and comes out of the oven in 3 minutes!  Their pizza and salad combination make a very nice quick lunch place at a very reasonable price.  The concept is awesome: it's a set price for whatever pizza and toppings you want. After they put the toppings on your pie it runs through a conveyor type oven for a couple of minutes and it's in your hand within 5 minutes of ordering.  I like that they serve alcohol (bottled, not full bar). It's nice if you want a beer along with your pizza.  Place is super clean and the staff is always very friendly and helpful. Love to eat here whenever I'm in town.  Just wish they had one where I live."}
{"text":"I am soooo glad I saw an advertisement in the mail for them, because my family and I really love Pie Five!  This is our\"go-to\" spot\" for pizza and salads... and their brownies and black tea are awesome too.  If you like choosing your own ingredients (and not having to pay an arm and a leg for extra stuff), check them out.  Their \"bundle\" option includes a personalized pizza, salad or dessert with a drink for about $10.  And you might only be able to eat half of the pizza!  I try to stop by on Fridays, Saturdays or days I just don't feel like cooking.  They are friendly, have a nice casual atmosphere and will make your pizza or salad anyway you want... no questions asked and at no extra cost.  I also like their rewards program, but just be sure to bring your card/key chain card to get your points.  The only downside is that they really should consider staying open later... especially on the weekends."}
{"text":"Like many franchises that start from a great concept but expand too quickly,  this pizza five suffers from a lack of focus and a product that doesn't reach its potential.  The idea is great but in practice the basics of pizza making we're not followed-  toppings were piled in the center rather towards the edges resulting in a undercooked crust.   A cardinal sin in the world of gourmet pizza.  The service was only at a basic level and did nothing to convince me to come back."}
{"text":"Great pizza! Utilized the check in deal and got a pan pizza for 5 dollars. I like that you can put as many toppings on your pizza as you want. I was very full once I finished. I will say it seems overpriced though. I wouldn't have gotten it without the deal."}
{"text":"Pie Five is a solid lunch option in Matthews. There's a wide selection if toppings, sauces and crust choices. Personal favorite is the thin crust with spicy marinara.   The service is generally very prompt and always extremely friendly. They apologize for any wait and keep the line moving. My only recommendation would be to put up a clear marker for where the line should begin, as sometimes that can be awkward if it's busy.   The Yelp check in and app can help save a few bucks on the purchase which is great, too! High five to Pie Five!"}
{"text":"Best gluten free pizza crust in Charlotte! Great concept, good ingredients. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Pie Five is a perfectly OK fast food alternative, I'm convinced this new franchise will do well but rating it on par with say ... Pure? I mean come on, that's simply preposterous!   I found a coupon in my mail box, my first thought was \"great, one more pizza franchise, just what Matthews needed!\" -Not. The concept looked intriguing:  any pizza, any combination of toppings, one price (under $7) so I decided to check it out.  There was a small rush when I got there maybe 20 people ahead of me including kids. The help was hustling as fast as it could, particularly a kid in a black tee who seemingly was hammering down and garnishing everyone's pizza single handed -and feeling the pain. The order process was rushed, customers seemed overwhelmed and tended to say 'that's all' after only a couple of toppings.   Not yours truly, I asked for : classic pan crust, Tuscan marinara, minced garlic (turned out to be prepared garlic in oil), Mozzarella/Provolone blend, spinach,  Italian sausage and bacon (both crumbled), red onions and artichoke hearts, sprinkled with parmesan and herbs mix on top. And a Stella with that.   Honestly what I got LOOKED great and was tasty - so it should be considering  the toppings I picked. Why only 3 stars? Because quality-wise the toppings were middle of the road - not the worst but not gourmet either - but most of all because of the crust.   I'm not sold on the taste and consistency of this dough formulated to bake in 2 minutes or less - which this was."}
{"text":"Awesome place to eat! My wife and I ate there today. Had two pizzas and two drinks for 17 bucks! Can't beat that! Got two desserts afterwards for close to 4 bucks! Was a great place to visit! We will definitely be back! Friendly faces! Great customer service! Clean facilities! What more can you ask for! Awesome hole in the wall to dine at!"}
{"text":"Top Line: Cool new pizza joint that hit the spot  I describe this place as the Subway of Pizza places.  Pretty cool how you can choose whatever toppings/crusts you want.  They make it up fresh, all-in-all, it was really good food!  Plus, the salads come in Pizza Dough bowls - those were cool.  Bottom line: if you are the area and want something different, check it out."}
{"text":"Slightly overpriced in my opinion, but much better quality than if you order Dominos, Papa Johns, or anything of that tier.   However, the food is really good. The first time my boyfriend and I went here I remember looking at my pizza and thinking \"this is so small I am going to need a second dinner later.\" But I couldn't even finish it!!! So filling and yummy.   I've tried the carbonara and BBQ pizza. Both were excellent and I'm currently dreaming about a double cooked BBQ pizza.   While we don't go here that often, it's a nice change of pace and you get to pretend you're having a make your own pizza night because you can choose all the toppings you want!  I wish they had better side or dessert options but I understand that their main focus is the pizza."}
{"text":"Great find; first visit & had Tuscan Chicken on wheat crust. Generous toppings and quick. Plan to return"}
{"text":"Pretty good pizza and you can even get gluten free! Staff was friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"we ate lunch here, it was great.  Finally, a specialty pizza place that uses real mozzarella!!  I had the chicken pesto pizza, made for me and ready in about 5 minutes!! Impressed!!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is unique in that you can build your own pizza with about any topping you want and for one price.  The choice of crusts is great for diabetics and gluten free customers. I have eaten here at least 10 times since they opened.  I will recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Terrible.   Terrible service. 2 guys making 1 pizza while a line forms out the door.   Terrible food   Just terrible."}
{"text":"I love you Pie Five! I don't know why I don't come more often. Quick and tasty every time. Very nice staff. I used to just bring the kids here when we couldn't decide on one kind of pizza, but I have found myself coming more for lunch just for me! The rewards program is pretty cool too. Got my pie for free today! Winning!"}
{"text":"Clean, fast, good service. Only five mins can get the pizza u created & taste awesome! Salad do the same. Love it(_)"}
{"text":"Light little pizzas for $7.  I got a deluxe one and had a coupon for checking in which was good for trying a new restaurant.  The young lady making my pizza was irritated at my request for cheese on top of the pizza.  The manager who finished preparation and checkout of my pizza was friendly."}
{"text":"My first time here. Food and service was excellent. Ingredients were fresh and never !!! Have I been to a pizzaery where you have unlimited toppings at no extra charge."}
{"text":"I bought a livingsocial deal for Pie Five. The Pie Five reminded me subway that you can choose any toppings and any pizza for 7 dollars. The service was fast.  The pizza was really good. At first i thought the pizza was small but after they putted in the oven the pizza was good size. The size of pizza is good for one person. My friend had the high five and it was really good. I had the veggie pizza and I enjoyed. This place is located in the Matthew Festival shopping center and easy to park. The service is quick and they bring out your pizza fast. If you are in a hurry for lunch, please stop by at Pie Five Pizza."}
{"text":"Hands down best pizza in Indian Trail/Matthews area. We come here once a week! So many different options, fun environment and friendly staff!!"}
{"text":"Our first visit to a Pie Five. We had 7 people all wanting different toppings. They accommodated every topping want the kids have. The service is just what it promises, 5 minutes and the pizza is hot fresh and delicious. The staff was very friendly. We will definitely be back on our next trip."}
{"text":"Quick. Really quick. Tasty food. Just the right portion size. Friendly staff. Not sure what its like when its dinner rush but around 4pm its easy in-easy out"}
{"text":"I really liked this place and just started going in November maybe December 2017.   They always offered deals and even Yelp cash back.  Decent service and I even downloaded the app.   Tf.   P.S. hearts for the magic dust and dessert option."}
{"text":"While the pizza isn't the best I've ever had (far from it, in fact), this place is what it sets out to be. Fast and friendly. Filling and fresh. How many more \"F\" words can I come up with to describe this place? Funny, funky, fiery. Ok, ok. I'll stop.   You have your choice of 4 crusts -- thin, traditional, pan or gluten free. I got pan on my first visit -- it was think and held up well under all the toppings I piled on but was also really dry. I think I'll try thin next time.    I missed any potential cheese choices. They asked, \"Do you want shredded mozzarella?\" and I mumbled \"Yeah, sure.\" It wasn't the tastiest cheese I've ever had and didn't get super ooey gooey when baked like I prefer on my pizzas. Note to self, pay more attention to cheese options on my next visit.    After the crust and cheese pushers, you're faced with the Chipotle of pizza. Pie Five a handful of sauce options -- I went with the spicy marinara and enjoyed it -- and tons of toppings. I topped my creation with bacon, spinach, sun-dried tomatoes, mushrooms, and caramelized onions.   Be sure to check in on Yelp to get your pizza for $5 -- about a $3 savings!"}
{"text":"Can't get enough of Pie Five, and I am afraid of the day that it gets \"discovered\" because I have enjoyed the peaceful, quick, healthy meals I have become accustomed to there! It's a Chipotle-like experience - in that you walk in, hop in line, choose your crust/toppings (or salad, if you like), then pay, grab a seat and wait for yummy to arrive. They have a number of healthy and fresh toppings to choose from. Plus, you select your crust (artisan thin, pan, etc.) and sauce (pesto, olive oil, tomato, etc.). It literally takes 5 minutes. And the pizzas are generously sized - more than enough for a meal. I usually get the salad, too, then take half of my pie home for a snack later.   A few extra tips about Pie Five. Free wi-fi, kids' meals, beer and wine available. It's super clean and bright, and the staff is really friendly. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"For an upscale fast food pizza joint, you cant beat this spot.  Think Chipotle meets pizza.  Try the BBQ Chicken pizza....it's fantastic!"}
{"text":"Passing by today and thought we would give it a try. We were greeted right away and the staff was very friendly. The concept is simple: Build your pizza the way you would a sub. pick your crust type, your sauce and all your toppings and it's ready in 5 minutes. When you build your own, it's the same price no mater what toppings or how many you choose and all pizzas are the same personal size.  My wife got the whole wheat thin crust and I got the classic pan. We both really liked our pizzas. A little under $20 for the 2 pizzas and 2 drinks. (note: their bacon is good. I mention this because many times pizza places have terrible bacon) their spicy marinara is good too and does have some spice to it."}
{"text":"Was pleasantly surprised by Pie Five. Your food comes fast, but it's fresh and very tasty. Pleasant, relaxed ambience. Will return."}
{"text":"Love it! So hard to find great gluten-free pizza! It's was delicious, the seating area was clean and the staff was very friendly. I'll definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Love the concept of this! It's like subway but with pizza instead. Lines can sometimes be long but it's worth it. I went with my friend and her 4 year old nephew and they were very accommodating to her nephew. Restaurant is clean and lots of parking. Pizza was delicious and I love how I can watch what toppings they put on there as well as how much sauce. Food didn't take long. Salads are also good. I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"My 7 year old loved the kids cheese pizza, but I thought the gluten free crust was good but not enough cheese and tasted like it was put through a microwave oven. Overall great price but you always get what you pay for. Service as not great either. Not many working seemed excited to be there."}
{"text":"I found this great pizza place in Matthews wanting a good pizza on a Friday nite  They only do personal pizzas which is great an you can add as many or as little toppings as you like the price is the same I know shocker Ingredients are fresh an staff is very friendly and helpful . You pick out your pizza an it's like subway you tell them what toppings as you go along. Than they out your pizza in the oven it's like 5 mins no lie than its done now I did have them out my pizza back in for a crisper crust an hotter but depends on what you like. They have deals you can get s salad it's a little the same you pick your ingredients. They have some desert pizza but even though it's a personal pizza it's enough to take home some yum I can't wait to go back an it's perfect for a family not everyone likes the same toppings so you can all get a different pizza an the kids get their own an everybody is happy enjoy"}
{"text":"Tried this place for  the first time today and really liked it! Got  the Anthenian pizza with a spinach salad & drink. It's enough to feed me tomorrow as well so I thought it was a good deal!   I really liked the sun dried tomato paste and cheesy cracker crust with the salad. The salad was okay - I'll probably try another next time.  I'll definitely go back. The service was good too - we got there early, at around 11:15 am. Wish I had taken pictures, because all of our orders looked & tasted great."}
{"text":"Love the individual pizza- there are menu choices or you can create you own. Never had one I didn't like- would recommend for a quick lunch or a family dinner."}
{"text":"Pretty average chain-ish restaurant.  I would eat here again if I were nearby, but wouldn't go out of the way for it.    The staff was nice and accommodative.  It was easy to order and quick to get your food.  The pizza was not bad.   The shop was clean, easy to find, and simple to park (in a shopping plaza).  There was plenty of room at the restaurant for a lot of people.  Overall a decent, satisfying experience."}
{"text":"This is like the best quick pizza, get it anyway you like place in Matthews. I love their rewards program and the people that work there are super nice. Its never packed and/or dirty. Good food, fast and clean. My kind a place. Love coming here. Its my top 5 places for lunch every week. If you haven't tried them, give them one shot. I'm sure you will be convinced with that one try."}
{"text":"Very interesting concept- fresh ingredients. I ordered the Tucson chicken pizza and it was great! I honestly have never seen anything like it so I was interested when a group from church asked us to join them. Individualized pizza - what? No bickering with your significant other on pizza sauce and toppings - yes please! I took off a star bc it was oddly smoky and I smelled like I had worked there for 12 hrs for the rest of the day."}
{"text":"The pizza is always great. Recommend the BBQ chicken pizza with bacon and banana peppers."}
{"text":"Great pizza in a pinch! Its a build your own personal pie place, which is REALLY kid friendly. A lil pricey, but the hubby and I used Groupon which made it a nice last min dinner option. they put salads in a bread bowl, salad was good...bread bowl not so much. All in all, a great alternative to other fast pizza chains."}
{"text":"I love pizza but my biggest issue is my kids dont like the same toppings that I like so I went to Pie Five and was shocked how reasonable the pricing was plus the toppings were high quality & fresh. Everyone could order the pizza they wanted & no extra charge for additional toppings!!! The pizza was fantastic..."}
{"text":"I was getting pretty hungry and was in the mood for Pizza while running errands in Matthews today, as usual I yelped for the closest pizza with good reviews. I deposited my  Five pie was it, a nice clean place with fresh looking toppings and lots of choices. While I am generally Big on the NY style pizza, that is not what they make here. So I picked my Choice of crust, Sauce, toppings and cheese. You can pretty much go crazy on toppings, but more toppings means less crisp on the crust. I likes it Crispy! I decided to order a Maui Wowee and one Pizza with more traditional sauce,  Marinara. They were both tasty all though in no way can you call them New York style, the crust is more like a cracker which was ok. When it came time to pay I thought I could use my Apple Pay since I had just left the bank and deposited every penny I had, I only had six dollars in cash. At this point I could either pay for one pizza, or drive over to Harris Teeter Harris Teeter and get money back. So I asked him to hold it until I got back, are you ready for this? The young man behind the counter named Ryan offered to pay for the rest of my pizza order! I was truly shocked by his kindness. So I am giving their choice of Employees 5 stars, although in honesty I couldn't give it a five (unless it was New York style pizza where the cheese would drag from your mouth to the pizza slice and could be folded like a paper airplane.) All the Employees were friendly and helpful, and the ingredients were fresh. On Mondays all Pizza is $5 and change, go check them out! PS: I chose Red Marinara Sauce, Mozzarella, Parmesan, Chicken, kalamata olives, Onions, and pineapple and Jalapeño. Yum!"}
{"text":"definitely my favorite pizza in this area. so fast and so good!! love the options in crust thickness!!"}
{"text":"Love this place.  It's like a subway, but with pizza instead of subs. Our family loves it so much, we have been here 4 times in 2 months!!!"}
