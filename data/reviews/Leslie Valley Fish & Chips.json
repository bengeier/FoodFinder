{"text":"Hot food, delivered promptly by a friendly face. All sounds good up to that point but three stars may be a little too generous for the general cleanliness of the place & the less than rigorous adherence to cleanliness guidelines for the food industry. While the chef wore a hat, the server (with long locks flowing) spent as much time in the food prep area as he did, alternating between serving, handling cash & cooking, & all without any hand washing. The condiment bottles, salt & pepper pots, etc. were all overdue for a visit to the dishwasher. I can't say that I didn't enjoy my fish 'n' chips but I'd probably be a bit more reluctant to order anything that wasn't deep fried. On my Friday lunchtime visit, it was a pretty busy spot so there are many folk that don't appear to share my concerns. I would probably come back again myself, as the critical memories fade!

Had to bump it down a star by the time I left. One of my pet peeves with some restaurants is the reluctance to refill a coffee cup! I had to ask 3 times for my first refill &, despite staying past the rush, I was not offered a 2nd! I don't expect them to endlessly refill a sole coffee purchase, for an inconsiderate customer just there to use their Wi-Fi connection, but I had a decent meal here & they don't have Wi-Fi!

This looks like a husband & wife team & I love to support that kind of establishment but, along with a little better hygiene, I need to be treated just a little bit better to make me a regular."}
{"text":"Popped in this establishment after seeing a lunch special sign $4.99 Haddock and Chips.  I was actually expecting a bait and switch for Basa and Chips, but surprisingly I did get Haddock.  Maybe as my expectation was low, I really enjoyed the crispy batter (wasn't over battered either) and descent size fillet.  The chips were crispy as well and tbh, for the money...it's well worth it.

Only thing was, when I reached for the ketchup bottle...2 tablespoons of liquid came out before the ketchup...I should've shaken the bottle.  

Place is not very elegant, 80's old school feel.

Will return for take out."}
{"text":"This is a mom and pop restaurant, the owner chef really passion and proud of what he does, he made every things from scratch, from sauce to soup... it's a small fish and chips restaurant but very consistent. love the clam chowder, love the haddock, love the price"}
{"text":"Best fish and chips in town! Just the way they are supposed to be, oily, flaky, and clearly fatty. The special is always the same haddock, fries, and coleslaw at a good price. The couple who runs the place is very friendly and efficient. It's definitely a place you want to do take out from because they don't care much for their dining area. Old furniture, decor, and condiments. It's a popular place and I've had their food countless times, but I've never seen anyone actually sitting down and eating there."}
{"text":"Ive passed by here a few times in the hunt for new places to get my ever growing belly (yelp has made me gain wait damnit! Lol). So i figured i would give it a shot , there were prices listed in the window and it looked very inexpensive and after buying a fish and chips to go, with an extra order of chips, the total was around 12-13 dollars which was great. Only issue i had was the fries and breading on the fish wasnt very crispy, now this may have occured on my drive home , maybe had i ate in , it would have been better. But for the price i really cant complain. So 3 stars for a reasonable price for mid quality food aint half bad, no? 

Try it out, eat in there its likely better then taking out, espically if you are on a budget."}
