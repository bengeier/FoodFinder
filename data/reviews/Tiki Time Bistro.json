{"text":"The best wings fresh and made to order. Very friendly bar staff. Love the place. There lunch specials can't be beat."}
{"text":"It's a dive bar with crab legs and sticky floors. But I can't complain because the service is always great and I love crab and people let me show up and read my book and eat my crab legs. Crab legs are grilled, be aware. :)"}
{"text":"The saturday mardi gras menu is phenominal. Tried the shrimp and grits,  crawfish etoufee and had the white chocolate  bread pudding for dessert. It felt like I was having dinner on Bourbon St. In the \"big easy\". If you're looking for authentic New Orleans style cooking, this is the place to eat every saturday."}
