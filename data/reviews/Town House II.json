{"text":"I've gone here for 20 years and loved it. It's a family run business. The food is great but the recipes seemed to have changed a little since the former owner passed away. The wonderful employees keep me coming back though. They have the best server, Clarence, and people line up and wait for a table in his section!"}
{"text":"Been eating here my whole life. It's amazing if you want some southern food. Best mashed potatoes around. Green beans are amazing. Vegetable soup is super good with homemade cornbread. The chocolate cake is so amazing. Breakfast is super good and cheap too! Go there. Eat. Enjoy."}
{"text":"Well I finally tried this place for the first time. Totally gross! I had the meatloaf, mashed potatoes and gravy, and vegetable soup. All of it was completely bland and tasted as if they put no seasoning whatsoever. The meat loaf was unidentifiable and so mushy it just fell apart. You can buy better food out of the freezer section at any grocery store. I would not recommend this place at all."}
{"text":"it would be nice if the business would post some pics of their specials since they do not have a formal menu or website.  They post the daily specials on their facebook page only--some photos of the dish may give some incentive to visit this place for some of that home cooking everyone is raving about!! I havent tried this place yet, but looking forward to it!"}
{"text":"It's like having your mothers kitchen at your disposal anytime you want...it can get dangerous."}
{"text":"Ate here today for lunch. Gross! Ordered the lite plate of their meat and 2 which means that it is less food. However, price is the same for lite or regular plate. The food was subpar, and I won't be returning. So disappointed!"}
{"text":"Good breakfast. Great fast service. Been here several times and enjoyed the food. Very reasonable on their prices too."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Cash only, old mom & pop atmosphere. Everyone knows everyone. You can get breakfast all day. And did I mention they have cherry lemon sun drop?!"}
