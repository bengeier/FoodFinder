{"text":"DO NOT order from here through Skip The Dishes. Food took 1.5 hours to arrive and when it did, it was missing two meals.  The food that did arrive was cold and soggy. Totally inedible. Spoke to the restaurant directly and they assured me they would provide a full refund. Despite the owner (they said they were the owner) agreeing to refund everything (not just the missing food), a full refund never came. Awful experience. Would def not recommend !!!"}
{"text":"Initially drawn to this place by the \"free burrito\" day promotion they had.  Since then I've already gone back 3 times. The staff are always super nice and helpful when trying to make a choice.   The best stuff this place offers is fresh ingredients. They offer fresh jalape√±os, diced onions, peppers, cilantro and have a corn salsa and pico. I find that fresh veggies alone make this taste better than most burrito places.     Also the ancho chipotle sauce is delicious. I've heard their hot sauce is pretty spicy and haven't ventured into trying it yet."}
{"text":"Rare case of catching both quality and quantity at the same time. I'm surprised to receive the same quality of the food as what I used to have back in Yonge/Sheppard! Nacho chip is essential with cheese dip!"}
{"text":"Best burritos in the area.  Only burrito do with the nachos and fries supreme.  No other burrito place makes the nachos with all the toppings."}
{"text":"BarBurrito just opened up in the area, right across the street from MuchoBurrito, which is an interesting choice for location.  Do we really need two burrito chains so close together? Aren't they basically the same thing?  As someone who's eaten at MuchoBurrito many times and has now been to BarBurrito 4 times, I think they are indeed very similar and probably don't need to exist so close together, but hey, competition is always a good thing, especially for us customers.  What I like about this place:  1)Fast! I can be in and out in literally 3 minutes. That is a huge bonus.  2)Fresh! They keep the containers of ingredients they pull from a lot smaller than most places, so they are refreshing them more often, and it pays off. No browning guacamole or wilting cilantro here  3)Saucy! They have a lot more selection for sauces than MuchoBurrito, such as Ancho Chipotle and Spicy BBQ, and a few other dairy-based ones I have to avoid. MuchoBurrito just has \"Burrito Sauce\" and sour cream.  4)Pull-y? The pulled pork is REALLY good and is my go-to every time.  5)Teary! The tiny diced red onions they use make the pulled pork just pop. It's a tiny detail but sooo good.  Here is the caveat:  I only eat burrito bowls. I don't actually do traditional burritos, I prefer it like a salad, toss all the beans and rice and toppings into a bowl, shake it up, and go to town.  That being said let me list negatives:  1)Proteins - The chicken is fairly bland, especially compared to MuchoBurritos fantastic pollo. And the \"steak\" feels a lot more like ground beef, even though there's a ground beef option as well. It's not bad at all, but compared to the pulled pork, your quality options are a bit limited. I have not tried the chorizo, ground beef, or fish options.  2)Salsas - They have pico de gallo and that's pretty much it, I love Mucho's multi-salsa options and wish they'd have more here.  So in summation, I don't eat the burritos, I can't have dairy, so I don't know how cheesy or awesome the burritos are, or if they over/under grill them, or if they tortillas are stale, etc  But I think eating the bowls with just the bare ingredients (onion, guac, salsa, lettuce, rice, pinto beans and protein) gives me a good understanding of the quality of them as they are not being masked with cheese and sour cream.  And they are good so far. Some proteins could use a bit more seasoning, but the pulled pork is to die for, so I'm sticking with it.  Fast and fresh, not bad for a chain."}
{"text":"First time here and not bad. Will definately back when im in the area (which is rarely).   Had the steak burrito and it was good. The meat was chopped up so it kinda resembled ground beef but good none the less. Sauces were good, fresh toppings...guac is extra."}
{"text":"Food is ok, service is sad. They are rude, disorganized and reek of cigarettes. They can't even manage to serve the line in order. For example after taking my order, they then asked the next person in line for their order. After beginning mine (all they did was take the tortilla from the bag), the server walked away and a new one came up, and completed the person behind's order before the last server returned and worked on mine.   Lots of Mexican restaurants in this area, try any of the others first, this place will leave you disappointed."}
