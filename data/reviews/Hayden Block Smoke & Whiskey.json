{"text":"Half price on all meats after 10 PM! We had the brisket, pulled pork and the ribs and they were all fantastic. The brisket was especially tasty and moist, the best I've had anywhere in Calgary. You would think at 10 PM that the meats would be leftovers from earlier and be a bit dried out and cold but everything that arrived at the table was hot and fresh. The also make a great Whiskey Smash! A+"}
{"text":"Its about time a real bbq opened in Calgary. Great food, cold beer and fantastic service. What else can you ask for. Brisket melts in your mouth, Turkey is very juicy and flavourful, hotlinks were the perfect mixture of hot and tasty. Good Job Hayden Block!"}
{"text":"I've eaten at Hayden Block a couple of times and have sampled most of the menu.  I think their strongest main is the brisket - I loved it. The pulled pork and smoked chicken tasted like they needed some sauce. Anywhere else this would not be a big deal, but Hayden Block has some singularly bad sauces. There's the original (tastes of cumin), the espresso (tastes of cold coffee), and the spicy (not a bbq sauce so much as a hot sauce).  The sides were mostly great. Loved the loaded sweet potato and the bacon wrapped corn.  The weakest main was unfortunately the most expensive one: the short rib. It was oversalted and dried out.  I liked the service and the vibrant atmosphere, but overall I would rather return for a drink and some appetizers than a plate of BBQ."}
{"text":"Used to love this place.  But the food and service has gone steadily down hill.    BBQ is now dried out and tough with little smoke flavor.  I think their 1/2 price hours have made them skimp on smoking time and they are serving pretty sad excuse for Texas bbq now.  Staff is rude and made it clear we weren't welcome/didn't want to seat us.  Made rude comments when we ordered.  Made me so uncomfortable I decided to leave before I had finished.  Refused to give me a box for my food.  Refused to bring me my check while trying to make me order a second drink.  When I said I just want to leave was boxed in by a manager who lectured me as well."}
{"text":"The meat is soooo good. Get the pickles! The brisket was our favourite. Also the espresso BBQ sauce is a beverage.  I think the only critique I have is that the server wasn't very knowledgeable about the different whiskeys."}
{"text":"Good Calgary BBQ, one of the only restaurants in Calgary doing true Texas Style BBQ. Menu was easy to figure out & pricing was affordable. Loved the bbq sauces, sides were creative yet traditional & tasty. Meats were all smoked nice & presented properly. Good beer selection & great whisky list. Happy hour specials were great - 1/2 price whisky !!!! Cool hip setting, loved the family style tables. Need a BBQ fix, hit up Hayden Block"}
{"text":"Nice to see the old yardhouse space refreshed. This spot is promising but needs a few tweaks.   Ordered cocktails and they came promptly. Between two of us we tried the following during the meal:  Raisin rummy - easy to drink, vanilla notes, incredible aroma.  Old Besse - spicy with Ginger, fruity. Black walnut Manhattan - my fave of the four, sweet aroma, medium bodied sipping cocktail. So much flavor. Vonnegut - spicy, citrus, delicious. Cocktails here are great and having been to parlor in the area I'd say this place is going to them a run for their money.  Food was pretty good but the prices here are all over the map. You can add cornbread to any order for $1.00 and it's delicious and muffin sized. For an appy we ordered the hush puppies which were $12.00 and classified under the \"Trays\" section of the menu. When they came out they were on a tray but in the tiniest basket and we got 8. We asked our waitress before we ate them if we had actually received what we thought we had ordered and asked if it was actually $12.00 and the waitress said yes and then kind of just looked at her notepad and didn't say much else. Quite honestly this is likely the most overpriced item I've ever ordered at a restaurant. I wouldn't even pay $12.00 for what we got if you told me it was made with locally sourced non-gmo organic corn and Broek pork. This price point has to change. It's insane. Would be much fairer at $6.00.   We saw a tray of chicken wings go out and there had to have been at least 10 wings on the tray and that was only $1.00 more than the hush puppies.  We also got the pulled chicken sandwich $10.00, and the 1/2 pound pulled pork $10, and the broccoli salad $4.00. All of that seemed a reasonable price to pay. Service was good but for the reaction to our question about the appy.   We also so the chips and queso head to another table and I'm pretty sure the menu had that listed as $13.00. I would say for what I saw that also seemed very overpriced.  Place has potential but it's getting a 3/5 for the major pricing issues on the menu. I'm hesitant to order anything else from the Trays menu. You'd be fine though if you ordered meat and sides and corn bread."}
{"text":"Great BBQ spot.  After 10pm all meats are half off but just as delicious.  Had the brisket, chicken, sausage it's all deadly really.  Amazing selection of whiskey/bourbons and I really enjoy the community style seating.  Great service and friendly staff.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I liked the feel of the place but a rather unfriendly waitress and so so food only made me give it a three.  We had to stop her several times to ask about the menu as it had no descriptions."}
{"text":"The three sauces are excellent. The beans and the potato salad are good. The sausage and the pork ribs bore, conservatively, a month's ration of salt. Honestly, the salt content was borderline lethal. (Maybe the pit master is a heavy smoker, for his taste buds appear completely shot.) Two friendly staff said the turkey is the way to go. I liked the people, so I'll be back for the turkey."}
{"text":"This Austin-style BBQ joint is a welcome addition to the Calgary scene. No reservations, communal tables, and a menu consisting of just meat, whisk(e)ys of the world, and few sides. The meat is dry rubbed and slow smoked for 16 hours for a great texture and flavour across the board (might skip the turkey breast next time though unless with someone on a diet), and best of all you can order in 1/4 pound increments to make your own sampling platter. The meat is quite affordable, and after 10pm is half price! There are three house made sauces in big bottles on the tables, for dipping: a vinegary spiced one, a less sour cumin heavy one, and a deep flavored espresso one. I particularly liked the last two.  The whiskeys range from basic to very rare, with commensurate pricing. Great old fashioned too, I'm guessing the rest of the cocktails are of similar caliber. To put it over the top you can buy an ice sphere for your drink. Super clear and cut on the spot from a block. It'll keep your drink cold with minimal dilution.  All the staff were very friendly and the service was prompt. There are two patios, so definitely coming back some warm evening for well priced, tasty BBQ and some fine brown liquor..."}
{"text":"Love BBQ and smokehouse food, so this place was a must try. Sadly, I wasn't impressed. It took over an hour for our order to arrive. Granted, the place was busy, but we waited and waited. After about 45 minutes the server came by to say, \"Your food should be out shortly.\" The food was good, but overpriced for the portion size. Be especially careful ordering sides and platters, because you may receive a portion size smaller than you expect.  The meat was flavourful and smoked expertly. Our waitress was pleasant, but largely absent.  Also, this place is loud. We could hardly hear ourselves talk. One member of our party was hard of hearing and for that individual, this place was a total bust.  It seems like a trendy place, but honestly, I don't expect it'll last more than a couple of years. Way over-priced. Way too loud. Service leaves a lot to be desired."}
{"text":"This is like the best smoked/BBQ meat I've had in this city.    Went with a few friends on a Friday night.  Service was great, all of the meat choices were succulent and flavorful.  The mac n' cheese is a bit on the cheesy side, but I also liked how it was done.  I'm not a whiskey drinker so I cannot comment on that department, but their beer choice is plentiful.   Definitely will be going back."}
{"text":"Loving this place right now!!! Amazing BBQ, Delicious cocktails, two patios, and wicked vibe.  They have a really good happy hour weekdays from 3-6 with half price whiskey.  In my opinion the best place in Kensington. Gotta get the brisket and the dry rub chicken wings.  I heard 4 people yesterday say they were the best wings they have ever had.  If you like BBQ and whiskey this is your jam.  Lots to love besides that as well."}
{"text":"It definitely misses the mark on being \"Authentic Texas BBQ\".  I had just returned from Texas for the umpteenth time when I tried Hayden Block so it was the perfect time for a fair comparison and unfortunately it just doesn't compare to the real thing. The brisket was just ok (it was overdone and dry the night we were there), pork and ribs were decent. The beans were blah and the coleslaw has a vinaigrette dressing - I have never been to a Texas BBQ joint that served coleslaw with anything other than a creamy dressing. And finally, in order to keep things just as I would in Texas, I ordered their house made sweet tea (non-alcoholic) - this was the absolute worst. It was full of lemon and barely sweet at all. So disappointing. The service was really terrible, but my husband had warned me about that so I went in with the bar set pretty low and believe me, they didn't exceed it even though it wasn't busy and there seemed to be quite a few staff around. The space is really nice (I hate communal tables but that's just me) and I'll probably give them one more try to at least try the creamed corn, but they have a long way to go to be \"Authentic Texas BBQ\"."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere of Hayden Block. The food and service are terrific. I just wish there were sides that aren't as heavy to pair with the meat!"}
{"text":"A great place to take a big eater. I've taken my son and two grandsons there and all enjoyed it immensely. Love the smoked drinker with the giant ice cubes... how to feel like a Southern millionaire 101! Will be back with the hubby soon. He's not a big eater so I might have to help more next time."}
{"text":"Anytime I have an excuse to eat at Hayden Block I do - what a treat! Their smoked, dry-rubbed wings are simply amazing (go on a Wednesday when they are half price)!  I have worked my way through at least half of their Cocktail list - also fabulous. The little patio out back is really special."}
{"text":"Mmmm. Delicious Austin style Bbq in Kensignton! This is an excellent place to get your protein fix, especially after 10pm when it's half price!  Great staff as well!  Kudos to Alix, Ben, Ian, Tanner, Addison, Patty, Jessie, Carly and the others whose names I forgot!"}
{"text":"This place has a cool, backyard BBQ feel to it - bench style seating, string lighting and food dished out in trays.  You have your choice of smoked meats from pork to chicken, and a variety of sides that pretty much cover anything your heart may desire. In my case - broccoli salad and green beans to accompany my deep fried pickles and wings. (All very tasty BTW!)  Although I didn't drink, I kinda wished I had since they have a really diverse whiskey menu. I've been on the search for a really good whiskey sour, and this seems like the place to get one!   The have 1/2 price meats after 10PM, which seems like the perfect time to have 2nd dinner and a (whiskey) nightcap :)"}
{"text":"Best BBQ in Calgary combined with a great atmosphere for a night out. I've had a chance to enjoy the beef brisket, pulled pork and chicken wings, all were some of the best BBQ I've ever had. Recommend the house BBQ sauce.   It has been really busy each time I've been to Hayden Block; however, there has always been a table available and the service was prompt/friendly.  Will definitely be back and will also be recommending to friends."}
{"text":"Went to Hayden block after reading very positive reviews on Yelp! It was a good experience.  The meats and sides were delicious. Great ambience and great service. We had the brisket sandwich and the pulled chicken along with macaroni. The corn bread was nice! Good selection of whiskey for those who like to partake.  Certainly worth many visits."}
{"text":"Great BBQ. Love the bacon wrapped corn on the cob, brisket and ribs. Service is hit or miss."}
{"text":"This is a paradise for meat lovers. They have all sort of bbq, chicken is tender but a little too salty on the skin. Brisket is my favorite as it is tender and a stripe of fat on eat slice. Pork spare ribs is hard to chew. Not order it again.  For the side, we had broccoli salads which is crispy and fresh tasty. (From a person who didn't eat raw broccoli). Bacon wrapped corn is always best combination for bbq.  Overall, it's recommended for any group who don't mind LOUD environment."}
{"text":"Two patios! One in the front and one \"Whiskey Garden\" in the backyard. That alone deserves five stars, with the summer just starting.   But other than that, what makes them stand out from all the other pubs? Whiskey and meat. That's their schtick. To be precise: They offer a long list of different Whiskeys from all over the world, that they happily transfer into a hand-crafted cocktail, if you are not keen on the taste of Whiskey or just really into cocktails. The meat is a Texas-style barbecue, I heard something about \"gets smoked for 16 hours\". Of course, they also have cold beer on draught and a carefully selected wine list on tap (the Pinot Noir is pretty good).  The interior is nicely done; rustic look, warm lights, very inviting. Lots of wooden, long tables and benches, almost like picnic tables. Good for groups. Service is very friendly and attentive   Happy hour is Monday to Thursday from 3-6pm; all Whiskey is half price and Whiskey cocktails are $4 off. They do lunch as well."}
{"text":"Folks. I've had a lot of BBQ in my life. I do a lot of low and slow myself at home and consider myself an above average amateur. And I've had the pro stuff: all over Calgary and in the southern US as well. Let me say this, without a doubt, that this is the best BBQ I've ever had. Best in Calgary for sure.   Specifics. Place is jammed at night, but not at lunch. Turkey is the bombest! Short rib is right next to it. Right behind is the brisket. And chips & queso.  Did not super enjoy the porks: pulled and ribs. They were dry for my taste. Sides are all good though.   Sauces are grteat but I eat my BBQ without sauce here. They do not oversmoke so you can enjoy it on its own.   The owner is awesome. Goes to all the tables and shows he cares. He loves his food, he loves his staff and he loves his patrons. And of course he sports a beard - as do 75% of the guys there!  Run, don't walk, to Hayden Block!"}
{"text":"M-E-A-T. ALL THE MEEEAT. Seriously though, this place brings out your inner carnivore. You might not even think you have an inner raging meat eating barbarian inside of you until the server places in front of you a generous spread of briskets, sausages, chicken, cornbread and ribs.... Then you'll know.   So, let's get down to the specifics of this deliciousness I speak of, shall we?   Inside is pretty cool they have long communal benches but also separate tables, the lighting makes you feel warm and cozy and so does the BBQ aroma that hits you when you walk in. The music has been a mix of classic rock and current which jives perfectly with the atmosphere. I only ever order one drink here, and it's called the green sleeve. It is a gin based cocktail that resembles a mojito to me. It is refreshing and delicious.  Now on to the main attraction, I know that's why you read all the crap before anyways... Ready?   EVERYTHING IS AMAZING. The cornbread comes with this sweet whipped honey butter, the brisket melts in your mouth, the chicken is so dang juicy you can just eat and eat and eat.   Want to know the best thing of all? After 10PM all the delicious succulent meat is 50% off. Whaaat? Yes. INDULGE friends. Be the primitive version of yourself and enjoy the feast!"}
{"text":"Broccoli salad was a nice healthy option. The meat though is what you'd be here for.  We tried the brisket, pulled pork, turkey breast, the links/sausage - my fav was brisket - great flavour and moist, then turkey - great flavour, lean; the links/sausage and finally pulled pork which were a little dry. Pair that with a nice savoury Caesar & the meal is accompanied well.  Great atmosphere - we were in the smaller quieter room. Friendly staff. Definitely would recommend this place for the brisket."}
{"text":"Okay food. But meat tasted off after a few minutes. The mac and cheese was the highlight of the night for me. The wings were very dry and hard to bite into. Only sauce worth using is the espresso. The other two had too much of a vinager/acidic taste to it. Didn't try anything else. I'll give this place 6 months until I go back, it's new so it does take time to get the hang of things."}
{"text":"Great place to get some authentic smoked meats. They also make their own BBQ sauce which is very good. If you're there after 10pm all meat is 1/2 price."}
{"text":"Being from Texas, I know my BBQ. Hayden Block does delivers on that account! I've tried most of the meats here now, and I have a hard time picking my favorite. Everything is smoked impeccably, has a great flavor, and is so juicy. If you're not feeling very adventurous, try the wings. They have a golden brown crispy skin that crunches when you bite into it them in the best way possible. If you want to try some true Texas BBQ, go for the brisket. Slow cooked to keep that moisture in, one bite and you'll fall in love with it. It's so tender and flavorful, you don't even need the sauces they have, but they make the meat even better!   Now that spring and summer is headed our way, the patios are back out too! A small one in the front and the back that lets you get the sun we need up here in the Great White North. The interior has that southern feel to it. All wood and metal. I really like it.   I'm going to enjoy going back to this spot over and over!"}
{"text":"The meat here is unreal, the restaurant really puts forward a best effort to make sure the meat is flavourful and tender. This ranks amongst my favourite, if not my absolute favourite in Calgary. The patio in the summer is next level too."}
{"text":"Cold ass beer and brisket that'll make you wanna slap yo mama. That is all. What else can I say? Oh yeah, the whiskey selection is choice and the meats are half price after 10pm."}
{"text":"One of my new favourite places! Great location, service, beer selection and food! It's a very casual relaxed place to go watch a game, but FYI they don't take reservations."}
{"text":"Went here for a family styled dinner, ordered  Brisket, pulled pork, macaroni salad, smoked stack corn, cornbread, honey butter, watermelon and mint salad (mango was under-ripe) with feta. Loved all of it. Great food and a wide selection of whiskeys and bourbons. This is the 2nd time I've been here and it was great food!"}
{"text":"Such a great place to go and get your meat fix!! I tried the brisket, turkey, bacon wrapped corn, watermelon salad and coleslaw. It was all gluten free and tasted amazing!"}
{"text":"I liked this restaurant overall, it has a warm vibe and casual atmosphere. The meat was fairly tasty. However the sides were of questionable quality - in my opinion, simple food does not have to be of poor quality. I would come again but strictly for the meat."}
{"text":"This whiskey bar is a perfect place for meat lovers. They have many barbecue meats and good taste whiskey cocktails. I suggest their beef briskets and whiskeys. And if you come after 10pm, they will have midnight discount, all the meat will be half priced!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch. Killer drink menu. We shared the beef bone, pork ribs, brisket, mac and cheese, rib ends and hush puppies. I really liked everything except the rib ends they were not very good, no smoke flavor, well not much flavor at all. Service was very good at first until I had to wait forever for our food while people around us which ordered after us were eating. This angers me greatly !!!  Kinda ruined it for me. Probably would not return due to pricey menu and aggravating service issue for us."}
{"text":"This is definitely a staple for Kensington, and with their 50% off meat after 10pm, it's hard not to be a frequent customer.   That being said, I would love some experimentation with the menu. I think I've gone through most of what they have to offer, and the variety at the moment isn't huge. On the other hand, their whisky and cocktail menu is so extensive that there is no shortage of drinks to try.   What saves this place for me is the service. The owner is personable, interested in what you have to say, and above all, welcoming.   As someone who eats here fairly regularly (either for lunch or late at night), I would love to see some menu items that experimented with smoked meat as an incorporated ingredient. All-in-all, Hayden Block has steadily become the go-to hangout place for me and my friends when we're in Kensington.   (P.S. Try the Espresso BBQ sauce! Buy a bottle for home! IMO it's miles ahead of their other two.)"}
{"text":"This was an amazing experience. It all started with the manager going out of his way to find out party of six a spot to sit. Service was very attentive and knowledgable. We order some meats, sides and trays to share. It's unfortunate they were out of brisket because based on the other meats I am sure the brisket is also phenomenal. Only thought was the casing on the hot links was pretty tough.   Turkey Breast- great seasoning and not dried out Pulled pork - good chew and flavour Pork ribs - not too tender and great rub Smoked wings - great Bacon wrapped corn - awesome Beet salad - great fresh flavour  Corn bread - really good (may have been better hot) Mac and cheese - best any of us have ever had Deep fried pickles - another hit at the table.   Do yourself a favour and check this place out great food, great atmosphere and great service."}
{"text":"food is similar to the Palimino ( i think the stole the cook from there), but its much classier and nicer inside then the palimino. Wait staff is decently attentive. whisky selection is exquisite."}
{"text":"I've been to Hayden block twice and both times I was disappointed in the service and the food. I usually give a restaurant more than 1 chance before I write a 1 star review. I really wanted to like Hayden block but I don't see myself going back a 3rd time, I can say I enjoyed the mac and cheese but thats about it. The cornbread was just so dry, I let the server know and she said thats how its supposed to be, little did she know I've been eating cornbread since I was a child and I know when its good or bad. And it was just bad. It was pretty hard to get her attention when we needed refills of water or when we wanted to get the bill."}
{"text":"Third time being here--twice on dates and a third time last week with my son! I cannot recommend it strongly enough--food is AMAZING! super delicious! the beef brisket, the pulled pork, the mac n cheese, the HOT MESS! YUM--every single bite is to die for! and Wes (16) adds: every single waitress is H O T!! (kids welcome until 8 pm due to liquor licence regs)"}
{"text":"I asked hubby where he wants to go for Father's Day and he said smokehouse, so after speaking with some friends they suggested Hayden Block.  I didn't like the fact that they don't take reservations (lining up with two young kids isn't that fun) but thought if I could go early enough to beat the dinner rush I should be ok.  We arrived around 6pm on Father's Day and was lucky enough to get a table.    Service was pretty quick and friendly for the most part, though I felt some of the servers looked at us awkwardly as we had our kids with us, yet they are family friendly up to a certain time... so I don't know what's the deal with that.  We ordered our drinks and food and didn't have to wait very long for them to arrive.  I will say I was pretty impressed with the food - brisket, hot link, deep fried pork belly and that giant short rib bone - really flavorful and tender! The salads were good as well - I found the mac and cheese a tad too cheesy and gooey for my taste.  What I liked the most was the corn bread - the honey butter was a perfect condiment to it!  Definitely great meats here - will be back!"}
{"text":"Classic, southern type of bar with a 90s cowboy vibe, with a taste of Westworld. Always appreciated the 1/2 price off for smoked meats after 10pm (you have to buy a drink along with this deal). Only had one experience when the meat was way too dry. Smoke rings are visible on the meat. Another plus is the wide assortment of whiskeys, bourbon and scotch. For late night cravings, this place does satisfy in terms of quantity, flavour and price. Thumbs up for service. Recommendations: Brisket, beef short ribs                               Smokey Old Fashioned Cocktail."}
{"text":"Excellent bbq place! Just like Texas. Is worth to wait. Food and service was excellent"}
{"text":"Love this place, some of the best BBQ and amazing sides. Not to mention a great assortment of whiskey and scotch and a great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"The food was excellent. I would say Hayden Block Smoke & Whiskey is one of the best barbecue joints in Calgary. I love how the place is set up; a little bit of outside seating and inside had long wooden tables with long benches.. Had a old western vibe to it which I personally enjoyed.  I came here with a group of friends (there was a total of 5 of us) and we ended up ordering almost one of everything. It was great, that way you can try everything and see what you do and don't like. At the end after splitting the bill between the 5 of us, it came up to be only $30 each.. And we were stuffed. We struggled to finish everything that we ordered.. the meat sweats were tooooo real. BUT the best sweats are meat sweats (am i right)  I highly recommend ordering the corn bread, hot links, watermelon & mint salad, and the pulled pork.  They also have happy hour starting at 10PM to close which is a great deal.. HALF OFF barbecue until they run out. Which is a steal! Even if you can't take out. Makes sense though why they don't allow that.  If you eat the corn bread and hot link together .. it tastes like a corn dog. It's amazing.  The service was great .. the selection of Whiskey is HUUUGE. Great barbecue.  I will definitely be back soon! I enjoyed every second of the experience."}
{"text":"Tried Hayden's recently and I enjoyed the food. The sliced beef brisket was flavourful. The pork ribs were super tender. I thought the meats were high quality and the cooking process was stellar. The seasoning on the meats were different from your usual Bookers/Palomino joint, but in a good, gourmet sort of way. The cornbread was yummy but the coleslaw I will pass on in the future. It was fine but I enjoyed the meats much, much more.   Portions are good for the amount they charge. The only issue was I ordered a Banded Peak beer but I'm positive I wasn't served the beer I ordered... Could happen anywhere and I'm sure if I said something, it would have been rectified."}
{"text":"Smoke & Whiskey - yup, that sums it up alright. BBQ and Whiskey -  Hayden Block picked the two best things on the planet, two things that Calgary wasn't even unfamiliar with, and then they taught us that we had no idea what we were missing. Where have you been my whole life?  *Smoke.* Through a quick conversation with Calgary yelper, MJ L., she told me that she's been looking for a BBQ place that doesn't \"hide their meat under the mop\" or in a way that I wouldn't immediately understand - bury it in BBQ sauce. For me, Hayden block is that kind of BBQ. I ordered the pulled pork. Each of the meats clock in at around $10 - $12 for a half pound and are served on a tray, in a pile along with some pickles and whatever side you happened to order. In this case I wen with the broccoli salad which showed up in a cute, red and white checker print paper tray next to the half pound pie of pork. While they've got three spectacular BBQ sauces in the middle of the table, House BBQ, Spicy Vinegar, and Espresso, I found that the meat was so deliciously complex on its own that I didn't want to mask it's wood smoke flavours with any kind of sauce, no matter how good. What kind of mind games are you playing with me, Hayden Block? You give me BBQ sauces unlike anything I've ever set my tongue upon, and then you give me BBQ so good I don't even want to touch it. You're messing with my emotions and you know it!  *Whiskey* I think Calgary finally has a whiskey bar! There are others in town, sure, but I haven't seen any menus that have really encouraged me to dive in and drink straight whiskey that I've never tried in the same way that Hayden Block's does. They have whiskies from around the globe, listed by country but all on the same page. I like this because it makes it really easy to globe trot in the way of whiskey (or whiskey). Canada was fun, let's head on south to the states, time to hop across the pond to Scotland and then all the way out east to see what the Japanese have been up to. I stuck to cocktails this time around, but I'm really looking forward to going on a world whiskey tour. With a 1/2 price whiskey happy hour, how could you not?  *Sides* They've got communal seating which makes for a social atmosphere. See a group of two sitting at a table for six? Just go on over, introduce yourself and take a seat.  TVs - There's a lot of them. Seriously Calgary, can we please get over the need to have a line of giant TVs lined up next to each other playing the same damn thing? How awesome your bar is is not directly proportionate to the number of TVs you have. It's not impressive, can we please knock this off? I understand full well at this time of year it doesn't matter if you're a sports bar or not, the NHL playoffs have to be on - but does having whatever random news channel on mute really add to anyone's social whiskey drink experience? Maybe when there's nothing of importance on, these could be utilized for something cool that adds to the experience.  The cocktails were damn exceptional... Most of the time. There's so many bartenders back there, and being new, there's still some serious inconsistencies. Order it once  and it's bold, whiskey forward with a big punch of spicy pepper. Order it a second time and it's mild, sweet, and even comes with a sugar rim. I'm sure it was the same ingredients, but these were two very different drinks. I hope this get worked out over the upcoming months, because Hayden block has the potential to be a quality cocktail bar to boot."}
{"text":"Great food! The atmosphere is amazing. I left very satisifed with the food. Went on extremely busy night so the service was a bit slow, which is expected. If you want good BBQ in YYC check out this place."}
{"text":"there's nothing bad to say here. I can't even pretend to be nit picky and say something not nice about this amazing spot. Very reasonably priced, humongous portions, delicious and very authentic American barbecue, and the in-house sauces are totally divine. the staff is knowledgeable and passionate without being that irritating in your face hipster staff where they're overselling and overchatting, but they answered our questions and checked in often.   We tried some cocktails too - damn good. any place that is going to use Tito's in their sweet tea is very okay in my books. Will definitely be back. hopefully soon, too."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing. Their side dishes and their meats are mouthwatering.  Their slow cooked ribs are the best in town. Its a busy place so when you go with a big group its harder to find a table.  We actually waited for almost an hour to get a table. But because of the food no complain, it was all worth it. Their servers are superb, very accommodating.  Highly Recommended place for bbq lovers. You will not regret the wait."}
{"text":"I eat a lot of texas bbq.  Found hayden block to be pretty authentic.  Brisket is very tender, smoky and juicy.  House bbq sauce was pretty good too.  Like that they give you wonder bread like in texas.  too bad no pickles and onions and sides are pricey.  also got smoked rib ends.  not much meat and pretty boney.  Very different from what I get in the US.  Would visit again though for 1/2 price late night."}
{"text":"I love Hayden Block's a la carte setup: meats are priced per the half pound or unit, basic sides $4 each and bigger sides are priced per tray. This set up is great for trying multiple items in a shared group.  On a visit with myself and one other person, we ordered a 1/2 lb each of the beef brisket and pork spare ribs, smoked wings bacon wrapped corn, green beans and deep fried pickles. As well, we paid the $1 upcharge for the cornbread with honey butter rather than the free white bread. For $54 total, this was a generous amount of food for two people with big appetites and could have easily fed three people. The meats were all tender and delicious with a lovely smoked flavour. Of the sides, the bacon wrapped corn and the green beans (which come topped with bacon and fried onions) were particularly delicious.     The restaurant is small, but with big picnic bench style seating, they can host a large number of people. I appreciate that, rather than coating the meats in BBQ in the kitchen, a selection of housemade sauces are offered on the table including a house blend, espresso blend and carolina vinegar."}
{"text":"Super yummy and affordable! I had a bad experience with brisket and didn't try it and I kicked myself after! My friend got it and it was melt in your mouth delicious. Also got smoked wings and ribs, potatoes salad, bacon wrapped corn, and corn on the cob (between my boyfriend and I) and it was really really good. $40 meal with no alcohol! Will be back :)"}
{"text":"The drinks and food here were awesome. Ordered the pulled pork, best I've had in the city. There's an entire menu just for whiskey, so if you're a whiskey drinker this is the place for you. They also had a selection of BBQ sauces to add to your meal, tried a bit of all of them and they were all very tasty. The portions for the food are quite large so go with an empty stomach!"}
{"text":"I've been been here a few times now and the food is always great! My favorite is the Brisket. The menu is short and straight to the point so you don't have to flip through pages and pages to figure out what you want.  If whiskey is your thing their knowledge of whiskey goes unmatched in the city! Great food, great whiskey and great staff. You can't beat it!"}
{"text":"I don't often eat meat but today, I did so with delight - when I went for lunch with friends.  I enjoyed every bite of meat (which is pretty good for a girl who doesn't prefer meat at all) - the pulled pork, pickles, both beet and broccoli salads and the chips and queso.  I got to try the turkey and brisket off my friends trays- super delicious.  Loved the smoked meat, prefer that preparation over being hidden or slathered in any sauce- but have house sauces there if you wish.  Our server was very attentive and lovely.  The owner even popped by to give me the best news- this place is kid friendly!! I can bring my crazy carnivorous, 7 and 10 year old boys here!!  Yay!!!  Kensington is really becoming a destination for neat restaurants, so happy (and helps I live up the hill!)."}
{"text":"Wonderful food and amazing atmosphere. We had the brisket, smokehouse corn, and broccoli salad. Service was also excellent."}
{"text":"Here's the deal. The food is excellent. It's the best BBQ in Calgary. The 50% off meats after 10:00pm is excellent. BUT there is a big glaring problem and this latest time I went (June 12) it bothered me enough that I just didn't leave a tip. It is the rule that you aren't allowed to take that discounted food to go if you don't finish it all at the restaurant. There are several reasons this is a major problem that prompted me to write my very first restaurant review:  1. The rule is not advertised anywhere. It's not up on the wall. It's not in the menu. A first-time visitor would discover this only at the end of their meal when they've decided they can't finish all of their ribs. The customer will ask for a box like they would at any other restaurant and then be told they're not allowed to take it out. I don't think that new customer would appreciate that.  2. The rule is applied inconsistently. I've been to Hayden Block enough times to know that some servers bring to-go boxes without hesitating. And then there are others who follow the rule. So which is it!?  3. The reason I was given for the rule was because people were taking advantage of the 50% off discount. I guess they were ordering food to stay and then boxing it up within minutes to go home. That doesn't make sense. There's already another rule that requires customers to buy a drink in order to get that deal. I should add that rule ALSO isn't written anywhere and it has been inconsistently applied. So if I'm required to buy a drink in order to have the meat at 50% off, then it's pretty obvious I'm not going to just take the food to go.  4. It's a total waste of food. We asked a guy who looked like a manager what they're going to do with the food. He straight up said it would be thrown out. He wouldn't budge on bringing us a to-go box so we conceded. Then he just picked up the tray and took it to the back. What restaurant would just allow food to be wasted? That's literally throwing money in the trash. So I, as a customer, don't get to keep the product I pay for and the fine meat that was used is just thrown away. And now my girlfriend is actually considering never going again. That's a hit on your business. Imagine we were first time customers. That's one and done.  I'd like to say again I did not leave a tip this time to really drive the point home. The server claimed too many people were taking advantage of the rule. I don't even know what that means. Again, I'm assuming they don't like that people aren't staying to buy drinks or more food or whatever. But for my girlfriend and myself, this time we bought a drink, we bought sides and we sat in the restaurant for 45 minutes to an hour. The server came around multiple times to check on us so she should've known we weren't there to cheat the system.   It's just disappointing. I've been there multiple times after 10:00 and paid full price to take food to-go. That's how much I love the food. But this rule about not being allowed to take leftovers home sucks and I hope you really think about changing it."}
{"text":"Came to Calgary without much of a plan and started searching places to eat close to downtown. I'm so glad we gave this spot a shot!  Jordan was our server who looked out for us from the second we walked in and he saw us waiting for space at the bar. He offered his suggestions, checked in on us and was such a gem!  The smoked chicken wings were truly the best wings I've ever had. The maple ice cream was amazing. Amazing. Stop by for sure! You might have to wait, but it was worth it."}
{"text":"Deep fried pickles were great, as is the beer menu. However, Mac and cheese came out pretty cold even after we sent it back. Then as I took a sip of beer, the bottom fell out of my glass, covering me in beer. Vanessa, our server, was absolutely fantastic in dealing with it though and went the extra mile to make up for it! Thanks Vanessa, you are great!"}
{"text":"Went in around 9.30 and saw that after 10 meats were half price. That is a great deal. The place has a great ambiance and the service is great. The drink menu is quite extensive. We tried the brisket, the short rib, three cheese mac and cheese and the corn bread. Everything was presented well, but a certain oomph was missing. Not sure if it's the fact that the house sauces were too runny or the brisket was sliced too thick. The mac and cheese was nice, very creamy, but the paper dish kinda killed the vibe.The winner of the night was the short rib. It fell off the bone and was extremely flavourful. The drinks were great and the prices are reasonable. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Delicious BBQ, it's one of Hubs favourite places so whenever the BBQ craving hits this is where we go. Very reasonably priced and I always leave stuffed. The items are great for sharing and I recommend getting a few different things, usually, 2 types of meat and a few sides with some cornbread hits the spot for us. The meat is tender and delicious, you can taste the time and effort that went into cooking it, then I smother it in the house made BBQ sauce (Espresso is my favourite) and you've got yourself one delicious meal."}
{"text":"With peace and love,  Texas BBQ in Calgary. Who would have thought. I was initially reserved about this idea actually workings in Calgary. I love Texas. The people and the food are something everyone should experience in their lifetime. I'm just not sure Calgary is ready for it; or would understand it.   Our waitress was less than amazing. I asked her how best to experience this place for the first time. Meat or sandwich? Answer: that depends if you like bread or not. She must be taking an astrophysics degree.  They were out of half the things on the menu. No cornbread should be an offence punishable by 100 lashes.   Order came out with the wrong side but was fixed promptly. Time to get into things.   The BBQ sauces were good but I prefer the original. I don't feel that the espresso style sauce really did anything amazing for me. Spicy vinegar wasn't. The original was good stuff.   Baked beans are first up for flogging. Though I expected things to fall down here, they didn't. This dish comes in a paper bowl because, fuck the environment. Great taste though. Would recommend.   My partner in from got a macaroni salad side that was like prison food.  Pulled pork sandwich was, in my opinion, a solid 6/10. In Texas things are piled high and this was not. The flavour of the meat was great, but they are certainly liberal on their application of it on the bun. I fundamentally disagree with their bun to coleslaw to meat ratio.  I think in retrospect our waitress really should have leaned towards the 1/2 pound of meat as a start. It would have helped me really have an educated opinion on how well they did things.   My suggestions.   1. Pile it high. Texas doesn't fuck around. 2. Find a way to be more environmentally respectful with your side dish packaging.  3. Remind your staff there are worse things in life working in a BBQ whiskey bar.   I hope to try this again when they've been around for a few months. I think great things will happen here knowing the group behind this restaurant."}
{"text":"Carnivores rejoice!! Hayden Block serves yummy meats 'Murcian style.   They don't take reservations but I've never had a problem getting a table right away. If the front patio is too exposed to the street for you, there's another enclosed one in the back of the restaurant.   The first time I went, it was on a Wednesday at 6 pm. Their wings were half off but we got the smoked half chicken and 1/2 lb of beef brisket instead. I love that you can customize your sides with awesome choices like homemade potato salad, broccoli salad, and the bacon wrapped corn is TO DIE FOR.   The prices are extremely reasonable! The brisket and chicken were $12 each. Each side is $4 and they offer free white bread too!!   I've also had their 10 pm happy hour menu and while it's a great deal, the meats were cold and not as moist. I know it's half off it's they're trying to get rid of their stock but it's disappointing that they don't maintain the same quality throughout the night.   Anyway, I love Hayden Block and you should too!"}
{"text":"We love this place.  After frequenting many bbq spots in the Southern USA, we may be connoisseurs of fine bbq.     We have been here 4x since it opened and will continue to go back.    Why it's great?  1. made from scratch meats 2. great (southern sides) ie. mac and cheese, corn bread 3. half price meats after 10pm 4. solid cocktail selection 5. TV's everywhere to keep on top of your sports 6. communal seating, so be friendly!"}
{"text":"Finally! A smokehouse in Calgary and it's good. They offer baby back ribs, pulled pork, brisket and chicken as some of thejr regular meat dishes. These are all slow roasted and fresh. You would swear you're in the heart of Texas when you taste their meat. There are three sauces on the table if you want more spice. Some of the people in my group had a gluten allergy and the kitchen assured us that one of the sauces was gluten free (along with the meat). Drinks are novel and interesting. Along with the usual whiskey and beers. Great tip: come at 10 pm to get meat dishes at half price. They may have run out of some items but they want to clear out the kitchen for the next round of fresh meat to be served the next day. Their sides were good, especially the beans and coleslaw. The biscuits were a bit dry and the potato salad was not great. Try the deep fried pickles as an appetizer. Yum!!  Love the banquet-style dining set up. Complaint: very noisy and hard to hear the people at your table. There are two outdoor eating spaces = quieter. I was worried when they opened given the tough economy but they have a great menu, tasty drinks and a pleasant waitstaff."}
{"text":"Very impressed with their food, especially the briskets. And the whiskey selection here is exceptional! And the ambience is truly shabby chic!"}
{"text":"AMAZING AMAZING AMAZING FOOD + VIBE + SERVICE.  I visited this restaurant while I was in Calgary and while there are a lot of restaurant options, I wanted to try some BBQ (and I highly recommend anyone visiting Calgary to put it on your list). This place is located in hipster Kensington and since I was headed that way anyways, we decided to try it out.   Anyways, when I walked in, I already loved the vibe, It's very chill with a beautiful bar, loud but not overly loud music, long tables with bench seating, and friendly faces. The menu was a little hard to navigate because I didn't quite know what some of the items were... no description available. But let me just say this. GET THE BABY BACK RIBS. JUST DO IT. It's so crazy good! And the wings.. LOVE! We also got the watermelon and feta salad, which I'm not really a fan of just because I don't like the strong smell of feta. And the macaroni and cheese was pretty good but got too heavy after the first few bites. The drinks here are strong. I got one whisky drink and you don't have to wonder where the alcohol went in this place. It's in my cup!! I could totally feel it after a few sips. Or maybe that's just how they do it in Calgary. Anyways, fantastic meal for 3 for under $100 with drinks. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The food is fabulous southern BBQ with large sides that are great for sharing. I've gone for lunch a handful of times."}
{"text":"The food was only okay and basic but I don't think one really goes here for food. That was my mistake. I was mostly just attracted by the crowd. There was a big crowd out in the front patio and in the back too. The alcohol selection was fairly extensive. I had nachos and queso, it was okay but would've liked real nachos. My friend had a pork sandwich and she seemed to enjoy it. The servers were kind and attentive so no complain there"}
{"text":"Was invited to try some of their menu items recently with a friend and immediately felt comfortable the moment I walked in. Several long tables are in the main dining area giving this restaurant a homey, good eats type feel. Their menu consists of good old southern style barbecue and smoked meat including sides and small bites.  You can order dishes individually to share or find something on the menu that suits just you. The whiskey menu is extensive and impressive. Beer, wine and cocktails are also available for those who do not like to partake in whiskey.  The servers were friendly and we really enjoyed our time here. Totally left with the #meatsweats (that's a good thing) and planning our return trip soon.  They do not take reservations and allow kids until 8pm."}
{"text":"Awesome place great staff great food great neighbourhood.  Would recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Woooow the best BBQ place in Calgary so far! Worth the wait. Excellent food and service. And the beer is fantastically chilled"}
{"text":"First time there and it was a great experience! We went after 10pm for the half off on meats. We had the beef brisket, pulled pork and pork ribs. And at a fantastic deal like that, it was awesome! We got too many items which left it dry in the end so eat fast! There was some pickled cucumbers, onion and pepper that was added to the platter which I thought was just a soggy addition to the platter but once I tried it I thought it was a good addition, just wished there was more! Over all a solid experience. Will come again!"}
{"text":"Best meat I've ever shoved in my hole. I pierced a rib and more juice came out than halftime at a synagogue."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times and I love their brisket and corn bread. Not a fan of some of their BBQ sauces, but I do enjoy their specially espresso BBQ sauce. Not a place I'd go for drinks, as it can be pricey but great food. Also good if you just want to enjoy a fine glass of whiskey."}
{"text":"Enjoyed our experience here. Only negative was the noise,  we had a hard time hearing what the server had to say.  Anyhow our party of four each ordered something different to share. There were 3 sauces vinegar,  a house sauce and an espresso on the side. The pulled pork, brisket, ribs and turkey were all good without adding sauce. That is something I appreciate, lots of BBQ places just slather some sweet sauce on just to cover a sub par product. Not the case here.   One of the better BBQ joints in Calgary    PS good whiskey and beer selection too. Unfortunately they were out of the beer I ordered."}
{"text":"Walked in on a Tuesday around 5:30pm to meet a buddy. It wasn't very loud and there were TV screens with sports on. It got louder as the evening went on and the place filled up. The atmosphere is relaxed and the selection of whiskey is fantastic!  We ordered frito pie to start which is Frito corn chips with pulled pork and rib meat, beans and sauce. It was deelish and a hearty meal for one person!  I had the beef short rib with bacon wrapped corn on the cob and my friend had brisket with potato salad. My rib was huge!  Clearly dinosaurs are still roaming the badlands and being slaughtered n smoked for our pleasure  the photo does not do it justice but it took me 2 meals to finish. The brisket was so moist n tender and my corn was nicely done although would have liked if the bacon had a seared crispiness. It was mostly chewy. The potato salad was average.   If you love smoked, tender meat, come here! I will return to try other menu items like chicken and pulled pork. We had an amazing, unrushed time and   so happy that we've found a place that does meat right!!!"}
{"text":"Came here for an informal little yelper meet up and met some very cool people and had some very cool whiskey cocktails. Amanda v. Ordered the vodka sweet tea, as she was stirring her drink a fine gentleman Ian (might possibly be know as Ron Swanson) came over and asked if she liked it. Amanda felt the bitters were to strong for her, he promptly went over and made her a drink without the bitters and she loved it. Thanks again Ian for making sure the picky love of my life enjoyed her drink. Now the food...WOW we had some spare ribs and they were amazing, very juicy super tender and fall off the bone. Because this was a small yelp meet we got a tour to see the smoker and all the hard working kitchen staff putting the great food out. I will return! I must try some MOAR!!! Thanks to our waitress also, I didn't get her name but she kept track of way to much for a mortal! Great job all around! Thanks Dale for the invite."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge fan of brisket, but this will knock your socks off! Smoked for 16 hours, and extremely tender, and flavourful!Cocktails are not of the sweetest kind but still great! Great selection of whiskey and Ben who I think is the owner was friendly and interactive!! Service was great, I'm sorry forgot the name of the server!!Only thing I didn't like was noise level! But all was great!! Thanks Dale for the invite! Love exploring new places!"}
{"text":"Loved the group tables and the atmosphere - great selection of whiskey and the brisket and jalapeño cornbread were so delicious!"}
{"text":"Hayden Block is a Texas BBQ joint located on Kensington Road NW. I've been meaning to visit but haven't had the chance until my friend who had previously tried Hayden asked if I wanted to go there for dinner.  Parking in Kensington is always a pain, especially right on Kensington Road but if you're lucky, you'll catch someone leaving just as you are about to drive by. It was a Thursday just after 7PM and this place was bumpin'! They have some seating outside and the seating inside is long bench style, so you'll likely be sitting with others. Their menu is simple, they offer meat by the  1/2 lb, or meat 'by the each', sides as well as trays which as larger sides. I let O order because he knew what was good. He had mentioned that the turkey was really good but they happen to be out! :( We went with  1/2 lb of brisket and  1/2 of a chicken, a tray of mac and cheese, and a half trays of beet and watermelon salad.   Everything came out all on one tray and it looked great! The brisket came with two pieces, perfectly marbled with fat to make it even more tender, yum!!! The half chicken was nicely season, skin wasn't crispy but still delicious, meat was tender. Both meats were nice and juicy with that perfect smoky flavor. They have three sauces at the table: spicy vinegar, house bbq, and espresso if you wanted more flavor. I tried them all and I liked the house bbq the most but I would prefer no sauce because the meats have a great taste already. The mac and cheese was topped with some bread crumbs and it was so cheesy, it went well as a side for the meat. The beet and watermelon mint salads were cool and refreshing. The watermelon mint salad had some pieces of mango inside which was a nice surprise.  Our server was sweet, she filled our waters and asked how everything was. The food was really tasty. I was telling O that Hayden felt like a place where all the guys came to have a bro night. Have some whiskey and order meat by the  1/2 lbs, and just hang out. I got that vibe too, and I felt that there were mostly men in the restaurant too!  Overall, it's a great BBQ joint in Calgary with an awesome ambience where you can kick back and relax after a long day of work or hit up during the weekend for some delicious protein and carbs!  Oh, they offer brunch on the weekends! Ohhhh ohhh, all meat is HALF PRICE after 10pm!!! You're welcome ;)"}
{"text":"This is a true whisky bar  but the meat was covered in salt and pepper and that was all you tasted not a good experience won't go back"}
{"text":"Oh my dear Brisket, you and I shall be together again !"}
{"text":"Well what can I say.  Great place for anything meat or whisky.  Great friendly and attentive staff.  If you're a vegetarian and looking to convert to meat eating, one bite of the brisket should do the trick.  Just out of this world.  They also offer great deals on certain days like Wednesday when their smoked chicken wings are 1/2 off.  Pretty much moved into the neighbourhood just to be close to this great place!"}
{"text":"1. Location: 4/5 On busy street. Parking lot is not available. Need to pay to park on the street for 2hr max. 2. Atmosphere: 4.5/5 Open, casual, family gathering, but has a great bar with a team of wondeful friendly and professional bartenders. Do not mis-judge them that this place is only for the adults. 3. Quality: 4.7/5 Highly recommend to sit on the bar. Ask bartenders for recommendations for beers. You will have samples. They have wonderful selections of beers and wiskies as well. Just try but do not drunk drive!!! 4. Taste: 4.9/5 OMG! So good meats ans sides!!! 5. Price: 4.5/5 Not cheap but it is worth for every pennies. ### Of course...Strongly Recommend!!!!"}
{"text":"As a backyard BBQ aficionado, we're always on the lookout for good meat. I've had BBQ all over town and Hayden BY FAR gets the gold. Our favorite is the brisket but everything is phenomenal. The ribs are juicy, not dry like some other places in town. The sides are great too, and of course the huge selection of whiskey and bourbon from all over the world is amazing too. Knock yourself out."}
{"text":"Food was excellent. Super loud but good atmosphere. Had the brisket which was like butter and the green beans were crisp and most enjoyable."}
{"text":"Had a guest in front Toronto and I think she said it best when she said she's traveled, singing to Blues and eating BBQ and this joint hit the spot. The vibe is relaxed albeit loud and the shared seating was comfortable rather than crowded. Full house the entire night that we could see but they texted when they were reassured for us and it was shorter wait time then expected. What to order? We had the turkey - wonderfully moist with a succulent flavour and the pulled pork - not overly fatty and with the great little crispy ends bits that I adore. We also ordered the sausage and the ribs and the beet salad and watermelon mint salad and the coleslaw. Well if we were going to check it out we must be thorough . We also had the corn bread - muffin actually. The corn muffin was only further enchanted by honey butter. Yum! The ribs were thick and fully of flavour and the salads were fresh and plentiful. We presented enough to have a meal tomorrow for five more people. Impressed."}
{"text":"Wow... this place was amazing! Highly recommend! If you are questioning whether to try this place; question no further! You NEED to try it!   I came to Calgary for vacation and I decided to do some research on some restaurants before I landed. I saw on Pinterest that a few people recommended this place. So we decided to try it out for dinner one night.  BBQ and southern soul food is easily my favorite thing in the world. I was shocked when I had tried their brisket. It was melt in your mouth delicious. Words cannot describe how amazing it actually was! I live in Nevada and we have quite a few good BBQ restaurants but Hayden Block has blown every single one of them away. We loved this place so much we came back the next day for lunch. We had ordered the Brisket, Mac and cheese, corn bread, and the smokehouse corn. Everything we ordered was great.   The location of this restaurant is perfect because their are all types of shops surrounding the restaurant. The inside of the restaurant is super badass. I wish I had a photo of the inside. Take my word for it because it's super cool. They have so many different types of whisky lined up at the bar and they have the biggest cow skull I have ever seen! You would think you're eating at a BBQ restaurant in Texas!  This place is great! Wish we had one in Vegas!"}
{"text":"I'm writing this review as someone who doesn't eat meat.  The secret is out about Hayden Block! You're going to have to wait for a seat nearly every evening, but especially Thursday-Saturday. I've heard there's a 10 pm meat rush for the half priced deal.  Happy hour is an excellent value especially on the whiskey cocktails. Come early in warm months and see if you can get a spot on the back patio, or the front patio if you prefer to watch the bustle of Kensington go past. It's easily the busiest spot in the neighbourhood and it can get loud inside. I like a seat at the bar for a snack and a drink in winter.  There are some delicious non meat options: $1 jalapeño cornbread is amazing, the queso and chips is pricy but SO GOOD, the mac and cheese is solid (get it without bacon on top obvs), and the watermelon salad is totally decent.  My only hope is that they eventually start smoking salmon for us pescatarians."}
{"text":"In from Texas where I can eat Barbecue everyday. What to have for supper tonight?  Well, after reading some reviews we settled here. I sat at the bar.  Whiskey heaven. The gentleman next to me was enjoying a half beef rib, daily soup.  Being spoiled on Brisket and looking at a few pics and then live plates, the brisket just didn't look right.  The rib though, oh boy. Coming from Texas and thinking I'd be happy with the brisket, I'd be fooling myself.   I went for the rib.  Change it up albeit. Yes, the soup of the day and 1 piece of cornbread. The rib was good to great. A little peppery but not too much. Plenty of meat to share with the pepper. Moist.  The soup, vegetable. I've never had a better vegetable soup.  They have to use beef stock.   Cornbread.  Well, its cornbread. $1 for a piece.  Eh, definitely a money maker.  Then to charge $0.50 for the honey butter........ serious?!  I had a local brew.  Goat something. Pretty darn good.   In the end, I was full.  I'd definitely return."}
{"text":"Loved this place.  The meat was right on par with eating plates in Texas. Get the brisket,  yum! On top of that their custom cocktails are extremely tasty. I would highly recommend the Manhattan. It has that perfect bite with a bit of sweet. They also have a huge  selection of whiskey too. Very friendly staff and made me feel welcome."}
{"text":"I've been here in a group and just in a date and every time we come, it's great.  Cocktails are a bit pricey compared to the other bars/restaurants on 17th. I get the lemonade and it's $12. But coming during their happy hour which I think is 4--6 for whiskey is such a great deal. The five of us usually get 1/2 pound of brisket, chicken wings (salt and pepper are awesome.) Mac and cheese, smokestack corn, and the broccoli salad to share. It's definitely more than enough food for the five of us. We've also gotten to try a newer menu item the \"hot mess\" which doesn't have a description on the menu so you have to ask. It's a sweet potato with brisket, sour cream, cheese and (I think) green onion. ITS AMAZING. If you are even thinking of trying it, DO IT.  Coming during their late night happy hour (after 10) is awesome, although you gamble with seating/meats being available. If you can, half price meats with a purchase of a drink (doesn't need to be alcoholic) is great. The only real negative is that they don't actually have a hostess stand, and sometimes she's doing something else so you end up standing in the doorway, a bit unsure if you need to seat yourself or if there's a waitlist. That can be a bit confusing when it's busy. Sometimes service can be a bit slow but it honestly doesn't put any damper on the overall experience.  One of our favorite places to go to when people visit!"}
{"text":"The good - this place is awesome family friendly. The service is amazing. The patios are super cool. The staff are on point. Food is usually good but not mind blowing.  The bad - It's never consistent. We had two completely different orders of Queso an hour apart. It was like we were at a different restaurant. The sauces are good but a traditional bbq sauce is also needed. Pulled pork and ribs are usually really great but can also be too dry."}
{"text":"Delicious barbecue, quick service, and a fun open space!   Came here as a group of 4 at ~8pm on Tuesday night and grabbed a high top table near the outdoor back area. It was seat yourself and we had no wait, probably because it was on the later side. I had a light raspberry beer that was pretty good, and our table ordered several items to share for dinner: watermelon mint salad, corn, mac and cheese + bacon, fried pickles, brisket, half chicken, ribs, and pulled pork. It was actually a perfect amount of food, and came out very quickly!!   Everything was delicious.... the watermelon mint salad nice and light, the smokestack corn very rich and comparable to a mac and cheese texture, the mac and cheese itself just so creamy and delicious. The fried pickles were mediocre -- the pickle part and fried batter part separated so it seemed like we were really eating two discrete components. The meats were also all very good. My favorite was the ribs :) definitely a hearty, great meal!"}
{"text":"So here's the deal with HB: atmosphere? Great! Food? Spectacular! Service? WTF! I have been in the service industry in Calgary for many years and to date, this has to be one of the most pretentious and inconsistent services around. We have never had a manager treat or speak to us so poorly nor had servers roll their eyes when we order more drinks...is that not what you want? Oh - I'm sorry for bothering you to add to your tips for the evening...I recommend this place for the location and food only. If you go, I hope you are lucky to have better service than we have had - the only reason we keep going back is the food."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, service, and the price is right. I was looking for something different than pizza or burgers for dinner. I was running on little sleep too, so something quick and easy was needed.  My family found a great outdoor back patio table, ordered quickly, and enjoyed the delicious food. The BBQ food is smoked for many hours, and we ordered pork spare ribs and brisket. It fell off the bone, and didn't have much fat or inedible pieces. We ordered the Vonnegut whiskey drink (slightly spicy), the mule (perfect ginger taste), two salads, sides, and corn bread.  Some of the items on the menu are gluten free (brisket and baked beans, among others). I loved this place and would come back."}
{"text":"I've been waiting a while before checking this place out. I wanted the hype of a new establishment to cool down to get an accurate read of the place. We stopped in on a Sunday afternoon and sat at the bar. If you are into whiskey or bourbon this is your joint. I'm partial to gin and vodka myself, but they can accommodate with a few cocktails. I would suggest the Greensleeves for gin drinkers. I also tried the frito pie as a snack (fritolay chips, beans, queso, and brisket). It's their take on nachos. It was delicious and hit the spot for $10. Sunday special is a Caesar (vodka or gin) for $5.50. I tried one and thought it was tasty, but went down too fast. I will be back to try the main menu.  Pluses: friendly service, large whisk(e)y and bourbon menu, lots on draft, clean premises.  Minuses: waste on the pours, don't take reservations, few gin/vodka choices"}
{"text":"Discovered that all their meats are half off after 10pm! Who could resist?! We got several different kinds and shared around the table. Everything was delicious and presented well. Fantastic selection of whiskey for those that like to partake! Decent prices for the after 10 deal, though it would be fairly pricey anytime before."}
{"text":"Tried a sampling of the meats and sides. The brisket is out of this world delicious. I could eat my weight in burnt ends. The Mac & Cheese and Jalapeño Cornbread were great!  The Old-Fashioned was the best I've ever had.   Camped the Peach Cobbler and Pecan Pie for dessert - both tasted exactly like they do down south in the USA."}
{"text":"Excellent BBQ, great selection and a live joint!  Just about as good but not quite on the same level as some of my favorites back in NYC, but much better BBQ than Bookers.  Trying to get in on a Saturday night is going to cost you quite some time, but I found it worth the ~45 minute wait.  Got the pulled pork, pork spare ribs, half chicken, and a side of broccoli salad for $46 - awesome deal.  Ribs were the star of the show, and hard to believe but the broccoli salad might've come in second!  To add to your meal, every single one of their sauces was mouthwatering, the espresso was truly unique."}
{"text":"Full disclosure, I have only been here after 9 pm for their last call meats; where their meats are 50% off! Absolutely the best time to go for their food.   We had a bit of everything - brisket, sausages and pulled pork. We also had some of their sides, including the cornbread and fried pickles. The meats are pretty amazing though! Everything is well flavoured, smokey and juicy. In particular, the brisket is to die for. It has a nice tasty edge and is juicy and smokey. So delicious!   Drinks were also very good! My favourite is the Tennesse mule, which I hardly ever see served! Delicious.   Servers were friendly, but a little overworked and therefore hard to catch. They also often forgot our waters, but were clearly running around busy. They were otherwise very knowledgeable and friendly.   In terms of seating, there is plenty of benches and tables. You may have to share a table with strangers, but it's all good. In the evenings, this place does fill up quickly, so there may be a wait. Unfortunately, there isn't really a waiting area, as they've made use of all their space for seating."}
{"text":"Excellent service & food! Bonus: 1/2 price protein after 10:00 pm! Very attentive service at the bar."}
{"text":"This place is in the old location that was once occupied by Yardhouse.  It has been revamped into a much more hipster and cool BBQ and whiskey joint.  They take both elements seriously.   I tried two whiskey cocktails and enjoyed both. The mixology for each drink involved multiple elements that came together to make for some fun drinks.  You can tell care and craft went into their making.   I tried way too many things. Seriously. Criminal almost.  Some were shared though. I'm not lying.   The hush puppies are a must order. The honey butter takes them over the top to crazy delicious land.  The queso dip should be consumed quickly. Not my fav item.  The corn bread is spicy jalapeño deliciousness but not crazy hot. But I like spice.  The brisket was super tender and my fav BBQ sauce was the house followed by espresso. The other was a little too much vinegar. But you got to try them all.   The Broccoli salad was crispy and featured lots of bacon. Nice \"light\" side-lol  All in all, a more than solid  BBQ meal and enough happy belly moments to require another visit:)"}
{"text":"I like BBQ. I like whiskey. I like patios. Sooo, hell yes, I really like Hayden Block.   My Calgary comrade and I were recently strolling around Kensington a little bit hungover when we realized my baby had fallen asleep. We both knew we needed to find a little hair of the dog, stat, and our trusty Yelp app made it clear that Hayden was our man.  We snuggled up on their sunny back patio and enjoyed the brisket, cornbread, a few cocktails (Green Sleeves is particularly refreshing), and some rib ends. Delightful.   I think you and Hayden could be BFFs, so go call on him."}
{"text":"Food was served fast and lots of it for the price.  Drinks and food were well priced and the selection for drinks was plentiful.  The pulled pork sandwich and salt and pepper wings are winners!"}
{"text":"This food is out of this world. I have had brisket all over the place and this is by far the best brisket it's cooked perfectly nice and tender it's not overcooked so that it falls apart into string it is amazing a barbecue sauces are great fantastic and wonderful. The sides perfectly priced all of the proportions are right on the money the bacon wrapped corn amazing. Their selection of bourbon as the name would suggest his incredible this place is ridiculously good and I will obviously be back here in the future prices are perfectly reasonable for the portion size while it is a little bit loud if you want to go out with some friends this is the place to go loved it loved every minute check this place out immediately."}
