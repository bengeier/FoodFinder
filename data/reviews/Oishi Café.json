{"text":"Tried this place about 5 months ago and now I'm a regular.  Owner is friendly and accommodating.  Food is always very tasty!  I don't write many reviews but felt it appropriate to give them a shout out.  There has been a shooting or two in the area but in my opinion, this food is worth the risk."}
{"text":"Spicy bourbon chicken, orange chicken, and chicken wing are very delicious, price is very affordable."}
{"text":"Their bourbon chicken is now a weekly craving for me! It's Oishi! I might try the spicy bourbon chicken next. A coworker had the steak hibachi and he thought it was just ok and regretted not getting the bourbon chicken. IMO it's equal if not better than South Park malls bourbon chicken.(don't remember the name of the place)"}
{"text":"This was my first time coming here. The staff was very friendly. The restaurant is really clean, don't let the location turn you away. I had the hibachi chicken and it was great, very well cooked and seasoned. My boyfriend had the wings and rice, which was also super tasty. Food is also well priced. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Not a fancy place by any means, but that does not mean that you should avoid, as the staff is very friendly and that can make all the difference. Dishes were served quickly and piping hot (in fact, had to let cool for a bit), and no big surprises when it came to the meal, but the real winner here is the tempura appetizer - it was a monstrous box of fresh fried veggies, so big that it could have served as a meal all its own. Definitely worth the price of admission."}
{"text":"I made my 1st review 8months ago so I think I can safely say this hibachi has not improved , we ordered shrimp and steak hibachi , where was the steak?? There were literally 5 small pieces , so basically you're paying for bland rice and a load of sweet carrots . I don't know about everyone's preference on shrimp sauce but I like mine a little thick . This sauce was watered down and they give you a very small cup , charging 50Â¢ for an extra small cup . I'm just not cool with spending $11 on rice and carrots with a handful of hibachi .  I will say they decorated the place really cute and I think because the strip stores surrounding it people will overlook this small spot ."}
