HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."}
{"text":"They make best beef Kebab I have ever had. It's a small restaurant, clean friendly service. Mostly a lot of Russians dine there. The food is really tasty, good quality of meats. Average meal is $14-$16..."}
{"text":"This is a small Russian restaurant offering mostly kebabs and other skewer meat based foods. I tried the most unique thing on the menu, which was the wild boar kebab. The meal came with salad and potatoes. The wild boar meat was a but tough and you can definitely taste the gamey-ness of the boar. However, it was flavourful and the difference really comes out in the fragrance and juices of the meat. The potatoes and salad were average. The price point ($16) was a bit high considering the portions (about one skewer of meat)."}
