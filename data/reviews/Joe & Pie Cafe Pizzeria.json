{"text":"I've gotten 3 meals delivered to my house including breakfast on a weekday morning and they were all delicious."}
{"text":"I've had a plain pizza and a lamb gyro, both good. As they market the coffee too, I thought I'd stop in for a cup. I ordered a small iced coffee and waited for over 10 minutes for it. Not sure how it would have gone had I ordered a more complicated espresso drink. Stick to ordering food here."}
{"text":"It is unconscionable and frankly unfair that there is no Joe's anywhere near where I live. Not only does this fine establishment have mouth watering pizzas (meat lovers yum!) and a wide assortment of burgers, wraps, and salads, they take it a step further and have a breakfast menu so awesome.. and they deliver!  Their strawberry banana French toast is quickly becoming my favorite.   Haven't been to their Edgewood location, but purely from my delivery experience, Joe's has great food and their delivery service is great.  Highly highly recommend! Maybe a move is in order? (Or come down by DC, pretty please?)"}
{"text":"Very fast delivery of just under a half hour, via yelp ordering system, which estimated it would be 20 minutes longer so i was happy about that. Food was hot and joe pie was tasty, crust is good, like a fluffy handle but not thick bread base. Fries are a home run for delivery fries. Ultra crisp, i used them to make a tasty poutine at home. The tiramisu is a treat but i wish it was a larger portion (of course)! So happy it's in the neighborhood and can't wait to order breakfast on a Sunday for delivery after reading other reviews."}
{"text":"This place will close within the next 2 years, I'm fairly sure - just like every other restaurant in this spot. Slow service - mediocre food."}
{"text":"This place *delivers* customized omelets, fruit crepes and coffee at 8am. That in and of itself earns it five stars given how limited the delivery options are in Pittsburgh. In addition to the breakfast stuff being wonderful I've also tried the calzones here and they're phenomenal."}
{"text":"Very good pizza, great specials.  The sauce is very unique, sweet, distinguishes this pizza from the many other pizza places in the area.  Really liked the breadsticks.  Keep up the good work.  Came right on time, too.  Another redolent jewel in the crown of the east end's vibrant pizza culture."}
{"text":"Loved the pizza. Hot and cheesy with plenty of toppings. The pizza sauce is sweet which I really enjoyed. Buffalo fries were also crispy and delicous. Friendly staff. Will definitely try again. Looking forward to having a late night place in my area. I also plan to give their breakfast menu a try."}
{"text":"We ordered the steak pizza without green peppers. They may seem a little pricey, but the quality is very good and they give you a lot of toppings. The pizza was not greasy at all and it had a very good flavor. Simple and not overpowering. I could've probably ate the whole large pie!"}
{"text":"Pizza is pretty good, but the rest of the food seems to be frozen. Don't eat in the restaurant if you like any actual service. No wait staff at all and the guys working are clueless. I asked for hot water and one of the guys said \"we don't have any hot water\" and I asked him to boil some. Also no changing tables in either bathroom."}
{"text":"I ordered through Uber eats. I got 12 plain wings instead of the 12 Garlic Parm I ordered. When I called them, they said they'd give me credit towards my next order but that didn't help because this is the first & last time I'm ordering from them. I asked for some kind of refund & they said no because I got the wings & the garlic parm is just a flavoring that doesn't cost anything. I argued that no one wants to eat dry plain wings & they still refused ANY kind if refund. So I said ok then I'll leave you a bunch of bad reveiws saying what happened; they were fine with that! & here we are! Lol"}
{"text":"So I called in a cheese bread stick and small pepperoni order at 3p and said i would be there at 4pm to pick up.  I get there 5 minutes after 4, they said it's not ready yet and to sit and wait,  which is fine. So 15-20 minutes go pass and another customer walks in and said \"I knew y'all gave me the wrong order,  because I ordered more\". They exchanged orders and he tried to hand me my order that the lady just brought back in from where ever she was at..... I said \"so you weren't making my order?  I don't know what she did to that while she had it, she could've poke or touched  the food or anything\". I just asked for my money back. I can't believe they told me to wait for my order like they were still making it. It would've been my first time ordering,  but I won't ever order again from there."}
{"text":"Ordered the chicken gyros. I was hesitant because I had gotten chicken gyros from another local pizza joint that were so dry they were inedible. Well, these were the complete opposite! The chicken was juicy and marinated well. The only thing I wish is that I could order a side of feta as this was not an option when I ordered through an app."}
{"text":"They are take out only. Was looking for quick lunch. Although they advertise slices, they tried to up-sell to a medium pizza for same price. Ordering 2 slice special during lunch hour- it took a little time guessing they do not have slices ready. Pizza was good - cheesy with a thicker crust and a little greasy. They have a large menu selection soda & teas by the bottle."}
{"text":"Been here twice, first time seeking a cappuccino and the second time some pizza. First time they told me the espresso machine was down. Fail. Second time they told me they ran out of slices of pizza. Double fail! Um, it's 8pm on. Saturday. I didn't know that could happen at a pizza shop. They advertise cafe and pizzeria, but they had absolutely zero for me the times I went for either experience. I'm incredulous."}
{"text":"First time ordering from here. I was pleasantly surprised!  Hoagie was delicious. Pizza was super tasty. Delivery was FAST!"}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place. The man who delivered the menus was so nice and spoke very highly of the restaurant. Unfortunately we just didn't have a good experience. First, the driver delivered chicken fingers to our office instead of onion rings, I love chicken as much as the next person, but unfortunately my coworker is a vegetarian, so she felt differently. When we called they told us the driver would be back to switch the chicken with the onion rings. At this point, the chicken has been in our office for about 8-10 minutes and the container had been looked through by two coworkers who assumed the onion rings were underneath, etc. Much to our surprise, they actually took the chicken back to give to the person who owned the other order! Not sure about you, but I don't want chicken fingers that have potentially been fingered by another customer, so that flagged me as very unsanitary. The lamb Schwarma we ordered was, interesting. It was said to come on a pita, but it showed up in a wheat-like tortilla. So it was pretty different than described. The meat didn't taste bad, but we all couldn't get past the thought that this Schwarma had potentially been handled by someone in another office, much like the faux onion rings, aka chicken tenders. They also forgot the ranch dressing for the onion rings. Who knows, maybe the other office got it. I wouldn't recommend, unfortunately."}
{"text":"I'm originally from the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre area, which has arguably some of the best pizza in the country. This place is the only place in ALL of western PA that has impressed me with their pizza. Not only that, but their onion rings are to die for and their wings are amazing. Delivery is unrealistically fast."}
{"text":"This was the only pizza place in the area open late on a Sunday, so we thought we'd give it a try.  The menu was fairly large, but we only ordered pizza (take out).  Pretty decent pizza.  Nice, airy dough.  Good crunch on the bottom, yet doughy texture inside of crust."}
{"text":"We ordered some takeout 2 days ago. I picked the lamb gyro and my husband ordered the steak calzone. My gyro was full of overcooked chopped lamb, not the juice gyro meat. There was little sauce on it. Quite the disappointment. The calzone was mostly dough with a little filling. We also had a small salad that was enough for both of us. We had ordered pizza from there previously, which was okay. I don't think it's worth the price we paid and won't be ordering from Joe and Pie again."}
{"text":"Well, I want to like it, the app is great (and that is important) BUT if they can't get the order right...... Pizza, literally no sauce (check pic) and Caesar  salad, no dressing. 2 of the 3 items ordered messed up. Called, friendly, apologetic, won't happen again, we'll see.....get one more shot"}
{"text":"Grabbed a slice here yesterday. The place was empty but it was clean! The pizza was just okay but certainly wasn't terrible. I was desperate for a quick slice of pizza and this place met those needs."}
{"text":"I've only had delivery but it was a gud experience. I received a confirmation email for the order which was expected. But then, I received an additional message with an estimated delivery time. My order arrived 20 minutes earlier.  No complaints here! The Italian wedgie and wings were fantastic! I have found my new favorite spot."}
{"text":"Tried the chicken shawarma. It was decent. Don't think the young man at the counter asked me what sauce I wanted so no sauce at all. Would have been better with cucumber sauce so a little bummed. Very clean dining area. Phone was ringing pretty often with orders around 2:30pm so that's promising for them. Give it a try. I also know they deliver (including breakfast!!!) within 5 miles of Edgewood Towne Centre.   Update: the owner contacted me directly to let me know he was going to use the feedback to train staff which is great. Also offered another shawarma on him. Very good service on his part. If I'm ever in the area, might take him up on that offer."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery a couple days ago. Service was fast and prompt. The feta cheese and spinach rolls were delicious."}
{"text":"I tried their pizza tonight after work and I am glad that I did! The crust was the lightest that I have ever had! I ate the whole piece!"}
{"text":"Ordered from Joe & Pie Cafe for the first time tonight. In an area that is filled with pizza delivery restaurants we like to try the new places to see how they compare....especially when they are close to some of the best pizza places in the South Hills area ( Campeti's, Fiores, Betos, Mineos) I have to say that we were pleasantly surprised. The pizza was good- I liked the sweetness of the sauce,although I thought it could have used more on the pizza...it was good in the middle,but they didn't sauce it the whole way around. The pepperoni and onions were in literally every bite which was perfect and as someone who always has to crisp up their pizza in the oven- even when freshly delivered- I didn't need to tonight, the crust was well cooked and everything was hot. We also tried the steak and Italian hoagies. The steak did not have a lot of meat on it and when you split the half hoagie in half, one side got mostly bread...other than that it wasn't bad, just a little below average. My suggestion, make a deluxe steak version and put grilled onions, mushrooms and red peppers on it--then you would have an above average steak hoagie and would compete with Campeti and Betos....they advertised mushrooms on it, but I didn't see any and it also needed more cheese which was also advertised as on it and there was very little. The Italian hoagie was good..no complaints. We also ordered mild wings which we didn't really like...there was very little sauce on them and no crispness to them at all. I wouldn't order wings from there again.  That being said, we will definitely order pizza and hoagies again and look forward to trying some of the other menu items. Because of the area you are located in and all the competitors...Joe & Pie really needs to do something to stand out as one of the best....I think they could get there and be among the Camps, Fiores, Betos level with delivery-- which none of those have.  We got some dipping sauces too...$1.00 for a dipping sauce is a little expensive, the homemade ranch was good...but I think we will forgo them next time and save the 3.00 we spent on 3-2 oz solo cups of ranch & garlic butter. It might be nice to include one or 2 with the pizza as most places in the area do. The cost wasn't terrible, we had a 2 topping medium pizza, 2 half hoagies, and an order of 6 wings and 3 sauces on the side for around 35.00 including tax. My last suggestion is to have someone proof read your menu and websites...mushrooms on the menu are listed as \"mashrooms\" and hoagies are \"hoogies\" on the website. It just looks more professional when the spelling is correct. We enjoyed our dinner, have plenty of leftovers for lunch tomorrow and we will probably order from them again. Welcome to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I have to say that I was a bit leery.  There are so many pizza places and the concept of the café and pizzeria didn't wow me.  But I ordered the Joe special, a chicken schawarma and fries on a Sunday afternoon and couldn't have been more pleased.  The pie was awesome - great chewy crust, tons and tons of toppings and a nice white sauce.  The chicken was really well seasoned, the pita was more of a tortilla, but the cucumber sauce was right on point.  But what really stood out were the fries.  Fries at a pizza place?  I have a toddler and toddlers love fries and ketchup more than life itself, so in order to appease said toddler, I always order fries just in case.  In most cases, delivery fries are sub-par - kind of soggy, not flavorful.  However, these were crunchy and very good.  They reminded me of Burger King fries.  They were a big hit!"}
{"text":"First time ordering from Joe & Pie Cafe Pizzeria, the cheeseburger and  fries online, my son got the same and bar-b-q wings, everything was  so good, seasoned and hot. Just a simple burger and fries, DAMN! it was GOOD! The BBQ chicken was delicious! We spent almost 2 hours looking at other menus and couldn't decide because we received such terrible service from a lot of other restaurants, decide to just have a bowl of cereal, but then a menu from Joe & Pie showed up in the mail, we took it as a sign and was not disappointed. Service was great and delivery was fast. We will be ordering from Joe & Pie Cafe Pizzeria from now on. Loved it, Thank you."}
{"text":"I heard this place was good. I wouldn't know though, they had me on hold for 10 minutes to place an order so I had to hang up and order elsewhere. You don't keep a customer on hold that long."}
{"text":"The pizza is great, the restaurant is clean, and service is prompt! We come here regularly. I don't know whatever the other reviewer was saying about the pizza being bland because we get it every week and it's awesome!"}
{"text":"This is the second time ordering from Joe & Pie - ordered online this time. The chicken pizza and hoagie was very tasty, I really enjoyed every bite.    ** Note to self : ask for dressing in the side. Hoagie was hot and dressing got a little drippy - but I enjoyed it !!   The delivery person was so friendly! It arrived in no time, fresh and hot.  I have no issues ordering online, and will do so again.   I do have my favorite pizza place Mario's in Greentree, but for a fast quick lunch and great service I am going to order from Joe & Pie !!   Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Will not order here again. Spaghetti and meatballs, nice size portion, extra marinara as requested. Forgot to send the garlic bread (delivery. No need for extra sauce when you have no bread).  The meatballs were so-so and the sauce was absolutely store bought. Disappointing. Chicken on my salad was extremely dried out and with the tablespoon of salad dressing provided, pretty tough to choke down.  Much more satisfying lunch from Subway."}
{"text":"had the strawberry walnut feta salad, greek salad....very deliciously fresh salads and very quick delivery!!!  will order again!!!!"}
{"text":"Large cheese add ricotta. Strange but I crave this place all the time. Sweeter dough and sauce. Cheap prices and good carry out specials!!"}
{"text":"So, the pizza tasted good. However, it made me really sick. We ordered a gluten free pizza, they had it advertised all over the place on the menu and all the pizza boxes. When it arrived, it didn't look quite like a gluten free pizza, but I took their word for it and ate it. It tasted delicious (another key hint that it wasn't gluten free...). Anyway, I was sick for a few days with telltale gluten symptoms. It sucked. In the twelve years I've been gluten free since my celiac diagnosis, this has never ever happened with any restaurant or delivery. I guess I am lucky for that, and lucky my reaction wasn't too bad, but I'm still pretty annoyed.   We called the following evening to tell them that this had happened. They said they would give us five dollars off our next pizza. After questioning that, they agreed to send us a gluten free pizza at no charge. When it arrived, sure enough, it looked totally different. I think if they were nicer about it and they took us seriously, I would order there again. Ultimately though, I think we'll stick with the other places where we can trust the staff a bit more."}
{"text":"Good food! Went with family they all loved it. Orders were wedgie, hoagie, burger, and fries. not a long wait to get the food. I got burger and fries. The burger was okay big size and the fries were good too. Mines came up to $10. Would recommend it"}
{"text":"--------------------------------------------------  Horrible!!  I was visiting my family in the Robinson area, and we ordered delivery Italian hoagies (on the menu as \"oven-baked sandwiches\") and pizza.  Everything about the Italian hoagie was bad.  The meat was a mediocre slice of ham, some bad-tasting pepperoni, and, worst of all, the salami was not the usual hard salami, it was cotto salami, which is a type of salami that tastes like spicy baloney with black peppercorns in it.  Horrible! The mozzarella cheese was like plastic. Sandwich roll was soft and soggy, not crispy.  The pizza was terrible.  The pizza sauce was too sweet, yuck.  The mozzarella cheese was tough and chewy.  We will never order from this restaurant again."}
{"text":"Ordered several times the food is always very good. Delivery is very quick. The Gyro Joes special pizza is absolutely delicious highly recommend."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love  a good pizza! I prefer Jets and he prefers Fioris but this was definitely a good balance between the two! we also ordered an Italian Calzone which was superrr   **p.s ask for their garlic sauce on the side, it's delishhhhh**"}
{"text":"Decent Pie with Gyro meat on it.  Also got the Anti Pasta Salad and a Lamb Gyro.  All were decent, just wish there was a bit more to the salad.  Gyro was solid but on the small side.  Can't find any food in Pitt on a Sunday night and they deliver late.  If you have a coupon make sure to call in your order because their web site won't accept any on-line.  Nice delivery guy."}
{"text":"We ordered cheese breadsticks, pepperoni rolls (because the WV in us can't resist), and Pepperoni pizza with a few extra toppings. It was pretty good. The sauce is on the sweeter/thin side but it didn't stop us from eating it! I highly recommend the pepperoni rolls, while they aren't 'fluffy' like you'd get in WV, they're dang delicious. We'll be ordering again!   Also the delivery was freaky fast."}
{"text":"Ordered the Hungry Man Special for delivery for the first Penguins game a couple nights ago. It came with a large cheese pizza, a whole hoagie, and a dozen wings.  I also ordered a side salad!  The online ordering process was very easy and they even allowed for you to pre-pay the tip prior to their arrival, which I did.  That meant no receipts to sign when the food arrived!  Everything was piping hot and packaged very well! The cheese pizza was huge with very fresh tasting crust and a sweet tomato sauce; and I like that they cut the slices thinner than a typical pizza place. The wings were crunchy and delicious with not too much buffalo sauce on them, the meatball hoagie was just okay, and the side salad was excellent with what tasted like homemade ranch dressing. It was sooo good.    I used to work downtown and loved to eat at their location on Liberty Avenue for lunch but I think the Dormont location may be even better! I will definitely order again!"}
{"text":"This place has the worst customer service ever. Last night I called them up to order and they put me on hold. After 30 seconds the line went dead so I called back. Again they put me on hold and this time I waited and waited and waited. I hung up this time and tried calling back one last time. At this point I explained my situation to the person on the other end who said they would put the manager on the phone. Guess what happened?... they hung up on me. I'll never attempt to contact this horrible establishment ever again."}
{"text":"Let me just start out with this: JOE & PIE is in-flippin-credible. I highly recommend this restaurant for a PLETHORA of reasons. First...THE FOOD. Delicious and fairly priced. Second, the staff is so fantastically hospitable and very funny. And not to make this post to long, it's just a great establishment. Go!!!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered the chicken bacon ranch pizza last night - very good! Delivery was on time and food was hot. The pens game had just started so I could understand if they were busy. The guy went to our neighbor's by accident but he is cool so no problem...however, we paid online ahead of time so it technically could've been stolen if delivered to someone not as nice lol. We also got fried zucchini which was the good flat, thin plank style that we like.   This is our first time, and we only got delivery, so I can't really speak for anything else...but their menu is pretty extensive and they do breakfast/brunch (delivery!!) so I definitely want to try that. Pizza was even good reheated for the next day.   Mineo's is still my favorite, but they don't deliver...so this so far has been the best if you don't feel like going out or leaving the house! I might not have even found these guys, but having just moved to the area...they mailed us a menu and it worked! Excited to try something else from these guys. Thanks for offering another good option in the area."}
{"text":"The first two times we ordered from here we were impressed (maybe 6-8 months ago). The last two times, however, it is pretty obvious their standards have dropped. Our pizzas arrived lukewarm (one better than the other). I can forgive that, but the flavor of the crust has gotten so bland! It's like eating cardboard. It is just nothing special anymore. I did like the Buffalo flavored wings, and we all enjoyed an order of French fries. I hope they can get it together and make some much needed changes"}
{"text":"Had the Italian hoagie.  Half of the bread was soggy and the other half was stale.  Aside from that it was average at best, but the fact that they charge $11 for a 12\" hoagie of this quality is ridiculous."}
{"text":"Really good pizza, wings and sandwiches. Hit this spot up twice while attending a conference in Armpittsburgh."}
{"text":"Amazing customer service, very friendly and the pizza was flavorful and filling! I would recommend this for anyone who's craving a good tasty pizza!"}
{"text":"This place is for you if you enjoy maybe getting your pizza maybe not. Maybe it will be the right order maybe not. And you might just get raw dough."}
{"text":"You know the saying about pizza...Even when it's bad its still pretty good.  This is the one pizza that defies that logic.  It's bad. It's really, really bad.  The only good thing is that is that it was also so unbelievably small we didn't have to eat much of it.  Save yourself the trouble and go to Vincent's pizza park instead."}
{"text":"We stopped in at random just yesterday and have just ordered again for delivery tonight. The atmosphere in the restaurant itself is a comfortable mix of traditional and \"hip\". Extremely clean and spacious. Recessed lighting in the ceiling is a nice atmospheric touch.  On to the food. Piping hot and absolutely delicious! The perfect amount of sauce and the pizza wasn't greasy or oily as is the case far too often. Large selection of toppings makes customizing your pizza easy and fun.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"}
{"text":"Another location for Joe & Pie.  Have not visited any of the others but have seen some of the reviews.  This location is take out.  Only two chairs and not much room to put a table if they decide to except in the window box.They have the usual pizza, wings, burgers, Shawarma & gyro, salads and oven baked sandwiches. Had a pizza and the crust was soft and chewy and the sauce a little on the sweet side."}
{"text":"Good pizza--sauce and crust on the sweeter size.  Italian hoagie was good!  A great addition to ETC"}
{"text":"I don't always love all the pizza options in Pittsburgh. I love Slice on Broadway, but their delivery is usually on the slow side. If my husband and I want pizza delivery but don't want to wait, we'll order from Joe & Pie. You can order online, their delivery is fast and the pizza is good. I would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I'll start out by saying 1 hour ago I would've given this place a 4/5. But now we will absolutely NEVER RETURN. I ordered dinner from THEIR APP (via ChowNow) and my husband went to pick it up. Upon getting there, there was major confusion and the clerk asked my husband what we ordered (??? He told them the name the order was under. He didn't know the details of what I ordered). The clerk spouted off an order that sounded like something I would order and then proceeded to charge my husband a little over $20 for it. I had paid already. You don't have the option to pay in store on the app. Upon the mass chaos unfolding, someone came out from the back and said there were \"too many orders\" so he needed to know exactly what I ordered. I was called and told husb what I ordered and that it was paid for already.  They hand my husband an order and he was like \"uhh we have a problem. I just paid you for that other order\" to which the guy said \"oh yeah\" and hands my husband two $10 bills. How are you going to charge someone bc you are horribly disorganized and then short them on the refund??? Absolutely nuts. Steer clear of this place if you want to avoid incredible frustration. Also as an aside -the restaurant is open right now (its 8p on a Saturday) but the Yelp profile says it's closed.  They clearly don't want business!!!"}
{"text":"We live nearby and we're so excited to try this place. The first time we tried it, we had breakfast delivered. I wasn't expecting that much, but the food was surprisingly good--and delivered to our house on a Saturday morning which was great! It been years since I lived somewhere with breakfast delivery. The second time, we ordered pizza. Neither my husband nor I were fans. The sauce was oddly sweet, and the cheese and other toppings just kind of tasted cheap. So, 5 stars for the yummy breakfast delivery; 2 stars for the disappointing pizza. We won't order the pizza again, but we would definitely order breakfast again."}
{"text":"Just moved to the area and needed a quick dinner. I ordered the gyro pizza and it was delicious. Crust was crispy and the toppings were generous. Delivery was quick and service was great. This is definitely my new pizza place."}
{"text":"Lord above, this pizza (spinach feta) was lovely.  And the fellow manning the counter was very friendly, keeping up interesting banter until my food was ready.  Go! Try! This is apparently one of four locations in the Pittsburgh metro area."}
{"text":"First Time ordering from here. I pre-ordered at 1 PM for delivery at 5:30 PM. It came exactly at 5:30 PM I ordered the steak salad. It was excellent, the best I have ever had. Thanks We ordered again on Sunday. Chicken Parmesan and spaghetti and meatballs with salad and garlic bread. Fantastic!"}
{"text":"I went to the one located on liberty ave. Downtown Pittsburgh and a price of the Caesar salad one line was 1.99 when I said something and showed the worker he said it was a error and didn't refund or offer to recompense for the money when it was a $6 dollar difference between the price online and the price u was charged...he offered nothing.  I feel like he should have compensated a few dollars for the return of a customer but he did not.  Food was good."}
