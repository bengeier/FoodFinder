{"text":"I wanted to like it but... there are reasons for not having a line on St. Patty's day. 

Beer - This place has and ample beer selection but must expect you to have memorized every beer out there. The beer menu had no descriptions or IBV. That's fine for the standards but not for small batch craft. The second frustrating thing is they only do flights on beers under $6.50. That was probably less than 15. I would have been fine paying an up charge to get what I wanted but according to the server he could not input them. I ended looking up the beers I didn't know online as the server was not great help. 

Food - We got the Pork Nachos and French Dip. Neither was remarkably good or bad. They both came out hot. The French Dip seemed like it was hamburger meat. Overall OK but far from the best brewery food within 10 miles. 

I looked at going to the Brass Tap in Mesa and after ending up here I am glad I never bothered. I hope they make some changes to the beer presentation and the food. If they don't, when OHSO opens this place will be empty. 

My suggestion, pick somewhere else."}
{"text":"Our waiter was great and did a good job of checking on us. 
We got the pretzel bits. Great. We asked for mustard and it was the best thing on them. They should offer this with the bee cheese. Angus sliders were great as well. Meat tender and juicy. Loaded Mac n Cheese. Was loaded but not with noodles. Could have used more noodles in the dish. Tater tots. The waiter said it was a good choice and he wasn't wrong!"}
{"text":"If I could leave 0 stars I would. I've been in the service industry for 10 years and I honestly don't think I've ever complained about service. Everyone has those bad days. There was no excuse for today though We walked in and sat down near the entrance. The place was about 1/4 full and we saw about 10 servers. It took about 10 minutes to be greeted but we were choosing beers anyways so no biggie. Once our server came over I asked for a flight and one of my choices she said she needed to check on, so off she went. No joke....we did not see her for 20 minutes. Even then, it was to drop off the bill to the table RIGHT NEXT TO US. She then took their bill to cash them out. She brought it back to them and then went to another table. After seeing 5 other tables walk in and be serviced by other servers we walked out. 

We were very excited to get a Brass Tap next to us since we make the drive to the alternate location. Sadly I cannot reccomend this one due to the lack of service. We were not forgotten and the place was not busy enough for this....it was just plain unprofessional."}
{"text":"Went to the Brass Tap for lunch today. The food was very good...we had a burger, Korean BBQ Tacos and Fish and Chips. All very good, but the TARTER  SAUCE was AMAZING! Aoili like that should be illegal it's so good! Someone call the cops! :) 

I also had the Lime Pilsner beer....it was the perfect refreshing beer for a hot Phoenix Friday."}
{"text":"Great spot in old town! Food was on point! This place adds a unique experience in the downtown space."}
{"text":"It's our new favorite place to go for Taco Tuesday! The best $2 tacos (better then Joy Ride across the street). We've eaten here a few times and the food is always very good. Jay the bartender is friendly and knowledgeable on all their beers. Go check them out!"}
{"text":"Great service, friendly bar! Prices and food are yummy too!"}
{"text":"Have come here twice now and both times left happy. The burgers are good and the staff has been good. Only thing is staff has taken a while to check up on us both times I've gone. Decent size patio area and the menu has a great variety. Would recommend to anyone looking to try somewhere new!"}
{"text":"Avoid the Fish & Chips....They do not and never will serve tartar sauce with your meal.  Met with the hot-headed, over stuffed owner to discuss and he indicated that he knew what the customers need and doesn't really care about what the customers want.  WoW - This place is on it's way out before it even gets going....."}
{"text":"Service was great! Daniel was very attentive and had great suggestions. We ordered the Fish tacos, Korean Pork tacos, and chicken tacos. Bother the fish and the pork were great. Chicken was just kind of like lunch meat in a taco so I probably wouldn't order those again. Cocktails were good and the patio was nice. Will be back!"}
{"text":"I have tried this 2 other times and it was even worse.   Just to prove a point tonight at 7 pm for 2 pp OHSO had a 2 hour hour wait, Whiskey Row had a 90 min wait and Joy Ride had  a 40 min wait. You guys had empty tables.   Clearly there is a problem."}
{"text":"Stopped here to grab a drink. It took 15 minutes for someone to stop by and place an order. They were out of both beers that I ordered. Ended up not getting anything and leaving. Will not be going back."}
{"text":"Loved the Brass Tap!!! Huge bar and restaurant area, and an awesome outdoor patio!! Great beer and food selection too. Downtown Gilbert definitely needed a place like this!!"}
{"text":"Food was just bar food.  The Jenga game made a terrible crash that left everyone on the patio a jumble of nerves.  Service was ok.  Nothing to come back for here."}
{"text":"60 + Beers on tap and staff that was happy to be there to help you with your selection.  Need I say more?
We sat at the bar so we were served by three different servers.  Each stopped, listened to what we wanted and offered suggestions.  We felt like they were really invested in us enjoying their bar.  The food looked good but that will be another visit. 
It is a little industrial and sound bounces off the cement and steel but not bad.   
Looking forward to our next visit."}
{"text":"So many beer choices on tap!!! Love the pretzel n cheese! The boom boom shrimp has tons of flavor! Nachos were delish. Server/service was great! Food was out quick and it was busy so was impressed! Glad this finally opened! Been excited about it since I heard rumor it was coming!"}
{"text":"The place is super cute with a ton of beer choices. Buttttt upon receiving my food there was black hair in it (no one at the table has black hair). When I got the replacement there was ANOTHER hair but smaller this time. The portions were VERY small... so small that we went next door to eat an actual meal. They messed up my boyfriends order and it took 15 minutes to get the right food."}
{"text":"There was some serious hype for this location in downtown Gilbert. As Gilbert locals, we were super excited. The location is prime and the setup looked like it would be great. We stopped in last week to celebrate work promotions around 9:45 pm. The location is well setup, the patio has gorgeous strung lights and high tops are adorable. Our server was sweet and let us know the kitchen was closed (boo) so we ordered drinks. I had a Kentucky mule in the tiniest copper mug I've ever seen and the fianc√© had a draft in a warm glass. Underwhelming drinks but we will definitely give it another go when the kitchen is open because the offerings looked delicious. They also had live music which was great since Whiskey Row was next door and the music was different. 

Suggest stopping in if you like a selection of drinks, beers and possibly a great menu. Looks like a fun place for groups."}
{"text":"This place could me so much more! The service is horrible, we got our food before our drinks! The dishes were dirty and did I say service is horrible, awfully slow."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in to Brass Tap for our first visit.   We were just looking to get a few drinks and check the place out.  Unfortunately, I am not a craft beer drinker, but they did had a very large beer selection.  I was disappointed they had no beers I would actually drink.  It really makes no sense for an establishment like this to not at least carry one \"lame\" domestic light beer for those of us who just want a simple beer.   I get this is a craft beer kind of place, but why alienate customers who just want a basic beer.   How about carry 199 craft beers and one domestic light beer way in the back of the cooler.  The service was decent and the place seemed ok,  but I can guarantee we will never return because of their beer selection."}
{"text":"The food was great, the service was easily the worst I've ever had in my life. Our food came out 45 min after our friends meals and I had to walk to bar to order the ranch she forgot to put in because she was too embarrassed to come to our table."}
{"text":"Fun place and good drinks and tons of beers on tap. The white sangria is delicious! Service is fast, the place isn't too busy on a Saturday afternoon and there was room for the baby stroller as well. Outside they have a large connect 4 game which was really fun to play. Parking is in the back and plenty of spots, will definitely return when we are in the Gilbert area."}
{"text":"First time here this week. The venue is nice and the patio looks great. Beer selection was ok but it do t help when you don't have a menu available of any kind. I like to try new beers and having to ask bartender what is this and that looking at tap handles isn't effective. Food was good. They should join Untappd as this would help with the problem they had when I went."}
{"text":"Incredible experience / dinner! A friend and I came for dinner on a Friday night. They are fast!!

We were seated immediately, placed our orders, and our drinks arrived within minutes, and followed by our food in another five minutes.

The staff was awesome. Service great. We will be back!"}
{"text":"This place is honestly a bummer. They have some of my favorite beers but both times I've been the service has been TERRIBLE. Im talking like no eye contact from the staff, not even a friendly hello. You could tell they didn't want to serve us even though they didn't close for 40 minutes. We walked out and went to Whiskey Row, very disappointed!"}
{"text":"The service was sooo slow! It took about 20 minutes to get our drinks and a side of sour cream! We ordered the nachos and our first order came out in about 2 minutes. Crazy fast!! The bad news... the chips in the middle were soggy and the outer rim ones were stale. We asked our server for a new order and she took the plate without saying anything to us. The food was okay but nothing super delicious. I got the wrap and it was pretty dry and bland. The place is also SUPER loud so if you want to have a good conversation this might not be the place. I got two cocktails a mule and lemonade and they were pretty good!"}
{"text":"Good vibe. Lots of good drinks and fun live singer, but watch your tab. We had a problem with additional drinks being added to our friends tab."}
{"text":"Menu options were very limited and service was super slow.  Place was maybe 1/4 full at best. We waited for 15 minutes to get our drinks when the waitress says they do not have one of the wines we ordered. After 20 minutes with no food or drinks and bartenders that were just standing around, we cancelled our order and left.   We work too hard for our money to get poor service and menu items that really didn't sound appealing. They only had two salad dressing option...... really?"}
{"text":"Service is horrible...such a bummer because they have a great location. Tip...wait for OHSO to open. They'll blow this place away!"}
{"text":"Checked out The Brass Tap in downtown Gilbert tonight. We had the best service from our server Megan! She was super kind and attentive, she answered all of our questions (we had a lot with all of those beers). Very large beer selection and the food was delicious! Can't wait to come back again!"}
{"text":"This place has a ton of potential, and is in an incredible location. But, mixed reviews so far for me. I first stopped in the 2nd night they were open. It was quiet, but also a weeknight. At first glance I was totally impressed with the beer menu. The bartenders knew their brews and were attentive. We had a few and left- solid experience. The next stop in was less impressive. It was a weekend night, and we spent most of the time out on the patio. I had a few heavy beers elsewhere so was ready for a lager. The first one I ordered, out of. The 2nd one, out of that too. The third, you guessed it. So, the server took it upon herself to bring me the fourth and last /only lager on the menu, a beer I am not a huge fan of (I would have and did, order something else.) I understand they are rotating kegs quite often, but you HAVE TO keep the menu up to date! I haven't tried the food yet, and will have to next time. The menu looks like it has some decent bar food items. The beer prices are fair, and the brewery of the month at $5 a pint is a nice deal (Santa Fe for March). They are offering a shuttle to and from PHX Rising soccer games which is a huge plus for me. That will bring me back at least a few more times, in which case I hope they have the beers I am looking to order. Good luck Brass Tap, a nice addition to DT Gilbert!"}
{"text":"Came in last night and the place is very nice! They have a huge selection of beers on tap. It's a Perfect place to hangout and try new beers. Emily was our server and was very accommodating!! We live in dt Gilbert so we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"If you like cool(ish) beer and OK service than you should totally go here. Nothing stands out here. That is all....."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and the Korean BBQ pulled pork tacos are spicy and delicious!!!! Great place to hang out play days or shuffle board!"}
{"text":"Went here for a casual date night. The draught beer list was awesome. They even had delirium tremens which is hard to find. The food far exceeded our expectations. We had the pub burger and the Korean bbq burger with housemade tots. Highly recommend both burgers. The service was somewhat slow and not very attentive but may have been due to it being relatively new. We will be back!"}
{"text":"My wife and I had a great time here watching basketball and eating good food. Fantastic service even on a busy st Patrick's Saturday night. Reasonable prices will come back again"}
{"text":"I was so excited to see another brass tap opened but this time with more restaurant-Esque! I tried to go for happy hour a week ago during spring break and spring training and there was literally not a single chair available. So, this week for our one-night-a-week family outing, we tried again.  I'm not a review writer or complainer, desperately trying to avoid confrontation, but I can't stop thinking about this one aspect that Really bothered me. 

We were holding the happy hr menu and ordered everything from it, double checking multiple times that it was indeed a happy hr option after a first misunderstanding with our waitress and a drink order. It specifically says in the menu as an option \"2 southern stacks\", which I got, but instead got two separate orders of them. My husband hates tomatoes and our waitress talked us into getting two other things for him instead of one, so it seemed obvious the second order wouldn't have been for him and it just seems odd for one person to order two orders of the same thing. When she brought them out, my husband explained we only wanted one order (before we even touched anything). Our waitress laughed it off as a miscommunication and that he could try them and see if he liked them (which he did neither of) , making it seem like taking them back wasn't an option or they'd just be wasted anyways. 

We were charged for both and I didn't want to bring it up again or make a scene after already having mentioned it - but I'm now so mad I didn't! Ive worked in the service industry for a decade and don't think it should have gone that way. I also know it's not the end of the world and downplay it internally, but the fact that I can't let it go and how nonchalant she seemed about it when we initially corrected it to begin with, brought me here. It's hard enough to eat out on a budget these days, which albeit was our choice (although we opt for the more frugal options), but that extra wrong expense that I just swallowed makes it even harder.  That's why I'm here. If nothing else, you should change the writing on the menu to avoid confusion or have a more \"the customer is right\" attitude. 

Otherwise, the beer selection is amazing and extensive and the open doors to the patio was lovely at this time of year."}
{"text":"I read several reviews, but always take into consideration how picky some people may be. A few reviews were spot on. The service was sub par, as were the appetizers. Good beers will only get you so far."}
{"text":"The great: offering a discount to first responders on top of happy hour prices. Also, the service (but then again it was slow on a Monday night so I cannot speak to busier times). Happy hour prices were very reasonable, which is likely the only time you should go because otherwise it wouldn't be worth it. 

The bad: the sangria tasted like it was poured right from the bottle from costco and had so much ice, I think it was only 6-8oz of sangria. The pimento cheese was so unappetizing (look and taste) that we had to request nacho cheese as a substitute. The chicken nachos were very mediocre as were the chicken tacos. The tortilla chips were great, but I doubt they were made at the restaurant. 

We had to move two times because we sat on the patio and sun was glaring right into our eyes; would have been nice to have a shade that lowered or something to help try to reduce the sun from coming directly into the patio as it lowered. The couches felt cheap and uncomfortable, so when we moved the first time, we asked for a table inside. It was really nice that they did accommodate that and didn't give us a hard time for moving again due to the sun. Again, had it been busier, we likely wouldn't have had the option to move. 

All in all, if you're going with the desire to only to have a beer, probably worth it, but only during happy hour."}
{"text":"Great owner, well managed, fun environment, and excellent customer service. Would highly recommend The Brass Tap to anyone looking for a local place to hangout and enjoy a night out!"}
{"text":"Start with service... it was fantastic.  We sat at the bar and were waited on by Jed.  He made sure we felt welcome and although he was incredibly busy he anticipated what we needed and was very attentive. He is also very friendly, knowledgeable and went out of his way to introduce us to the owner who was also very nice and friendly. Now let's talk beer ...  they have a very big and high quality selection. They have a beer for every taste. Food .... not a huge selection but we had the fish tacos, hush puppies and chicken flatbread. The fish tacos were amazing.  I am not a big hush puppy guy, but my wife is and she loved these. The chicken flatbread had nice large size chunks of fresh, moist and flavorful chicken. Lastly the location. The Heritage District of Gilbert is perfect. Very easy to get to.  We were there on a Saturday night so it was very busy, but we did not have to wait for anything. I also like the variety of seating options. Overall awesome visit. We will be back and hope The Brass Tap Gilbert will be around for a long time."}
{"text":"Horrible service! It took the server ten minutes to even notice us after she walked by us a few times. Not a hello or welcome or even a \"I'll be right with you\". I get it, the place was somewhat busy, but once we got her attention and she came by with some menus... she never came back. The music inside the place was incredibly loud and annoying. There was a group of us waiting and after another fifteen minutes passed we decided to get up and leave. We were really looking forward to this place, but I guess we won't be coming back."}
{"text":"The food was good, but there was a guy playing piano and singing who was quite possibly the worst live musician I've ever heard. It was painful to listen to. Don't go to this place on Sundays between 1 and 4 when this dude is there. There were times when he was playing where I thought to myself, \"this has to be a joke, he can't really be doing this\".... he was. And it was loud, so sucking it up and ignoring him was not really an option."}
{"text":"Great food and drinks. I had the Southern stack and it was so good! The pork and green tomatoes go well together. I also had the hand breaded chicken tenders and got full off of them as they huge with fries and slaw. There rum was also very good and my waiter Daniel was a great conversationalist! Great place!"}
{"text":"Love love love 
It has a great outdoor patio, nice servers, and a ton of beer choices. 
I only tried appetizers but the food was good . The Moscow mules were good too!!"}
{"text":"Good beer selection, horrible service. I ordered a flight of porters and stouts, the waitress commented about one of the stouts, the Kentucky Breakfast stout(top 28 in the country on beer advocate) and said it was disgusting. I got it anyway and it was great. We only saw the waitress twice in the 45 minutes we were there. This was 3:00 in the afternoon, not busy. They need to improve the service."}
{"text":"Oh man.... There's a lot to like about the Brass Tap in Gilbert, but they have a few kinks to work out. The new building is excellent and the general layout of the restaurant is great. There's a decent sized patio with a variety of seating. The beer list is diverse and has a decent representation of local brewers. Now, a couple complaints.... The bar staff seems to struggle to pour a full beer. My wife and I had three rounds and each beer had too much head and wasn't full. Also, the wings are subpar (not crispy at all). I'm happy about the new drinking hole, and I'm hopeful they work out the simple problems."}
{"text":"Super excited for this to finally open ! We have been twice so far. Both times the service has been excellent.  We have tried both the Korean and prime rib nachos, both YUMMY!  My husband and I both enjoyed our meals so much the first time we get them again the second. Fish tacos and the buffalo wrap ( I ask for grilled chicken instead of fried) .  Their beer selection obviously is awesome !! Oh!!! And on Friday they had live music !  We will definitely be back ! This is exactly what downtown Gilbert needed !

We went again last night ..... another amazing experience! Grant was our server! Knowledgeable, friendly - and very attentive.  You guys are DOING IT RIGHT!"}
{"text":"The beer selection is outstanding. What few wines they have are fairly good. Go during the week, Monday through Thursday and the service is pretty good. I suspect the weekend service might get \"shakey\"."}
{"text":"The service was so so slow and the staff members are not personable at all. The environment is dirty and a lot of their food items were not flavorful or enjoyable. I sent the mac and cheese back twice because there was a hair in it and then the second one had hard noodles that were not fully cooked, the tacos were bland, the beer cheese was cold and tasteless. I also ordered two alcoholic beverages I ordered the same drink twice and each time it was made different. F this place."}
{"text":"If you love good American craft beer, this is a great place to go. The selection is great and not watered down by domestic water beer such as Bud Light and Coors. The food was great. We had some awesome fish tacos and fish and chips. For all of the above mentioned, I would come back. However, this place gets docked a star because of our waitress. We sat and waited close to 10 minutes for someone to take our order before I had to flag down a random waitress who tried to find ours. During our meal, she did not visit to see if we needed anything. It took a while after we were finished for our waitress to come and give us the check. In the mean time, we had to flag down another waitress for a to-go box. THAT waitress .... not ours ... seemed like she was doing a good job. She helped us more that the one servicing our area. 

All in All we loved the beer and food and will move forward with having our post wedding reception here with hopes of a much better waitress than the non receptive one we had."}
{"text":"Came here twice before reviewing. I wanted to give it another chance because we absolutely love the Mesa Brass Tap and we were so excited to have one in Gilbert. The beer selection here is always on point...but otherwise, this place is just horrible. The servers are so rude, so slow, and so inattentive and they had very few tables of people to wait on both times we were there. This time around, Our server had an attitude the moment we sat down. I waited for her to come back after taking our drink order because I wanted to order food, took her a good 20 minutes after walking by multiple times. I ordered nothing and asked for my tab. We came in a good mood from OHSO(which was amazing for all those wondering) and this place totally bummed me out. The food that we had on our first visit was mediocre at best. We will drive to the Mesa one for our brass tap fix. Please fix this Brass Tap, so much potential."}
{"text":"Great service !! Great bartender jessica she was very friendly and awesome never had to wait for a drink !! Amazing selection of beer !! Will defiantly be back !! Thanks the old Chicago guy !!"}
{"text":"They have a Really good beer selection but the beer was warm and the cheese on the nachos... not so warm.  When this was brought to the attention of the manager my friend was told \"let me feel the glass... feels cold to me\"."}
{"text":"Service was awful! Server was Leah K. She was not friendly AT ALL and she never smiled. Didn't ask if we needed anything until we were almost done with our food. She was knowledgeable about the beers I'll give her that. Mac and cheese and burger was delicious. Fries were cold and not seasoned. Will not return."}
{"text":"Just had fish and chips, fresh golden batter perfect fries and good assortment of beer. Good service, I will be going back. No desert :( thoe"}
{"text":"Zero stars. Worst spot I've ever been to hands down. Owner would only play Cubs on big screen and soccer on others because that's what he liked watching,.... while hockey and basketball playoffs were on. I feel like the customer might be a priority over personal presence for early season baseball but oh well. Owner Dan had the nerve to argue with me about it without hiding at all his reasoning. Also... they were trying to play the soccer games on the big screen on YOUTUBE.... lol. I would give this a year of being in business.. AT THE MOST. Spend your hard earned money elsewhere if you care about any of the above. Cheers."}
{"text":"I wanted to wait to review this place after going a few times, so here are my thoughts after three visits.

1. The beer selection is extensive, but there aren't many \"rare\" or interesting options. This is a good spot to grab a beer in the Heritage District, but if you're willing to go outside the district, The Whining Pig or the Casual Pint are much better locations for beer lovers. 
2. The servers know nothing about beer to the point where it is almost comical. 
3. The food is pretty good. What you would expect for bar food. I personally enjoy it more than Whiskey Row next door. Not as great as Zinburger, but definitely more \"bar food\" options. 
4. Their seating situation is archaic. It is a seat-yourself establishment and once  all the tables are taken, they recommend you hover awkwardly until one opens up and grab it before someone else does.

Overall...meh."}
