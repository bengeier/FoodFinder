{"text":"Do you want to get abused and pay for third rate customer service? Then this is the right place for you.. 

Me and my family went for lunch on 11th Sunday afternoon and the manager on duty was Micky. We ordered food and when it was served the server had a big attitude written over her face and was not ready to tell us what was being served. While serving she mixed up the lunches and when questioned she just pushed off the plate on the table, sneered and walked away. Eat if you want..that was the attitude.
Surprisingly the manager Mucky was right behind our table and was observing it all but decided to feing ignorance. When I asked for the manager and explained him the situation to which he too was a witness and acknowledged the event unfold was apologetic for the sake of it. No remorse, no genuinety or seriousness of the complaint. 

Agreed the food portion is good but no one goes there to eat for free... you pay and expect decent service.  If you feel that I have a craving for good hakka food and don't care the way you are treated....please do go ahead and eat at this place and get insulted and abused by servers...after all its your comfort level that matters....

For me, I am going to take it up with the owner to see if he has a bit of santity to hire well mannered staff or would continue with such I'll mannered servers....."}
{"text":"Quick, easy service with really tasty food. Definitely my favourite takeout joint for Chinese food in the area. The people who work there are all very friendly.

As far as eating in goes, the service is good and the environment is better. It's a really nice looking place, but still very  friendly and casual. 

The lunch special in particular is definitely worthwhile! I always have plenty of leftovers"}
{"text":"For everone living in oakville Milton burlington and south west mississauga this is the best hakka by far. We do not have many authentic hakka places but this is up there with the palaces. They have a big room for family. Food has the right Thurka  (fried onion), meats r fresh. Spices r contolled but unleashed if you can handle. They have a truly masterful job of authentic hakka and made it not too far on erin mills parkway. 
 Also when your eating in store the number of people ordering takeaway is staggering so you know  it's good."}
{"text":"Good hakka Chinese restaurant. The Bombay Chicken (very popular) and manchiruan fried rice are my go to favourites. Reasonably priced and the food tastes good. Dine in service is pretty quick."}
{"text":"I've been a customer here a few times. The food used to be great and our favourite go to place for a quick, cheap meal. I'm not sure if the management has changed recently but the last couple of visits have been really bad. 
We went for the lunch special a few weeks ago and my friend ordered mix veggie balls in Manchurian sauce with fried rice. Her veggie balls were completely burnt. I ordered the spicy garlic chicken with fried rice and my food was ice cold. We told our server who really couldn't care (we didn't even get a sorry). Not to mention, I had to go up to the counter to place my order because the server had not been to our table in 15 minutes to take our order. 
We decided to let that one instance slide and catered from them for an event of 150 people. We specified no spice for the food. Our order turned out great except for the Manchurian beef which was exceptionally spicy. I called the restaurant the next day and was basically told that it's not possible for it to be spicy and that I'm lying about it. I've been waiting for three weeks for the management to call me back. Didn't get an apology - instead got told that I don't need to come back. 
They have lost their customer service and quality of food. Don't go here, I know I won't!!"}
{"text":"These guys have won us over with their service, quality and portion size of the dishes. The food is also fresh and quality of ingredients can be seen. 

Compared to other competitors near by like Eddies Wokn'Roll and Asian Wok, the portion size and quality of meat is above average and it shows by the crowds always dining here.

If they keep it up, they have a winner on their hands when it comes to halal Chinese cuisine."}
{"text":"The quality of the food in this restaurant went straight downhill from when I used to go before. This restaurant is cutting too much out and giving less to it's customers. We were a family of 6 and we ordered about 7 or 8 dishes. The portions used to be huge, considering looking at the other tables. When we got our dishes, no joke, they were half that amount, drenched in oil and sauce, very soggy. It also took about 45 mins to an hour to get our food. When we recieved our chili chicken, we asked for light on sauce. We got it and it was drenched, more than just getting a regular order! We asked to take it back, when they came out 15 mins after, it was undercooked. Never coming back. Stick to the other locations nearby, I'm saving you stress and money."}
{"text":"Very poor personal experience. The order is rarely correct, and the service was very poor."}
{"text":"Had corn soup - a small was a huge portion - and chicken pad thai and green chicken curry. The staff was very courteous and it was clean (minus bathrooms..) overall great spot and I cant wait to return!"}
{"text":"Previously called Tangerine. This place has great Hakka cuisine and I would highly recommend it. As always the waitstaff was attentive, quick and friendly. For the price, a great meal. The crispy ginger beef is a favourite and so is the spicy deep fried tofu. The spicy calamari is also very good and we love that there is a good variety of soups. We tried the house special Singapore vermicelli noodle with chicken. Awesome!! And generous portions too! Overall great food and good value."}
{"text":"Needed to try a new Hakka food place and when looking I found this place. Hence, went with family to try it out. Its always good to go with multiple people so you can order bunch of dishes and enjoy them. 

We ordered the Chilli Chicken, Sweet and Sour Manchurian Chicken, Bombay Fish, Honey & Garlic Chicken, Sweet and Sour Chicken. All the dishes were average but the portion size was decent and you will have order the rice separately. We also got their Hot and Sour soup which was nice.  

Service was fast and the server was friendly.

They do serve halal food but also serve alcohol."}
{"text":"Couple of things were good and the others not so tasty. The vegetable / chicken corn soup had a very thick broth which lacked taste as well. Also the Vegetable Manchurian Tofu gravy was tasteless. Nonetheless spicy Manchurian rice and spicy chicken gravy were worth having. Overall a moderate place and can be tried once."}
{"text":"Ordered food by recommendation and it was really bad . Chicken lollipop was made with Chick Pea flour and tasted really really bad . Bombay Shrimp was tasteless and the fried rice was undercooked . 
 
I am visiting Canada from US as was having digestion issues . On the brighter side , this food really fixed it . That's the only good thing I have to say about my whole experience."}
{"text":"We enjoyed our evening at Hakka Legend.  Service was friendly and efficient.  The waitress continually brought us water (even after we'd paid the bill and were just sitting).  We were extremely pleased with the portions and the food was really tasty.  Exactly what we wanted.  We agree it's the best Asian in the area.

Shared mango salad and entree each (Manchurian Beef and Green Coconut Curry) and came to $31 + tip.
There was a lot of in and out for take-out but not many for dine-in.
Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"This is our go to Hakka Chinese food joint.  We love this place.  My kids absolutely love the manchurian noodles and we love the Bombay chicken.  Bombay chicken is spicy but so flavourful. It's a dry chicken dish and no gravy. The spring rolls are very nice too. The staff is friendly and very fast. We always go back for more."}
{"text":"First of all I don't want give even a one star, but there is no option.

I am professional chef with many years of experience. I don't like to give bad comment on other chef food. I know how hard they work hard. I know the pain of a chef. But having said that this place doesn't deserve any good comment. I ordered for 60 dollars take out. 
1. Soup , they pour hot soup in thermo container. No common sense there. The container is melting because of heat. Soup taste very very averages.
2. Lollipop is so so bad coated with seasoning. So terrible that I couldn't express in words.
3. Chicken fried rice- any one is claiming that they serve Hakka food. Must know that they should not be serving proper Cantonese or mandarin food ( very mediocre and rice is not cooked also properly.
4. The worst thing you can even imagine or get. I will stop eating noodles rest of my life after just tasted one bite. Seriously garbage. All the pictures you are seeing after 5 people trying to eat and disappointed. Before going to garbage. Please please don't go to any of thisutter garbage place who stolen my 60$ today."}
{"text":"A good mix of great food, nice atmosphere, and great service. You may find a better tasting food elsewhere if you are only want a specific menu, but this is my go to place for a lunch/dinner meeting and also bringing guests. My favorite is their pakora and hakka noodles.. however, their food is generally good"}
{"text":"Is the second time I've been at this restaurant. For the lunch. Last time I got the Singapore noodles with the lunch special. Today I've got beef and black bean sauce with noodles.with the lunch special. The cost is under eight dollars. The flavours are very good. And I agree with the others hear that the portions are very big which is good. I was sitting here trying to calculate how much it would cost for them to make this dish and I don't know how they do it for eight dollars.friendly staff. And very fast service I would recommend this strongly for anyone needing to come for lunch or even dinner."}
{"text":"Kids want to eat noodle so we went to this place instead of fish and chips next door. The ambiance is very family orientate and clean. The service was good, constantly coming to add water and to ensure we are well served. For a Sunday lunch, with 5 tables where 2 tables has more than 6 people... The service was good... Lots of people walk in for take out too. 

As for the food we ordered. I will say it is typical Canadian Chinese food. The price is reasonable as it also come with a small side soup, a spring roll or a cane of pop. The soup was very very small... The spring roll seems to be home made, filling was okay, crunchy but very greasy... Next time, I will most likely choose a cane of pop for all my meal. The portion of the dish was good... We ordered 2 noodles and both seems to have the same sauce base... Just that the black bean beef one has lots of garlic in it. We also ordered green Thai curry which was satisfactory. 

Will try take out next time :)"}
{"text":"This is a good restaurant to date your hakka craving in my opinion. Not completely authentic but pretty good!"}
{"text":"There are so many hakka places near my office. I've tried all of them. I'm not a huge fan of hakka but I try everything at least once. 

Like every other hakka place, they do a lunch special to attract the business lunch crowd. I've tried 2 dishes here and both were just ok. I think I had the chilli chicken and the sesame chicken. The food is just ok. It comes in a Styrofoam box with meat on top of a bed of rice...a lot of rice. You can easily finish all the meat and have lots of rice left. They don't make it very saucy and I guess that's to appease the more western customers who like to eat tidy meals.

For the price I paid, I would say I got what I paid for. Hakka food never blows me away. It's always been more of a fusion food than Chinese food to me. And I don't have any special reasons to come here instead of the other hakka places. But it's a place I wouldn't mind eating at if I'm in the area and don't crave something else."}
{"text":"Went for dinner at around 6:30 on a Sunday. Just a couple of tables were occupied. We have been there a few times already, but this is my first review. It is now called Hakka Legend. 

Started with a Vegetarian Manchow Soup. Very different from the ones I have tried. Very peppery (black) and with lots of fried crispy noodles and som tofu and green peas. Disappointing choice. 

We ordered for mains a Schewan Paneer Fried Rice, Vegetarian Manchurian Hakka Noodles, Vegetarian Manchurian Balls with gravy and Spicy Garlic Tofu with Mixed Vegetables. The Manchurian Balls and Mixed vegetables also come with a bowl of white plain rice. 

The Paneer rice was a bit too much oily and lacked spice. The amount of paneer was on the low end as well. The Hakka Noodles as well was low in flavour and high in oil. The Manchurian Balls came with the sauce that was perfect but the balls were too soft. The perfect ones always have some crunch left while still in the gravy. The Garlic Tofu Mixed Vegetables were the best although the skimped on the Tofu. 

The quantity of Fried Rice, Noodles and Manchurian Balls were more than we could handle. Lots left for lunch/dinner tomorrow. 

Disappointing visit."}
{"text":"Amazing place to get chili chicken. Now I don't have to drive to Markham to get Hakka food.
The staff are super friendly. The place is clean."}
{"text":"I came here with my friend at 6pm on a Wednesday just before bingo around the corner. 

There was only two other occupied tables so we were seated immediately. Seated immediately at a table that clearly wasn't cleaned properly. The table surface directly in front of me had a dirty bowl mark on the table. I was really put off by this, but covered it with a napkin and got on with it.

We order the beef and broccoli and the house special hakka noodles. Both dishes looked good and tasted good enough that I was willing to overlook the dirty table which I had since covered and pretty much forgotten about. The service staff were very friendly as well, so I really can't complain about anything else. 

If I am on this side of the Greater Toronto Area again (ie, going to bingo), I'll likely come here again, food was ace, also because I am absolutely unfamiliar with Mississauga. I can see this as a decent local restaurant if I lived nearby, getting takeout here and all, so even if you can't stop in for a meal, you can still get a takeaway order and I'm sure the quality will be just as good. Either way, just come here and try for yourself."}
{"text":"Cheapest & the most delish lunch specials ~ $5.99-$6.99 for a main course plus a soup/salad/ pop (upgrade to noodles or fried rice for $1.75). Great service, massive portions and each dish is finger-licking good but the best is chilli chicken/beef/fish, ginger chicken (a bit on the sweet side) and the mango chicken. This is a family favourite, we go here a least twice a month and are always beyond satisfied."}
{"text":"They don't listen clearly to customers requests. For example; if you want a spicy dish and ask them if \"ginger chicken\" is good. They say \"yes\" but when it comes out sweet, they are upset at you for wanting spicy. Not really a fan anymore."}
{"text":"If I was rating food alone, this would be 5 stars no question. However, below average service knocked them down one star. The chicken Lollypops were on point, and the veggie noodles were amazing. I can see why they have a huge takeout business.

After saying all that, I would come back in the future."}
{"text":"Just okay. Not the best hakka. The place is nice and clean. The food isn't very flavourful though. Meh. Wouldn't come again."}
{"text":"Hakka legend is my most favourite hakka Chinese restaurant in GTA. I am a regular but at a different location. It's a shame this location doesn't live up to the committed taste. I will try and sugarcoat my words here as much as I can. 

The most terrible experience I've ever had. Unprofessional and rude staff. Even the Manager doesn't give a shit. He will act like he cares but if he really did it would show in his gesture or in the service next time. Never ever work to make the customers happy. Just slammed the water on our table. Not even once I've asked if my food taste okay. Where do you think you guys are runnimg this restaurant? Hellloooo it's Canada. Doesn't hold even one quality of the Canadian Customerservice culture here. 

Experience here always makes me crawl out of skin. Whenever a concern is raised regarding the taste or quantity of the dish they just nodded and walked away saying they can't do anything about it. NEVER tried to fix it. We've been here now 5 times and came out unhappy every single time. One thing we always feel is they don't care if you're a unhappy customer as they're anyway getting the crowd by the name itself. I've overheard so many customers complain about the food. Try giving a feedback or ask them to make some change in their crappy food and you'll see what I mean. When one goes to a chain they expect to receive the same/similar experience. 

Go to Markham/Scarborough location from the exact same menu, order any item and it's comes out the same. However here it looks completely different. They made us pay for something that should have been already included in the dish. 

I'll be happy if I could save one Customer from having a terrible experience n would stop going here after reading this review. You'll understand why I'm so upset with this location only if you've been to other locations of Hakka Legend. 

For anyone who needs proofs, pictures and videos of the same dish ordered at Mississauga and Markham that doesn't even look same hit me up.

Long story short- These guys need to listen and act to the customers feedback. Also pull your team together and arrive to one recipe for all locations. And stop hiring \"JERKS\""}
{"text":"Poor quality of Chinese food , worst I had in GTA , lunch special is bad deal . Ordered spring roll , chilli beef with steam rice .
Tasteless chilli beef !!!! Spring roll Arvind after we finished our meal , may be they serve it as a dessert .

Last visit , mood recommended for Chinese food lovers ."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service I ordered a soup to go the manager served it to me. It was served with the lid open and the bag was not knotted up. Causing soup to spill all over my seat. Called them to let them know of their short comings and not even an apology was offered. The manager \"Jimmy\" didn't even bother responding to my call or messages. Would never return, hakka places are known for their lack of courtesy or care for the customers but this is just ridiculous."}
{"text":"My favourite hakka style restaurant.  It's is Chinese style food with indian influence.  The paneer szechuan fried rice is my favorite.

There's always busy but the restaurant is large enough that you don't have to wait for a table. 


The servers are friendly."}
{"text":"Recently went here and had the Chili Tofu. It was terrible. The gravy was pretty much water with no flavor at all. I thought the gravy would be brown but it was pure white. It was like eating tofu, rice, and water. I will give this place another try."}
{"text":"Heard a lot about this place. The food is OK but the service is worst then McDonalds. Anyway the food taste like cheap street food from Bombay. If U want to be sick the next day then this is the place for U. Don't go here as U will be treating your self to a nightmare with your guest."}
{"text":"It does not taste very good. I bought their lunch special it was a good deal cost like $10. I got the chilli chicken and hot and sour soup. The food was completely tasteless. It was so bland it does not taste very good. However for the price the quantity was a lot. It would be good if they worked on their recipe some more"}
{"text":"2nd time here with a large group.  Service was better this time around.  

Manchurian fried rice was spot on - excellent amount of spiciness.  Tiger shrimp veg mix and fish pakora were also delicious highlights.  Would not order the chili beef again as the sauce was too starchy."}
{"text":"One of my favourite Hakka places ever. Prices are decent and ambiance and service is nice. For better value there is a wonderful lunch special until 3pm with very large portions. Highly recommended! Dry crispy beef and chicken pakoras are personal favourites"}
{"text":"Be careful! Very dishonest store as they add the tip to your bill without showing you the itemized receipt. Then you unknowingly add the tip and pay double....AVOID these unethical people."}
{"text":"Had a horrible experience! I ordered yellow curry asking whether it would be spicy as I can't handle spice. The waitress said she would ask the chef. She didn't seem to know what was in the curry because it came out smelling spicy and had chilli flakes in it. I had a bite and immediately tasted tobasco sauce. When we asked if we could return it to get something else she said no. She should recommended against when I asked and perhaps been a bit more accomodating. I've been here several times but after such poor service and a disgusting dish I don't think I'd return."}
{"text":"As we go here often, we chose to bring home take out yesterday. While eating her rice and chicken, my daughter found a bunch of hair in her mouth.  She immediately threw it out.

Safe to say, they lost a customer."}
{"text":"I went with my friends and ordered Szechuan noodles, chicken fried rice, spicy beef and lollipop chicken. The food came fast. however, I was very disappointed because the only dish I enjoyed was the lollipop chicken. The Spicy beef wasn't spicy and barely had any taste. It wasn't hot either. Fried chicken on the rice felt dry. Noodles did not have any taste either.

I am not sure why the food didn't taste good as this place is usually busy. There are far better and cheap Hakka places around the block so I would never go to this place again."}
{"text":"There are much better options in Mississauga if your looking for Hakka food.

The beef was kind of tough and the chili chicken lacked flavour.

There fried rice is pretty decent.

The service isn't the best."}
{"text":"The food was spot on and was as good as Hakka food I've had in GTA.

Good size portions, clean and spacious, friendly staff and reasonable prices.  I couldn't ask for more.

4 stars only because I'm not a fan of Hakka style cuisine in general."}
{"text":"This place has the BEST dry Bombay chicken. It's so delicious!  5 stars for the Bombay."}
{"text":"I crave this place whenever I'm in Meadowvale. Amazing food, great prices & great service! We came for an early dinner, I had the honey garlic chicken w/ fried rice, and the fish pakora to start. The food came out fresh & fast. We got large portions too. Needless to say I'll keep coming back, I love this place."}
{"text":"Poor service and even worse food!! Don't waste your money they are rude and don't care about there service to customers no wonder they had to change there name in one year!!!"}
{"text":"Went there for the first time for dinner. Seemed like we ate chillies with meat in it. The food was so spicy that the sweet and sour shrimp seemed like dessert to us. It was so spicy that I could taste anything. All the dishes tasted the same to me. Not sure if I will go again."}
