{"text":"Finally! After trying many Mexican restaurants all thru Phoenix & Scottsdale we found an authentic Mexican restaurant that was AMAZING! Fresh tortilla chip & salsa ready and waiting at the table when we sat down. Food was incredible! I ordered the combo with a beef tamale with red sauce & chicken enchilada. Both were full of meat from beginning to end & had so much flavor! Highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"Been eating here for 15yrs. They have the best salsa in town. I always get the #2 beef. The Mexican pizza is a great option for sharing with another person. It gets busy, so get there early on the weekends, or order to go like we always do."}
{"text":"I dont know why so many not so great reviews... :( I live in surprise and whenever were near and hungry we try and stop in and have some good cooking. There food is good, the prices are good, service has always been excellent. No its not omg amazing and i cant live without but its good."}
{"text":"Definitely the best neighborhood mexican joint. Half price margs on friday - yes please.

The carnitas dinner is delicious. Also the blake tacos are a winner. I've tried other dishes, but those are the best two on the menu - hands down.

A great place to go with friends and have a relaxed and cheap meal out, while having great service. 

Def a winner."}
{"text":"Excellent Mexican food restaurant.  The place is always clean, friendly service and reasonably priced.  Both food and service quality are consistent.  Friday and Saturday evenings they get very busy, so you may end up waiting to get a table.  However, it is worth the wait."}
{"text":"Margarita! The rice is tasty, the refried beans are just a touch spicy (kids couldn't eat them). The margarita was fantastic, as was the poco pollo dinner (pollo fundidit), cheese crisp appetizer. It's cute but quite small restaurant. If you go at dinner time, you are likely to wait 20-30 minutes. The chips are tasty, and salsa is super spicy. We won't go with kids, but will definitely go again."}
{"text":"Awesome happy hour Margaritas for $3!!
Everything you could want in a Mexican Spot- service isn't the greatest but everyone is super friendly! 
Great atmosphere and my Son who never eats anything but fries loved the chicken strips!!"}
{"text":"Very authentic Mexican food. Refried beans were excellent, and the Carne Asada Chimichanga was fantastic. Decent décor and mariachi music playing in the background. Service was prompt and the restaurant was clean. Located in an unattractive strip mall, this restaurant is a hidden gem. My highest recommendation."}
{"text":"Great customer service!!! Friendly staff!! Food, drinks and check were prompt and easy on the checkbook. 
Please give this place a try you will never go to another Mexican food resturant again"}
{"text":"Worst carne asada burrito. No carne they used GROUND BEEF!!! I would not recommend this place to anyone who wants authentic mexican food."}
{"text":"Our go to place to eat Mexican food! Delicious! The carne asada burrito is melt in your mouth!"}
{"text":"Very good! Small quaint place with a very homey atmosphere.  Service is good and food is awesome.  My son never liked guacamole until he tried it here.  Loved it! Have been here many times and will continue to come back!"}
{"text":"I love the Tortilla Soup here, as well as many other dishes.  I eat here often, as it is close to home and work, both.  Service is friendly, food is great and it's not expensive at all!  What more could you ask for!"}
{"text":"Neighborhood go to, the food is good and the people amazing.  I have never had a bad experience here, except for the dinner wait time to be seated.  But that is to be expected with good food.  You can't go wrong."}
{"text":"I'm baffled at how poorly rated this place is. I just ate here for the first time and loved it. I was there with a large party of people. We sat down with fresh chips and salsa being put on the table, our drink orders were taken almost right away, and the food came out unexpectedly quickly given our group size. 
First thing when we sat down, the owner came out to say hi and check on us. I would certainly not call that poor service. The waiter was good humored and rolled with our jokes. 
I don't know what people have been getting that causes them to say the food is alright at best. I had the mexican shrimp burro and I can honestly say it was, by far, the best mexican food I have ever had, and very filling. Sure, the beans and rice are nothing to call home about but, let's face it, how many restaurants have you been to where the beans and rice were phenomenal? However, one person in our party ordered pinto beans instead of the standard refried beans, and they looked delicious.
Other people in our party also really enjoyed their special grilled salmon and the salmon tacos. 
It's disappointing that this place has such a low overall rating, because that means most people won't even check to see if there is a good review. If anyone does though, please just go try it for yourself.
And for the people who have had coupon issues: Yes, it sucks that they didn't honor your coupon but I ALWAYS ask if a place will accept the coupon before I just order, assuming they will. So it's really not fair to just write a place off because of a coupon issue. But hey, that's your loss.

EDIT: I just checked out the \"filtered\" reviews... for whatever reason, that's where all the 5 star reviews went. Which would explain why they have such a poor rating."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere,  staff is friendly we just stopped bye to get some Mexican food and the experience was awesome.  I recommend everyone to eat here.  Best  mexican food in phoenix,  ate there last night and wished we went back tonight unfortunately we went to another mexican restaurant closer to our hotel and was very disappointed with not only the food but the price and service."}
{"text":"We love this place have been going in here for years. The food, ambiance and staff are great. They have the best cheese crisp in town.. What's up with all the bad reviews is beyond me. A lot of people now days love complaing and trashing people behind a computer when they don't get their way about things. Go try it! You won't be dissapointed guaranteed.."}
{"text":"One phenomenal restaurant! Certainly our family's favourite, so much so we still travel about forty minutes to eat here. Amazing service and good food. Would suggest to anyone! THE MARGARITAS ARE AWESOME.
Family owned.."}
{"text":"I ate at this restaurant three times during a week long visit to Scottsdale.  I love the food and service so much I kept coming back."}
{"text":"Service was great as were the tacos. Chile Relleno and a shredded chicken burrito were just ok. I guess we went in with higher expectations based off the other yelp reviews."}
{"text":"Great restaurant! We have been going there for several years now and have tried most of the menu and nothing disappoints. They have several items like the diabolo burro and the shrimp enchiladas that are like nothing anywhere else.  The grilled salmon and vegetables is healthy and delicious.  If you want something a bit out of the ordinary try something new at Don Reubens!"}
{"text":"Girlfriend and I dined here recently, and we had the best meal.  The service was excellent, and my burrito was perhaps the best I've ever had.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Look, if you like Tex -Mex like me, this is your place. Enough said about the food. 

Now for my exciting trip to the restroom! I walked up to the toilet, took a leak, and then looked at the flushing mechanism. It was held together by two brackets and a plastic tube! I thought 'Neat! This makes a perfect sitcom situation.' Check it out!"}
{"text":"The Margarita's there are awesome. We go at least a few times a month. The food is really good too."}
{"text":"authentic, tasty Mexican food with great service. local family restaurant with amazing food and very reasonable prices. don't miss the chance to eat here."}
{"text":"I really like Don Rubens and I would give them 5 stars if they expanded their menu...their menu doesn't have a huge selection like most Mexican restaurants do.

However, the food is really good (LOVE their beef tacos...great season to the meat) and ALL of the staff is really nice...so no major complaints :)"}
{"text":"Just tried this restaurant for the first time this evening and it was amazing...the hostess and server were courteous and for as busy as they were we had our food in a very short time.  Our family has been looking for a Mexican restaurant that rivaled our favorite place back home for two years and I think we've finally done it.  We will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Passed by plenty of times and finally ate here, food is better than most Mexican restaurants, salsa was really good, the rice was a little bland though."}
{"text":"OMG..The Carne Asada is WOW! And anything Poco polo style..not to mention $5 margaritas are loaded!
Highly recommended :)"}
{"text":"I have been eating at this restaurant since it opened back in 2001. Don Ruben's has become a huge portion of my life and I cannot be more grateful towards this restaurant for consistently providing excellent food, service, prices and atmosphere. Every meal at Don Ruben's tastes fresh, delicious, and authentic. Although I haven't had everything on the menu personally, many family members and friends over the years describe their meals just the same. Truly this Sonoran Style Mexican Food is worth every penny. 

 Some of my favorite eats here, besides their chips and salsa that I smother everything in, is their cheese quesadilla (cheese crisp), poco pollo pizza, cheese enchiladas, tacos, and many more! Their quesadilla is by far the best I've ever had and is a house favorite. I have been to several Mexican food restaurants in AZ and I always order a cheese crisp just so I can compare to Don Ruben's cheese crisp. Believe me when I tell you, Don Ruben's is by far the best. Each bite is cheesy, flaky, crispy, and golden. Put their refreshing mild salsa on it and you're in heaven. The poco pollo pizza also has a delicious deep fried tortilla base with flavorful jalapeño cream cheese, shredded chicken and green enchilada sauce that will make you want to eat the whole pizza to yourself. I also recommend trying their cheese enchiladas, tamales, flautas (rolled tacos), and tacos. These menu items are an absolute staple and must-try along with a side of rice and beans. I've also had Don Ruben's catered several times and each time everyone has flocked over to the fiesta platter that has my favorite, the delightful mini chimi's! 

 Every menu item at Don Ruben's is so beyond joyous to eat and very affordable!! The most I've spent on myself was a grand total of $25. That included: drink (non-alcoholic), chips and salsa, cheese crisp, combo dinner, and sopapillas! I got more than my money's worth and I was more than satisfied and extremely full. I have also been counting down the days for my 21st birthday so that I can finally try their margaritas, from what I hear are to die for!

 Overall, Don Ruben's has always been a fantastic place for food, service, and company. Don Ruben's is my go-to restaurant because of how much I love not only their food but their unfailing excellent service. I've never waited more than 30 minutes even on a very busy Saturday! I'm always greeted with the warmest smiles and very familiar faces. I also love how Steve, the owner of Don Ruben's, goes around the restaurant to greet customers and make them feel as comfortable as possible. Every waiter/waitress has been expertly trained and knows how to accommodate all kinds of party sizes! Food comes out fast, hot, and presentable. My order has NEVER been messed up either! On a more personal level, Don Ruben's has been a place that I consider my family dinner table. I've planned a meal here for almost every life event; graduation gatherings, countless birthday celebrations, family reunions, business outings, and many more! Their atmosphere excites me and makes me feel a part of their family. Don Ruben's has a way of filling not just your stomach but your heart. I highly recommend waiting in line and getting a taste for you and your family and friends to enjoy!"}
{"text":"the best mex ever!  my wfe andi have been coming hrer for several years, nev er been disappointed"}
{"text":"The best mexican food u can get.  We love this place.  Food is fantastic and the people are always smiling and more then friendly.  Service is great even when busy they take care of you quickly.  One of my pet peeves is waiting on water but here you'd think the water cups have there own taps.  Can't say enough great things about this place.  If u are wanting Mexican food this is the place"}
{"text":"My husband and went for lunch yesterday and we were very impressed with the service (really friendly and efficient) and the food was delicious!!! We will definitely be returning!!!"}
{"text":"By far the best mexican  food in the Phoenix area.  Food is authentic, home made and service is awesome."}
{"text":"First Off...Salsa is some of the best I've tried...growing up in  So. Cal.and now in Az...that's a statement!
My friend and I ordered both Mexican pizzas....We enjoyed both equally, and could not choose a favorite! 
Service is very good, and the owner dropped by for a quick chat and greeting.
Prices were very reasonable and the portions were large."}
{"text":"Great food. I'm from Southern California and this is one of the only places that I've found in the West Valley that serves decent Mexican food. The added bonus is getting to sit in the dining room and listen to the Puerto Rican and Cuban salsa music playing while I'm eating. Of course most of the diners who eat here have no clue and they think it's just Mexican music.. Lol!"}
{"text":"best mexican food ever! Taco dinner plate is great and the margaritas are second to none."}
{"text":"We go to Don Rubens alot n we LOVE it there. 5 of us went Friday night n I put our name in n she said the wait was 20 to 30 minutes. Jokingly I said OK I just REALLY need my CHEESE FIX.  When they called my name n sat us the owner came to the table immediately with a Cheese Crisp in hand n says, She needs her cheese! Thank you sir! We love Don Rubens n will be back soon! N alot more in the future......"}
{"text":"So good! So good! So good! Thank goodness Don Ruebens isn't too far of a drive because my fuel bill would be astronomical!!! Their service is impeccable, always friendly and I always get the feeling that they are just as happy to have us eat there as we are! Food is consistently delicious and I always leave there fat and happy. The wait staff is super attentive, drinks, chips and salsa are bottomless! I've tried multiple different menu items and I've always been impressed. Great for families, a couple of margaritas after work with a co-worker or significant other or to just come in for the food and ambience by yourself! I got wind of this gem from a friend who lived in SURPRISE. If someone willing to make a 40+ minute drive doesn't convince you, I don't know what will!"}
{"text":"I ate there for the first time over the weekend.  The best cheese crisp I've ever had!  The chips are served fresh and warm.  The salsas are tasty.  I had a beef taco - also delicious.  Even the margarita was top notch!"}
{"text":"I am not a big fan of Mexican food but as this place was around the corner from our home and both me and my boyfriend wanted some drinks, we thought we'd give them a try. We love a good local hole in the wall. This place was almost perfect.

I had the Blake's tacos and I asked to have the tomatillo sauce on the side. I loved them and wish I could order them a la carte without the beans or rice. 

Our only disappointment was that the margaritas were not very strong."}
{"text":"We have been going here for years! We now have everyone we know addicted! The Poco Pollo is delicious. My kids like the cheese enchiladas with chicken also. A nice lunch is the taco salad or the mini chimi's. I can go on and on. The owner and servers are so amazing and sweet. It is always worth the wait, if there is one. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Hunter Hudson and I went to Don Rubens for lunch today!!!
Great service
Great food
We've been going there for about 6 years now."}
{"text":"Yum! I have come here twice now, and can't get enough of their chips and salsa.  The meal servings are always more than I can finish, and dont break my bank.   Their service had been quick to sit ys down, take orders, and refill drinks."}
{"text":"Just awesome. Great service. Really good food. Outstanding cheese crisp. Yummy margaritas."}
{"text":"We've enjoyed this restaurant for years, great prices, courteous staff, and the best chicken tortilla soup I've found in a restaurant. Food is always consistently good. A neighborhood gem!"}
{"text":"This resturant consistently has great food, attentive, kind wait staff and adverse prices for this area. The portions are large so plan on taking some home. Nothing amazing about the clean decor, it's as you'd expect from a Mexican restaurant. I have a peppercorn allergy (severe) so I'm careful about where & what I eat. Don Rubens staff is always polite & accommodating!"}
{"text":"My family and I have been going to Don Rubens regularly for 15 yrs and have never had an issue. However, we haven't been back since March 18 2017 when 8 of my family members got horrible food poisoning. We don't believe it was spoiled food but rather someone contaminated our food from handling it. Unfortunately my family and I have had to find a new Mexican restaurant that serves great food."}
{"text":"My coworkers and I have eaten here for over a year now and have never had the problems listed above.   Frankly, I was stunned to read about them.  If you like your food piping hot and portions that leave you feeling more than full  AND you like high quality food then this is the place for you.  FOR RECORD, I do not, nor have I ever worked for Don Ruben's restaurant nor do I even know the owners or workers.   I am however, as soon as I am done writing this going to pick up 3 dozen tamales for Christmas.   BTW, try the Chicken Nachos and then tell me you did not get your moneys worth.  Go ahead, I dare ya.  :-)"}
{"text":"Fun friendly place. The food is ok & better than other Mexican places in the same area."}
{"text":"I have lived in Phoenix for over 20 years and just started eating here last year! Crazy...I know! A few months before I had my daughter last year,  a friend of mine wanted to meet for lunch and suggested this place. Always saw it when I would drive by but never went.....until that day....and since then I have been hooked!

The place is small and fills up FAST but the food is worth it and the staff is super friendly! Its the only place to go for Mexican food in the west valley. So if you are in the mood for some really good food, dont waste your money by going to a mexican food chain. Grab the family, friend (s) or a date and head over to Don Rubens. You all will leave happy and and satisfied"}
{"text":"Excellent food, even better service!  Food came out promptly, very hot and we never had an empty glass.  We will absolutely come here again!"}
{"text":"I live right down the street from this place and have been there more times than I can count. At one point we were going about once a week. The food is just okay, but the margaritas and guacamole are very good. That's the main reason to go.
I've had two BIG problems with this place. First, they take reservations but don't honor them when you show up. We had a reservation, but when we showed up (on time), they simply put our name at  the bottom of the waiting list. And then told me that's how they do things. We left and didn't return for about 8 months.
Second problem came when I took my mom there for lunch. I ordered the taco plate, bit in and broke a tooth on the taco shell, which was NOT fresh. It was hard as a rock and yet gummy, like a stale shell had been steamed. First time I'd had a problem with freshness here, but it was an expensive problem. Anyway that was 4 months ago and I won't go back."}
{"text":"between portions shrinking and the subtle rising cost of a meal at this establishment, Don Rubens is now in the rear view mirror. 

This place was a go-to place for us for a long time, however, we have noticed these 'changes' occurring slowly over a relatively short period of time. 

With quite a few quality restaurants offering just as good - and better - fare and ambiance available in the surrounding area, this place just isn't the over the top place it once was.

A substantial change in quality and taste in their food combined with a 'blah' sort of atmosphere permeating the room has led us to explore other restaurants that appeal more to what we had come to enjoy here in the past. 

I'm being very nice here, out of respect. 
Thank you ladies and gentlemen."}
{"text":"The average Mexican food restaurant better than the chain just a place for the masses no real spicy flavor in any of the food I mean I would come back it wasn't bad it was good just not a whole lot of flavor the fajitas no spice to him little too fatty on the meat our server was okay no real personality though just going through the motions of working so if you were thinking about going to a manual for Garcia's or something like that skip them and go here will be very happy"}
{"text":"I was disappointed with the food. Too cheesy not authentic Mexican food at all. Service was good. But food not so good. I've had better."}
{"text":"After our failed attempts finding food and drinks at La Santisima Gourmet Taco Shop  and Las Gloria's Grill, we finally found a GREAT SPOT for some Mexican food and margaritas @ Don Ruben's Mexican!!! Great food, great drinks, and damn good service!!! 
We had been driving around the valley for 2.5 hours before we discovered this little gem! We waited about 20-25 minutes to be seated (as we were quoted), the place was packed, and now I know why!!!  

EVERYTHING (and I do mean everything) was hot, fresh, and full of flavor. The hostesses, the waiters, and the waitresses were pleasantly attentive. 

We will DEFINITELY return to Don Ruben's Mexican!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place was awesome. Some of the best Mexican food we've ever had! The pitcher of margaritas was a little light on the tequila - but we ordered an extra shot and everyone was happy. Great service and great good. Thanks!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! We never would've went here if it wasn't for the yelp reviews.

Great margaritas, and even better food.  Their service was very good and very friendly. We really enjoyed it - even the kids that are picky."}
{"text":"Although this was a nice looking restaurant and good service I believe the food was just average. It tasted good but it did not taste homemade.   I've had a lot worse but also a lot better so I'm only giving it three stars.  It wasn't bad at all it was just OK"}
{"text":"Excellent tortilla chips, light and crispy. Great salsa with substance; not that tomato sauce with chili flakes that you get in most Mexican restaurants. Lunch special prices are a bargain at $7 from 11-3. I enjoyed the crispy beef taco and cheese enchilada with rice and beans. Taco was packed with juicy shredded beef in an oversized corn tortilla and the enchilada sauce was packed with flavor. I have a new favorite place to eat!"}
{"text":"If you ever want authentic mexican food then this is the place to try. My family and I have been coming here for the past year and absolutely love it. The food, service and atmosphere is amazing!  The owner is extremely nice and very welcoming. I can't stress enough how amazing the food is, especially the Poco Pollo Pizza and of course their margaritas too!"}
{"text":"Great food here and cheap! Had a chimichanga the first time I was here and fajitas this time. Both were excellent. Service was quick (busy first time and only a few tables sat at 2pm this time). The salsa is too runny for my taste but it comes free with chips. 

Phoenix has a lot of great Mexican restaurants but this one's my favorite."}
{"text":"Stared coming here to Don Rubens as a recommendation from a friend and have been going there ever since...Hubbys Favorite is Shrimp Enchiladas that sauce is AMAZING! The beans could use some work, but overall this restaurant is a Good Local place! Chips and Salsas are ADDICTING!"}
{"text":"I'm gonna agree with Stevey P. You can find better mexican food elsewhere.  Is it terrible? No, but it isn't something to write home about. 

The service was adequate, but they did get one of my party's order incorrect.  He did get his plate replaced rather quickly, but it was a simple red/green burrito mix-up.

The hostess/waitress's breath was KICKIN!  IT was a serious problem!  They have a giant bowl of mints by the door, I really wish she had taken full advantage of that.  And while her service was attentive, she brought drinks out like no body's business, we really didn't want her coming to our table.  It was really bad.  I would probably not come here again."}
{"text":"First time here, have been wanting to go for a long time, but is always so busy, which is a good thing.  I had a shredded beef chimichanga all a cart. Chips are thin and crisp, salsa had a good flavor. My husband had the #2 ( 2 beef tacos with rise and beans.  Prices very reasonable also.  We will be back."}
{"text":"If you want a great fish taco this is the place to go. Since Ive moved here which wasnt too long ago, I always order cheese enchiladas with rice and whole beans (if I can find them) and a fish taco on the side. The fish taco was seasoned and fried to perfection. It reminded of what I got from back home growing up. The fact they have whole beans (here for some reason in arizona they call em ranchero versus charro or borracho beans which what I call em) are one of the reasons I  love this place. Being able to mix my rice and beans is as good as it gets with a pacifico. The cheese enchiladas I had were also tasty. The sauce was very tex mex and made it that much better. I have been there 3 times now and the place just keeps getting better."}
{"text":"Totally underwhelming Mexican food.  Even Macayo's and Chipotle burritos have cost less with bigger portions, and tasted better.  I ordered a simple rice, bean and guacamole ($6.95) burrito for lunch.  I mean, how hard can that be to MESS up?  

But they piled some warm slimy goop (frijoles, I imagine) in a tortilla and called it done.  I have heard this location has been several other ill-fated restaurants before.  Let's hope this one can stay a while.  Lunch service was slower than expected - only 2 servers but with 10 parties.

Their signature dish was the poco pollo - basically a chicken chimi with heart clogging jalapeno cream cheese - a standard dish at most Mexican eateries.  Might be worth it - who knows? The inside decor is nice a warm modern Mexican look, but with booths and cheap tables/chairs throughout.  They also serve tequila and margaritas yet have NO BAR.  WTF?"}
{"text":"Food is fantastic. I love their carne Assad burrito, so is their poco pollo. The service is absolutely the top notch. The waiters are all very friendly and care about what you actually have to say about your orders and really always check on you. Chips are always full and salsa is bomb! Been going here for years and I highly recommend this place!!!"}
{"text":"We loved ur food!! And honestly speaking I am truly satisfied only because I am quite picky when it comes to Mexican food and I would have to say it was grand to say something very tasty, so good for you!"}
{"text":"I just so happened to leave my wallet here.  The next day i frantically called them to find they had it locked up and waiting for me.  What a great place with honest people.  We eat here with the family 3 or 4 times each month.  Kids love it as well. If you like Mexican food and servers that are the nicest around, run don't walk to Don Rubens. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Finally! We moved to Phoenix from Texas a year ago and we've been looking everywhere for something similar to Texmex. We found it at Don Ruben's! The chips and salsa are great! The salsa isn't spicy, but It has good flavor. The cheese enchiladas are some of the best I've ever had. The enchilada sauce is a brown gravy, not a red sauce. The rice and beans are also good! The frozen house margarita is not good. It's almost foamy and is watered down, however, the flavored margaritas are really good! This will definitely be our new \"go to\" spot!"}
{"text":"A friend recommended this place and we loved it!! The food was great and the service was fantastic!!!"}
{"text":"This is been our go to spot for years. Always having birthday dinners here great food and service."}
{"text":"So good. Have the cheese crisp for an app. What a great find. The chips and salsa is good, the tamales are good, margaritas were good. Fiesta dip is good and the mini chimis. Everything we had was delicious."}
{"text":"Just had the worse customer experience . Went in for dinner and the hostess was great. She was very nice and sat us at a table promptly. Chips and salsa came quickly and she asked if we wanted hot sauce. My wife replied yes and thank you. Chip person just put down the chips and salsa and walked away without another word said. Wife and I sat waiting for 20 minutes watching people get seated and drinks right away. We watched as 4 people got their food orders done mind you they came in after us. Wife and I sat there and haven't even gotten our drink orders in. We've been here in the past and never had this issue. It might be said they are busy and just trying to keep up but when 4 different groups come in after you and get their orders in before you can even get a drink order in there's no excuse for that."}
{"text":"Been coming here for ages.  I have never had a bad experience, from the food to the service, it has always been way above par.  Beats any of the local chains, and definitely any national chain. Local family owned goodness right here.

Headed there right now, got hungry just thinking about it."}
{"text":"**** not authentic Mexican food**
Ok so my review is based on the food, first of all don't come to this place if your expectations are to have some amazing Mexican food. 
This is more of the Americanized Mexican food and while it isn't that bad I can't really say that it was all that good. 
I had the chimichanga platter which to be honest was ok. The meat was tasty (shredded beef) but that was it. The rice was not very good and it was mushy. The beans also did not taste good. The salsa had this fishy after taste. They only have one stall in the bathroom so if it's packed, good luck. The service was good and in all fairness the food was not that bad it just to me was not what I would consider Mexican. I personally feel that this place is ok and if you come with the expectation that you are not getting authentic Mexican food than you will like it. On a positive note they have coke products."}
{"text":"WOW!  Two 5 star reviews for Don Rubens??  Did they fire their entire staff and revamp their entire menu since the last time I've been there???  The food is a 2.5 at best.  The service is the same.  If you want sub par Mexican food and dont want to drive to Macayos or Garcias for other sub par Mexican food go to Don Rubens.  The only thing even worth mentioning is their sopapillas for dessert.  Thats about the only thing worth ordering."}
{"text":"Personally Don Ruben's is my favorite Mexican restaurant in town! My boyfriend and I love coming here and we receive excellent service every time. My favorite is the enchilada style bean chimichanga, my boyfriend gets the cheese enchiladas. We have a hard time getting anything but our usual's because we love them so much! Chips and salsa are definitely my favorite along with the cheese crisps. Super crispy!! I recommend Don Ruben's to everyone looking for good Mexican food."}
{"text":"Great food, friendly staff. I am a regular here and have all good reviews. I typically try something new each time I'm here and haven't had anything yet that I didn't like. I would like to see the menus cleaned up a bit I had to wash my hands after viewing them last time I was here."}
{"text":"Hmmm.  Where to start???  If you are a big fan of salty food this your place. Service was fair to say the least. The chip and salsa lady made more visits then the waiter. Not sure where all the stars came from.  Possibly we dined in on an off night??"}
{"text":"Don Rubens is THE BEST Mexican restaurant in all of AZ. My family and I visit when we need our little Mexican fix and we are never disappointed. The chips and salsa are amazing and so is everything else. It's family run and as authentic as it gets. The plates are warm when they bring them to your table and every last bite is a treat. Let me just tell you now, you won't be able to get enough of their re-fríed beans. :)"}
{"text":"Not sure what happened today. The cheese crisp was totally greasy and we could not eat it. The green chili burrito was just ok at best. My sons Food was also just ok. He did say the best thing of the dinner was the chips.  May want to thank twice before eating here.."}
{"text":"Nacho lunch special... need I say more? 
Ok,  so they have lots more items on the menu,  but,  that sounded fantastic and it was. 
Got mine with shredded beef, it came with the typical toppings: beans,  jalapeños,  green onions,  tomatoes,  sour cream and guacamole,  and tons of cheese... and couldn't finish it. 
Definitely coming back to try something else."}
{"text":"This place was packed when walked in, and now I know why! The food was delicious and the service was great as well. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time on a Friday night. Got right in (around 5pm) and the place was pretty full. Service was good but not overly friendly. They get you in and out quickly which isn't a bad thing. The red and green burritos were great, as well as the shredded beef tacos and cheese crisp. We will come back to try their other menu items. Prices are comparable with other Mexican food restaurants."}
{"text":"Good brunch time . served fast . good margaritas. never had anything I havent really liked"}
{"text":"I love this place, been coming for years. Good food, great staff, good variety. You can't go wrong."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Mexican Restaurant in Arizona. The service is always wonderful and the food is always perfect."}
{"text":"Really good chips and salsa. Reasonable prices, small and quaint, good servers, owners are personable and asks how everything was, order is always correct. Best food is the poco pollo.  Cheap STRONG margaritas. I love it."}
{"text":"Authentic, delicious, affordable and friendly mexican restaurant. Margaritas were pretty tasty, (though a little overpowered on the tequila). 

The best part as compared to some of the higher-rated restaurants is the kids menu that included grilled cheese and chicken strips, considering my daughters' picky pallets.

A nice family-oriented place with above-average, authentic options."}
{"text":"Fantastic Mexican food. The chips and salsa are awesome. The Poco Pollo style is amazing especially with the Pollo asada. The atmosphere is very fun and inviting."}
{"text":"Accommodated our group of 11 and kept coming back to ask if we needed anything. Very friendly servers"}
{"text":"My wife and I waited for a while to be seated despite several tables being open and cleaned. The regulars, who came in several minutes after us, are catered to by the staff (several parties were seated as we were but their tables had chips and salsa already waiting and they received their service at the same time we did). The food itself was good but lacked spice. I wasn't impressed but I wasn't unimpressed either. It is just an OK place to eat. Next time we'll drive a few more miles."}
{"text":"Don Rubens has to be one of my favorite Mexican food place that I have found here in phoenix. Not real Mexican food but Phoenix Mexican food. You all know what I'm talking about! One of the downsides to that though, is everyone feels the same way, so I always have to wait and they do not have a bar. I have to say its worth the wait. 

I usually stick to a few of the same things. One being their Beef Chimichanga Dinner with rice and beans. Perfectly fried tortilla, tender and well seasoned beef, salty beans, and decent Spanish rice. Another being their Pork Carnitas Dinner. Their house margaritas are also tasty. This is a great place for a date night or to bring the family. This will continue to be one of our number one go to restaurants."}
{"text":"For a hole-in-the-wall place, this place is pretty good. It's small inside, and we went on a Saturday evening, so it was pretty busy. We had to wait 20 minutes, but it was worth the wait. Our server was very nice, and our food came pretty fast. I had the carne Asada taco dinner, with 2 tacos,!rice and beans.

It was amazing! It tasted fresh and amazing. I also had their cheese quesadilla, also amazing. I recommend this place to anyone looking for a hole-in-the-wall Mexican food restaurant."}
{"text":"Chips were tasteless, pretty sure my enchiladas were made with Alfredo sauce. Nothing was fresh, just loaded with fat."}
{"text":"Great chips & salsa. Great respectful service. Food was great and my new favorite place. I plan to go back and bring family when they come in to visit!"}
{"text":"Had lunch on a early Saturday afternoon.
The salsa did not impress me. It3 tasted like onions. They were so overpowering I could not taste the other ingredients.
The chips were good. 
I had the Pollo Fundido. They have a different name but they also call it a Fundido in their description. It was good, but nothing special. It had lot of chicken but it was dry. The sauce was very good, but they skimped a little on it. Not good when the chicken is dry. 
I really liked the Spanish rice.

The servers were very attentive. They were training our server, so we had two. 
Drinks were kept filled without even asking (Nice!).
I felt the trainer was a little standoffish when my buddy ordered his taquitos and asked if he could have one beef and one chicken.
She was almost snotty when she told him that to be the same.
I cannot figure out the logic why they couldn't make one each. Does it throw off their inventory that much? Or maybe it confuses the cooks? Still wondering...
Then they put guacamole on them when he was very explicit about NO guac..and he was still nice about it when they put in another order without the guac. The servers were too (prolly because it was their mistake).

I was not impressed with my first visit. But I will give them another chance sometime in the future."}
{"text":"Seriously, my new favorite Mexican restaurant. So tasty. They can get very busy at peak hours. For me, their salsa is the best! I can make a meal out of chips and salsa with a Taco on the side. Their Pollo fundido Pizza is also very tasty. The service has always been friendly fast and no issues. This is where we choose to go for small or large family meals."}
{"text":"My wife loves Don Ruben's shrimp enchilladas.  They are, for her, the bench mark against which all other shrimp enchilladas are measured.  
I like them to but not to the same degree as she does.  I order all over the menu and have found the food to be very good but not better than some other mexican restaurants.
Service is good.  Place is clean and neat but small."}
{"text":"One of our favorite restaurants! We come here for some of our special occasions, including our third year celebrating Christmas eve lunch! The service is great and we will always recommend this restaurant to people we know."}
{"text":"Good little Mexican joint....good margaritas... Small place so sometimes there's a wait but not a very long one. Definitely a go to for enchiladas"}
{"text":"Best Mexican Restaurant in the valley!  Can't recommend only one dish only because every one I've tried is superb. And if it's not on the menu. they are happy to accommodate a special diet. (Vegan hubby loves their bean burrito minus cheese and with added lettuce, tomato, black olives, avocado, etc.). I guarantee you will love the great food, warm atmosphere, and remarkable service."}
{"text":"We used to really like this place and have taken at least two dozen people here, some of which are regular diners now. That was then..

My husband tried to use a coupon from Dine4az.com and the owner refused to take it, saying it was a fake coupon. First of all, Dine4az.com is a site that restaurants sign up to promote their restaurants. Not just anyone can create a fake coupon and post on that site. The owner completely embarrassed my husband in front of a very large group of friends tonight and made my husband pay for the cheese crisp on the coupon. I mean, what does a cheese crisp even cost them to make? As small business owners ourselves, we would have just given it to the customer rather than lose a frequent diner. 

We will never be back!"}
{"text":"We always try to find unique dining experiences when we travel, instead of the typical chains. This place was awesome! Great food--more diverse menu than the usual Mexican fare. I had salmon tacos and my husband, the carne asada dinner. They were a little overwhelmed -- a busy Sunday evening crowd and short staffed, but the service and experience was not compromised. Alex as hostess is a treasure. If we lived here, this would be a regular destination for sure."}
{"text":"Don Ruben's Mexican Restaurant. Great Mexican food located on the corner a circle K.The food is always good.the waiters are Mexican., y decor is Spanish. This restaurant is a good strong 4*. We usually get burritos,prior to ordering, they bring a bowel of chips y two sauces  one very hot, other one mild. Y big glasses of cold water. This place has very nice friendly people working there, The restaurant has a lot of people coming there.So if you come after 5 PM.you will most likely have to wait to be seated . It is worth it. Watch Out the plates are very hot y smell so yummy. Beer y sodas y fried ice cream is delicious too. Been going to Fon Rubens once or twice a week when I want. Good Mexican food , it's all good.Popular place y owner over sees y takes pride the food. It is about average $ per person about $18.00 average order. Depends on what you order.Kids special orders. Spanish music if music is turned on."}
{"text":"In town on vacation and found this on yelp. Food was amazing, service was great too! Prices were reasonable."}
{"text":"I don't like giving bad reviews but I cannot understand the high reviews others have given this place. I ordered the Poco Pollo lunch item. My husband had the taco salad. Server asked what kind of dressing my husband wanted on his taco salad (dressing???) so he said he'd prefer sour cream. We were charged $1.50 for two tablespoons of sour cream which should have been free since it was supposed to be in lieu of dressing.

Absolutely no flavor in anything, not the guacamole, not the salsa, not the meat..,nothing. My dish was covered in clearly cheddar cheese with cream cheese sandwiched between my tortilla and chicken. The refried beans were a tasteless paste and the rice was rice only in name.  I can forgive in-authenticity but I won't be back to eat food that tastes like nothing. 

The service was friendly and quick and the prices seemed okay. The restaurant itself is clean and tidy and looked nice. However, if you don't ever see Mexicans eating at a Mexican restaurant, you can assume it's not good Mexican food."}
{"text":"What a gem of a restaurant I came across on my business trip to Arizona.
The chips and salsa are great, and the chips are light, not too thick...
I tried the salmon with Cajun seasoning. Highly recommend it!!!"}
{"text":"This is by far our favorite Mexican restaurant in the valley. So much we just came here two days in a row. 

When you sit down they bring everyone a glass of water and chips and salsa for everyone which is a mild and a hot (which isn't very hot). The chips are thick with just the right amount of salt. I could eat them for days! The food is always piping hot and comes out really fast.

The service isn't always personable but it's always efficient. We've never had a bad meal or bad service. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Small dining area but they move folks in and out quickly. Food is super yummy and it's clean."}
{"text":"It's been hard to find a Mexican restaurant that everyone is happy with their order AND that serves Coke products (I have a very picky family). Tonight we found a place, and it's practically in walking distance! The food wasn't too greasy, bland, lard ridden, or measly. It was portioned well and presented nicely. It smelled clean and looked clean. The wait staff was busy but never totally forgot us. It was the perfect spot for us after driving around for twenty minutes."}
{"text":"Best cheese enchilada in the game. Amazing place. Deserves all it's praise and it's rating. Great jalapeno cream cheese. To die for beans and rice. Overall great food. I choose this over any Mexican chain."}
{"text":"Chicken enchilada was nothing short of delicious with two exclamation marks !! My husband ordered #16 and loved it as well even with it being harder to eat. Our server was friendly and courteous and the prices were great"}
{"text":"Yummy!!!! We love this place. We love to be able to support a local business vs. a chain. It makes it so easy to when you always get wonderful service and good food. We've always had wonderful service and our food has always been made as ordered and good flavor."}
{"text":"Thank you so much to Steve and family for catering my daughters wedding.  It was great.  Food was awesome.  Thanks for making it so easy for us.  The Pinkerton family."}
{"text":"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this place. I have yet to eat in the restaurant, but I have ordered to go multiple time and it is AMAZING! The rice and refried bean taste very authentic. The cheese dip is awesome as well as their steak tacos. The green chile burrito is just so so... This is a little hole in the wall, but damnit, its good!"}
{"text":"This is the best Mexican restaurant EVER! Too bad they took the filet mignon off the menu"}
{"text":"We use to come to this place at least once a week and it was our favorite place for Mexican food! Over the last six months this place has went downhill fast! The wait is absolutely ridiculous and they now only take reservations for parties of 5 or more. The service is just not what it use to be. Very very sad."}
{"text":"Amazing service and delicious Mexican food! I ordered the chicken fajitas and asked them to make it spicy. For the first time I actually found my food spicy! Being out of town, the owner brought us a complimentary  cheese/nacho (I can't remember the exact name) appetizer and it was heaven. Would highly recommend this place if you are in the Glendale area."}
{"text":"If you want great place for Mexican food then this is the place. Clean, friendly and amazing. The chimichanga plate and fish tacos are to die for and we always love their chips and salsa and the nachos as an appetizer is just so yummy and not to mention the sopapias wow simply delicious . Always a great place to eat they treat you like family.Thank you for such great service every time"}
{"text":"I'm not going to bore you with the trivial details of our dinner. Food, great. Service, great. Ambiance, exactly what your expect.

Go there. Tonight. And hurry, they close soon..."}
{"text":"Great margaritas, I will give them that. Two is about all you need to get yourself in trouble driving home, trust me.

Hot sauce is cool (if that makes sense) and the food is really good. The menu is basic Az Mexican food. Nothing exceptionally fun about it but if you are happy with the basics, this is your place.

The wait staff are awesome. These folks make you feel at home and are all about taking care of you."}
{"text":"Love their spinach enchiladas with the spinach sauce, and their chips and salsa are the best! I always take friends from out of town here,  and when they come back to visit each year, they insist we hit Don Ruben's for Margaritas and dinner."}
{"text":"A couple of friends suggested we go here one night.  I would have never found this place on my own, not exactly a part of town that I hang out in.  When we got there, there were lots of people standing around waiting for a table and while I was pretty hungry, I was starting to question my decision to try it.  The kids did a great job of entertaining themselves and the wait was only about 10 minutes with a group of 5.  The waiter was very impressive, working with us on kids meals and the request for extra rice for my daughter that can never get enough rice in her life.  They were great with the kids and everything flowed very well.  Food was very authentic and tasty.  I got the shrimp burrito, T got the bean burrito."}
{"text":"Stopped for lunch. Had the luncheon specials. Great food that reasonably priced. The wait staff was very attentive."}
{"text":"This is a gem! I trusted yelp on finding this place that I am sure we would have never found otherwise. Its in a not bust strip mall. We came right a little before 5 on a Friday night and there were already people waiting outside. Food was delicious and the service was friendly. It feels like it is family owned because everyone seems invested in making sure you are taken care of. I am surr we will be back many times!"}
{"text":"This place has the best and fastest service. They are on it! Every time we come here it is busy but it is worth the wait. The margaritas are no joke. They don't skimp on the tequila and it is not too sour-they are delicious. Everything I have ordered has been great!"}
{"text":"Best salsa in town, I try to stop by when I'm in the area to get some to-go. Always delicious and the owners are so sweet. We always come in as a very large party of about 15-20 and they are super accomodating. One of my all-time favorites."}
{"text":"This place is great. I only experienced take out but the food was great. A bit pricey but well worth it. Will definitely return to dine inside. Would recommend the tamales and carne a safe tacos."}
{"text":"Was not impressed at all. Not authentic mexican food. More like frozen and out of a can or jar. I had the Diablo burrito dinner. I would rate the chips and salsa 2 stars better if you mix it with the hot. I will not be going back."}
{"text":"Food was okay. Nothing special about it.  I've had better back home, but with limited Mexican food options here, I can see why people would rate it so high."}
{"text":"Im glad i found this place on yelp it was so delicious ..beans were great and i had the sonoran enchiladas awesome"}
{"text":"I got a carne asada taco and red beef tamale and it was great.  Awesome salsa as well."}
{"text":"Probably the best Mexican food around. The best cheese crisp I have ever had!  I typically always get a taco but have had the chimi  and it is great as well.  We have tried many others over the years and have never found a place as great as this one!"}
{"text":"For a seemly family-run business in a strip-mall, don't overlook this place.  We found this restaurant via \"What's Nearby\" while we we needed to kill time before checking into our Airbnb.  The description sounded good, so we headed towards Don Rubens.  I ordered the Blake Tacos (grilled and marinated steak).  Let's stop there for a moment.  Yowza!  Often times steak in tacos can be a bit tough and sometimes grisly.  This steak was perfectly cooked, tender, and full of flavor.  Top it off with melted pepper jack cheese and they were the most amazing tacos I've ever had.  The beans were even amazing!  Great flavor.  The staff was friendly and the food came out in a timely manner.  The house margarita was tasty and priced well.  My friend ordered the cheese enchilada and chicken taco.  She fell in love with how tender the chicken was and how amazing the cheese melted to bring all of the flavors together.  As an out-of-towner, I would return to this place whenever I'm in town just for those dang Blake Tacos!!  

Why the 4-stars then?  Although we were warned the plate was very hot, I didn't figure it to be the temperature of lava.  Holy heck!  My finger was sore for the next hour.  The plate was hot for a long time which made the food too hot to handle for a good 5-10 minutes after it was served.

Regardless, I would totally return without any reservations regarding the quality of the food or service at Don Rubens Mexican Food."}
{"text":"I really wish that we could rate something 4.5 stars.... 

Went back last night. Even better than before, because of a new discovery.

$3.75 MARGARITAS

No gimmicks, no shenanigans. Menu price. 

The service was STILL excellent. Our server had a fun, witty sense of humor. The food was awesome. If there IS a gripe, it's that the food is too hot when it comes out. SCORCHING, so be careful!

These cheese crisps are THE BEST in town. If I could figure out how to make these at home, I'd be breaking fat person records. Best I leave this one to the pro's.  

Since I'm continuing my quest to find something wrong with Don Ruben's, I tried something different on the menu, as did my gf. I did the Carne Asada tacos, she did the Spinach Enchiladas. Two plates full of AWESOME coming right up! 

The low rating befuddles us, and the recent accusations of \"imposter postings\", or \"shill postings\" throws us off, so we talk about what WOULD make Don Ruben's a 5. We can't think of anything. 

This is the best Mexican food in the Valley. There's a few others I'm obligated to try, (DAMMIT!) but that's a sacrifice I'm willing to make to get a fair comparison, and to bring an accurate review to my beloved Yelp."}
{"text":"Excellent service!! Had the taco, tostada, and enchilada.. Very good and hot. What stood out, was the fact they kept the taco and tostada on a different plate to keep it out of the enchilada sauce.  Most Resturants just throw them all on the same plate!  There was a beef chili at table also, very lean and also tasted very good. 
Will return!!!"}
{"text":"Austin was fantastic, the poco pollo pizza and pollo loco were delicious. We will be back! Oh the happy hour margs were tasty."}
{"text":"i was refered here by a friend and i must say my husband and i loved it the food was amazing and the service was great Mexican is my favorite food and  this has become my new favorite place  i will go many many times  and we are very very very picky"}
{"text":"Love the food. Gets better every time I go. Service is usually good. Long waits at peak hours but that goes with putting out great food like they do. Margaritas are best I ever had also! Have to keep myself from going more than once a week."}
{"text":"We love eating here as a family, the margaritas are the best, everyone needs to try the Blake tacos"}
{"text":"I've lived here for 30+ years and just recently tried this establishment. I have driven past here for years and even lived down the street and never made it in. 
WHAT A MISTAKE THAT WAS!!! I WISH I would have gone in here sooner! The food was amazing. I ordered the Poco Pollo. So good and the jalepeno cream sauce was perfect. Not too over powering to take away from the flavor of the food and not too wimpy to make me think it was sour cream. 

Will definitely be going back. This is my new favorite mexican restaurant!"}
{"text":"Food was awesome! Always looking for a good Mexican food restaurant. Aren't many on the North West side. This was awesome! 
Great service and fast, even on a Saturday night there was a five minute wait. I will definitely be back !"}
{"text":"Excellent Mexican food!  They give free chips and salsa right away - so if your epic hangry and can't wait this is a great place to go.  Very nice variety of options also and plenty is non spicy and non greasy options.  Authentic, delicious, and very affordable - you can't go wrong!!"}
{"text":"Good. Everything from the staff to the food was good. If this is near your home office or you are in the area go here.  
It appeared to be busy until I realized the place is just on the smaller size. I doubt I would drive from Chandler to eat here but it is americanized Mexican food done well."}
{"text":"We drove a bit out of our way to get this restaurant based on the reviews and it was totally worth it! The staff were amazingly friendly, the margaritas were deliciously fresh and and the food was probably some of the best Mexican I've had recently. The location is a little sketchy, but look past the first impression of the vacated strip mall to experience everything that is good about thîs place. We'll head there again before we leave Arizona, for sure."}
{"text":"Don Ruben's is an extremely good Mexican restaurant with friendly and very fast service. Even late on a Wednesday evening the place is jammed wall to wall. But this popularity hasn't made them complacent as the food is terrific - particularly the shrimp enchilada and the chile relleno. The beef fajitas were delicious but there could have been more actual beef. 

Overall the portions are good and prices fairly average. Not bad for very good food."}
{"text":"My cousin recommended this restaurant for some good Mexican food. It was 15 minutes away from our hotel, so after the softball games, we visited this location for dinner. 

It was around 7pm and there were large groups of people waiting outside. My husband put our name on the wait list and the hostess told us it would be 45 minutes. My hungry group of five was a bit disappointed about the wait and the teens were contemplating taco bell. At this point, there was no way we were eating anywhere else. The long wait time just meant the food was promising. :) 

Surprisingly, we were seated in 15 minutes! The restaurant looked BUSY, but the waiter was fast and kind. We sit down and there are 6 little cups of salsa. Right away, I love this. Not only was the salsa delicious, but they already knew to have several bowls!

It was a difficult choice to decide what to eat. Everything was reasonably priced and looked so good!!! But, I finally decided on the shrimp enchiladas. ($11.50) And I'm kind of disappointed I chose this. 

As soon as a bit into the enchiladas I knew I was going to be sad. I live in California, and I knew I was going to probably never eat these amazing enchiladas again. They were incredibly tasty! The creamy enchilada sauce tasted like they could be drenched in pasta noodles and still taste amazing. It is so flipping fantastic! It was a fusion of Italian and Mexican food and it made my mouth so happy! 

The other dishes looked just as yummy (Carne asada tacos, flautas, quesadillas) but I was too focused on the shrimp enchiladas!!!

Good bye Don Ruben's...you will definitely be missed."}
{"text":"One of the best Mexican restaurants in the Valley - period! The food was delicious and the service was exceptional! Must try."}
{"text":"We were so excited to try this place because of the great reviews, but I have to agree with a previous reviewer who said it was super Americanized Mexican. If you like Garcia's and the like, this place is for you. If you want more authentic Mexican, Don Ruben's is a disappointment. The refried beans were decent, but our shredded beef hard tacos had a hint of fish taste (likely shared the frier with a future fish taco). The Poco Pollo sounded awesome but was super dry and really needed a sauce of some sort.  Our server was attentive and fast (he brought some beans out for our toddler right away), and he was juggling a few large tops. His service was our 3 stars, otherwise, we'd give it two for the food."}
{"text":"Pretty good, but I can think of other Mexican places I prefer. The service here was ATTENTIVE but a bit disorganized. I asked 3 different people to bring water for hubby and I (we were the last in our group to arrive) and we wound up with one water glass. However, they were quick to bring refills of chips and salsa, and checked on us frequently throughout the meal. The water glasses may have been a fluke because it was a pretty crowded table and we didn't have any other issues with the service.
The food was decent, if a bit spicy for my taste. Yeah, I know it is Mexican and I'm a wimp. No one else seemed to mind, so take that with a grain of salt. It did seem to sit a bit lighter than most Mexican food, so that was good. The margaritas were STRONG and a pitcher was more than enough for the 4 of us."}
{"text":"My sister and I stopped for lunch yesterday after we got pedicures (try LK Hand and Foot Spa!). 

Both of us are fans of Mexican food, and this spot was right around the corner from, her house.  When we arrived, at about 1pm, there was only a single table available, but we were seated immediately, and our server was quite pleasant.  We decided to split a couple of appetizers and opted for a cheese crisp with green chile and a platter of other sides.  The 
platter was good, but the star for me was the crisp.  It was perfectly crisp, flaky and delicious. 

Their service was quick and pleasant, their prices quite reasonable, and the atmosphere comfortable. I will come back next time I am in town!

PS They only have a single stall in their bathroom, so plan accordingly. :)"}
{"text":"Great place, great food, and great staff.
 
Usually a wait to get a table especially on friday and saturday nights, but well worth waiting for!

Love the Poco Pollo plate!! Next time i will ask them to put the jalapeño cream cheese inside the burro instead of on top!"}
{"text":"Amazing service, and great food. Will return over and over again! 

We brought our family on a Wednesday evening (14, 13 & 11). Chips and salsa kept flowing, and our food was at the table before we could finish a bowl. Our servers name was Austin, he did a fantastic job. 

We will be back! Thank you!"}
{"text":"We love good Mexican food and this place never disappoints. My husband always gets their beef enchiladas and I usually switch between the Taco salad and the pork carnitas. Everything is always piping hot and perfectly seasoned and delicious. The staff is friendly and attentive. They are always busy, but we've never had to wait for a booth. This is definitely our new favorite Mexican place and I can't wait for our next fix."}
{"text":"The best spot for authentic food. Amazing service and food quality every time I'm here!"}
{"text":"Great food and the people are great. We go here every week without  fail. All the favorite Mexican food."}
{"text":"This place was ducking delicious. I would highly recommend the steak picado, the El Gordo, and the poco pollo. The server was very attentive and muy chingon."}
{"text":"This the best Sonoran mexican food in the city. My wife had me try the flan (I do not like flan) and it was really good. Super smooth. Fajitas are excellent as well."}
{"text":"This is one of those places friends have recommended for years.  I go to the gym on this corner, I eat breakfast next door, but I am just not in that area of town when I go out to lunch or dinner.  Recently I met up for lunch with a friend who works out of his house just up the street.  Thursday lunch was packed shortly after opening.  The whole time we were there there was no more than 2 or 3 open tables.  Service was attentive.  Chips and salsa came out quick, as did the food order.  I preferred the hotter of the two salsas.  I had a chicken taco and cheese enchilada with rice and beans. It was one of their lunch specials and pretty reasonably priced.  There were some more exciting things on the menu but what I had was well executed.  It may not be a full 4 but it is worthy of more than a 3-1/2 rounded down.  I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Food is great, prices are great, margaritas are tasty and staff is friendly. What more could you ask for."}
{"text":"Their green chile burritos are great! Enough for my husband and I to share too. Really love the chips and salsa! Better than many other places!"}
{"text":"My family and I LOVE this restaurant! The food is always delicious and the service is great every time, no matter how busy they are. My brother has a gluten allergy and gets sick if he eats even a little bit of something that has gluten. Every time we ask if something has gluten in it, the server ALWAYS verifies with the cook or the manager.   Overall great food and staff!"}
{"text":"We ordered the spinach enchiladas, soft chicken tacos, tostada and guacamole. Everything was good. I'd go back again. The guacamole was the best!"}
{"text":"Fabulous food and service!
Everything we got was great and I would highly recommend this place.
It is a very busy place, and you can expect to wait for a table.
But it is well worth the wait.
The service is unbelievable-we had our supply of chips, salsa, and soft drinks replenished multiple times.
The best part was we never had to ask for refills of anything, yet we never ran out of anything.
I have been to Mexican restaurants hundreds of times(honestly at least a thousand), and would say this is the best service I ever had anywhere.
The quality of the food we got matched the service.
Try it- we thought it was A++++++"}
{"text":"The wait for the restaurant (when there is one) is most definitely worth it. Employees are always friendly, the chips and salsa are quickly served and delicious, and the service itself is speedy. The menu offers a variety of authentic Mexican food, but I will note that the less pricy options don't have the same quality. I once ordered a bean burrito (literally--nothing but beans in the burrito) and a side of rice and paid close to eight dollars for it. The burrito had little to no flavor; I was thoroughly grateful the salsa compensated for it. Vegan options are practically nonexistent but the other food I ate there before becoming a vegan was indeed worth the price."}
{"text":"We waited about 20 min to get a seat but it was worth it. Service was a little slow as they have 2 servers for the entire restaurant but food was great! I got the chicken tacos, rice and beans and everything was amazing!"}
{"text":"Very good food
Service was fast, although we were there on a Tuesday night and they were not busy. The waiter was very helpful and answered all my questions.  I was not impressed with either the hot sauce or salsa but our dinners were tasty. The Margaritas tasted wonderful!"}
{"text":"Where do I even start with this place?! 

We happened to stroll into this place on a Sunday night, and were shocked that there was a wait. Must be incredible food then, right? Right! We were NOT disappointed and have since been back 2 more times. 

The food is hands down the best Mexican food I've ever had. I live in the East Valley and drove 45+ minutes just to get Don Reubens! I appreciate that the food always comes out piping hot and full of flavor. Their prices are reasonable, and you get massive portions. 

Clean place, awesome atmosphere, friendly staff, and quick service..can't really ask for much more!"}
{"text":"Competitive price, amazing service and a good burrito. An another note, the consistency of meat quality/freshness is fifty-fifty; although to an extent to which it must be a different prep person. When it is good it is the most tender asada ever, when not its a bit close to ground beef but still has great flavor. All in all good locally priced Mexican. And appreciate you guys not being to \"safe\" on the house salsa I love the heat."}
{"text":"I've been coming here regularly for 7 years, with the exception of a short stint living out of state. It's nothing fancy, just standard Mexican food, but boy is it delicious! Go for lunch and try the nachos- they're the best I've ever had, and it's a big enough portion to share. You can get lunch for two for about $15. In fact, I'm heading there now to meet some friends. Yum!"}
{"text":"This restaurant appears to be newly opened in Mariposa. The menu is small, with standard Mexican food choices. Preparation is basic but reasonably competent. For now there is no alcohol available (license pending)."}
{"text":"Been here twice and overall this place is good and is always busy. Not the best Mexican I've ever had in my life but it is still pretty darn good. Their margaritas are on par here. Most of their dishes I liked, especially their enchiladas. My husband liked their fajitas and carne asada chimichungas. Not a huge fan of their tacos however."}
{"text":"My husband & I met my Aunt & Uncle there for our first time, and we loved the food.  My husband had the fish tacos and gave me a bite, delicious.  I had the machaca beef chimichanga, yum!  I loved it so much we are going there again tonight 1/27/14.  

My parent's came to visit and we recommended Don Ruben's too, and they absolutely loved it.  I use to be a Tee Pee's fan but I have to say Don Ruben's does make a better chimi."}
{"text":"Not bad by any stretch but it didn't rock my world either.

I would normally give this place only 3 stars but I was wowed by our waiter when the pitcher of margaritas I ordered for the table came to us as a full pitcher in addition to every glass being full as well. Most places just don't do that and it was a very nice gesture to make up for the extra few minutes we had to wait for them to make it. 

I don't know if this kind of behavior can be expected per se, but I am definitely grateful for that added touch and they found a way to differentiate themselves from the hundreds of other Mexican food places in phoenix...for me anyway.

They deserve an honest shot in my opinion. Don't know if I will rush back, but I am glad I tried them."}
{"text":"I was born and raised in Phoenix and I have been going to Don Rubens for quite a few years ....it is definitely my very favorite!!!!  From the superb service, atmosphere, best ever chips, drinks and have never had one bad thing on the menu!  GREAT JOB STEVE AND EMPLOYEES!!!!!"}
{"text":"Moved to this area in August 2017 but had been visiting the area for years prior. My friend took me here and I was immediately impressed with the food, drinks, and service. Margaritas are great. the Carnitas dinner is the best, especially accompanied by the Ranchero Beans in place of the refried beans. And they will switch those beans with other orders if you ask, I've done it many times.. The green chili con carne is outstanding and rice included has always been so good.  Since I've moved here I have taken others here also and they are always impressed. I just wish it was bigger, usually have a little bit of a wait, but it's worth it. And they truly care if you are having a pleasant experience. Oh, and tamales available to order by the dozen for your special occasion, they are the bomb!"}
{"text":"Always good here. The best thing I like is the house margarita comes out fast even if they're busy, they get you a good delicious house margarita that's not too sweet, but it's good and fast, which is critical after a long workday . My other favorite thing is the chili relleno, it has the best sauce, amazing flavor and heat, it is really really good. All the other items are super, I've never had a bad dish.  BRAVO Don Rubens."}
{"text":"Warm friendly and busy restaurant.  Friends took me and we had the Cadillac margarita $7.50 albeit delicious. She usually gets the shrimp cocktail which looked delicious. Will try next time, I just had the shredded beef chimichanga which was good."}
{"text":"The best margarita's in town!  We have been bringing our family here for at least 8 years.  The staff know us when we walk-in.  The owners and staff are fantastic! My favorite dish is the Blake Tacos!  Yummy!"}
{"text":"i go her almost every weekend because everything is so good. Also don't even get me started on the chips & salsa because it's all so good. The staff is super nice & i won't go anywhere else."}
{"text":"I love this place. The people are amazing, the food is wonderful, the prices are good. Everyone here has a smile on their faces and always makes sure we have chips and drinks."}
{"text":"Food absolutely deserves a 4 start rating but I was short a taco in my combo when I got home. My wife and I stopped in here on the way back to our hotel from Yosemite. We walked in and placed an order to go and they had us out the door in less than 10 minutes! My tacos were great as was my wife's quesadilla and I would definitely eat here again"}
{"text":"Been going to Don Rubens since it opened. It is the best Mexican food on the West side. Absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"Another night at Don Ruben's food outstanding as usual however the wait was extremely long because the lady at the front forgot where our name was and called five couples that came in after us and we were standing outside in the rain. not rain we were actually in the rain because we were underneath the awning however the point is is not really a service this trip"}
{"text":"ALERT PHOENIX NATIVES this is Mexican American food very much like the old Teepee and the old Macayo's. Absolutely perfect chips with incredible hot sauce and salsa. Everything comes out on super hot plates, everything is good to excellent. Service is impeccable, the entire operation runs very smoothly. The only bad thing, no bar to sit at. They could easily open other locations. This is not Los Dos Molinos hot mexican food, but good old Sonoran mexican that has mostly disappeared from Phoenix. Sure, there is Valle Luna, but this place is much better. Go early, place is packed. Bonus, the food is priced very fairly, but this is why you will go back, VALUE."}
{"text":"We love this place! We only found it within the past year but it has been in the Valley since 1972. Wish we would have found it sooner. It is a traditional style of Mexican food restaurant (American style of course), so we go there when we want that. The servers are always very nice, and the food is always hot. We like the chips and salsa, and the house margaritas are great - certainly not weak, either!"}
{"text":"The food was not that great.
The cheese crisp tasted funny, not sure what was going on with it. Seriously how can you mess up a cheese crisp? It's just a tortilla and cheese.

The green chile burro was horrific in my opinion. The flavor was awful and it was too runny.

The rice was bland. The beans were not too bad. 

The plate sat in a oven or in a salamander way to long making the plate EXTREMELY hot and burning the food. 

I probably ate 1/4 to a 1/3 of the food before I couldn't eat anymore.

The silverware was pathetic, I've used plastic silverware that was more stout. With the business charging as much as they do for their food, one would think that something like silverware wouldn't be cheeped out on.

Honestly with how high the prices are and my first experience, I will not be returning for a second chance unless it was paid for by the restaurant.
Sincerely,
Bill."}
{"text":"I was taken back by the crowd but our wait time for a table was fairly quick!   Not a restaurant with incredible ambience but still comfortable and clean. The staff had very personable interactions with the patrons which really added to the experience. Food was very good. Loved the guacamole appetizer with flour chips!  The house margaritas will not disappoint! I think we found our new favorite!  Thank you, Don Rubens!"}
{"text":"Some friends raved about this place, so I was excited to try it.  What I found was that is what they would call in Houston true Tex-Mex meaning Mexican made for American tastes and totally bland.
The place was packed, but, for the life of me, I have no idea why--except that the White people think this is real Mexican food.  Go figure?  A clue would have been not one Mexican/Hispanic in the place for lunch.
I ordered the fajitas for $15.  Tons of beans which were good, tons of rice which was same as every Mexican restaurant uses and really very little fajitas.  BIG disappointment.
The chips they serve with salsa at every table are good, tho, with the chips being thin and non-greasy which was wonderful.
But the fajitas...no bueno.  Are they saving the meat for the dinner service?  Who knows, but I know I walked out feeling royally taken.  For $15 you should get a heaping pile of fajitas and not just a small amount of meat.  Very disappointing, and I have no desire to ever go back here now."}
{"text":"This restaurant is crowded at lunch. There was a short wait, but it was worth it. The Mexican food is very good with a Southwest taste. It's not Mexico-Mexican. I was so glad to see green chile in many items. In California, most places think peppers or tomatillo is green chile, but it's so not!  I had green chile enchiladas with chicken - very delicious. Not overly spicy, so the flavor was emphasized. They do have spicier dishes. My husband had their taco salad and said it was the best one he ever had. The service was amazing, considering the place was full. Our lunch came out quickly and was fantastic.  I wish I could take them home with me!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Best dam whole beans ever!!! Just like home.
There Sonoran Enchiladas are as authentic as you can get. And my all time favorite is the Steak Picado. Great staff as well. Did I mention that \"I love this place\""}
{"text":"We had dined at Don Ruben's on several occasions, impressed with the quality of food we decided to use them to cater our business event.  

We were impressed with the dedication to customer service the staff provided to us. The food is amazing! everyone at the event was thrilled with the food and have inquired about  utilizing them as well. 

Don Ruben's is a family owned business and an an asset to the community. 

Thank you to the owners and staff for helping make our event a success!!"}
{"text":"This is great Mexican restaurant. Everyone has their own tastes it seems when it comes to Mexican food. This is my idea of real Mexican food.
I came at opening time for lunch on a weekday. There were people waiting in there cars for the doors to open. That's a good sign.
I was seated by a friendly employee. I ordered a combo plate with a cheese enchilada, chile relleno, beef taco with rice and beans. Without going into detail, all of it was delicious and fresh. Their chips and salsa are excellent. The chips are very thin and just perfect. The service wasn't very fast but was worth the wait and very friendly. I was checked on multiple times throughout my meal. I was slightly bothered by the 100 pound service dog on the floor at the table next to me during my meal but I won't let that take away from a near perfect lunch.
I'll be back."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been coming here for a couple years now. They have great chips and salsa, delicious food and always friendly service. I definitely recommend the Blake tacos, my absolute favorite dish. Great albondigas as well!"}
{"text":"Was actually pretty disappointed in this food !! It was  just ok nothing great nothing that I would go back too that's for sure !!! As I call it white people Mexican food"}
{"text":"Fantastic experience here, the food, the service and most of all the margarita! The food is pretty authentic and we enjoyed every bite. We had the chicken tacos, green corn tamales and carne asada tacos... all fantastic. Who ever made the margarita was very generous so no complaints there. The only thing we didn't care god was desert (fried icecream) it was bland 
 and generic. 

Great job will be back!!"}
{"text":"Great people! if you looking for a great taste, nice selection and affordable, look no further. Good menu, clean atmosphere, friendly staff."}
{"text":"Amazing food and great  service.  This was our first time here and we will be back.  Yum! !!"}
{"text":"Great service. Expect a wait though because this place gets busy! I was kind of concerned by the abundance of gringos eating here but the authenticity of the dishes was not to be second guessed!! I got the Cadillac margarita,pollo poco mexican pizza and a bowl of green chili con carne.  As a bartender the margarita passed the flavor and bang for your buck test. The pizza kinda crumbled under the pressure of my man hands but with the technological advantage of a fork it was a different story. Very delicious! And the chili con carne (green) was my favorite part! Very flavorful and meaty! Chips and salsa are above or under par(good)?! Overall, I'll be back to sample the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"The food is okay but the service is horrible. They won't even accept their own coupons and claim that companies put out fake coupons. This was from the owner himself. Lying to my face. Dine4AZ isn't a fake coupon site. But that's what he said when he decided he didn't want to take the coupon. Seriously?? And the coupon? For a free cheese crisp with purchase of an entree. Oh yea - and we had a party of 30 PEOPLE. Won't ever go back being treated like that."}
{"text":"This place was quite good. I'm not an export on Mexican food, but seemed authentic enough and was quite good. Place was packed with line, which to me is a good sign."}
{"text":"I love this place! The tortilla soup is one of my favorites and very filling. I also love the green corn tamales, so moist and flavorful, there isn't anything on the menu that isn't delicious . 
When you walk in the staff promptly greets you and seat you right away."}
{"text":"The food is beyond amazing and the service is great too. Constant refills and genuinely nice. My boyfriend and I come here all the time. One of my favorites. Spinach enchiladas are to die for. It's also nice that Don's isn't a chain restaurant so you know you're getting perfectly hand crafted, authentic Mexican food."}
{"text":"My mother, aunt and I went to this restaurant a few days ago and while we were waiting for our food, we found a long, curly hair in the salsa that we were snacking on. Very disgusting."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious!  Have gone here for years, is our favorite Mexican food restaurant. 
Tried something new, Fiesta Shrimp Salad.  Oh my, so good."}
{"text":"Our favorite place to go for a great Mexican food! You can have lunch or a birthday celebration & the staff always gives you the best service with a smile! Love our Don Rubens!!!"}
{"text":"Have lived nearby for 8 months and driven by daily without stopping in. Reached out to business on Facebook to ask about vegan options. They do not use lard but their rice contains chicken stock. We still checked it out and loved it. Everyone super friendly, service was fast, and restaurant was clean. We will be returning in the future....many times."}
{"text":"I had the 2 shredded beef taco with rice and beans combo, added on a shredded beef enchilada and they were delicious! The chips and salsa were outstanding, as well!"}
{"text":"Simply delicious. From the drinks to the cheese crisp to the Blake's tacos. Everything was very tasty and served quickly. Small place, but so much better than the chain Mexican food places. We will definately be back!"}
{"text":"The best Mexican food in Phoenix. I've been a loyal customer for many years and have never been disappointed. The staff is friendly and polite. The owner Steve is a great guy. I've tried nearly ever item on the menu. Everything is outstanding! I highly recommend Don Rubens."}
{"text":"Really good solid Mexican food. The place is small - so go early.  It is in a little strip mall so the food was unexpectedly good for the weird location.  And there were a lot of people there so must be a local hang out.  I am definitely going again if I'm in the part of town."}
{"text":"We ate lunch at DR on Saturday afternoon,
and it was packed, so we knew it had to be good. First time there, It was welcoming pleasant atmosphere, good service and most importantly some of the best Mexican food we've had since moving to Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Don Ruben's is the first acceptable Mexican food restaurant we found since locating to the Valley. Particularly good is the Green chili burrito served red enchilada style. Great Margareta's and Green chili tostadas. 

I have a difficult time understanding the poor service, unorganized, unfriendly reviews I've read; our findings were totally the opposite. Always friendly and great service.

I suggest/recommend you give it a try and write your own review."}
{"text":"We actually ended up here because the restaurant next door had a 30 minute wait and I'm a generally impatient person. It was a Sunday at 11am and they were able to seat our party of 9 immediately. It's a very clean restaurant with friendly and attentive staff. Each of us had something different and we were all very happy with our meals- which came out surprisingly fast. The chips and salsa were top notch. My 9 year old son said that the grilled cheese was the best he's ever had and he wanted to come back again. High praise from that kid.  

Definitely now one of my favorite places for Mexican food."}
{"text":"Aw I am sad to see so many negative reviews. We love this place. It has good food and we have always had good service. We have lived in this area about 4 years now and it's a nice place close to home. I do recommend this to my friends too."}
{"text":"I had the carne asada taco dinner. It came with Mexican rice, bean soup & two tacos. The tacos were okay. Steak meat was a bit over cooked leading it to be very chewy. I don't think this is the cheese that's typically put on tacos. The cheese is usually white, not yellow. This made it more Americanized imo. I asked for a spicier sauce to go with it and was surprised the green sauce was the spiciest because it wasn't spicy at all. They offered tobasco, but that doesn't go well with tacos; to me at least. The rice was very soft and went well with the entree. The bean soup was pretty good. I feel like there's way too many Mexican restaurants in the area for them to be priced so high."}
{"text":"I totally disagree with the one star review. Thats insane.  I'm a foodie and love a good mexican restaurant. I just moved here from Chicago and Don Ruben is a few blocks from me. I thought it was a hole in the wall dive, but I was wrong.
It's clean and nicely decorated, with two rooms for patrons. The salsa is delicious, just the right amount of tomato, onion, spice and kick! I'm not a fan of the their hotter version, so I'd skip that. The chips are always fresh and hot. Great margaritas and even better at 3 bucks on weekends. I always get the shredded beef enchiladas with ranch beans. I've had this in numerous places and theirs is THE best. The sauce on the enchiladas is delicious. It's a full plate and enough for leftovers the next day. The deserts are amazing too. The wait staff is always friendly and quick!
I love having this close to home, but there goes the diet!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Excellent margaritas. Excellent service. We come here on a weekly basis!"}
{"text":"Visiting Phoenix/Glendale as Mexican food fans and knew we had to find a good place to eat.  Yelp! led us to Don Ruben's.  We looked at the menu before heading to the restaurant and, really, it looked pretty much like any other standard, strip mall Mexican joint be it in Glendale or in my home state of Georgia.  Decided to give it a shot anyway.

The menu may be familiar but the food, ohhhh, the food.  Incredible.  The salsa, hot sauce, chips, entrees, margaritas...just an exceptional meal at a very reasonable price.  I went with the beef burro and it was unlike anything I've eaten at a Mexican place in the past.  I'm salivating now just remembering how good it was.  Those dining with me raved about their meals, as well.

Cannot recommend this place enough.  Locals are very fortunate to have this place in town and, for visitors, THIS is where you need to go.  Don't let the menu fool you."}
{"text":"There's hundreds of places around like this I particularly thought all of the food was just okay not bad, not great flavor. The service is good and I have seen the manager lady around. I didn't like the rice and asked the manage if it could be taken off the tab she said yes. You might like this place. I've been to many different Mexican joints by far this is  in the middle of the spectrum"}
{"text":"Wow!!! Super busy but worth the wait.  Food was amazing.  The staff was fast and friendly and gave great recommendations.  I can't wait until we go back again.  Food came out quick too!!"}
{"text":"Let's start at the wait. We were told 20 minutes and waited 55 minutes. Ok no problem it was really busy and lots of big parties. We ordered a cheese crisp and it was ok. Nothing spectacular. Anyway the fish Taco dinner is what I ordered and it was terrible. Fish was greasy, dark, and burned. Tasted bad like it was fried in old oil . Absolutely inedible.  Service was polite but super slow. Talked to the manager and she was polite but told me the chef said my food was fine. Really? The chef needs to rethink that for sure. It was a bad first experience and a last one for me."}
{"text":"This is our 2nd visit - good stuff! The food is yummy, my Margarita was tasty too. We're happy to have found this place because the Mexican food we've had since moving here 2 years ago has not met my expectations. Possibly my mom's authentic Mexican food spoiled me...idk ..but Don Ruben's is now part of the date night rotation! Their customer service is top notch too - what more can you ask for?! Comida deliciosa :)"}
{"text":"Not bad for what it is. Fajitas are skimpy, but from what I could see on other plates the portions on other menu items was quite generous. The chips and salsa were standard, the service was standard and the food smelled good, but my date and I were both underwhelmed with the cost vs quality. This is AZ after-all, expectations for Mexican food is high. If I'm going to go home wishing I had ordered chicken super nachos from Filberto's after leaving a restaurant. I'm not giving a strong review, and I won't be a repeat customer."}
{"text":"Great food. Only thing better was the service. Very friendly staff. Family friendly. Highly recommend. 
We took our son 20mo...he had a crying fit and the staff cheered him up."}
{"text":"If I could give them 10 stars I would.  I love the food here.  I have not been disappointed with anything I have tried.  The service is quick and great too!  You may have a small wait at dinner time but trust me it's well worth it!"}
{"text":"We order here to go the night before Easter. Good thing because when we arrived there were at least 5 groups waiting outside to be seated. The food was so delicious. We got the Mexican pizza, chicken quesadilla, and the taco salad. The shell on the taco salad was so perfect, I could've just ate 10 of them. The cilantro ranch dressing was ok, wish there was a little more flavor. The other people seemed to also like their food. It all seemed fresh and the portions were generations while it was very inexpensive. It is also located in a strip mall with a lot of cut through traffic so be careful around the restaurant."}
{"text":"JUST MEH.....this resultant has good reviews but I am very underwhelmed!!! This was my second visit my daughter and her friends go all the time but I was not impressed. This cost I simply asked for a cheese crisp with guacamole, and a cup of soup. The Skype was good and hot but the cheese crisp COLD and 7.95 !! When the waiter came and asked how everything was I told him the crisp was cold, he said, \"yeah well they put cold guacamole on top which makes the cheese crisp cold\" I said well then I would want the guacamole on the side, he said \"well, you didn't ask for it that way,\" REALLY!!?? Well I asked can you heat it up? He took it back to the kitchen (what was left) and heated it up, it came back and still wasn't hot! NO TIP TONIGHT!!! I do believe that taking food from a table back to the kitchen and then reserving it is against the health code! I am willing to give second chances as none of us are perfect but this waiter has been working there a long time!!!"}
{"text":"I was not wowed by this place but it's definitely not going to disappoint. Descent portions that tasted slightly different than the other Mexican food places but nothing to make you choose this place over a place like Valle Luna or even Garcia's"}
{"text":"This place was good food, fast service, and friendly staff. I was disappointed with the drinks as they were really small and not very good. The food was fresh and salsa and chips were great! I would probably go there again if in the area. Just minus the alcoholic beverages."}
{"text":"The hostesses were very friendly and the service was great! Excellent salsa and chips! Taco salad was so delicious perfect amount of everything in it! Chicken wasn't chewy...it was shredded in small pieces! The only reason I gave them 3 stars was because of the walls... the booth we were sitting at the wall was dirty with food splattered on it or something very disgusting... but other than that.... this place is a must go to!"}
{"text":"What an excellent find. Service was great and the food was, probably the best mexican food i have ever had. Not sure what i ate but it was very good. Polo carna asada  something."}
{"text":"Good food and super nice people.  My family loves going here and eating.  The owner always comes and says hello and the service is great.  Clean, casual and delicious food."}
{"text":"Excellent Cadillac . My son had Shrimp Chille relleno . Loved it . Lotsa veg options . Friendly service . No wait . Clean atmosphere. Lovely place . Real Mexican food 2 kinds salsa nicee . Hot and mild . Loved the hot one .  One suggestion that we could make out own combo meal ... Instead of set combos . I wanted spinach enchilada and relleno combo , but could not . I would have been charged for each and beans and rice .. There was no plate option . Relleno by itself and if u want beans and rice extra for it . Approximately 10 $ for the plate . Pretty pricy for Glendale AZ ."}
{"text":"Thank you, Yelpers!

On the west side and wanted to try something other than \"the usual\" spots.

Mid-week arrived near 8 p.m. Only cars in the parking lot were all concentrated around Don Ruben's. Good sign, in my mind.

Greeted and seated right away. Drink orders taken right after chips and salsa served. Chips were light and crisp. \"Hot\" sauce wasn't hot, too bad. Salsa had good flavor.

Carne asada fajitas and carnitas was our order. Service was not rushed. Proteins for both were a bit overcooked. Spices were very flavorful. Portions were reasonable and pricing was very fair.

Churro bowl for dessert. Only $4.95. An OK value. Nothing special.

Will happily come back when in the area."}
{"text":"The place was packed for dinner rush tonight.  The staff and kitchen were awesome.  Food came out hot and fresh.  Server was all over it.  I liked my food but didn't love it.  Here in Colorado most of our dishes have some heat.  The salsa, jalapeño cream cheese (cool idea) and green chili wasn't spicy at all.  Don't get me wrong.  In The Phoenix metro area this has been the best Mexican food I have had so far."}
{"text":"My family and I are from San Diego and have been disappointed with the Mexican food in the Phoenix area until now! The staff is friendly the ambience is authentic and the food is amazing!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love Mexican food and this is our favorite place to get our fix. We eat here about once a week. The great food and service never disappoints. Our favorite is the #11 (cheese enchilada, hard shell taco, rice and beans). The enchilada sauce is perfect and the cheese is nice and creamy, not oily and rubbery like other places we have been to. They also have good cheeseburgers and chicken strips for our kids. Despite the negative reviews it always seems busy. It's about a half hour away from us but worth the drive."}
{"text":"We took a trip out to Arizona to visit my grandparents. They wanted to take me out for a belated birthday dinner and I chose Mexican food. They took us here and I was very pleased. The service was great- very friendly and quick. 

The food was amazing! I love Mexican food and wish this place was near home. We ordered a wide variety of dishes and loved them all.

I highly recommend this place if you are looking for a good Mexican restaurant in Sun City West."}
{"text":"We eat here all the time...best fajitas in town....margaritas are soooooo good!!!#  I love the green corn tamales. ..their SALSA is the best in town #!!!!!"}
{"text":"We went after reviewing a post in the Phoenix magazine.  We are very picky about our Mexican food.  The chips and salsa are great.  The crispy cheese crisp is to die for.  All of our entrees were terrific especially the Diablo burrito and chicken burrito with jalapeño cream cheese.  Service was good, a little slow at times, but the food was hot and very delicious. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I felt that I had to write a review after seeing that Don Ruben only has 3.5 stars. I mean, every time I eat here I'm pleased. 

I like that the atmosphere is cozy and visually interesting--definitely not a hole-in-the-way type place.

The service is always good. It may be better for us because Don Ruben is my parents' default \"date-night\" restaurant. Today, the server came by at least 3 times to check on us, in addition to taking our order, bringing the food, and closing the check.

 If you want to split a plate, they'll plate it that way in the kitchen and give you extra rice and beans for $1 extra. My mom and I did this, and still had carnitas left over. Some places make you feel bad about splitting a plate, but our server was totally gracious and offered the $1+ deal to us. After tax and tip, our total tab was under $20.

And of course, the food. I've never had the $3.75 margarita because my mom likes 1800. We didn't get it this time because it was noon on a Tuesday, but I've had it before with 1800 too, and its muy deliciosa. I'll admit the chips and salsa aren't the bestest ever, but they're still solid. We usually get the carnitas because they are BOMB. Slightly crisp, well-seasoned, keep picking at them after I'm full. I've had some of the other offerings, and recall being pleased. 

Everyone seems nuts about the blah American diner next door, but I'm all about Don Ruben."}
{"text":"You will have better food on taco night at your Mom's house, than at Don Ruben's.

People lauding this place as the best Mexican food in the Valley? Really? REALLY??!!! 

I had the Taco, rice and beans combo, my standard first plate at any Mexican food restaurant, which is my own personal test.  If said restaurant fails this test, I don't come back.  Guess what, Don Rubens failed pretty badly.  

The food is total generic Mexican food.  The chips were slightly stale.  So was the taco shell, which by the way, seemed like they went across the street to Fry's for their ingredients.   The shell must have been the Kroger brand because it was pretty nasty.  Same with the rice and beans.  I felt the food definitely did not justify the prices. 

The wait staff were not rude, but were definitely not welcoming or very attentive, and we seemed to wait a long while to both have our order taken, and have the food delivered.  

I do not recommend Don Ruben's"}
{"text":"How I love Don Ruben's, let me count the ways.... I discovered this little Mexican restaurant a few months ago and have visited them an obscene amount of times since then. If you want some fabulous Americanized Mexican food, look no further. DR's offers tasty meals covered in cheese for ridiculously low prices in comparison to other similar restaurants (I'm not talking cheap like Taco Mich or something.... I'm talking about Macayo's or Carlos O'Brien or Manuels which don't hold a candle to this place and are way more expensive). Here's the deal. 


1. Get the cheese crisp. Get the LARGE cheese crisp.... it's a dollar more and it is significantly bigger... you can take that puppy home and reheat it in the toaster oven to relive your Don Ruben's experience the next day (and I do). Their cheese crisp is so good....it's like they ouble fry it or something. The tortilla literally falls apart from being fried..... it is unlike other cheese crisps and, IMO, it's the best cheese crisp in town. 


2. Get anything poco pollo style. ANYTHING. Essentially, their poco pollo is a burrito fundido with the jalapeno cream cheese and the cheddar cheese melted on a fried thing. I usually order an a la cart green or red (red is better, both are legit) chili burro poco pollo style. It is large, delicious, provides me with leftovers that are close to as tasty as the first time, and did I mention delicious....yes. 

3. Don't bother with the rice..... their rice isn't that great. Also, their food probably has 1 trillion calories per serving, no need for extra carbs. You can save a lot of dollars by ordering a la cart items. 


That's about it. I have also tried their tacos, enchiladas, taquitos, etc.... everything is good, but not as special as the items outlined above. Also, know that you will most likely wait in line when you go. I have never gotten in without a wait, even on a school night. Happy eating friends!!!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit and it was great!! I had the shrimp enchiladas, they were delicious. Everything was great! The staff was very harm and attentive. It was a little drive from the west side but we will come again! Do good"}
{"text":"Do you love great Mexican food?   Do you love fast and friendly service?   If you answered yes to these questions then you owe it to yourself to go to the Don's.  I have been eating here for years.  Yes it's a little on the small side space wise and yes there might be a wait during peak times but heck fire if isn't worth it.  
I get the Poco Pollo with rice and beans- if chicken is not your thing this can be made with beef- thin fried burro with jalapeño cream cheese and regular cheese- it is to die for
Chips and salsa are also good- they will ask you if you want hot and mild -say yes and try both- as these are homemade some days they can be hotter or milder depending on who was working that day lol.  
TL;DR
It's good food you should go!"}
{"text":"Great AZ style Sonoran Mexican Food! After moving back to AZ from TX this was one of the first restaurants  I couldn't wait to go to."}
{"text":"This place is clean, has good service and great food. I like the lunch specials-tasty and a good value."}
{"text":"Got the Carne Asada Burro Poco style. Poco style includes deep frying and covering with cheese and a jalapeno cream cheese topping. Excellent flavor and portions for price! Loved the grilled onions inside the burrito with the Carne Asada! Rice and beans weren't anything out of the oridnary, but still tasty! Definitely feels like a family restaurant! Good ambience and not too much noise!"}
{"text":"We have been going here for five years and the food has been spectacular every time. great service and a cozy dining experience."}
{"text":"I've been there twice: once for a meeting and another time for lunch with my husband.

Their food is fantastic and their service is fast and friendly. Both times I've eaten there, everyone working there had a smile on their face and was very accommodating.

I absolutely LOVE that their rice and beans don't have any animal broth or lard. Even their tortilla chips are lard free! This is difficult to find in a mexican restaurant.

I love that they have vegan options too, like the bean chimichanga (as well as a few other vegan menu items that I can't quite recall at the moment).

The fact that Don Ruben's has some vegan options for me and then some meat-themed options for my husband means that we can enjoy a wonderful meal together! 

I can't speak for myself, but my husband says that the meat dishes he's eaten there are also wonderful. 

I recommend that you give Don Ruben's a try!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have just about eaten here weekly (if not more often) for several years. Always excellent food and good service. It all starts with chips and tasty fresh salsa. Mild, but mix it with the hot salsa available for a bit more punch. Cheese crisp with chilis is recommended as an appetizer. Margaritas are full-strength. What entree? I'm addicted to the pork carnitas plate- plenty of shredded pork with some nice texture \"bark\", with grilled onions and peppers, served with charro beans, rice and warm tortillas. I also like the Diablo burro, or for the lighter side, a carnitas burro or large bowl of Albondigas soup (especially on a cold winter night). My wife likes the chili rellenos, tortilla soup, or one of their combo plates. I tried the sonoran salmon last week which was good but the filet was on the small side, though it was healthy and served with delicious steamed vegetables and rice. Finally, for dessert, the flan is the perfect finale and the best I've had. The only disappointment in probably a couple hundred meals was a green chili burro which was more tortilla than filling....but hey, one off night does not detract from a well-earned stellar five star rating. Thanks Don Rubens - you rock!!!

Update: the green chile chimicanga (or occassionally a burro) is now a favorite. We've upped the frequency of our visits here so much that we joke they may be thinking they need an order of protection from us as stalkers! BTW, service is always stellar! Flan recipe has changed unfortunately, but generally so full that dessert is not a need or a want."}
{"text":"No better \"hole in the wall\" Mexican restaurant around- family owned - I've been coming here for a few years and it is Excelente ! Try the spinach enchiladas!!"}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant after reading rave reviews. I was very disappointed by the service and food flavor. I have been to many Mexican food restaurants in the valley. This is one place I will not return to. Hot sauce is more catsup than hot. Taco was very dry. Chimichanga was flat and low flavor. And it was the green Chile. 
Do yourself a favor and look for a different place for Mexican food."}
{"text":"The food was very tasty however it came to the table with steam rolling off of it. Now I love hot food don't get me wrong but this was so hot that after 10 minutes both of our plates were still rolling smoke. The guacamole is very tasty and the server was extremely friendly. I will go back however and would recommend anyone in the area to give it a try but next time no shredded chicken for me it holds the heat way to long."}
{"text":"Seriously how have I not left a review for Don rubens before?! We have been coming here for about 5 years and absolutely love it. Always clean! The food is fresh and always taste great. I can't understand why someone would leave a bad review. And the complaint on the bad review was stupid so stfu. The staff here is amazing. They are always welcoming, attentive and consistent. Our salsa and chips are never empty and the food comes out fast. Also, our drinks are always filled. And they have great tea! Being from new mexico I am super picky about my Mexican food and this is the only Mexican food I will eat in arizona. It's just so damn good. I am most fond of the Mexican shrimp burrito but have tried about a dozen other things and everything has been 100%. The gf always gets something different so she can try the whole menu so we have tried a lot of different things and are constantly impressed. I'd like to give DR 10 stars. Try it, you will Not be disappointed."}
{"text":"great local restaurant. was there on a business trip and decided to do a quick search for Mexican and this place showed up. glad we went. the margaritas were good and the food was tasty. fairly cheap too! we went for lunch and the service could have been a bit faster but they were pretty packed."}
{"text":"Manager Stacy has much reflection to do. Amazing food, will not let the rude response of the manager on duty today reflect on how wonderful the cooks are here. The ultimate complication is when you order take out and they don't give you any napkins or utensils to eat your food with does this make any sense to anybody??? When contacting the restaurant Stacy the manager became very abrupt and short answered when I inquired about why there was no utensils and napkins after I had asked her prior to leaving the restaurant all I got in return was I didn't hear you say you needed napkins and utensils, although that might have been factual her presentation was horrifying how do you treat a customer who pays $20 for one meal that way! The only resolution she had for me was for me to come back and pick up the utensils comma shame on the manager for not making the right choice ultimately I obviously cannot leave work again to go get utensils so therefore I must save my meal for when I get home this evening which means it will be cold and not fresh $20 down the drain thanks a lot Stacy ,very poor  customer service skills..."}
{"text":"After a 30 minute wait in which you can order drinks! The Margarita was delicious. We were seated and the service was very fast and fantastic. Our waiter was very attentive and our food was delivered quickly and was perfect. We ordered the Chicken Tortilla Soup and split the sampler plate. So good i would order both again. Prices was very reasonable and we will be returning very soon. Thank you for a wonderful experience!"}
{"text":"This place was very good. True and authentic mexican food. 
Enjoyed both salsa's and the great combo dishes.

Go here."}
{"text":"We LOVE Don Ruben's!!  We have been eating here for years.  I have been using Yelp for a couple of years as well.  Tonight as we were sitting at Don's, as we call it, I said \"they have the best chips and salsa\"  then I said I'm going to go home and write a positive review on Yelp for them.  I have had or tried just about everything on the menu.  I am a fourth generation AZ. native, been eating Mexican food in Phx. area for years,  There are other good places, but we like Don Ruben's the best.  My favorites are #3, #9, #11 combinations plates, and the fish taco dinner, not Mexico style, but very good.  We have had a couple of occasions when we had  so so service, but only like twice in all the years.  Too Hot????  What??  That is what Mexican food is, Ooey, Gooey, Hot & Cheesy Goodness .  Delish!!!"}
{"text":"This is me and my moms favorite Mexican restaurant. The food is at a fair price, always piping hot and fresh, and they know how to make a cocktail. The service is outstanding, and is partially the reason why I choose this place. 


***UPDATE 
5/8/17- Fajitas are BOMB!"}
{"text":"Love it! Don't let the little shopping plaza its hidden in fool you. Once you enter the door you'll immediately be welcomed into a lovely restaurant with a great atmosphere, friendly staff and wonderful food. Almost everyone at our table ordered the poco pollo. I substituted beef instead of chicken. Incredible. The group I was with have quite a few picky eaters, and no one had a complaint."}
{"text":"We LOVE Don Ruben's so it pains me to write this but the last three times we've been there the service has steadily declined. The portions seem to be shrinking as well. James is awesome and we love him but we haven't had him as our waiter in a while which could be part of the problem. Two of the times we've had Izzy who is very inattentive and tonight we had to wait more than 30 minutes for our food and the restaurant wasn't that busy. We drive 45 minutes to get there and enjoy our meal but it's making us question making the drive anymore. Sad."}
{"text":"We came here because of poor service at another Mexican place in town. Don's is at the edge of town.  They are working out a couple of kinks, but great food. Hanni, our server was excellent. Actually both servers teamed well.
Nice decor and air conditioning."}
{"text":"Great food! Great prices! Good service. 
Out of towners wanting a taste of Mexico. Was not disappointed. Generous portions."}
{"text":"This is our favorite restaurant! We celebrate everyone's birthday and family milestones at Don Rubens. The environment is warm and welcoming, the food is authentic and amazing, and they treat you and your kids like family. We love coming here because we know every time we will be served warm, yummy Mexican food and the service will be excellent!"}
