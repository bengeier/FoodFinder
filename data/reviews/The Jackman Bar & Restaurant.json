{"text":"Happy to write a good review of the Jackman because the bar has made big changes under the new management. First, the bar is now smoke free, though there is a nice deck out back for those who do. Second, the food is really good. Our family has tried several things off the menu (burgers, fried shrimp, Reuben's, wings ) and they've all been solid. Everything is tied together by a great staff in a neighborhood setting that's impossible to duplicate. If you're in the area and looking for some solid pub grub, give the Jackman a try."}
{"text":"I would say that it's safe to disregard most of the aspects of the reviews that are prior to 2016, which is when the bar changed ownership (from what I understand). This bar has quickly become one of my favorites and many of my friends agree.  With a fun diverse menu (for a bar) AND a smoke-free environment, it's hard not to like this casual and friendly neighborhood meet-up. The location is convenient and the charm is all there, especially since this house-turned-bar is nestled in among the quiet residential streets of Avalon.  The bartenders have quickly learned our name and are quite hospitable. The same goes for the chef, who is not only talented but seems caring about quality and pleasing the customer. Their fish sandwich deal is one of the best around - scrumptious, satisfying, and only $5 when on special. Drinks are cheap and sometimes the pool table in the back is free along with the jukebox.  Give this bar a try and you shouldn't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"You must try the wings! Tues and Thursday night is Wing Night.   A place you would consider a dive bar but it is fairly clean. It is a bar full of locals that still allows smoking. If you can handle cigarette smoke and coming home with a sexy grease/smoke cologne....you should stop in for the wings.   They only have a couple beers on tap (Bud Light, Budweiser, and Yuengling) so don't think you are getting any micros or imports. You will be lucky to get Heineken or Corona in a bottle!   This bar has the best wings in Pittsburgh though. They are the whole wings and deep fried to perfection. Hot Garlic Parm is the jackpot.   Most nights you will find DJ Vince playing almost any song you can think of!"}
{"text":"Great neighborhood bar that's laid back with great food! Good drink specials .. TVs and Juke box .. excellent service!"}
{"text":"I'd give this a 1/2 star above the Rusty Dory if it were possible, but it's not, and Jackman Inn has done little to deserve it.  Smoky to the point of suffocation, old men wearing too much cologne, and a DJ who seems to only play the bottom half Hot 100 Billboard hits are a sample of the highlights.  It's far enough out of the way that you're unlikely to see too many new faces from week to week.  For what it is--a neighborhood bar to get local yinzers drunk--I guess it works.  Best beer on tap is Yuengling."}
{"text":"No! No! No! No!!!  Your food sucks,  the red head bartender looks mad all the time! Whoever took this place over needs to get rid of her!! Maybe if you did I could tolerate drinking there. Do something better with your food please, or get a better cook."}
{"text":"This is a great neighborhood bar.  A couple nice TVs, specials for sporting events, and some pretty decent bar food (great wings).  The owners and bartenders are friendly and accommodating, and there's never any trouble there.  The Jackman has that kind of charm that a newer bar could only hope to replicate.  The clientele is very salt of the earth, real people.  I like it.   I knocked it down a star because taking the stairs going down to the men's room is like descending Mt. Kilamanjaro blindfolded, but hey, you can't have everything."}
{"text":"Nice little bar friendly people cold beer the food can be a hit or miss,  free pool i like it people smoke out back on the big porch."}
