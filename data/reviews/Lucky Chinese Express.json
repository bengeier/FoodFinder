{"text":"Few Chinese-American resturaunts get it wrong. These guys did.

I decided to get some Chinese food delivered to my house for lunch and couldn't find any place that would do it before 4:00 PM. However, this place would. Looking back, I wish I had ordered at 4:00 because I didn't get my food for at least 45 minutes to an hour.

I ordered some Orange Chicken, fried rice, and an egg roll. The egg roll was okay, it's really hard to make a deep-fried roll of lettuce taste bad. The real problem was the Orange Chicken and fried rice. The chicken was served as long \"strips\" that were dipped in some kind of hush puppy batter and was most likely baked. The orange sauce was bland and didn't taste very orange-y at all.

The fried rice came in a very small container and held the consistency of cookie dough. There was no evidence that the rice had really been fried and had no other ingredients in it other than rice and maybe some egg. My chopsticks remain upright when I stick them into the bowl. The consistency alone was enough to turn me off to this rice. It tasted somewhat okay, but not good enough to make up for its awful pasty demeanor.

From my experience, I would never order from this place again and would not suggest anyone else order from this place either.


What an extremely disappointing lunch...."}

{"text":"Hopefully my review can even out Lucky Chinese Express' initial poor rating. On the lookout for more delivery-friendly places to try, I came upon this capable Chinese restaurant and do not lament my decision. 

My only tangible complaint is that our food took over an hour to reach us, and we're only a few miles away. Immaterial of tardiness, our Chinese meal was still hot when it arrived via a genial, apologetic courier who simply became lost en route to our doormat. 

The steamed dumplings were acceptably filling and dense and carried within them a savory ground pork. Dumplings have become our arbitrary Chinese appetizer, and LCE's version serves as a reminder of why our habit continues. 

My serving of Szechuan Beef was generous in terms of size and meat. The lobes of meat were marinated to pungent, supple effect, were surrounded by a cornucopia of vegetables, and weltered in a saliferous broth. Ideal on a chilly night, I only finished half of it, saving the rest for tomorrow...or the day after that.

Kay's Orange Chicken was essentially General Tso's Chicken with orange rinds. As candied and moist as it can be, the chicken was only accentuated by the slightly bitter citrus rinds. 

We both appreciated the Won Ton Soup with its tangy broth and large quartet of Won Tons which all invoked the love and facile comfort of chicken noodle. 

The Orange Chicken we had came in chunks, not \"strips\" as the other review stated, nor were they coated in a \"hush puppy batter.\" And I must be on LSD because I sure as Hades tasted quite a bit of orange in the sauce. 

Overall, disappointed we were not."}
