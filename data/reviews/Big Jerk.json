{"text":"I went there because of so many great reviews on Yelp and I'd pass it whenever I went to Gritz Cafe. Yelp community you've disappointed me...I hate to put a bad review on a resturant/food thats of my culture but WOW the food was HORRIBLE!!! I got the jerk chicken dinner for my husband and oxtail dinner for me. The jerk chicken DOES NOT taste like jerk chicken, TRUST! The chicken was so dry and didnt have the jerk, hot, charcoal, grilled taste...at all. The rice and peas eeehhh, the cabbage had a milky liquid to it... whatever that was and the festival dry. My husband who is American even said it was bad. He ate a few bites, threw it away and went to Farmer Boys. My oxtail was just as bad. It was filled with lots of fillers as in carrots and sauce for the lack there of oxtail and the oxtail did not taste like Jamaican oxtail. Again, the side of cabbage had a milky liquid, rice and peas ehhh and festival dry. The ginger drink was good though. I guess Yelp community gave it such a high rating because there are like 4 Jamaican resturants here, excluding Bahama Breeze. Las Vegans hear me!  Bahama Breeze for Caribbean food is the Taco Bell for Mexican food. Listen to a Jamaican, if you want real Jamaican food with a HUGE amount of portion given go to Paradise Place Jamaican Cuisine. I've yet to get the jerk chicken there because every single time I've gone its sold out!!! Thats a sign Las Vegans, like seeing Asian people eating at an Asian restaurant you know it good and close as can be to authentic. Also, the oxtail is prepared like it should along with the rice and peas. They also sell Jamaican sodas, patty and coco bread. The food is like what you would get in Miami (my hometown), New York, Canada anywhere there is a big Jamaican community. I excluded Jamaica because of course the food tastes a million times better in Jamaica. Im sorry Big Jerk :-("}
{"text":"Went to Big Jerk... All I can say is WOW the food was amazing! I had the stewed chicken... and had oxtails rice and peas to go!!! I Love Big Jerk... when my family and friends come in town to visit me I'm taking them there!!"}
{"text":"I was just driving up MLK last Friday, saw a food truck, and found a gem on the Westside.  I bought the oxtail and jerk chicken. The jerk chicken is roasted and has lots of flavor and just enough spice to kick it up a notch. The oxtail was so tender, flavorful, and juicy, I went back the next day and ordered it again along with the shrimp curry. The shrimp are a nice size and this dish reminds me of Thai shrimp curry...maybe because of the coconut milk. I didn't take any pictures of any dishes because I was ready to eat. All the food is delicious!!! Next on my list is the brown stew chicken. You will not be disappointed and the quality of food is worth the price."}
{"text":"Great food! An absolute gem in Las Vegas.  This place will absolutely blow up!!!   I hope they expand to California soon."}
{"text":"Today was my first time trying them out and I must say I'm not impressed. I've gave two other \"jerk\" restaurants here in Vegas a try and I've been disappointed at them all. I'm from the Midwest and jerk there is not like jerk out here. From the way the jerk is made to the sauce, cabbage and rice. The rice in the jerk dinner was dry the Mac and cheese was dead like it wasn't no cheese very dry. The jerk sauce was more like gravy. So really I paid for chicken and gravy not jerk. The bread was hard and dry as well."}
{"text":"Great food and sauces are bomb!!! Especially the jerk sauce!!!!! Open up a restaurant!!!!"}
{"text":"I have driven by this place for a while. We finally decided to try it and it did not disappoint. We had the jerk chicken and oxtail plate. The jerk chicken was smoky, spicy, tender, and sweet. Perfectly balanced. The oxtail was perfection on a plate. Will have to get the oxtail each time we go back. The cabbage side dish was a highlight of the meal, if that was all we had gotten we would have been more than thrilled. I would recommend this place to anyone. Great staff and customer service!"}
{"text":"This Caribbean cuisine is very delicious! The authentic flavor and spices all came together perfectly. Not to mention to the customer service was so friendly. Best in town; Hands down!!!"}
{"text":"the quality was a1. the customer service was very welcoming and you can taste the food was made out of love... definetly recommend big jerk!!!!"}
{"text":"Had to drop the car off at the shop so I had some time to kill and this place was recommended by the auto shop guys. I ordered the 3rib 1chicken combo plate with one side and a drink for $17.50. They have a variety of sauces to compliment the proteins but I tried it \"naked\" first...the chicken was cooked to perfection, tender and juicy, and the flavor was perfect! I tried to pick up a rib but they fell apart as soon as I touched it with my knife which, in my humble opinion, is EXACTLY how ribs should be prepared! The flavor of the meats needed no help but their \"jerk sauce\" and \"ja bbq\" were DELICIOUS! I will definitely come out of my way to eat here again."}
{"text":"Food was delicious! Ribs A1! Staff was very friendly too. Hope they open more locations around town"}
{"text":"First time here. I will definitely be back here again and again. If you like smoke and spice this is a must visit in the Silverado Ranch area."}
{"text":"Just found this place, the food I have to say is truly authentic and really surpassed my expectations. The jerk chicken is so juicy and lots of flavors. Their sauces are pretty good. I would definitely recommend this place if your looking for some tasty Caribbean food. Everyone was very friendly!"}
{"text":"Popped up on my yelp after my aunt told me about it...I took that as a sign to go...Food is pretty damn good and you will be full...No peach cobbler was available  But hopefully I will get some next time 

The Jerk chicken was bomb and juicy
The oxtail......Just get it!
The juice was nice too....pineapple carrot & ginger...Yum"}
{"text":"Seriously amazing! everything on the menu is so delicious i had the curry chicken which is so juicy and the fried chicken is great too!"}
{"text":"So let me tell y'all, it was so good I couldn't even take a picture. Super cool workers. They were able to pretty much customize my plate and everything else was fire. From the ribs to the jerk wings, the Mac and cheese is one of the best I've had in a while. HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PLACE."}
{"text":"Amazing. Just amazing. I'm not the biggest fan of this type of food but I'm a believer now. The food can speak for itself but the guys working there are great. Ask for Nate. Can't believe I haven't heard about this place sooner. I had the ribs and chicken combo that flavor in the smoked ribs too good."}
{"text":"Your chicken wings were great, hush puppy omg, plantain and rice and beans with coconut milk too.  The collard green mix was over the top good"}
{"text":"I heard about Big Jerk when they were a food truck and was surprised to hear they opened a restaurant. Love how close this is to the airport. I can see myself coming here as soon as I land in the future. The interior ambiance, design, and music were on point - very relaxing and comforting. The staff was welcoming and warm. Loved the jerk chicken - if you like white meat it's chopped and buttered up, but if you like dark like me, get the dark thighs! Also: Mac and cheese. Enough said. I hear the rice and peas are traditional so definitely wanna make a trip back soon to try that."}
{"text":"I missed these jerks so much, I drove across town to see them again. Previously a food truck, Big Jerk hooked me with their amazing oxtails shortly before closing to prepare for a brick and mortar location- which finally opened in the Henderson area. Clear across town for me but worth the drive, particularly since we have so few Jamaican restaurants in Vegas.

FOOD:
The oxtails remain my go-to, huge portion and super-tender. The jerk chicken is also solid, and their new pepper steak dish was also very tender. I prefer my ribs a bit saucier, but that may just be a personal preference. They have a couple of fusion-style burgers, for the less adventurous. Their sides are also on point, their mac and cheese is a must-order for me. Yucca fries, greens, and spinach are also good but the rice and peas isn't as consistent. When it's just right, it's amazing. They also have Patties, similar to empanadas, with various fillings- the beef is classic, and my favorite so far. They also recently added an all-day brunch menu on Sundays!

SERVICE:
It's a walkup fast-casual spot, not unlike how their food truck was set up. Service is friendly, owners and management will often check on diners during the meal and they are open to feedback. Location is super clean and staff remembered me from my first visit, which is always great. Some of the newer staff are unfamiliar with the menu but the OG guys from the truck definitely live up to their \"nicest jerks in Vegas\" reputation."}
{"text":"OK.  More of a BBQ joint than a Jamaican/Jerk place.
Had a combo, with a chicken drumstick and 3 ribs; sweet potato fries as the side.

The meat was well cooked and had good flavor.
Served with sauces; sweet & a hot one.  When eaten together as served, its BBQ.  If you ate just the chicken or ribs; good but not Jamaican.  Needed more spices to stand on its own w/o the sauces.

The sweet potato fries would have been good if they were crispy and not limp.  Tried the mac cheese.  OK.  Not spectacular as other reviewers have said."}
{"text":"I consider myself a Caribbean Food Connoisseur.  I grew up in Brooklyn, NY.  My family is Panamanian (basically Spanish Jamaicans!!) and I've eaten some AMAZING in my travels around the world.  With all of that said, Big Jerk: hands down the best Caribbean food in Las Vegas.  

I had the Jerk chicken, my wife had the fried chicken.  Both of the dishes were absolutely great.  The rice and peas was on point.  The steam veggies were perfect.  The pineapple Ginger drink...best non alcoholic drink I've ever had.  
My only complaint was the size of the festival!  

 If you are in the mood for some good food check them out.  You won't be disappointed.  Tell them I sent you.  Probably won't do you any good.  But you can tell them anyway!!!!"}
{"text":"Everything I had was good. This place has the bomb a** jerk and customer service was superb. I moved here from Los Angeles and can say that I have enjoyed a few jerk chicken spots there but this place is just so good and flavorful, I can't stop thinking about it. I 100% recommend the BIG JERK. It's the best out here in Las Vegas. I'll continue to take that drive to get it too. Thanks guys!!!! Be back to see ya'll soon."}
{"text":"The food was GREAT!  I had the jerk chicken white meat with mac and cheese and my hubby had the wings.   Also decided to try the fresh daily made pineapple ginger drink... loved it!  It's so nice to have another food option close by."}
{"text":"This the best food ever!!!!!!!!!!!...jerk chicken...mac=cheese×spinach+their  special sauce I'll be back"}
{"text":"Went here around lunch yesterday with my mom. Was super impressed all around. We pulled up and they weren't busy- the staff was sitting outside on chairs under umbrellas. They immediate got up and greeted us in a kind and professional manner. 

My mom wanted to try jerk and curry. On the jerk she wanted white and dark meat and had some other specific things she wanted to do with her combination plate. They explained that they'd never created a plate like it but worked with us and got it accomplished. 

We went and sat in the car in front of the stand and when it was done, they walked it out to the car for us. Came out hot and fresh. 

It was incredibly tasty and very impressive. The little breadstick they put in there was sweet and savory, the veggies cooked in coconut milk was delicious. The chicken was very moist. 

I'll certainly be back."}
{"text":"This was our first time there the food was excellent! We had ribs and chicken as a complete meal with macaroni and cheese and French fries it comes with a fried plantain and everything was excellent! We highly recommend this place, you've got to try it!"}
{"text":"So usually people pray before their meal but I prayed afterwards for blessing me with this great meal!
Everything about this place is great from the food to the staff. The meal was like we went to big momma house in Jamaica and was serve real homemade goodness.
I had the oxtails with Mac and cheese. The oxtails were perfect with the perfectly seasoned brown gravy and potatoes. I even sucked the bones to make sure I got everything. You can judge but I don't care. The Mac and cheese was the bomb as well and they served this sweet cornbread on the side. Then there was the plantains which were amazing especially the crispy ends. I also had the pineapple and ginger juice that was very refreshing. My friends also enjoyed their meal as well. This place was amazing and will definitely be back and also you can beat the prices."}
{"text":"Looked this place up on yelp and it had great reviews. So we decided we would try Big Jerk out. Omg it was the worst Jamaican food I've ever had I couldn't even eat it. My husband is Jamaican so we know what's good and what's not. We ordered jerk chicken, brown stew chicken and curry shrimp. All of it was BAD! I wouldn't recommend this place at all."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!! Had some great Jamaican fried chicken. It was crispy but also juicy, not dry at all. The Mac and cheese was also on point as well, very creamy and good. The staff was very nice and the inside was clean. Overall a great experience and I would definitely recommend to everyone!"}
{"text":"The fam and I were driving south on MLK from Cheyenne and saw this truck, giant smoker/grill and all the smoke. Rolled our windows down and the aromatics were amazing. We were actually on our way to another place but we ended up turning back around and stopping here. We each grabbed one of the combination plates of Jerk chicken, three separate orders. You're able to customize the different sides that you want as well.  We got a few extra servings of the Jerk sauce for an additional charge, but for future reference, we probably won't get it. We mainly got it for the chicken. The chicken though, was already marinated real well. I had white meat and the other two combos were dark meat. Everything was cooked all the way through without it being dry or burnt. The skin was absolutely delicious! The sides were amazing! I was a fan of their salad/slaw. You've gotta try this place!"}
{"text":"Everything was pretty good and nothing was mind blowing. 

FOOD
The jerk chicken was the best we had on the menu. I got the oxtail, and be sure to get the small one if you're just one person! The mini size was still a lot of oxtail. The jerk had great flavor for everything it went on.

DRINK
Only sodas here folks. Wish they'd had iced tea or beer or at least on non-soda option.

SERVICE
Excellent. We were well attended to even though they looked like they were crazy busy back there in the kitchen.

AMBIANCE
Very casual! It looks and acts like a fast food joint. This is an order-at-the-counter type of place."}
{"text":"Loved this place, friendly and attentive staff with delicious food. Brown stew chicken and ox tail, 2 separate meals, were cooked perfect. Grateful to have real island food in the desert"}
{"text":"Tried this place out today cause I heard great things. Let me just say I was NOT disappointed. I'll definitely get a second meal out of this deliciousness! The fresh pineapple ginger juice is great. The chicken was full of flavor. I'll be back for sure. Gonna try a meat pie next.
Update: I've been here 4x this week lol. It's soooo good. I keep trying something new each time. Also they added Curry Goat to the menu....I was so excited."}
{"text":"All the guys working there were extremely professional. Food was great. I ordered an Oxtail plate with rice and peas, Jerk Chicken plate with white rice, I didn't care for the white rice as it's cooked with coconut milk I'm assuming. The rice and peas was on point though. I also got 3 beef Patties and 3 chicken patties all was great. But you can't leave without ordering a cup of that Pineapple Ginger drink!!!! It's soooooo freaking awesome just a big cup of awesomeness!!!!!"}
{"text":"My family has been really wanting to try this place since we saw it was coming soon! We had grabbed a menu recently and took it home to look over the menu! Just a couple days ago we officially tried it! The food was GREAT! They had a lot of different sauces that they make themselves that were really good! The manager who helped me and my family out was so accommodating and sweet. They were out of two things we wanted to order. And he didn't hesitate to offer us additional items even when it was fine he didn't have to! They defiantly will have our business in the future! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"BIG JERK IS FIRE! The homie Franny put us on now we go all the time! Try the Jerk Chicken and the escovitch fish!Tell them DJ sent ya!!!"}
{"text":"With all the various cultural cuisines available in the Valley, it's hard to find Jamaican food in the desert (go figure!). So I'm glad I stumbled across Big Jerk!

Friendly staff. Fresh food. Gives you a real taste of Jamaica. Reasonable prices (although I have had Jamaican food in other parts of the country that had more budget-friendly price points).

The jerk chicken was seasoned perfectly. The ribs were delicious: a little \"well done\" for my taste, but tasty just be same. Rice and peas (can't go wrong there)! And the mac and cheese, though not Southern style like your grandmother used to make, was still very good: they used macaroni shells, but still very cheesy. 

So, why only 4 stars? The curry chicken was nothing as I expected and have had at other Jamaican eateries. A true disappointment as it tasted more like chicken breast chunks in a curry paste vs. true curry chicken."}
{"text":"Wow just wow!!!! I'm so excited I found this place! I never give 5 stars and this place earned each one. I got Ribs (tender and pull off the bone) and Dark meat jerk chicken (flavorful but not so spicy you can't enjoy it) combo with Mac and Cheese (best Mac and cheese I've had in a while! So cheesy with a Lil kick) and Yucca fries (good) spinach ( very good)! I loved the cabbage and plantain that came with the combo...oh and you can't forget to try the Homemade pineapple ginger juice.... so glad it's so close but even if it's not it's definitely worth a drive. Also as the final icing on top of the cake the customer service was spectacular. So friendly and welcoming. I can't wait to go back and i still have leftovers!"}
{"text":"This place is amazballs.

The Chicken is spicey Juicy and delicious.
The sauces are bomb.
The Staff is so friendly."}
{"text":"Sometimes there can be a bit of a wait...it's a food truck so keep your expectations in line. However, this is one of my favorite restaurants in the country for Jerk Chicken so it's well worth the wait. The staff is also very accommodating."}
{"text":"I had a great meal here. The fried jerk chicken was perfect, along with everything else. I would recommend adding additional chicken or sides for only $1.50 extra per item. I highly recommend everyone try the homemade mango vinaigrette salad dressing, it was super delicious. The staff were all helpful and accommodating making sure I was satisfied. I'm looking forward to returning soon."}
{"text":"Tiara the front cashier is RUDE if a customer asks to make a change in there order customer should be able to change their mind without attitude from a cashier. No questions asked customer is supporting your business and one bad apple shouldnt mess up a great tree. Food is good but service at the front should be more friendlier and better customer service."}
{"text":"Ordered the jerk chicken--mac n cheese. 

Excellent food, big flavors and a great staff!!! Will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"So I love Caribbean food and unfortunately prior to this I have only known of 2 places to get somewhat authentic Jamaican food. So I stumbled across this place today on Yelp as an advertisement. So I'll start from the beginning... The location is convenient. Located on 2 major cross streets, in a shopping plaza, there's plenty of parking.  The atmosphere was very clean. The young lady at the cash register was very helpful and knowledgeable of the food and company overall..I had a Jerk entree w/ rice and peas, veggies and Yukon fries and a price of plantain. Which was all included in my entree, (excluding the extra side which was only an additional $1.50)
My jerk chicken was awesome! Well seasoned and moist. The rice and peas and veggies were ok. The veggies were nice and crunchy but the rice and peas could use a little more of 2 Secret but not Secret ingredients which are already a part of the recipe. The plantain was nice, sweet and thick. The Yukon fries were yummy and brought a bit of creativity to the menu. I had a side of both sauces which were both good. My only disappointment was that there was no Jerk Sauce for me to pour over my chicken and rice. There sauces were good but nothing is like Jerk Sauce. I look forward to going back for more. I think I'll have the Snapper next time."}
{"text":"Delicious! The rice and peas were amazing , jerk and fried  chicken seasoned perfectly, oxtail BOMB, plantains and fried dumplings made me want to weep tears of joy. I have been in LV for 14 years and this is the first time any Caribbean food I've found here wowed me. The service is impeccable, nice sized dining area with an outside patio as well. I forgot about the pineapple ginger punch it was sooooo good! They can have all my coins!"}
{"text":"I brought my family here with high hopes of true Caribbean food.  Sadly this didn't meet our expectations.  The oxtails were a bit chewy and sweet not the typical Caribbean heat and not tender.   The cabbage served with it had nothing on it, no dressing just plain shredded cabbage and it's considered a side dish 
With the meal.   It's more like a garnish

The hand patties(pies) barely had any filling in them.mostly just dough.   I'm use to big fat hand pies loaded with filling.  

the Caribbean crawler appetizer just came with lobster, no yucca fries, no plantain and the lobster was lost in the coating and heavy black pepper, it could have been tofu and you wouldn't have known it.  

Not sure if we came in a bad day as the reviews were what made us come here or perhaps the patrons just simply haven't had Caribbean food in the Caribbean to be able to compare to Caribbean food in las vegas.   Sadly our search continues to find a Caribbean restaurant that tastes and reminds us of home/vacation

The 2 stars was for the orange pineapple drink  as the meal didn't deserve a star rating"}
{"text":"Popped up on my yelp so I had to give it a try. I ordered the jerk chicken with a side a Mac both had some spice to it just how I like it. Very good!!! Portions were a good size also. Will definitely be returning often."}
{"text":"The Oxtail is pretty good, however you can't really eat the whole thing since it's too sweet. The jerk Chicken is delicious except for the fact that it's a very small portion. The place is good but not great."}
{"text":"I had the jerk chicken, rice and peas, and the macaroni and cheese.  It was absolutely delicious!"}
{"text":"Hands down 1 of my favorite Mom's & Pop's restaurant in Las Vegas! Jerk chicken is amazing, shrimp tacos or Jerk chicken tacos with the mango salsa is a GO. Sunday Brunch is definitely my favorite day at Big Jerk. From Jerk Chicken & Waffles to Shrimp & Grits, you can t go wrong at BJ. The pineapple/ginger mixed with unsweetened ice tea is a must for me. I use the ice tea to dilute the sweetness of the pineapple/ginger. 

The staff is amazing and I'm glad to call them my friends!"}
{"text":"This Is not Jamaican food, tastes more like regular run of the mill bbq, ordered jerk chicken plate, it did not taste like jerk chicken, you want real Jamaican food that's authentic go to paradise place on Sahara and buffalo waaaaayyy better always fresh"}
{"text":"Some of the best food I've had in Las Vegas. I go once a week to try something new and different on the menu and I've never been disappointed. The staff is always polite, and courteous, professional, and friendly. I recommend to anyone looking for a great place to eat."}
{"text":"The food is AWESOME! This is our second visit in the last week and we love it. Came on a Friday night and they have a live band playing outside, good vibes, good food, good staff. Seems like a family owned place and those always have the best food."}
{"text":"16$ for rice and peas  oh and the side of small 6 shrimps I guess that's supposed to be the jerk shrimp plate where's the shrimp not worth it at all tiniest shrimp I seen  good flavor but way to expensive not worth it .. could of got a full entree at restaurant and they never have the fried chicken white meat breast when I go"}
{"text":"Food is delicious, service and staff were perfect and price is right. You can't go wrong stopping here. Luckily I disregarded my plan for a cheap lunch at El Pollo Loco when I was turning in the shipping center and saw the grill smoke coming out of the cooker in back of the Big Jerk. Walked in an was immediately greeted by staff who took my order. Chef was right on it right away. Everyone was organized and friendly which can be tough to do at a new, family run restaurant. Ordered the 2 piece dark meat jerk chicken with Mac and Cheese for a side. My order was ready in less than 5 minutes. The bagger even showed me the to go container to show me they had the order right. He offered jerk sauce and spicy habanero sauce for free. Reggae music was a perfect touch too. My only tiny criticism is that they hadn't brewed any ice tea yet so I had to settle on a soda. 

The chicken is juicy and flavorful. Mac and cheese had great flavor too and huge portion size. Plantains- yum- used them to soak up the jerk chicken juice that collected. For $10 I have lunch today and tomorrow. 

I hope this place does well- they've got a good thing going. I'll be back to visit for another lunch hour soon."}
{"text":"First timers here. We got two combos for to go.

Jerk Dark Chicken Combo with Mac n Cheese; OMG THE BEST M&C EVER!!!!

Jamaican Fried Dark Chicken with Spinach; very crispy and well seasoned fried chicken :) loved it :) Spinach had no flavors sadly so I had to add salt and Japanese Dashi powder to make it edible lol but it was perfectly sautéed. 

They made a mistake with one of our orders but no big deal, the server checked inside the boxes before handing them to us and caught the mistake. Ya we had to wait extra minutes while they made the correct dish again but no big deal; the service was nice and they corrected their mistake :)

Their Jerk Sauces (two different styles?) were super delicious. This was personally my first time trying out Jamaican food and it was a good one.

DON'T FORGET TO GET THE MACK N' CHEESE GUYS!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in while in Vegas in business. It's a really clean place. That is huge for me and I noticed as soon as I walked in the cleaniness. There were only 2 customers ahead of me but I has to wait 15 minutes just to be told their card machine was not working. A really nice guy who was doing the cooking reset their internet and everything was working again. I also heard him mention to another cook that a piece of chicken was burnt because the coloration was off. I love my food and that was awesome to hear him question that. Most people would keep it moving. 

The food was good. I am not sure that I will come back but I'm not deterred from it. I ordered their stew chicken with Mac and rice and peas. With an order of Jerk wings just in case I didn't like the stew chicken. Price came out to almost $26."}
{"text":"Ummm yes! I'll be back. The flavor of the 3 rib meal was excellent! On point! The portion could have been a little better. But it is what it is lol. I've been to many different bbq spots and this is one of them that I would come back to at least once a month. So thumbs up Big Jerk for the flavor."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place so bad but unfortunately things didn't last long.

I ordered the oxtails entree and the jerk chicken entree

Oxtails were tender juicy and full of flavor, the rice and peas, plantain, and veggies were incredible! I give it a 4/5 and counts as one star.

The jerk chicken smelled amazing when I opened it, i was excited as I saw all the yelp reviews raving about it. I requested dark meat (leg and thigh) and i discovered that my chicken is completely raw. Not slightly undercooked, not half way cooked but RAW. Unfortunately I will never return here again."}
{"text":"This is surprisingly really good! Wifey had late night bbq cravings. It was almost 10pm. Luckily this place was open late. We had the jerk chicken and ribs combo. With a spicy mac n cheese. Also came with some plantains. Everything I had here was really delicious. The sauces both mild and jerk were both awesome. Everything had a nice smokey taste to it, even the mac n cheese! Plantains were off the hook and great way to end the meal. I also loved their Jamaican Ginger Beer. It's the next morning and I'm still thinking about the grub! I'm for sure coming back I'd like to explore the rest of the menu. I'd love to give it this place 5 stars. But I almost never give anyone 5 stars. But this so far is 4&1/2 stars. Service was great as well. Imma come back real soon I'm thinking. Great 1st impression!"}
{"text":"This place is the bizness! My family and I finally had lunch here today after church, and it was delicious. I'm currently in my 1st trimester of pregnancy and nothing taste good to me. I mean absolutely nothing! In fact we had dinner at Del Frisco Steakhouse last night, and although their steak, lobster bisque, and lobster Mac and cheese usually hit the spot, it didn't do anything for me last night. The flavor of the jerk chicken with bumbaclot sauce and the yuca fries here at Big Jerk not only hit the spot but curled my toes also. Can't wait to come back and bring our clan because friends don't keep great food from friends.

P.S Please do not open another location. We rather wait a long time to enjoy the consistency of this deliciousness."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to visit this place for a while, and I definitely was not disappointed!  Even though it was close to their closing time, we were welcomed in with plenty of smiles.  And the food....WOW!  We ordered the ribs and chicken, and I must say it was some of the best we've every had.  So tasty, not too spicy (because we asked for it that way), and super juicy.  We had the mac n cheese on the side, which was awesome.  A must try if you like Jamaican food!"}
{"text":"Hung over and starving, we set off in our journey to find food that wasn't hamburgers or pizza. Trekking across Las Vegas, we stumbled in a sleepy stupor upon a mom and pop jerk chicken. Yas. I am need some nourishing spiced up chicken. The waiters were personable, the air was cool and we finally got to rest our hungover asses. I ordered the 3 ribs, 1 chicken combo with mac and cheese. Hell yes, I feel myself coming alive again. Chicken is deliciously spiced and the mac and cheese hit me in a spot that will be engraved into me for awhile. I recommend this jerk."}
{"text":"pretty good; don't recommend the macaroni and cheese though pretty salty. really tastes strong and mushy. the meat was great tho. the salads also came with around five pieces of meat and looked pretty green and fresh."}
{"text":"First experience with Jamaican food Big Jerk style...  epic!!!  Tried the jerk chicken a la carte and was fantastic.  Also got the Jamaican style fried chicken dinner to share with a friend, her and I both loved it.  Especially loved the bbq and jerk sauce portion cups full of goodness.  The veggies were remarkable!  Truly a 5 star gem...  Thanks y all!  Thanks yelp for coming through yet again in the clutch..."}
{"text":"Best jerk chicken I have had in Vegas. Went there towards end of day, chicken was great but a tad bit dry. Mac n cheese, veggies, beefcake, it all was good. Great customer service too, be sure to tip!"}
{"text":"This is an amazing! We just can from the Caribbean and we ate so good and some amazing flavor! I am surprised we have some place like this in Las Vegas! I am happy and would recommend anyone living or visiting to come!"}
{"text":"Wow, for the longest time since we moved from Florida, we have been longing for some good Jamaican food. This one by far exceeds the ones here and so does the service. They are very courteous, and the food is really good. Tried the jerk chicken meal, and was pleasantly surprised. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Nice little restaurant for a quick bite to eat.  I tried the beef pattie which was good. Also ordered the fried chicken which was very good. My hubby had the oxtail with rice n peas -We ordered a \"large\" but seemed like a regular size. he rated it 7/10.  Good but could use a little more flavor.  Overall we were satisfied and would go back."}
{"text":"I've had this place on my radar for the past month. We decided to give it a try yesterday. I'm MAD at myself for waiting so long! Big Jerk gave me my entire life do you hear me?!?! The oxtails are absolutely amazing, every bite taste like Heaven. I wish I'd ordered the 10oz, but now I know and I will not make that mistake again,lol. My cousin ordered the Jerk Chicken and she said it was so flavorful,  she was actually sucking the bone.

This is our new favorite spot. I really wanted to get up this morning and go back that's how good the food is. Customer Service was great, overall we had a great experience at Big Jerk. Don't wait like we did, definitely give them a try you will not regret it."}
{"text":"Food was Fire  service was good and it gave me that Vibe that I travel to Miami for... glad this spot is here in Vegas... will be a repeat customer and will bring friends when they come to town..."}
{"text":"This is a Jerk chicken shop that just opened up in henderson in the Walmart neighborhood shopping center. I ordered an appetizer since I really wasn't hungry; therefore I got the jerk chicken wings and plantains. 

Food - My jerk chicken wings came with 6 wings and the plantains came with 4 pieces. The flavor of the sauce was soooo tasty! But I was really disappointed with the size of my wings for the price I paid. The size of the wings were nothing compared to wingstop or bww. It is A LOT smaller. I was really disappointed in this. I've never had jerk sauce before, but the sauce that comes w/ the wings was tangy and sweet. It wasn't spicy at all. But if that's how jerk sauce taste like, it'll get it every time! BUT the plantains were delicious. Their plantains are different than the ones I usually get at El Salvadorian restaurants. The plantains here has a crunch to them. I'm not sure if it's the burnt sugar or what, but that crunch in every bite was the best of it. 

I'v seen plenty of reviews raving about this new mom and pop shop. I will come back and try an entrée instead of the wings to get the full experience of Caribbean food."}
{"text":"Went back today much less hectic than grand opening although a quite a few people here. Super friendly staff very attentive.

It does take a little while to come out, but it's well worth the wait. I had the three piece dark jerk chicken combo with rice and peas. It already comes with one planting, cabbage, and a festival. (That is a Jamaican dumpling)

The plate was beautiful. Chicken was just as good when it comes to flavor, degree of Dennis, and everything about it. Chicken was spot on, all sides were very fresh and flavorful. 

Being from Miami and having spent a lot of time in Jamaica, I consider myself a connoisseur of Jamaican cuisine, especially jerk. This is cooked on a grill outside and it is the most authentic jerk I have had outside of Florida. Their flavors could even compete with some of the restaurants down there. If I could write six stars I would based on The appearance of the restaurant, appearance and taste of the food, and the staff.

.Good food and even better vibes. If you haven't tried it yet, come here and learn the meaning of the word Irie man!"}
{"text":"Friendly service, great food!  The Mac-n-Cheese has some spice, really tasty.  Chicken was tender and perfectly seasoned.  Will definitely return."}
{"text":"First timer... there were so many things on the menu I wanted to try but I kept it simple went with the jerk chicken with rice. It was absolutely DELICIOUS! The macaroni was also like no other. Quick and great service. Definitely recommend Big Jerk!!"}
{"text":"Ribs were good but the pieces of chicken I got were pretty small. Sauces are amazing though, can't really eat it without it. Decent value for what you get. Ribs and 2 pieces of chick comes out to around $15-$17 with one side. I chose the Mac n cheese and paid extra for some rice and it was well worth it.

That combo also came with a drink it it's possible to upgrade for a bottled soda that they have. 

Very friendly service! Staff was incredibly kind and I like that they showed me my food before giving it to me to verify that what I ordered. Great studf"}
{"text":"This place is just ok. I certainly expected larger pieces of chicken for the price. Not sure I'd go back. The service is pleasant enough but a little confusing when you walk in as to whether you order at the counter or from your table."}
{"text":"The food was amazing, perfectly priced and customer service was great. I can't wait to go again! I hope this business goes far. I had the jerk chicken with white rice and a side of Mac n cheese. LOVED IT!!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing! I had the jerk chicken and my husband had the oxtails. Sooooo good! My new favorite spot in Vegas!"}
{"text":"It took over 20 minutes to get my food and it wasn't crowded.  The food is flavorful but the portions are small.  The service is excellent, they interact with you and will check on while you wait."}
{"text":"I periodically crave Jamaican food so we decided to give this fast casual restaurant a try while on vacation.  We each chose the 2 piece jerk chicken plate that included a choice of 1 side, my wife opting for mac & cheese while mine was peas and rice.  Also included as the day's vegetable were sweet plantains which with the pineapple and ginger beverage serving as the highlight of our meal.  The jerk chicken was good, but the promised, per our receipt, leg and thigh turned out to be a drumstick and chunk of cartilage with only a small amount of meat on it.  Also, both sides were served at close to room temperature."}
{"text":"I am SO excited this place opened up down the street from me. the service is stellar, you can really tell the team cares about their food. I was able to try the curry chicken and it was flavorful and juicy. I can't wait to return to try more of the menu!"}
{"text":"OMG!! Sooo good!  Found this place driving by running errands with the fiancé.  First round.. we ordered the Jerk Chicken white meat combo with mac n cheese and the Fried Lobster Bites.  Easily one if the beat mac n cheeses Ive ever had. 
They guy who helped us was super nice. They make their own sauces and the one we tried was ridiculous good.  We were so impressed we got a 2nd round.  This time we got the Chicken curry and another side of mac n cheese.  Soooo good!!  I now follow them on Instagram so I can see pics.  Can't wait to try the Jerk Fries and Tacos I saw on IG.  Highly recommend this place and try as much as you can like we did!"}
{"text":"Overall, my experience from walking in to ordering and conclusion of the meal was decent. 

I feel horrible for not asking their names, but customer service was great. The cashier taking my order was warm and friendly. 

Food came out quick.  I was mostly disappointed by the main dish but the side dishes and the employees more than made up for it. I ordered the dark meat 3 piece and bombaclot (spiciest) sauce with rice and peas for the side. The rice and peas were seasoned very well. The fried plantain and Jamaican festival (deep fried sweet corn bread dumpling) helped off seat the spice. The disappointment was that the chicken came out like warm. The sides were warmer than the chicken.

After finishing the dish, I brought it up to the gentleman that seemed like he was the manager possibly? As mentioned I felt horrible for not getting his name, but he was very open and receptive to the comments to help themselves improve. They took the comment in stride and I felt they were genuine about wanting to improve. 

I will definitely be back again to try the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"I really liked this place! My first time there. It was tasty. The jerk sauce is pretty spicy, but flavorful. The bbq sauce was delicious! The chicken breast was super moist and juicy. The grilled flavor made it even better.The mac and cheese was yummy as well. The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because the side of mac was so small, but so good. I guess that's why the guy ringing up my order said I could get an additional side lol I will definitely go back to try the ribs on my next cheat day."}
{"text":"I really want to give this place more stars than 2 but, the oxtail was super salty. Overall, this is really not a Jamaican Resturant! The flavour was VERY disappointing! Nice friendly employees though."}
{"text":"My son and I went to Big Jerk tonight for dinner and was very happy with our choice. I ordered the jerk chicken and ribs. The chicken was so tender and the flavor was amazing and the Ribs were awesome too. Even the plantains were delicious. We are going back Friday to hear the reggae band and I am already looking forward to more delicious Caribbean food.  If you like jerk chicken or Caribbean food this is a must try. Lastly the staff was very good and friendly. Thank you big jerk you really made my night."}
{"text":"Great service with a very relaxed atmosphere.

I had the steak and eggs brunch special and I was very pleased with the food!

I definitely recommend coming here to eat and relax."}
{"text":"Hands down most authentic Caribbean food in Vegas. Large menu to chose from and the friendly staff makes you feel at home and comfortable. Highly recommended you stop by and get a taste of the island WAA GWAAN"}
{"text":"First time ever trying any type of Caribbean food, and man the BIG JERK delivered. The much raved on mac and cheese was smooth, creamy, flavorful and cooked in a familiar yet new and exciting way. We ordered take out and got one of almost everything! The plantains were cooked phenomenally, smooth and yummy. The chicken was LIT! It had a nice rub that was zesty and the meat soft. The ribs were huge! They also had a spicy kick. The oxtail was perfect. Portions were huge and definitely shareable. I can't wait to actually go in and check out the establishment. Cheers!"}
{"text":"This was the perfect spot for me to try Caribbean food for the first time. I order the Jerk Chicken and the seasoning was amazing, it's on the spicier side but well worth the struggle of taking breaks in between every few bites. The guy behind the counter has awesome customer service, he took the time to explain the menu and gave me recommendations on what to order. I will be back to try the oxtails!"}
{"text":"4 1/2 stars!!! The food was outstanding! The dark meat jerk chicken was so flavorful. The mac and cheese was the bomb. The people are so nice and friendly. It was so good I had to order something for dinner before I left. So I ordered the oxtails, I will let you know how they are. I would have given five stars, but I think that the chicken pieces were just a bit small. But that will certainly not stop me from coming back every time I am on this side of town. I beg you to please open One in the Northwest after you become super successful here. And I know that you will."}
{"text":"Everything is good!!!  I tried the pepper steak, curry chicken, jerk chicken jerk burger & the Fisk sandwich !!! Delicious!!!!! The Mac & cheese is also a favorite of mines... Keep up the good guys  ps. Try the pineapple ginger  Great !!!!"}
{"text":"Really I can't believe the stars this place has I order the oxtail and lobster appetizer Total was about $38 The ox tail was so chewy I couldn't get any meet off it the lobster Idk how anybody calls that lobster and it's so sad because I was so excited to try this place and it was a major disappointment I would never eat here again that was not Caribbean food!!'m"}
{"text":"Sooo good!! I had the white meat Jerk Chicken with Rice and Peas. Everything was very flavorful and I felt like you got a good amount of food for the price. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Every time I go I never know what to get I had the jerk wings today which was amazing definitely becoming one of my favorite spots!  Plus the team is great!!"}
{"text":"Was craving oxtails while visiting Vegas and found this place on yelp . Got 10oz oxtails with Mac n cheese for the side . Everything was bomb . Better than my moms. I don't visit Vegas often, maybe a week every 2-3 years, but I'll make sure I'll stop by here when I do"}
{"text":"The food is excellent and so is the service.  Best Mac and cheese I've ever had.  The jerk chicken taste just like the islands.  We are so glad we found this place and staff are all so nice.  Definitely recommend you eat here!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my meal here. The only reason I gave 4 stars is I was very disappointed in the plantain. They were way to salty. The jerk sauce was decent, and i loved my rice and peas! The cabbage was good too. It is a great little spot to kick that Jamaican food craving. They did a good job decorating and the bathrooms are clean!!! I can't wait to come back and try some more things from the menu."}
