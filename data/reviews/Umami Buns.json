{"text":"I've eaten lunch from this cart a number of times and each time it has been delicious.   I'm always a little disappointed when I try to find this cart and I can't for lunch.  The pulled pork bun is my favorite and the beef one is good too.  They are flavorful and filling.  I've ordered both the fried noodles and the edamame as a side and while they are both good I recommend the edamame as it is more filling and nutritionally rich than the noodles.  While I've seen some people complain about the price, I think the prices are pretty standard for a food cart lunch in Madison and considering the quality of the food I think it's money well spent."}
{"text":"Wow. Seriously wow. I can't believe I haven't been to this food truck sooner! The food is AMAZING! I got the beef bun, and first, the bun was so soft.  It was like a pillow! And the ratio of meat to bun was really great.  I never felt like the meat overpowered the bun or vice versa.  Finailly, the flavors are ON POINTE! I wish I could have tried the pork belly, but of course, now I have a reason to go again :) Well done! Loved the food :)"}
{"text":"I tried this cart for lunch on Library Mall and wish I could have gone back for more! I ordered one pulled pork bun with edamame for $4 and was happily surprised by the large pile of edamame, but wish I had gotten another bun. I definitely recommend getting the 2 buns + side for $7 if you are looking for a full meal. 

The buns of the little sandwiches are \"mantou\" buns (aka steamed buns) and are a wonderful pillowy delicious goodness - I'll definitely have to go back one of these days."}
{"text":"Hmm. I'm on the 3-4 line here. It's not that Umami Buns is doing anything wrong, and I liked the spicy tofu buns (think short, fat tacos with Asian fillings) with edamame, but if you aren't eating meat, you definitely need to upgrade to the pricier ($10 vs. $7) three-bun combo lest you be hungry again about 90 minutes later. I could probably have eaten five of them without too much difficulty.  But the buns are fresh and inventive, you can fire them up with some sriracha, and Umami Buns was one of the tastier and better choices that I made during a snakebitten foray into vegetarianism in the cow capital of the U.S. Since I'd do it again despite the reservations, I'll round up. As the menu is only three or four items for this truck, check out the photos and you should get a comprehensive idea of whether this looks like your thing."}
{"text":"The pork buns were bland ,cold and no flavors. I'm spoiled by the food trucks from seattle I guess. This one put zero efforts on their food,a really sad experience."}
{"text":"Eh- just ok. I grew up eating Taiwanese pork belly buns so was not impressed with their concoctions. Pork was good but seasoning and relish didn't add to the flavor. Also ordered the spicy tofu and the tofu was HARD DRY and flavor-less. Buns came with a side of edamame which were unseasoned...NO salt at all and were a touch dry. So sad."}
{"text":"Only had the pork belly with wonton chips but would definitely recommend it. The pork belly went well with the sweet pickles. Great deal for $4."}
{"text":"Amazing buns! The wonton chips are a tad too salty but I can eat this all day, all night."}
{"text":"Pork belly done right! It is really difficult to find good pork belly, it is either too fat or too lean, too hard or too soft...but Umami's comes very close to my idea of pork belly perfection. I had the pork bun, meal ($4) which came with 2 slices of pork belly in a bun, and a side of endamame (there's the option of getting the wonton skin crisps as a side). The bun is very good too, soft and fluffy. The portion is small, more of a snack size.  I found them at the intersection of Main and Martin Luther King Jr on Saturday at the Farmers market. Highly recommended for a snack (you'd probably need 4 or 5 for a full meal)."}
{"text":"I was in Madison with my family while my wife spent the week at EPIC a few weeks ago. It was a beautiful Spring day so we decided to walk downtown to waste some time. We came across the multitude of ethnic food carts, and decided to try Umami Buns. We were not disappointed!! We tried the Korean BBQ Beef Buns and the Spicy Pulled Pork Buns. 

The Spicy Pulled Pork was great. The sweet combined with the spicy was a wonderful contrast, but the buns were amazing! They were like fluffy pillows in our mouths.

The Korean BBQ Beef Buns were AMAZING!! I don't know if it was the cucumber, or the spicy scallion salsa, or the spicy mayo, but the whole combination just worked. We could have ate 20 of them if we had more cash. The free edamame was a great touch.

All I can say is, I wish we had one of this in IL!!"}
{"text":"Ate at the food truck today and it was delicious! Got two buns: one with normal tofu and one with spicy tofu. I loved the food inside the buns but those buns are so amazing that I don't know what would taste bad in them. The edamame was salty and yummy. And the wonton chips are so much better than any chip you could buy in a store. Can't wait to eat there again!"}
{"text":"Popped by the food truck after a long run around Madison. Good pork buns but not the best I ever had. Pork belly was a bit too fatty and even with two buns, I was still starving.  I wish I could come back for the dumplings but alas, they were sold out!"}
{"text":"Was ... weirded out by what I got... 
Buns. I expected a bun filled with the goods, you know? But you're looking at 5 stars and going... \"um, what? But you liked it!\"
Absolutely loved it. And, upon my first bite, it made total sense as to why they do things the way they do. They've much more control over the quality of their product that way.
Had the tofu bun + edamame. Both were exceptional and left me wishing I had just gone ahead and done 2 buns instead of the 1. That said, I left Library Mall full and satisfied with the one for me lunch. (Testament to its filling nature: I had a scone and french soda for dinner because I was not quite hungry by evening... and I was at a dance event, so I wasn't just sitting around all afternoon.)"}
{"text":"Absolutely love the Umami food cart.  I've tried both their Spicy Tofu and regular Tofu buns- both were amazing and come with a huge pile of edamame on the side, which I love.  Although slightly pricey (3 small buns for $10, side of chips or edamame included), the flavor of the buns make up for it.  The spicy tofu is dressed with a delicious spicy mayo, complimenting the pan-fried Tofu extremely well.  The regular tofu bun was topped with fresh scallions and a sweet, thick hoisin sauce that I could probably just drink on its own, it's that good.  Both buns had pickled cucumbers, adding a slight saltiness which was wonderful.  The buns themselves are soft and pillowy- wish they offered cooking classes so I could learn how to make them myself.  Will definitely have to go into the actual restaurant to try more."}
{"text":"Wonderful!  Perfect, squishy little pork buns, friendly cart people, reasonable prices. What could you not love about that?

I have only thus far tried the edamame as a side with the  pork belly and pulled pork buns, on recommendation by the cart workers. All were wonderful. I especially loved the asian peach chutney on the pulled pork, it paired well with the shredded carrot and was almost a dessert to me. 

You can bet I will be trying more in the future. The very near future."}
{"text":"I usually get these when I spot them at the farmer's market. I love love love their pork belly and bulgogi buns. I've only ever had the wonton chips as my side and they're also pretty good. It is a little pricey, but I quickly forget the cost once I take a bite out of a deliciously filled bun!"}
{"text":"I tried this cart randomly last year and have been hooked ever since! I waited the long winter and spring months for the cart to return to University mall and have been back several times since April. I love that a big helping of edemame comes as a side and that $10 can buy you three buns and a side. I will always recommend this cart (and the restaurant!)"}
{"text":"Super expensive for what you get! If you have money to waste, this is your place! There are a lot of better eateries in the area. Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"I finally, finally tracked down the Umami cart at the farmers market!! My friend and I split 3 buns plus a side (edamame or wonton chips) for $10; pretty pricey for a food cart, but not so bad when you are splitting with another person. 

We got the pork belly bun, the bulgogi bun, and the spicy tofu bun. Of the three, I was only very impressed with the pork belly and bulgogi buns. The meats are marinated well and cooked even better. I thought the additional condiments (hoisin sauce, cucumbers, etc.) were a nice touch that helped add a different flavor dimension (and crunchiness!) to the buns. 

I, however, did not like the spicy tofu bun. I'll give them credit for offering a vegetarian option, but the slices of tofu are way too thick and way too bland for the spicy sauce (which is really just mayo + sriracha) to counteract. Nice try, but I'll pass. I was also not very impressed by the buns themselves - they were way over steamed, which made them difficult to chew.  

My biggest gripe was with the slow, slow service. I understand that they make each bun to order, which is great, but if that is the case, there really needs to be more than one person in the cart. One person taking orders and one person putting the buns together would make the process go much more smoothly and quickly! 

Five stars for the bulgogi and pork belly buns and three stars for the service averages to a nice, even four stars for Umami Buns."}
{"text":"Died and went to heaven. These pork buns are AMAZING! Got them to go and they still tasted great!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars. Service was fast and the edamame was cooked perfectly. I thought the pork belly was a little on the fatty side for my taste with too much sauce and one of the buns tasted like it had been frozen and reheated. The beef was delicious however."}
{"text":"Tasty, but pricey.

I caught the cart on the weekends at the Farmer's market. It's pretty good, but with the price I was hoping for a little better.

Never had it at the actual restaurant, but I'm assuming it's the same. It's sadly just a tad bit better than the same pork bun served at Great Dane's, so that's not really saying much."}
{"text":"Can't get enough of your love, babe. 

And there is certainly lotsa love to be had with an Umami pork bun. Oven roasted pork belly, scallions, hoisin sauce, and pickled cucumbers. Yep, it's love. 

The steamed bun is warm, fluffy and scrumptious, the meat tender. 

Flavorfully wonderful."}
