{"text":"Dreadful, simply and utterly dreadful. 

I know this is a chain restaurant but blimey, no standards what so ever.

Where to start? First and foremost we had to wait about 15 minutes to even get menus, the food took almost 50 mins to arrive (We were about to just leave the money for the sodas and just walk out! The food came out just as we were getting up). Absolutely abysmal staff presence, We couldn't find a waitress or staff member for about 30mins to even find out if our food was being cooked, the kicker was this place was nearly EMPTY (There were 3 other tables in a very large restaurant, no wonder with this kind of service!)  Don't even get me started on how long it took to find someone to actually pay for our meal. Honestly, No staff out on the floor or manning the register at all. There was a massive line up of people waiting to be seated when we were walking out despite the place being nearly empty and quiet.

Really felt sorry for the old couple on the table next to us, they were in before we got seated, but they kept mucking up their orders so badly that I had actually finished my MEAL before they even got anything to eat. They either would take their order, come back 15 minutes later and tell them they didn't have any of that item left, or that the chef couldn't cook it. That couple had so much patience. 

I have a lot of patience and can forgive a lot of bad service habits, but this place is just dire. Will not be returning to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time on a weekday morning at about 10:30.

When we arrived it was packed, most people were finishing up.

We were seated at a very wobbly table, which we fixed ourselves as the woman who offered to fix it never returned.

It took a while to get our drinks and food orders, but the food took an average wait.

I ordered a skillet which I didn't enjoy at all. The peppers tasted off (almost vinegar-y) and the sausage was okay, hashbrowns weren't very good, and they used way too much hollandaise sauce. My boyfriend said his was okay. 

Part that frustrated me was there was no quality check, so I couldn't even ask for more water.

Even after we were done it took another 10 minutes of sitting idle, and eventually went up to the station to pay, since nobody ever brought us our bill. 

I also noticed some other people who were a bit frustrated.

Such a shame as I used to love breakfast trips to Smitty's as a kid. It is also evident that their decor needs an upgrade, and waitresses need to be trained.

I'm really not trying to be a negative nancy, maybe I just have bad luck"}
{"text":"Low quality for the price.  Usually good service though. 

Very disappointed in the kids meal omelette,  absolutely cannot believe that cost $6.  It was maybe a one egg omelette,  the size of our one year olds hand.  A serving size is two eggs,  can't they at least do a serving? 

The buffet leaves a lot to be desired.  Most items are dry,  though it is nice to have the fresh fruit bowl (when it's full).  Other Smitty's buffets are superior."}
{"text":"This Smitty's is located in the Marlborough Mall, and is noteworthy for the lounge.  The small lounge, which has an entrance from the outdoors, has a workaday clientele and GREAT prices.  High balls and beer are normally under $4, and wings are on for just 9 cents each most of the time (pretty meagre wings, but what can you expect for that price).  The nice part is that the place was built only a few years ago, so the pool table, fireplace, VLTs, booths, etc. are not dive-like, even if the prices are!"}
{"text":"Always enjoy the breakfast special. Staff have always been magnificent. Food tastes great. I enjoy the diner and the atmosphere here. Only ever had breakfast here. Several times and never disappointed."}
{"text":"Went for lunch to this place after shopping in the mall at Marborough. 11:30am, drunks cursing the VLT's and burping loudly, food also not that great."}
{"text":"The food is pretty low quality, but you should expect that at a Smitty's. Nothing special about it."}
{"text":"love this place ! its great for breakfast or lunch , food comes super fast ... and has always been awesome !"}
{"text":"Had lunch at Smitty's Westbrook on Tuesday, Jan. 29. The service was very slow, and an elderly couple left after waiting close to twenty minutes to be served their drinks. The service however, although terrible, is not my main complaint. I ordered a waffle with blueberries, and my Grandmother ordered crepes with strawberries. The blueberries on my waffle tasted off, almost moldy, and so we complained. At that point I didn't feel like eating anything else, and the waiter did not charge us for my meal. 

Both my Grandmother and I started feeling ill on Wednesday evening. After reading the AHS Inspection reviews, I am quite certain we have food poisoning. Will never eat here again, and I wouldn't recommend it."}
{"text":"Went here to the pub area for wing night!  The wings were decent! Service was very good!  The beer is cheap so in all its a typical smittys pub area with vlts, cheap beer and wings"}
{"text":"The local Westbrook Mall Smitty's is just another Smitty's.

I expect that you have visited a Smitty's before, but if you haven't I suggest you try to find somewhere that is not a chain. If you're like me and you don't want to drive too far away from home and therefore are willing to put up with the lower quality, then Smitty's is an alright choice. I stopped in on one weekend after walking over and was served the quality that I've come to expect from Smitty's. They had their breakfast buffet going on but I just ordered a skillet from the menu. It was what you would expect.

Average food, average prices, even with average service!"}
{"text":"I was served quickly and coffee was brought to the table within a minute of seating. I needed five minutes to order and the server checked to see if I was ready twice before I ordered. I received three coffee refills. The service throughout the meal was excellent. 

I ordered the Ukrainian scrambler. It was average food with bland flavor. The portion was good. Probably could have used a more flavorful cheese and the onion could have been fried with the egg instead of bring placed on top. The sausage was good.

The location was convenient. The price did not reflect the value (bland food). Not a place I would recommend, but not really any reason to avoid it either."}
{"text":"I'm really not a fan of this location. The service is slow, unattentive and if it's not completely empty it's ridiculously noisy.. I'm not often one to complain but when my glass of water never gets topped up I start to get cranky. That's likely my #1 pet peeve at all restaurants and this place is the worst for it. That and when food comes out cold after waiting forever for it to arrive... Get my gist? I can't foresee ever returning to this Smitty's. Pity cause it's close to home, but the convenience just isn't worth it."}
{"text":"Today's just our second time at Smitty's. I got a $10 coupon which I got on our first time at the East Hills location. We wanted to dine at Smitty's East Hills but it was out pf way to where we plan to head after so we ended up in Airdrie. 

My apologies if my review would seem like a comparison to East Hills. I just cant help it. It was Sunday and it was raining. I understand it could get very busy. But there was no greeter when we came in. Customers were beginning to pile up by the entrance. Server came and managed the crown well. I just didn't get her name but she was nice and very apologetic. 

We enjoyed the buffet over at East Hills so we thought to do it again this time in Airdrie. Again wrong decision. The buffet entrees was so few it's not really worth the price. Bacon would always run out and it would take forever for it to get replenished. It almost fees like we're being forced to have sausages instead. 

The service wasn't really good too except for the lady who helped us initially at the front. We were seated by another server who, after giving us our drinks, never came back to ask if we needed something else like say \"cuttleries\" and/or \"table napkins\"? We were only given those until we asked another server who just brought in forks and knives without the napkins and placed them at the table just like that. 

Service wasn't good (except for only one person)...food wasn't good...so what can I say? Im not coming back to this location. And I will not recommend it to others as well."}
{"text":"I liked service and food before, but waiting for my order now to see if still good! Having multigrain pancakes bacon and fruit!! Love the fact they let me bring my coffee in! Service is still great....and food is..... Still good fruit was fresh not dried up!! Bacon was average but good! Glad I came here instead of Ricky's"}
{"text":"Food is rough ! Even my kids passed on it . We went for the buffet breakfast . Still had to pay full price even though my 5 yr old only eat half a sausage and my other soon had nothing ! I filled up on the eggs as the rest looked like something I would feed a dog:( won't be back . Staff were friendly so that helps !"}
{"text":"I love love love the idea of Smittys. Classy, all day bteakfast food. Who wouldnt be stoked? So on Sunday we thoufht wed check it out.

Walked in, super busy. But looking around saw a lot of staff and within 5 minutes were seated - which was awesome , especially for how busy it was.

But that was the end of our service for 20minutes. It literally took 23 minutes to get a coffee. Then it was a pain to teack down the waitress to make an order. 

Understaffed best describes smittys. What looked like the manager was literally running around the dining room asking \"has your order been taken\" to everyone in our section. So unprofessional. 

My husband was craving eggs benny and since the plate was $12 and the buffet was $13 went with that. But it sucked, the french toast was hard, the pancakes dry. The fruit wasnt fresh cut but out of a can in that sugar syrup. The home fries were pretty good, but they were never stocked. The eggs benny were delicious but could have used more hollandise sauce - would have loved to tell our waitress this, but she wasnt available. 

I get it, they want to seat as many people as possible, but i felt rushed. I didnt enjoy my meal, the environment was high anxiety, with the manager talking bad to us about the waitresses and their lack of attention. Super unprofessional, luckily he mentiones hes being moved and today waa his last day. Sooooo unprofessional. And ps Mr.Manger, patrona dont like to hear management talk down their employees, but we do however like money off our bill for such bad service!

Never again. Not this loctation."}
