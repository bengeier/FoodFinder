{"text":"I like everything about this resturante.  Price and value first your money was good. Ambiance was what I call casual elegance. There is an excellent Wine selection and the craft cocktails were delish #buthatfoodthough.   The food was better than some of the higher end restuarante I have been to. My server Mike, was great very friendly and fast with our appetizers and our meal  We found this establishment on a humble,  but  we will be back.   Try the stuffed peppers, the lamb chops and the crab stuff salmon. All very flavorful, tender and nicely presented"}
{"text":"They are very underrated! Their food is very good , but not the most notable location. I stumble upon them by accident and have enjoy everything I've received. Very personable employees and customer service."}
{"text":"Found this spot after working at the walgreens and smelt the bbq in the air. Went looking and found it. A better location would be nice but the food was amazing. 2 polish boys for $5 was a steal and a dollar more for a po' girl with  rib meat on top. Rib fries were amazing as well and very well priced and the dood was hot and fresh. You can tell the food wasnt just sitting around all day."}
{"text":"They serve these tender turkey ribs with this sauce.....really that's all you need.  They routinely sell out.....so call ahead.  Tip: grab a bottle of local made wine to wash it all down."}
{"text":"I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS PLACE!  THE PRICES ARE MORE THAN REASONABLE AND THE FOOD IS EXCEPTIONAL! A MUST TRY B-B-Q place if you're in or around the Maple Heights area!  It's take-out only though, no place to sit unless they have the wine tasting gatherings behind the building.   Yes, they have wine tasting here as well; once a month on specifically chosen days.  They usually have fliers.  Okay, where to start?  Well, this little take out joint for barbecue, burgers, hot dogs and fish has a nice menu, GREAT food and the people here so nice!  The quality and quantity of food is almost overwhelming in a good way!  You will most likely have left overs if you order one of the dinners especially the ribs.  The first thing about this \"little place\" is that if you don't know where to look you will miss it.  So I'm going to give my best description of many locations around this area to help.  It is diagonally across the street from Gale's garden center and is next door to a Walgreens (Walgreens is across the street from 7-Eleven) and \"A Taste Above\" is in a tiny brick building.  The tiny brick build has both a barbershop on the left and then \"A Taste Above\" is on the right.  It seriously is one of those places where if you blink you will miss it.   A private lot in front is shared with both \"A Taste Above\" and the barber shop.  The right side is where the entrance is.  Once inside there are pictures every on all the walls except where the menus are and they are written in chalk on chalkboards so they can add/erase at any moment.   This leads me to the ONLY reason I'm not giving \"A Taste Above\" a perfect 5 star rating because I really love and enjoy the food.  A Taste Above is actually a \"shared\" kitchen with another take out joint within the place called \"Four Jays\".  Four Jays apparently is the company who makes the burgers (the take out menu inside divides \"A Taste Above\" menu and \"Four Jays\" menu so it can get confusing) and in order to know what is actually available you will have to call as the dates for certain food items can change but there are several items available everyday ranging from the Turkey Ribs to the loaded fries and Polish Boys.  On a side note which makes \"A Taste Above\" absolutely one of my favorite B-B-Q spots are the specials: Tuesday's are the 2 for $5 dollar Polish Boys (they are a good size too) and Wednesday's are the 2 for $6 Polish Girls.  Polish Boys/Girls are my FAVORITE, hands down!  A polish boy should be this:  A brat or beef sausage on a large bun with coleslaw on both sides of the meat, topped with French fries and barbecue sauce.  A Polish Girl takes that one step further and adds either pulled pork or with \"A Taste Above\" they use pieces of rib meat and a good portion of rib meat it is!   Overall, I ABSOLUTELY recommend \"A Taste Above\" for your next barbecue stop!  The food is amazing but I do recommend calling ahead to make sure what you would like is available.  Also, they only sell Faygo soda and various flavors so you will have to probably stop at Walgreens or 7-Eleven next door (you do have choices) and get Coke/Pepsi or something else. I would DEFINITELY recommend \"A Taste Above\"."}
