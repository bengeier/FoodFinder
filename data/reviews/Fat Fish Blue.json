{"text":"When I lived in Cleveland I always ordered from this place. The food at Fat Fish is the best. Ok can we now get one in Phoenix?"}
{"text":"I just don't understand the hype about this place, other than the  jazz.  The food is ok, but nothing that I would call New Orleans-style.  

The food is mediocre at best.  Overseasoned and inauthentic.  I have had the Jambalaya, Gumbo and Etoufee, and neither are close to what I get in the south.  They tasted \"prepared\" and the fish did not taste fresh.  Cleveland used to have a more authentic New Orleans restaurant called Red Fish, over on 9th, which was much better and much more authentic.  

Drinks were ok and the noise-level was high.  Prices were not that bad but the food was.  

I have gone a few times when friends insisted, but this is not a place that I would go to on my own.  Definitely no \"wow\" factor."}
{"text":"I went there with a group of friends and we all loved the food. It's a fun place and the service was great. I had the best jambalaya! Definitely great cajun food."}
{"text":"Pretty mediocre food.  

It's partly my fault for going before a big concert at the Q., but the service was bad - they forgot things, brought out the wrong items. The food was disappointing - general foodservice quality that you'd expect from a big chain restaurant.  There are much better options downtown, though the location of this place to the Q/Progressive field is convenient.

Also, don't park in the garage upstairs when there's a big event going on - it can take an hour to get out when the exit is backed up!"}
{"text":"Obviously, it has nothing on eating in the dirty south. But for being a cajun place in Cleveland, you cant beat it! 
I miss their gumbo before Cavs games, and the Ghiradelli chocalate purse :)"}
{"text":"This place is the TGI Fridays of cajun food. Don't go here if you have a taste for cajun food, or creole food, or anything even remotely similar. If your idea of excitement is ordering something other than your 'usual' at Fridays or Applebees, this place will be perfect. Otherwise, it will bore and probably disappoint you. My shrimp po' boy was basically a fried shrimp, lettuce, and tomato sandwich, meaning it had almost nothing in common with an actual po' boy - and the hoagie bun was stale at that.

Don't go here looking for classic New Orleans drinks either. Their mixed drink menu contains exactly five items, and while the full bar might tempt you to order something else, when I tried, the terribly overworked waitress asked more than once if the drink I wanted was \"on the menu\" before I gave up and ordered one of the fairly tasty but overpriced Dixie Black Lager. If the lower octane stuff doesn't suit you (and you're willing to stick to the menu), be sure to note their signature \"blue\" martini - (you'd be hard not to, as they take every opportunity to push it). This drink deserves a special mention. Why is \"blue\" in quotes you might ask? Well, I don't know - it certainly is blue. Maybe they migrated over from the word \"martini\" because I can't think of a drink farther away from a martini than this coconut rum, blue curacao and pineapple monstrosity.

The bottom line: skip this place and stumble just a few feet further to E. 4th where you'll find a whole host of great, unique Cleveland restaurants much worthier of your patronage."}
{"text":"I was really disappointed in my Fat Fish Blue experience. First, I didn't realize it was a chain restaurant, which was my own fault. Second, to learn that their crab cakes are frozen was extremely disheartening. It made me wonder how much of their food is frozen/pre-made. 

My boyfriend ordered jambalya and I got the 1/2 rack of ribs. He wasn't impressed by his food, but considered it \"OK\". I wasn't a fan of my ribs either. The bones didn't extend the length of the meat and I was stuck picking gristle out of my mouth after every other bite. It wasn't attractive and not what I consider \"a good time\". I will admit that I usually rock a rib bib, but the gristle business ruined it. I did, however, enjoy their sweet potatoes. 

The vibe inside just didn't strike any chords with me either. There was live music, but the band would play a song or two (volume was WAY too loud) and then they would stop for an extended period of time. There wasn't any flow. Also, we went when the Cavs were playing thinking we'd be able to watch the game, but the only tv near us was an old school tv that couldn't have been more than 20\". The service was good, but nothing spectacular. 

We won't be back."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place.  I mean, it has the all around chain restaurant feel but I had a good time.  Maybe I'm just a sucker for live music.  The dude that was singing was actually pretty good and kept me entertained for the duration of my meal.

I only stopped in here for a quick meal and chose the vegetable soup and sweet potato fries.  The soup was absolutely delicious with big chunks of mushrooms and other goodies.  The fries, good as well.  I would definitely return here to try some of the other fare on the menu."}
{"text":"We were recommended here by the staff at the Doubletree hotel during our one night visit. Being fans of Cajun food, my boyfriend and I were very excited to get some crawfish and gumbo! The restaurant was large and very festively decorated but seemed to be understaffed that night. It was a game night (Indians) so we thought there might've been more of a crowd at the bar but it was pretty dead.

I had a cocktail in a souvenir glass and my boyfriend had their beer special for $2. Both were very good! I loved the glass as I could take it home with me as a reminder of the trip. We ordered the corn bread, a large boil (with crawfish, mussels, shrimp, andouille sausage, corn, and potatoes) to share, and a cup of gumbo.

The corn bread was DELICIOUS! Being both southerners, we appreciate some good corn bread and this one was flavorful and moist. The boil was a tad dissapointing as it was dry - the crawfish tasted awful as if it'd been sitting around for ages. The mussels, shrimp, sausage, etc. was tasty and seasoned well. The gumbo had some good flavors but definitely wasn't authentic Cajun style.

All in all, if this place were in the south, I would've given it 2 stars. But for Cleveland, I'll give it 3."}
{"text":"Fat Fish Blue is one of those places I've always walked past and assumed was bad.  Through their hazy windows, all I could see were crappy looking streamers, tiki statues and NO patrons.  Anyway, my husband had a groupon and we decided to check this place out and I have to say I was  pleasantly surprised.  The food wasn't terrible but it wasn't entirely awful.  Second, the place was pretty empty so service was quick.  and third of all, the groupon didn't have any exclusions when it came to alcohol soooooooo...bottoms up!  We ordered the  cornbread (a little dry and bland but not entirely indigestible) and crab cakes as an appetizer.  Again, neither was terrible but neither was awful either.  Just average.  For a main course, I ordered the caesar salad with blackened salmon along with a glass of pinot noir.  Holy disproportions, Batman! My salmon was about 1/20th the size of my salad.  Don't get me wrong, the salad was good and the salmon, what little portion was there, was also tasty.  Just didn't expect FFB to be so stingy about it.  Either way, the meal, while edible and pretty good, was just average.  If you feel like just shoveling some food in your mouth, or want to go somewhere that's light on crowds, haha, FFB is your place."}
{"text":"A bunch of us out-of-towners went here on a Friday night for dinner and to listen to some music. The food was good but nothing superb that I would come back for. Its difficult after eating gumbo in New Orleans to have it anywhere else. This place has a party atmosphere to it and their drink selection is large. Glad we came here to check it out...did it once, dont have to do it again."}
{"text":"In Cleveland for the weekend at the end of our vacation, our family of 7 ate at Fat Fish on a Friday night on the way to an Indians game.  We arrived to find that the restaurant was hosting a Taylor Hicks show that evening.  Despite the fact that most of the tables were reserved, once we explained that we just wanted to eat and then head to the game we were seated quickly and graciously served.  The food was outstanding.  Crawfish ravioli is easily the tastiest thing we sampled, the fried green tomatoes were quite good, the Alabama shrimp succulent with a delicious sauce.  All our boys enjoyed the mardi gras beads as well as the atmosphere.  Service was brisk but friendly.  
Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I love Fat Fish Blue! The food is original and tasty, the drinks are great, the wait staff friendly, and the entertainment is outstanding! We plan to be there again in January! :)"}
{"text":"Great Jambalaya. Great Gumbo. That's about it. The band we happened to catch that night was absolutely horrendous. Out of tune and barely knew what they were doing. It's also a pain in the butt to have to pay for parking AND the cover charge."}
{"text":"Excellent service and the crab cakes were very good. Free dessert on my birthday, free glass with special drink order.  Be sure to stop by Higbees ( Cleveland tourist center) and get a free $5 coupon."}
{"text":"Went to Fat Fish Blue last night and had a blast. The food was excellent, place was fun, and the staff was friendly. 

We had corn bread (spicy!) and jambalaya for appetizers. Both were delicious. I had ribs with some kind of berry sauce which really had some kicks and very tasty. My friend liked his pull pork as well. 

Definitely will go back. Wanted to try their crawdad and catfish."}
{"text":"The food at Fat Fish is very good especially if you like fish and cajun! At night there is also live music which is a lot of fun! Its a great place to go in Downtown Cleveland!"}
{"text":"Recently I had occasion to spend four days in Cleveland visiting long a long time friend.  I was staying a a nice hotel downtown and the first thing that i noticed about Cleveland was the dearth of good independent restaurants  Being from San Francisco where it's impossible to walk two block in any neighborhood without finding a dozen really good restaurants, I was shocked by seeing mostly chain restaurants in Cleveland.  On my last night I really wanted some good home cooking and did not want to do the \"chain\" thing again.  We stumbled upon Fat Fish Blue.  I could tell immediately from it's appearance that it was a chain restaurant, but i was tired and hungry and I had never eaten there before so we gave it a go.

It was loud....way too loud, but the wait staff was very friendly and helpful and they moved us as far away from the stage as they could and it helped.  I had the Jambalaya appetizer and then the Mac and cheese entree.  The Jambalaya was decent, not great, but not bad either, could have used a lot more spice.  But, the Mac and Cheese was fantastic  This could be the best Mac and cheese I have ever had, it was that good!

Strange as it may sound, this is a chain restaurant I'd like to see come to SF  I would be a regular customer for sure, If for nothing else just for the Mac and cheese."}
{"text":"Well right off the bat I can tell you that you won't see me there every weekend or even once a month but it is a place that you just have to stop into every now and then.  I think FFB is in a 'not-so-good' location based on available parking and foot traffic.  I had to do a little walking around to find it, luckily the weather was good or else I would have just went to Hard Rock.

Anyways....well the food is right up there for you lovers of a little spice.  I've personally tried the boiled crawfish - lots of work for little meat, the jambalaya - tasty, gumbo - little bland for me (add some spice), the delta dip and fried dills - great with beer,  and the Cajun chicken sandwich - spicy but did the trick!  Each time I go back, I am hoping and praying that they will run a alligator meat special of some type or even some frog legs.  I think if they want to go that extra step, they need more then crawfish and blackened seasoning.  Maybe run 'Swamp People' on a constant loop on a TV.

FFB has music all the time, some good, some not so good, but the layout is pretty cool and the bar is huge.  I can't walk by without stopping in for a snack and a beer.  But if its Happy Hour, go to Hyde Park.  I'll review that experience next."}
{"text":"I have heard so much about this place and while we were downtown, decided to drop in for a try. Honestly, I won't be back.  I was disappointed in the selections, the preparations, and the quality of delivery.  From the buzz, you'd think whatever you choose, you'd find delightful.. not so.  The food wasnt' inappropriatly created, it just wasn't good. Lackluster flavor and disapointing preparation.  The menu seems interesting enough, but you don't really get the quality and pizzazz that you are expecting. Overall, kind of bland.  I (and the group I was with) won't be visiting here again.  The servers seemed a bit dicey and unprofessional as well.  Seemed like they could care less.  Oh well. I guess I feel the same now."}
{"text":"Went to Fat Fish in person Thursday night to make a reservation for Friday night.  The greeter said, \"Nah, you won't need one if you come around 7:30 PM.  This place doesn't get busy until 10:00 PM.\"  So we went on our merry way.  Friday, 7:45 PM, I arrive at Fat Fish with my sister and my wife and expect a slow night of live jazz music and dinner.  The place was packed!  The same greeter told us it would be a 45-minute wait to be seated!  He said, \"Do you have a reservation?\"  What a dolt!  We reminded him that he had dissuaded us from making a reservation 24 hours prior.  He didn't even apologize.  He just said, \"Yeah, it will be about 45 minutes, take a number.\"  Minus one star for the carefree greeter, the clueless bartender, and the non-refill-giving server."}
{"text":"Went here with some coworkers for a late dinner.  The drinks and food were both great.  I had the crawfish ravioli - and would recommend it to anyone.  It was quite tasty.  The band playing was pretty good, the girl on the mic sounded like stevie nicks.  Overall, I'd say its a good place to try if you're looking for something out of the daily routine.  It was definately good for a recharge of our batteries in the middle of a long workweek."}
{"text":"On our first night in Cleveland, we had no plans and decided to just start walking and see what looked good so we ended up at Fat Fish Blue, just 2 blocks from our hotel.  It was clean, had a cool looking bar and we were seated right way by a super friendly host.  

I had Parmesan crusted catfish, hush puppies and collard greens and all I can say is that it was really tasty, uncomplicated food that totally hit the spot.  My husband had the Pulled Pork Platter, which was pretty darn tasty but  I don't think the rest of our party was quite as impressed.  Eh...to each his own.

The service was good, maybe a bit too good as we had a hovering server who took our responses to \"how is everything going over here?\" as an invitation to kneel down at our table and carry on a 5 minute conversation, but I guess it's better than being ignored.

I would definitely go back the next time I visit Cleveland."}
{"text":"I visited Fat Fish Blue with co-workers for lunch. I had always sort of passed it by because it's unassuming, at the bottom of a parking garage. We went in and the decor was pretty cool but low-key.  The waiter we had was quick, observant, and very helpful.  We ordered the sweet potato chips and fried green tomatoes for appetizers.  The sweet potato chips were dusted with cinnamon, and they were crispy and good.  The fried green tomatoes were excellent as well.  Most of my fellow co-workers ordered salad, but I had the southern fried chicken.  The chicken breast was tender and seasoned well.  The mashed potatoes that came with it were excellent, as was the cornbread, seemingly made from scratch because I tasted pieces of corn in it.  The cornbread was so sweet and good!  Overall I really enjoyed the experience and I would recommend it to others. I will likely return for more trips."}
{"text":"They have parking, fun place, and nice friendly service.

Buuut the food wasn't good. The only thing it has going for it is the bar and music. The staff was nice, helpful and we were the only table there! Lol the food was cooked fast. The chips and dip, chips with bread was gross it was old. The plates I tried was too much of everything in a bite, I couldn't finish my plate. Chicken to crispy and sauce too much flavor. I guess I'm not used to the flavors. But the second plate I tried was also not as good. That's all. Sorry to say. Maybe it was a off day."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good. I had the crab cakes and my husband ordered the crawfish ravioli and both were good. We ordered the food to go and did have to wait a good bit. Some nights they have a live band so I'm willing to give it a 2nd shot!"}
{"text":"This is a very fun place to go and listen to live music and eat a decent southern meal! I felt like I was in New Orleans with the jambalaya and the fried chicken! The band that played was really good and very entertaining!"}
{"text":"Wow! It was sooo great! Such a good fish, great stuff! Was in Cleveland for a conference and went there for dinner, it is downtown in a very nice location, the atmosphere and the food was just great! And you have a little surprise rolled into your napkin waiting for you! YAY!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went here in 2004 when we had just started dating and didn't like it too much. In retrospect, the reason why we didn't like it had nothing to do with the restaurant itself and everything to do with the fact that we didn't foresee that the band would get loud and we wouldn't be able to hear ourselves talk. Had we asked for a different table away from the stage, we probably woulda loved the place!

We went here on a date last night and had an absolute blast. First of all, the customer service was probably some of the best service that we've had all year long--I think the last time we had service that was this good was on our Carribean cruise in March 2008 or honeymoon in Cozumel in August 2007. For reason unknown to me, they determined that we weren't able to get the seat that we originally were supposed to get and they apologized several times and gave us a free dessert. I have no idea why they did this, but I didn't complain! 

The food was absolutely amazing...I had the shrimp and grits and my wife had the Southern fried chicken. We also had the swamp bake and some type of dessert in a chocolate shell with ice cream, custard, and strawberries inside of it too. All of the food was excellent. The grits went REALLY well with the tomato sauce in which the shrimp was sauteed and there were yummy little bits of Andouille sausage in the sauce as well. My wife had a mixed drink and we were able to keep the glass, which always makes a nice souvenir. 

My glass was always kept full of Diet Coke too, and the waiter was nice enough to notice that I put a lemon in the drink when he refilled it. That's attention to detail, folks!

The band started playing towards the end of our meal, and while they were loud, they were good.However,  I don't want to dwell on the loudness factor because I never want the phrase, \"If It's too loud, you're too old\" to apply to me!

This place is a great asset to the Cleveland culinary scene and I definitely plan on bringing visitors here in the future. I don't think many people that it's such an excellent restaurant--seriously, great food, nice location, and awesome service...what else can ya ask for?"}
