{"text":"Best authentic chinese style cold tofu I can buy. $2 for a small plate of it. I could eat this every day with rice its so spiced well... :) A hole in the wall, with service from mom and pop it seems. :)"}
{"text":"Very authentic Chinese food! Love the taste. Remind me the food back home. It could be spicy for some people. Ask for mild if you can't tolerate."}
{"text":"Find this traditional braised food restaurant  on the Internet. It is very authentic Chinese spicy snacks, also I am very lucky to find not spicy food in this  restaurant at today. Maybe next time, I can bring some didn't love to eat spicy friends to eat braised food in this restaurant."}
{"text":"Really like this place. Very unique outside the box Chinese restaurant.  Really good flavors different menu items and very friendly owners give it a try"}
{"text":"Yum! Very good mala spiciness and numbing sensation. Very friendly and welcoming also. Love the soups! If you want to try something interesting and different from the others who all have the same exact menu, give this a try. Flavors that are all new to me but hard to stop thinking about, and will keep me coming back."}
{"text":"I could not believe what I paid for this nasty food. 
1. The lady charged me for side meat I added to my shrimp won ton before asking me if it was ok. No. It was not okay. It was $8 for .22 lbs. plus 9$ for my won ton. Wft. I have never paid this much for won ton of any taste level, not in San Francisco not in Portland Oregon not in San Diego. Overpriced and tastes bad. 
2. Yes. The taste, it was too salty.  From the soup to the tripe to the beef tendon, all salty. I didn't finish the side dishes bc it couldn't stand how salty it was. 
3.  Size does matter when you're paying over 16$ for a won ton dish. The bowl was 6 inches in diameter and about 4 inches deep. Very small. The pic shows the size. 
4. The service was mediocre and the place was so ordinary. Why did I pay so much? I don't understand why this place has 4 stars. Seriously.  I mean 16$ for .5 lbs of tripe. Not one lb. half a lb only. That's 32$ for one lb. yikes. Misleading and very disappointed with this business."}
{"text":"Over-priced place. Average quality food. Not a good place to go. You can easily spend 30 bucks for one person there."}
{"text":"Food: the food here is super authentic and amazing. I have been here many times and each time, I'm happy with what I ordered. They have me tried the cold spicy edamame, it was super good. I always get hot edamame from other restaurants, but the cold and spicy edamame from Hot Duck is beyond expectation. 
Service: quick service, they took my order right away and I received my delicious food about 5-8 minuets after. 
I would definitely return again and tell all my friends about this awesome place."}
{"text":"This restaurant has five of them in Cali!! They finally made it here in Phoenix! I am so happy to know and eat every three days;) Right now, they have more food than other franchises in Cali, I like the Duck House Rice best!!! It's so yummy and spicy. If you do not want to eat rice, you can just order a whole duck or half duck!! Or other parts of duck! Sosososososo Good!"}
{"text":"Great food, very authentic. Ordered from them couple times and the duck is pretty good. Perfect food for parties and drinking."}
{"text":"This was the worst experience. We ordered two meals, paid $33 after delivery and we barely got any protein. Our dish was 90% broccoli and we ordered beef over rice. A complete rip off and we will never order from here again."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I have seen this place several times while driving down Warner, and always wanted to try it out. It's located right next door to Sushi San in an otherwise pretty barren strip-mall area, so it's not hard to find.

It's a tiny little place, with only three to four tables inside. The decor could best be described as \"Sweet Country Grandma Butterfly Haven\", with one manekineko in a small pot off in a corner. There's a big board in the back with the prices of bulk to-go wares (I guess...??), and a cold-display counter showing off the goods.

The menu is two-sided, with one side for white people and the other for Chinese people. I say that, because (like damned near everywhere else we've been) the waitress expressed utter disbelief when we ordered from the Chinese side. I laughed inside, because this is the first time that my girlfriend (who is Mexican) has seen this in action. I always jokingly tell her that one day I'm going to get a shirt which says in Chinese \"Yes, I eat weird shit like this all the time\". Anyways... we ordered the Dan Dan Noodles, and two rice dishes (one with rib and tripe, the other with ear and tongue), and two teas. After again reassuring the waitress that yes, we genuinely *DO* eat shit like this all of the time, we settled in for our meal.

Our food came out, and it was... fine. It was just fine. This place specialized in offal. In fact, one of the first questions that came to my mind was:  \"Can you actually get duck *meat*?\". You can get duck wings, head, tongue, feet, gizzards, but no breast meat. Same with pork and beef- no actual meat, just the \"other stuff\". Which isn't a problem, and I'm always down for a good offal dish, but I'd imagine that some people would come here looking for some good duck meat and might be put off by the lack of it.

Anyways... our food was fine. Not great, just fine. The meats were tasty but (and God knows how I hate saying this) not as good as many close-by options (which I won't name, but if you read my other reviews you'll see). Each dish had a lump of white rice and a smattering of microwaves peas and carrots, which maybe turned me off more than it should have. The Dan Dan noodles were actually really tasty, and if possible I'd have given half a star for them alone.

All in all, this place is fine, but I think that it's definitely geared more towards Chinese residents who are yearning for a taste of home. Other places with larger (and more diverse) menus will do well in attracting new customers and meeting curious guailos halfway, but I don't see Hot Duck making much of a splash. I noticed several posters on the way out, and I guess this restaurant is a franchise from LA? At any rate, I don't see any reason to return here, unless I'm wanting to bring home a half-pount of duck tongues (which I hear are amazing, but... yeah)."}
{"text":"This place has the authentic Chinese cold dishes. The duck and pig tongue are delicious. I'm so glad I find  this place."}
{"text":"Great Restaurant good food clean inside nice operators, great service. Had the duck tongue and pig tongue it was fantastic! 
will be back again.. ......"}
{"text":"I was eager to try this place based on the recommendation of a friend of a friend.  I have to say I was quite disappointed.  Food was quite spicy (and I can handle spicy food very well) but lack of much flavor and complexity.  The various items looked dry in the display case.  I ordered a few things to try and unfortunately they all taste the same and fail to impress.

Also I feel the food is on the expensive side.  I was shocked to find out that duck tongue is $33.99 for only HALF pound.  That is $68/lb!"}
{"text":"\"You have an impeccable argument if you said that Singapore, Hong Kong, and Tokyo are food capitals. They have a maximum amount of great stuff to eat in the smallest areas.\" ? Anthony Bourdain

But we're in Arizona and not Asia so I guess that quote doesn't apply.  *shrugs*  Anyways, this is a small little eatery.  It seats 15-16 people so I recommend you take it to-go.  All the better though because it seems like every dish is spicy and spicy foods makes me want a beer.  They have a cold dish menu written on a board attached to the wall and a hot foods menu you can browse through.  

Four adults and a kid decided to order a few cold dishes to share and some hot dishes to eat separately.  Since none of us has heard of anything about this chain, it didn't occur to us that \"Hot Duck\" meant hot spicy dishes --- including the duck.  We had ordered the kid a duck and rice plate and it came out spicy.  The seven year-old with us is not a fan of spicy.  That paired with blood still on the duck had us sending it back.  It was too late to make it not spicy but they did cook it up and attempt to wash off a few pieces for the kid but she pushed it away after a few pieces.  She got McDonald's ice cream later though so she was okay.  But seriously, every dish was fire.  For my hot dish, I got the crawfish and rice.  The Yelp pictures made the crawfish look amazing but what was set before me was a tiny serving [look at my picture , dafuq] of frozen crawfish tails.  It was loaded with so much salt that a part of me thinks it was payback for us sending the uncooked duck back.  Bleh.  Everything from the noodle soup to the cold dishes of pig ears, pig tongue, and tofu had the mouth-numbing hot oil.  It wasn't the kind of numbing that comes from spice, it really wasn't that spicy, but something inside literally makes your mouth numb.  It's weird. 

All-in-all, I wouldn't mind stopping in to grab some cold dishes to-go but I don't see myself coming here for anything else."}
