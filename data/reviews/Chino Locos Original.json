{"text":"SUCH good eats.  I just moved into the neighbourhood and after spending an entire day assembling Ikea furniture I couldn't bear the idea of cooking- so I thought I'd try my first takeout from a local place.  The Yelp reviews swayed me and off I went to Chinos Locos.  I had the straight-forward chicken burrito with rice and mild sauce but I was in HEAVEN from the very first bite!  So, so tasty and so much stuff in one burrito!  About halfway through I thought  \"this may be dangerous for my wallet to live nearby...\" but what you get in a burrito for the price?  Worth every freakin' penny!  The place is clearly popular- I've been in there a couple times now and every time there's been a small but steady line of customers in the door.  The food has always rocked and the folks behind the counter are always friendly.  Go forth and eat my friends- well worth the visit!"}
{"text":"I really want to give a higher rating because the food is great, but I've had my Just Eat delivery order cancelled by them twice. It really sucks when you're starving and stuck at work and you find out the burrito you ordered isn't coming. Yesterday I was willing to pay over $18 (including delivery fee, HST, and tip) just for one burrito. I was that desperate for a meal at work that wasn't pizza. But alas, no burrito for me.   Why be on Just Eat at all if you're just going to cancel the orders?"}
{"text":"Amazing hand crafted burritos. Everything made in house and full of great flavours. The rice or noodles option is a nice twist on a classic. Great price and well worth it."}
{"text":"Awesome. Fresh ingredients, great flavour, reasonable price, and the service was warm and friendly. It's my favourite place to get a burrito in the city. Pulled pork is a must and get it with noodles instead of rice!"}
{"text":"OK Kat - you nailed it again. That was the best damn Burrito I've ever tasted!!!!"}
{"text":"Chinese Mexican? That's a first!   Considering the rating and the number of reviews, my boyfriend wanted to try this place (even after we devoured two burgers down the street).   Chino Locos is a little grungy hole-in-the-wall burrito shop with interesting Mexican-inspired decor. It appears to be quite a popular takeout spot for those who live in the neighbourhood. While waiting, we noticed many people had called ahead and placed their orders in advance.  My boyfriend ordered the Fish Burrito. \"Sauteed white basa fish, guacamole, tomatoes, edamame beans, red onions, black beans, cilantro, cheese, sour cream, and chipotle sauce for $6.99\" according to their website. You can order any burrito with chow mein instead of brown rice, but we chose the brown rice just to keep it simple since it was our first visit.  The burrito was filled with a lot of ingredients, but unfortunately, it tasted very bland. The fish lacked seasoning and the whole burrito lacked sauce. There was some guacamole, but there was definitely not enough sour cream and chipotle sauce inside.   The price is great for the generous amount of protein and the size of the burrito, but...it was not as tasty as we had expected."}
{"text":"Pretty good, not something extraordinary but is better than some burrito shops. Will recommend to others but is one time thing for me!"}
{"text":"This is a great spot - you get inventive burritos made with fresh ingredients for a really good price. And, they are quite large, one is definitely enough.  My latest fave is the The Finest fish burrito with chopotle black bean sauce, fantastic flavour. I hope this place survives, and expands, it is really a worthwhile enterprise."}
{"text":"Good burrito Great sense of humor when I asked for shark fin  I was skeptical about a burrito with noodles But was pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery from justeat.ca- the Chicken and the beef burritos with chopsuey. It blew my mind! The hot was spicy but so well balanced. They use scotch bonnets I think, but it's blended so well into the meat and not pockets of mouth fire. Totally recommend eating here. That being said, the delivery time was pretty long."}
{"text":"I'm greedy. I want everything. And Chino Locos provides what I need. Get the best of Mexican, Chinese and MEAT! When I get the cravings, I order the Steak Burrito, mild with noodles. That's good living!   The food is prepared fresh on order, so expect 20 min for it to be done. It's worth it. Viva Chino Locos!!"}
{"text":"Found this place while walking around the area. Had the slow roasted pork burrito, it was AMAZING!!! Worth every penny. Super cool guys working there too"}
{"text":"D'oh, should've ordered Chow Mein noodles instead of rice!!    1) Slow Roasted Pork 7/10  - portion is huge, for the pork, I just wished there were more sauce, there was heat near the end (as I have requested extra hot), also wish there were more guacamole.  2) Jerk Chicken 7.5/10  - portion is huge as well!  Again, not juicy enough, and more guac again...  Total Score:  72  I will be back when I am in the neighborhood to try with CHOS MEIN!!!!  Our fav burrito is still burrito boyz's shrimp burrito extra hot!"}
{"text":"Another really tasty burrito spot! Quality ingredients, large portions, what's not to like? I had a fish burrito with rice. Helpful and friendly staff too."}
{"text":"This is my first review!  I had to make an account because this place deserves to be praised! One of my go to spots for great fresh food at an amazing price.  Let me tell you first that it takes a little longer than usual for them to make their burritos because they make everything fresh! It takes 10-12 mins depending on what you're getting but well worth the wait.  Secondly, they pack it good. It's a BIG burrito, they make it in front of your eyes so just look at how much goes into each of them while you're waiting. I'm surprised my burritos don't rip.  Third, the flavor!..i get the steak burrito with everything no spice with noodles on white. It's awesome! Everything goes together so well! My wife/friends tell me I don't know what I'm missing not having the spice so I'm sure if you can take the heat, it's good  Finally, the price...$6.99!?!? Seriously? If you can find another place in the city that serves food as fresh, filling AND flavorful for that price, tell me about it cause I wanna know."}
{"text":"I'll definitely be back to this location. The burrito-fad brought along some sub-par contenders, but Chino Locos delivered a delicious, nutritious meal to my belly. My wife had the Sweeet burrito - slow roasted pork - and loved it. I ate Da Finest - sauteed whitefish - and was in burrito heaven. I ordered ahead and it was ready when I arrived about 10 mins later. When I got home about 5 mins later the burrito showed NO signs of sogginess or dripping sauces. I often get burritos that are leaking or falling apart from other places, but was really surprised to see how well it was packaged. Lots of flavour from the ingredients - the fish was SO GOOD...nice texture, fresh, perfect. Nice and warm. Packed full of beans, chow mein noodles of all things, other veggies, cheese...and so on. GO TRY IT TODAY."}
{"text":"So, I am not one of the people out there who has drank the burrito kool aid. i find the outbreak ( yes, outbreak, like a blight or a disease) of burrito joints a bit stupid, as its all the same slop wrapped up and pretty dull. I understand the irony, as i am such a huge burger fan, and really, lets compare the spread of both of these across the city.  but I digress, Chino loco really changes my mind. i think its almost unfair to lump them in with all the others, like comparing my beloved Queen Marg. to pizza pizza really. chino loco does it all right, fresh toppings, and tasty, not overcooked and sloppy meats, and the option for noodles. bless them. the church location is a bit bigger, but, i think i like the Leslieville location just a bit more.  the combination of asian and mexican flavors thats so hot in Cali right now, and i am surprised hasn't been imitated by all the other burrito hacks out there.  now if only they upped the game, and went a bit wilder with the asian stuff, i would be there weekly.   yum. yum. yum,"}
{"text":"Chino Locos definitely deserves all five of these stars. The service is quick, to the point, and the portions are huge and delicious. I have NEVER been disappointed with a burrito from here. The only down-side to this place was that it isn't very accessible, so getting up the front steps was tricky with a stroller (but one of the guys behind the counter helped me out). I have yet to try the noodles, but I'll get there. There's also a tiny parking lot at the side of the building, which makes pick-up a breeze."}
{"text":"This really is as good as it gets.  I am a long-time devotee of the Houses of Banditos / Boyz, but the crown has now been passed to Chino Locos.  Simply put, these are the best burritos in the city. The flavours, ingredients, quantity, and service are all superlative.   You simply must try the Basa White Fish with noodles - it is divine! I'd caution the burrito novice to go easy on the hot sauce - it does tend to concentrate in pockets that can blow your socks off.   With only a few seats, you wouldn't want to count on a place to sit inside, so have a take-away plan B available.  Super friendly staff, and amazing value when stacked up against the Chipotle and the other chain burrito houses.  The only question left is how often I can get over there on a weekly basis..."}
{"text":"4 or 5 years ago Burrito Boyz woke us up to the potential of a burrito done well.  So powerful was this awakening that I started searching for burrito references in every city I visited, including Burrito Mecca, San Francisco.  We held our own thanks to the Boyz back in those days.  Unfortunately, times changed, as did the quality level of the Burritos that the Boyz had to offer.  My BPW, (Burritos per Week) average went from 3, to 0.01.    I'm happy to say having visited Chino Locos last week that the BPW is on track for a recovery this year.  Since Friday, we are on our way back up to 2, at least within the next month or so.  This could get higher over the summer months.  I had the fish burrito, with chow mein noodles, spicy.  Loved it.  The fish was delicate, and took on the flavour of the sauce it was simmered in.  Chow mein noodles were a nice change from the usual rice filling.  Spiciness was, um, spicy.    I heard while I was there that Chino Locos does a special burrito every week or two.  Last week's special was the General Tao's Chicken burrito.  If there were any more of those that day, I may well have had two burritos.    Suffice to say, the BPW is on track for a remarkable recovery this year thanks to these guys.  Great Job!"}
{"text":"Love the food, can't get enough. My favorite is the biggie bean with a mix of Noddles and rice. And the best part is that they are right in front of a bus stop."}
{"text":"Chino Locos makes a wicked burrito.   Have visited the original location at Greenwood & Queen, its tiny so beware that its much better to take out than eat in. Staff are amazing, very nice and welcoming and were more than happy to answer any questions that we had.   Chino Locos does an interesting spin in the burrito, there is an asian influence in a sense that you can add chow main noodles instead of rice as well as edamane beans.  I have had to two different options at Chino Locos: the Baja Fish Burrito as well as the Chicken Tinga Burrito. The clear winner was the fish burrito, its now my go-to item on their menu.The fish is battered and then stuffed into either a whole wheat or white shell with guacamole, tomatoes, edamane, rice, red onion, black beans, green pepper, cilantro, shredded cheese, sour cream & your choice of salsa/sauces. To die for.  Their ingredients are super fresh and made in house, including their delicious array of salsas and sauces. I love spicy food so always go for the hot sauce."}
{"text":"Stopped by this place by chance, hoped for something good seeing the reviews, but it was the same old Toronto Mexican. Tasted like cardboard with cheddar cheese on it. Plastic bags of pre-shredded cheese, chicken was mucky and had no flavour."}
{"text":"I first became of a fan of Chino Locos when I lived by the Church St. location.  Have since moved to Leslieville so Greenwood is my new go-to.  This place does not disappoint.  They do one thing (well I've seen tacos on the menu) and they do it right.  Their burritos are fresh, massive and delicious.  I always opt for the rice but its only a matter of time before I sample the chow mein.  Incredibly friendly staff - I've even called once from the other end of the city 15 minutes before closing to order some dinner - I was told not to rush and that my food would be waiting for me when I got there!  Professional and courteous yet laid back and relaxed.  Good value.  My only complaint is they close too early!  A must-try."}
{"text":"What a fabulous 'hidden gem', recently discovered!   Great 'twists' on burritos, packed full of fresh,  flavorful ingredients at very reasonable prices.  Super for vegetarians also, and you can get a 'Bento box' version as well.  Very tasty for sure...  Seems really busy at peak hrs./dinner time, (at least the night we went), but very friendly and accomodating owners/staff, but be prepared to pack your patience if need be!  It's well worth the wait though, or call ahead and take out if poss.  Really glad we stumbled across this place, almost too close to home though, lol.  I'm afraid I'll be tempted to go back too much and often!  Live long and prosper Locos :)"}
{"text":"Okay. Was at Chino Locos for my second time on Canada Day. The first was the night of Summerlust this past Thursday. I feel like a food critic. Hitting a place twice before reviewing. Both times I took in the monthly special. Chinos offers a specialty burrito every month. Last month was Jerk Chicken. This month is Chung Pao.   Great little spot which is more of a grab and run type of spot. I always end up eating the burrito as I walk around Leslieville. Warning though: As good as the Burittos are, they are definately very messy so don't forget to grab some napkins and leave some space inbetween your Burrito and clothes.   FIrst time I was at Chinos I got the guided how to from the staff who instantly identified I was a newby. Very helpful as I really didn't have a clue. Noodles or Rice?? Hmmmm. Made it easy on myself by ordering the special Jerk Chicken. Thanked them and was on my way. One guy said see you tomorrow as I left. Damn. Is that a little cockey: After tasting the burrito I now know why. Truth be known as I was back 3 days later for the Chung Pao special (july's burrito) on Canada Day. Asked what the Chung Pao special to the staff. Their response was \"It's Good\". How can I argue with that. Ordered it and was on my way again. Fantastic. Easily my fav spot for picking up some fast food in Leslieville."}
{"text":"Mmmmmm not a bad thing to say about this place. Strictly takeout, and I wished I lived closer so that it was hotter by the time I got home to wolf down the yummy goodness. Veg, fish, beef, chicken all good. Call ahead to order it's can be super busy"}
{"text":"The place is small but the space was used very efficiently. In a strange way, it reminded me of a ship gallery when I first entered the place  As the name implies, this is a Fusion Burritos Place  \"East meet Burritios in Leslieville\".  Service was friendly and efficient. Although it was my first time there, they greeted me like a regular.  Judging from the many clients that was greeted by their first name, there were lots of regulars.  I picked the special, a steak burritos and was very happy with my choice.  I was able to customize the with rice or noodle - I choose noodle and was very happy with the twist.    The portion were huge, and not just will fillers like the noodle. There were lots of tasty morsel of meats and I was initially taken back by how much the thing weighted.    Can't wait to go back for my next burritos fix."}
{"text":"Saw my nutritionist the other day, she said more legumes!  Tried the biggie bean mild with whole wheat and noodles.  Awesome and healthy.  Good goin guys.  Still would like more of an Asian variant though."}
{"text":"Dare I say that I didn't really like this place? I biked from the Danforth just to give this place a shot but was not blown away by any means. I got the bean burrito and my main complaint is that it tasted bland, like it needed a pinch of salt and the taste would have dramatically improved. Also, I'm pretty sure the burrito was to include cheese and there was none. :(  I cannot say that I won't give this place another shot, but it had better be worth pumping up greenwood in my work clothes."}
{"text":"I just LOVE Chino Locos! It was recommended to me by a former colleague and it was one of the best pieces of advice I've ever received!   For those who don't know, Chino Locos offer a compact, yet wholly satisfying menu of take-out Mexican food, with the option of adding Chow Mein noodles to any burrito. Yes, I thought this was strange at first, too - but it actually works, with the noodles adding a completely different texture to the standard burrito recipe. (Overall, though, I still prefer the traditional rice option.)   The portions are incredibly generous for the price and will keep you full for ages. Ingredients are fresh and prepared right in front of you by knowledgeable and friendly staff, who encourage customisation and deviation from their suggested recipes.   I've recently learned that they've opened a new location on Gerrard & Broadview, which saves me the trek all the way to Greenwood whenever I want a fix. Woohoo! I look forward to trying their new spot.     Best burrito I've had in Canada, by a long stretch."}
{"text":"I like this spot! Very original take on burritos and the food is good. The place is tight though and hot in the summer."}
{"text":"I almost never wrote reviews here or elsewhere. This one needed to be written.   This is really one of the best places to eat in the entire city. They're opening a new location at the corner of Gerrard and Broadview in two weeks. It's going to be a massive success.   So what's so great? It's just a burrito, right?  No. It's anything but the classic Mission-style burrito, made popular in San Francisco then Los Angeles. These guys make you a meal, put it in a really great burrito wrap, grill it, then you're good to go.   All of the varieties are amazing. I'm a regular at the Greenwood location and have never had anything that wasn't just right on. My personal favorites are the fish and, when they make it, the General Tsao's.   As someone who loves really spicy food (REALLY), their extra hot green sauce is not only fiery, it's a huge flavor punch. My own tip: I always get several extra containers of it, and make a homemade aioli with other spices and mayo which I use all week. It's that good.   Best of all, these are genuinely nice people. They do this out of a love for food, which comes across as truly authentic.    Nothing but a huge win here. Always.   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"These burritos are bursting with flavour. Some people say they are smaller than normal but my guess is they have a skewed perception of normal. It is a battle to finish one of these, but it's a battle I can and do win often.   The hot option I'd proper hot, the guacamole is deliciously garlicky, and the edamame and noodles are a natural fit in these burritos. Fish is my favourite, but you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"I've lost count of how many times I've been to Chino's. I always get the pollo loco with the chow mein filling. It's always a good burrito, and always just large enough that I can barely finish it. I would travel across town for this burrito in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"This place is good for a full stomach! It's got quality ingredients and sauces and bread are also good. Had one of the vege bean burrito's and it was great. The place is very small though so but it has a lot of interesting stuff on the walls and if there's a leafs game on then you can enjoy that with the food! Great first experience."}
{"text":"I tried the new location twice.  First the chicken, bland.  Second the pulled pork, again bland.  I had no clue a burrito could be bland!   What I figure is I always get mild.  Perhaps you have to be a hot and spicy lover to enjoy these burritos."}
{"text":"One of the tastiest burrito joints in Toronto if not Canada. All the burritos are tasty and very good. I especially love the specials that can be jerk chicken, general toa and BBQ shrimp. The mix of Asian flavours in a texmex delivery system was quite inventive. The two cons I have is that the spice of the burritos is not consistent and with these guys making a big deal out of it I stopped venturing to medium and stick with mild. Some days it's plain old mold and other times is pushing medium. The other issue I have is one of owners simply does not smile and has an attitude as if he doing me a favour of being there. He needs to loosen up and smile,i am looking at you Minh La.  Definitely a place to try and keep returning to."}
{"text":"I am not really one for Burritos. I know that sounds suspect, but I never really got into them. That being said, the Burritos at Chino Locos are ridiculous. Un real, and have completely turned me into daydreaming about burritos and running down Queen towards Greenwood on a regular basis. There is a location on church as well, which i reviewed here http://www.yelp.ca/biz/chino-locos-toronto-2#hrid:G4lYzYC0uv6G14kmMYhmyQ but I prefer this location - for some reason it just tastes better.   It in tiny, really only seats 3 and is better for takeout. Sitting at the bar you can chat with the super friendly upbeat staff and watch them prepare everything from fresh ingredients. The best is the daily special which is always changing.   I've tried the  Biggie Bean, the Vegan and the White Fish but the Basa White Fish with Chow Mein made spicy is literally off-the-hook - they are right about that. It is unique, tasty and incredible and not at all what you would expect.  by far the best burrito I have ever eaten. soo ooooo good. Get the fish with chow mein, I am serious."}
{"text":"Pretty decent and fast. The chow mein is unique, but a must-try at least once. Live a little!"}
{"text":"Just had my first experience at Chino Locos, and I was really pleased. I use to live downtown and was a regular at Burrito Boyz, and I am very happy to have found a great burrito place close of home (The Beach). I'm not going to compare Chino Locos to Burrito Boyz as I only ordered the halibut burrito at Burrito Boyz, and I've only had the steak \"off da hook\" burrito at Chino Locos. The steak burrito was really good. The noodles and the Asian influence was a cool twist. The Chino Locos burrito definitely seemed healthier than most burritos I've had. The sauces were flavorful and didn't drown the rest of the ingredients. I will definitely be back . The parking in the back is handy for take-out orders. It's a pretty small area inside with only a few seats, so most of my future visits will likely be take-out."}
{"text":"I dont know what the fuss is all about. The food was ok. I find it rude and pretentious to have signs saying \"NO REFUNDS\" for orders that are too hot to eat. Don't bully the customer. Why not just have a heat meter and just TALK to customers about the spice. Don't take it out on us just cause you won't change your recipe. The staff was checked out. The heavy set dude was rude but nice. Maybe it was just a bad day. I hate to write bad reviews but I just wasn't impressed. I might try it one more time. If you take that sign down."}
{"text":"I have been going to Chino Locos fairly regularly since they opened a few years back. I have had really good burritos and terrible burritos there, but as it is my local, I have always kept going back.   The ridiculous inconsistency has caused me to avoid it at this point. From a simple thing like the size (half the time it is hefty...the other what I would term a \"small\"  to not paying attention to ingredient requests (I asked for no hot sauce) I simply refuse to spend $10 (I always tip the change) not knowing if I am there on \"Good\" burrito day. Rather than expand, perhaps they should consider regaining some consistency to the original store.   Will SOMEONE...ANYONE....open another burrito joint in Leslieville please!!"}
{"text":"Best burrito in Toronto.  I love the steak burrito with noodles and spicy.    The jerk chicken burrito is a regular special and also amazing when available."}
{"text":"I have to admit, the only reason I found out about this place was through the show \"You Gotta Eat Here\".    I was already in the Leslieville area, so I thought it would be a perfect time to check this place out.  \"Crazy Chinese\" is located at the bottom end of Greenwood Avenue and Queen Street East.  The surrounding area is unfortunately sandwiched in between the gentrification project that is Leslieville and the pretentious \"The Beach\", and it doesn't look like it belongs in either of those neighbourhoods.  It actually looks like it's in somewhat of a ghetto!!  But if you judge this place by its \"cover\", you'd be selling yourself short, because these guys know how to put together a great meal.  Although I went at 6:30 on a Saturday, there were not many people ahead of me, which was fortuitous, since the place is CRAMPED.  No, even more cramped than what you just thought!!  Apparently, many customers just call in their order, wait an average of about 25-30 minutes, then come by for the pickup.  When I ordered, there were four employees there, all busy putting together the various orders.  It's all borderline hectic, and even the decor (such as it is) is haphazard at best, although I do love the Luchidor masks (See if you can recognize Nacho Libre's!!).  I went for the Rib-eye steak burrito, sans cilantro (I HATE cilantro), and with egg noodles!!!  You can choose rice, but where else are you going to get a burrito with Chinese egg noodles!!??  You can basically choose what you want inside it, and also what type of sauce (i.e. heat) you want - ranging from none at all to HOT.  I chose the hottest sauce they had.  They slap everything together and put it under a panini grill before they wrap it up in all its goodness.  The burrito was fantastic!!  The egg noodles worked surprisingly well with all then other ingredients.  The hot sauce was tasty, but was not as hot as it was described on their website.  I've had traditional burritos from Mexican-owned establishments, so I had something to compare the Chino Locos version with.  I came to the conclusion that a Chino Locos burrito is not \"better\", per se.  It's just a different animal altogether.  I'll gladly have my fill of both types please!!"}
{"text":"I work around the corner--Averaging two Chino Locos per week.  Eat Here.  Great Food, Great Staff, Great Masks."}
{"text":"And I thought that Chexican was a joke from a commercial.  Here at Chino Locos it is a truth!  I had the Basa fish with chow mein Burrito.  I normally like the chow mein a little crunchier so, I did have to take a star off for that.  But what a brilliant invention chow mein in a burrito!  The basa fish was delish.  I was dreaming of fish tacos, this is the next best thing!    I'm not sure that I can handle all the other inventions, but I would think that the pork is definitely the next one to try.  Can't wait to get back to it."}
{"text":"Not having sampled the wares of Chino Locos since November's Elite event, I stopped by for a long-weekend burrito when an old friend mentioned he'd be paying a visit.  I had never been to this location before (the Elite event was at their Church street pad), and got a bit of a surprise when I walked in and just about hit the back wall two steps later.  It's small, for sure.  Other than the open grill area, there's a small counter and a few stools lined up along it.  Other than that, there are four (count 'em, four) walls and two doors that can barely swing open at the same time.  It goes without saying that this is basically a take-out stand.  Thankfully, Greenwood Park is just up the road and it was a beautiful day.  I'm always on the lookout for something I haven't tried before.  The jerk chicken burrito was on special, and realizing I might not be able to get one next time I visited I indulged.  I don't think they're home made, but the tortillas at Chino Locos might be the best I've had - they have tremendous elasticity without being at all chewy.  This fact went a long way to contain the massive portion I was given; while I could see the soft shell bulging in places, no filling escaped and the wrath of my jaws was delivered to every last morsel.   The filling itself was mouthwatering and most of the way through it still had me diving in for another bite before I had swallowed the last.  Hints of cilantro and fresh beans complemented the rice nicely, and while I finished full, I didn't feel like I had eaten the usual share of grease and fat one finds in a burrito.  I'll say again what I've said before - burritos are better grilled.  There's nothing worse than a burrito that starts falling apart on the first bite because it's lost all structural integrity.  Chino Locos uses a ridged grill which avoids charring the shell but still delivers the kind of rigidity that is essential to a slop-free burrito experience.  Overall, I enjoyed my second Chino Locos experience but I note two minor setbacks.  Although the place is small, I probably would have felt comfortable dining in but for the newspapers and menu holders that littered every available inch of counter space.  These guys need to make better use of what space they have.  The other small disappointment was with spice levels.  While different schools of thought exist on what \"medium\" means in reference to heat levels, I think most would agree that a medium-spicy jerk should deliver more than a tickle.  Crank up the heat, boys!  I was fence-sitting between three and four stars on this one.  At the end of the day, they've got a great concept and the burrito I had was delicious and easy to devour.  Four stars."}
{"text":"The most delicious burritos I have ever had. Great options like fish, Kung Pao chicken, Veg. So tasty. If you don't feel like the burrito wrap, they offer a bento box version of all items. About $7 to $8. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"Got the \"off the hook\" which you would think would be fish but it was rib eye steak .. Cool , if only it was rib eye steak . I asked for spicy and it has some kick to it but nothing I would consider spicy .. Plus it had 2 chunks of beef in it so I paid 7 dollars for everything but the protein I asked for .. On the whole very disappointing ."}
{"text":"It's about time that Asian/Mexican fusion joints started popping up north of the border. This is a great newcomer to Toronto's overly saturated burrito scene: the Asian influence coupled with solid ingredients and prep make it well worth a visit."}
{"text":"I wouldn't have discovered this place if it weren't for yelp. It's a hole in the wall, very tiny and mainly just for take out. The prices are reasonable considering how big the burritos are. I got the Pollo Loco with rice and it was delicious. I really like how the chicken pieces were small and blended in with all the other ingredients. This made me get a little of everything in each bite. I ordered the medium and it was a good amount of spice. Next time I look forward to trying some of their more asian-inspiried burritos."}
{"text":"Not what I hoped it would be. Dry meat and less flavourful then I had imagined. Had the pulled pork burrito with noodles. 5/10"}
{"text":"\"Follow your instincts little sparrow,\"  said the wise old man but being a fool I listened to another scribe  and ordered my pork  burrito mild.  First, I thought perhaps my taste buds had somehow failed me but  my companion Likeaphenomena concurred.  She ordered her burrito medium and it failed to earn even a ding on the heat registry.  Seek the heat, I now say.  And remember, if you have a sixth sense, use it."}
{"text":"Darn delicious, extremely friendly and I can't wait to go back. The barrito varitions are very unique. This place is far better than burrito bandits or whatever the heck it's called up the road."}
{"text":"Really good if slightly greasy food, ate here a lot because so little else in area and I get really tired of it.  Standing there, the place is tiny and crowded. The air is a little greasy and the vibe is depressing after repeat visits. It's just a bare-bones hardcore takeout joint where you can see them work the woks, not a cool fun place to hang, and they have their own Asian spin on some very good or at least decent Burritos. Pulled pork best because of scallion sauce. Daily specials might be a minor ham-fisted disaster but good for them to take chances."}
{"text":"(insert overplayed latin beat) ...Once you've had a taste of it you'll never be the same; Yeah, it'll make you go insane.  Upside, inside out I'm luvin los Chino Locos!  OMFG.  A burrito stuffed full of delicious toppings and chow mein?!  Now's that what I call creative asian fusion cuisine!  I had \"Da Finest \"($6.99 +taxes).  Sauteed basa fish, guacamole, beans, and noodles with fun burrito fixins in a whole wheat wrap.  With weekly specials posted on their website, you can try something exciting and different each week!  I'm hooked. I want a Chinese burrito every week. In fact, I want one right now!!!  And you know what else is awesome??? The Mexican wrestler masks they have around the restaurant.  You can't help but think of Nacho Libre.  I wonder if they hold fights when the restaurant closes.  It's a small venue, with limited seating but they do have  a parking lot out back.  If they were giving out free burritos to wrestlers, I'd be there.  Hands off my Chinos Locos burrito!"}
{"text":"My absolute favourite burrito in Toronto!! I always order my Biggie Bean with chow mein noodles-so good. The burritos are massive. The staff is always friendly and the food is always fresh and delicious. Unfortunately I no longer live in Toronto but I always crave their burritos and have to stop in for a fix when I come back to the city. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Fair price for one of the best burritos Toronto has to offer. The place is tiny and a bit sticky, but you only spend 5-10 minutes in there thinking about your burrito. That perfect burrito with delicious chicken, rice and noodles, guacamole that is excellent, rice, beans, veggies, sour cream, cheese, salsa....get in my belly! By the time you are done day dreaming about your delicious burrito, your name is called!"}
{"text":"YUM!  Every bite of my burrito followed a \"mmmm\".  My boyfriend and I came to Toronto to visit from Boston, and having at least 3 favorite burrito spots in our city we had to check this out.    I got chicken, my boyfriend got pork.  They were very friendly and patient.  They offered us many different choices for our burritos.  It looked like they stir fried the meat with the rice and veggies- something I've never had before.  They were so amazing and delicious, I seriously don't know what could have made this any better."}
{"text":"We've returned here a couple times, and I continued to test myself with the Biggie Bean (guacamole, tomatoes, edamame beans, red onions, black beans, green peppers, cilantro, cheese, sour cream, chipotle sauce).  It had A LOT of beans.  This time I opted for the \"vegan\" (Pressed tofu, eggplant, shitake mushrooms, glass noodles, guacamole, tomatoes, edamame beans, red onions, black beans, green peppers, cilantro, chipotle sauce, rustic rice), with added cheese and sour cream (no long vegan) and I found it much better, hence the star upgrade.  Less beans = 1 more star!"}
{"text":"Novel burrito choices. You have a choice of chow mein or rice for your burrito. I tried the pork and fish one and they were both very good. The price is a bit high but you get pretty big portions. There is particularly little to no seating space available. It is better for take out."}
{"text":"I used to love Chino Locos burritos, but the past three times they have been strangely bland.  I figured the first time was a fluke, but after two more bland burritos I probably won't go back. Not sure what happened. :("}
{"text":"Went back a second time and the black beans were seriously undercooked. They felt like tiny little rocks as I bit into my burrito. There was also excessive sauce, causing the whole burrito to be a drippy, soggy mess and the tortilla to fall apart."}
{"text":"After hearing RAVE reviews for Chino Locos and checking out the website to realize they really are Loco, I ordered up a fish burrito from my friend who was getting take-out.  What showed up was the Vegan special with glass noodles??? and tofu in a burrito? Turns out, they were out of fish and out of steak this particular night.  The vegan burrito weighed something close the weight of a small child. It has cute little grill marks like it was flame-broiled!  Taste is where I have to disagree with all the 5 star reviews. The tofu was fairly bland, all the other vegetables were OK, but every third bite was an explosion of hot salsa that didn't seem to go with the rest of the ingredients.  If I have a rolled up tortilla, I expect some basic flavour profiles that were intentionally not there from Chino Locos. I just don't think throwing glass noodles, edemame and eggplant (?) in a tortilla is a burrito. I would happily go back to taste the fish burrito. I've heard it's 5 star worthy."}
{"text":"Damn good burritos and the guys are great! We've been going there pretty much weekly since they opened. Give Victor and Minh your love!"}
{"text":"Been here twice now, and I can't seem to like it.  I really wanna like this place - the masked Mexican fighters, so cool, the idea of mixing Mexican and Asian, you'd think it's a hit.  Obviously I'm in the minority here, but I just found the burrito overstuffed with rice and the noodles inside are still cold.  It's not like I just gave it 1 shot...I returned a 2nd time.    Maybe I'm just spoiled by Burrito Boyz."}
{"text":"a friend from work brought these in to the office over a year ago (maybe it was 2?) when chino locos just started up and where perfecting their menu items.... and it was pretty effin good. now that i know other yelpers are digging it and is on the map... i'm heading over this week!"}
{"text":"I've probably eaten here more than 200 times. It's a unique and delicious burrito that you won't be disappointed by."}
{"text":"Came here to grab a bite during the week.   Pros: - Very professional and polite staff - Fairly quick service   Cons: - Prices are fairly steep for wars offered. $10.15 for a burrito (tax in) is quite a bit compared to other burrito places."}
{"text":"I live close by to Chino Locos, so from time to time I would drop by to grab a bite on one of their burritos  The Pros - Friendly and welcoming staff  - Great portions - Simple Chinese and Mexican fusion.  Burritos with egg noodles just simply amazing - Excellent food just under $8, $10 for the specials - Highly recommend the Basa fish burrito   The Con: - Biggest problem to me is one of the server, believe his name is Steven, which happens to be the only staff that I encounter to be rude, sloppy and just plain unprofessional. This happened to me twice, I placed an order with him, the staff makes it and hands it to him, he completely forgets about it and just leave it on the table until one of the other staff happen to notice it and hands it to me Not to mention, not once has he asked me if I want a bag with my burrito takeout, unlike the rest of the staff.   4 stars.  Cheap, good eat, unfortunately they got 1 bad egg in the basket"}
{"text":"They are trying something new here and it works well: tasty, cheap and healthy too! It probably won't ever become a destination spot for west enders, but the neighbourhood is very lucky to have it."}
{"text":"My second burrito ever and therefore the jury is still out while I sample the various places. This place scored a few points for its selections such as noodles or rice, and I like that they only have one size and a limited selection, not to varied and more focused.  Hard to find busy little place, has lots of character.  I would go back again for sure but looking forward to trying more places."}
{"text":"I was so excited to come here, having read the reviews. But I have to say it was quite disappointing. The service was lovely - the guys were nice and quick. Otherwise I would've given it this one star. The food made me sick within an hour. I'm not sure if it was the noodles or the puller pork but something was off definitely. Also the burrito comprised of 70% which is disappointing as well. And the optional toppings were sparse (example beans, guacamole). I'm a big fan of burrito boys and other Mexican places in the city - sadly this is not one of them."}
{"text":"Mmmm this place is really good. Hidden and you have to go upstairs. I tried their house special but had to substitute some things because I'm doing the 4 hour body diet. But it still tasted very good and very fresh!  It actually took a bit of time to make but was well worth it. The joint is clean with a nice layout. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I work in the area and heard good things about this place so I decided to give it a try since I love burritos. The place itself is tiny. There are no tables and its jammed with restaurant supplies so you can't really move around much. It seemed pretty clean but the clutter really gives you the feeling that it is not a well organized business. While waiting for my order I had a chance to sit back and watch the staff at work. The guy taking the orders on the phone, who I assume to be the owner, has an interesting personality to say the least. His demeanour with customers and people on the phone placing orders is not very professional. What I found the most offensive was that his pants were hanging below his butt. When I'm out to get something to eat that's the last thing I want to see, especially when it's the person preparing my food. None the less the burrito was pretty good but not sure if I'll be back."}
{"text":"I am generally not a fan of burritos and I was skeptical, indeed, of an asian/mexican fusion burrito. However, I was pleasantly surprised! They were big, tasty and offered a selection of rice, noodles etc.. chicken, or steak. To my surprise, the fusion of flavours was quite good. I might go back if I was in the neighbourhood and really hungry for a burrito."}
{"text":"Chino Locos tried this place earlier on the day as i write this.  The portions are fair and the quality is great. Order is around 12 to 15 mins worth the wait for sure. tried the Rib-eye Steak is \"Off Da Hook\" burrito with the chow-mein and let me tell you it's so good! i will for sure come back to this place!"}
{"text":"I don't understand what the whole rave is about. If burritos were like this nobody would ever eat them. There are so many other places in the city which are much much better! Chipotle or makes much better burritos. So does Burrito Boys and big fat bastard burrito.  Pretty much any other burrito place trumps this hole in the wall."}
{"text":"Awesomeness in a burrito. Always tasty, exquisite ingredients those burritos are awesome. If your hungry and want something that taste really good just go there! You won't be disappointed by the size because there is plenty of food and flavor enjoy!"}
{"text":"Chino Locos is an interesting concept, good burritos are rare in the east end, and the staff (and possibly owners) are very friendly.  They offer chow mein as a option instead of rice, which I find interesting and tasty.  They're not afraid of a reasonable kick if you ask for hot, which I appreciate.  I find that they throw in so many things that no one flavor really stands out.  This also means that their signature flavors don't really stand out from one another.   This is too bad, because they make the options sound interesting and exciting, but then I order one, take it home, and it's good, but it doesn't really taste that different from previous orders.  That said, I enjoy them, I'll be happy to eat there again.  The guys are friendly, chatty.  The service is good.  The place is pretty small, but if you don't need a seat, or you're ok with a very cozy seat, that's not a real problem.  Basically a solid place to go for a good burrito."}
{"text":"If you have not yet experienced the incredible tastes of Chino Locos burritos, stop everything and go; go now! A little, unassuming place at the corner of Greenwood and Queen (on Greenwood), stepping inside is like stepping into your oldest friends kitchen...   The open concept kitchen has a no frills approach, but the place is the warmest and most inviting little restaurant I have been in. The owners, Johnnie, Minh, and Victor are quite possibly the funniest and most talkative crew I have met, and with the counter top and grill so close together, you can't escape their conversation, laughter and warm spirit.    They show you exactly how your burrito is made and cooked, and are very happy to share the ingenious recipes and ideas that sprouted into this awesome venture. Chino Locos (Crazy Chinese) opened in November 2008, and they are already very busy and becoming a staple in the Greenwood/Queen community. Business is good and its no wonder: these burritos are fantastic! They aren't your classic, everyday burritos; they are so much more.   Infused with Asian accents, such as chow mein noodles, edamame soy beans and rich, sweet sauces to accent, Chino Locos is truly a unique experience. I almost went to heaven after eating the 'Off da Hook' burrito; rib eye steak with black bean sauce...it was to die for! The burritos all come with a choice of a protein (chicken, pork, beef) and rice or noodles, and you can get them loaded with all the fixings: beans, cilantro, edamame, tomato, etc...They also have a wicked vegan option and dessert burritos...I know, I can't even fathom...    The atmosphere of Chino Locos is so apparently parallel to the fun and friendly personalities of the staff who own it and work there. They sport the soccer jerseys as make shift uniforms, citing that keeping it comfortable and multiculturally sound is super important. The guys want Chino Locos to be a place that welcomes everyone and caters to anyone, and it most certainly does.    They even do catering on the side; business lunches and the like, about $10 a head, you can't beat the price for these incredible eats!   You must check out Chino Locos!"}
{"text":"Gluten-free review:  This place is known for their burritos but they also offer their burritos as tacos with corn tortillas, which is great for their gluten-free customers. I not only have a gluten intolerance but I'm also allergic to avocados (it sucks, I know) so I get my tacos without guacomole. My go-to is the rib-eye steak tacos with no guac, and their serving of steak is quite generous. Some of their tacos are not gluten-free though because of the soy sauce, so make sure you check with them first.   They're very accommodating to my allergies and pretty much know me by name now. I had one encounter where they forgot to omit the guac. I called in, came back and they replaced my tacos. Now whenever I go back they remember the incident and double and triple check to make sure there is no guac on my tacos.   The location is very small though (3 seats at the window) and they prepare everything in the same area, so if you have celiac's disease this won't be ideal due to potential cross-contamination. My sensitivity isn't very severe so I don't get a reaction from the tacos.   In terms of cost there is no price difference to get tacos instead of the burritos. Depending on whether you get a drink it's about $10-15 per person including tax.   Tip: Call ahead so you don't have to wait long. When they're really busy the wait can be 20 minutes."}
{"text":"Este lugar está seriamente loca-lah! ¿Alguna vez has querido Chexican-ma? Es un lugar pequeño con la realidad no hay donde sentarse, así que prepárate para tener que ir. Es como si caminamos en el sótano de su hijo adolescente de.  Burritos con el chow-mein. En esencia esa es la base. Me encantó la carne de cerdo cocido lento, pero no era el mayor fan de la burito pescado. Yo prefiero Burrito Boy  Burrito de pescado un poco más.  Con todo, este lugar era una locura!"}
{"text":"Chino Locos - translates into Crazy Chinese.  Are we crazy?  I guess the media would like you to think so with stories of onlookers ignoring an infant that was run over by a van, with some of the things we eat (chicken feet?) etcetera.  Well the owners at Chino Locos have taken crazy in a positive direction with their spin on burritos made with chow mein?  Yeah - they went there!  I am a loyal fan of Burrito Boyz - but Chino Locos put my loyalty to the test.  Without fail, whenever I'm chomping on a burrito you better believe it that I'm gettin' me one of them halibut bad boys!  But today, since I would be experimenting with a chow mein burrito I thought, what the heck - a rib eye burrito it shall be!  Plus isn't it usually one of the more expensive cuts of steak you can get at a restaurant?  The burrito was properly named as \"Off the Hook\" - other ideas could've been Om-nom-God, Yummy in my Tummy etcetera.  The beef was charred perfectly, and was tender and bursting with pure beef flavour.  The chow mein was different, but in a good way.  For next time, I will probably take the heat down a notch, as I got spicy and it kind of drowned out any other taste of the ingredients (guac, sour cream, etcetera).   Verdict:  I left Chino Locos completely torn - like Bella Swan from the infamous Twilight books is torn between her love for Jacob and Edward.  I think I have to have 2 favourites now for my burrito fix (sorry Burrito Boyz - hope that polygamous relationships work for you!).  My one beef is the food handling.  The cashier who handled money, didn't put on gloves before handling food.  I was a bit put off by it, but heat kills everything right?!  The usual Jumex sodas are available.  I got the Guanabana flavour - its absolutely divine!  I've tried others (pineapple, guava etcetera) and this is one of the better ones.  This place is more for takeout as there isn't much seating.  Their mascot dons a wrestling mask, and the theme is further perpetuated while on location with their television playing wrestling matches."}
{"text":"Nice small joint with a couple of seats inside facing the window, so mainly a takeout place. I enjoyed my burrito but I wish there was more options. This restaurant has a very limited menu but that must mean they make them very well. The staff was really nice as well. Street parking nearby on Greenwood."}
{"text":"You know, I thought Burrito Boyz was good.... I was already impressed when I brought it back to my office and picked it up, and it was HEAVY. I mean, like at least 2 lbs.  I was also impressed by how the thing did not fall apart while I was eating it.   Okay, really - CHOW MIEN instead of rice in your burrito?!?! It wasn't crunchy, but definitely a chance of pace. Also TONS of toppings that you don't need to pay extra for, including guac, cheese, sour cream, red onion, green peppers, edemame beans, black beans, cilantro and chipotle sauce.  $6.99 you can get steak, pork, fish (wow looks yummy), chicken with all I mentioned above, rice or noodles.  $7.99 there is a VEGAN option that looks also equally amazing.   Honestly, after stuffing your face, it all tastes the same, except for the texture.   I just finished it in my office, and now time for a nap!"}
{"text":"Fantasticly delicious! Always fresh, great service and we'll worth the wait!  Make sure to order early, especially on the weekends, they are usually jam packed.   Ask about the daily specials, and don't go overboard on the hot sauce. Somedays the hot sauce will bring tears to your eyes, while other times it is much more tolerable."}
{"text":"Excellent! Only one downside: very very small counter for dining in, seats max 2 people   Now for the good:  We had the rib eye steak burritos (one with rice and one with noodles)  Ask for it with no chipotle and extra spicy sauce for a kick   Love that they use high quality rib eye steak, cooked perfectly + fresh tomatoes and cheese   Incredibly tasty - would make a special trip into this area to eat again"}
{"text":"We first ate here a few years ago. This is our second back since then. We had fond memories of General Tso's chicken and noodles in a burrito. Unfortunately, it's not available anymore. Our burritos were still good and the BBQ shrimp in mine tasted great."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Whenever I'm craving burritos only Chino Loco's will do. And I can't even imagine burritos without chow mien inside of it now. You have to try this place you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Went here for a quick after dinner snack...  Always wanted to try it. Got the pulled pork. Plenty. Spicy. Awesome...eh.  Would go again but nothing to write home about ."}
{"text":"Had the basa fish burrito and it wasn't bad I did enjoy it. The only thing is that it just seemed so ordinary. I wanted it to taste better but it was simply ordinary. Will go back sometime eventually."}
{"text":"Saw this on yelp and heard from friends it's a must try. I was not disappointed! My goodness the service is excellent and friendly (at least the dude that helped me).   I got the jerk chicken burrito with chow mein instead of rice with all the toppings, including guac and edamame.  So good! It was filling, the jerk chicken isn't the best jerk I've had but it was still  tasty.   The Mexican cola I got was also out of this world.. Lots of cane sugar but always nice to treat yo'self.   There is not much seating. I think for two St the window. It's mainly a take out spot and very small inside. I recommend preparing to take the food elsewhere to a bench!   Would definitely go back and try the general tao chicken burrito. Heck even the vegan burrito sounds delicious from the menu.   Just go!"}
{"text":"All I'm gonna say is DELICiOuS! It's a burrito so there's not much to write about here. If you love tex mex food, this place has a cool flair on that. Appreveche! (ENJOY;)"}
{"text":"Yum! Original burrito concept with a bit of Asian flare. One of our go-to's on nights when we lack food inspiration. Ask about their special of the week. Sometimes filling is general tao or jerk chicken. Reliable and tasty but beware, the hot sauce is really hot!"}
{"text":"what the hell was that! chow mein in my burrito? yep...it was pretty awesome. had to try it. had the kung pao special...man the meat was done so well. ingreadients were pretty great. i just cant give it 5 stars because im too loyal to all the great burritos in the mission in SF. its just a tad touch down from my favoreite spots. super unique though...i also had to step a star down because when i walked in the owner was kinda talking down to one of his staff, i then asked him a question and got a condescending vibe too...weird. maybe hes just like that. the dude working who took my order was great...chicago bulls guy...very passionate about the place he worked at even though he got chewed out. much respect."}
{"text":"Although they don't provide for \"traditional\" or \"authentic\" burritos..  as Toronto's self appointed Burrito Connoisseur...DAMN these guys make a mean burrito!  I have to say that everything about these guys are so damned cool.  Victor, one of the co-founders is an exceptionally rare, client focused businessman.  Everything about this dude oozes rock solid belief in the burritos he makes.  From their mould-breaking chow-mein based burritos to their weekly specials.. I always look forward to visiting these guys and what they have in store for their specials.  Drop by and have a try!  I think they have two locations now, in addition to their Leslieville one, in \"The Village\"."}
{"text":"This place introduced me to chow mein noodles in burritos  Went there a year ago....and that was all she wrote  Went there two weeks ago and ordered take out for myself and my friends  I ordered the rib eye steak  Amazing  My friends ordered the basa fish and the pulled pork and they enjoyed theirs as well  One thing I can say is that the burritos are fresh tasting  Keep that going..... Definitely identifies for your burrito!!!!  Definitely will go back when we are in the area"}
{"text":"So, I missed something here...mainly flavor.  I was  really confused because the ratings for this place are solid.  The two guys running the place were nice and seemed to be working their butts off. But I can't get over the fact that my pulled pork burrito with noodles tasted like nothing, absolutely nothing.  I didn't have Mexican or Asian flavors.  I took a bite and had to stare at the burrito to remember what I was eating.  I was disappointed and gave up after the second bite."}
{"text":"Fish Burrito - Yum!  I've been meaning to put up a review since this is my neighbourhood joint but I keep forgetting to do so.  As all the reviews indicate ... chow mien killer of all your traditional rice burritos. Listen for all y'all who are too afraid to venture the rice is still there but if you're trying to be healthy, the owner has vowed that the chow mien is healthier and heck it tastes muy better.  I always get the fish but I've had their chicken and steak and the occasional special, the swimming wonders of the world still taste the best to me.  The owner is fantabulouso and will remember your name and the crazy Mexican wrestling decor makes your short wait entertaining. If you're impatient call ahead and pick up the burrito ... just don't bring your dog like I usually do ... they love burritos as much as you do and that burrito might not make it home in tact."}
{"text":"Nothing bad to say about this place.  Food is awesome. Employees are fantastic. I am one happy repeat customer."}
{"text":"Definitely order Fish burrito with chow mein - spicy (no cilantro). Sometimes I order and they forget to not add cilantro and it ruins my life so I have to dock a star for having had my last 2 orders with mistakes (since there's no space to eat inside I don't find out until I'm back home and then it's too late and I can't eat it :(.  But the burritos are so good I keep coming back and just praying there is no cilantro this time. I had one tonight and it was legit so I'm already dreaming about back tomorrow."}
{"text":"I love Chino Locos.  I don't give out 5 stars easily - the guys at Chino Locos deserve it.  I've been here quite a few times, and my burrito is great pretty much every time.  They have a few unique items, including noodles as an option instead of rice and both a vegetarian and vegan burrito.   Vegans take note - I'm not Vegan, but that burrito is so delicious that I've actually ordered it rather than a meat burrito in the past.  They nail the texture and flavour - I think it's the shiitake mushrooms.  A few tips: - If you can deal with the toppings, I recommend you just order your burrito with the works. - The medium has a bit of kick, so be careful with the spice level.  My GF who has no spice tolerance even finds the mild spicy (I don't).  - Try the noodles at least once, especially if you're ordering the fish or vegan options.  It's a small place, so you'll probably grab and go rather than hang out and eat inside.  Parking is readily available both on the street and behind the building on Greenwood.  Writing this review has given me a Chino Locos craving.  I'll be making another visit this week!"}
{"text":"Would it be hyperbole to say their burritos beckon you mere minutes after finishing them?   If you're iffy on the chow mein hybrid go with the tri-rice combo. It's a rare burrito that makes you feel healthy after eating it. Stuffed with edamame beans and black turtle beans as well as avocado and tomato and cilantro and everything else that's amazing... these guys have created a fantastic product that is seriously filling but also freakin' delicious. If anyone doubts me, put it side by side with the kensington Big Fat Burrito as a comparison and Chino Locos will come out on top.  Just aproach with an open mind and call your order ahead 10 minutes and you'll be fine!   Also, try the fish burrito with extra chipotle! Awesome!"}
{"text":"Felt like a burrito and heard chinos had a great twist to it. If you have read my other reviews I love twists on original cuisine.  I usually order the special and this time it was the boneless rib.  You can decide to add rice or noodles which is the Asian twist they put in the burrito, I think they put edamame beans too which I love!  I've been back and it has been just as good the other times."}
{"text":"Totally late to the game. This place was sooo good. Had the steak chow mein burrito. So different and delicious! It gets messy but what good burrito doesn't. Wish this place had some seats but it does make a good take out restaurant. Will be back again soon!"}
{"text":"There comes a time in a Yelper's life where one wonders, 'Why on earth haven't I reviewed this place yet?' and I have that thought now about Chinos Locos.   These 'Crazy Chinese' owners have stolen my heart through their delicious AZN take on the burrito. Seriously, Chow-freaking-Mein instead of rice and hunger-pang inducing grilled basa fish. I vehemently stand-by ordering 15 minutes in advance, because no one wants to watch them tauntingly grill, sizzle and fry in your presence. It's a cruel tease.   Also, suck it, Chipotle. These guys also offer tortillas in whole wheat and include guacamole. You don't.   My burrito of choice? Da Finest, $6.99. (From website: Sauteed white basa fish, guacamole, tomatoes, edamame beans, red onions, black beans, green peppers, cilantro, cheese, sour cream, chipotle sauce)"}
{"text":"This place is great!  Have been here a few times....I've had the pork which is tasty - but today I had the fish with noodles...YUMMY!  A must have!"}
{"text":"When I first heard about this place from a friend, I was like \"What?! Crazy Chinese people cooking up Mexican food?\". Let me tell you, it's AWESOME!!!  I'm a fan of all types of cuisines, but if I could, I would put guacamole in EVERYTHING... well maybe with a few exceptions. Boy was I happy somebody came up with guacamole + Chinese food *drool*  It's cheap, portions are huge (I eat a lot by the way)!  I went to the location near Queen St. East, so the only place to sit was at the back, outside by the parking lot. It looks like a whole in the wall (literally), but boy do they have awesome selection of dishes and beverages.  I can't wait to go back!!!"}
{"text":"Oh Chino Locos (from here on = CL) .... my good friend lived literally next to it and I was ready to move in just to make these sweet dudes my neighbours. It's very small inside - I don't think I have ever seen anyone eating INSIDE, just waiting on their burrito.   The most amazing thing about CL  is that they can put noodles in the burritos instead of rice...I don't know what genius thought of this idea but HAIL ALL THINGS NOODLE. It's delightful, fun and different.  My favorite choice here is the fish - it's marinaded in special sauce (I don't care what the secret recipe is, just gimmi gimmi moaarrr) and it's always fresh.   I always got mild because the spicy was HELLA spicy and I just cannot afford another burn-hole in my stomach. If you enjoy a kick - this is the flavour for you, dear friend.  The staff here is great, they're talkative, funny, sweet and very helpful. The prices are great, never paid more than $7 for a burrito and it's always loaded (I don't ask for extras).   GO HERE!!! If you're ever strolling around the beaches area and happen to get hungry, take a walk to Greenwood and submerge yourself  into the wonderful world of Chino Locos....   Livin el Chino Loco xoxo"}
{"text":"Ah the stuff of art.  Picasso once said, \"Mmmmm, that's tasty.\" or more likely it was \"Mmmmmm, eso es sabroso.\"  Well my friends, Chino Locos is so locos he's making burritos and tacos with asian staples such as chow mein, edamame beans, slow roast bbq pork and his own green onion ginger sauce.  Theyve also filled them with many healthier and tastier choices like a brown, red and black rice combo instead of a fried rice, black turtle beans versus refried, and great veggies like watercress, cilantro, eggplant and others.  I could list the whole menu probably because if my eyes governed my stomach id have had one of each kind and then have made my own kind.  that's right folks!  the days of make your own pizza, make your own salad, make your own halloween costume have been blown out of the water because now, at chino locos you can make your own burrito or taco.  pick one or make one for 5.99.  now is that locos or is that locos?  I cant stop talking...so get this:  when was the last time you tried a dessert burrito?  anyone?  what say you close your eyes and imagine a tangy, gooey bite of a PUMPKIN & BLUEBERRY BURRITO!!!!!!!!!!!!  I didnt actually witness this but i did witness Minh (the co-owner with his partner Victor) hypnotize an already hypnotized locos groupie (some great kid who lives upstairs and feels completely at ease hanging around wearing a token sombrero) with an apple pie burrito.  All homemade.  (Like his chipotle, of which, unabashedly, I had second helpings.)  Look for new menu items to come as the owners, like any artists worth their weight in jalapenos, are sculpting that menu until its perfect.  But i personally think that thats not possible.  Because its already perfect.  ole, as it were and watch out because this restaurant will be the first of many."}
{"text":"This place has now moved to Gerrard/Broadview, but it's worth the trip.  Fantastic, filling and so delicious.  Great prices and they don't skimp on size.  One of these lasts me two meals.  Great place for a quick bite to eat while you're on the go."}
{"text":"Very bland. The meat lacks any flavour. Good portion size but I ended up throwing most of it away because it was just awful. Kind of a waste of perfectly good pork. Tastes like its just cooked in water and then they hope thier overly spicy but completely flavourless salsa will cover it up.   Avoid."}
{"text":"Chinese and Mexican burritos? I was skeptical to say the least but the concept already sounds delicious. As it dawned upon me, I realized there can be so many incredible combinations from the clash of these two cultures and I just can't wait to try it.  They delivered on this concept very well for the most part. This was a very delicious flavour and texture experience. Every bite you take you get a bit of earthiness from the beans, creaminess from the avocado and to freshen that up you get some lime juice, tomatoes, onions and fresh herbs. Then you get hit from the saltiness of the soy and spiciness of the peppers and round it off with some noodles for a slight chew at the end. I have long thought that burritos were textually lacking but the noodles really take it to the next level.  All in all the food was great but the biggest letdown perhaps is having my burrito lukewarm and even cold for certain spots. Also, their selection is quite limited considering both cultures have so much to offer in terms of food. So I'll deduct a star but definitely this place is a must try."}
{"text":"Id be giving this a 1, if it weren't for the Baja fish burrito which tasted much better than the steak. What can I say about this place, allot of people to get it to go (No room to sit), I had their steak burrito which I dont know, seemed to missing something. Seasoning? Sourcream? Maybe the steak itself? But I got to try a couple of bites of the Baja fish and it was great.   Biggest problem about this place was the service at the cash. The guy is so rude. Needs to tone it down with both the customers and his cooks."}
{"text":"Love their fish burritos with their chow mein inside. Limited seating so you should plan on doing take out. Good price too"}
{"text":"Best and probably only Asian burrito in Toronto.  I have tried the burritos both ways, with rice and with noodles and have to say, I'm a fan of the noodles.  I have eaten there twice so far, the first time I tried the chicken, the second time I tried the vegan burrito.  Both are incredibly filling as the burritos from Chino Locos are stuffed to the max with fresh ingredients.   I end up only making it through half.  Best thing to do is sit at the tiny bar (that seats two people), grab a limonata, chit chat with the owner and savour the goodness that is Chino Locos"}
{"text":"Absolutely perfect jerk chicken burrito, again. With rice, whole wheat wrap and extra hot. Been the absolute best take out (or eat-in!!) food in Leslieville since the very start. Of Chinos I mean."}
{"text":"I've seen this place quite a few times but never came in.. and today I had some time to kill around lunch and I'm really glad I tried it.. Although I shoulda read the reviews first and thought more about the chow mein option.. next time.. Had the jerk chicken special, works, extra hot.. it was. Jarritos Mexican Cola was pretty good too. Service is so friendly here. Music is pretty mixed - I heard Stairway to Heaven, with Miley Cyrus after, followed by some Mexican tune, then something that almost sounded like Enya. Only 2 seats though so mostly takeout. Really enjoyable vibe while waiting for my car repair. I'll be back."}
{"text":"I *really* wanted to love this place because 1) it's in my hood and 2) I've heard great things. Also, it seemed like the owners (or one of the owners) was working and they were very friendly all around. I'd be willing to go back and try a meat burrito as the bean and cheese was a huge disappointment.  Too much rice and both the rice and the beans were hard. Not enough toppings inside, not well distributed and definitely not enough cheese.  Hate to say it but Burrito Boyz bean and cheese wins it by a mile.  The rice is kept to a minimum and the toppings are well mixed inside the finished burrito. Please Chinos Locos - fix this! I want a tasty bean and cheese burrito in the 'hood."}
{"text":"I've reviewed the Church St. location, but the location on Greenwood deserves it's own review for   A) opening up it's doors for us a full 35 minutes after close, because we thought they were still on summer hours. B) not being douches about doing so. C) the jerk chicken burrito that was on as a weekly special  #1 Desert Island Fast Food Joint, with a bullet."}
{"text":"Just alright, the noodles instead of rice doesn't make a difference. I still prefer burrito boys for a fast burrito joint."}
{"text":"Went here for a quick dinner. Burritos are fairly priced, service was fast and friendly as well. We got one chicken and one steak. Both mild, but still quite spicy. The burritos were a decent size and all the ingredients were very fresh, however, there is really nothing that special about adding noodles to a burrito. It's a cool idea, but rice is still the way to go."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place after reading the reviews. Was not disappointed. Huge portions and a bit of a long wait. They will take phone orders over the walk ins. So call ahead to order!  Tried the burrito with rice but will be back to try the noodle version!!"}
{"text":"You guys like Mexican? You like Chinese food? Do you like burritos that communicate with you telepathically? Well, do I have a Asian fusion burrito place for you. This place.  Had the fish burrito last time I was here and it was great. Didn't talk or have any emotions but still tasted real good.This time I ordered the jerk chicken special burrito with chow mien noodles and things got interesting.  As I was eating it the burrito started to speak to me inside my mind. Saying things like \"good eh?\" and \"yeah bud.\" It was like eating my best friend who was also a hockey coach. Weird thing is, I wasn't freaked out. Felt so normal. He said his name was Jeremy and that he'd see my on the other side (poo out my butt) and boy he was NOT wrong. Haha  Great burritos. Ask for the talking one. Tell 'em Jeremy sent you."}
{"text":"My first visit was pretty lame. The burrito sucked. This time, it was Jerk-Chicken night and the burrito was very good. I'd def hit this place up again, the boycott is over! Nice one Locos!"}
{"text":"One of my fave burrito place in Toronto.  Chino Locco first opened at this location and have a second location at Broadview/Gerrard.  This location is not great for dining in as there are very limited seats, however, is great for take-out.  What makes this burrito place unique is that you can have chow mein noodles alone or with rice in your burrito.  The price is comparable to other burrito restaurants. I definitely recommend this place if you're in the area."}
{"text":"I've been here quite a few times before and I am definitely a fan... so much so that I am very tempted to give a perfect 5!!  My most recent visit about a week ago, I brought someone who has never been here before for a quick pick-up and go meal.  I told him it was Mexican AAAANNNDD Chinese AAANNNDD Burritos!! How can you go wrong?! They have 6 main burritos all priced at $6.99, and then sometimes 1 or 2 featured items such as Kung Pao chicken and.or general tao chicken.  Their regulars include; fish, rib eye, bean, vegan, chicken, and roast pork.  Each one is also filled with your choice of rice or chow mein and  your preference of spice and other toppings.  Unfortunately, there is only a seat along the window to eat, and barely any waiting space when it's busy.    Da Finest! Fish Burrito: $6.99 (4/5 stars) I got it mild with chow mein, but it still had a little kick to it from the sauce. The delicate fish flavour was slightly overwhelmed by the array of other flavours exploding... but who cares?! It was good anyway!!  Ribeye Steak is Off Da Hook: $6.99(4/5 stars) Medium spiced with chow mein... oh me oh myyyy!! A juicy bite into the savoury beef, followed by a kick of tartness from some crazy sauce, then the spice hits you, but it's all mellowed out by the sweetness of who-knows-what!  Yea, I'm lost for words to describe these burritos... can you tell?  Service: 5/5 These guys are awesome!! Everything from scratch, plus you really taste AND hear the care they put into the food.  The open kitchen allows me to listen to the dude calling out orders and ensuring quality.    I will continue to come here!  I only wish they served some sides and had more seating!!  It will definitely make them a 5-star joint!!  Any of you burrito lovers out there reading this, you gotta check this place out!"}
{"text":"I had the pulled pork burrito with noodles and the works. I actually found that there too many ingredients in the hard to eat burrito. And the flavours didn't seem to compliment each other. I would try again but would reduce the items on it so that the various tastes don't get lost. Cheap price and filling though!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing food! Always swing by this place when I'm working in the area. Fair priced, especially for such heavy and filling burritos. Have always gotten all toppings, with noodles and medium spicyness. Its quite spicy which is nice (depending on who makes it. Sometimes its pretty mild, while other times its pretty hot).   In my opinion, the best burritos are the BBQ Shrimp (Fridays only), Jerk chicken, and the Boneless Rib. The Basa fish is quite mild in flavour, but is still VERY good. Would definitely  recommend this place!"}
{"text":"The burritos are good, no doubt. Service is generally solid.  The original/Greenwood location is a bit shabby, dirty with boxes piled everywhere. It's not a \"sit and eat.\" This location is perfect for a shabby, crummy old diner scene in  a movie. The fridge is covered with banknotes from around the world, and there is interesting \"decor\" throughout the place. It has a bar where people once sat and ate; it's covered in boxes and newspapers now. If you're a hoarder, this place is a dream come true.  Last time I went, their credit card machine was down. They didn't tell me this when I called in my order. While I was standing there, I overheard one of the cooks tell another cook \"It's been down all afternoon.\" When I walked up, I was told I had to go to the ATM around the corner, because \"our credit card machine just broke down a few minutes ago.\"  The ATM next door was also broken down, so without credit/debit payment, I only had $15.00 for a $22.00 burrito order (two burritos).   At least the store accepted my $15.00 for the order saying \"It's better than tossing the burritos, but dude, it's not our fault the machine went down.\"  Perhaps not, but it *is* your fault for not sharing this info with me when I phoned in my order, and for not having had it fixed after \"all day.\"   The new location at Broadview is a \"real\" restaurant. it's clean, and just as friendly. Somehow, it lacks the kitsch of the Greenwood.  I eat here at least every two weeks, FWIW."}
{"text":"A burrito with a twist of flavour - would you like rice or noodles with that?  They offer four types of burritos: pulled pork, chicken, fish and steak, each for $6.99, and loaded with ingredients. When I saw loaded, I mean it's packed like it's about to burst. I do not recommend eating this thing without at least 5 napkins. I used 10 all together. My steak burrito was delicious.   They also recently put up smokey boneless and skinless BBQ chicken on the menu for $8.99 for a limited time.   Note: this a takeout place, no seating inside except for two stools by the window. Everything made fresh to order so be prepared to wait about 10 minutes for your order. A LOT of regulars here and I can see why :)"}
{"text":"Add another glowing review to the pile!  I had gone rather lukewarm on burritos as of late, but Chino Locos has reignited my passion for the torpedoes of flavour.  My biggest beef with most burrito places has been the weird science that seems to go on once all the components are wrapped within the tortilla.  What was once several distinct ingredients come together in a witches brew of mush and blah that I just don't care for.  Chino Locos, however, is delicious and avoids this altogether.  Allow me to break it down for you.  I got the slow roast pork and the meat itself had a very good flavour, like a 5 spice (or so I guess) that definitely over came the blah I usually get from burrito meat -- or worse the gristle, bone, or cartilage that can be so common in burrito meats.  Spice-wise, I went medium spice, and it was a decent level that built but never became just ridiculous or relied on mounds of jalapenos that always end up on the ground after I'm crying like a teenage girl at a Beiber concert.  The beans were a mix of a few bean types and weren't fried, so it avoided the mush factor I so often associate with refried beans.  Finally, I opted for the rice, and I think that may have saved it over the chow mein noddles. I appreciate the innovation of the noodles, but I think the burrito would have ended up in that mush category had I gone that route.  I'll give it a shot next though now that I'm confident the place makes a solid burrito.  I wish I could give the place 5 stars, but my pork was a little over done.  It was still delicious though.  After a couple more visits if the quality is still up there, I'll bump to a 5."}
{"text":"What is all the fuss about? Went here with high expectations from all the great reviews. Ordered 2 burritos and split with my wife. One chicken and one ribeye. Tried one with the noodles. FLAVORLESS. They literally tasted like nothing.  Not impressed."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised at the combination of Mexican and Chinese ingredients in a burrito, but you know what? It works!!! It was really good, better than Burrito Boyz. I had the steak burrito and it was amazing! Highly recommend this place!!!"}
{"text":"I typically get pulled pork Burritos wherever I go and this is simply the best I've had, and I've been to Burrito Boyz and Fat Bastard and all those other joints.  My wife had the Kung Pao Chicken special Burrito (yep, you read that right) and said \"I won't be able to eat Burritos anywhere else now\".  The price is more than fair and the Burrito was massive.  Definitely try the noodles over the rice, it works really well.  Lots of flavour and just the right kick, which they let you choose.  Get ready to get messy though, definitely a juicy Burrito.  We ate in but usually you're going to want to do take-out, it's a small place with only two seats.  Don't be fooled by the lack of physical line up when you go, lots of people call their orders in ahead.  We waited about 15 mins for our order due to all the pick-ups.    $22 for two very big, creative and yummy Burritos and two Blood Orange San Pellegrino's.   Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Been here a few times... I have a weakness for the jerk chicken and the chili chicken burritos.. full of flavor and tons of meat!!  I highly recommend.. you are the man Vic!!"}
{"text":"As far as burritos go, I'm more or less a traditionalist.  I realise that noodles like rice is a carb, but no, I do not want them in my burrito, thanks!  Anyway, I was in the area and wanted some cheap eats, so Chino Locos came up.  This original take-out location is literally a hole in the wall.  There are a coupla stools + a counter, but I think they're intended more for people who are waiting for their orders.  Let's just say that it wouldn't be that nice of a dine-in experience.  Since I thought my bf would be sharing with me, I got a Biggie Bean - $6.99+taxes, veg, non-spicy :(.  Usually I'd get a med-hot spicy, meat or at least fish/shrimp option.  Result:  Good flavours, but bland.  How could this be possible?  Barely any guac.  Tip:  If you don't hafta, steer clear from this veg option.  l'd try this joint again, but wouldn't drive out of the way!"}
{"text":"Chow mein in a burrito??!!  Brilliant!  On the recommendation of a co-worker, I tried Chino Locos for the first time today. Perhaps the most creative and yummy burrito I have had in a loooooong time.   The pork was very good. The special \"chicken adobo\" was awesome.   The 3-man crew on duty were personable and helpful with recommendations for a C.L. virgin like me."}
{"text":"Fantastic noodle filled burrito. Great portions, sauce, and protein options. Be sure to order ahead because there always seems to be a line"}
{"text":"Unique place due to their infusion of Asian food influences in their burritos. Definitely worth a try (you can order chow mein in your burrito); however, places like \"big fat burrito\" and burrito boyz have tastier burritos. I ordered the daily special, jerk chicken burrito with rice. The jerk chicken was piping hot but the rice was cold (like they just took it out of the fridge). Rice didn't have any flavour and was a bit undercooked.   Would've given better review if they cooked their rice better (needs to be more flavourful and fully cooked is a must) and gave a more generous portion of meat."}
{"text":"At first glance walking into this place I almost didn't order. It was so cluttered with supplies out in the open. After a second glance I quickly realized that this place is working in the smallest place imaginable with no basement. Glancing into a very organized and clean fridge got me even more comfortable ordering. Great value burrito with fresh ingredients."}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a second chance (don't remember why I didn't like it the first time) choice well made! I had the chicken burrito with noodles and it was delicious!! Loved the combination and the spice was mouth watering! Yummy!! Will definitely be eating more of these as a regular!!"}
{"text":"I was excited to try Chino Locos because a few friends had raved about it.   My friend and I paid an impromptu visit to the Greenwood and Queen location. There were about three customers on a Sunday afternoon. Whenever I visit a new place, I like to try their classics and Chino's said that their was the pulled pork burrito. So pulled pork it was. They also advised (as per their site of 15 + rules of ordering) to get the works on it. So the works I got. My friend got the Chicken bento box (which really isn't a bento box but the ingredients of the burrito separated in a styrofoam container without the tortilla).    A note: there are about 3 seats in the joint; it's strictly a take-out kind of place and they don't do delivery. We ended up going to the Film Buff down the street to sit on the bench and eat.   Unfortunately, I was really disappointed with the flavour of the pulled pork. There was none! Added to the fact that there were too many ingredients in the burrito that overpowered the pork.  The chicken had a mild flavour.  Luckily, I paid 75 cents extra for sour cream to clean my palate. As I started fishing through the burrito I noticed the \"guac\" was a hard unripe avocado at the bottom. Yuck!    That said, it seems that basta fish is what they're known for and I'm curious to see how the burrito tastes with chow mein noodles instead of rice.   Hopefully, it won't be as disappointing as this visit."}
{"text":"Awesome, my first 5 star review.  Been there a few times, the burritos are just damm delicious.  Its a little expensive, but the burrito is packed with meat.  So its like 2 burritos in one, for the price, its not too bad.  I usually order the shredded chicken, and its packed with shredded chicken, they don't skimp on you.  It taste good along with the other toppings in the burrito.  Putting the burrito in a panini press melts the cheese and makes the burrito taste much better.  They offer the burrito with rice or noodles.  I tried the noodles, it was good, but i preferred the classic burrito more.  Give this place a try.  I guess I have been eating taco bell for too many years to know what a real burrito is suppose to taste like.  update: i recently went to taco bell and ordered a chicken burrito supreme, it was so small and lacked any chicken, i was shocked."}
{"text":"Good food with very friendly service. I would recommend!"}
{"text":"A super laid- back and casual place, no seating, so it's good for takeout or a picnic. Really good pulled pork burrito and vegan bento. Great flavors, and the veggies and salsa tasted super-fresh. Guacamole was included, and a nice change from the usual surcharge! Not the fastest, but worth the 10 min wait. Next time I will call in the order ahead."}
{"text":"Man, these guys know how to prepare a tasy-finger-lickin-good burrito. The place is pretty crammed, meant primarily for take-out type orders. I'd put these guys on the same level with Burrito Boyz. They take about 10-12 minutes to make your burrito when they're busy, but it's worth it. If you're driving by, you owe it to yourself to stop by and try one of their burritos. You won't regret ;)"}
{"text":"Very large burrito with all the fixings (including Chow Mein noodles, which is interesting) at a moderate price. Super small place, has a \"hole in the wall\" feel. The owner gave us a little of Chinese restaurants to try in the city, and it was an enjoyable experience to chat with such a passionate, down-to-earth foodie."}
{"text":"Pretty good I got the basa burrito big chunks of fish which is good, I had more expectations for the noodles they didn't taste like much. But overall a good burrito just like burrito boys"}
{"text":"This place rocks. Great staff, great food, great price. For under $10, you just can't get a better meal - especially in Leslieville. Sometimes you eat a burrito and it's good but you have that, \"What have I done?\" feeling. Not this place. Great food and that tastes great and that makes you feel great. So go get an awesome burrito (with rice see below), enjoy meeting hard working, nice people. Then give this shop an appropriate  5 stars.   There seems to be some griping about getting the noodles in the burrito which seems to be pulling this place from the 5 stars that it should have to the four it currently has. So, I am just spit balling here to those who complained about the noodles, don't get the noodles."}
{"text":"Another great burrito place in Toronto.  What sets these guys apart is their non-traditional ingredients.  I would never have thought to put chowmein in a burrito but once you taste it you're left asking yourself why you hadn't thought  of it.  Everything is fresh and made to order.  The only down side about these guys is the time it can take for them to make your burrito.  Best-off calling ahead like I do so you don't have to wait."}
{"text":"Been going here for years. The food is still the same and still GOOD.  You can't go wrong with what you choose.  The noodles are a nice touch to a burrito that we all get use too.   If you haven't had a chance to go, GO and see the difference."}
{"text":"Specials Thanks for Roma to take me here! Really I would never know what I have been missing ...and the burritos at Chino Locos still fit right in with the rest of my Asian food spots review!  The staffs here for sure are nice and friendly... and their burritos are one of the best I have... ok not because it is stuffed with chow mein.. personally I don't eat chow mein at a Chinese restaurant ever.. but when it is stuffed inside my burrito.. it is so so so good!  The fish is sauteed when we placed our order...no deep fried batter shit! At least I can pretend I am so healthy with the whole wheat wrap.. and making it extra spicy does make it so good tasting! And having it custom made does make it so personal!  We all finished our burritos recording speed! Now I always have cravings and daydream about this particular Chino Locos!  They accepts Visa and Mastercard!"}
{"text":"Perfection!  I ordered yesterday what seemed to be the pinnacle of deliciousness.  I ordered the boneless rib burrito with rice and mild sauce.  It was perfection.  Funny thing though .. I was just coming off of a nasty flu bug after 5 days and feeling ok enough to eat something .. I swear, this burrito cured what ailed me.  :)"}
{"text":"Where do I begin! Whether it's the daily special or straight from the menu, it's always so delicious!! I've been to Chino's a few times and it always gets better and better!"}
{"text":"I usually have to write a review _immediately_ post-food/drink because otherwise I forget all the details and end up with feedback that reads like: \"yum, yea, whatever I had was good, I'm pretty sure\".  NOT SO FOR CHINO LOCOS.  I think of that dang burrito in detail everyday since consumption.  The spot at 4 Greenwood is tiny, and we rolled up on a Friday night not long before close at 9PM.  The options are simple: here are the burritos on offer, here are some possible sides, here is a cooler of drinks.    Done and done: I needed no more options because I had one burrito and one burrito only on my mind: the white basa fish with guacamole, tomatoes, edamame beans, black beans, cilantro, cheese, and some other gear.    With the option to have it on either white or whole wheat tortilla, the real game changer for me was swapping out rice in favour of chow mein noodles.  The soft, moist fish was perfectly complemented by the strands of noodles.  I was totes (swearz!) going to pause to take a photo to share with you, but...I was too busy snarfing my burrito on the tiny back patio neighbouring the restaurant.  Super affordable ($7ish), friendly, substantial without being too heavy...I am a big fan of Chino Locos.  And that position ain't loco at all...  Yelp note: for an extra 75 cents scallion-ginger 'relish' is a condiment option.  PLEASE OPT IN, it is divine."}
{"text":"Scenario: Closed long weekend, NOO... Tried again this afternoon with an old firned and,Yesssssss!!!  It's a small messy takeout place place(w/ parking), so we got our Burritos and drove up Greenwood to Dundas and ate under a tree in the park. These are some seriously hyped burritos and they so delivered. Simple Inventive take on a ubiquitous thing, perfectly filling, SO Delicious!   Food: I Got Medium Chicken Tinga(Pollo Loco) with Chow Mein noodles on Whole Wheat. Everything was so good.  Salsa = tasty fresh guac=good(and free) ... ok, you get it. no I can't stop!!!Black beans=great edamame=nice touch chicken=really good(a little too much though) cheese=mmm Cilantro=perfect! Dude, everything SO good!   Medium was proper medium!   Vegetarian: Veggie option is just beans, but vegan option as well which looks amazing! There is also a Fish option, which my girlfriend got and it wasn't breaded and fried = c'mon!! Amazing! that makes 50% of the menu veggie/pesc friendly and looks like they actually put thought into 2/3 of those options plus did I mention it was delicious?   Conclusion: This place is giving Bolets a run for my burrito buck. Thank goodness I'm a westender or I'd be looking like a burrito myself.  Absolutely must try, but I'm just one in a choir of praise!"}
{"text":"Solid burrito with a twist (noodles vs rice).  Had the jerk chicken - hot.  Next time I'll have the pork, but worth the trip."}
{"text":"The best Burrito in town, period. Any special with noodles is fantastic!"}
{"text":"Definitely a fan: they are so friendly and light-hearted and the burritos are fantastic! The Juicy Vegan leaves nothing to be desired and friends who have gotten the other varieties like the pulled pork and jerk chicken seemed pretty darn happy, too. Looking forward to trying out their new location on Broadview. Only \"complaint\" is that I miss the picnic table they used to have in the side parking lot - there really isn't anywhere to grab your burrito and sit outside."}
{"text":"In Toronto, this is one of my favourites. Obviously a modern take on the modernized/canadianized burrito. Place is small, you're basically speaking to the cook as he takes your order and cook your food. Every burrito here is great in my opinion, even the jerk chicken specialty! Call ahead to order for pick up."}
{"text":"I moved to Leslieville 29 days ago on August 1. I was out of town for 11 of those days, so let's round up and say I've been around for just over two weeks.   I've eaten at Chino Locos seven times.   I can safely say they're the bomb when it comes to cramming my gullet full of tasty burrito, and that's quite a feat considering I was on a burrito moratorium for a few years since May 21, 2006 - A Day That Will Live In Infamy.  Owners Minh and Victor are exceptionally friendly to the point of calling out to me as I walk home from the streetcar stop just to say hello. We've had some wonderful conversations and like others I've definitely been getting the \"regular\" treatment. They knows people's names when they arrive and what they usually order. The staff is all decked out in soccer shirts and bandanas and seem to vibe together really well, like old high school pals.  Crap, three paragraphs in and I haven't even made note of the food.  Whenever I think of the word burrito I think of the French verb \"bourrer\" - to stuff, but actually, more than just stuffing. Literally toppling over and filling every pore. That's the kind of satisfaction you get after eating a Chino Locos burrito. These monsters weigh at least a few pounds and are expertly folded, grilled and wrapped. Ask them to cut it in half for you since it can get a bit unwieldy because so much is stuffed inside.  My tried & true order is the basa fish burrito. Basa fish is a catfish native to Vietnam and Thailand, and as you can see from the other reviews of Chino Locos, they dole out Mexican-Asian fusion burritos. The fish portion is substantial and it's poached really nicely and has a deadly texture. The burritos all come with a junkload of standard fillings - no 50 cents extra nonsense for any of these - black bean spread, cilantro, onions, rustic rice (or chow mein), edamame beans, peppers, guacamole, sour cream and cheese. I (obviously) opt for no cilantro or onions in mine.   Burritos are $6.99 ($7.90 after tax) and there is a weekly meat special, such as General Tao, boneless ribs, pulled pork, etc. They also have a vegan burrito and a dessert burrito. Call ahead for pickup to save time. And yeah, like Greg C said, their burritos beckon you mere minutes after finishing them. Whenever I'm hungry and thinking \"what should I eat\" the craving usually leads me to Chino Locos.   My new favourite burrito in the city."}
{"text":"Damn, that's a good burrito.  I went in about ten minutes before closing on New Year's Eve, and got none of the attitude I most certainly would have given in the same situation. I'm not sure of the gentleman's name, but he was incredibly helpful in taking my order - making very useful suggestions, asking about my spice preferences and what not, and making conversation while making the burrito. Definitely a friendly atmosphere, and I can see why my friends rave about the place.  The burrito itself is amazing - incredibly tasty, though I probably should have reconsidered my request for very spicy. Good god. I've only eaten half so far, and am needing to take a break. I aspire to finish this kind of burrito in one go, but I'll have to work my way up I think. Others please choose wisely, at least on your first trip.  Be forewarned that there's not tons of space in the restaurant itself - a couple of seats, not much more. Definitely a take out sort of place."}
{"text":"Off Da 'Hook!  This place rocks.  It's, by far my favorite burrito place on the city.  The guys are always super friendly and accommodate my extra this...extra that...none of that requests. If you want to experience something new get the chow mien in the burrito.  I love it!  Then again..why choose....one of my girlfriends introduced me to half and half.  Half chow mien half rice.  Yes!  That's awesome too....especially for newbies....ask for a half and half.  Love LOVE LOVE this place. Go.  Order.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I'm in serious Chinos-withdrawl. For almost a year, I worked right by here. I'd have chinos at least once a week.  My weakness was the Pollo Loco Chow Mein Bento box AKA a tortilla-less chicken burrito with chow mein noodles in lieu of rice in a box! OM NOM NOM!  So so so gooood! Actually everything on their menu is top-notch as well as their ever-changing weekly specials. Also the guys working here are the nicest! They remembered my name and when you leave a tip they acknowledge and thank you! Which is super polite! Lastly, these boys work hard a delivering high quality food at a moderate pace!  The shop itself is tiny, so this place is especially great for take out. I would always call 15 minutes before my lunch in case they have a lot of orders(which is usually the case) and my food would be freshly waiting for me when I popped in for my pick up!  Seriously, though. So good! TRUST ME!  **they do have a couple of parking spots for pick up... pick up your food and go to Ashbridges Park to enjoy!**"}
