{"text":"Arguably the best burger I've ever had.  I can think of one place that comes close and that was in Austin Texas."}
{"text":"Had the Southside burger.  Quite tasty.  But I do wish that we in Canada could get burgers cooked medium.  As I find every restaraunt over cooks them.  The gravy was of a thiner texture, which is fine by me as the flavour was excellent.

Service was friendly, attentive without being over bearing.

Will visit again for sure!"}
{"text":"We had burgers and fries and beer (Lake of Bays Red Ale - a good complement to the burger) and had a great time. The burger was as good as they come: piled high but squash able into something you can fit in your mouth. The fries were good. The service was excellent and our table and the atmosphere were just what we needed on a rainy night in Oakville. Recommended."}
{"text":"A fun laid back place on Lakeshore in Oakville. Staff was very friendly & nice. Great wings. Lowbrow \"cuisine\" with a lot flavour... based on my wife's pulled pork sammy. That said, do not order the taco salad a shown in the photo in the previous post. It's a monstrous disaster. Just imagine how weird it would be to eat a tray of nachos that didn't get put in an oven. Cold hamburger, cheese and iceberg lettuce without a dressing. Yes, \"salad\" without dressing and a bunch of crumbled cold hamburger on a bed of iceberg lettuce. WTF."}
{"text":"I had the Baha burger (it's topped with guac and bacon) and the onion rings. The burger here is delicious. The patties (yes, this burger is composed of two smallish patties stacked on top of each other) were juicy, loosely packed, and so flavourful. They do not skimp on the guac, as many places do, and it was delicious. 

The onion rings were okay. Very crispy and nicely seasoned. I just wish the onions were cut a bit thicker so they could have stood out more from the batter. Some of the thinner onion rings made it seem like I was eating only fried batter. If I order onion rings, I really want to see and taste the onions. 

Our server was super friendly and attentive. Great dining experience."}
{"text":"Went in the early evening with wife and one child.  Burger, chicken fried chicken and chicken wings tasted great.  Atmosphere and service was terrific.  Price was good for what you get.  Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Food is good, atmosphere is homey.  Has gluten free options and in a good.location.  don't get the poutine its awful"}
{"text":"Good burgers and great gluten free chicken fingers!  Thanks for the gluten free menu options...very much appreciated!  Friendly service...will definitely go back."}
{"text":"We took a minor road trip from Guelph to Oakville one wknd and were amazed at what their downtown has to offer.  Southside Cottage Grill is pretty much a pub that serves sammies and burgers.  We all had sandwiches, i tried one of their best sellers, BBQ back bacon on ciabatta with caramelized onions.  The onions needed to be caramelized more, they were barely past the saute stage.  The back back was sliced instead of being whole which i liked.  The glaze on the meat was sweet, it really tasted like maple, i wish the sauce was more smoky. Also the sandwich would have been better if the bread was toasted, it needed some texture.  My sis had the chicken club, it was great, their were many layers to it.  Crisp veggies, mayo, and the chicken were all great.  The last sandwich we had was the best and it was the meatball sammy.  The actual meatballs were quite herbaceous, and the marinara sauce was great.  The sandwich was toasted, which really enhanced the experience.  All sandwiches come with sides, two of us had fries and they were crisp and well seasoned.  The curried vegetable soup that accompanied one sandwich was watery.  

Overall this is a good place to come in the afternoon for a sandwich and drink, i probably wouldn't come for supper."}
{"text":"Yummy fresh, filling, tasty salads. Delicious burgers. Extremely friendly waitress. Appreciated the gluten free options."}
