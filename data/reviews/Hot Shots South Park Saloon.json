{"text":"I love this place! The food is awesome, reasonably priced. Beers are cold and they have beer specials all the time. The bartenders are all really nice and attentive. Its my weekly bar of choice!!"}
{"text":"my boyfriend and i frequent here. my all time favorite food is hot wings and they make them AMAZINGLY! be prepared to sit for a bit though, because they actually make them well done, which i prefer. the rest of their menu is incredible, even down to their homemade potato chips. decent tap selection, nothing too wild but it is a small local bar.  i prefer craft beers and they are starting to get more in bottles. super friendly staff that is attentive. and the remodeling that the owner did throughout the years makes it look absolutely incredible inside compared to what i heard it used to look like. i'm glad that smoking is separate, as i am a non-smoker. love this place!"}
{"text":"I love this places  great staff and the cooks are awesome except for that older gentleman he seems like he doesnt want to cook anymore"}
{"text":"I stopped here for a drink after work.... I asked for a vodka neat, she put it on the rocks.... She than strained it and gave it to me chilled... She was rude to me when I tried to ask for another drink.  I had a twenty on my glass, that I pushed up on the bar rail (bar edict- I need a drink- fyi). There were 6 ppl including me in the bar, the only female.  I waited 10 minutes for a drink.  Very not welcoming and unprofessional."}
{"text":"Went there on a Monday Night and it turned out to be Wing Night...bonus. I ordered 10 BBQ and 6 Garlic. They were the full wing...very good. Out of 16 whole wings...I had 6 left that I couldn't finish. I asked for a box. When my bill came it had the 16 wings at .75 cents...$12
Also on the bill was 6 wings for another $8.95...the normal charge for take out wings. The wing special was .75 each...eat in only.
So...I paid the .75 plus the take out price of &1.49/ wing... that's $2.24 per wing. I guess I should have thrown away the 6 extra wings...I would have been ahead. I understand the eat in special but I will not be back too soon again for wings. When I questioned the bar maid...she said that's how they charge for wings you take with you even after ordering and eating there...and I had a few beers.
I don't care how good the food and beer is...after feeling cheated I won't be back even if my tongue was hanging to my knee for chicken wings."}
{"text":"I would seriously come and eat here all the time, however the bartenders and servers are some of the worst of all time. 
It's like they hire random people off the street and give them an apron without any training. 
Serious worst of all time"}
{"text":"Hot Shots COULD get a five-stars rating from me with just a few simple changes.  It's a great little neighborhood place that is kept clean and has plenty of large TVs that mostly display local sports programming.  I enjoy frequenting this place on their wing nights, and the wings are excellent.  Some of the other menu items that we've been tried have been pretty good too, and they serve fresh-cut fries.  The wait staff and bartenders are very friendly and helpful, and they work really hard to keep everybody happy, even though they are sometimes overwhelmed by the volume of business and lack of help.  Unfortunately, the beer selection is sub-par,(especially the tap selection) and the prices of the bottled beers that are slightly beyond the ordinary yellow junk are ridiculously high.  It's pretty obvious that they need to be nicer to their kitchen staff, as they constantly seem to be advertising for experienced cooks on signs when  you walk in the place, and it seems like the waitresses are often called to help out in the kitchen.  But if you like your chicken wings crispy, and on the large side, you will like the wings at Hot Shots."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. It took me living here 10 years before I tried it out. I think I been here 5x in the past 3 months. The food is very good. I've tried many different things and all is good.

I recommend the steak and jack. It's unbelievable."}
