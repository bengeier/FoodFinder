{"text":"You know that feeling where you recall eating at a restaurant but can't remember whether it is good or not?    As I am on the cusp of geezorhood this seems to happen a lot more often than I would like but one recurring theme always stands out.  You don't remember for a reason!  So I decided to visit this restaurant for a second time during lunch hour. A few tables, simple decor (as in no decor) and a TV playing CP24.    Asked for a jerk chicken dinner with extra oxtail gravy on the rice and chicken which cost me about $10. So far so good.   When I tried the chicken I suddenly received an influx of memories from my last visit. The verdict?  Nothing. The chicken is bland even with the oxtail gravy which kind of surprised me as the chicken \"looked\" really good. If I were to describe the oxtail gravy I would say oily with remnants of oxtail taste. The perfect analogy would be bubble gum after chewing it for a while. You kind of taste the original flavor yet not.   Maybe I'm missing something here as the nice lady did ask me if I wanted jerk sauce. I politely declined as I have never heard of that before. Shouldn't the jerk be embedded into the skin and meat anyways?    To be fair, its not like there are many Carribean restaurants in the area so it might be good for a quick fix. Perhaps a safer bet would be the curry roti."}
{"text":"This is my go to jerk chicken spot for lunch. They are quick to serve and the foods is amazing. I would have given 5 stars,but sometimes the rice and peas is under cooked for my liking."}
{"text":"I went in with an open mind and wow. I was so impressed. Had a spicy chicken with rice and veggies and Oz Tail gravy. Have to say, it tasted sooo good! One of my new favourites."}
{"text":"Oxtail and rice and beans please....do you have any?  We live nearby and when we feel like Caribbean food we'll go and get take out.  However, often times more than not, everything we want is sold out.  Roti, is always sold out.  Jerk chicken, is always sold out.  Ox tail however, is sometimes available and when it is available, man it's good.  Fall off the bone, savoury gravy, fantastic with the rice and beans.  Also, their \"veggie\" is coleslaw.    Once, I saw a customer order festivals and I have to say they looked delicious!     So go earlier in the day, maybe they'll have some more options for lunch than dinner.  Friendly smiles, and helpful whenever I have questions, Potluck is a great neighbourhood addition!"}
{"text":"The go to place for  jerk  chicken  ,don't forget the  coleslaw and ox gravy.  Reasonable prices"}
{"text":"Soooooo delicious!   I went here on a referral from a friend and I am so glad I listened.  The jerk chicken was AMAZING. I usually prefer to eat it homemade because I find many of these restaurants will have the chicken too dry. But oh my goodness was this chicken flavourful, tender and juicy!!!  The rice and peas with oxtail gravy was amazing and the coleslaw was perfect.   Plus the workers here were all very nice and friendly and you can tell they love what they do.   10/10"}
{"text":"I had a bit of time to kill before an event I attended at the Mississauga Convention Centre.  Driving passed the MCC, I decide to go into this new strip plaza figuring there would be something.  As soon as I stumbled on Potluck, it got me.  Then the question became whether it was Trini or Jamaican food.  Saw the menu and jerk chicken was front and centre.  I actually wanted the callaloo and saltfish.  They said they didn't have any.  You know it's a West Indian thing when they don't feel like making something.  The guy's half-assed no told the tale.    So I went for the small jerk chicken breast with rice and steamed veggies.  The sauce was an oxtail sauce over the rice. The bed of rice was massive.  The jerk was kinda spicy so I had to add lots of hot sauce.  With water, the total came under $10.    If it wasn't for the fact I didn't get my callaloo and saltfish, I would have rated this place a 4.  I mean it's not a bad place but of course since I'm half Trini, you know Jamaican food will always get lower grades.  HAHA!!"}
{"text":"My first visit with a co-worker and I went straight for the Cadillac meal. The Oxtail and a large size I might add. I even requested for their homemade hot sauce. I have to say that it was nice meal not blowing off my socks great but it was nice. Their coleslaw is pretty good has a nice crunch to it and not to sweet or sour just right. The pieces of oxtail were kind of small but I guess they had to chop them down. Overall is would I revisit...Yes of course."}
{"text":"I happened to be in the area and was going to grab a pizza until I'm like, \"nah man.. It's a jerk chicken kinda day!\" First time being here and surprised that it wasn't yelped since its been around for the past year or two, according to the cashier. It's a small place with a TV and it happens to look really dark during the day time, they need better lighting. I grabbed the small jerk chicken with coleslaw and extra oxtail gravy. Since the place is small I decided to do take out. Took the cook 5 minutes to make it and I decided to eat it in my car because I became more hungry while I waited. So I got white meat, it was a pretty good portion size, and the chicken was medium spicy which made it easy to eat. I found that I've had better Jerk chicken, a little more flavourful. The rice seemed a little bland even with the extra oxtail gravy. They also put a fair amount of coleslaw which was delicious. Since the food was fresh it was still enjoyable. If you need a quick fix for Jamaican food, this restaurant will do just that!"}
{"text":"Hands down, this place has the best jerk chicken. I've tried jerk chicken at MANY different restaurants and this is definitely my first pick. The rice has that rich coconut aroma and they always give a good amount of coleslaw.  I don't have a photo right now but i'll probably be here soon so keep you guys posted. YUM-O."}
