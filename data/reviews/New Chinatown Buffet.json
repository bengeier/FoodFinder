{"text":"My husband and I found this place online, and being new to the area, decided to try it out. Mainly we went because the menu said it had sushi, which we both love.  When we entered we were immediately greeted by this overwhelming bridge/pond thing. My husband even commented that it seemed a bit much for a chinese buffet. Greeted and seated, we went to get our food.  Sushi? I don't call that sushi. There was a VERY tiny selection of poorly rolled, fake sushi. It was all fake crab and limp shrimp. There was even a \"sushi\" roll that was just white rice wrapped in seaweed! Most of it didn't have any fish in it at all. The spicy tuna and crab was some premade, gritty paste.  The rest of the food was pretty mediocre as well. Sitting under lamps for extended periods of time, congealing.  About a month later, we decided to give it another try to see if it was different. NOPE!  Same terrible fake sushi, bad noodles, limp green beans, hard and sticky pepper chicken. Normally I love fresh mussels but the one I tried to eat.... If I had choked it down I can tell you I would have gotten sick.  I told hubby it was the worst chinese I've ever had. As we were leaving to go down to the movie theatre, we were given 10% because we were \"the last table of the night.\" Yea, right. Probably because they heard us say the food was terrible.  Service is good though. Never have an empty glass.  I would much rather drive back to parma and go to Mizu. Real sushi for a better price.  Should have known it wouldn't be good when both times we went there was only two tables seated in the whole, rather large, place."}
{"text":"Nobody come to pick up the empty plates; nobody come to refill the drinks. Charge dinner buffer $ all day long on Sunday.  Awful experience."}
{"text":"Ohh New Chinatown Buffet. You came into my life so many years ago. You are to me like professional football is to brett favre. I wish i could quit you.  Food is always very nice. Some of the waiters wairresses can be a little weird. But thats a small part of the experience.  Lunch price is by far the best deal around if you got time.   The dinner and sunday buffet is subpar for the price. Crab legs are now quite terrible and always gobbled up by someone as they are brought out, which leaves mostly scraps for everyone else.   Other than that just be careful when you start eatinf here. Its hard to break free of its clutches.  Also the fish pond is tacky and smells. They should get rid of it."}
{"text":"Place is pretty nice as far as decor, pretty decent service however the food is a different story.  The food at best is mediocre.  They are over priced.  Most of the food has been sitting for a long time and someone just comes out and stirs it up to make it look fresh again.  Do yourself a favor, save you money and go eat some REAL chinese food at E32st and Payne in Cleveland. (BBQ Wonton)."}
{"text":"This place is flat out nasty. The food tastes gross and it's super expensive. The only good thing about this place is the Koi pond as you enter, after that its all down hill. Some of their staff was friendly most were very rude.   They have signs where they say they'll charge you more if you take more than a certain amount of crab legs. I get it crab legs aren't cheap but I felt like the sign was rude if you want to limit your guests have it listed and have the waitresses bring your allotted amount to the table. That's what some places do for things such as buffalo wings.  There are signs that say \"don't waste food\" ok make the food appealing and fit to eat and that wouldn't happen.   The food was horrible. The deserts that contained milk in them had a smell like the milk had spoiled in them. So I didn't eat them. And the others tasted old stale AND freezer burnt.   I was pregnant at the time and everyone at our table got sick. This place is LUCKY I didn't sue them."}
{"text":"the last time we went there the young owner came p to me and told me we were eating to much food,isaid your full of crap, then he told me come to his office he was recording people eating ,.plus the food is getting worse will never go back,,yes recording people at the buffet lines.oh my god'"}
{"text":"Very disappointing.  Place is not very clean.  The floors are all wet.  The staff is not attentive and not friendly.    The food is only so-so.  Seemed like alot of the items had been sitting around and this was a Sunday at 12:30.  It was not busy at all.  They do not have 5 tables of food as advertised.  The Mongolian and sushi bars are a joke.  Had to wait some time before someone showed up to cook food.  They claim over 200 choices but a lot of the items are sauces and not main dish items.  This was not worth the drive or the $12.99 Sunday dinner price."}
{"text":"Tonight we dine in HELL!! it is nearly 100 degrees outside and they have stoves actively cooking in here.. Do you think the air conditioning is on? Fuck no fuck you customers eat your food in sweltering heat.. Disgraceful"}
{"text":"This place has gone downhill, the selection of food is dismal and the service is lack luster as well, wish I could say something positive but I can't..the price you pay for this buffet and the lack of food choice.. And there sushi is disgusting..."}
{"text":"I've never been a big buffet guy but decided to try this for lunch with some coworkers. I was very disappointed, with both the food and the service. The waitresses were up my ass the entire time, as soon as I drank half of my water, they were ready to refill it.         I wasn't able to even hold a five minute conversation without being rudely interrupted. As for the food, the chicken was a bit dry as well as the pizza. Food seemed like it had been sitting all day.     Only positive I came out with was the decor of the restaurant, authentic Chinese designs and bridge lead you into the dining room. Also live fish also fill the pond in the restaurant. Overall disappointing food, unless you're going here to take snapshots, which I doubt then you should probably stay away."}
{"text":"My favorite chinese place! Food is always fresh, place is always clean and service is friendly!"}
{"text":"They always have fresh, tasty food here. We come from the city to eat here. Totally worth the drive!"}
{"text":"It's like every other buffet. Food was good, staff doesn't speak English well and it was pretty dead. Be careful when u walk in, there's a bridge u cross inside that's like a big hill."}
{"text":"A pretty good Chinese/American buffet. Been here several times over the years and never had really any problems. The food is usually pretty good. One of the better Chinese buffets in the area."}
{"text":"I have a confession to make: I lived in Elyria for a whole year. Hard to believe, I know, but there are always some pit stops on the way to glory. And when friends or family thankfully came to town, I always tried to steer them here. I mean, it has a freaking indoor waterfall, in addition to your favorite greasy Chinese buffet fare. Definitely not one of those places to visit on a weekly basis, but I firmly believe that a little (or, who am I kidding, a lot of) buffet is good for the soul, if not for the cholesterol count."}
{"text":"The food is warm and good. The decor is better than avarage for a buffet. I wouldn't hesitate for a minute going back to this buffet in the future."}
{"text":"So where do I begin... When you first walk in, you have to cross over a bridge bc they have a man made fountain in the front which is pretty to look at if you ignore all the cob webs around the stones. So I'm guessing no one ever cleans that which is sad bc it's basically the main attraction when you walk in. The music sounds like lullabies.  The lighting inside is very dim so you can be esmasily c.f. deceived with what's in their food. And for being an Asian Buffet it was interesting to see only one Asian worker, who seemed like she was the hardest worker there.  So their food... Well everything seemed fresh since they kept coming out with new trays of new food to put on the line but when I took a bite it was so stale or super hard like it was refried.  I was really disappointed from the last time I came here many years ago and how much it changed.  I took a bite of the potato skins that looked delicious with its sour cream and bacon and cheese and when I did I had to spit it out.  That was not sour cream that was all mayo.  I felt so violated when I ate that.  The buffalo chicken wings was ok but the flavor was pretty bland and it tasted like someone just fried the wings and got one of the hot sauce bottles from Save a lot and just drenched it. They have something called the cheese rangoon which is like the crab rangoon you can order in other Asian restaurants but this was was super duper stale.  I seriously thought I was going to chip my tooth trying to eat it.  In the front they have a sign that says don't waste the food but honestly if you made your food right the first time maybe less people would waste it.  Overall the food that I tried that seemed to taste delicious was the sugar covered donuts they have and the ice cream.  I didn't care for any thing else they had because it was super greasy with every bite so expect to have your mouth squirt out the excess oils in their food.  This place used to be so good and delicious I am very sad to see where it is now.  Whatever you guys were doing before, I would suggest you to do it again to bring more business."}
{"text":"Food is not very good. Everything on the Buffett seems old. Only a few items were fresh. The sushi is tasteless and there are many items on the buffet that I have never seen in any Asian inspired buffet anywhere( not in a good way)."}
{"text":"Great selection,  very clean and super friendly staff.  I was asked if I had any questions when looking at sushi.  Also I was given a free fountain drink for coming in early.  I wish I lived closer because I was surprised how nice it was."}
{"text":"I'm not usually a fan of Buffet style dining. And especially Chinese Buffet. But this one was pretty good.  They had a very nice bridge going over a Koi pond at the entrance.    It had quite a varied menu. and most of the stuff had a good flavor. It was one of the few times that I actually enjoyed an egg roll. Usually they are nasty and tasteless. These were very good. I sampled a little bit of everything that I could. The staff was very helpful in guiding my choices so I didn't end up ingesting any crab, shrimp, or lobster. I let them know I was allergic, so they were quite helpful in letting me know what was in each dish.   Dessert was good. A chest of ice cream buckets to choose from and the dessert counter with baked goods.   I'm still not a buffet fan, but I would go back here."}
