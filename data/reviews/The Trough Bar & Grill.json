{"text":"Not a great place for game day. Don't hire enough waitresses. Ashly works her ass off. Drinks run empty and over hour wait for food. Group of 7 and all got meal delivered at different times 45 minutes apart.   Owner doesn't appreciate Sunday business enough to show up. Losing ton of money not serving drinks and no more repeat business."}
{"text":"I go there every Wednesday to dance with Tianna. The place is a pig sty. The floor is never mopped and is dangerous for dancing. How about mopping and waxing staff!! There has been a handprint on the mirror by the stage for months, proof that you never clean the place. This being said I will never eat there as I can only imagine that the kitchen is a sty too. Plus I often go by myself and I have to go to the bar to get my own drink as I have realized that I have become invisible."}
{"text":"My favorite bar on the planet. Great place to sit back relax and drink some ice cold beer with good friends. Also great entertainment.,,,,, good times."}
{"text":"What a nice friendly sports bar. We are new to town and the staff and customers made us feel welcomed. The food is really good too."}
{"text":"First time visitor to this establishment. We were in on a week day late afternoon. Not real busy, but not empty either. Everyone we dealt with at Troughs, be it staff or patrons were both friendly and talkative. Had bacon cheeseburger with fries and a hearty ale to wash it down. The burger was cooked to my (rare) favorite degree of done ness and was very good. The fries were excellent, but the portion was a bit lacking, or maybe I like to many fries when they are this good. We will be back, and are looking forward to an evening of a few brews, some good food and a side of music!!"}
{"text":"Went to the trough yesterday afternoon for burgers and beers. It was good with good waitress. My brother paid for the meal with his card and we got the tip which we left in cash on the table. Before we had a chance to leave a scrawny little red head rooster came to our table and began to berate us for not leaving a tip, going on about the waitress doesn't work for nothing etc. When we drew his attention to the tip on the table he took it and left with no apology for his rude behavior and assumptions or anything.  Poor form little leprechaun, poor form.  We won't be back....."}
{"text":"So about the only thing ok about this place that is ok is playing pool but bribg change because the chsnge machine doesn't work.   Everyone from the bartender to the waitress was rude.. Food was inedible."}
{"text":"Bar is dangerous don't go there. Rabid viscous customers allowed and welcome in there."}
{"text":"This place is worth it just for the friendly bar staff.  Rob is great!  What's nice about the place is that it is big and has just about something for everyone.  Karaoke, pool, dancing and if you love to people watch, it has that too.  Good basic bar food but always a fun atmosphere.  You won't break the bank here either.  Both food and drinks are reasonable."}
{"text":"Bring your hazmat suit with you.. this place is filthy, health dept should visit this place... come on have some respect for your buisness and some respect for your patrons.. told employees about bathroom conditions that are a serious health hazzard and they could care less.. wont spend my money here. What does the kitchen look like? Someone call Ramsey or taffer, they need help. Lol, they want to take possession of your credit card before you eat or drink on the weekends because people bail on their tabs here.. well you attract those types because of the way it's ran and the condition of the establishment.. why take the effort, time, and money to attract deadbeats? You survive on repeat honest customers, but you need to make them want to come back.... buisness 101"}
{"text":"I wish the management of this place would step up and fix the problems. Ashley is a great waitress but there is never enough staff. Long wait for food and sometimes it's cold.  Place is dirty and needs updating. Only reason we come here is  we can walk. I can't believe the crowds they draw on Sunday with such bad service. Cmon we want to support this place but we are discouraged by management lack of care."}
{"text":"This bar is really big.  Has several pool tables and plenty of seating. At the hour we were there, the crowd was 95% under 30 years old.  Music was mostly heavy metal and extremely loud.  The bartender was attentive, but not real personable. If older, I would suggest going earlier in the day if you want to dine and have an enjoyable time."}
{"text":"We had a great time here playing trivia. The food was good for a bar, it wasn't just deep fried 'bar food.'  The menu has great options and the drinks were cold. Friendly bartender but the waitress could have been more personable.  The crowd was diverse, locals and snow birds.Would like to go back on a weekend night when there's music. I'm sure there's a fun vibe! This isn't Scottsdale so don't look for upscale. For East Mesa or AJ the Trough is the place."}
{"text":"$6.20 for the country scramble. Got the hash Browns instead of the homefries and got them extremely crispy like i ordered them and the bacon was crispy like i ordered them. I will bring my snowbird friends here."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Saturday afternoon wanting a few beers and some wings. We were not disappointed. Great wings (although we should have went for the HOT instead of medium).  We got the Pizza and 20 wings for $22.99 deal. Pizza had a LOT of cheese which is great for me. I didn't really like the sauce but I usually don't like the sauce wherever we go, so that is just me!  Hubby liked it. Great bar!! Wish we lived closer !! It would quickly become \"our place\". We will be back next time we are in Mesa!"}
{"text":"First time here.  Came with wife.  Food was mediocre at best.  Service very slow. Caters to the older retired group. Live music only to 8 pm during the week and when that is over the place empties.  Do not think we will be back."}
{"text":"Entertainment five stars, service one star! Great place for entertainment! But you go up to the bar and order a drink order five of them they won't ever come to wait on you! That being said not such a bad place!"}
{"text":"Very busy place on a Friday night. Entertainment mainly for older crowd who looked like they were having allot of fun. But we went to eat which was not a good experience. Slow service because they don't have enough help. Fish fry was wet and soggy. Tartar sauce came 10 minutes after fish so fish was cold. Burger was ok but bun was hard as a rock. Might go back just for fun, but not to eat. Too dirty."}
{"text":"I love how they have automatic paper towel dispenser, it really nice, makes me want to keep coming back and dancing and maybe even sing a bit, sure and yes; it's kind of the thing to do when you have a great time and have fun at the same time.  Yes, it's great bar and bar tender love; got to love a great time"}
{"text":"I have been going here for some years. My parents actually started me off here ..lol .. so big Shot out to my mother Tina Daugherty and dad Timothy Daugherty. I dont get to go as much now due to living chandler but when I can I do :) good food and cheap drinks. The staff is always nice and fun. My mom recently passed and alot of the patrons and staff loved her and showed their love at her service... so thank you guys for being amamzing."}
{"text":"We just moved to Mesa and trying to find the perfect watering hole for our taste buds. Alas! We found The Trough! A wide arrange of folks and the staff is exceptional. This review is based off late night drinks and not dining. Our server on both nights is Shawna. I'm probably butchering her name but she made our experience here even more special. She's a wonderful asset. The DJ plays every genre under the sun and the locals are friendly. No drama so far. . The kegs weren't working at one point so we ordered domestics and later on, the bartender presented us with our original request. Super sweet and genuine service. We just came from downtown Scottsdale and frankly, the service here got them beat."}
{"text":"I've been here several times, definitely not a regular, and it's been great every visit. Maybe the people complaining aren't nice to the staff, or don't appreciate the bar feel, I'm not sure, but I love this place."}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would. Cleaning the place could be a good start. Most of the booth tables rock. The woman's bathroom was extremely disgusting.....Filthy, filthy, filthy gross is all I can say.  I have never seen a woman's bathroom as bad as that.  Has the bathroom \"ever\" seen a cleaning solvent?? When I told the guy who worked there about the bathroom..... he looked at me and didn't say he's on it,  he'd take care of it, nothing!! He could give a crap. The only good thing I can say is the waitress was very nice.  Girl you need to go work somewhere else where you'll be appreciated."}
{"text":"Just had the Philly Cheese stake. Really Good!  All football games on, and decent folks, then Hank walked in.  It was after the Packers loss.  He kept yelling, \"I need a drink and a man!\"  Finally the owner politely asked Hank to leave.  Hank ran to a corner and laid on the ground crying.  \"Why?!  Why can't I be cool like Mr. Bo?\"  At last he fell asleep in the corner sucking his thumb.  I recommend The Trough.  I do not recommend Hank."}
