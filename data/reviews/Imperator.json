{"text":"I went with Melinda M to this place last night also. It was my second time there, and it's definitely a unique experience.  We were a group of around 15 and arrived around 8 to a table set with about 40 dishes of shrimp cocktail, pickled herring, large plates of smoked salmon, beet salad, chicken pates, caesar salad, caviar and mini-pancakes, and much, much more. The table also had wine and little carafes of vodka that we had purchased earlier and given to the restaurant earlier in the day.  We started eating and the servers just keep bringing more food as we ate. The food was good but I'd agree that the appetizers were better than the mains, although I didn't eat many mains because I was full of the early dishes.  The crazy part of this place really starts around 9 when a band goes on that is part russian folk, part 80s hair-band, part wedding band, and plays a mixture of all those types of music. And people dance like it's a wedding night.  It's definitely somewhere Torontonians should try, but go as a group. Much more fun that way."}
{"text":"I have gone to and booked many events through out the years at this hall!  -THE DECOR: cozy and classy, with a sexy atmosphere; dimmed lights, candles, table settings, chair covers, fun sights on the dance floor,and so on....  -THE FOOD: is definitely above average! ive been to every russian hall in the GTA since a young child! very fresh! great assortment! well seasoned/ marinated, perfect temperature every time! HUGE selection- it keeps on coming and coming...like a private buffet at your own table! (and left overs- can always come home with you)  -ALCOHOL: thats the best part, you bring you  bring your own! have it arranged! you save tons of money! :  -MUSIC/ENTERTAINMENT: VERY upbeat! great talent on stage!  its a live band! the music is varied by the groups who are partying, even though they have \"set songs\"or most requested; they also play what ever is \"REQUESTED\" but you generally tip, because theres a priority list, otherwise enjoy what they offer!  they have many recent songs, and once those go on, the whole hall is bouncing of their chairs!  GREAT STAFF, HARD WORKERS AND ALWAYS QUICK!  As mentioned by other; there will be other parties at the event, could be 2, 3, 4 ,5 depends on amount of people, they offer security, and private events are always popular, wedding , ect.... everyone has a great time together!!! thats the best part, you make new friends, and have an experience you'll crave to have over and over again!!  CHEERS!! :D DONT FORGET TO TIP THE STAFF AND BAND, THEY WORK THEIR BUTTS OFF TO MAKE YOUR NIGHT ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!!  p.s KIDS ARE EVEN WELCOME!!!! :D OUR LITTLE ONE LOOOOVES COMING OUT WITH US AND DANCING UP A STORM :)"}
{"text":"This crazy Russian banquet hall in the boonies way north of the city is a blast for a Saturday night with a group of friends.  Definitely go with an appetite. Definitely arrange a group of friends who will pay $60 each to gorge on a Russian feast. Definitely buy booze for the table and drop it off the day of your Russian night of fun!  I have a friend who has organized parties at this place. Be aware, you will be there with many other parties of people celebrating birthdays, anniversaries, and just having a good time. There are about 15 tables of 20 people each. The show - with a band singing all sorts of Russian songs - starts at 9PM, so get there for that, as the dance floor fills up and it's very entertaining.  Food is plentiful and very good. I always fill up on the appetizers, which include caviar, smoked salmon, shrimp cocktail, crab salad, ceasar salad, and on and on. I wasn't as impressed with the much more limited entrees (a plate of chicken of different styles of cooking), but the pastries for dessert were good. By that point you may not even be able to eat it! They give you lots of food!  A very entertaining night. Plan ahead, and bring lots of friends."}
