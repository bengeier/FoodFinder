{"text":"Really, really, really tasty sandwiches.  I was recommended here by a Vietnamese friend so I figured it would be pretty legit.  

The baguette is so good.  Some places the crust is so sharp it rubs the roof of your mouth off.  Not here, its crunchy but soft.  Innards are tender and chewy.  The fillings are about the same as anywhere else though we found the pork to be tastier than the chicken.  I also liked that they didn't overload with mayo.   

Each sandwich was $3.00--a great deal for a snack or quick lunch.   I cannot wait to go back and try more!"}
{"text":"Delicious cheap sandwiches!

Placed my order at the counter and the sandwich was already premade and handed to me within seconds. They cut the banh mi in half and put them into separate bags. Very smart of them. This makes it easier to eat and help keep my hands clean! If you can't finish the sandwich, you can always take the other half to go. 

I had the BBQ pork (#1) for $3.00 and it was definitely worth it. This is a lot cheaper than most banh mi places. I took half my sandwich to go and within a few hours, the bread was no longer fresh. It was as hard as a rock but nothing an oven can't fix. I would recommend finishing the entire sandwich while you're there to avoid losing the fresh taste.

Would definitely come back and try the other sandwiches they have"}
{"text":"The real Vietnamese sandwich place. No other place will offer you great Vietnamese authentic sandwiches  like this place does. Obviously not comparing to Banh Mi Boys as that has a fusion twist"}
{"text":"Great Vietnamese sandwich. Very reasonable price.
Filling is like most other Vietnamese sandwich. 
The baguette is amazing... fresh, soft inside and just enough crispy on the outside. Which make the sandwich so much better."}
{"text":"HANDS DOWN BEST VIET SUBS!

I get viet subs from a ton of places but this is mostttt definitely the best. They bake the bread fresh and its just the most amazing bread. This is what really makes the sandwich special from other places. It's tender and crispy, not crunchy. 

I go here for cheap lunches on the weekly! $2.50 woot woot!"}
{"text":"Very good viet  subs. Fresh buns and vegetables one of the best I've had! No issues with ordering and I'm Canadian and only speak English."}
{"text":"This is my go to place for Viet Sandwiches. It used to be very cheap, but now it is getting quite price. 

In terms of service, It was ok. I wouldn't say that it was amazing, but it wasn't bad at all. Think of it as a Viet fast food place. 

Pricing was a little bit more expensive than what I thought it would be. I might sound a little bit old, but \"back in my day\", the subs were $1.25 each. This is why when I arrived, I was surprised by the price. 

A recommendation that I might give them is to have a menu that is translated into English. I wanted to try other items on the menu, but I have no idea what to order. Everything was in Viet. 

Finally, the sandwich was great. The bread was very fresh, and the cold cuts were tasty. I got mine spicy, but was a little bit disappointed with the spice level. I thought it wasn't spicy enough.

For all you people going in groups, please keep in mind that it is buy 10 get 1 free. I walked out with 11 subs."}
{"text":"This is my favourite place to go for authentic Viet subs. $2.50 per sandwich, what more could you ask for? My favourite is the shredded chicken but their other ones are also really good."}
{"text":"One of my favourite authentic Vietnamese sub stores in the GTA. 

It's very Vietnamese based and I understand why people would struggle if they don't speak Vietnamese. 

But if you can manage to order a banh mi, I promise you it's worth the struggle. The baguettes are baked daily and has been this way since my parents brought me here when I was still a kid. The mayo/pare mixture is soooo good and although I always get banh mi cha lau instead of the thap cam (assorted) they easily fill my order and they don't skimp out on the fillings either. 

I also love the variety of Vietnamese snacks they have from banh chuoi hap, banh da lon, and soi. Since I'm based in Hamilton for school there isn't a store where I can buy Vietnamese subs and snacks so when I go to my parents I seem to always hoard back a bunch of food. 

Honestly for $3 a sub, you can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Truly authentic sub with delicious bread. Very busy place so you can be confident that the place is well known and good. I  love the bread it is nice and delicately crusty and melt on your mouth soft on the inside. The taste of the condiments set it apart from other sub places"}
{"text":"I have traveled all over Asia and Vietnam. Been eating banh mi since I was a child. I'd have to say this is the best place to eat in Canada! very authentic and yummy. Great food great staff and service. I highly recommend this place! www.djcross.ca world traveler... Update! Just came back again tasted their whole menue and I'm in heaven can't get enough of these subs! There so addictive best in the gta! They now have Vietnamese ice coffee which is really yummy  for the summer time heat. Deserts see pretty awesome as well!  Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Wow such an amazing banh sandwich. Only three dollars but cash only and that that includes the tax. Reminds me of my days in Saigon. 
Actually I was on my way to my favourite barbeque place next-door but this place is definitely worth the detour."}
{"text":"Great ingredients for a sandwich! I've had BBQ pork and shredded jerky, both meats being tasty and fresh. Vietnamese make their baguette more airy which can come out to feel a little \"stale and crisp\" on the ends for people who are used to a more moist baguette, but this ends up working for this kind of sandwich. They add a generous amount of their pâté based sauce and it works well for it.

Not sure why they call themselves a bakery, they're mostly a sandwich shop as far as I can tell.

They have English translation on their menu. It can be a little challenging at times communicating what you want, so try to be very simple and clear when ordering. As always, be patient and understanding.

1 sandwich is a great lunch for me, and they're still just as great hours later due to the airiness of the bread, no sogginess!

Great for groups as they offer a buy 10, get 1 free deal. For $3/sandwich, it can't be beat."}
{"text":"I've never had Vietnamese Sub before and was recommended by a Co-worker since I work around the area. It was OUTSTANDING! , a bit of a language barrier with the staff but it seems like the majority of the customers are Vietnamese which means this place must be good. Much better value than the Holy Smokez BBQ place and that condescending rude bald guy and their pretend \"Southern\" BBQ"}
{"text":"Take out place to grab Banh Mi. Cheap Vietnamese subs for $3. Not bad!

Went in, and had a hard time reading the menu - it was mostly in Vietnamese, with the exception of one item, so I got that (lol).

It was what I expected in a viet sub. Cold cuts, some pâté, and tasty tangy carrots and cucumbers. Could've had a bit more tangy zing, but otherwise a good snack for the price! Will come back if I'm in the area and am craving a viet sub but probably wouldn't go out of my way to get it."}
{"text":"4* - Banh Mi (bread is fresh!)
2* - Slightly Frustrating Service

If you get the grandma looking sandwich maker, she does not speak English nor will she provide a receipt for your purchase.  (I pointed to the receipt machine and she said, \"No receipt!\"  I don't think she knew how to operate the register.)  Normally, I am very good with communicating with people who do not speak English, but this was an admittedly frustrating experience.

I ordered 1 - Chicken, 1 - Assorted and she was making 3 sandwiches, so I had to tell her that I only wanted 2 sandwiches - more than once.  She barely understood what I meant when I said \"Chicken\".  I almost had to perform Charades for this lady to understand me.

So if you're strict Halal/Kosher or vegetarian, I cannot recommend this place as it may be difficult for you to communicate that the specific meat that you want.  There's also some kinda mayo-based sauce that looks like there's some kinda minced meat mixed in.  Is that pork/beef/chicken?  I dunno and I'm sure this lady wouldn't be able to tell you.

Don't get me wrong, bread is very lovely, fresh, and it's $3 for a longish banh mi.  However, if you have certain dietary concerns or low on patience in dealing with someone who doesn't speak/understand English, I'd steer clear."}
{"text":"terrible vietnamese sub. the bread tasted like sawdust. i ordered assorted sub (tap cam) and they didnt even put the correct meat. terrible service. the workers dont seem to pay attention to my order when i repeated my order 5 times. i am NEVER coming back here. laugh all you want. i dont care cuz i'm not gona waste my money again. go to Banh Mi Ba Le you guys. it's way better than this piece of crap."}
{"text":"I would have to agree that this place has the best vietnamese subs in the city! The bread is good and not too thick that u would only get the bread and not the goodies inside! So far it's my favorite place to get subs."}
{"text":"Co workers wanted a taste of Vietnam so I went to get them some banh mi! Unfortunately, this place doesn't get more than 3 stars from me.  We ordered the assorted , chicken and pork banh mi.  The banh mi looked big while it was being made but once you start  eating it, you will realize it's not so big.  I guess because it was due to the fact that they put so little meat in it.  Yes it was only $ 3.50 per banh mi but incomparison to other banh mi places, this place really skimped out when it comes to the meat.  Also, the pork and chicken were very shredded and crumbly not thinly sliced like you would think.  All in all, if you want something cheap and something super light, give this a try."}
{"text":"Being fluent in Vietnamese, I haven't experienced some of the problems other reviewers have, but nevertheless, my rating still seems to be consistent.  

I really enjoy the Banh Mi here as they are fresh, and have perfect ratios in terms of the bulk of the Banh Mi itself.  Where I deducted one star is due to the inconsistency of their mayo in which I have found to sometimes be a little sour/stronger.  Not that big of a deal, but sometimes throws me off a bit.  I usually just buy the Assorted Meat (Bánh Mì Thap Cam) but I have discovered a new favourite.  I highly recommend the Bánh Mì Patê Bo Chà Bông  which translates to Rousong and Pâté according to Wikipedia.  It is less filling than the assorted meat, but I've found it to be tastier and less heavy.  Also, you can ask for it to be spicy where they add grounded fresh peppers.  This will cause some parts of the Banh Mi to be spicier than others so eat with caution! 

Anyways, I think this is a great place to grab some delicious Banh Mi, but beware that you will have to face a great language barrier, and perhaps some small inconsistencies."}
{"text":"What to try?

All my Viêt friends say they serve one of the best Viêt subs in Mississauga so I try to get their subs when I'm driving in the area too! They have different types of subs whether it be assorted meats, chicken, pork or beef. I usually go for assorted so I get a deli sandwich so to speak. They pack it with a lot of ingredients typically found in Viêt subs and I like their subs because it's extra long and you don't get a lot of bread. When you think about it, the ratio of bread to ingredients is low and you look like you're getting a bang for your buck!! Ingredients are fresh and made to order when you come in! I ordered 11 subs for the price of 10. I'm ready to serve a party with subs now!

LAST TIP:

They only accept cash so come cash ready. Like I said, If you have a lot of ppl to serve or you really love having Viêt sub every meal for the next couple of days, take advantage of their 11 subs for the price of 10. Usually each sub costs about $3."}
