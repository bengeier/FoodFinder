{"text":"Excellent choice for Indian dishes! There were 4 of us and we started with the pakoras, samosas and chicken lollipops. We then shared the butter chicken, braised beef rib and chicken biryanis. All delicious! The sangria is also a must."}
{"text":"Not a big fan of indian food, but when I went to this restaurant I loved their food; very cool look inside and very friendly service. Basmati rice and Naan ( indian bread ) is always there as much as you want and comparing the price to the food it's amazing. I have had my birthday there with 25 people and they had a huge table for all of us. It's close to the train and has a free parking spot."}
{"text":"I went to the lunch buffet with a few friends.  I understand it is a weekday and it gets very busy at lunchtime.  My friend got there first, sat for over 10 minutes without anyone coming by to ask if she wanted anything.  Finally she got served her drink.  Myself and the rest of the group get there.  No one comes by the table to serve us or get our drink order.  Thats fine, we were there for the buffet anyways so we got up, grabbed our plates and got our lunch.  The food overall was quite good, loved the spiciness and the flavors.  I thought the selection was small, but I liked everything they had.  I do want to mention that the butter chicken didn't have many pieces of chicken in it.  You really had to spoon through the sauce to look for the chicken.  We got our lunch sat down, halfway through a server comes by and we got drinks.  That was the end of any type of service.  No one asked if we wanted more drinks, or even to give us the bill.  No one took away the dirty plates and we sat there after our meals for a good 1/2 hr chatting.   Finally we got up and went to the register to pay.  The food was good, service sucked, I'm sure there's better out there."}
{"text":"Love it here - One of my favourite places in the Core to go for lunch - Its always a big buffet spread and even though its usually quite busy during the noon lunch hour, I find their service to be impeccable - Have been coming here for the last 4 years and never had an issue with the service or the food."}
{"text":"Nice ambiance. Friendly staff and good food. Portion sizes are generous. A tad spicy but fresh and authentic with a nice twist. We had the Pakistani biryani, lamb chops and paneer. Lamb chops were excellent. Dishes came creatively presented. A little pricey but worth it."}
{"text":"Had an awesome experience here during happy hour a couple of days ago. We tried a couple of the $5 appetizers and they were both delicious! Good selection of drinks, too. Can't wait to go back for an actual meal!"}
{"text":"Good environment, great food, ridiculously overpriced for Indian fare. Consider this more a lounge than a restaurant."}
{"text":"I've been here about four times this past year and have always had excellent service.  Whenever there was a delay in service, we were always compensated without asking.  The servers are attentive and polite without being overbearing.  The menu is pricier and smaller than traditional indian restaurants but this is not the place to go for a traditional experience.  The decor and ambiance are lovely, the food very tasty and the portion size nice (hey, if you want a super double meal with unlimited sides you wouldn't be interested in this place, so by nice portion size I mean its a good a regular meal).

Try the mango lassi and chai for non-alcoholic beverages.  Haven't found an appetizer that wasn't excellent.  The new vegetarian menu so far is good (previously the veggie dishes were incredibly tasty but could be a bit  monotonous part way through).  I have heard from my meatatarian friends that the lamb and chicken dishes are to die for.  

Yum!"}
{"text":"Best Indian buffet in the city, period. Been here for lunch dozens of time and they always switch up the menu offerings. Even the salads in the buffet rock, we are never disappointed and always leave stuffed. Prices have gone up but the quality of the food keeps us coming back for more."}
{"text":"I normally don't feel comfortable writing a review about a restaurant after one meal but i feel compelled to write about my experience at Mango Shiva because, for the most part, it was pretty great.

I have seen this restaurant's name appear on Yelp a number of times, i bookmarked it as a place to try not knowing what to expect, and on a whim decided this to be the venue for a very special occasion. After hearing claims of how Mango Shiva offered South Asian comfort foods with a fusion, upscale twist, I thought it might be a welcome change for two individuals who are accustomed to classic South Asian hole-in-the-wall take out joints. That being said, nothing i read or heard prepared me for my experience at Mango Shiva.

The first point of contact for me and Mango Shiva was Yelp and their OpenTable integration for reserving a table. This service immediately earns kudos as any initiative to make the dining experience more accessible and easier for customers through the incorporation of technology and media is a huge plus (and in the world of South Asian fine-dining--simply an unheard of practice). So, +1 for that.

Next, our arrival at the restaurant. We arrived a few minutes before our reservation on a Monday night at 6:00 and the restaurant was dead so we were seated immediately. The interior is quite elegant: chandeliers, hardwood, and touches of darker tones everywhere. The ambiance inside is remarkably intimate for an open but small space which makes it even more appealing to couples looking for a special spot to dine. Promptly after being seated the waiter arrived, a really nice young man who, though he might have been new, tried best to describe and sell the menu to us new guests. I am definitely no expert when it comes to South Asian cuisine but i am lucky to be the partner of someone who is. Fortunately for me, she navigated the menu very easily; saving the waiter from looking any more confused than he actually was (i will cut him some slack though, i don't think he got over the shock of a brown person, myself, asking him, a caucasian man, to describe certain South Asian staples that almost all  brown people grow up eating..except for myself of course lol). We ordered the Fish Pakoras, Eggplant Curry, and the Spicy Thai rice and wow, what flavour! The naan, soft, moist, and delicious. The Eggplant Curry, sumptuous. The Thai-Infused Shrimp and Rice, just excellent; a great pairing of savoury and subtle sweetness. The chef and kitchen staff have a clear standard for excellence and all the spices and flavours were off the charts. I have been eating brown food my entire life and their unique compositions of South Asian foods definitely made for a dining experience to remember!

The only unfortunate thing about the entire meal were the portion sizes. I guess in adapting modern, Western forms, the one aspect of South Asian cuisine that was lost in the fusion were the portions. Everything being designed to be single-serve or satiable for one person can leave a South Asian like myself a feeling a little disappointed upon the arrival of the bill and that unsavoury aftertaste can be enough to deter the typical brown gourmand from returning (although that crowd wouldn't even make the trip downtown to satisfy their appetite in the first place). With that being said, the service was great and the meal was excellent. I can still taste the flavours and am already looking forward to my next trip.

If you are looking for a location that is bound to culminate in a great meal with unexpected conversations, be it from the decor, ambiance, or the exotic, inspired South Asian food itself, Mango Shiva should be on your list of places to dine in Calgary."}
{"text":"A beautiful room with lovely, attentive staff.  The food is Indian, but not the typical cold Punjabi buffet.. wonderful, edgy creations that riff on Indian classics.

I'm visiting from Vancouver and this is the first restaurant in a dozen that's hit a home run.  A real gem!

(It's a shame it's across from that tacky eyesore Flames Central.. what moronic city councilors allowed that hideous light board??)"}
{"text":"The lunch buffet is always great, with lots of variety. Their chai tea is also delicious."}
{"text":"I just had Buffet Lunch today at this Restuarant today!
Naan(Bread) was nice & their Vegetarian menu is limited & tasted average for the price they are charging.Open Kitchen concept is impressive & clean as you can watch the chef live Preparing the Naan(Bread) or any other item you order :)"}
{"text":"Saw the  and decided to give this a try.

Like: Basically everything.  The food was really tasty, a good size and incredibly affordable.  We lingered a little longer than normal after eating but never felt pressured to leave.Dislike: would be nice to have more variety I guess.

The service here is also exceptional! My order had a small mix up, but it was quickly corrected. Overall, I really enjoyed my experience here, and I will definitely try to go back more often."}
{"text":"Excellent first experience here.  Food was delicious and great variety.  I love Indian food and was quite impressed with this place.  I highly recommend checking it out!"}
{"text":"Mango Shiva is great. The decor is beautiful,  the food is very tasty, the service is good, and the buffet is well priced. Thumbs up all the way!"}
{"text":"We ordered the Masala cauliflower and Tandoori chicken along with veggie samosas for appetizers.  Tandoori chicken was a bit dry.  Can't really mess up cauliflower I suppose.

Great service, decent food."}
{"text":"$30 including tax and tip for a mango lassi, probably one of the tastiest I've had and lamb in garam masala with a side of golden raisins, dried cranberries, parsley and couscous (?)


A bit pricey but the lamb shank was large and well seasoned, the service friendly and attentive, the decor original and the downtown location together with the one time yelp discount of 10% made this an enjoyable night out with a good friend."}
{"text":"I love Indian food and Mango Shiva doesn't disappoint. Great lunch buffet with a fair number of vegetarian options. Really good but a little pricey for a lunch buffet in my opinion."}
{"text":"This is a fantastic Indian fusion restaurant in a cute area of downtown Calgary. I ordered the salad (with grilled paneer and mango) and the lamb kofta curry. So delicious and seems reasonably priced for the amount of food.

The service was a little slow due to a large party in the dining room, but the waiter comped me a glass of wine for waiting, so I'm a happy girl.

I've eaten at MANY Indian restaurants across the globe, and this place had by far the best (and freshest) naan I've ever eaten.

I would eat here all the time if I lived in this town. Plus, the decor is very hip."}
{"text":"I'm a bit torn on the star rating for this place.  I'd give it five stars for happy hour (4-6), when many nice cocktails made with premium liquor, beer and wine are $5, as well as several well prepared and very tasty appetizer such pakoras, naan, and gol gappa. Free pappadums for munching. The patio and decor are modern and tasteful with a nod to traditional Indian motifs. 

The dinner menu echoes the decor in this respect. Servings are per-person, served on clean geometric white plates, and have classic Indian spicing combined with Western forms such as leg of lamb instead of lamb stew.  This makes for an upscale Indian dining experience, at the expense of being a little light for the price (e.g. you choose between rice and naan to accompany the meat).  As dinner is their mainstay, on balance I'd give Mango Shiva 4 stars.

Update: the lunch buffet is diverse and very high quality. Bumps the overall rating to 5 stars. Would recommend going for lunch before trying the dinner if looking for a more typical Indian experience."}
{"text":"I've been to Mango Shiva 3 times now and it's time for a review.

My first visit was with colleagues during the Calgary stampede and the place was packed. However we had a reservation, were seated fairly quickly and enjoyed our meal

Second visit was with a friend at a less busy period. Food and service were just as good as the first time and I was totally blown away by the mango lassi and watching the chef make the naan in the stone oven. Nothing beats fresh-out-of-the-oven naan. Delish!

Third visit, I was alone and caught the lunch Buffett just after 1 pm. This visit cost them a star in this review. Despite having less than 6 full tables, service was slow and apathetic. I ordered a mango lassi since I remember the previous one fondly and was informed that they had run out. So I settled for a coke which showed up after 10 minutes. ( grabbing a bottle to place on a table should not take 10 minutes in a restaurant that is less than half full) Then I headed for the Buffett and made a beeline for the naan. (At the expense of sounding like an epicurean ignoramus, I go to Indian restaurants strictly for the naan) THE NAAN WAS COLD. I was shattered. The rest of the meal was a blur for me. 

All 3 visits were for the lunch Buffett and while it's not cheap at ~$23 per person, the food is tasty and authentic. You get the usual pickles, mango chutney, rice, butter chicken, curries and rice pudding. 

This is not a 4-star restaurant for me because of the inconsistency in service."}
{"text":"Went in around 2 pm for lunch, as I work at a pub down the road and that's when I get my break. There were two tables with people around me and one on the patio. It seemed like they had many staff on shift, but they all seemed to either be cleaning, or just standing around. The one server walked past me 8 or 9 times before she actually (begrudgingly) came over to serve me, about 15 minutes after I had been seated. 
Once I was given the menu, she didn't take my drink order for another 5 or so minutes. My break is limited so I would have liked to get my food order in sooner. 
I ordered the butter chicken. The presentation was nice, and it tasted ok. I'm only saying it was \"ok\" because there was nothing wrong with it, just that it was a very westernized version of the dish, and not what I was expecting.
When I was finished, a waiter came by and took my plate, and then the same girl came and dropped off my bill and walked away. No asking how my meal was, or if I'd like another drink. 
Overall, I was not impressed by the service, and likely won't be returning."}
{"text":"Great and innovative Indian food. Elegant place, perfect for a date or even a business lunch. Very attentive staff and the food it's amazing."}
{"text":"This is my favourite spot for Indian food in downtown Calgary.  The food, and ambience combined with exceptional service makes this joint a perfect place for a nice lunch"}
{"text":"Awesome food!! One of the best Indian food I've tasted in North America! Expensive....and don't accept Amex anymore :( 

My fav is the Kashmiri pulao, Malai kofta and the coconut naan is just wow!! 

-1 star for being super pricey!!"}
{"text":"Tried out this place after a few different friends recommended it. Was really impressed. We had the pork curry and the veggie thali (a must try for vegetarians). Flavors were bold and clean without being overly rich or spicy. Finished off with a scoop of delicious almond gelato and a super authentic masala chai. I left feeling full but not bloated. Will be back."}
{"text":"Great experience. Ambience and hospitality was awesome. Food was served well, and was tasty. Location was even nice and it's very close to train station and among happening location sports in downtown. It's a must go."}
{"text":"Food and ambiance excellent.  Service very good.  If I had to do it over I would have stuck with the top half of the menu, which is more tapa style.  The mains were great at well, but would have like to sample more of the menu.  Food very stylish, not your typical Indian restaurant"}
{"text":"delicious! the place was packed, we had no reservation and the hostess appologetically sat us by the front door. it was totally fine & we were happy to get in. had the lunch buffet - great value @ $20, lots of choice and the buffet trays were being replaced regularily. their coconut pudding will bring me back... so good. but stick to water, a diet coke will set you back $3.95."}
{"text":"I ate dinner at Mango Shiva tonight, using a coupon that I purchased from Living Social (I paid $25 and got $50 worth of food).  I would definitely return to Mango Shiva even without a coupon!

I arrived before my friend and was promptly seated and given water.  The server was very attentive and polite while I waited; I also received some papadums (with a side of chunky mango chutney) to munch on before my meal.  My friend arrived and the server showed us the menus, as well as the drink list and specials menu.  

We both started with their \"Dirty Mango Lassi\", which is a traditional mango lassi spiked with rum.  All of the drinks at Mango Shiva are fairly expensive, with cocktails ringing in at $9.04 before tax (is that a lucky number or something?), and I would consider going back during happy hour when they are only $6.  We then shared an appetizer from the list of specials, which was their homemade paneer served kebab-style with grilled vegetables (bell peppers and onions).  I admit I'm a lame Indian-food customer because I love the flavours but have no tolerance for the spice (I lost it when I spent a few years living in a \"bland\" country).  The appetizer was delicious but a bit too spicy for my own tolerance level, which meant it ticked my mouth to the point where I was giggling incessantly.  For a vegetarian main I had the masala cauliflower.  From looking at the tables beside us we didn't think the mains were intended for sharing, but this would have been a great dish to split with another veggie main or even a meat dish (for you omnivores).  The cauliflower was coated in a creamy tomato curry sauce, and on the side there was a zucchini fritter and two yam fritters (not the eggplant listed on the menu).  You get a choice of sides: rice or one of two varieties of naan.  These will be served on the side, so they're also good for sharing.  After the appetizer and the mains we definitely didn't have room for dessert, but based on the high quality of our entrees I'm sure the desserts are delicious!

The ambiance in the restaurant is chic and evocative of India, with lots of warm candle light, transparent furniture and sparkling decorations.  It would be a great place for a date (if the love of your life can handle a little spicy food, that is!) and we saw lots of large groups of friends sharing an evening out.  I think Mango Shiva is a great choice in downtown Calgary."}
{"text":"Great food. Service could be better and the chairs are very uncomfortable but the food makes up for it."}
{"text":"Stellar indian cuisine with great staff and amazing ambience. Went twice because there's so much good stuff on the menu!"}
{"text":"Average food AWFUL service

This restaurant appears to be more of a hype than substance. As an Indian that has an appetite to try various cuisines - I have tried Indian food at many restaurants across the globe and can easily come to the conclusion that the food served at this restaurant is nothing beyond average. 

The decor is nice and creates a good ambience. Unfortunately the service is awful (also appears amusing at times). 

A couple of experiences during my visit to try their lunch buffet: 

When I asked a female Indian server if there was soup in the buffet she showed me DAL MAKHANI (KAALI DAL) as the soup. Even though I was shocked because no Indian would tell another Indian that Dal Makhani is a soup - I found it quite hilarious. Dal Makhani is an Indian vegetarian dish that goes with Roti (Bread) or Rice. It belongs to the curry category in Indian foods.  

When I requested plain roti without butter - at first they served me NAAN (the server had perhaps not paid attention to what I was asking - so I repeated my order PLAIN ROTI with NO BUTTER).. the second time he gave me ROTI loaded with Butter - by then I had lost my energy to repeat what I had ordered in the first place.  

One of the servers even took my dish away while I was still eating (though I think it was by accident) :-)

As an Indian I certainly don't recommend this restaurant unless you want an annoying experience that at times can also be amusing."}
{"text":"Last night me and a friend decided to drop in for a late dinner. We arrived at around 9pm. As soon as we walked in the door we were met by who we later found out was the floor manager. I was wearing shorts which he made quite evident by one of those looks that he was not pleased. He grudgingly directed us to our table with his pretentious nose in the air.

Very soon after we were seated our very pleasant server arrived with the menus and immediately took our drink order. The drinks arrived shortly after and we ordered our meal. Our server was excellent in her recommendations for dinner as we wanted sharing nibbles. We ordered the appetizer taster platter and butter chicken naacos. 

As we were waiting for our food to arrive we noticed the table across from us was getting their food. This is when things went down hill. The very same bitchy queen manager was serving these poor people. He literally threw their plates of food down on the table. If you could have seen the look of shock from all 4 diners at the table!!

Our food arrived a short time later and everything was amazing and cooked to perfection. Our server again was fantastic. We enjoyed or meal, paid our bill and headed toward the door. Just as we were about to exit the building we overheard another table of 4 complaining to their server about the same crabby, arrogant manager who had served them.

This \"manager\" should not be in the service industry dealing with people. If he treats his paying customers like this I can only imagine how he treats his coworkers!!"}
{"text":"Food was good, service was horrid. Booked a 26 person reservation only to show up to a table with 16 placements and not enough chairs. When we asked for more, 15 minutes later they showed up with stools!... Stools! 

After much debate they finally understood one should have chairs for eating dinner and we were given the patio chairs from outside. At this point, we had stressed so much about fitting our guests into a small table that we didn't even notice that they were out of almost every wine on their list \"except\" the expensive bottles, which were really our only choice.

Horrible time, they ruined a birthday - why take reservations when you can't deliver? 

Very disappointing overall."}
{"text":"Great food , ambiance and service. I tried Pakistani goat biryani and it was delicious."}
{"text":"Lunch buffet is great.  The selection is very broad and food is well prepared.  I usually avoid Indian buffet, but this one is an exception.  Ambiance is great and a good experience overall."}
{"text":"A lovely place. The interior decor is very elegant and the mood is comfortable. The buffet has a good selection of dishes you would expect from an indian cuisine restaurant. Servers were very courteous and quick!"}
{"text":"Living in Louisiana, I miss good Indian food. This place really hit the spot. If I'm ever in Calgary again, I'll definitely go back. The restaurant was packed, and the service staff was motoring around to keep the machine running. They provided good service, anyway, despite the large number of people walking in and being surprised there was no table available (reservations were full). I really liked the dal and saag paneer. The mango lassis were great, too, and I like the boozy versions."}
{"text":"Mango featured an amazing chicken dish at the Engineered Eats Yelp event I had attended that I was determined to try whatever else they had to offer.

A friend and I met here for lunch, and I was a little disappointed that they only had the buffet available. My disappointment soon disappeared because they had a great spread - fresh salads, variety of fish, beef, lamb and chicken dishes.

The décor in here is really vibrant, which is a nice change from the dark drab places that line Stephen Avenue. It can get pretty crowded at lunch (why wouldn't it be? The buffet has so much to offer!), but the service is never lacking. 

This place has definitely made it into my lunch dining rotation!"}
{"text":"This place has been on my 'must try' list for ages now, and a group of us finally tried out their happy hour (3 - 6pm everyday, including weekends).

I arrived just after 4:30pm and the doors were locked but a staff member ran after me and welcomed me inside, explaining that they've been so quiet lately that they have been closing between lunch and 5pm. Hopefully this will change (along with their patio reopening) in a few weeks time.

Every day there are three $5 snack options (get the veggie pakoras and butter chicken naacos!), two $5 draft beers, and a $5 featured red and white wine. The veggie pakoras are a great sharing size with individual fried veggie pieces with two sauces (rather than other versions I've seen which combine grated veggie pieces together) and the butter chicken naacos are two per plate. There's also $2 off all cocktails and a featured daily special - Tuesdays is the Coconut Mojito for $7. The Coconut Mojito was great, and everyone enjoyed the other cocktails that we tried too (Dirty Mango Lassi, the Kama Sutra and the Mango Margarita - ask for the version with ginger and jalapenos not on the menu!). 

Service was great and our server was terrific at helping with cocktail recommendations based on our flavour preferences, which I love. We sat in the lounge style area at the front and got to combine drinking with people watching along Stephen Ave. 

Check out the menu here and I'll see you on the patio in a few weeks: http://media.wix.com/ugd/fd3bf3_2eb6dc9be9da494dbb6c3c6558a52598.pdf."}
{"text":"Well, well, well, Mango Shiva nicely done once again!

First off, I promised Cody our server that I would review the restaurant and mention how wonderful a server he is. To be perfectly honest, he really is a great server - attentive and accommodating, he knows his menu and can keep himself together even under a barrage of questions from my then \"I'm on a vegan diet challenge\" sister. (So to the manager who gratefully honored our 10% Yelp discount offer, Cody's a good dude and good server - high five).

Alright, on to the review!

Mango Shiva is great, as I have said before \"Mango Shiva mixes classic Indian flavors in a palatable North American way that is a game changer in this city\". This statement still holds true for me as I had a wonderful food (and service) experience at this restaurant.

The dishes are classic in flavor but not in approach and it makes the experience interesting and memorable.

I enjoy Mango Shiva for many reasons, the price point is good, the atmosphere is inviting and warm, the staff are friendly and the kitchen is open (so you can watch a serious guy seriously make naan bread).

I would recommend Mango Shiva to anyone who is looking for a night out with some Indian flare!

T."}
{"text":"A real taste explosion. Make sure to make a reservation for dinner though."}
{"text":"We stopped in for a much needed meal after arriving in town on a long haul flight.  This place really hit the spot - nice ambience, quick service and really excellent food.  Had the baked samosas and malai kofta, both of which were excellent.  Fresh ingredients and great flavor combinations...would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I went there for the first time for cocktails tasting.... had some food, and I can tell you, this is now my favorite place for indian food, edgy, great service, food was really delicious and cocktails too. I found everything unique about this place, decor, bar, etc. Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"This is a nice little Indian restaurant. I found the food here to meet a nice standard with an excellent balance between flavour and presentation. The butter chicken was creamy with great undertones of all the inherent flavours of the dish. There was a North American sensitivity to the dishes that perhaps watered down the intensity of the dishes but I was overall satisfied with the flavour and I think their dishes bring a broad appeal without sacrificing the diversity of flavour Indian food brings. 

I think the most appealing aspect of Mango Shiva was the staff, very friendly and very attentive. Next time I am in Calgary I will certainly go back and try more dishes. I will say I would go back simply for the garlic naan which was absolutely amazing!"}
{"text":"Every time I'm in Calgary I go here. Their mango lassi are to die for, and I have never been disappointed with their food. 

One of or party had a medical emergency, forcing us to cut our dinner short and leaving us unable to stay and eat in the restaurant. Despite a large number of factors that made our evening stressful, the management went out of their way to apologize and made us feel appreciated."}
{"text":"This is my third visit to mango shiva. My first two visit were great. Food was delicious and service was fast and friendly. Today's visit was enough for me not to come back. Came around 3:30 on a Saturday. There was maybe three other tables. Service was terrible had four different servers so no one knew if they were coming or going. Food took forever to get to the table and the butter chicken tasted like Campbell's tomato soup out of the can with chicken pieces.  Thoroughly disappointed in today's visit. We told the staff when paying and the response was oh sorry. Even the people
Behind us paying heard us commenting and chimed in today say the service was piss poor for the amount of people in the restaurant.   I prefer tamarind in the north in panorama hills and I will drive across the city to eat there from now on.  I would have put no stars if yelp would let me."}
{"text":"A group of 6 of us went for Supper on Aug 4 and then for brunch on Sunday the 7th while we were attending a conference We loved the food it had so much flavor and depth"}
{"text":"It was the last day to use a Groupon that I had purchased. It was for a 3 course dinner. We ordered the butter chicken, braised beef, naan bread, samosas, calamari. 
The issue I have with all the east Indian restaurants I have been to us the lack of meat in their dishes. It's all sauce. The butter chicken had about 6 pieces, the rest was sauce. That was the same with the calamari and the beef dish.
The waitress we had was good. The restaurant itself is large. The cushioned seats seem to be worn with holes.
I heard that this place was going to close  next month. Maybe will reopen a few blocks from where they are now. I also heard that they are going  to open a take away type store in the Kensington area.
Mango Shiva has a great lunch buffet, which IMO is the best value. If you like this place, hurry and get the buffet before it closes.
To sum up my review. Mango S has good tasting food, that skimps on the mains. Lots of sauce though lol."}
{"text":"Really great vegetarian food. Ordered the thali and garlic naan. Super soft naans. And such amazing service. Never expected such a restaurant in downtown Calgary.  And the ambience is terrific"}
{"text":"wandering down Stephen Ave. at 8:30PM on a Wednesday night, my coworkers and i quickly discovered how EARLY Calgary sleeps. luckily this little gem was still glowing in the night, so we decided to give it a go (our only other option, it seemed, was the Milestone's down the road..). swanky Indian décor, dim lighting, and decently spacious with lounge seats up front, tables in the back.

three open-minded stomachs make for very difficult ordering, so our waiter helped us out:

- the PAKORA appetizer was super tasty! pleasantly light & crisp with a good balance of spices & sweetness from the tamarind;
- BUTTER CHICKEN is usually a good gauge of any Indian restaurant, but while it was tasty, honestly I've had better;
- TANDOORI CHICKEN was decent, very tender chicken thighs;
- GRILLED LAMB POPSICLES - this was the real winner. lamb was perfectly cooked and the spinach/potatoes were a nice pairing. i'd happily have lamb popsicles to take me through the winter :)
- fragrant GARLIC and BUTTER NAAN helped sop everything up and CUCUMBER MINT RAITA to keep your cool

walking in threw any chance of having alberta beef out the door, but I would have been so disappointed if we ended up at the Milestone's...instead, we had a delightful dinner and best of all - I see on their website they have $5 happy hour drink/food specials. SEEN. I know where I'll be between 2-6pm the next time I'm in Calgary ;)"}
{"text":"Thank you yelp for directing me to an awesome Indian restaurant!  Delicious, melt in your mouth butter chicken and tasty beef lofta.  All of the other items on the buffet were great including the vegetables and chickpea salad.....naan wasn't heavy or dry.  Lunch was complimented with Kingfisher and I was set and quickly made it to my happy place!  Oh, and I forgot to mention, the waitstaff were very attentive and that alone gets 5 stars!!!!"}
{"text":"Dine Out Calgary (AKA - Calgary's version of Winterlicious) just wrapped this past weekend and I took full advantage of set price dining across the city.

Having heard mixed reviews about Mango Shiva, it was due time I experienced it and drew my own conclusions.

First of all, I must say: the ambiance, the environment, the service and the vibe of this place is *awesome*. I truly enjoyed myself and this was by far the most impressive experience I've ever had at an Indian restaurant in Calgary.

The staff makes it a point to go above and beyond when it comes to decor and service, and a lot of the Indian restaurants in Calgary let these qualities fall by the wayside. I appreciate the effort they put into creating the perfect atmosphere in their restaurant, and I have to say, they are most successful in doing so.

On to the food.

Starting with oven-baked filo pastry samosas, and ending with gulab jamuns served with fruit and ice cream, not only did the presentation blow my mind, but the food blew my tastebuds out of the water. Delicious ,well-prepared, and yes, presented with thought and expertise, Mango Shiva sits in a league of its own."}
{"text":"Good indian restaurant in calgary. 

Went to their lunch buffet. Lot of good options for vegetarians. Food was authentic indian and had good flavours. They also had a variety of desserts."}
{"text":"Mango Shiva is a one-of-a-kind Indian restaurant. Its snazzy, sexy, and apart from having delicious food, serves up a mean cocktail.

In fact, it has a Fridays Ladies Happy Hour that you should be aware of. All their cocktails are half off. Yes ladies! Grab your girlfriend(s) and get yourselves there! Their cocktails have creative names like Tandoori Caesar, Mumbai Mule, etc etc. And they're potent! 

Centrally located just a block from the C-Train, so you cannot go wrong here!

{"text":"I've always loved Mango Shiva. The modern take on some classic Indian foods is nice.

It looks like they are delivering tiffins (a 3 container hot lunch kit basically) downtown at lunch time now. They tweet the tiffin menu for the week(@tiffin_walla). There is a minimum of 6 tiffins/delivery but I think I can easily dig up 5 coworkers to join in. I can't wait to try it."}
{"text":"Our family loves Indian food and this was some of the best tasting I've had. The pappadam (sp?) was light n fresh w excellent mildly spiced mango chutney.  I had pork and I'd give it 5 stars.  Also got tastes of 2 other chicken dishes n were also great. 
Only downside was service.  Took a long time to get menus, to order , to get food, to get check. Our server was very personable. 
Still, I'd eat there over n over n over again."}
{"text":"Mango Shiva isn't the restaurant you go to for 100% Authentic Indian food. There are other restaurants in town for that. You go to Mango Shiva for the pleasant atmosphere, decent and friendly service and the delicious \"Fusion\" food.

Now, normally, I hate Fusion food with a passion. Especially Western-Asian fusion. It usually just means the chef in the back hit up aisle 25 in Superstore and came back with a buttload of Kikkoman and ginger. And for me, since I generally can only eat 1-5 items on most menus in town; it means some very bland and goopy chow mein/stir fry labeled the \"Exotic Noodle Bowl.\" Vegetarians and Vegans alike both know and fear the \"Exotic Noodle Bowl\" all over the continent.

- end rant -

But Fusion is something Mango Shiva seems to do rather well. Were the Vegetable Cakes and Masala Cauliflower dish something I would be able to find if I was suddenly whisked away to Goa? Maybe not, but they were both delicious. The vegetable pakoras in the Masala Cauliflower dish were delightful, savory nuggets surrounded by a tomato based gravy that one can't help but spoon over your fluffy basmati rice. Oh white rice, why must you be so tasty and evil at the same time? And everyone enjoyed the Vegetable Cakes, even one crazy blonde in blue that floated in to the restaurant with visions of lamb chops dancing on her brainmeats. Our server Tony (minus Toni and Toné) was charming and helpful without hovering and knew just how to talk to me in to spending half my dinner budget on booze. 

If you were at the Elite Party in March and enjoyed the Mumbai Mule, they've been renamed the Passion Fruit Mule and are still just as deadly! Also, Mango Shiva seems to have taken a cue from the many voices on Yelp stating their confusion over the bathrooms and have put up signs. Yay! Now I don't have to wonder what the funny looking bidet-type-deal is alongside the toilet. Although, I'm still wondering what possessed the designer for Mango Shiva to okay the wall of giant right hands flicking imaginary paper footballs behind the bar.

Glad I was able to help out on the last night of Yelp Eats! High-five for less hungry kids this fall, everyone!"}
{"text":"I was on my way downtown looking for some Sikh kebobs. Being new to Calgary I could only think of one place off 17 th. way to far for this adventure so I threw Indian food in the yelp app and hoped for the best. It showed me two places near me. This first was no there and the second was mango shiva. 

I'm going to be honest, I have a butter chicken addiction. I mean traditional tasty butter chicken. This place however sells such incredibly westernized butter chicken I would really call it spaghetti sauce with curry powder mixed in for flavouring. Maybe I'm being to harsh but seriously dislike when Indian restaurants try to westernize their recipes. 

Mostly I hate pay $27 for butter chicken that isn't even spicy... 

The decor of the restaurant is nice but the wait staff was not very good... It really was not busy and I felt like the waiter was preparing for a school bus, or an army to show up. Basically no attention or detail given. 

I don't think it's somewhere I'd recommend to anyone but my mom who pretends she likes Indian but complains its to spicy or ethnic as soon as she gets her food."}
{"text":"Try the Pakistani Biryani with goat. So flavorful!!!! The meat and spices are well immersed into the rice and it comes with a yogurt dressing, garlic naan, and seasoned vegetables/fruits on the side. The veggie/fruit side was a little too strong for my taste but the garlic naan was spot on!

I also ordered a mango lassi for takeout. They don't have takeout cups so they poured mine into a lidded plastic food container and sent me home with a straw. Kudos for being creative!"}
{"text":"Food was very good ! We got the grilled lamb chops prawns with kafir leaves! Naan was excellent also . Service needed a little more attention! We were there during a very slow time yet service was less than average  ! 
Cheers to the chef for great food!"}
{"text":"I have been to Indian Restaurants before, not in Calgary, but I can say that this is likely the best place for this type of food I have ever been to. We needed a quickie lunch downtown and I had read good reviews about Mango Shiva. Lunch boasts a bountiful buffet, not exactly what we were looking for on this date but we attacked it with gusto! Service was fantastic - we came a little early and 1145am and got a seat without a reservation (leaving at 1245pm, the place was packed). I was blown away as the restaurant does not look much beyond a storefront facing it but once inside, it goes on forever! We started out with a Chai tea each, very good. The buffet was fresh and delicious, everything burst with flavour and had a little heat to it as well. The food was warm in temperature and the buffet was laid out well. Naan breab, best ever! We tried a little tiny bit of just about everything and ended the meal splitting a little dipped dessert ball that was to die for! I was really happy spending the lunch hour here. The servers were very good at clearing plates in a timely manner as well as filling up your water glass. Now, this place is NOT cheap. $48 for 2 people with just the buffet and a tea each not including tip. The buffets come to $19 each, not a place to come if you are not hungry or just want to graze. No menu service was available for lunch, on this weekday anyways (MON). Still, the place does a great job and Indian Cuisine now takes on a whole new meaning for me. Will return for a special occasion!"}
{"text":"Good curry - had the pork ribs so yummy
Nann - coconut raisin honey is to die for it's so good 
Waitress - really sweet warned me about spicy dishes hehe"}
{"text":"I really want to like Mango Shiva, the food is awesome but being treated like I'm invisible, called me old fashioned, but it just doesn't make me want to go back. The first time I went, the service was awesome when had a fantastic waiter who was very attentive and didn't leave myself and my friend waiting for too long between courses.  The second time I decided to bring family and firstly we were greeted and shown to our table..lovely...fifteen minutes later we were still sitting there waiting for menus.  Eventually the waitress came over took our drinks order and gave us some menus.  Thirty minutes went by I could see our drinks sitting on the corner of the bar but our waitress hadn't come near us.  Just want to point out that there was five staff members working at the time and we were the only customers.  Eventually she came took our food order but still hadn't brought us our drinks.  When the food came I had to point out that they were on the bar!! Yeah, won't be going back."}
{"text":"All I wanted when I came to Calgary was Indian/ ethnic food. I saw some disappointing reviews of other Indian restaurants and then found this place. I almost didn't walk in because all I wanted was chicken curry. Just because it doesn't say 'chicken curry' doesn't mean there isn't. Some of the best food I've had. I am still savoring the spice and heat I just had. Well done!"}
{"text":"Food: 3.5/5
Service: 4.5/5
Ambiance: 4.5/5
Overall experience: 4/5

(1- Terrible; 3- decent; 5- Fantastic)

My least favourite cuisine is Indian. However, Mango Shiva hit it out the ball park and I fell in love with their Indian fusion concept and atmosphere. It's a perfect place to go for tapas with friends, a date, or to sip on Indian/ tropical inspired cocktails.

When I first walked in, I was struck by the gorgeous interior of sleek hardwoods, chandeliers, and the sexy ambiance created by smooth jams from a live DJ that night. The lighting was dimmed enough for a romantic feel but not too dark that I couldn't read the menu. 

My friend and I were immediately seated by the window which was more lounge-like with sofa type bankets and pillows to lie on. Our server was really friendly, engaging, and knowledgeable in the food/drinks especially when I asked what wines paired well with our food. 

Don't expect authenticity here. Their dinner menu is simple (about a page long) yet contains many unique Indian inspired items. They have an extensive list of starters which are perfect for sharing (~$8-$18); curry bowls served with naan or basmati rice (~$20-$23); and other mains such as butter/tandoori chicken, lamb, and vegetarian (~$17-$20).

My friend and I ordered their 'Vegetable Cakes' ($9.75) which were 3 hockey puck diameter sized cakes made of spiced carrots, potatoes, and lentils coated with chickpeas and panko served with a mint & roasted tomato chutney. The cakes had a beautiful deep brown and crisp crust with a light spice reminiscent of Indian cooking. Paired with the chutney, this dish was a knockout! If you love to eat 'cakes' you'll love this dish.

We were almost full by the time our 'Rustic Chicken Curry' ($19.95) came out. The dish had plump pieces of chicken thighs braised in a tomato, onion & cilantro curry. We picked naan as our side which was delicious when dipped into the curry. The chicken was slightly dry and the curry was on the thin/watery side. The spices were subdued so the dish was lighter compared to other traditional curries. It was okay curry... kind of bland... but wasn't terrible. For some people, the portion size is just about right (about a medium sized bowl), but I like to try a variety of items so the dish is also good to share. 

Overall, I really enjoyed my experience at Mango Shiva. The dishes were tasty and the atmosphere and service were excellent. If you haven't already been to Mango Shiva, I highly suggest a visit for some tasty tapas!"}
{"text":"The food was pretty good, but the menu was limited.  The mango lassi was excellent.  The garlic naan was excellent.

The place was a bit more expensive than I had expected. They charged separately for the entrée, the rice and the naan bread.

The waitstaff was friendly, but less attentive than I would have liked -- considering they weren't very busy."}
{"text":"Mango Shiva is a modern Indian restaurant.  The butter chicken and garlic naan bread is consistently great. The food is displayed in a beautiful French style, with all the great tastes of India. The serving staff ALWAYS accomodate you on special needs and requests."}
{"text":"Wonderful Indian food, and staff are patient with kids in your party (thank you). Be sure NOT TO MISS the Indian Lemonade. This is their take on lemonade and it is absolutely divine with muddled ginger, fresh lemon, salt, pepper, simple syrup & soda. Order if you're eating spicy dishes...it will cut the spice down with just one sip."}
{"text":"Very good food and service.

Prices are a few dollars higher than you might expect for entrees.  Quality is high, but I can only give the flavors 4 stars instead of 5."}
{"text":"Super delicious, went with a group so we were there a while and everything was super fresh and nice flavours."}
{"text":"Trendy music. Waitresses with very little fabric on. If that's what you are looking for, this place is for you. However, if you want GOOD, authentic, Indian food, do not go there. This is the kind of \"indian\" food that only non-Indians could like. The reason it's pricey is because of the hip atmosphere and location (which they definitely have). The portion size is small too. I wouldn't ever go there again and always tell the same to any friends/relatives that are heading to Calgary for vacation. The whole theme is kind of ludicrous, seeing that none of it represents India or it's culture."}
{"text":"OMG.. so stunned I didn't write this earlier!

I've always bragged about how great Mango Shiva is (after having a private event here, catering to another event and appys). We treated him to a special bday dinner here.

The food is AH-maze-ING!!! It's not your traditional typical cheap indian food. It's full of aromas and flavours - and all very gourmet. I had the lobster, my friend has the lamb and lam shanks, all soo gooood. One of the lamb dishes was spicier - but I love spicy food. 

We had ordered the prawns and tandoorie chicken as appys - again what a hit! 

Ps. the decor is still in tact and gorgeous! Can't wait to spend summer evenings on their patio."}
{"text":"Mango Shiva is by far one of my favourite restaurants in Calgary. It has a cool modern atmosphere with Indian stylings, and a large communal table at the back near the open window into the kitchen. Always entertaining watching them make naan! The food is also amazing. There is a combination of traditional Indian fare and fusion food. The butter chicken, stuffed mushrooms, and naan sliders are particular favourites of mine. They also have an excellent wine list, though I am no expert on wine. Finally I have always had excellent, prompt and friendly service there. I always leave feeling stuffed and looking forward to my next visit!"}
{"text":"Mango Shiva and I go way back like old friends that me through yelp parties...yep that's pretty much what I remember Mango Shiva for were these yelp elite events. It's a great way to discover new dishes and cocktails they'll be featuring on their menu, but I feel slightly shameful I haven't actually sat down for a real dinner/meal at Mango Shiva!
The opportunity finally came on date night when me and my lady decided to don our dapper threads. What's great for Mango Shiva is that they aren't busy after dinner time and we got seated with zero seconds of time. Speaking of seconds of time, our waitress had an awesome trick: she noted the exact amount of seconds it would take her to bring whatever our hearts desired. Extra spoon? EXACTLY five seconds. Amazing.
Food. The pakoras and the butter chicken will always be a must. Always. I loved the crispy savory pakoras and their trio of sweet, minty, salty, and spicy sauces. The butter chicken is perhaps the best I've had, it was so savory and flavorful two Filipinos couldn't help but kill two pots of basmati rice. We also got the goat curry, which was spiced very well to hide the gamey-ness of goat. Lastly, the spiked dirty mango Lassi, even Shiva herself couldn't say no to that cocktail symphony!"}
{"text":"Food and cocktails were so delicious that we went twice while we were in Calgary. Highly recommend the Kama Sutra cocktail ~ it's a must!! All the menu items you can throw a dart at the menu and be happy!"}
{"text":"Mango Shiva has the cool, classy and casual mix found in many restaurants along Stephen Ave, but they do it with an Indian flare that is uniquely their own. From the look, to the food, to the cocktails, the Mango Shiva vision is thought out as excellently as it is executed. Mango Shiva's menu is creative with western presentations of Indian flavours. You'll want to try EVERYTHING, and lucky for you, they have a bunch of share plates. Go to town on these things, I haven't found anything I haven't loved. Getting to sample different items from Butter Chicken Naacos (Naan Tacos.. get it?!) to Pekora with assorted chutneys to sample is a great way to get you and your ridiculously attractive date (seriously, how did you hook that up?! Good on you!) talking and having a great time.

Looking for an even better time? Check out their cocktails! They put a delicious Mango Shiva spin on some classics. I'm in love with the Mint Julep, a crafty concoction of mint and bourbon whiskey. I also had a pretty good time with the Mango Sling, like a Singapore sling but with mango! There's even one for all you Cilantro lovers out there that sounded really interesting - I haven't tried it yet though.

They took their cocktails off of the $5 happy hour list for summer, only beer and wine for your happy hour patio sessions. This makes me really sad. I can get beer and wine anywhere, but a Mango Shiva cocktail on the other hand is worth going out of my way for."}
{"text":"This is always a fun place to go with colleagues for lunch - especially if you have work colleagues that need to get out of their comfort zone a little bit!  They have a good buffet that will please most people."}
{"text":"I have had a bit of experience with Mango Shiva in the past, but yesterday is the first time I have ever gone there for dinner.

In the past, my experience has been:
- 2 events that had Mango Shiva cater -- both were charity events.  One for Breast Cancer (Aveda Event at the Institute), one for Canadian Liver Foundation (Liver Up Talent Show)
- I had the priveledge of attending an Yelp event a month ago.

Yesterday, I went to Mango Shiva with a friend for dinner and had an unbelivable meal.  I had the Pork Vindaloo, which was recommended to me by the friendly waitress, when I mentioned I wanted something with \"heat\".  Not only was it delicious, it was so tender that I didn't even need a knife to eat it.  it literally fell apart with a fork.  The other nice touch, was a few fresh purple grapes, cut in half, on top of my Vindaloo dish.  It was delightful to take a scoop of hot vindaloo, and to have the contrast of a cold, sweet grape in the same mouthful.  Ahhhh... simple pleasures!

We also split the oven baked samosas (delicious), and I had a salad (fresh diced mangoes were a nice touch) as well.  My friend ordered the butter chicken.

I had the opportunity to try not only my meal, but I snared a taste of the butter chicken as well, and everything was delightful.  The butter chicken even had a tiny beat of heat to it (but my vindaloo kicked its butt for heat - as vindaloo should).  And the butter chicken also had a delightful, smoky flavor to it as well.  It was extremely delicious!

I had the CannonBall Cabernet Sauvignon, and we split the Chili Chocolate Cake for dessert.  A split wouldn't necessary be a fair comment.  I am confident I ate most of it.

The bathrooms there were cool, but admittedly a little alarming.  With my full belly and a glass of wine under my belt, I had a tough time figuring out which bathroom was the mens and ladies at a quick glance.  The urinals on the left were a dead giveaway, and then I clued into the pretty pictures in the glass.  Pretty girl -- I guess I'm not that smardt.  :D

I will definately be back at Mango Shiva to try more of their menu, and my friend said that he can't wait to bring his parents there next week.  He's confident his folks are going to love it there.

Great work, Mango Shiva!"}
{"text":"In the overall bleak Calgary restaurant scene, this place shines. I am biased, as I love Indian food. Some say, true Indian restaurants must look and feel authentic and be cheap. While there are a few such places in San Francisco, I can't speak for Calgary, as while staying downtown, I have only discovered Mango Shiva. And what a gem it is - an excellent Indian fare with a classy, loungy interior and impeccable service. Like most restaurants in Calgary, it is a bit expensive, but the quality is outstanding. I had chicken and lamb dishes here, and all were great. Both nan and rice are delicious, too, and there is an unlimited supply of free papadam, something that not every Indian restaurant would have nowadays. 

I have been dining here weekly while on business in Calgary, and will continue to do so while I'm here."}
{"text":"I tried lunch buffet here a few days back. Visited this place with very low expectations as I didn't  like it much with the ala carte main course. 
This time all my assumptions were ruled out. Wide variety of items in buffet. 
Chicken was really tasty with the mint chutney(mint sauce). 
They covered almost all items in the buffet along with more options for vegans.
Better to reserve the table before you go.
Also they had sea food,chicken, pork in the buffet. 
Best thing was that rotis were served hot which were placed on the slab at the kitchen.
One another best place to try lunch buffet. I would surely go again to this place."}
{"text":"Great Indian restaurant, very good food, 
Nice Bar and decor but not cheap.
Example: two glasses of wine and one entree = 53.55 for one person"}
{"text":"Loved the butter chicken. I like spicy food and they did not disappoint. This is not watered down Indian food, so those with faint hearts for spice, be warned. Naan bread was good, nothing to stand out but was tasty. Overall a great experience.  Great service too, Will be back!"}
{"text":"This place has been added to my list of new favourite restaurants in Calgary. Right from the get go I knew I would like it: Very friendly greeting by the hostess, bright, modern but cozy decor and atmosphere and a nice menu selection. I sat in the cozy lounge area and didn't bother ordering an appetizer when I saw that the main dishes come with naan and rice and that was a wise decision as I was one person eating the main course (it could easily be shared if you rounded off your meal with a small app). I chose the South Indian Seafood curry with a glass of Gewurtztraminer that went nicely with that dish. My seafood curry was beautifully presented and accompanied by a silver dish of jasmine rice and a generous serving of yummy garlic naan. The curry was flavourful and slightly spicy (just perfect if you like medium level spiciness). It included beets, scallops, shrimp and a decent portion of salmon. I ate the full dish because it was so delicious and walked away quite stuffed. To top it off the service was excellent making the whole experience overall fantastic. The icing on the cake was checking in and getting a 10%off coupon on my meal which I used right away-thanks Yelp!"}
{"text":"When Wendy P suggested Modern Indian Cuisine at Mango Shiva a couple of weeks ago during my visit, I was all about it.  And when she suggested I try the Tandoori Caesar, she definitely did not steer me wrong!  (For those naive visitors like me, if you like a spicy Bloody Mary, you'll love the Tandoori Caesar!)

We were also dining with Jennie M (in from Edmonton), and we feasted family style, which was great, so that we could try a bunch of dishes!  We went with a mango salad, Coconut Curried Calamari, the lamb special that evening, the vegetarian version of their infamous Butter Chicken and garlic naan.  It was all delicious and not one dish went unfinished!

We were too full for dessert, but the menu has some really unique sounding options, so I'd suggest saving room if you've got an adventurous sweet tooth!

The decor is comfortable, modern, and Indian chic if that makes sense, and they have a nice patio as well (which overlooks Stephen Ave).  Service was spot on: friendly, fun, and attentive.  Prices are moderate to a tad bit high, but it's worth it for sure.  I'm indeed a Mango Shiva fan!"}
{"text":"My favorite was the Baked Samosa appetizers, the Tandori mint chicken appetizer was excellent too. 

Everyone voted two thumbs up for the Butter Chicken and the Goat Curry was the best goat we've had. The other two dishes are table shared were Coconut Prawns and the Vegan Platter. The platter had great presentation and fresh flavors. 

The heat in the spice was definitely there in the meat dishes and the samosas. 

Excellent service, but it was fairly quiet Friday evening when our table of 5 was there."}
{"text":"The best Indian Restaurant in Calgary. Tried the Goat Biryani, Lamb Chops, Butter Chicken, Coconut Kafir Prawns and their Garlic Naan. Highly recommendedthe only negative thing I can say is that it took a long time to bring out our food and to think its a saturday and not crowded"}
{"text":"The buffet is here is all right.  It's an Indian buffet with a Californian twist.  Eclectic Indian food.  You've got your naan, butter chicken, lentil curry, other curries, desserts like gulab jamun, and western salads.  Nothing fantastic. Too pricey for my taste.

I find a particular painting of theirs distasteful.  I'm not sure why it would be in an Indian restaurant.  Hmmm..."}
{"text":"The welcome here was excellent... we didn't have a booking, but were seated promptly and the staff made us feel like they really valued our custom.

The food was great (apart from the poppadom which was a bit too oily)... we had the pakora's and the vegetable thali... both were delicious.... in fact the thali was supremely good with several different veggie selections :-)

Would not hesitate to recommend and will most likely be back in a week :-)"}
{"text":"Oh god, when I dream of Indian Food I dream of this. Coconut calamari in mouth watering sauce, mango-spritzers and the best butter chicken EVER make this little gem a must visit. The decor is totally beautiful, moody and eastern themed. It really embodies the east-west \"fusion\" thing that Mango Shiva seems to be going for. The bathrooms are beautiful. I'm thinking I've developed a bathroom fetish, because they are worth a trip on their own. Seriously. Those are some fine bathrooms. The service was excellent as well. My only real issue is the price, because I am morally opposed to spending so much on (albeit delicious) ethnic foods, even in Calgary. My suggestion? Take a visit when somebody else is paying!"}
{"text":"Dosa's were delicious! Although if they were inside instead of competing with Stephen Ave patrons it would have been better! 
ALSO DELICIOUS RICE PUDDING!!! seriously so good!"}
{"text":"Entering Mango Shiva is like going on your own personal carpet ride into Aladdin's secret hide away.  With extremely sleek Asian fen shui design and dim lighting, you do feel like you have catapulted yourself to an ultra chic fusion restaurant in trendy Los Angeles.

With that ride goes the same pricing as Los Angeles for your fusion food; it's a tricky thing folks because the meals here are based on South Asian meals but with a twist.   I found them to be smaller portions, delicious but with upper end price tags.  

Imagine tempura calamari in coconut curry, or a Tandoori coconut lobster with a pomegranate salad.  Or how about scallops with cilantro mint curry or having a litchi-honey cream, with fresh litchi, caramelized papaya, and pineapple for dessert.  It's too tantalizing right?

I personally would much rather go to all the way to the recesses of the Northeast for South Asian food to eat good food, for bigger portions at half the cost.  But another side of me knows I am paying for the ambiance and a salivating menu here.  So if you do want to be whisked away, you and your pocket book that is then by all means take the carpet ride.

I must admit once in awhile the voyage and experience is worth the price."}
{"text":"I always come here when I'm craving indian food for lunch downtown. The restaurant is clean, easy to make a reservation and the staff are always friendly.  The food is also very tasty. The buffet isn't huge but there's enough for a good variety and I like that they have a decent spread for vegetarians.   My favourite part of the buffet is the rice pudding, curry vegetables, butter chicken and the seafood curry."}
{"text":"One of the best Indian foods I have had in Calgary!

Check out their lunch buffet. It's very good quality Indian food for a reasonable 22 $. 
It's always wiser to call and book in advance. (You can book on OpenTable too)."}
{"text":"Excellent dinner here tonight!  A friend and I had a reservation, but our table was still occupied when we arrived, so we took a seat at the bar for abut 10 minutes before being led to a table.

I had the chicken curry (excellent, with strong spice) and my friend had the coconut curry (also excellent and spicy).  With the option of rice or naan as a side, we both chose the naan; unfortunately, this didn't soak up the spice as well.  The excellent server suggested and then brought us some rice free of charge, which was also good.

When arriving, we let the staff know we only had about an hour to eat due to theatre tickets; they were very attentive to watching the time for us and making sure everything was timely.

Overall, delicious food and excellent service.  The only reason for 4 stars was that we were seated near the door and, on this cold night, it was very brisk.  I'm sure the front is a nice spot on a warm afternoon - big windows would allow great people watching - but on a cold evening, I would opt for a table in the back half of the restaurant."}
{"text":"We came here for the buffet lunch and really enjoyed all the various curries and other dishes they had on offer. The restaurant itself is pretty and the service was friendly and warm. The food was good, the bread fresh and the curries were tasty. This is a good buffet Indian option for the Downtown core."}
{"text":"Tried the rustic chicken curry this time and had some drink for happy hour. Everything turned out great. They stopped taking amex though which IMO is a bad business decision. You're telling me you have a 30 dollar bottle of beer on your menu (Brooklyn Sorachi Ace) yet you're worried about a 75 cents charge for swiping american express?

I hope they come to their senses but at least the food is still good."}
{"text":"One of the best places I've been for Indian cuisine in a while! The staff were wonderful and I was so pleased to see that they have mojitos on the menu. We ordered an appetizer and a main to split both were fantastic, but the butter chicken was seriously out of this world! The staff were really friendly and the food came out really quick! I loved that they had gulab jamu, it's my favourite! 

The decor was impressive and I was happy to sit at a table with bench seating and tons of pillows with my back to the open air. If it were nicer I totally would have sat out on the patio.

I've heard they have a fantastic lunch buffet during the week, so I'll definitely be headed back to give that a try. Overall it's a great place, a little on the pricey side but man was it delicious!"}
{"text":"Cheers all around for Mango Shiva and their Friday afternoon \"Ladies' Social\" special from 1-5. If you're a lady in need of a cocktail on a sunny Friday, find yourself a seat on Mango Shiva's patio and take your pick for 50% off their cocktail list.

I had the Mango Sling and the Mango Shiva Tandoori Caesar. The Mango Sling was super sweet, was there even any alcohol in there? I sure didn't taste any. The Tandoori Caesar was a delicious take on this Calgary classic. The spices used in this twist made it a top-runner for the best Caesar I've had in Calgary. I still have more research to do before I declare a winner mind you....

I don't want to say that our server was excellent, but he was. Except that he was also fun and engaging. He brought us a complimentary plate of poppadom with some mango chutney and even tried to guess what our second cocktails were going to be. So, his guessing skills need a little work... but on everything else he was spot on.

Next up... that lunch buffet I keep seeing the sign for."}
{"text":"Best indian food in Canada.  better than Vij's in Vancouver. Amazing Pakistani Biryani!"}
{"text":"I had a craving for curry but limited time as I'd already spent half my lunch window shopping, so I was thrilled to see Mango Shiva has a takeaway lunch buffet! For $15 you can fill up a decent sized container to your heart's content! I tried a little bit of lots of things - the pakora is nice and crisp without being too heavily battered, the seafood curry was delicious, the meatball curry was something I'd never tried before but it too was tasty. Tandoori and butter chicken also hit the spot and the featured paneer dish was perfectly spiced. Lots of veggie options if that's your jam. The chef even wrapped up an order of naan to go with my order! 

Overall very delicious, filling lunch. I would definitely hit up the buffet for takeaway again."}
{"text":"Want to eat Indian food and sit on a see-through chair? Well then, you need to traverse Calgary's treacherous one-way streets and hallowed parking garages to find yourself at Mango Shiva on Stephen's Ave.

We had our company Christmas party here yesterday night. I had no clue what to expect, because shockingly enough I've eaten Indian food maybe three times in my entire 24 years of life. (Yikes, that's sad!)

The layout of this place is pretty swanky, as per my aforementioned see-through chairs. I liked the tube-y lights that came down from the ceiling above our table like little mechanical arms trying to get a bite of my delicious butter chicken. 

But before we get to the food, I need to comment on how awesome it is that they have an open kitchen concept and you can see giant plumes of fire shooting out every so often. There was also a delightful man with a glorious mustache whipping up the Naan bread with giant metal bars. I had no idea you needed giant metal bars to make Naan bread, but I was impressed nonetheless by his mustache, concentration, and ultimately the final product of his labors.

ANYWAYS, on to the food. We started off with calamari in a curry sauce. It was delicious - the calamari was a little bit tough, but maybe I just haven't had calamari in awhile. Either way, loved this dish and the curry sauce contrasted nicely with the salty breaded rings.

Then out came a whole bunch of dishes - prawn curry, butter chicken, naan bread, cauliflower with something that must have been deep fried squid and rice. These were all delicious, but my favorite far and away was the butter chicken. 

The butter chicken should have been delivered to our table by a host of angels singing in chorus and floating the plate on a magic carpet. It was that good. We all played nice and let each other get initial servings, but then the battles were one to gobble up the rest of the dish. Naan bread quickly made short work of any sauce left over.

Prawn curry was pranwy and curry-y. The cauliflower dish was rich and zesty. I'm running out of taste-related phrases and simultaneously making myself hungry so I'll cap it off by saying the food was really quite delicious.

The other highlight of the night was my long island iced tea. I decided I'd put aside the beers for a bit and pick up one of these, because heck, at company Christmas parties the name of the game is being liberal with your drink choices. My long island was limey and wonderful. It made my taste buds praise the good lord like a Tabernacle Choir.

Our service was impeccable. Drinks came quickly, dishes came hot and the waitresses were polite and quick on the draw. 

On the whole, based on my limited experience with Indian cuisine I have no idea whether this was authentic or not - I'm leaning towards not. But it WAS a delicious meal for a large group and if you're looking for one of those, it's top notch.

I try not to give away an overabundance of 5 stars, but this place definitely earned it in my mind."}
{"text":"Mango Shiva is gorgeous! I don't know when was the last time I was here but I didn't remember it being as pricey as it is.

I was at Mango Shiva on a Thursday night and I was hoping for a dinner special or at least a drink special, but sadly we just missed happy hour (which was from 3-6pm, I think) 

The service was great (although the waitress didn't tell me that raita was included in my Thali vegetarian platter, when I ordered it so I had two). The atmosphere is amazing. The food is yummy although perhaps a bit small especially for the price.

Drinks are about $11, appetizers are about the same then your entrée is anywhere from $17-35 (which is okay if you got unlimited naan or larger portions) and sides like naan, rice or raita is about $5. So for a \"casual\" night out it can be pricey! 

The plus side is, honestly, the atmosphere-- its super glamorous and when Yelpers check-in they save 10% off the entrees."}
{"text":"Love the food. Will come back even I'm not a fan of Indian cuisine. Very good service, friendly environment. Came in on Friday night, wasn't busy yet so dishes came at a pretty fast speed. Sangria was really good too. Tried their buffet once, won't recommend"}
{"text":"Great service and great food. We ordered a bunch of dishes to share between four people and we all left full and happy. Sad to see the Stephen Ave location come to a close, but looking forward what is next for the new version of Mango Shiva."}
{"text":"I got really bad food poisoning from their butter chicken 
Which is my all time favourite Indian dish 
The meat was chewy 
So my first reaction was the cut a piece open and I found it undercooked 
Very disgusted I complained 
& was left paying the bill 
Sooo butter chicken livers beware"}
{"text":"Excellent! Had the Shaan-E-Saag (kale & oyster mushrooms with sides of basmati rice and garlic naan), which was much different than I was expecting but in a very good way. I was way more full than I thought I would be after eating it, too.

For drinks, the mango lassi is blended with a housemade yogurt and tastes delicious.

Great service all night from a friendly staff from New Zealand, India, Azerbaijan, Chile, etc. The decor is also very cool and different than your usual Indian digs.

Lastly, TRY THE INDIAN DUO FOR DESSERT. Just trust me on that one!"}
{"text":"Mango Shiva is wonderful! I think it must be the most wonderful restaurant of the planet! ;)"}
{"text":"I Really like this place!!... The desserts are the best!!.. And the food is really good!,.. In addition, the service was very friendly!,.. And the location, is good as well... I would go back there, to have some good and exotic food!,"}
{"text":"Not bad lunch - the buffet is pretty good, but definitely a little pricey. I think for the most part they have all of the favorites, Aloo Gobi, Butter chicken, etc. but nothing jumped out at me as spectacular. It's a good place for Indian if you don't want to go for a special occasion."}
{"text":"Fantastic food awful service waited 25 minutes for drinks has to go to the bar ourselves to order again. Waited 50 minutes for food has to request utensils twice.  Great good but need better service"}
{"text":"Great ambiance and pretty decent food. It is also halal which is great! I have been here a handful of times and the service is more or less good."}
{"text":"This was an amazing experience. The food, service and ambience are all outstanding here. The butter chicken tacos are worthy of mention and the mixed drinks are a treat. They also have amazing tandoori. Absolutely worth a visit."}
{"text":"I have been to Mango Shiva a couple of times and have thoroughly enjoyed each moment. I recently visited to try out their Big Taste menu with two others, so we each had something different. Everything was as delicious as expected, and I must say my experience with the lamb vindaloo was amazing. The flavours were quite well put together, and along with the rice and naan bread, was a perfect portion. I look forward to many more visits to this establishment."}
{"text":"I dont normally hand out 5's but mango shiva is amazing.

Great loctation, just a short drunk stumble from its nestling on Stephen Ave to the CTrain.

Always wanted to go in but never did until the YELP ELITE party and regretted all those times I walked by without going on. After the party with all the yummy samples and cocktails, we had to go back.

We went on a thursday, with 4 other couples sitting down for a meal. So not super busy. Ordered out favourite, Pakoras was our starter - chickpea yumminess! My husband and I were debating ordering a second dish of it! .. but we decided we wanted to have room for the main.

I ordered \"seasonal vegetables in vindaloo curry, with rectulance - because I hate when restaurants write \"seasonal vegetables\" - on one hand, it seems tacky - on the other it leads me to think that they are buying local and depending on what the farmer has, is what they will serve. But aside from my pickiness with the name, IT WAS DELICIOUS! Yummm, i love mango shiva and they way they make the tofu! Paradise - and me, im not a spicy girl but this was delicious!

* Im not going to write what my husband had, as after going joined Yelp to start writing his own reviews! Check out NormanF !


The atmosphere is awesome, we always have a blast when we go. Its classy, and the bar is always booming! 

5 Star for sure!"}
{"text":"There was a hair deep fried into my pakora.
They were not really apologetic and hesitated to take it off the bill.
They should have taken care of my entire bill.
Absolutely disgusting."}
