{"text":"This place seems quite new, but perhaps it's not.  The name Koek Koek made me think there would be some Dutch dishes, since \"Koek\" is cake or cookie in Dutch.  The interior is quite modern and really quite nice.  I enjoyed sitting there looking at fresh flowers while eating my lunch.  After we arrived, it got quite busy, and truth be told, it was a bit cramped sitting on the bench against the window.  The food is fresh, and seemingly good quality.  The prices were somewhat high, but probably on point for the area in which they are located.  The soup we ordered was a split pea soup, that I thought *might* be similar to the \"snert\" which is a dutch split pea soup, but it was actually quite bland.  We also ordered some salads, and a grilled cheese for our one year old.  Overall the food was okay but did lack flavour, and if I am being honest I was disappointed that it didn't offer any dutch food.    Not sure I would rush back to go here, but if you are in the area, it's not bad to check out."}
{"text":"I can't comment about the food as I did not get a chance to taste it. What I can comment on is the service......or lack of it. My wife and I sat down, had a look at the menu, closed the menu and waited at least another 10 minutes, and it wasn't as if the place was busy: There was a small family finishing up, another couple and us. Another couple came in and the server went immediately to them. Needless to say, we felt ignored and neglected and decided to take our business elsewhere."}
{"text":"Koek Koek is an amazing addition to the Neighbourhood!   Kid friendly, hip decor, fresh & healthy options plus PARKING!   Their family meals are the perfect solution for those who didn't get the cooking done on time.    LOOOOOOVE THIS PLACE !"}

{"text":"We loved Koek Koek!

This place does a great job with quick service, and is perfect for both a relaxed night out and a quick stop for take-out. The food we got was excellent: an arugula quinoa bowl with crunchy chickpeas topped with super-savory grilled halloumi cheese and lemon tahini dressing (excellent mix), and a trio of salads (beet, creamy spiced butternut, and kale with walnuts and apples) that even salad-haters would love. 

The decor is unique and clearly very thoroughly considered (love the floors and wood ceilings to warm up a largely black and white space, as well as the slick tree common table). The bathrooms are absolutely worth a visit.

The service was the best part of our night, incredibly friendly and informative. Mark took the time to talk us through the dining concept, recommended some great vegetarian and vegan options, and brought us our food in a flash. We ended up having a great discussion about local craft beers, he introduced me to some promising options around the city, and even let me try a few cans of Sidelaunch. 

This place is very accessible, featuring a large parking lot for drivers and enough space inside for strollers to navigate easily. They cater to a wide variety of diets, from carnivorous to gluten-free to vegan. Pretty much anyone could enjoy a meal here. It wasn't too busy tonight, so we were lucky to experience this place before the crowds. 

Thank you, Koek Koek! We'll see you again soon. 

EDIT: Finally had the PA Dutch apple cake we got to go, and oh my god. I'm PA Dutch, and can confirm that this is better than any other version I've ever had. Damn, Koek Koek. You good."}
{"text":"So lunch time, driving around the city. The craving for a healthy lunch strikes and then lo and behold this place appears as we were turning a street! I've never actually heard of Koek koek however the pictures of fresh salads on the side of the building won me over in an instant. 

The place is beautiful. Small but spacious. The furniture design is on point. Textures and patterns everywhere! The place gives off a warm, soft ambiance despite this.

Anyway, the food! We got the Thai salad and Bulgogi salad - not the actual names. Both came cold. But delicious nonetheless. Very healthy and definitely hit the spot. I also got the tipsy tea. Mild tasting lemon tea and I was told it had vodka in it. For everthing our bill cam up to $40+. Pricey but for the ingredients used I get it.

So would I come back? With my budget probably not. Lol but if I'm ever around the area craving for a nice healthy meal I've marked this place on my mental map."}
