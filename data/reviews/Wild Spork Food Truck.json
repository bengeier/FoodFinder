{"text":"Great vegan food truck with a lot of different options - grilled cheez, tater tots, salads, and dumplings. I tried the grilled cheez and it was great.. made fresh right when I ordered it, and I don't even think a non vegan would realize it was vegan. The prices are surprisingly good compared to other vegan places I've been to.. don't think anything was over &7. Great spot for lunch, can't wait to try some of their other things."}

{"text":"I am not vegan, but I do appreciate healthful eating and good, flavorful food. I had to try out this food truck after hearing how good it was and that even non vegans raved about it. The menu is small and focused on comfort style foods. Lee said she makes her own cheez from nut milks. She's passionate about her food.

This trip I ordered the cheezy buffalo tots and the traditional grilled cheez. I was curious how this cheez would be taste and texture wise and wanted to get a good sampling. 

The tots were perfectly cooked with a nice outer crunch and fluffy potato center. They were then smothered in a cheez sauce that resembled a nacho sauce, a ranch like dressing and a buffalo drizzle. They were delicious and filling. The traditional grilled cheez had the same, I think, cheez. The bread was perfectly grilled with a nice outer crunch without being greasy and was soft and flavorful with a hint of sweetness. The cheez filling was more like a thick sauce rather than a gooey stretchy pull that you'll get from melted cheese, but the flavor was spot on! I don't know how Lee makes it, but great job! Next time I'm able to make it to this truck, I will try the tacos. She definitely has a talent for putting ingredients together and I'd love to see what she does with the tacos. From other reviewers, I think I'll be pleased. My total was $14.

Can't wait to make it to this truck again!"}
{"text":"Love, love, love, wild sporks grilled cheese with pesto. Best grill cheese I have ever had from a food truck or resturant."}
{"text":"Best grilled cheese I've ever eaten! More specifically, I ordered the Pizza Style Grilled Cheez and it was absolutely perfect. You'd never know that it wasn't actual cheese. The naked tots were perfectly crispy, and matched the perfection of the grilled cheese. Very filling, and perfectly satisfying! If you come across this truck, make sure to give it a shot!"}
{"text":"Best and perfect place for me!!! I wish I knew about them earlier (before it got too cold for food truck). I am waiting to hear back from them again next summer. I am not vegan, but my husband is, and I do sometimes eat vegan food with him. Even he also became vegan since last year and has been missing all the good food. After eating their grilled cheese sandwich (pizza style- with pesto), we both couldn't believe that it's vegan. We both love their food. Tacos were out of this world; I couldn't stop eating. Cannot believe that food quality of a food truck could be so good! It was tasty and healthy too! The ladies on the truck are also so friendly and nice. I ordered food to-go and they properly packed it for me. Follow them on Facebook to know when they are available. Can't wait for their next availability!"}
