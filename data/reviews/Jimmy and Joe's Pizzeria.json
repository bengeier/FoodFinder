{"text":"Huge slices.... and they are QUICK!  I know I can run in get a slice and a drink to go for only $5 and be in there  about 6-7 min.    I tried the garlic bread for the first time.... Ehh, it's ok.  I go for the pizza, it's good for the price. I am not a fan of spicy food, but the hint of spice they have in the sauce is just perfect for me."}
{"text":"We've had pizza from this location twice (dine in and take out) and each time it has been great! Huge slices, everything is always fresh, and the crust is perfect. They are by far better than most places that sell pizza by the slice."}
{"text":"Went here the other day for a slice and some wings. I had heard good things about this place, and based on the awards and accolades hanging on the wall, my expectations were pretty high. The pizza is nowhere near award-winning. Not sure who is voting for these, but it's obvious they've never had a good slice of pizza. I'm by no means a pizza snob, but I've definitely had better and definitely had worse. The pizza and wings were both just OK. I can't justify eating average pizza while paying such high prices. Ordered a $5 pepperoni slice and they were not generous at all with the pepperoni. I'd rather go somewhere with comparable pizza and reasonable prices than come here. Would only come back here if I had a great coupon or if someone else paid."}
{"text":"We ordered 60+ dollars in pizza one a 16\" and one 24\", they switched the toppings for the pizzas. Theyre response to their mistake was basically \"sorry not sorry\" and then went on to do absolutely nothing to rectify the situation. Good pizza, terrible business practices, order here like you're in Vegas - expect the house to screw you over."}
{"text":"One of my coworkers recommended this place to me. I usually always to Big Boys across the street for pizza. But today I decided to come check them out. Ugh I shouldn't have steered away from what I knew was the best...I feel like I cheated on Big Boys.  Ok well here's what I got: 1serious slice (w/pineapple & pepperoni), a drink & 6 boneless wings in their joe's sauce. Yea their pizza is a huge slice but really chewy and not really flavorful.  Their wings were also very bland. Pepsi & fortune cookie were good. The person I went with also did not enjoy lunch. Especially her side \"salad\" which in my opinion was very sad. Also they charge .50cents per topping (cause the pizza only comes w/ cheese) so my $8 combo was easily $10."}
{"text":"Here's a Jimmy Joke About 'Yo Momma That You Might Not Like By The Rue   Now, here's a little story I'd like to tell, About an awesome slice of pie that I like so well, It started long ago back in history, With 2 co-workers and me, The Rue D. I had a little hunger pang for titties and beer, I don't do strip clubs so let's go here, I didn't ride in a van, down with the man, Lunch a Jimmy and Joe's is the plan. One big nerd who is hungry, I'd go by myself without nobody, Stopped at the store to get food for my cat, Then it's time to grab a slice I don't care if I'm fat. Looking for Dobson, a friend asked why, I said \"what's wrong with you man, are you high?\"   I told the guy who was driving I was dying of thirst, When we get to Jimmy and Joe's I'm ordering first, Lunch special #1 I didn't leave a tip, The cashier winked and handed me my debit card slip. I said \"do you like bums?\" She said \"sure do hun\". Asked her out for coke and rum, She said that sounds fun, Asked me if I knew a guy named Fred, I blinked, she winked and this is what she said,  \"Now my name is (insert name here) and this is my will, I think you should pick me up at 7 so we can go chill, We can go to the zoo and look at the deer, If we run into Fred you better stear clear.\"  Walked away from the counter with my reciept and her pen, I'll tell you when my review is done, no need to say when.  This song is much longer than I thought it to be, If you want to know what I ate, read my last review please.   MMMMMMMMMMM DROPPPPP!!!"}
{"text":"First offand most important I'll be here A lot from now on cause they have EEGEE'S as far as the Pizza by far the biggest slice I have ever received for 5 bucks,it wasn't bad not as good as I thought it was going to be ,had a little bit of a sag when raised(could argue it was the size ) , i like a little bit stiffness and crunch to my crust  not a bad quick lunch spot"}
{"text":"Before my recent delivery experience, I would peek in periodically while my son was getting his haircut next store. I would ask questions about their food or ask for a takeout menu and each time it felt like I was bothering them. I thought they would be friendlier to a potential new customer.  Then I decided to give them a chance and schedule a delivery online so I can have dinner ready when I got home from work and before my son's basketball practice. They have a $3 delivery charge. In the 7 years of living here in the Dobson ranch area I don't think I had ever paid for a delivery charge for anything. If I ever did it surely wasn't a place within 2 miles of my home. With the $15 minimum charge, delivery charge, and tax I was paying over $21 for one 14 inch two topping pizza (without tip). That exceeds Papa Johns regular non-coupon prices (I never order Papa Johns unless they have a killer deal or a good coupon). I ordered at 4:30pm and set my delivery for 5:30 pm which is the time I usually get home. Just in case they came a few minutes early or I was running late, my teenage son was prepared to pay with money I left him. They came at 5:15, which I took as total disregard to my time request. 5 minutes early? Cool. 5 minutes late? Tolerable. 15 minutes early on a 2 mile trip? You obviously didn't appreciate my specific delivery time request. They also never gave my son a receipt nor was there a sticker receipt on the box. I guess my email confirmation is my receipt. No big deal on that detail, just never had something delivered that didn't come with a receipt. The pizza? Not terrible. Very light on the toppings. It's the type of pizza that restaurants without competition in small towns could be proud of but in Mesa (3rd largest city in the state) with plenty of competition it doesn't rate high at all. In fact, it's not even the top 3 on that street. On Baseline road between Dobson and Alma School I would rank Pizza Pit #1, Big Boys #2, 4 Sons Food Stores inside Chevron (which bakes fresh pizza throughout the day) #3 and then Jimmy & Joe's #4.  If they had a $5 pickup deal like Little Caesar's then I would probably go once a month for a quick cheap dinner solution and be satisfied with what I paid for. But I will never pay $21 like I did last week."}
{"text":"I got a coupon for a free pizza from this restaurant (no strings attached!), so I got a medium pepperoni. It was delicious, great crust and generous size. Unfortunately, after looking over their menu, it seems that their prices are pretty darn steep. Not sure if I would pay that much for a pizza."}
{"text":"If this place is YOUR type of pizza (Venezia's, NY-style pies) this is best of it's kind in the East Valley. I am always on a quest for the best in every category - pizza, Mexican Food, gastro-pub, what-have-you. It's family-owned, no corp-chains for me either whenever possible. Give this place a try...you will like and the folks who work there are really good - great service, great attitude, great experience. I got a pizza to go, but looks fine for a lunch or very casual dine. Didn't see any beer or wine...hopefully they catch the opportunity to serve up some great local craft beer and some wines. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Decided to try something new. The pizza was pretty good. A little greasy but not so terrible you have to blot it with a napkin. The slices really are huge. 2 people could share one slice. The price is a little high. $5.50 for a slice and soda.    Even though there weren't many people it is still super unprofessional for the workers to be eating behind the counter, walking around with a slice of pizza. I would much rather see them sitting at a table where the customers are for their meal.   The place could definitely use some new booths. They tried to cover the tears but there are many. All in all not a bad place to relax and have a slice.   The staff was friendly and I did enjoy that they brought our pizza to us instead of calling our name. And the peach tea is fantastic."}
{"text":"We went in on a Wednesday night to get dinner. We preordered a veggie pizza and we ordered two slices of cheese when we got there. The preordered pizza took another 20 minutes after we arrived and the two slices of cheese took 30 minutes!! When we tried to ask the cashier with the lip piercing what was taking so long she completely ignored us and walked away. When we got home we found that the veggie pizza had little to no toppings on each slice, two slices had nothing and the rest had half a slice of zucchini and one piece of artichoke heart. It was awful. We will never be returning here!"}
{"text":"I have to be honest. This is the second time coming here and I am still sorely disappointed. I had heard such great things.  The pizza is pretty good (greasy but decent) but the wings leave much to be desired.  I had an expired groupon which SHOULD be good once expired for the amount paid for the voucher which was $8. The girl checking me out told me that wasn't an option- either $7.50 or $10. I showed her irrefutably that it was for $8. She looked at me and said \"it's only 50 cents.\" I agree that the monetary value is only 50 cents but the principle of it is bothersome to me. Why should I take the loss because their computer system is wrong?  I suppose I find the whole thing frustrating. I will not be back."}
{"text":"I have never had such awful service! We ordered 2 pizzas online and showed up to pick them up right when the website told us our pizzas would be ready. When we walked in we were asked what our order was and then paid for it. We then sat down waiting for our food. About 20 minutes went by in which 4 more customers walked in, paid and left with their orders. Finally, we were asked what we had order. After informing the kid once again what we bought, he walked over to the heated pizza holder and pulled out our order. Then, with no words spoken, he set the order on the table we were waiting at and walked away.  I didn't even know what to say to the worker so we just went home only to eat a soggy pizza with a chewy crust (assuming from sitting in the warmer for a half hour)."}
{"text":"Who ever said this is the best pizza in town either works there or knows someone that does. Because I just ate there and the pizza was bad. But the guy next to me his looked really good. The person that was working was his personal waitress thou.  I've been there more then a couple times it seems it's good when the owner is there. If you try it go to the one on Ray road,  it's better.  O what sauce ?"}
{"text":"Excellent customer service from Glen. Will definitely be back soon. Always such great tasting food!"}
{"text":"Came here today with my family.  Food was OK.  Nothing special, average.  What stood out and really made the food less tolerable is their counter people/servers.  No smiles, no greeting, no goodbye's or thank you's.  You're taking my money for an average product (used to be great every time) at least act like you appreciate my patronage.  I can always go to Little Caesar's for OK pizza and OK service.  Take a lesson from Casanova Brothers in Gilbert.  They are always 100% about the service.  Their food is always good, but the service is what makes an average experience better."}
{"text":"Great for an enormous slice for lunch.   Otherwise, not dramatically better than a half dozen places nearby to justify their dramatically higher prices.   Plus, they stop delivering 45 minutes before they close-that's always a pet peeve of mine, they are clearly more interested in getting out \"on time\" than servicing ALL customers right up till closing. Not like I want to call 5 minutes before closing, but c'mon.....45 MINUTES early? For me, that's a serious fail.  They have frequent specials, but other than a lunchtime go-to, I pass. Too many better places that don't dictate to ME when I can order."}
{"text":"Sorry Jimmy and Joe's today was not your day. Your service has so gone down hill the last few times we have come there. We used to come often, but after today we are done. After waiting on hold for 7 minutes to place a 1 item to go order, I was told it would be ready in 15 min. I arrived 20 min later and was told it was not done. When I paid for the calzone I advised I wanted ranch instead of the side of marinara it comes with. After waiting another 20 minutes I went up to the cashier and asked what was taking so long. She went in back and then was told it had been sitting in the warmer the entire time. She was so rude. No apology. She shoved it at me and ran in back and of course no ranch either. Seems like other reviews have mentioned how rude she is. Too bad she is ruining your business Jimmy and Joe's."}
{"text":"One of the best slice's in town. JimmyJoe sauce is delicious and free! The wings are really good, need to add some more flavors but good things will come in time. This just maybe my favorite pizza place, but It's on the fence with Venezia's pizza. Well it's  worth the stop!"}
{"text":"Good pizza, but the young girl manager berated the pizza driver in public, for all to hear in the dining area, calling him an old man and to get out of the restaurant. Not the way to deal with employees, young girl. Also long loose hair cascading over your shoulders while in the kitchen is not cool. The remaining staff is great and all have good camaraderie. I won't go back because of the young girl managers attitude. Learn how to deal with employees, sweetheart."}
{"text":"Pizza was good, employees are disgusting.  Saw employees making food with no gloves on. When we were leaving 1 of the cooks wiped sweat off his head and continued making the food. Will never return and I'll let Joe know when I see her at my restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is soooo good, my favorite slice in town!  Restaurant is always clean, staff always nice and pizza is always delicious!    So much bang for your buck!"}
{"text":"TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE! Tried to order over the phone today during lunch. Apparently that is their \"busy time\" which I understand, but apparently they are unwilling to take orders over the phone. I was attempting to order a pizza and inquired about the difference in price between a large and a medium. The answer I was given was a very rude, \"you can find our prices online.\" I explained again that I wanted to order now, just curious as to the price difference. Got practically the same answer, \"you can find that and order online\" at which point the woman on the phone decided to hang up on me. You absolutely lost my business for that particular transaction and for any business in the future. Absolutely ridiculous that you would treat a customer that way. I work in the restaurant industry and understand that lunch is busy, but there are much better ways to go about handling this sort of situation. Definitely will never order from here again."}
{"text":"Never tried this neighborhood goodie during the mad lunch rush. Line to the door. Food was its usual greatness.  The staff was happy and getting job done."}
{"text":"This place takes 25 mins to make one slice of pizza on a Saturday afternoon. If your hungry and want 1 SLICE of pizza don't come here."}
{"text":"Have been there several times, this time I got a pizza slice with pepperoni, black and green olives. It seemed like there was a new cook, the pizza slice looked like the slice was cooked and the pepperoni and olives were put on after it was cooked. I also got the free cheese bacon fries and it was way over cooked. Posted on Facebook and twitter but no reply."}
{"text":"When they say a serious slice, they mean it. These are GIANT (and we're big eaters, folks). For $5 you get a slice of cheese pizza and a drink. You can upgrade combos with salads, wings, etc.  Extra toppings are $.50 EACH. Hint: they are really generous with mushrooms, which are thick and meaty.  While the crust was firm (you can actually pick up the monster slice--no folding needed) it wasn't great (on the crusty end--just not great flavor to it).  We're big fans of the slightly spicy sauce though."}
{"text":"This is my 2nd time at this location. It's super convenient and close to my office. I've only tried the meatball sandwich. It's a pretty good size and made to order. The flavor is lacking a little bit, but it gets me full for the day, so I go with it."}
{"text":"Pizza was cold on delivery, gluten free crust was repulsive,delivery driver was rude. Probably the worst $25 I've spent (for ONE pizza) in recent memory. Can't wait for them to go out of business."}
{"text":"My first time here. Service was fast and friendly. Had a HUGE slice of pepperoni to go. Really good, fresh, flavorful pizza. Love that I can get it by the slice!"}
{"text":"I really like the boneless wings with Joe's sauce. The pizza is ok. The prices are pretty good."}
{"text":"My experience last night:  4:56 - called to order my 24\" 2 topping pizza w/the promo 18 wings free. The young woman on the phone was rude and curt, but took my order (apparently this is not unusual for this location). I was told my delivery time was 45 minutes (I live 1.6 miles away, so this seemed legit, given the Cards playoff game and all).  6:22 - still no pizza. I call back and am told that \"they don't know what is up with the driver, but that my pizza is done and he should be right back to get it/bring it to me.\" I ask if they have a delivery charge, because, after the pizza being 30+ minutes late as of the phone call, I have zero intention of tipping or paying that (note: I have worked a ton of service jobs and almost always tip and tip well).  6:38 - I get a phone call from \"Ashley\" who asks me if I can \"just come and pick up my pizza\" so I can get it hot. I'm totally in shock at this request and am already upset about the Cards game (15-34 at this point). Ashley (the manager on duty) assures me that they will grant me \"points\" on the app which basically entails a \"free big Jimmy 24' one-topping pizza. When I get there, Ashley gives me my food and explains (in a somewhat confusing fashion) how the points work. When I asked quite pointedly, \"What happened??\" (as it's now 6:55pm), she seems to actually tell the truth, that they are \"really busy\" and \"my ticket got lost back there\".  Now, I'm a hard working and forgiving person, but there was a ton of attitude in that place - from the first call, to blaming the driver, to admitting the ticket got lost but not actually apologizing.   I should have checked the pizza in the store (I KNOW), but was tired, starving and frustrated. I checked it in the dark of my car to make sure the correct toppings were there, but did not get good look until I got home.  Please see photos of the minimal toppings on this pizza - the pizza which took me two hours from order to pick-up and was supposed to be a delivery (note: Ashley did give me my $3 delivery fee in cash back). Still, there was no offer to refund my money and clearly no effort to make this pizza amazing. If anything it's like they skimped on toppings intentionally?  I posted my complaint and photos on Facebook, only to have a ton of friends say how \"surprised\" and \"disappointed\" they were in this - that \"they love J & Js\". Well, maybe it's just this location, but once I use my \"free\" pizza (which I will go in and order and pick up and show them these photos) - I will never get one from here again.   If you are reading this, management, I would really just like a refund. Or, a second shot at the most amazing pizza ever. I work hard and want to support local businesses, but clearly, I should have gone with Papa Johns (who also is not amazing, but consistent in that, at least)."}
{"text":"Will never return to this money pit. Bought the same pizzas for better quality at a different place made in better ovens for about $25 less  Quality of the pizza was poor and the employees even less."}
{"text":"I actually really love the flavor of their sauce on their pizzas. It's a little pricey but it's really delicious. The $5 big slice of pizza and a drink is a pretty good deal. It's what I usually get. Great place to go hang out with a small group of friends or to even go eat at by yourself if you enjoy being alone."}
{"text":"We decided on trying something new for dinner. Jimmy & Joe's Pizzeria had a Sunday special. 2 - 12\" pizzas for around $13. Perfect for giving it a try.  So Sunday night at 4:42 pm I gave them a call to place my order. They pick up and immediately put me on hold. Ok. They must be busy. Good. Then they might be good. Oh how wrong I was.  A few minutes on hold then a nice kid answers and takes my order. The special and the cheese bread please. Great, It will be ready in 20 minutes. Ok. Thank you.  Twenty minutes later my husband goes to pick up the order. This is where everything goes wrong. You might have great food, a clean place, are close to my house, etc. etc. Good for you. But give bad service, then you are NOTHING. Seriously. Customer service is IMPORTANT. Try and be a little nice. A little attentive. Talk to the customer. Look them in the eyes. Just try to do it. It really goes a long way.   Husband arrives to an empty counter. He waits at the counter. Makes eye contact with every person in the back as well as people bringing pizza out to tables. Not a single one said hi, may I help you, what can I do for you, just a moment please. NOTHING. Pure silence. No nods of acknowledgment that he was a human being standing there ready to give them our hard earned money for their pizza that we ordered 25 minutes ago. Another five minutes pass then someones approaches the counter to finally asks reluctantly if they can help. Yay!   My husband tells them we had an order put in for pick up. The kid looks at the computer, gives my husband the total then my husband pays for it. Then the kid looks up and tells my husband, \"Its going to be 5 (five) minutes.\" Thats all he says. Maybe he has trouble talking to people. Maybe he was frightened of my husband for some reason. But ok. Five minutes. Not to long.  Husband sits down and waits. And waits and waits. Five minutes come and go. Sees people getting seated. Sees seated people getting orders taken. Sees people who got orders taken get pizza. Wait, what? These people got there after he arrived 20+ minutes AFTER we put in an order over the phone 45 minutes ago! Husband approaches the counter while the kid was there and asks what happened to his order.  The kid looks up at him as if he had never seen him before, then asks his name and what exactly he ordered! OMG! Really?! Husband repeats his name and order and showed he paid for the pizza over 25 minutes ago. Kid looks at the receipt, then goes over to the warmer, where my husband saw him place items in there 10 minutes ago, and brings the order out to him. Says absolutely nothing. No sorry it took so long, sorry you had to wait, or even a here sir, here is your pizza you have been waiting for over an hour now while others only had to come in and wait a few minutes. NOTHING.  Husband checks the pizza and cheese bread and walks out furious. When he brought it home we tried it. Not bad. Not good, but not bad. Soggy and the cheese bread was cold. Flavor was ok at best.  Never ever ever again will we be eating there. And we will warn everyone. EVERYONE! NEVER to eat there either. Unless you like a total lack of acknowledgment for your own human existence."}
{"text":"The pizza is huge! Taste great and they pre bake and add your toppings to order. The BBQ sauce however sucks. I'd highly recommend the serious slice! Great prices as well!"}
{"text":"Pizza is ubiquitous in America. Strike up a conversation with any of your friends, and you will hear them rattle off names, which I can only guess has something to do with being in a capitalist society with brave entrepreneurs competing for a slice of that pizza demand curve amongst a glut of supply. Its not easy to decide when there are so many choices.   However, thats why I'm here people. :) I'm going to point you at the lighthouse through all these storm clouds, and that place is in Ahwatukee, and it is called \"JIMMY & JOE'S PIZZERIA\".   Allow me to explain. This place is different than the others. Its not just the fact that the decor and quality of design inside makes for a visually impressive and comfortable experience. Their menu is UNIQUE. Upon my first experience, I came under the pressure of some of my coworkers that dragged me along against my will. Reason being, I was trying to drop a few pounds, and I was averse to stuffing my face with the appetite kryptonite that pizza is to my Regularman. What I found, though, was that I could order a freshly made slice, instead of a personal size or some other portion destined to tempt me to overeat. Simple concept it would seem right? Well, maybe not, because their aren't many places where you can get a slice that is made at JUST THE RIGHT SIZE. There were also combo options, with the drink included, and ways to add a salad and select the toppings you want. Its kinda like Chipotle took off its clothes and became a pizza joint. A compliment I intentionally invoke because of their similarities; and these things are the cleanliness, quality, and ability to customize your order. Well done JIMMY. Well done.  I haven't had their delivery yet, but I do know that they do offer that. Since its my opinion I'm sharing, with the intent that it will persuade you also, I would recommend coming here to eat with friends. Its affordable, spacious, and you can even move the tables around if you have a big group with you.   I will conclude with the BEST thing I like, next to their thin New York style slices, and it is this:   REWARDS!  If you sign up for their loyalty program, you are rewarded with special offers via text, such as free slices and discounts, which I have thankfully benefited from when money has been scarce. More importantly though, you get the feeling that your business isn't being taken for granted. I like this particularly, and I will continue to rewind my visits, rather than fast forward. :)"}
{"text":"The Single slices might be cheap but if you order one of the big pizza's it's crazy expensive. I ordered one of the meat combo pizza's in the \"Big Jimmy\" I think that is what they called it and it was $45! No Joke! Now if the pizza was amazing I would still think it was expensive but worth it. I did not find the $45 value in the pizza I received:( It was SPARSE on toppings and the dough was under cooked. We brought it home to eat but literally threw away 1/3 because it was just crust no toppings...... The photos someone posted are very accurate. Stick with the slices if you eat here."}
{"text":"Super good pizza and wings.  This place is now our \"go to\" for pizza delivery. I like that they have regular coupons and a VIP card to earn points for free stuff.   I prefer the boneless wings over the bone in, but just my preference.  Both are good and a must try with Joe's sauce!"}
{"text":"I love this pizza, venezias was my favorite until I found this place. Their hot sauce is amazing and if you like jalepenos they are actually hot and delicious not to mention the have yummy ranch too! Mmmmm gooood."}
{"text":"Great slices! Great wings. Not the cheapest by any measure, but you do get the quality you paid for."}
{"text":"Great pizza, the cheese quality you can taste along with coupons and the prices which makes it a very competitive pizza."}
{"text":"Look I've seen this place compared to Venezia's and I have to disagree, Jimmy and Joes wins!  The amount of food you get for the price is spectacular.  They have their own hot sauce which is greatly superior to other Hot Sauce's.  The staff is friendly, and the food comes out quickly.  The pizza itself is delicious, great sauce and dough, and the toppings are wonderful.  Im glad they finally made a location closer to Tempe!  We used to drive quite a ways to the Chandler location."}
{"text":"This location is terrible. I've been to the Ahwatukee and Chandler locations and have never had a problem. I've been to this Mesa location 3 times and each visit has been bad. Rude cashiers and this latest time I was put on hold for 7 minutes with no answer. Not sure why I think anything will change. Drive a few extra miles and go to one of the other locations."}
{"text":"Monster huge New York style pizza slices!  This place a great variety of sauces too.  Deserving award winner."}
{"text":"Excellent wings and pizza. once slice is the size of most small or medium pizzas and the flavor is great. The wings are huge and look more like legs. I love the place and the service is fast and courteous."}
{"text":"I ordered through Amazon Restaurants. They gave my driver the wrong order. They called me 2 minutes before my driver arrived to let me know they gave the driver the wrong order. Then they just cancelled my order Instead of fixing it after I waited an hour. There was no apparent attempt to rectify their mistake and I am left starving."}
{"text":"Slow service went to get an eegee's drink pack and it took forever the girl let it sit out in the hot restaurant while talking a phone order and 2 other orders before she returned to complete my order and then it was not even full wish I could do half stars this was a joke"}
{"text":"Pizzas are always freshly made, food taste good, staff if very friendly, clean location, prices are responsible. My daughter's school is always giving away free slice coupons to go towards her school fundraiser which tells me that they are involved in the local community which is a plus. I come here when my daughter and I are craving a pizza."}
{"text":"Top Notch Pizza!  The cheese slice is excellent which is how I judge the quality of pizza joints.  The hot wings are classic old school Buffalo wings with supreme flavor.  The ranch dressing is what it should be which is very important, I can do shots of it.  The price is good.. a must try!"}
{"text":"Called a bit before close on Memorial Day weekend and was met by a gruff girl who was extremely irritated by us ordering slices close to close. She finally agreed and when we went into the store there were over 7 people still sitting and eating, not even close to empty. She was nicer when we came in and she realized we weren't there to keep her there past close. But Jesus, do you want business or not?"}
{"text":"Jimmy Joes on Baseline was fantastic  when it first opened.  Then it started to go downhill.  After a long boycott I decided to give them another try to see if things improved... they haven't .  I  wasted my time.  Lets say that  I got  a reheated slice with a side of attitude from the \"owner\" My slice had hardly  any cheese on it and the slice was served barely warm certainlly not up to temperature.  A lady asked \"the owner\" for some salt and he gave her a hard time. So for a good hot pizza slice larger than  J&J's   go across the street to Bob's Big Boy."}
{"text":"The dough on my calzone was raw. The cheese not being melted should have been a sign.  I asked for a slice instead, and that dough was raw too.  I didn't think to much of it, just thought maybe it was undercooked. Couldn't finish either and starting throwing up right after eating."}
{"text":"I didn't realize the slices were SO HUMONGOUS (even though they told me)! I ordered 2 slices, a salad and garlic bread and it was all pretty delicious. My 2 year old ate his whole slice! lol   My only complaint was there was a worker who kept bugging us with conversation while we were trying to eat. He was very kind however, I just wanted to eat with my child on our mother/son date so it became a little awkward after a bit.   If you love great pizza and HUGE slices well worth your money, then check them out!!"}
{"text":"I am only reviewing their gluten free pizza since that is the only kind I can eat.   I went to Jimmy and Joe's specifically for the gluten free pizza. The GF only comes in medium, which for a 2 topping was about $17. The pizza was overcooked and actually black around the edges. Because GF pizza is usually thinner than regular pizza, it's an easy mistake for cooks to make, so I brought it to the attention of Sarah, the girl working the front.   I showed her the dried-out pizza, all black around the edges and underneath. To my dismay, she said that that is normal for their GF pizzas. (Haven't they figured out that the GF pizza takes less time to cook)? As if explaining the reason, she said that they don't make the GF dough there; that it arrives frozen. I should have pointed out that I am sure it doesn't arrive burnt! She actually said, \"Next time, tell them that you would like your pizza undercooked.\"  How about a do-over and cook the pizza properly?  As soon as Picazzo's opens back up in Tempe this fall, I will return there for the best GF pizza in the area."}
{"text":"I have gone to this establishment for several years, but after Friday no more. I placed my order online and arrived to pick it up on time. So far so good. Took my order (1 dozen hot & 18 mild wings) and when my wife open her box there were only 8 wings in the box, not a dozen. So naturally we checked mine, 13 wings instead of 18. So I hoped in the car and took the order back. I showed them the orders and they said my wife's was short but all mine were there. WRONG. Then the solution offered was to make 4 more hot wings. I said \"No I want a fresh order of both, I don't know what happened to these wings before I got then.\" She replied \"So you don't want this order anymore?\" No I did not. So she agreed to redo the order. After about 20 minutes I had my new order and I was out the door. The apology was perfunctory. No offer of a refund was made. No coupon offer. So since I would have to count my wings in all future orders I will not be back here again."}
{"text":"The pizza here is excellent! The slices are huge and you can get a large salad, a serious slice which equals the size of like 3-4 Papa Johns slices along with a drink for around $7. Definitely check it out."}
{"text":"Had a simple slice of cheese pizza and it was LARGE....of course for $5 it better be large. And I don't really understand why they force you to have soda. I just wanted a slice sans soda...but I guess the cost of the soda is already built into the $5. The slice was cheesy, fresh and hot. They didn't skimp on anything. I wouldn't say this place is that quick, it took me about 10 minutes to get my slice and there was only one other person in the joint. If you're in the area and have a pizza urge, I would say give this place a try. I won't be coming back, I much prefer Slices and Venezia's as my go to pizza palaces."}
{"text":"Love! Love! Love! This place. Espeically the Chicken Pesto pizza. The slices are HUGE so be careful if you order a \"meal\" with a slice and wings or salad or anything- you will be hard pressed to finish it solo! Prices are reasonable especially considering the size of the serving. Staff are always friendly and the place is always clean (a big deal to me!). Definitely the highlight of my week when I can grab a slice there!"}
{"text":"Very good pizza and good prices for combos and great customer service I had the serious  slice also the eegee's"}
{"text":"Pizza by the slice!!!  The slices were humongous!  The three of us would have been plenty full with just the one slice.   To top it off, they also serve Eegees!  If you never had them, I would highly recommend you try them!  It's like having an upscale snow cone.  They're made with real fruit and easily quenches thirst and helps battle today's heat!"}
{"text":"Man. I just made it home and opened up my \"Carnivore\" pizza. Your carnivores must be vegetarian by the looks of how much meat you put on this. I love your guys pizza but what happened this time?  I wanted the pizza in the picture, not the one your competitors make. I sure hope you guys get this right next time!"}
{"text":"A bit of a mixed review on this one. The pizza was absolutely fantastic...let's start with that. If you want good pizza, order from this restaurant. I ordered a cheese pizza and a Chicago (Specialty) and they were both a couple of the best I've ever had. However, like I mentioned, the service left a little bit of a sour taste in my mouth.  I called for delivery because I had heard this was the best pizza in the East Valley -- I was not deceived. I was greeted very slowly on the phone by a teenager who may have been slightly high (ok, I'm judging and I'm not saying he was high...but he sounded like it) and he could not repeat a single word I said. I repeated the word \"Chicago\" three times...I repeated my street name about seven times (no joke) until someone else just grabbed the phone and said, \"Are you saying Lindner?\" to which I simply responded, \"Yes. Thank you.\" The kid resumed his phone duties and asked how I would like to pay and I told him credit card. He told me to go ahead when I was ready so I said \"1,2,3,4\" and he said, \"ok.\" I followed by saying \"5,6,7,8\" and as I waited for him to say \"ok\" there was a long silence. I asked if he was still there and he said yes and I asked if he got the last four numbers I said he said he did. I gave him the next four numbers and he asked \"is that all?\" Ummm...c'mon...is this your first phone order? If so, sure, I'll give you a break...but c'mon.   I waited just shy of an hour after I was told 25-30 minutes (I'm a two-three minute drive from this location). No big deal -- the pizza was worth the wait. Glen delivered my pizza and he was clearly frustrated and he told me that he was the gentleman that actually came on the phone to correct my address. I'm glad I could be a quick one-minute vent for the guy because he clearly needed it.  I hope this review helps those who look for some good pizza in the East Valley. You might have to put up with a little crap but, fortunately, it's worth it."}
{"text":"Took my son there after school and ordered a large pie and a special slice to go. Pizza is good and tasty but aside from being a bit expensive, they are rude. Man taking my order was hesitant to give me the Tuesday deal because I didn't ask for it. After visiting the bathroom, I asked how long it would be before it's ready so I can run over to T-Mobile for a minute, the woman there was rude. The pizza was delicious but a little doughy and undercooked. I don't know if we'll give it another try. :'("}
{"text":"So frustrating. They take your name and number from their caller ID but when your pizza is running 45-minutes late they don't call you? This is the second time I've been here and been extremely disappointed. Prices are great but the service is the opposite. We'll take our business elsewhere for sure."}
{"text":"I feel bad giving this low of a review but I have to. The pizza was not tasty and was almost a waste of time and money. How do you mess up pizza? IDK. The worst part was not the pizza but the Eegee's slushies. Tried two flavors and had to give one back because it was that bad. I hope they can add some more flavor to the pizza and get rid of those slushies."}
{"text":"First Impressions: Jimmy & Joe's had me from outside with the delicious advertisement that faces Baseline rd. The most convenient way to reach the establishment is from the Dobson rd entrance not Baseline. The space that Jimmy and Joe's occupies too small for the amount of business they do.    Customer Service (Greeting): Not overly impressed with my first meeting of the cashier. He assumed I had been there before so he thought my question was odd. He just didn't seem all that happy  that I was there. But I understood the line, placed my to go order and waited for my food.   The Pizza : Oh my fuckin god this pizza is good. The hand tossed crust is crispy in  the right places.  I got the Popeye + Chicken  SERIOUS SLICE COMBO comes with a drink for 11ish $$.  The cheese was cheesy! Delicious    Overall Experience: I didn't like my to go experience but we'll be back for this deliciously large piece of pie."}
{"text":"I went in for pick up today to take advantage of the $28 deal and I couldn't have been more disappointed. I got home and my 14-inch pizza wasn't even cut! I tried to use a knife, but ended up just tearing off pieces one at a time. Not the best way to enjoy a pizza. While I was at the store, the girl at the front ran out of paper and wasn't sure if the card had gone through, so I had to login into my bank account to check and show her the charges. Definitely annoying and a bit personal of me to have to show you my bank account! When I get home I decide I'm calling to tell them about my experience and the girl who answers says, \"sorry, that sucks\" after I explain everything. Are you kidding me?! How unprofessional is that! I ask to speak with a manager and she says she's the manager and will be sure to tell everyone because she just got there 10min ago- highly doubtful with those manners. I will definitely not be back!"}
{"text":"Pizza is average at best. Big slices though. Place us expensive fir what you get. Used to able to order a #1...one slice of pizza and a drink for 6 bucks with no additional toppings. Just ordered 2 #1's with one topping and a dozen wings. Came to $30...that's when they told me it no longer comes with a drink...but hey it's only $1.72 more a small one. My last visit."}
{"text":"Jimmy and Joe's is a phenomenally hidden and small sized pizza place with a secret weapon up their sleeve: eegee's. Just for explanatory purposes eegee's is a restaurant in Tuscon, AZ that serves a \"slurpee\" esque drink that is closer to Italian ice than a slurpee. We walked in and were immediately greeted by a friendly hostess, and we promptly ordered our eegee's and a small pizza. My amigos and I all got different eegee's flavors (pina colada, strawberry, lemon) and boy is that ice concoction something else. It is like the best aspects of the Arctic all in a small styrofoam package that inadvertently freezes your brain for the remainder of the meal. It truly is something special and way less syrup-y than a slurpee. The pizza was great and tasted unique. We ordered the plain cheese pizza as a classic throwback to the days of old and were not disappointed. The crust was chewy and crunchy where it needed to be and the cheese was dare I say it- cheesy. The sauce was beautiful and the flavors danced on my tongue as I assimilated with the glorious slice of ancient Italian cuisine. The restaurant also has a challenge to eat a 24' pizza in an hour which I very much plan on partaking in soon. Jimmy and Joe's deserves much more praise than it receives and I hope to return soon."}
{"text":"So many bad pizza places, but now and then you find a good one!  When I try a new pizza place I always order the same pizza so I get great comparisons.  I get a thin medium pizza with TOMB (my name for it, spooky eh?) Tomato, onions, mushrooms and bacon.  Their's was great, the pizza sauce was slightly spicy and I ordered extra sauce and cooked well done.  Slices of roma tomatoes, red onions and small brown mushroom caps.  The bacon was crumbled in very small pieces and not very abundant unfortunately, losing them a star. The crust was both crunchy and chewy, very pleasant.  All in all, a good find and I will be back."}
{"text":"This place, without a doubt, offers the best and biggest slices in the Valley. Delicious pizza, chicken wings even better than those at chicken wing places (GET THEM WITH JOE'S SAUCE) and home made salads, too.  We've been to all three of their locations, including the newest one in Ahwatukee (unbelievable Coke machine!!) and always look forward to going back again."}
{"text":"I LOVED this place since the first one opened on Ray years ago. Awesome food without a doubt! HOWEVER, we ordered delivery from the Baseline location and received 8 of the 12 wings we paid for. I don't recommend their delivery. Eat in so you know what your getting, are able to confront them, as well as not wasting a tip for a half ass order that got delivered."}
{"text":"Great food. However the girls that run the front counter act like they'd rather be anywhere then at work. Both times I've ate here the customer service was poor. But I will still come because the food is outstanding!"}
{"text":"This is a very rare occasion for me being that I've never done an official yelp review before and I rarely complain when I go out to eat. I'm that person that will still eat a burger with mustard on it even if I asked for the burger with out. I've been here many times in the past and LOVE the taste of the pizza and the Joe's sauce. The only issue that I had was that the customer service that I got was the worst ever.   We got in there and the cashier said hello and stood there as if we were expected to know exactly what we wanting. Being that it's been awhile sense I've eaten there I totally forgot about their single slice pizzas so I asked visually how big their 14' pizzas were (at this point I felt so rushed to order that I didn't see the pan sizes above her head). She continued to look at me with this blank face as if I was the dumbest person on the planet for about 5 seconds without saying anything (and yes sometimes I do dumb things, but dont we all every once and awhile?) Then she said in a rude voice, \"well they're right there.\" At this point the way she acted made me come very close to saying \"never mind I don't want to buy food from you,\" and leaving (which I've never done before). But I decided to stay b/c my fiance has never eaten there.   I was so mad and felt so mistreated that I truly didn't want to eat there and I KNOW I never will again. There's so many other good pizza places out there I won't be at a loss not eating here again. It was obvious that this cashier was being rude and condescending. It was also obvious that she didn't care about the way she acted to the customers. She seemed like she may have been the manager as well but I'm not sure (I heard her talking about potential future advertising plans for the store). I hope this review helps people in the future so they don't have to deal with having some rude cashier throwing negativity into their lives. lol"}
{"text":"Raw mushrooms and raw jalapeño slices. Looks like it was piled on an old cheese slice that was just sitting there. I asked for my money back and they are making me wait for a manager to call back. Totally unprofessional"}
{"text":"We eat here way too much! Pizza is great! Wings are really good too. I love their signature Jimmy & Joes sauce. If you're looking for a new pizza and wing spot, try Jimmy & Joes you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"The pizza was decent, wait time not bad or good, but Venezia's isn't all that far away and has way better slices -- especially for the price. If I was in a rush, I may try it again, but it's not a place I'd go out of the way for in the future."}
{"text":"Nice place to stop in and grab a slice. Also there hot wings aren't hot but have amazing taste! And my gal and I suspect Joes sauce is a mixture of Italian dressing and wing sauce. It tastes pretty amazing."}
{"text":"Great pizza! The ingredients pop in your mouth and are hot right out of the oven, making the individual slices of pizza a steal of a deal. I got a slice of pizza a small house salad and a drink for $7. Not bad for lunch.  A must try if you're around the area."}
{"text":"I used to go very often to their other location at Ray& McClintock. But since I moved I stop going there.  Today I had the moment to order their delicious pizza & wings.  They actually got their own sauce for everything. Very nice and warm stuff.. Recommend as the best pizza."}
{"text":"Monster size, made to order pizza slices (their slice is about equal to 3 someplace else).  My only gripe is my mushrooms weren't really cooked so they tasted a bit dry but all the other toppings tasted good and the crust was nice and crunchy.  Great place to get your pizza fix."}
{"text":"My daughter and I went here after seeing they participate in the Upromise dining program.  The pizza was fantastic!  So happy we found this place.  The healthy choice, cheeseless pizza with lots of veggies was delicious.  They even have gluten free crust.  My daughter had a serious cheese slice and she loved it.  And, the prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Sure would be nice if they figured out that pizza includes pizza sauce. If I want cheese and meat on a crust, I'll go to a Mexican place for a quesadilla. Blah."}
{"text":"Great boneless wings! Joe's sauce is awesome on then. Their slices and drink combo is delicious and cheap!"}
{"text":"Great pizza and wings and a clean place. This is one of my go-to places. Reliable and yummy :)"}
{"text":"Awesome customer service with pizza and wings that are soooooo delicious!!! They gave me sunglasses one day too! Love getting this place during my lunch breaks. Definitely recommend"}
{"text":"Had a disheartening customer experience at lunch today.   Told the cashier 4 times i wanted the #3 special, which is slice plus drink plus house salad.  She even showed me the salad before i paid saying yes i want the salad.  For most of our discussion, she was looking beyond us as others entered.  When food delivered i asked where is the salad i ordered?  She said simply \"no you didn't\" and she couldn't wait to walk away.  No attempt to make things right.    I'm pretty tolerant and would have paid a difference in order to get what I'd ordered.  I also asked another worker where are the prices for eegees, which had a big banner and display.  Rewarded with \"darned if i know.  it's new\". I saw cashier giving others samples of the new eegees frozen slushy, but never offered anything to us.  Apparently it's a very new product here, \"imported\" from Tucson.  Only pricing i could find was for party tubs at $30 or more.  You'd think they might want to push it in various flavors with meals, but the 3 workers with whom I interacted seemed disdainful at every turn.  I saw the cashier consuming two different large cups of it during my visit.  Extra charge for sausage topping wasn't mentioned at first.  I had to ask after initially going for the Chicago \"slice of the day\" and realizing it would almost double the price.  Very sparse anyway.  Pizza was okay after i spread the sausage around, but the lack of customer care makes this a never ever return place with at least three other decent pizza places on the same intersection, each of which seem to appreciate customers."}
{"text":"I accidentally ordered from here - and the ranch is good again!!!  So they get five stars now for good ranch and an excellent pesto pizza - only wish I could buy a slice with pest instead of tomato sauce, but I'll survive!"}
{"text":"First of all, the woman who answered the phone on 9/1/16 at around noon was extremely rude and had not an ounce of customer service in her voice for the price you pay for this expensive pizza. She told me to hold, she didn't ask, that's very annoying. And then after I ordered she told me they don't deliver until after 5pm?   I've ordered this expensive pizza from here several times before and they delivered. And I'm positive it wasn't after 5pm. If that's the case now, they should also put it on their menu. Their menu clearly says \"Delivery.\"  Just another inconvenience from a family owned business, which I try to give business to, who also loves price gouging. I think I'll stick to chains from now on.  Oh and on a previous delivery order they didn't bring me my Eegee - so the delivery driver said he would credit me some points on some rewards program they have. I'll pass on that, I'll take my money back because I won't be back here."}
{"text":"I went to the location on Baseline a few days ago. It was our first time going there.   Service:  I would like to echo the same sentiment that other Yelpers have; their customer service is awful! We had never been there, so we took a few minutes to look over the menu board. There were no other customers there, it's not like anyone was waiting behind us. Apparently, we took too long for the cashier, because she stood there, impatiently staring us down, so that we would hurry up. The wait was ridiculous, seeing that no one else was there. The waitress/cashier brought our garlic bread, and sauce. She didn't say a word. Didn't offer us even a plate for the 4 of us. Seriously? The marinara sauce was ice cold. Do they really expect people to dip their warm food in ice cold sauce? They couldn't nuke it for 30 seconds?  The waitress then brought our 2 pizzas. Again, very impatient for us to clear off our table of stuff. Never mind even offering to help clear stuff off. When we left, no acknowledgement from any of the staff. No \"thank you\", or \"have a good evening\", or anything.    The food:  To be honest, I wasn't impressed. The pizza crust was fluffy, and not at all how pizza crust should be. There wasn't one bit of crispiness on it. It was pretty bland. Same with the garlic cheese bread. Tasted like just plain mozzarella on bread with a sprinkling of Italian seasoning. The toppings were good, and probably would have been better NOT on the pizza.   I'm not sure what all the \"rave reviews\" and awards are about. Maybe the quality has changed since those were written? Maybe they confused this place with some place else?   I wouldn't come back to this place again. I would go across the street to Buono's, or maybe down the way to Big Boy's Pizza. The quality is much better at those other places, and they acknowledge you, and treat you like a WELCOME customer, and not someone who came in to bother the staff and make them actually work."}
{"text":"I dig it. Not quite as much as Venezia's (I prefer V's crust), but it's good stuff. The sauce has a kick, which I like. The slice special is HUGE, I can't even finish one without feeling sick. Really good value for the price. I love their boneless wings in \"Joe's sauce\". I love the Ikea pizza cutters they give you with your slice so much, that I went and bought one for my kitchen! Nice quirky touch with the fortune cookies too.   They have a stamp card so you can earn a free slice. I am now a regular here because it's closer to my house than V's and the boneless wings rock! Only disappointment is that they are not open late enough. Local pizza place owners if you are reading this, please stay open later so we don't have to settle for evil Pizza Hut or Domino's."}
{"text":"My coworkers and I come here every chance we get and get the serious slice.  I also get a 16 inch every so often to take home.  We really like the flavor of the sauce and cheese. My nephew from Tucson introduced us to this pizza place because he really likes it also!  Another great thing about it is the Egees!  We only used to get them in Tucson and now we can get them here.  Always have had great service too!"}
{"text":"So I love the pizza and salads here. The crust is chewy and the sauce is great. BUT I despise the customer service. We have been coming here for over a year.  Literally every time we have been here they are rude or short , and VERY un accommodating  Plus they are one of those places that charge extra for every little thing it so annoying"}
{"text":"Yummm... NY style pizza,  and it's served by the slice...HUGE slice! I got the serious slice with 6 wings and a drink,  and it's more than enough to fill me up.   But in the grand scheme of NY style Jimmy and Joe's is a 4 star for stingy sauce and use of convection insted of wood ovens.   Don't get me wrong, their pizza sauce is good,  but it's always spread so thin its hard to taste.  The crust is a thin stretched hand tossed, and it's the best part of the pizza.  I recommend dipping the left over crust in the Jimmy and Joe's sauce they give you.   The wings are deep fried and tossed in a thousand Island based dressing,  mild but tasty. Good pizza,  good wings, I'll be back."}
{"text":"I was really excited when I was handed a coupon at MCC for a free Serious Slice. No student in the right mind would pass up free food, so I high-tailed it to Jimmy and Joe's with my boyfriend, and immediately regretted my decision. The girl at the front counter was rude, very apparently rolling her eyes at us for not ordering drinks or toppings. I was astounded that this woman actually expected most college students to order more than what was covered by the coupon. Even more so, If you want to attract customers with free coupons, don't treat them with bad service on their first time in!   I didn't think it could get worse until I got my food. I tried to penetrate the crust with the dull pizza cutter I was handed but had to settle for awkwardly cut, chewy, flavorless bits of pizza.   Not even worth the free coupon."}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  The slice of pizza that you get for their meal deals is huge and is sure to fill you up.  I would recommend that everyone try Jimmy & Joe's as it is a great slice of pizza and the people are really nice.  You never have to wait to long and Amy is very sweet and welcoming."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite restaurant.  They feature a giant single slice of pizza and a soda for 5 bucks. And when I say giant, I mean giant!  The Pizza is new york style with a hint of heat in the sauce. Great stuff. The Wings are also excellent!  My Wife loves their Calzones as well.  The store is nice  but too small.. so days at lunch you can't get a table, but hey, if that's the only complaint they are doing something right!"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE! I have tried Jimmy and Joe's a couple times now and both times I've been unhappy. The first time was several months ago. I was visiting my mother in Mesa as I live in Glendale and was asked to pick up the ordered Pizza. I showed up to the location when the pizza was supposed to be ready and ended up waiting for 15 minutes with no explanation or reason why it wasn't ready. Yesterday I came down to Mesa again, this time with whole family. The kids were getting hungry so I decided to order pizza. This order was problematic from start to finish. First I was placed on hold for more than five minutes. Then the guy who took my order kept saying what after everything I said and got my card number wrong. Then our food took about an hour to be delivered. The owner (Terry) was informed and has done nothing!  DO NOT EAT HERE!"}
{"text":"So I've been by this place at least 1,000 times and always mean to stop in for an Eegee's (sign in the window says they have Eegee's .. a Tucson summer favorite) .. well today I stopped by .. fingers crossed that I could get a party pack for a work potluck !!   And lucky me they sell individual servings in lots of flavors and also party packs that serve 25-50 people!! Omg!! Yes!!  Service was super friendly and fast!! And of course everyone loved Eegee's at work.. I feel like we have the same baked goods every potluck and it's 107 today in phx and a nice cold Eegee's is a definite must when it's that hot!!  I got the strawberry flavor party pack for work and the single size orange crush for myself! So glad I stopped by and I told everybody where they can get their Eegee's fix locally!"}
{"text":"First time here got to say...was very very good..think I found my new pizza joint!..staff very friendly well some of them ..love it!..Didnt finish my review from last time I was here that's why it starts the way it says. But what I said last time is the same  love this place!..by the way I got a free slice with the points they give you!!!!...they do deliver also!!..and the same person that is not very nice got our order. she just has a face that she doesn't want to be working just a little rude. But other than that that person won't stop us from coming back...this is our second time here!.."}
{"text":"Jimmy & Joe's is a nice, casual place to grab a slice and other stuff for an easy dinner night. Their gigantic slices are made with solid ingredients that leave you satisfied. Not only is the pizza delicious, but it makes for a cheap date night - very affordable ;)   In summary, if you want great pizza and you don't want to change out of your sweats, Jimmy & Joe's is a place where you can have your dignity and eat it too.  Bravo, Jimmy & Joe's!"}
{"text":"Normally I would be giving Jimmy & Joes 5 stars, but this specific location constantly disappoints. The first problem is the girls who work the front counter. They always seem to be in a bad mood and uninterested in their jobs. Between multiple visits we have watched them text, chat with other friends, one even left the counter to make out with her boyfriend behind the soda machine. Half the time pizza comes out soggy unlike the other locations. Tonight the kid behind the counter got my boyfriends order wrong, and instead of giving him a new slice they just tore off the wrong toppings off and threw the new topping on the same slice and reserved it to him. From now on we will drive a little bit further to the Chandler or Ahwatukee location."}
{"text":"I've been coming to JJP for over 10 years now and it still doesn't disappoint. Prices over the years have gone up, but it's to be expected with inflation. Pizza quality is still amazing and I have to have the Joes sauce with it. Recommend to all."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! If you're looking for a small but great pizza joint this is the place. Eat your pizza with the hot sauce... It's amazing!!"}
{"text":"Not sure why this place doesn't have five stars? The pizza here is great, I find myself craving it often. The pizzas are HUGE and the staff is usually a few young kids who know what they're doing. They're pretty fast, the area is pretty clean. Did I mention that the pizza is great!? You definitely need to try it, it'll be a bang for your buck."}
{"text":"Freshly made pizza and extremely large slices! Decent prices and cool place if you have a few minutes to sit and chill. The slices are about huge and about the size of 2 slices. Plenty of options for topping and they also have a vegan type pizza for the vegans out there."}
{"text":"Confession time! I am a sucker for huge, greasy slices of pizza. Jimmy and Joe's pizza is all that and more. That goes double for huge, greasy slices of pizza that you need a pizza cutter to eat with chunks of meatball on top.  I'll be honest when I say that the first time I saw the price of their Serious Slice with one topping, I did balk a little bit. But considering you get what would essentially be the equivalent of multiple slices in one glorious, greasy triangle served on it's own pizza pan, it's well worth the price."}
{"text":"Really good pizza joint, since its right next to my house, it makes a great option. The pizza  slice is huge and the wings are tasty, I get the special #2 and that fills me up everytime!"}
{"text":"I just ate a massive slice of the Gourmet Cheese pizza. It was amazing, some might even say life changing."}
{"text":"My husband and I have become regular fans of Jimmy and Joe's.  They have Gluten options if needed.  Previously, it was believed I was gluten intolerant but it was found I'm not.  Their slice could feed two easily and for the price it is well worth it.  I'm not a huge fan of their wings because they seem to just put a bunch of sauce on them and call it done.  Their salads are really good and reasonable priced as well.  If you are looking for a quick inexpensive pizza joint this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Ordered and was told 45 minutes, another 45 minutes after sitting there I was told it was in the oven. The customer service here is absolutely horrendous which is very disappointed because the food is always excellent."}
{"text":"I would rather eat frozen pizza!  I got the serious slice.  I went with plain old cheese because I figured who can mess that up?  Well, apparently they were up for that challenge. If there was sauce on the crust (which was honestly the best part of the pizza) I couldn't find any!  It was completely dry and I couldn't find the cheese either.  I use to have lunch here at my previous job and always enjoyed it but apparently they have a new \"chef\" or have just given up.  I gave two stars because if you are looking for quantity for a decent price you will get that. But if you are looking for quality... Keep driving down the road."}
{"text":"We have visited the  ahwatukee location twice.  The first time the toppings were sparse but the wings were good.  The second time the  toppings were wrong  on our takeout pizza and they did not show us the pizza as they normally did. We did not realize until we were home and did not call them to complain. Overall their wings are better than you would get at a chain but their pricing on pizza, minimal toppings  and lack to detail will keep this from being our pizza place."}
{"text":"pretty good pizza. Not my favorite but I would eat there again if somebody else wanted to. their largest pizza is comically large."}
{"text":"Came here to have lunch with some friends and their pizza slices are huge!  I would suggest the #2 with Joe's sauce, you won't be disappointed.  One day, when I get ballsy and hungry I want to try their food challenge!  Hopefully my partner can hang for that t-shirt and bragging rights.  Next time in I'm the area, I will definitely grab some pizza."}
{"text":"For two slices of pizza, one pepperoni and one plain, and small Eegee and two drinks we spent $18. I read the reviews beforehand and asked for my pizza well-done and was given an extremely burnt pizza. I came here with my fiancé on my 30 minute lunch break and it took over 15 minutes to receive our order and then once we received it, it didn't taste good. I had my share my fiancé's slice because mine was inedible and I didn't have enough time to wait for another slice so I didn't even bother. I also didn't enjoy the taste of the Eegee, I ordered (pretty sure) half mango and half pina colada and I guess I was expecting it to be like a Ralph's Italian Ice but it was very tart. I ended up just tossing it out once I got back to work. Even though I'm still new to Arizona I know full and well the best Arizona pizza will NEVER live up to mediocre NY pizza but this was far from the best pizza I've had in Arizona. The staff was friendly and the customer service was nice so I'll give them that but I was not pleased with the food I ate here whatsoever."}
{"text":"Date night took a bad turn pretty quick when we decided on this place.  I'd seen it a few times but never gave it a chance until today.  There was some random guy outside asking for food, which the group before us decided to help.  We decided to order the 16\" three topping for $15.95 special.   The cashier (tattooed rude guy named Chris I think) didn't welcome us or ask what we wanted he just stood at the register and stared.   I said hello... No response.   As I placed my order he said \"there isn't a special for that price.\"   I didnt understand what he meant because it's just what I read off of the menu, so I joked and said \"well maybe it's special to me.\"   He said \"yeah, you can't just order one pizza, you have to order another for $5 to get that price.\"  I told him that the sign said that the 16\" three topping was only $15.95, nothing else on or around it said I had to buy two pizzas.   He said \"I don't think the system will let me do that,  but, oh never mind, that will be $17.\"  Then he asked if it was for here or to go.   My girl and I decided to take it to go.  I haven't even tried their pizza yet and I have a bad taste in my mouth.   Maybe instead of acting like you don't want to be there you could act like a professional and treat your customers with the same respect you get from them.  Save your time and money,  go somewhere you will be appreciated. It's this kind of rude service that ruins the neighborhood economy and makes it hard to support your local businesses."}

{"text":"HACKS! Be careful if you have a food allergy and you eat here!!!! I had one of their Grandma Blacks cookies which was loaded with walnuts, which I am allergic to. After eating the cookie I went into anaphylactic shock and was hospitalized for three days. There was NO mention anywhere in this restaurant on Baseline road of walnuts being used in any of their products. Not on the menus, not on the website, not on the damn wrapper for the cookie. When I approached the owner Terry Black about getting partial compensation for the thousands of dollars of hospital bills, I was met with little sympathy. Not even an apology. I can understand the owner not wanting to fork out the dough, and I even understand that there is no hard law in AZ that states you have to list allergens on your food products. But in this age of information, business ethics and customer service is everything and unfortunately this establishment LACKS just that. Years later and they still don't have any sort of allergy warnings on their menus or website. The day after my incident, the counter girl put a hand written note on the cookie jar that said 'may contain nuts'. That note was on for a day, tops! I am no longer a customer. These guys are poor excuses for restauranteurs. Stay away! Your life may depend on it if you have a food allergy."}
{"text":"Huge slice and 6 wings for under $10. That by itself is a win. As a bonus, its also really good. Stiff competition with Big Boys within walking distance. Gonna be gard to pick a place to get a slice drom now on."}
{"text":"There is not much to say that hasn't already been said about this place. It is one of the better pizzerias in the Mesa.   I have gone here quite a few times, usually stopping in for a slice. These slices are amazing! Some of the biggest single pizza slices that I have ever seen and not very expensive at all. They normally load on the toppings pretty well, not skimping nor overloading, but when you just buy a slice, toppings never stick onto the pizza, and here they seems to just sadly lay on top of a delicious slice. It is much better to just stick with a basic one if you want a slice and something crazier if you get a whole pizza.   One sad part is they have some of the smallest wings I have ever seen. I am not the most knowledgeable when it comes to wings, but I have had my fair share and these were by far the smallest wings I have ever eaten. Not sure if they were just from the runt chickens of the pack or something. I've actually tried them on multiple times, thinking I may have had bad luck the first time, but again, I thought they were below-average on their size. Sad, since the barbecue sauce was DELICIOUS!  A good place with some pretty decent lunch and daily deals."}
{"text":"Best slice I've had in a minuet can't wait to go back it was so fresh and service was great!!"}
{"text":"Well we just finished eating last nights leftovers thanks to the poor service we just received. I ordered a pizza online and received a confirmation email that it would take 45 minutes. About 5 minutes after these guys were due to be knocking on my door with a pizza in hand I received a phone call. They called to let me know that they don't have a delivery driver tonight and asked if I could come pick my pizza up or would I like a refund. I agreed to pick it up since we were ready for dinner and we live only about 2 miles away. The guy on the phone said he would refund my delivery charge of $3 when I get there. I said I'll be there in 5 minutes. He said, \"wait we didn't actually cook the pizza yet so it would actually be another 30 minutes until it was ready\". Wow, really?! He said we have been swamped. I said nevermind and just process the refund. He said no problem and I should call back in a few days if I don't get the refund. I let him know that was not okay and I wanted an email confirmation of the refund. He said he will ask somebody to do that. I asked to speak to the manager and was told they don't have a manager on duty right now, but the owner is here. I said okay can I speak to the owner. I get put on hold. Well the owner sends the guy back on the phone to tell me that he will email me a confirmation. I was nice to the guy since he was obviously just the messenger. What a horrible experience. Horrible service. No apology. What should have happened was ..... They should have called shortly after the order was placed. They should have prepared the pizza. They should have a back up plan for delivery. Maybe the owner should have delivered the pizza. They should have said sorry. They should have a manger on duty. And most of all the owner of the business should have taken 2 minutes to apologize for the inconvenience and had the common sense to want to speak to one of his/her customers on the phone."}
{"text":"Mediocre, undistinguished pizza. I would be surprised to find olive oil in their kitchen. The store had 3 underworked teens behind the counter and one overworked cook in the kitchen. There were a party of 2 waiting for a take out order, me waiting for take out, and a couple who were already eating. I waited 20 minutes for a \"slice\" of pizza. There are too many other great options in the valley for excellent pizza. I won't be returning. I guess sweat pants are part of the dress code at Jimmy and Joe's."}
{"text":"When you first walk in the prices set you back a little, seeing as one slice and a drink run about five bucks. But take a look at the pictures on here before you leave due to pricing, because their serious slices are seriously huge. It did take a little to come out, but it was definitely worth it when it got there.  It was the best pizza I've had in Phoenix, by far."}
{"text":"Today I received a text for a serious slice with a crispy crust and extra cheese . . . I received a burnt pizza with cheese droplets"}
