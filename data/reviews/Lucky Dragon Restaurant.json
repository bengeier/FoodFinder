{"text":"I love the food here. One of the best chinese restaurants in the area. The food is always fresh. The service here is great and fast."}
{"text":"Thought this restaurant was a great addition to the area.... unfortunately the take out and delivery orders are hardly ever packed correctly and 9/10 time are missing dishes."}
{"text":"I LOVE their food always HOT and FRESH. Always friendly face/voice and FAST delivery if its going to be delayed you are told. I hope they move back to the neighbourhood. Regardless they still deliver to their old customers!! They make fried noodles perfect and yummy chicken wings!!"}
{"text":"Hot fresh Chinese food is served fast at a reasonable price. It's a plain looking place but food is anything but plain. Specialize in spicy cabbage rice, spicy cod fish with cabbage and sizzling hot pepper beef."}
{"text":"Totally disgusted! Buyer Beware!  I was over their the other night picking up take-out and across the counter was a brown/black creepy crawly... a ROACH.  Totally disgusted. Never Ever Eat There."}
