{"text":"Service was exceptional and friendly.  Food was outstanding.  Portion size was generous and the menu seasonal and fresh.  Great atmosphere, a good find for us!"}
{"text":"C'était très bon, mais un peu chers pour ce que c'est. On a eu un bon service et il y a une bonne atmosphère."}
{"text":"Every morsel we ate caused a party in our mouths. You must try the marscarpone cheesecake. Leave room in your bellies!!"}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant!!! Coming from the east end of Montreal and definitely will be back. We were a group of around 40 people with a full menu selection. Every dish came out in a timely well presented manner, service was amazing, and the food just topped off the night. Had the opportunity to try various starters as well as many main dishes due to it being a family event and each dish was one better than the other!!! I will definitely be back to this restaurant and next time should be different since their menu changes weekly... Not to mention the desserts that just ended the night in a very nice way! I would Definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone and everyone that want a dining experience they will never forget."}
{"text":"Outstanding. Service, decor and food all top notch. Filet minion is on par with any premium steak house in Montreal."}
{"text":"The food! The service! The wine list! The ambiance! Wow!  I never give 5 stars, but this place is one of the only places worth 5 stars.  Every dish I've ever had here had been wonderful.  I do however highly recommend the braised beef ravioli.  It's heaven on a plate. If there is a place worth visiting, this is it."}
{"text":"Truly amazing dining experience.  If you want to take your girlfriend or wife to a nice cozy restaurant, this is the place.  The food is amazing and the service is far above what would be expected in a restaurant at this locale.  All of the staff are very professional and know their jobs very well.  They have many specials each week, if not each day.  Their menu is full of interesting dishes that often change.  So if there is something you had that you really liked, call and make sure they have it on the menu that week.  I had their Filet Mignon this past trip and it was perfectly prepared and buttery smooth.  This is a must visit every time I come to the West Island."}
{"text":"This is the only Italian place I have enjoyed in all of Canada.  The food is good and the service is excellent."}
{"text":"First time here and had a wonderful dinner. Stephanie was our waitress and she was great with service and knowing all the specials and wines. Had the lamb shank special and it was fall off the bone delicious with a rich sauce. We also had the homemade sausage for an appetizer and I do wish the serving size was a little larger but it was very good. I'll be back when I am in the area."}
{"text":"I always stop by La Verita when I visit Montreal.  Great service and great food!  I recommend the lobster ravioli, the filet mignon, and the veal tortellini.  For dessert, the espresso creme brulee is a must."}
{"text":"Decided to give La Verita a try after reading all the rave reviews. Can't believe I was missing out all these years!! The food is cooked to perfection, and the service surpassed every fine dining restaurant I have ever been to! The food is a little more pricey thank your average Italian resto but it is well worth it. My husband had the ricotta and spinach stuffed ravioli $18 and I had the 8 oz beef bavette $28, both were incredible!! Also tried the special appetizer of buratta with hazelnut bread and a balsamic glaze $26, which is now my new fave cheese. Had the tiramisu for dessert which was prob my least favorite part of the meal just because I found it to be a little heavy on the alcohol taste but other than that, the night was perfect, can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I got to Montreal - and specifically this area - quite often for work.  If I am entertaining customers, I will typically take them downtown because of the variety and quality of the restaurants.  This area is more suburban, and the restaurant life is more family.  Tonight, I went to La Verita for the first time and I was blown away.  From the outside, it looks like another chain restaurant in a strip-mall parking lot.  Once, you enter you are transported to a hip Italian osteria.  The place is big inside, but tonight was a nice summer evening, so we sat outside on the terrace.  One would honestly not know that they are in a parking lot because of the trees/plants surrounding the patio.  There are also umbrellas for sun and inclement weather, as well as patio heaters for cooler times.  Our server, Johnny, was attentive all night and did a good job of selling us on the specials.  I split a 48 oz tomahawk steak special with my customer.  It was served with delicious spaghetti pasta  and roasted vegetables, both in an olive oil/herb coating.   My customer requested medium well to well, which Johnny advised him to steer more towards medium.  I ate everything with pink (or red) and my customer enjoyed the remaining medium cooked steak.  It was delicious!  My coworker devoured the lamb shanks, served with roasted potatoes and asparagus.  With the proximity to the farmers markets  - literally in the same parking lots - I would guess the menus change often and all food is very fresh.  The wine list is full of Italian choices.  Sadly we did not enjoy an after dinner drink or dessert, but I would not hesitate to come back just for dessert!  Bravo and definitely worth the splurge."}
{"text":"This restaurant deserves more than 5 stars. Every time I've been i have had nothing but excellent service from the owner to the waiters and buss boys.  They have a beautiful set up starting with the classy beautiful bar with a marble counter which leads to a large dinning area.   They have a great terasse in the summer with heat lamps which a lot of places are lacking. They have Colorful lights outside at night so it really sets the mood as they change colors.  They have a cozy smoking lounge where you can enjoy a cigar and drink after your meal which is the best part as I haven't seen that since stogi's it's heated and in glass so you're protected come rain or snow.  The staff is fabulous they all work together to make your dinning experience awesome.  Freddy is my favourite staff as he makes great cosmos and his own personal shot called the \"Dirty Freddy\" which is peach schnapps & jager.  I would recommend this place to all my fellow yelpers and people from out of town."}
{"text":"I had decided to visit this restaurant with 2 very close friends two nights ago.  I chose this area because it was not so far from their home and I was going to pick them up.  I had made a reservation using the Yelp reservation system and I was sent a reminder via email and the restaurant had my reservation in their system when we arrived.    This is a classy place and upon entry noticed there were already 2 large groups seated and being served.  The restaurant had a good vibe to it as well.  It took us a while to decide what we wanted but we started off with drinks first.  I had ordered the fried calamari as well as prosciutto wrapped cantalope as apps.  My friends had decided to go with one of the specials which was a seafood risoto with a large shrimp (it was a giant!) as well as my other friend had the chicken.  I had ordered the rib steak medium rare.  The shrimp and risoto looked really good.  The shimp... must have been a prawn or something because it was the size of a lobster tail.  I've never seen a shrimp that large.    I had a piece of the chicken.  The sauce was amazing and the meat was nicely cooked as it was white meat yet moist.  My steak was absolutely fabulous.  It was medium rare but not dripping blood or anything.  It was a nice temperature too but perfectly cooked.  I usually get either medium or medium rare but this steak was just right.  I didn't have desert but my friends went with the brownie and a mascarpone maple cheese cake.    The quality of food and service is very good.  The night was a kind of night that is a special occasion because I don't get to see these friends very often since we live in different cities but they are very special to me and it was a nice place to have a nice dinner with people you care about."}
{"text":"Excellent food. We tried the burrata cheese (excellent), calamari was a bit dry, the lobster ravioli was pretty good. For dessert they had an excellent latté and salted caramel mousse. The service  left much to be desired. The waiter didn't smile once while serving us. The food is also quite pricey for the west island."}
{"text":"Excellent meal. Had the lobster stuffed ravioli and my wife had the braised veal shank. Highly recommend both. Grilled octopus to start. We will be back again!"}
{"text":"Best Italian food in the west island. The service is amazing and they change their menu every week. From the lobster ravioli to the filet mignon, I would recommend anyone who is in the area to try it out!  Love it!"}
{"text":"Outstanding service, food was perfect from start to finish. Highly recommend this restaurant for all moods!"}
{"text":"My 10th review for a restaurant that truly deserves 10 stars!   I went here on Sunday for an engagement party, first of all the location is amazing , super accessible and plenty of parking to itself considering all the other restaurants/stores surrounding it.  The set up inside was beautiful, extremely classy , an amazing vibe for this type of event. The staff was super attentive to all the guests, came and took drink orders wherever we are standing. I was exceptionally impressed by the fact that our red wine was served from a decanter, I have never seen a restaurant decant their wine.    The food was spectacular, we had a plate of bread with olives as a little appetizer, then a plate of calamari with octopus, everything was presented beautifully and flawlessly and we were told what we were having. The knowledge , patience, friendliness and professionalism of the staff was extraordinary.  There was one vegetarian at my table who was accommodated with out a doubt and was even given options. The meat was served to everyones liking , and was actually served to what people asked, this is so hard to get anywhere I was so impressed with this.   This was a elegant day of celebration, and the location , service, staff can either make it more remarkable or less, in this case they defiantly made it extremely remarkable. I was also told by the couple that leading up to the big day the staff was truly helpful , professional and just made the process and planning a lot easier and also fun.   Book this location for your events - your saturday night date - your midweek dinner out- your snack after dinner-  Just book book book it and go, you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in the West Island. We were told that all of the food is fresh (nothing is frozen) and you can really taste it. I highly recommend the foie gras (served in a raspberry sauce) and octopus appetizers (if you don't like octopus, you will after you try it here). Service was fantastic and atmosphere was intimate."}
{"text":"Bel accueil a la porte. Tables bien montées. Nous étions 4. Entrée de boulettes et calamars 15$ Chacune mais c'était bon. La salade verte incluse était aussi croquante et bonne. 3 d'entre nous avons pris les papardelles avec ossobuco. Pâtes cuites juste a point et avec beaucoup de viande. Bon mais rien a se lancer par terre. 25$ le plat de pâte.  Ma voisine de table a choisi les raviolis au homard et c'était délicieux. $23. La crème brûlée au café était exceptionnelle. La carte des vins est pleine d'importations privées dont nous ne pouvons savoir le prix coûtant comme autre vin a la SAQ. Le service fut excellent.  Pas certain d'y retourner a cause des prix."}
{"text":"Went here with some coworkers.  Possibly the best filet mignon i have had.  it was cooked rare to perfection, and just melted in my mouth.  the espresso creme broule was delicious as well."}
{"text":"I've always thought that West Island didn't have any good restaurants but I was wrong!  Little Italian restaurant tucked in the Marche de l'Ouest. We ordered a entree of fried calamari and unlike most restaurants, that entree of calamari was big. The batter was light and r calamari were tender; sign that they were fresh. A lot of restaurant use the frozen calamari to cut cost, but not at La Verita. The highlight of the entree was really their homemade Marinara sauce. Nothing like I ever tasted before...I could put it on anything!  Next I ordered a veal scalpinni with mushroom sauce. It was seasoned just perfectly with a side of smashed sweet potato and asparagus.   My friend ordered tortellini with a pink sauce. I almost want to say that I preferred the tortilini as they were so delicate and yet flavourful.   My friend wanted some wine for dinner and we opted for a bottle that was reasonably priced under $40. Surprisingly, it was pretty good for that price point. The wine list has wine from all price point so it won't break your wallet.  Although food was very good, what sets his restaurant over the top was its service. As waiter Jimmy was attentive and charming...coming to check on us once in a while to make sure that we were ok. I must say that even the busboy was fantastic!  Great good with amazing service. You can tell it is a great restaurant when they have a full house on a Wednesday night and they managed to bring out an amazing quality of food and keep their service level.  Highly recommended and will be back soon!"}
{"text":"My experience this time was not as great unfortunately. The service was really lacking. I spent half my meal with an empty glass of water, even after asking the waiter for more. I came with a group of 12 and that seemed to be the case for everyone. It seemed to me that the waiters were only present when trying to sell us in cocktails or dessert. This time, the steak we ordered was a bit overdone. The lamb chops were really good though a bit too salty. Instead of being served on the side, the pasta was served with the steak, so the pasta sauce was all over the steak. I know this seems like a ridiculous complaint but when you're paying 46$ for a meal, I feel like it should be top notch. The quality is still good and I would probably give it another chance."}
{"text":"This place is really amazing.  Everything about it was really great: service, ambiance, food, desert, drinks.  I had the soup, which is amazing.  I then had the deer medallions and the cheesecake to finish.  Everything tasted REALLY great and the prices were reasonable.  If you are in the area this is a MUST visit restaurant."}
{"text":"Very good service. Great food. The atmosphere is cozy. I don't suggest this place for big groups, I find it's more for small groups or a one on one. I would go back"}
{"text":"By far my favorite restaurant in the west island . If I could give more than 5 stars I would .   I am not going to lie when I says I was not a fan of Italian food till I came here .  The first time I came here the waiter mentioned he had this appetizer called Burata  , not going to lie when I saw my bill and saw the price of this .... A bit shocking but was the most amazing cheese I have ever had and have gotten over and over again  .  I have tried many  pastas on the menu and all have been delicious .   As far as desserts  I had tried the mascaprone maple cheesecake no words can describe how amazing this was .  The service there always great .  I would definitely recommend this restaurant ."}
