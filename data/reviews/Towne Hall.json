{"text":"Great ambience and good service. Food is OK in average but nothing to write home about. Nice place to handle on weekends in the West Island."}
{"text":"Very good resto. Not cheap though very expensive. But for me the food was worth it. Good for dates. Turns into a club after 11, mostly and older croud as well as older music."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good. I flew in for work and had a  meeting and management dinner at Town Hall. The decor is nice. The place is very large, and they have a great bar. 

The food was alright. The appetizers were really good except for the grilled octopus. Try the steamed dumplings with beef and lobster stuffing. They were the best part of my meal. The calamari is also very good.  The Lamb was very salty and almost uneatable. Everyone thought the food was fine more or less."}
{"text":"Well... let's start with the \"look\"  This place is big, feels like a barn, only industrial looking with accents that look out of place.

The Staff... very young and unpolished.  Obviously, it's there first job \"waitering\" and it shows in the greeting, mood, and lack of experience.  Lack of Attentiveness and no concern given to customer service.

Drinks... forget about ordering a cocktail, you will be served sporadically (I mean come on, if 7 people are there, why not deliver and server drinks all at the same time) some of us were served our cocktail 30 minutes after ordering and received during the meal.  Also, for $10 for a cosmo, how can you get it wrong... I mean come on, if you have the b@lls to charge $10, you better get it bang on or your opening yourself up to be criticized.

We ordered as a starter, Calamari... they were rubbery and greasy.  Most places get it wrong, but this place really got it wrong.  If you tried Marvins back in the day, you will know what I mean (now, even Marvin gets the standard industrial looking cuts of calamari instead of the fresh stuff).

Mains... The 8 Oz Sirloin cut was a complete 0.  Tough, grainy and very fibery cut of beef.  If you could UN_Tenderize a cut of beef, this Chef has the recipe lol.  OMG, it was unchewable.  I am being serious.  Fish and Chips was very greasy on the batter, and came with greasy thin string cut fries that were all about 1 - 1 1/2 inches in length (just weird, since they were crammed in a mini frier looking decorative basket that was 4 x 4 x 5 inches in length.  I am too believe they do not heat there frier oil high enough so the oil soaks into the batter instead of cooking and sealing the batter pours (which by cooking this way, prolongs the frier oil instead of frying at higher temperatures to produce less greasy food).  Pizza Margherita was very commercial tasting dough and sauce, but it did have fresh sliced tomatoes on top, not enough to mask the dough and sauces non freshness.  Chicken was the best of the bunch, but if Your hungry the portion is quiet small so you better order two if you didn't get served bread (We had to ask for bread 2x to receive it once, and asked many times during the meal for water refill) and if you didn't order any starters.

Pass on this place, mildly expensive, poor effort across the board.  Bottom line, even the owner seemed like one of those employees who doesn't want to be there types.  No hello or thank you when leaving the restaurant (he was standing at the front desk, while an employee was taking a reservation on the phone).

I gave the minimum tip as a courtesy.  Nobody asked why we didn't eat our sirloin, nobody even asked if everything was okay, nobody cared to smile or say hello nor thank you... oh well."}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant , high ceilings relaxing classy place , very rare and unique in Montreal , the staff very attentive and the food one of the best : we started with drinks then the Greek salad with feta and the salmon tartare , the main dishes were mainly of fish , one fish and chips and the second dish was halibut  with gnocchi , then the salmon with mushroom rice was excellent , a place to visit and the price reasonable for the quality , I enjoyed it especially that it was not on the salty side as all the other restaurants  in Montreal ! Will sure come back often ."}
{"text":"Amazing place!!! Great food and the lounge ambiance is amazing"}
{"text":"Name's spelled wrong, guys \"Towne Hall\"..

Since there's no reviews on yelp and we had a good meal, I'll earmark this for any 'Mericans like myself that go up there and want to find a decent place.  Do Quebecois use yelp?

I don't get the negative reviews, but I went here on a Tuesday.  It was quiet, but nice.  Our waitress was friendly, anglo-Canadian.  I saw a review on another site that said \"stop hiring kids,\" but our \"kid\" was prompt, helpful, and polite.  Mustve been a bitter old \"woman-in-comfortable-shoes\" that wrote that review.

The menu is not pub fare, but it's not high-end continental, a little of everything, fish, steak, etc...can get a nice meal or a burger.

Salmon tartare and tuna tataki were great.  The lamb shank was delicious and the pureed polenta were tasty and satisfying.  The malbec our waitress suggested was delicious, not too heavy.

If you're on the West Island near the airport, it's a good option.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. The decor is modern/classy, with large crystal chandeliers hanging from 20 foot ceilings, black and white tables and chairs, and large paintings on the walls.  The decor is quite impressive, especially given the area. There are some private areas with a lounge-y feel, good for larger groups or private parties, I assume.  One walks in expecting a nice culinary experience.

We were a group of about 12, with reservations at 8:30 on Saturday night.  We had two or three small bread baskets on the table (never replenished).  A few people were late, and although we were already ordering drinks, the waiter told us we needed to order food now (it was around 9:00, there was no line, and other tables were available ...) To seat our group, several tables were pushed together. The tables weren't level, and runners were placed along the table seams, so that uneven the tables weren't visible.  A glass of wine was set on the table seam and spilled all over the table and a few of us.  Oops! Accidents happen. Our table was cleaned and a new runner was placed on the seam (again!), but our wine soaked cutlery wasn't replaced.  I still had high hopes for the food ... 
 
I had the bouillabaisse ($27).  The presentation was nice, served in a (cast iron/ceramic?) pot, with a nice garlic bread crisp.  The bouillabaisse was less of a seafood stew and more of a cooked seafood combo placed in a broth.  The broth was bland and lacked oomph, and the fish cubes weren't  skinned.  There were quite a few mussels, two clams, two large shrimp (a little tough) and two large scallops (nicely cooked). Some fresh herbs, seasoning and simmering the broth would have gone a long way.  My boyfriend had the duck breast with a berry and porto reduction ($25). The sauce was delicious,  but the duck wasn't properly cooked/sliced and was quite tough and overly fatty - one slice contained no meat and was only a slice of fat.  Another friend had the salmon tartare (which looked amazing! Presentation was gorgeous!), but she described the flavour as mediocre at best, and wasn't impressed.  Our waiter didn't check on us after bringing our food.  The cheesecake was good. 

There are much better meals available for the price.  One pays for decor and presentation, but the flavour/cooking was a miss.  The potential is there, but better chefs and more attentive staff is a must."}
{"text":"Nice place with great atmosphere - very cosmopolitan. For the most part the food was good. I had the flat bread appetizer with some sort of cream cheese and spice; it was very tasty. However, I'm giving 3 stars because the cheeseburger was way overdone, did not taste good at all.

My colleague had the Greek Village salad with salmon, which he liked. He also had the chicken noodle soup, which he raved about. So perhaps just avoid the burgers when you come here."}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times. They have probably the worst service of any resto in Montreal."}
{"text":"All you view upon entering are warm friendly smiles and it gets better, great service,food and atmosphere beats the per se in new york."}
{"text":"I've been to many places but this place is blah ,nothing special. Yeah it looks gorgeous well set up, the bottles at the bar look great. Seating arrangements are nicely done but there's a lack of ambiance missing and friendliness.

Drink prices are crazy I understand if you were a happening cool restaurant downtown but you're not, you're in the west island so slow your roll. 20 dollars a drink lol cmon now !It doesn't give off a friendly vibe I never once felt at home in this location, to be honest it seemed like a ghost town and others would agree.

Lower your drink prices and spice up your menu and I would then maybe reconsider
Coming back. 

If I want to spend good money and get good drinks and feel at home I would go to la verita down the street."}
{"text":"Well I have to say that I was sooo pleased with this restaurant and their professionalism. Waiter was great the food was good and the they respected my request as per my reservations which I would recommend to anyone if you want to get a booth so worth it. The little down side is that I had to remind the staff that it was my wife's birthday but the cake was great. The food was good don't order pasta it's not so worth it and bring your BIG wallet. Ching Ching!! So again if your looking for pasta go to an Italian restaurant."}
{"text":"Suggested by a friend.  Great food.  Thusday, Friday and Saturday nights in December will have music.  Good music but LOUD therefore unpleasant.

Tuna tartare among the best we've had.  Lobster ravioli and beef short rib were excellent.  If only we did not have to speak so loud!  Next time we'll call ahead."}
{"text":"Used to be a great spot to get dressed up and enjoy a fancier dinner in the West Island. But the last two times I've been, the food has been extremely disappointing. I've always loved the beef tartar but this weekend it was unseasoned and fatty. I decided to try the Mac and cheese and it was neon orange and looked like a box of Kraft Dinner - and for $17 it shouldn't be! My friends were equally disappointed in their overcooked and badly cut Bavette and salmon tartar. Would be unfortunate for the West Island to lose one of their few good restaurants but that is where Towne Hall is going. Am wondering if they recently changed chefs..."}
{"text":"I came here for a friend's birthday; we were a fairly big group of 20 people or so and got seated on a long table. The staff swiftly got us drinks when we sat down; the only bad part was that they were pretty watered down (rum and coke). Service was a bit slow but that was to be expected with the number of people we were. I was pleasantly surprised by the meal. I got beef short rib with the potato puree and it was amazing. The beef fell right off the bone and was savoury. 

The birthday girl had her own cake (purchased elsewhere) and it took them quite some time to bring it out even though the restaurant had started to empty out. But overall it was a good experience and would recommend you checking it out at least once!"}
{"text":"Came here for a friend's birthday, we were a large group of 20. The  food was absolutely amazing, the french onion soup was to die for. I want to go back soon just for that. The shrimp tempura was tasty also, however only got two shrimp for 15$. The wait was extremely long, they had another large table as well, and the waiters were not very quick. We got there around 7 and ended up leaving around 11pm. At one point we asked if our food was coming soon and the waiter responded \"we're currently serving 300 people, it should be out soon\" . I thought that was kind of rude but anyway, i get it , they were busy. At the end, they gave our desserts away to the wrong table, but they made up for it by giving everyone their dessert for free.  Overall, i would go back for the food but not for the service."}
{"text":"Towne Hall reminded me of an American chain called the Cheesecake Factory, but one notch up. The decor was similar (pseudo-Egyptian plus art deco). Though Towne Hall also added a 'sports bar' vibe around the bar side of this large space - with a few too many giant TVs. In other words: bordering on tacky.

I should probably start by saying I don't care much for the \"dressed-up cattle-call\" that is The Cheesecake Factory chain, (With 90% of the focus on the decor and dessert; not so much on the main courses). So I was wary after i showed up here for a group dinner, saw the decor, and was told the menu had \"something for everybody.\"

After our seating, I perused the menu. As advertised, it was very broad, but the choices at Towne Hall were higher-end than I expected, including multiple seafood dishes and apps, plus veal, lamb, and quite a few Italian and Mediterranean choices. i had a little trouble deciding, but eventually settled on the lamb chops and a Greek salad to start. A somewhat easier choice by that time, since the red wine was flowing. 

My salad was excellent - large and fresh. I was pleasantly surprised by the generous quantity of perfect, ripe tomatoes on top, since it was winter in Montreal. (and I am well aware we are spoiled in CA).

My lamb dish was less impressive - The meat had good flavor and seasoning, but was quite tough. It was both hard to cut and hard to chew. I would not get this again.

Being a work dinner, I did not have to pay. But as always, the restaurant gets no extra credit for that.  Considering the OK food and higher prices, I'd think twice about coming here on my own dime, even with the fluffed-up ambiance."}
{"text":"I went to Towne Hall last night for a large family event. I was completely blown away as I had no expectations from such a large restaurant in the West Island! 

The decor is amazing given the fact that the space is virtually a warehouse (its massive!). The waitstaff was professional through and through--never missed a step with anything. 

We had a fix menu because we were a group of 30. I had no part in choosing the menu, but the selections were varied. Everything I had was good. I had salmon carpaccio, a Caesar salad, a bavette steak and fries, and a chocolate soufflé for dessert. Some minor complaints: my Caesar salad had a surprise piece of cold cut (prosciutto? maybe?) hiding in the leaves and gave my mouth a bit of a salty shock, and it was a little overdressed as well; my bavette was perfectly cooked but my French fries left me craving something. I might have preferred some roasted potatoes instead just to make the dish a little classier. The steak was perfectly seasoned, and came with a nice little (I wanna say parsley onion and tomato?) garnish which really evened out the saltiness of the rub. 


My one real criticism of the place--and this may not even be an accurate representation of the menu given that I am basing this review on a menu fixe--is that there seemed to be a lack of cohesion in the menu choices. There was North American food, European food, Asian food, all kind of presented together. At this point I'm nit-picking. 

As well as planning the party goes, my sources told me the staff was more than helpful and made the process as painless as possible. 

Overall an excellent experience in a nice joint. Menu could use a little refinement. Would return if I ever needed to host 30 people in the West Island for sure!"}
{"text":"We had lunch here while visiting Montreal and it was very nice. We had a reservation and a somewhat large party and they were very accommodating. Service was friendly and accurate. The staff was very patient with our questions and willing to help with substitutions. I ordered the braised beef with mashed potatoes and it was amazing. The bbq ginger sauce was pretty tasty and the beef was very tender and basically melted in my mouth. Someone else at our table ordered the veal scaloppini marsala and it was very flavorful. The sauce wasn't too heavy. Linguini was cooked perfectly. 
Bathrooms were clean and had a nice decor. We would definitely eat here again next time we are in Montreal."}
{"text":"Honest to God, i had the best...BEST experience with the staff here.  I had booked online, and had specified that i wanted the cute booth by the entrance.. however, because it was online, we couldn't have known if the desired booth was reserved or not. So we arrive at the restaurant, its packed, and im told its taken and wont be free anytime soon..i was soooo dissapointed and sad.. however.. the staff REALLY helped and they set us up in a quqiet corner and gave us excellent service! The man who made our night extremely special, is Matty. He was amazing, so positif&sweet. His hospitality game was on POINT and he made us feel really comfortable! Not to mention, food was ON Point!! Thank you so much Towne Hall and especially, Thank You Matty!! Hope we always get to have you when we go to Towne Hall!This was a night we will always remember with excellent food, music, ambiance and company!"}
{"text":"Typically, I would never write a review for a restaurant, but I'll make an exception since our experience was so egregiously offensive. I do have a quick disclaimer, however: I've never eaten here; we didn't even make it that far. The incident began as we entered the parking lot. We were waiting for another car to exit a parking space in front of us. As soon as the car left, a black Porsche Cayenne raced into the lot and took our spot (mind you, the roads were icy, and the driver was being very reckless, especially given the conditions. But I digress). When confronted about it, the woman who was driving the car told my father he \"should learn how to drive\" and was generally very rude to him and dismissive of his complaint. Attempting to end the altercation with what we thought was simply a fellow patron, we told her to have a nice meal and walked into the restaurant. She replied with a smug \"No, YOU enjoy your meal\". Honestly, I thought that was just some stupid alcohol-induced comeback, but apparently it had some significance, because as she soon told us herself, she was the owner of the restaurant. We later confirmed this with the manger, Phililpe Massadie, who was very apologetic on this woman's behalf. Imagine, she bragged about being the owner having treated us this way. As if it justifies her behaviour! It's unacceptable. As a result, our party of six chose to wait 45 minutes to eat at another establishment instead of giving that woman our money. Bottom line is that the food could have been fantastic, the service could have been impeccable, and the environment could have been perfect, but we will never know and the Towne Hall will never have my business nor the business of any of our family on account of the way we were treated by the owner
 I'd appreciate it if I could receive some message or statement from the owner in reply to this review, but I notice she only replies to positive reviews, so I guess that means she doesn't really care about dissatisfied customers. 

I know this review probably comes off as if I have some personal vendetta against the owner, and to an extent, that's true. I know it probably won't persuade anyone not to eat here, but I guess on the off chance the owner is completely rude to you and your entire family, look else where"}
{"text":"Beautifully decorated with many options where to sit. They have booths, long tables and private rooms. I've been here once before with a couple friends and it was okay. 

I was here recently for a retirement party. We were a large group so we had a private room and a set menu. I had the salmon tartare which was really good. A green salad that had very little dressy and very dry which I hart time finishing. For the main course I had a white fish. The fish lacked seasoned. I felt like they just poured a dressing over the fish with a few veggies but the fish itself tasted very bland. There was a green side to the fish, I had half a bit. It was pretty bad. It tasted like someone soaked spinach in water, took it out and forgot to drain it, wrapped it in a circle and served it. I wish it was cooked a little. I couldn't even eat it, I was just choking on it. I had a mojito which was good as well. 

I have several food allergies and I was really impressed that they respected that when serving me. 

I absolutely loved the soufflé. I haven't had a soufflé like that in a long long time! We were lastly served with coffee/tea. The coffee was frankly strong but I enjoyed it especially having it just before walking into the cold. 

There was a DJ in the main hall. The bar is beautiful. They've done a really good job decorating the restaurant. I just didn't find the food extravagant but a great option for a fancy place in the West Island. 

They need to put some work in the bathroom. The mirrors are very nice. However there was nothing available to dry your hands. They have towels over paper and there was nothing available. So there were 3 of us who used the same towel to dry our hands!"}
{"text":"Une premiere pour moi dans cet énorme salle a manger. Décor genre steak house avec fauteuil en cuir et plafonds très hauts. Tables bien montées avec serviette et tissu ect. Pour ce mardi midi la moitié du restaurant est vide mais il y a quand même de l'ambiance. La majorité des clients sont comme nous en lunch d'affaire. La table d'hôte du midi comprend une salade verte ou un carpaccio de betteraves. Les prix vont de 20$ A 30$ par table d'hôte. J'ai choisi le  carpaccio qui était très léger et frais. Très bonne idée et de belles couleurs. Pour la bouillabaisse, je dois dire que ce fut moyen. Des fruits de mer très frais mais le bouillon était fade.  Le service était excellent , professionnel.  Tout compte fait, ce fut moyen mais je vais lui donner une deuxième chance un de ces jours."}
{"text":"Went to lunch to celebrate the departure of a colleague.  I had the the salmon tartar with guacamole as my appetizer and the grilled salmon risotto as my meal.  Both dishes were tasty but the grilled salmon was cold and over cooked."}
{"text":"Mediocre at best. We went for a team dinner and out of 10+ people in attendance, no one raved about their meal and no one thought it was bad...always \"my meal was ok.\"  Nothing stood out. 

Decor and bar was cool and service was fine."}
{"text":"Service was by far amazing. The staff was extremely friendly and asked us if we needed anything during dinner. Although it wasn't a rush on a Saturday night, we had no delays in making our orders and getting our dinner. I tasted the french onion soup and it was really good, but flavour was overpowering. Onto main course, I had lobster ravioli. Lobster was really chewy, more than usual, and the ravioli was well, ravioli. I've decided that i'm not the biggest fan of ravioli in general, so i'm not going to comment whether it was great. Dessert was amazing.

By far the service was top notch, waiters asked and helped, laughed along our jokes, and was a pleasant experience overall. A little on the pricey side, but good for a celebratory occasion.

Ambience is very dark, and music is being played but could still hear friends very well. I usually don't like music in restaurants because it doesn't allow me to hear my friends well, but this wasn't the case. 

Overall, I was expecting better from main course in terms of taste. ¯\_(?)_/¯ ."}
{"text":"My family brought me here to celebrate my Grandma's birthday. It's an impressive room, not my vibe really, cavernous, quote unquote modern. The food was ok, my grandma was happy and that was really all that mattered. Our waiter was friendly, patient, and surprised the lady of the hour with a cake and song. Nothing objectionable here and a good option in the West Island."}
{"text":"It's my go-to place when I want to dress up and have good drinks, while remaining in the west island. The drinks are a little pricy but very good. I never actually had a meal there so I can't comment on the food. The restaurant is very nice and trendy and I love the hip atmosphere. I definitely recommend it if you're too lazy to drive downtown but still want that supper club experience."}
{"text":"The decor is great, nice little place and service was really nice.

My caesar salad was a little soggy, too much dressing. 

My main course was a lobster BLT and let me tell you, it was really great! Lobster was fresh and lemony and had a great taste.

I would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant, impeccabe service, great atmosphere, decor outstanding, food was excellent especially the chcolate fondant for dessert"}
{"text":"ATMOSPHERE: It's a very beautiful and classy restaurant. The interior is surprisingly a lot bigger than it seems on the outside. Everything is clean and modern, very nice ambiance.

FOOD: The food was delicious! I had the salmon tartar and the lobster ravioli. I did find the ravioli a bit too salty for my tastes but the tartar was delicious. And the display was lovely as well. Unfortunately, my partner ordered an onion soup as an appetizer and he couldn't even finish it because it was so salty. Dishes aren't very consistent...

PRICE: Prices are a bit more costly, but not surprising considering that it's a higher end restaurant.

SERVICE: The service was decent. A bit slow to bring the plates but they were still friendly."}
{"text":"Everytime I visit this restaurant,  I love it.!! The high ceilings and beautiful chandeliers and classy decor  take you to another world .. away from the suburbs... 

The round tables booths are my favorite 
..the  white dishes on the table with beautifully displayed food are yummylicious ..and the service amazing ..."}
{"text":"Thoroughly enjoyed this restaurant. Definitely go try it out.

I went there for dinner on March 10. The place looked very nice. It was not crowded for a friday night. The prices are on the high side but the food was really good. Service was great and my family all enjoyed their dinner.

I started with the fried calamari. It was perfectly done and comes with a few strips of fried zuchini. My wife ordered the tuna tartare. I tasted a bit of it and it was really tasty and well presented. For the main course we both ordered the mediterranean fish stew. It came out in a creuset pot and was delicious. My son had the seafood linguini. They do not skimp on ingredients and both dishes were loaded with seafood and was very tasty.

Everybody should treat themselves to a meal here. I definitely will be coming back."}
{"text":"It was my birthday dinner , so I decided to go to Towne Hall . Honestly  the decor is beautiful  food was delicious but the service was bad .  We were a group of 20 , we were there from 7 pm till 11 . Between each meal we ordered we had to wait more than 50 mins . My french onion soup was A+++ . I would go there again just to get the soup it was that amazing . I had also ordered beef spring rolls , delicious and my sister ordered the fish and chips delicious again . Some people there ordered the most simple dessert , ice cream . Yet it took then like 25 mins , after me asking them why is it taking so long . It turns out they gave our ice cream to another table , but at least they did not charge them for it . Over all food was delicious , service for such a big group was crap . Mind you  the food was great so i would still definitely  go back ."}
{"text":"Went here on a Friday night for a girls' night. We had reservations for 8pm, and were seated promptly. The decor is very nice; modern and classy. I loved the high ceilings, chandeliers and soft lighting. We were seated in a rounded booth that gave us nice privacy but we didn't feel cramped in there. Good music played, but not loud enough for us to have to yell at each other to hear. Our waiter was very nice and charming. I ordered the fish 'n' chips, served with a small house salad and a small bowl of fries. The fish was pretty good, mind you I would have preferred a little less batter as I barely tasted the fish, but I guess that's the point (?). The salad has a sweet vinaigrette and was refreshing in contrast to the battered fish. The fries were your basic matchstick variety, but I was glad there wasn't a mountain of fries, otherwise I would've left feeling too full. My evening companions had the gnocchi, the red snapper, caesar salad with salmon tartar and a seafood linguini of sorts (respectively). They were all rather satisfied with their meals, so I would say it was a successful night. The pricing is a bit high for the meals offered, but I would go back for the overall experience."}
{"text":"Un resto de belle facture, un brin tape-à l'oeil (lié je crois à son grand frère le 40 West tout près), avec une carte variée allant de l'onglet de boeuf standard au poisson grillé, en passant par les pâtes et le hamburger haut de gamme.

La cuisine est somme toute correcte mais un peu brouillonne, mon onglet médium-saignant était médium, les frites étaient ordinaires (quoique allumettes) et la salade maison non généreuse et plutôt simplette.

Les vins au verre sont plutôt bien mais le choix est trop limité pour que ce soit intéressant. Le choix à la carte est plus complet et les prix corrects.

Le service était bien.

Donc, ok pour un lunch haut de gamme avec collègues/contacts, possiblement pour un groupe du bureau/clients le soir mais pour une expérience gastronomique, mieux vaut une alternative."}
