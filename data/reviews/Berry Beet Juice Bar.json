{"text":"Everything we have tried has been amazing. The bowls, the smoothies and juices are all fresh and super delicious. It is best to order ahead so you can just pick it up when you arrive."}
{"text":"Just what i needed.  Try the \"rainbows and sunshine\" or the OG!  You wont be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Today my family and I went here for the first time and it was a wonderful experience. I got the Aloha Kai; the kiddos got the On Wednesdays We Wear Pink, Strawberry Bananza, Rainbows Sunshine; and the husband chose Pine Tree. Everything was delicious...and even beautiful (they layer certain smoothie varieties). My son even finished his smoothie (something that rarely happens at other juice shops). Definitely, will be back, due to the excellent service and tasty drinks! :)"}
{"text":"SUPER yummy and fresh acai & pitaya bowls. For being so new these guys are doing great! Cute atmosphere and the family running this place is so kind. Will be back!"}
{"text":"I will never turn down a chance to go to the Berry Beet juice bar. Great people and environment. Healthy and delicious. The smoothie bowls are the absolute BEST!"}
{"text":"This juice bar is delicious and the concept with the Naturopathic physician literally within the same space is genius. The prices are great as well. This is definitely an Ahwatukee gem to support!"}
{"text":"Never had a pitaya bowl and I'm going back again only 4 days after my first time because I loved it so much. I like the fact that this place seems clean and smells good and fresh when you walk in. Can compare it to other places because I have never had a pitaya bowl before but I would say try it out!"}
{"text":"The smoothies and juices are really good... really. However, I have been here twice (so has my coworker) and we will unfortunately not go back because each time it took 28 minutes to get one smoothie :( I would love to support a local business but that's plain insane. Nekter it is from now on.."}
{"text":"After a long vacation of drinking and a little too much In-N-Out, I decided to jump-start a cleanse right before going back home. Berry Beet was just what I needed. This is a wonderful, friendly, family-owned establishment with very fresh ingredients. They are very knowledgeable and will take the time to help you decide which juice you need. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Fantastic!! Super fresh, fruit was naturally sweet and perfectly ripe. I had the acai bowl, and price wise it was more than fair. The smoothies looked amazing as well."}
{"text":"Nice family biz with good menu items. The quantities are good size and the process are not bad given what your getting"}
{"text":"Very yummy.....We love Acai bowls........These were good.  Not our favorite but very good.  Great people!"}
{"text":"Delicious place. Clean, nice employees, and good vibe. Was happy to find a good juice place on my travels. Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Great, refreshing fruit smoothies.  The perfect treat after a hike at south mountain park.  Friendly staff, nice environment:)"}
{"text":"Absolutely love it here. Tried the \"Acai Bowl\" and it was amazing. Organic and healthy for myself and my kids."}
{"text":"Great place. I love in Lakewood and pass by here a lot and have been wanting to try it since it says organic. Stopped by today and was impressed. As a multiple business owner I always look at the details of a business and this one guy 5 stars in so many areas.  The place was very very clean, the owners were friendly, they even wore gloves while they made the juice which was a plus.  I got the energizer.  It was great."}
{"text":"The Berry Beet Juice Bar has a wide variety of organic fruit and vegetable smoothies blended to pure perfection. My smoothie tasted so good, and I really want to go there again some time."}
{"text":"Tasty Treats For Breakfast  Cool little spot off Chandler blvd... The doctor who has the office in the same spot was nice and friendly. Her son is the young man working at the cafe.   The fruit bowls were really good, but perhaps a bit high priced. I thought it was odd that the remaining fruit was thrown into the garbage instead of offered to us... I'm just saying, throwing stuff away... I would be asking the customer if they would like extra fruit on top...  All in all its a flavor filled spot...."}
{"text":"Great place that is open at 7am for a breakfast smoothie on the way to work. Great neighborhood juice and smoothie bar. Very clean and fresh ingredients.  I love small family businesses that are doing it the right neighborhood."}
{"text":"Great People... Awesome Menu... Best Prices. The Berry Beetle Juice on Ice is a Must. Ask Ira to make it you"}
{"text":"This juice bar is pretty basic, the smoothie was good but nothing exciting.  The people working are super nice and friendly I just wasn't impressed with the menu options or drink itself."}
{"text":"So good!! Looking for some nutrition and found this place on yelp! It's located in a strip mall and easy to find. The people who waited on us were so incredibly friendly, kind and helpful. We both got smoothies and shared a juice. So delicious!! Wish we lived closer and had the option of coming back, it was worth the drive from our hotel!"}
{"text":"We got the 2 smoothies; they need to be colder, drink was not cold enough-- Good flavor though. Cute little place, clean, smells good, friendly staff. My only downfall was just the drink temp, add more ice, or something. It upset our stomach afterwards, so that wasn't fun. Maybe they will read this review and just make their smoothies colder. I think it'd be better that way."}
{"text":"Amazing organic juices, smoothies, and bowls.  Great quality, tastes great good service and really clean place."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great juices and smoothies with quality ingredients and the friendliest service! The Energizer is the best pick me up on a hot day in the Phoenix heat"}
{"text":"My new little smoothie place. All organic. Very nice, clean, I like the ambiance and the staff is very friendly and positive. Not to mention my smoothie was yum, yum. I ordered the tropic thunder with a hint of protein."}
{"text":"Wow... I found this AMAZING GEM of a place! It's so clean and so fresh! Everyone is so nice and made me feel at home. I found this place on Yelp and seen I got 10% off. I've been looking for a place like this for a long time. I'll be back and look forward being a regular here! The Rainbow Sunshine is out of this WORLD!"}
{"text":"We just moved near here a week ago and have two granddaughters visiting.  We stopped here and were ALL impressed.  We ordered a Pretty Pink Pataya and a Cherry Vanilla Banana Paradise.  Both were fantastic.  The atmosphere was quiet and welcoming.  Girls were impressed so I got brownie points. Will be back!!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Cute little atmosphere and very nice people! I got the acai please and it tasted so good! I will definitely be going back again and recommending to my friends! The cashier gave me a 10% discount for finding them on yelp!"}
{"text":"Needed something refreshing to drink .. never Saw this place until today and I ordered the tropic thunder.. it's pretty good.. a little pricy but u do get 10% discount when u check in on yelp.."}
{"text":"Great service! Clean environment with reasonable prices for organic healthy options. Love it!"}
{"text":"The Pretty Pink Pitay 16 oz fruit bowl is $8.95  I felt like it was a bit expensive for a 16 oz, but that's just my opinion. The fruit bowl was good, but it only had one tiny layer of fruit on the top.  The juice bar is apart of a naturopathic doctors office. The owner was really nice and she has her son helping with her business."}
{"text":"Pretty quick review for my standards. Was in the area and was planning to go to Pomegranate but saw the Yelp ad for this place and I had never been so decided to check it out.  It's very similar to your average juice shop of juices, smoothies, and Brazilian bowls.  Lady taking order was very nice and helpful.  She told me their is a naturopath  adjacent to them that is slightly closed off by a wall.  I forgot the pricing but the lady was not there when I went in the morning hours.  Interesting twist to a juice shop.    One unique thing they offer here is you can make up your own juice by picking first a base of carrot, apple, cucumber or celery  and then add up to 4 different items of greens and root veggies like beets.  This way you can get total greens with no sugar up to the sweeter fruits and veggies.  I Decided to try there green drink special Vonda's special which was with different greens  but don't remember exactly everything in the drink.  I have yet to try the smoothies but I was told that all cream smoothies can be made with either yogurt or made vegan with coconut cream.  Will need to try one next time.  Prices for juices are between 8-10 buckaroos which is within reason for juice shops these days. All in all it's a nice little shop but with Pomegranate down the street it's going to be hard for them to get me to want to come here if I had the choice."}
{"text":"Dr. J hooked me up with a very flavorful juice drink.  \"Woke\" juice is packed full of flavor, you can tastes all the ingredients in this healthy but naturally sweet drink.  I definitely recommend this juice bar to anyone."}
{"text":"Had the Pretty Pink Pitaya, super good & addicting! My cashier Issac was very helpful and knew how to give excellent customer service."}
{"text":"First time! I live across the street and finally got in to check it out! Extremely friendly two young men behind the juice bar! Great customer service skills and a overall awesome organic HUGE juice beverage :)  Thanks Gentleman I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I love family owned business! Walked in! Greeted by an amazing young lady! Ordered be ginger shot' and I have to say it's amazing!!! They use natural products and I can taste it in all the juices!!! Please come support  OG  SMOOTHIE- amazing taste and I love fresh tasting açai!! My brother got the GlennCoco!! He said was creamy and the amount of chocolate was great!!  Definitely will be back"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this place today... Super clean and yummy big selection. Good service as well. Lost 1star for the prices... $7.95 plus tax for a fresh pressed juice. Seemed a little steep but thats just me. I would still go back once in a while tho. :)"}
