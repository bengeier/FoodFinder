{"text":"If your looking for something cheap and quick this is place to go.  Remember, this is a family style cafe and is meant for breakfast.  With 95% of the restaurants on the eastside being avg to below avg this place is no different.  Please do not be fooled by the five star ratings of the other reviewers...common sense has to prevail.  Its simple basic food"}
{"text":"I agree with more than five stars.  The salad bar is fresh and has lots of choices, the salmon was great, and the broccoli cheese soup was fine.  I gave it four stars because my wife's dinner did not get as great a review.  This is our first time here, we will be back to try more."}
{"text":"Inexpensive, good food. One gets a hearty portion and service is great. Anthony's has great breakfast and service! The salad bar is fresh, and the soup is good. I've been going here for years and will continue to do so."}
{"text":"I would give this place ten stars if i could THE PRIME RIB IS AMAZING LOVE ANTHONYS GREAT SERVICE YUMMY"}
{"text":"We have only had breakfast at Anthony's and have never been disappointed.  The food is always just the way I ordered it, the waitresses are friendly and pleasant, the service is quick and the prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"My new \"go to\" family diner. Cannot beat the soup and salad bar with your meal plus dessert from the senior menu. Peties used to be my place, but they are not the same after the fire. Anthony's is so much better on my stomach and wallet!"}
{"text":"Started with a warm greeting. Ice tea was fresh brewed, soups hot and tasty and the salad bar was way above average. Server Letty was sweet and kind. Overall a wonderful experience. One of the few restaurants I will return to. Thanks Anthonys."}
{"text":"This update is overdue. The Manager had reached out to me, sincerely apologetic about our experience, and made things right.  Every experience that we have had, since the time this review was originally posted, has been exceptional!  The food quality and service is back!  Letty, Sam M. And Rene P. are our favorite servers!"}
{"text":"Due for an update for here I think...So they have a different soup of the day every day. I had just been going on Thursdays, which is why it was chicken noodle and stuffed pepper lol. Have had the option to try many soups from here by now, and all are super yummy. 

Unsure of what reviewer JK is talking about, as I've had chicken paprikash from quite a few places, and have found Anthony's to be one of the best I have had. To each his own I guess. Yes the crowd is older, but I don't judge my food based on my fellow patrons. Service has always been fast and friendly. Salad bar is fresh and well kept. 
Love this place. You keep doing you Anthony's!!"}
{"text":"Best omelette ever love this place definitely good service and kind people I would definitely say best breakfast I have had and a while definitely go there for breakfast"}
{"text":"Second time visiting this restaurant. We really like it. Had a burger that was cooked to perfection. Salad bar doesn't have tons of selection but it was fine as salad bars go. Staff is very nice. We will go again when we are in the area"}
{"text":"Can't believe I haven't reviewed this place before. Staff is super nice. Parking can be crowded. Even if the line is out the door, it doesn't take long. All you can eat fish is good, though their supply of malt vinegar is iffy. Spaghetti is the only pasta choice so I won't be trying the eggplant unless I bring in some angel hair. Just had the tuna stuffed tomato and it was Marvelous!! Good tuna, good summer tomato!  Oh yeah and they make a great breakfast!"}
{"text":"The word I would use to describe this place is average. The food is okay although a bit pricey for what it is. The service is what one would expect."}
{"text":"I read the reviews and decided to try Anthony's.  Glad I did.  This place did not disappoint.  The Navy Bean soup was excellent and I wanted something a little different to eat so went with Grilled Ham & Cheese.  Also excellent.
I'll be back!"}
{"text":"This is the place where the locals go. Food is good, prices are great, service is efficient, serving staff is friendly, it's impeccably clean. Best local diner around."}
{"text":"One of the best places I have eaten at in a while.  Love the salad bar! Food has been incredible every time I have been there. Great service, food and prices! If you want a good hearty meal this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Anthonys is a very good place.  Salad bar is clean, fresh, cold.  No proteins though but given the price is expected.   I had turkey club on wheat toast and diet coke.  Came with the soup and salad bar; same was plenty of food.  Plenty of comfort food too.  I will have breakfast there before updating my star count and review; it looked just awesome.  About $8 for lunch  I will be back"}
{"text":"Came for breakfast and got the corned beef hash. I mean I would bet my life it was straight out of the can. What really made it obvious besides the taste and texture is it had the tiny diced potatoes in the corned beef AND a side of hash browns.  The only reason i wouldn't give it one star is My friend got the pancakes and was overall happy with them. Seemed like forgettable greasy spoon otherwise."}
{"text":"I take my grandchildren to Anthony 's about twice a month. (I have 7). We love the diner atmosphere and the service is great. It is good fresh comfort food. The salad bar is always fresh. Prices reasonable. Keep up the great comfort food."}
{"text":"Ordered from the specials, but too much food!  --  salad bar, soup, roll and main course. Very reasonably priced, which explains why we had to wait for a table."}
{"text":"Nice local less than greasy spoon. I have eaten breakfast here periodically over the years, from pancakes to Eggs Benedict. They have good deals on breakfast before 11, and even their premium items are good. Coffee is good, hot, and always full. There can be a bit of a wait on a table during peak hours, which is always a good sign for a small local restaurant. All in all, it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"We've been here for lunch and dinner and have always been happy with what we got.  Although we usually wind up taking half of it home.  If you get the specials, the pricing's great and if not -- it's a little more expensive, though not out of line.

I also want to praise their staff -- I've gone in a couple of times now to get salad and soup to go for my husband and they've been great about helping me out and getting it all packed up.  I really appreciate their help.

I would like to tell \"J.K.\" to go fly a kite -- you don't have to be 70 to eat here.  Jerk."}
{"text":"Inexpensive for all the food you get. Good quality tasting food. Service was fast and attentive but not annoying."}
{"text":"Eaten here for breakfast a few times. Simple straight forward solid food. Waited maybe ten minutes during peek Sunday breakfast times. Service was quick and we were in and out in 30 mins. Overall solid American breakfast fare."}
{"text":"was intrigued to give it a go after seeing their coupons in the local \"penny saver\" for quite awhile .. we opted for the prime rib dinner, however, which is not available via the coupon but we were not disappointed .. the cut was HUGE .. the soup & salad bar well stocked & fresh .. baked potato cooked perfectly & even got ice cream for dessert .. very reasonably priced & delicious all the way around .. the service also did not disappoint .. Cheyenne was wonderful .. very nice young lady who is excellent at her job .. we were new but we will be back .. many regulars around us were also glad to have Cheyenne as her server so we are not alone in complimenting her service"}
{"text":"Today I had the fish fry which I have had before and again I wonder why I ordered it !   The fish is soaked with grease.  Yuk. Never again.  Chowder and salad bar were ok Service very good as usual"}
{"text":"Feels like grandmas house..... home cooked feel I like it. The portions are HUGE though and I can't ever finish it all."}
{"text":"The prime ribs seems to be the best seller. Runs out early."}
{"text":"This place no matter what meal you choose to dine in there is awesome. It's a family restaurant unlike any other  run of the mill, dingy family restaurants you've been to. Anthony's is clean and fresh and the staff is nice and friendly. I prefer this place for breakfast (which is served all day for you late wakers!) They have specials that cannot be beat on a separate menu and a salad bar that is always fresh and hits the spot. There is nothing bad to be said here. I would choose the half order of french toast and eggs if you are a lighter eater! It is the perfect size. For the bigger appetites, the pork chop breakfast is huge! Give this place a shot and do not let the \"family\" restaurant scare you away. Oh and you have to gawk at the unbelieveable desserts in the case as you walk in...or out!"}
{"text":"Had the best breakfast at Anthonys this past weekend! The omelette and hash browns were perfect and the side of sausage was more than I could eat! Will be back for sure!!!"}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast! On Sunday they start serving dinner at 11am.  Always good service & food.  Just a family kind of place."}
{"text":"Please don't go anywhere near this place if you're younger than 70 or have working teeth.

This is a classic old-folks restaurant: bland and overcooked. My wife had something labeled chicken paprikash -- overdone pasta, tasteless sauce. I had a fish fry. The thin layer of fish inside each piece was some texture I've never encountered in a seafood dish before -- gummy, grainy, as if it had been boiled until it dissolved into its constituent elements and then reassembled into odd shapes. 

The much-praised salad bar is, um, salad stuff. Nothing out of the ordinary."}
{"text":"I went to Anthony's again. The staff is so nice. They always ask about my little sister who worked there years ago. Such nice people. Good food, quick service. I get the breakfast specials, they are available until 11am."}
{"text":"Large portions and decent food. Will be going into my rotation of breakfast spots. Service was decent."}
