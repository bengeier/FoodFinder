{"text":"Located in the heart of West Island, Elixor is a restaurant I feel that is trying to do too much at the same time. We were promptly seated as soon as we got in for a late lunch. When we looked at the menu, the first thing we noticed is just how large it was. It goes from fish to sandwiches, from pasta to grill (It was all over the place). Price wise for lunch though, it was okay. I got baby back ribs with soup and desert. Service was very friendly and food came out at a good pace. Soup was creamy and flavorful. Ribs were slightly too charred and dry. Coleslaw was decent. My mashed potatoes was alright even though it was slightly lumpy. My group also had similar experiences: okay but could be better. Dessert was a chocolate cake. Again, it was good but it could have been better. Overall, I do not think Elixor is a bad place. However, they make some simple mistakes that if  they had more focus and reduced the menu, I am sure that their quality would improve greatly."}
{"text":"I go to this restaurant quite often. Delicious food and they serve pretty much everything. It's not expensive and the service is very good."}
{"text":"Calamari entree is excellent with their curry dipping sauce. Menu changes from time to time and has a good variety of tastes. Desserts are amazing and have a rather big portion size so you might want to split it with someone. Coffee is good and the waiters top it up often. Good and friendly service."}
{"text":"This is one of our go-to places because the menu is extensive (hubby & I don't always agree on what we want) so this menu always pleases us. My fav so far is the beef Thai salad ... So huge with two huge brochettes of beef & the dressing is yummy.  The other salads are great. Had several of the soup of the days which were also awesome.  Quesadilla are good, burrito yummy & burgers one of the best on the west island. Don't forget the sweet potato fries!!!"}
{"text":"While this D.D.O. location seems to be freezing cold every time I pay a visit, I cannot complain about the food! I find the menu to have a decent variety (dessert and drinks included)! There are so many great tasting restaurants where the dessert menu is lacking, this is not the case at Elixor (their \"Reese's Pieces Cheesecake\" is a MUST). The food is fresh and burgers not lacking. Any plate is filling. On a small negative note, their Appetizers are WAY too expensive, The price is almost equivalent to a full meal when it is not so portion-wise. Stick to the delicious main meals!"}
{"text":"Everything is really tasty and mouth watering. Their sangrias are to die for.  The atmosphere is a little classy but it's also very friendly and family-friendly. The staff is really nice. Would definitely go back sometime soon. I recommend the red sangria :-)"}
{"text":"Les portions sont généreuses et assez goûteuse. Le Burger St-Louis est un 'must' pour les fans de burgers ;)"}
{"text":"One of my favourite restaurant in Laval. They have everything right here ! The menu is great, they serve all kind of food. Their lunch menu is great to!   Expect somewhat of a line to get in on weekends and thursday night. The food quality is great, portions are big and breakfast are great to!  Only downer is that it's a very LOUD place, we could hardly hear each other at a table of 4.  Worth trying!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is nice, service was efficient. They offer a reasonably priced child's menu, the rest of the food is expensive. Menu offers a large selection.  If you go you must try the avocado rolls, really delicious. Their salads are huge and filling. Did not have a dessert, but hear good things."}
{"text":"Menu trop chargé qu'on ne sait même plus quoi manger! La nourriture était correct mais sans plus."}
{"text":"Going out for dinner isn't always just about the food, it's also about the experience. My gf and I had a pleasant experience eating here. The food was great and the service was delightful! If you like salads then you really should try the salmon salad. The portion is very satisfying and the salad was just great! Trust me you won't be hungry after eating this salad. My gf had the tuna salad and she claims it was delicious and the tuna was perfectly prepared. For desert we ordered the Lindt chocolate cheese cake and it was good but I've had better which is why I'm giving 1 star less than perfect. The whipped cream was frozen and the cheese cake was missing flavor. All in all a good experience and we'll definitely be going back for that salad."}
{"text":"Good place, love their St-Louis Burger, deliciious! Prices are a bit too high. Good food and service."}
{"text":"Was there a few times.  Love the appetizers, especially the avocado rolls. (they don't want to give me the secret recipe)  :-)  They don't have the clothe napkins anymore. and their coleslaw salad has too much  dressing. it is very \"liquidy\"."}
{"text":"Service lent, cocktails pas à leur meilleur. Ambiance de Casino."}
{"text":"Excellent ai vous voulez partager vos plats avec votre partenaire. Les salades sont excellentes et ils font le meilleur pad thai en ville. Quand aux prix le tout est très abordable. Si je peux reprocher quelque chose, c'est l'amplitude du menu, on s'y perd rapidement. Essayer le cheesecake, c'est ce qui se rapproche du plus de cheesecake factory."}
{"text":"My favorite resto to go for calamari, especially the curry ginger sauce it comes with! Out of all the restaurants I've been to, I find Elixor has the best calamari. Perfect size and they give plenty.   Their chicken crispers are crispy and juicy, really good as an appetizer, but the last time I had it, it was bland and dry.   I expected more from the red velvet cake but it was dry as if it were a few days old.  Chocolate cake is delicious, very moist and huge! Comes with ice cream and whipped cream. Unfortunately the last time I was at Elixor, I noticed they don't offer the ice cream with their chocolate cake on the menu.  I will only go here for the calamari, nothing else.  Decent place to check out if you're in the area."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times, and while the food isn't that impressive, the restaurant as a whole is a pretty good bet for West Island dining. The menu is varied and the place has a classy atmosphere without pretending to be fancy.   A few specifics: Love the avocado rolls. Good entrée salads. Avoid the pad thai, it doesn't taste like pad thai. Get dessert."}
{"text":"Very nice place , very big, usually good service but this time around i had a waitress that wasn't very good at her job. Very slow, forgetful and never came to check on us. They also had run out of most things on the appetizer menu witch was a little bit annoying. I brought a cake for mothers day and its took forever for them to bring it out when i had said to do so in 10 minutes. Food was good. Portions are huge. Their deserts are good but very rich. All in all this is a good place but service could be improved"}
{"text":"Best restaurant ever! I love the food there~ I order some salad today. The serve is hug~ however I ate it up since it was so yum! I'm so glad to find this one."}
{"text":"Fantastic restaurant. SO MANY CHOICES! My favorite is the chicken avocada crema plus the beer/cheese soup which is served on Saturdays from what I know. Fair prices, and very attentive service. Can get fairly packed, but there is lots of seating. Always come back for more!"}
{"text":"Food wasn't fresh at all! seemed like bread for cheese dip was old and hard, drinks I had a lemonade cocktail and wife had daquari (both were way to sweet ! And I'm not picky at all with my food or drinks, main dish Pad Thai was again wayy to sweet and my wife had a burger average at best meat was dry. Overall I've eaten here 3 times and seems like it's all about volume and size service was horrible I actually had to get up and go find our waiter for dessert and the bill. There are much better restaurant in the area and I strongly suggest looking elsewhere."}
{"text":"Ordered herb encrusted salmon salad. Fish was well cooked but lacking in the flavour department. Salad was acidic: too many tomatoes, the vinaigrette was vinaigry, the marinated artichokes didn't help either. I get like I was eating sour bruschetta topping. Also they lose 4 stars for not honoring a coupon which is basically false advertising. Coupon came from a page with multiple boxes and offers.  Nowhere on the coupon did it say that it could not be used on a Friday; matter of principle.  Spoke to manager who didn't own up to their mistake or offer an acceptable response instead he tried to blame it on the marketing company and said they would not honor it. #fail  Any respectable establishment would honor it without hesitation; and trust me I've been to restaurants are eager to serve and please the customer. The onus of responsibility is with management. They made more than an advertising mistake; out of PRINCIPLE they just lost an entire table of customers."}
{"text":"Mon restaurant préféré!  De tout ce que j'ai mangé là-bas à présent , j'ai tout aimé!  Je conseille fortement ! Beaucoup de choix.. je dirais même trop. Ils n'ont pas la main légère sur l'alcool lol"}
{"text":"Made a reservation courtesy of the restaurant's affilliation with Open Table. It was real easy (30 minutes prior) and given it was a Saturday evening,  I was very pleased that the booked time was confirmed.    We got there 10 minutes prior and the hostess confirmed it BUT one of the managers said that while he would honor the reservation, he could not commit to the time as there were people waiting at the door for much longer than our party. I told him that was not my concern. If the restaurant wants to drive its business using social media then there are consequences and responsibilities they must accept. Ten minutes later we were seated. If the manager had said nothing, then this part of the review would have been omitted. BTW, after we were seated the line up disappeared.   Our server Marco was great. We ordered a selection of meals off the Table d'Hôte and regular menu.  The Caesar salad was very good.  The strip sirloin was broiled and cooked as  requested, medium rare. Excellent. One recommendation would be to include the weight of the raw steak on the menu. The fries were crisp. I would exclude the side \"gravy\". This steak doesn't need anything to enhance/complement its flavor beyond its grilled seasoning.   The broiled shrimp with the steak and chicken meals were excellent,  too.   The large baby back ribs were enjoyed by two of our party. Finger-lickin' good.  We as a group enjoyed our respective meals and the service received by our server, Marco. We wish that our initial experience with the manager had not affected our overall visit but it did.   Worth a second visit."}
{"text":"Worth the trip, nice patio and extensive cocktail list.  Food was good also, this place has a really large menu and prices are average."}
{"text":"Used to like this place, but I'm changing my vote to \"dislike.\" Disappointed in their red velvet, the cake was old, smelled and tasted like a dirty fridge. Also it was grainy possibly from not using cake flour or from crystallization of sugar in the frosting for a long time. But what's most upsetting was that they display 10-12 layer cakes but cut that tall cake in half to serve. (On our way out, we checked the dessert station with half cut carrot cake as well.) What a deceptive sales strategy! WHO DOES THAT?! That thin and short cake was $7.75 plus tax with whip cream. Save $ for better (go somewhere else serving the entire piece of tall cakes). NO for desserts.   Now for food. Liked there shepherd's pie (they added fresh steamed veggie on the side). Elixor is American family restaurant style: huge portion, fatty, and pretty tasty with inexpensive ingredients. Don't order \"crunchy\" calamari for an appetizer, it's not crunchy at all but rather soggy in oil. Felt like drinking oil with hot calamari. But they have gluten free option including sauce, which is nice for everyone."}
{"text":"Normally Elixor is great but both my mother in law and girlfriend got horrible food poisoning from the Cobb salad on Wednesday and were sick beyond belief for like 8+ hours. We almost had to take my 73 year old mother in law to the hospital. Wicked bad experience."}
{"text":"Toujours aussi bon et le nouveau décore aussi super et bien sûr les desserts aussi , cette fois j'ai essayé la crème brûlée avec le riz trop bon je vous le recommande , et sans oublié le personnel est très gentille aussi ......"}
{"text":"Had dinner with a few people from work one night and someone suggested that we go there. I had not been before so I figured why not try a new place. I was disappointed first we walked in and stood at the door for a good 10 minutes before anyone saw us (group of 8 is hard to miss). It was strange because the place was empty so not sure why no one greeted us faster.  The decor was ok but nothing fabulous, deco cheap/chic. The server we had didn't smile the whole time, never really checked on us to make sure we were doing ok.  The beer we wanted was not available we were told they ran out. They had lots of fruit flies everywhere and you had to be careful because they would land in ur plate. Also the fire alarm went off for a good 15 minutes and not one server can to let us know what was going on or reassured us that we were fine. Let me tell you that it was really loud and worrisome at first. The food was ok but very expensive not worth the price in my opinion. The only thing I really enjoyed was the avocado rolls and bruschetta both very good and without those I would have given this place 1 star only."}
{"text":"Truly a fantastic restaurant,service polite and rapid,chicken ceaser salad was to die for,will definitely be back again"}
{"text":"Always wanted to try this restaurant. I finally did and of course it will not be the last.  Staff was friendly, ambiance was great, and food was delicious.   My plate; Grilled Salmon accompanied by garlic mashed potatoes and brocolis, everything was delicious, expect the brocolis that I found to be too big and not cooked enough. The rest was so great.  My boyfriend had the classic hamburger that was also delicious with the fries that were too die for (I love a restaurant that has good fries on the menu).  They also divide the restaurant by putting couples in the front half of the restaurant and they put the families in the bigger area at the end of the restaurant. I found it too be a very good idea, because it is a family restaurant and of course you do not want to be having supper next to kids running everywhere. I found that a good move from them, so they could grab both types of clientele."}
{"text":"Went at 5pm on a Sunday. It was packed with kids!!! Food was good, plate size is huge, noise... Well, yeah, a lot of it... Do not go there if you're looking for French cuisine, it actually a fusion restaurant with Italian and American influences."}
{"text":"Big mistake choosing this restaurant for our date night. The menu is way to big and it's lacking focus. After contemplating for ever on what to order we both decided to play it safe and order the burgers. This burger was so bland, a McDonald's Big Mac has more flavour. I give it one star because out server was nice but other than that; ugly old decor, bad menu, bad food, I do not recommend!"}
{"text":"My favourites are definitely the avocado rolls and the Asian chicken salad!  Staff is always smiling and happy to serve you. Great for a small group or large group. Easy to find parking which is always a plus."}
{"text":"Sitting in our hotel room, after being in Montreal for nearly a week my wife and I were tired and were looking for something close to get a good dinner at.  Let the search on Yelp begin.  Looking on the map we came across Elixor.  Close by and in the opposite direction of all the traffic, we thought we could not go wrong.   When approaching the restaurant, which is attached to a shopping center, I was not expecting to be dazzled by décor on the inside.  However, upon entering Elixor both my wife and I were stunned.  It felt almost grand, something like you would expect in Las Vegas.  Tall golden pillars held the ceiling up and all the booths had large oversized backs.  We were sat promptly by a great host.  This is where all the quick service stopped.  It took our server nearly 10 minutes to come and bring us our first drinks, which were just water.  From there it took another 10-15 minutes for her to come back and get our food order.  From this point, we didn't see her again for nearly 10 minutes.  The food runner thankfully filled our glasses for us after dropping the food of at our table.  I ordered the Yucatan Chicken and at this point was not expecting much based on the service.  However, the food was shockingly good.  My chicken was cooked perfect with a crispy skink and a juicy interior.  The Mexican style rice was seasoned perfectly and tasted incredible.  The mango salsa was definitely fresh and a welcomed addition to the plate.  After finishing our food and our server took our plates, she once again disappeared.  Waiting nearly 15 minutes to get our check and pay.  By the time we were leaving the restaurant both my wife and I felt frustrated.  The only saving grace for the restaurant was the food, but to me, service is equally if not slightly more important than the food.  If a restaurant service decent food but has impeccable service people will remember that.  If the food is the best and the service is miserable, the miserable aspect is all that people will remember about the restaurant."}
{"text":"Excellent service, delicious food, right portions. Deserve 5 star"}
{"text":"Great food. Love the Pad Thai! only thing I recommend not getting is their margaritas. Other than that everything else I have had there is awesome. including amazing cheesecake!"}
{"text":"Salad was bad it lacked flavour had to force myself to eat it! The appetizers were okay, the waiter was lost in the clouds, making mistake after mistake and seems like the staff weren't understanding each other,but the drinks were good and we got an okay welcome but a very warm goodbye so I'll definitely give it another go before I make it a spot to go to again and again or just walk away altogether"}
{"text":"Came here with a large group of people from work. Huge selection of food so there is something for everyone. Service was good and fast. Good place to come with a large group of people. The place was busy."}
{"text":"My husband and I had dinner here recently and it was good.  3.5 stars.    I had the Maui Salad ($16.75) and my husband had the Fish and Chips ($19.95).  My salad had lots of ingredients in it, which I liked, and it was also pretty colourful.  It had mixed greens, matchstick carrots, cucumbers, yellow peppers, red peppers, mango, chicken breast slices and fried wonton pieces.  It usually comes with green onions and sesame seeds, but I asked them not include those.  The menu also said it comes with cashews, but I didn't get any for some reason, which is a shame because I think the salad would have benefited from the nutty crunch.  Nonetheless, it was good.  When the menu said \"crispy wontons\" I was expecting strips, kind of like \"tortilla strips\" you get in salads, but they were literally 2 big wonton squares deep fried.  They were gigantic and very puffy.  They were also drizzled with a honey sauce, so they were slightly sweet.  I thought the wonton crisps were creative and interesting.  The salad itself was tasty.  Ingredients were all fresh (no limpy or rotten vegetables).  The mango could have been a little riper in my opinion though.     My husband's fish and chips were ok.  I was so excited when I saw that they were shoestring fries, but was a bit disappointed when I tasted them because they were kind of soft and dry :(  My husband felt that the fish could have been cooked a bit longer, as it wasn't flaky enough.    Service was good.  Decor is typical of suburban mega-restaurants."}
{"text":"Un restaurant avec beaucoup beaucoup de choix et tous diversifié. C'est vraiment étonnant le choix qu'ils ont, mais vraiment. Tse un steakk style argentin, du pâté chinois, des pâtes, des pizzas, de la bouffe de casse-croutte, des plats style thai, des mega salades et j'en passe. Bref, il y en a du stock. Si vous y aller le midi, il y a des speciaux du midi avec une dizaine de choix. Mais le soir je vous conseille de prévoir un gros 30 minutes pour faire votre choix. Okey je crois que vous avez compris qu'il y a beaucoup de choix. J'ARRÊTE.  Alors, j'ai pris dans le menu midi express un steak et frite avec sauce Chimi churry. Yummy. Ça venait avec une soupe. J'ai oublié c'était quoi mais elle etait bonne.Mon steak était cuit comme je l'avais demandé et était très bon. J'ai vu les plats de mes collègues et wow ça impressionne. Surtout le pâté chinois et les salades.   Il y a une jolie terrasse avec vue sur la rue principale du centropolis et du Colosus. Je met un 3*, car le décor est digne d'un resto qui était \"in\" dans les années 80-90. Et un 3*, car même si le service pour recevoir les plats à été très rapide, le serveur n'est jamais venu nous voir pour savoir si tout allait bien. J'ai attendu très très très  longtemps pour de l'eau et je déteste cela. Donnes-moi de l'eau monsieur le serveur et je serai comblé."}
{"text":"Revolting.  I took my wife here for her birthday. She ordered the Grande Mexican Burrito. The dish looked delicious... but the first bite revealed a rubber band. We immediately went to the manager. His response? \"it must have fallen in from somewhere. It happens. What do you want me to say.\" He then asked if she wanted another one. We said no then he grabbed the plate from my wife's hands and threw it, the fork and knife in the garbage and walked away. Not even an apology.   Chewing on a rubber band that was wrapped up in your burrito: Disgusting. To be treated the way we were by the MANAGER?! Appalling."}
{"text":"Lorsque l'on entre dans ce restaurant, on note la grandeur de l'endroit. Cela fait penser à un grand bistro parisien avec le \"brouah\" de la salle\" et les cliquetis des verres qui s'entrechoquent :) La diversité de la carte est impressionnante. Vous trouverez sûrement un plat qui vous plaira ! L'entrée avec l'avocat est bonne. La présentation des entrées est soignée.  Attention, les portions des plats principaux sont énormes, même les salades ! cela nous rappelle bien que nous sommes en Amérique du Nord et pas en Europe !  Les plats de type mexicains sont bons. Quant aux desserts, ils sont énormes ! il y a à manger pour 4 personnes dans une assiette ! la pomme phylo maison à la mode est excellente et que dire du brownien napoléon ultime au chocolat !   En résumé, on mange bien et on passe un agréable moment malgré le \"brouah\" dans le restaurant.  Mes notes : Ambiance : 7/10, Service : 7/10, Nourriture : 7.5/10, Propreté : 7.5/10, Rapport Qualité prix : 7/10 Ma note globale : 7.2/10"}
{"text":"You know those nights when you want to go out to eat but you are a big group and no one can decide what they want? GO TO ELIXOR! It's my favorite place to go to in Laval and they have the biggest freaking menu ever. You'll often find yourself struggling to decide what you want to eat but that's a great problem to have. I hate when you go somewhere and there is nothing to choose from. I'm a very picky eater so having a lot of variety is good for me.  The avocado spring rolls are the best thing on the menu and if you haven't tried them yet you are missing out! What are you waiting for!?   My usual go to meal is a Cobb Salad and its HUGE! Seriously, Elixor knows nothing about portion control but I don't mind. Yes, its $13.95 for a salad but guess what? I have it for dinner AND lunch the next day.   I've had their pastas, burgers, ribs, etc and I've never been let down. The service is great, the location is awesome, and the food is top notch. I want to give a 4.5 rating but it won't let me. Sorry guys!"}
{"text":"I really don't know how to start this review... Not because it was a bad experience... but because it wasn't amazing either. Went with some friends to enjoy a good meal... the menu tho... like 50pages... I couldn't decide if I wanted a burger, ribs.. Or the special table hote with dessert or just a coffee. I did order the tuna salad (with fresh tuna of course) and wasabi dressing. It was aightt. Haha  but really.. it wasn't amazing it was pretty tasty but lacked that ... je ne sais quoi. ;p  Overall... good layout. (Abit big tho) waiters are nice and the location is good. I would recommend it if you want to chill and and enjoy a ton of choices of food.   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"As someone said before, if you cannot agree on where to go, this is the place as they have so many choices. Our bill usually comes under $90 with tip for three mains, two adults and one toddler, two drinks, two coffees and one dessert.  My favorite is the burrito. My husband digs their burger and my 3 year loves the pasta Alfredo. For drinks, try their Daiquiri. It is a bit too sweet for me but my husband likes the strawberry flavour. And all of us love their chocolate cake. We get only one to share between 3 of us.  It is a very good place to eat with children. They have lot of high chairs and the restaurant is spacious, so people will not be bumping in the high chair all the time. They also have coloring paper and crayons for children. If you are not provided with one straight away, ask for it. Keeps children busy.   Women's bathroom is nice and spacious with a diaper changing pad.   If you are a large group, or you are hungry,  or with a kid(s), go there before 1730 for dinner. You can expect to wait 30, 45 minutes after 1800 to be seated.  Overall a nice family restaurant."}
{"text":"Over rated. Basic food with average prices. Typical service nothing special. Not a place I would recommend but not the worst either."}
{"text":"We decided to go on their terrace for a late lunch . They had one waiter outside and we had to wait about 45 min to receive are food. We were already very hungry and the wait was so ridiculous we were both starving. We had to switch seating becaise the sun was burning us and still we were waiting for our food to arrive. And they werent even busy on the terrace... I dont get it. There were 2 tables taken .. Imagine if the terrace was packed then what?! As customers we expect the service to be good and quick if you arent that busy and this was the total opposite. My chicken sandwich was good and the fries as well but my fiancee had their burger and had a stomach ache later that afternoon. Prices are expensive for the quality of food and service... The waiter wasnt very social nor smiling I wanted to engage with him more but just seem like he always wanted to leave just serve the plate and go.. There needs to be some changes there hire another waiter summer always 2 waiters no matter what and 3 when very busy then youll get good reviews and happy customers!"}
{"text":"To begin, my girlfriend and I went to Elixor for our anniversary after hearing good things about it. When we arrived, there was a 25 minute wait, which actually passed much faster than that. The hostess was very polite and even though it was rushing, showed genuine care towards the customers.   When we were finally seated, we were greeted by an enthusiastic female waiter who let us know everything we needed to. Since we had already looked at the menu on line, we were both ready to order right away. I had ordered the bronzed salmon while my girlfriend had the spaghetti, as an entrée we took the cheese and spinach dip.  The dip arrived very quickly, and was fantastic. The only problem was the fact that the \"pita bread\" that came with it was as hard as a rock. The table next to us would stare at us every time they heard us chew down. Nevertheless, the dip made up for it, but I wouldn't order it again.  The salmon was alright, nothing special. The flavours were lacklustre and the sauce used on the plate wasn't the greatest. The asparagus was overcooked and the garlic potatoes tasted extremely plain.   As for the spaghetti, it came with a mere 2 shrimp and was loaded with mushrooms. The spaghetti is also very thin, which coming from an italian background, we weren't used to. There was also barely any sauce, but we still made the best of it.  To sum it up, this place has great service but the food could be better. It might have just been our dishes, but it wasn't very enjoyable. The salads on the other table looked good though! Overall, it was an alright experience."}
{"text":"You really get a good bang for your dollar here. I was very surpised that I was there on valentine's night and it was mostly empty. I didn't get what I ordered because they ran out, but the manager discounted my check for the trouble. I highly recommend the creme brulee and the salmon. I'm a big fan of sangiovese and they had it for 8 dollars a glass. I'm not suggesting its a good place to take the kiddos because the portions are gigantic. And, like most other places I ate while in CA, we waited a very long time for our food."}
{"text":"Normally not my kind of place. But they make everything you can dream of and it's usually pretty good. I'm not a fan of the decor. It feels like a high school gym with some embelishments. But the bathrooms were spotless and that's always important to me."}
{"text":"Tres grand restaurant avec beaucoup de choix au menu. Le personnel est sympathique. J'ai pris une assiette de saumon santé mais malheureusement mon plat n'était pas tres goûteux, pas tres assaisonné. Ma soeur a pris des côtes levées très goûteuses! J'y retournerai peut-être."}
{"text":"I was in town for the week on a business trip to Montreal and I ventured out to find something for dinner and stumbled upon this place. On first appearance I'd say this is a carbon copy of The Cheesecake Factory restaurant you would find in the USA. In fact, maybe it's owned by the same company. In any case, no surprises here on the menu. There are tons of choices of food to choose from. And they come from many different locations. It you want options I highly recommend this place.(Asian,American, Italian etc you name it). With that being said I do think it's a bit overwhelming at times. There are so many options that I don't think this place has one particular option that amazing..However ,the food isn't bad...it's good. It just isn't fantastic to me..I ordered a Cesar salad and stir fry veggies with shrimp for a main course. It was a good amount of food and for the cost I'd say it was well worth it. I think the best thing about this place and The Cheesecake Factory (drumroll ...is the dessert) if you are in a rush or just want something sweet grab it here.  I will say that the service was very good though."}
{"text":"The reason it loses a couple of stars is because of their service.   I went for a late lunch with a friend. It's a huge restaurant with some decor and different seating arrangements. We got to sit in a booth. We ordered the fish and chips (suggestion from our server) and pasta. We received fairly quickly. I really enjoyed my pasta, overall food was good, nothing spectacular.   What I was disappointed about... we weren't finished with our foods yet, when the waitress asked us to pay our bills because she was finishing her shift. I understand she wanted her tip, so we did. She also asked if we wanted our food packed because it was obvious we wouldn't finish it. We  said yes, so she brought the container, and started packing our food on our table while we were having a discussion. She knew she was eavesdropping because she kept looking down and smiling. It was so awkward with her standing next to us so we just went quiet until she was done. Our glasses weren't refilled with water, and we waited for a long time until finally we walked to the new group waiters to ask. However, one waiter reminded us that we had to leave by a certain time because of a reservation when most of the restaurant was empty. If that was a concern to them, then they should have placed us somewhere else from the beginning.   Overall not the greatest experience because of bad service. I wouldn't go there again. They have a large dessert selection. A ton of parking space as well."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch or dinner.  Breakfast or brunch only Saturdays and Sundays 11am-2pm  Really liked selection on their menu"}
{"text":"Accueil sympathique des le départ. Table sur la terrasse donnât sur la rue.  Bonne sélection de vin au verre. Le menu est très varié. J'avais le goût de commander 4 différents plats . J'ai finalement choisi le burger à la sauce BBQ avec frites et mon amie a choisi les mini burgers. Les hamburgers étaient délicieux. Vraiment bon. Les frites également étaient très bonnes. Le menu comporte des choix à différents prix.  Le service fut rapide et Professionel. Il y avait un spécial sur la terrasse de 4:00 à 7:00 sur les bières locales et les alcool de base mais le serveur ne me l'a pas mentionné :-(. Je l'ai appris quand il l'a offert à la table d'a côté."}
{"text":"We took my sister out for her birthday to this restaurant while visiting Montreal. My uncle and aunt really hyped this place up (being the locals) and I have to say it didn't disappoint. There's a lot of good vibes in here, the crowd seemed to be a bit the up scale side and prices seemed very fair for the type of restaurant. I got the St. Louis B.B.Q. Burger and I have to say it was one fine damn burger. Burgers are on the very top of the hard to please me list and they did a very amazing job. The burger had a nice touch of bacon, Swiss cheese, some chippy onions and along the bbq chicken, overall the combination was absolutely amazing. Along with very friendly service, making the night that much better! Props to them."}
{"text":"Elixor is a great place for big groups,  you will find something for every taste,  from pasta to Asian cuisine and various salads. The portions are big and prices are fair. For those who went to the Cheesecake factory in the US,  it seems like a  small replica without the Cheesecake deserts."}
{"text":"Think of Restaurant Elixor as Cheesecake Factory-Canada. Similar decor and menu, though not as large a variety of cheesecake. Had the \"Palais the Poulet Croustillant\" (Crispy Chicken Pallazo) which is served on basil pasta with prosciutto, arugula, shaved parmesan and toasted pine nuts. Very good and somewhere I'd return to."}
{"text":"Ce que j'aime de ce restaurant est le choix diversifié de plat, le menu est interminable. Il y en a donc pour tous les goûts. Toutefois, tout n'y est pas toujours bons. Les hamburgers sont servis dans une seule cuisson (comme écrit sur le menu), et cette cuisson est TROP CUIT. Ils servent donc une viande sèche avec un accompagnement de frites trop salées (je les commande donc sans assaisonnement). Les salades sont de bonnes tailles et délicieuses. Les desserts sont à essayer.  Mes items favoris sont le Daiquiri à la mangue et le poudding au riz brulé.  Restaurant idéal pour les groupes.  Toutefois, le menu diversifié peut être un avantage comme un inconvénient car quelques plats sont des échecs. J'y retourne tout de même régulièrement."}
{"text":"This is a nice looking restaurant with an upscale-casual vibe. I really like it as a place to go. Unfortunately the food is really mediocre. My sister lives fairly close and when I'm in town she always suggests this place. My 70 year old dad really likes it too. I was born and raised in Montreal but live in the USA now & I just think there are so many great restaurants in the area that it's a shame to waste a meal here. I admit, I'm a bit of a food snob. I don't mean fancy, but I do mean good and high quality. This place is really average. But again the ambience is nice."}
{"text":"I hadn't been to elixor for over 10 years and the last time was not such a great experience. But when my friend said let's do a girls night out and have supper at elixor, I said: \"why not\", its been so long maybe things have gotten better. Well yes and no.   Usually good restaurants don't have extensive menus. When I see that a restaurant has over 10 pages of menu, it worries me. No chef can be good at everything, this restaurant offers salads, burgers, pasta, fish, steak,specialty dishes, I mean everything, from Italian, to Chinese to Mexican,  just going through the menu was exhausting and confusing.  My friend asks the waiter what's the specialty here? And his answer was \"what do you want.\" That's not a good answer, the right answer would be we are good and steak, or fish, or anything thats Italian, dont ask that person what they want, obviously if they are asking you its because they want your opinion. Anyways that didn't sit well with me.  We were four and we all ordered different things. I ordered the chicken Pallazo, which is fried chicken on a bed of tomato sauce and creamy spaghettini topped with prosciutto. The portions are very big, my chicken was very dry and some parts were burnt, but the spaghettini and sauce was pretty good.  Overall it was a girls night and I did not want to complain as the purpose was just to be together. But this restaurant needs a huge upgrade, the decor is very outdated, and the seating area, specially benches are worn out. I took pictures of our plates and the seating. The presentation of the food is great but taste and seasoning is lacking, at least in my case."}
{"text":"This is the first time I've been there for brunch and I was told that they had great breakfasts... but I was disappointed to be honest with you. They have a huge menu but a super tiny section for brunch. I ended up having egs with sausage so it's really hard to botch that plate. I would go back just to try another plate like that breakfast burrito but sounded odd on the menu but when on the plate, looked delicious!"}
{"text":"We did a quick lunch here and it was super-busy.    I can tell you that all of the salads are HUGE - at least three people would be full from one of them.  The salmon salad was very good.  The Pad Thai was tasty but didn't really rock our world - there is better.  Everything was fresh and the place is clean.  The noise level was high, but it did not slow down the efficient service.  On the other tables I did spy a few handsome burgers that were being devoured - just not my choice for a lunch food.  They serve brunch, at least on the weekends, from what I gathered."}
{"text":"One of my favourite restaurant in Laval! It is literally my go to for promising food!! I've been coming here for years!  The ambiance is very elegant yet contemporary as well with a dash of fine dining. The ceilings is what catches my attention everytime. They have a painted sky with beautiful designs and is really unique as if you're looking us outside with a pretty blue sky with scatters of white peaceful clouds. They also stand out for their amazing summer cocktails which are served during. The winter time too wow!! Lovee how they make their piña colada's here!   They've got everything you possibly are up for .. The menu is quite extensive. Furthermore, the plates are large and very generous with a decent price. I'm surprised!! Amazing food.. I'm Literally not kidding.. Last time, I had their coconut shrimp ( they were battered with beer , flour and coconut) cooked to perfection, their roasted cauliflower is prepared differently now and more efficient. They chop the head in many pieces and roast it evenly in the oven. Previously, they use to just cut into half a head of a whole cauliflower and just put the whole thing in the oven to roast it. However, this time they used more time to prep it up properly cutting each individual strand and roast it evenly. It came with cheese and raisins on top Delicious!!!!! We ordered the beat salad thinking it was small but boy was I wrong it was huge! It looked like a main course meal. The vinaigrette was Amazingly delicious. As the main course, omg i regret ordering so much food I was so full after all the appetizers..but I also had the fresh fish of the day with veggies and rice. Not very happy with the cook on the fish it was a little bit overcooked and dry .. My special date had the raw tuna as a main course and we agreed to switch it up woow boy was his raw fresh tuna amazing ! I wish I chose it instead :p.   The service: this is where they lose points.. It's always long hard to get a server to pay attention to you. The service is slow but understandable. It's a huge place and fills up almost everyday so quickly. Ohhh one thing I can't let go, their pepper and salt holders are a hassle too ahahaha i always have to unscrew the knot to dabb a little in my hand because it doesn't come out otherwise.   Overall, I come here almost every week and I am one happy customer and will definitely be back and will be happy with the food as always. They almost never disappoint!! Yummy and I definitely recommend this place for a date or if you come with family it's fantastic."}
{"text":"Always delish and great service.  Large portions so be prepared to take leftovers home!  place could do with a refresh though."}
{"text":"In Montreal there is no cheesecake factory. We have Elixor and to be honest I don't think it is as good as cheesecake factory. The location isn't bad and it is a very big place so finding a table won't be a problem. The service is horrible though. The waiters are not a problem however since this place is so huge the food takes forever to arrive. In terms of how it tastes it's nothing special. Overall if you are visiting the city and you need a place to eat, I would check this place out."}
{"text":"A very versatile menu, that covers most tastes. Like the lunch menu a very good price to quality ratio. One of my favourite is the cheddar - beer soup.  Caesar salad is lite and not the creamy versions found in most restaurant. Never had a bad pick with the daily specials. Complex dishes and harmonious flavours. Kids menu is more than appetizing , generous sizes and affordable prices. Good selection of deserts and a very good cheese cakes versions. Service is all around good and professional. The only negative of this restaurant is the waiting on busy days and no reservation if you want to plan a group outing . I would definitely recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"It can be a little too loud sometimes especially on Saturday nights and be prepared to wait if you don't have a reservation. I recommend the Maui Salad, so delicious and filling, and has been on the menu for over 10 years. If you're a bigger group try the VIP entree, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"The 3 star rating for this place is not because i had a bad experience or that there was anything particularly negative , but just like a few of the other reviews on this page , I agree that there was nothing that made it a standout either. So firstly, the location is very big , a ton of seating even for large groups and the menu has enough options that even in a group of people with a variety of different tastes , they will likely be able to find something to order. The decor inside is very crisp, clean and inviting and service was also on point. Our server was very friendly and quick , she did a great job and didnt miss a beat ! The prices themselves are reasonable ,especially that the portions are pretty big and the ingredients tasted fresh. The menu being extensive is both good and bad , in the sense that while there are lots of options to choose from , none of the dishes we tried were bad but none were exceptional either, it was very mediocre, a sort of jack of all trades and master of none situation. We had a few appetisers , the avocado rolls were good but the sauce they came with tasted like a regular salad dressing and didn't really pair well. The coconut shrimp were nice and big and crispy without being oily but were a little on the sweet side. The fried mac and cheese balls with marinara and parm were the best of the three , nice and crispy on the outside and gooey on the inside , the sauce that came with it was also flavourful and paired well with it. A few people ordered the specialty shephard's pie , they said overall it was good and came with some nice fresh veggies but a touch on the salty side. The four cheese bow tie pasta was not bad , it did the trick and wasnt particulary bad but there was really nothing special about it. The Grilled Chicken BLT was pretty good , the chicken breast was well cooked and still juicy and the sauce inside was a nice pairing with the chicken and bacon, the side of mashed potatoes were nice and creamy with good seasoning without being too buttery.  The best part of the meal had to be the dessert, their cheesecake and carrot cake were both fresh and delicious without being overkill on the sweetness. Their cappuccino was also well prepared. So while this wouldnt be my first choice of restaurant in the area , it was not a bad experience and I wouldnt be opposed to going back at some point either."}
{"text":"J'ai commander un burger avec guacamole, monterey jack et bacon. Le burger etais enorme et tres juteux, une bonne portion de frite mince avec un chili au feve noir pour 20$. Je n'aime generallement pas les burger mais si je doit en recommander un, ca sera de chez Elixor!"}
{"text":"There can sometimes be quite a lineup for the table but the food is pretty good.  The pad thai was only so so but I must say I am a fan of the Frank's BBQ sandwich.  Their fries are nicely seasoned.  The desserts are usually good if you have room as the portions here are on the big side."}
{"text":"I came here with my entire family to celebrate the birthday of an out-of-towner cousin. Boy did I feel embarrassed that this was the choice of restaurant for the special occasion. First of all, since the menu is so large, it is really hard to choose what to eat. They don't really have any specialties and everyone's food seemed to be overwhelmingly mediocre. I ordered the shrimp spaghetti with scampi sauce. My food arrived about 10 minutes later than everyone else's and was barely luke warm. While the sauce wasn't terrible, the shrimp was so over cooked it was inedible. While I would normally complain, I didn't want to wait for another meal. I ended up spending 32$ on plain own spaghetti which was truly disappointing.  I don't blame the waiter for disliking having to take care of a table of 15 people but he could have been more pleasant. He never came around to ask how our food was and my water was empty for a majority of the meal. Overall, there are much much better restaurants to go to in Montreal as well as the West Island."}
{"text":"Just had lunch here with an old friend, I had not been here in several years.  I was extremely disappointed with the quality and the value.  I ordered a lunch special, the toasted pasta came with half a bowl of soup and a coffee.  The tomato soup was ok although it was not hot, the portion was very small.  The pasta was below average, the potion was ok but it was in a bath of sauce and 1 hour later my stomach is still complaining.  It did not have a specific taste.  It was just very plain with a lot of sauce.  My friend ordered the tuna, which was not properly cooked, the inside was not cooked at all and he hardly ate any of it.  We also ordered 2 draught beers which we had to return because they were flat, the waiter was very pleasant and polite and replaced them for us but the next two beers were just as bad.  Not impressed, i wish the owners good luck, but they need a major change in the kitchen and they need to step up their game, all this cost approx $70 tax and tip included, a very expensive lunch for a very mediocre experience,"}
{"text":"Great little spot to go . The food and outdoor terrace is great place to relax and enjoy the meal. The waitress this time was great and food was on point ."}
{"text":"Late night at the office and to tired to cook so we came here. I have been here at least 10 times. Food is always pretty good.  We ordered some starters and as always pretty good.  My main meal was Filet Mignon and I got pretty much what I expected. Very Good. The side order of veggies was just OK but to boring for me. But the fried onions were awesome. I am sure I will be back here again,"}
{"text":"Pathetic excuse for a make shift Cheesecake Factory. Food is sub-par at best. Hostesses don't seem to like their jobs. Waiters are hit or miss, you'll get one that's amazing or you'll get one that's a asshole with a chip on his shoulder"}
{"text":"Elixor is a west island classic. Been there for years. Prices are very reasonable, portions are good and flavours are nice too. There is a good drinks selection. They seem to have renovated the bar section recently (& maybe the entire restaurant). In the winter time, we often go for the soup which is always tasty. There is a wide variety of plates. I sometimes just take one of the appetizers, which is a big enough portion for me. Of course, their specialty is cheese cake. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"One of my favourite restos!!! Loove their salads: cobb, indochina and maui salads :) i also love their franks bbq sandwich. I havent had much else on their menus so I cant vouch for them, but from what I have had, i've enjoyed. Always good service. Nice and clean resto also."}
{"text":"We had made reservations for 8pm on a Saturday night for a girls' night. We got there at 8, and waited until 8:45 when we were finally seated. The hostess was cold and offered a simple \"sorry\" for our ridiculous wait. We weren't offered any sort of compensation (i.e. comp'd drinks or free dessert), which was pretty poor customer service.  The place is decently decorated; it's made to look nice and grand, but I feel that the style they're going for isn't carried throughout their menu and staff style. The staff look like they work at Best Buy with their khakis with an apron.   Our waiter was pretty nice though, which helped a little after our wait. We ordered libations and then our meals. I ordered the Spicy Thai Beef Tenderloin Salad, and asked for my met medium rare. When it came out, what I thought would be small strips of steak, turned out to be two skewers with ginormous chunks of beef. I was disappointed because although the beef was well seasoned, it came out rare (i.e. seared on each side and slid onto the skewer), and the meat was tough. The flavouring in the salad was decent, but quite frankly it's nothing to write home about.   I was hoping dessert would be better because they are known for their cheesecake. That being said, I shared the brownie with ice cream with one of my girlfriends (it had been tempting us while we were waiting to be seated). One of the biggest underwhelm-ments (I know, that's not a word). The brownie was more walnut than chocolate, and the flavouring was off.   All in all, I wasn't terribly impressed. I wouldn't recommend it to the next person.  And if you do decide to go, don't bother with reservations; they sure aren't respected!"}
{"text":"Tres belle et grande salle à manger et magnifique terrasse, comme tous les nouveaux restos du centropolis. Agreable et chic, tres bon service egalement. Toilettes propres. Bouffe correct :)"}
{"text":"Bonne nourriture, beaucoup de choix mais prix de plus en plus dispendieux et quantité à la baisse..  J'y suis allé régulièrement durant plus de 5 ans. J'ai vu les quantité diminue et les prix montre, la recette de tôt restaurant qui pogne et qui souhaite gonfler ses revenus.  En dehors de cela, pas mal tout est bon. Je suis un mordus du hamburger St-Louis avec le Chili.  Les personnes avec qui j'ai été ont goûter plusieurs pates, poulet, poisson et viande et tous ont trouvé cela bon.   Dessert toujours aussi bon et généreux  L'étoile perdus est vraiment à cause des prix qui ont gonfler. On recule maximum 2 ans, le Burger St Louis était 12$, Pour avoir une salade en entrée (qui était énorme) C'était 3$ Si je me souvient bien. En bref, ce repas avec taxe et pourboire arrivait autour de 20$. Maintenant, juste le Burger est autour de 20$ avec les taxes. La salade coûte maintenant 4.75$ avant taxes. Donc le même repas, taxe et pourboir, est maintenant autour de 30$+."}
