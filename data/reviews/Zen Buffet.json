{"text":"It felt like it took this place forever to open. When it did, I was disappointed in the very bland atmosphere; it looks like there was a garage sale with awkward and mismatched paint and outdated dining sets. And the music? Well, there was none. It was almost uncomfortable just being there! The food wasn't bad, but it was by no means on the high side of good. I prefer Shanghai Buffet, which is just a little further East on Bell; it has better food and a MUCH better atmosphere! Sorry Zen!!!"}
{"text":"My daughter and I visited Zen Buffet recently, and the experience was less than desirable. After eating we both felt queasy and I mentioned this to the manager, that went over like a load of bricks. Shortly after eating we both became very sick, will not provide details but knew it was from the food by the symptoms. 

The next day I called to complained and ask for a refund. I did not feel that I should pay for lousy service and bad food. I was told that I would need a doctors excuse, WHAT? I knew it was from the food, we both felt fine before we went in and ate, not a thing wrong with us. I explained that I was not going to pay two 25.00 co-pays for a doctors excuse and why would I call and complain the very next day if I was lying, especially over $23.00. They did not care, said it was my fault that I became sick. 

I will never return and telling everyone of my experience.

{"text":"This place just opened a few months, I was so impressed by Zen's buffet in Chandler,  a few friends and I decided to check this out also.
At a glance, it is pretty typical of another Chinese super buffet; large varieties of everything, very good selection. However, when compare to the one in Chandler, This Zen is definitely two steps behind.  Since this is new, it is clean, it is expected.

I've noticed many dishes are \"deep fried\" rather than \"Stir fried\", I also noticed, many dishes are SOAK - BATH in oil. Far more so than other Chinese buffets I've been to ( greasy, that's the word I was looking for). Other than too GREASEEEY, it is pretty much the same as other Chinese buffets.
I ate heavenly on the Salad and desert section, it is very fresh - no grease. 
Over all its not too bad, just don't set your expectation hi, don't look for anything new,  or exciting. 

What you will find is  a typical Chinese buffet  food."}
{"text":"This was NOT worth my time or money. The food tastes bad. I've had a lot better food at other buffets in Phoenix, but that isn't saying much either! The Panda Buffet near Lake Pleasant & Deer Valley is a lot better as far as buffets go. I will not be going back!"}
{"text":"two of the eight reviews here so far are shills... can you figure them out? 

to one... you've only been there four times? I'm sure you've picked up more shifts than that. to the other... contrary to your multiple experiences, i didn't feel so clean inside, especially after finding a rapanzuel-length hair in the cantaloupes. 


my 2 cents: run... don't walk and don't ever look back.


Update: shills are now being filtered, but not forgotten."}
{"text":"It appears the Chinese Buffets are the next Gelato or Starbucks 

I think I am over them. Sorry Rand... 

This is just like the last 4 new buffets I have been to. I swear it is like Groundhog day. 

Everything was good nothing was great. Service was better here but really?? How hard is it to refill drinks and pick up empty plates. 

I will go again i am sure."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a QUICK Chinese buffet, then check out ZEN. If you are expecting fancy, gourmet Chinese food, then go to PF Changs.

They transformed the former Bill Johnson's building into a lovely nine-station Chinese Buffet restaurant with SUPER friendly service. The staff (and customers I kept bumping into) were all very nice and cordial.

The food is not authentic Chinese...I would say more American-Chinese tasting. Zen is your typical, average Chinese buffet place. 

 There is a variety of the more popular Chinese dishes, a dessert station, all fruit station, sushi station, and soups, etc... There are MANY fried foods too.

I'm very leery about eating at Buffets (esp Chinese Buffets). It was pretty busy during a weekday lunch hour and the foods were at their proper temperatures. Clean restroom (a good sign)."}
{"text":"I am generally not a fan of buffets. I tend to eat more than I need. We drive by this location several times a week and decided to see what it was like. I was surprised. I sampled small proportions of most of what was offered. I started with the sushi. The Ahi and Salmon was tender and tasty. The pieces were small. Remember this is a buffet not a sushi restaurant. The quality of the sushi was surprisingly good. Now for the rest of the food. It was hot, plentiful, and tasted good. They have a good variety, from frog legs to pizza. The restaurant was clean and everyone was exceptionally nice. If your glass started to get low someone was there to fill it. Dirty plates were picked up quickly.  If you are into buffets I don't see how you could be disappointed. Would I recommend? Yes. Would I go back. Yes. Most people go to a buffet to eat lots of food. Zen Buffet has that. Lots of food and quality was good.  So why did I give it 3 stars and not 4? I will never be a fan of a buffet."}
