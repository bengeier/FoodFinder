{"text":"Price changes every time I go there, has gone up from.around 8 bucks to 10.64 for the same meal.  The quality is never consistent,sometimes even cold food if u get there at beginning of lunch.  The staff has become somewhat rude since owner started spending more time at other location.  I really was a big advocate of Pedro's,  but in last 2 months it's ruined it for me."}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican at it's finest

Can't beat the 5$ Burrito"}
{"text":"This place is across the CSU campus and it's the only reason it has stayed open. I have been going to this place for the last two years at least twice a week but not anymore. I bought a bowl last week and the girl working swiped my card three times so I got charged three times. A couple of days later I checked my bank statement and realized so I went and talked to the manager. I told him the situation and he asked me for a receipt. Never in the two years that I have going there they never gave me one. Then he said that there must be a glitch in my bank's system (very unlikely.) Then he said \"How do I know you are not trying to rip us off?\" I said thank you and walked out. NEVER am I going back to that place. I can't complain about the food, for $5.00 it's acceptable. But the service is horrible. In the two years never once did they say \"Hello how is it going\" or something along that line or never even once asked me my name. This place is not bad to eat but the service is what is killing it. Never am I going back to this place. Guess I have to find a new favorite spot. The Chinese place down the street sounds like a good choice."}
{"text":"So, this is essentially a knockoff chipotle/qdoba located on/by cleveland state's campus. I ordered from here off of uber eats. The food quality/taste was just \"ok\"."}
{"text":"This used to be my regular lunch spot when I went to CSU. It offered some different variety other than the usual American food that is up and down the street. Burritos were very good and not that much different than chipotle. Actually felt like they loaded them up more. Very cheap prices for what you get. If I am back in the area I will definitely stop by again."}
{"text":"Ukulele... Is kinda a funny looking/spelled word. However, it's pretty much spelled like it sounds. Hmm. Kinda a catch, this Pedro's place is.

Good $5 substantial burritos. Not quite the quality of Chipotle, but it's different and has its own style and uniqueness. 

If they ever do a commercial to promote the $5 pricing, they should not do it like Subway did. Even though subways' was indeed successful. It was pretty dumb, agree? And Even though Quiznos failed, they should do it like they did. Instead of eating a $5 bill, the person could eat a bottle of hot sauce. Bottle and all. I don't know.

But for real, this place is a solid Cleveland value. yelp!!"}
{"text":"One of the few gluten free options on CSU's campus. They  do have queso and chipotle sauce which you can't get at a chipotle. Overall, I'd say it's hit or miss. I've had really good and bad experiences (cold food), but I keep crawling back. When it's good it's really good. Go ahead and roll the dice and may the odds be ever in your favor."}
{"text":"Run away screaming. Food not hot, looked like it had been sitting there forever. I should have trusted my little voice and left."}
{"text":"Not gross! Dragged butt over here for lunch as was working down the street. Ordered and inhaled a burrito w Spanish rice, chicken, sour cream, cheese, pico, and lettuce. This place would be above chipotle on the Awesome Scale if the deco wasn't so lick and stick. Summary: I'd do it again with pleasure."}
{"text":"The price is right - however, the food was incredibly bland. I had a beef burrito - boring! Co-worker had a burrito bowl... and the chicken was grey! 
The woman behind the counter was very rude.  I won't be visiting again."}
{"text":"I love this place.  I work nearby and I eat here several times a week, every week.  The value here is incredible.  The regular price for two tacos is only $3.50!  That would be a good price anywhere but for downtown, it's a great price.  On Taco Tuesday you get three tacos for $3.50!  We're talking about freshly grilled vegetables and grilled chicken breast - real meat, not fast-food reconstituted meat product, but real meat - and a full array of available toppings.  The tacos are delicious, soft or hard, especially with the spicy-tangy \"Chipotle\" sauce.  I don't order rice or beans so I can't comment on those but the meat and vegetables are consistently good.  The vegetables, tomatoes, and lettuce are always fresh, in fact all the ingredients (that don't come from a can) are.  I don't think they do pick-up but the regular service is fast, I usually only wait a couple minutes in line before my turn.  I have only a few tiny nitpicks, (1) not all of the employees are overly friendly (though some of the girls are awesome), (2) the corn tastes like it came out of a can, and (3) if they're not careful straining the tomatoes, you end up with tomato juices inside the taco and it can get soggy and can fall apart.  All told, though, these are minor complaints for a place that delivers great food at an extremely reasonable price.  This is my favorite places to eat lunch downtown in the theater district."}
{"text":"I chose this place because it was located in my hotel and I love Mexican food but it ended up being a big fail. I ordered a taco salad and the first thing I noticed was it cold. Not just the veggies but everything was cold. I heated it up in the microwave in my room. Once I got it all melty and hot, I thought  it would be perfect but nope. Totally bland even with two kinds of hot sauce on it. The meats are cut into these weird little cubes that are not enjoyable or even taste real at all. Totally disappointed, second bad experience in as many nights."}
{"text":"My first taco literally had 2 beans a dollop of guacamole on it.  It was all Bread.
My second taco had all grilled onions and nothing else.  Worst tacos I've ever had.  My friends bowl had rice and grilled onion and she didn't feel too good afterwards!"}
{"text":"I have been frequenting this location since it opened because the price is reasonable and it is convenient - only minutes away from my work. However, I have been observing a steady decline in the quality of both food and service. I rarely see any smile from either the cashier or the food server, and often I have been asked to repeat the ingredients. Today, the rice in my burrito is very chewy and crunchy, I.e., not cooked thoroughly. 

It is sad that I will skip this location whenever I can."}
{"text":"I'm been going to Pedro's since they open. I love the $5 1/2burrito meal! Just enough food for a lunch that doesn't put me to sleep like A big burrito from Chipotle. I taste no difference between Pedro's and other burrito places. Good deal for a good lunch"}
{"text":"I work about 100 feet from Pedros front door.  There was a time when I would eat here 3-5 times a week. If I like something I don't easily saturate myself so 5 days a week would not bother me. A burger would be another story.
Anyway, I'm only writing my review now because they have lost all credibility with me.
They have been serving dry rice way too often and the consistency of all other items is beyond acceptable. They also have people in there now who don't care. Previously there were always smiles at the counter. Now it's just a lifeless girl who seems to hate everyone and everything.
The straw that broke me was that they ran out of their 1/2 bowl sizes and they wouldn't just sell me a 1/2 bowl with the correct amount of food in a full bowl container.  
I just walked out and I may not go back again."}
{"text":"Third time and never a charm. The first time I had gone here the food was cold but I gave it a second try that time the staff was rude and I was over charged. I tried it again today much to my dismay. The lady who made my burrito was pleasant but she rolled a burrito I knew would be a mess. When I asked for a container for my burritos left overs she asked her coworker who said no we dont do that. She said it in a way that I didnt ask for a container but like I had asked for the most unethical thing ever. My sloppy burrito is a slurry of tasteless slush in the middle. Since I dont have a container to eat it with it will go to waste.....what a shame. Also guacamole shouldn't have the same consistency of mustard."}
{"text":"The upside is that it's only $5.  The downside is that you feel like you're getting overcharged for what amounts to a. . .uh. . . rental.  

The food quality is questionable at best;  I've had black beans that weren't fully cooked before, which is pretty hard to do considering they clearly came from a can."}
{"text":"Located just opposite of Cleveland State University, Pedros provide you a authentic Burrito Bowl for only $5. A lot of quantity, price & taste better than the Chipotle, it is the perfect place to have a lunch or take away if you are near to CSU. I at least go to Pedros twice a week, Must recommended for students as you cannot get a better deal in Downtown than the one at Pedros!"}
{"text":"One of the best (cheapest) places around campus to grab a quick bite. Can't beat the $5 combo and they're a tasty, different alternative to that one competing burrito place right down Euclid..."}
{"text":"The food is pretty decent, love the price, and the staff is usually friendly. The place could use a good cleaning and the staff could care a bit more. Steak is occasionally over cooked and super chewy, but its usually delicious. Love coming here for a hearty lunch. $7 and your full for hours."}
{"text":"What a poor imitation of Chipotle or Qdoba. Watery rice. Chips soggy with oil. Bad service. Stale tortillas. And they wrap the burrito into a ball."}
{"text":"I guess the quality of the food made sense for the price (grande burrito for $5), but I would much rather pay a $1.50 extra somewhere else to get more, and better tasting food. Neither the staff or the decor made up for the lack of food quality. I've only been once but I don't think I'll be back unless I hear of any change in quality."}
