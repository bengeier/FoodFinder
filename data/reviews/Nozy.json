{"text":"New-ish Japanese place in Saint-Henri. Tried it out for lunch and really enjoyed it. Decor is tasteful and comfortable. Menu is small but well considered; everything on it looked delicious. Finally decided on the salmon platter, and my friend had the appetizer assortment. Food is tasty and fresh. A bit pricey, though, which is the only reason I deducted the fifth star. Still, a welcome addition to the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Very nice cosy little place. The food was excellent. And the host was friendly. The Uni Don and the Assorted Sashimi were very fresh and yummy.  Would recommend to friends."}
{"text":"Food is great, but a little pricy given the small portion.  We made reservation for 1:00 pm, but the restaurnat was quite empty at that time. They are serving Uni Don ($28) these days, so don't miss the chance! My friend had Take Kago($17), which is a combination of 5 entrée. The eggplant purée and karaage are pretty good."}
{"text":"Fantastic place.  The menu is small but very well thought out.  The salmon chirashi is my favorite.  I get veggie dip every time, the karaage is delicious and the specials are great.  I had a black cod in miso that was awesome.  I eat there almost every week now."}
{"text":"It was good, authentic and filling we were thankful that the waitress forgot one of our dishes."}
{"text":"Had a nice meal with my friends. The food was wonderfully fresh and the atmostphere was pleasant for a nice rainy evening. We found that the place is easy to find and conveniently close to a metro (just a little far from where we live, but definitively worth it)."}
{"text":"Had a \" not on the menu \" sashimi platter for 2 made by chef Nozomu :) great seletion and good portion."}
{"text":"Omg. \"My tongue went through a sea adventure.\" Sea Umami game so strong. Next level sashimi~  We tried the Omakase experience. The uni (sea urchin) and Toro (fatty tuna) are like sea umami bomb waiting to explode in your mouth haha.  The waitress clearly explained each dishes and it really enhance the dining experience.  Amazing night~  Definitely a place to go again.  Bring your dem sexy date there.  That's dat."}
{"text":"The food was excellent but the service was pretty terrible, and too slow for a quick lunch. I hope this improves!"}
{"text":"When available, you must get their exquisite toro and uni don combo. Also served with caviar, miso soup and salad. Their sashimi appetizer is also a good choice, while I was less impress with their unagi don, the rice quality is not consistent. The place is tiny and simple, not recommended for large group, but food quality is good and price is fair, worth going and returning."}
{"text":"Excellent Japanese restaurent in mtl. Very simple setup, very delightful dishes.   Heavenly uni don (seasonal dish) will melt in your mouth! It lives up to the hype.  You won't find a better value for uni at this quality -- while uni is very pricey and so is the dish at $30, you get a generous amount here.  Also the Kaisen don was very good, with a fresh and pleasant selection of sashimi including sweet shrimp (delicious), ikura, quail egg, salmon and more.  Recommended to experience Nozy at least once if you are a lover of Japanese food in mtl :)"}
{"text":"I read up about this place at one of the blogs on new places to try in Montreal so decided to give it a try. Quite impressed with their food, so fresh and great presentation! I'm surprise this place does not have any reviews yet cus they def deserves some!   I came in on a wed night at Aron d 830 an hour before the close. It was quite busy in there but manageable to get seated right away with a few tables opened. I like the fact that they kept their menus simple with just a few things to select from but def brings characters and everything is very different.   I wasn't too hungry but wanted to try their salmon so I went for the salmon chirashi. Which was amazingly good!!  It came with a miso soup, side salads and some pickles on the side. They were also super fast with their servings!!! I literally order and within 5 mins they already brought the food to me. I was quite surprise. The salmon was tender. It comes with the sashimi, half cooked ones, tartar and some eggs on it. I love it!  Not too heavy just about right as i've been eating such heavy stuff in Montreal so this def does it for me. Not to mention my waitress was really nice  too and it seemed like she was the only served there that night.   I would come back again and try their take Kago (chef's choice of apps) and omakase. Def worth a visit!   Oh and they do have a bar there as well :)"}
{"text":"Love this place! It's a little pricey and the service is a bit slow but that's only because the chef makes everything with care and love. The food is fresh and the presentation is spot on."}
{"text":"A lovely cozy japanese resto. It feels like japanese \"comfort\" food, homemade meal. We were a group of 7 and the staff was courteous and patient on explaining the menu. The proportion of the meal is well thought. A must try."}
{"text":"The restaurant is small and cozy. I enjoyed the service, the waitress was lovely! She knows the menu well and was useful.   The food came very fast. The salmon chirashi was great. The fish was fresh and tasty. My boyfriend had the take kago. He enjoyed most of the plates, especially the karaage! The portion size was perfect too. We had the strawberry roll cake for dessert which was also amazing. Overall, my only complain is that the salmon chirashi bowl was filled with too much rice.  Definitely in my list of favorite restaurants now!"}
{"text":"Smelly, limited Options. Very poor air circulation smells like fish and does not make u want to eat your food."}
{"text":"My favourite Japanese restaurant ever. Loved the umeshu drink, the cod was amazing, the sushi incredible! Everything is so nicely presented, fresh and delicious. Refreshingly unpretentious. Will return many, many, many times."}
{"text":"Hidden japanese gem. One of the best japanese places in montreal. Their menu changes from time to time to make sure they serve wathever is fresh. Their rice bowls are the highlights of their restaurant. They all come with pickled veggies, salad, miso soup and topped with a seafood of your choice. My fave until now is the half uni and toro don. Theyre so fresh and melt in your mouth. The appetizers are also amazing. Lately they serve the grilled octopus with an eggplant dip. The octopus is so well made and so tender you just want more.   The staff is very friendly and helpful. The place is very cute and cozy but nit very big so it's better to reserve before going!"}
{"text":"There are plenty of better Japanese restaurants in town. The choices are very limited. Too overpriced for the quality of the food. A tiny bowl of miso soup has absolutely nothing inside costs 3 dollars. It's not even as good as those served in cheap Sushi buffets. Anyways, not impressive. Probably won't come back."}
{"text":"Came with friends around 6:30 on Friday night. The place is quickly filled with two three other groups. Mostly friends gathering. Menu is very selective and the photos on yelp are extensive. Overall the appetizers were all good, but nothing 'wow', a bit light and not as flavorful as the same ones in other izakaya. Uni don was hearty. The fact that they offer this and in such generous quantity can get enough credit because it's such an expensive and delicate ingredient to come by in Montreal. (Though it made me miss even more the ones fresh out of shells in Japan..Anyone knows where else you can get them??)  Didn't like the dessert green tea crème brulee. Tasted like steamed egg, and was served warm. Very weird. And 7.5 dollars? Definitely overpriced.  But overall prices were reasonable, probably a bit cheaper than izakaya.   Btw my husband came here another time for lunch and recommended the soba noodle."}
{"text":"We've been wanting to come here for a while now. We finally gave it a try today. The location is great. it is located on one of the main roads of Griffintown.   I was worried when we stepped in because we did not make a reservation and all the tables were reserved. Luckily, we managed to get seats at the bar. I ordered chicken karaage , salmon chirashi bowl and my partner ordered another ricebowl with salmon, shrimp, and tuna(i forgot the name of the dish). It was the best karaage I have ever had! The chicken was so tender, it almost melts in your mouth ! Both rice bowls were really delicious, the fish was tasty, the rice was cooked perfectly and they both came with miso soup and a nice portion of salad. For dessert, we ordered the kaki-gori (shaved ice) with berries and ice cream. It was heavenly!!! Overall, our bill came up to $65 taxes included + Tip.   I'm only giving it 4 stars, because the service was a little slow but everything else was great. I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Nozy never disappoints! Kaisen don is a must try! And if youre a fan of fatty tuna then the toro tekka don is a must!! If youre lucky and they have it in stock, uni don is also very good!  However, at my last visit, i decided to try something different! Miso black cod and unagi don. Borh was delicious!"}
{"text":"The bluefin toro tekka don and the uni don (seasonal items) are both so delicious!!! The fish is very high quality (think melt in your mouth tuna that you'd normally only get at high-end sushi places) and they serve real wasabi, not the stuff from a mix.  Eating here made me so incredibly happy... then incredibly sad when I finished my bowl.   The $30 price tag for the uni or toro don isn't cheap for a regular dinner, but is pretty fair given the quality of the ingredients.   Went in mid October and they no longer have the shaved ice dessert (sad face). The Japanese cheesecake and pumpkin creme brûlée were available but unfortunately neither tickled my fancy at the time.. wish they had a more traditional dessert available   Restaurant is small and many tables seemed to be reserved on Saturday night during prime dinner time, but a few bar seats seemed to be available if people are just walking in"}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere, serve are great. Best thing on the menu is the sea urchin bowl ! It's fresh and just melts in your mouth. A must try when in season"}
{"text":"Great cozy little spot. Had the salmon (3 ways) over rice and each was fantastic. Friend had the Take Kano box and the fried chicken was incredibly juicy and tender. Miso was served with the dishes as well and it was excellent.   My only suggestion would be to maybe have a little music playing? It was very quiet..."}
{"text":"Wonderful fresh food at Nozy in the St. Henri and Notre Dame de Ouest area  (Sud-Ouest). It you want a special Japanese experience that serves seasonal arrivals, check out Nozy.  They serve fresh cuts of fish (sashimi) seafood like sea urchin, fresh oysters, meats like tender ribs, teriyaki steak, karate (fried chicken), beef tataki and so much more. This is not a sushi placr. This is authentic Japanese food that focuses on fresh seasonal food. The specials change depending on what food is seasonal. Specials come with a miso soup and a salad.  I called before going to make sure there was enough seating. Definitely call before going as the restaurant does not hold a lot of tables. If you are lucky, they might have seats available of you just pop in at lunch. But definitely at dinner time, call to reserve.  Also, because they serve fresh food, they do run out of certain dishes. I went with a group of 4 people at 7:40 p.m. There was only one unidon: sea urchin with salmon roe caveat left. One beef tataki. Of you want to try specials, go earlier to have a variety."}
{"text":"This place got me hooked no joke. If it is not because I am on a diet (and broke) I'll probably go there every single day until I try every single item on the menu. Their interior is super simple, yet cozy. The waitress is friendly, and helpful. The service is fast. They fully deserve their fives stars! :D  I got lucky actually because they offer uni don and toro tekka don on their daily special menu, the two bowls I wanted to try the most. As always, when I go to a japanese restaurant I always order their karaange, and this time is no exception. And lastly no matter how full I am, there is always room for dessert, especially when the dessert of the day is matcha creme brulee. ;) - Karaange: I love their karaange. Probably my favorite so far. The crust is thinner compared to the other karaange I've tried before, so it has light crisp. The meat is sooo juicy. It has a hint of spicy flavor, because there was an aftertaste of ginger, which makes it even more interesting to eat.  - Uni don: I tried the uni don at Otto, and I shall say Nozy is winning hands down. Their uni don includes sea urchin, salmon roe, and salmon tartar, which gives variety. The one I had at Otto was smaller in portion and only had sea urchin and salmon roe, and was only 2$ cheaper than Nozy. The sea urchin did not have that \"fishy\" taste at all. Since there are so many different texture in the bowl, it was more interesting to eat. - Toro tekka don: The sashimi tasted fresh, and the tuna was melting in your mouth. The rice was already seasonned, but did not overpower the taste of the fish itself. I'll say compared to the uni don, this is kinda dull to eat, but since I love tuna belly sashimi, this is not a big problem for me.  - Matcha creme brulee: Probably my least favorite part of the meal. The creme brulee did not had any taste of green tea at all. The sugar crust on top was a little too thin in my opinion.   GREAT PLACE! GONNA BRING MY FRIENDS FOR SURE! THIS WILL BECOME MY NEXT GO TO PLACE ?"}
{"text":"The restaurant serves amazing Toro and great juicy karaage. The rice used for the sashimi bowl improved and is now good."}
{"text":"Love the food here. It's a bit pricier but definitely worth it. I am lucky enough that they have uni don today(sea urchin). Everything from sea urchin to salmon to the rice are perfectly cooked and prepared. I also loved their miso soup and the salad. For desert, we had crème brûlée, it was ok but not as impressive as their don. My friend ordered the chef's choice that contains Japanese fried chicken which is also very tasty. The other friend ordered the kaisen don(assorted sashimi don) which was also amazing. In all, we all loved each of our dishes and we will definitely come back to try out more. You may need to make an reservation if you come on Saturday (they're closed on Sundays) since the restaurant is tiny. We are fortunate enough to sit at the bar as all other seats were reserved."}
{"text":"MUST EAT MUST TRY - a true fan girl of NOZY. Went back for my birthday dinner. The food is just amazing however some of the items are seasonal so don't expect the exact same meal if you go back twice!"}
{"text":"A Japanese place serving something other than sushi. Been here 5 times; addicted to salmon chirashi. Rice always cooked perfectly, attention to detail, high quality ingredients and food. Go and try it!!"}
{"text":"I was very surprised! Positively! From the outside, it's a rustic deco, it also looks like a dessert place, clean and neat, with the white wooden chairs. We reserved for two, the waitress was really nice, she explained the Japanese menu, teishoku style and the chefs special plates. We were inspired, and ordered: KARAAGE; fried chicken VEGETABLE PANCAKE; Vegetable pancake okonomiyaki style UNI IKURA DON (SEASONAL DISH); Sea urchin, salmon tartar and roe served over rice, with miso soup KAISEN DON; Assorted sashimi, sweet shrimp and quail egg served over rice With a refreshing Kirin beer Finally the food was to die for !!! I would definitively recommend it, and come again. It's definitively my favorite japanese restaurant in montreal."}
{"text":"This chance find has grown to be my preferred Japanese restaurant in Montreal: it is unpretentious, authentic, and most satisfying. It is named after the chef Nozomu Takeuchi's nickname.  Despite Nozy's unassuming facade, my frequent visits here have been without fail nothing short of exceptional. Every time, hospitable service was provided with affable ease. The simplicity of the dishes accentuates the strong points of Japanese cuisine: when fresh, ingredients need not be adulterated to excess. Hence, in my opinion, the piece de resistance of this restaurant is the succulent raw fish, be it salmon, otoro/maguro (tuna), or my personal favourite, uni (sea urchin).  For such a culinary delight, the price is more than reasonable. I wholeheartedly, recommend this place for lunch, brunch, and dinner. If they opened in the morning, I would even go for breakfast!"}
{"text":"Best Japanese restaurant in Montreal!!! A small cozy restaurant. We came here Thursday and arrived before 6pm, so it was pretty empty but we could choose where to sit. My friend was debating either to get uni don or Kaisen don, she chose uni don because daily special tends to be fresher?! I ordered unagi don And we made the right choice. This uni don, the sea urchin was the best one that I ever had it in Montreal.  Today is Saturday, and I'm want to go back right now...."}
{"text":"J'adore cet endroit! Très bon service, nourriture excellente, atmosphère relax. J'y suis allée pour la première fois, à l'heure du lunch j'y retournerai avec plaisirs!"}
{"text":"Reserve before coming here! Had to go back for a second time because they were fully booked when we got there one night.  Wanted the uni bowl but was told the season has passed. The waitress was super friendly and accommodating, she offered a special rice bowl for us with several different fishes. It was a combo with salad, soup and some Japanese pickles. The rice bowl was absolutely heaven like. The fish was fresh and the rice was al-dente. With the soy sauce and wasabi, it was a really fulfilling meal. The miso soup was made with shrimps, so it got an extra layer of taste and freshness.  We also shared an appetizer platter, you can tell it's made with love and dedication! It got fried chicken, beef carpaccio, sashimi, eggplant dip and kale salad. All were really good. The chicken was super tender, the kale salad was really special with sesame sauce and the eggplant dip! Where can I buy some to eat with chips while watching TV?!  The only reason was the sashimi bowl turned out to be $28, it's a bit expensive compared to the salmon bowl for only $16. We only found out the price when we got the bill. We wish we were informed the price before we ordered. Other than that, it was a perfect meal! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Very tasty little Japanese restaurant. Interesting menu and many sake options. Great to finally eat something other than sushi in a Japanese resto!"}
{"text":"I like this little Japanese gem in St-Henri. They don't serve sushi, but instead go for a more \"home cooked\" style of Japanese food. I'm a fan of their Karaage, Uni Don, Toro Don, and Sashimi overall."}
{"text":"Wow, what an experience!!! When we arrived the waitress came to explain the menu and she recommended the Toro Tekka Don.  Now in my head I'm hesitating because I don't like tuna but my friend really wanted to try the Bluefin red tuna. I ordered the Niku Daisuki and we shared.   Let me tell you this, I didn't like tuna sashimi cause I've never had real tuna!  This stuff was amazingly good. The pieces cut from the fish belly area were just melt in your mouth good. Half of the pieces were fattier and the other half leaner. I wish I could've just kept chewing it forever just to savor the piece of sashimi...but it \"melted\" so fast it was impossible to do!! :p  The ribs were also super tender and slathered with sauce... When meat melts in your mouth, it's a beautiful thing *sheds a tear*.  I liked how the shrimp had a light, crispy panko layer that wasn't soaked in oil...too bad there's only one!  Oh and wait, you have to try their pork karaage with spicy mayo! So juicy and tender and buttery with the mayo...too bad there were only 3 *tears of sadness*   We also had the appetizer for $15 that came with 15 pieces of sashimi. With Atlantic salmon, red snapper, yellow tail tuna and regular tuna. It was pretty good! And presentation was stellar!   The sides were ok: miso soup, not too salty; salad was ok; homemade pickles were nice but not sure which food it was supposed to go with.    Had an Asahi beer which is very light. Good to pair with delicate sushi.   The dessert is shaved ice with matcha green tea powder a scoop of green tea ice cream topped with a portion of ice cream sandwich, two Pocky sticks, sweetened red beans and some jelly.  We asked to have the ice cream on the side.  It's a nice little dessert, nothing crazy.   Overall it was a satisfying experience and very filling."}
{"text":"Went too late so not too many choice left! A small Japanese resto... A bit hot as a/c not very strong! Food is so delicious! Love their chirashi... Simple but so good! Hopefully can try their Uni don one day~"}
{"text":"My my... This place doesn't disappoint. I went there for lunch and they have their specials. I took their chef top 5 special of the day. I didn't get much seafood in it but it has enough variety to satisfied my palate.   The service is great. The waitress is present at all time and she volunteered to open my miso soup for me.... I wasn't trying to be a princess here, the miso heat suck the cover and the bowl together. The waitress kindly open it for me without us asking. One look, she came over to open it for us.   The price was 21 dollars with taxes and tips for the plate. I got the meals in less than 10-15 min top.   To end this wonderful experience, I will be back when I have more time and hopefully soon!"}
{"text":"Excellent service,  food,  and ambiance.  The karage and black cod are must haves. The sashimi is high quality. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Not a bad joint but I was quite disappointed with their chirashi. It usually comes with a wide variety of sashimi, seafood, vegetables on sushi rice but this salmon chisarahi, well, just salmon and jasmin rice. True, the menu did specify it was salmon chirashi but I believe you shouldn't use the term chirashi as it's known to be a bowl mix of fish, veggie and other ingredients ... chirashi stands for \"scattered\"!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is one of the few that I've been to that nails simplicity. Small menu, nothing fancy, just a focus on good food and good ambiance. The salmon chirashi dinner is a great choice, and if you're really hungry, the fried chicken is really, really good."}
{"text":"Can't say the good is bad but definitely not wow either.  A friend of mine went some time ago and had the unidon and loved it so I was hoping to try it. Unfortunately when I went,  it was no longer available.  Had a sashimi appetizer and honestly,  the fish wasn't that great. Also took some fried chicken and it lacked flavor.  As a main dish, I took the salmon chirashi and it tasted blend! There was some sauce in the rice but was tasteless. it consisted on salmon sashimi,  salmon tataki et tartare. There was only 3 reviews for this restaurant and all were 5*...I really don't get it!"}
{"text":"Best fresh sashimi I ever had in Montreal!!!!!!!!!!!! They serve very genuine Japanese food!  I ordered KAISEN DON, and sea urchin on the side.  A little bit expensive, but considering it is located in Montreal, I can accept that."}
{"text":"Simple no fuss Chirashi and donburi, real authentic Japanese food. Delicious and reasonable prices. One of my favourite in town."}
{"text":"Big crush for this place since moving to St Henri.  The food is fresh and simple yet incredibly tasty. Food Is prepared with love and it makes all the difference!  By the way, Best chicken karaage so far in Montreal!"}
{"text":"So delicious!!!!! I had the salmon bowl. It was so fresh and tasty. There was an amazing spicy sauce on it that I even asked for more of. My boyfriend got the burger steak.. Bad move! Stick to the fish there and it seems pretty fool proof. They change the menu each week and use seasonal fresh ingredients.  Simple decor, pretty good service. Came on a Saturday night and it was pretty full.  Overall I really recommend it!!!"}
{"text":"Small restaurant on Rue Notre-Dame, simple décor & nice service.   Had the special cinq plats du jour, very classic Japanese dishes served in cute small containers and all in a bamboo basket. The Takoyaki & Karaage were particularly tasty, and the chips with eggplant dip was special and delicious too, BUT I didn't like the dressing of the sashimi salad, the raw fish filets were not quite fresh, either.   It seems that they alter their menu according to the seasonal seafood supply, so I didn't get the urchin bowl which I really wanted, that was a little upsetting, besides that it was a pretty good experience!"}
{"text":"It's a cozy little place, then fish are fresh however I personally find it a bit lack of selection. Their night menu is also lack of hot dishes (most them are sashimi or tataki)."}
{"text":"I went here with a friend on a Wednesday. It was packed and we hadn't reserved but luckily there was space at the bar. I had the Bloody Caesar (sake, vodka, lime, cucumber) and the salmon chirashi (salmon 3 ways: sashimi, tartare, and tataki). It also comes with miso soup, a salade and pickled beets. It was very good but I wish there had been more salmon. There were three pieces of tataki and four pieces of sashimi. My friend had the miso cod which was the special of the day. She said it tasted good but didn't like that there were bones in the fish."}
{"text":"Amazing place. Love coming here because the menu is different Everytime. As someone who hates going through menus, love the chef special and it's always a good surprise :)"}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite spots, whether for dinner, lunch or weekend brunch. I love that each meal comes with a small side salad and miso soup. The quality of the food and service is always top notch, and the place in general offers great value (especially at lunch, when prices are about $2 cheaper per menu item than at dinner). I've tried and enjoyed the salmon chirashi bowl, the take kago, the sashimi lunch platter and the seasonal uni Don. The food has always been fresh, delicous, and beautifully presented. At lunch/brunch, prices start at $13 (for the Japanese curry dish) to $28-$32 for some of the seasonal specialities (uni don bowl, blue or yellow fin tuna bowl etc.) Dinner prices start at about $18 I think. There's a reasonably priced wine list for dinner as well (bottles starting at about $30-ish)."}
{"text":"One of my fav Japanese restaurants in Montreal, offering different surprises for me each time I pay a visit there! The owner changes the menu on a regular basis, so even the choices of dishes are not very varied, satisfaction is guaranteed no matter what you take, and if you go there after a while, you get to try a different set of gourmet! The three times that I go there, either me or my friend took the five choices of the chef, which offers a great variety of little dishes to try out, so if it is your first time there, definitely try it out! The plating is beautiful and it looks super good even before I taste it! My favorite is their sashimi bowl, which is so fresh and succulent, I cannot stop! Their salmon bowl is good but I think it's not as good as the other choices.  I highly recommend Nozy!"}
{"text":"Nozy is a nice and cozy place ;) where you can tell locals have called it home. Excellent service - the waitress knew her menu and her specials very well. The restaurant offers interesting lunch menus that come with the main dish, a miso soup, salad and a potato purée. Specials of the day also come with the same sides. I ordered the eel special; it was good, but nothing extraordinary. My friend ordered the tuna belly sashimi special. The sashimi was delicious. The only downside was that it was placed on the rice when it was still warm thereby cooking the raw fish a little bit. I would've given 5 stars if it wasn't for that :) For dessert we had the black forest cake. Smooth and fluffy. Probably one of the best I've had."}
{"text":"Amazing lunch menu !!! I highly recommend the sashimi is so fresh and delicious. The place is so simple and beautiful. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Recently moved to St-Henri and stumbled on this cute little Japanese restaurant. I love it when the menu is small and simple and Nozy is just that; fresh and good food. The chicken karaage is simply one of the best I had in Montreal. Pair the fried chicken with the pancakes and a salmon bowl."}
{"text":"great place loved it, the fish is very fresh it's from a japanese private import. big difference comparable to Park's quality. the bowls are very good, comes with a soup which is a plus not salty at all the miso soup. Service is ok, not very accommodating waitress but they were full."}
{"text":"One of the best toro I've tasted. In life.   In three words: Fresh Plump Fishmusthavebeenpamperedinlife  So sad I won't be back anytime soon (travelled from NYC)."}
{"text":"Don't pass this place up.   Doesn't seem like much from the street but the food is mind blowing."}
{"text":"Fantastic Japanese with super friendly service. The Take Kano box is a nice surprise."}
{"text":"Every dish is so photogenic here like food p*rn, except that nothing I tried here would give you any foodg*sm. It's a shame because the menu is authentic, the service is nice and the portion-price ratio is so satisfying! So why is it a 3 star? For example, almost EVERYTHING you don't \"physically\" see in the salmon chirashi dish is missing! Besides white rice + salmon, there's really not much going on. If you simply googled \"recipe for chirashi\" there's at least 1 c of rice vinegar, 2 tbsp of sesame seed, 1 tbsp. katsuo fumi furikake rice seasoning..., but the rice tastes plain and the salmon is not fresh enough to 'appreciate' zero seasoning. My boyfriend seems to be quite satisfied with the \"nutrition factor\" of this meal. Maybe it is a good quick lunch option if you want something healthy&fresh in the neighborhood."}
