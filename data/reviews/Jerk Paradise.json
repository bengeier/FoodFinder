{"text":"4.5 but rounding up to 5 stars for being a reliable and inexpensive take-out spot in a part of town that doesn't have a huge number of options   This little place offers really good deals on a variety of meals on the Gerrard end of Cabbagetown. Cabbagetown is a cute area but could use some more eateries and shops, so Jerk Paradise is a welcome addition at an excellent price point.  My favorites are the jerk chicken (a generous deal for the small at $6.50) and stew chicken where I usually go for the medium at $9. Chicken is tender and tasty, and the portions of rice are bigger than most - I was wondering how they got the creaminess in the rice and peas thinking they added butter. But they said their secret ingredient was coconut milk - so...healthy and delicious.  I've tried a few other items on their menu - the beef patties have a nice heat to it. The jerk chicken poutine was interesting - I'm not a big fan of cheese with my fries, but the pieces of chicken along with the jerk sauce in the fries was addictive if not the healthiest of meals. I've noticed the oxtail and fried chicken are popular among the other customers. They also have breakfast options when they open at 11am such as waffles and sandwiches.  The couple that run the place are super sweet and hardworking - I cannot believe they are open 7 days a week and always greet everyone with a smile on their face.  If you're in that part of town - highly recommended for an inexpensive, filling and delicious meal."}
{"text":"The absolute best for jerk chicken in this city! Get delivery from here almost every week and all items are always fresh and yummy! The chicken platter, the waffles, the salad, the poutine and the burgers are all great options!"}
{"text":"staff is ver ynice, place looks ok, food is ok, but nothing more... i guess i expected more, tastier, bigger portions of meat rather than rice, juicier food."}
{"text":"Three stars because everything here was decent and okay.  Nothing special, no extra large portion, no OMG... just okay   I decided to try this place after walking past a few times and what was the enticing piece was: Jerk Chicken Poutine.  The only other place I've had this was at the Skydome: Poutine plus Jerk Chicken from the Marketplace.  That is exactly what I got, a small jerk chicken poutine ($5.95) as well as a small fried chicken ($6.50) which was a thigh and a drumstick.    The poutine was good and what made it good was lots of curds and enough gravy to actually melt the curds!  The jerk chicken was good with a kick to it but with all the gravy you can't really tell.  The friend chicken was good, could use a bit more salt (and I'm not one to promote more salt ) and it comes with a Thai-like chilli sauce.  The place itself is meant for walk-in and take out or a quick bite at their counter.  The two ladies are nice, not big talkers but very friendly.  Cheap and good food--great for the once in awhile since it is heavy."}
