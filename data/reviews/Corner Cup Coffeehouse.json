{"text":"Espresso drinks: A+ Atmosphere: A+ Service/Friendliness: A+  So glad to have a place like this in our neighborhood. I think a lot of people are craving an alternative to Starbucks, and Corner Cup nailed it. The other two local independent coffee shops miss on something big: Mocha Joe's atmosphere is flat out depressing, and Tree City in Kent has never served me a drink I've enjoyed."}
{"text":"Very friendly service.  The Italian style cappuccino was very good.  It's a nice little spot to sit and relax."}
{"text":"When I first go into a new place, I observe the employees and the service. And the owner (Heather, I believe) was amazing!  She was extremely friendly and helpful. We ended up hi-fiving at the end hahaha. She answered my 1000 questions and dealt with my indecisiveness like a pro. Although this a little hike from where we live I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I only ever drink drip coffee, so I can't speak to all the fancy drinks. But the atmosphere is spot on. The owner is awesome, and the shop is one you should hang out at. That's all!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a cup of coffee and don't want the usual Starbucks or Dunkin Donuts in the stow area, this is your place! I strongly recommend the Corner Cup Mocha. The inside of the coffee shop is nicely decorated, and has a lot of room to sit. If you are looking to come relax and study this is a great place to do so."}
{"text":"Unbelievable place!! I can't recommend it enough. From the super attentive owner and staff, to the consistently great drinks...you can't go wrong! Love the decor, AND they have a great little room for private meetings! Love that Corner Cup!!"}
{"text":"Had a pleasant cup of coffee here. It's a cheery, comfortable place where you can chat with a friend or write your next best seller. They have free WiFi, all kinds and flavors of coffee, espresso, cappuccino, etc, and a modest assortment of scones and muffins. Parking is accessible and it's a nice neighborhood spot."}
{"text":"The is just a good place to get a cup of very good coffee.  Heather, the owner, is working to make it a success, and I hope and think she is succeeding and will continue to be successful.  She has a pleasant staff and a demonstrated customer orientation.  It's out of my way, but so what?  It is well worth the drive.  Wish I could figure out a use for the meeting room she has set aside...great idea!  Only problem:  parking can be a bit limited, but that's the price of success, right?    Go. Enjoy the coffee.  And buy a t-shirt while you're there. tell 'em Joe sent ya."}
{"text":"Was greeted by owner, Heather. Very friendly and personal, cozy environment. Coffee was on point, and served w a smile. Really nice new local place. Come out to support!"}
{"text":"Great coffee.  Great atmosphere.  Would recommend this to anyone who enjoys coffee.  Can sometimes be crowded, but that is only a testament to the success and superior product that they serve.  I even started getting their coffee and teas to take to make at work.  Keep up the great work."}
{"text":"I love Corner Cup Coffehouse. Corner cup was much needed in Stow, Stow still needs a lot more local food/drink businesses, but this is a great step in the right direction. The location is great and the atmosphere is cozy, I love the fireplace. Every coffee drink I have ordered is made perfect, salted caramel cappuccino has been the best yet! There food selection is small, delicious scones and muffins, and a couple breakfast sandwiches. I would love if they had a little more, like bagels, but can't complain. They also have a room in the back that you can reserve and I have done so for business or just to get some work done. Great place, it's one of Stow's few gems!"}
{"text":"Quite expensive but coffee is definitely delicious I highly recommend for people who are introverted and want to be more social and want a fun comfortable experience"}
{"text":"I've been here on a few occasions to meet a friend for coffee and we've never been disappointed. The last time was around Valentine's Day and I was tickled to see that they had a red velvet mocha. So. Heavenly. And so red! Cute little place with rustic modern decor and an overall good coffee shop vibe. Never tried any of the pastries but can't say I haven't been tempted..."}
{"text":"Love this place! Comfortable environment, delicious coffee (corner cup mocha is my favorite) and friendly staff. Great for socializing and studying or if you'd just like to grab a quick cup of fresh coffee. Heather, the owner, is so sweet and has really gone the extra mile to bring Stow it's very own personalized/local coffee joint."}
{"text":"I'm beyond in love with this coffee house. It's such a hidden treasure, I was always a big Starbucks person. There is a reason I say \"was\" ......anything Starbucks can do, corner cup can do better! With it's cozy atmosphere  and soft music, It has become my favorite meeting place. I have insisted on showing this quaint little coffee shop to many friends and they instantly become regulars. The staff is always friendly and willing to make any drink the way you want it. The best espresso I have ever tasted; everything about this place is authentic and top quality! It's a great local owned small business and the owner Heather is the most charming, engaging person. I rarely have come  in when she is not behind the counter welcoming customers with a kind smile and greeting her loyal regulars by name. As much as I love small businesses I must say,  I wish there was a corner cup  on every corner!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"A cute, little local coffee shop. Decent prices and friendly staff. One of the only places around the Kent/Stow area that serves Green Tea Matcha,  especially as a frozen drink~delicious!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best coffee for miles! Plus the owner and all of the baristas are friendly and welcoming every time I visit.  I stop for a mocha here at least twice a week.  It is my favorite place in Stow; only the library can compete for my attention. It has a great atmosphere and is a wonderful addition to Stow."}
{"text":"Good coffee and nice place to read emails. My only gripe is they had tiny selection of munchies. A couple muffins, cupcakes, and cookies. I almost bought some cookies until i found out they want $1 for each. If they were large and gourmet I might have indulged in one. They look like the garden variety break and bake kind. I can get 3 for $1 at subway and the subway versions are much larger. I will return for again for the coffee."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite local coffee shop for hanging out. The coffee is great. The environment is even better. I'm a graduate student who always likes having a place to do school work other than the library.  It's nice to see how many regulars come in and know one another It is a great vibe."}
{"text":"I love this place!!  Amazing coffee, cute decor, cozy place to hang and --- an incredible owner Heather!  I could spend hours here and love chatting with the baristas. Megan recommended a flavorful delicious New Orleans cold brew for my first visit.  It got me hooked - I'll be back!!"}
{"text":"Location is a little tricky, I drove past twice. It is next door to a movie rental store, on corner.  Absolutely fabulous selection of beverages. I don't think anyone would be able to stop by and not find something that would appeal to them.  Cozy atmosphere, very clean and friendly. Met up with a girlfriend for coffee, we ended up chatting for three hours. Worth the stop for sure."}
{"text":"This is such a cozy coffee shop with great space to sit and work / study or even host a small business meeting.  The lattes and coffee are phenomenal they always take great care in making your drink perfectly."}
{"text":"Great, quick, moderately priced cup of coffee in a cozy environment. Great place to chat or work quietly and definitely my new favorite place to get away with my caffeine fix! Baristas are always friendly--none of that grump that can be so off-putting before you're caffeinated. I'll definitely be frequenting here."}
{"text":"Cute place, a nice local addition to the Stow area. I first heard of Coffee Cup from friends & on social media; it's been getting a lot of buzz in the community, which I gather is because the owner is a well-connected local who has been able to drum up support (& customers!) I was impressed with all the word-of-mouth I heard about this place, which seems unusual for 2015. (Re: another reviewer's insinuation that this is all \"drummed up,\" I say: I honestly just heard about it from friends. Lots of them. Somebody's doing a good job somewhere!)  The menu isn't necessarily anything to write home about - you're not going to find the best coffee or pastries of your life here - but everything seems to be done fairly well, & I second a previous reviewer's support for the vanilla latte, which is sweet but not overly so. My mom likes their Italian sodas as an alternative to caffeine. prices are standard & competitive with other local coffeeshops.  The decor is on its way, but could be, in my opinion, a little bit more done-up. It's cute but still feels a bit like the place is located in a strip mall (which it is, but wouldn't we all like to forget?) Perhaps this will come in time. For now, I'm sure they're focused on getting the place off the ground! There's ample seating, though not as many electrical outlets as I'd like, & everything's got a cozy local feel. Staff is friendly & seems legitimately happy to be serving their customers.  In other words: definitely worth checking out. Welcome to the area, Corner Cup!"}
{"text":"Great coffee, friendly staff, I will be revisiting. I like the outside seating area."}
{"text":"Awesome place Employees know their jobs and are Very pleasant  Great place for coffee Much better than SB plus it's \"local\" Thank you"}
{"text":"Not my favorite place, the staff lightly mocked the brand of my clothes, and then I heard them mocking the woman in line behind me for what she was wearing too. While it was probably a joke, it really wasn't what I expected as an experience and left a sour taste in my mouth. I have friends who play music here and have heard others enjoy it a lot; maybe I just had a bad visit."}
{"text":"A very cool, relaxed vibe! The owner's exuberant personality is contagious among the other employees. In addition to good coffee and tasty food, the Corner Cup is supportive of local musicians and visual artists. I've also used their conference rooms for business meetings."}
{"text":"I very rarely update my reviews on Yelp, but this business deserves an update. After watching this place grow over the past several months I want to upgrade them to a five star coffeehouse. They've made a lot of improvements, such as:  - A new food menu that includes prices - A cool looking sliding door for their public conference room - An outdoor patio with umbrella tables - Unique summer drinks (try their Reese's Pieces frozen drink)  I've visited well over a hundred different coffeehouses in my lifetime and there's no question in my mind that this is a five star establishment. The owner, Heather, is constantly working to make her business the best is can be. Outside of the previously mentioned improvements, Corner Cup has also been handing out 'coffee cash' as a reward to their customers for their business. It's also rumored that they'll soon be hosting an 'open mic night' which should draw in a fun crowd.   Come check this place out!"}
