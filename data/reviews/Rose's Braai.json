{"text":"The coffee shop down the hall recommended I go here, and I'm so glad they did. Just friggin' delicious.  They only have like eight items on the menu, which I love.   The Portuguese chicken is PHENOMENAL. The grilled shrimp had some kind of honey mustard drizzle across the top, which was incredible.  I love charred meat - hate when it is baked or tooooo juicy? This place cooks everything perfectly. Not to mention it is a family business, a passion project of the two guys who opened it, and they're the nicest."}
{"text":"Happened to see this place when we were in The Arcade, it's on the lower level near the food court. Braai is a southern African grilled meat tradition and Rose's serves a selection of grilled meats as well as sadza and greens as sides (along with things like potato salad). I had the South African Beef Stew which is a sauce, grilled steak, a side of sadza (or rice), and greens, it was tasty and filling. My wife had the grilled boerewors, which is a sausage. I tried a little of the sausage which was savory with a hint of spicy sweetness. There's also Portuguese grilled chicken on the menu which was available both mild and spicy. The set up is pretty laid back, paper plates and plastic utensils, but the staff are warm and friendly and were happy to explain the menu. Make sure you are not in a big hurry, it takes time to grill things. Several people came in while we were there and it seemed like they were able to handle the traffic, but everything that required grilling, well it required grilling from scratch. Braai is supposed to be a social occasion, so chill out and bring some friends. They are currently only open for lunch (10-3)."}
{"text":"The wings are really good , we got the spiciest ones and they were delicious! Also the fries were good.  I'd come back for the wings"}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful place for  a lunch that is not just another sandwich.  Chicken, ribs and wings all have a unique flavor, and the fish is now a Friday staple for me.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"We have a sad dearth of African restaurants of any kind in Cleveland, so I was excited to see this new place, and even more excited when I tried it. Very friendly proprietors who care about the food and extremely tasty dishes. I've spoken with a South African and a Zimbabwean who've tried the place, and they both said it was completely authentic and delicious. I'm looking forward to trying more dishes and hoping they can survive in the largely empty Arcade food court."}
{"text":"Stopped by Rose's Braai yesterday to see what they offer. I immediately noticed fish n chips on their menu and ordered it with a bottle of water. I paid and grabbed a bottle of water out of the fridge and it was frozen, so I grabbed a different one. About five minutes later, my fish and chips were hot and ready with tartar sauce.  I let it cool off and then I tasted a french fry, which was very good. So far, these fries are rated at #2 on my list of downtown french fries. Winking Lizard holds the top spot there. The fries were large, not too crunchy, and tasted delicious. The tartar sauce that I dipped them in had a bit of spice in it as did the breading on the fish. The fish was also delicious. The breading was perfect, and not too crispy. The white fish had a great flavor and three pieces of fish was just the right quantity. My lunch was $9. I will be back with friends."}
{"text":"OMG!  Their chicken is so delicious and worth the wait. Now my entire office smells like a Brazilian restaurant. I ordered half a chicken and fries to go with mild spice. I highly recommend this place. But, they really need to address their ventilation issues."}
{"text":"This place is good. I'm staying in the Hyatt Regency at The Arcade in downtown Cleveland and went down today to have some lunch. The chicken was great... cooked just right, flavorful. The side I had, the potato salad, was okay, not really a fan of it. But the chicken... man! Good stuff! And affordable. There were only two people working when I went in so I had to wait a bit to get my food. But this is a good place and I definitely recommend stopping in and checking it out."}
{"text":"Braai is an Afrikaans word that roughly translates to \"barbecue,\" but it encompasses the whole culture of the practice (a social event with friends, lingering over good food and conversation with some good beer and wine, specific foods that are always present, etc.), not just the food itself--perhaps the closest thing in American English would be the phrase \"backyard barbecue.\"  When I saw the word braai on the door, I instantly knew this was authentic and that I had to stop in, even though I had intended to go elsewhere for lunch.  Peri-peri chicken is so moist and flavorful. Delish. Spicy is actually not very spicy, so order spicy even if you're not a capsaicin-head. (If you like REALLY spicy, you may be disappointed and might want to ask if they have anything hotter.)  Secret weapon on the menu is the boerewors roll. It's a homemade sausage in a hot dog bun. Hard to describe for Americans, but think of something in the size/shape of a hefty bratwurst but with a much softer, crumblier texture (sort of like a Turkish Adana kebab or something) and a soft, meaty flavor (not salty or spicy or anything). Literally just like the boerewors I had in my friend's back yard in Cape Town. Here's the kicker: it's $3.95 AND comes with a huge glut of steak fries. Best deal in Ohio.  GO."}
{"text":"Had a fantastic meal here of chicken quesadilla fries Mac and cheese and fish and chips. Great friendly service also. Very good rich flavors. Definitely didn't know what to expect - we highly recommend giving it a try. Thanks guys!"}
