{"text":"I'm not a burger-fries-shake kind of person, however, Islands have delicious burgers and thick shakes.  I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"Tried for the first time tonight with my family who were celebrating my sons 7th birthday.  The food was excellent and the service was even better.  Our server Scot was extremely nice and made my son's birthday extra special with a dessert at the end.  Great place to eat!!"}
{"text":"Came here on a friday night, when it should be packed- and it was busy, but we didn't have to wait.  The parking lot situation can be a little strange here as there is minimal parking at the front of the restaurants, but plenty in behind.  Anyway, we were jones-ing for burgers, and this is where we decided on.

The place is nice.  Has an island theme, of course, and plenty of booths.  Our waitress took a while, but we weren't in a rush so no big deal- but could have been better, and quicker.  We got a chicken burger with guac, cheese, bacon, etc. and the pepercrusted burger- both with wheat bun.  Props that they give you the choice of white or wheat.  Both were about $10 each, tasty, and definitely hit the spot.

Overall, decent enough.  Will probably try LBS in the RedRock or hit up Kilroys the next burger excursion though."}
{"text":"Worst Nachos I've ever had. No flavor what so ever. Onion rings and burgers ok. However, the service was friendly and our server attentive. The place was clean and spacious, which is a plus in my book."}
{"text":"Awesome lunch! Clean envionment. Well ran establishment. Our waitress, Elizabeth, did a great job!"}
{"text":"Islands continues the same Hawaiian theme which has worked for many years.  The menu is the same with minor changes.  Best fries of any burger joint in town and are always fresh and served in large portions.  The food is consistently good and the services always quick and friendly.  Great place to relax in the bar and enjoy a margarita and wings.   The average ticket price for two is around $30 with soft drinks plus tip!  You will not leave hungry nor have room for dessert."}
{"text":"I LOVE Islands! the service is always amazing and their tortilla soup is my all time favorite kind of soup! I go out of my way to stop by Islands to get their soup! I love this place!!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite Desert Ridge restaurants. No, it's not fine dining but it's pretty good food.

The restaurant is beachy but not overly done.  There are enough decorations to set the mood of the theme. The service is outstanding.  Everyone has a smile on their face and they are eager to please.  

The food is good.  They have an extensive menu (sandwiches, salads, tacos, etc.) but the main event for me at this restaurant is the burger. Your choice - beef, turkey or veggie served on a white or whole wheat bun or as a wrap.

Good service, good food, reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Islands is a good place to eat and just relax with friends.  the service is very good and I usually get the chicken rice bowl or the chicken fingers when I go to Islands"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, excellent food, wonderful, friendly, and hardworking staff and management. Will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"My daughter was craving Islands restaurant yesterday so we drove to Desert Ridge.  The manager was extremely nice and accommodating.  He actually went out of his way to be kind when he learned of my daughters pregnancy and craving.  Both the burger and chicken sandwich were terrific!"}
{"text":"This was my first time at Islands - the food was really good, I ordered their current promotion Heat burger. It was awesome!!! It was spicy but not the point where you can't handle it. (I'm Latin) The meat was very good quality and the bread was very soft. Over all it tasted like a home made burger and not fast food quality. The fries were awesome too, they were very soft and had a very good flavor. I will be going back despite the fact that the waitress was not very friendly. She didn't smile not even ONCE. The hostess was very nice though :)"}
{"text":"We ate lunch here today. I got a simple soup and salad and it filled me up. Good food. For all the antiques they have hanging, there was no dust anywhere. Super nice to see."}
{"text":"Islands sells itself short marketing itself as a burger bar. They have a large menu that can please a variety of tastes. The cocktails were delicious if a bit expensive. Try they Asian salad."}
{"text":"Love it! Always enjoyed Islands in California! Very happy they had one in Arizona!!! Baja chicken tacos with the beans and a basket of fries to share!! Amazing!"}
{"text":"For a place that is supposed to specialize in burgers they are lacking. I have been there twice and had bad service both times. Unattentive servers who forget to bring things in a timely manner. I asked for extra mustard and didn't receive it till my burger was half gone. My friend ordered a salad and asked for it to be brougt out before her meal. It came after. It is cool how the french fries are unlimited."}
{"text":"Service was okay but the hamburgers were so good, very juicy and flavor was nice and strong. Everything was very Excellent. I really liked the onion rings were nice and sweet. Food was amazing!"}
{"text":"So glad my most frequented restaurant is also in Arizona! I Needed a Hula & you were there for me! So. Cal. Islands Girl!"}

{"text":"We went to Islands after leaving Claim Jumper, located in the same parking lot. Islands was busier, however they got us seated served and order taken very quickly. Service and food was good!"}
{"text":"We just had dinner at this location and was very happy with the food and service. Meggan was great and very attentive, thanks for the great service."}
{"text":"Always great food and service but today was EXCEPTIONAL!  Any parent with a child who leaves their retainer somewhere knows the financial cost and hassle involved...Islands staff not only saw it was left but saved it for us to pick up later in the day.  We eat there several times a month and now can say not only the food but the whole team is awesome!  Thank you!"}
{"text":"The only place I've been who does grilled pineapple on a burger right *shrugs Good place to take the kids to eat too!"}
{"text":"Always Great food at a Great Value...
Friendly atmosphere..
We usually sit in the bar and Mike and Tracy are Fabulous!"}
{"text":"This place is disgusting. I ordered take out for my wife and I. I had a burger with bacon and thousand island dressing and a side of onion rings. First, it was drippy from watered down thousand islands dressing and the burger tasted like grounded up dead cow, no flavor on a bun. The dead cow was flavorless. On the high side, the bacon and onion rings were delicious. Next time I will go to In and Out or Smash Burger"}
{"text":"It's been sometime since I have been to an island burger restaurant, there use to be one in Tempe but went out, last time I saw one was SAN Diego, now one is near my house in Vegas. I had the big wave burger, tasty as I remember. But the fries were hard and old, too bad could have been 3.5 stars maybe 4. Service was friendly and fast. I'll come back, but get the FF thing worked out, that is the easy part."}
{"text":"Onion Rings battered in pea gravel.  Yech!
White Hamburger Bun a sugary mess.  
It left that sweet/sour slime on the teeth for hours.

Nice waitstaff, but astounded I wanted silverware to cut the
onions rings with.  It seemed it was against policy!

Never again."}
{"text":"We came back to make sure the first time wasn't a fluke.  We received the same amazing service and food with George making it that way again...but Kenny the manager remembered my daughter poured salt thinking it was Parmesan and he brought out a cup of it for her...Above and beyond.



May 22...George was our server and he was polite and prompt and when my 4 year old daughter thought the salt was Parmesan and covered her kids pasta with it...George with any reservation said he would take care of it and got us a new one at no charge even know it was out fault.
My family has been going to the Island for a long time and always enjoyed the meal, but since then updated there food it is now amazing.
They have a new softer bun, and the cheeses frys now have a cheddar jack cheese which are incredible.
My wife had some chicken tacos and she ate everyone and didn't need to bring any home.
So a huge shout out to George who has his LPN and working on his RN."}
{"text":"Just an okay place for lunch. Everyone but me had a burger. No comments whatsoever on the burgers--no \"yeah that's good\" no \"this is bad.\" So in my book, that means just so-so. And with anything that's \"so-so\", I'd rather either eat at home and save money or eat someplace so-so-so much better. I had the rotisserie chicken which was overcooked and not that tasty anyway. Very plain, came with a side salad. 

But, the place was inexpensive, everything on the menu was less than $10."}
{"text":"My last trip on Monday the 14th was not very good.  I sat in the bar and just wanted to grab a quick burger and beer.  The bar was pretty empty, even though Monday Night Football was on.  I sat down and after a few minutes the bartender came over and I ordered a Fat Tire.  He tells me that they don't have Fat Tire but they have some other beer and that it tastes JUST LIKE Fat Tire.  I passed on his recommendation and went with a Kilt Lifter - he seemed pissed that I didn't go with his recommendation.  

I ordered a burger and he said \"you want it cooked medium right?\"  Typically I would say thats a little presumptuous but hey its Islands not Morton's.  The burger came out and was maybe mid-rare, closer to rare and was very greasy.  The bartender asked about 10 seconds after he delivered the food if \"Everything looks OK\".  I said sure it does and he never stopped back to refill my beer, ask if I wanted a water, or ask how the burger was.  He was busy talking to his girlfriend who was also working.  

I ate about 1/2 of the burger and asked for the check.  The bartender brought the check and didn't say a word, or ask why I only at about 1/2 of the burger.  Overall a very disappointing experience."}
{"text":"Love love love their burgers. It's our patent burger + movie stop. The servers are very nice, and they have the beachy ambience. Their burgers are a must try."}
{"text":"We drove a good 30 minutes , but it was well worth the drive ! We're from California so we know about the place . Absolutely the best spot to get a delicious burger ! I recommend the Hawaiian . Great service and we will definitely be coming back !"}
{"text":"I have been to this location many times and never once have had a bad experience.  The servers are always in a good mood, very attentive and caring towards customer needs.

Drinks are always quick coming to the table and food never takes more than 10 minutes (depending on what you order, I guess)

Burgers are the BEST I have had at any restaurant.  Especially now that they offer a veggie or turkey patty for those watching their weight.  LOVE IT!"}
{"text":"I had a fantastic burger here the other night, place was busy but service was still good!  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Love their burgers. Have not tried anything else except onion rings and fries, but this is my 'THE' place for burgers."}
{"text":"The burgers are ok, but pricey. $14.00 for one meat patty is a little much. I ordered a salad, it was horrible. Every piece of lettuce was brown, when
I told the waiter he told me that the manager will be over to talk to me. After everybody else was done with their meal the manager finally came over and asked if the lettuce was brown on the burgers, I spoke up and said no not the burgers, it was my salad. Obviously, my plate was the only one not touched but she couldnt pick that up by looking I guess. She said well thats impossible and walked away! They had the nerve to still charge $12.75 for a salad that was brown and I didn't touch. I definitely will not be back. The manager they had on that night, should go back to McDonalds with her customer service skills!"}
{"text":"There are no Islands in Tucson...

And that's neither a good thing nor bad thing.  In other words, I traveled all the way from Tucson to Northern Phoenix to eat an all right burger.  Well, that's not true.  My friend and I traveled there to watch Avatar on the IMAX screen at Desert Ridge.  

To reiterate, the burgers at Islands are \"fine\" in the mildest possible term.  The ground beef was of decent to good quality, and therefore the taste was of average to good caliber.  It was the fixings that sort of dragged down the burger in the taste department.  I ordered the Kilauea, which is a jalapeno & black pepper crusted burger with pepper jack cheese, chipotle aioli, lettuce,
tomato and Island Reds.  I'm not a cheese fan, so I opted to forgo the pepper jack.  I'm not sure if that would've saved the burger.  The seasoning lacked any pronounced or distinguished flavor.  Sadly, the end result was a rather bland burger.  

Have mercy, the fries, on the other hand, were probably the best thing on my plate.  The fries at Islands were good and fresh, just like me with the ladies after a few drinks.  With all due respect to a review who said that the fries \"tasted a lot like In-N-Out's,\" I disagree.  In-N-Out fries are of the thin-cut variety, while Island's are more of a traditional style.  What I appreciated the most about the fries were that they were crispy and fresh.  

The service was fairly fast, efficient and friendly, especially considering this a California-based chain.  I hate to wait for refills on my drinks, and our server was always on the spot just prior to hitting bottom as to satiate our impending thirst.  By the way, if you order a Cherry Coke here, it comes with an actual maraschino cherry.  Well, the first one does at least.  The second and third ones lacked any cherry.  I guess once you pop that first cherry, you really don't get any more.  

On that note, I would consider paying Island's a visit again, but it's not high on my list.  There are so many more cherries out there."}
{"text":"Burger restaurant with a somewhat campy surfer vibe.  Food is solid."}
{"text":"Went here last night, arrived ~9:45pm and stood at the front door podium, no one in sight. A young woman walked towards us, but instead of even saying hello, she picked up the phone, dialed a number, and began talking to someone (from her side of the conversation, we assumed she was off the clock and was checking on her ride). Once she was done, she sat us in a booth, quickly told us their drink and meal special, and said our waiter would be right over. From the way she was speaking, it seemed like she was either nervous or in a huge hurry to go home. 

So we looked at the menu (they were closing at 10:30, so we wanted to be able to hurry and order because we didn't want to keep anyone there after closing), but no one ever came to our table. After 10 minutes we decided to go somewhere else, which is too bad because their burgers looked pretty tasty."}
{"text":"This is a one time visit review so I understand it's limited in its perspective. The burger I had was not great and it leaves me confused to what people think are good burgers. Fries looked like the fryer oil was ready to be changed. Atmosphere in the evening was dreary and lighting was poor. Very dark in the bathrooms and depressing in the dining area. Overall not impressed for what people have reviewed as a 4 star out of 5."}
{"text":"My bartender Amanda is so kind and she makes the best Mojitos , she is very nice and friendly ,I'll defently recommend everyone to come and ask for her on the bar ...she is very funny girl ... Good luck Amanda I'll see you next week for sure ...!!! The host was very nice as well ... Great atmosphere"}
{"text":"Whoever gives this restaurant under 5 stars is nuts! ;-)  We drove from Maricopa/Gilbert to go to Islands at Desert Ridge and had the pleasure of having Jake as our server.  He was attentive, professional and friendly.  Our food, as usual, was delicious.  Only thing that would be better is if there was an Islands closer to us and if Jake and the Manager there ran the new place!!  They were awesome!"}
{"text":"It saddens me that Las Vegas only has one, having lived in LA for so long I fell in love with this place!!!

Awesome service, great big portion, and for everything you are getting the prices are more then fair!  

I HIGHLY RECOMMEND the Hawaiian Burger huge Burger teriyaki sauce a huge slice of pineapple and the rest is all American..  DELICIOUS easily one of my favorite places to eat!"}
{"text":"Everyone is nice, the bar tenders thoroughly explain the menu offerings and make you feel welcome. Fast and friendly service every time my wife and I eat here. The tortilla soup rocks!"}
{"text":"May be a \"Fine Burger\" place, but I had the Fish Tacos. I didn't even notice a burger on any of the tables. But I wasn't paying that much attention. https://www.islandsrestaurants.com/img/top/menu.png

Service was spot on!! Right on top of it.

The Tacos (qnty.3) were fine. A bit oily. One of the folks I was with commented \"not as tasty as I remember\". It was what I believe was a just a piece of Cod. They were worthy.

 \"Curb Side\" Take-Out orders available (order online). Designated parking spots around back for your \"Curb Side\"orders. Which I don't know about how well the fish tacos might handle that.

Genuine simulated Bamboo and Palm details. Not a big room, seats maybe 100 max. Sort of an enclosed Bar straight in as you enter. I somehow ended parking in the \"back\" (next to the take-out spots) walked in the door I saw. Ends up a rather adventurous walk to get to my party who were seated inside of the Bar space. Picture a square inside of a square type Maze cluttered like Gilligan's Island and you entered the wrong way.

I'd go back. But not sure I'd shout out \"lets go to Island's\" if in a group looking for a place to eat. Now if I was staying at Red Rock Casino Hotel and I wanted to leave the grounds, Island's is right across the street.

The staff was genuine and friendly. Didn't miss a beat!

{"text":"This is definitely a go to date night for me And my bf. We absolutely love the beachy/surfy/laidback enviornment! The server we love is named eugine I beleive. Hes very kind! I'm a picky eater and love substituting things. I usually get the \"Rincon burger\" which they took off the menu and substitute for Turkey. He had no idea what it was but was willing to go ask someone if I could still order it,  and he also reccomended other new options! He handled my pickiness very well, and genuinely cared about serving us and making us happy! I also appreciate that he treated my bf well, (guy waiters can tend to talk to the women more) but he almost acted as of they were friends! I love great customer service! We are always there because the food is great, but we def found our new favorite waiter!  I'd recommend this place to everybody!"}
{"text":"Good location and I've never had to wait for a table.  For me, the Big Wave is the perfect burger.  Nothing fancy just a lot of great flavor.  Excellent chips and guacamole.  Ranchero beans are also tasty."}

Good service at the bar tho. Shannon was great.
I've ate here before and good service and good but you can tell some/most of the stuff is Sysco food."}

Our server greeted us immediatly, got out drinks immediatly, and gave us the perfect amount of time to look over our menus. My boyfriend got a chocolate shake - mmmmm I should have got one- Delicious. Side Ceasar salad to start - nice and fresh and crisp lettuce - always a plus. We got a Burger and a chicken lettuce wrap for lunch. His burger was cooked to perfection and my chicken lettuce wrap was very tasty. And ofcourse their french fries are awesome aswell . Got our bill- very inexpensive. Great atmosphere, Great food, Great service!! No complaints"}

{"text":"Have visited this restaurant twice now.  The burgers are really good and the fish tacos the best in the areas.  One person in my party had the Cobb Salad which was somewhat disappointing.  Oregano in a salad?  No, it doesn't quite work out very well. However, burgers and fish tacos to scream for.  

Very good service and atmosphere.

Will probably return but not for the Cobb Salad."}

To top it all off 5 out of the 7 of us that went to eat there now have food poisoning. Including a 2 year old and a 5 year old, not ok. We had a variety of items from the menu so it was not any one item. 
 Working in the service industry i understand things can happen, but this is totally preventable and shouldve been. I will never go back."}

Additional edit: hahaha the review I left didn't have a specific date mentioned and yet the representative stated \"I have not heard of any issues on that date\" what date?!?! Reviews don't have to be left the day we eat there. So thnks for ur generic automated message...but u can keep it to yourself and your food too! Gross!!! There are tons of amazing places all around your restaurant! I suggest that ANYONE who is on the fence and can't decide...eat anywhere other than here!"}
{"text":"I hate rating a restaurant three stars.  It feels like such a cop out.  It's like when you ask a teenager, \"How was your day?\" and get the standard \"Ok.\" No originality at all.

However, I just went there a few days ago with my co-workers, and I really can't recommend the place highly.  They have a decent lunch special - $7.99 for about 5 different meals, which included the CA FLyer (grilled chicken sandwich with BBQ) and fries, which was what I ordered.  The chicken was great, huge chicken breast, with a good flavor. However, the fries were hard and cold.  I had to stop after a few because I was worried about breaking off a tooth.  

Well, the dog is whining to go out, so I'll review.  Fries: 1/5. Chicken 4/5. Prices: 3/5. Service 3/5. Average: 3/5."}
{"text":"Islands is a great place to go if you are in the mood for a burger and don't want to spend a lot of money. The service at this location is very good and the food is delicious! The food also comes out very quick and I really like how the servers at this place are on top of things. The little things like bringing extra drinks when they see you're getting low, and making sure that everything is satisfactory for you really shows that they care for the customer. I really enjoy getting the Kilauea which is a jalapeno and black pepper encrusted burger with pepper jack cheese and chipotle aioli, it is so tasty! If you're not in the mood for a burger, they also have salads, sandwiches, tacos, etc.. I also really enjoy the fries at this place, and they also have some really good desserts that are fairly large in portion. I remember after I ate my burger and fries I decided to ordered the Chocolate Lava for dessert which is a chocolate brownie topped with vanilla ice cream, whipped cream, cherries, almonds and chocolate syrup, a fairly simple but delicious dessert. I thought the dessert would be around the size of my fist like some other restaurants do, but it was much larger which I think is awesome."}
{"text":"Burger was surprisingly big, and definitely fresh and tasty. I wasn't a fan of the fries but the rest of the family loved them and ate mine too so probably it was just me. Drinks were refreshed quickly and food came out fast. Overall, I'd go back."}

{"text":"Great burgers!  I mean, they're very tasty and very indulgent, but they are also hewge.  Love the fries too, but only get one order per table or you WILL be taking them home.  Geez, how big was that potato?

Need to work on the takeout, gang.  I keep trying, and they keep getting it wrong.  I love the food so I keep coming back, but let's do something with the pickup service ok?"}
{"text":"Not a fan.. I've been here 3 times. Every time my burgers have been soggy. It's basically all toppings, a bun and a thin piece of meat. 

The service is great and attentive. The atmosphere is wonderful. 

I guess I just don't like soggy salad burgers that I have to eat with a fork."}

{"text":"This place is excellent! We recently moved from Hilo and have experienced mad AZ attitude :( 
but here EVERYONE is nice.and the happy hour prices are phenomenal! Poke is made the way it should be exceptional. Favorite place in all of phoenix if u like happiness and good food..."}
{"text":"On a scale of 1-10, I give it a 5.  The burger was tasteless, the bun ordinary. They mixed up our order -- I got fries instead of onion rings. They apologized and brought out onion rings a few minutes later which were fine, but not great. I nibbled some of the fries while waiting and they were average. I think $10 - $12 for a basic burger and fries (or onion rings at no extra charge) is out of line. The beer was good -- tasty and cold. Service was, again, average. The place was not crowded on a Friday night and I can see why. If you're looking for a good hamburger, keep looking. You can do better."}
{"text":"The design of this restaurant was very \"surfer-ish\" and has a happy vibe. The service is pretty quick and the food was great! I would definitely recommend the China Coast salad, but I doubt there's anything bad on the menu."}

{"text":"So we ordered nachos and they came out cold.  Also I have been waiting 10 minutes on a refill for my tea.  Sent back nachos waiting to see if they come out better.  2nd round of Nacho were great!!!  Burger came out perfect.  We had a new waitress but she apologized for her mistakes and was very sweet."}
{"text":"Drinks were great. Great customer service. The katy perry look alike waitress was very friendly! The beans were really delcious. The chips and salsa were amazing!"}
{"text":"I have always loved Islands since I grew up in SoCal. This is the only one in Las Vegas and sometimes I wonder if it will survive. The past few times in here the service has not been very good. Yesterday at 3:30 my family and I went in and it took an hour to get our food. The place was empty. When we eventually got our food , it was good as it usually is. I was supposed to get more onion rings, but they never came. The manager was supposed to bring the onion rings. She also offered us a free dessert which we never got. 

In order for this place to survive, it needs new management. The place should be packed, but it is very easy to get a table at 6 pm on a weekend night. That's not a good sign. I hope it improves. My family really does enjoy their burgers and fries."}
{"text":"Jacob was great!  He helped put little girl who hurt her ankle on top of being in general a great server.  Thanks, Jacob!"}

SOGGY Hamburgers! Once again Vegas What can we say! Cold fries. Nothing like California. I don't understand why they're cooking standards are so low here."}
{"text":"Burgers are overrated here. Everything is pretty much ala carte which makes it pricey for a burger joint. I had the teriyaki burger and it was ok. Pineapple burger slathered in teriyaki sauce. Not bad just a little messy. Alright burgers for $$. I would not consider this a good deal."}
{"text":"Delicious and great service. We normally sit at the bar but i love the quiet atmosphere and the happy, helpful servers."}
{"text":"Kinda pricey for a burger joint but hey, if you want cheap go to Jack In The Box! 
Amazing selection. Friendly staff. Clean restaurant."}
{"text":"Everything I expected from Islands chain:  Good burgers and fries.  I'm like the Kilauea because of the hint of jalepeno spice in it.  I try to stay away from burgers on the strip- actually I avoid the strip in general- so I agree that it's one of the better burger places of the strip.  My fav is the burger at the Springs Preserve Cafe- It's a Kobe beef burger. Yum!  I've tried LBS which is just across the street- everything came out cold, so I won't be going back there."}
{"text":"Burgers were nice an thick and juicy.  Didn't take advantage of the bottomless fries.  They were ok.  I preferred the red robin steak fries which aren't as hard. 

This place does have a lot more than burgers though."}
{"text":"My husband and my favorite place to eat! Too bad there isn't one in the east valley. I guess it saves us money because we'd be there every week if there was one closer to us."}
{"text":"I used to like going to Islands, but had not been there in quite some time.  My fiancé and I stopped at the Desert Ridge location on our way out of town, and it was an unmitigated disaster.  We ordered salads, and the lettuce was literally brown.  I am not exaggerating.  I ordered a chicken sandwich instead, which was awful.  Server did not refill my drink for half the meal, then came back with the wrong drink.  I will not be going back to any Islands' restaurants again."}
{"text":"Good burgers, guacamole had a black crust on it like it had been sitting around for a while, pretty gross. Mike was a nice enough waiter but should have seen what he was serving ( makes you wonder what else has been sitting around ) manager took it off the bill, didn't touch the side salad ( looked like was prepared hours earlier and had that been uncovered in a fridge smell ). Love desert ridge but won't return to Islands burgers"}
{"text":"I'll honestly never return to Hawaii after this experience either. Their tacky fake palm trees and birds has forever tarnished my image of the state. The word \"mahalo\" will not leave my lips again. Also, the Diet Coke was $3.25 and it tasted like Pepsi."}
{"text":"I love these guys, I don't go often since they're out of our way so instead we go to In-N-Out for premium burger needs but I love Island Burger. The staff is always great, the place is always clean, the burger options are fantastic, my sister enjoys their very healthy portion of chicken in her salad, and I always try to get the healthiest burger (turkey instead of red meat) to justify gorging myself on the unlimited fries. 

This isn't a $4 burger, you'll going to pay $10 a person at least but the burgers are big and tasty and you can substitute anyway you want. They have a lot of other stuff, including fish tacos and bla bla bla I always get the burgers. I honestly can't remember if I've ever left unhappy, maybe once but personally, I never hesitate to go here if I'm in the mood to pay 10 bucks for my burger and fries and the long drive. They're awesome and I plan on seeing a movie and eating here tomorrow."}
{"text":"Hadnt been to an islands in about 3 years. Was excited to happen upon one while in Avondale. I use to frequent the palm dessert, Ca. Location and  talked my self into an expensive burger even though i packed a lunch. Ordered the cheeseburger same as in the past but was disappointed to find that they either changed meat suppliers or az has akways used different meat. It was generic at best. Tasted more like a dennys burger than the gourmet burger i was expecting to taste. $16.00 for burger fry coke and tip. Dont know how u get repeat business. Maybe thats why it wasnt packed like the cali location s."}
{"text":"I go here for the buffalo wings and lava flows. I love that the wings aren't soggy drowning in sauce but are very flavorful. And the lava flows are always on point and Amanda Sue is the best waitress ever!"}
{"text":"Well got the answer why it was pretty empty on a Saturday. Food isn't very good. It's clean service was great but the food fell short with everybody at the table. The mahi mahi looked like a chicken tender gone wrong way over cooked. The burgers were eeh, I've had better $1 burgers and these were $10. The wife's was the regular joe one nothing special. I had the Kilauea burger, I like pepper but someone got happy with it to say the least and I just feel if you have to top a burger with deep fried red onions that's a pretty good sign right there your burger isn't very good. Even though I asked to not havethem it didn't improve the quality. I know I've said it before but they're way to many better places in town to get a great burger so trust me skip this spot, your taste buds will thank you."}
{"text":"I just love to come to my local Islands! The crew always make me feel welcome! Breanna and Lauren are my favorite servers and Carrie behind the bar is awesome!  Try the nachos thats my favorite! The atmosphere is very inviting!"}
{"text":"This place is all right, but there's nothing special about it. They need to realize you can get a burger & a beer in 20 different places in the neighborhood. Their \"special secret spice\" was a mixture of salt-and-pepper and watching surfers riding waves over and over again on screens was boring. if you haven't been there, you haven't missed anything. Friendly staff though."}
{"text":"The only good thing about this place was the size of the burger. Yes they were gourmet but the flavor was lacking. The female server wad in a rush, it's a good thing she ended her shift shortly and replaced by someone better. I wouldn't suggest doing sit down burger and paying extra for tip, because of so many other joints out there now, but if that's your thing then stick to red Robin; )"}
{"text":"I wasn't very impressed with the decor/atmosphere when entering, booths are a little too hard surfaces, at least the backs. I was looking forward to the fries as I'd been told they were outstanding and all you can eat. The fires served with my burger were like warm, maybe in the window too long. We were not offered more fries until they were clearing our plates. None of us wanted more but the offer was a bit late. 

I asked that my burger be served medium rare and was told medium was as rare as they would serve. It was actually closer to medium well. Nice looking burgers for three of us and my wife ordered fish tacos which she enjoyed. 

A side of onion rings at over $8 was a little over priced but they were good. 

Server was friendly and he kept our cokes full. 

All in all okay, just not awesome!"}
{"text":"Their fish tacos tasted a little too fishy & some parts tasted like the grill or just burnt. I give the tacos a 2/5. My boyfriend had a burger, don't recall which burger, but he said it wasn't very good. We ordered onion rings & it was a huge portion, but like everything else, it was mediocre. Maybe I'll give them another chance, but probably not any time soon. But all the workers were very nice!"}
{"text":"1st let me say that  serve kyla was one of the best  people  to serve us in a while she was spot on with the drinks  and when it came down to food she told us what was good now on to the food it was a 10 all day"}
{"text":"Looking for a place to watch the game and good food. There needs to b a good sports bar in this area of Gateway Pavillons. Of course its Friday night, we first went to native new yorker - packed No tables in bar area,  then to Red Robin- tv way to small to watch the game, then to Claim Jumpers again to bar area- i guess they were busy b/c waited & nobody greeted or came to our table, finally our last hope was Islands, greeted w/ a smile, bar area w/ nice 50in panasonic tv's, great waitress, awesome margarita, ordered the sliders, fries and wings, everything was great!  Really made our night, that's all I wanted was a good place to watch the game, great service and great food!"}
{"text":"Love!! I'm from Florida , and this place reminded me so much of back home, there was no beach of course but it felt like I was close to the beach with all the beachy decor. Food was delicious , drinks were even better."}
{"text":"My favorite family burger stop.  Grabbed takeout from here last night and the fries were still crispy when we got home 20 minutes later.  Now that's impressive!"}
{"text":"Came here midweek to get those Island feelings pre Willie K concert at the MIM. The former is a Hawaiin musician which inspired us to give this over the top chain restaurant  a whirl. Happy Hour was a good deal.
Mai Tais - great
Sliders-exceptional
Quesadilla- I don't like salsa inside my Q, it is off putting
Poke- nicely seasoned but cut too large and cut unevenly. One piece huge, another miniscule.. it was annoying in the mouth.
Service pleasant.
We will return if the stars ever align in which we are going to the MIM to see another Hawaiin musician and are hungry."}
{"text":"went for lunch. 2 adults and 1 toddler. food was not hot. beans were luke warm. no comp. chips and salsa. food was overpriced. wont b returning. better places in the area with much better dining exp."}
{"text":"Total lack of training at this restaurant. You have a 50+ year old manager allowing untrained teenage kids run the show.  We waited for 1hr to never be seated and to abandon the plan of eating at Islands. We were told when we got there that the table to accommodate our party of 12 was just finishing. We literally waited an Hour and kept getting told by the teenage staff, \"they are done we are just waiting for them to leave\".  I swear it was on repeat, that's all they kept saying. When we finally decided to leave and talk to the manager, he explained there was nothing he could do to get the people up from the table. I asked why not stop seating people outside and put tables together to accommodate us. Mind you this is after 4 people from our party already decided to leave because of the wait. Manager said they were unable to put tables together outside. As we left Islands to find another establishment, we happened to see a family of 8 seated on the patio with tables pushed together to accommodate them. No Customer Service what so ever. The front staff is under trained, the manager is not in control."}
{"text":"First time here and my experience went well.  The food tasted fresh the beer was good.  Although it's a run-of-the-mill chain restaurant I would probably come back for casual hamburger when I didn't feel like going to a drive-through.  The waitress who served me was kind efficient.  Hawaiian themed casual."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times, but it was awful this last time. Waited 40 minutes for a table, because they put a party of 2 at a table for 8. Then they put a blt on a hamburger bun and put layers of cheese on it. And burnt the bacon."}
{"text":"Service took a while even tho it wasent very busy, food is averange nothing special, cost is high for what you get .It's clean but dated ,all they have on the tv is surfing,I get the Island them but ... relly"}
{"text":"Extremely impressive service!  Our bartender-in-training, Dan and his trainer were as friendly, knowledgeable and bursting with personality as one could ever hope for.  These 2 are the kind of bartenders anyone would be lucky to have work for them;)  
Oh, the food, also great--they have a garden burger option for any of their delicious burger creations (I recommend the Kilauea if u like spicy) and endless fries!  Paired with an Islands brown ale and this vegetarian WON today!!! Couldn't be happier with my first experience here, and we will be back!!"}
{"text":"My favorite Islands to go to eat at. Great service and very helpful staff."}
{"text":"First time trying this place out. First ordered the spinach and artichoke dip. The spinach and artichoke dip was good and so was the salsa but the chips were super salty. I ordered a sandpiper burger which is a chicken breast with mushrooms,swiss cheese, tomatoes, and lettuce. The chicken was severely over seasoned and the ranch on the side was super salty as well. I also got sweet potatoe fries which were pretty good. The service was good our waiter was very attendant but, probably won't be back the food was over seasoned and over priced."}
{"text":"My first meal at Islands was a lot of fun. Its a neat looking place and the burgers really are quite good. I liked the fries that you could get refills on. 

The wait staff were all super nice, but they could check in on tables a lot more. That would be my only issue with the restaurant as we waited awhile to get what we needed. I really enjoyed the food though!"}
{"text":"Decided to have dinner here today and my food was terrible. I ordered the bluenami. The meat had no flavor. The fries were not fresh. The only reason I gave the restaurant a star is bcause of the excellent customer service and my mojito was great. I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Good everyday spot - fine burgers and I was glad when they opened here - used to go regularly in LA. Haven't been there for a bit, and prefer the Palm for burgers."}
{"text":"Kelsey was fabulous as our very informative server.  The hamburgers were perfectly pink and juicy and yummy.   Cold beers, hot fries and ice water constantly refilled.   Great place, friendly and speedy service - we will be back!"}
{"text":"I used to come to Islands in high school it's funny I don't think I ever had their burgers we saw always come for their tortilla soup cuz it was all you can eat I'm being starving high school kid it was great but wandered in here get their burgers I guess their island has no salt or seasoning though horrible no flavor I thought was just cuz I got a turkey burger but try my wives same way no seasoning in the flavor the meat Bland service was kind of shity she was slow at getting everything kind of that attitude and ask questions about things and then you but she didn't know I'm not sure which so many burger places are way better than this never going back"}
{"text":"I've always had good service and quality food at this Islands. Try the Hawaiian burger with cheese fries. Tons of calories but it's totally worth it. Pace yourself and you'll definitely have lunch tomorrow."}
{"text":"Maui chicken sandwich is so flavorful!  I cannot wait to go back when I am in Phoenix again.  This place can get busy so make sure to come early before you get too hungry.  I love the never ending french fries!"}
{"text":"Food was good, service was good.  Nothing at all to complain about.  For a chain restaurant, it's exactly what you'd expect.  I'd come back."}
{"text":"Decent food, terrible service. We came in as a party of five. Granted it was a busy Saturday night, but our server passed our table 4 times before we managed to flag her down. When she came to take our order, she asked how long it would take because she had to go sing happy birthday and cut a cake!! Sorry to be such a nuisance!! Then my friend's order was messed up (he wanted his beef patty done medium and it was well-done, we know because there was a wooden stick in the burger that actually said \"well-done\"), and my husband's drink order never came. The manager did come to correct the problem with the beef. But in general we just got the feeling the restaurant was too busy for us that evening. We didn't tip that well since we didn't feel our table was served at all. Will need to think twice before going back!!"}
{"text":"Love the islands. I travel long distances for the islands ever since the one in Mesa closed and I've been to many! This was not my favorite experience. The cheese fries (islands does thisthe best, ever in my opinion) were soggy fries and strangely too much cheese...how that happens im not sure but it was as if they sat too long and the fried became grease pockets and the cheese became gelatinous. Appealing, huh? The burger I ordered (again, usual favorite) was okay but the bun was on the verge of crusty like it was old and the server was probably oversat because we didn't see him much. It was definitely busy and we're okay with service norms but when other employees came to drop off food no one really acknowledged the stack of dishes accumulating at the end of the table nor the very empty drinks after a lengthy wait for our items to begin with."}
{"text":"I love coming here for lunch! Great lunch specials and the tortilla soup is awesome !!!!"}
{"text":"We love Islands! Such a great place for good food and a fun atmosphere. I love their classic big wave burger and my wife always gets their shorebird. She says it's the best chicken sandwich she's ever had. And she married me, so you know she has good taste."}
{"text":"I've been to this particular Islands restaurant several times. The service is always pretty good and the restaurant itself it clean. I always order the Hula burger. I'm giving it 3 stars because the food here is well nothing special. To be honest, I dunno why I come here. It's really basic. This last time I was there in particular, my food was just ok tasting. The meat patty itself was very thin. And it was expensive! My boyfriend and I both had water to drink and ordered a burger and it was $28.00 minus tip!!! In my opinion, in an area like Vegas where there a million unique burger joints, a place like Islands just doesn't belong."}
{"text":"Good food, fun atmosphere. They pack a punch with those burgers. Make sure to get their fries, they are unlimited, but don't go crazy. Lol"}
{"text":"I actually really like this Islands. I've been here twice and sat once in the restaurant and once in the bar. They have good happy hour specials in the bar. Food had been pretty good so far."}
{"text":"I came here with a friend. This place has gone very downhill. I am not very happy or enthused about their food. I did not know that asking for crispy chicken instead of grilled chicken on my salad would have resulted in $7 extra charge. I would have rather gone to Chick-fil-A and gotten me an entire meal for the same price. And supposedly this was supposed to be happy hour pricing. The waiter did not mention this increase in charge and did not mention anything at all until we received the bill and did not take care of anything even though we mentioned our dissatisfaction. My friends Burger was mediocre and was not cooked medium well like she asked. I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"A spur of the moment decision to celebrate my buddies belated birthday, a quick check of yelp app revealed this location.  I have been here many a moon ago, but had not memory other than it was a long time ago.

Walked in at was somewhat overwhelmed by the generic /Hawaiian motif.  It was a Sunday and the bar seemed to be the place to sit.  Not for the football because I am in protest mode despite being a hypocrite and being in a fantasy football league....but I digress...It just seemed a fitting place to chill and have a burger & beer lunch.

The bartender was friendly and attentive.  We ordered up some Cheddar Fries w/ bacon.  Tasty fries, cheese and added some bacon.  When the cheddar cools the dynamic changes but I am not hating....just add ranch.

The burger ordered was the \"Nalu Nalu,\" and contains Roasted garlic aioli, swiss, sautéed onion, mixed peppers, hot deli pepper rings & lettuce\" (Retrieved from https://www.islandsrestaurants.com/food).  It was delicious!  After the fries I could only eat half of it....speaking of fries, because I had already ordered a the appetizer, I had the burger come with onion rings.  They were....delicious!

Dang!  Even though I am not a fan of the plastic Island feel of this joint....when I read my words, I am definant fan of the tasty chow!"}
{"text":"Four stars for going on a Tuesday when kids eat free. Other than that, is still a quality burger,good food and service overall."}
{"text":"Island-theme restaurant with burgers, fish tacos, and a few other things, as well as happy hour and football specials. Staff is friendly, food is good with some execution issues.

Point Break burger is my favorite here, loaded with Gruyère & bleu cheeses, caramelized bacon & onion relish, lettuce, tomato & mayo. I love how they cook their burgers to medium here, but the large patty and overabundance of toppings, plus the medium cook, means the burger is on the brink of falling apart. I also blame the juiciness of the patty, to an extent.
All burgers come with bottomless fries, which is a great idea but not one I can handle- order to go if that's a death wish for you as well. Beware that your takeout fries may be cold and stale though...

Fish tacos are on the menu, but I have yet to try them. Swing by for Monday and Friday night football specials, in addition to their weekday happy hour specials."}
{"text":"We ordered the spinach and artichoke dip for an appetizer. It was mediocre. My burger was really tasty I had the barbecue burger. The onion rings and the wings were also mediocre. Overall they get a 3 for ok service and a tasty burger."}
{"text":"I thought our waiter was very funny and awesome. The girls who delivered our drinks were about as pleasant as a rattlesnake in my bed though."}
{"text":"One of the best burger joints in Las Vegas! One of the places I have been going to since I have been living here."}
{"text":"Food here is above average. Great place to bring your family if you have young children."}
{"text":"Great tacos! I know this place is known for burgers, but their NorthShore Chicken Tacos were great! I love that they let you substitute the beans for salad or fries too...nice variety. 

The iced tea wasn't my favorite though...maybe a little old? Didn't taste too fresh. 

Service was great...fast and friendly!"}
{"text":"I love coming to Islands.... honestly my favorite burger place in the valley.  I always get the Kilauea burger which has a great spice to it.  Service is always great at this location as well.  Great happy hour from 4-7"}
{"text":"Good food and service. Burgers better than expected. The fries have skin on. Very good."}
{"text":"I want to thank you for making my stomach sick every time I eat there. It is truly a please as I get to reacquaint my self with the bathroom. Seriously... Your food terrible but at least your staff is nice. Probably not coming back again; ever... So if you read this don't send me a coupon with a pleasant note saying \"we're sorry\" it will only end up in the toilet with the rest of my lunch."}
{"text":"Took my mom here for a bite before shopping in the nearby stores.  Sat outside, which was pleasant.  Food was OK (I had a BBQ salad that had  no \"green\" lettuce, just iceberg) and my mom had a burger).  Lava flows we ordered were pretty good and very large.  Service was great until the end of dinner when our waiter was nowhere to be found.   Had to track someone down inside to pay.

Probably will not return."}
{"text":"Coldest beers around - the taps are chilled and mugs frozen. Great place to grab a beer and a bite before or after the movies. Comes with a great people watching patio too."}
{"text":"Been coming to Islands at Desert Ridge for years since they opened. I really enjoy the atmosphere, service and great food."}
{"text":"Went there the other night for something different. I enjoy it and had a good meal at a good price. I would go there again if I am in the area. The atmosphere was nice and the service was fine too. I know it is a beach restaurant but all they show on there TV's were people surfing. I wish they had a game on instead. Watching the same surfer's got old very quick."}
{"text":"Excellent Luau Tacos - their famous teriyaki sauce with Kalua pork! The beans as the side were excellent! 
Customer Service was great too! Sheena did an excellent job taking care of us and making this good food recommendation."}
{"text":"I called to make a to go order and the lady told me to hold for 2 minutes while she finished up with another customer. I didn't mind at all ... until I was on hold for 15 minutes and then I hung up. Terrible customer service- food is okay."}
{"text":"Used to love going in to get my favorite three taco North shore and hang at the bar. I had not been to Islands for a while so I decided to grab lunch, guess what my favorite three taco meal that was right around $10 now only has two tacos for the same money. Really don't think this is a strategy that works for us cash paying folks. Guess what your on my boycott list until you fix the menu back to what it used to be."}
{"text":"Took the family out to this Islands for our Friday night dinner. A little back story I grew up in San Diego and went a few times to the Islands in Carmel Mountain  Ranch. The wifey lived in Rancho Bernardo for years and went to that particular location also. That place was almost always busy but we always got at least decent service. So now I was craving Islands and decided to check this location out. We live in Henderson so it's a good 30 minute drive. We walk in and the place is basically dead. I could see at least 6 vacant tables. The first worker sees us and walks over and says he'll be right back. A good 5 minutes later another guy comes over and say he'll be with us shortly. He walks to their little podium and starts writing. Then the phone rings and he motions with his hand another minute or so. So finally he seats us. Of course they put us in the noisy area next to some lady who can't shut the fuck up. It wouldn't bother me so much that she couldn't stop talking it was how loud she had to talk. My wife and I talked about how some places like to seat us with other families with kids. We agree it's a common practice.  It does take awhile for our server to get to us but finally we get the ball rolling. She orders the kids meals then we order our meals. We both want burgers but the odd thing is our server asks immediately \"Is medium okay\"? We're both cool with that since that's what we usually order anyway but found it odd that she was pushing the medium so hard. This is where it gets interesting but not really. We get the food in literally 2 minutes. I couldn't believe how fast we got our food. I've never gotten it that fast not even at a fast food restaurant. But when we started eating we realized how they were able to cook our food that fast. MY burger and the wifey's burger were basically raw. They barely seared the outside of the patties so it was all pink inside. After that we never saw our server again until after the meal. Oh by the way I was hit with a spray of Ranch dressing while I was eating my burger. A server at another table was clearing the table and dropped a full container of Ranch dressing. It shot everywhere but of course it only hit me. Got me in the shirt and the face. I was looking down so when I got hit it felt like someone spit in my face. I semi yelled \"WTF! who spit on me\"? Two servers came over and asked if I was okay. They kept asking me but that was it. So we finished our meal and we had finished our ice teas halfway through the meal but nobody ever came by to refill our drinks. We didnt see our server until she brought the check out. The whole time once we sat down we felt like they wanted us to eat fast and leave fast. We felt very rushed and we couldn't figure out why because for the time we were there the place didn't fill up. I would guess this is a management decision. Get them in and out as fast as you can. At least that's what it felt like. It sucks for the servers because they aren't gonna get any tips that way :) Just a theory of mine though. So make sure to order the burger the way you want it. The fries were good if you like crispy and don't expect to get a refill on your tea. We won't be going back to this location ever. We have a ton of burger places in our immediate area so theirs no reason to drive this far for mediocre service and food. Plus we hate leaving a restaurant parched."}
{"text":"Can't even remember the number of times we've eaten here.  Always good burgers, nice crispy fries. If you like flavored ice teas, try the passion fruit one. Tasty!"}
{"text":"This review is only for the customer service. I've been coming here since 2005 and never had a issue with the food in all these years, it's fantastic by the way. I was just in there today and it was pretty slow being 1:30pm on a Wednesday. We sat there for 14 minutes. Yes I kept track. We sat there and no one came, no drinks, nothing. Should I have went to the hostesses or the bar and asked to out our order in? Probably, but that's not the point is it. We left and no one even noticed."}
{"text":"Excellant Food , Excellant service from our waitress Amy and GREAT prices!! Wish there was one in the East Valley.  Anytime we are at Desert Ridge we go to the Islands.  But its the worth the trip even from Chandler for a 'treat\"."}
{"text":"I always get the bleunami with bacon...omg....
and some sugary,hawaiian themed cocktail. rusty anchor was good and last time i got the good ol' mai tai.
Love the island scenery in there, and last time, surfing competitions were actually on the tv :)"}
{"text":"Being known for their burgers I was expecting something great- it was good but not great.  I ordered the bleunami burger with onion rings and it only came with 5 onion rings. They are a good size ring and the breading was good but there was only 5! We also went at lunch with a party of 12 and the biggest booth couldn't accommodate us Comfortably so we had to split up. Not recommended for large parties. The service was good and fast. Our server was on top of drinks and checked back regularly."}
{"text":"Really miss their restaurants in the SE valley, so this was a great treat.  Stopped in before final four.  Thought its proximity to the stadium would have resulted in more traffic. Surprisingly quiet (a good thing), and a quick drive to the stadium.  Our waitress was great, the burgers were great and we got in and out in a decent amount of time.  Will definitely return any time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Ok, here we go.....greeted and seated quickly
Waiter, Jake, came over right away, and wow, from start to finish, GREAT quest service !
Appetizer, food, pins colada was really good. 
But best part of this visit was our waiter Jake !
By the way, my first time there, and I will be back.
Thanks Jake !"}
{"text":"I am updating my review because I felt like Islands handled the matter very professionally and in a timely manner. I will be back because of Jennifer's professionalism and way of handling the situation!"}
{"text":"Our server, Natalie, provided the best service we've received in a long time.  Our drinks were always full and she did it all with a beautiful smile!  Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Another great dinner with great service at the Islands tonight!  It's that place you can count on to always be consistently good. Servers and the Managers are very welcoming know matter how busy it may be there. Also, the food come out just as ordered and always hot!  Great job, can't wait for more of this restaurants in the metro Phoenix area!"}
{"text":"I've been here more than a few times and will certainly continue eating here.
First, the food.  a wide selection of burgers (and other dishes). I'm a sucker for the Hula (swiss cheese, mushrooms).  You can get a turkey burger or a veggie burger instead of the beef (I opt for the turkey which is very good).  You can also choose a wheat or white bun.  Both are very good. 

Your burger comes with fries or onion rings or veggies.  The fries are just the way I like them, crisp on the outside, soft in the middle.  The onion rings are OK but not great.

Now the service.  Outstanding!  I think the average age of the servers is 18.  I only mention this because if you think (like your parents did) that the next generation will be the end to civilization as we know it, they'll prove you wrong. They're all very friendly, knowledgeable and eager to see if everything is OK and refills show up automatically."}
{"text":"Service was great! I enjoyed my burger and watch the dbacks can't get any better than that. The food was cooked perfectly and the service was never slow."}
{"text":"I moved my family to Vegas from San Diego. My wife was a long time Islands employee (15 years to be exact) at their Mira Mesa location in San Diego. When we moved up to Vegas we knew of this Sunmerlin location, but it was a little far from us in the Anthem neighborhood. We decided to make the trek up there and buy dinner. They knocked it out of the park, however the pricing was the only complaint I had. To feed a family of 4 we were 60 dollars out the door. And that didn't include apps. Maybe we were so accustomed to my wife's employee discount, but feeding two kids and two adults shouldn't cost 60 for 4 entrees."}
{"text":"This place used to have better service a few years back, but now the servers just don't seem to care much about the customers.

Its a shame because they still have some good burgers, just don't expect stellar service"}
{"text":"After a hard days work, I like to treat myself to good burger. Islands has a good burger. One of my favorites is the Kilauea Burger. It is a 1/2 burger with jalapeno and crushed black pepper on a wheat bun with lettuce, tomatoes and crispy onions. Which tasted great. The waitress provided us with great customer service"}
{"text":"Good burgers, good location. The prices have gone up recently so that's a tad disappointing. But endless fries and the burgers are fairly large, I'd recommend sharing. My favorite is the Maui burger on wheat, medium. My kids live for the tiki tenders with a side of ranch. The tortilla soup was surprisingly good. Mixed drinks are good as well. Desserts are huge and made for sharing. Love the Hawaiian vibe and all the flat screens. Depending on the season it's either surfing, football or basketball. Good family restaurant if you're in the mood for a burger & beer."}
{"text":"Great experience! Stopped in for a couple of beers and an appetizer, we had Sam as our waitress. She brought our drinks and food so quickly. And they were great! LOVE islands!"}
{"text":"Just ok not great. Been there twice. First time there i had the \"pipeline\" which is there chili burger. the chili meat had no flavor like it was out of the can and the meat on the burger was small.other time I went I had the guac burger (I 4got what they named it)  small meat and couple of slices of avocado, just ok.Wish they had a Whataburger here ."}
{"text":"I live in the area, and have been there a few times.  Tonight, I went in after watching a movie with my wife and sister in law. This was the best experience ever. 

From the moment we approached the front door, the greeter Rachel was very helpful and energetic! Jake our server was very helpful and patient. The manager Tracy stopped several times at our table to ensure we were having a good experience. She was so friendly, assertive, and full of energy! All three of these employees are an asset to the business. 

The food was fantastic! The beer was ice cold, and so refreshing. The prices are very fair.

I've eaten at every restaurant in the area, and this is by FAR the best! I will definitely go back, and will recommend Islands, to all of my friends and family. 

If you're looking for a place to eat, with excellent food, service, and atmosphere... This is the place for you!"}
{"text":"Okay service since the last time I was here.  Food still good. 7 TV'S in a small venue.  Not bad."}
{"text":"This place has decent food. Generally, it's not too heavy, but they still give you a sufficient amount of food. The burgers are good, but nothing to log in your diary. They have some carnitas tacos that are worth ordering (they are seasonal I think- so if they have them on the menu, you better order them)."}
{"text":"first time that I visit the island burger restaurant,  past it everyday on my way home for 9yrs living in Phoenix,  should have kept going, order wings and it was salty and dry, husband order burger and it was tasteless not seasoned  french fries was burn. 1 out 10 1 neverrrr going back. staff was nice, nothing against them. food sucks."}
{"text":"Fast service
Friendly service

Food Was Amazing

I really do not have 1 compliant.

Fresh and put together.
Green tea was delish!

Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Unless the recipe for the fries have changed in the last 3 years, the fries were just... Shitty. We asked for a fresh batch of fries and it wasn't that much better.

Giving this place a generous three stars instead of two. Drinks were strong."}
{"text":"I've been going here about 2-3 times a week. Amazing happy hour menu and fries to die for."}
{"text":"Not a bad place. Burger was good but disappointed on switching from endless fries to onion rings. Only got 4 onion rings. Really? Four?"}
{"text":"No complaints here! My friend and I were craving piña coladas and the wait at sand bar was 45 minutes (that's what we get for trying to get in on tequila and tacos Tuesday). The Islands was not busy at all and we were seated right away. We ordered piña coladas and an appetizer off the happy hour menu. The service was really good and we were checked on several times with our waters being refilled constantly. The artichoke spinach dip was good and the piña coladas were heavenly."}
{"text":"I haven't been to this restaurant for awhile and thought to try it out again.  The service staff was very nice, but I had a bad experience.  I ordered a turkey burger which by the way was very tasty, but came upon a long curly hair after my first bite of the second half of my sandwich.  Our server was appalled and took it back and brought back a new sandwich for me to take home.  Upon eating it a day later, the burger was extremely spicy hot, as though it had habanero added to it; the original burger was not spicy hot at all.  The menu does not specify the option for spicy hot or not.  I just could not eat it.  The Manager did remove the sandwich from  my bill, but I was disappointed that he/she never came by to talk to me."}
{"text":"My wife and I were out celebrating our 4th anniversary together and decided to stop in at Island's as an impromptu visit. We've been to Island's many times before and this location has always been good to us. However, our server Jorge made this visit the best we've had yet. Our diets have changed significantly since we last ate at Island's so we asked for vegan specific suggestions. Jorge went above and beyond the call of duty and attended to our every need without us asking much.

Then, the manager stopped by our table and was super attentive to us as well. We shared that Jorge did an exceptional job and hope he gets rewarded accordingly. Of course, we left him a substantial tip, but I think it hardly gives Jorge the credit he deserves. 

We will return to Island's and most likely insist on having Jorge for our server. 5-freakin' stars well-earned!"}
{"text":"Met for drinks and appetizers. Chris in the bar was so attentive food was great service was better.."}
{"text":"Great place for a Burger! You can't go wrong with a delicious Hawaiian Burger and good crispy fries. Plus, their Hawaiian Punch drink is always refreshing, especially during the summer."}
{"text":"My husband and I came in for dinner, had the Pipeline burger, was really good....you have to try their Kona Pie for dessert though...super yummy.  This was our 2nd time here, we both enjoyed our food and the atmosphere both times. We recommend this place"}
{"text":"Burgers are amazing. Prices for kids are ridiculous but all in all a great place. Service was not the greatest. Took 15 min to get something to drink and didn't see the waitress till our food came.  That has to be one of my Pet Peeves in life.  The food definitely makes up for the service."}
{"text":"This place is essentially a Jimmy Buffett themed TGI Fridays.  And I don't mean that as a compliment.  I split the quesadillas as an appetizer and they weren't good.  There was some sort of pepper relish in them that added a weird flavor.  For the entree I had the tortilla soup which was very average (kind of watery but avocados were fresh, so they get points for that).  I got the sense that they were known for their burgers, so I might recommend sticking with those if you insist on going.  But overall, I thought this place was cheesy and pretty mediocre."}
{"text":"Food is consistently amazing. Ordered a Rincon burger (it's no longer on the menu but when your server knows what you're talking about it's always nice). My fiancé ordered the Kiluau burger, he was very pleased as well. Our server Stephanie was great and basically it was a great experience overall. Will continue coming back here."}
{"text":"Burgers are decent,  Fries very inconsistent.  They have a great pesto chicken sandwich.  Best sandwich in the joint..  Otherwise pretty mediocre"}
{"text":"The place to go if you're having a veggie burger craving. I typically get the Hawaiian burger; sweet BBQ sauce and grilled pineapples. They actually do cook their veggie burgers too, unlike some other meat-heavy establishments that just stick that shit in the microwave and call it a night. So A+ for that!

I wish they had more vegetarian options but now i'm just complaining. French fries are good too."}
{"text":"I went to Islands (Desert Ridge) alone. My server, Wade, sat down WITH me to take my order. He really made me feel welcome! 

I ordered a cup tortilla soup and a Malibu burger with a Caesar salad. My soup was warm; perfect temperature to eat. My burger was so juicy and full of flavor, I almost died because of how good it was! Wade, was so awesome that he didn't charge me for substituting Caesar salad instead of fries when it was $1.49 extra. Sweet! 

My experience was fast and efficient. Complaints: absolutely none. I had forgotten about Islands! But it's cool I can revisit an old restaurant and have a new experience. I left him a nice little tip. Thanks Wade P!"}
{"text":"hmmm I don't want to be too harsh. Everything was very so so here, not really bad. My girlfriend and I both ordered burgers....after all, this is supposed to be their specialty. I ordered the Bleunami, It was pretty much a sonic burger with really watered down bleu cheese dressing. It also has bleu cheese crumbles which didn't taste like bleu cheese at all. I thought that was weird, and cheap. I ordered it with onion straws which were forgotten. Then I also ordered onion rings instead of fries. I wouldn't have, if I knew I would only get 4 rings......again....weird. My girlfriend's burger arrived wrong, so they took it back....scraped off what was wrong and fixed it. She didn't like the \"endless\" fries. I waited for her burger to be scraped to start eating, so both of our burgers weren't hot. :( We didn't get alcohol and with tip our bill was 35 bucks. Smashburger would've been the same and 10 times better. Sooo we are left still looking for any truly good food here in Las Vegas....disappointed....again.  OH, I will say the server was friendly and somewhat apologetic about our food."}
{"text":"Hubby and I ate lunch here today and what we had was, for the most part, quite tasty. I had the Hula burger (with swiss cheese, sauteed mushrooms, lettuce and tomato) on a whole wheat bun which was very good. 

Fries came with the burger (you can sub onion rings or some salads) and were all-you-care-to-eat, like Red Robin. The fries were just OK- they tasted a lot like In-N-Out's. 

They do have veggie and turkey burger options. 

Hubby chose the veggie tacos which were very fresh, with avocado, corn, black beans, red and yellow bell peppers, and zucchini on soft whole wheat tortillas. On the side was an \"island slaw\" which was vinegar based (maybe a little too much so) but very fresh with cabbage, carrots, jicama, red bell pepper, and green onions. 

Service was just fine. This is a place we'd come back to, if we found ourselves in this neck of the woods again."}
{"text":"Awesome service and amazing burgers. I got the Hawaiian and it was cooked perfect and was hot. The bathrooms were clean. The service was fast and on point. Not disappointed at all. Strongly recommend the sweet potato fries they were great."}
{"text":"Burgers and beers are awesome!  Great deals on Monday and Thursday football nights!"}
{"text":"Food is good, no real high expectations - it's a burger joint. Food is always consistent which is nice. Service though is hit or miss. Last night we had a girls that was pleasant and friendly, she said thank you everytime she left the table even if there was no reason for her to say it. After we ordered we didn't see her until she dropped off check. Heard, \"I'm cut\" from server station and knew it was her. She was dragging her feet to pick up check because she was busy doing sidework - kinda irritating when you have to hunt down your server to leave."}
{"text":"Have not had a burger here in at least a decade. They were actually cooked well done and pretty good. They do not appear to be 1/2 pound, but more likely 1/3 pound, which does makes the price point (most are over $10) a bit high, but they do include those tasty skin-on fries.Just went with the thousand island version and added bacon on a white bun for a pretty decent experience. They load the raw onions on there, so watch your breath or take some onions off, but otherwise a good big burger. I also tried the secret spices in the shaker on my fries and that amps things up a bit. Not sure why I haven't been here in so long, but it's back on the list if in area, but not a destination burger place."}
{"text":"I found myself with an hour to waste last week while I waited for work on my cell phone. So I decided to go in for a bite to eat since it was dinner time and the smell in the parking lot was good. 

I ended up having a nice time as I set at the bar and conversed with a senior couple that comes in frequently. We both ordered appetizers since they were half price at happy hour and we all had a drink. I had a bottle beer. They only offer a dollar off drinks at happy hour and they are still overpriced.

The food was ok. The bartender that basically ignored me and had 3 others assist me kept talking to the couple I was talking to also. She never spoke to me or made any eye contact. Hmmmm
Anyway she said on more than 3 accounts how she loved the cheese fries and onion rings we were sharing. Maybe she wanted some? Well the orders were bigger than the 3 of us could consume and we trashed the remaining. LOL

I thought the Onion rings were grand, but was not impressed with the cheese fries. At half price they are a good deal for either but at full price I would rethink before spending 7 bucks on fries."}
{"text":"I absolutely love the tropical decor but the food was mediocre and over priced. Worst salsa I ever tasted! The silverware was dirty like they just rinsed off the silverware and didn't  wash it. $7 for onion rings and it was just barely enough for us to share. The strawberry lemonade tasted like it was made from a powder mix. Our waitress was no where to be found most of the time and when she finally did come she would just blurt something out and run off!! Not the relaxing fun lunch I was hoping for :-(
But on the upside the Kona pie (mudpie) was amazing. Not quite worth the $50+ bill tho for just my husband and myself."}
{"text":"The Margarita's were awesome! Had the Malibu burger, just didnt have much flavor at all. Fries seem to be short and little pieces.  The atmosphere was great! Service wasn't bad, overall i just wasn't that impressed with the restaurant.  I will try it again hopefully it will be better next time."}
{"text":"Islands isn't just a restaurant...it's a lifestyle.  You can get anything here, from burgers and fries to soups and salads.  Great service and great food; who doesn't like that?  Islands is perfect for kids and adults!"}
{"text":"I like the surfer, ocean, tiki vibe that's here. The TVs are always playing a surfing channel. It makes the atmosphere really sparkle and helps with the Phoenix heat. The food here is good nothing really special about it. They do however have a pretty good lunch special menu. It's also one of the few places in the valley that I've seen Longboard on tap.

I'm a fan and do like coming here once in awhile to get a beer and burger."}
{"text":"We went to a location in california and it's was good, service was eeehh but onion rings are good... It's location was ok the food is good, the service was great and pricing is good for 2 ppl considering it is FINE BURGERS was only 30 bucks, hey that's a good deal!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat a meal, or enjoy happy hour.  Fun atmosphere, friendly staff, and great food.  I love pretty much everything on the menu; my favorites are the big wave and fries, the veggie tacos, and chips and salsa at happy hour.  The beers are ice cold here."}
{"text":"This was an okay lunch choice. Nothing extraordinary, but the burger was pretty tasty (albeit overpriced). The service was attentive and friendly and it was not crowded. Ok, but I'm in no rush to return."}
{"text":"Sheena in the bar was fast and friendly. Perfect spot for lunch! Try the blt! Always get a place to sit right away and friendly service."}
{"text":"Went on a sunday, gf and i ate at LBS last time, more than just burgers, i actually had a wrap. price range around 8-12 not too bad. Sauce was good, onion rings and fries were good. Pretty much what you would expect Nothing AMAZING but i was happy that football was on tv so i could check scores and watch NE roll TEN  :P
No dessert, would only go back if in the area and lazy to drive far away"}
{"text":"I come here pretty much every time I go to Desert Ridge for shopping. The food here is pretty good and the waiting time is short. The staff is accomodating and always lets us sit where we want if it's available. Over the years my wife and I pretty much narrowed it down to the bottomless tortilla soup and the Hawaiian Burger combined with a Blue moon beer. The latest on the Hawaiian Burger is that you can order it now with an extra layer of pulled pork. Oh man that thing is so juicy and full of flavor. I can definitely recommend it to anyone who likes Burgers. The waiters are mostly on top of their game and check on you regularly, but without being annoying."}
{"text":"Happy hour is Monday - Friday from 3 to 6:30pm in the bar area. Both times I've been here, nothing really wowed me. My last visit, the service was terrible. There were only 2 tables occupied in the bar area, but our server took forever. Our food came and we asked for sauce. We were finished with our food and the sauce still didnt come. She was still going to bring it, but our food was gone by then. Even when we asked for our check.....took soo long that I just left cash and bounced. It would be nice if the server would come around more often. One positive note is that they make their drinks pretty strong. I dont think I would go out of my way to go back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Great place to get a burger. Waitress quick and courteous. Good food delivered fast. Nice place to bring friends and family."}
{"text":"Nothing special about this place.  Clean and the food is okay. I go because my one son loves it.  Have to keep the kids happy.  Never had a bad experience but never had anything stand out either.  My fav dish is the Spinach artichoke dip."}
{"text":"Just ate here again.  The buns are stale....to point not only did the bread fall apart it tasted off as well....old bread!!   This place is waaaay overpriced for a freaking cheeseburger.  $15 for a chili burger w fries is a ripoff and these prices must have gone up.  Also $8!!!!!!for a 20 something oz large long board.  Ripoff.  I used to enjoy this place.  Won't be back.   $28 w tip for a burger fries and beer.  Hell just go to tbones for a filet.   They will go out of business at this location if price is an indicator.... $8 for a beer???? Like it's a red bull vodka or something.  On other hand...great place to hide the kids in a environment they can be themselves while you at stare at your wife wondering \"how are we going to pay for this\""}
{"text":"I was in HEAVEN!!!!  Finding an Island's Restaurant in Arizona and devouring THE BEST NACHOS EVER was enough to make my year!!!  Kristen was our server and she NAILED it!!!  I'm very picky  about my nachos and very specific when ordering them (the cheese has to be melted all the way through )
She GOT it and they were PERFECT!!!  I was soooo HAPPY!!!  And I made sure to tell her manager that she was AMAZING, too !!!  Any server that goes the extra mile to please her guests deserves to be recognized.  ."}
{"text":"Well I know I am not a food critic and really not much of a fan of food but hey a girl had to eat. After reading the reviews I felt like I was unaware of what good food taste like. I thought the food was good. The service better. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The food is nothing spectacular. The only reason to go is because kids eat free on tuesday."}
{"text":"Sat outside with a small group of people so as to enjoy the mild weather.
That mango margarita with an extra shot in it was fabulous (so much so that I ordered a second one the same way), and those cheddar fries...!!  My friend did not steer us wrong on those!
Freshly cut skin-on potatoes fried crisp on the outside and tender on the inside.  Not greasy at all, and piping hot, too!  On top of the mound of freshly-fried potatoes was melted (cheddar?) cheese and chopped chives or green onions.  They were really delicious with the ranch dipping sauce served alongside.  Soooo goood!  I'll certainly get those again!"}
{"text":"Overpriced \"gourmet\" burger place....No seasoning on burger or cold over done fries. Burger nothing really to write home about. Save your money and go to a five guys or in n out. No burger should cost 12 bucks....srry not coming back."}
{"text":"The service was quick and easy and our food came out in a hurry. We did come close to closing time so I felt a little bit rushed to order and eat (we still left about 20 minutes before closing time). I also had a few questions about the menu that were answered quickly by our server who was also very polite and checked back often."}
{"text":"Our server was bland. she made vicky the robot look more human. Yes, she was able to deliver our needs, but her connection was very minimal. 

The food was great though. Tortilla soup had chunks of avocado. Kilauea was good medium. one burger meal was enough to fill me  and bf up. Especially because of the bottomless fries, which we took home as leftovers. 

Sunday NFL  above us is always a bonus."}
{"text":"Was having a date night with my teenager son and he wanted a burger. We usually go to RR across the street and thought what the heck, try something new. We were both pretty disappointed. The burgers were bland at best and having to pay extra for the french fries was kind of ridiculous. We could have paid the same price elsewhere, probably less and gotten bigger, better burgers and not had to pay extra for fries."}
{"text":"Service makes a true difference. Teddy was are waitress and was truly amazing. We had a big group and she did great. Food was good too ;)"}
{"text":"The place was almost empty on a Tuesday night at 8pm, which is odd given that most Summerlin restaurants are always packed any night of the week. The only other customers there, were complaining to the manager while we were waiting for our burgers. Our hamburgers were good, but the fries were overcooked and dripping with oil. We asked for another order of fries, but this time appropriately cooked, however after waiting 20 minutes we never received them. The waiter was never intended on giving us new fries, and he was ready to send us off with the bill immediately. We won't be returning."}
{"text":"I have to first say I am a chef for a living and do not usually enjoy corporate chain franchises. I very rarely write reviews as well but the service and food from this establishment was so far beyond my expectations that I felt it necessary to give the credit where it is deserved. Heather made the experience exceptionally enjoyable with her great attitude, fantastic drinks (especially the Mai Tai's). If you find yourself there at happy hour you'll be at good hands with Heather."}
{"text":"Very unimpressed. I ordered the Malibu burger, but it just didn't taste right! The lettuce tasted like it hadn't been rinsed properly, the burger wasn't anything special. Altogether I felt like I overpaid. The service was okay, but for whatever reason I was relieved when we left. I wouldn't go there again unfortunately."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I'm just a bit sad cause they only have one location. I love the location though. The first time I went here was with an old friend. They told me it was good. So I met up with them. I love the atmosphere here. It's so relaxing and calm compared to any other burger joint. 
I took my boyfriend here for the first time and when he took a bite into his blue cheese burger he seriously had an erection and his eyes were watery cause he fell in love with this place. The service here is good. From all the times me and my boyfriend went there, we've never experienced a bad customer service."}
{"text":"Always a wonderful experience. One of my hubby's and I favorite place! Love their wings just the right amount of spice. Artichoke dip is amazing! Staff is amazing!"}
{"text":"Burgers are just so so, I hadn't been here since I've moved to Las Vegas and I was not impressed and probably wont be back."}
{"text":"The food here is horrible! Absolutely awful! I am surprised by all of the positive reviews.  Came here because I won a gift certificate and thank god because I would regret paying for my \"meal.\"

The hamburger tasted like a Jolly Rancher. It was a plain hamburger but had some weird watermelon flavor in the defrosted mass produced bun perhaps? The hamburger patty reminded me of a TV dinner Salisbury Steak. It was very light and had the texture of a sponge.  

The service was good. After eating at this establishment, I threw up when I got home. The scent of watermelon meat is still in my nose.

Never again!"}
{"text":"Islands is a chain restaurant that specializes in burgers and fries. They also have tacos and salads on the menu. Food was standard. I had the Maui burger with a veggie patty, whole wheat bun, and sweet potato fries (An additional $1.50 to substitute). 

Service was good. Our waiter was provided refill on our drinks and stopped by to check on us throughout the evening.

Plenty of parking available in the shopping center."}
{"text":"The burgers are amazing! The service is good! Drink prices could be better!...good place to go with friends on a Friday night!"}
{"text":"I have wanted to try Islands for a long time.  No time like the present. I aimed  to show family visitors Desert Ridge Mall and this was what fit our needs for a varied menu, family atmosphere and middle range prices.
Our table of 5 orders ranged from hamburgers to fish tacos to salad. ALL of the selections were deliciously fresh and reasonably sized portions.  Perfect lunch/mid  day meal.
From the welcoming hostess- to the waitress - tropical themed decor - clean bathrooms --thirst  quenching cocktails, - speed of food arrival - it was a pleasant experience.  
I will be back for dinner & movie date nights"}
{"text":"Good Times Saturday afternoon 

A few San tan Hop shocks, chips & Salsa. Then some wings for lunch.  
Always a good time great service here bartenders Jess & Heidi. Always a smile and quick with the refills."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that our waitress was amazing, she was friendly, nice and attentive to me and my guest. The reason for my two stars is because 1. I order the mai Thai and the drink tasted horrible it taste more of the hard liquor than anything (I thought this drink was suppose to be fruity, which in other restaurants IT IS!!!)which my waitress did switch it without asking any questions. 2. I order the piña colada which it was better than the Mai Thai but was still missing something. 3. My burger well it just didn't had a good taste and why well because when I bit into it I took a bit a big chunk of onion. I love onions but not like that lol. Let's just say overall I would come back for the good service that I received from my waitress and the wings. 

P.S. Manager please train your bartender to do a better Mai Thai!!!"}
{"text":"Great burger and draft beer. Can tell they change their kegs. Amanda at the bar was amazing. Never seen anyone work so hard and efficiently."}
{"text":"I've been here several times but the last time was just too dreadful not to share. First, one the burgers didn't say anything about mayo, yet it had mayo on it. The burger I got had more pink then it should have for being medium well :|. Also, there was a middle aged cougar woman screaming the lyrics to \"accidently in love\" song. I wanted to cry! I've had a lot better experience here and islands in la and San Diego."}
{"text":"Our server Gabby at the bar was absolutely amazing.  We hadn't even been here in a few months and she remembered where I worked for the past two jobs as well as gave us amazing service!  We love the food at this place (although wish we could get a burger mid-rare instead medium) and again Gabby is amazing and will keep us coming back time and time again."}
{"text":"My husband and I give this restaurant a four and a half.  We went there for the first time today (04.20.14).  First of all, we were greeted the moment we walked in by the cheerful hostess and seated right away.  Our server, Andrew, was very attentive and checked back on us and made sure we had refills on our iced tea.  We started with nachos which were good.  I ordered the fish tacos which were very tasty and came with a side of beans topped with some sort of queso fresco.  I don't usually go crazy over beans but I have to say that these were very delicious!  The fish tacos were cooked well and had a creamy sauce - yum!  My husband ordered the tortilla soup and said it was delicious.  The restaurant seemed very clean and again, the staff made it a very pleasant experience.  I don't usually choose \"island\" type restaurants or burgers but I was glad that we visited and would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Our waitress Sheena was outstanding!
We had great service when ordering appetizers and and the awesome Longboard burger with cheese. 
I will definitely return to this location.

Henderson Girls!"}
{"text":"We arrived for lunch and were seated immediately.  Our waiter, Alonzo C., looked a bit harried, running between tables.  He came to take our drink order and we also gave him our meal order.  We thought it a bit strange that another table that came in after us and ordered food after us had received their meal before we did.  After 25 minutes, Alonzo came by and asked if we wanted more iced tea.  We asked if our food would be coming soon.  Soon another waiter stopped by (which we assume was the manager as he did not introduce himself) and apologized for the long delay in bringing our food.  After that either Alonzo or the manager stopped by every 5 minutes or so to see if we were okay.  When the food did arrive, the vegetables that came with the turkey burger looked like they were freezer burned and fresh from the microwave.  I would expect from a restaurant like \"Islands\" that vegetables would be fresh."}
{"text":"OMG great customer service! My friend and I came here to have a yummy burger and this is exactly what we got. Their selection of burgers is huge and I had the hardest time deciding which one to order. I wanted bacon on my burger, but even though it did not come with it, I was able to pay a little bit more to have it added.

There was no wait and was able to sit down right away. Our waitress was very attentive and got us our drink refills before we could even ask! The restaurant had plenty of TV's to watch Sunday football. It was a very fun atmosphere with large plants hanging from the ceiling along with fake parrots. Lots of seating and had a nice large patio. Fun restaurant and I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"It had been a very long time since I had been to an Islands and it will probably be a long time before I go again. It wasn't bad, it just wasn't for me. The service when we came in was efficient and friendly. We were told it was a 10 minute wait but it only ended up being 5. Drinks were brought out quickly, as were the refills, and it didn't take long for the food to arrive. The interior had a fun beach, surf theme to it with lots of plants and fake birds, and surfing on the tvs.

The food...I had the Toucan chicken sandwich and my son had a basic cheeseburger. When I say basic I mean bun, cheese, and burger patty...he had everything else removed. Both came with a side of fries. The fries were these little chunks with the skin still on and no flavor. They just did not do it for me. When a teenager won't eat the fries that says something. My sandwich however was good. It had teriyaki sauce, pineapple, and lettuce. Messy but tasty. My kid said his burger was good. 

The service which started out so great fell apart towards the end. We sat and waited forever for our server to clear our plates and bring a bill. At one point we had to flag down another server to go find him.

Dinner for two was $30.00."}
{"text":"I always think it's a bit silly to review chain restaurants because you almost always know exactly what you're getting. A Chili's in New Jersey tastes exactly like the Chili's in San Fran.

Island's is a little bit of an exception though. While there are a ton in SoCal where I'm from, this is the only location out here in Vegas. For that reason, I think they deserve some recognition. 

So their burgers are radical, bro. Big Wave w/ cheddar cheese for the big kahuna over here. I always appreciate the option of having a wheat bun as well. They also have KILLER tortilla soup. I always sub that instead of fries. Which, BTW, fries are single handedly the most overrated side dish in the world, maybe universe. I also recommend the chips & salsa as a starter. First, unlimited refills, ammaright? Second, they are really good. Just like Chili's actually, if you're a fan of theirs. Islands also has Cherry Coke, how sweet is that? Super sweet, bruh. 

Big fan of all the surfing videos they show throughout the restaurant too. 

My one complaint would be the price. It's definitely on the higher side for burgers. Then again, it's a chain, you get cool ambiance, and the food is almost always great. Probably worth a few more bucks.

I wish there was a location closer to me. I have to schlep all the way to Summerlin to get my Islands fix, which sucks. I don't like Summerlin. So build another one that's closer to me, please. 

Mahalo!"}
{"text":"Their burger selection is awesome, and their unlimited fries are delicious and of course plentiful.

Their drinks are also really great. Good combination and flavors.

Good service, great prices, good place for a family to dine out.

They accommodate well to gluten free people as well!

I have been to other locations and this one is probably better."}
{"text":"The environment here is great! We had a very nice waitress named Crystal. Jack in the Box burgers are 10X better than here. But all staff was very pleasant. We rate it 3 stars for the service... not the food. We probably won't return here again."}
{"text":"I have a soft spot in my heart for Islands. In college it's where we would go for lunch after a long night out on the town and piece together said long night from everyone's memories or lack thereof. We'd get cheese fries and salads or soft taco's and stay for hours it seemed like. 
Now in my 30's and relatively settled down I wanted to go for lunch before a movie with my sweetie. Not quite the same. Different location but same college age servers and cutesy beach swag everywhere. No cheese fries for this rear end I am sporting now meant just chips and salsa (blah blah a thousand times blah) and a cobb salad. I ordered the  both the creamy vinaigrette and greek dressings on the side and both were tart as sucking on a lemon wedge. The salad itself was good except for the pound of blue cheese it contained. 
Oh Islands, I have wonderful memories of you, but I have since grown up and moved on.....Good luck."}
{"text":"The Kilauea burger is only half the reason I drive 25 from my house to come here. The other half is the bartenders Amanda Sue. In addition to the great food and ice cold beer, her excellent service and always great attitude are what really keep me coming back."}
{"text":"If you want a gourmet burger Islands is the place to go. Not only is everything there made fresh (as in no frozen patties or fries) but they have a great menu with lots of different delicious burgers to choose from.  The best part is, if you're picky, (like me), then you can change it up. Don't want beef? Get turkey. You don't want turkey? Get veggie or chicken. It's always that simple. Plus you can add island reds (thin crispy onion straws) to any burger and at this particular Islands,they pile em' high.

With all that said about the delicious burgers, I actually go for the fries. They fresh cut their potatoes in house and fry them to golden perfection served fresh. Yum!

Oh yeah, if you don't like burgers (super weird but okay) then there's lots of other things to chose from like salads, sandwiches, tacos, quesadillas, nachos, buffalo wings and more.

Also a special thumbs up to this Islands. It's  not my local (I live in Nor Cal) but I wish it were. Super friendly staff who seem to love and appreciate the place as much as me. Always a good thing."}
{"text":"Awful. Everything is way too salty and overpriced. You can get a better burger across the street at 5&Diner. Cool decor, though."}
{"text":"This place is great. The burgers were excellent. Passion fruit iced tea was awesome. I would have given 5 stars, but my french fries looked like they came from the bottom of the barrel. I would recomend this place to others."}
{"text":"Tasty food but they slashed the beer selection which makes it a lackluster bar experience."}
{"text":"The first time I came to Islands, I wondered why you ordered your burger and fries separately.  Huge portions!  Maybe order 1 basket of fries per 2 people.

Great Burgers, cooked how you like.  Not to pricey either."}
{"text":"I will never eat at this location ever again. First of all it took well over 30 min to get our nachos. When we finally got them they were room temp and the cheese wasn't even melted!!  I sent them back and got attitude from the waitress.  We came at 4:30 pm mind you so I'm not sure why it took so long in the first place . The 2nd attempt at the nachos were better but this time they didn't drain the juice from the beans and it was really soggy! Really?! Finally the rest of our meal came and the fries were cold, hard and not a lot of flavor. They tasted like they had been sitting for quite awhile. We got our bill and I was shocked to see we were being billed for the nachos. I couldn't believe they had the nerve to charge me for them when I complained about them twice! I think got up and asked to speak to the manager. The manager comes over and I explain why I felt I shouldn't have to pay for the nachos. She then begins to argue with me about the length  I had to wait for the nachos. Wait. What? Is she serious? ! Finally she says she will remove them from my bill....she leaves for a few minutes and then comes back to our table and then says to me..we are able to check ticket times and I didn't even let her finish her sentence at that point. I was shocked that she'd come back to tell me that! !! I said are you really coming back over here to argue with me about the time it took? ??  At that point I said just give me the bill since we were already making a big scene.  Why would this manager fill the need to fight me on this?  I will never be back to an Islands.  Besides that, the hamburger my friend ordered looked disgusting!  It didn't even look like fresh hamburger meat. I WILL NEVER BE BACK."}
{"text":"Burgers are huge and delicious here! The prices are completely reasonable for what you get! Me and the girls from work always come here for lunch and every time we are ordering and getting our food within 15min, leaving plenty of time to eat, chat and get back to work on time! Between the burgers, salads and sandwiches you can't go wrong with pretty much anything on the menu. If your in a hurry they do take out too! I've even brought my father who is from Seattle here and he was amazed with the food! He said he's never gotten a bigger burger for around $10! I would recommend everyone to try Islands!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went here for dinner last Friday night.  Wanting a super casual dinner this place fit the bill.  We both haven't been to the Islands since our college days when it was on Mill.  Turns out not much has changed.  This place still churns out some decent burgers at reasonable prices.  We each got a burger, shared a salad and a basket of fries.  Everything was quite good but the fries are awesome.  You really can't beat a bottomless basket of awesome fries for like $3 even-though we didn't come close to finishing it.

Aside from the fries being delicious, I like it that each of their beef burger selections can also be ordered as a turkey burger.  I didn't order my burger this way but my wife did and she said it was very good.

Another thing to note is the service.  I thought it was excellent.  Our waitress was very friendly, helpful and fast.  My diet coke refills arrived faster than I could drink them and that is a definite plus.

In my opinion this place is on top of their game in terms of service and food and is a solid burger place in my book."}
{"text":"A friend and I stopped here after a Cardinals game. We sat at the bar to watch the evening game and were promptly approached. We order our 16 ounce draft beers and I order water with no lemon, no ice and no straw. The beer came quick but I had to ask for my water from someone else almost 10 minutes later and my water had ice and a straw. We ordered our food and it was served to us quickly and exactly as we ordered it; I was able to substitute a hamburger patty for a veggie burger. We had to ask for more water (mine with ice again) and our bill because no one came to check on us for the 2 hours we were there. 
Another lady from behind the bar came over and made small talk with us about the game as we were wearing jerseys, she was the only person who spoke more than 10 words to us. She also turned the volume up on the TVs so we could hear the game. 

Ive been to the other Islands location in the Paradise Valley mall area, now closed though and never received such poor service. One of the reasons I sit at the bar is to be seen by the tender/server so I won't be neglected at a booth or table. Guess that didn't work at this place."}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time with our family on a Friday night. Despite the busy atmosphere, our service was excellent (Thanks, Michael L. !)

We were seated quickly considering the weekend dinner time crowd. The table was very clean and we were greeted quickly. 

My wife and I both went for the tacos (she had Northshore, I went wuth Yaki). Both were very tasty and filling. We topped it off with a chocolate brownie that was very good.

Overall, a very good experience and we would both recommend a return visit."}
{"text":"I found islands by mistake I did a Google search for burger joints and I'm so glad I found islands! Friendly staff and delicious food at an affordable  price. They also have good beer :) it's a nice place for a girls night out with my friends and I come here often. Can't wait to eat here again!"}
{"text":"It's been several years since I've last enjoyed Islands Burger Joint. This west Summerlin neighborhood was not saturated with 100+ restaurants in a short radius at the time.  The result now was zero wait time to be seated ona Friday not which I was pleasantly surprised.  We arrived just before the end of happy hour so I rushed the bar to take advantage of $4.69 IPA and Mai Tai. They did have other choices that were all reasonably priced. Service was quick and accommodating. 

I ran back to my table and server was waiting.  I've had the Bluenami Burger and it was delicious. This visit I went with there special the \"Hana hou\".  With grilled onions, cheese and a spicy mayo sirracha sauce.  I did enjoy the kick the burger had and they actually cook the burger to order and proper temp when I requested. The fries were a tasty natural cut with a generous portion. Someone said they were all you can eat but I did not have to have seconds.  I like that you can order wheat buns for your burgers if you choose. 

Again service in the dining room was friendly and attentive.  They anticipated our needs every moment.  I might make the trek to Islands sooner than my last visit because of the service."}
{"text":"I freakin love Islands! Burgers, fries, tacos, soup and their drinks are always great...can't think of anything that's \"bad,\" so I decided to give them 5 stars.

Personally, I always get the Big Wave (hamburger) no cheese, well done on a wheat bun. Plus you can never go wrong with their bottomless/endless fries. I always ask for some fries to start with. Food is always cooked to your liking. The tortilla soup is really good too. Very flavorful. 
For those of you who are complaining that they will not make your burgers anything less than medium, I'm sorry but if you want a bad case of e.coli or diarrhea because you are practically eating raw meat then go eat a cow right from the farm. Is that raw enough for you?! Eating such rare meat isn't healthy. Anyways.... service is always good; they always top off our drinks and get us any extra condiments or napkins in a timely manner.

It's a shame that this is the ONLY Islands in the entire city. Wish they will open up a location in Henderson or somewhere besides just in Summerlin. Born and raised in So Cal, Islands was my place back in the days. Oh...those 2005-2009 memories! Before Vegas....Bachi Burger...Gordon Ramsey...or Umami, I used to think Islands was such a special treat. Like going on a date here was \"oooh so adult.\" But even almost 10 years later, Islands still got some quality burgers. They will always have a special place in my heart."}
{"text":"Highlights include unlimited fries and cheap chips & salsa. Great place for low key drinks and a $10 burger. I was surprised to sit at the bar, Kiltlifter in hand, only to find that the most expensive thing on the menu is Buffalo Wings. You can't get a half order--it'll be 12 wings or none at all, apparently! 

3 stars for decent, cheap food and a solid, casual alternative to the crowded Yard House before a Friday night movie. This is not a place to go for a serious date night with a significant other, and you wouldn't do well to bring a first date here."}
{"text":"I can't believe this place was packed when I went. Their food tastes equivalent to bowling alley food, but it's at double the price. It's an abomination to pay this much for chicken fingers. Get 'em at Raising Canes instead. And, unlimited fries are only unlimited if they keep on coming. I wasn't impressed with anything except for the Hawaiian decorations."}
{"text":"Just Freak'n Awesome as Always!  Aside from the Great Food, the BadAss Crew makes you feel like Family! The Managers work as hard or harder then the Rest! 
We've NEVER had a bad meal or Time there!
Great Place! Check it out!!"}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of having Jordan as my waitress last week! She was so kind and accommodated to all my brother and my needs  thanks Jordan!"}
{"text":"So this is my first time here. Interviewing for a job.  Sorry but the strip isn't my thing at all. Came in for drinks and nachos. I met Heather the bartender. She was amazing and saved my entire opinion of Las Vegas. I will be coming here as a regular because of Heather. I feel like I have a new friend in a very big city. She was a great server and the food and drinks were amazing but what made the experience special was Heather and her personality and ability to make my experience a 5 star visit !  I look forward to visiting the Islands again soon and chatting with Heather!!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with my wife, daughter, & mother. The service was subpar, we saw our server once after ordering. We all ordered burgers medium and they came out medium rare, but they tasted fine. The worst were their fries. They were cold, hard, and an old batch served to us all. If your a burger joint you should be able to get fries right. The only positive was the fresh sweet potato fries my daughter had. She devoured them."}
{"text":"We had to wait about 10 minutes for a table on a Friday night after 7pm.  It would have been a 30 minute wait for an outside table which would have been preferable to us.

Went with my son and husband.  I ordered a Mangorita and enjoyed it.  My husbands Pina Colada was also very tasty.

Husband got pork tacos and was happy with them.  Son got a teriyaki burger and loved it.  I had a Hula veggie burger and it was good but I was wishing I had ordered the Teriyaki one also.  I ordered the french fries with cheese and scallions on them.  At first they tasted good but then they started to taste fishy.  (The likely fry them in the same oil?)

Great place to bring the kids.  Service is good and the ambiance is fun.  The kids meals are a great size.  My two littlest ones could easily share one meal if we bring them next time."}
{"text":"got the nachos with jalapenos. \"eeeeeeeeeeeeek! me thinks not!\" is the only way to describe it. we came in after a movie from red rock and the cheese was sliced cheese that were microwave? -_-  what happened to real nacho cheeese? also tomatoes, onions, more sour cream than cheese.. i guess we caught them at a bad time an hour before closing"}
{"text":"Ended up here after epic failure at Via Brazil. Great burger, Cold beer, Onion rings cant be beat and service was incredible."}
{"text":"Food great, service not so good. The hostess sat people first who came in after us. The waitress Laurie no personality, I felt as if she didn't want to serve us. Been going there for the past 9 years never had bad service before today."}
{"text":"Great service & the food is delicious. Every time I have gone, I've never had to wait more than five minutes fora table."}
{"text":"Absolutely love their burgers and onions rings! They make your order exactly the way you want it. The waiters and waitresses are so nice. I believe we had a waiter named Derek about a month ago. He was great. Quick on refills and made sure we didn't need anything. We always enjoy our meal here. I wouldn't change a thing about this place."}
{"text":"My family and I have been eating at Islands for several years.  It's one of our go-to places in Summerlin since it's nearby the house and they have consistently good food.

With lots of parking nearby makes it an easy place to visit.  You know the hosts and waitstaff are super-friendly when your visit starts with one of them opening and holding the door for you.  The menu doesn't seem that big, but it definitely has something for everyone:  a nice variety of burgers, fish tacos, sandwiches, soups & salads, and my favorite: the Hoisin Bowl with chicken.  There are also appetizers, a kid's menu, and even gluten-free options.  If you're in the mood for an adult beverage, be sure to look at the drinks they serve with an island flair, and the nice selection of domestic and craft beers.

The TVs are always showing surfing (or skiing) videos, adding to the Hawaiian vibe, and they get a little extra love for having outdoor seating available too.  Islands will remain a place we go regularly in the years to come."}
{"text":"It's kind of hard to make a bad burger, but this place was just a let down. The burgers were gross, the fries were freezer burned and tough and it was just a disappointing meal. We left feeling gross and slightly annoyed."}
{"text":"Stellar burger place I have been going to since the 80's in LA

It is really pleasing to me that one of the restaurants I loved as a child, is now a chain going stronger than ever.

We are beyond fortunate to have one of them here in LV.

This place has consistently served amazing food, had a great if corny atmosphere, great service at every location, this one included.

There burgers are exceptional, and huge.  The point break, bleunami, and kilauea are spectacular.

The tacos and salads are pretty good here too, as well as their famous french fries.

This is one of those relaxing places that is not probably going to win any awards, but it is a consistently awesome meal, in a really friendly comfortable setting.

They offer a happy hour every other day 4-7 with certain appetizers half price, and they are large."}
{"text":"Omg love love love this place. Tiki tenders are to die for: on top of the amazing quality! Love"}
{"text":"I had a burger with the pineapple on it was pretty good a little sweet after half of it though but that's not their fault that's my taste buds"}
{"text":"My Fiancé and I had dinner here on Valentine's Day because we figured it wouldn't be so packed. 
As soon as we walked in the hostess didn't greet us in fact she was flirting with what seem to be a customer. She finished her flirting and then sat us down. The waitress puts our menu down and asked what we wanted to drink, my fiancé ordered and Mai Tai and I ordered a 808 beer. She came back with our drinks and we ordered chips and guacamole (it's not fresh and it tasted horrible for the price) my fiancé tasted his Mai tai and he said it was way to strong but it didn't even taste like a Mai Tai at all so I tasted it and yes it was not good. I asked the waitress which took her forever to come around if she could change the Mai Tai for a margarita she rolled her eyes and changed it for us. So she came back with a margarita that literally tasted like lemonade with a splash of tequila. My fiancé just laughed and we just ordered our food. The burgers were good but the fries were stale and cold! Which I love fries! So I was pretty upset about that too. Again, waitress nowhere to be seen for a good 30 min or so. She finally came around and we asked for our bill. We noticed that the booth next to has we're complaining as well to the manager about something so we didn't feel like dealing with that so we paid our tab and left. Let's just say it was way too expensive for the quality of food we got. I'm only coming back for their chocolate volcano dessert but nothing else."}
{"text":"I have only been here once but I hope to be a regular. I own Hawaiian Experience Spa in Scottsdale and Chandler, Arizona and usually have myself immersed in Hawaiian themed activities. However, if I see something chintzy it really turns be off. In this case, however, the décor was great.

The food was also terrific. All burgers are available in both beef and ground turkey, providing a choice. Lot's of cool island drinks are also available. My only complaint is that the calories are not on the menu. I will never know how many calories I saved by going turkey!"}
{"text":"This is a great alternate to a place like Red Robin: it's super casual and fun with pretty good food. 

I usually just get your basic cheeseburger and it tastes less dried out than Red Robin. The service is great and always friendly and fast. I do love their french fries and seasoning. Had the onion rings for the first time and those were definitely a repeat order. 

Cool vibe with surfing and wakeboarding videos playing. Great for families and kids."}
{"text":"Islands is nestled in between a bunch of chain restaurants (Olive Garden, and BJ's) and craptastic restaurants (Agave) in Summerlin, across the street from the Red Rock casino. Despite it being a chain, I enjoy eating there. Although it's been over a year in between visits for me. It's hardly ever busy and the service has always been fast, friendly, and attentive. The burgers are actually pretty good, but still a step below gourmet burger places like Burger Bar, BLT, and LBS. The Hawaiian burger is delicious -- both savory and sweet from the juicy beef patty, the grilled pineapple and teriyaki sauce. Their fries are cut fresh and are large and crispy. At around $8 a burger it isn't cheap, but they have a good variety of burgers to choose from (and their tacos aren't bad either)."}
{"text":"Solid burger, go there for lunch and the prices are a bargain. Best thing about Islands is that one can leave satisfied but not feeling soaked in grease."}
{"text":"Four of us ate there tonight.  Hubby had  China Coast salad, half portion, which is what he usually gets because he likes it so much.  I had the fish tacos, because they do the best fish tacos of anywhere I've been.  I always get them on flour tortillas because corn tortillas turn to mush no matter who fixes them.  Daughter and son-in-law had burgers and they raved about them--one had the Kilauea and the other had the Hawaiian.  Great service.  Prompt.  I have eaten at this Islands many times over the past 7 or 8 years, and have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"nice happy hour at the bar with my husband!
enjoy this casual hawaiian theme place.
i like to come get a strawberry Daiquiri (ask for extra strawberries), buffalo wings are the bomb with a little kick of spicyness (you can ask for flap only) the ranch is very creamy and light (by the way ranch is never light )
mini sliders are very tasty! the meat is tender and juicy!
happy hour runs till 7pm weekday.
on Tuesdays it's sport at the bar :)
for single ladies... i have seen couple gentlemen enjoying a beer at the bar alone"}
{"text":"the rincon burger and the hawaiian burger are delicious. The fries are good also. I'm excited about this place making it back to our rotation. A few years ago we had to drop it since it cooked all their fries with peanut oil. (food allergies) Just found out they now use vegetable oil now. Great burgers and fries. Mmm suddenly i'm thinking of a juicy succulent burger."}
{"text":"Burgers were outstanding, salads were great, nice atmosphere we loved the surfing on TVs everything was great except for the French fries, they were not very good. Short little pieces that seemed hollow and cold when you bit into them.  We will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Had to hit up this Islands when I was in the area.  The former Islands on Mill Avenue in Tempe is sorely missed.  Islands still has great burgers and fries; the only thing that prevented a five-star rating was the price.  A little bit steep.  But, delicious."}
{"text":"This is our default place to eat.  Food is great and the service is very good.  We've been to this restaurant so many times, we've both memorized the menu and are familiar with alot of the staff.  The place is busy but not so busy you can't find a seat.  Food always comes out hot and flavorful.  If you get a chance, I highly recommend you try it."}
{"text":"Nothing like the California Islands. Worst service ever. The chili cheese fries were soggy and looked and tasted like they had been sitting in grease all day before being thrown into the broiler to heat them up...and had been saved all day to be disguised under chili. 20 min later I was finally able to say something to the server when she came back. No I don't want more. I waited another 20 for my 5 chicken tenders. Not to mention the iced tea was water."}
{"text":"I have not been to this place in a few years.  I keep promising my son that I will take him here.  Last Friday he called me up begging, so I said yes.

I ordered him the kid's burger and me a burger with guacamole.  He looked at his burger then mine and decided that he wanted my hamburger instead of his own.  So I settled for the kid's burger.  I must say it was a good burger.

The atmosphere is loud and chaotic, so a five year old is going to love it.  Most of the clientele are adults with children.  I have an issue with a dedicated bar in an establishment like this one.  I feel it is simply wrong to be pounding shots on one side of the restaurant while the table thirty feet away is celebrating a fourth birthday with cake, Elmo and a bunch of unruly kids.

The food is good and plentiful.  The hamburger comes with unlimited French fries.  We went through three orders alongside free salad.

Islands offers an affordable meal that is family friendly with great service.

Go and have fun now...........!"}
{"text":"I love this place! The food was good, drinks kept coming and the best part of my experience??? Tracy of server....She is amazing! We didn't realize we came too late and it was almost closing time but she made us feel like we could stay all night :-) She treated us great, kept on top of our drinks, checking how we are and she kept asking my daughter how she was doing :-) I love when servers care enough to pay attention to names and actually use the names. Lily got a big kick every time Tracy asked \"how are you doing Lily?\" This means a lot to even 2 year olds :-) So, Thank you Tracy for being awesome :-) I wish we can clone servers like you and send them out in droves to the restaurants here in Vegas :-)"}
{"text":"The food was good, not fantastic. Our server Tyson was very personable, checked on our table frequently. Bartenders were not engaging with the clients. Did not offer information about drinks besides $1 off margaritas did not tell me about different margaritas etc."}
{"text":"A bit of So Cal in the desert. They have done a really nice job with keeping the quality up. We luv the cheddar fries passion fruit iced tea. Also like the Bleunami, taking Tacos, Hawaiian, the soup. 

The kids grew up here and it is always nice to get w taste of home."}
{"text":"Came here last weekend.

I ordered the Veggie tacos and he ordered the mushroom burger. The Veggie Tacos were good, but they were pretty bland, but I guess that's expected of a fully veggie taco. It also came with a side of coleslaw that I didnt touch at all, so I can't really comment on that. My boyfriend got the mushroom burger and that was delicious and huge! It was just bursting with flavor and juices, mmmm, so good! I would totally get this over and over again. I definitely recommend this to anyone coming here for the first time. It came with lots of fries too. They were crispy and good. We both shared our food with each other so we'd be able to taste everything. After trying my taco I told him to eat his share of the taco first then continue with his burger since the taco didn't have any flavor at all really. 

The service was great and we got our food very quickly. No complaints. I'll be coming here again."}
{"text":"We love islands. GABBY IS AWESOME! She is very attentive. We have not been there in awhile. Other places closer. But we  walk in GABBY remembers us, remembers where we work , remembers what we ordered the last time..which was months ago. This Lady will definitely have us coming back often. Oh .food not so bad either. Very people friendly."}
{"text":"Came today with the whole family and from the service to the appetizer it was a disaster.  We left and even had to go up and ask to get our check then we left and high tailed it to the Yard House.  Ashley was the server and she was either way to busy or just didn't care. Fries greasy and customer service poor. You can tell when management isn't there.  Where were ya' Christian?  Last time I came in it was fixed to be good because you were there and we had good service - not the case today. Pass if you want good food and customer service.  I left out that when we went up to get our check Ashley was texting when we had to continue to wave across the bar just to get our check..... Hmmmmmm"}
{"text":"Cute place with island theme. Pretty good TV set up for watching sports.  Had a margarita special which was good.  Good waitstaff.  Owner checked on us.  Looked like great burger selection.  We were watching NBA western conference so we had spinach dip and nachos.  Nachos were huge, we added roasted chicken which I recommend.  Good wine and beer offerings too and outside seating if you like to sit outside with misters."}
{"text":"The menu choices, food preparation & quality, ambiance, cleanliness, and
personnel are OUTSTANDING!

NEVER have we had a poor experience with this restaurant & team members!

Shout out to our server Elizabeth, who provided 5 STAR service!"}
{"text":"For a chain restaurant, always an easy choice for a burger and fries.
Did I mention .....All you can eat fries?

They have a lot of great combos, or you can build your own.
Always tasty! 

The ONE thing I do not like, is you cannot order a burger cooked less than Med.
I find the idea that \"they tell you\" how you like your meat cooked a bit annoying, although they will happily tell you it is for your own protections and I assume for their legal protection? -Still. Annoying And in my book, their Med is Medium Well.

With that said, if you like a well done burger, with lots of super tasty options, all you can eat fries, at a decent price....this is the place for you!

If you are really craving an amazing hamburger,  and it is truly about the hamburger, there are better places to go. If you are shopping or heading to a movie, and just want to grab a quick burger. This place is perfect."}
{"text":"Good food, nothing super delicious that makes me have cravings. I haven't been here in a long time, as in when the fries didn't come with the burgers (you had to order them as a side item). However, now they do come with them and are still endless, but I did notice the burger prices went up to allow for the burgers to now come with fries...something that is always expected at any burger joint. They do have sweet potato fries that you can order, big plus. 

Service has always been great, they are really quick with getting drink orders in and served to you. I've ordered a bunch of items from salads to fish tacos, and of course, their burgers. Everything has tasted decent and I'm not really sure what qualifies as having \"Fine Burgers\" in a restaurant title, but I don't think Islands has it. The restaurant itself is very clean and the bathrooms are well kept. The only downside is the acoustics in this place. It can get very loud when its busy and almost annoyingly loud when there are a few kids in the joint."}
{"text":"If you like burgers and near Desert Ridge you need to stop by this joint.  Cool atmosphere and great service.  The location is perfect,  munch out on burgers and fries and take a walk."}
{"text":"It was my turn to treat to dinner tonight and we were in the neighborhood. This place did not disappoint me or my company. Passionfruit Iced Tea was absolutely delicious, and our burgers (the Malibu and the Longboarder) were cooked perfectly and tasted fabulous. Our waitress was prompt, polite, and upbeat and very knowledgeable about the menu and its options. Those tablets they have to work with really made things very smooth. When we wanted another Iced Tea our waitress had it brought out within seconds (that's not an exaggeration, our waitress had walked to the table behind us and as soon as she turned towards them someone came out with another iced tea for us, it went through that fast). That's top quality service! Those work so much better than those bulky table tablets you see at Chili's or Olive Garden. The only ding I have to bring up is that the burgers were good but extremely messy. I lost half the lettuce on my sandwich due to it falling apart a little and there was too many onions on my burger too. It almost look like they had taken a full slice of onion and put it there instead of just a couple outer rings like other do, so I had to take off a lot of those, but that's not a big deal. There was plenty of lettuce left on my burger even after a lot of it had fallen away. It was a good dinner altogether and the next time I'm over in this part of town I'll stop in again!"}
{"text":"This is my first review on YELP because I was so impressed with out service today! We always loved the food but today our cousin was in town. He's in the Army and was in his fatigues. At the end of our lunch our waitress thanked him for his service and said his lunch was on Islands today. Way to go Islands!!! We all need to support local businesses like them that appreciate our armed forces!"}
{"text":"Great burger, taco, salad, nacho place.  I love the decor, feel like I am in Hawaii.  Quick service and the Strawberry Lemonade is yummy.

Seems no matter when I go, I never have to wait, but they are packed.

I love the burger slections, something for anyone."}
{"text":"They have the best chicken wings and french fries on the Westside. My husband and I have been regulars there for the last five years, we keep going back because the food is consistently delicious not to mention we've had nothing but the best service."}
{"text":"We dined at Islands yesterday for a late lunch. Our server, I believe her name was Amy, did a great job. If the review was just based on experience with her it would be much different. The chicken tenders were good, but not stellar and our grilled chicken sandwich was mediocre at best. Our french fries...... the worst I've ever had at a restaurant. They were stale and hard. We mentioned this to our server and she got us a new order. Unfortunately it seemed as though the new ones were from the same batch, but re-dropped in the fryer to make them seem new. We were thoroughly disappointed by this and most likely will not return."}
{"text":"I love this place! Vibes are always super chill. Burgs are the best in town. They always have good drink specials. I've tried many things on the menu and loved everyone of them. Waiters and waitresses are always chill. If you go in, ask for Billy he's the best waiter in there!"}
{"text":"Hats off to my friends at the Desert Ridge Islands, outstanding service as always!! Thank you again for another phenomenal experience, food was perfect and service was flawless. Kenny the manager is top shelf and Marco was our waiter and took excellent care of us! Thank you for representing your company well and for showing us your talented hospitality tonight for my birthday! Much applause and I'll see ya soon!"}
{"text":"We actually tried Islands because (truth be told) there was too long of a wait at Yard House but I'm glad we tried it. The staff was incredibly friendly and even the manager came over to say hello and see how the food was (nice touch which was appreciated). I don't eat meat so I got the veggie burger and it was very tasty- not bland, soggy, or overly salty like some other veggie burgers.  The margarita was very tasty (not too sweet or tangy, just perfect). 

The service wasn't only friendly but it was fast and we were able to get to our movie with plenty of time after dinner. 

We sat in the bar area and got a table right away on a Saturday night (probably around 7). There is also a patio section and inside restaurant so there are plenty of options. This is a great place for dinner before a movie or to grab a bite after shopping."}
{"text":"I have always like the food at Islands! I will continue to like their food, but man! Just getting to expensive! I know we enjoy food, and our pictures prove that. But eighty dollars for dinner! 
1st the food! -
I ordered the Rincon burger, this was probably the best burger I have ever had! Comes with guacamole, smoke apple wood bacon, lettuce, tomato! First time I had it, won't be my last! the bad thing about it was. My wife took half of it, because she liked it so much!! Wife had the chili burger, it was good since I had her half. Daughter enjoyed her salad. again, overall we really enjoyed the food. But wish a burger a fries wouldn't cost over $10.00."}
{"text":"The burgers are sub-par. The service is questionable and is mixed. The thing that bothers me the most is their dishonesty. We called in to see about waiting times and capacity. They said there were lots of seats and no waiting time. We even told them to make sure and they insisted! When we came, the place was full and had a waiting time! I don't support any kind of dishonesty in any profession/work area. Hence the 1 star. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Mehhhhhh this place.... It was 35 dollars for two burgers and a Coke. Burgers were not great. They were big but lacked flavor. My Kilauea burger tasted only of pepper. I couldn't taste anything else. Fries were fine. The ranch dressing was our favorite thing here..... Waitresses were attentive though."}
{"text":"We haven't been to and Islands since living in San Diego, it was always good.  Saw there was one in Vegas and decided to give them a try again.   

Seated right away so that was good I guess.  Not really greeted at the door but it's whatever.  Waitress came right away and got our drinks so that was a good start.

Kid had burger and apples.  Burger was fine but apple should have been trimmed, lots of brown spots in the middle.  Wife had a burger, which she enjoyed however the fries were tasteless and not seasoned at all.  According to the menu and pictures there should have been something on them.  I had the Northshore Tacos... the best thing about them were the beans.  Lettuce had some brown spots, so it wasn't fresh.  Cheese was non-existent and overall the tacos were bland.  I honestly had better tacos in a military galley and they feed you for about $2.  For something that was about $12, I left hungry and disappointed.  I was bummed about it because I do remember them being good.

2 stars because it was clean, had I based it just on food... 1 star.

I won't return.  Poor food and the value just wasn't there.  Just can't recommend Islands."}
{"text":"Fast, friendly, service.  Great food.  I haven't been here in a while, but recently started going again.  Great service at the bar from Amy today.  I was in a bit of a foul mood that somehow vanished as soon as she welcomed me.  The food is very good for a burger joint (with vegan options- but I admittedly cheated with some o-rings today), but the friendly service was a great reminder as to why I need to keep coming back.  Thanks, Amy!"}
{"text":"I'll bet you didn't know commercially farmed turkeys are incapable of reproduction. Did you.
It's true. 
Turkeys can't breed anymore. 
So how is it there are so many turkeys? This is so weird. 

Turkey farmers actually employ people to masturbate the Tom's, so they can artificially inseminate the hens. 
This is so creepy, it makes me never want to eat turkey again. Especially when you consider how turkeys ALSO eat their own shit. 

However....
I have a cholesterol problem, and  have now found myself in the unenviable position of being on red-meat lockdown. 
Shit. 

Shit indeed my friend. 
Turkey it shall be. 
And no-one makes turkey burgers like these guys.
Order one Kilauea style. 
You'll be pleasantly surprised at how delicious it is, despite your now knowing that what you're eating is the fruit of someone's labor... whose job it was to sit around jacking turkeys all day long.

The thought of eating turkey repulses me.
But I temper my repulse with the realization that the more turkey I consume, the more turkey-jacker-jobs I've just helped to create.

And that makes me happy.

Important note:
Our server informed us he was knocking two bucks off the bill. When I asked why, he offered no reason, saying \" We just wanted to discount your meal today.\"
I think he overheard me talking about Yelp every time he wandered close by."}
{"text":"This place has a rather tacky interior complete with large parrots, the theme is Island I guess...all they need now are Hula girls.  I got the wings for an appetizer and was pleasantly surprised. They have a good amount of spice on them and are incredibly tender. There is nothing like juicy meaty wings with lots of sauce! There just aren't enough of them. I got a burger with American cheese and lettuce. It was decent, I should have opted for the white bun instead of the wheat which made it awkward tasting. The special seasoning they have on the table really added something to it, not sure what. I was suppose to get onion rings but they brought fries. The fries are unremarkable. The onion rings are a good size and a good crunch, but there is no flavor really to them. I shouldn't have to add salt and their special seasoning to everything. Wings were the highlight and I wish I took a photo of them"}
{"text":"I was really disappointed coming here. I went to the one in Long Beach recently and it was awesome so I figured I'd go to the one near my house. My boyfriend got the Hawaiian and let me have a bite - his was awesome. Mine? The big wave? There was probably a gallon of mustard on it. I took the first bite and was so overwhelmed it's literally all I could taste. I scraped the mustard off and bite two was also pretty disappointing since apparently they hid the flavor of the actual burger with mustard. It was DRY with a gross mealy tomato. I ate forcibly ate half of the burger and then when I started on the second half I took one bite and spit it back into the napkin, it was THAT dry. Terribly unevenly cooked.
Fries were good, though. Service was great, the staff was friendly.
Maybe I'll try again but it was horribly disappointing especially since it was so slow - I can't imagine how the food is on a busy night."}
{"text":"Bleh.  

Our service was pretty bad...food took forever to come out, waiter got our drinks wrong and was overall unattentive.  

Once the food finally arrived it was decent but nothing to write home about.  I had the cobb salad and my friend had the chicken sandwhich, both pretty average, although portions were big.  

Note that you have to order sides like fries seperate--which annoys me.  Cheesy decorations...blah blah blah"}
{"text":"We ate here in June. While it was great, it was nothing that would make me jump off the freeway and stop if I saw it and was hungry. I'd compair it to a glorified Fudruckers with a Hawaiian twist. I know we had a few issues, nothing I can remember--- but enough that well over a month later I remember that it wasn't smooth sailing. :) Give them a try, you might find heaven in there. Who knows."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a drink and to catch game three of the VGKs playoff.  Service was awful.  Food was OK.  No drink refills.  Left to watch the end of game at home.  Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Service was top notch from the hostess to our server and how fast we received our food.  Food average but experience is worth going back.  It's hard to find great service these days."}
{"text":"You know, at first I was a little skeptical to go to another burger joint.. But after we got in there, our waitress( I forgot your name, sorry blonde lady!!) was very good and she was awesome at what she did! I recommend this place, the food was very good if you like burgers, will be coming back for sure."}
{"text":"Where's the Beach

I really enjoy the atmosphere at Island Restaurant.  The decor makes you feel as if you just strolled in off the beach.  In addition, to the relaxing atmosphere, the food at Island Restaurant is really good and of high quality.  

One of my favorites is the Maui Burger.  The Maui burger is absolutely  delicious. In fact, all the burger at Island Restaurant are delicious, large, and loaded with your favorite toppings.  

Even the children's portions are large at Island Restaurant.  My nelhew enjoys the mini slider, cheeseburger and hot dog with seasoned  island fries.

Island Restaurant is a fun place to take the family out to eat.  The prices are reasonable, the service is great, and the food is delicious."}
{"text":"The service and food was good. We were out shopping at hobby lobby and the sign caught our eyes. It was really enjoyable"}
{"text":"This is one awesome place. The manager of the pkace Kenny, actually came to our table and made a good impression. The Veggie burgers are unbeatable undoudtedly. I havent found a good place so far for the Veggie burgers. This is not my first time visitng this place and wont be last time. Keep up the good cooking and i will visit every chance i get."}
{"text":"Just stopped by for lunch while shopping and thrilled we did, what a great find. Service was good, it was clean, drinks were good, and the food was great. 
The mojito was delicious, fresh and clean. I got the Hawaiian Burger, very well cooked and nicely seasoned. The French fries were very good. Nice relaxed atmosphere and enjoyable place for lunch. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Perfect family restaurant! I had my dad and little brother recently come out to Las Vegas to visit. After a long day of shopping at the Downtown Summerlin Mall I wanted to actually try something different and dine at something outside of the food options that they provide there.

You know how you have those places that you always drive past that you say to yourself I'm going to eat there one day? But continue to procrastinate? Yeah umm Islands was exactly that place! So glad I finally tried them out because my family and I had a fantastic time here and really enjoyed the food! Our server was amazing and so helpful with my stepmothers gluten free diet. It's difficult sometimes eating with people who have allergies to certain foods so having a server be understanding and accommodating was appreciated! 

This place is of course known for the burgers so I went for one of the spicy ones! The Sriracha Smack burger was my choice of the night followed by a side of  chili cheese fries! My dad and younger brother said they really enjoyed the \"Pipeline\" burger which is basically a chili cheese burger! My other younger brother ordered the grilled fish tacos and gave two thumbs up and lastly my stepmothers gluten free concoctions came out just how she liked. Can you say a happy and full family?! Thanks Islands! We shall return!"}
{"text":"We just ate here.  The service by Kate and staff was awesome, loved the Hana hou special burger.  We are here for spring training and American Airlines lost our luggage throwing our trip into a tailspin.  Kate cared about us and took care of us including a free dessert, too!  Great place!"}
{"text":"In fairness to Islands, I'm not a burger fanatic.  I didn't even want a burger necessarily, but since Islands was the closest thing to a vacation I might see this year, and they are known for their fine burgers, this is where we ended up.

We started with chips and salsa.  \"Started with..\" There lies my problem.  Why do I always have to \"start with\" something.  Why not \"start with\" my entree like a normal person.  I digress, I'm having a fat day.

The chips were a little over browned, but it's just a chip right?  The guacamole was actually pretty good, however.  I went with the Big Wave cheeseburger.  I love that the bun was toasted, but it was on the greasy side.  Other than that, no complaints, was actually quite a good burger.  The fries (thick cut-skin on) were not very good, however.  They were hot, but didn't seem fresh.  We did have great service though.

Islands is quite a distance from me, so I think I would save the gas money and fly to Hawaii instead.  Funny how that was almost true not too long ago.  But if you're at Desert Ridge, it's worth the stop."}
{"text":"We've been there several times. It seems the last couple of times not so good. Went recently and for some reason they didn't put our table's appetizer in as an appetizer. When it took longer than it should, we asked and was told they didn't know we wanted it as an appetizer and the whole order was entered together. Well the appetizer did come out first, but apparently the other food sat because it wasn't even hot and the French fries were cold and hard. We were going to say something but the waitress never came back during the whole meal. After we finished we sat with our dishes still on the table. Got the bill , paid and still tipped but dishes were still piled up on the table when we left, and they really weren't busy. Will go elsewhere."}
{"text":"0verall the food was decent. Service was fair. I wouldn't say it knocked my socks off but it was a good burger. We enjoyed the plaza more than anything. We sat on the patio. Enjoyed the experience."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came in due to the previous reviews found on here and the close distance to my house.  The food was great! We had chips and salsa while we waited for our food.  You are able to substitute any of their burgers with either a turkey burger or a veggie patty--this is awesome since not every place offers this! We ordered off their lunch specials: I had the Big Wave w/ cheese (subbed with a turkey burger) and he ordered the Shorebird. Their food was delish and I loved their fries. I added mushrooms to the turkey burger and it was amaze!"}
{"text":"Ok, I really like this spot.  First, I think they must have the frostiest beers in Las Vegas.   They come out so cold that a thin layer of ice forms on the top and along the sides of the mug.  Big kudos.  The food is consistently good, especially their tacos.  I had the chicken tacos with teriyaki sauce and pineapple in them.  Very tasty indeed.  The only obstacle to a perfect 5 stars would be the overall ambiance.   Maybe I'm being picky but the place often feels a little dead.  Don't let that dissuade you though, try the food and have a cold one!"}
{"text":"Walked over here after a crappy experience/walk out from claim jumpers. Heidi our server was great. Food great. Quick and friendly service.
Only critique- a bit less ice with your margaritas. Nobody likes an expensive watered down beverage.
Will come back"}
{"text":"Sooooooo YUMMY! ordered the Maui burger and substituted it for the veggie burger. This will not be my last time here!"}
{"text":"Nothing impressive about the food. It all appeared to be frozen not fresh. The spicy mayo just seemed to be pink mayo, maybe a dash of hot sauce in it. Service was good but that's about it."}
{"text":"Came in with the family on 3/30/12, Fri evening.  Boyfriend ordered their $10 plus cobb salad with Blue cheese dressing on the side.  After he poured the dressing on the salad and tasted it, he realized it wasn't blue cheese (tasted like rancid ranch) so we sent it back.  The manager brought back the new salad and asked again what happened to the first and after repeating it, he actually didn't say much about it.  Now we realize the new $10+ salad didn't have any chicken on it so we told our waitress when she finally got around to checking on us.  She chuckled at the fact that the manager didn't catch this oversight.  The manager finally comes around with a cup of cubed chicken (don't know why it took as long as it did when the chicken, I'm sure, is pre-cooked and premeasured) and before he places it down on the table, he gives the salad a once over, as if to make sure that it, in fact, didn't have any chicken in it.  Meanwhile, the rest of us are done with our dinner.

I worked at this location some 15+ years ago as a bartender and server.  Back then, if a customer didn't like what they ordered and ESPECIALLY if the order came out with something wrong with it, we were trained to happily replace the meal AND comp it.  NOT ANYMORE.  NO comped drinks, no offer of free dessert and more importantly, not even an apology!

Wow, has this place gone downhill.  There are plenty of other places with better food, better prices and most certainly better customer service for us to ever return to this establishment.  

Take your dining out dollars somewhere else!"}
{"text":"It's my first time here and I will definitely be back!  We were greeted nicely and promptly by the manager and we decided to sit in the bar.  The bartender was attentive however I believe it was only her working in the bar area which was extremely busy for Monday night football.  The manager was helping out with the trivia and even came up to us as she overheard it was our first time there.  

We got the wings & nachos for happy hour which were good.  For entree's I got the Mahi Mahi sandwich.  The fries were unique however they were small.  The fish was fantastic however the slaw on the sandwich wasn't that great.  My friend got the veggie burger which she liked however she said it's not the best she's ever had.  The other person got the Mavericks burger which he enjoyed.

They have a great happy hour and a very welcoming comfortable environment.  Unfortunately I live in Henderson so it is a bit out of the way!  

A great find and I highly recommend it for Summerlin locals!"}
{"text":"Tasty fresh burgers, bottomless fries, substitute turkey meat at no extra cost, kids eat free on tuesdays, and friendly service.  What's not to like???

I think it's better than most restaurant chains.  It's actually one of the few chains we dine at.  Burgers are good.  Tacos are pretty good too.  My wife likes their tortilla soup.

Vegas off-the-strip is filled with restaurant chains and Island's is one of the better ones."}
{"text":"Islands burgers is great. They were able to accommodation a large party on their patio. The server was patient and fast. I had 2 drinks and onion rings. The onion rings were tasty and hot. Also, I had a chocolate lava dessert which was too much for one person but it was good. I also had to share the onion rings. My friends said they loved their food as well. I will definitely be going back to try a burger."}
{"text":"Time to edit my first review of Island's....The first time I was here we had a not so good experience. However, the company reached out and wanted to improve and boy did they.

The same group of 9 of us went out with 5 kids under 5 years old and four adults, and we had no issues. We were able to sit in a corner booth, which we actually kind of need for all of us. Our food came out quickly and everything tasted delicious.

The best part about it was the service and our server. He recognized that the kids were getting hungry and a little out of control. He brought them extra crayons, and was able to get their food and drinks out first. 

Island's made a huge come back in my book and showed that they truly are a, \"family restaurant\" and suits the needs of everyone. It just a cool place to grab a burger and hang out."}
{"text":"Nice, clean place.  The people are friendly.  The parking situation is very tight.  I recommend taking a little walk and parking behind the restaurant.

The Hula Burger isn't bad at all - Mushroom and swiss on your patty.  The fries are now endless! 

On our last visit, waitress was very sparse and left us desiring more.

My wife never brings back food, but she did here.  She had the baja soft tacos (Flour tortillas, fajita-marinated chicken w/ grilled onions and bell peppers).  It just didn't taste right.  Instead, she ordered the safe bet - another hula burger.  

They rushed her order for the hula burger and everything was fine afterwards.  The manager also came by to make sure every was fine as well and was very apologetic and friendly.

Overall, I would give this place another try sometime."}
{"text":"Crazy average food, small menu. Nothing seems to be a draw here, probably be out of business or sold to another chain soon.  One item to note as far as cleanliness...two guys sat next to us and put their barefooted toddler on the table who was wearing a diaper. They decided after a short time to leave without ordering.  The hostess simply straightened out the table for the next guests.  Didn't wipe it off at all so that was disgusting enough to not come back"}
{"text":"Service was a 5! The food was awful! 1star! Fries where over cooked. The bun was hard! They literally put a whole onion on my burger! I should have just went to Red Robin!!!! But wanted to try something new. Don't waste your money at this restaurant it's not good!"}
{"text":"I had been leery of trying this place, because it never seemed busy when I would go to Olive Garden or BJ's next door to it.  However, a friend of mine talked me into getting lunch there and I hate I didn't try it earlier.  I loved the decor and the beach type atmosphere.  They even had surfing on most of the TV sets throughout the establishment.  The staff was very friendly and quick to serve us.  The restaurant was very clean.  I ordered the Tucson, which is a Teriyaki Grilled Chicken sandwich with pineapple, Swiss Cheese and tomatoes (it also had lettuce & mayo, which I had them hold).  And it was most excellent.  My friend had one of the burgers, and it looked sensational, and he said it was.  My one complaint is that the fries were not good at all.  They either were fried and refried or they were fried and just sitting around too long.  I was not a fan of those, and will probably ask if they have another side order next time I go there.  But, I cannot wait to go back there again."}
{"text":"Since moving to AZ from So Cal, it was nice to see a familiar face in the desert. Was out in Avondale picking an item up and I noticed Islands across the way. I could use a Hula burger STAT!!

I was seated within minutes. I sat at the bar area. I ordered my drink and food because I order the same thing every time no matter what: Hula on wheat no tomato. Fruit Punch. DONE!

Breanna was my server and she was awesome. Brought drinks out without me asking which is a plus in my book. Fod same out HOT and tasted just like I remembered. EXCELLENT!!!

Super good burgers. Great atmosphere. Thats why I love this place. I will for sure be returning because there is no location near me in East Mesa...HINT HINT hahahaaa"}
{"text":"Tasty lava cake with ice cream and whipped cream! Good service. Looking forward to coming back when they have happy hour. They have happy hour while sports games are playing. 
I will also would like to come on a Tuesday to try their mai tai drink special for $5."}
{"text":"Food here is beyond exceptional. I come here as often as possible. Long boarder burger FTW. I recommend this spot."}
{"text":"Corporate food thats not half bad.

Second time we have been here, the burgers are very good as are the fries.  The fish taco is very stodgy as its like a heavy english style fish-in-chip fish portion that sits on a bland corporate corn tortilla.....not a favorite choice of mine.

The service was excellent and its not a bad place at all.  Great stop after the movies!"}
{"text":"The food is very good, the price is cheap and the service is great!! I really love \"Nacho\" and \"Fries\" !"}
{"text":"amazing customer service. Good drinks. Good food. The sliders are good I would recommend the fries. 
The happy hour is from 4-7 
Shout out to the bartender."}
{"text":"It's been years since we have been able to go to Islands - moved to the boondocks.....Always loved Islands in So Cal but this one is quite a disappointment. Food was barely warm and flavorless. What happened?  Won't go back ever."}
{"text":"After a five-month Hiatus my daughter and I decided to give and another shot. We were seated immediately the service was good and the food was cooked correctly. The staff was friendly and prompt. The verdict is still out if this will become a frequent dining spot for us"}
{"text":"I ordered the Kiluaea with no onions, no bun and coleslaw.  Our server Brandon wrote all 5 of our orders down and went to enter them.  

However, when my food came out it was wrong.  There was no bun as requested but it was piled HIGH with the red onions and I did not get any of the spicy aoli that comes wjth the burger.  I picked all of the onions off and then proceeded to try to eat the coleslaw which also had a ton of red onions in it.  As a server he should have offered up the information that there are red onions in the coleslaw since the item isn't described on the menu.  He was good at refilling our drinks but was very slow with bringing us our checks and as a result we were late getting back to work.

So, I paid $16 for something that I was only able to eat half of and I was late coming back to work.  Super disappointed and I will not be back!"}
{"text":"Typical chain burger joint.  Our waitress was going through the motions, but with a smile.  Our food came out correct and quickly.

Food was decent, but nothing that sent me home to call my mom about.  The cheese fries need more cheese for sure.  The slaw was pretty unique however.  I did enjoy that!! Overall fair. Don't hate / don't love..."}
{"text":"Nice place for a burger and a drink.  Fun atmosphere, for either a fun date or to take the whole family.  Excellent lemonade."}
{"text":"I went to Islands this past weekend looking for a Turkey Burger...and man they did not disappoint. They substitute all of there beef burgers with Turkey burgers if you like...and man i was so happy to hear that because i don't eat red meat. They have 12 burger selections along with various other items...but the burgers are what you should go for when coming to Islands. I had the \"Big Wave\" burger with Cheese...it also comes with Lettuce, Tomato, Onions, Pickles, and Mustard. It is a huge burger..and it comes with fries for about 9 bucks. When i want a great Turkey burger now...i head straight to Islands Burgers...please go pay them a visit."}
{"text":"Really good food, I got the Hawaiian style Island taco's. We had good service and the food was delicious. Plus they had fun menus for our kids to color and good choices for their food. I really liked the idea of this restaurant and it for the most part is a friendly environment for families. Check it out if you want to get out of the typical downtown restaurants and see something else for a change."}
{"text":"Great burgers and great service.  Love the Hawaiian burger with fresh onions rings."}
{"text":"Great hamburgers and great service. Love this place. You must try the Hawaiian burger with fresh onion rings. It's the best!"}
{"text":"Love this place! It feels cozy an Intimate and the decor is so fun! The food is amazing and always creative and flavorful! It's been a favorite for years! Always love the vibe!"}
{"text":"Been hunting Las Vegas for good margaritas for a few weeks, finally wondered into Island fine burgers and drinks in Summerlin. The sunset margaritas are amazing.! Super friendly staff sat there and watched my beloved Seahawks. Will be back repeatedly..."}
{"text":"So I havent been to this place since we were planning our wedding over 10 years ago. We actually went to a different one since this wasn't here. Now 10 years later this one is open and near our home so we decided to check it out again and this time share it with our kids. I remember this place being a lot better than it was unfortunately...The food was not very well priced for what you get and honestly other burger places have better food and a heck of a lot more options. They hardly have any decent beers on tap unless you want bud or bud light and stuff like that. The service was good enough and fast enough. But Meh. I've experienced much better and for a better price at other burger restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying, although Desert Ridge is a shopping and dining destination, it is difficult to find consistent food and good service.  Wife and I live in the area and while shopping we decided to go somewhere we haven't been in awhile.  I had the fish tacos and the wifey had wings, both were great and would go back for them.  Ambiance is what you would expect beachy, tropical feel, with plenty of TV's and perfect volume on the music.  The only issue I have is why drop a check after you ask if we would like to \"try\" dessert? I'm thinking,yea, I'm a dessert guy but we said, no, thank you.  We were both mid meal when the question was asked.  Oh, we noticed the whole area was gone by the time we paid and it was nearly 4:00.  Two words, Shift Change!  We paid and ordered another beverage because we weren't going to be pressured to leave."}
{"text":"My friends and I came in tonight and had the best service! Our waiter Sully was extremely friendly and an excellent judge in a coloring contest between my friends and I. Also, shoutout to Nathan for being a super efficient and fast-paced busboy. Extremely helpful. 10/10 would recommend to all!"}
{"text":"Went to lunch yesterday. It was okay. The burger was seasoned and done appropriately. However, the fries were stale and minimal. The ice tea was watered down and the server would come to the table and literally be watching the TV or something else and not really impressive. Not even sure of her name she was just kind of vacant. I don't expect a lot from people just a full drink and maybe a smile but she was just kind of flat."}
{"text":"Great food and Sheena was wonderful
I recommend this place for lunch fast and friendly"}
{"text":"I am super impressed with this location. Very nice restaurant- clean, friendly service, prompt and great food. Not sure of all the choices around here, but I would definitely come to this place again! Probably the best chicken sandwich I've had in quite a while. I had the CA Flyer. Yum!"}
{"text":"It's a chain, but cool environment nonetheless. I really dig the theme and look.

Our server was very kind and accommodating. My wife and I arrived during happy hour, and we were thrilled at the amount of food we got for a very reasonable price. The Hawaiian sliders were good, and the onion straws on the side were a nice touch. 

We'll definitely be returning."}
{"text":"I used to frequent this place so much when I still lived in SoCal. The food and drinks are still as good as ever. It seems that this location gets a bad rep but me thinks the people who hate on these burgers are the same ones that think Steak and Shake are bomb. FOH. :')"}
{"text":"Stopped by for a Saturday lunch and the place was not very busy. My father and I both ordered the Longboarder burger and we both enjoyed it. The burger was well seasoned, cooked perfectly, and the bun was just right. The fries that came with the burger were very good. They were slightly crisp and went well with a side of ranch. Our waitress was okay and could have had a little more personality but did everything a waitress should do. Overall, we left satisfied and I would go again for the quality burger. If I had decide between Islands or Red Robin, Islands is the choice."}
{"text":"I came here at around 6:15pm and I was seated with my boyfriend. It was pretty busy that night, so I knew the service would be slow. We sat down and waited for about 10 min and didn't even get any drink orders in. We then saw a few people around us getting seated AND getting their drink orders in before us. My boyfriend and I looked at each other and said, we would wait another 5 minutes before we just walk out. 
The server took a check from the next table and stopped, looked at us and walked away. First, train your staff to at least acknowledge that someone will be right with you. If someone had told us that, we would have waited, but to look at us and walk away and never come back?! If you hate your job so much or you can't do it right, go find another job that better suits your incompetence.
I'm already hangry at this moment and so we walked out. The customer service was horrible and I will never come back here just for that. Should have got up and left when we saw everyone getting served but us."}
{"text":"I usually look forward to islands but have not had a good experience with their takeout. Today I ordered the large soup which is \"endless\" when you dine in but the bowl they put it in for takeout was only half full. When I brought it up to the waitress she said, \"that's the large soup.\" I would have let  that go but then I get home and find that they also had not put the avocado in it. Obviously their staff is sloppy and does not put time or care into their work. Considering I paid $8 for a half full bowl of mostly broth, I am very disappointed."}
{"text":"Not bad - the portions are huge, but its standard big chain burger place fare.  Think Red Robin with a Hawaiian theme.  Service was good - our waiter was like clockwork with the refills.  Good thing too - I wasn't a fan of the onion rings, they were bland and made me feel really thirsty.  Probably sucked down 3 iced teas before I gave up trying to choke them down."}
{"text":"My family and I stopped in today to have lunch after my daughter's tae kwon do tournament. I had a cheeseburger, my wife and daughter shared chicken and fries. The food was great and the service was even better. We drove in from las Vegas for this tournament.  45 minutes out of town we noticed our daughter had left her very expensive IPad Pro at the restaurant. After a quick call, long drive, and alot of tears my daughter had her IPad back in her hands. Kudos to the staff and management. I feel that type of honesty is a rarity these days."}
{"text":"Menu is mostly burgers. They have the option of switching to a turkey or veggie patty. My burger was under cooked. Ordered it medium well. It was barely medium. Have $5 mai tai's on Tuesday. Wasn't impressed with the food. However, wife really enjoyed her burger."}
{"text":"terrible ..we've had chicken burgers and every time they are not cooked right.  The fries are dry to the bone and tasted old.  We complained and they offered to have us back so we went back on our own, not seeking a free meal.  Same disappointing meal.  Won't be back. Plus the service took forever and are not attentive."}
{"text":"I've been going to Islands every year for my birthday for the past 7 years. It's my favorite place to get a drink (I enjoy the rusty anchor) and a burger. Great vibes inside and the staff is super awesome. I absolutely love Islands and will continue going back every birthday! :)"}
{"text":"Mediocre food.

I havent visited aince I last came which was about 3 years ago."}
{"text":"This place is solid. Great place for a burger, the fries haven't changed since I first went there in high school. I have always been a fan of their veggie burger. Go for the Big Wave burger and you cannot go wrong. The hubs favors the yaki tacos. They do serve Kraft mac & cheese for the kids which is always a bonus in my book. 

During football season, they have happy hour all day!"}
{"text":"Another example of a restaurant that thinks too much of itself - high prices, low service and marginal food. What more can be said."}
{"text":"My waitress was extremely nice and understanding. Although I ordered the China Coast salad and asked for no chicken since I'm a vegan and substitute avocado. My salad came out with chicken and Avocado. Since I do not believe in wasting a sacrificed animal I told them I would take a to go container for the chicken to feed my dogs. When my bill came out they had charged me for the dish plus avocado!!!! I will not be back to this restaurant nor should anyone with dietary restrictions."}
{"text":"The most amazing burgers in town!! Love the Kilauea and Maui!! Tacos are just fine.. Nothing great.. But overall amazing place.. Awesome food.. Good beers.. Great music and lovely people all around.."}
{"text":"Great food and great service.  Chris was awesome. The Mai Tai drink makes me feel like I'm in Hawaii."}
{"text":"I stopped in in May when I was going to buy spices down the street.  Haven't been to an Islands in a while.  Had a very good blue cheese burger.  The service was good.  I got there right after opening time so the place was almost empty to start and only got about 1/3 full by the time I left."}
{"text":"I have to say if you're ever in Vegas or live in Vegas and you haven't ate at Islands then your missing out. Great for family get together. And the staff, super nice. I went with the family for the 4th of July weekend and had a great time!"}
{"text":"We haven't been here in a few year. My family used to like this place. So one evening we decided to go back in and give it try. Service was great. But the food was not so good. Our burgers were over and although we all ordered medium they had a variety of colors, from pink to grayish brown. The fries were super dry. The texture was weird. And the ranch was just so watered down it didn't stick to anything you dipped into. The spinach is the dip must have not been drained bc it was neon green and drizzly. All that being said We won't return."}
{"text":"Haven't been to this location in a few years, though I did check one out in Phoenix last year and really dug it. For starters, they no longer have the slushy lime coke drink. Frowny face!

The quality of their burgers isn't so great. The Bluenami used to be amazing, but something was entirely off about it this time - too much blue cheese dressing, not enough crumbles, maybe? The meat wasn't so great either, tasting pretty bland and as if it had been waiting for a while after being cooked. Don't let nostalgia trick you, this place has gone downhill."}
{"text":"I got the chicken burger today, it is pretty good.  Grilled, juicy, and cooked just right.  The fries are always hot and crispy.  The wait for the food took a little longer than normal, but I know they are very busy.  

Bummer our service this time was a totally miss.  At first she was great, check came took our drink order and food at the same time (we were ready).  She checked on us after our food arrived and we ever saw her again until the bill.  We both were so thirsty, NO REFILLS.  She offered us later that she can bring our refills in a to go cup.  That is great, but I would have liked a drink with my food instead of choking it down."}
{"text":"This place is one of our favorites! We love their endless fries.  My husband always orders the Kilauea which is a jalapeno & black pepper crusted burger with pepper jack cheese, and island reds (thin sliced fried onions).  I usually get the Hawaiian which is a burger with pineapple, teriyaki sauce & Swiss cheese.  We have never been disappointed in any of their food.  They have several TVs so you can watch the game, or NASCAR race while you eat your food. They have surfing on TV too.  Great place to hang ten!! :-)"}
{"text":"Located in the Desert Ridge mall, this is a great casual place to go with friends and family. The four us each got burgers because that's what they do best. The wait was longer than usual but we were out on the patio so we watched people walk by. Our server was very attentive and checked on us several times during dinner. She offered to refill our drinks and even apologized for the wait.

Burgers were great, served hot and everything tasted freshly made. The atmosphere was casual but outside, we didn't experience the noise of the tvs and music that were all inside. I'd come here again and will try something other than burgers next time."}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant over the weekend. Ordered a turkey Malibu style burger with onion rings and a side of ranch dipping sauce.

Toppings on the burger were delicious and the white bun was just right. They turkey party itself was nothing to brag about and a little dry and lacked real taste - thank goodness for toppings! The onion rings were one of the best I've had with the onions just right and a very light coating. The ranch dressing was good, but definitely too runny for dipping and was certainly aiming for my shirt the whole time.

My partner ordered a Hawaiian burger on brown with the chicken breast option (the burger I am told was delicious)and sweet potato fries. I tried the sweet potato fries, and they were not very impressive - ok but certainly not the best (get the onion rings if you go). 

Service was ok and about average wait speed.

I don't usually comment on bathrooms, but these were in great need of a good clean up, paper every where and floors definitely need a deep clean. Lights were dimmed, making it tough to navigate and can only imagine how much more dirty it would look. I will spare you the photo on this one."}
{"text":"Sad they closed down the one at Paradise Valley Mall area but I get it, this one is just a couple miles north. 
LOVE ISLANDS! BEST BURGER - Hawaiian, best fries anywhere and best ranch. Lol they cut their fries fresh everyday, make their own salsa and marinate their own chicken. They also make their own ranch. Delicious ! Yum yum yum. Can't get a better burger anywhere else. Juicy flavorful and the bun (whole wheat) is divine."}
{"text":"Great casual Friday night dinner with Hubbie. Sheena gave us great service. Island Fish tacos a big hit!"}
{"text":"A-Ok is a perfect rating for Islands in my book. I am not a huge fan of burger joints so take that into consideration. We had a school fundraiser and it was a nice environment for a family dinner. I like the fact that it was busy, you could feel the life. I love that atmosphere. It was cold however, but I guess it's time for me to get used to Arizonians creating artificial winters in every closed space. 

I had Longboard burger and it was good. Nothing special, but not bad at all. My other half had veggie hula burger and says it was pretty tasty for vegetarian option in burger joint (go figure). Service was good, but little overzealous with drink refills, to the point where we had to stop her to return some drinks. I understand the endless refills are sales point, but this was ridiculous. Who can drink 4 lemonades in 30 min?!

I might be back if there is another specific reason or if it is the closest options. Otherwise, definitely won't lose sleep over going there again"}
{"text":"Sooooo bad.  We waited so long at our table for a server to take our order that my mom went to mcdonalds to get her granddaughter a hamburger."}
{"text":"I've been going here for as long as I can remember ! (There used to be more locations but it's worth the drive) Their north shore tacos are some of the most delicious tacos ever! I take my family when they come into town, I go with my husband (who is vegetarian) and he is able to get his favourite burger with a veggie patty which he says is the best veggie patty he's ever had. The passion tea is amazing I always have to get a Togo cup, there lunch specials are good prices and always good food, the feel of the restaurant is so fun (surfboard tables and all the extreme sports you can handle on all the TVs surrounding the restaurant) and I have never been disappointed with the customer service there."}
{"text":"I recently tried the fish tacos and it's a big fat NO Way in my book. I think they would have been ok had the fish not been burnt. The fish had burnt grill marks that seemed harmless but the fish was apparently charred down deep so it really tasted burnt. I tried 2 bites and that was enough to send shock waves throughout my system. Besides the 2 bites the meal was boxed up for Mikey ( you know the commercial of the Life cereal kid who would eat anything) . Well my Mikey tried the fish tacos the next day and agreed that the fish was burnt. So I paid a hefty sum for two bites of food. The only thing I can recommend at Islands is the burger and fries. Otherwise everything else that I have tried has not been good. So if your group only wants a burger and fries then ok go there but if you have a varied group of people who want a varied menu that all tastes good then find another restaurant."}
{"text":"Very friendly upbeat service  Food is fresh, very tasty. My all time favorite is the Maui burger"}
{"text":"So far service is good, but its dead slow in here only reason it gets 4/5 is because of the odor/smell inside...it smells funky! The shake mango strawberry is pretty amazing."}
{"text":"Food was mediocre. My husband had a Big Wave burger. The waitress asked him how he wanted it cooked. She told us \"medium\" was pink all the way through. I'm not sure what kitchen calls pink all the way through medium but that should have been my first clue this place wasn't going to perform. Well, when the burger came out is was well done. If you are going to ask how we want our burger cooked then deliver on it or don't ask. I had the beach bowl. It was okay but I feel like for $10 at lunch there should have been something a bit more memorable about it. Nothing remarkable about the food or the service. The positive, the beer was cold and drinkable. I doubt we will be back. The service was poor, when combined with the food it leads me to say we won't be back. Waitress took 10 minutes to check on us after we were sat then she slide the bill across the table as she walked by. No \"can I take your empty plates, how was your meal?\"  Nothing and the restaurant was not busy when we dined. Overall, very disappointing experience."}
{"text":"Things change. Last time we were there it seemed the restaurant was experiencing Maryvale spillover. People at the table next to us were letting their kid dance on the table. The restaurant didn't look clean inside. The atmosphere was decidedly un-wholesome."}
{"text":"Food was okay, nothing spectacular to brag home too. Service was good and staff were attentive to our tables needs. On the plus side, they do have a gluten free menu."}
{"text":"Super place for lunch.  Used Yelp to decide to go here and you did not let us down.."}
{"text":"So...after many more visits here I had to update.

The service here is always fantastic...but my main reason. The tortilla soup....seriously....

Their tortilla soup is killer here, not you grandma from Mexico made it good but a whole different kind of good. They also have an all you can eat option for a little over 7 bucks hat rocks when its cold and you're starving.

So the burgers might be so so...but the soup is why I come back."}
{"text":"We're from SoCal, so we were ecstatic to find out there was an Islands in our new home state of Nevada.

This place has excellent service and the food tasted great.

The Hawaiian burger is one of the best and the Baja tacos are amazing!

FYI: You can seat yourself nearly immediately if you are willing to sit in the bar area."}
{"text":"Burger was just OK, service was good, salad & dressing were nasty! Way too expensive for average food. I'd rather get a bistro salad at Trader Joe's for $4!"}
{"text":"This was my first time. I had a burger and beer on happy hour and it was pretty tasty. I just didn't enjoy the feeling of being rushed out of the resistant although they had an hour before close. 
That sucked but everything was alright."}
{"text":"The food was awful, but the service was fantastic!  The service is the only reason it's getting 2 stars.  My husband had one of the burgers and he said that it taste like a frozen burger patty.  I had the Kobb salad...It just wasn't good.  We did have the nacho app...Half the cheese wasn't melted, and if you wanted any beans or meat on it, it was extra.  Over all the nachos weren't bad--only because they were part of the half price apps during happy hour.  It was pretty crowded--I literally think my pony tail was touching the girls pony behind me, and there were a lot of kids.  I would say, don't wast your time/money here."}
{"text":"Great burgers and beers! Always et great service when I am there. I also thinks that for the food pricing is reasonable"}
{"text":"We come to islands every time we are at Desert Ridge, 3 or 4 times a month we eat here. We absolutely love there service, food, and atmosphere. Everyone is so wonderful! LOVE the hamburgers , and the chips and salsa are to die for especially the guacamole. we have tried all the food and no complaints! we are sad about the pv island, they need to open more."}
{"text":"Had the Maui Burger and fries. Meal was sub par. Burgers are low quality, low taste, very thin. Fries are hard, stale, nothing to them. Over priced and no quality."}
{"text":"Great ambience and good service... Food is disappointing.

As someone with serious gluten sensitivity, I rely on protein-friendly menus. Most restaurants are good about this and offer protein wraps (lettuce wrapped around your meat like a bun). This is usually easy and safe.

Unfortunately, Island isn't up with the times. When i expressed my gluten sensitivity, I asked for a lettuce wrap and a side salad with no croutons rather than fries. I received a paper thin patty with the heel end of iceberg lettuce on the top and a side salad loaded with croutons. Under the iceberg lettuce was the tiniest patty I've ever seen... It was more like a mini slider so definitely not filling. My husband had a regular burger and his party was the same. His burger was all bread and he said his fries were tasteless. I expressed this to the server who just said \"sorry\" and walked away.

The prices are high for such meager amounts. I was really surprised. Their website resembles nothing of what you really get. Quite disheartening. 

Needless to say, this is probably a great place to hang out and grab a beer and watch the game but not a place we will return."}
{"text":"Been eating at Islands for years.  I LOVE the Northshore!!!! Atmosphere is great.  Best cheesy fries ever!!!!"}
{"text":"Saw the good reviews and was ready to change it up some since we didn't want to drive to Fuddrucker's but wanted to try these burgers. I like the decor and service was ok, no issues there and they did ask how we wanted the burgers cooked. We order the standard cheeseburger that appeared to be 1/2 pound and perfectly symmetrical in it's round shape which we figure these are frozen and they tasted like it.  The bun was just plain bun, pretty boring and tasteless however it was toasted on the flat top. I'm sure they have better plates on the menu but not sure if we'll come back, just missing the wow factor"}
{"text":"Visited this location and they were out of the veggie burgers. If you're going to have an item for a meat alternative please have them available. The service was slow, the food was cold. Asked for hotter salsa, they only have one. Disappointed when we come from the Arrowhead area."}
{"text":"I love their fish tacos. We just finished a great meal at a reasonable price. The service by Sheena was on point. We will be back."}
{"text":"Burgers were good and the service was fine.  For whatever reason it sort of reminded me of Outback Steakhouse--only a Hawaiian version.  The cheese fries are very similar."}
{"text":"Whenever I feel too land-locked and forget what the ocean looks like, I head off to Islands.  Maybe it has something to do with the freaky-tiki kind of decor, or the surf videos that play constantly.  I Like It Here.  Yes, it is a chain.  Yes, it is smack in the middle of the Desert Ridge Marketplace.  No, I don't care.

Islands restaurants are everywhere in So Cal, and they are all consistently good for a casual meal.  I was happy to see that there is a location in Desert Ridge - nice and close to me!  The service is friendly and attentive - you aren't left panting for a drink refill.  My faves are the North Shore tacos and the Sandpiper chicken breast sandwich.  If you are in the mood for some bad for you goodness, definitely try the cheddar fries.  A plate laden with their fresh-cut fries just covered with cheddar cheese and chives.  Served with ranch dressing, it is artery-hardening perfection.  Who needs a fork!?  Just use your fingers!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped for a quick bite to eat.  My \"medium\" Maui Burger was overcooked not once but twice...which is not a big deal.  The bartender and manager really went the extra mile to take care of us!  Not only did they comp the burger from our bill, but gave us an Islands gift card to go back another time with.  - I have never experienced such a generous make-up for a couple of small kitchen errors. - We will definitely go back because the staff made such a valiant effort to make it right. 

Now if only they'd make their burgers big again....but that's a different review :)"}
{"text":"We were very impressed with the decor, service and burgers here. The fries (unlimited) are as good if not better then McDonald's which says a lot! Be sure to try their secret spice on everything you eat. My mouth is watering just thinking about it. They have indoor seating and outdoor seating. Near the AMC theater."}
{"text":"I was at islands restaurant the other day. It has been sometime since I dined there but when I ordered my favorite burger the big wave. I saw that they had switch their buns from seeded buns to pretzel buns. In my opinion that was the worst change they could have ever made! It will be some Time before I go back to Islands restaurant. I don't understand why corporate make changes to things I don't need to be changed is beyond me!"}
{"text":"Being new to the area, we've been excited to try Islands and we weren't disappointed. First of all, the Hawaiian sliders are one of the best things I've ever eaten- how can you go wrong with grilled pineapple and teriyaki sauce?!? We ordered the teriyaki bowl and one of their burgers for dinner. The bowl was amazing- fresh veggies and fruit, chicken, brown rice, and hoisin fish sauce...so yummy! Sadly, the burger was undercooked which made it unappetizing, but we tried the most cooked quarter and it was pretty good. Chris, the bartender, offered to remove the burger from our order, without us asking or expecting him to do so, which was awesome! He also gave us a heads up that happy hour was about to end so we could get another round of tasty tropical drinks, if we wanted to. His exemplary customer service made this a 5 star review, regardless of the undercooked burger. We will be back to try their salads, fish tacos and a few other menu items that looked delicious as well!"}
{"text":"I stopped here tonight with a neighbor for dinner after seeing her husband at rehab.  We each had a Chicken Club Wrap.  I had mine with fries and Geri had hers with a salad.  They allow substitutes for the fries.  If you get fries, they have \"endless fries.\"  You can keep getting another portion by asking.  Since the wrap and the fries I did get were sufficient, I didn't ask for more.  Our server did ask if I wanted more fries.

Service was prompt, the ambience was OK, and I enjoyed this first visit to Islands.  It's simply one more option for a quick meal in the Summerlin area."}
{"text":"it's not expensive, but also just ok. the atmosphere is pretty neat inside. i got the burger with bbq sauce and while the toppings were good, the burger itself was thin and didn''t taste like a good beef patty. the bun and french fries was also meh. the service while friendly seemed a little rushed."}
{"text":"When it comes to burgers, this place is one of my favorites. I like the island beach vibe they feature and the burgers are done to my specifications.  Only thing that I wish they had was a bigger patio with more beach themed atmosphere like palm umbrellas etc.."}
{"text":"I am visiting from near Chicago and met my friend at the Islands restaurant at Desert Ridge. I have not been here in over 7 years and asked the waitress for a dish that I used to order. She had no idea what i was talking about and brought over the manager, Christian and he explained that his chef Videl had been there for 17 years and remembered the dish. So he made it for me again, special, just for me! It was totally awesome and brought back memories, wonderful memories that I had with my friend. Thank you thank you, thank you Christian Dinsmore for making my visit with my friend incredible."}
{"text":"I went back here a few days ago and the service has improved greatly! The food was terrific as usual!"}
{"text":"Service was great. The food was good. I had the Kaluea (however you spell it). I expected it to be spicy as described. But I had to add Mexican hot sauce to give it some kick. Cabernet was awesome!!  Overall it was good and I would go back"}
{"text":"Our first time here.  Service was excellent!  Tacos were amazing!  My husbands sliders were a bit over cooked, but he still managed to get them down..haha!  Will definitely come here again!"}
{"text":"Good fries and that's about it. One hamburger was ordered with a white bun but came with wheat. The server was slow on refilling drinks and although they advertise endless fries it seemed like we had to wait endlessly for them. Create's burgers far surpass Islands in every aspect! Won't be back here..."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped by here on a whim one day. When I walked in the place my expectations of the place lowered, as the Californian-pacific islands-surfer-theme mixed with what looked like a remodeled dive bar just didn't sit well with me.

That said, the burger I had was great, but my jack and coke was watered down. The price was in range of what you'd expect, and while I wouldn't go back, if you just want a burger and are in this area it's ok."}
{"text":"Wanted to try a new place so we went in on Saturday night. Service was good and the food is not bad, but over $12 for a hamburger. I had the the Malibu burger with onion rings the burger was good not great I would not recommend the onion rings."}
{"text":"The fries were a let down this time. The first basket I ordered was warm but the fries were super crunchy to the point it hurt my teeth. I requested a replacement basket and my server kindly got me some new fries. Sadly the fries yet again were inconsistently very hard/crunchy mixed with perfectly crispy. Bummer because I was craving them! 
The nachos were perfect and the single serving size fudge brownie was amazingly good, although I wish the brownie was warmed up hotter. 
Service was great but the food could have been fresher."}
{"text":"Very disappointed, the food was tasteless and bland.  It looks good to the eye, very well but together  but very disappointed when I bit into my chipotle burger.  I think the cook accident dropped the container of pepper on the meat patty as it was overly covered in a thick layer of pepper.  My boyfriend had their mushroom cheeseburger and he is one to enjoy any meal he is not a picky eater and his burger was just as bland, he didn't finish it.  This was our first time here and unfortunately our last.  I gave a 2 star because our server was attentive and helpful."}
{"text":"Good happy hour deals on food and drinks. Sat in the bar area and Chris took great care of us. No complaints on service, very friendly staff. However, food is super bland. Like ridiculously bland. Left super disappointed because we were in a burger mood and the food was just nothing special at all. Probably won't be back, and warning to anyone else to probably just skip this choice when there are a ton of better choices in the area."}
{"text":"Unfortunately I wasn't impressed!  Our server was in a hurry, she'd zoom by and rushed us to place our order. As first timers she didn't offer any suggestions. Also I must mention they had one of the worst Mai Tai's I've ever had, extremely watered down and bitter. The burgers were mediocre, nothing special. I updated my review and gave them 2 stars instead of 1, because I appreciate the staff reading the review and contacting me to apologize for our experience."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time on a trip to San Diego and immediately checked to see if there was one here in Vegas. We enjoyed our meal so much and we've been back multiple times since then."}
{"text":"Great burger spot in Desert Ridge; prices are the same for lunch and dinner. It does become quite packed during the dinner rush. Here are some family favorites:
- Hula Burger: very juicy when ordered at medium, generous helping of mushrooms (although slightly too salty), pairs well with the swiss & tomato. try it on the wheat bun!
- Kona Pie: actually not too sweet & you can get it on the house for your birthday when you sign up for their email club
The fries are pretty decent and taste kind of like In-N-Out's fries but more thicker cut."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, clean and in a nice, safe location.   The staff was super friendly and attentive.  We had hot wings and one of their many gourmet burgers.  Everything was hot and delicious.  The prices were really fair as you get alot of food.  Will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Found this place by chance and was pleasantly surprised.  The helpful waitress guided me to a great turkey burger (with bacon, of course,) and hand cut fries.  Relaxed atmosphere, I'll come back again."}
{"text":"The food was good but this place gets a 2 star because our waitress Heather. She rushed us and my kids were not ever done eating and she took their plates then took mine. She came to the table 3 times to tell us have a nice day. Just overall very unprofessional and that can kill someone's day especially when I wanted to come back.

I called and spoke to a manager and she apologized and is going to take care of that situation. 

Now the food
I got the chicken wrap and it was delicious. I recommend putting the ranch and BBQ sauce on it it made it ten times better  
My kids got half of a sandcastle and the other got a hamburger and my littlest one ate everything and he doesn't normally do that so that says something about the food. Also get the strawberry lemonade it was refreshing"}
{"text":"Wave Burger was delicious! Sweet Potato fries were nice and crisp! Service was pretty prompt too and the out door seating was nice as well."}
{"text":"I enjoy the quality control that Islands has. Any time I've order for myself or my dad we've never had a problem with our food. It's a bit more expensive than the fast food but not by much. The quality however is far superior."}
{"text":"We go to Islands regularly. It is a nice family place where our whole group (with several picky eaters) can get something they like. The prices are reasonable and the serving size is ample. 

It is also a good place to take kids. They like the atmosphere, kid friendly food, and they can be kids without bothering other diners."}
{"text":"Yes, Islands is a chain, but they do a good burger. A damn fine one.

Since my health kick started about 1.5 mos ago, I'm avoiding a lot of red meat, so I opted for a Turkey Lite Burger w/side of steamed veggies. It was a little painful as I watched my friend eat her cheeseburger w/avocado and bacon, but it was victorious.

The turkey patty was refreshingly moist and seasoned beautifully! The whole-wheat bun was not too dry either (I was worried). Steamed veggies had no salt/butter and just a tad crunchy - just how I like them!

Our server did A LOT of check-ins w/us. Very attentive."}
{"text":"I've been to Islands two times, so I am pretty confident giving a 3 star rating.

I appreciate the ambiance of this location. They have televisions readily visible for customers to watch island-ish videos such as surfing. Additionally, they have cool island decoration such as carved wooden paddles.

I am very pleased with the cleanliness of this restaurant, which, if judged alone, would receive 5 stars.

During my most recent visit, the waiter was amazing! Very friendly, comfortable, and knew how to joke around in a way that enabled my friends and me to relax a little more. 5 Stars for her!

I'm a pretty simple guy when it comes to food, so both visits I ordered hamburgers. They both had good flavor, but in my opinion they aren't anything spectacular. However, I think the hamburgers are better than those from Chili's and Red Robin's. I would have been more pleased if they didn't cost between 8 and 9 dollars.

In the end, the price is the determining factor that drops my rating to 3 stars. I'm a full-time college student who doesn't work. If the burgers were about 6 dollars, I'd bump it to 4 stars."}
{"text":"I don't frequently post reviews but we had such a good experience at Islands a couple of weeks ago that I made a note to make sure to review the restaurant.   My husband and I ate at Islands about a month ago for the first time- we sat in the bar which was pretty quiet for a Saturday night and had delicious drinks and burgers.  So yummy!  A week or two later we decided to try it with our kids (3 and 6) in tow.   We hadn't seen the kids menu so didn't know what to expect but it was great.  Our kids LOVED the grilled cheese sandwiches and we appreciated that they have two different sized meal options for the kids- the half \"Sandcastle\" (grilled cheese) was perfect for our daughter and our son gobbled up the regular Sandcastle.   We also loved that they have many options for sides for the kids to choose from besides french fries.

Our waitress (wish I'd caught her name!) was great- when we ordered apple juice for the kids she asked if we wanted it cut with water- something we do at home but have never been offered at a restaurant unless we ask.

I had my favorite drink- the Mahaka.    After I ordered a second one the waitress came over with the bartender- apparently they were out of one of the ingredients and so the bartender suggested some alternatives I might like.  It really impressed us that she came over with suggestions.   

All in all, we love Islands.  The burgers are delicious, the kids menu is great, and the service is top-notch!  We'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"I've somehow been here twice in the past week. 

The first time was on a Saturday night at 6, so of course they were busy. We had to wait 10 minutes which wasnt a big deal at all. However once seated service got reallllly slow. Food took a while to come out. Though it was good. 

Last night I ended up here with the Hubs. So a Wednesday night at about 630. We got seated right away. It wasnt busy in the slightest, yet somehow the food took even LONGER to come out. So so slow. But it was good. So there is that. 

So if you go be prepared to wait forever, for tasty food. Maybe take a snack?"}
{"text":"I should have went to RR. I do not do burger joints all the time maybe couple times a month. 

Service. She was ok a 3.5 out of 5. It was 6.00 and she took 06 minutes to even greet me to take drink order. Then came back with drink and left again. I was ready to order but she was not ready to take it yet I guess. She came back a few minutes later. 
She did a few more odd things. Her name started with a B I don't think she ever told me her name but it was on receipt. 

Food. Burger 3 out of 5. The patty is really thin like wendys fast food thin. The fries were mediocre at best. They were kinda tough. The milk shake was a 5 out of 5 so there is that. 

Overall I won't be back. There are better burger joints out there."}
{"text":"Gabriel was great and our food was great. It is the same as every other Islands Restaurant, so there isn't much to review on. We always go to the Islands and we always enjoy it. The drinks were good."}
{"text":"Good burgers, beef and chicken. Yummy fries too. Kona Pie for dessert, definitely shareable."}
{"text":"Our sever Amanda was amazing!!!

My fiancé and I visited Islands Restaurant on July 4th around 6:30 pm. We arrived just in time for happy hour. Happy hour is from 3pm - 7pm at the bar and on the patio area only. There is plenty of seating in both areas, but we opted out of happy hour and got a booth.

I love the theme of the restaurant because it goes with the name. The restaurant is island themed and items on the menu are as well. All the burgers on the menu seemed delicious so it took me a while to order. While we were looking over the menu our waitress Amanda offered great drink selections as well as food. Of course I had yelp to help me decide, but it is always good to have a server recommend their favorites. 

I ordered a strawberry pina colada and the Hula burger. The hula burger has yummy sautéed mushrooms, lettuce, tomato, swiss cheese, and mayo. I added bacon on my burger with a side of cheese fires, and it was all delicious. My fiancé ordered the burger with the crispy onions, ( I can't recall the name of it) and enjoyed every bite of it. I also like how you are able to substitute the fires for other side options.

This restaurant is located directly behind Olive Garden and BJ's Restaurant, and across the street from Red Rock Casino & Resort."}
{"text":"The place still has that new car smell, which is nice because I do not know when it opened. Its clean so at least your feel good about the food. Service was great, and atmosphere was good as well. plenty of tvs and etc.

Food was par. I think it was too expensive. A burger that should of cost 6 dollars they are selling for 10.95. I certainly did not leave the joint feeling like I had a 11 dollar burger. 

Glad I went and tried, but Ill never go again. The \"Longboarder Burger\" is just a rip off of the In-N-Out burger, which I would of rather had. Would of saved a lot of money."}
{"text":"I love this place. Every couple months I make the trek from DT Phoenix. Today I had the Bleunami. Yum yum double yum. I'm feeling like a stuffed potato. Could be the pile of French fries I ate. Service was great as always. Our waiter kept the good strong coffee coming and gave us a cup to go. Had to head back to work or would have enjoyed an ice cold brew. I enjoyed watching a neighbor table with the ice sliding down the side of their pint of beer."}
{"text":"I like Island's.  I believe the burgers will surprise you.  The server had about five tables, but she was still very friendly and attentive.  I would stay clear of the Guacamole myself.  For me it's too mashed.  I had the mushroom and Swiss burger which I believe is the Hula.  I wasn't expecting much, but when I bit into it.  I was pretty pleased on the quality.  This place is great for a quick bite if you don't wanna wait around or deal with mega crowds.  I'm not too crazy about the beer selection, but the burger is good."}
{"text":"I'm from Fort Worth, Texas, so I guess a lot of the let down was the portion size of the chips and salsa and guacamole. It was in a bowl the size of a cup that you would get at McDonald's to get ketchup. I had a frozen margarita with salt, and it was just ok. The fried fish in the Island fish tacos was awesome, the tortilla... not so much. We mainly went to watch the Astros A's game on one of their many tvs. The only thing was there was no sound. I wouldn't go here again. Also, the waiter was obviously suggesting higher priced items on the drink menu and appetizers, and that got annoying. Try it if you want, but you're not missing out."}
{"text":"Took my wife here for her first time. Amazing burgers. Great happy hour. Service was awesome. Gabby the bartender is awesome. Definitely will return."}
{"text":"We really like this tropical themed place with good prices and booth seating- we've been here a few times. (We've also tried the one @ Ala Moana too BTW.) Always has very nice servers and hosts- smiling faces. 

My husband always gets a burger- now comes with fresh cut fries. I think he gets the Hawaiian- pineapple, teriyaki sauce, lettuce, tomato, onion, & swiss cheese. I've had the Kilauea- jalapeno, black pepper, pepper jack cheese, chipotle, lettuce, & tomato- tasty for the person who likes a little spice, like me. I've also had the sandpiper- grilled chicken breast, sautéed mushrooms, swiss, lettuce, tomato & mayo- I always scrape it off because every place puts too much of it. Otherwise, very gratifying eats. 

Also on the menu are: chicken sandwiches, tuna sandwich, wraps, soft tacos, salads and soups. For those of you watching your waist line, the  \"Paradise Bikini Beach\" menu- kinda like Applebee's lighter menu, listing the total calorie count. 

The last time we were here (around summer), there were a couple of senior ladies across from us, who kept staring at us and our food- they even tried to make conversation, \"Ooh, is it goooood?\" But my annoyed husband, who hates when people stare at his food, opened up a menu and placed it standing up, so they couldn't look at us anymore- I think they got the hint. They were pretty chatty and talked to several other people in passing. Other than that, we enjoyed our meal here.

Overall a great place for burgers. It's fairly popular with people of all ages and a good crowd is always here for lunch (the only time we're here). And then afterward we walk around in some of the stores in the area."}
{"text":"I remember the first time that I ever ate at an Island burger, it's like eating at Joe's Crab Shack for the first time... You look at the decor and see how crafty they get. For instance, the table is shaped just like a surf board! 

Anyway, I have the Kilauea every time I go here, it's my fav. I guess I just have a thing for food with jalapenos! But I usually ask for them on the side, although I love the flavor they give, I just can't seem to handle the heat :(

This location is in Summerlin so for the most part, the service is what you would expect in this area-- friendly, smiling faces! 

FYI, parking can be a PAIN. It shares a parking lot with with Olive garden, Agave and on the weekends, you can probably add BJ's to the list. Arrive early or expect a wait. I swear, sometimes... Las Vegas and the way they design their streets, parking lots and high areas of traffic-- total failure."}
{"text":"Good, not great. I thought the prices were a little on the higher end without the food matching. I got no problem dropping some cash on some good food, it's what makes life enjoyable. I just felt that the $9 burger tasted like it should be a $5 burger. I agree with Margaret L. - it's still better food than Applebee's."}
{"text":"A-OK. Yep. That describes this place to a T.

If you have read my previous reviews you are aware of my disdain for chain restaurants. But Islands isn't bad. Not bad at all.

I used to always order their veggie soft tacos, which sadly isn't on the menu anymore. But no worries, have ordered several of their specialty burgers subbing a veggie patty.

My carnivore hubby has no issues with their burgers either. They always cook them the way he requests.

French fries are delish, hot, and plentiful. I always throw on extra of the special seasoning they have on the table.

They have a variety of tropical libations but I avoid these pricey sugar bombs and order the tropical iced tea. It's not like me to order something non alcoholic but I really love their iced tea. Seriously.

I find their environment a bit annoying, contrived, and cheesy. Fake plants everywhere, surfing on the television. Loud island shirts on the staff. *eye roll*

All in all a solid burger place."}
{"text":"I don't really eat red meat outside of the family farm, so is it really fair to critique a burger joint when I didn't try a burger? Screw you, here's my review anyways. 

Bf was craving a big burger and he figures I'm from the islands, might as well take me back. What islands this joint mimics, I'm not sure. But I don't think its the Hawaiian islands. Maybe the Florida Keys. The place is decorated like a Jimmy Buffet song. It pretty gross. 

The service was friendly enough. Our waitress was attentive and polite. They're located right next to Palo Verde High School so at around 2p, a bunch or under-aged waitstaff waltzes in. Yes, young waitress snatch. 

Bf normally tries the wings where ever he goes. Its his barometer of overall quality. My barometer would be the fries. More on that later. The wings were $9 for a basket. I said the basket better be pretty big and made of gold for $9 and change. The wings were standard buffalo wings with that buttery, vinegary orange glaze, served with ranch and carrot and celery sticks. On his second wing, he bit into a cool spot. Quality control much? 

The menu items are hokey \"island\"ish names like the Hula burger, the Kilauea burger, the Hawaiian ... The Maui burger comes with quacamole. Um ... is Mexico an island now? 

They also have a Kaanapali [sic. Should be Ka'anapali, with okina] Kobb, a cobb salad. There was absolutely nothing Hawaiian about it. 

I ordered a Hula burger on wheat, like a mushroom swiss + extra charge for avocado ($8 + 1). My favorite thing about this place is that they'll substitute any beef patty with a veggie patty, free of charge. They also sub chicken breast burgers for +$1. 

Bf ordered a Kilauea burger ($8). He wanted his burger rare, but our waitress told us they don't go less than medium. Hold the phone. Why is this? It takes less effort to cook a burger rare. Because you cook it less. So why in Zeus' name can't they cook it less? We didn't make a big deal, beyond the Zeus speech and he just got it medium. 

When I looked at his burger, I couldn't tell the difference between the wheat bread and the thoroughly-cooked beef. Brown brown brown. 

My burger was good. But if you screw up a veggie burger, you need to kill yourself. My burger smelled so buttery. The butter from my sauteed mushrooms soaked into the top bun. The whole thing was mushy from the moisture of the mushrooms, the mayo, and veggie patty ... and it was wonderful. There's a part of me that enjoys mushy burgers. I ended up having to eat it with a knife and fork in the end. Its like the middle of the cinnamon bun, all messy, but that's where the biggest concentration of flavor is. Oh, yeah, and I eat my burgers in concentric circles. 

The fries. A travesty to fried foods. They were like greenish. They were thicker than shoestring and flavorless and dry. But they're not cooked in lard and have no trans fats. Honestly, if I'm eating fries, they better be cooked in lard and taste like pig guts and I don't care about the trans fats. They're french fries goddamnit. Not jicama. 

There's a little table tent advertising about how their wonderful fries now come with the burgers. Because they can't sell them any more. They have to give them away. 

There were only two desserts, each $6. But we didn't bother because they looked super boring. One was a brownie with toppings. The other was fudge ice cream with toppings. Meh. 

The total before tip: $32. Gr.

Oh. And \"Fine\" should be stricken from this establishment's name. 

* off the strip, non-casino"}
{"text":"My two stars are for the server (Eva) I swear she was by herself holding down half the restaurant doing the best she could; back of the house has to own this disaster. 

Ordered the Malibu w onion rings and Im gonna keep it real simple .. For a place to drop \"fine burgers\" alongside their name; expectations are elevated. I'd be willing to bet their meat is frozen at some point because it is dry, thin, and flavorless. The bun was forgettable, american cheese that covered some of the burger, 1 piece of bacon, old lettuce, and nasty ole \"whataburger\" style diced onions .. I just don't understand diced onions on a burger.  I don't eat a lot of red meat/burgers but most people can identify quality and this wasn't it. 

The onion rings also; the batter I believe was corn meal based but didn't work. I think the best application is beer batter or basic dredge; not cornmeal because the coating just falls apart. 

Oh, and one last thing .. Prices are ridiculous! My large coors light draft (yes coors light, not a craft beer) was almost $8 and was maybe 22oz I think. Laughable!  I will stick with Red Robin from now on."}
{"text":"I have wanted to try this place for a long time and now I am sad that I waited so long but at the same time not in a hurry to get back any time soon. The sweet potato fries were great but that was it. The drinks were just alright. The service was slow. The kids meal was good and a small size as not to waste anything. Not sure I will be back any time soon."}
{"text":"Favorite place to eat when I'm in Summerlin! The burgers, fries, and tortilla soup are my go-to, always."}
{"text":"Went to Islands at Desert Ridge with a group from Meetup and was pleasantly surprised at the atmosphere, the customer service and the food.  There were 12 of us and while they don't have large tables they do have a large booth and made us very comfortable with the large booth and another booth across the aisle.

Our server Mikey was great and very accommodating.  When fries for one of the people came out cold he replaced them with fresh fries not reheated ones.

I had the veggie tacos on corn tortillas and they were great.  They were tasty and full of beans, red peppers, onions etc.  I am gluten-free so did not try the burgers but everyone at my table who had burgers said they were good.

I will go back."}
{"text":"This is a fun place to eat. Great atmosphere and good food. Happy hour in the bar starting at 4 pm. I heard about this place in California, I didn't know that there was one here. We had burgers, yum...... They were so big and delicious. Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"How disappointing. Went to have a family meal here before going to a show. We walked in and saw several tables open. Hostess said it would be a 5 minute wait to get a table wiped down. We stood for awhile...waiting. Waiting. Kids getting antsy so we sat on a bench to wait.  Kept waiting. Another group of 4 people came in after us, put their name in. Then the hostess SAT them at one of the tables. Hello??  We asked the hostess why she sat them first and she stumbled a little bit then said \"I don't know.\"  We left and went across to smash burger."}
{"text":"Islands was ok. Just okay. 

I got a little bit of a bad taste in my mouth when I put my name on the wait list. I checked in at 12:50 and the hostess told me it'd be a 5-10 minute wait. We were seated a little after 1:20. 

When we were finally seated, we had a little incident with our tea, but to be fair, the manager came out and apologized and removed the tea from our bill.

Our waitress was very nice. She and the French fries were the highlights of the meal. No one else would make eye contact with us. I about fell out of my chair trying wave a server down as she was walking past. I called and called, but she was in the zone, I guess. Luckily our waitress saw the ordeal and came to help with our issue. 

The burger was fine. I don't know that it was $10 fine, but fine nonetheless. 

It was you're typical, nothing special cookie cutter chain restaurant. Not too bad, but not too good either."}
{"text":"Great burgers...endless fries. Too bad I'm full from the crappy place I had lunch. My daughters enjoyed it though! And the iced tea is phenomenal."}
{"text":"Tortilla soup was yummy. Cheddar fries are awesome. Fish tacos were alright (never had a fish taco before though)."}
{"text":"What a joke. We were seated right away, waited a minutes for our server who walked up and didn't even say hello to us. He asked what we wanted to drink came back dropped the drinks off and walked away without a word. We wanted to order an appetizer but were never given the opportunity to ask for one.
We left , talked to the manager and he offered to sit us with another server, but at that point we were done so we left. Terrible service, and the washroom was disgusting. Never again."}
{"text":"Why so much hatred for this place? It is a chain ladies and gents. This place is always packed and so it should be for what you are paying for. As long as your expectations are real, you will have a good time. Burger, beer and bottomless fries = $15 = good times. 

The meat SHOULD ALWAYS BE COOKED WELL-DONE in these places. Your are not eating prime meat, or wagyu meat, or kobe or well aged beef that is preserved properly.  So having ground beef anything less than well-done is like asking for death with fries."}
{"text":"Decent food, great happy hour half off appetizers."}
{"text":"Anytime I want a burger I think... ISLANDS after you have had a burger from here, you will never want to go to another place.  I love their Rincon burger and their bottomless french fries! Their burgers are so juicy that wow it makes my mouth water just thinking about it.

I first came here about a year ago and i was hooked! I come here about once a week.  I love this place, love the food, their brown ale (beer), the service is great, friendly people, relaxing atmosphere... What else could you ask for?"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch today with the wife. We both had burgers the buns must have been from the previous day. Very dry ! Told the manager she said thanks for telling us! Way better restaurants in summerlin!"}
{"text":"Went here for my 35th BIRTHDAY! 
My 1st time eating at the place. I was BLOWN away!! What a AMAZING choice!
The food was to DIE for!! The mixed drinks were PERFECT! 
The staff was well mannered & helpful great customer service. 
To top of the experience, my FREE birthday desert LOOK LIKE a master piece!! Picture perfect !! Not to mention tasted fabulous !!!  
Can't wait for my next visit!"}
{"text":"The food is pretty good! I have to say the service is very bad! Everytime I have gone there I sit and wait for someone to notice I'm at a table!! I ask if I have a waitress, then 10 min later someone shows up. Needs new management!!"}
{"text":"**LAID BACK BURGER JOINT IN SUMMERLIN**

I come into Islands at least twice a week. The always get the door for you as you come in, great touch. There are also hand sanitizing stations in the foyer, great for coming and going. I usually eat at the Bar and am always greeted with a warm smile by Stephanie, Traci or Mike. 

This place reminds me of my college years at UCSB: its Islandy, laid back and relaxed. They have three TV's near the bar with a variety of sports on and they will always change the channel for you. 

The beers are great, highly recommend the IPA. The food is great too. Its a burger joint and the Rincon ( Guac and Bacon, whats better than that?) and Malibu are my favorites.  The hidden jewel on the menu is the Chicken Quesadilla with Baja Chicken, I tell everyone to try this, if you do, you will be back. 

The Fries: Always freshly made and served warm and seasoned. They are endless with burgers , so get some to take home if you have leftovers. 

For its segment, Islands is perfect for me. It can be a little pricey but its fresh, great food with high quality customer service. Come to happy hour from 4pm -7pm and prices are  a steal!"}
{"text":"Maybe because we didn't get burgers, or maybe because I just wasn't feeling it - but it wasn't my favorite dining experience.
Everyone was as nice as could be, but I guess when I was remembering 'Islands' from driving by it, I always forgot that 'Fine Burgers and Drinks' was part of the name.  So I was expecting to find a totally different menu, but when we pulled up I realized I had made a mistake.  I was cold and we were heading to a movie after, so I didn't want to try to go find a new place to eat.  
Anyways, if I had gotten a burger, I might be giving this a 4 or a 5 star, but my boyfriend and I both got salads.  They cut the lettuce into the tiny pieces there, which isn't my favorite style, but whatever.  I got the Kobb (sic) salad and he got the BBQ Ranch Salad.  Neither were great, neither were bad.  Mine needed more bacon and the dressing was a combination of creamy ranch and caesar, which was mildly offputting. 
Being a dessert person, we also shared the Brownie Sundae, which didn't taste homemade, slathered in what tasted like Hershey's syrup and aerosol whip cream and almonds.  The almonds  were a tasty addition.

I'd go back if I was craving burgers."}
{"text":"We tried this burger joint and I had ordered the chicken tacos, they come in either 2 or 3 with sides of guac and sour cream for extra if you like. My dish came with a side of beans and some salsa. It was just ok. My bf ordered a teriyaki burger but he didn't like it much. It seemed very soggy and the bread was not very good and it looked hard to eat and messy. He ended up having to use a fork and knife to eat it. The cool thing is the fries are endless. I liked the fries because they were thick and made from fresh potatoes, and you can order as many as you like! He also had the chocolate shake which was not bad. We also had buffalo wings for an appetizer and it was soso. We tried t mudslide dessert which was mocha, chocolate ice cream pie, yum."}
{"text":"Islands is one of those chains I really enjoy coming back to.  When my family first used to come to Arizona to see my older brother at ASU, then when they came to see me years later, we probably ate at the old Mill Avenue location every visit.  The burgers are really good and I love that they can be ordered on wheat buns.  My personal favorite item is the Yaki.  It's a chicken taco, but with pineapple, jack cheese and teriyaki sauce.  You'd think you could get this anywhere, but for some reason it's fairly unique to Islands.

So why only three stars?  It's not because I'm anti-chain snob, it's because there's one big drawback for some diners who eat at this location at Desert Ridge that sticks out to me.  The tables are mostly four top booths, and four top round tables that are bolted into the floor (meaning you can't push them together).  We came as a big party and were told it would be at least a 20 minute wait if we wanted to sit together, despite there being several empty tables throughout the dining room.  We opted to sit at a pair of tables next to each other rather than debate going to another restaurant.  I'm pretty surprised that a family restaurant, in a very family friendly outdoor shopping mall, wouldn't have more tables to accommodate bigger groups."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness this place is good! My husband and I have been here for over a year and I regret to say this was our first visit! We have been missing out on great service and excellent burgers! I will come back here probably every week until we move again! I highly recommend you try it!"}
{"text":"Just okay sums up the entire experience.  The iced tea had a slightly offputting after taste.  Ordered what was essentially the bacon cheeseburger.  It was really big which was great.  There were an abundance of white onions which wasnt as great.  I cringe everytime I pay $11 for \"just a burger\".  The fries were good....natural cut with a seasoning salt.  Ashley our server was friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Love the food and service, we came from waiting over an hour for Bj's which were rude and made us continually wait even though we call in advance. I called Island Burgers to see if it was a long wait for a party of 9 and took us in immediately. The only thing that through me off was the waitress flirting with my husband. All I have to say is have a little respect his wife and child were sitting right next to him.  would say that was the only complaint."}
{"text":"My favorite burger on the menu is the Kilauea Burger. It is a jalapeno / black pepper crusted burger. It also has pepper jack cheese, chipolte aioli,  lettuce,  tomato with crispy onions on top. It is pure deliciousness! The burger also comes with a sample of fries or onion rings. A sample is all you need because the burgers are huge!  They also have fabulous guacamole here! It is nice and chunky and I haven't found anywhere that comes close to the taste."}
{"text":"It so happens to be National Burger Day but I didn't know that till later. Strolled on over  here after waiting at BJ's for 15 minutes to catch the NBA playoffs but there was no waiting. I ordered the Kilauea burger which is a Jalapeño & black pepper crusted burger w/pepper jack cheese made to order. It was mildly spicy and the Cheddar fries were nothing special that I got with the burger. On tap they had 2 micro-brews one was Stone IPA which I got and a friend ordered the Kona Longboard ale, they were both tasty and refreshing. This was maybe my 3rd or 4th visit here and the decor is your typical Polynesian style."}
{"text":"This was our last visit to Islands. Restaurant has the unfortunate \"sewer\" smell, which may not be their fault- but they need to address it. Food was subpar at best, my daughters ate about half of their burger and chicken sandwich. You get more fries in a Happy Meal - the portion size was pathetic. Our server, although very nice, was swamped and we waited for everything. The Habit is close by, save your money and treat yourself to great food there. No more Islands for us."}
{"text":"Great place great theme and great hamburgers and great ice tea and great customer service so you know what's next everything is great here and the salt and pepper mixes u have to try"}
{"text":"Good food, typical prices, different variety than Red Robin.  Kids enjoyed it a lot."}
{"text":"The pineapple Long Island was great. So was my meal - salad,!tacos, and fresh cut fries. Everything was delish. Gabby (the bartender) was awesome. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere, great service. it doesn't get much better. This is one of my favorite places to eat. I love the tortilla soup. The big wave with cheese and Bacon on a whole wheat bun is my second favorite. The shorebird is a juicy chicken sandwich, I get avocado and bacon on it! I like the Kona Lager beer on tap. I like the Passion tea too. They even change the tv channel on one of the many tv's to golf for me when I ask.  If you like surfing, there is a ton of surfing on the tv's, but also biking, parasailing, Snow skiing, Snow noarding and other high action sports. cool music is always playing in the background. I go to the one at Desert ridge mall."}
{"text":"Simply Great tasting burgers, probably the best or I would place it in our top 5 burger places and that is only because we have been to many burger places all over the country.  
we were introduced to this place by our local friends and guess what we are hooked. now every time we visit LA we must stop by this place  
very diverse menu sure to please everyone by offering great tasting salads as well. prices are reasonable and quality is very good 
portions are huge and over all great value 
Parking is an issue but once you get there your are in tropical haven 
Service has been good fast and friendly. so if you are a burger lover like me I strongly recommend this place, this will definitely be an upgrade to your in and out burger."}
{"text":"**Update** 
Since my Yelp review the manager Christian reached out to me and offered to make things right! Most places probably don't even care about Yelp reviews. We will be back and check it out again!! 



I hadn't been to an Islands in years... Now I know why!! The service and the food was very mediocre. For the price of this place I'd rather eat at home. We ordered a salad and a burger to share. Salad was okay except for the jicama we asked for on the side never got that. The burger was decent however I'm pretty sure they gave us the oldest fries they had...."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is great. The coffee was good. The food was just not there. Over peppered and no flavor. Service was great. They do not serve medium rare just medium. Only after half my burger, expected better flavor. More than likely will not come again."}
{"text":"Islands is a staple and should be on every families rotation when dining with children.  

This location was family friendly and the service was great.  The northshore tacos were fantastic and the fries as an appetizer are always great.  

Give this place a shot."}
{"text":"Food is good and so is the service however, I was disappointed in the prices and the lack of support towards military. There was hardly anyone in the restaurant and I understand why. The prices for the food have increased dramatically and the food is not what it use to be. The final straw was when management would not honor a military discount. My husband worked on Veterans Day and Saturday was the only time where our family could be together and enjoy a dinner out together (including my father in law who is a retired vet). Shame on you islands."}
{"text":"Hey!  One of the last remaining Islands restaurants and we found it!

Same place as always.  Very good burgers. I wasnt a huge fan of the french fries though.  They sorta had a In N Out burger taste to them, but they were a bit tough.  Maybe it was just the order we got, but I wasnt that impressed.

Burgers were good.  You get what you expect from Islands.  Decent food and I'd go back again.  However if I had the choice between Islands and Red Robin.. Red would win."}
{"text":"I have eaten at Islands many times, going back to when I use to live in California. Every time the dining experience, service and food has been decent. 

On my last visit at this location in Summerlin, we had just finished a hike at Red Rock that left us with a major mean appetite. We all agreed on Islands, since we were all craving a burger. 

Everything was great. Burger was juicy, the fries were crisp and the soda was not flat. I had the Maui cheeseburger which had guacamole and I had them add bacon strips. So yummy!! My sis had the Hawaiian burger and our friend had the Hula burger. They all raved about their burger. 
The only complaint we had was that once we were seated, no once came to our table to take our drink order. We waited about 10 minutes and had to flag down a worker walking by to get some service. We were sooo hungry due to the hike! Once our assigned waitress came by, she apologized profusely for not being aware of us and then gave us great customer service. 

Decent chain restaurant with a variety of burgers to meet different taste palates."}
{"text":"Great quick sit-in spot for the burger starved. Reminds me of Hawaii's version in Ala Moana which just was closed down due to low business, good to see this one surviving. 

The burgers here are average but perfectly cooked, never extremely greasy. Fries are steak fries. My tip is always order it smoothered in cheese. The bacon bleu cheese burger satisfies my want for a price conscious, custom burger in a sit-in setting.

Try it."}
{"text":"Last time I went to an Islands it was in Pasadena (i think) and/but all I can remember was how bad the date I was on was. But I will give you a second chance Islands .

They are closing early today for their christmas party, good for them, I hope they have fun...but, why the hell was I not invited. 

The bar tender is very nice, kind of a change from where I am from. 

Ordered a cold beer.

I got the blunami, a blue cheese burger. I can't hardly wait. 

If this place were down the street from my house, I could find myself hanging out here for sure.

The burger was great, great, great. Kinda wish I got the fries. 

Hope you come here and enjoy this place as much as I did."}
{"text":"This is one of the restaurants we frequent.  Last week I had foot surgery and as a result wearing a large boot on my foot and using crutches.  On Friday, 12-23-2016 at about 7:30 p.m. we stopped in for dinner.  As usual, the service and food was excellent.  After eating, the waiter approached us and told me I would have to put my credit card away.  When I asked why, he responded, in the spirit of Christmas the management was paying for our dinner.  I was also wearing my Veteran baseball cap.  I was shocked to say the least.  Good food and then this pleasant surprise.  I don't know how many times they did this with other patrons, however, this gesture at this time of the year speaks volumes about the restaurant and the management.  Because of their service and quality of food we would have still returned, but I strongly support this business.  To bad others don't share the same holiday spirit.  THANK YOU Islands Restaurant for your Christmas gift."}
{"text":"It's a chain but it's one of my favorite. This location at Desert Ridge mall is really as friendly as they come. I only come in once every two months or so but I'm always greeted warmly by whomever is ag the host station. 

The food is excellent, and if there's ever an issue they solve it right away 

Shorebird is my favorite. Chicken sandwich with Swiss and tomato. The ambiance is warm and inviting. Highly recommend if you want a good burger or chicken sandwich that doesn't break the bank."}
{"text":"Islands is a casual dining chain with a tropical theme. I never knew this place existed until I had lunch here today with coworkers. I ordered this Hoisin bowl, which was made of grilled pineapple, red bell peppers, snow peas, water chestnuts, red onions, broccoli, and diced scallions with hoisin sauce, served over brown rice. You have a choice of grilled chicken or grilled mahi mahi. I went with the grilled chicken.

There's nothing wrong with Islands, but there's nothing memorable either. With so many restaurant choices in the area, the competition is tough and establishments have to set themselves apart. Islands doesn't do that. Maybe I'll change my tune if I ever get a burger here, but my first visit left me thinking \"I could've had a better bowl at Teriyaki Madness.\""}
{"text":"Sweet Jesus this was good. Took a gamble after seeing the reviews and I'm not sure what everyone else ate. But I got a chili burger and my boyfriend got the bbq island red burger and they were both awesomely good. I'm from the east and I haven't found a single place that can do Greek chili the right way but they did. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"I love their burgers and my favorite are the mahi tacos! (if thats how you spell it) you can get unlimited frys and every one is nice in there. The only thing is i think the prices are just a little too pricey for some of the things. Other than that they are a thumbs up for me!"}
{"text":"We just had a wonderful lunch at the Islands! We started out with hot chips and fresh salsa. I had the Hawaiian burger and my husband had the Bleunami burger . They were cooked perfectly and on a fresh bun. The  fries were hot and tasty. The service was excellent as the fresh chips kept coming and the passion tea was refilled. Our server was also the bartender and she was excellent in every aspect of serving a customer. What a nice way to relax: great food and great service! I am so impressed!!! I wish the Islands would open a southeast East Valley location."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with Islands.  Decent salads at a reasonable cost, great burgers, and love those unlimited sweet potato fries.  Kate served us this visit and she was one of the best servers we have had anywhere.  Even though she had plenty of tables, she was always there when we needed her.  She was positive and had a great personality."}
{"text":"First time eating here, recommended by a friend. Not exactly what I expected based on the location. The outside of the restaurant looked better than the food tasted. We should've known what we are getting into, based on the restaurant was pretty empty for a Friday night. Food is overpriced for what you get. Horrible customer service. The waitress didn't explain anything to us even after we told her it was our first time dining there. We felt rushed and when she handed us our check, asked if we were done because she was going home. This is a 1 time only place for me."}
{"text":"We can here as a party of 15. Though they usually don't take reservations they did for us... So that was very nice of them. 
We all kinda felt like the burgers kind of sucked though... Which is too bad. Ire member enjoying a good Islands burger in the past. 
I had the North Shore tacos. They were delicious as usual and so were the onion rings. Service was great especially considering how many people we brought. :)"}
{"text":"When you first walk in the ambiance is definitely well thought out with the island experience. The staff was very courteous and quick. The portions were very generous. And i must say my burger was fabulous."}
{"text":"Have not been here in a long time. Atmosphere has not changed and feels a bit dated, but food came out hot and tasted good. Service was solid. The only thing I didn't like was the bar surface. It was clean but nevertheless it felt sticky. Maybe the polish? I'm giving it 4 stars because it delivered on all the basics, though good for friends and family, you're not going to impress anyone by bringing him or her to Islands."}
{"text":"Not happy. Server put my order in wrong. 20 minutes later after our entire party had eaten, I got my food. To bad since this is the closest islands to us."}
{"text":"Ahhhh, my sweet Islands Restaurant!  How I first fell in love with you at your Foothill Blvd, Pasadena location.  How I was soooo exited years ago when you first came to Vegas.  And how I went to you last night after some time and was reminded why I love you so!  Your freaking delicious burgers, endless crispy, tasty Island Fries, and bottomless delicious strawberry lemonade!  I shall be back and more often.  Maui burger with that awesome guacamole, yes I want it again!  Keep doing what you're doing because you're doing it oh so right!!"}
{"text":"Use to be good. It has gone down hill fast! Not only was the service slow but the food was AWFUL  !! I ordered the fish tacos. It was a FROZEN fish patti! On it was cabbage-not seasoned nor mixed with anything. That's it!! No limes as well.  I have NEVER left food on my plate, even if it was so-so. This is the ONLY TIME I Didn't NO Couldn't eat it. Waitress knew but did not say or do anything!  I will NEVER EVER eat there again!! I can get frozen food at store. Never thought I'd get it in a restaurant ! Ugh!"}
{"text":"I like the Hawaiian burger: pineapple, teriyaki sauce, lettuce, tomato, onion, swiss & mayo. I substitute cheddar instead of swiss. I  also crave the Kona Pie with mocha almond fudge ice cream and Oreo cookie crust. Fun Hawaiian ambiance with surfers on the TVs instead of sports. Easy island escape in this 110+ degree weather!"}
{"text":"We love going here. Good food, relaxing atmosphere. We sometimes sit in the bar area and talk shop, or bring the whole family. Never had a bad experience."}
{"text":"This is a fun place to come for happy hour. They make very good cocktails, I especially like the Makaha Maggie. It's a tasty margarita with pineapple. The burgers are very good, try the chipotle aioli it's delicious! ( I like to use it as a French fry dip, try it!)"}
{"text":"Ok so first whoever commented below it is NOT a closed location,  Clean and tropic ambient atmosphere, our server however was slow as molasses, was not overly busy took 15 minutes from time we sat down to get drinks.  We ordered a Kilauea burger and a long boarder was mediocre at best,  service sucked not very hospitable, the kitchen messed up our orders twice had a white bun bottom with a wheat top on one and completely wrong type of burger on the other,  I expect better service and food for that!"}
{"text":"Good place for a solid burger and fries. I'm a big fan of the veggie burger made with brown rice, mushrooms, and sunflower seeds! Yummy!"}
{"text":"Islands fine burgers and drinks. 

Went to islands for lunch with the kids. Very surf inspired decor and kid friendly. The little one had nice looking chicken strips and a questionable apple for only $3.99 including a drink. My older had pasta and salad with a drink for 5.99.  My fiancée and I had the fish tacos 3:5 which were reasonably priced and although not obvious came with unlimited fries. Although I was paying a bit more attention to the kids doing their activity sheet than the menu so it's entirely possible it was on there and I didn't notice. 

Good value but nothing memorable for food."}
{"text":"Went here the other day for a nice burger and Shayna was our server she did an Excellent job!!! Keep up the great work;)"}
{"text":"Excellent Service! Great Drinks and Food. Nice atmosphere and a great place for a fun casual meal."}
{"text":"Disappointed. I used to like to come here for a juicy burger, you know, the kind the owner looked for after surfing many years ago and was his inspiration for opening the restaurant in the first place! The burgers are now thin little patties like the kind you get at In and Out. Seriously, 5 Guys puts out a bigger burger for half the price.  

As for the fries...they need to be seasoned when they come out of the oil so it sticks. 

Service, well, not impressed. The server stood against a booth across from us and asked if we wanted anything. I wasn't even sure if he was talking to us. Not much eye contact. What happened to making your customer feel welcome? Oh, and when your guest presents a birthday email sent by your company offering a free dessert, saying \"Happy Birthday!\" Is a nice gesture. 

Not likely to go back. It used to be a great place, but not anymore."}
{"text":"Really good revamped menu! Enjoying the Hula Burger with Garlic Aoli. Definite recommendation....."}
{"text":"This is an update to the last review given 2 months ago. Jessica from islands asked fof myh contact info so management could contact me. Two months later still no contact.  This just shows lack of follow thru when addressing poor customer service."}
{"text":"First, I love Islands. But, this one? Nope.

Service was good and manager comped a meal, but both meals were poorly cooked, my mojito was basically club soda with lime juice, my wife's Margarita was pure mix, and even the beers (which we switched to because the mixed drinks were gross) tasted funny. 

2 stars because they offered friendly service, but we came here for the food. I eat McDonald's weekly, so when I pay 12 bucks for a burger I don't want to regret it. Asked for medium and got well done with a crispy burger. 

I'm not a heavy drinker and am usually buzzed with 1 or 2 drinks. I downed the mojito and 3/4 of the gross Margarita and a large Blue Moon and barely left feeling anything (which is OK with me, wasn't trying to get drunk, but that shows you the weakness of the drinks). I'd probably regret drinking that much anywhere else. I felt like I was 20 and still in the Marine Corps. But no, the drinks were just weak and gross.

Also, WORST HAPPY HOUR SPECIALS. Forget about it.

Anyways,  good service but again, we came for drinks and food and we didn't get it. So sad..."}
{"text":"Went for lunch to celebrate a grinding training finally ending. Burgers and drinks were good. I wish I had time to sit there and savor it. 

I will go again with kids which is the true test as we all know."}
{"text":"Islands is pretty consistently good but my wife and I had an exceptionally good visit at the Redondo Beach location recently. 
Seated immediately, we were told about the lunch specials and got our drinks really fast. 
The food and service were terrific and everyone on the staff seemed to be friendly and enjoyed working there. 
The manager checked in with us at our table and also wished us well on the way out.
Terrific meal,  5 stars."}
{"text":"During a meet up with a friend while I was up in Phoenix, we decided to venture over to this cool island like restaurant. 

The decor here is pretty neat, it's almost as if you are on an island. The waiter and waitresses attire is also very tropical like. This is great especially being in the Phoenix desert where we are miles away from a beach. 

The staff was extremely friendly and made sure to keep our drinks topped off well. They were also very patience with us as we were waiting for two others to join. 

For the entree, I was really craving a burger and of course I went with the tropical burger to top off my tropical feel. The burger was cooked right to medium rare and the pineapple was also cooked thoroughly. The burger wasn't too dry or bland. I really got to taste flavor and enjoy it with lovely tator tots!

I would definitely recommend! 

See it, taste it, Yelp it!"}
{"text":"We just ate here at islands it was awesome and our Server was great \"Amanda Sue\" she was super attentive had suggestions just overall great. I would come here to eat just to see her with  my family and I. The burger was great fries better. I have been eating At Islands for 20 plus years. I grew up in Santa Monica and there was one in Marina Del Rey. 

Thanks!!!!!

Pat"}
{"text":"I've never been to Islands burgers. Decided to check out the menu and then dine in. The food was delicious! Our server, Shayna, was super nice. Manager, Kenny, came by few times making sure everything was good. Great service and great food. I will return for sure."}
{"text":"Food was blah - chicken taco lunch special and hamburger with American (yuck) cheese. Beans with tacos were in a boring sauce. Tortilla chips were crisp, but had a flavor reminiscent of staleness. Maybe they'd been fried in old oil. Sat on the patio, which wasn't very clean. Worst feature: Islands was playing different music than the mall was, and you could hear them both at about equal volume. We should have gotten up and gone somewhere else, but we were really ready to eat and didn't have extra time. Nothing special at Islands. Nice server, but hostess and busser were S. L. O. W. Cannot recommend this spot."}
{"text":"Service was great. It was the best burger I've ever had to date. I got the Maverick burger and added avocado. Have nothing to complain about. Perfect"}
{"text":"We pick our food up and it was great. Better to order from them DD GH both screw up the orders then blame islands."}
{"text":"What can I say an pacific coast feeling. Large screen tvs thruout the establishment. Many cozy nooks tiki hut corners parots on roof tops and surfing on the tvs with cutting edge views. 
  The service is Great after a few minute waite.  Our server was actually a manager and he made our experience extrordinary with helpful decisions . 
  Our food was delivered hot and right to order and with a nice smile. Our glasses were filled and generous portions of fries.  He sold us on a delicious deserts.
   Enclosed are some pictures of our food and interior Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The chicken tortilla soup!!!!!

All you need to know. 
This is the best got dam bowl of tortilla soup that you will ever be lucky enough to eat. The flavors are right on time and it will rock you back and take you down to flavortown. Seriously, this soup is da bomb. I've been eating since I was a kid and hadn't had it for a long while. I popped in islands the other day cause I has a hankering and boy did they provide. It is better to have the soup for here than to go because when it's for here (if you get the large size) it's bottomless soup! It's served with avocados and tortilla chips and accompanied by a delicious aroma as soon as the the waiter sets the bowl in front of you."}
{"text":"Had the Kilauea burger, not very many jalapenos on it, asked more. Great food and great ambiance. Love these burgers , cold beer . Great place ."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good. I didn't expect it to be bad but wasn't expecting it to be as good as it was. Reasonable pricing. My burger was good and came exactly how i special ordered it. Also, grabbed a couple mai-tais on Happy hour that came stronger than any normal priced drink...that's a win, win!!"}
{"text":"I went here with my sister yesterday. I loved the atmosphere, the food was great, and our server Chad, was awesome. I may be a bit \"old\", but the noise was too loud for me, but otherwise than that, everything was good!"}
{"text":"The burgers are great here. The price is reasonable. 
Generally, nothing bad about this restaurant. But nothing stood out where I need to give a 5 stars."}
{"text":"The service at Islands was the best!  Our server Nick and the several different staff members that assisted him made our birthday dinner there for my nephew such a great experience.
Not only was the service extremely fast but the food was really good and the prices were great as well!
Thank you Nick, your assistants and Islands for making his favorite place to eat a great experience!"}
{"text":"Food was great, a bit smaller menu selection than one would expect. The service was good. We were seated quickly (4th time here and have never had to wait). If you are looking for a good burger and fun atmosphere, this is the place!"}
{"text":"Excellent Food and Service. My kids love the chicken tenders at Islands! The Yaki chicken tacos are amazing as well! The service is always outstanding. If you are looking for a fun and relaxing atmosphere Islands at Desert Ridge is a great choice!"}
{"text":"Lunch menu is good.. Get the shorebird! Awesome meal..

I usually sit in the bar to avoid long wait times so I am not too sure how is service out of the bar. The staff is awesome with friendly smilings and making sure your drinks are always refilled. 

Parking is not bad, a lot of space for everyone. 

Prices are not too bad and very affordable."}
{"text":"First time going to islands in about four years. I can't say I'll be back soon. I ordered a Mai Tai on happy hour and when it came out it tasted like tap water. We ordered three appetizers. The beach sliders, nachos and quesadilla. Beach sliders were alright but not very flavorful. The nachos had almost no beans on them so it was just a bunch of melted cheese and chips. The quesadilla was pretty good. But how can you mess that up?"}
{"text":"It was a slow night in the bar.  Our bartender was friendly very focused on cleaning the bar.  Our margaritas were not good at all !  Bartender credited one of our drinks , since we both complained we did not like them. 

Food was mediocre. ,  the long boarder burger tasted like a salt lick .  After our margarita experience decided to just not eat it .
The Yaki tacos again mediocre.  
The place was clean , service was decent .
Food and drinks 2 stars"}
{"text":"Top rated service by Casey for dinner last night.  He was upbeat, friendly and exceptionally efficient!  The food was delicious and the tropical iced tea fantastic!  Plan on returning and requesting Casey as a server."}
{"text":"Well I hate to say it but this place was just ok your food looks so much better on your website. I thought the service was way better than the food that's for sure. Will not be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"We have driven by Islands for years but never tried them. We were out as a family with a friend along for company, and she said Islands was great. So, that's where we went!

The atmosphere is pleasant and the service was fine. We were kept loaded with water, and my husband had Kilt Lifter beer.

My son is autistic and only eats tortilla chips or potato chips at restaurant. Fortunately, Islands serves up chips and salsa--and whoa, was it a lot of chips! Hooray!

I had the China Coast salad. I asked for the dressing on the side, and they obliged. It was an excellent salad. The flavors worked really well.

My husband had the Chicken Hoisin Bowl with some fries at the side. He liked the food quite well, but praised the fries in particular.

My friend had the Shorebird lunch special and really enjoyed it.

We found a new restaurant to enjoy as a family!"}
{"text":"My favorite place to come to! Best dining experience every time I come here. Islands definitely deserves 5 stars"}
{"text":"My family and I were up in the at a store in the Summerlin area and decided to give this place a try. As you walk in everything is very tikiriffic, which flows with the theme of the restaurant. It took a while for anyone to come to the hostess stand and seat us. Once we were seated it took about another 10-15 minutes for someone to come and take our drink order. Following those delays everything else went fine service wise. Regarding the food, I will first say it was good. I had a bacon cheese burger and fries. The fries were very good and crispy. I have never been one to say this, but their menu selection leaves a lot to be desired. The essentially only do salads, tacos and burgers. Their kids menu on the other hand is great, with two different menus based on age and portion size. One menu was for 6 and under, the other for ages 7-12. If all you are looking for is a good burger then I would recommend this place. Seeing as we live in southwest, though I cannot say that we would necessarily go out of our way to come back to this place. I can find an equally good burger somewhere closer to the house."}
{"text":"Okay I love this place! LITERALLY IF YOU ARE A VEGETARIAN GO HERE!!! Okay so I've been a vegetarian for my whole life and never have I had soooo many burger options as I did at this place!! Why did it take me so long to find this?!? Okay you can choose from like 10 different burgers. There's spicy, California, some with different sauces and veggies. All around just great! My service was great! The tables are very large which is awesome bc we had a looot of food!! Over all wasn't too pricy. I'd say I spent abt $50 on two people and a kids meal. But we ate GOOD! Dying to go back to this place for sure!"}
{"text":"Being from SoCal I was happy to see that there was an Island's while visiting Las vegas. The food did not disappoint!"}
{"text":"My favorite local restaurant! Love the menu items and the people are even better! 

If you like burgers or chicken, tacos, salads it's all delicious.

Islands is a weekly stop for me and the wife."}
{"text":"good burgers.  Good tacos.  ice cold beer mugs."}
{"text":"We were out this way yesterday just exploring and when we drove by my daughter said that looking like a good place so we had an early dinner there.  

I like the atmosphere, cool and laid back, very island like.  There is surfing stuff all over and surfing videos on and the staff is friendly and laid back too.  We had great service.  Drinks arrived promptly and we were checked on several times during the meal.  My daughter had an accident with her milkshake and our server brought her another one quickly, napkins to wipe up with, and wet wipes for her sticky hands.  

I had the Baja soft tacos.  They were good but lacking something...I dont know what though.  I had guac, sour cream and salsa too.  They were good but they needed more flavor.  Maybe it was the way the chicken was cooked, I'm not sure.  My daughter had a kid's meal of a hot dog and fries and she ate it all.  I would probably go back and try a burger sometime.

Mostly I thought the atmosphere was good, very island ish and I liked it."}
{"text":"Unfortunately the customer service has gone down hill! We had our order brought to our table and the girl was in such a hurry the she just swung the plates with our food and spilled sauce all over our table and on me. She sent the manger over to ask what had happened and when I told her that the server had just thrown the food and made a mess of the table and me she made it look like it's \"lol good no problem here\". She was super condescending and didn't want to hear what I had to say. If she can't correct herself by listening to what the customer has to say then she's in the wrong business! The customer is not always right but please listen to your customers. I won't be back with that kind of service."}
{"text":"Cane here for happy hour (4-7) my first time and it was a nice first time experience! The waitresses and bartenders were super Nice and patient with our ordering and greeted us well! The ambient was chill not too roust or too quiet! Shout out to the bartenders Carrie and Gabe who were there to attend us that evening!! Great food! Had the Hawaiian sliders and buffalo wings! Definitely recommend the food and place In general!"}
{"text":"Love it!  Biggest complaint is that there is frequently a really really really long wait.  Not enough parking either.

I have had my burger served under cooked (I like 'em extra done) twice but even that won't keep me from going back.   They have the best fries in town and their burgers do not disappoint.  Don't love the bun but it can be removed and tossed out.  

Service is usually excellent.  Couple of times we've gotten a new wait person and have been unhappy but again, never enough to not keep going back or even to ask for the manager.

Islands is our favorite burger spot."}
{"text":"Eh. 
Islands is another Chile's or Applebees to me. 
The food is okay but nothing to write home about and the prices a tad high for a so so meal in my opinion.
The portions are big though and side dishes like fries or a dinner salad need to be ordered separately.
The menu does include a fun list of drinks to choose from, so that's always a bonus, but I'd skip this place and spend your money somewhere else."}
{"text":"First time eating here. My friend and I shared so I had 1/2 of a chicken wrap which was very good. Just the right of amount of ingredients in a fresh tasting tortilla. I also had 1/2 of mahi mahi fish sandwich on a wheat bun. It was pretty good. The sauce tasted good and the veggies were nice and crispy and tasted good. The fish however was pretty dry. If it was cooked for a shorter time it would have been very good. I love their fries. The seasoning is very good on them. I will definitely come back. I'm going to try a burger next time."}
{"text":"Not great, not terrible, but three thumbs up for that TORTILLA SOUP!

I recall being 13 and thinking Islands was this fancy place with fancy burgers. I'm now not 13 anymore and have been set straight. Not my first choice to eat here but after a 3-hour hike with only a Cliff bar in my stomach, anything that wouldn't give me food poisoning was sounding pretty good at the time. 

I went with their limited edition burger whose name escapes me. The burger was tasty enough. Seemed like there was too much liquid in all those toppings. It tasted good but the bun got soggy real quick. Speaking of buns, you have a choice here! White or Wheat? And for my non-red-meat consuming friends, you can sub your beef patty with a turkey one. If you have a french-fry obsession like myself, you will love Islands unlimited french fries. The first batch that comes with your burger is relatively big. But the additional orders get smaller as you continue ordering. I believe they hand-cut their fries here. Think along the taste of In-n-Out fries with a thicker cut and longer fry.

My brother's friend had his heart set on the tortilla soup here. The hike started and ended with a tortilla soup discussion. In total, I can imagine we spent at least 30 minutes discussing this tortilla soup so my brother and I shared a bottomless one. I don't think that's allowed... but if you do share try to be stealthy about it and don't ask for a second spoon? All in all the tortilla soup was the star of the evening. It doesn't have that processed pre-packaged soup taste (but for all I know it might be). It has a homemade quality to it. It's really very delicious with little strings of melted cheese. If I come here again I'll probably skip the burgers and go all-in on that unlimited soup.

Also noteworthy is the Longboard beer. It's served ice ice ice cold. Tiny little icicles form on the top. It would probably be more refreshing on a hot day but it was still enjoyable after that freezing a** hike."}

{"text":"We love this place she gets the Hawaiian and I get the hula burger. Great place to go in summerlin."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever.   Service was awful.  The wait time for food in an empty restaurant was mind boggling.  Then when the food arrived the fries were very cold and soggy.  Stay away."}
{"text":"Standard quick-casual burger chain

Island's is about what you expect of a quick-casual burger chain.  Sit down is quick.  Ordering if prompt.  Service on drinks is average.  And food goes down, but is not memorable.  Cost was a bit higher than I expected.  Took us about 1:20 to get in and out the last two times.  Can also be a tad loud.

They do have a very good smoothie-type drink I highly recommend."}
{"text":"How would you like to put your mouth over the best burgers in town.  Yes.  I said it.  It's the best burgers I've had in such a long time.  This beats Red Robbin, In&Out, and the small mom and pop shop burgers I've had in my entire life.

Last night, mom and my step-dad decided to take the family out for dinner.  Instead of going to a buffet or a Mexican Restaurant in a casino like we normally do I suggested this spot since we had a variety of ages in our group.  There were 10 of us so I was hoping to get a huge table for all of us to fit in.  We were unlucky since the table they suggested fit nine.  \"Oh hell naw!  I want some elbow room dammit!!!\"  I looked at their restaurant lay out on the hostess's desk and noticed there was two open tables side by side.  I pointed it out to the hostess and said that would be fine.  So, we had the kiddy table of 5 and adult table of 5.  It definitely worked out well.

Looking around at the restaurant, the whole theme was definitely Hawaiian.  There were Bamboo huts and the lighting had a red and yellow feel to it.  I guess it almost felt like I was in a setting of a sunset/sunrise beach waterfront.  The good thing is that it was clean, the host persons were nice, and our server was also helpful.  He knew his menu very well and gave suggestions quickly.  The seats were very comfortable and each booth can comfortably seat 6.  Unless you get a bigger table that can seat 9.  The decorations clearly gave a distinct sense of being in a restaurant shack in Hawaii where all the tourists would probably go to order some burgers and fries.

Now, two thumbs up for awesome service and mad patience with all of us since we took a short minute to order.  Plus my cousin gave back the Passion Ice Tea and had the server replace it for Strawberry Lemonade.  For appetizers, we ordered TORTILLA CHIPS & SALSA which was bland.  I wouldn't recommend this since it was boring.  We also ordered SPINACH ARTICHOKE DIPChopped spinach and artichoke hearts mixed w/ sauted onion & garlic in a creamy
alfredo sauce served w/ fresh chips and salsa.  This was just okay too.  Just be careful because it's really hot when they place it on the table.  Give it time to breath and cool down before dipping in to it.  Another appetizer we ordered were CHEDDAR FRIES Islands fries w/melted cheddar & scallions.  This we scarfed down.  I wasn't sure if it was just out of starvation before we got it but I thought it was pretty good.  

Yes, the moment of truth... BURGERS!!!!  I was so excited my mouth was definitely salivating.  The burger I chose to eat last night was HAWAIIAN - Pineapple, teriyaki sauce, lettuce, tomato, onion, swiss & mayo.  But, I had them grill the onions and added the seasoned onion strings to top it off.  I know there's already enough flavors to it but what can I say.  My eyes got bigger than my mouth and stomach.  The flavors combined were just magical, the onions with the pineapple, teriyaki sauce all just danced on my tongue.  I am so amazed with this burger I would come back by myself just to order it over and over again.  As for my cousins, they ordered the MAUI - Guacamole, lettuce, tomato, swiss & mayo which was also good.  But, I think because my burger had an overpowering mixture of flavors anything else couldn't beat it.  The other burger that was also good was the HULA - Sauted mushrooms, lettuce, tomato, swiss & mayo.  This burger was pretty good if you like mushrooms.  

What did we learn today?  
Host persons were helpful and friendly.
Servers were very prompt and quick to make suggestions.
Restaurant was clean.
Appetizers were so good.
Burgers are to die for.
And I would come back for more."}
{"text":"Yaki Tacos were yucky! Skimpy on the teryaki and dry. The fries were hard and cold. Place is going down hill fast. I wont eat here again! WOOF!!"}
{"text":"First time in Phoenix. I really enjoyed my experience here! The food was delicious. The environment is cozy and very enjoyable. I had a pina colada and my boyfriends mother had a margarita. Both very good! The burgers were excellent!
Our waitress was also very friendly and pleasant. I would recommend."}
{"text":"The server was nice but just left us with empty pop for a while.  My wife's chicken bowel...I mean bowl...was no good.  Nothing was seasoned, the chicken wasn't seasoned, the broccoli florets had brown rotten spots on 2 of them and the bowl was room temp.  My fish tacos had room temp. chipotle cream sauce with a dearth of seasoning and the corn tacos were punctured and fell apart.  The bean soup was not charra beans it was soup.  The quesadilla appetizer before it all had about 8 hunks of tomato in the pico de gallo and the cheese was 2 inches away from the edges at parts.  The place was packed because it's in the mall.  I will give 2 stars because the waitress was heartfelt friendly, but the food was anemic.  The hostess did not crack a smile the whole time, I watches as were next to the hostess station."}
{"text":"I ordered burgers and shakes for delivery and everything was soooo good. Burgers were cooked to order and delivered at the correct temperature and very flavorful. Onion rings were crispy and flavorful. Shakes were not too melty. Overall it was a great meal and it only would I order Island's delivery again, but I would definitely dine in as well."}
{"text":"Just found out this location will be  closing on 12/22 and it will missed!  This Islands has been a go-to place for our family for over five years. The service was attentive and  quick even during busy hours.  Great convenient location to have a sumptuous burger with a cold beer.   The revamped kids menu is impressive as well. Islands staff,  thanks for great memories and good luck to you all!!"}
{"text":"Tonight my bf and I was here the service was alright the buggers was good the fries was a bit over cooked"}
{"text":"The Island theme for the restaurant is really in name only. As far as I can tell they do not have any real Island food, unless you can count burgers. They did have veggie patties (for those vegetarian/vegans out there), but it's nothing that you can't get at the frozen food section at the local supermarket. I have to say I was massively disappointed in the food, though the nice thing is BJ's Brewhouse is just a few short steps away and it has a much more varied selection of good food and beer. Save yourself and just hit that place up instead."}
{"text":"Great burgers, great service :). Loved the island feel when you walked in... Very clean and felt like I was on a mini vacation."}
{"text":"A typical Saturday, my partner and I are headed out to lunch. He's starving so the most important criteria is a location close to home. Sadly this means Desert Ridge.

We settle on Islands, my suggestion, his pick. 

This is a typical Desert Ridge Saturday at Islands, tons of kids with parents no where to be found. So here's how it goes:

Me: Please seat us somewhere away from all of the children
Hostess: UM...
Me: How about that table in the corner they are cleaning off
Hostess: let's see
Partner: Geez, I'm hungry let's just sit down
Hostess: okay, how about this table?
Me: Uh...what about that table with eight little kids sitting alone over there?
Partner: Oh, let's just sit here.

So I give in and we sit next to a table of eight kids, screaming fighting, crawling over each other while their parents sat in the bar and ate. What a wonderful experience.

Oh and the food. $30 bucks for a hamburger, chicken sandwich, chips and salsa and two drinks. The food was just okay, no better than I could make myself and I certainly didn't see any value in the atmosphere for the $30. 

Doubtful that we will be back."}
{"text":"Not exactly sure where the bad reviews are coming from. This place is unique in itself. You won't get any burgers with a twist of the islands anywhere. I got the special which I believe was the Siracha Burger. That was absolutely amazing. Burger was moist. The sauce had the perfect amount of heat. My bun even had flavor! It was full and fluffy! It wheat bun was slightly sweet! Loved the offset for the heat! My sister and mother got Tacos. Those were great! Service fast and friendly. Also the fries were to die for. Crunchy and lightly salted. We also purchased the wings which came out hot and crispy."}
{"text":"Love the burgers they have here!  They also have some pretty decent beer selections from Arizona so it's nice to get a good beer to go with your burger.  Definitely my favorite place to get a burger at Desert Ridge."}
{"text":"Just came to try the Chocolate Lava which is a fudge brownie topped with vanilla ice cream, chocolate syrup, whipped cream, roasted almonds, and a cherry. It was a rich dessert but I enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Omg the food the service   Love it!! Heather the bartender and Jennifer the manager went above and beyond for us.  We will be back many times in the future. Thank you so much so happy"}
{"text":"I have not been here in quite a while. They came out with a new burger called the Heat Wave. I ordered it with a veggie Patty. It meet the name, as it was really spicy. My only downside to eating here is the staff is always trying to upsize and push extras which is OK to a point but my waitress overdid it.

Overall if you are looking for a decent burger joint this place meets that qualification."}
{"text":"Food was really good! Portions are big but everything was great and came out fast. The tacos w the pineapple salsa...so good! Fun atmosphere, friendly wait staff. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Friendly hostess and wait staff. Reasonable prices for the food and beverages. Great burgers, salads and tacos. I would come here again!"}
{"text":"I drive 22 miles (from Henderson) to come here to eat. I always sit at the bar because Amanda is simply a fabulous bartender!! ALWAYS attentive, fast, and sharp to detail! Food is amazing! My favorite burger is the maverick. So flavorful, and big. Sweet potato fries are awesome as well. Beer on tap is soo cold. Always a treat to come here. Never disappointed. I keep coming back for more!"}
{"text":"I was here in Oct. 2013 and had a guacamole burger.  The burger was very bland, didn't even taste like guacamole and just has no flavor.  Was wayyy overpriced, so was happy I split it with my dining companion.  The restaurant itself is very cute and ambiance is quite nice with the cool surf theme and decor.  The surrounding area is also very nice (Summerlin/Red Rock area), so if you're basically looking for an enjoyable themed place, Islands is nice.  Servers are courteous and helpful.  Maybe other things on the menu are better?  I've had the Kona pie once before and it was good - again, very overpriced, but the portions are big so you can split. That would be my suggestion if you go to Islands - split it and enjoy the fun decor, best of both worlds :)"}
{"text":"Service is great but the food is disgusting i had eaten at this place a few years back an it was actually pretty good! I had ordered the fish tacos that tasted completely bland no flavor at all and my wife had the spicy tacos that werent even spicy she had to smother the tacos in tobassco sauce to get any kind of flavor. All in all are bill came down to almost 50 bucks were not cheap people but if were spending that much on eating out when i could have made the same thing  at home with better taste then i would have just done that. I wont be coming back."}
{"text":"I've been eating Islands since I was a young lad. This by far was one of the better experiences I've had. We were on a getaway from California and decided to have setting we're used to. First off, the chips and salsa with guacamole. Wow! They gave us so many chips we couldn't finish them and they gave us a lot of guacamole. We were surprised since back home they are super stingy on the guacamole. The meal was excellent. My wife's turkey burger looked a bit sad with a pathetic turkey patty. Once it was brought to the waiters attention, he took it back and was overly apologetic. Then the manager came out to apologize some more and to take care of that entree. The staff was so generous. It was a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"It was pretty good 
Islands has an atmosphere is similar to many chain restaurants. 
The food is decent, my burger was delicious, the fries were lacking. 
Kids meals and typical of every other kids meals. Mac cheese, burger, grilled cheese. 
I ordered a Mr. Pineapple and it came with a pineapple slice which is nice. 
Overall I would eat here again, maybe without kids. 

Our bill for two burgers and two kids meals was $56..."}
{"text":"Islands is a great place for a quick burger. They have really good chicken sandwiches and salads. It is a great place for kids. They have a new kids menu that has a lot of healthy options. The desserts are pretty tasty too."}
{"text":"- fries should not have to be eaten with a soup spoon.  i don't know what the kitchen is doing with french fries these days --- but two weeks in a row my sweet potato fries come out all limp and soaked with grease, not crispy fries at all.

most of the time i use the order to go - but the last couple of trips it has been a pain.   no one comes out, even after you call.   i've just taken to going in.    yesterday's order they forgot the drink and sides.   when i asked what happen guy said he only does the kitchen order.    whatever that means.     i guess all the stuff comes out on different paper ???  

oh well ---  time for a little manager TLC and hands on leading by example.

food was OK.   but im just bummed one of my go to favorites for a quick lunch has gone down the tubes...."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good but I probably wouldn't drive down here often. I got a chicken sandwich that had bacon and ranch on it and I also got a side of buffalo sauce to put on it and it was a pretty good sandwich. The service was decent however the drink machines were down so we could only get water or lemonade or drinks from the bar. Everyone's food was pretty good. The place is good and maybe they have other food I haven't tried that's amazing but the sandwich and burgers I've tried have just been pretty average. Good but average."}
{"text":"My hubby and I are from Socal and had a huge craving for Islands! We almost didn't make the trip to Summerlin from Green Valley BUT we decided to take a chance. I am glad we did!

The food was probably the best I have ever had at Islands! Except for the salad. The salad tasted like it had been sitting out awhile and the lettuce was limp and gross. That's okay though because you do NOT come here for the salads. The burgers are the highlight of the place. (In my opinion!) I got the Siracha Smack which had Siracha cream cheese that I could not pass up. It was the perfect amount of spicy and the flavors were great. My hubby got the Mavericks with BOTTOMLESS fries! He loves the bottomless fries! I think the fries have changed over the past few years, for the better! 

We also got the Island Nachos and I really think I fell in love that day. The cheese was perfectly melted and the guacamole was chilled and balanced out the warm nachos. They were really a 10/10.

The server seemed busy but still did an awesome job worrying about us and our needs. Thank you!

I hope an Islands opens up closer to Henderson."}
{"text":"i wasn't particularly blown away by islands, but i enjoyed myself.
they have a couple of their own beers, i had the brown one and it was pretty tasty. my friend and i ordered some appetizers. the poke (raw fish and slaw) which was very good and the nachos were were good but nothing special. i followed that up with the tortilla soup which was really good. (i just had a bowl, as opposed to the endless bowl) and my friend got a brownie dessert.
the service was friendly and informative. at one point, they forgot to put the beans on the side for our nachos and apologized when it happened, when they brought it, and the manager himself as we were leaving. 
the atmosphere was friendly and inviting, but i can't say much for price as my friend picked up the tab. i'd recommend it for an island vibe style night out!"}
{"text":"Before catching a movie at desert ridge, we popped into Islands for lunch on a Sunday. The place had several other people inside but wasn't too packed. I've often walked by this place but never really knew what to expect. I ended up glad we tried it!

With a name like Islands, you might already have an idea about the decor inside, and you're probably right! Lots of wood, giving you that casual beach vibe, surfing on some of the TVs, chill music, and a drink menu that starts off with a Mai Tai. 

Our waitress was super friendly and handled all of our substitutions, additions and exclusions like a pro. Everyone's meals came exactly as ordered and all of us altered the basic menu item in some way. We told her we were running to a movie right after and she promptly handled our checks. She was great. 

Speaking of the food, I went with the north shore tacos on corn tortillas, added sour cream and swapped the beans for fries as a side. The tacos were delicious! You get two but they are a good size and they certainly don't skimp on the fillings. With the tasty fries in addition, I left pleasantly full. The rest of the menu contained burgers, chicken sandwiches, salads, tortilla soup, and appetizers. They had a good beer menu and a variety of specialty cocktails. 

I will definitely return the next time I want to grab a bite before or after the movie!"}
{"text":"Food is good, but don't go to sit at the bar, the seats are uncomfortable and the bartenders are overworked. Took 10 min to get a drink while sitting at the bar."}
{"text":"Had to give this place another look. Been on a kick lately with burgers and my husband craving fish sandwiches. 

Service was great, the prices were average, and the food was really good. We started with nachos, crispy chips lots of cheese melted in between layers of chips, a scrattered amount of grilled chicken but not enough jalapenos.

My burger was the maui guacamole, swiss, lettuce, tomato, onion, mayo and I added applewood grilled bacon on wheat bun. The bun was a bit soft and fell apart while trying to eat, I prefer a bun that stays all the way through. The onion was a bit strong but overall a decent burger. 

My husband got the mahi mahi sandwich, it had teriaki sauce and hicuma cole slaw on white bun. He said it was realy good and he'd eat it again. We both had fries, crispy some with skins thin cut, good. 

Overall, good burger place fun place to come with a crowd!"}
{"text":"Only knocked off one star because the service can be sometimes slow. Besides that i'm surprised this place has been open for such a long time. In a good way I'm saying. The restaurant has classic american meals and everything i've had here over the years has been great. I definitely recommend coming here if your eating out on a budget, it's great for large groups too."}
{"text":"Awesome eating experience!  Great food and a great atmosphere even during the supper rush!  Everyone was polite and the food was excellent. We had the nachos with spicy chicken and the north shore tacos. I like the wide assortment of food here. And if you are wanting to catch any sports this place has plenty of tvs running with a full bar as well!!"}
{"text":"Surprised at how good it was!  We been here a handful of times but it seems service and the menu has gotten better! They've added healthy items such as a salmon or Teri chicken bowl which is served with brown rice. I was tempted to get it but came for a burger so I had the turkey burger on wheat (see pic), it was huge! I got steamed veggies instead of fries for a healthier option. Their tortilla soup was also yummy with a perfect spice to it. In all we were really satisfied with our dinner! Yay Islands!"}
{"text":"I always feel like I'm entering a car dealership when a restaurant sells fast food as 'fine dining'...but I was interested in trying this place out.

Yes, it's a chain.  After an afternoon of shopping with my artsy neighbor, we were game for some good grub, and she recommended the place, so off we went.

I'll admit to being a mite disappointed at the lack of creativity in the menu.  It's like Applebee's with a lei.

We shared an order of Beachside Sliders and Cheddar Fries.  The sliders were okay, the best part were the crispy red onion strings.  There was more bread than meat.  The cheddar fries were dry.  I took some pork soft tacos home also, and personally, I think they were better than the sliders.

The best part of being at the restaurant had to be our server, Fernando.  He was just AwEsOmE!  He kept us hydrated constantly, recommended that next time we get chili on top of the cheddar fries, and even ran, yes RAN to get club soda when my neighbor accidentally got a drop of ketchup on her purse.

Islands should be proud to have Fernando as a server.

If it was just on service, I would give it a five.  But due to the lack of items that called to me (2 different desserts, are you kidding me?  Just because you give it an 'islandy' sound doesn't make it so), and the items that we did order not being so yummy, I have to lay off a couple of the stars.

Yay to Fernando, boo to boring menu."}
{"text":"Great everything including service, however the chili fries are TERRIBLE... They absolutely have to take them off the menu. Cold canned chili. I desperately wanted to send them back but I was with friends, so I just didn't eat them. Worst ever... I cannot say it enough."}
{"text":"Every time I go in this place I feel like I should be on the beach eating my veggie burger with no bun but lettuce instead. Haha :). Substitute veggie patty on any of the entrees!! Two thumbs up!!!"}
{"text":"I've been a diner at Island's for a very long time and they have never failed me. You always know what to expect when you walk in the door. I love a restaurant that can be so consistent for so long! 

Some of my favorite dishes include their burger (always a good choice), their quesadilla, the tortilla soup (my favorite!!), the cheese fries or plain fries, the chicken tenders, their Shorebird sandwich (LOVE), their BLT, and their Yaki Tacos. 

As you can see I've tried a lot of their menu options and have enjoyed them all. Island's is a reliable, yummy restaurant that the whole family can enjoy. I will always be a customer!!"}
{"text":"Came on Saturday 7/30/2011 about 4:30 PM and sat at the bar for about 8 - 10 minutes. It appeared there was more help than patrons, however no one acknowledged my presence since sitting down. Sorry to say, got up and went and spent $30.00 acroos the street at Redrock for dinner. 

Maybe there is a reason the business has more employees than patrons?"}
{"text":"The burgers are amazing, and all the food is excellent.  We were a group of ten a few days ago; we were greeted warmly, accommodated with no fuss, and the service was outstanding.  Kudos to Lauren for managing our large group so well."}
{"text":"Great food. A bit cold from the air conditioner but that's prolly because the kitchen is working hard on those amazing burgers. Bring a coat if you can't handle a chill worth it completely!"}
{"text":"First, let me preface this by saying I picked up the food curbside. K had surgery down the road and since we don't live anywhere near either Islands locations, I couldn't pass up the opportunity to pick up food that she could enjoy later. I called in the order as we were leaving the surgery center and it was ready a few minutes after we parked in the special spots right in front of the restaurant. Everything was simple. The person who took my order over the phone read it back to me. She gave me the total. When they brought the food to the car everything was packed to go. Paying was super easy and we were on our way.
The food. Awesome of course. K ate it later that night. I reheated everything in the oven and she was very happy with it. It might not have been as great as it would have been had we eaten there, but that was't the point. The did a great job and for that, 5 Stars."}
{"text":"My mom and I had lunch here recently and had a good meal.  Our server took a bit of time to come take our order but he did stop by for a moment to say he would be right back.  I had the Hula burger - Sautéed mushrooms, lettuce, tomato, swiss (I changed to cheddar) & mayo.  The burger was really good. Flavorful meat, lots of mushrooms, nice melted cheese.  Loved the fries too.

Mom had the Beachside Sliders - Four mini burgers w/caramelized onions & ketchup on toasted buns, served w/Island Reds & pickles.  She enjoyed them.  They were the right size and were tasty.  I ate her pickles.  They were good.

I also had fun ease dropping on the table next to me.  It seemed to be a couple on a first date or just getting to know me.  They were funny to watch.  The server was a bit slow on refills but overall the food came fast and the bill came fast. A good place for a good burger and fries."}
{"text":"Driven by a number of times and decided to give it a try. Service was great! Food was ok. The reason for the 2 stars is the place was nasty. Clean the walls and the fixtures. Very dirty."}
{"text":"Great customer service. Usually no wait at the high top bar area. Great selection for food, including healthier options. Calories noted on menu."}
{"text":"Love the decor, the bartenders are small sweet ladies and services is great. I favor the Miti and the 4 Hawaiian sliders with pineapple wedge and terriackie sauce for just 9 bucks total during the long happy hours. Very yummy and watch the games on TV without a big crowd. Love it."}
{"text":"EVERY burger cooked to perfection. If you like it HOT get the Kilauea. Loaded with black and jalapeno pepper and spicy mayo but get the mayo on the side and nix the cheese so you can taste the meat... Praise jeebus this thing's awesome... Incredible! Fries are actually cooked like they are supposed to be with QUALITY potatoes... Thank you Islands!!!"}
{"text":"Well we originally went to Claim Jumper that is in the same lot, but when we walked in the smell was so bad we had to leave. Thank goodness for Island's they saved the day. We split the Cobb Salad and Pork Tacos, both were really good. I ordered the Blue Moon (it has to be ice cold) they served it in a frozen mug, it was so cold and refreshing they also know to serve it with an orange. Overall a really good experience, great service."}
{"text":"I was looking for a patio for lunch this place came through.  Food was good and drinks were good.  Nothing amazing but a very safe bet."}
{"text":"Wow! I was just here a few months ago. How fast can a burger place go down hill? I wish I would have read the recent reviews before eating here. I would have gone to In-n-Out in a heart beat. 
Just like previous patrons have stated, the burger tastes like it is freezer burned, the 'Endless' fries are not very good, the service is lacking, the bartender assumed I wanted Med. their version is very pink and greasy as well. 
Only positive is the beer. 
Next time I'll drive out of my way to a close Red Robin. Everything is much better there."}
{"text":"This is a pretty decent burger place. Since I'm a non red meat eater I settled for the Sandpiper chicken sandwich with fries on a wheat bun. The sandwich was very flavorful but a tad greasy. This was not a deal breaker though, I really enjoyed it. Sometimes a little grease is ok. The fries were nice and crisp, not too salty, with very little grease (hmm). I definitely want to come back and try some of the other menu items."}
{"text":"One of my favorite burger joints in the valley.  The burgers are huge and are cooked to your desire which is a plus as a number of places won't cook medium rare.  The restaurant always has a friendly staff and they serve you quickly.

If there is just two of you dining, I would recommend sharing a basket of fries and they bring out quite a large amount.  Overall, the restaurant has a nice atmosphere, is clean and moderately priced.  If you are in the area and are looking for a good burger I would recommend checking Islands out.  You won't be disappointed.  They also have a good strawberry lemonade drink I would recommend."}
{"text":"Came in to grab happy hour, and I was told I could not sit in the bar, because my ID was expired. Even tho I am in my late 30's. huge disappointment."}
{"text":"Terrible service. They definitely treat you like they don't want you here. When dining here, I feel that if they weren't a nation-wide chain restaurant, they would not serve you here.

Would go back to Islands (as my family has been eating at Islands locations for decades), but definitely not this location- where they made me feel unwelcome and unappreciated."}
{"text":"Passion fruit iced tea is amazing.  Burgers are okay, nothing special. I love the tropic beach themed decor inside, makes it fun to eat here.  Service is decent too."}
{"text":"I used to go to islands a lot when I was in high school and used to love the tortilla soup. I came back and had to have the soup! It was fairly disappointing.... Not very flavorful at all. Nothing like I remember. I tried a burger too...definitely not as delish as it was expensive. I probably wouldn't return."}
{"text":"Wow! What happened Islands? Your food used to be pretty good but tonight was really a disappointing. My daughter and I stopped in and had dinner and Yuck! I had the Kaanapali Kobb salad and the lettuce was old and brown. The bacon was burnt and probably been sitting around all day. My daughter had a chicken sandwich and it appeared some parts of the chicken were not cooked all he way. I rarely give two stars but not a good dining experience at all. Thank goodness our service was great with Bobby. He was on it and even though he was serving a big table next to us, we still received his full attention! Won't be returning too soon."}
{"text":"My family and I stopped in for a quick bite after working up an appetite shopping at Costcos. We were seated promptly, our drink order was taken immediately, and drinks were continually refilled! Our server Natalie was professional, kind, and knows how to handle her job. On top of that... she always had a friendly smile!!! Will be making Islands visits more often!"}
{"text":"It was a touch pricey, but the food was well prepared. There were many burger choices and most looked very appetizing. 

The French fries were sub par which was disappointing. 

I got the wedge and it was exactly what I wanted and I have no critiques. 
The drinks and their specials were also very good. 

Looking for a place to eat lunch or go for happy hour drinks and delicious burgers? Look no further, fam. 

The service was very prompt and profession. Definitely a huge plus."}
{"text":"Ate here at 1:30 pm burped up food until 12:30 when I was finally able to go to bed. By far worst food I've ever ate,restaurant was dirty,food was hot only reason for one star would give negative stars if I could,the waitress spilled water all over out table as she was taking stuff from table then looked back blamed our table like we did it. Fries we're good. Nothing else had shits for a week after. Wash your hands in kitchen."}
{"text":"Came here for my sons birthday on Friday. 
We ordered the pipeline, two orders of veggie tacos, islands cheese and bacon fries, chips and artichoke dip, kids cheese burger, and kids chicken strips. Food was okay at best, food was pricey for what it was, and I find the restaurant to be boring. My sister in law ordered a margarita and only took two sips that tells you how not good it was. I try to avoid this place as I know I'm not going to be impressed but my son loves it so I wasn't going to deny his birthday request. I won't be coming back anytime soon. Service was good hence the 3 star rating."}
{"text":"Mediocre at best.  The meat for the burgers have the oddest taste of old meat and freezer burn. Like the meat has been left out a bit or something. 

Huge portions I mean it isn't horrid but I do taste something off putting in the meat."}
{"text":"Above average quality burgers. If you try the wing appetizer, you will be impressed. The service is friendly. I have been several times and will continue to."}
{"text":"Gross. Bad. Never again. Went here for lunch today with my kiddos and food service took forever... only for the food to come out looking old and gross... not sure how you can mess up French fries but they did. There are only 5 things on the lunch menu and I got the tacos which were less than appetizing... so disappointed and will never ever return. Ever."}
{"text":"We came here tonight for dinner.  We were all extremely hungry and couldn't wait to order. The service was amazing and fast. We were seated right away and didn't have to wait long for our drink or our food.  I definitely recommend getting an order of onion rings for the table because they are delicious! I also ordered their Hawaiian burger and it was just as yummy as it sounded(burger with pineapple and teriyaki sauce).  It is, however, an extremely messy burger so ask for extra napkins.  

Bring your friends and bring your appetite!"}
{"text":"The food is absolutely delicious, and the atmosphere is great. I feel like I'm at the beach when I visit the restaurant. I highly recommend this location."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time in years. Everything was delicious! It was so nice to see everyone working together as a team and to see the managers be so hands on!"}
{"text":"After a 5 year hiatus, I returned to Islands to try again.  I ordered the my burger the \"least amount that I can get it\".  The server, Andrew, advised that their policy was that medium was the least they can do, but that it was pink throughout.  As you can see from the picture, it came out well done.  If you are a burger place, how about finding someone who can cook a burger??  So irritating and disappointing.  I'll never return."}
{"text":"Islands Restaurant in 89135 delivers on service and kid-friendly dining. After a day of work and school, we were welcomed and seated in a booth. I enjoyed the amusement of surfing and other adventurous videos displayed from a variety of angles in the restaurant. The entertainment was a conversation focal point while we waited for milkshakes to be served. 

The children's menu hosts a variety of choices. Sweet potato fries, buttered noodles, applesauce, and broccoli florets are four we can depend on for busy fingers and hungry stomachs. As always, I hope restaurant's like Islands will make the choices ORGANIC but I am at least grateful for the variety and fresh options.

The service was quick and attentive. The server ensured my turkey burger could be wrapped in lettuce to eliminate the bun. I made the request and the chef delivered. The timeliness of service was efficient. The smiles and patience were abundant."}
{"text":"Islands is a treat as we don't have one near us.  We've been to one in California and I was a bit skeptical that this location would hold up.  Turns out it did and exceeded - both in food quality and customer service.  Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Food is delicious. A little pricier than I remember (as a teenager) but still super tasty. Yaki tacos are my ultimate fave. Cheddar fries are a little hard but tasty. And don't drive after one Mai Tai."}
{"text":"I LOVE ISLANDS!! I love the atmosphere and just everything. My favorite burger is the maui with crispy red onions added to it for $0.79 and its HEAVEN."}
{"text":"A tropical atmosphere with a American cuisine (I.e., Burgers, salads, sandwiches, and fish tacos-ok some mexican) try everything you'll love it!"}
{"text":"The first time I had Islands was in Los Angeles.  The second time, in Mesa.  The third, here are Avondale.  And since I'm lazy, I decided to mark my review here. 

[focus point here]  When I had first had Islands in Los Angeles, I thought this was as good as it gets.  Pineapple slice on a burger?  Count me in!  As soon as I got home from my trip, I googled the joint and found that we have our very own Islands.  I was ecstatic!

So I rounded up the buddies and we went with high spirits.  Although the food wasn't nearly as good as I remembered, it wasn't bad.  It's definitely a good little place to get together with friends.

As Margaret L. said, it' s pretty much like Applebee's except the quality is a million times better!  I recommend trying Islands yourself."}
{"text":"Total chain, but they're kinda fun anyhow.  Nice causal atmosphere w/ everyone in Hawaiian shirts and shorts. The food is nice, with a beach theme to their salads, burgers, tacos and other goodies.  I have to admit, I really like their teriyaki chicken & pineapple soft tacos.  Their Northshore tacos are pretty good too with their marinated shredded chicken, but better if you get a side of sour cream. 

I have lots of friends who are big fans of their burgers, but they've never been my thing.  Their cheddar fries are another thing all together.  I know how wrong it is to get a platter of cheese fries, with folks eating them with both fingers and fork, but somehow that works here....

Final bonus big booths to fit an easy 8. And if the surf videos playing or the fake birds in the fake trees are too much for you, they've got decent bar area."}
{"text":"If you're in the mood for a burger and fries, it's a good spot. It does the trick if that's what you're looking for. A burger lover's paradise, there's also a little bit of something for everyone. 

What I want to comment on the most is one of the hostess's. She talked at a million miles an hour, but she was friendly and sweet. I was waiting for friends and it was slow, so she came over and talked to me and made me feel really welcome."}
{"text":"When this place first opened it was really cool, but I don't eat red meat and there's seriously like two chicken choices for me which sucks. There food is not what it used to be and neither is their customer service. It was just ok but I haven't been back for a few years now, probably won't come back either."}
{"text":"Cool beachcomber setting in the middle of the desert.  This place is a perfect example for an average rating.  Average service and average food.  I had the grilled chicken sandwich which looked like it was cooked on a flat top instead of a real grill, so that threw me off.  It wasn't delicious and it wasn't terrible.  It was average.  The service wasn't fast or slow and the employees were not nice or rude.  The service was average.   Probably have some better options in the area, but if your craving a burger and want to watch some surfing on TV, give it a try."}
{"text":"Islands \"fine\" burgers.... Should drop the \"fine\" in their name. This is simply another version of Chilis or AppleBee's. Frozen burgers, frozen fries, frozen veg. - overall pretty blah :-("}
{"text":"Pick up was great!!! Delicious , Fast, Great Service !! Patrick was so kind and had the best customer service when I came to pick up my large order it's so nice to see employees that are genuinely happy in serving their customers.  The food is amazing and everything was packaged perfect ! Great food ! Most important great service !!Strongly recommend !"}
{"text":"Had dinner here tonight. Sat at a high top table in the bar. Our bartender was awesome. Started with chips and salsa. Very good. Loved that the chips were served hot. Had the jalapeño and black pepper burger. It was kinda spicy. More black pepper than jalapeño. Would have liked it cooked medium. Was a bit over cooked. (Ordered medium). Fries were very good. Glad we used yelp to pick out this place for dinner while we were in town."}
{"text":"Love the authenticity and the great people who work here!  The kalbi dish is excellent as is the teriyaki chicken!!  I had them cater and event and everybody asked me where I got the food from.  Every piece of food was eaten!!  My kids demolish the spam musabi from here and they would eat it every night if I let them!  If you miss Hawaii, be sure to stop in here!"}
{"text":"The pros: friendly, personable service
Amazing fries and fun atmosphere
The cons: can be a bit expensive 
Absolutely not healthy and very limited healthy options."}
{"text":"Had a really great experience! Service was great, burger was delicious and the Mai-tais were amazing!!!! Not to mention the prices were very reasonable!!!"}
{"text":"I had eaten at an Island's in CA about 10 years ago, but last night was the first time since then. The burger was pretty good, but the fries were not as good as I remembered. They seemed to have a pretty good selection of beers on tap. The service was very good, particularly considering it was a Saturday night and  I was in a very large group and they were willing to do separate checks, so the employees get a big thumbs up from me."}
{"text":"I love Islands. I wish they had more locations in Northern CA. I always get the hulu burger. Neat that the burgers now come with fries. That wasn't how it was back in the day!"}
{"text":"Food was great, service was better. Shout out to Jorge he was attentive and on top of taking care of everything we needed. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"I've been talking about wanting to try this place for a long time. Finally, we went. First, we do not like booths and there are only a few tables-not comfy seating. Ordering, the waitress tells us it will be more to add cheese to our fries. Ok! No big deal. I don't mind paying for cheese. When the food arrived, I was highly disappointed when I seen a few fries with some cheese on them. $1.30 for extra cheese, but where's the cheese!?? The burger was thin and non flavorable... and no cheese? If the burger doesn't come with cheese, why wouldn't the waitress suggest it? We are obviously cheese people! My husband got fajita chicken tacos. They were ok, but missing some sauce or salsa. And again, no cheese on those either!? The waitress and service was good, but is there a cheese shortage I should know about?"}
{"text":"We were in the area and drove around to see if there was something new we could try! This was the stop! It's really cute inside and makes me feel like I'm near the beach. Love the service! So friendly and definitely down to earth. I ordered the buffalo wings for an appetizer and boy were those great! Yummy taste, and has a kick to it! My lips were burning! I got the lunch special. Burger with fries. IT WAS SO GOOD. Not what I was expecting! It was just a normal burger, but it was tasty and the buns were crispy! Overall I had a really good experience here!"}
{"text":"One of the best burgers in Arizona. This place is a true classic - it's been here forever and still as good as always. 

Definitely recommend stopping by for an awesome burger and fantastic sweet potato fries."}
{"text":"One of my favorite reasons to go the the Desert Ridge Mall is so I can go to Island's. I am a vegetarian and I will start by saying that Island's is a very vegetarian friendly restaurant. All of their burgers can be made using a vegetarian veggie patty instead of the usual meat. The staff is also really knowledgeable and will answer any questions you have about ingredients or toppings. Since I am addicted to their burgers I have yet to try anything else on the menu, but a friend of mine always gets Island's tacos and says they are to die for. Island's also has the most amazing french fries! Best of all the french fries are bottomless! The awesome servers never object to bringing you an extra plate of french fries to go with your meal.
This Island's is one of my favorite places to go for casual, fun food!"}
{"text":"Burgers and fries...oh my!   Surf videos.  Wipeouts.  It's always good, consistent, and family-oriented.

Burgers:
=======
My fav burgers are the: Hula (sauteed mushroooms), Hawaiian (pineapple, teriyaki), and the Point Break (Gruyère & bleu cheeses, caramelized bacon & onion relish). About 12 kinds to choose from, all burgers can be made with beef, turkey, or veggie.  Price ~ $10.50, but carb heaven --- fries (all you can eat come with each burger!). 

Salads/more:
==========
The salads are large, the nachos are a monster (and great), and I also like the soft tacos with chicken (a lot!).

Desserts:
=======
Kona pie is one of the best things in the world.  Mocha almond fudge ice cream, oreo cookie crust, topped w/chocolate fudge, whipped cream.  C'mon now!  Seriously, just pop in for one of these things (and don't share!).

Happy Hour:
==========
Served 4pm-7pm, Monday-Friday --- with good options!  Chips/salsa ($1, made fresh, thin, and served warm), cheese quesadilla ($2.95), 4 sliders ($3.95), among other items. Drinks featured: drafts ($2.95-$3.95), wines ($3.95), and mixed drinks ($4.25).

What's unique about this location?:
===========================
* service: nice, fun, and responsive
* lots of parking, but busy busy lot...making it not as easy as it looks"}
{"text":"This place is overpriced and overrated... there are a bunch of kids in it and you can get a much better burger at five guys."}
{"text":"There is REALLY, REALLY NOTHING I like about Islands.  I think I am alone in this but if I'm going to eat a burger I want the BEST.  I NEVER strive or reach for mediocre.  Not to mention I don't care for the theme of this place.  It's a bit over done with the surfer/beach vibe and it's always so loud I can't even here myself think.

That said I wasn't the one who picked this place.  A co-worker did while we were at a conference.  They LOVE IT and the fact they get a lot of food.  They were not caring if it were good or not.  I on the other hand DO CARE and IF my company was paying, which they were WHY NOT eat at a better place where I knew the food wasn't going to return with a vengeance and cause my stomach to hurt from all the grease, salt, and mystery ingredients.

SO I lost the bet and this is where we ate dinner.  Bunny was still in town visiting so he came along.  We had to wait for a table which seems pretty standard for this place.  The wait wasn't too long before our name was called.

They crammed us into one table.  SIX people don't fit to well at a booth made for 4.  We perused the menu and some of my co-eaters wanted the unlimited fries.  I'll pass on the basket of grease thank you.  I ordered a veggie dillas and a diet coke.  I can't remember what everyone ordered.

The food was up in a reasonable amount of time.  My dilla were under whelming but they lived up to the non-WOW factor of this place so I wasn't expecting much.  Our server did ok. She was friendly but over worked.  I blame that on whom ever is running this place.  They are so busy trying to save a buck they don't schedule enough staff thus another reason I an NOT a fan.  Over all it was an ok experience but I doubt I will be back."}
{"text":"Yesterday was National Hamburger day, so it was my patriotic duty to partake in this directive. I was greeted by a smiling hostess and proceeded to the bar where an NBA playoff games was playing on the flat screen TV. I made it in time for happy hour but no hamburgers other  than sliders were on the menu. 

The Hawaiian is what I wanted and at around $9.00 I was ok since it came with Onion Rings. Order arrived with 4 yes 4 onion rings. I asked the bar tender/ waitress if this was it, and she assured me it was. She did offer me another side but I said no. Disappointed with the onion rings, I cut my hamburger in 1/2 and proceeded to eat. Frankly it was boring, slice of pineapple a bit of Teriyaki and 3/8\" slice of onion on a bun that was as boring as the hamburger. Waitress brought me 4 more onion rings which were the highlight of the meal. Unfortunately, others arrived at the bar, a heavily tattooed Mohawk wearing individual with girlfriend. Every-other word was F this F that. Ate my burger drank my Blue Moon @ $5.75 for 16 oz. The bill  came to $16.33 and I left a $20.
Sorely disappointed with this chain that lost its way. 4 stars to the waitress who knew how to handle a disgruntled customer. In and Out would have been a better choice."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with Island Burgers! The service is great and the food is good. However, don't get the fish tacos.  It was bland and it took forever to cook.  I have been going to Islands since I was a teenager.  The tortilla soup is my fave! Full of flavor and never disappoints.  The staff is always very nice, almost too nice but I like that!! I would definitely recommend this tasty spot with friends or family."}
{"text":"It's been at least 5 years since I have been back to this place.  We went just because it was in the area and we were hungry.  The plus side was that I was able to order something that had been taken off the menu AGES ago - The Flamingo (chicken sandwich with honey mustard basically).  The fries were great - and also unlimited."}
{"text":"I hadn't been to an Islands Restaurant since moving away from the Los Angeles area and hadn't had much interest in returning.

My friend was in town with her young daughter so we had to find a kid-friendly restaurant near my work for our lunch meeting. Service was friendly and helpful and we appreciated how attentive they were with refills. The food was just ok and for the price I see no need to return when there are so many better non-chain options that serve better food for the price."}
{"text":"Better than a Fridays or Applebee's, but still just a burger. It's creatively mediocre, if that makes sense."}
{"text":"Everything was as expected and I'm very satisfied. I want to take a moment to recommend sitting in Daniel's section when you visit. (Hint:ask) I just had some of the best service I've had at any restaurant. It's definitely worth mentioning."}
{"text":"Usually I wouldn't give a 5 star for somewhere with pretty good food. However the atmosphere was nice and beach-ee, and for the price its good food. They have a full bar. 

My boyfriends burger was really good, very well seasoned. I switched out my burger for chicken on mine, and it was really good and light, compared to a burger. The waitress knew the menu and actually suggested that I switch the chicken in the burger, since I couldn't decide between that burger or a chicken sandwich, because I wanted something lighters. There are tvs, which I generally don't like but they are all at the bar, and they also had one of the on a surfing and ocean channel, which was nice since the theme is islands. 

They had nice outdoor seating. 

The Hostess came to the door and opened the door for us it was extremely inviting and just a really nice touch. Even the other guests were very friendly. 

This is definitely going to become a regular place for us, we both loved it."}
