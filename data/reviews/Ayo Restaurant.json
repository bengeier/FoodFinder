{"text":"Nice service,  cool environment and the food was great. I will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"I love West African food, my gf is from Nigeria so I know what I'm talking about when it comes to food and this was the worst jollof rice I ever had.  Order came without plantains, chicken was dry like I barely touched it.   You guys have to change the way you serve Uber Eats orders, I wish I would have come to your place to understand how can you mess up such a good meal.."}
{"text":"Positives: Nice decor for a nigerian spot (Most west african restaurants are no-frills spots). Warm atmosphere & Friendly Staff. They take credit/debit card (most west african spots don't and you know why, if you're west african). Food looks good at first glance.  Negatives: Food was bland (it needed salt to wake it up). The portions are horrendous. Not sure if this is a Montreal thing because all of the food in this city seems to be child size, just like Paris. I ordered jollof with chicken for $15 cad. I got a massive amount of rice and two tiny pieces of chicken. Shouldn't it be the other way around? The chicken was mostly fat/skin and bones. I had to use a knife at my hotel to dissect the actual meat of the chicken. If i wanted more chicken, it was $2 per piece...that is ridiculous. I originate from New York City, which has many west african spots and much better value (which is sad because nyc is known for being expensive). Even in Toronto, I can get a plate of jollof rice/huge pieces of chicken with salad and plantain for $10 cad.   Summary: When I come to a nigerian or ghanian or any west african spot...I come to EAT. That is the only reason why I'm here. If you've ever been to any west african country...you know that the portions are ON POINT. As someone who can actually make this food, i felt cheated. Overall, its not worth it."}
{"text":"In town for my sister's wedding and we wanted a place to hold a welcome reception for all of the family coming in from out of town.  We are Nigerian, so hors d'oeuvres and other finger food would not do!  We had a week's notice so we were really scrambling when we came across Ayo's (they a have a FB page).  We spoke to Ayo, who told us what she would be able to do in such limited time.  So appreciate her HONESTY in giving feedback on our best options for the event we were trying to hold and not selling us on what could not be delivered for the sake of upselling.  I was a little nervous because, she was out of town and her husband, Sunday would be catering the entire thing.  I shouldn't have been worried because he was the consummate professional, very helpful (even let me use his GPS for the weekend because I kept getting lost coming from Montreal) and went above and beyond to help us host our family and new in-laws in style!  The restaurant remained open upstairs, and there were a steady stream of people coming in to dine-in or take out, and after tasting the food (including the legendary Suya) I understood why.  They have multiple spots for dine in upstairs, along with 2 tvs and a full bar.  Downstairs is their event space and we comfortably accommodated around sixty people there with no issues.  The menu included egusi soup and pounded yam, coolers of jollof rice, EXCELLENT meat pies, EXCELLENT suya, chin chin,amazing dried fish, and mixed meat in stew that disappeared before I even got a chance to see it!    If you are in Montreal or Lasalle and looking for authentic Nigerian food and/or are looking to host an event, RUN to Ayo's, they are the real deal."}
