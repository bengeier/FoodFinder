{"text":"I had not been here before and having read a post on 3 July was rather apprehensive, but I was tired and it was the nearest, with parking to where I was staying. I was served a most generous, tasty and well cooked main dish of lambs chops, new potatoes, and vegetables at a very reasonable price. The music in the conservatory was a bit too loud, but the service was prompt and friendly. I would definitely go there again."}
{"text":"I'm afraid I was disappointed with The Owl and Trout!    The staff were friendly and good! It was the smell of the place that put me off! It did not smell dirty but just had that odour one gets in many eateries like old canteen food!    The steak was quite tough and their french fries were like a stack of really thin waffles!    I'm sorry but I just don't get how some people think this is a brilliant place to have a meal. We had taken my mum there for her birthday as she had chosen this place due to a few people telling her what a wonderful meal they had had there. We won't be back in a hurry."}

{"text":"I have eaten at the Owl and Trout several times in the last few weeks and cannot complain about the food at all.. We sat in the conservatory with a view of the Loch and like the previous comment found the food tasty, hot and struggled to finish the meal due to the size of the portions. The only problem I had was the music - music in the conservatory was competing against the music from the kitchen."}
{"text":"For good wholesome food in cosy surroundings (bar) or try the conservatory for a view of the loch, the staff here are always so friendly, and you can choose from a varied menu for lunch or the a la carte(available all day) - prices are reasonable and food is good - I defy anyone to finish the fish & chips! the fish are the biggest I've ever seen! hence the need for big plates, and a big appetite!. Go for a drive at the week end (or any other time) and give this eatery a try, you wont be disappointed!."}
