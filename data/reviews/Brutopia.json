{"text":"Have to admit that I come here once every two years for everything Marillion as Brutopia is the fans HQ for meeting up and reconfirming old friendships. After 8 years it feels like home, a well worn pair of comfortable shoes or that sloppy joe sweatshirt. This experience shapes my view but behind the people and great music are the bones of a solid pub.   Brutopia isn't large but the L-shape makes it feel like a number of distinct areas. Upstairs is more of a get away area, more isolated from the music and a great place for those deep talks that beer brings with it.   Downstairs is the stage - usually occupied nightly- with a good sound system that reaches all corners. There's a tiny floor for performance so the tables are right up against the singers of front of house musicians. Upstairs has split ledges and railings to watch the bands and there's full service so you don't need to leave your seat. Don't expect vies of the band though.   The house brewed beers cover a good range of styles and are characterized by bolder flavors. I prefer the honey blonde over the raspberry or chocolate stout that many locals seem to love. There's an oxymoronic dark pale ale and seasonals.    Take advantage of the $5 happy hour specials. Food options cover all corners of the world and are served quickly and piping hot. Food is well prepared and the servers don't mix up food between tables.   Staff are friendly and efficient, they run you a tab and keep a good eye out so your glass isn't empty for long. Good for their bottom line but also nice to not have to keep catching someone's attention."}
{"text":"IMPRESSED! Cozy & fun atmosphere makes you feel right welcome and part of Montreal, not like a tourist.  Their in house brews were good, plenty to choose from and I must say for what seemed to look like a simple bar food menu turned out to be very impressive on all accounts. From Fries, Burgers & Onion Rings to Quesadillas and tacos to Edemame and Samosas. Everything was tasty, fresh and quick!  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"We grabbed some quick beers and food here on our first night in Montreal. Service was so-so, but the food and drink made up for the waiting. Chipotle chicken sandwich was fantastic - I could have eaten a whole 'nother one. Beer was decent - although I can't remember what it was as I was a bit foggy from the long drive. Atmosphere was okay - we sat outside and enjoyed the ambiance."}
{"text":"Spent 10 days in town, visited many beer bars,by far and away my favourite. Great beer created and served by people who care.A very friendly place,became our local for our vacation ."}
{"text":"Great space, prompt service, good fare, and live music.  Great for gathering friends. Reasonable prices."}
{"text":"I went there by pure luck, for some unknown reason this bar didn't inspire me for years.   However, I was pleasentely surprised !! The beer brewed at Brutopia is definitively worth it. I got a chocolate stout but the real surprise is the food I got the samosas they were good. A friend ordered the chicken quesadillas and it felt like a \"dream night snack\", it was soooo goood.   When we went there was a live show so that's definitively a big plus for the place.  I will go again!"}
{"text":"Located on a side street off the busy shopping area of Ste. Catherine, Brutopia had great pub grub and house brews.  The sandwiches are so hearty and filling that you don't mind they done come with a side of fries.  The raspberry and nut brown house beers were very good and I also enjoyed the local St. Ambrose Apricot.  Yummy,"}
{"text":"So I came here a year ago totally forgot to write a review, its  a place to come with a group of friends, I'm from L.A and I was visiting family in Montreal. The crowd was very friendly , made alot of friends that I still talk to, the drinks are strong and good prices , the fries are amazing. The staff is tight."}
{"text":"Mel, our server, was great. Kept coming over to check up on us, made sure we knew of the good places around.   The beer was tasty, shots were cheap, overall everyone was quite nice.   Unfortunately, we have to give it one star due to our terrible experience with the bouncer. He said we had 5 minutes to leave at the end of the night, and, instead of waiting for us to finish our beers and giving us those 5 minutes, he proceeded to TAKE THEM OUT OF OUR HANDS and toss them. Apparently he has a different perception of 5 minutes than we do. That's an insanely rude way to treat your customers.   In short, overall, a nice place, but don't go spending your money here close to closing time. What a ridiculously terrible experience at an otherwise enjoyable establishment. Pity."}
{"text":"Classic dive bar, which is a good thing. The servers were friendly and welcoming, and it had a really cozy feel (even though it smells like beer has been being spilled on the floor from day one). We actually did get food, the Pepito and the guacamole and both were very good. Stick with the mexican cuisine. If you're looking for a low-key fun place this is a good bet."}
{"text":"Excellent bar. I'm giving it a 5 stars mostly because of how my experience with the service was. I'd accidentally knocked down my drink shortly after receiving it and the server (very nice girl, forgot her name but she was awesome) got me another right away. I only found out when she brought the bills that she hadn't charged me for the second drink (definitely thought they would). That was a really pleasant surprise. Tipped her very well for it. She was very friendly and helpful. I'd definitely go again."}
{"text":"My favourite pub. Perfect for Concordia students or people looking for a casual place to unwind downtown. Their beer is delicious and inexpensive. The music is good and the trivia night is great. I always end up back here!"}
{"text":"I've been here several times over the last few years on several different visits to Montreal. Each time I've thoroughly enjoyed my visit here. The place is extremely chill and laid back, with lots of nooks and crannies to sit in. The food is pretty good for bar food, and they even have several good vegetarian options. Beer is quite good, with several seasonals on offer in addition to the regular brews. The relaxed vibe and friendly staff ensure a great visit every time."}
{"text":"On October 11, was my first time going out. I turned 18 2 days prior to that day. Like every 18 year Olds I went out to clubbing first to see what it is about and was pretty disappointed. The first club was people around the age of 30,35 dressed as young 18 years old. The second was young people my age sniffing coke and having sex in the bathroom. The third was a small club , where I found out was a pickup bar, where old young weird guy flirt with you. finally I had enough and went with some of my friends on the other side and went to this pub. I couldn't believe it. It was awesome. good blues music, great beer and also great people. at the end of the night, my feelings of that night changed because of that pub and I recommend it to many people."}
{"text":"Back in Toronto and I'm still thinking about those tacos. The food, the beer and the prices are why I went back the next night. The 5 stars are because our server strongly recommended we stay for the artist/band, Shane Murphy. Man, what an incredibly talented and entertaining band! We grabbed a spot on the balcony which was a great spot to drink and watch a band from. I highly recommend you check out Shane Murphy when he's playing at Brutopia, and/or just checking out Brutopia when you can."}
{"text":"Bien que Brutopia soit l'une des microbrasseries les plus populaires du centre-ville de Montréal, il m'a fallu trop de temps avant d'y mettre enfin les pieds. Jusqu'à la semaine dernière, je ne la connaissais que très vaguement de nom, et n'avais entendu que des commentaires plus ou moins élogieux à son égard. J'ai donc décidé d'aller vérifier par moi-même. Et quoi de mieux que d'aller dans un bar le soir d'une joute de hockey pour  tester son ambiance? Ce n'est pas le meilleur endroit pour regarder le hockey cependant; la partie est présentée en sourdine, musique branchée en arrière-fond... Un lundi soir tout de même bien occupé...et ce n'est pas comme si la place était restreinte; écrans plats, tables, tabourets et banquettes se déploient sur 3 étages... Je n'imagine pas les fins de semaine... Ses murs de briques et son éclairage tamisé, sa musique versatile, sa cuisine d'amuse-gueules et tapas, son ambiance bien urbaine; toutes ces caractéristiques attirent une clientèle très variée qui se compose linguistiquement d'au moins 60% d'anglophones. J'ai quand même réussi à me faire servir en français, ce qui dans le cas contraire, m'aurait franchement offusqué...  Entourée de pubs irlandais de renom, Brutopia a de la pression en ceci qu'elle se doit d'offrir des bonnes bières naturelles brassées à l'ancienne sur place afin de rivaliser avec les bars dits plus \"commerciaux\". Côté bières, j'ai été agréablement surpris. La brasserie utilise principalement des malts canadiens et y ajoutent des spécialités britanniques afin de créer une palette gustative distinguée. Je me suis pris une succulente pinte d'IPA au reflet ocre, que mon palais a grandement appréciée; un va-et-vient constant entre la douce amertume et la teneur maltée d'une bière réussie. Je me suis lancé par la suite sur un verre de Nut Brown (seulement 2,40$!!!), au nez évident de café moka, et au goût particulièrement prononcé de noisettes grillées. C'était presque du Nutella liquide... 5 bières sont offertes en permanence, et 3 bières s'ajoutent aux couleurs des quatre saisons...  -L'hiver, ne pas prendre un siège à proximité de la terrasse extérieure pour fumeurs. La porte s'ouvre continuellement et ça peut finir par déranger sérieusement. -Trois terrasses sont ouvertes l'été. -Plusieurs événements artistiques et spectacles musicaux ont lieu presque quotidiennement."}
{"text":"I'm not a big beer fan but the BF is so when visiting Montreal we found out about this place and since it was within walking distance we decided to give it a try. I'm not going to judge the beer because to me they all taste the same (a sin, I know) but my boyfriend enjoyed them. I had the pesto et fromage de chevre, the goat cheese was extra creamy and the pesto gave it a special tang, in all the sandwich was divine. My boyfriend had the cochinita sandwich and it lacked a little spice. Our waitress was awesome and the place has a really friendly enviroment. If I lived in Montreal I would definitely hang out here"}
{"text":"After arriving to Montreal late on a Friday night we wanted to scope out the bar scene near our hotel. Our concierge directed us to Rue Crescent where we would find many bars for a Friday night out. One of the first bars we walked by was Brutopia. It was cold out and it sounded interesting so we went in. Upon walking in we noticed some very drunk groups of people who we were slightly nervous would spill their drinks on us if we stood near them. So we headed upstairs to the second floor where there weren't many people. The bartenders were friendly and provided good service. The band playing was really awesome which created a really fun atmosphere. It was a fun place to stop in for a good beer and live music."}
{"text":"Good live music. Beers weren't really my style. Great ambiance. Seemed like a college bar. Lots of people in their early 20's."}
{"text":"I love this bar.  Or more particularly, I love Monday Trivia nights at Brutopia.  My friends came almost every week in between September and May, just to participate in the weekly competition.  Trivia night consist of two rounds of ten questions posed by a caller at the front of the bar.  Participants form teams of 3-5 and do their very best to answer the questions.  At the end of each round, the team with the most correct answers is gifted with four free pints of Brutopia beer.  It's wonderful.  It's delightful. It's an opportunity to display your personal collection of random, useless facts which nobody else cares that your know.  Brutopia also has a wide selection of house and seasonal beers.  My favorites include the ginger beer, chocolate stout, raspberry beer, and the honey brown.  In addition to beers, you can also get a \"Bear Fight\" for about $8 a go.  If you aren't familiar with a Bear Fight, I suggest you goggle it under \"bear fight alcohol\".  I was introduced to this drink by the waitress at Brutopia; if you ask nicely, she may do a round with you.   Speaking of the staff, the late-night Monday crew is great.  They create a homey, relaxed atmosphere and are quick to bring drinks or food.  The fries are really good (and I'm not a big fry person), but you have to ask for mayo.  The chorizo nachos are great and the chicken sandwich has a faithful following among my friends.  Overall, it's a great place for a casual night out."}
{"text":"Bière= Très bonne et avec une bonne variété ! Bière au miel, bière aux framboises, IPA, STOUT etc .. Plus les spéciaux qui sont toujours excellents !   L'ambiance est bonne, bar anglophone type Pub avec très souvent un concert ! La nourriture est bonne sans êtres excellent, mais bon c'est un pub tu y va pour un repas \"classe\" ...  Le service est cool, la seule fois ou j'ai eu un souci (oublie de la serveuse de ma commande) j'ai reçu une bière gratuite. Ce qui est quand même rare au final !  Le plus pour moi est le prix, vraiment pas chère par rapport aux autres micro-brasseries au final vues la qualité de la bière l !"}
{"text":"Brutopia, how I love it: let me count the ways.  First, it did away with pretention and instead embraced quality in food, drinks, service and music.  Second, it serves the most impeccably brewed craft beers in town. Aside from its staple fare of IPA, raspberry, honey brown, nut brown and extra blonde Brutopia offers its patrons an array of 5 or 6 seasonal beers that are a pleasure to drink.  Third, Brutopia's music choice shuns the commercial rubbish that pop charts have been feeding us for the past decade. When it isn't live music at the exactly right volume, it is a mellow mix of classic rock with some interspersed awesomeness from other genres. At last, welcome to a bar that isn't just for teenagers on a slosh mission or gossip addicts.   Fourth, the ambience and decor are a world unto themselves. The darker hues (matched by the paintings) entice you into a dimension where chill is cool and in-your-face is so out, you wouldn't see it fleeing with a binocular. Brutopia makes me feel I don't need to impress anyone, and this seems to rub off on the patrons too.   Fifth, Brutopia's patrons seem to have been sifted through a very fine sieve before being allowed through the door. Somehow, the crowd seems smarter and more mature than in your average Crescent watering hole. I may be mistaken, but you should see for yourself.  What else can I say about the finest brewpub in Montreal? Come and check it out. They have plenty of space and the terrace is a really nice spot to have a relaxed drink. The servers are always fun to chat to, have a smile at the ready and a ton of recommendations for you if you can't make your mind up.  If I didn't live quite far from it, I'd be in Brutopia every day."}
{"text":"Oh yeah had a great time here! I had a few different beers on tap and some were good. Don't remember which ones I tried so don't ask lol.  The band that was playing there Friday night 8-24-12 were awesome, they really rocked out."}
{"text":"Go for the live music (every night!) and stay for the service and the beer and the food! Personal faves include Shane Murphy, Nut Brown, 1/2 Raspberry 1/2 chocolate stout, the samosas and the Cochinita!"}
{"text":"Husby and I came here Monday night.  We were trying to find this place amongst all the other bars on Rue Crescent.  It was raining and we were walking back and forth trying to find Brutopia's sign- it's kinda hard to spot but we eventually saw it.  We walked up the stairs from the street and came inside.  They were pretty busy already, with one of the World Cup games getting an encore airing.  Also, it was Trivia Night and there seemed to be some regulars already setting up camp at the tables.  People were playing dominoes and just hanging out.  Tons of groups, mostly college-age kids and twenty- and thirty-somethings.  Trivia Night was fun.  As you might've read, there are 2 rounds of 10 questions each.  The winners of each round get 4 beers.  (Un)fortunately, I'm not that geeky and didn't win.  :(  The other draw was that there was some live jazz playing downstairs.  This was during the Jazz Festival in Montreal, so I don't know if this is a regular occurrence.  The beers are good.  I had a honey ale and a blonde.  I liked the blonde better.  Wish I could speak more of it, but I'm not really a beer connoisseur.    We ordered the chorizo nachos- just say no!  I must be spoiled for being from California or something, but these were just weird.  :P  You can't even taste the chorizo, and instead of a normal red salsa or even just pico de gallo, there was some red sauce on it, like marinara.  Blech!  Stick to drinking the beer, and probably just order something fried, my friends.  Other than that low note, I could really dig the atmosphere and could imagine myself coming here now and again for the other theme nights if I were a local."}
{"text":"Great place. Nice staff, chill environment. Maybe the best imperial ipa I've ever had. The galactic empire is awesome. 4 days in town I went back 3 times to drink that beer. Cheap too."}
{"text":"Very chilled place for a pint (they have great cider on tap). Casual place to meet up with friends."}
{"text":"One of the places to be on a weekend night! Located on Rue Crescent, it is one of the best places to get the night started. The live performances are always great and it's obvious that the performers are giving it 110% The house beers are all exceptional, especially the extra blonde, Overall, the environment is phenomenal and the staff is quite friendly! If you are looking for a good live music bar to go with your friends I would definitely check this out first."}
{"text":"Nice brew pub on Rue Crescent. They have a nice selection of brews and our server was nice enough to give us a tasting of a few different beers to help us decide what we wanted. It's a chill spot and has a nice terrace or terrasse area (as they call it in Montreal). Try the Ginger Wheat beer!"}
{"text":"Having spent many nights at Brutopia over 5+ years in Montreal you will find tasty food with tasty beer to water it down. I haven't been able to track down any comparable scotch ales on the US West Coast: microbrew central (though I have been pushing several breweries out here to give a scotch ale a shot). A real shame, but it only means I have to come back from San Francisco to visit Brutopia more often. Honey/nut beers for different palettes and the classic raspberry blonde for those who may not be committed beer drinkers. They put a twist on their scotch ale in the Winter at minimum.  I've had their burger, the quesadilla (can be vegetarian friendly) and their fries. All quite tasty.  You can find trivia & live music, patio (open even during some of the winter for smokers), 2nd bar upstairs when it gets crowded and a spacious downstairs with coat hangers and you guessed it, a 3rd bar! As I recall they have cheap beer days (happy hour prices all day - Monday?) and happy hour prices until maybe 7 or 8pm on other days? I'm sure someone else can verify that in another review unless they changed that along with their renovation ~1 year ago (they opened up the main bar and back room where they brew some of their beer. Great idea though they did replace the actual wooden bar with a new surface... meh as a young old timer).  Go visit with friends, have a great time. Come back for more!"}
{"text":"It's an ok bar, certainly one of the best in the neighbourhood but it's nothing special.  They brew their own beer, again, it's fine but not the best.   If you're stuck downtown, this is a good bet but there's several other brew-pubs with better beer.   The food is edible but over-priced and nothing special.  Overall, you won't have a bad time at Brutopia but there are better options."}
{"text":"Good place to come when you're starting out in the craft beer scene.  All of their beer is a safe bet.  Great nacho platter for snacking and typical pub food for a light supper. All in all worth the parking hassle or just a quick walk from the Guy steet metro stop."}
{"text":"Cool microbrewpub, they did a great job on the couple beers I tried. The place is dark and the service is somewhat slow. Trivia started, so we bolted, but I woul dhave stayed longer."}
{"text":"Cool,downtown Mtl bar with good location and reputation. I went there for house beers and found them all green tasting, possibly rushed to meet demand in summer. I have not been back but I'd like to go."}
{"text":"This place has good beer and most times the live music is great. Love the atmosphere, it's one of our favorite pubs downtown. The only thing is that the bar doesnt accept debit cards so you have to have cash on hand or use the atm outside which is very costly. Other than that no complaints. Very laid back and an awesome place to chill and have good beer."}
{"text":"We enjoyed our light dinner here. Neither the wife or I are big beer drinkers. I had the honey beer, which was fine, not too sweet or anything.  The service was spotty. It was dead, and still took forever to get water and drinks!! But this seems to be the norm out of the USA, so whatever. The waitress was really nice, and recommended things. I had the pulled pork sandwich and it was one of the best I ever had. The aoili and guac really added to the sandwich.  It seems like a bit of a dump, but I guess it gets rockin' on the weekends and you would not notice. But we had a nice time, no complaints. We asked the waitress where SHE would eat out of the touristy area, and she gave us some great suggestions up in the Mont Royal area. Nice of her to do that.  You won't be disappointed here, but how anyone rates it 5 stars is beyond me. Its just a little bar with some decent food!"}
{"text":"Great Ambiance...Service is on the slower side: wings were EXCELLENT (homemade BBQ sauce is a MUST try) they have 7ish in house brewed the 4 we tried were banging. We got lucky enough to come on a Friday night and listened to The Muddy Wheel. Come check this place out for yourselves."}
{"text":"Your basic run of the mill dive bar.  The beer on tap was just ok nothing to brag about.  There was outside seating on the upper deck which was cool but tiny.  The inside felt super dive like and almost dirty.  Service is slow or you have to help yourself, and just order at the bar."}
{"text":"Chill bar right in the center of downtown on Crescent street. Came here as part of the micro brewery passport with a friend,  and it's actually become their go to place downtown for no frills affordable beer. They have a good selection and some interesting flavours to try out."}
{"text":"Je suis allée lors d'un Trivia Night et ce fut vraiment amusant. L'animateur est sympathique et sait mettre l'ambiance dans le bar! Bel endroit chaleureux!"}
{"text":"This is a nice pub to visit. Located in downtown core. So, it could be a great addition to your pub crawl. The beer is decent and they have live music every night. They have five regular beers..of them my favourites are Nutty Brown Ale and Raspberry blonde. They have some seasonals too. I would go there more for the music than for their beer."}
{"text":"Très belle ambiance en grande partie grâce au groupe qui jouait ce soir 'The One Love Project' Globalement personnel absent mais nous avons passé une excellente soirée autour de cocktails classiques et très bon. Une fois de plus le groupe qui jouait était vraiment bon et a largement contribué à la soirée. Je ne sais pas ce que cela vaut sans le band. Tarifs abordables et bonnes bières... à refaire pour se forger une opinion définitive."}
{"text":"Very misleading title! Change it! Not a tapas bar, just because you write the word \"tapas\" on a menu doesnt mean its tapas ---IN NO WORLD IS AN ORDER OF ONION RINGS OR FRENCH FRIES \"TAPAS\"!   This is a good place for a beer. Great stout. Food looks blah but didnt even try so not writing bad about it. At your own risk on that."}
{"text":"Great beer and atmosphere. Not the best food, but we were never there to eat :)  Fridays you can listen to some live music."}
{"text":"Potential but the selection, in my opinion, was very poor.  When I went with a couple of friends a year ago, they told me they didn't even have pitchers and I had to order pints. PINTS?!? I'm 6'2 210lbs, Eastern European, Future engineer AND single. I have 4 things \"going on for me\" that make me a heavyweight drinking buddy. A pint is like water to me! How can a place that has a homemade brewed beer NOT have pitchers?  Didn't stay long since my group decided to hit MadHatter but the atmosphere seemed INSANE. I saw someone pour beer from his mug from the top of the staircase into the mouth of a girl standing near the bar while everyone was cheering on! Holy Weinershnitzel!  Food: Didn't have any, so I can't judge. Service: 6/10, the bar downstairs only had a rookie that had a hard time with the beer tap. Price: 8/10 typical downtown prices really. Atmosphere: SOLID 10/10. Insane! Also nice decor and if you don't want the crazyness that I witnessed on the first floor, you can always go in the basement which seems to be often vacant. NOW, I'm not sure if such events happen often but the staff didn't seem to mind which, in my opinion means they were accustomed to it."}
{"text":"This is the only place on Cresent Street I would even dare go into.    Cresent is like the Jersey Shore - full of annoying tourists that are badly dressed and too drunk to deal with.  But Brutopia seems to attract a different set of people.  Its a huge place with tons of nooks and crannies to hang out with friends.  Their beer is pretty good too.  They had various varieties to appease all tastes.  The staff was nice and helpful and the prices were fine.  There was live music upstairs and downstairs too.  It's a pretty hip little joint, that isn't very little at all."}
{"text":"What a great easy going bar in downtown Montreal. Brutopia brews their own  beer and has quite a variety of different beers. My favorite were the cherry wheat and honey ale. They also have IPAs and porters along with about 12 different rotating taps.  The place is also a lot bigger than it seems with an outside area in the back, shuffle board upstairs along with a hidden dining area and a basement bar. They had live music when we went on a Saturday and you can watch the band from an upstairs viewing area as well. Very reasonably priced, a beer was about $5 -$6 Canadian dollars and shots were $4. This place has a mix of a dive bar and pub feel and our bartender was awesome. She was very friendly and joking around with the bachelor giving him a hard time.   Overall if I lived in Montreal, this would be my regular go to spot."}
{"text":"The service was fast and friendly, and the waitress was knowledgeable about their seasonal brews. I read some not great things about their food but I enjoyed the food I ate, as well as their beer.  My friend ordered the burger, I was told it was good but the patty was on the smaller side. I ordered the goat cheese sandwich for $10.45 - that was delicious! We also ordered a flight of beers ($1.74 per cup) and tried the honey, nut, raspberry (very fruity), and hemp seasonal beer. Though I enjoyed them all, the nut was a favorite."}
{"text":"Craft brews are very good, made on site. Good quality pub food, tasty, not greasy, and you get mayo with the fries. Very reasonable prices, quality product, friendly staff adds up to excellent value!! Casual relaxed atmosphere. I plan to come back soon."}
{"text":"I really like this place. The beer was really good, food was tasty and fresh. The only negative is that they gave me grief about bringing my 4 month old, who did not make a peep, in (the server was nice, but the manager apparently had an issue with it). I could definitely understand if it were busy, but it was 7:00 p.m. on a Monday and we were basically the only people in there. That said, I thought this place was great and would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Brutopia is a very, very cool place to drink.  Maybe that's because as we ascended the stairs, there was a group sitting on the patio singing and playing guitar.  The song: \"Disarm\" by The Smashing Pumpkins.  My friends wanted to keep drinking (from a mini-pub crawl day) and smoke cigars, so we went to the back terrace.  There were a few patrons who quickly cleared the area when we came back and we dominated this place for well over an hour.  Our waitress (I didn't catch her name, but she was very cute and looked like Meg White from The White Stripes) was very sweet and did not mind our noise or the mess we were making with the french fries.  I hung out all the way in the back and munched on some very tasty samosas; I didn't care for the sweet sauce (and would have preferred a spicy green one), but they were very satisfying and helped me with my afternoon craving, since we had a light lunch and were snacking all day.  There's a tremendous beer selection and the atmosphere could not be any more easy-going.  This place is next to, and above, other bars -- so be sure to check out Brutopia for a guaranteed good time."}
{"text":"Was looking forward to a visit, but was disappointed in the beer.  It's definitely got a more intimate vibe than the bars further up on Crescent - but I was also hoping to be blown away by the beer they brew.  I wasn't.  Didn't try the food or see any one else being served so can't comment on that."}
{"text":"\"They can make beer with that?\" were the first words I said when walking into Brutopia, almost every time.  From honey, raspberry to spices, their unique in-house beers are sure to please even the pickiest of beer aficionados. If you're lucky enough, you may even catch a live band while you're their."}
{"text":"2nd time in Montreal and i had to make a stop here.....try the Apricot beer and you'll love me for it."}
{"text":"The beers are great. Unfortunately it had to been the most disgusting food I had ever eaten. The natchos are topped with squeeze a cheese and a maranara like sauce. I ended up getting food poisoning afterwards."}
{"text":"I just visited Montreal again - and I still dig this place. The beer & food is delicious.....I had the Bru Burger (made of beef, ham and pork) along with a few IPA's. Again, like last time, we walked around, but ended up back here at the end of the night. Service is super friendly!"}
{"text":"Brewtopia is cool when you want a rowdy Crescent Street night on the town. They brew a lot of their own beer here; the IPA is pretty good. The heated terrace is nice and they have live music regularly. There are a lot of suburban West-Islanders and Eastern Townships folk that frequent this pub. I suppose that's okay. I on the other hand have practically never left the island and rarely go father west than N.D.G. but to each his own. Crescent Street is alright but I'm more of a Saint-Laurent type."}
{"text":"It's great to have a decent brew pub downtown. The Nut Brown Ale was indeed \"nutty\" as described. Low carbonation, sweet, and low on the bitterness. I really enjoyed it. I also took a sip of my friend's Cherry Wheat (a seasonal brew) and it had a pretty awesome authentic cherry flavour and aroma - great refreshing fruity beer.  Usually my expectations for pub nachos is low so I was pleasantly surprised by the chorizo nachos. It came with a good amount of melted cheese, salsa, and what looked at first like ground meat. The toppings resembled more they stuff you put on a Michigan dog than salsa, so it wasn't dry, over-baked, or too salty. In fact it was creamy and quite tasty. Portion is appropriate for one person and for the price paid. The samosas are a bit overrated in my opinion - good sauce but the pieces themselves don't really step up much above wholesale school bake-sale samosas if you know what I'm talking about.  Great place. Convenient, terrasse, decent beer and at least one decent munchie."}
{"text":"Moi qui est fan de bière ...j'ai bien aimé, mais ce n'est pas le meilleur endroit de bière artisanale. La bière au framboise, beaucoup trop sucré, ne vous attendez pas à goûter une bière comme la Mort Subite. La honey Brown par contre excellente. J'ai pris du guacamole, le guacamole boff...Les croustilles excellentes! Il manquait le band je crois, pour que je donne un 4*, il manquait un petit peu d'ambiance pour un jeudi soir.   Par contre, le staff...d'une gentillesse incroyable!!"}
{"text":"This was one of the many watering taps around our airbnb.  After a hot Summer day, why not continue the party.  Stumbling in round 7 or 8pm.  I was greeted by Marina from behind the bar.  5 shots of Tequila for 18.50 was on the menu.  1 shot for me, and the rest for party.  Bang, bang, bang, bang.Collected the shot glasses and refilled for another 18.50.  Katherin started her shift, sweet young lady with the small piercing in her nose.  These ladies put up with the noise and the cheers.  From the ouside looking, its not flashy, no glitzy lights.  These bars are for one reason and one reason alone.  Making memories.  No bouncer needed, no dress code, no entry fee.  Its your purist come in, drink, be merry.  The company and small conversation with various poisons at your disposal.  Montreal....can do no wrong!"}
{"text":"Not a bad bar, and at least going here didn't give off the douchey vibe I felt from the other bars that were nearby. Not a bad selection of beers, either. If you must hit a bar in the immediate area, this one isn't a bad bet. Though I had bar experiences in other parts of Montreal that were better(i.e. Dieu du Ciel).  Didn't try any food here, so I have no clue how that aspect is like."}
{"text":"Bonne bière artisanale faite maison  Petite terrasse sympa, on discute facilement avec les autres clients Bonne ambiance Et un service très agréable, comme toujours à Montréal"}
{"text":"Our last night in Montreal my hubby and I decided to try Brutopia over Dieu de Ciel. Turns out that was the wrong decision. The atmosphere here is very college  bar-y and the beers we had were plain bad. The IPA lacked any of the hoppiness that you would typically find in that style of beer. It was drinkable though. The extra blonde, on the other hand, was not. According to my husband, it tasted like corn chips. We only drank about half the pint before we decided life is way too short to drink crappy beer. Luckily our night wasn't a bust as we found ourselves on the terrace at Le Sainte-Elizabeth Pub with some good Canadian beer."}
{"text":"I'm giving them 3 stars for the little seating in the back which is key since the place does get super packed. Used to go there with one of my old friends wasn't my fav he loved it tho so only reason I went. There's better places but I guess if u go on a quiet night you're set lol"}
{"text":"Quand j'ai entendu mon amie parler d'un bar sur Crescent et que je n'étais super habillée pour le genre de bar auquel je pensais aller, je me suis finalement ravisée en entrant. Un style intérieur à la Irish pub, des petites tables à 4, différents styles de monde, une bière framboises succulente!  J'ai également mangé un plat d'édamamé (super bons!) ainsi qu'un plat de quesedillas aux champignons succulant!   L'atmosphère est convivial et sans prétention. Un endroit où l'on se sent à l'aise facilement!"}
{"text":"Had a great time here while visiting for a long weekend.  The house beers were very good, though the IPA could use some tweaking.  Very friendly staff as well--probably some of the best we had in Montreal.  I'll *definitely* come back if I'm ever in town again."}
{"text":"I got the Cuban sandwich; meat was like chewing leather.   The pouting was spiced with cinnamon which is odd but still ok; not like Smokes in Ottawa.  Beer is decent and the atmosphere is good; an ok beer pace to go before a game at the Bell Center."}
{"text":"Affordable prices, great beer, and awesome Bloody Caesars. The bartenders are really friendly and welcoming. Good live music at night. Would highly recommend to anyone new to Montreal. Didn't have to wait long for drinks or food."}
{"text":"I feel like a lot of people give this place a hard time.  To that I say, give it a chance.  I love Brutopia.  Their microbrews are delicious and there is one for everybody.  I know some beer snobs who say they'd much prefer the taste of the microbrews at so and so place and so forth, but really, as a perfect of example of the average beer drinker, I can tell you that there is a beer for EVERYBODY here.  I can inhale the yeast out of an extra blonde like you wouldn't believe; also there's also a microbrew at Brutopia called the extra blonde which is incredibly tasty.  Yes, that was a tasteless joke.  Know what isn't tasteless though?  Their awesome beer.  I know most Anglophones reading this won't care, but I come here a lot with Francophones who cannot speak any English, and I'm always delighted to see that the staff force themselves to speak French (even though sometimes it is obvious that they have a hard time, they always put in the effort).  They are always civil, patient, and polite as hell.  I cannot say the same for many other bars on Crescent.  The prices are about right for the microbrews.  Not too cheap, not too pricey.  They also host cute little shows a lot with a variety of different types of acts.  I went once and it was country, another time it was funk.  Anyway, it's a pretty sweet place, so next time you're in the neighbourhood and have an hour to kill and get that hankering for some happy juice, go check Brutopia out."}
{"text":"Dropped by for a quick meal by myself to unwind after a long day at the office. Grabbed a pint of their house brewed IPA. It was crisp and smooth with a good amount hops.   Ordered the Pepito Sandwich, which was 2 thin grilled steak on a ciabatta bread. It was topped with pico de gallo salsa and refried beans, which added a nice freshness to the sandwich. The steak was a bit tough but fortunately, I have sharp teeth so I chewed through it fine. The sandwiches don't come with a side so I ordered onion rings on the side. I prefer the option of ordering my own side so it turned out well. The onion rings came out hot and super crispy. It was the thin kind with a crunchier batter.   Service was great and food was yummy. Bill came up to $24 after tax for beer, sandwich, and rings. Overall, good food and beer at a great deal."}
{"text":"Nice bartender, decent beer selection, very divey space that could probably use a little bit of a spruce up.Seems like this place might have more character than most of the other bars on the block, but that could be more of a statement on the area than this specific bar. Drinks here are cheap, which is a big plus, and it seems like it could be pretty fun with the right crowd. I noticed a shuffleboard table up by the restrooms which is always a plus, but no one was playing when I was there."}
{"text":"Had a nut brown ale that they brew and it was not good.  I love beer and only drank half the pint.  Do not understand how this place got 4/5 stars as a brew pub."}
{"text":"Went there two nights Feb 20 and 21 2009 when visiting Montreal. First night it was me and one friend. I ordered a chocolate stout and it was great. Then I ordered a Guiness. The choc stout must have had a good amount of alcohol because I had felt a bit wrecked the next day. And I'm a lightweight.  I liked that you could get name brand beer in addition to their house brewed ones. The atmosphere was good too save for the paintings of people with gas masks on the walls which were oddly interspersed with paintings of trains.  The next night I went back with a bachelor party. I decided to pick up a round of shots we did when we go there. I figured I would get screwed but they had a special, 5 shots for $18.50 which is cheap as far as shots go.   I really liked Brutopia. I would go there again next time I am in Montreal."}
{"text":"One of the best pubs on Crescent - a street full of... well... pubs! I have been here twice with groups, and one time just sat on the bar with my girlfriend. This is a very big place, with several rooms, a back patio, and a downstairs bar as well, which is a bit more on the mellow side. They usually have a few beers on tap (covering a range from blond, through IPA, to stout, and a few more in between). Tonight they had nothing on cask - but they do have the taps - so maybe next time? Happy hour is until 8 pm,  the pints are $5.50, and the cute bartender downstairs was not a stickler about it even when it was a few minutes past 8.  The owner seems like a genuinely nice guy! This wouldn't normally be my choice of pub, but when someone else is organizing a meetup, I don't mind showing up here!"}
{"text":"Great dicey place to have a beer. lots of ales. Honey Blonde this evening was spot on. Great atmosphere and laid back setting.  With F1 here I walked from the hotel - it was a smart choice traffic is crazy."}
{"text":"Very busy place, you need to elbow your way around to get a table and get the attention of a waiter. Having said that, their beers are good, if you like watery soft beers and the food was okay. Go for Happy hour, cheaper is better!"}
{"text":"Nice little bar with shuffleboard upstairs. A little beat up shuffleboard but still fun. Beers were really nice and the prices reasonable. Good friendly staff."}
{"text":"Hardly utopian for this beer fan. Nice ambiance, on hip lower rue Crescent, and a nice mix in the crowd.  Ordered the IPA on the recommendation of the very good bartender. What a disappointment -- virtually flavorless. Not what I'd expect of an IPA at all. Probably should have tried something else, but I just moved on.  Oh, and like other independent brewpubs in Montreal - cash only. Boo for the business traveler."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Great atmosphere and beer!  Food is very good (if not fairly basic) but fresh ingredients (and really that's what it's all about)"}
{"text":"Great spot to drop in, grab a beer and have a bite. I had the burger, fries and a calarmari plate which I shared. Their calarmari (surprisingly) was really good. The burger had some sort of pesto/cream cheese dressing on it which was also really good. The beer is what you go for, though. Great selection of either in-house, domestic or imported beers. Added bonus is the great live music!"}
{"text":"After the band finished I got into a conversation about Andrei Rublev at three am with the drummer."}
{"text":"Very nice place to have a good local beer. The price is cheap compared to the quality of the beer. I ordered one blonde, one IPA and one with honey and all of them were pretty good. I indicate the salsiccia as appetizer. At night the bar usually has shows, we watched one country music with a talented girl."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar both times I came here, and have to say it was the favourite place I went to while in the city (which is why I came back again before heading home to Toronto).   I was on the hunt for craft beer since the previous 2 dinners were at Molson product serving bars. Started with a Raspberry Blonde beer which has just the right fruity hints without being a full on fruity beer. Then moved on to the IPA which is a fantasticly smooth but hoppy concoction that gets full marks.  Then the food came out. The wings were pretty good, but I had a pulled pork sandwich with avocado and aioli on it which makes me wonder why I've never had this flavour combination before. So good, that when I returned I had them custom make an order of nachos with pulled pork and avocado on them (with less impressive results, but thats what you get when you order custom things not on the menu, and kudos to them willing to adapt on my request).  Friendly people in the place not afraid to make small talk, with a majoritively good mix of music in the background (tons of sing along type 90's rock tunes, a sprinkling of hip hop, and the occasional classic from across the genre boards), nice bartenders, and good food. They even have one of those shuffleboard tables upstairs by the bathrooms. I havent seen one of those things in eons. Whats not to love about this place? 5 STARS!"}
{"text":"Nice neighborhood type bar.  Friendly patrons and staff.  Beer selection can't compare to bars in CA but not bad.  Went for happy hour and had a decent pale ale."}
{"text":"Get into town, get checked in and then come here for a beer.  That's what I did and I don't regret it.  This is a great little joint with lots of good beer and a great dark atmosphere.  Not sure how it would go in the winter but it was a perfect place to get out of the heat of the day and enjoy a pint.  There are some tables outside and two floors of little tables to sit and and chat with friends.  Really liked their chocolate stout.  I know, not really a summer beer, but I can't resist a good dark stout.  Came here a couple of times and would make it a regular if I lived in the area.    I have to say though, the stairs in the winter must be hell to use after you've had a few pints.  Even tricky in the summer after a couple."}
{"text":"Loved the happy hour pricing and the selection, the food choices however didn't encourage staying. Clearly a local hangout that welcomes tourists. The value for the quality of the beer however is excellent and makes up for the menu being meh. Stop in for a pint or two and go try something else for food. Nice bar and good service."}
{"text":"Such great beer.  After listening to my fellow Americans and many Europeans scoff at the best Canada has to offer on tap, this place was such a welcome change.  They had unique seasonal beers with creative names, things like Maple Cream and a Chocolate Stout with some winter theme-y title.  I got the Honey Brown Ale, and it was wonderful.  My boyfriend's IPA was strong and bitter like an IPA should be.  I wish I had tried more, although given my size that would have certainly ended badly for all involved.  They don't have poutine on the menu, but they do have regular fries, as well as guacamole and nachos, both with house-made chips, that can satisfy that salty craving.  The menu items are usually around 10$CA.  We had a little trouble finding a table big enough for our party (and I do mean party), and the one we got was really close to the live band playing... very, very loudly.  Well! But loudly.  You had to shout to carry on a conversation with the one person sitting next to you, and too bad if anyone else wanted to be included.  They'd best learn to read lips, stat.  Easily the best beers we had in Montreal, in terms of both selection and taste.  And the place has a pun for a name!  What more could you hops for?"}
{"text":"What a great bar with really good finger foods.   We went on a Friday night  for beers and food.  I am not a huge beer fan but enjoy some of them  I had a Honey beer which was quite good and very large.  My Husband had a Brown beer, which he enjoyed.  We ordered some finger foods to go with the beer.  We ordered the Humus & Pita, Fries, and Beef Tacos.  The Humus was really good, lots of sesame flavor, which we love, and the serving was very large.  The Fries were ok, I would not order them again,  but them I'm not a huge fries fan.  My Husband, who is kind of a Fries snob, didn't like them very much.  The Tacos,  which I agreed to because my Husband likes them, were outstanding.  These aren't the hard shell greasy ground beef type, the three of them are on a soft shells and are actual beef strips marinated in some type of seasonings  with sauteed onions, and came with sour cream, salsa and guacamole which was served in a small side dish.  OMG, I could have eaten a dozen of them.  We ate and finished our beers and got some more beers.  This time, I got the Raspberry flavored beer and my Husband got the Dreadnought.  My first beer was better but this was drinkable.  The service was prompt and pleasant, and the bill was $45.00.  Totally worth a visit."}
{"text":"Brutopia has an interesting layout- that is, the way the tables are set out. it appears to be an older building so that might relate to the layout. There are 3 floors so there's a lot of space, however it was still difficult to find a table at first as it was busy.  There's a selection of house beers, some of which are seasonal. I opted for a raspberry house beer, which was just ok.  Service was really slow, it took a while for any service. Maybe it was just a really busy night, but this place is just ok, nothing exceptional."}
{"text":"Hanging out with friends several times,both the beer and the price are good. A cozy place to relax and enjoy beer."}
{"text":"Chill vibe... good beers... and good food. Came here because it was pouring in the summer. We enjoyed our time even if it there was no live music at the moment. Still cool."}
{"text":"They have strawberry blonde beer, and chocolate stout.  I don't know if I was feeling light headed from the alcohol, or from feeling dreamy-eyes over the hot servers."}
{"text":"Let me start this out by saying I am not a beer drinker.  For some reason  my body doesn't like it.  Knowing that it is a great place for non beer drinkers to get to know  beer and for beer lovers to experience some awesome beer. Feeling super girly I went with the cherry beer, but their hoppy stuff is really great and really hoppy , if you are into that kind of thing.   What I love, is amazing staff that know their ish. I love that you can try a beer before getting a pint and the bartenders  which are super awesome are actually really  helpful  at helping you choose. Now that of course should be a given  for any place that makes their own brew  but that's not always the case.   The food does not disapoint. Most  people probably just go there for beer, but check out the food once in a while. Apparently the kitchen staff is mostly Mexican, and it shows as they do Mexican right. Properly layed nacho plater with incredients deep in the centre not just sprinkled on top. Awesome guacamole  that  doesn't have a gross drippy  texture."}
{"text":"Brutopia est un brouepub dont les bières sont d'inspiration anglaise et dont les employés ne parlent pas un mot de français. Leurs bières se démarquent très peu, mais sont quand même bonnes. J'ai apprécié leur Indian Pale Ale, quoique que j'en ai goûté des meilleures et des plus houblonnées. Point positif, le prix au verre est très abordable, d'autant plus que ce bar est situé en plein centre-ville de Montréal. Donc, un brouepub qui n'est pas sans intérêt, si vous avez soif et passez devant, mais qui ne vaut pas forcément le détour."}
{"text":"This quickly became my favorite bar! Very friendly with a nicely mixed crowd. This is for people who care more about good beer, great service and wonderful live music. It's not a posh \"who's who\" kinda' place. Each of the bands mingled between sets (one band a night ... we were there a lot).   Mixed drinks were generous! All the other bars are using those silly contraptions - these guys pour them the old school way!   Also has 3 different seating areas and plenty of space for different sized groups. We mostly stuck around the main bar and stage though.   There is a recessed area upstairs that has box-style seating right above the band - it's pretty cool! The band often looks up and interacts so you won't be forgotten."}
{"text":"We were told that this place was awesome, and it did not disappoint.  Got a seat a the first level bar and sampled their nut brown ale.  It was very good.  The beer wasn't too heavy or fragrant.  I ended up having many.  The food was good as well.  Had the Bruburger which was a beef/pork/ham mix.  It was very tasty.    The bar itself was fun.  There were people all over, we even met some people who lived near us.  The bartender was great and we had a fantastic time."}
{"text":"Bottom Line: inconsistent quality in the house brews, terrible food. Go to Dieu du Ciel or L'Amer a Boire if you want good beer in Montreal.  A friend and I were in Montreal for the weekend and looking for some good local beers (as we always do). This street was close to our hotel and had alot of night spots on it, so first two night we went there, and on the second one ended up at this place.  We had two good beers there, the rest ranged from less than impressive to horrible. The good ones were a non-house Hemp beer (that reminded me of a rauch bier but with hemp smell instead of wood smoke) and their house Honey Brown. We also had some sort of stout that was passable but not good, and a god-aweful Framboise that my friend said tasted like soap.  We nearly gave up on the beer scene in Montreal until we met a very friendly bar tender at Pub L'ile Noire that set us on the right path."}
{"text":"Yup.  They have beer.  Go here or don't it's not special, better than the 3 brewers.  A bit too popular at this point."}
{"text":"My favorite spot on all of Crescent street.  Any time I'm staying downtown Montreal this is usually the spot I end up at almost every night.  I enjoy their home-brewed selections (although not on the level of Dieu du Ciel or similar brewpubs), but most importantly the people and atmosphere.  It's a friendly environment I've never seen any kind of fist fights or \"beefs\" break out at which is all too common on Crescent as anyone can tell you.  Waitresses are friendly, cute, and all too willing to indulge with shots of hard alcohol with you.  I recommend their seasonal blackout stout, delicious."}
{"text":"Service was great, our waitress was kind and the food was great! We got the shrimp tacos and the fried chicken wings and it was delicious! I would come back if around the area. Drinks were awesome as well"}
{"text":"One of Montreal's best brewpubs! Love their beer selection, great staff and, overall,  a great place to hangout, especially since there are plenty of little nooks and 3 separate floors. It is also a great place to go on crescent if you're looking to go out for a beer downtown without all the tourists - or at least less so.   FYI, it's a really popular hangout for local engineers."}
{"text":"I have been going to Brutopia for years and have always found it to be a staple of Montreal bars. They brew their own beer, which is usually really good except the last few years it feels as if its changed slightly. I always get the honey beer but have tried the others and enjoyed them all. If you go with a large group réserve a section first so that you're not left standing the entire time, especially on hockey nights."}
{"text":"Brutopia is probably my favorite of the local pubs I found during my time in Montreal.  Dark but warm and inviting, it definitely has a local feel to it.  They brew their own beer, and they do a great job of it.  Specifically, I loved the IPA the most but also enjoyed the Nut Brown Ale, as well as another whose name I can't remember (I must have really liked it).  After a few drinks, I decided to check out the menu and a sandwich called the Pepito made its way out to me.  Grilled steak on a baguette (two of my favorite things) topped with a bean spread and salsa.  Sure, I had had a few drinks, but the sandwich tasted fantastic.  There's no doubt in my mind that they'll see me again on my next visit to Montreal."}
{"text":"I've been going there at least once a month for a long time - it's the default place for me and my friends. Everyone gets a relatively inexpensive pint of whatever suits their tastebuds and it's nice and cozy (with a cute little terrace in the summer).   As for their beers, the only one I can get really excited about is the Scotch Ale, I really wish it were permanent!  Both the (seasonal) stouts are worth a try as well. Other passable pints include the IPA, nice and bitter, or the Raspberry Blonde, inoffensive.   Lastly, the food is excellent. It's a fine price for Crescent street, and they've got quality stuff. The Pepito sandwich is great, or a nice basket of steamed, salted edamame beans makes a satisfying snack.   PS - Don't count on having normal-volume conversations in the basement past 10PM."}
{"text":"While in Montreal for a friend's bachelor party, we decided to stop into Brutopia as I had heard good things.  We walked in at around 11:30 pm on a Saturday night in August and it was nearly deserted. I was glad we easily found a table but I was hoping for a bigger crowd.   I ordered a Honey beer which was decent enough. I do regret not trying the IPA though as one of my buddies said it was great. We did not order food so I cannot comment on that unfortunately.   Our server was friendly and even supplied our groom-to-be with a free Irish Car Bomb which was very nice. She did stop and chat with us for a bit too. Unfortunately, her shift was ending as we showed up.   The live band left something to be desired. They weren't terrible, but definitely not memorable either.    We stayed for just one round of drinks then we decided to hit another bar with hopes of finding a bigger crowd. I'm not sure if we caught them on an \"off night\" or what but Brutopia did not live up to all the hype I had heard."}
{"text":"Visiting for a week on business. Great local beer! Definitely worth checking out if you're in the area. I recommend the Honey  Brown. They also had a local band playing. Offers seating inside and two balconies."}
{"text":"Brutopia is in kind of a silly district of Montreal. The streets are filled with wasted people, but don't let that detract you. The space itself is pretty big, bigger than it seems on the outside, with a darts area, two levels (one bar per floor), and an awesome overhang to watch the concert stage. The band we caught that night was awesome.  The beer is solid. I stuck the the IPA. I had the cochinita sandwich, which I really liked. It was a bit on the greasy side but all of the flavored melded really well, and the pork was top-notch. My girlfriend had the cubano, which for some reason is not really an authentic cubano sandwich (it comes with avocado and lettuce, on baguette??). She said she enjoyed it.  Would re-visit."}
{"text":"Endroit idéal pour une pinte en fin d'après-midi après le musée des beaux arts. L'endroit n'était pas encore très rempli, mais c'était très bien. Service rapide et agréable, prix tout à fait corrects, et bonnes bières artisanales."}
{"text":"Brutopia was one of the many places I bookmarked before driving to Montreal, so I was really excited to check this place out once I finally got to the city. After finding a spot at the bar downstairs, Jared and I each ordered a pint of the vanilla stout, which was quite strong. We also got an order of the salsiccia and baguette--the bread came toasted and the sausage had a great zing. The decor inside was pretty nondescript, typical for a dive bar, and the bartender was quite friendly with the regulars.   Overall, I really liked it here. The downstairs bar wasn't crowded, the bartender was friendly, and the beer was delicious. After a long day of walking, I was ready to have a quiet night, so Brutopia was the perfect destination. Would certainly make my way here again if I had the chance."}
{"text":"Thank you to the people who organized my work hotel, which happened to be one block from Brutopia.  I liked the vibe and the beer here, so I made a few visits when we were out of work early enough to make last call.  The first time we enjoyed some open mike night, and the second time there was a singer/songwriter performing.  No cover either time.  Good crowd of people that were reasonably friendly.  And super friendly bar staff."}
{"text":"Excellent staff and management..have bit been in years because...I no longer work in the city but was lured back by our Brasserie passport.   Our beer flights were top notch..we are stout lovers so our favourite was the Vanilla and nut stouts ..but I was mad about the Xmas Ale seasonal and ordered an extra pint.  If you are a banana beer fan..try the guest Dum Duminator!   We noshed on gooey chorizo nachos..a great deal in the 8 dollar range. So much topping. Wish I had it now..for breakfast.   The manager chatted with us for awhile..super pleasant. Wish now that we had stayed for the band.   We won't wait so long next time."}
{"text":"Feh.  Yes - I mean 'Feh' not 'Meh' - I'm being dismissive.  To be clear, this joint is perfectly alright as a run-of-the-mill bar.  It's busy and happening with a live band.  And no complainants about the service.  I won't hesitate to recommend it for a casual bar gathering at all.  However, if you enjoy good beer, their house beers are all pretty crap.  If this makes me a 'beer snob' like the other reviews say, then call me a beer sommelier.  Come on - seriously, I ran through their entire selection and they were all barely passable for microbrew.  All the beers had a funky finish - I detect slight negligence on tap cleaning.  If you're not sure, let me tell you: go to Dieu Du Ciel.  I know it's out of the way but it's worth the trip.  Mention DDC to any barkeeper in town and their eyes light up.  But if your plan is to get wasted on Crescent - yup, perfectly fine bar."}
{"text":"Good beer, but I'll have to agree with a previous reviewer - extremely slow service!  And the burger I had was pretty blah.  This was the first place we ate at when we pulled into Montreal.  Big disappointment!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here late on a Sunday afternoon for beer and a snack. The food was only OK. We got the hummus and quesadillas, neither of which were anything special, but their microbrews were great. Tried the Extra Blonde Ale and British IPA. Would recommend both. Staff was friendly and music was good.   Was really slow when but I suspect that was because it was a very rainy Sunday between lunch and dinner. There is a small stage for performances and can see this place being really fun with some live music and more people. Would definitely like to go back when it's a little more lively and enjoy some more of their great brews."}
{"text":"Good people trying to make something that matters in the Montreal community. Jeff and his team both at Bru and at Jane are scrappy and pouring a lot of love and hard work into what they do. Like Hurley's, Brutopia is a haven on lower Crescent but Bru is generally a little younger and more rawkus. There are lots of small corners to tuck into, and sitting near the shiny brassy beer-making apparatus always makes me feel cozy. The food and beer might not be always superfoodie accolade winning, but for those of us just looking for good heart and a tasty good time somewhere away from tight pants and hairspray that dominates much of this strip, especially during F1, Brutopia is gold. The layout is pretty great for live music and quiz nights and open mics too; intimate but with a lofty upstairs perch that feels almost old timey."}
{"text":"We went here reasonably early in the evening after a long day at the botanical gardens. It was nice and quiet.  The staff was friendly. The patrons were friendly too! I think they were even playing \"Lounge against the Machine\" as a nice touch.  I had the honey beer which was quite palatable, and my friend had a smoky porter which was slightly more to my taste that evening. Luckily, he is friendly, as well!  I will definitely be back for the Maple Rousse seasonal in a little while."}
{"text":"Great potential but there is something about it that has always been \"off\" for me. Great venue for acoustic shows but the service has continued to be hit or miss.  Food:  n/a Service:  7/10 Price:  8/10 Atmosphere: 9/10"}
{"text":"Nice place, usually quiet. The beer is decent, the prices are reasonable, however they don't have a very big selection.  They don't really speak french there. Not a problem for me, but just a heads up for the franco clientele"}
{"text":"Brutopia was a great find (thanks again yelpers!) for our first night exploring Montreal. Parking in the area was tough to find though not impossible on a Friday night, but once we were in Brutopia, we were glad we had stuck it out. I sampled the dark IPA and the house IPA and ended up sticking with the regular, while I literally gobbled down a cubano. I was starving and it was very satisfying. Bartenders were nice, waitresses were chatty and cute, and even a music snob like myself really loved the band that we caught. Ladies, beware of the bathroom. The giant door will hit you if anyone enters while you're washing your hands. But get over it. Worth it."}
{"text":"Brutopia had 5 of their beers on tap when we went. We tried the brown, the honey, and the honey brown. All were fairly disappointing -- not very flavorful at all. Food is typical pub grub and is not expensive. We got nachos for $7. They were pretty tasty although the salsa was marinara and the only toppings were cheese and sour cream. The two bartenders were very nice and attentive. Vibe is mellow. Patrons appeared to be mix of locals and tourists."}
{"text":"Absolutley appalling seasonal beer and very good fish and chips"}
{"text":"Je ne suis pas type bière, mais je suis allée dans ce pub une fois avec mon mari et des amis pour un 5 à 7. Il y a un bon choix de bières et d'alcool. Les prix sont raisonnables. On peut aussi y manger, il y a une cuisine. Le choix de mets est typique de ce type d'établissement: nachos, ailes de poulet, etc.   La serveuse était assez gentille, l'ambiance était feutrée et sombre et la musique était raisonnable, donc on pouvait se parler sans crier à s'en briser les cordes vocales, ce que j'apprécie grandement quand je suis avec des copains!"}
{"text":"Great place downtown for craft beer. Menu is decent, and the staff is always friendly. Unfortunately, it's on crescent across from a hotel that never fails to have obnoxious tourists yelling from the balcony, so that takes away from the outdoor seating somewhat."}
{"text":"Brutopia is a really great place for s beer and for live music.  Went here on a whim because a)close to our hotel and b) its a brewpub and I love brew pubs and I am glad we did.    We came later in the evening, arriving around 11 for a drink or two and discovered that a band was playing.  The place was not really busy at that point so we managed to find a place upstairs.   The upstairs bar setup is really great for concerts because they have a balcony right overlooking the music.  There are also ledges you can lean on and watch the band, the acoustics are also quote good.  For beer, their but brown ale and their IPA are both good while my girlfriend has a raspberry wheat ale she liked.   Our waitress was also excellent, very friendly and enthusiastic, really good service at a busy bar, unfortunately I forgot her name but she was excellent.  Overall a top notch place to have a pint and listen to some music."}
{"text":"TLDR: Fantastic microbrews and equally fantastic servers.  We arrived at the bar just after 9 pm on a Saturday when they open the upstairs seating. The bartender was really sweet, and when I asked about the beers she offered for me to try them before I ordered the whole pint. I was debating between the raspberry and the honey brews, and after trying the two I went with the honey. The raspberry was a little too perfumy for me, and the honey really came through in the honey beer. We nursed our beers to the sound of awesome music and while watching the hockey game on the TVs  The beers and service were great. Unfortunately, a couple who were obsessed with PDA decided to sit at the end of the table. As we left, we noticed that this was the case for a few other tables as well. I would definitely recommend this place, but beware that if you go upstairs you may be surrounded by couples making out!"}
{"text":"Had a few beers here before a Habs game. Beers good, food whatever. Had a burger that was a big, thick, gray patty. I think there was cream cheese on my burger. Probably not the best thing to get there."}
{"text":"Awesome in house beer , great atmosphere combined with the best Mexican food ( made by the lovely and talented Bonita)in Canada"}
{"text":"One would not know about this place since it's not directly located on Cresent Street, but I highly recommend going here!"}
{"text":"OK Let's forget this place. Bad food, horrible service and just another shitty pub on Crescent."}
{"text":"$7 for a pint of Oatmeal Stout. Very delicious! Cozy and warm environment with a lively scene on the ground floor with more of an open space upstairs."}
{"text":"A less then stellar brew pub on a less then stellar street. If you want a good brew pub do yourself the favor of going to Dieu du Ciel (out of the way but well worth it).  This place is over priced with watery beers, don't go. Oh and the live music is usually not very good."}
{"text":"Gord and I like brew pubs and craft beer so we checked out Brutopia;  They make their beer onsite.  I ordered a Raspberry Blonde and liked it.  Gord had a pale ale and a dark pale ale and he thought they were okay.  JazzLee was our server.  She was friendly and took good care of us."}
{"text":"I just love beers here in Québec, I tried a lot and I am always willing to try more.  That's why I came here, with lots of expectation ... And.... Well... Meh...  I tried two and I really wasn't impressed.   I guess I can give it another go and trie some other beers from here, but I was also a bit disappointed by the lack of choice, not so many beers available on tap, compared to some other breweries."}
{"text":"very good brew pub. all of the in house beers have a similar after taste which isn't a bad thing, I just thought it was worth mentioning. they probably just use the same yeast for the majority of their beers. friendly staff for the most part. the bouncer was a little bit douchy to us and tried to make us pay for our cover charge again. the ink ran out on the stamper they were using so they marked our wrists with a B with a sharpie. instead of asking the guy at the front if this was true he initially tried to tell us we had to leave until the bartender informed him that we were telling the truth. other than that it was a pleasant experience. there was a good folk duo playing music, good beer, and a friendly atmosphere. the patrons were all very nice as well. average age in the bar id say was about 25-35. unfortunately we got there after the kitchen had closed so I cant make any comment on the food."}
{"text":"La bière du Brutopia est excellente. C'est une des micro-brasseries que j'aime le plus à Montréal. L'endroit est pas très large, surtout le main floor, mais ce bar a 3 niveaux et une terasse en arrière.  J'aime l'idée des live shows, quizz et open mics. Par contre, ça rend l'endroit vraiment bruyant. Il y a un menu quand même varié et c'est une petite \"coche de plus\" que la nourriture des bars habituels. J'ai pas beacoup exploré mais les sandwichs(style panini) et les nachos au chorizo sont tous les 2 excellents.   Pourquoi pas olus que 4 étoiles? J'adore leurs bières, la bouffe est bonne, la musique aussi mais j'ai de la misère à trouver un âme à cet endroit. La place est étroite après quelque personnes et pour moi c'est un gros point négatif parce que je suis fait sur le long alors je suis un peu \"pogné\". Malgré tout, c'est un très bonne place pour prendre une bière et les speciaux sur les drinks et shooters sont pas chère."}
{"text":"Stopped in because we heard the live music, music was good, prices are decent, would have been better if their beer was more enjoyable."}
{"text":"Great little pub with decent food and awesome crafts beers. Our bartender was hilarious, definitely made the experience memorable. Great jumping off point before heading out for the night."}
{"text":"Fresh microbrew is sweet. The brown ale was the best. Atmosphere is cool. Bartender was cute. Food was not so great  I could have made that chicken quesadilla at home in about 15 minutes. It was pretty cheap tho...$8.85"}
{"text":"When I first heard the name \"Brutopia\", it was hard not to imagine a heaven blanketed with beer head clouds, cherubs descending with pitchers overflowing with liquid gold. To my disappointment, the stairway I ascended didn't lead to a heaven. However, the dusty wooden planks clued me in that this was a different sort of pleasure - this was a full-on dive bar.  Brutopia was like all dive bars should be - dark, over-heated and smelling of dust and good times passed. We found the one table with as few wet glass rings as we could and were greeted by a server. She was a sweetheart and introduced us to the bar's chalkboard, listing the place's homemade brews in yellow and blue chalk. Though the names weren't very descriptive, our server made sure to describe what each brew was like. There was something for everyone at our table.  I ended up going with the white ale. Now I'm always a little nervous when it comes to small brews, but this beer was absolutely wonderful. Didn't taste cheap or carelessly made. It wasn't long before everyone at my table was passing their beers to the right, having a sip of each one. There wasn't a single crappy sip.   This place is great for a low-key night out with friends. They have bands play on weekend nights and the place gets packed for that. Don't bring a first date here if you've decided to iron out your fancy pants.  And they give you itemized, separate checks. This place was made for groups of 3 or more."}
{"text":"I came here with a group of friends in search of a bar with good beer to relax in and watch the World Cup.  We tried a bunch of their beers - my favorite (which was my favorite microbrew I tried during our 3 days in Montreal) was their honey brown ale.  It had this great honey flavor without being to sweet. Other than an order of French fries we didn't try the food, but I would definitely go back for a few more beers."}
{"text":"I have to go mid stars on this one. This was definitely my kind of place, i just wish we would have made it here before the crowd began! If you get a spot early you are good. Highly recommended. If you go a little earlier than midnight, it is hard to get served. I would visit again when I go back to Montreal."}
{"text":"Always a staple for my beer needs when visiting Montreal. I came during happy hour and planned on trying some of their happy hour specials. I ordered the IPA beer and was not very impressed. Each sip began with a good hoppy bitterness, but each sip also had an overwhelmingly metallic finish.   As for our snack, I was very unimpressed...We had ordered nachos but what we got were decent tortilla chips with pasta sauce and cheese. I think because of the salsa (more like sauce), it was definitely some of the worst nachos I have tried.   I have had better experiences here before, just by ordering other beers. Their raspberry blonde and honey beer are much better brews. This was my first experience trying their food and if this is any indication of how the rest of the menu tastes, it cant be good."}
{"text":"Was in town for a conference but arrived a day ahead of everyone else so I had a solo dining experience. Searched for brewpubs near the hotel on yelp and this place came up - and I am glad it did! I walked in, sat at the bar and was promptly served. Generally I am scornful of Canadian beers ad they can be too mellow - Canadian IPAs drink like American Pale Ales, everything is a category off, flavor-wise.  Not at this place! Full flavored and delicious stouts and IIPAs - well worth the walk. I had some sort of taco (recommended by the bar tender) and it was a great choice. If you like beer, need a bite to eat and are in the area this is absolutely a place to check out."}
{"text":"Great ambiance, beer was decent. Parking is a nightmare on a Friday night -- but I can't hold that against the establishment. Would definitely give it another whirl next time I'm up there."}
{"text":"I like this bar. It has some live music and interesting selection of beers like raspberry blonde beer or winter beer or honey beer. This bar is one of those bars for the experimental adventurous types. This bar seems popular."}
{"text":"Went here for a bachelor party and had a decent time. Strange setup as there is a large downstairs area as well as two average sized outdoor spaces at this pub.   Didn't try the food but others expressed that they liked it.   It's directly across from a Quality/Comfort Inn with balconies so that can provide some entertainment if you're sitting out front."}
{"text":"This is a cozy relaxed pub right in the heart of downtown. They have two floors and lots of seating even for groups. They serve food and drinks with a decent sized list of beers  cocktails etc You definitely don't come here for a gourmet meal but for a no frills casual happy hour with some good cheap drinks and snacks this place is a good choice. I had their honey beer and some others had their chocolate stout beer both were very good and worth the price ! we also ordered a few snacks (chorizo quesadillas, onion rings , hummus and pita , poutine , nachos) the food was tasty and reasonably priced/ portioned and hit the spot to go well with the beer. We had great service and a fun time with a lively atmosphere that didn't feel overcrowded and hectic. They also had a band come in a little later in the night and even with the band we were still able to talk to eachother comfortably without it being overly loud. I would definitely come back here again."}
{"text":"Some claim Hurley's Irish pub to the THE SPOT on bishop in Montreal, perhaps, but Brutopia is a very strong contender.  Don't let the name fool you, yes it doesn't sound like a very Irish put kinda name, but they have the live bands, a large selection of home brews great food and 2 floors.  Definitely worth a visit the next time your due for a pint of the black stuff."}
{"text":"We popped in here for a quick snack right after checking into the hotel. It was about 5pm on a Monday and it was pretty dead except for a few people at the bar. I say this because it took a while for the server to come over and drop off menus. Then, it took a while for her to come take our order. Then, it took a while for her to bring the check.   Anyway, I ordered the Honey Beer and it was refreshing with a hint of honey. I definitely didn't feel like I was drinking a Mead or anything because it was so well balanced. We ordered some calamari and wings to share and they were pretty good. They weren't knock out fantastic but they accomplished the task of satisfying hunger.  It looked like they do a lot of live shows here and it definitely seemed like a cool place to catch a show.   3.5"}
{"text":"Brutopia is good for beer, but stop there.  Love that they brew their own stuff.  IPA had a good amount of hops and bite.  Reasonably priced at $5 during happy hour. Stay away from food.  First sign should have been that the food menu is labeled as an \"international menu\" and has everything from samosas to edamame.  what bar in montreal has food but doesn't have poutine?!  we ordered the chorizo nachos which was a terrible idea.  soggy nachos without flavor and ground chorizo instead of nice chunks on top.  ugh.  overall, my mistake on the food.  avoid the food.  stick to the beer.  you'll be pleased."}
{"text":"Awesome selection (by the looks of it), buy I can say the Scotch Ale is delicious.   Prices are fair, a/c is cool.  Small patio out front.  Shuffleboard."}
{"text":"I've been here a nice handful of times, just for drinks. I'm a big fan of their home brewed beers, I always get their honey or raspberry blonde. Their ales are smooth, rich in flavor and distinctively aromatic. The raspberry has a sweet scent without being overpowering, making it my favorite. Happy hour is everyday before 8 pm, a pint will cost you just under 5$.  I've never tried the food here but if you're hungry there's your typical bar menu, appetizers like wings and nachos, sandwiches and quesadillas.  Consisting of 3 bars over 3 floors, Brutopia is a great place to get together as groups since seating is plentiful. The lower floor is my favorite with a mix of tables and big comfy couches. It's an unpretentious pub, where the decor is drab but those who come here aren't interested in ambiance - enjoy what they do best, cheers to beer.  Working wifi would be a plus."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and comfortable environment. But, the name is a little miss leading, the beer is super light and basic."}
{"text":"What a great place for New Year's lunch.  It appeared that nearly everything else in Montreal was closed. So to find this dive bar open and inviting was a wonderful treat.  The service and music was great.  The chocolate stout seasonal was appropriate for the cold snowy day.  The food and IPA disappointed, but was easily overcome by the convivial atmosphere and the REAL PINTS!   Why, oh why, cant we find more places with real pints.  Vive Brutopia for your real pints and good music.  This is a fun place!"}
{"text":"OK so this is a bar that has a lot of different craft beers.  We were walking around getting our own craft beers all over Montreal drinking (And staying drunk) for the afternoon and this was our first stop.  Unfortunately they were out of the blond that was supposed to be amazing, but we ended up have 2 other beers that were really delicious.  A dark and a lighter one.  I can't remember what they were but they were good.  The place wasn't busy as we were there in the mid day and the place looked like it would be a pretty chill place to hang out and it could get crowded.  So take that for what it's worth.  We headed out not too long after."}
{"text":"First, I am only reviewing the beer here. Second as this is subjective, I'm going to attempt to be as objective as possible. Finally, the California in me influences this, but I am not reviewing it versus that.  Brutopia certainly has a varied selection of beers. As for the styles, there's nothing out of the norm for you're east coast fare. This isn't a bad thing for Brutopia. The execution on the offers they do make are great. The IPA is a stand out, and one of my favourites in Montreal. I should clarify, it is an IPA, it is NOT a west coast IPA as many Americans have come to view the style.  The Nut Brown Ale, is to style, flawless in execution. Brutopia produces very clean, very palatable beers. The staff is friendly, the crowd is good, albeit on the younger side.    A solid choice for a night out with friends, I do prefer visiting on non-weekend days due to it being a bit quieter. But that doesn't remove this from being a top choice in Montreal breweries."}
{"text":"This is a pretty easy going bar, like a few other yelpers have mentioned, but it gets loud and roudy on the weekend nights. We didn't stay to long - only came here for a drink after a concert, so I don't know how the service or vibe is. But I definitely had to yell to my partner to get a word in, so we decided this wasn't the place for us. But worth a try if you're in the area and that's your type of bar!"}
{"text":"We wanted a chill place to enjoy some beers after our long drive to Montreal, and Brutopia was the perfect place for that!   I got the oatmeal stout and the pale ale. The oatmeal stout was so creamy and delicious. It honestly tasted like a milkshake to me! The pale ale was crisp and fresh, a nice contrast to my stout. I was really impressed with the beer flavors and quality, and I was super happy that we stumbled into the bar during happy hour! Beers are $5 before 8pm, take advantage of it!  Service was great and really friendly. I enjoyed my time here and I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"The tacos and quesadillas are what you would think real mexican food should taste like. The beer is selection is both varied and drinkable. The prices are reasonable. Definitely, better than your average pub."}
{"text":"We made our way to the second floor bar by dodging and avoiding the very young, still in high school or college crowd.  The bar was too small for this size crowd, or this aged couple, but the bartenders were skilled at remembering who approached the bar first and filled the order as fast as possible.  We had the strawberry blonde beer, $7, and loved it.  We made our way back downstairs and found a chair for some awesome people watching. The teenage/college aged people were a mix between grunge and hipster, and the hair styles/clothing styles were fun to observe.  There were a few people in our age bracket (30's) so it was an interesting mix.  They had decent live acoustic music, but we wanted to experience more of the city, so off we went to continue our night.  This seemed to be a great place for a group to go and chill out, as long as you found a table or didn't mind standing."}
{"text":"Fabulous brewpub with tasty on-site brewed beers. Reasonably priced. We were there late afternoon/early evening. At that hour it was a quiet-friendly pub. Looks as though it could get quite lively given daily circumstances, like live music. In the general neighborhood of the Bell Center-hockey game or concert. I would be pleased to have it in my neighborhood."}
{"text":"Coin sympa sur Crescent. Service rapide et chaleureux. Prix très raisonnables. Très tranquille ce soir. Le guacamole est délicieux. Portions généreuses de tout. La musique est cependant éclectique et parfois trop métal à mon goût. Nice spot on Crescent; Fast and friendly service; good pricing and large plates of everything. The music is somewhat heavy metal which is a little too much for my taste."}
{"text":"Don't be fooled -listen to those who recommend Dieu du Ciel. The beer is not very good and the atmosphere is sort of unclean, college bar."}
{"text":"Great selection of beer with wonderful, down to earth service. Live bands every night and a fun night scene. The food is better than average bar food, loved the brushetta. I would recommend the upstairs bar."}
{"text":"Well, I certainly wouldn't call it a Brutopia if it just has a small selection of beers. They tasted ok, but if you're thinking that you're coming here to try a lot of different artisanal beers or anything like that, you're misguided. Friendly staff, and the location and venue itself is good, but was just let down by the beer selection."}
{"text":"Brutopia is rocking a dive bar aesthetic, and is excelling at it.   I've visited Brutopia a number of times and on every visit the selection of draft has been noticeably ahead of the curve in terms of Quebec beer culture. Hop and beer varieties trending internationally seem to pop up on the radar of Brutopia a year or two before other brasseries catch on.   Brutopia's staff have also been excellent on every visit. A surprise group of 14? No problem Brutopia's staff taxes it in stride.   I will be back!"}
{"text":"I think of this place, and I think of myself fighting the urge to vomit on my 7 hour trip back to Boston the next day. A sure sign the drinks were cold and plentiful!   7 of us crashed here on Sunday night of Presidents Day weekend. We got the back room pretty much all to ourselves, and the waitress never forgot about us. Had she, maybe my headache would have been spared the next day.   The drinks kept coming and she did a decent job at keeping it all straight as to who got what (the french normally do separate tabs for each person).   The band was good, I think, but for the most part we were too busy talking about I-don't-know and taking photos.   4 Stars to this place for not kicking our obnoxious group out!"}
