{"text":"The food is okay at best. Definitely not the best pizza as I failed to taste any love in it. They are made by young an inexperienced chefs who lacked direction. You can see them working the oven from the dinning room. Service was awfully slow and unfriendly. We were a group of 8 and even though the restaurant was half empty, service was laborious from end to finish. Our table lacked attention and we had our entrees served way to late.

At the end of the service, I noticed the floor manager and the staff gossiping on us because we were appalled at their 25$ cutting fee for a birthday cake that costs 20$. We had our cake on a little park bench outside the restaurant in the cold. Heartless owners....

Very surprised of the other positive review. 2 stars for great location and great decor."}
{"text":"Service was quite poor. We were a fairly large group but it took fifteen minutes before a server was close enough for me to ask for the bill. When I did, the server told me that everyone else in our group would need to order dessert before I could get my bill. This took an additional 30 minutes. Everyone had received desserts and finished them before there was an opportunity to pay. It took an hour between when I asked for my bill and when I paid.

Food was ok. This place is clearly designed to maximize the number of drinks you order and suffers from style over substance."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner opening week. Smooth service and nice ambiance. We sat on the large patio, peeked around at the huge 2 story dining room inside. Nice high quality touches everywhere. 
Delicious original cocktails. I hear they all have wine as well as liquor. Nice to see originality behind a bar. 
My table shared 3 salads: mushroom, octopus, and beet. All of them were great, and a good size for sharing. The in-house-made pasta was also delicious, cooked al dente as I like it. Didn't have room for dessert, will have to make another visit."}
{"text":"Very cool set up.  Sat upstairs.   I had the lasagna, which was great (not too cheesy).  My g/f had the ravioli, which she loved.    The homemade pop was fantastic too (not too carbonated) - so much so that we order one to go too!   Will definitely return to try other items on the menu.   The wine, which I haven't tried yet, is apparently from the owner's own winery in Cali.   Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"I went there with a large group to celebrate a friend's birthday. Food was average at best. The waitress told us they couldn't do separate bills (fine) and could only split the bill 4 ways. For 12 people. The very self important manager came over and talked forever about how this policy was good for us (spend up service or something). While this policy makes no sense, the bigger problem was that we weren't told and manager was not helpful, or nice, at all. It was a very poor experience, and I'd never go back."}
{"text":"We had 25 people here for dinner after a wedding party rehearsal - everything was fantastic. We talked to Adrian before and he arranged for our group to have a private area on the second floor - it was perfect.  We also selected our wines before hand and ordered appetizers. The bruschetta bombes were awesome and, since people straggled in, they put them in the oven as the tables filled so they all arrived hot.  
Everyone ordered their own dishes and seemed pleased with what they had. I would certainly recommend the venue to anyone who is planning a group event."}
{"text":"First and foremost this place is stunning. The ambiance in the restaurant was perfect. The communal tables are interesting and fun. Food is beyond delicious. A++ on the bolognese pizza. Kindly greeted and periodically asked how dinner was without interrupting the table.  #TwoEntrepreneursApproved"}
{"text":"Fantastic service!

I had to plan a company event and was looking around the GTA for something reasonable for a good price. Our group was about 30 people and the whole time I was in contact with their booking representative they were very accommodating. I was able to change their prefixed menu for different dishes.

They also accommodated the request of 3 alcoholic drinks per person. They situated us upstairs on  the second floor for no extra cost.

Not to mention the food. Delicious! Calamari was a favourite of all and the Carbonara. We did not include pizza with our event menu but employees did order one (meat lover), I couldn't resist and it was delicious. They even ended up ordering another one to take home!

Overall a great experience and I have dealt with many other restaurant who are very reluctant to be so accommodating for a large group.

Hopefully I will have dinner there in a casual setting soon!"}
{"text":"What an innovative and stylish restaurant. The attention to detail is incredible, from the cool water glasses to the whipped espresso sugar. There are great vegetarian options including the heart shaped beet ravioli that was divine. A short wine list but excellent cocktails. I was too full for dessert but maybe next time since they all sounded awesome."}
{"text":"The pros: attractive, high-ceilinged, with lovely open kitchen. Lots of light. Attentive service. The smoked salmon Bomba was delicious and interesting, and the carne pizza was ample and richly flavored. 

The moderates: the televisions are a strange addition. The side-by-side seating against the wall is not as appealing as face-to-face. The calamari was very tender, but extremely pedestrian.  The risotto was obviously at least partially precooked - understandable, considered it's a time-consuming dish - but at the price, it should be less obvious. 

The cons: the interior seating is not disabled/wheelchair friendly. Only two tables  and those chairs are of standard height. The remainder are too tall for someone in a wheelchair to sit at, and awkward for someone with mobility issues so raise themself up to. The patio has plenty of standard seating, fortunately. 

Overall, it's definitely worth trying out. If you have mobility concerns, book ahead and specify that."}
{"text":"4/5! Amazing food. I highly recommend the cavolo Nero (kale salad) to start and the bolognese pizza (meatballs on pizza) and agnolotto (ravioli) pasta as mains! Try the sangria fresca if you are craving a refreshing drink!"}
{"text":"What an amazing experience! Great ambience and decor! But the real treat was the food, wow! Best pizza/crust i've had at any restaurant and delicious wine too!  Try the Bomba and Carmella dessert too!"}
{"text":"This place has a fantastic location right next to the St Lawrence Market and the patio is really nice. For lunch I ordered a beet panini with a name I couldn't pronounce. I loved the sandwich, it was really good with thick slices of red beet, crisp fried  cheese and I think it was pear slices. The service was a little slow but since it was a beautiful summer day on the patio and no one was in a rush this wasn't a big deal. I can't wait to go back and the try some other things on their menu."}
{"text":"We went there for a late lunch today. We were greeted and brought to one of the two regular tables in the whole place since I indicated on the reservation that I was bringing a baby. 
The food was good. 4 stars for the food. We had the bomba con bruschetta, the carne pizza and the spaghetti & meatballs. The bomba con bruschetta was unique and flavourful. The pizza was a little salty but I'm guessing that's because of all the meat. The spaghetti and meatballs was flavourful but I found that there was not enough pasta, too much meat. 
Service and nice but painfully slow even when the restaurant was only half full. 2 stars for service.
All in all, it's a average of 3 stars."}
{"text":"I can't say enough about the service here. It's like all of the servers knew who we were and what we ordered, they all came by to see how we were doing and give their menu recos, told us the background of their wine selection, etc, So attentive, so personal. And the food was great, I recommend the Proscuitto Cotto. And then dessert happened. And my life improved. If you don't order the Caramella, you and I will never be friends."}
{"text":"Love it, been here 3 times already. Unpretentious and delicious! Friendly wait staff, creative dishes, enough depth to the menu to keep everyone happy. Owners is often onsite and very approachable. I am usually a hard ass with reviews and almost never hand out a 5 star review but Pastizza deserves it!"}
{"text":"We have been to Pastizza 4 times now and every time we were impressed with the quality of food and the service. Our last visit was Saturday April 11th, 2015. 
Food: Their Bomba is a must. It's perfect for sharing. Our favourite is the one with prosciutto. They also always give you three oil: mild, medium hot and hot, for dipping. I personally prefer the mild oil. It gives your food a little extra flavour. For main course, I always like the Carbonara or the Uovo pizza.
Wine: Their wines are from California. I think the restaurant's owner imports the wine from his vineyard in California. Something like that. Their wine is very good. 
Service: Every staff we encountered there so far have been wonderful. They are pleasant. Manager Dimitri is always on the floor to help and talk with diners to make sure everyone is pleased with the service and the food. 
Main reason that we keep going back to Pastizza is that the food is good and the service is always top notch."}
{"text":"Went to pastizza on a recent visit to Toronto. Located in the St. Lawerence Market area it is in an amazing location. I had the best meal here. Started out with the bruschetta which the waiter deflates at the table, the bruschetta itself was delicious. The homemade oils to go with the bruschetta were also amazing, but believe me the spicy is spicy!!

I had the margarita pizza which was amazing. Usually when I order pizza in a restaurant it becomes soggy. This wasn't the case. It was perfectly crispy and may be the best pizza I have ever had. 

For dessert I had the Carmella which was good, but too sweet for my liking. 

The overall service was perfection. Waiters were attentive, informative and water refills came like clockwork. They also gave the perfect amount of time before taking orders, something that is rare. 

My first visit to pastizza will definitely not be My last."}
{"text":"Good service great food! Margaritta was quite strong and nice! Pasta portions were a bit small tho"}
{"text":"Nothing special. Would not go back. The ball bruschetta looked unique but was very bland.  I had a chocolate cake for dessert and wanted to add ice cream.  The server said \"no, the chef doesn't like to add things\" after telling me they didn't have any. I was very disappointed. Food was ok. Great area, ambiance of restaurant doesn't fit."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza and service. Cocktails are also well executed. House wine is good value."}
{"text":"Food was very good. Antipasto was beautifully presented and very tasty. It took forever for our entrees to arrive, with no explanation or apologies. Server never asked if we wanted anything to drink."}
{"text":"went here with my wife and her parents. we had the place to ourselves for most of dinner, which i found weird as we had an excellent meal and (possibly from the lack of other customers) had great service. i would recommend this place."}
{"text":"Went here yesterday for my friends birthday and we had a great time!!! All the food was delicious - we started with the mushroom salad and beet salad - yummy!! You have to try the bomba bruschetta - Sooo good!! For the mains we ordered the margherita and uovo pizza - wasn't sure about egg on a pizza but it was absolutely delicious. We also ordered the cauliflower and beet heart pasta - both were cooked perfectly and tasted so good. The portions were a bit small but we managed! Finally desert - the caramello was to die for!!! With a cup of misto it was the perfect way to end the night. Dimitri was lovely and really took care of us. He brought out another desert for us to try and sent over a special one for my friends birthday!! Definitely recommend this place and can't wait to go back and try some more items on the menu!"}
{"text":"I went there two times for lunch.Yummy!
The pizza Carne is really good, and pasta taste fresh too.
Service is fast!"}
{"text":"I had the fungi pizza, my spouse the pizza with asparagus. Lunchtime, not busy, but business being done. Staff plentiful, professional and friendly. 

Pizza may be on the low end of cuisine for some, but I have to say this was one of the best I've had. I've even had pizza in NY City. 

The fungi pizza was accented with truffle oil and just the right amount of fresh, tasty arugula.  The pizza with asparagus was absolutely devine. 

Sparkling water by the bottomless carafe for a buck 50?!  

Atmosphere is high classy, style without stiff. Jazz playing, lighting low but not moody. 

I'll be back, I'll recommend and I'll spread the word."}
{"text":"Went last night with 3 friends for dinner. Service was spot on. I had the warm mushroom salad, delicious, good portion, fresh ingredients. Also had the Vongole. Also a good portion, done to perfection. One other friend had the roast chicken which she loved. The only complaint I had was no bread. which might be a good thing, but I felt I should have had the option. Dimitri explained why and said it might be addressed again in the future. All in all, we loved it, will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great food and ambiance! Amazing place to have a birthday party! Service was a bit slow but they played everything so nicely! Price is also on the higher end."}
{"text":"It's not the greatest Italian dining experience. I'll start with the good stuff. The staff are great and friendly. Our waitress was very nice, and made us feel welcome. The ambiance is really good. The decor is great. The Bomba was phenomenal. I'd recommend it as a starter. However, the soup that I ordered was terrible, as was its presentation. I ordered the prosciutto pizza with blue cheese and my companion ordered the half chicken. The pizza was good , I wouldn't say it was the greatest pizza I've had, but the crust was great, and the portion was more than enough."}
{"text":"We were in the mood for Italian before our movie so we searched for a new place in the neighborhood to check out.  After a debate over two restaurants, Pastizza won out despite reading a few mixed reviews.

Like: The decor of the place is very nice, although our side by side seating arrangement at a bar table was a little awkward for conversation.  Most of our food was pretty good.

Dislike: Service was spotty, almost non-existent during a large portion of the meal.  In fact, the most service we got was walking out of the place when almost every employee hoped we enjoyed our meal.  Where were they when our water needed topping up?  Cocktails were basically shooters based on the glass size, a real disappointment.  And portion size was pretty small, considering the price.

Although we did not hate our experience here, I doubt I would go back again.  Italian is one of those foods you can find anywhere and this likely won't be a place for me to do so again."}
{"text":"Good food. Descent service. Great for groups due to the communal seating. Get the meatball dish. The chicken was good. Very heavy foods. Very good desert. Reasonably priced bottles of wine for under 50. The brochettes were interesting. Had to eat but lots of flavour.  The pizza was very good. Great toppings."}
{"text":"The food and service were amazing! I had the spaghetti pomodoro and me friend had the vegetarian lasagna - delicious!
The caramel dessert was sublime , probably one of the best desserts I've ever had. 
Highly recommend 
Tyler was our server and was very attentive and dimitrii is the manager and also came by our table to check in on our experience."}
{"text":"The beautifully built and decorated building where Pastizza sits, just across the famous Toronto St. Lawrence Market, is a new market street favourite for Foodies Inked. Having opened its doors to Torontonians just 6 months ago, the modern-Italian post by co-owners Paolo Paolini (formerly of Splendido) and Thomas Baker (owner of the Sonoma-area winery Thomas George Estate) is serving up traditional Italian fare with a twist.

Pastizza is eclectic with a mellow ambiance and a terrific wine and cocktails selection. Having one of the owners highly experienced in the vino business is certainly no coincidence at this charming spot. The Pastizza wine label is a crowd favourite; the merlots, pinot noirs and chardonnays sit strategically on the big 30 foot tall custom wine chandelier, hanging at the entrance of the restaurant. This is Pastizza's center-piece where all eyes meet. The owners provide a selection of wine that pairs very well with their menu while keeping our pennies in the wallet and our taste buds enveloped in the sweetness, tanginess and flavour of the grapes in season.

One simply does not go to Pastizza without at least trying one of their salads. Their Caesare salad, representing the Copernicus theory, is plated in a beautiful way. Following the theory that the sun is the center of the universe, Pastizza places a crunchy and salty piece of fried Parmesan cheese on top of the earthy and creamy lettuce leafs, and tops it with a big ray of fire, represented by a bacon strip. I hope the chef thought of it that way when creating this salad, otherwise it just means I've had a bit too much wine while writing this post.

And what will be of Pastizza without the \"izza\"? Or vice versa? Not much really, and this is why pastas and pizzas are a must order when visiting the market street spot. People say one can tell how good an Italian restaurant is by their carbonara pasta. It's a bold statement, but a true one nonetheless. The Carbonara Pasta at Pastizza is clearly one that celebrates this thinking and the chef's skills in the kitchen. The spaghetti dish is made with cracked black pepper, pancetta, onion, white wine, egg and parmesan cheese. The secret, according to Pastizza staff, is to not allow the egg yolk to cook in the pasta, it's a rookie mistake, but one that is made often. So these are added raw at the end and mixed in while the pasta is cooling off, preserving its flavour and consistency. Yes, the eggs are not fully cooked, but let me remind you hollandaise sauce is made similarly, so manga and enjoy!

When it came to pizzas, Pastizza knew exactly what it needed to do to stand out from other pizza joints. The knew they needed to do something different and tasty. And so they journeyed into mastering the art of the pizza crust by using baking dishes with holes that allow for the hot air to risen up the crust faster, making it crunchy and fluffy without over-cooking the dough. Brilliant. One other thing they did right was change up the tomato sauce in some of their menu items. Instead of using a traditional tomato sauce, they used chili paste as the base. The Prosciutto Cotto pizza had this base and it was my favourite menu item of the night. The pizza came with mixed mushrooms, prosciutto cotto, oven dried tomato, basil and Gorgonzola cheese, and of course, the chili paste. To add it it, Dimitri brought to our table 3 kinds of hot oils, from mild to hot. Reminding us Pastizza makes their own hot oils, which just happen to be the perfect addition to any pasta or pizza dish.

To end the meal with a bang and put a sweet end to it, we decided to indulge in some delicious cappuccinos brought to us with an espresso-infused sugar and ordered the Caramella dessert. A decadent caramel/amaretto sticky toffee pudding with almond slivers and vanilla gelato. The pudding came warm and not too sweet while the gelato, which is also home-made, perfectly balanced the amaretto-infused cake.

What a great meal and fantastic experience. A big thank you to Dimitri and the staff at Pastizza for making our night such a delight.

Buen Provecho,
Viviana."}
{"text":"Even though they do not allow substitutions, the food here is absolutely superb... From the bolognese pizza to the kale & caesar salads and salmon. Sadly the wait staff did not follow though on the service end :("}
{"text":"Third time here. Staff super friendly, Dimitri always makes us feel welcome. Food always fresh, restaurant is always bright and clean. Unique (good) surprise in washroom.

I've tried two of the pizzas, Arabiata and Bologese, both excellent. Good Caesar.  The chocolata is to die for."}
{"text":"FYI - Review of the gelato bar ONLY!

Stopped by the gelato window the other day while strolling through the area. This place looks pretty cool and I was excited that they were offing gelato during the summer season! However, I was seriously disappointed for a couple reasons. First, the only flavours available were of the artisan fusion persuasion - strawberry-red pepper, spicy chocolate, lemon-basil, etc. Totally awesome for all the food connoisseurs out there, but I would have expected at least one classic flavour (choc/strawb/vanilla) for the non-adventurous types. If you like the fancy flavours though, then this probably isn't a drawback for you. I took a chance on the mango-lemon. My husband got the cinnamon-espresso and said it tasted like a Tim Horton's ice capp. Both flavours would probably have been fine except that the gelato was completely hard, dried out, grainy, and clearly not fresh. Not sure if the temperature gauge on the freezer unit needed to be adjusted or what... but the server had a lot of difficulty scraping the stuff from the pan into the little cup. It was pretty awkward to watch him struggle with a clearly sub-par product. Also, it was served with wooden forks, which was also pretty strange and made for an awkward eating experience. We didn't even finish ours, we tossed it out at the nearest trash can. If you want a proper gelato experience I would recommend G for Gelato just a couple blocks away at Jarvis and Adelaide. Maybe they could give the Pastizza crew some lessons on how to do it right ;)

As for the regular dining experience, I haven't sampled a meal there yet, but hope to do so in the near future and hope for better results :)"}
{"text":"I decided to check this place out before the Marc Maron show at the Bluma theatre. It was a Sunday evening and it was almost deserted. By the time I was leaving, 4 tables had left and 4 remained. It's a big place so these fluctuations are noticeable.

I decided to order the house red (from a California winery) and the ravioli dish. Heart shaped ravioli, cherry tomatoes, wine sauce and a dollop of pesto. It was actually delicious if a bit of a small dish. 

Professional, smiling and attentive service."}
{"text":"A great random find! 

Beautiful ambience, great servers, amazing tasting Italian food. Reminds of me Italian restaurants in Quebec City. One of the better ones in tdot! 

The beet ravioli was an amazing recommendation from the waitress. The beet juice was infused in the ravioli giving its red colour and it was super cheesy. The lasagna was fresh and flavourful. 

The caramella was a great toffee dessert. The cappuccino hit the spot and they gave liquid brown sugar, which is very different!

The bill came up to $80 for 2 people. Mid range, but definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and great staff.  Dmitri, the manager, does a fantastic job of asking for feedback while building rapport with new customers.  We tried the arabiatta pizza and the ravioli - both delicious.  Try the home made soda's as well!  Ya, I said try the sodas.  Trust me!"}
{"text":"Beautiful space, excellent service but for me the food was just ok. I found many of the dishes to be lacking flavour and nothing is making me want to rush back. I think I may have had high expectations for this place but to me it was just average hence the 3* review."}
{"text":"I've been to Pastizza about 4-5 times now, with different friends in tow each time.

A few items I can vouch for that you should definitely try:
- Funghi pizza (Mixed mushrooms, truffle oil, arugula and fontina)
- Vongole pasta (Casarece, yellow datterini tomatoes, baby clams, roasted garlic and crushed spicy peppers) - it has a kick!
- Guanciale di Manzo (Braised beef cheek, mixed mushroom, roasting jus, smoked gouda potato lasagna and swiss chard)
- Pastizza Margarizza on tap (to drink) (Tromba Tequila Blanco, lime, agave, orange, Pastizza Dolcetto and cucumber wheels)

The pizza is by far my favourite. The arugula served on top of white pizza with the truffle oil drizzled on top has a very savoury flavour that just adds to the taste of the mushrooms and arugula very nicely.

The Margarizza is also a very nice drink with a strong punchy flavour and you can taste the tequila. I enjoyed one of these for the first time during the summer - on their outdoor patio.

I think that this place is still quite hidden from the world - and should be known to more prospective patrons. I would like to see a larger variety of pastas on the men, especially ones that include meats (most that could be seen on the menu didn't appear to have any significant meat portion included in).

I recommend everyone try this place out. I'm sure I will be back again and again."}
{"text":"This place was great!  We started with the bombas which is a fancy way to serve bruschetta and although a bit messy were really good and not too heavy. I had the carbonara which was really good as I find carbonara can be really hit or miss. The service was excellent - our server was engaging and not too busy to chat for a moment and her recommendations were bang on. Great service makes the whole experience better IMO and seems to be lacking in Toronto. 

The inside was really nice and open. Had tv screens so you could follow a playoff game while the girlfriend is distracted with the food! ;)

The patio looked really nice but it was a bit cool even with heaters. 

I'd give it a 4.5 if I could based on food, service, location, and ambiance."}
{"text":"Service..... this place should be a training camp for every server in Toronto. Terrific service with a perfect mix of recommendations and choice.  AMAZING bar and barrister. The food was equally good. The Bombas were the BOMB BOMB great!!!!

The caramellas desert was great too. We came expecting to be there for maybe 90 mins and before we knew it, four hours had passed. Sweet experience. Cannot wait to return. Eight thumbs-up for the four - star experience."}
{"text":"Great food. My group ordered three different pizzas and they were all delicious. The drinks were also delicious, albeit a bit expensive. 

The atmosphere was very comfortable,  very clean and modern looking.however I must say that the place was lacking a personality.It did feel like a generic downtown restaurant.   The waiting staff was friendly and knew the menu well, though not necessarily anything to write home about. 

Would recommend. But not on top of any list"}
{"text":"Not sure why this place wasn't busier.  Perfect equation; price, ambience and taste to die for.  The pizza was awesome. I had the arrabiata.  The oil was misleading though as the medium was hotter than the \"hot\"; great touch.  The meat lasagna was a great combination of flavours.  Apparently the unique taste was a touch of pumpkin (wtf? I'm glad i didn't know). If dessert always tasted like the sticky toffee i would opt for dessert more often."}
{"text":"Just tried the Con Prosciutto Bomba and it was amazing. A must with the habanero chilli oil."}
{"text":"I came here for the first time on a Saturday night to celebrate my birthday. We were a group of 12. While the service was sporadic at times, the waitress was attentive to arriving guests and checked up on us enough to get people whatever they desired. The rest of the staff did great with keeping the table clean, refilling water, getting plates out of the way etc.

The cocktails were crafty and delicious. I've tried the Sangria Fresca and then stuck to a scotch.

As for the food,  the Piccoli Panini (sliders) and Antipasto Misto were awesome shareable appetizers. I had the Cavolo pizza and tried the Prosciutto Cotto pizza, both were great. Everybody else was happy with their food choices as well. None of us got the Bombas but they looked HUGE! Definitely something to try next time. I also got a dessert compliments of the house, which was a nice touch!

Overall, great ambience and food, and a little on the pricey side."}
{"text":"Pastizza was one of those restos lining Market St that I'd always walk by and peek in with curiosity, drawn by the shady patio in particular. The patio was decently sized and adorned with just enough shrubbery to give both privacy and opportunity for people-watching.

I had the Cavolo individual pizza ($20.00) which came with: Basil & pine nut pesto, kale, caramelized onions, sun-dried tomatoes, roasted garlic and asiago. I wasn't overwhelmed by the taste. It was your average pizza and so large that it could have been split between 2 people but the glutton in me ate up to 75% of it before calling it a night. 

What I liked more about the place was the location, the patio and service. Our party of 5 stayed long after dinner was over, with no room left for dessert, and we didn't feel unwelcome. The night had gotten a bit chilly so management switched on a couple of heat-lamps AND gave out Snuggie-like blankets on request. I think the owner (?) dropped by towards the end and asked how everything went, which was a nice touch.

I MIGHT go back to try something else, but not floored by the pizza."}
{"text":"Overall great experience. Bright, open atmosphere. Great service. Some pastas can be made vegan/gluten free. Kale salad is fantastic. Smaller portions but fresh quality ingredients make up for it."}
{"text":"This restaurant invested way too much into decor and ambience instead of adequately hiring enough waiters and chefs.  Went on a weekend and there were only 2 waiters for the entire restaurant.  They were doing the best they could, but I found that other tables including ours kept looking around to try and place anorder.

This place makes Pizza and Pasta.  Both of which cook extremely quickly.  I don't know what the Chefs were doing, but our meals took over an hour to arrive.  I think they waited until after we finished our appetizer before they started making the pizza.  Which is dumb...the appetizer is supposed to give the Chefs time to ensure the main meal arrives once we're done with the app.

I got the funghi pizza and got food poisoning that night. Will not be dining here again.  For the price you pay, I expected way better service from the chefs.  The pizza was so/so...I'd recommend Formosa or Pizzeria Liberato instead...who know how to get pizza out to your table within an hour."}
{"text":"A fantastic newer restaurant on Market St. This was our first time and we are definitely going back, esp. to check out their amazing patio. 
Amazing menu that we are hoping to make our way through it. Wonderful ambiance, great cocktail menu (margaritzza is a must try)! As others commented their \"bombas\" are delish, and so is their truffle mushroom salad or beet with pistachio dressing salad.
As for pizza, it's a great size for sharing, authentic thin crust. We had Arrabbiata and it was to die for.
The only limitation (if I had to name one) is their limited menu, as it consists of wines from their sister winery. 
Other than that great new find and a definite must visit if you're like Italian cuisine or just a night out with friends. 
A must visit this summer!"}
{"text":"Great food, friendly staff and the wine is from the owners own California winery. Try the mushroom soup with five different  mushrooms."}
{"text":"Went to Pastizza first time last night. The weather was getting nicer and the restaurant has a nice patio. 

The decor is very nice. The waiter was very friendly a drink helpful. The 2 of us had a bottle of wine,  2 appertizer, a pizza and a lasagna. It was a lot of food. The Appetizers were very good.  The bruschetta is actually their own unique version. (see photo). The pastrami sliders were delicious. The pizza and pasta were great too. The wine was from the owners' Vineyard in California.

Very good food.  Will definitely go back"}
