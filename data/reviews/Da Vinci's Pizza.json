{"text":"When we moved to Charlotte we was looking for pizza when we found this place. It has now become a once a week outing for me and the kids, and their favorite. They ask every week when we're going."}
{"text":"Worst experience of my life. My family and I typically go to Giacomo's but they were closed so we decided we would try a new place. When we got there it was pretty much empty but every table I tried to sit at was dirty. I eventually ended up cleaning my own table off. We ordered a pizza and wings. The food came in a timely manner. The pizza was almost twice the size of the paper plate so it was unavoidable for the pizza slice to not be all over the table. The \"plate\" was made of thin paper and became drenched in oil from the pizza. The pizza was just average but we did not like the wings so I kindly went to the lady at the cashier and ended up swapping the wings for cheese sticks. The cheese sticks came straight from the freezer (I saw them take it out of the freezer and literally just throw it in the fryer) they had an off taste to them. So I talked to the manager about the appetizer and he looked at me like he was confused. And kept asking me why I did not like them and I said they taste freezer burnt. And again he continued to look at me like I had three heads. He than proceeded to ask me, \"is this your first time\". I don't see how this is relevant to my horrible experience. Are new customers unwanted? Because that is sure how I felt. He was very rude so I asked for a box so that my family and I could leave. He THAN stares at me the whole time while talking to another associate. This was my first and last time I will ever go to Davinci's."}
{"text":"I refuse to order food for my employees here ever again. The take out/delivery orders are always wrong  and their attitude toward customer service is horrible. I ordered delivery for a meeting once and they forgot a persons salad. They told me to come pick one up. Today, they forget to give a receipt. So I call them up and ask if the manager could either fax or email me a copy. They told me that they didn't have the capabilities to do that. I asked if the manager had a smart phone and told the girl if he did then all he had to do is take a picture and text or email it to me. Takes 10 seconds. Again, they refused to do this for me. They told me to come pick up the receipt lol. It's unfortunate that their customer service and nonchalant attitude is this way because the food is actually good. What they need is a owner and manager that cares about their customers. No one is ever there in charge or at least that's what I'm told. Today was the last straw for me. If you don't care about customer service or correct food orders then try it out."}
{"text":"The kids love this place. It reminds us of back home in Brooklyn NY on church ave off of ocean ave."}
{"text":"when you go to a restaurant and spend 80 bucks of your hard earned cash and you ask for a cup of water and they do not give it to you. it happened to me. well that shows what kind of people you are dealing with there pizza is salty and there sauce is thin they are trying really hard to be like NYC pizza but do not cut the mustard.and there service is awful take the family somewhere else steer away from this place."}
{"text":"REAL New York pizza without the trip north. Excellent value, huge slice for the money."}
{"text":"My fianc√© and I are born and raised NYers and everything in NC sucks as far as good pizza, Chinese, Indian etc. but DaVinci's is pretty good. I won't say it's \"authentic NY pizza\" as other reviewers have mentioned, but it's the best we've found aside from Simonetti's (owner is from Long Island and knows what he's doin', but too far to travel to Belmont every time we want a decent slice). Will note that you can't call to order a few \"slices\", as the staff has no clue what that means, but in all fairness can't blame them. Overall, DaVinci's is the most convenient for location and taste. Good work"}
{"text":"Excellent customer service! The food was as I had expected, delicious! I ordered a medium and it was huge! I still have half of the pizza to eat tonight!! I will be back!!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best pizza in the university area!   If you aren't that hungry or a small eater one slice is way a plenty. One slice is $2.70.   I'll be back more than once."}
{"text":"I love this place! I'm here for school and was having trouble finding a place to replace my go-to good, simple pizza and Italian restaurant for study nights. I got delivery and they were quick. I ordered online and someone actually called me to confirm what I had ordered (which was great since I actually clicked the wrong thing on my calzone order). I got a calzone with pepperoni and a garden salad with balsamic. Both were fantastic... the best Italian comfort food. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Awesome pizza, cannolis and fried ravioli! My boyfriend and I eat here at least once a week and when we found it they delivered is was the cherry to our sundae!"}
{"text":"Excellent NY style pizza (by the slice). Also had a cheese steak, which was very Good! Will definitely be back to try other items on their menu."}
{"text":"If i make a stop at least twice a week. U know the pizzas good. Plus they also have student discounts!!!"}
{"text":"My new favorite spot! Great pizza and the slices are huge! I've eaten here almost everyday for the past week"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I loved Da Vinci's pizza. I always order the same thing, pizza and buffalo wings with buffalo sauce (that they ALWAYS forget unless I ask for extra then I only get one) calling to order a pizza for delivery and was told they were not taking anymore orders for delivery. At 7:30pm on a Sunday. Really? I just want to stay in my pajamas and enjoy a pizza. If you take delivery orders until 8, I'm not really sure what the issue is? This happened a few weeks ago on a Saturday as well I went to order a pizza around 6 and the lady that answered tried to talk me out of ordering delivery because it was \" an hour and a half\" wait. That's fine. I don't mind waiting. Are you SURE it could be like 2 hours. That's fine I don't mind waiting. I could almost hear here rolling her eyes over the phone. Well we are really busy and it will be a long wait. Yup, got that, I still don't mind. This place is good, but avoid delivery, it is not worth getting hackled every time you dare say you'd like to place an order for delivery on the weekend. As important as good food is, don't get me wrong the pizza is absolutely AMAZING the customer service is just not worth it. To be fair, the delivery drivers are always super fast and friendly, that  1 1/2 to 2 hour wait? Was less than 30 minutes. But this is just the last time I'll bother calling for delivery, there are plenty of other places that will give you a lot less grief when you'd like a pizza delivered."}
{"text":"Being from NY/NJ might make me super particular but the wings were definitely from a frozen bag and the pizza sauce was tasteless. Not impressed. Customer service was bland and lacked personality nothing to bring me back sadly."}
{"text":"Favorite pizza joint in the University area. Huge slices and very very savory new York style pizza."}
{"text":"This place  has the best cheese steak , I have had yet you need to check them out !!!!!"}
{"text":"Big slices, but not the most impressive place for pizza. Worth a try, but will not be our regular spot for pizza. Price doesn't match quality."}
{"text":"Slices are larger than my face with great value for the portion size given. In my opinion tastes like authentic NY pizza, it's very tasty, not to greasy and don't have any complaints. Having tried the Davis lake location I feel this location is better, the pizza is not burnt and tastes great. Though I will say if ordering to-go call about 20 mins in advance."}
{"text":"These guys know how to make pizza, if your looking for an authentic NY pizza this is the spot you guys should try out their wings also great spot and cheap also."}
{"text":"I haven't found better pizza in Charlotte than DaVinci's.  Their pizza has a perfectly thin and crispy bottom with some chew after the initial crispness.  One slice of plain cheese is enough to fill me up as the slices are enormous.  The girl working the cash register at both locations is so friendly.  She always checks to be sure our pizza is to our liking (we generally order extra crispy) and fixes it if not.  This is the type of employee every business should have.    The garlic knots are also delicious.  VERY garlicky with chunks of fresh garlic caked all over the them.  The outside is crispy and the inside is soft and doughy.    After complaining about the lack of good NY style pizza in Charlotte for years, I have finally found my go-to place."}
{"text":"Highly recommend! By far my favorite pizzeria since we moved to the area. I can honestly say that I enjoy this pizza more than some of the pizzerias in NY, where we originally lived. The slices are massive, and very filling. The sauce is amazing. We have also ordered wings and the wings are absolutely delicious. The only thing I wish they added on their menu is chicken rolls because I love chicken rolls and it is a common thing sold in pizzerias, but unfortunately they do not make them."}
{"text":"I am from NJ, just outside of NYC and I know good pizza.  I used to deliver pizza up north in a place that has been open for 50 years (one of the first pizza places in the area) and has delicious pizza.  This place has the best NYC style pizza down in Charlotte.  When I walked in for the first time I looked at the pizza (looked good), looked at the wall and spotted a picture of NYC (good sign), and then I watched the guy making pizza.  It took me about 5 seconds to see that he knew what he was doing.  It looked like when the original owner of the pizza place I worked at up north was making pizza.    The slices are HUGE (the fact that this guy can even stretch the dough that big shows he is a pro) and delicious.  This place could fit right in up north and do well...that is saying a lot for a place in Charlotte.  Great pizza, good prices.  Just get a slice and try to tell me its not delicious."}
{"text":"Remember Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and how cheesy/gooey/perfect their pizza looked?  Here it is in real life.  Enjoy just a slice or the whole pie."}
{"text":"Da Vincis is a great choice for pizza in the university area. I got a white pizza for lunch delivery the other day. It took longer than expected but it was worth the wait! It was loaded with cheese and lots of ricotta. The crust was good. The medium is huge even for two people. The only problem was so much cheese was hard on both of our stomachs and we couldn't finish much of it. Good stuff though and I will definitely try again. I want to try the red sauce!"}
{"text":"We likey..:)  Pizza slices are way bigger than your hand. I like how the tomato sauce is not heavy and not terribly sweet like some places. The toppings did seem like  they were just added to a cheese vs. freshly prepared, but we could have been wrong. The prices are pretty good and the service for take-out was quick. We will definitely be ordering on another lazy dinner night."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza, big and thin slices just like NY style pizza. Recommend to any pizza lover."}
{"text":"Got a slice of pepperoni pizza and a salad combo--quick, tasty, well-priced. I recommend it!"}
{"text":"As good as it gets in the south.  This is Due Amici are the only real pizza places in town.  Fuel, Hawthorne, etc ....if you like that then you mine as well just order dominos.   Good pizza served up hot and in huge slices.  If you miss NY style then check out this or Due Amici.  That is all."}
{"text":"Certainly NOT a NY/NJ style pizza regardless of what some reviews are saying. There was barely enough sauce on the pie and the cheese wasn't too great. The crust itself was what's expected down here in the south."}
{"text":"Best place ever for the best pizza and subs. The steak and cheese sub is great and so is the eggplant parmigiana!  Really good!  Very authentic Italian food.  Owner from Italy"}
{"text":"Wow thank you for a great pizza. This is a true gem in Charlotte. A large pizza is more then enough to feed a family of 5. Once again great pizza and will be back every time we are in town."}
{"text":"Quick lunch while waiting on our vehicle to get finished up. The pizza slices are thin and crispy. Huge slices and we had a traditional calzone. Great fillings and a cheap lunch for 4 people. We will come again."}
{"text":"Good pizza,! Combo prices pretty good. I got a large Philly Sub, was not worth the price. Too little meat, too many condiments. Buy the small sub rather than the large. 4 inches of extra condiments is. bad deal. From my last menu most items went up 50 cents, and portions stayed the same."}
{"text":"Love this place make me think of home. Slices like when I rode the path train in the square"}
{"text":"Best new York style by the slice place in charlotte.  Librettos is a close second.  Both are 5 star.  Great service and even better pizza, crunchy and chewy at the same time."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place more than 2 stars since I see some great reviews. I ordered the \"Buffalo Wings\" and was stoked to hear that you get 10 per order all for $6.50! Let me just say that if you are looking for great wings, this is not the place. If you are looking for \"Buffalo Wings\" this is definitely not the place! I am from Buffalo so I was expecting some really crispy, hot, saucy wings. What I got were some subpar, breaded wings akin to what you might find on a Chinese buffet which are definitely NOT Buffalo Wings in any capacity. Despite getting something other than Buffalo Wings, I decided to give them a try. They were really grizzly and had this nasty freezer burnt taste. Needless to say I gave them to the cat.   I also ordered a slice of pepperoni to go. It was humongous! Sadly, the size was about all it had going for it. Maybe it would've been better if I ate it at the restaurant but it was just OK. Plus I came a little bit later in the day and I'm not sure how long that pizza had been sitting out. I've had better for sure.   My main critique is the wings. Horrible. Do not get them. The pizza- jury is out on that. I would try it again however I would dine in and come back during a busier time when the pizza might be fresher."}
{"text":"Food is EXCELLENT. Customer service is outstanding every time. These people are great at what they do and really look out for the customer. Portion sizes are huge and the prices are low. I highly recommend this Restaraunt."}
{"text":"Ordered a half mushroom half cheese pizza this evening from Da Vinci's. Our first pizza ordered in Charlotte.  I am from the northeast (New Haven) and consider this really good New York Style pizza. Not New Haven but New York. I would definitely   order from them again.  The large pizza was huge.  The only problem I had with the pizza was the mushrooms were not fresh.  Canned mushrooms bring down the quality of a good pizza.  Will order another topping next time."}
{"text":"Was at Anna's Linens tonight so I thought I'd give it a try. OMG best white pizza EVER.  Probably the best pizza I've had in the south. Definitely top 2. I'm about to move across town, and I will occasionally come back to get this white pizza. It's just a ricotta base and mozzarella. After I ordered I started wishing I had added spinach, but after one bite I was so glad I didn't. It was just so pure and amazing as is. I'm a person that loves complex flavors, but this pizza is simple and divine. A small is 16\" (a pretty large small) and was 10.95 plus tax. They also deliver. I got it to go but I noticed that the restaurant is exceptionally clean inside. I know it's fairly new, but I also know how fast a kitchen can get dirty and this place was sparkling."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time and I'm honestly impressed. The pizza is HUGE and it taste good and fresh. I got 2 slices and some garlic cheese bread with a drink all for about $9 which is a great deal. Only reason I didn't give them 5 stars was because of the customer service. Staff wasn't very friendly and seemed to enjoy their own convo more than they wanted to work."}
{"text":"Their pizzas are HUGE! But it's thin.... Still taste great and a little above average pricing yet still unique because you don't really see huge pizzas around here. Their spaghetti taste quite traditional with nice big meatballs along with it. Good amount of choices. I don't go here often since there are other places that serves pizzas for a cheaper price."}
{"text":"Da Vinci's has pretty good pizza.  They mainly serve pizza by the slice and the slices are massive, they do a great job, and I stop by every now and then due to convenience.  For when I have more time I make the drive to Benny's in NoDa, same style of pizza but a little bit better."}
{"text":"Nice place. Clean environment, friendly service, and delicious pizza! They have a very versatile menu as well!"}
{"text":"Called in advance for a pick up..ordered two pepperoni pizzas and buffalo wings....DELICIOUS.. The pizza slices are huge and imitated New York pizza. The wings were nice and crispy. Definitely a great spot. Will definitely order from here again when I come back to Charlotte!!"}
{"text":"This place is the real deal-amazing new york style pizza, salads and philly cheese steak. We were just in town for 24 hours but were so impressed that we ate there twice. We wish they would open in Cary, NC."}
{"text":"Great pizza!  Could not get through by phone so had to drive to order.  But very good pizza and salads.  Worth it!"}
{"text":"I'm torn between giving this place 2 stars or 5, so I'll split the difference with 3.  The pizza here is my favorite in Charlotte- definitely 5 stars.  Their customer service is rather lacking, more like 2 stars.  I called to place a to go order after a very long Saturday running errands,  I hadn't eaten all day and was looking forward to a DaVinci's pizza.  I called to place my order at 9:35pm (the website states that they are open until 10pm.)  I know 9:35pm seems very specific, but I was so floored after making the call I checked my cell phone to see what time I placed the call.  When I called, they refused my order stating they were only doing \"fast food\"  at that time.  If they are going to be open until 10pm, they need to work/take orders until closing time.  I have worked in the service industry and we all hate when customers show up 5-10 min. before closing, but we dig in, smile and serve them because they are the customer.  I can understand if I was calling with a large multi-pizza order 5 minutes before closing, but placing an order 25 minutes before closing does not seem unreasonable to me,  This is not the first time I have called \"late\" around 9:30pm to order.  Another time I called they took my order but not until after they made sure I was aware they closed at 10pm and they asked me if I was sure I could make it by 9:55pm.  Again, I understand after working a long day that leaving on time is great, but never in the service industry have I been able to leave the minute the doors close."}
{"text":"Don't worry - I won't start this review out with that terribly hackneyed phrase \" I really wanted to like this place but...\" - hehe.  After an IKEA visit, I remembered Ryan G said that this place had the best NY Style pizza in Charlotte. It was an easy decision to stop in before heading on to some breweries. The pizza looked and smelled great. I ordered the pepperoni and plain. In a day and age where people are trying to cut back on sodas, I wanted a cup of water. Sorry, we only sell bottles. But there's a soda fountain right behind me that has a water dispenser?? Poor form in my book - charge me for the cup if you have to... Or if you had beer, I would have bought a beer.  I will admit the pizza was really good. It was pretty authentic. I like it when there's a little crispness to the crust after a quick reheat.  The not so good part is the amount of trash all over the place. The shop was not busy, but there were four people standing around behind the counter.  In the dining room, the trash cans were overflowing with trash on the floor and under some of the tables. Jeez - not a great first impression.   Apparently this place does have a pretty big following and does a brisk business (especially with it located in The University area). And yes they do have good pizza and yes I will be back, and hopefully someone has swept the floors..."}
{"text":"Love this pizzaria!!   Every time order is correct and food is delicious!!  Staff is Always friendly."}
{"text":"Love this place, great food. Love their Philly Steak and Cheese and their Pizza is great. Everyone is extremely friendly. My favorite Pizza joint"}
{"text":"Yummy!! Huge NY style slices of pizza! It's not my favorite pizza parlor but it definitely gets the job done for a quick lunch break and the prices are great for the amount of food you receive! I've tasted better, but I'll definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Just okay experience. Service is hit or miss. Pizza is also hit or miss though the slices are huge they are sometimes way too greasy. The prices are excellent however and when the pizza holds the grease it is definitely worth it."}
{"text":"i haven't found better pizza than DaVinci's . Service is very friendly, Pizza and salad was great , and pizza was so hugeeee. great work . Love it"}
{"text":"I placed an order for delivery and it arrived right when they said it would. I had the spinach calzone which was okay. My boyfriend had the chicken parm sandwhich that he said was okay as well.  Both the calzone and the sandwhich was huge and Im pretty sure he ordered the small! We also got an order of the garlic rolls which were awesome! I'd definately order from here again."}
{"text":"My wife and I eat here on a somewhat regular basis for lunch on weekdays.  The pizza is amazing and they give you huge slices.  Although the pizza is definitely the best around I have found their hot subs are killer, the Buffalo Chicken sub is amazing.  The same goes for their wings they are battered and oh so awesome. The salads are better than average in my opinion.   If you order carryout pizza you won't be disappointed the large pizza just barely can be crammed in the box, and the drive home will seriously challenge your temptations with the smell. The place is clean and service is good. Last but not least you cannot beat the value, a carry out large cheese is $15, and as I said earlier it barely fits into the box. Best  New York style pizza in the University area."}
{"text":"As a lover of New York style pizza, this place has me stunned. It is, in my opinion, the best pizza I've ever had. Portions are generous and the price is reasonable. I had the pepperoni pie with garlic knots and both were excellent. I'm about to order from there again for TWD night! Love it."}
{"text":"BEST NEW YORK PIZZA IN THE SOUTH. My qualification : South Bronx born and raised  Thank you for bringing my mouth happiness.  Prices are amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Not a lot of options for pre-IKEA fuel. Let the bf choose since I was dragging him shopping. Pizza very good, NY style and HUGE. Way bigger than my medium-sized face. We also ordered a chicken parm sub to split. Not really any flavor at all- wouldn't recommend. Would go back and only get pizza. Would be a great spot to get takeout from and enjoy while fighting over how to put your new dresser together!"}
{"text":"Charlotte has no shortage of pizza places, and even pizza by the slice - I won't pretend that I was visiting Ikea like (ahem) others, I was at Walmart, and decided that I'd mosey over to Da Vinci's and see if there was anything interesting to their offerings.  As most pizza places do, their pie smelled great, even from across the lot - and only smelled better when opening the door. As has been mentioned elsewhere, I don't really get the need to charge for water in a bottle when it's available on your dispenser. Maybe they are trying to provide the true Italian experience or something. Whatever.  The slice itself was tasty, with a nice crisp crust, but other than that, nothing you can't find at another dozen places across town. Perhaps it is the proximity to all the other stores (and yes, Walmart), but it did seem to be a bit... junky. It could have also been the lunch rush, and maybe they will clean it up once it calms down a bit. Or maybe that's just their thing."}
{"text":"Loved this place! We got a 16\" pizza, half white and half Da Vinci Special. The white was okay. I guess I'm not a huge fan of ricotta cheese but the extra garlic and onion made it better. My boyfriend loved it though. The Special was good too. The pizza was so huge, we got two meals out of it. While we were there waiting for our pizza to be made I loved watching the guy make it, it was so entertaining. We will definitely be back even though this place is out of our way."}
{"text":"Just had a HUGE, delicious, medium pizza delivered to our hotel room door. We got the Pepperoni Lovers and garlic bread. Everything treated great, especially the marinara dipping sauce that came with the bread, tastes fresh!"}
{"text":"Dough doesn't taste fresh and is hard to chew. Overall not the best pizza out there; chicken sub was ok."}
{"text":"I often find myself ending up here for lunch since I work down the street.  Their pizza is probably the best pizza ive had since ive lived in charlotte. And their service is pretty much always on point during lunch hours. The only negative experiences ive encountered from this place is trying to place an order for pickup or delivery. I always get put on hold and eventually hung up on. This has happened on two separate occasions.  Other than that this is an awesome, cheap, and convenient place to grab a bite."}
{"text":"Tried this pace for a pepperoni pizza.  Meh, tasted like Sbarro.  Also, it wasn't completely cooked so we had to put it in the oven for several minutes which....is....annoying as all get out. You can find better."}
{"text":"My family LOVES their \"truly\" New York style pizzas. $22 for a medium specialty is pretty steep, but the size of it is huge when compared to a smedium from Pizza Hut."}
{"text":"The salads are a bit better than most pizza restaurants. Loaded up rather than skimpy and thrown together.  Apparently, I hear the pizza is the closest thing you can get to a NY slice around here. It definitely looks delicious and smells amazing."}
{"text":"Poor customer service. It's pizza, so it's very hard to mess up. There portions are huge which is great when ordering for a crowd.   However customer service has gotten worst. I ordered a pizza over the phone. When I arrived I went to pay for my order. She mentioned my food wasn't ready. I waited and waited and as they kept calling orders ahead of me I was patient. I'm sure some people ordered ahead  Finally I had to go up to the counter and ask for my pizza that was just sitting there getting cold.   When I asked why didn't they inform me my food was ready the cashiers response was I didn't make your food.   The cook and other cashiers laughed. Needless to say I will never buy pizza here again. Plenty of other fish in the sea."}
{"text":"I should have gotten the pizza. The lasagna was ok. Price is good and portions are big"}
{"text":"Conflicted- food IS good.. found hair in my Philly  it was cool, they made me a new one... got home with it, open the pizza, hair on it too .."}
{"text":"If you are looking for an authentic restaurant that serves NY/NJ style pizza in Charlotte, you do not need to look any further than this place. This place charges 2.50 for a huge slice of cheese or pepperoni pizza (35 cents for other toppings) and just cannot be beat for the price. In addition to that, I ordered a side of their meatballs as well. The meatballs and the sauce were excellent, and the best I have had at a restaurant in quite a while.   The slices came out piping hot, and although they were a little greasy for my taste (another sign of authenticity), that did not matter since I was able to blot it out, and enjoy both slices anyway.       The customer service here was great, and the decor was fine with some very comfortable furniture. I came here just after a blackout hit the area, and they were still open and accepting customers (although you had to pay cash to order something).   All that being said, while the pizza wasn't entirely my favorite, this place more than makes up for it with its great prices, great service, and best of all, great meatballs! I would definitely come here again if I was in the mood for a cheap and quick bite to eat."}
{"text":"I always enjoy going to Da Vinci's Pizza. The small pizzas are bigger than some places mediums or larges. We had no issues with the service. The cashier and staff were nice and professional. If you're in the area, check them out!"}
{"text":"I read the good reviews  and decided to go try it out. not to impressed the pizza was just ok. The pizza wasnt cheesy. I probably won't visit them again ."}
{"text":"Da Vinci's was very helpful with our 12 person party!  Experience: Knowing we had a lot of people to feed, I called ahead 20 minutes to order 3 large pizzas so they could be close to finished when we arrived.  Within 5 minutes of us sitting, the first pizza arrived, followed closely by the other two.   We had pitchers of water brought out regularly and everyone had an enjoyable experience.  Food: The pizza here is thin New York style with the grease you would expect if you like NY pizza!  It has a good fresh taste (can't vouch for ingredients used).   Portions: 1 slice of a large pizza is twice the size of most pizza slices, so a medium should feed a family of 4 well, and a large would have some left overs for most families.   Overview: This was our second visit but it impressed me that they handled our size group so easily with a little heads-up notice before arriving, and pizza quality was great."}
{"text":"Pizza was okay. Cashier was not friendly, maybe an off day. I would return though if I had a craving and this was the only thing close."}
{"text":"Their regular pizza is good but avoid their pan Sicilian pizza it was very not good.  Different sauce and crust flavor just bad when compared to the regular."}
{"text":"Good pizza and cheap prices. They deliver, but be careful and make sure you order from the right location. Large slices also. You could really just eat one slice and two if you're really hungry."}
{"text":"So, I continue to check out places that offer pizza by the slice,  so today I ventured to Da Vinci's, and thought everything was okay. I arrived shortly before 12 and was the second person there, however, by 12:00 the place was packed. There are several booths and multiple tables in the restaurant. Upon ordering you receive a number and they call it out and deliver your order to you, which was nice. I chose the slice of pepperoni, my typical choice, and a side salad. The salad was crisp & fresh, and huge for a side salad. However, the ranch dressing was definitely out of the jar, I am thinking Hidden Valley, ha ha! As for the slice, great size, but it was a little cool and the sauce, although light, reminded me of jarred sauce too. It didn't have the freshness that some pizza sauces have. Great prices, quick service, an overall nice lunch. If in the area again I would stop in again."}
{"text":"The pizza is too sloppy for me very oily. The service is good though & staff is nice. Affordable prices as well."}
{"text":"I don't know how this place got voted best pizza in Charlotte. We got the Davinci Special and it was not cooked enough. Very unimpressed.  Also, the girl taking order was rude on the phone and in person. I will not be going back."}
{"text":"I was so excited to learn that Da Vinci's opened this new location closer to the University. I frequent their other location in Davis Lake. This restaurant is in a newly built strip so everything is nice and new. It is your average pizza parlor - casual, booths and tables, order at the counter.   This location has the same great combos available. The combos are in the $7-10 range, so very reasonable for lunch OR dinner (you can get the combo all day long). I usually go for the slice and salad combo. The salads are pretty good, and they give you enough ranch for the ever important dipping of your crust at the end!   They have free wi-fi which is nice if you need that!   If you want good New York style pizza check out Da Vinci's!"}
