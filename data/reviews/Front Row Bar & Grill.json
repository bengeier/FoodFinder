{"text":"Bar service is good during a Browns game, sub-par other days. Food is decent for a bar, wings are good but drowning in sauce. I'd avoid the hot garlic wings since they just pour hot sauce on top of garlic parmesan flavor, which makes for a gross combo. And definitely drink beer here, the water has a weird after taste and the pop tastes like the lines haven't been cleaned since 1993."}
{"text":"Great band tonight!!!  Bartenders rock!!!  Will be back!!!  People here are very friendly and all has smiles on!!:)  Loved the place"}
{"text":"b Better than expected from the outside appearance.  Staff were great and the wings starter and steak salad were good - best buffalo wings this trip by far. Great lakes Christmas ale really hit the spot after a 600km drive from south Kentucky.  I will go again tomorrow night before flying out.  For someone who likes to relax with a bar meal after traveling for business I can recommend."}
{"text":"Very slow and rude service. Food was average, nothing special. My salad was ice berg. And it took a very long time to come to our table. Very dirty water, you can taste it. Good atmosphere for sports and good presentation of food"}
{"text":"We were devastated when Conte's Restaurant in Brook Park closed in April.  We were overjoyed to find out that the Conte family is now cooking in the Front Row Bar and Grill.  Look for the Italian menu items - order any of them and you can't go wrong.  The Contes have brought their fabulous cooking into this establishment.  We love the Chicken Scarpariello, Veal Saltimbocca and the linguine with white clam sauce.  Lots more on the menu - all absolutely wonderful.  We were so sad when we thought we would not be able to experience Maria's delicious cooking again.  So glad they found a kitchen  where they can cook for their fans!"}
{"text":"I was a regular at Contes when I lived down the street from the original location. I refer any and everyone who is looking for Italian as they make the best in Cleveland in my opinion. When I found out they relocated to Front Row I immediately planned to make a trip across town to enjoy one of my favorite meals. I called ahead and they insisted that it was the same exact food that was served at the original location. When seated I didn't even need a menu because I knew I wanted the Fettuccine Alfredo add chicken. Contes has never been inexpensive so I didn't expect it to be inexpensive here either despite the bar setting. However it was a surprising $13 which was a bit cheaper than Contes if I remember correctly.   I received my salad accompanied by a tiny premade toasted dinner roll. Anyone who frequents Contes knows that the bread is always freshly made but I let it fly. The salad was different as well because the original Contes salad never came with cheese let alone two types. And the dressing taste like normal Italian which must have also been premade. I suspect things may have changed a little because after all this is just a small bar and no longer the authentic little Italian restaurant I used to frequent. It took a while to come out which didn't bother me either because I know it takes time to make such a good meal. I used to watch the owner prepared the meal straight from her kitchen therefore the wait never bothered me.   Anywho when I received my pasta my boyfriend immediately asked was it a lunch portion and I thought the same but decided not to complain. The noodles were linguini and not fettuccine but that didn't bother me either. Another change was the fact that the chicken was cut into small square pieces and they were beyond dry. I'm used to a very moist whole piece of chicken or two. The worse part was the fact that the noodles way undercooked and clumped together. The alfredo sauce didn't even taste the same and there were no roasted garlic cloves. Because I respect the food Contes has produced in the past I decided not to picture the food because it was just that bad. I tried to eat it but I just couldn't so I told the waiter (who by the way was very nice). She insisted that it was the original Conte family in the back preparing the food and that she would have it fixed. However, I was totally turned off and declined.   I really miss Contes and I hope that one day they return in a different location and serve the same home cooked meals they once produced. I enjoyed going there after a long day at work and enjoying a great meal accompanied by good customer service from the family."}
{"text":"very inexpensive place to drink.  The kitchen closes early but the staff doesnt care if you walk next door to Kickers Pizza and bring food over.  They do have indoor cornhole here.  The bar is pretty big and I've never seen it even half capacity but I've also never been here on a weekend.  Bartender was very nice and always around for us"}
{"text":"Pros: Indoor cornhole, not very crowded, lots of TVs for game-watching, good, cheap wings!  Cons: pretty limited on beer selections"}
{"text":"I have plans to update this review sometime in the future when I can actually eat a meal there. But I'm not sure that I'll be hurrying in.   The service was very slow eventhough there were 4 bartenders working on a Friday night. Two of the girls had some serious attitude, my whole group commented about their behavior.   The drinks were priced pretty well and the whole place was clean.  I like the set up of the bar and they have a cozy outdoor area (essentially in the parking lot) with a tent, space heaters and TV's. They book great bands- we were there to see the One Hit Wonders. If it weren't for the Wonders and the beckoning voice of Siren, we probably wouldn't be there."}
{"text":"On the plus side;  Very good wings and potato skins.  Decent bar food overall.  Prices were fair.  Service was good, nice bartender. The choice of beers on tap could be expanded but I found something I liked.  The noise from the TV seemed to bounce and echo around the room. Seemed a bit loud. Also it could use some better lighting to give it more atmosphere.  But for a neighborhood bar, ya - I'd go back again."}
{"text":"This Bar has re-opened. Don't call them, they don't have a phone and the number will just ring busy. The wings were big and the sauce was good with the new chef. Drink was ok"}
