{"text":"Came for a friend's 30th birthday and had a great time! 

Arrived at 9pm and waited outside for about 20 minutes (with a heat lamp). They're pretty strict about the capacity issues and I understand why: it's rammed on Saturday night

For a $10 cover you have endless pin ball machines and classic arcade games to play.  There's also skee ball,  foosball,  super smash bros on wii, and a small dance floor.

I do wish they let fewer people inside as there are no real time limits for the games (no coins, just press start),  and some of the popular games like street fighter and NBA jam had a fairly long wait with so many people playing for however long they wished."}
{"text":"Games are great - love that they are on free play, and the crowd definitely rotates and shares fairly. There is a fair selection of beverages, and the bartender will make you a cocktail upon request. All great. 

However: the food is absolutely obscene. I knew we weren't heading into a restaurant, but seriously? We ordered the nachos with con queso - which happened to come very watered down: I though it was a kitchen error so went to the kitchen to ask, and was told that it was prepared correctly. You could literally drink it with a straw. We also ordered French fries which were undercooked, and full of raw potato. The food, which came out quickly, could have stood to be cooked longer. 

Finally - a DJ started up at 11 or so, and killed the atmosphere. Too loud, and prohibited conversation. 

Tweak a few things, and this place could be bomb."}
{"text":"What an amazing addition to the neighbourhood! Went last night to check it out around 8. It wasn't too busy and it had a really awesome relaxed vibe. Lots of great old school games (and skee ball!), decent beer selection and a totally reasonable cover charge for all those games. Didn't try the food but impressed with all their veggie options. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Nice arcade place it only costs 5 dollars and you get to play every game for free inside. The placenis always full of people and they treat the customers very well."}
{"text":"Great collection of games, well maintained and mostly working properly which is no small feat!  Good selection of beers, but food is limited so dont plan on having your meal here."}
{"text":"This locale offers a huge roster of arcade classics and pinball machines. They have a projector that plays movies from the 80s and 90s on screen and the music they play drip with nostalgia. 
Unlike mostly all other arcades I've been to, however, this one only charges a small cover fee for an unlimited amount of playtime on the machines. This is a business model I wish more arcades followed since I find many arcade games unfair. 
There are a few things that's sort of set me off a bit though. The food and drinks are overpriced (but that's largely to support the unlimited games patrons have) so I will let that slide but it's still a minor complaint. I also would say that a few games are buggy, like Space Invaders which is hacked so that you die regardless or Area 51 which must be stuck in demo mode or something because the final boss is unwinnable. The place is a little cramped and everyone leaves their coats and jackets on the chairs. I would also prefer an air hockey table to the hockey game they have which has dodgy controls and a lack of fluidity. Maybe it's a space problem though, who knows? 
These are all just minor nitpicks really, I would still recommend this place for a game night once a month. It's gives me a terrific sense of nostalgia for a bygone era of gaming bliss."}
{"text":"We stopped by on a Tuesday night shortly around 6:30 and it wasn't that busy yet, so it was really nice! We got the chance to play a lot of games and never had to wait. The cover on Tuesdays is just $2 (no cover on Mondays, by the way). On one side of the room, it's mostly pinball machines, and on the other side, there are a variety of games such as NBA Jam, street fighter, TMNT...etc. They also have hockey and foosball tables, a skee ball thing, as well as a TV with mario kart on. It's really nice to be able to walk around and play all the games without worrying about paying for each one. They also serve snacks, such as fries, hot dogs..etc. 
I can imagine that this place can get packed on weekends, and that there would be a lot of waiting involved."}
{"text":"This place is really fun.  I didn't try any food so can't comment on that.  Had a lot of fun playing pinball though, and the beers are pretty good.  Will go again for sure."}
{"text":"I like beer, I like pinball.  The combination of the two?  Obviously better.   Good crowd, good vibes."}
{"text":"Our group loved this place on a Wednesday night.  If you've grown up with arcade games, you would know that $5 for unlimited play at the whole arcade is quite the bargain.

The greatest achievement we had as a group was to beat Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles on 4 player mode, and seeing the end credits.  If you've never played these old school games, there is quite a bit of eye strain with the vintage graphics, but I suppose eye strain is part of the charm.

There were also shooters like Revolution X, and we capped off the night with skeetball and 4 player Mario Kart.  Continue?  You betcha."}
{"text":"Yup. It's all true. Whatever has been written about this place. All the hype is very real. What is there to not like about the place..cold craft beer, hot dogs or arcade games? Get ready to be teleported to your childhood; consider the beer as bonus. 

There are lots of different pinball tables, Mario, racing games, fighting arcade games. There is a 5$ cover charge for entry on most days (Mondays do not have any cover charge; Tuesdays have 2$ cover charge). Some patrons act like assholes by getting glued to the good games, so don't be one and hope others follow the suit. Food and drinks are reasonably priced. Good options for beer. For food it's pretty much hot dogs and nibblers. If you're in the mood for anything gourmet; have your dinner somewhere else before heading over.

The parking lot is closeby. It's 4$ an hour with no daily maximum. Bathurst/Spadina sub way stations are both within walking distance. I'll strongly recommend to leave your car at home and take a subway, as I was so drunk last time I was here after 4-5 pints of beer and 3 hours of arcade games that I drank neighbours beer without wondering why he's giving me a funny look. Needless to say, I apologized profusely; offered to but him a fresh one when I realized; and ended up fleeing the scene shortly after to avoid further embarrassment. It makes a good story now, but trust me it wasn't so funny when it happened. Thank God, wife drives and doesn't like beer so were able to reach home safe and sound.

All in all I would definitely repeat, except for the beer incident."}
{"text":"Love can be a strong word, but I freaking love this place! 

$5 cover + free, unlimited play? Yes!! 

Good music, good food, super chill bar, AND RETRO VIDEO GAMES? Yaaaaaaas. 

Do you like video games? This is where you wanna be. 
Just down for some nostalgia? Tilt got your back. 
90's baby feeling a little old? Tilt will console you. (Pun intended)

While seating is limited, the amount of games and pinball machines makes up for it. 
There seems to be more pinball machines than video games, but nothing is repetitive and there's a good variety to keep you entertained for a few hours. 
They have old school games like: TMNT, Pac-Man, donkey Kong, space invaders!!!!, street fighter, tron, and so much more, in great condition too. 

There are also two couches with consoles set up! SNES at the front, and n64 at the back. Too bad even with the house rules on courtesy and 'sharing', in the 3-4 hours we were there, the same people stayed on the n64 lounge the entire time. 
 
Craft beers are cheap, mixed drinks not so much. Still pretty standard for a bar. 
They offer snacks like fries, pop corn, corn dogs, poutine, coney dogs, nachos - the kind of food you'd kick back to with a beer and some video games! 

It gets busyyy on weekends, with long lines. But kudos to the staff/security for great crowd management! I can definitely appreciate this, versus businesses overcrowding to maximize on revenue. Bonus points. ;)

TL;DR - Retro games and Pinball, chill bar atmosphere, good music for $5. Great place for dates, hangout, bar hop."}
{"text":"Been here on different nights be aware that the weekends get busy usually by 8 to late its packed.  But other nights you don't have to worry about it being as busy. I even spent my birthday here (my first time there and had to go back for more) I have now brought my employees, family and friends here any time they ask to go for drinks.  Will be back again soon!"}
{"text":"I had a birthday party at Tilt a few weeks ago on a Friday night, and it was an absolute success! Everyone had an amazing time, and $5 cover is such a steal (the bouncer even refunded me the $5 after realizing it was my birthday!). The service here is great, beers are inexpensive, and the assortment of games is unreal.

I highly recommend checking out Tilt! Just a note - it gets busy ~9PM."}
{"text":"Amazing place $5 cover to get in and unlimited play for the arcade.  Place gets pack on Friday nights.  So many old arcade games such as Street Fighter 2, TMNT arcade.  Lots of cool pin ball machines as well.  Good variety of beer and food looks cool but didn't get any this time as I just ate before I came.  They also have 2 TVs for console video games I think I saw N64 and SNES being played.  Also have a foosball table and Hockey table which were cool.  Expect loud music and huge crowds if that is not your thing this inst the place for you"}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE.

Cheap entry to a pub...with FREE VIDEO GAMES?!?!?!

I think I might have experienced the better side of it by visiting on a Monday night though, I can see this place being jam packed on the weekend which makes it hard to find an opportunity to play games.

One thing that was difficult was that not all games had a spot for you to put down your beer.  Since it was empty it was fine but you're basically leaving your drink unattended behind you for a prolonged period of time while you are gaming...

I think this will be one of my favourite go-to spots for weeknight hangouts.  Two-for-one entry on Mondays, Toonie Tuesdays?  yes please....there were more daily specials but I dont' remember them."}
{"text":"$5 coverage at the door and you get to have an unlimited time playing all the retro arcade games, video games, skeeball, pinball machines, all the retro games you can think of! Not normally a place I would think of going to but still enjoyed myself here! Of course there was a bar and food, which I did not try, but the prices aren't too expensive either. The place is not too big but there are enough games to play, however a couple of the machines didn't work. But if you're feeling nostalgic, you should try this place out with some friends!"}
{"text":"Very fun atmosphere here. I love this idea of arcade game bars it's the perfect night out with a group of people, no matter who your with your all bound to be pleased with the variety of games, fun music ,and good drink deals"}
{"text":"This place was great up until it got really crowded. $5 entry fee is fine, it was great playing the games and also the menu looked cute, but later on in the night, it got really crowded and there was lines everywhere, even where there weren't any before."}
{"text":"Really awesome pinball and arcade bar in the Annex. Full disclosure, we were here for a birthday party and did not have to pay the $5 cover. Lots of different pinball and Nintendo and mortal combats and street fighter. (I kept getting beat)  

The beer is a good selection of local craft. To keep with the theme I had the \"pinball wizard\". Snacks are also arcade themed and feature things like nachos, deep fried pickle and Coney Island cheese chili fries. Also are quite inexpensive and come with massive portions. 

Recommended"}
{"text":"So much fun, takes me back to the old days, love the pinball machines.  The fries and chili was amazing.  Defiantly going back"}
{"text":"Tons of free arcade games, cheap cover, reasonably priced craft beer. Need I say more? I can imagine it gets a bit loud on busy nights so probably not the best place to go and chat with friends, but if it's games and beer you're after, you really can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"This place is one of the coolest concepts for a bar in Toronto. Just $5 cover will give you access to your favourite arcade games from your childhood. 

The biggest downside to this place is:
a) the long wait to get in
b) the long wait to play a game

I went with a group of friends on a Friday night and as you can expect, the place was absolutely packed. I do not recommend this bar on a weekend because you'll end up spending more time waiting in line rather than doing anything else. Go on a weekday to get the true experience and the most value for your money."}
{"text":"You need to come here if you're in the neighbourhood! I highly recommend this place for dates or for groups after dinner. There are tons of pin ball machines but they also have old school arcade games like street fighter, and donkey Kong. The staff are super friendly. The prices of the snacks are fair too. We usually get popcorn and poutine along with a few beers."}
{"text":"Videogames, pinball, beer!  What the heck else do you want?  $5 cover on weekdays and $10 on weekends.

A small selection of food, mainly dogs and fried things.  

Pew pew pew"}
{"text":"Baby, this is what I came for
Lightning strikes every time I play
Everybody's watching me play 
But I'm looking at the screen (or silver ball)
boom boom boom wakka wakka ding ding ding cha ching

I'm old school and I know it
You know I'm old school because how I write and what I say
That's OK because I don't mind it
And that's not a roll of quarters/loonies/toonies in my pocket

All you can play games - no coins required.

Here at Tilt you do not need a roll of coins unless you intend on paying for your cover or food with it.  On a Friday evening the cover charge I paid was 5 dollars at the bar because I came early enough that somebody wasn't at the front door/coat check.  You can check your coat here but there's a few hooks to hang it inside but not many but you can get one if you're early enough.  I was early as usual.  This place is newly opened (3rd weekend) and it was featured in the Metro (or the other paper on the subway) as well as on BlogTO.  Honestly I discovered on BlogTO and I I knew when it hit that medium it was going to take off.

The Annex is one of my favorite hoods in the city that being it's on the west side it's in my favorite zone in that I consider my zone the west side between Ossington and Bathurst and between Bloor and Dundas.  Places to eat and drink?  Yup... that pretty much sums up why I like this area and always have.  

NOW, add one of the coolest places in my zone and now you have a glorified place to hang out and have fun.  Chalk this one up for the Annex because the cool wow factor just leveled up.

They have a bunch of snacks revolving around hot dogs and fries.  Chip truck style fries yes, but I had the chili cheese fries and I have to say they are really good for a place that has multiple pinball machines.  While there's countless options to have a bite in the area Tilt serves up dogs done up Chicago style (not sure if they use sport peppers are not, they are impossible to find in Toronto for some strange unknown reason), corndogs, fries and while we ordered at the bar, I was given a number to take to the table and the food was brought to us when it was ready.  They have vegetarian options so if a beef dog is not preferable you can go with other options.  Non-meat options are clearly stated on the menu (fries, veggie dogs) etc.

The bar is a full bar.  Craft beers on tap as well as cans, bottles and other drinks are also served within reasonable price range as well so hey, why not get a couple pints to make the experience complete?  

As far as nostalgia goes there's a couch right to the right of the main entrance.  There's a wall display of dozens of original Nintendo games and a console of some sorts there.  In the back there's a N64 with a couch and a big screen tv.  As far as pinball games there's a wide range of variety from old 50's and 60's type machines to ones that are under a decade old to ones from the 90's or so.  There's 3 table top games opposite the bar such as Tetris, Galaga, Ms PacMan and standup machines make up the bulk of the game room along the edges of the opposing walls along the stretch of the main room.  All in all I think I counted about 40ish games 

For non pinball and coin op games there's skee ball at the very back wall sort of hidden as well as a whack a mole type game near the front not far from the Star Wars pinball game.

While my gang arrived earlier in the evening when it was not very busy and basically you could have at it to anything you wanted to play.  As the evening progressed the place got packed.  It wasn't necessarily as if you couldn't play a game but maybe there was a wait as almost every game was occupied.  That's to sort of be expected seeing how popular this place is and will become.  

There's shallow counters and high seating behind the games so if you had to put your drink somewhere that would be the safest.  There's a few small tables between the games. 

U of T gang welcome to what we GenX grew up with but feel lucky because it wasn't a flat fee and we didn't have a bar to make things nicer... we were kids so ya no drinking for us.  Also this place didn't seem shady at all like the arcades that used to be along Yonge and Dundas decades ago.

All around Tilt for me is the absolute coolest place I've been to in a very long time.  Rachel McAdams, you're a lucky girl to live so close to a cool place like Tilt."}
{"text":"Awesome place!!!

5 bucks to get in. Great local beers on tap at reasonable prices. Cool retro arcade machines and even an N64 system in the back for 4 players complete with couch!

Go sooner rather than later because this place will be tough to get into soon. Due to the fact that it is a newer place we walked right in. They accommodated my friend's birthday well too with 15ish people. There's a little area in the center of the place they gave us with chairs and tables.

They also have food but I didn't get any because I ate before. The menu looks good though. Good junk food options for after a few drinks like corn dogs, nachos and chili cheese fries. 

Go and enjoy! Get your double dragon on!"}
{"text":"Nostalgic arcade and videos games with good bar food and a modest alcohol selection.

5/5 - Venue
3.5/5 - Food & Drinks
4/5 - Overall

I visited this bar on an early Friday night, at around 8:30pm. Cover was $5 and that includes all the games inside which are free to play. Coat check is a separate cost. This place gets uncomfortably packed around 11:00pm, so plan accordingly.

Venue: The bar is located on a quiet stretch of Brunswick Ave. near Bloor st. You might even miss it given how quiet the area is. There is an front area for you to smoke and get some fresh air, as the inside of the bar can get humid. The walls of the bar are lined with pinball machines, and other arcade games although a good 40% of them are just pinball machines. There are two TVs with gaming systems; one seems to be a Gamecube and the other a Sega. There's a bar near the front, and at the back there's a small counter serving a limited selection of food and snacks. There's live music playing, and a few standing tables but no dance area. Tons of people chatting and having a drink though.

Food & Drinks: I can only comment on the dill pickled fries, which you can see in my photo. They were delightfully prepared in a pickle brine, then gives them a tangy salty crunch after frying. There's a mediocre selection of beers on tap with a couple local brewers and other common imports. I don't think there were any cocktails available, or at least nothing too fancy. Definitely not a place to enjoy a meal, as there are very limited food offerings, and limited seating.

Overall: This place is a must-go for the experience and the few hours of fun with the arcade games. However, with many of the machines being just pinball, you might lose interest. As the night wore on near 11:00pm the bar became very crowded, almost to the point of a club. There were no where to walk without needing to squeeze past people or bump into them. There were lines for all the machines, and the inside became quite warm and humid. I decided to leave soon after, as we had played all the games we wanted, and saw no point in socializing while standing up, packed like sardines in a can."}
{"text":"Bar + Arcade = Barcade!

$5 entrance, all games are on free-play so no coins or tokens required. Plenty of pinball machines and retro arcade games like Mortal Kombat, TMNT, PacMan, Donkey Kong... etc. There are NES and N64 consoles too.

Overall nostalgia heaven. I surely recommend it."}
{"text":"This place gets packed on a Friday night, of course! Right in the smack dab of frat boy central, here is this cool arcade bar.

The selection for beer is decent, and the food looked interesting. 

The pinball machines were really cool! You just pay cover and the games are free, which was a plus. 

Avoid busy nights unless you LOVE waiting behind people for a good 5-10 minutes for a game. Game hoggers galore :( 

For a niche bar, this was actually enjoyable. This place screams nostalgia!"}
{"text":"I came here on a Saturday with a group of friends for a birthday. We arrived at 10pm and waited outside for about 40mins. I'm glad that they limited the amount of people into the bar because it is fairly small and it can get cramped and hot pretty quick. 
The cover is $5 and included unlimited arcade game play. There were an entire wall of pinball machines, classic games like street fighter, bust a move, super Mario world, etc. 
It was fun but hard to play games with everyone as we were a party of 8 people. I can totally see this place as a fun date idea though. 
I didn't try the food here as I had a big dinner beforehand but my friends who did order food, enjoyed it. 
The drinks here are decent if you just want beer or hard liquor. They didn't have ingredients to make cocktails though. 

Overall it was a fun place but I wouldn't recommend coming here with a big group."}
{"text":"Men never outgrow their childhood obsessions, for hubby it's gaming. Came to Tilt to drag hubby out of his doldrums. If you want to avoid paying for parking, find one of the side streets where parking is free after 9pm.

$2 Tuesdays covers entrance and full use of all games, no quarters needed here; but you'll need to show ID at the door. $2 coat check as you enter, you'll pay the cover charge here then get your hand stamped. 

Saw so many of our favorites: Asteroids, Donkey Kong, Area 51, Street Fighter, and so many more. They also had pinball machines, Foosball and table hockey. On both ends of the place they had couches where you and your friends can play games like Mario Brothers. Let's not forget those consoles where you can sit across from your opponent like Pac Man.  

I'm not a gamer (anymore) so I thought I'd try out their food. You order and pay at the bar, they give you a number, you have a seat at a table and they bring the food to you.

ORDERED
- Coke - flat and sweet
- Contra Medianoche sandwich - avocado cheese, tomato arugula and peach mayo: tasty. 
- Punched Out Pulled Pork - Woodhouse Stout pulled pork with a grilled pineapple and Chipotle mayo: juicy and full of flavor. They could use a better, fresher bun.

Food was decent for the price. Staff wasn't the warmest but they were helpful and efficient. Open till the wee hours of the morning. This place is a wonderful haven for Generation Xers."}
{"text":"First of all I love the selection of games! A great mix of old school to 90s. Never had to wait too long to get a machine....except the couch/console games.
Now there was supposed to be a time limit or at least the sign said don't be a couch potato (literally had a couple sitting in for 2.5 hours), and let others play.
I get it people are going to just take advantage but it would be nice if there was a way for staff to have a rotation going. 

Food is just your typical junk food, fries took a short time considering how busy it was, tasted fresh and crispy . 

Cover is $5 cash, coat check is $2."}
{"text":"My final word: great place for hours of fun, with food and drink for a great combination. 

My experience: I went on a weekday evening. It got busy around 8/9 but wasn't crowded. Had lots of fun with my friend, had some food and a drink. For reference, I'm an avid retro gamer and collector. 

The good 

Lots of machines and nice variety. I'm impressed by what they had. Their NES selection is rough, but I imagine theft is a problem. 

Service was friendly and fast. I imagine not being incredibly busy helped, but I still felt welcomed and attended to. 

Great crowd. People were friendly, I left my coat at a table and no one took it. I felt comfortable despite the larger male crowd. 


The bad 

Food was okay. I had the chili cheese fries, and it give me a little indigestion. 

Some machines need a bit if repair. An unfortunate reality of arcade machines. 

Snack menu is a little lack lustre, but it's not the end of the world."}
{"text":"I never knew about this place until my friend celebrated her birthday here.  We arrived around 9 pm after dinner nearby and luckily missed the line.  The place was packed by 1030 pm and every machine was being played. This place has more arcade games and pin ball machines than the one in the Ossington area. The most fun that I had was with my friends at the foosball and hockey table.

Cover on Friday is $5 and there is coat check available. Whether you are a fan of street fighter or mario kart, you will have a good time. I definitely recommend anyone to try it out. The bar has a wide variety of craft beer and rail drinks at reasonable prices. You can also start a tab if you wanna settle the bill at the end.

I'm not sure about the food since I was full from dinner.  I believe they have some simple stuff like hot dogs. Don't arrive too late or else you will not be able to try everything.  We were lucky to be able to play the 2 table games as I thought it would be the most popular. There are a few tables all around but you will likely move around to mix and mingle."}
{"text":"Donkey Kong, Tron, Mario, Pac Man? Classics. Good picks. Well done.

Mario Kart 64 on comfy dorm furniture? Ooooohhh...\"HE'S HEATING UP\". 

Street Fighter 2 Champion Edition Arcade Machine? \"BOOMSHAKALAKA!!\"

O.G. TMNT, Whacky Gators and a NEO-GEO (YES, A NEO GEO)? OH MY GOD .....\"HE'S ON FIRE!!!!\""}
{"text":"$5 cover on Saturday and unlimited play? YES, PLEASE. Tilt rocked.

Oh and the best game in the whole arcade? It's obviously Tilt. I could play Tilt for ages, it's a shame they only have one machine and there might be a line once people discover how great it is.

The DJ rocking beats this past Friday night was great too and made me want to dance as I played the arcade games. I had a Chicago dog here and found it a little too overwhelming, but enjoyed how the menu had both vegetarian dog + meat dog options. 

Huge fan of Tilt. Super fun night!"}
{"text":"This place is a really great idea!!  My girlfriend and I love coming here after work to have a few drinks and enjoy the many games they have.  What I really like is that there are not only old games but new ones as well.  This includes pinball games like AC/DC (my favorite) and Tron.  It'll be interesting to see if the owners rotate in new games to keep things fresh.

All the games are very well maintained and fun to play.  The cover price is extremely reasonable and gives you free access to all the games.  The food and drink is fairly decent and there is seating as well for those who don't want to spend their whole time playing.  The crowds are not too bad: enough that it's busy and exciting, but not so much that you have to wait long to play your favorite game.

I really hope this place succeeds and that I can look forward to many more years of coming here!"}
{"text":"Good spot to kick it with the homies. 

Good times with NES console, N64 Mario Kart, Ninja Turtles, SF2, and MK2 to name a few.

Game on folks."}
{"text":"Really cool new spot! Friendly staff and free games. Drinks aren't too pricey either. I definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Bring your inner kid out here!  Pinball machines, arcade games, video games...what more could you ask for...for freeeeeeee!  The machines don't cost you money to play (there is a $5 cover weekdays but I don't think it's highly enforced if it gets busy).

This place has only been open for 3 weeks but it's a hit already!  You could spend a few hours here playing PAC man, super Mario bros, Tetris, double dragon...lots of pinball machines....so many games!

There's a small menu - hot dogs, chili fries, corn dogs, (they can make the items vegetarian if you ask) and a small beer menu (no pitchers).   There are a few tables in the middle of the room so you can sit and eat while you take a break from gaming.

If you come a bit earlier- 6-7pmish you won't have to wait for machines to play...it seems to get crowded after 9pm.

When the feeling of nostalgia hits definitely come here for just a fun time.  It will definitely take you back to your youth (assuming you were a 80s or early 90s kid!!"}
{"text":"Tilt is so much fun! Lots of old 80s and 90s games, especially great if you're nostalgic!

All the games are free to play, just pay the $5 cover. I think it's totally worth it. We didn't try any of the food, but the beer was not bad! Maybe next time we go. 

The only thing is that a bunch of the games were broken when we went, and the crocodile smashing game is totally rigged! And the Skee ball at the back only has one ball, so each game takes forever. Still it's so much fun! They have a game console and couch too, it was probably an N64? Not sure though, it was really dark! 

Definitely worth a visit!"}
{"text":"A really chill and fun place for a few hours - somehting different from the usual bar scene. 
Amazing chili cheese fries, good local beer.
Only beef would be that a few games didn't work and it was impossible to find anyone to service them. Staff are kinda invisible, aside from the folks behind the bar
*No Punch-Out ... no happy."}
{"text":"They don't have much of a beer selection. This place is okay if you're just looking for an arcade but there are cooler places. The food isn't that great either. It is popular enough though, you'll usually have to wait in line for a half hour outside to get in before you have to wait again for each game."}
{"text":"First time here, and what an experience! 

A little disappointed on the cover charge so early in the day (we arrived at opening time), however with drinks in hand it was quickly forgotten. 

A great atmosphere with a great selection of games. There is quite a bit of pinball machines, so if you fancy that this is your place to be. 

Beer is bubbly and refreshing, food is affordable (However I was disappointed in the Dulce Lece doughnuts. Very dry, not very tasty and a lack of the filling.)

Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Probably one of my favourite places to get my retro pinball arcade action on. Honestly, even if you aren't into this - you will be because the place is so chill.

For a small fee at the door, like five dineros,  you can play all night. The best part is everything you could munch on is cheap - drinks and simple greasy food. 

I had a great time here because I am such a fan of this type of fun. Good, old wholesome fun with friends and on your own. 

Yes, it is busy on the weekends but worth the wait.

Time flies by pretty fast. Be prepared to laugh and immerse yourself in old school games."}
{"text":"I cam here as I was in the area on Friday. The place charges $5 entrance fee. They have all you can play arcade games. The games mainly are old arcade games focus on pinball with other fighting and racing games. They also had the NES and N64 which is cool to play in groups of up 4 plays. They had mario cart and super smash bros in the N64 which are amazing games. I spent lots of time playing pinball as I like playing them. They also serve beer and drinks which is amazing, some hot ladies start dancing in the middle of the place which is an add-on. Definitely will comeback, just wish they had better games [less pinball and more of other cool games as some games are really bad]"}
{"text":"It's definitely very decent for a bar to have games you can play. $5 cover you can play arcade games as much as you want. There's no line ups for a Wednesday night. 

As people praise here as much as possible, I do find some machines weren't working properly. Also because it's unlimited play plus limited selection of games, I got tired of them really fast. 

Feel bad for giving it a 3.5 stars but it's just not my type of bar."}
{"text":"Free arcade games + alcohol, all in the same place? Genius! 

There is a cover charge ($5 on weekdays, $10 on weekends) but you definitely get your money's worth with all the free games. I was impressed with how many things there were to do. Tons of pinball games, whack-a-mole, NES, shooting games, even skeeball! 

The drinks were reasonably priced ($6 for a mason jar of cider) and so was the food. I shared the doughnut holes and fries + gravy with a friend and it was all delicious. My new favourite bar. I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"I really wish I could give a better rating but the place was just too rammed to have an enjoyable experience.

First of all, there was a line to get in on a Friday night at 9:30pm.  They were at capacity!  We were going for my friend's BF's bday and couldn't even get in!  Normally, we would have waited in line, but BOY, when there is a cold weather alert and it is minus 6538563, it ain't gonna happen.  We decided to go to a pub down the street instead to let the line cool off (literally) and come back later.  Once we were done at the pub we decided once more to go by and check if there was a line.  THERE was a line.  Geez.  So we decided to hit up The Original Gyro around the corner.  Killed some time there.  It is now midnight.  We decided to try Tilt once more and hallelujah, no line...but still a wait.  We waited about 5 minutes till we were let in.

The place was rammed, obvz at capacity, but you could still somewhat move around freely. The turn around time to play the games are pretty quick.  Surprisingly not all of them are being played all the time.  I wish there were more fighting arcade games like mortal kombat or tekken.  I would've been all over those.  I did get to play some games.  Pacman, pinball and some tetris.  It's super cool that they're all free.

The washrooms are downstairs and I can see this being very dangerous when you're drunk.  The women's washroom was flooded with something because the whole floor was soaked when I opened the door.  I was not about that and decided I didn't need to pee that bad.  GROSS.

Anyways, I think this place would be much more enjoyable when it's not rammed and you can have a casual night out with some friends.  Oh ya and coat check was full when we finally got in, so I had to wear my winter coat all night,  *eye roll"}
{"text":"Despite this being my second time here, I absolutely love this place. Both times I've brought some friends and they've all loved it. They couldn't believe it that they only pay the cover (unless you buy food and/or alcohol, of course) and you play whatever games you want. It has definitely become a favourite spot of mine! 

Keep in mind--if you go here on the weekend and depending on the weather, it'll be busy. Most games will be in use but everyone's nice enough to not hog. It's great for socializing, birthdays, last minute plans, and more! They've also got coat check for $2 (not sure if this will be just a winter thing) if you don't want to leave your belongings on a table/stool."}
{"text":"I had a fun visit to Tilt on a recent Thursday evening. It's $5 cover and then you get unlimited games. If you don't have cash you can pay your cover up at the bar with a card, which is very nice. We didn't try food but it all looked good and exactly what you'd want to eat while playing video games. My husband is a video game connoisseur (snob?), and was not satisfied by the games selection, but I am happy just to play Super Mario 1, so I was more than satisfied. The track and field game was also pretty fun."}
{"text":"Someone say blast from the past? This place is absolutely incredible and so much fun. The place is pretty dope. The bar/club is packed with retro old school arcade games back from the early 80's and 90's. You get to pretty much relive your childhood in playing, Street Fighter 2, TRON, Ninja Turtles (gotta play that!!), Jitz, Nintendo 64, Wack-A-Mole, NES, old school pinball and many more! All the games are free so no need bring in a bag load of 25 cents to keep continuing if you fail at a game. That is one the of most awesome features. You're able to play the game until your done (and potentially hog the entire machine) lol. 

Came here on Friday which is their peak days including weekends and cover was $5 (That is really cheap!). Usually only Monday and Tuesdays are the cheapest days. Mondays is free cover and Tuesdays is $2 (Toonie Tuesday). 

They always got a DJ spinning new music and old school beats. There is a mini area to order food and a bar for drinks. Drinks are pretty good but typical at any other clubs/bars you may go to within Toronto. 

The place is pretty small, so when it gets busy the places gets packed and there really little room to walk around places and squeeze into playing a game because right in the centre of the place are long tables and couple of chairs where most people tend to chill, or nearby a game they are waiting for. So my suggestion is if you want to play a game you have to budge in for it and zip in when the last person is about to leave or else someone else will take over and you'll never get a chance to play. 

Good crowd, fun games, great place to come with a group of friends that enjoy gaming and beer =)"}
{"text":"I've been to a few arcade/bars and this is probably the first one that I've thoroughly enjoyed due to a heavier focus on the games.

Staff: Didn't have much interaction but everyone was pleasant. Greeted by a hostess at the front, paid the $5 charge and in we went! The bartender also greeted us hello as we walked by.

Ambience: It's dark but not too dark, so you can see well enough to navigate and well enough to see the games.

Games: Many games to play. More pinball machines, so that was a nice change from some other places. Amongst the games you got classics like Tetris, Donkey Kong, Ms Pacman, TMNT, Pacman, Bubble Bobble, Bust a Move/Puzzle Bobble and Mario Bros. In addition, I saw a classic NES console, a N64 as well, and a foosball table. I will say that some games got stuck but overall they were well maintained.

Overall, a cool place to hang with a different change of pace. Came on a Sunday before dinner and it was pretty quiet. Basically had choice of which games to play. Added bonus was the ability to go in and out."}
{"text":"Really cool bar! Visited on a Friday night and of course it was packed and hot. We didnt get to play all the games as there was a lot of people in the bar. They have a small selection of beer and food, which wasn't too bad, except they could give more fries. They have many pin ball machines, old school arcade games, and even gaming systems (n64 + NES). A few cons: limited seating, games are too close to each other, and limited food selection. 

Other than that, I would visit again, but probably not on a busy night."}
{"text":"Tilt is a great bar to come and have a good time with friends. Would also be a great place for a date. I went on a Monday and paid $5 for two of us to get in, which seemed to be the nights special. After that you can play unlimited arcade games. Loved the old school games."}
{"text":"I went here on a date two months ago and had a lot of fun. I went on a weekday evening and it was less busy. It was great because I didn't have to wait long for any of the gaming machines, except for skeeball. Not sure if I had to wait long or if I was unusually impatient because it's my favourite game lol. For $5 cover, it was totally worth it. Just be careful because time seems to pass by faster here and before you know it, it's been 1.5-2 hours later."}
{"text":"Lots of fun with the games, the beers were good but a bit pricey. Didn't try the food."}
{"text":"Went there with a few friends on a Friday at 9pm. There was $5 cover.

Atmosphere (2-5 stars depending on time):
When we arrived there was some light music playing and we played a lot of games.  (5 stars).
Around 10:30 the place got really crowded, and a DJ started playing music.  The music was good, but just blaringly loud to the point where it got unpleasant to listen to it.   It also got really crowded and we left shorty after.  (2 stars)


Drinks: (4 stars)
The drinks are pretty decently priced, I tried the Tilt beer (a pint for $5) but I would NOT recommend it at all.  The taste was horrible.
The second drink I got was gin and tonic, and it was good.

Games (4 stars):
Most of the games are pinball (some of the machines should be serviced a bit, but overall they work good).  They got a few classic games: Mario, Mortal Kombat, Street Fighter, one shooting game, one wack a crocodile game (really fun, especially if you try to beat your friends scores).
Overall, the games are good until 10:30, at which point it just becomes too hectic."}
{"text":"This is hands down the greatest bar ever. $5 for unlimited play. Good snacks, good beer, awesome arcade games! The DJ on friday night was amazing."}
{"text":"I was bored one week night , or sad  , so my hubby brought me here. And then boredom was history! 

The place is next to greenP parking which is 4$ an hour, with no maximum limit, so park somewhere else, you are gonna spend at least 3-4 hours here. 
Then pay the cover charges, on by cash-5$ per person. Fair enough, coz now you are into game zone, and which are all covered . All you need to find the machine/ game table to play. Its too much fun. Drinks and food are priced very reasonable, there are many vegan/ vegetarian options . I loved the veggie Chicago dog- Overloaded with toppings! 
Chickpea curry was okay, pop-corns and fries fine too. But who whose to Tilt for food. It is a place for Arcade games. And I was surprised by the crowd on a week night. I assume weekends would be a line up there.

But I enjoyed a lot. I might not go there frequently, but it is an unique kind of pubs in Toronto! Worth a visit.

Coat check is -2$: but every table has coat hook, so no need to coat check."}
{"text":"Such a dope place. Tilt, thank you for blessing Toronto with your presence. Great selection on tap, a laid-back vibe (other than the competitive spirit in the air), and a crazy selection of old-school pinball machines and arcade games. 

My friend and I came right as they opened - 6pm - on a Friday night, but this new business has clearly already struck the hearts of the community, because it was swinging in no time. Awesome awesome selection of two player games, so definitely come in pairs/quads/hundreds. Actually not the last one, because I wouldn't want a lineup at my favourite of the night - the Street Fighter II Champion Edition pinballer. 

I know so many people who would love this place, and you betcha I'm coming back with 'em. It takes a special kind of establishment where I'm certain you could have fun with anyone. Even if you don't like them, even if it's an awkward first date (it wasn't tonight - a date or awkward), you're going to have a blast (especially if drinks are involved). $5 cover is nothing compared to the entertainment value of this super unique gem. We didn't grab food here, but it smelled really yummy. Super well maintained and spotless games despite the high turnover of players. Cool washrooms with individual sinks inside the stall. Jukebox. Long live Tilt Arcade Baaar!!"}
{"text":"We went to Tilt back in November when we went to Canada for the weekend. We almost missed this spot, but the owner was outside, spreading the word since it had just opened. He told us the games were on freeplay and there was food. Honestly, he had us at food, oddly enough. We had been trying to find a restaurant to go to when he told us about the place. So we said, fuck it. Why not?

We went in and had a few drinks then began to look around, my girlfriend opting to play pinball and me and a buddy playing Fatal Fury (or King of Fighters, it was so damn long ago). Overall, the vibe was great. The food is pretty good, or as good as barfood will get, but the games and drinks is what you come for. We spend about an hour or so inside, but what made this place the best was customer service.  We honestly spent more time talking with the owner than in playing games because he was that chill. He actually cared enough to ask for feedback and was honestly good to talk to. 

Tilt will be a staple in our trips to Toronto. Hopefully the Chicago dog will be up to par."}
{"text":"I went on a date here and we had a great time! The old-school arcade games are unlike anything you will find in the city. Your $5 cover includes all the games, no need to buy tokens.
My only complaint is that they don't have a drink menu, you just have to order off the top of your head. I ordered a margarita and the bartender didn't know how to make it. At least they allow ins and outs so you can have a drink at another nearby bar on Bloor and come right back to play"}
{"text":"i can imagine how busy this place can get closer to the weekend, so try to get there at opening (6PM) if you want to try out most of the arcade games. we went on a Tuesday and it was only $2 cover, stayed for a few hours, didn't get too busy. since the games are free play, it'd be tempting to stay on as long as you can. but don't forget be mindful of others who'd want to play too!"}
{"text":"Awesome place. It's an arcade bar, which is always fun, but they are among the best. On Saturday afternoon, it was $5 to get in but unlimited free games from then on. They have a nice mix of pinball, arcades (TMNT, etc), plus a few couches with consoles set up. I had a chance to play some NES  and N64 during my visit. It's beer and games, don't overthink it, just go."}
{"text":"This place is awesome if you want to just hang out and have a good time with some old school arcade games. There were a tonne of pinball machines and even a skee-ball game at the back. The open layout with games all along the walls was on-point. Whether you come with a group or wanting to make new friends, this is the place to be. I didn't try any of the food but the drinks were good (and cheap!). At the time it was a $5 cover but the games were all free.

Would definitely go again."}
{"text":"Super cool place to go chill and have fun with friends, the beers and food have decent prices and it's located in a cool kinda alley too"}
{"text":"At first, I was really aggravated for having to wait an hour in line before even getting into the place. What about this place was so good that people were willing to fare the elements? It's because it's $5 cover, and then it's unlimited free play for all the games inside! 

They had a good selection of pinball games and retro style arcade games. They're the same as the other generic barcades that I've visited in other cities, with the exception of the free play for a cover where as others are either pay by token per game, or has a drink requirement. They had a DJ there on Saturday night playing rock/electronic music so that changed the vibe a little bit. 

Even though it was really crowded, we were still able to play a good selection of the games. People generally understood to take turns and share."}
{"text":"So far my only 5-star review on Yelp, and very deserving of it! This place has amazing cheap food, great games that are free (after the $5 cover) and a very fun crowd.

The first time I went, we were met by a lot of fun, sharing people - half drunk and wanting to play furiously competitive Mario Kart, or challenging me and a friend to some soccer/foosball. The bouncer does count heads as you enter, but it was pretty packed. In a good way, however, as there was still place to sit and eat and games to play. 

The second time I went, however, there was a birthday party going on with some very obnoxious players of Mario Kart, who hogged the Nintendo 64 in the back. Of course this isn't reflected in the rating, because it's not the fault of Tilt itself, but I was just disappointed that fully-functioning (sober, I might add) adults seemed to not know how to share things. They would only give up a controller to another part of their pack and didn't even give up couch space for anyone. 

Anyways. The food is great! Mostly under $6 (? I believe), hot steaming corn dogs, chili fries (SOO GOOD) and pretty filling grub all around. Drinks were not too bad either, I think my friends paid about $6 a shot? Which was alright.

All in all, I'm definitely going to miss this place if it does end up coming down at the end of the year...hope they can win their legal battle. And if not, I'm going to try to spend as many weekends here as I can before that."}
{"text":"Awesome place. Went on a Tuesday so no cover, amazing. The games are all unlocked so you can play till your hearts content. Also they had two different corners with couches setup for golden eye and Mario cart. If I lived in the area this would be my hang out spot. The snack bar has some fun stuff."}
{"text":"went on a Saturday for the first time and it was a good fun crowd a mix of ppl there for serious \"gaming\" and some ppl chilling and a rare small group (5 of us) who were rocking out to the DJ old school hip hop mixes and pop music. bartenders were pretty good at getting us beers quickly for us to return to where the arcade action was, but it's a bit too loud for talking across the table. fun arcade games, good vibes, good times!"}
{"text":"Went with a buddy on a Friday at around 11pm. Cover was 5$ for AYCP (P for play!) but they do have specials throughout the week as well.

We waited in line for about 8 minutes with 3-4 parties ahead of us. The bouncer told us he makes sure to keep the capacity lower than the max allowed in order for everyone to be able to have their turn at playing. Awesome!

Live music was a surprise! It was appropriate for the environment (think intense gamer music) however, it did get a bit loud at times.

We were hungry so we got food. $5.75 for a huge portion of poutine! We got the traditional poutine and the chili-cheese. Seriously, it tasted homemade! SO GOOD! 

For 5 bucks (or less) I would recommend this place to anyone! There are a plethora of game options between console, foosball or the classic pinball machines (which won my heart) for anyone out there. The retro vibes were unreal."}
{"text":"Tilt is a super chill and casual arcade bar that has a great selection of retro gaming machines! All of their games are free to play as well, so there's no need to search for the change machine. Just pay the $5 cover fee and play until your heart's content =) 

The arcade selection has many of your classics from the 80's and early 90's, and includes titles such as Pacman, Donkey Kong, Street Fighter and the like. They also have a good selection of pinball machines which were all in good working order. Despite the high usage of their games, every arcade cabinet was well maintained and worked smoothly. A great thing to see since most of these things are rare treasures now =)

Tilt also has a huge selection of beers and drinks on their menu, with the average pint costing only $7. The food here seemed popular as well, though I didn't get to try any of it on my first visit.

Overall, a great place to grab a drink and experience some nostalgia with old school games! Best to come early on weekends if you want to avoid lineups though-the place gets packed and lively at night =)"}
