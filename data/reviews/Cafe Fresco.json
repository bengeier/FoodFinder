{"text":"I was visiting from California and ran across this place.  The owners were very friendly and took the time to have a conversation with me.  They serve coffee/espresso, tea, lattes, Italian sodas along with delicious homemade baked goods and wraps.  They easily accommodate gluten allergies (such as mine) with their flourless chocolate cake and rice pudding.  Both were delicious as was the Italian soda I tried.

This is exactly the type of business I love to support.  A non-chain where many of the items are made from scratch in-house.  Couple that with friendly owners that appreciate their customers and take the time to talk with them and you have the perfect recipe for a great local business.

Do yourselves a favor and come try them out, you won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"This is such a cute coffee shop, with fantastic coffee! I've tried several flavored coffee latte's as well as the Chai Latte, and all were delicious. The service is great as well - the two young men up at the front are always helpful and super nice, and the coffee comes up real quick. 
I've tried their banana bread and it was fluffy, very fresh, with the perfect amount of sweetness. Overall reasonably priced, comparable with Starbucks and second cup, but supporting local business. Wonderful - will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Love the ambiance at this new cafe! I recommend the Caramel Macchiato there. Better than I've had anywhere else."}
{"text":"An update:  now serving beer & wine!  Gorgeous patio with music just up from the new Tuscany LRT. Awesome spot for a catchup with a friend or two - whether coffee or the new bevvie options. Great views of the changing fall colors around COP"}
{"text":"Went for a walk and a latte last week. Seems like the kinks have been worked out for this place and unlike the convenience store across the parking lot, they have established enough business to pay the rent. Latte was very good and I could smell the quality flavour bean aroma when I walked in. Prompt friendly service and no skimping or over sweetening on the vanilla latte."}
{"text":"I can't get enough of the coffee. The flavour is magic and I have ordered brewed coffee and specialty coffees...all were perfect pour, perfect temperature and hit the spot. I recently had a friend pick up four large brewed coffee to go so I could serve it at my brunch instead of serving the swill I make at home.
I usually go to Cafe Fresco after boot camp so have not tried too many of the baked goods, what I have tried was fresh and amazing!! Some major talent is baking in that kitchen. My friend says the breakfast wraps are super delish and we are both excited that they serve wine and beer now so we can walk there in the evening sometime and enjoy an adult beverage. 
The fact that the place is getting busier and busier reflects the quality of product and service provided."}
{"text":"Love this place. Nice atmosphere, nice people who work there. Coffee options and food are good. Only comment I can make for improvement, prices are a little too high. Medium coconut milk latte and a banana bread cost over $9.... With all that being said, I love to support local. I'll keep going there. I recommend people give it a try!"}
{"text":"It's a great spot to meet friends and relax. In addition, it's a good place to bring the computer or a notepad and just do some work."}
{"text":"New local coffee shop in the neighborhood!  When I arrived it was quiet busy, however they were all enjoying their beverages and there was no line up.

Owners and staff are super friendly. Ordered a Carmel macchiato and was told the cheesecake was fresh and so delicious. They twisted my arm. I ordered a piece to go to enjoy later at home.  Both were great.

The prices are to be expected and about the same as Starbucks.
 Inside, it's modern with comfortable decor.  Perfect place to meet with friends and sit back and relax. Would also be great for casual meetings. 

Happy to support this new local business! Will be back."}
{"text":"Nice place for coffee and quick snack.
The off-grid location, quite and modern interiors make it pretty good place for hangout with friends and family.

I have stopped going to starbucks since i've been here!"}
{"text":"Great place to meet up with friends! The place is open and airy and you will always find a place to sit! Great coffee and snacks too!"}
{"text":"Top of the line coffee, local owners are great, new street mall and great atmosphere.  We are already a regular at it.. It's just going to get better and better.."}
{"text":"Fantastic atmosphere! They have lots of food, sweet and drink selections. The food and drinks were decent. The biggest selling point for me is the great atmosphere and friendly staff. The music wasn't too loud and the AC was just the right coolness. I would be back with a book next time to try a hot drink!"}
{"text":"I never got a chance to try the food but the drinks are great. Also great service and cute decor. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Awesome describes this place. Excellent coffee, lots of space and a large south facing patio make this place a coffee destination. Located in the heart of Royal Oak/Rocky Ridge just up from the Tuscany CTrain station. Ideal for coffee date night and they serve wine & beer. Gluten Free options are available."}
{"text":"Cafe Fresco is a great place to go with friends to relax and hang out. Everything I have tried here is exceptional. The banana bread is the best I have ever tasted, super delicious. Lots of different options on the menu, impossible not to find something you love that will keep you coming back! Great owners, keep up the awesome work !"}
{"text":"I love Caf√© Fresco!  I like the service, the spacious restaurant, and of course, the food and beverages!

Ordered:

- Green Tea Latte, no foam - Very nice and refreshing!
- Mediterranean Wrap - Delish!  Served nice and warm, cheese all oozy!
- Chicken Pesto Flatbread - Another Delish!  I like that boconcini and that touch of balsamic vinegar.
- Greek Salad - THE BEST Greek Salad I've ever had!  Crunchy pieces of tomato, cucumber, green pepper and red onion slices and loaded with feta crumbly bits.  Best dressing ever!

Will be back, for sure!"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. Their drip coffee tastes great. One of the few places in town where I don't need to add cream to my coffee, tastes great without it. The owners are both really nice and will generally spark a conversation with you."}
