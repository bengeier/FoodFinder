{"text":"Zero for the food; 1 star for service; 5 star for the view on the lake. Is great place to drink a glass of wine and look at the lake and mountains. Food is bad period. Don't even try.."}
{"text":"I thought this was a great hotel.  The location was perfect and the staff was very friendly and accommodating.  Rooms were comfortable, typical european with some extra frills of antique and velvet furniture.  Bathroom was typical for Europe - tub with a shower head.  Only drawback for us was no refrigerator - we had to keep a medicine in the restaurant which was no problem.  Wifi worked fine. We had a beautiful view of the lake and mountains from our window.  The breakfast room felt like an old castle and I loved all the colors of the furniture.  Cappucinos were good and the remainder of the breakfast selection was adequate and typical.  We were staying with a large group of friends and were able to enjoy a beautiful cocktail hour on the terrace of one of their rooms, helped by the bar letting us use their wine opener and chilling our many bottles of wine.  For the money, I was very surprised at the quality and service."}
{"text":"Ate dinner by the lake. The pasta was surprisingly divine -- we had the pesto tortelli and the tomato/cheese pecharri. Service was speedy and the sunset over the mountain beautiful. Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Had dinner at the Florence Restaurant and it was great. We stared with a deliciously fresh Minestrone and and asparagus avocado salad. Splitting a main course of black cod on lentils with artichokes. So yummy. The atmosphere under the full blooming wisteria, on the lakefront was perfecto!"}
{"text":"Wow! Think James Bond here. The hotel is beutifull and right on the water of lake como.   This is very much a boutique hotel. The rooms are beautifully decorated (as is the whole hotel). Bed and bathroom was perfect.   Hotel staff were amazing and super friendly and helpful. Everyone was amazing.   Quite simply you have to visit."}
{"text":"Au centre ville de Bellagio, on a d'un coté de la route, l'hôtel le Florence et de l'autre une terrasse qui lui appartient.  Elle fonctionne indépendamment de l'établissement, il est pas nécessaire d'être client pour y accéder. C'est parmi ces emplacements parfaits pour siroter un verre tout en profitant d'un panorama exceptionnel.  C'est plus cher que certains de ses voisins mais on trouve largement son compte quand aux portions servis, quantité double par rapport à ailleurs tant en boissons légères que alcoolisés."}
{"text":"The rooms here are fine. I have a partial lake view. That is the best part. Sparse and not beautiful. Charming but not luxurious. My room has a small bathtub with a hand held shower wand that basically means I have to sit in the tub to shower. Beds lack comfortable pillows and bedding. The service here by the front staff is horrible. They act as if they would rather be having a root canal than helping you, particularly the woman who works during the day. Calling to ask about the internet seems to be a big problem for her and I have discovered why, it doesn't work. You have it for one minute then not again. I had internet two days intermittently, and now it doesn't work. It's a shame because if she was nice and helpful I would say stay here, but they lack common courtesy and forget that the hotel business is a service industry. So I will not stay here again. Ciao Hotel Florence. Non ci vediamo...I want to add that today the restaurant waiters out front were extremely rude to our group. As we sat and painted at the closed tables before they were open he came and literally yelled at us to tell us we were not allowed to sit there even though we had 8 rooms at the hotel and we offered to buy drinks and food.so therefore I have now moved this hotel to a ONE minus star."}
{"text":"Ok Yelpers are missing out on this place big time!!  Only one Yelp review!  This place is awesome. You sit outside right on the lake under tree trellises. Beautiful!!  The food is origami and unique. We had ravioli with lemon grass, cheese and a hint of ginger in a asparagus butter purée. Yum! Then we had little green balls of pasta with green beans a ball of fresh cheese in a carrot sauce. Super Yum!  Then we had a filet topped with like a pound of fresh shaved black truffle. Another Yum!  We had lamb chops also but the other dishes were so awesome it made the lamb chops seem pedestrian even though they were very good   I hope this gets some more Yelpers to try the place. It deserves more attention.   It's across the street from the Florence Hotel and adjacent to Villa Serbelloni. You can't miss it and shouldn't."}
