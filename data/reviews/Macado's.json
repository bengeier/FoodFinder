{"text":"Sunday at 8p. Not many people here at all. We were seated for 10-15 min, and no one came to take our drink order. We were nicely greeted at the front though. Guess there was a disconnect between the hostess and waitstaff."}
{"text":"Great food, great prices & great specials!  Service is usually fabulous, sometimes it lacks but I don't mind for the price I'm paying.  Most of the tables are separated- lots of booths - so we can easily take our kids & not disturb anyone on a date.  They have a good kids menu & the servers are very accommodating with the kiddos. I really like eating here!!"}
{"text":"They had a Great variety of sandwiches and burgers. Their menu was Reasonable price. The Service is not too bad either. I will Definitely come back."}
{"text":"A sandwich option exists for every human on the planet at this place.  And the menu is really confusing so you'll probably discover new ones as time goes on.  I have gotten gentleman drunk here quite a few times and always left happy."}
{"text":"I always get the custer's last stand it is very good nice people good atmosphere free wifi"}
{"text":"Stopped in for their Monday special of the 44cent wings, and it was the best dinner DECISION EVER. My husband and I really enjoyed the atmosphere, customer service and of course the food!!! We topped our dinner off with the Madison Mud pie which was the BEST dessert we've had since moving to Charlotte... this is place is a MUST."}
{"text":"I should have known better than to order a chicken and broccoli fettuccini at a bar and grille, but I didn't want a sandwich. The chicken was rubbery, obviously not fresh. They forgot the broccoli, so I asked for it and they brought 3 dry, tiny broccoli florets for me to add. Not enjoyable. We got a fruit cup, with fruit that wasn't fresh either. On the bright side, the shrimp appetizer was good with 10 nice sized shrimp. I'm glad we got the shrimp otherwise it would have been a total let down."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants! I hate that the Concord Mills location closed down, however, I'm happy this location opened up. I usually order my food to go here but when I come to dine in the staff is very quick to take my order. My favorite things on the menu are the wings and the macaroni. I honestly think the wings are one of the best in Charlotte. The wings combine the perfect sauce and a good crunch."}
{"text":"Really great sandwiches. Service is less than great but I don't rate a restaurant by the wait staff if I did there would be a lot of 2.5 when I want a great sandwich I go to Macados!"}
{"text":"Macado's has one of the most diverse menus I've ever seen. The descriptions of each dish sound delicious! Unfortunately, Macado's just doesn't deliver when it comes to their potential. If the food was good, this restaurant would be one of my absolute favorites. This place needs to increase the quality of their ingredients. Very sub-par restaurant."}
{"text":"I've been able to go here twice now and so far I really like it. The place has lots of curious things on the walls to look at, though I don't care very much for one of the decorations which contains a racist caricature.
I've had their Cowpoke sandwich, which is delicious, and their potato skins are awesome. The menu has a lot of items, which can be a bit overwhelming for a first timer, but they have great daily deals and you get a filling amount of food for a good price.
The service is quick and helpful, and I've had only positive experiences here so far. I'll definitely be returning here soon!"}
{"text":"Damn good sandwich- roast beef and bacon with Swiss on rye bread. The house chips are sort of mediocre, but the cheese fries are good. I like the extensive custom drink menu, and the sandwich options are really nice. 

The restaurant itself is sort of bland, but the server was nice enough and when there was a problem with my sandwich I got a replacement back really quickly. Really reasonably priced too. I'd go back if I wanted a sandwich that wasn't from Subway."}
{"text":"My boyfriend loves it so I am going to give it a 3 though there is really not thing I can find that I like.

He likes Grilled chicken Sandwich. 
I have ordered wings, not that great"}
{"text":"Food is okay, not a big fan of getting an actual bag of lays chips with my meal. Prices are cheap but they really need better service. Could benefit from a college night or something of the sort. Not a repeat location."}
{"text":"My mom and I love this place. Fried pickles are a must and salads/burgers are amazing. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Macado's is the perfect stop for a drink or small meal before seeing a movie at Concord Mills mall.  My wife and I stopped by here on our very first date before seeing a movie.  It is a quiet laid back atmosphere.

If you are looking for sandwiches or small snack items this place is hard to beat.  They have a small bar area, but a large seated area, all booths.  The food is relatively inexpensive and they have an interesting mix of sandwiches.

My favorite is the Johnny D,  it is chicken, pepperoni, and provolone served on a bagel. 

Also they have several TVs in the bar area if you are wanting to watch some sports while the wife is shopping :)"}
{"text":"Pro's about this restaurant is that the place is in a great location and very close to the university. Another pro is that it's affordable. Con is that the food all taste like it's frozen and not fresh."}
{"text":"We went in and ordered a spinach artichoke dip and it was great! Ordered 2 sandwiches from their very broad menu with lots of options. Sandwiches were good with good meats but my bun was a little burnt. not too bad. The macaroni in the macaroni salad was undercooked. Service was good and prompt with coming back and checking on us. Overall good experience."}
{"text":"We were a party of four. We started with Granda Nachos, they were very good. Then we each ordered the sandwich of our choice and they were all good to very good. But the sandwiches took 40min to get to the table after the nachos. The restaurant was about half full so it wasn't that the kitchen was overwhelmed, it was just slow. Our server did a very good job and we tipped her accordingly, not her fault the kitchen was slow. 
I may try it again. But it will be a while."}
{"text":"I like to go to Macao's during my lunch hour as they have a ton of specials throughout the week. I specifically like their mushroom burger. I've had it several times and each time it is cooked to perfection!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place!  Fantastic sandwich options, i got the Pendleton which was hot pastrami, turkey, 1000 Island, served on rye bread topped off with coleslaw and housemade potato chips.  Yum i think there was some cheese in there too.  Got a side of coleslaw which was also delicious, couldn't finish that as i ate my whole large sandwich.  Great prices too i got that with a Blue Moon and my bill was only $12!  Will definitely return here."}
{"text":"Not a fan. Came in with a group of friends. Sat down and sat there for 15 minutes, and no one came and ask if we wanted a drink menus nothing. We got up and left. Screw this place. Oh the place was not crowed at all dead actually."}
{"text":"Based on the reviews and the location  (this area ain't exactly a food mecca), I was a little frightened but rather not get sucked into Ikea to eat at the cafeteria and end up with new furniture. So first, 2 hostesses greeted me and I was seated promptly in the bar area.  Kinda reminds me of Ale House or Benigans.  Bartender took my order and advised me that burger would take 10-15 minutes which is greatly appreciated when you're at lunch and need to be somewhere in an hour, mainly work.  Bacon cheeseburger with coleslaw came out in 8 minutes, burger cooked to my specifications and coleslaw is vinegar based and not syrup based, yum. She checked on me once which is how it should be (promptly got my spicy mustard) and left me alone to eat. Burger was large and tasty, my only issue would be that the bacon was well, limp. I would like my bacon crispy please.  All in all a surprisingly good lunch choice in the University area and I'll be back."}
{"text":"We like to come here after Hornets games. The food is good. I just wish the service was better. The concord mills location had this problem as well."}
{"text":"I went to the bar.  I was interested in their drink specials.  The bartender was very nice and fast getting my food and drinks.  Food was great and the drinks were not watered down."}
{"text":"I ordered hot wings and potato skins to go. The skins were pretty good but honestly the wings were gross. I'm pretty sure they were frozen. They had some kind of breading/coating on them that wasn't crispy and the wings were VERY salty."}
{"text":"Not my Macado's I remember in Boone,NC.  Place was empty and food took awhile to come out."}
{"text":"Was very upset with our experience tonight. We love it here normally. We wanted something late-night seeing as how I'm in the service industry and don't get off work until 10pm or later. We check the times online and it says they're open til 12:30am. We arrive at 11:15pm and check the hours on the door that say open until 12:30am, but the door was locked. We go in through the bar and all the stools were up. There were about 5 different groups of people sitting in booths or standing at the bar. The bartender promptly informs us they're closed. When I ask when do they close on Wednesdays she says normally 12:30 am but they didn't have enough business to stay open. Yet there were at least ten customers just in the bar area. If they have varying closing hours it should be specified online and on their door. From working in restaurants for 6 years I know that they don't close early while there are customers still dining/drinking AND over an hour early. 
Thanks for the wasted trip."}
{"text":"We stopped by Macado's one day while shopping at Concord Mills Mall.  The jungle/safari theming looked interesting, but that's where it ended.  The food and service were just average, and our waitress wasn't even sure what happy hour was.  What can you expect from a mall restaurant, though, right?  In fact, it's one of the only sit-down restaurants in the mall.  That's probably the only reason it's still there.   My advice?  Wait 'til you leave the mall and hit one of the many restaurants between the mall and I-85."}
{"text":"I just left Macado's with my family and I was very impressed with the food it was hot and everything was very tasty. We had the Fried Pickles, Potato Wedges, Quesadillas, and some of the sandwiches. 

The host greeted us with a smile and the waiter was very nice but I thought he lacked knowledge of the menu and when we asked what was good it's seemed as though he's never even eaten at the place. 

The pricing was decent on avg $8 for a sandwich but they make up for it on the expensive sodas. 
The menus are too large in size and very hard to read as has too many items and I doubt if the sandwiches vary that much in nature to have 50 plus sandwiches on a menu and for that reason I can't even remember the name of my sandwich. 

The waiter didn't pick up one single dish while we was there so we ate with appetizer plates and trash on the table the entire time. 

The decor in the place needs updating I think they would serve themselves better to spend some money on the interior and the exterior that looks like the 90s. 

I heard this was a college spot that the students visit during the school year but in the summer time when families are out looking for a bite this place may get passed over simply because it doesn't look family friendly. Great food but yet the place was empty ! 

Overall I gave it a 3 stars but had the waiter picked up the plates and had knowledge or suggestions for a first time customer and the decor was better I would of gave it a 4 or 5 star for the food alone it was so delicious."}
{"text":"Love the hamburgers and sandwiches here. I work in the university area from time to time and I always try to stop in for lunch. While I don't drink, the restaurant does have a full bar and televisions to watch ongoing sporting events. This is definitely a good place to try if your looking for something a little better then a franchise burger."}
{"text":"The food was good and the service was good.  Good ambiance, sort of 'sports bar' relaxed feel.  Unfortunately I cannot tolerate MSG so I can't come back."}
{"text":"After driving by Macado's countless times, we decided to give it a try on a rainy Sunday. At 1pm, it seemed relatively quiet. We were seated quickly; our server came over quickly and got our drink orders. She came back with the drinks and took our food orders. We ordered an appetizer of the warm pretzels; my dining companion ordered the black & blue salad; I ordered the pretzel dog.

After that, things went downhill. It took a while for our appetizer to show up (warm pretzels, not bad, 3.5/5 stars.) We finished them, we finished our drinks, and we sat. The table near us that was seated after us, and also ordered appetizers, was served their entree. We sat with empty drinks. We sat. And then we sat. 

Eventually, our server showed up with our entrees, with a weird self-deprecating \"FINALLY! Here it is!\" It was strange, like she was acknowledging how frustrating it was that the food was slow, but not an apology. Odd. Since the menu said they served homemade chips, I had ordered my pretzel dog with chips. I figured they'd be homemade. It came with a bag of Ruffles. A bag of Ruffles is fine for a quick-stop deli, but this seemed like the sort of place where they'd at least put the chips on the plate. The pretzel dog was ... okay. The menu said \"1/4 lb dog\" and while I'm not going to weigh my food, this seemed smaller than that. The pretzel wrapped around the dog was tasty, but they'd put the whole thing on a grill for a while, so that one side of the pretzel had become dark and hard and barely edible.

The whole experience just seemed like the entire restaurant staff - the servers and the cook staff - were just phoning it in. I was disappointed - what I'd hoped would be a quick lunch ended up taking about an hour; the food was OK but nothing special. It's possible that they were having an off day, but frankly there are enough good dining options in the University area that I don't see a reason to return to give them another shot."}
{"text":"75 cents for ranch. 4 dollars for a side salad!!! Sinful surroundings. Terrible service. I love this place!!!!"}
{"text":"Huge menu of sandwiches. Maybe too huge as many selections are very similar. Still the food was good. French bread and croissant used for our sandwiches were highlights. Kids loved the pretzel dog. Service could be better."}
{"text":"***this location has closed *** We live close to the mall and this is one of our regular spots. We have been so many times that I guess the \"interesting\" decor is not really noticed anymore. There is everything from Hollywood props of dinosaur busts on the walls....like I said \"interesting\". But it is the food and service that brings us back. We have a picky eater and their Mac and cheese is his fav. My wife and I usually get a sandwich of some sort, there are lots and lots to choose from. You can also build your own sandwich if you desire. Bottom line......great family place inside Concord Mills mall."}
{"text":"I love coming to Macado's on a Monday night to order the wings and a hindy. The Hindy is a huge sandwich that can feed up to four people and on Monday nights they are half priced. 

They also have a special on their wings on Monday nights where they are 35 cents. I go with my husband and take half the sandwich home for lunch the next day. 

Macado's is a small chain and I used to go to the one in Blacksburg Virginia a lot but they all seem to have the same menu and specials. I've been to this particular location twice now and I've loved it though I would advise against ordering a regular reuben. Their turkey reubens are good but the last time I ordered one with the traditional corned beef it was really fatty and super salty."}
{"text":"Food: terrific. I had the Brooklyn Bridge. Meats were great. Pretty sizable portion. Price pretty good. I split a basket of pretzels with another person. Those pretzels are fantastic and probably the best value on the entire huge menu. $4.25 for 3 giant soft pretzels with a vat of nacho cheese. The person I was with got some kind of wrap and that person said it was great. Many, many options on this menu.

Staff: perhaps the worst staff I have ever seen in my life. NICE but just lost and clueless. We were seated and then waited 17 minutes before I had to flag down a staff member just to order drinks. We likely would have been there waiting forever, had I not. We were told there was a mix-up of who was covering table. When we did eventually get a waitress and order the 3 menu items I mentioned above, somehow the waitress only relayed 2 of our items to the kitchen. So we found out when our two entrees came out that she never put our basket of pretzels in (they eventually were brought out after she later put the order in). Wanting to leave before we had any more issues, we gave them our card. When the receipt came back, they had charged our credit card about twice the amount of the original check we were given...(they ran the card on another table's more expensive check). So we had to spend more time waiting for them to cancel one transaction and put the correct one through. Again...we ordered 3 menu items and had all these problems...I did hear the people at the table next to us also have a problem getting a staff member to their table at one point. I couldn't tell whether our waitress was bad, or if it was the entire staff that night but that was rough.

Come for the food, don't expect much from staff."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to this location and I wasn't disappointed.  Located in the oft changed building in the Harris Teeter shopping center, I hope it can remain in business longer than it's predecessors! 

We had a group of 12 celebrating my sister's birthday and the Macado's menu is perfect for a group due to its varied menu!  

My husband and I ordered the chips and queso app and it was okay, nothing special there.  I ordered the Atlantis which had grilled chicken breast, lettuce, roasted red peppers, Swiss, red pepper pesto mayo, hot on ciabatta bread....$7.75.  It was REALLY good.  My husband order a burger and was pleased with how it was cooked and with the fries that accompanied it.

We'd visit again to try something new from the MANY choices!"}
{"text":"I have had a pretty good experience at the Maccado's at concord mills so I figured I would give this one a try.  I don't think I will ever go again.  The service was slow.  The spinach dip was not hot and it seemed like the waiter was unimpressed when we sent it back.  Then when I got my burger it was like a hockey puck.  It was probably cooked for about 5 minutes more than it should have been.  The sandwiches that my wife and brother weren't that impressive either.  Considering this is only about 50 feet from my bento asian restaurant (which is one of my favorites) there would be no reason for me to ever go back here again.  And I love sandwiches."}
{"text":"Been here several times but tonight was the last time.  Ordered an app wanted to charge $1 for extra chips.  Really chips and salsa are free tonight! Then ordered a burger that had sauce on it but wanted to charge me $1 for A1!!!   Really A1.  It's a condiment.  Who charges for that?? Manager was a young kid that didn't care just kept saying ok ok ok.  I'm done!"}
{"text":"Terrible service! My girlfriend and I stopped at Macado's around 9pm on a Sunday night, the place was pretty slow. Our waitress seated us, brought us our drinks and disappeared for 10 minutes. Finally a different server came and took our order. After being there for 35 minutes our food finally came out. The food was great, everything was fresh and as expected.


 However the lack of concern for the slow and poor service was unacceptable. We never got an apology for the wait either. Another couple came in several minutes after us, and received their food before we did. 

Finally, as we walked out the door the two servers at the front desk couldn't even look up to say, \"thanks, come again\" or \"have a good night.\" There are too many good restaurants around that give good service and appreciate their customers to give service like that."}
{"text":"Not impressed! The food was cafeteria grade heated up and given to us in baskets. I've had better hot sauce at Taco Bell. The only reason to come is to drink beer out of the schooner glasses but alas they only have crap beer on tap. First and only visit."}
{"text":"Macado's is a pretty solid, very well themed, if kind of unremarkable casual dining place. The most notable thing is their crazy-extensive menu...it'd be fun to come back and try more of their items, especially their specialties. I went on wing night, and I had a hankering for wings, and let me tell you - their wings can hit the spot. I was pleasantly surprised to find their spicy thai sauce is indeed /quite/ spicy - I needed a ranch to finish it - unexpected, given the nature of the place. I got a second order of BBQ, also, because why not - each order is only $4.50 - and that was a ton of food (I finished maybe half of each).

Mozzarella sticks were, as always, tasty and overpriced. Drinks were solid and decently priced. Overall, a pleasant experience - just nothing that stood out as a trademark."}
{"text":"The one time I went the mcduffie sandwich was great. Breaded chicken with AVACADO cheese and tomato."}
{"text":"Worst. restaurant. ever.  Anything that could have gone wrong did. Poor service, terrible food quality, dirty and nothing was brought out in the order it should have. Booths were all ripped up. It was our first, and last time there. I honestly question how this place is still in business."}
{"text":"Love it but don't order take out, they are super slow and always make mistakes.

I typically get the Chi Chis burrito and split it with someone or the pastrami. So yummy!

Its fun to sit here and people watch too on a busy day at the mall."}
{"text":"great sandwich spot....they have kool-aid....what more could a girl want"}
{"text":"this place is okay but the service seems a bit absent when it comes to taking my order and providing me with regular drinks. The prices are fine but some of the meal qualities are not that good depending on what you get and generally their specials are not the best during the time they are served. The appetizer selection is good in the meal selections vast. if they had better service I would give them 4 stars."}
{"text":"We came here yesterday, and were in a small rush, needing to be in and out in 45 minutes. We've been her many times before, and loved it because it's close to our home. We waited at least 5 minutes, if not longer, to even be greeted. I even watched/heard other servers ask whose table we were.

Our server was new, and knew NOTHING. She was very shy and nervous. 

By the time we were greeted, we were ready to order, but had questions. 

My boyfriend couldn't remember the name of the sandwich he had with roast beef (The Titanic, he gets it every time and loves it), but she didn't know either and thought it was under burgers. 
I ordered the Chicken Parmesan, comes with garlic bread and a salad(chicken and garlic bread is so crispy and flavorful, and the salad is hearty and topped with bacons crumbles.) Luckily, I knew everything that came with it and knew my options, so I walked her through my own order, but I could tell she didn't know what to ask. 

My boyfriend also asked her if Goose Island IPA was on tap still, which she had to go check (it wasn't on tap anymore), but came back with another beer suggestion and responded with \"whatever that is.\" He ended up just ordering a sweet tea, which he waited 45 mins for and ended up getting to go, along with our food because it wasn't ready yet. 

Needless to say, we left angry because the service was slow and the server was not trained properly. When we got home, we also realized my boyfriend never got the potato salad he ordered. I'm giving it two stars just based on bad service.  The food is great, but I do think management needs to make sure their servers know the menu before they are on the floor, this visit almost ruined it for us."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere with a huge menu plus a good selection of adult beverages. That's a hard combination to beat!"}
{"text":"This is me and my boyfriends new go-to restaurant here in the University area. We've been a handful of times since we moved to this area a month ago and we have never been disappointed with the food! Our biggest problem is figuring out what we are going to eat because there's so much to choose from. Love the drink specials.. Can't beat $2.50 margaritas! the service has always been on point, very chill relaxed place with bomb food."}
{"text":"Great place for a beer, and sandwich.  100 percent my favorite cole slaw aside from my own.  The staff is very courteous and prompt. There is normally a game of some type on the television. If you eat in the dinning area, the food is hot or cold as requested and if something isn't right they correct the issue and normally comp something.  Personally I am a huge fan of the chicken salad wrap, and the Chinese grill chicken wrap, my dad likes the roast beef dip.  The cinnamon bun is AMAZING. If you are in the university area and want a sandwich. This is the best place in the area."}
{"text":"Wow what a menu. It is huge and with a nice variety of types of foods. My husband had a delicious roast beef sandwich and French onion soup. I had chicken Alfredo and it came with a huge side salad. We will be coming back here a lot."}
{"text":"CLOSED.  They do have a Charlotte location not far away in University City that is still open. Good food, used to be a favorite in college (Boone) eat there less as I don't frequent sandwich places that often and their non sandwich offerings are limited."}
{"text":"Where do I start? We got fried pickles. Not necessarily the best not the worst. We all got sandwiches and you would've thought they had to go grocery shopping to get the ingredients. We had to chase our waitress Jess down to get mayo for our sandwiches because she was outside with friends and was too busy. It wasn't anything to write home about. I won't be back."}
{"text":"I have enjoyed this place in the past but just stopped there, was seated and then ignored. There were more employees than customers but they were busy talking to each other.  Don't know if this was just a poor crew or if the place is bad."}
{"text":"Had a great dinner at Macado's tonight ! I ordered the Reuben special with fries and it was incredible. Our waitress Elizabeth was extra attentive and helped my friend and I choose what we wanted to order since there are tons of options. Our drinks were tasty as well. Overall a great quick dinner spot"}
{"text":"We've been coming here for years. It was always a great place to take out of state guests due to the huge menu and great drink selections. But honestly, over the last 6 months it has seriously started to go downhill. 

Every time you walk in there are dirty and uncleared tables. The waitresses/waiters are extremely slow with serving you. They do not know the menu so if you have a question, they are of no help. My husband guzzles down water and he never once was able to get his water filled. Where was our waitress? Who knows. 

Food: The chicken parm tasted like boil in a bag. The noodles were hard, the sauce wasn't even sauce- it was tomato paste and the whole meal was cold. 

I ordered pretzels and some spots were soft and chewy and other parts were hard and cold. Served with beer cheese that was ice cold. I asked the waitress if beer cheese was supposed to be served warm and she literally replied \"I don't know.\" So I asked her if she could bring me some warm cheese, which she did about 5 whole minutes later. 

They used to serve meals with homemade chips but now instead give you a prepackaged bag of Ruffles. If you want their homemade chips, it is now only available as an appetizer. 

Also, this latest time we visited (Saturday 4/21), my husband ordered a burger. 48 hours he has not left our bathroom floor. He has literally had his head hung in the toilet for the last 2 days. I called and spoke to the manager who offered gift cards, which we quickly denied. I requested we get our money back from our Saturday's visit and apparently i need to call corporate to do so. The manager is unable to refund us on our card. 

Unfortunately, we will no longer be customers at this establishment. Please proceed with caution if you choose to eat here."}
{"text":"Very good food! Service was fantastic. Friendly happy people. I will be back real soon."}
{"text":"I probably seriously couldn't think of anything bad to say except our waitress was a bit forgetful but seeing that she had been working 9+ hours it was all good. She was still very polite & bubbly! Visiting out of town with a group and we were very pleased with this restaurant. I got the southwestern taco salad with chili which I must say is by far the BEST I've ever had. One of my colleagues got a burger and I had to take a picture of it. It was huge! The restaurant is nice, food was delicious and the staff was cool. I hope we're able to revisit before leaving."}
{"text":"Wow, this place seriously reminds me of Chotchkie's from the movie Office Space. I expected to see Jennifer Aniston with her 15 pieces of flair.

The menu is forever long and takes an eternity to read. Every sandwich has some cute little name. I ordered a chicken salad sandwich which was fair at best. The fries were seriously good though. Otherwise, lackluster food... with flair.

Went there on a Monday for lunch on our way home from vacation. This place was pretty busy with local soccer moms, strollers, high chairs, etc. The prices were on the high side for what you get.

I'm sure there are better food alternatives both in the mall and among the out parcels around here. I will not go back."}
{"text":"By Far one of my Favorite places in the University Area for college students. I think its the universities most underutilized resource for college students. Macado's has food and drink specials every day of the week that are pretty good on real food items and not just something that they want to \"push\" that to empty out inventory. 

The staff is cool and pretty relaxed. This is the perfect place for a group of college students to go out close to campus have decent food and drink and not spend a fortune trying to do it."}
{"text":"For some reason, I always forget Macado's on my restaurant option list, but I definitely need to remember next time! It's a great family-friendly restaurant or a good place to hang out with friends. I visited on a Sunday and they have plenty of TVs to watch football games or other sporting events if that's important to you. The menu is HUGE, mainly consisting of their speciality sandwiches. They also have great appetizers (I ordered the Black Bean Con Queso that was a cheesy dream!), delicious soups/salads, classic burgers and larger dishes like Chicken Parmigiana. Try to save room for some dessert as their homemade Cinnamon Rolls are to die for."}
{"text":"Longtime favorite. Solid food, great sammys, and amazing staff. 
The kitchen crew is young and hip, and they know how to stack a sammich. Everything is fresh, and the made to order option is the way to go. But, if you want something warm and comforting, go for KC's Mac and Cheese. It's fall down and thank your mama good."}
{"text":"Very interesting musical decor. 
Macado sandwich was very good. 
All downhill from here. 
Table was super sticky asked 2 times to get it wiped off, but no action on that front. 
Potato salad was a big portion, but mostly a tasteless mush with gigantic, hard potato chunks. 
Floor of men's room was coated in a slick substance that stayed with me the rest I the day--be careful in there and afterwards. 
Macado's should divest themselves for this location immediately. The ones in Boone, Roanoke, Salem and Harrisonburg are great--go to one of those."}
{"text":"We are fans of Macado's. Great selection of sandwiches and pastas. The awesome decor and names of the sandwiches are always fun. Personally, I love the Titanic which is a HUGE steak sandwich, also I like the Julius Ceasar, a great tasting chicken parm. I would also recommend the wings, boneless or bone in.  This is a fun place to eat, visit with friends and have a few drinks."}
{"text":"Macado's is a solid choice for a meal in the University area.  The ambiance is sports/pub-ish.  Dark wood covers the bar and tables with flat screen TV's scattered throughout the restaurant.  We went during a down-time at about 2:00.  Our server was friendly, and our food was delivered correctly and relatively fast.  As a vegetarian, I will say that they menu is not very friendly.  I really had to look for veggie options.  I selected the portabello quesadilla and it was terrific.  I was skeptical about broccoli being in my quesadilla but I took a chance and really liked it.  I also had a side of coleslaw which was a bit unusual.  It almost has a mesquite flavor to it.  It wasn't bad but I am a more traditional fan.  Friday's they also offer half price glasses of house wine.  I fully took advantage of some pretty decent cab.  

Overall, this is a casual, good, decently priced place.  Oh, and UNCC athletes get a discount!"}
{"text":"Food is VERY nominal. I've eaten at other Macado's (Boone and Concord Mills) previously and this one is by far the worst. It has a regular influx of UNCC students and good drink specials which keeps it afloat but other than that isn't much to write home about. I would steer clear as there are numerous better options nearby."}
{"text":"I came here to celebrate with a friend after my last presentation for a class. This restaurant is pretty neat, however past experiences here has made me feel iffy here.

This time around, it wasn't so bad. I ordered the titanic with the French dip to dunk it in. Last time it took forever for the food to come out, but this time it was around 10 min. 

The food was pretty fresh, and they have a lot of choices in sandwiches. Take your time and read all the combinations. This restaurant is also neatly located right near campus, and their drinks aren't too bad. Depending on what you're trying to drink and what is for the special this place isn't bad.

I had two coronas (2.95 on Wednesdays) so yeah, not bad."}
{"text":"Good food. And they are open late - a pregnant woman appreciates this for late night snacks ;)
Our server, Sean, was attentive and my experience has been great so far - dine-in once and takeout in two days."}
{"text":"This has got to be the worst restaurant in Charlotte.  I go there with some co-workers during our lunch break.  Not only was the service absolutely awful, the food was just as bad if not worse.  My soup was cold....we waited 35 minutes for our check, and I wanted to track down a manager just so we can pay and get back to work...so, no manager was to be found, nor did one even come out when I requested to see one.  Unfortunate because the place does have a decent atmosphere going and a great location.   I will usually give a bad restaurant a second chance, but not this one."}
{"text":"Great place to go for a late night eat out. First time I went there, fell in love with their sandwich because of the great texture of the bread. They also have plenty of varieties to choose. Sadly, the second time I went there, I ordered a different sandwich and it wasn't so good. I ended up eating only half so I say it might be a hit and miss. It's a bit over price just for a late night eat out so I don't go there often. We'll see if the third time's a charm."}
{"text":"We decided to take the kids out for a quick bite to eat and kids eat free at Macado's on Tuesdays.  2 free kids meals with the purchase of 1 adult entree to be exact.  So, with 3 kids to feed that's a great deal!  We were seated right away because there were only about 3 other tables in the entire place.  You would think that would mean we would have quick service (I saw 3 waitresses including ours)...wrong.  It took quite awhile for the waitress to even come to our table. Then took awhile to get our drinks and an excessive amount of time to get our food.  However, the kids meal choices are great.  There are tons of items for them to choose from which is rare on a kids menu.  The regular menu is a bit daunting for me.  I tend to order 1 of about 4 items that I've always gotten.  It would just take too long to read that entire thing!  

Once the food finally arrived it was hot and good.  No complaints there, and as anyone with kids knows it is next to impossible to have 3 kids that are not complaining about something!  The kids mac n'cheese is baked and delicious!  My husband and I got nachos and a club sandwich to split.  We feed a family of 5 with tip for $24.00, unbelievable!  Our food bill was $17.89.

If I had no kids and wasn't looking for a decent place to do the kids eat free thing however we probably would never eat here.  The atmosphere is weird and quiet.  They do have beer and wine specials nightly as well as food specials.  $5.85 Burgers all day on Tuesday for dine in.  

Well be back again...on a Tuesday of course!"}
{"text":"Awesome sandwiches. I have had the club, the titanic with au ju and the wings . Definetly recommend this place !"}
{"text":"i like stopping in here for a schooner or two...or three...it's near my house and they always seem to be open even though they are located in the mall......i am also obsessed with the kc fried chicken mac and cheese! believe me, it is nothing gourmet, but it is just good comfort food. people often bypass thismenu item because they are known for their sandwiches."}
{"text":"First things first, they have the BEST homemade lemonade ever! Not only was that good but the food itself was great, our server was also very attentive and helpful. I will definitely be back, I wish I would of found this place sooner!"}
{"text":"Terrible, Simply,,,,,,TERRIBLE.

Tuesday night, 10 people 45 min + for burger, cold fries, had to ask for everything, refills etc.   Service could not be worse,,server friends with a very loud/LOUD table of guys, would sit with them while we waited for drinks/refill/food,,,not one did a manager come (was one on duty?) by and ask how things were,,,wife would not let me say anything,,sent complaint on web site, to their credit did call me,,,come back we'll do better,,,don't think so...stay away,,,,,,PERIOD!"}
{"text":"Overpriced, smelly building, service is spotty at best. Used to frequent the one in concord and once it closed we gave this location MULTIPLE tries, but we're over it."}
{"text":"Food is just okay. Service was terrible. We had a party of 8, but in a nearly empty restaurant for lunch. Air-conditioning was broken. Bathroom smelly. Lots of better options in this area."}
{"text":"We have been going here and my main complaint is that they take forever to bring out your food. When we go is for burger day on Tuesday and go after 4 so our daughter eats free. Also the portion on the fries always but always vary. It's either very little or a lot.
We will stop going here. The last visit was very disappointing we always order waters and this time was not an exception food took long like always. After finishing our meal and asking for the check realized they charged us for our daughters meal. When asking the waitress she said their was a minimum of 7 a person in order for my daughter to eat free. New rule? Well she just starred at us and wouldn't budge. Really? We just paid and left. But won't be going back. A heads up on the NEW RULE would have helped."}
{"text":"The sandwhich I got was amazing but the service was the worst I have ever experienced in my life. I got one refill in a 2 hour period. We had to wait 45 minutes for the check. If you come here, you better get it to go"}
{"text":"Thursday nights after 9pm are BOGO quesadillas and they are goooooood. Mouth watering thinking about it. Did I mention that you can also reach a pokestop if you sit in the corner towards 49 and wt Harris? Lol"}
{"text":"I ordered a chicken teriyaki taco (with fries) to go, so I can't comment on the actual dining in experience. 

The food was fantastic. The tacos were soft, so they went great with the crispy chicken. I loved the fries, as they were fully cooked. Crispy on the outside, soft in the middle! The place wasn't especially busy on the Sunday night that I went. To her credit, the bartender was very attentive and answered all questions.

Macado's has a large number of sandwiches, tacos, and wraps.  I need to try them all! You should too."}
{"text":"We tried this place with our nephew and the 3 hungry boys love it.  The wife love her turkey Reuben.  The service was very good and the atmosphere was nice."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great pricing and yummy food and desserts. They have a ton of options so you are guaranteed to find something you like. They're open late too so if other places are closing it's a great place to get a late night meal."}
{"text":"They often miss and don't have fantastic service, but as long as you don't have higher expectations than typical college campus bar food, you're good to go. 

A lot of variety and uniqueness. Check. Lame sides and fries. Check. Servers that only pay half attention. Check.

Get in. Get a beer and sandwich. Get out in okay time."}
{"text":"Extremely dirty bathrooms!  My cousin and I came here for lunch during Christmas.  The food was ok ( I had a BLT, my cousin had the burger).   I have no problem with the food but what I do have a problem with is the bathrooms.  My cousin went first and came back and said, \"that is the nastiest bathroom I've ever seen!\"   I joked\"well I probably won't be able to smell it because of I'm so congested.\"   Even with my cold I could smell how nasty it was in there!  Please clean your bathrooms.  I won't go back until you do!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch shortly after this new location opened because friends wanted to try it.  Macado's is one of those places you'd imagine existing as an \"American\" restaurant in a foreign country.  Its walls are tiled with every bit of stereotypical kitsch imaginable from rock and roll to sports to fake antique carousel horses.  There are big TVs everywhere -- like, two 4' TVs literally right next to each other on the wall showing the exact same thing (maybe so you can cross your eyes and get 3D?).  The food is what you'd expect from a place like that -- mainly enormous, messy, meat sandwiches.  They're OK but nothing that's going to make you say \"OMG I have to hit up Macado's and get that amazing totally unique giant meat sandwich again\".  If you want competently prepared, bland, non-adventurous food, in an environment that makes you feel like it's 1984 again and you're on top of the world, this may just be your place."}
{"text":"We heard this place is great and I was pretty excited to try it out. The menu seemed pretty extensive and many options to choose from. We took our baby with us and I was disappointed and appalled to find there was no changing table in either of the restrooms. Although it may not be everyone's go-to family restaurant, I am amazed how a business this popular would not accommodate parents and families. The food was average or even could have been above average but the experience was not awesome--we saw our server when we placed the order and then when he came around to hand us the check-- that's it! We did not feel very welcome, we would probably have had more interaction with our server at a fast food restaurant. Not impressed with the customer service  and to top it all the experience was ruined when i had to change my baby in his car seat/stroller. Not cool Macado's, not cool."}
{"text":"We had sesame ginger, baby rays honey bbq, and kickin bourbon wings. They were very good. The fried pickles spears were good, and so were bacon and cheese potato skins. The pizza was not bad either my 6 year old enjoyed it. The gourmet mushroom burger with a portabello mushroom, lettuce, tomato, and swiss cheese was cooked to perfection and the hamburger bun was hot and toasted just right. The ruben was just ok. The vanilla milkshake was really good. Our waitress Ella B. was awesome!"}
{"text":"About 6 months ago I came here with coworkers who have always liked Macado's (The location in Salem, Virginia). That initial visit wasn't terrible except when I went to the bathroom. I was so sickened I vowed to never come back. Well today, coworkers convinced me to return with them and I am saddened I did. The experience could of only been better if i had not come at all. The table was so dirty everyone had to avoid touching it, nothing happened after telling the waiter and them saying they would take care of it. After getting our food and eating for 6 minutes I reminded them about the table and told them don't waste their time. We are already eating. He seemed to be very pleased that he wouldn't have to do anything about it. My drink was taken from the table and did not return for  a long period of time. I didn't have but, one napkin that was designed for under a drink. The chicken in my \"KC's Mac and Cheese\" felt like it was 3 day old left overs reheated twice over. The only redeeming feature was the garlic bread which probably only tasted good because it was frozen and not prepared by the staff here other than reheating."}
{"text":"My friends brought me to the Boone, NC location a few years ago and then this location opened! We were excited! You can't go wrong with this joint. Great sandwiches, great beers, and great desserts. Our waitress last night was fantastic. They have great daily specials too! The only thing we were not too thrilled about was the tortilla chips that came out with our queso. They tasted old. Other then that we had a fantastic meal!"}
{"text":"KC fried chicken is the best! Located inside Concord Mills Mall. Great for a cold one while you're shopping. Massive sandwich menu and good service."}
{"text":"We went to order and they continued to tell us either everything was an up-charge or it was something they were out of. Than we waited 30 minutes for our food, our waitress barely came to our table and when she did was so concerned about her friends at the other table didn't bother to check on us.. had to ask two other people for things such as silverware and ketchup. When we did get our foot it was so greasy I could barely even eat the potato chips that cost extra. Definitely will think twice before returning here."}
{"text":"I really like their club sandwich and their mug margaritas, but had to give 4 stars because the service is consistently slow and the waiter/waitress takes forever to come back and take orders/refill drinks. Usually that kind of thing doesn't bother me, but it happens every. Single. Time. 

Other than that, the food is great!"}
{"text":"I like the food, but every time I've gone (about 7 or 8 times) I've had absolutely horrible service. We even walked out once after 15 minutes of not even being brought drinks. Finally learned my lesson. It isn't just 1 waiter or 1 cook. The whole place moves at a snail's pace."}
{"text":"Solid 4 in my book.  The menu is ginormous as was my beer.  I happened to go there on a night were the 32oz beers were on special.  They basically take a HUGE margarita glass and fill it with beer.  High visual impact, plus the beer you normally drink seems daunting when it comes out.

I decided on a burger and was pleasantly surprised when it didn't fall apart on me halfway through due to greasiness.  The food did take a while to come out - mostly my fault since I was the only one that ordered something hot... everyone else's sandwiches were cold.

Overall, the server and the whole experience was a good one.  I'll be back to tackle another margarita glass of beer someday!"}
{"text":"The restaurant has interesting decor tjhat seems to be all over the place.  I'm not sure if there is an actual theme to it.  In the main dining area there is a large synthetic tree.  On the walls there are animal heads, some of which might be real.  

In the bar area, everything is wood from the floor to the walls to the booths.  The walls are covered with sports memorabilia and old product logos.  Weird combination if you ask me.

The menu is huge and contains sandwiches in every shape and form with names of famous people and characters.  There are too many choices on the menu that make your decision difficult.

The food is actually decent here and the prices are very reasonable.  I had a turkey sandwich, chips and  pickle with french onion soup and iced tea all for under $10.  The soup was served in a coffee mug with an extra large slice of cheese-smothered baguette dunked in which made it hard to eat.

Service was ok.  I was seated in the bar and the bartender seemed to be focusing more on the 1 customer at the bar than me but at least she was friendly and polite.

But this place probably makes a killing on weekends when the mall is packed since it is only one of two sit down restaurants in the mall."}
{"text":"This place is great, love the food, prices are reasonable. Huge menu with lots of options."}
{"text":"6/28/10
On our last day in Charlotte, we went to see the \"Karate Kid\" remake and then have lunch at Macado's.  Since I've never been, I decided I'd get whatever the soup of the day was, as well as one of their daily sandwich specials.  My sister has eaten here a few times and was craving for one of their quesadillas.

Mom and I love French onion soup, and when we found out that this was the soup of the day, we had to try it!  While its presentation was a bit strange, its flavor was very good!  We loved the texture of the cheese, but did wish more of it was \"crunchified.\"  I really appreciated how the soup WASN'T too salty.  

I chose the Ragtime sandwich from a choice of three, I believe (bear with me, it's been a couple of months).  The sandwich consisted of grilled rye bread filled w/ generous slices of rare roast beef, crispy bacon, melty Swiss cheese, and Macado's famous spicy sauce (chipotle-based).  I would order this again!!  It came w/ crinkle-cut fries that were cooked to crispy perfection!  I passed on the ketchup, and used Macado's spicy sauce, instead.  Great combo- if only I could order this at work!

My sister's black bean quesadilla looked so good (even though it looked a bit \"deflated\" IMO, but I couldn't try it for myself due to the addition of corn and black bean (LOL).  Everyone who tried it said it was delicious!

I could do w/out the decor- too cluttered.  Service was friendly enough."}
{"text":"I've been to Macados multiple times and have loved pretty much everything I've gotten. They have weekly specials so make sure to pay attention to those on the days you go! It can be quite the hang out for UNCC college kids, but it's also family style so anyone fits. My favorite thing on the menu is probably the 49er burger, with the avocado it makes for a tasty treat, normally I pair that with their house made chips which are to die for. Most of my friends op for the black bean dip, and the quesadillas are great! Like I said the menu and food is amazing!!! The only down side to Macados is the TERRIBLE service. Waiters come take your order and then you never see them again. They don't fill up your drinks, and they really are not very attentive to their customers. I feel like I can personally say that their service is so horrid because I worked in the food industry as a server, and I've been on the consumer side. It's not fun getting a bad tip but it's also not fun dying of thirst. I would gladly give this place 5 stars if the service was up to par!!"}
{"text":"I'd never dream of going to Macado's for the food. This place is was The Spot for me and my AMC friends in high school, so of course, it's the first place we go when we reunite (or rather, we wander around the mall, pretending to think about where we want to eat, when one of us will say, \"Hey, how 'bout Macado's?\" And the rest of us will go, \"Why, that's a great idea!\")

For me, Macado's is all about dessert, namely the brownie pie, with vanilla ice cream (though, yes, I am lactose intolerant, but you gotta live sometime!) Pretty standard brownie with ice cream and chocolate sauce, but as with many foods, the secret ingredient is love: A crew of friends spooning off the same clump of ice cream after a long shift at the cinema, or a group of hardworking grads revisiting old familiars. 

Macado's, I heart you. And Talbie, the cute bartender I've crushed on since high school. ;)"}
{"text":"This place is the define of fine. It's not bad but definitely not great. The food tastes like the booths looked, tired and lackluster. Our server was attentive so that really boosted the experience. I got the Crazy Chris which is basically a buffalo chicken wrap. Again it was fine. Not the best buffalo chicken but not the worst. I asked for a side of ranch which I was told costed extra, that's fine. Without the extra ranch the wrap would have been bland at best. I also got the wrap with a side of chips. What I was expecting was some homemade chips but what i got was a bag of ruffles. If you're going to just use store bought chips at least put them on the plate and pretend you made them. I probably won't make an effort to come back to Macado's but if i find myself there for another business meeting I'll be just fine."}
{"text":"Macado's is neither the best sandwich spot nor the worst. It's a convenient choice for anyone perusing the Concord Mills Mall and offers a pretty solid lunch in that $8-10 price point.

 It was empty for an early Wednesday afternoon lunch - we had a larger party of 7. They were very nice about letting me make substitutions to the already endless menu options.  For example, I had no problem subbing grilled chicken for fried and adding roasted red peppers. I was a little confused with the menu as their specialty seemed to be sandwiches but they also touted their  Italian entrees and Mexican appetizers. If anything this menu reminded me of a bar. 

My sandwich  tasted good though their lunch meats were not freshly sliced deli-quality. The bread however was excellent, I highly recommend the ciabatta.I ordered the fruit on the side (in lieu of chips), but the fruit tasted acidic so I think it was jarred in liquid. I'd stick with chips next time. Fries are not a side option, but you can order an entire basket- which someone in our group did though they were delivered later than our sandwiches. 

My only other slight complaint is the time it took to get our sandwiches, which was a considerable wait though we were the only people in the place..and we all ordered sandwiches. 

All in all it was just A-ok."}
{"text":"Cool place, good music and great sandwiches at reasonable prices.  Was a regular at the one in Boone and while this one seems a little, um, fake I guess it's still okay.  The Ricochet Rabbit is one of my favorite sandwiches."}
{"text":"This place is awesome, service staff is great, food is not good, it's excellent. I eat here all the time, kids night on Tuesday, wing night on Monday and Sunday, Thursday is buy 1

{"text":"Just an okay place, with okay service and okay drinks. I went late night (which is nice to find a place open at 11 and up for those of us who work in hospitality and like to have a drink after. First, our water came with out the lemons. The server said \"oh oops I forgot your lemons, oh well\" and never brought us any... we went for the margs because they sounded good. Flavor options and everything. We should have known by the $3 and something that they cost, they would be no good. So much flavor mix it was really sweet. And the salt rim tasted like table salt and just did not go well with the over sweet drink. We then moved on to another drink. I got a beer(can't go wrong) my friend got the salted caramel martini which had us drooling just reading it. It comes out with half a martinis glass's worth and again, table salt rim. I watched the bartender pour, and idk how their drinks are suppose to be made, but it was majority of butterscotch schnapps and light on the vodka. Again, making the drink entirely too sweet. Which obviously there should be some sweetness but this was over kill. Anywho, my friends built her own wrap and said it was okay. Like I said. Just an okay place. The location is perfect though (uncc) because I feel like college kids on a budget, that would eat anything, would like it here."}
{"text":"I didn't really enjoy Macado's due to their lack of vegetarian and/or lighter options, but to be fair, they don't advertise themselves as vegetarian-friendly or a light bites restaurant. Pretty much everything is fried or buttered to the max. The food is pretty tasty, but I felt immensely sick afterward.

Service was good, and the menu is very extensive yet it isn't comprehensive. As mentioned, vegetarian options were nearly impossible to identify despite 100+ menu options. They had plethora of meat-filled sandwiches, as well as some odd offerings like lasagna and tacos.

Good food, but I won't be back because I would like to preserve my arteries and waistline."}
{"text":"Mehhh. Mediocre. You could probably go to your local wal mart and get all your ingredients and it would taste the same. Nothing special but worth going in for a casual date. Bar at night is expensive though...spent 20 bucks on 3 shots one night thy weren't even that strong. Service is bad if you are a young teen, okay if you're college aged, and mediocre if you are older."}
{"text":"I was turned on to Macado's by the one in my college town, and that one (Boone, NC) is better than this one.  I think this location (Concord Mills) may be bigger, but the service is not better.  I seem to have service issues (slow!) nearly every time I come here but the food is good, so...  It's a good place to stop for a meal before seeing a movie.  If you're trying to make a specific movie time, though, don't stop in here expecting a quick in-and-out."}
{"text":"Your typical American fare, with some other unique options. Good place to come to for sports entertainment. Plenty of TVs. Their draft beer selection is modest, but they have some solid seasonal options. Come here on Tuesday nights and it's half off Hindenburgs (think club sandwich on steroids). Thursday nights is 2 for 1 appetizers. Lots of locals come here (mainly UNC Charlotte students). Not the type of place you want to come to if you're looking for a quiet dinner and drinks; especially during sports events."}
{"text":"I called in an order tonight and came to pick it up and the bartender proceeded to tell me that she had accidentally given my togo order to someone else (which is fine I get it, things happen). She told me they were going to remake my order and that it would take about 10 minutes. About 2 minutes went by and she comes back and says actually the man who took your order is on the way back. I asked her if they were still remaking my order and she said no why. I told her, don't you think it's a little strange to give me food that had been taken out of this restaurant? She then proceeds to roll her eyes at me, say whatever, and throw the check down in front of my face. She brings out my remade order and snarks, \"there all perfect now, nothing to complain about.\" I have never experienced such disrespect and unprofessionalism in an establishment. I have eaten here plenty of times and have had no issues but it does not look like I will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Came here to order takeout for my family on Saturday and it was delicious indeed. We ordered: 2 pastrami ruben, one with coleslaw the other with fries, a turkey ruben with coleslaw, an oriental chicken wrap with coleslaw, a rabbit (chicken salad) wrap with potato salad, a kids chicken fingers plate and a cinnamon roll. The order was ready in 30 minutes as promised but when I got there the hostess was a bit disheveled and overwhelmed with seating, cookie baking, communicating to the other hostess and handling takeout orders. Maybe I just came in at the wrong time but it may be beneficial to reroute the takeout orders or have a dedicated takeout person to avoid any service breaks. She started to help me twice and had to stop to complete the aforementioned task. Unfortunately, it wasn't the speedy takeout experience of other eateries. 

The food was really good though. The Rubens were good overall but they were a bit chintzy on the meat, kraut and dressing and the bread was overly toasted (but not burnt). The wraps were both chocked full of all of the toppings and meat and were fresh and served on a slightly grilled tortilla. These were shining stars indeed. The kids meal was also a bit chintzy but honestly it's a kids plate. All the sides were homemade and super fresh. 

Let me tell you about this cinnamon bun...OMG IT WAS FABULOUS!! So fresh and pillowy with the right balance of sweet and cinnamony flavor. I literally wanted to drive back to get 20 more!!! Absolutely fabulous!!"}
{"text":"Not good :/ found a hair in my food and waitress did nothing about it (left it sitting on the table actually...gross). Lots to choose from on the menu though! Unfortunately I most likely won't go back."}
{"text":"We stopped for a late lunch. It was fine and seemed a good place to watch a ball game. The menu had a good selection but we just had hamburgers."}
{"text":"We went in because we noticed it wasn't very busy and we wanted to grab a quick bite to eat.  The waitress acknowledged us, brought us 2 out of the 3 drinks we ordered and then she never came back to our table.  After 15 mins we got up and left.  I would leave a 1 star but I reserve that for blatantly rude or disgusting places."}
{"text":"This was my first time visiting Macado's. It took a minute for me to decide what i wanted because there were so many great choices but we had an awesome waiter who was very patient. When the food arrived it was delicious and very filling. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Good bar staff, lots of options for sandwiches and beverages. Good eats at a good price."}
{"text":"Very nice low key family and college kids place. Pretty good food, too. Solid 4.5 stars"}
{"text":"Surprised by all the low ratings....hmm.  This place is one of my favorites when I'm near the mall and hungry.  I've never had a bad sandwich here.  The menu selection is so vast it's almost annoying.  I can never decide what to order and then always wish I had tried something else.....although most everything I've eaten here is good.  The potato salad is awesome, pretzels and cheese awesome.  Do yourself a favor and get a booth in the bar area....the wait staff here come around more often and have more personality (not the younger wait staff who stand up front and talk all shift with the hostesses).

By the way, this place is pronounced \"Mack-uh-dewz\" not \"Muh-kah-doze\".....took a year to figure that one out.  LOL"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic on atmosphere alone.  It's a great place to sit back relax and hang out.  The bartenders are great!  I've been coming here for ten years between breaks at the mall, pre gaming, or even a bite to eat.  It's a good change of pace from your run of the mill frat boy hang out in university.  I highly recommend the Tom and Jerry.  Also great drink specials."}
{"text":"Here on 4/21/12

Just came in here to get a salad and soup. The place is loud , but not overtly so, and has  a lot of colorful, odd, decor.  If you bring kids ask to sit near the tree. It is. Manmade tree with all kinds of cool things and animals hanging from it.

My salad was good, but lacked color. Lots of lettuce and 1 tiny grape tomato and 1 cucumber slice.  I was disappointed. However, the balsamic vinigrette was very.good. as for the soup, I had the broccoli/cheese which was tasty.  I really wanted to know what the 'soup of the day' was, as it was stated on the menu, but apparently they only had the broccoli and cheese and french onion. No.daily soup specials.

Overall satisfied withthis dining experience."}
{"text":"I've been at Macado's in Blacksburg, Christiansburg, Radford and Lynchburg and this is by far the bottom of the rankings in my opinion.  Not that the food was bad I would say Macado's is more about the envirnoment than the food but this one seemed to lack something that the others have. 

Blacksburg is the best!"}
{"text":"Best Ruben in Charlotte! Best value in the mall! We love this place and Tuesday is kids eat free! Great place!"}
{"text":"I had a fantastic experience at mac-a-doo's (would never have pronounced it that way!)! It was Thursday, so we ordered the spinach dip which was 1/2 off. It is served with tortilla chips, and was pretty yummy! After debating the large menu (I wanted pretty much everything they had), I ordered the Big Daddy. It exceeded expectations! I could only finish half of it, so I have leftovers for today. Our waiter was super nice and helpful. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Order the Mona Lisa. Interesting names of their dishes, but just okay flavorwide. Service okay, environment good."}
{"text":"Love the bartender Jeana, she makes the most awesome Margarita and always serves us with a smile.   A++++++"}

The service was also great. I will be visiting a lot more often."}
{"text":"First off the hostess didn't inform our server we were sat. So it took 15 minutes just to get a drink. Then our order came out wrong. The waitress was polite about it and offered to have it recooked. I tool my toddler to the bathroom to find a health hazard. There was some substance that I shutter to think of it's origin smeared over all but one toilet seat. I will never come back, and I pity the poor waitress that had to witness it all."}
{"text":"Good sandwich variety and appetizers at decent prices.
Nothing bad or great to say about it. similar to an Applebee's but with sandwiches."}
{"text":"I went to Macado's on a Monday for their 39 cent wing special. I had the spicy Thai wings and they were very good. I was seated towards the back of the restaurant where I couldn't really see people or the front door, which was kind of awkward because it was pretty empty in there. My server was nice, but he did get missing for long periods of time, possibly because I was sitting so far away from everyone else. The only catch was that ranch & blue cheese was 75 cents apiece. I don't mind paying extra for ranch, but it's kind of ridiculous that it cost twice as much as the wings, but it's not that big of a deal. Overall, I enjoyed my experience at Macado's."}
{"text":"Ten dollars for a handful of pasta, three pieces of broccoli and flavorless Alfredo... Not good.. I've had better from this same place.. What a shame. Also asked for my broccoli well done (so it's softer) and I can barely put my fork through these things. The fork that I had to go back inside for because that was forgotten in my bag as well.."}
{"text":"First impression: The entire floor was sticky and the whole place smelled of stale beer. That yeasty smell. I overlooked that and sat at the bar and ordered two types of wings. The wings were dried out and had very little sauce. Bottom line: I paid $38 for a meal that I could have bought at a 7-11."}
{"text":"The good - The fried pickles weren't bad, and we're not there anymore. 

The bad - Everything else.  Burger was not good.  Toppings tasted like they were burnt and burger patty tasted like it had just come out the the freezer.  Chicken wings tasted like the frozen kind that you buy at the grocery store.  Maybe we just ordered the wrong things?

The service was horrendous.  It took way too long for a server to show up at our table, and once he did, he was very unenthusiastic about his job.  Took a long time to get our drinks.  He came and asked several times what I was drinking to give me a refill(I was drinking unsweet tea) and 10 minutes or so later, he brings sweet tea.  Not a big deal, but his lackluster attitude left us less than impressed.  The place was nearly empty, so there's no excuse there.  

I don't recommend this place and will never go back."}
