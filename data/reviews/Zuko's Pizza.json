{"text":"Great pizza and wings.  The texture of their crust is amazing.  It's at the same time crispy and has just the right amount of chew.  Their wings are also great and I love how they let you choose how crispy you want them (the menu even encourages you to do so).  You have to try the Sicilian pizza as well.  I've ordered from here a few times and the food is always delivered at the time quoted, and sometimes even sooner."}
{"text":"I've stopped at this place a few times for lunch, their much quicker than Anthony Junior's across the street which is of course the flagship pizza place in Coraopolis. I went on one occasion I ordered the Buffalo chicken hoagie, and I have to tell you it was really good for what it was it was delicious. Maybe try it with grilled onions, maybe not, that could confuse them, and that could be bad,  On another Occasion, for lunch our crew got pizzas from Zukos  and Anthony Junior's across the street and to tell you the truth it was a tie, and by our crew , I mean both of us me and the voices in my head, which I call thoughts.If you're in Coraopolis Zukos  is quick delicious and affordable, also, please take time to check the Pok√©mon stops near there, and as always, Hail Satan! Or try their plain  cheese,  that's really the way to judge your pizza. If there plain cheese can't stack up there out of the running baby."}
{"text":"We were excited to try a new pizza place rather than the old stand by's.  The person on the phone and service were all great.  The pizza was cold and it was greasy.  I really have not seen greasy pizza in a long time.  I do hope whatever may have been the issue is addressed because the reviews were really positive."}
{"text":"I love how family oriented this place is. We order from here once a week at least and they get better and better every time we do. Would recommend to anyone. The prices are awesome, as are their special deals!"}
{"text":"Was in town and decided to stop at Zuko's. The employees were very friendly and personable. I order a pizza and it was delicious, which was similar to a New York style pizza. I also ordered a chicken salad and was arguably one of the best salad's I've had in my life. If you're in town, I would definitely recommend stopping here for a meal."}
{"text":"First order tonight. Got my standard first order, 4 slices of Sicilian. I had them top it with sausage, tomato, and green peppers. I picked it up, it was ready on time and staff was friendly. The pizza was very colorful, fresh, and was pretty, lol, no kidding. It was also delicious. I'll be ordering again soon."}
{"text":"I just moved to Cory and you should definitely check this place out! The daily deals are awesome, as is the food. Not too many places can get a good buffalo chicken hoagie with the right balance of sauce, chicken, other toppings, but you guys nailed it. I'll be back and as a big guy trying to save money in college (but not trying eat ramen every night) I love it!  Definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Great local pizza joint, tried both their plain cheese and white pizza which were both very good. They have a great crust with an original taste, not just another generic local pizza chain. They were just a little light on the sauce for my liking. Overall really enjoyed the pizza, will definitely be back."}
