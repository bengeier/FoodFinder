{"text":"I love this place, I go all the time, but the guy working there who is there all the time, dark hair, short, not friendly (if you go there a lot you'll know who I'm talking about), is so rude, he messed up my order a few times, he used his hands to spread the chicken onto my sandwich, prepares the food using his fingers and handles money.. Not sanitary at all. He's so unpleasant to deal with and when I go there I will definitely be asking for a different person. It's such a shame because I love the food but he really ruins the experience."}
{"text":"This place has a great variety of snacks... I am a cheese lover and I go there to get a piece heaven!"}
{"text":"I have been going to La Foumagerie for 25 years.  Last week we went for lunch and my daughter ordered the Pizza Baguette.  It was not was she expected.  Layers of salty salami under a piece of melted cheese. Not tomato sauce.  It was an open faced hot spicy salami sandwich.  There was nothing pizza about it. And it was burnt.  After one bite we tried to return it.  They would not take it back and would not refund it.  \"If we don't like it, that is our problem!\" said Melanie the manager.  What??????"}
{"text":"One of my fave lunch places. Great sandwiches. I recommend the Mexican: endive, avocado, black olives, Gouda, and more good stuff in a baguette.  They also have a great cheese selection."}
{"text":"Nice sandwiches at comparable prices to the nearby chain sandwiched shops but with much better ingredients. Spacious seating in and outside."}
{"text":"First of all, a cheese shop that also makes sandwiches and yet doesn't feature any simple cheese sandwich on the menu is quite puzzling.  But what's even weirder is that that they refused to warm up my cheddar sandwich and instead served me two chunks of stale bread with paper thin cold cheese in the middle."}
{"text":"Husband and I are staying in Montreal and trying to find a bakery or shop that has delicious baguette sandwiches. The level of deliciousness similar to that in France. Day 3, no luck. I found this place by reading yelp reviews and decided to give this place a go. Especially since they have lots and lots of cheeses! Cannot go wrong with that.  I ordered a soup (not too crazy about it) and a custom sandwich with salmon, avocado, tomato, lettuce and their dressing of olive oil & lemon. That's what I was looking for! It was perfectly crunchy and had a good balance of flavors and textures inside! Score! Hubby ordered their main sandwich special, something Parmesan prosciutto. It was also quite tasty, however, a bit intense. I think you need to have an acquired taste for something this salty, or have more lettuce or something bland to balance it out more. Overall a pleasant experience, staff very friendly and knowledgeable."}
{"text":"Warning: I'm going to use the word \"cheese\" and derivatives thereof many many many many times in the course of this review. Cheese is like the best thing ever, right? Like pretty much the most wonderful invention human civilisation has ever wrought on this earth. Cheese! Mmm unless you're vegan or lactose intolerant (oh dear God ! I'm so sorry but a life without cheese just isn't a life worth living) you know what I mean when I exclaim my love of cheese. How couldn't you love cheese ... it's just so, hmm what the word, ah yes ... it's just so cheesy! Foumagerie is verily a cheesy oasis of cheese; it has one of the cheesiest, best and most diverse cheese and complete cheesy selection of cheeses in this cheese city. They also have some of the most knowledgeable cheese staff vis-à-vis all things cheese! From various world renowned French cheeses like Roquefort and Brillat-Savarin Triple Crème to obscure but sumptuous local Québec cheeses like Ciel de Charlevoix. They've got Dutch cheeses like smoked Gouda, Maaslander, Limburger and Mimolette. There is an American blue cheese called Grey Owl that is incredible. You can find Swiss cheeses such as Gruyère, Appenzeller and Bündner Bergkäse. There are various Greek Fetas, English and Irish and Canadian Cheddars, beautiful blues, fresh Mozzarella di Bufala Campana, baby Bocconcinis and so much more. There is a cheese here for every taste.  They've got beautiful and pungent slap-in-the-face super super stinky cheeses, less stinky super stinky cheese, excellent mi-fort, mild and subtle yet rich cheeses, cheeses with herbs, cheeses with ash, cheeses with spices, cheeses in wine, port Cheddar, cheeses with truffles and sometimes they've even got cheeses with flowers in them. Seriously, if you've got a hankering for some scrumptious cheese for a sandwich, or you need some good Parmigiano Reggiano for making that spaghetti or pesto for supper or perhaps you're putting on an elegant wine and cheese for the entire neighbourhood; whatever your cheese need, they've got your cheese solution -- I implore you to come here and seek the sage advise of the cheese masters at Foumagerie. Enjoy and have a cheesy day! Cheese!!"}
{"text":"A great little neighbourhood gem if you are in the area.  It's a sandwich place, but also a cheese and fine groceries shop.  Their sandwiches are excellent, the bread is super fresh and all their ingredients top quality.  The smoking goat is my favorite.  Lots of choices, something for everyone here.  Soups and salads are just ok, I'd stick with the sandwiches.  They have a nice selection of cheeses, cold cuts and condiments, salts, etc as well.  The inside is a little crowded with limited seating; in the summer there is more seating outside.  Service is friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"Cheese?   Yes please! This adorable little basement shop in Westmount is so worth a visit. It is much larger than it appears from the street and is really lovely inside. Go at lunch and grab a sandwich - the Smoking Goat (smoked salmon, goat cheese and capers) and The Mexican (gouda with cumin, avocado and black olives) are absolutely wonderful. Lovely staff, amazing selection of cheeses, prices aren't terrible. Can't wait for my next sandwich there!"}
{"text":"Honestly, I am a sucker for any place that serves more than one variety of cream of [vegetable/legume] a day, but the fact of the matter is that Foumagerie just has good food in general. Besides the tasty soups, you'll find a wide variety of sandwiches built around a variety of cheeses, from Parmesan to Stilton. The cheese is fantastic, the cold cuts are high-quality and the bread is always fresh from their bakery.  The place is super small, so on days when it's too cold and wet for them to open up the terrace, you might have a hard time getting a seat, but the turnover's pretty good and you can easily take your meal to go.  An extra recommendation goes specifically to the Carpaccio sandwich on baguette: roast beef, lemon juice, black pepper, olive oil and a generous helping of parmesan cheese make it less of a sandwich and more of an experience. Awesome."}
{"text":"One of my favourite places to have lunch or pick up. The staff are very helpful and after time recognize you by saying prosciutto with provolone??   favourite sandwich: baguette, prosciutto, provolone, balsamic, olive oil, lemon, salt and pepper  Favourite wrap: turkey, goat cheese, lettuce, tomato with the house salad dressing  Favourite salad: foumagerie salad with a twist, romaine, turkey, cheese, cucumbers, tomatoes and capers with the house salad dressing  Soups are all amazing depends on what you like, luckily they always have at least 3-4 options."}
{"text":"I haven't left a review? SORRY I WAS TOO BUSY ENJOYING MY SANDWICHES.   Seriously though this place is a savior to me. The availability of made-to-order sandwiches is a godsend in my life, and the Foumagerie team are kinda pretty awesome. They're super nice, funny, and great at making sandwiches. There is an extensive menu and build-your-own options. Great part is, this is a cheese shop! With a full selection of the cheeses your heart desires the counters is definitely more tempting than the apple in paradise. They also have a socially responsible mentality with organic and eco-friendly products as well as high-end oil, vinegar & salt imports.  Stop in for a sandwich, I suggest the ANY OF THEM"}
{"text":"If you love cheese you'll love this little gem.  They offer a large variety of sandwiches sorted by cheese. I've tried numerous ones and they've always been delicious! They also have soups as well as salads. (I've never tried either but they look good!)  You can also go in and buy cheese and cold cuts as it's also a tiny little store, with different crackers and marinades to buy.  They have a cute little seating area outside.   Extra plus you can hit up Dairy Queen right next door for dessert :)"}
{"text":"One of the nicest sandwich  place  in Montreal.  They would  have  earned  5 starts  if the staff was little  friendlier..."}
