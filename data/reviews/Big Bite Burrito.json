{"text":"This place is the spot for burritos not just in Scarborough but toronto. Price is amazing and ingredients are always fresh, I recommend this place to anyone"}
{"text":"\"regular\" size is HUGE!
the jerk chicken burrito and Baja chicken burrito are my favourites.
the staff are friendly and the restaurant is clean.
competitively priced, and a good size menu to select from.
Lot's of space to sit and eat, and they have wifi."}
{"text":"Good food and friendly service! I had the regular size burrito and it was very filling. The toppings were fresh and tasty. The baked chicken had decent flavor and is a solid choice. Their hot sauce has a kick and won't disappoint. I'll be back to try the jerk chicken burrito soon."}
{"text":"I picked up dinner from big bite burritos tonight and was super excited for it based on the great reviews here on yelp. Unfortunately it wasn't quite what we expected. Huge burritos so you get your money's worth so that's good and the naked bean and cheese was delicious. All ingredients were fresh and the restaurant was very clean. I tried the crispy chicken burrito and I just found the meat was a little bland. My daughter wanted the crispy chicken poutine with no cheese and this seemed to confuse the staff so I explained again, crispy chicken poutine with no cheese and she read back the order correctly. However when we got it home we looked and saw that there was no chicken at all so basically I paid $7 for a small fries with gravy and I'm not sure where that went wrong. Likely will not come back as there are other places around that might be better. Disappointing considering the rave reviews."}
{"text":"We ordered the jerk chicken quesadilla and jerk chicken burrito.

Burrito (size: grande) was a good portion. Very tasty!

PS: it was very spicy. Maybe because I told the person 'everything except olives' .. Lol. So she ended up putting a lot of jalapeño peppers and hot sauce too:)

Visited on a Saturday night between 6:30 and 7. Was still able to find two seats facing the window.

IMO it's better than 'Fat bastard' on Vic park and Sheppard."}
{"text":"This place is nothing special in terms of decor. Their food however is pretty good actually. Been going here consistently over the last couple of days and their burritos have been pretty consistently good. I do find that these guys tend to skimp out on the ingredients as there will be times I ask for extra rice or beans or veggies and they still don't end up giving much. Same with their meats, when I compare this burrito joint to fat bastards I find that these guys also tend to skimp out on their meats. I ordered a fried chicken burrito and noticed there was a lacking of the fried chicken. Also noticed one time that the person cooking the burrito had burned the wrap but rather informing the customer he quickly turned around and scrapped all the black stuff off. So all in all this place is rather average. Food is pretty good actually just wish their service was more consistent and they are less stingy when giving out food."}
{"text":"Big flavorful burritos  for a decent price. Nice to have it in the neighbourhood because it adds fresh flavour to Kennedy and shepperd."}
{"text":"Their burrito is amazingggg... As well as the staff. The place is clean and nice :)!!"}
{"text":"Great service and great food. The burrito bowls have a huggggee portion and taste great."}
{"text":"Got the poutine with like no gravy and cheese.  Not sure if they know what a poutine is... not worth the price.."}
{"text":"Usually a huge fan of this place, but came on Sunday night after checking the hours on yelp which said they close at 11 pm and found the door locked.  Sign on the door said they close at 11, staff were inside taking the toppings inside. It was 945..so after knocking a few times and the staff briefly looking up at me and returning to their cleaning I called them and asked what time they close.  They said they close at 10 and they're closed even though it was only 945. Beware if you're coming even remotely close to closing time."}
{"text":"Over a year later after I found Big Bite, I now consider it my go to burrito place. They never disappoint and the burritos are amazing every time I get them. The pulled pork has been my fave lately and they pack it full. Good job on keeping your burrito quality consistent!"}
{"text":"Best burritos in Scarborough ~ the portions are great, and the food is fresh. I've tried their ground beef, crispy chicken, and chickpea burritos.
All three were great. My only suggestion is to stick with the small or regular cause the burritos really are big!"}
{"text":"Their food is awesome! Tasty and BIG BIG portions.  This place is clean and the owner is super friendly to us.  

I ordered a burrito bowl with steak and it only costed me around $10, the portion was so big I only finished half for lunch and saved the other half for dinner. They even gave me chips and guacamole with no additional charges, while most other places charge you up to 3 dollars for these.  

Love this place so much and would definitely return again!"}
{"text":"First time going here was today and the burritos were awesome! The friendly staff helped me (the newbie) navigate though the many options on the menu. Got a large steak for my bf, it was HUGE and and small sweet chili chicken for myself (which was also huge). 

Toppings had so much flavour, hot sauce is actually hot and they're definitely not stingy with the toppings. Will definitely be going back and I highly recommend.

Also, we used to live downtown and are used to going to the bigger burrito spots.... In my opinion, this spot has soooo much more flavour than the others!!"}
{"text":"This is pretty good burrito place. They wrap them really well so they don't fall apart, ingredients are fresh and place is super clean. Only complaints are they are slightly slow at preparing the burrito and the guacamole is pretty much plain mushed avocado. But still a great place."}
{"text":"Guy who served us SUPER NICE! Food, amazing! Great sauces. Only thing i didnt like was the lettuce.. they should change that up. Other than that everything was great. I am super picky on food and this place actually had amazing food. We had burrito bowl, nachos, and burrito."}
{"text":"Have been coming here for years and it's my favourite burrito place. However, their burrito sizes have become smaller for the same price and they are not as generous with the portions anymore. 

It seems like they're hiring more incompetent staff as well. I told the girl I wanted \"everything except onions\" and she still went through each topping, asking me if I wanted it. Kind of nitpicky but I was pretty annoyed after telling her three times what I wanted. Hope the staff from before still work here. 

Luckily the food is still amazing so no complaints there."}
{"text":"Good:

I still choose Burrito Boys over this, but the food here is good and the service is fast. I like their burritos, quesadillas, and their chips and guacamole. They could include a little more guac than they give though, but another $1 for guac ain't bad. Clean dining area, washrooms, and kitchen. Food is fresh, and drink fridge is stocked properly. Most servers I've dealt with are friendly, listen well, and prepare the food well.

Bad:
There is one lady who worked the lunch shift on May 11, 2016 who is not exactly great with her service. She tried reaching for toppings before even asking me which ones I wanted. She put Jalapeños when I didn't ask for them, but I let it go.

Additionally, when she asked me if I wanted cheese when she started building the burrito, I told her no, but she dumped cheese before she wrapped it. I called her out on it, and she seemed surprised that I spoke up about it.  I also felt like she didn't think I understood English (maybe because of my Asian face). But she clearly speaks English decently. Maybe she doesn't have good listening skills?

I still took it, because I didn't want to waste food that I wasn't allergic to, but this is the only time that this establishment had questionable service."}
{"text":"Wow. I consider myself a burrito connoisseur. I could eat it everyday and couldn't care less about my butt. This place is amazing. Free guac! A huge array of free toppings. I even asked for more guac no questions asked. I ordered the steak and it was rammed with meat. 
Dare I say best burrito in toronto? It could very well be."}
{"text":"The burrito bowl is really good value - it feels like it's 10 pounds of food and impossible for me to finish on my own. Lots of toppings and the pulled pork is really tasty! Friendly service, no wait .... we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place is great ! Around the same price range as chipotle. Except they give you more food ! 

we have tried the baked chicken, south west chicken, and sweet chilli chicken burrito bowl, deep fried mars bar, and pulled pork poutine. So far, everything's been great! 

I like big bite burrito a lot more than other big chain burrito places because the servers actually care about the food they're making and it shows !"}
{"text":"I ordered the steak burrito bowl when I went and I definitely did not get what I expected. The only good thing was the portion was large and would be worth the price - only I didn't even bother finishing it because it was so unappetizing to me. I found the steak so unappetizing and it did not even take like steak. It was very hard to consume especially since their was so much steak in it. The rice and veggies were good, so if I ever go again I think I may just go for the veggie bowl - but I probably won't go again since their are really good food options in that plaza."}
{"text":"Tacos were below par. Three ground beef tacos that tasted on par with Taco Bell. What more can I say?"}
{"text":"I had the burrito bowl. It was huge and very tasty enough to feed two people. It's similar to Chipotle in the US."}
{"text":"Drove by this place dozens of times and finally decided to drop in to satisfy my burrito craving. It's pretty hard to find a great burrito this side of the DVP but Big Bite can compete with burrito boyz and other downtown spots. 

In addition to the meat being well seasoned, the great thing about this place is they don't skimp out on the fresh toppings. 

Customer service was amazing as both the staff working were very friendly."}
{"text":"Asked for no jalapeños, got Jalapeños. Burrito was burnt, like BLACK burnt. Asked for white, got whole wheat. Server touched my food with bare, unwashed hands. Super unimpressed."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I used to be a fan of Chipotle until I tried Big Bite Burrito. I normally get the Extreme Fries. It's listed on the menu as a side, but it's so huge that it's easily more than enough for a meal. I would also recommend the Mexican Coke and the deep-fried Mars Bar. The staff is super friendly and helpful and you can tell they truly care about the happiness and satisfaction of their customers. Like others have said, they're definitely not skimpy on the toppings and the prices are excellent for the amount of food you get. My only advice is if you're not a fan of spicy food, skip the hot sauce. It's VERY spicy! I have been back here a few times already and will continue to come back. Extremely satisfied customer right here!"}
{"text":"I've been here 6 or 7 times recently. It's a solid burrito place. I usually get the sweet potato burrito, which is quite nice. Toppings are decent. The hot sauce is very hot but good. Ask for 3 strips if you like it spicy."}
{"text":"I went through the effort to download the app and create an account, just for the sole purpose of writing a bad review for this place. I paid almost $10 (inc tax) for an average sized burrito that included overly salty beef and skimpy toppings. The worker had more guac on the knife she used to spread it with THAN ON MY ACTUAL BURRITO LOL?? My burrito came with 6 corn niblets, a tablespoon of \"pico de gallo\", as well as bad customer service! I am a believer in second chances, so I will return to BBB in hopes that I get a different worker that actually says \"Hello\" to me and gives me more than a spoonful of toppings."}
{"text":"Pretty decent Mexican food. Although they're not as good as Chipotle, I wouldn't justify driving that far just for burritos when I can go up the street to this place in 1 min. 

The tequila chicken is byfar my favorite. The jerk chicken is a close second. But it's really spicy. 

Order 20 minutes before since it takes them awhile to cook and prep your burrito. I've only ever seen 1 or 2 people working so expect a wait if there are tons of orders."}
{"text":"I have finally found my go to spot for burritos and it is only a 5 minute drive away, which is pretty dangerous for my waist line lol. 

I came here last night from a recommendation from my girlfriend and fellow yelper. It's in a plaza right off of Kingston road and you can't miss it. Only a couple people were in there but I figured it was probably because it was mothers day. I had no idea what to get as most of my burritos consist of just shredded beef. My friend told me about the sweet chili chicken wrap which sounded perfect. I got it crispy on a whole wheat wrap. The man helping me was super friendly and telling me about their business. There were tons of fresh ingredients and they give you some guac for free! It was a huge wrap for just a regular size and packed nice and tightly. Beware of the hot sauce as it is legitimately hot so i just got a bit on it. This burrito was so flavorful and delicious. It tasted so fresh and i could taste all the ingredients in each bite. I was so satisfied. Closer to the end it got messy so i just dumped it in a bowl and ate what was inside. I think next time I'll try the bowl. This is a must to visit! Sorry mucho burrito and chipotle, you can't compete with these guys!"}
{"text":"I usually go to chipotle to get my burrito fix so I was super excited when I found out about this place on Yelp. It's so much closer to home.  Unfortunately the food was a major disappointment.

I ordered the regular size steak burrito and a side of chips and salsa.  So the steak burrito really fell way short of expectations. The steak wasn't like grilled steak cut into pieces. The meat was more like a roast-kind of stringy and felt like it may have been slow cooked??  The ingredients were not as good as other burrito places like chipotle and burrito boyz. They gave the slightest amount of guac and it didn't even look fresh.

The chips and salsa was even more disappointing. Chips weren't homemade they seemed like the kind you get at the grocery store and they just quickly threw some in the fryer to warm it up. I asked for extra salsa and the lady told me it would be $1.00 extra. The worse part of it was the salsa they gave was not fresh made, it tasted exactly like the jarred stuff from the store. 

Perhaps I have been spoiled with the fresh ingredients from chipotle where the salsa and guacamole are fresh made, the meat just grilled and the helpings generous. I won't be returning and would rather drive an extra 20 minutes and pay a bit more at chipotle to get quality food."}
{"text":"This market space is pretty crowded with Fat Boys, Burrito Boyz  and all the others. Big Bite slides in there nicely. The only detraction is that they do not offer a gluten free wrap, so your only option is the burrito bowl. For everyone else, this place is a good stop when you gotta fill the hole!"}
{"text":"The tacos suck. The burritos are 7 out of 10 but the tacos were just flop. I got the crispy chicken tacos, and it had zero flavour. On top of that, the guy serving us wouldn't put certain toppings on the taco because it wasn't \"common\" had to fight with him for cilantro! If you want a quick burrito and live in the area, go for it but there's better places. They also don't serve pork, which sucks for the pork lovers"}
{"text":"The pictures on the window made this place tempting to try. Service was great, place is big and clean. Ordered the pull pork burrito and poutine. The pull pork was very salty... didn't even finish half of it before i threw it out. The poutine picture on the window showed cheese curds, i got grated cheese. And what made things even worst was the fries weren't even fully cooked... again had to throw this out. Waste of money."}
{"text":"Mucho burrito used to be my favourite burrito place in Port Union, till my friend took my to this place and it has raised my standards on what a burrito should be. Great service and food !"}
{"text":"There is a point where something isnt as good as it once was and its about time to let things go.

My last visit at Big Bite left alot to be desired, actually my last few visit but I brushed it off as just an off night but when you get a meh burrito 3 or 4 time at various points you got realize it not a fluke and its time to move on

The size of burrito have definity decrease over the past view visits,  and a few times the meat has been cold. They are somewhat filling but dont satisfy anymore,  it time to say goodbye to small and cold burritos."}
{"text":"I dropped by here tonight, with my son, to pick up some food for him.  I only noticed this place, recently, when I went into the bank.  
 
The place was empty when we walked in at around 6pm.  An employee then came into the restaurant after a couple of minutes.  We've never been here before and finally decided to get the minced beef burrito bowl.  We started off with rice but passed on the refried beans.  Then there were lots of fresh looking toppings.  We got lettuce, onions, coriander, peppers, jalapenos, guacamole, tomatoes, corn and salsa.   Could have gotten cheese, olives and black beans too.  Then we got some hot sauce, sour cream and garlic sauce drizzled on top plus a few tortilla chips too.  Then the minced beef was spooned on top.  

We took the box of food home and it was delicious.  The serving size was good, my son finished around 2/3rds.  I judge serving sizes from how much he can eat, as he's only 9 and doesn't have a big appetite.  Anyplace were he finishes a meal HAS small serving sizes.  Nice food and friendly service."}
{"text":"came here once as a friend recommended it. personally i have yet to find many burrito joints in the area and after trying this place, i was quite happy with it. pretty much your typical burrito joint with your standard choice of meat and veggie toppings. i wouldn't say there was anything special about this place but it satisfied our craving for burritos. i was disappointed to find that they didn't offer burrito bowls though."}
{"text":"Like I said in previous posts- Iove me some burritos! We stumbled upon this place while passing it numerous times. What drew my fiancée to this place is the fact they advertised Jerk Chicken. Can you say yum?!

I'm glad to say we finally did. The decor is cute. They have humorous signs up on the one wall. The seating is very limited. It gives me the impression it's more of a take out joint. 

On to the food! We ordered regular burritos. A buffalo chicken and jerk chicken. They were yummy and good but we both found they were very saucy at times. Flavour of the Buffalo was good and had a nice spice touch. However, I found the sauce got old in terms of flavour real quick. 

4 out of 5 stars- too much sauce but still delicious!"}
{"text":"My daughter wanted nachos on the way home from work.  We stopped in here.  We ordered and split some nachos and a bean & cheese burrito.  The nachos were pretty hum drum.  The toppings were tasteless.  Very disappointed in the nachos.  The burrito was very good.  Generous stuffings and very tasty.   The daughter almost had me thinking I could get by without meat .. Nah."}
{"text":"We've noticed since the owner left that the portion size has gone down. A whole 4 slices of olives when I asked for olives. A tiny sprinkle of everything else. Still tastes good but burritos are noticeably smaller. I hate the stupid signs they have all over one wall. Some are inappropriate I feel. It's supposed to be a burrito place, not a mismatch of antique signs. I feel pictures of Mexico, beaches, burritos....almost anything would be better then those tacky signs."}
{"text":"I was intrigued by the idea of Jerk Chicken Burrito. For the most part I enjoyed my experience. The service was fine. I am not sure if I would get the jerk chicken burrito again, as a burrito it was fine. However, I didn't really get any jerk chicken flavour from it. I'm not gonna say the place was bad, I liked it. I will eat here again, I just want to try some other things, it was definely worth trying other things."}
{"text":"Big big portions for the burritos and extreme fries! Good enough to be split in half, one end for lunch and the other end for dinner. I had the jerk chicken burrito and my boyfriend had the pulled pork burrito and they were both flavourful. The toppings were distributed evenly throughout the burritos. The extreme fries was seasoned soo well and the topping amounts was perfectly even."}
{"text":"One or my girl friend's has been raving about this place since forever so I decided to give it a try. I decided to try the poutine and I can't lie, it was a really good poutine! Gravy was super tasty and the perfect consistency. I also got a side of guac and hot sauce--I loved the hot sauce, it was super tasty without overdoing it on the heat. On the other hand, the guac was super salty and had too much in it. Sometimes less is more and this rule definitely applies to guac in general. 

Overall I enjoyed my food but found it to be a bit more on the pricy side considering the boxes are only filled up half way. I'd come here if I were in the area but wouldn't go out of my way for Big Bite Burrito."}
{"text":"Pros: Great customer service. The staff is polite and they like to start conversation with you which is what is hard to find these days. For example, I ended up talking about my visit to apple store before i got there and they were good listeners plus very polite.  Also The dining area and the place itself looked neat and clean.
Cons: I ordered their fries special and although their serving was good quantity wise, the potatoes felt a bit bitter."}
{"text":"Servings are huge! My BF got the pulled pork Burrito Bowl aka Naked Burrito for $8.79. The serving is huge, the taste is good, vegetables are fresh and crunchy. However, I noticed the pulled pork is a little bit salty.

I got the deep fried Mars bar for $2.99. First of course I was shocked at how much larger it is compared to the deep fried Mars bar at Fat bastard burrito. There was too much batter than chocolate which made me feel like it lacked taste and quality. Nothing too remarkable on the deep fried mars bar.

You don't have to pay extra for guacamole.

This place is very much similar to Fat Bastard Burrito, if you are familiar with that place too.

Nothing too special, but if you are a fan of huge portions, then this is the place to be."}
{"text":"For the longest time, I thought this place was cheaper than it is. I have no idea why this is anymore. A regular bowl, standard protein will cost you about $9-10. I got the fried chicken. It was crispy and quite tasty. While the portion was not bad, it wasn't as huge as I expected it to be. They put about one scoop of rice and not quite a scoop of beans at the bottom. I did get most everything, save for cilantro, cheese (stomach flu is the worst), sour cream, jalepenos, and crisps. Tasty, but not so much that I'd go out of my way to try it. Also, I don't know what it says that this location had next to no one inside on a Saturday at lunch when it was nice outside.

Perhaps my nose is off, but if I walked into this location blindfolded, I'd swear I was in an Indian restaurant. Please take this as the neutral statement I am making. It was an interesting observation and nothing else."}
{"text":"This place is highly overrated on Yelp, and it's expensive. I don't blame most of the previous reviewers since the good burrito options are far from Scarborough. The pictures of the menu here are outdated, as their smallest and cheapest burritos are now $6.99 and most of the \"good\" fillings are $7.99+. Considering the crappy strip plaza this is located in, this is a money grab by the owners. The food does not compare to Burrito Boyz, Burrito Banditos at all. The hot sauce is very vinegary, and the filling was no where near as tasty as Burrito Boyz. In short, I wouldn't come here again and I recommend others hold out and try a better burrito from some of the other options (Burrito Boyz, Bandidos, Chipotle)."}
{"text":"Big bite is right. Let me start by telling you my unconditional love for burritos. I LOVE THEM. Especially burrito bowls.. it's like happiness in each bite. Whenever I'm a food court with chipotle, I will get chipotle. It's not even a question. When yelp searching 'burrito' at 12am one night (I know you feel me on this), I came across this 4 star venue not that far away - I knew the next day I had to holla @ it.

The parking lot is soooo small .. most people in the area walk, but if you are parking .. good luck. Spaces are tighter than your old gym teacher's pants too.. be extremely careful when backing in, which is what you'll want to do because I cannot even fathom leaving this lot (which opens directly into the road) with head in parking. It's super easy to find though, right at kennedy and sheppard. 

The burrito place is bigger than I expected. It was also not dingy, like I had expected. With cute retro and sarcastic signs all over the wall, I knew this was the type of place I can f with. Ordering is super quick and even though there were only 2 workers, they were efficient. Pretty much the same speed as the command chain @ chipotle. I was also surprised to see how many options of burrito, the sizes and sides you can get. They even had more than one vegan/vegetarian option!! Woop woop! I opted for the sweet potato burrito bowl, which was under $10 and had guac included. Chipotle can seriously eat it's dust because big bite provided such a packed bowl that I felt sickening-full before with a large portion left to spare inside the box. They also had a lot of options to choose from to put in your burrito/burrito bowl. Corn, jalapeno, tomato, salsa, FREE guac, green pepper, olive, onions and they add in chips on the side for how much extra? FREE! & might I add that the sweet potato medallions in my bowl were larger than life.

The bf also ordered a pulled pork burrito. They called it out within minutes and he started to devour it, the hungry bear he is. As he was halfway done, the man shouted to him and asked him if it was pulled pork that he had. Turns out it wasn't and he had eaten someone else's burrito. Completely not his fault though because the guy making it did call out pulled pork instead of what it actually was - chicken. So in the end, my boyfriend got a free burrito.. LOL. & He claims the mistaken chicken one he had was actually better than the pulled pork one.

I really like this place and I'm glad it's open kind of late-ish because I will definitely be searching for 'burrito' in the late hours of the night again. I'm also a fan of not going broke every time I get a burrito bowl and have to consider if I should get guac or have enough $ to live semi-comfortably for the rest of the week. Achem, chipotle."}
{"text":"Such a large portion! My husband and I wanted to try this, we always drive by it on the way home. It's just in such a busy part of the intersection that's why we always hesitated. Luckily, there was parking right in front that finally gave us a chance to try it. 

Clean interior and friendly staff. Interior had little counter seating but it was obviously a take out place rather than a dine-in. Good service though. She was very helpful and very patient while we chose our dinner. 

We both got burrito bowls. My husband got a steak burrito bowl while I got the crispy chicken burrito bowl (the counter staff recommended it to help my baffled face decide on something). We also got chips and salsa with a side of sour cream. And last, churros with chocolate sauce. The bowls were yummmmmyy! Ingredients were fresh and you can add as much. I was pretty surprised that the guacamole was free. Like it was included in the bowl. You didn't need to add any extra charge while other places would. The bowls came with a little chips too.

Overall, good find. Straightforward with their food. Both bowls were satisfying and quite large for the price. Would definitely come back to get my Mexican fix on."}
{"text":"Been here a couple times and never been disappointed. Good burritos for a reasonable price. 

Usually I get the half chicken, half beef, with everything in it. For $9 with tax you get a big burrito which is pretty filling. Everything tastes pretty good. I heard their poutine is good as well. Way better than Mucho Burrito and Chipotle (which is super overhyped). 

Big Bite is a good burrito joint with the same taste, price, and quality of its competitors. 4/5."}
{"text":"Staff is very friendly and helpful. The food was amazing. I did not expect Canada to have such great mexican food. I'm mexican and I would definitely recommend this place. Their steak is what I would call shredded beef."}
{"text":"Went for a takeaway last night. There was nobody there so it doesn't look like this is a busy place. The person on the counter assisted me with what to choose and told me about the popular picks.

I had sweet and spicy chicken burrito, it wasn't as spicy as burrito boys or fat bastard and it had much less meat than them. It was still pretty decent but i'd prefer having a burrito from somewhere else if i am given a choice."}
{"text":"Came here because I wanted to try their Tequila chicken burrito and their deep fried mars bar. Big roomy dining area, friendly staff. 

I liked their burrito but not the tequila chicken itself because it was unnecessarily sweet. The veggies were fresh, rice was tasty and the tortilla was soft but held up well to being stuffed without coming apart. They didn't have the fried mars bar BOO! What a tease!!

Had their Extreme Fries with a side of guacamole. It tasted like veggie taco toppings on top of salty fries. Tried to liven it up with some guacamole but it was bland.

Tried their Jumex Coconut Pineapple Nectar: thin and sweet but tasty.

Wouldn't go out of my way to come here but if I was in the area, I might be back to try some other items."}
{"text":"Not that great. Didn't want to drive all the way to Fat Bastard and decided to give Big Bite a try. Basically a copy of FB, but a notch or two lower grade. Ingredient quality so-so, quantities are small, hot sauce is basically Frank's Red Hot, surly person built the burrito, place isn't particularly clean, rough finishings and apparently under ongoing renovation.

Burrito was OK, the Frank's taste was quite overpowering and the combination of not-great quality ingredients was disappointing.  

For the same money, I'll make the drive over to Warden to Fat Bastard, the better product and experience is worth it IMO."}
{"text":"Went here based on the reviews so I'd thought I should give this a try. Tried the steak burrito and the steak was not really steak.....its more like shredded steak which taste totally different from a real steak burrito....."}
{"text":"Great little New burrito joint in the 14th/Markham rd plaza (beside Tangerine). Tons of fresh toppings to choose from & some unique burritos (Jerk Chicken was amazing). $6.99 for a good size Burrito is a well priced. Very clean, Don't sleep on this place."}
{"text":"I was visiting my friend on Sunday evening in the area and we decided to stop in and grab some food because I love burritos so much I got the regular size crispy chicken burrito \"what a disappointment!\" The chicken was dry and taste similar to no name brand chicken pieces from No frills I also got the nacho chips with salsa which was freshly fried it was good and I got a large portion. My friend got the supreme fries she said it was ok. Large portions are offered for what you pay. All the ingredients looked fresh. Taste wise I wasn't impressed."}
{"text":"After going past this place a bunch of times and seeing what other people had written about this, we decided to see what the fuss was all about. So you go in and it's basically got the set up of a fast food restaurant - you order at the counter and then they call you when it's ready and you sit down at your table/take out. Nothing fancy about the decor, and the menu is posted above the cash. A lot of options to take in at once and the older lady there seemed unhappy to be there. A younger woman came and took over and she was extremely helpful, explaining the options and what was popular when I asked her. So I ordered a Crispy Chicken Burrito. Whole wheat wrap, guac (yeah, the older lady came back to put my toppings on and she glared at me when I asked for extra, so much for that theory) and LOTS of selection of fresh toppings (olives, lettuce, cilantro, pico de gallo, salsa, corn, green peppers, green onion and the usual refried beans, rice, black beans, cheese, sour cream, hot sauce, burrito sauce etc. Was this the best burrito I've ever eaten? No, but it was good. Next time I'd choose a different meat/filling - the Crispy Chicken was a bit too fast foody for my liking, but that's just personal choice. Prices weren't bad and the fresh veggie options will bring me back."}
{"text":"So apparently this place opened up a month ago (it's a couple of doors down from Boston Pizza). Thank goodness for a local burrito spot and even more so for actually being really good! 

There was just one other customer there when we went in. Two guys were working there, both were really informative and friendly. They helped us decide what to order, I ended up getting the Baja burrito in the regular size (regular, large and huge options available). 

No regrets. Super filling and it was delicious! The hot sauce is actually really hot (but yum) so I'd suggest trying it first. The chicken has a nice BBQ flavour to it and was crispy. 

There is room to dine in. I will definitely be back to try the other stuff on the menu. From the top of my head, they do burritos, burrito bowls, chips, quesadillas and poutines. Definitely check it out if you're in the area and want a bite. 

5/5 -- great first impression."}
{"text":"Got a large chicken burrito for $7.99 - the large was quite filling. Tasted great with all the stuff thats packed into the burrito. I found the amount of meat to be on the low side. Guacamole is available as a topping which is nice but they give you very little of it. Even when I asked for more she put as little as she could. Picture a butter knife with a blob of butter to spread over your toast. Thats about the amount you will get if you dont ask for more. 

There are a few stools available. Parking is limited. 

I wouldn't say this is an authentic Mexican experience but rather just quick Mexican fast food.

Overall, the meal was tasty, filling and at a decent price."}
{"text":"One of my favourite places to eat, and one of my go to places to go with my boyfriend. The burritos are definitely a friendly portion, enough for two meals if you aren't a heavy eater. 

There's a variety of choices for the protein, and if you are a vegetarian there are also plenty of options. None of them have disappointed me, but I still tend to stick with shrimp or calamari.

There are a lot of toppings to choose from and it is so filling, making the price of $8.99 for a big a reasonable price. I wouldn't recommend the tacos, but everything else is good!"}
{"text":"One hell of a big burrito! Definitely definitely definitely one of the best I've had! Funny story haha they called out pulled pork but it was baked chicken, which was delicious... Although I was already half way done before they asked me what I had actually ordered. It was pretty much the same ingrediants as mine except for the chicken! Such a bomb burrito! Then I got my pulled pork, but the best part was i got 2 burrito for the price of 1 hahaha. Definitely will come back here! 

A bit far thought... but worth the drive! defintely a small parking lot and not to make it worse but that intersection is always busy from what I've seen. The decor on the inside is nice haha with all the posters and signs."}
{"text":"If you're like me, you wonder: how bad can a burrito really be? Well... I didn't think they could be until I tried this place. The beef I ordered was burnt to a crisp and did not have a good flavour. Price is average for a burrito, however I have had MUCH better so it was not worth it. The only saving grace is that the burrito was wrapped well and the customer service was great. However, if this place wants to stay in business they need better ingredients and cooking methods."}
{"text":"Decent food, good for the price. It taste good and the portion is great. Love the chicken burrito. Not as good as fat bastard burrito but very similar. The best burrito to this day for me is from burrito bandidos."}
{"text":"Okay, I need to start off by saying that I typically love burritos and really, any kind of Mexican food, whether it's authentic or not. That being said, this is the worst burrito I've ever eaten in my life. 

I ordered a veggie burrito bowl. The only good thing I can say is that the box for the burrito bowl is quite large. 

The bad:

-sauce: tasteless (not even sure what it was) 
-lettuce: iceberg (gross) 
-black beans: directly from a can, no flavour
-corn: directly from a can, no flavour
-refined beans: directly from can, no flavour
-salsa: from a jar (absolutely disgusting) 
-veggies: there were no fajita style cooked veggies at all 
-rice: too much, no flavour, had some hard pieces 
-the rest: so bland it's not even worth mentioning 

Overall, I could not finish this burrito bowl. I would not even bother coming back to try anything else as I'm sure it will taste like it is store bought. I could put in a lot less effort and make a much better burrito myself. I am SO disappointed in this place. I don't think I would eat it even if it was free. Save your money and go elsewhere. Literally anywhere else."}
{"text":"It was good... The burritos are HUGE!!! even the Regular size... All portions are big ! And the spicy sauces were super nice!

The dine-in area is good and the staff are friendly ...the food is good ... and the Nachos were Super Oily ... the Guc lacked a bit of flavor. We had the pulled pork Bowl and the Steak burrito...if you are not super hungry or tend to eat smaller portions ... I would suggest splitting a Bowl/Burrito with someone!"}
{"text":"Oh man the meat was so dry as if it has been just been defrosted and squeezed dry on the grill."}
{"text":"Went here today after driving past it many times.
This place is awesome.
First thing that stood out is the staff, AMAZING!
So nice and polite. Really great to see that.
Based on the staff alone I will be sure to visit again.

The burrito is priced well, a $1 less than Fat B's to be exact.
The toppings are great, the olives, corn, and black beans were nice (and not offered at other places).

I got the baked chicken on whole wheat and found it to be as good as other burritos I've had. I have ZERO complaints. 

Great staff, good price and good burrito..............you gotta go check em out for yourself.

Keep up the good work guys, good product !"}
{"text":"love the jerk chicken burrito. One of the best burrito places"}
{"text":"Closed more often than opened. Opened once of the five times I've visited during store hours.  Burrito bowls are pretty good tho"}
{"text":"It's nice to find a burrito place that is in this area. I can't say there's anything that really stands out here -- basically the same as burrito boys. $6.99 for a regular. $2.50 for a bottle drink -- they got authentic Mexican pop! 

Quick and fast service. The price is the same as every other burrito place."}
{"text":"Okay, it's either I went in on a bad day or this place is just horrible. My fiancé and I were starving before we got there. My quesadilla was wet. Enough said. He had asked for the steak burrito bowl and got the pulled pork. The burrito bowl was cold. It totally turned us off eating.

The staff was friendly though. I just wish the quality of food was better."}
{"text":"Severely disappointed. Quality of produce used with food is very low quality. Supreme fries are prepared old and served cold. 

Definitely will not be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"Place was nice and clean, staffs were friendly. 

We ordered 2 huge burritos but it's not as big as we thought it would be. The amount of toppings was a bit stingy, the lady was very very stingy with the toppings. The amount of meat was reasonable, actually quite a lot, however, the taste was extremely dry (steak and the chicken burritos). 

But the cook was nice, he handed the burrritos to us with two hands!"}
{"text":"Jerk chicken burrito is really tasty. Portions are large. They don't skimp on the meat. Reasonably priced. Never seems to be busy. I hope it lasts."}
{"text":"A different option in the sea of Asian restaurants in the hood. I usually like to come here for a burrito when I want something else aside from Chinese food.

Chicken Burrito ($7.49) is not mind blowing 4 star but definitely satisfying as a meal. I like how I can pick whatever topping I like till my burrito explored. 

Parking is a little limited and you might have a hard time back out to Sheppard during rush hour."}
{"text":"Not exactly sure when this place opened but its really good.  Wife and I got 2 chicken burritos. The toppings were fresh with many options. By the time I was done choosing everything my burrito was huge.  I got the hot sauce, I was warned it was hot so I only got a bit. Glad I took his advice the sauce was haaawt but went perfect with the burrito. Would highly recommend this place the regular burrito was very filling and only $6!  Support the local guys and try this place."}
{"text":"First time eating here. Looked up local places in the area and this showed up so I thought I'd give it a try. I got the Fried chicken burrito and extreme fries. The burrito was big enough to feed both me and my boyfriend for a good late night snack at 10:30pm. Couldn't even finish the fries. The extreme fries come in a \"small\" box loaded with toppings. Fries were nice and crunchy. We couldn't even tackle half of it. Good place to go to when craving a burrito. Staff friendly. This place appeared to have regulars greeting people as they came in a joking with them. Chicken was nice and crispy. Shell was nice and crusty from the grill. The place was not very pleasing to the eye like Fat Bastard Burrito however the place seemed clean. Definitely a good take out place when in the area. Wouldn't go out my way to go here though."}
{"text":"This place is good BUT I can't stand the fact they charge extra if you want more guacamole or burrito sauce.  I have only had the tartar fish burrito.  They put very little sauce in to begin with so my burrito ended up being quite dry. Stop being a bunch of cheapos!"}
{"text":"This is hands down my burrito spot! We come here once a week. The service is quick and super nice. Their toppings are always fresh and filled up! I love the variety of choices to eat. I usually get the Buffalo Chicken burrito or burrito bowl. So delicious."}
{"text":"I came here last night for a burrito and let me tell you I am very shocked. Ordered a ground beef burrito but when I took it home the ground beef was dry and burnt. I used to love coming here but can't believe I was served this kind of crap. Never coming back again."}
{"text":"Recent visit wasn't a great experience;  not sure if it's the new staff or a one off. Toppings were not fresh: guacamole was brown, lettuce was wilted. They also skimped on quantity (eg. tiny portion of rice, literally 2 pieces of tomato chunks, a few slivers of lettuce). Not sure why they became so skimpy with toppings; used to give u generous amount of fresh toppings. I used to like this place; hopefully this was a one off"}
{"text":"Had a hunkering for something girthy and good. Since when was there a burrito place in Each a story Scarborough?! Staff was friendly and menu is priced accordingly. The grande  is the size of Quesada's Big Ass Burrito (another personal favourite) guacamole and black beans included before paying extra. Their hot sauce is west-indian proper hot so be forewarned. Flavour is good on here chicken grande ($9.05) and I've only gotten through half. Only bad thing to say is tiny puddle of ants on the floor be the bathroom."}
{"text":"One of my favourite Markham restaurants. Always get the sweet chilli burrito. Loved the quesadilla as well (tip: oily and have napkins nearby)."}
