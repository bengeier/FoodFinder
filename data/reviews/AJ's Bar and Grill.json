{"text":"I have been coming to this place for years and have enjoyed it every time except for today. My son and I got there , Sat down, got our coffees and ordered. Up to that point everything was fine , then when 20 minutes went by I wondered if they forgot our order, next another table who sat down well after we ordered got their breakfast I asked the waitress ,she was rude and had the balls to tell me it was because it takes longer to make our food. The kicker is the table that got served ahead of us ordered the same as us. No apologies ,no nothing!!!. It doesn't take a half hour to make breakfast. They screwed up an tried to put it on me. Breakfast restaurants are all over the place, no problem finding another!!!"}
{"text":"I normally wouldn't take the time to write a review but my experience was so bad that I hope someone reads this and fixes the problem for their business' sake. Me and my fiancé went for breakfasts there for the first time and asked the waitress if the philly omelette was a good option. She hesitated then said yes. We assumed she was being honest and proceeded to order one beef and one Turkey philly omelette.    When the Omelette's arrived they were extremely bland. This could have really been a good dish if they had seasoned the meat. Imagine boiling shredded beef and Turkey not seasoning at all and throwing it in an omelette with cheese and peppers. It was truly awful.   We asked for hot sauce and BBQ sauce. She brought it to the table and didn't say a word regarding the fact that there was an up charge to get BBQ sauce.   We added it to the Omelette's to try to make them edible so we don't have to wait for another meal as we were in a rush. They still tasted horrible and my fiancé didn't finish 75% of it.   I'm a garbage disposal so I ate the whole thing. Plus I was hungry   Then the waiter sits down with her family to share a meal completely disregarding our table. I chose not to say anything out of respect as her child and husband were there.  Finally she remembered the table in a rush who have had a horrible experience were staring at the back of her head and she turned around getting up from her meal.  I asked for the bill and she asked if we wanted the food packed. We replied no because we did not enjoy it as politely as possible.  Then we see the bill. Nothing was done to rectify both bad meals and the cherry on top was she charged us $1.50 for BBQ sauce.   Now if she mentioned the charge earlier that would have been fine, but since there was no mention at the time I asked for it and now after her hearing that we are about to pay approx $30 for a meal that we both didn't like, that felt like salt in the wounds and total disregard for customer experience   Btw tables were sticky utensils had jam on them :s Whole place wasn't welcoming. Still tipped her 15% as she was pregnant and I felt bad   I would never eat here again and neither should you   Worst breakfast ever!!!"}
{"text":"Im giving 4stars because of the fast service, large portions and reasonable prices. This isn't necessarily 'lean cuisine' or 'modern fare' but if you want a hearty brunch to fill you up for a long while then make your way there and enjoy : ) ....fyi I had the \"Hungry Man\""}
{"text":"The prices and food are excellent.  There is always something on the menu that will satisfy everyone.  The service is excellent and the staff will make recommendations and will accommodate special requests. Their daily specials are great too.  The atmosphere could use an update, but the restaurant is clean and friendly!"}
{"text":"Today I had the chance to get breakfast and again lunch from the same place. My 1st physical visit to this place. Can be improved to more appealing. Food is good."}
{"text":"Great place, has delicious food and the service is really friendly. Very home like feeling to it and inviting. The wings were as good as St. Louis just a block away and the price is about the same too"}
{"text":"I really, really wanted to love this place, but ended up being a bit disappointed.  We found this place from other Yelp reviews, and we are always in search of the perfect brunch, wherever we are. We decided to head over to this place, which is tucked into the back of a number of other businesses, kind of hidden.  Inside is very nice, furnished in dark woods, pretty classy looking. The sign said to seat yourself.  We were initially attended to promptly, and our order was taken. I went for their Eggs Benny, and Lee went for a Lumberjack special, along with coffees.  The food was great, the Eggs Benedict were well prepared with nice home fries and a good hollandaise. Lee was happy with his mountain of meats and pancakes.  The problems began after we were served. I am wondering if this place is understaffed, because there were a couple of big tables seated in the place, and there were only 2 servers that I could see. The kitchen was pumping out food, but the servers weren't really able to keep up with everything. There wasn't anyone to bus tables, and they were too busy to get to them. We got one coffee refill and then nothing at all for the rest of the time, except right at the very end. You could tell the servers were stressed, because there were some voices being raised over by the pass. Our server was so harried that she forgot that she actually brought food out to us, and apologized for the wait and that our food would be right out. We had to stop her to remind her that she had already served us.   I also think that part of the problem was there were an awful lot of people doing takeout orders, that seemed to be overwhelming the staff in addition to the large tables. 2 people to be minding this place was really nowhere near enough!  I think I would go back, but perhaps check to make sure they were fully staffed before doing so."}
{"text":"I had a really good brunch here recently and I didn't even know this place existed! It is pretty much right behind the Mclaughlin strip mall with the Canadian Tire and Timmies inside. Well, anyways the menu is pretty standard breakfast which is what we were going for, this is my one complaint: nothing that is a signature item or sounds out of the ordinary.  But the food was really good, the service was amazing and the pricing is affordable.  I had the waffle with fruit and that waffle...I think I finished it in under a minute, hands down the fluffiest and freshest waffle I have had outside of my own kitchen. The fruit was on the side and in a little bowl, not much fruit but I found it to be just the right amount to not waste any food. All in all, a pretty stand-up joint for your next breakfast!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast for fair prices. They even have a Newfie Breakfast,  fried bologna and eggs. Didn't get that this time but try another time. They cooked my eggs perfectly and the ham was a nice thick piece. Will be back for breakfast for sure."}
