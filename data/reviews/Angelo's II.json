{"text":"Great little restaurant located in downtown Monongahela. Very affordable. Kid menu. They offer Italian dishes, sandwiches, salads, appetizers and dessert. They also have a separate bar area. The town has a lot of antique shops and this is a great place to stop and eat while shopping."}
{"text":"The food is amazing! I really like their gnocchi and salads! Very reasonably priced and quick"}
{"text":"It's been awhile since I've had food here. Granted, I can't say anything was horrible, but I find it way too expensive for me and the quality just isn't up to snuff, especially when it comes to their pizza. I may try this place again if I hear that there's been improvement, but if not, there are plenty of other dives in and around town one could go to."}
{"text":"A small quaint place with no ambience but the food was good. We had veal to pizza burger or ravioli. The veal was more of a frozen patty but it was tasty and for 10.99 what do you expect? The ravioli was homemade or at least looked like it was and very good. The cheese sticks & zucchini fries were yum as were the cheese balls. The sauce was a nice *medium* marinara. I heard no complaints from any of the family."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Italian spots in the mon valley. I'm big on \"mom & pop\" style Italian and this place is just that. Very small sort of hole in the wall place but that doesn't matter because the food is where it's at. I typically get the homemade raviolis or the gnocchi, both which are amazing. They also have a Delicious house salad to start off with fresh Italian bread yum!"}
{"text":"Wow...nice folks there but the food was terrible. Often my wife and I will hit the GPS for food and off we go on an adventure. Last night we found Angelos II.  It's a typical river town \"dive\" with a bar and a small area for food. I had a small pizza and my wife is the chicken parm. Portions were quite large but the breaded  chicken was fried to excess. The Mariana was lacking flavor to me and my wife thought it had a bit too much acid. Salad was brownish and wilted.   I ordered a small pizza. It was to be kind,sub par. The onions on the top of the pie were cold and the anchovies were directly out of the can and cold as well. The sauce resembled a something you would expect on pasta and was seriously lacking in taste.   This was a \"one and done\" dining experience and honestly, I think that if it wasn't for the bar, they would have closed long ago."}
{"text":"A long time staple of Monongahela. This place is great! It's the quintessential small town Italian place. I have had everything on the menu and for the money, you really can't go wrong. The go to favorites are the gnocchi, the pizza (a unique style of pie), and the antipasto salad - ask for it with the extra pizza cheese... The bar is a quaint place to sit and have a beer too. It has changed ownership since it originally opened over 30 years ago, but the food and awesome small town experience have remained the same..."}
{"text":"Food is great if you like everything to taste the same.  Their \"pierogies\" look more like re-branded ravioli.  Pizza is basically cheese and sauce on a large Poppin' Fresh dough lump.  Come here if you don't know how to cook for yourself, like to eat garbage, and want to over pay for it.  Eat at McDonald's instead.  You'll probably live longer.  Maybe not, but it will certainly taste better and cost less."}
