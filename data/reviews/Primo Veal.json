{"text":"I live across the street from Primo Veal and make it a point to have lunch there every Friday. Try the hot peppers on the veal sandwich. PRIMO!!!!!"}
{"text":"I have been going to Primo for years, and they are the best in the city! Their veal sandwich can't be beat! They make everything in front of you, they allow you to choose your toppings and the place is very clean. The owners really care about their business and this translates to delicious food and impeccable customer service. I have had authentic home made Italian and the sauce here would get grandma's approval."}
{"text":"On the advice of fellow yelpers, my friend & I decided to give Primo Veal a try for lunch today.  Small establishment.  We were greeted by a very friendly couple... the owner(s) possibly?, anyways, we told them it was our first time & he was very informative about the overview of the menu... basically, family recipes... \"I am SO THERE\" when I hear words like that, which brings me to the meatball sandwich... (Wednesday's special)  Three LARGE, LEAN, NOT OVER SALTED balls of goodness with onions & roasted peppers on a FRESH bun.  My friend had the veal sandwich, which was indeed made to order, so far it's the best one he's had yet. light & crispy...mmmm.
Next time we'll have to try Lasagna Thursday's  :p"}
{"text":"Wow how is it possible this is such a well kept secret. This has to rank in top three places in the GTA . Every topping you can taste and the sauce is out of this world. I pledge let's get rid of the chains and let's get back to the ground roots of the mamma and papa places.

WOW...."}
{"text":"First, I'd like to start off by saying that this place is NOT CLOSED and they certainly don't plan on closing any time soon. 

My husband has been frequenting this establishment for ages and I was certainly eager to try. Having recently moved to the area from NY, I was desperate to find some awesome Italian- N. American style cuisine and this place did not disappoint. The Veal sandwiches are fried fresh to order and absolutely to die for! I look forward to returning and trying some of their other fare, but damn, they make a good veal sandwich!!"}
{"text":"Make sure you don't miss this gem in Scarborough. It's tucked away facing Pharmacy at the intersection, and is absolutely worth visiting. One bite of the tender and juicy veal sandwich and you'll understand why. For the sandwich, you can either have sauce poured on top of the meat or have it dunked into the sauce. I suggest the latter. Yes, it can get a bit messy, but it tastes so much better that way anyways.

Since there's a lack of seating, I recommend ordering sandwiches to go. Make sure to bring cash because the business is cash only. There's no need to be shy either because the owner is extremely friendly. Oh, and one last thing. Prepare to say goodbye to precooked veal cutlets that have been left out for however long, and hello to veal made fresh to order before your very eyes!"}
{"text":"It's on Pharmacy at Sheppard -address says Sheppard but it's on the Pharmacy side of the plaza Excellent !had veal sandwich and my wife had chicken cutlet -it was delicious, hot peppers, eggplant, mushrooms, onions and sauce"}
{"text":"This is a little hole in the wall type of place. If you weren't looking for it you probably wouldn't notice it. Not to mention the owners are so friendly! 

I ordered the chicken sandwich (I know it's a veal place but I can't get myself to stop imaging cute little baby calves and feel guilty) Nevertheless, it's one of the best chicken sandwiches I've had! The hot peppers are a MUST! I love spicy food and their peppers actually give quite the kick.

I paid around ten bucks for the sandwich with extra toppings plus a drink, which is truly a steal for food this delicious. 

The seating is a row of small tables outside, which on a fair weather day is actually a joy!

They take cash only and are very limited on parking."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Has the best veal sandwich I've ever had and the owners are super nice.  Occasionally (can't remember which day) they have lasagne made by the owners mother which is amazing."}
{"text":"Best Italian veal sandwich I've had in a long time. Made fresh to order. I was told I got the last two veals of the day (they close at 7pm) and had I wanted 3 sandwiches I would have been out of luck. Fine with me. I like to know the food doesn't sit around.

The bun was fresh, the veal hot and crispy but tender inside, and the tomato sauce was full of flavour (definitely made in-house). Hot peppers added more than a little zip. Very satisfying. Friendly, fast service. There are a few stools and a narrow counter to eat at but it's mainly a take-out joint."}
{"text":"Wow,  the veal was spectacular.  Definitely putting this place on my list of lunch on the go haunts.  
The sauce is truly idea for the veal   Lol"}
{"text":"Been meaning to try this place out for a while after reading the good reviews.

Great veal sandwiches at a fair price!
Check it out! The couple there are very nice. I'll definitely go back.

Notes: closed Sundays and bring cash."}
{"text":"I
Newly relocated at the corner of Yorkland and Consumers Road I North York.  
Family run business serving quality Italian food. All of the classics. Specialty is the veal sandwich. Get it dipped in the tomato sauce with sauteed onions on top. You will not be disappointed. Open mainly for lunch but those heading home can pick up dinner. Take out or eat in.
Enjoy."}
{"text":"Saw recommendations and went their, pretty disappointed.
Had Veal Cutlet with hot pepper topping. fresh enough, but the taste was just Ok.
Portion was good, but I don't think worth the price. Wanted to try lasagna, but probably not going again.
I'll give it 3 overall."}
{"text":"Good food

Nice owners. Friendly and personable. 

Tiny place. Only 5 counter seats. Take and go

Veal. Saucy. Cheese (provolne) $8.50

Closed weekends

Moving to new location early 2017. Pharmacy ave near audi dealership down the road"}
{"text":"Hidden gem. Tucked in a strip plaza at the southeast corner of Sheppard and Pharmacy, this yummmmmmmmy VEAL sandwiches that can definitely stand against the big famous ones in the city (ie. California Sandwiches). California Sandwiches is awesome but this one.... cheaper, almost the same taste, and best of all... near my workplace. LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE."}
{"text":"Tried the veal sandwich when it was still located at Pharmacy and Sheppard. Since then the place has moved to Consumers road. New location is still convenient to get too. Street parking is available. Sandwich is tasty and a good portion, but i felt that the veal was a bit too thin and not enough slices in the sandwich. In comparison to California sandwiches i would rather go there to get my sandwich. Also the hours of operation are mainly for a lunch time crowd. 
Would give this a higher rating if it was opened for dinners as well and if they put more meat to bun ratio."}
{"text":"Location/Service
- restaurant has now moved to ground floor of a new parking lot structure by 251 consumers rd
- perfect for customers working nearby the office buildings, parking might be a little tricky
- high ceilings bright lightning with limited seatings (around 16-20 people)
- friendly staff, fast with service
- mostly a take-out kind of place

Food
- tried their classic Veal Sandwich, which you can choose how much sauce you like. And it's how much the staff will dip the veal into the sauce
- I chose full sauce thinking the veal would be dry. Surprisingly, it's not! Cooked to the right level where it's soft and easy to chew. Thinly sliced but massive size
- also liked the bread, crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. Nothing like a hard bread/baguette
- sandwich itself is around $7.50, so it's a pretty good grab for lunch 
- definitely want to try their meatball or eggplant sandwich next time
- also serves pizza and salad/soup"}
{"text":"Best veal sangwich, period.  They make it fresh in front of you then dunk it in their delicious sauce. The bun is perfect, never gets soggy, and the hot peppers are out of this world.  The owners are super friendly and appreciative of your business.  This place does it right.  Damn,I miss this place."}
{"text":"First time trying this place today. I ordered a chicken cutlet sandwich with cheese. It was fresh & tasty. Service was friendly & the place was very clean. Will definitely be back to try other items on their menu!"}
{"text":"How to have an awesomely delicious, hearty lunch:

Step 1 - start with a solid sandwich (veal or eggplant are wise choices) and add homemade sauce. A little a lot or on the side if you want a neater sandwich. A huge sandwich, a steal at $6.45.

Step 2 -  customize your sandwich and add delicious toppings like caramelized onions ($0.75), cheese ($1.10) and for a little heat ask for some chili oil and or hot peppers.

Step 3 - Grab a drink have a seat in one of the outside tables under the shade of the trees and enjoy!

The owners are great and treat you like old friends. This is only our second time here but they remembered us and even details of our previous conversation. Excellent customer service and BIG sandwiches at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Primo Veal does an A-M-A-Z-I-N-G *MEATBALL* on Wednesdays O N L Y.

{"text":"Not a review on food.

I came at 6:30pm ish tonight. They close at 7:00pm. The flashing sign that says 'open' was on. I tried the door. Multiple times. Locked. No one inside. Lights were all on though. Not sure what was going on, but for future reference, call before coming just to make sure you can get in.

Also difficult to spot this place. It's on the side of the plaza, and the parking on that side is either awkward or illegal (or both...)"}
{"text":"This was my first time here but so far so good! I had the veal sandwich and although I'm generally not the biggest fan of veal sandwiches, I thought it was pretty tasty and pretty good size too. I will definitely go back to try their other sandwiches."}
{"text":"I came here after doing a search for cheap eats on yelp.  This place popped up and I was not disappointed.  I ordered the veal sandwich with mushroom toppings ($0.75 extra).  Adding cheese was $1.10.  He gave me 3 veal meats in mine because his veals are typically smaller than other restaurants.
 
This place is in a small area with very few seating.  But the owner of the place, Mike, is very friendly.  We chatted for a bit and he informed us that he is moving to a new location, reopening in early December 2017.  The new location will be a full restaurant with more food options."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The owners are very sweet and friendly and the veal sandwich is simply delicious. I got it dipped, with cheese and spicy peppers. Be warned the peppers are really hot! If I'm ever in Toronto again I'll be back here :)"}
{"text":"Forget about those places serving frozen veal cutlets that have been pre-cooked, placed in a warming table all day, and then garnished with some cheap canned product.  

This the BEST veal on a bun I've had in a very long time. All the ingredients are freshly prepared, including the toppings. Every sandwich is cooked fresh and made to order while you wait. There's a small charge for mushrooms, hot peppers, and cheese but they are VERY generous with the portions. You definitely get more than your money's worth. As another reviewer noted definitely have your veal dipped in the homemade tomato sauce. It's messy but oh so good! Service is very friendly, establishment clean. If you have a serious hunger this will put a smile on your face. A+"}
{"text":"I have had Primo Veal bookmarked for months and have been wanting to try this place as I love a good Italian style sandwich... unfortunately, I left somewhat disappointed. 

First-off, the parking was awful. I circled around the building trying to find parking and eventually decided to park on the street. I am guessing the target customers are those who work in the buildings or students around that area.

I also noticed that the price of the sandwiches have gone up... I should have realized some of the Yelp menu photos are a bit dated; nonetheless, I was there and decided to go through with ordering my sandwich.

I got an eggplant sandwich. When asked whether I wanted less saucy or more saucy, I asked the lady which is better and she said \"more saucy\" and I trusted her judgment. It was only a max 5 minutes wait for my eggplant sandwich to be made, but then again, it wasn't super busy. 

The restaurant is pretty clean so I have no complaints on this front. 

When I finally got my sandwich, I was super excited to shove my face with tomato sauce, breaded eggplant, and cheese!!! What was disappointing was the fact that cheese was missing... or were the sprinkled parmesan cheese it?! The breading in the eggplant was a bit thick and lacked flavour. Honestly, the best part was probably the tomato sauce and I was glad I got it saucy but I probably should have asked for it on the side so I could dip the sandwich in the saucy as I eat... it needed A LOT of sauce. Overall, the sandwich was somewhat disappointing as I have had an Italian eggplant sandwich elsewhere that tasted MUCCCH better than what I got at Primo Veal.

Needless to say, I removed the bookmark in this place and decided that I would not be returning... especially since parking is so awful."}
{"text":"4 words. Delicious.Huge.Cheap.Homemade.
Friendly Italian couple who owns this place. Better than California sandwiches for sure. Make sure you dip the veal in the sauce and add the cheese after. The also have pasta selections and offer catering."}
{"text":"UUPPPPDATE! I went into the actual store today. It's not hard to spot, very Italian-ey. It's very small inside, there's some seating by the window but I would suggest take out.

THE ONLY TAKE CASH!!!!. no CC, debit, travelers cheques, sexual services, etc.

THE HOT PEPPERS ARE EXTREMELY HOT. I got them. I also almost died and had to take them all off the samich AND it was still too hot (cuz of le juices)

Very nice staff - a lady and a man, friendly, cheerful, quick and not stingy :) Toppings cost around 50 to 75 cents, that's why the sandwich itself if so cheap i guess! With all the add ons it kind of rolls up to like 8-9 bucks.


I tried the steak today too - yuuuummmt!!! They grill it and put BBQ sauce on it and its so soooft and chewy. Im way too excited about this place can you tell...?"}
{"text":"The veal sandwich was good but was a little pricy for a sandwich. Additional toppings also requires additional cost. Tasty sandwich and friendly customer service though."}
{"text":"The veal sandwich was absolutely delicious. However it's super heavy and will put you to sleep.
10/10 would do it again, just not during lunch at work."}
{"text":"I never write reviews but Primo Veal is fantastic.  I've lived in the area for nearly 15 years but I didn't even realize Primo Veal was a resturant.  The veal sandwich is fantastic and so is the penne.  The sauce is everything a pasta sauce should be."}
{"text":"Huge sandwich, lots of meat, tasty sauce, friendly owner.  This is a small place for take out but if u want to sit in there are 3 seats.  Value versus food was excellent.  I ordered a veal sandwich take out and when I got into the car and started munching away at my sandwich, my friend was like WHOA the sandwich is HUGE!  A hidden gem, it's on the side of a plaza, so it won't catch your eye, after you park u need to walk to the right side of the building.  Definitely worth a try!  Debit & credit there's an extra charge of $0.50, so just pay cash ^_^"}
{"text":"I'd driven past this place on numerous occasions but for some reason never stopped in before.  Finally got around to it on a Wednesday, which has a meatball samich on special.
So, ya meatball samich and greek salad it is.  First, the meatballs are huge and awesome and the hot peppers, wow.  Bun was so fresh, soft and goood.  Greek salad was a good size for a side and everything fresh and tasty.   Place is tiny and has a real homey feel... and of course it just smells so awesome."}
{"text":"Excellent veal sandwiches! Cooked fresh while you wait or, if you call ahead, while you're on route for pick up. There's no space to eat in. Address is Sheppard, but the store front faces Pharmacy. Park in the strip mall on the south-east corner of Sheppard & Pharmacy and walk around the corner."}
{"text":"This place is really good. After reading Yelp reviews on where to find Toronto's best veal sandwiches, we headed off on a cold and snowy winter's day to Scarborough in a state of insatiable hunger and placed an order for two veal sandwiches. The sandwiches were as big as my head -- dipped in tomato sauce and loaded with cheese and mushrooms. We chowed down in a state of total bliss. If you're in the area and are craving a good veal sandwich, you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Reliably good veal sandwiches, can't go wrong. Veal is fried and you must have it dipped in the tomato sauce to get the full experience."}
{"text":"Messy...but delicious.

It's a little hard to find because the restaurant isn't visible from the street. However I look for the flower shop thats pretty much directly blocking the view of this restaurant.

The owners...nice, friendly and sociable. Treated each customer like close friends. I was foolish enough to think that a veal sandwich needs every topping available, but I'm glad I just got the cheese, spicy jalapeno and peppers with the veal dipped into the sauce because this sandwich is huge. This could easily feed another person or put someone into a food coma if they dare to finish one. It's messy and I don't think you can eat a veal sandwich without it being everywhere. For the price, quality, and food it definitely gets a 5/5"}
{"text":"Great veal sandwich. Owners are very friendly. 

Cash only, not a ton of seating in the shop."}
{"text":"Be aware they have moved to a new location! Went to the old location, and then Googled to find new location. Well worth the effort. Had a very nice veal cutlet sandwich and added cheese. Great sandwich. Quality veal and roll. Just opened a few days ago but I can tell they are headed for great things. Just visiting the area, otherwise I would be a regular. Nice people too."}
{"text":"I asked for onions, they didn't put it in the order. I paid extra for cheese and they didn't put it in my sandwich."}
{"text":"Just plain delicious. Sandwich is just too big. Haha. Always made to order which is what I love. And I appreciate the confidence of the owner about his food."}
{"text":"I don't work around anywhere that I know of that has a good veal sandwich, so I came to Yelpland to figure out how to satisfy my veal craving...and I was not let down! 
Small place with some outdoor seating which I took advantage of on an unusually warm October day. I got the veal sandwich (of course) and it was FABULOUS. 
Made fresh to order, instead of scooping a soggy veal out of a tub that's been sitting for hours...the veal itself was a huge portion with no stringy or tough parts, the edges were beautifully crispy..geez just writing this review is getting my mouth watering with the memory of this awesome sandwich. The bun was soft and fresh as well, and to top it off, they had Cherry Dr. Pepper! I never see that. Anyway. I will definitely be back, this is now my new 'fave' veal place. YUMMO!"}
{"text":"Visited recently. This is a small family owned eatery. The gentleman serving the food appeared to be the owner and was proud of his \"hole in the wall\" shop.  I ordered the veal sandwich combo with a soft drink and side pasta. My brother ordered the chicken sandwich combo with a soft drink and side salad. 

We were two hungry men and left more than satisfied. The sandwich alone is very filling and likely a good option if you're trying this place out. The pasta on the side was plentiful and very tasty.

Bottom line:
Great food. Friendly staff. Cheap/reasonable pricing."}
{"text":"Upon receiving a \"sandwich\" Yelp! email I discovered this location was just around the corner from my office. I decided to go for lunch and pick up a veal sandwich and ordered it with provolone cheese and grilled onions.

The veal itself was very good but the bun was so/so. The negative for me was that the cheese was too thin for my liking - you get thicker slices at Mr Sub/Subway (ouch!).

Pourquoi 2 étoiles?

Walked in and was asked by the male (cook) what I wanted and I stated my order. He then proceeded to put the veal to cook while the woman at cash was finishing with a couple. She then proceeded to get the bun and cheese ready. No hand washing. She then provided me the total and I paid - cash (they charge extra for CC and Debit). Again without washing she proceeded to go through the bread bag/cheese for future orders and once my order was ready used her hand to hold my bread and cut it.

Sorry - but it is one thing to have a great product and open up a little \"mom and pop\" restaurant like this, but you are in the business of preparing and serving food to the public. Clearly some food handling (re)certification is needed. I am not going to get sick thanks to not washing your hands after touching dirty money.  Whenever the same person is dealing with cash and food prep I watch them like a hawk - most places like Mr Sub will use gloves (over washing).  

As such my first and only - AVOID."}
{"text":"Primo : Exceptionally good of its kind; first-class

Primo Veal's Veal Sandwich ($5.95) is one of the best or even the best veal sandwich in the Scarborough area.

Here the veal is made to order fresh! Not like other places I have been to sitting for hours under the heated lamp!

Tender, Moist and Oh so delicious! 

Eating can be messy! Sauce can be splashed everywhere! 

Friendly staff warned me about the chili oil, but I love spicy and hot!

Writing this review is making me hungry for one of those.... NOW!"}
{"text":"What a wonderful place to eat sandwiches...!
It is Italian but North American style.You can't eat veal sandwich at ban in Italy.

Secret of taste is tomatoes sauce...!
Owners of business(Mike) is learned to prepare sauce from grand mother and brings to your taste.He is very generous man,He loves his business and wants to stay on this way.

If you're first time there,you have to eat Veal sandwich after that I am sure you will be there again.Second time you can order(discover) other things too...!

P.s.Do not forget to drink espresso."}
{"text":"The best Veal Sandwich one can get in Scarberia. Habbit forming I cannot stop going there again and again. ...add Hot Pepper to your topping, onions, sauce, cheese would harmonize with it..."}
{"text":"Amazing veal sandwiches. What can I say? I'm in heaven each time. Their sandwhcihes are made with love and are amazing. Get all the topping can't be without them amazing"}
