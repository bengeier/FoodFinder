{"text":"WARNING!!! JUST STOP!! ARRETE! Throw your 60$ from the groupon away asap- or get refunded if its not too late. But TRUST ME it is better to waste that 60$ on the garbage than go here. I'm not exaggerating. My friend bought this groupon and invited me. This place is run by THIEVES. SNAKES. I don't know how they can live with themselves. They must cry in bed every night. All the negative reviews you read are true. Man, I'm not even going to get into what a financial rip-off it is (they charge illegal taxes and pocket the cash) (I have filed a claim at the Better Business Bureau already). They force you to buy 20$ drinks. We were forced to pay 100$ for 2 drinks each. That was our bill. Conniving. They wont even look at you in the eyes. I am just appaled and insulted by the disgusting food and the thieving vibe of the staff. I didn't eat anything on my plates. Every bite was so filthy disgusting, I can't even describe. My friend's plate, the duck, was so gross I almost threw up on the table and I can't even continue to explain how nasty, small, soggy, processed, pasty this food was. I wouldn't feed it to a dog. Not even a racist dog. We got a reso for 6:30 (pretty early) and I bet they didn't expect the guests to use the bathroom so early cause when my friend walked by the kitchen, there were rows and rows of pre-made plates. When I went by, 20 minutes later, they were hidden, and there was only one guy in the kitchen, doing, well, NOTHING. I can't believe anybody could fall for this. The decent reviews NEED to be friends or people that these snakes paid to fill in. It is impossible to find ANYTHING good about this place. Man, it looks like it's about to shut-down any second, like a trashy discotheque slash old man sports bar. The bartender (\"The best bartender in the world for the past 3 years\" - YES - the owner actually said that!) was soooo sloppy and the drinks were gross, I could've made better drinks when I was 3, with maybe a quarter ounce of booze in them, oh yeah- at like 18$ each, oh yeah, and forced on you. The woman and her underage daughter next to me told the bartender she wasn't going to have one and he said \"you 16? no problem.\" and she insisted that she didn't drink, he tried forcing it on a child! Finally she settled with a semi-virgin one. So strange. When my friend asked for a caesar, the bartender dumped a half bottle of tabasco into a cup with a drizzle of vodka and some clamato. Yep. Also, I feel sick. Like, I'm-gonna-throw-up-from-unclean-food-sick. If you are a tourist, the wine bar, Accords, directly across the street has fantastic food with an amazing wine list. Just go there. Or even to l'Assommoir, next door. Please don't hurt yourself like we did."}
{"text":"This was stop 2 of three on a night of trying multiple restaurants. We had pre-set menus giving us enough time to hop in, get a drink, and dine within 1.5 hours (plenty of time to enjoy a restaurant for the food).   Fibo was disappointing. The meal seemed less molecular and more eclectic than anything.  We had a bit of a taster menu, all of which sounded great coming out as words, but were boring once on your own tongue.  Wings de Drole BBQ - Duck wings with 'red hot chili pepper' sauce. I'm a big fan of duck, but this was dried out and super tough. The spicy chili sauce was amassed in a pool at the bottom of the stack wings making it impossible to dip to taste until all the wings were taken off the plate. by the time i got to taste it, i found out it was a weaker version of Frank's Red Hot.  Champignons Magique - Sauteed mushrooms on a bed of fluffed rice flavoured with coffee and lavender. One of the better dishes that was offered. The mushrooms were cooked well, and the rice was interesting in texture and flavour.   Ceviche de crevettes Suspendue -  While i understood the concept, i think the execution was poor. The shrimp are meant to be suspended in the ceviche mixture which is in a gelatinous form, but instead it was shrimp covered in lemon-slime with the occasional cube of lemon jelly. It tasted decent, but a bit too sweet & 0 spice.  Nachos et popcorn reinvente - Nachos should have cheese, or at least the chips should be made of corn. There were a few decorative corn filaments (but these were readily available on almost all the dishes for presentation) and the chips were plantains and other 'exotic' vegetables. I can buy a bag of these chips at alot of grocery stores in the city, what makes these special? the wasabi guacamole is OK but again unimaginative and the salsa tastes like regular salsa.  Our drinks were either overly salty (margaritas), overly spiced (Caesars), and the head on our beer was frozen. i know this is likely for the sake of \"molecular\" but a beer is a beer. no need to freeze it, it doesn't enhance the experience in any way. and if you're going to use chemicals to make the margaritas, why not tell people and let them watch? that's supposed to be part of the experience.  i think this place could be good if paid more attention to flavour, and service. People think of molecular gastronomy and want to be wowed. people have big expectations for this type of food, and are setting themselves up for disappointment at Fibo."}
{"text":"Bouffe ultra-dégeux pour le prix exorbitant. Ce n'est pas de la vrai cuisine moléculaire et en plus le serveur connaissait rien du menu lorsqu'on lui demandait c'était quoi. Alerte au foie gras qui goutait le chien mort et Dieu sait comment j'adore le foie gras. Quel gachi et vol !!"}
{"text":"This restaurant piqued my interest because it takes a \"molecular gastonomical\" approach to cuisine.  It was, however, a disappointment in more ways than one.  While the cocktails were fun to look at (many of them use liquid nitrogen), they were pretty terrible to sip, and at 15$ a glass, it doesn't come cheap. The food was definitely a let-down, since most of it was over-seasoned and the portion sizes were very small.  The salads were too sweet, the kobe beef was WELL DONE and slightly TOUGH (really, kobe beef??), the seasoning to some of the vegetables and the beef had too much raw garlic (ew!), and none of my table mates enjoyed his or her food.  The only flavourful plate was the risotto, which tasted great but was undercooked and felt quite grainy, if not crunchy.  The worst item on the menu had to have been the chocolate cake, which was supposed to be a lava cake, but had had absolutely no lava and had a slight taste of baking soda and table salt.   If you're interested in trying \"molecular\" food, go elsewhere, perhaps another city like Chicago, which does it right."}
{"text":"An interesting dining experience. They put in a cute show with all the liquid nitrogen and foams, but at the end of the day, they make a good meal. I really enjoyed my lamb shank main plate. My wife really liked her smoked duck. However the oysters were a disappointment, not much there.   As others have said, it's 3 floors up a narrow flight of stairs (definitely not handicap accessible). If you have more than a few drinks, it would probably be sketchy going back down."}
{"text":"My wife and I received as a gift, a coupon for a pre-set tasting meal and although we weren't sure what to expect after reading some of the reviews on Yelp, we still plodded ahead with an open mind and spirit.  As others have said, be prepared for a walk up three flights of stairs in almost total darkness, except for some pin points of light. Actually walking up the stairs, the lighting reminded me of the type of lights you see in clubs on the dance floors.  When we walked in, there was one other couple in the restaurant, we could only get reservations for 6pm. On a side note, I never eat at 6pm. 6pm is time for having drinks before dinner and snacking, definitely not dinner; but I digress. Someone came over told us we could sit anywhere we wanted as long it was a table for two.  After a few minutes, a waiter came over (Frederic) and he began to explain the concept of the menu and about the type of drink creations the bartender had created. We were told when we were ready, we should make ourselves at home and go up to the bar to watch our drinks being made. My wife ordered a Lychee Martini that looked very nice while being made and was interesting for the way the \"lychee\" of the drink was replaced with a gelatin cranberry. However, at the end of the day it tasted like a lychee martini. I ordered an Upside down Gin and Tonic. It was essentially a gin and tonic, that when it was done being made, could literally be drank upside down. Well at first it could, until the ice roof started to melt, then it would become a mess. However, like the martini, at the end of the day, it was still just a gin and tonic.  When we got back to the table, we placed our order. My wife had the sweet potato and beef cheek poutine and I had the foie-gras poilé (5$ supplement). The poutine was actually quite good and for an entree the portion was quite large. I could not say the same thing for my foie gras. 2 little pieces of foie-gras with a balsamic mousse in the middle. It was good, but nothing to write home about. I have had plenty of foie-gras poilé in my time and this did not crack my top 20.  For the main course, my wife ordered monkfish and I ordered the leg of lamb. Once again, my wife's dish wasn't bad and was nicely portioned. And like my entrée, the lamb shank although it smelled very nice of curry and looked very good, it wasn't all that large. I think there was more bone than anything else. The purée could have used a little more seasoning, but I guess that is a personal preference than anything else.  For deserts we each ordered the Channel No. 5 crème brûlée. It smelled and tasted exactly like it sounded. It was like eating a crème brûlée that tasted of a woman's perfume. Now that may sound bad, but actually it might have been the best part of the meal, at least in my opinion.  All in all, it was an interesting experience. Would I do it again? Probably not at the prices they charge. Even though we had a half off coupon, it still was quite an expensive night at 152$ tax and tip."}
{"text":"Avoid, avoid, avoid!  I was there with my boyfriend last week hoping to have a different experience.  Different it was!  After climbing dimly lit stairs for what seemed forever (3 levels), we arrived in an equally dimly lit and cold dining room, not exactly sure that we hadn't used the service entrance by mistake. After an embarrassing moment, one waiter welcomed us, then another, then a hyperactive and febrile dandy presenting himself to us as the manager.  The food was unimaginative, bordering on the mediocre. I am sorry, but exotic ingredients won't save half-baked ideas, particularly if execution leaves to be desired (I had the lamb shank: it was undercooked and tough). Because of the low light, everything was difficult to discern. I couldn't say exactly what I was putting to my mouth and taste really didn't help.  Without regard for the conversation we were having, for each one of the plates we were brought, a never-ending litany of pretentious details was forced on us. It was quite redundant (I can read the menu) and bordering on ridicule, the food getting cold all the while.  Although our assigned waiter was, despite his young age, very pleasant, enthusiastic but discreet, the so-called manager kept bugging us (3 times !) to tell him how the food was. This guy needs to take a cold shower before coming to work, or maybe not come at all: he's downright annoying!  We decided to leave right after the main course and had ice cream at home to soothe our bruised wallet (hype doesn't come cheap, apparently).  Don't go! This restaurant is very obviously playing on the novelty and has really nothing to offer."}
{"text":"Je suis très surpris de voir une note aussi basse pour un restaurant si fantastique !   Il faut se présenter au fibo avec une idée en tête : Oublier les norme et les standard et ce laisser tomber dans une experience gastronomique unique !  Evidemment , les plats qui vous seront présenté seront surprenant, mais dites vous que c'est le but premier de ce resto !   Il est aussi très important d'écouter les directive des serveurs, certain plats se mange dans un ordre precis, il faut le respecter !  Finalement, il est interdit selon moi d'aller au fibo sans prendre un verre ! Commander un gin tonic à ce restaurant c'est un show !!"}
{"text":"The food was good. The menu was different than the one shown in the website groupon (no snails ). Overall, the fish dishes, the soup, the couscous and dessert were tasty. We made ice cream out of whipped cheesecake.  Expensive, but I had a groupon coupon. The service was good. I would rate it 3.5 , it is not a restaurant that I would go often. I went there for the experience."}
{"text":"Peut être suis-je chanceux, mais mon expérience chez Fibo fut particulièrement positive.  Premièrement l'endroit. Mixte entre un loft et un restaurant, l'endroit fut pour moi particulièrement acceuillant. Décor sobre et épuré, un bar au fond interessant, la place est jolie.  Secondo, le service. J'ai rarement été aussi bien acceuilli dans un restaurant. Le serveur a pris le temps de nous expliquer le menu et les technique utilisés pour chacun des plats. Ensuite on nous a proposer de passé au bar, ou l'on nous a démontrer quelques techniques (sphérification, surgélation,gélification) et l'on nous fais aussi participer à la création de notre drink.  Le chef est même venu nous voir et donné quelques trucs. Néophyte dans ce type de cuisine, on m'a bien conseillé pour réussir les techniques à la maison.  Nous étions en mode échange avec tout le personnel de l'endroit qui prenait plaisir èa nous expliquer les comments et pourquoi de chacune des techniques. Sans non plus trop s'immiscer dans nos conversation. Il y a avait un bon équilibre.   Enfin, la nourriture. Un restaurant peut avoir le meilleur service du monde, la plus belle ambiance mais si c'est pas bon... ça veut rien dire. Même chose pour les techniques. Je crois que peu importe la technique, le plus important est l'impression laissée en bouche.  Nous profitions d'une offre Groupon, alors nous avions droit a un repas 3 services.  Nous avons quand même essayer un drink au bar qui était assez interessant. J'en oublie le nom, mais c'était bon.  La soupe du jour, mais je n'ai pu m'empêcher de goûter les ailes de poulet qui sont en fait des pilons de canards dans une sauce mole-bbq. Je n'ai jamais goûté un mole que j'aime mais le leur m'a fait changé d'idée. Les pilons n'étaient pas secs  et la sauce goûteuse. En plat principal, j'ai essayer le risotto. Le riz était parfaitement cuite et onctueux mais l'assiette était moins bien balancée. Le goût de la tomate dominait l'ensemble du plat y donnant, à mon avis une trop grand acidité. Pas désagréable du tout, mais le plat pourrait être retravaillé.  Le jarret d'agneau de ma convive était cependant excellent. Comme déssert, je me suis laissé tenté par le séduction au chocolat, qui était très bien. Le sucre pétillant y ajoutait une texture intéressante.   En conclusion, j'ai adoré mon expérience et finalement je crois que c'est ce qui compte. Cependant, le challenge du Fibo sera de faire une cuisine intéressante respectant leur concept, tout en étant accessible. Les ingrédients et techniques utilisés sont coûteuses et il est raisonnable de se demandé si l'extra en vaut la peine."}
{"text":"Their upside down gin and tonic tasted like rubbing alcohol mixed with flat Sprite and a dash of formaldehyde. Blech vomit dégueulasse ! Be afraid, be very very afraid. When I hear the words \"molecular gastronomy\" I instantly think of the chef extraordinaire himself, Ferran Adrià, and his Mecca of inspired post-modern haute cuisine, \"elBulli\" on Catalonia's Costa Brava. But ... Fibo oy yoy yoy... this is sooooo not that. Seriously, folks, flashy dry ice magic and some spherification of juices does not .... molecular gastronomy make. Beware the evil that lurks in the dark shadows and in the little minds of those men with shit eating grins. They will rob you blind. Trust no man for he will disappoint you with his shitty \"concept\" cocktails and piss in your eye with his molecular gastronomic bullshit and lies. Vomit. Vomit first then run. Something wicked this way blows ... and it really really blows and not in a good way. Don't go here. Run, run away now. It really really really really really really really really really sucks ... and again, no, not in a good way. It is superbly horrible. I cannot emphasise to you enough how shitty this shitty place is. I will gladly pay out the wazoo for good food and drink. I make it rain, baby, but I'm never paying 15$ for a gin and tonic again unless I get insurance on it ... or taste it first. I don't care about your shitty gimmicks, I don't care if I can drink it upside down. I'll drink you upside down. I don't know what that means but whatevs. No, no, sireebob, do not waste your limited time and hard earned dollars on this horrid scam of a place. Life is too short. Avoid at all costs. Save yourself. You are most welcome."}
{"text":"Concept vraiment original de cuisine moléculaire Ça vaut le coup d'essayer une fois pour voir et goûter, car plus qu'un resto, c'est toute une soirée et tout un spectacle! A votre arrivée, on vous suggère d'aller au bar voir comment se préparent les cocktails moléculaires; le barman est vraiment bon et dynamique, il offre un spectacle vraiment extraordinaire et envoûtant! D'ailleurs, ça peut créer des liens entre toutes les personnes qui sont au bar et sourient devant le spectacle Les cocktails sont vraiment bons et pour le moins originaux! La bouffe était correcte mais pas \"si moléculaire\" que ça, nous étions un peu déçus. Il y avait juste un nuage de mousse et un truc qui crépitait en bouche. Ce n'était pas exceptionnel niveau bouffe et surtout au niveau de la quantité, c'était assez décevant. Nous avions encore faim après entrée, plat et dessert, tellement les portions étaient petites... Au niveau du prix, c'est aussi décevant car les prix sont vraiment exhorbitants (comptez minimum 80$ par personne, voir 150 si vous voulez boire un cocktail ou boire à table). Il y a la possibilité de prendre des groupons, mais ça reste cher quand même A essayer pour une occasion, une fois"}
{"text":"Very strange experience. I don't know why the restaurant offers groupons if they are so obviously unhappy when people with vouchers show up.   We had been walking behind a couple smoking a joint as we made our way to the resto from the metro. First, we waited 5 minutes before being seated in quite an empty restaurant. Then, it took about 20 minutes for the waiter to bring us water and answer our questions. It was very frustrating sitting there, watching him walk by us and tending to people that had shown up approx. 10 minutes after us before serving us. The waiter really tried pushing drinks on us (several times, and we said no thanks more than once), only for him to say, \"so, just the pot, then?\". It took me a few minutes to understand what he had meant by this comment. By this point, I was extremely anxious and uncomfortable. The music was extremely loud electronic/techno music, which did not create a calming or comfortable ambiance. This, combined with the neglect and sense of the waiter being a salesman as he continuously tried to push us to buy drinks made the experience quite negative.   The food was alright. Overpriced for what we paid (which was about half off from the regular prices). The food was also almost cold by the time it got to us. It took us 2h10m to get served apps, entrees and dessert. We continuously had to seek out the attention of the waiter, which sometimes meant shouting over the loud music.   We got the bill and had to pay the taxes and well as tip, and the tip had already been included in the price. I  am uncertain if they do this to everyone, or if it was a move by the waiter to ensure a minimum 15% tip. He certainly did not deserve it.   I feel as though my boyfriend and I were judged by the waiter upon arrival and were treated according to the prejudice of the waiter. I suppose we did not fit the image of clientele they desired. Their actions ensured that we will never visit again. I do not often write reviews of restaurants, but my experience was so astoundingly anxiety-inducing that I would like to share it with others, so that they do not experience the same thing. Happy Valentines day..."}
{"text":"Not my kind of place. Raw shrimp, and foam on everything. And the walk down 3 flights in the dark is dangerous. ext time I see a dining place described as \"a gastronomic delight\" I will run away"}
{"text":"Un des meilleurs restaurants auquel j'ai mangé! Wow ! Restaurant avec une décoration underground mais rustique, chic et décontracté à la fois . Le personnel qui y travaille est fantastique ! Gentil , courtois, drôle, imaginatif et conseil tres bien les clients. De plus , service qui correspond à la vitesse que nous avions désirez ( pas trop rapide et pas trop long ). Atmosphère intime mais chaleureuse. Et que dire de la Nourriture!! OMG une explosion de saveur dans chaque gorgée de cocktails où chaque bouchées des différents plats. Présentation soignée et originale sans oublier la multitude de goûts et de texture présente dans chacun des services. Un des meilleurs Restos de Montreal je le Conseille fortement ! :)"}
{"text":"So we came in with a groupon ticket.  The menu was interesting, but when i got my poutine, it was a mess, water sauce that taste nothing, 3 tiny piece of cheese big like have a penny. Some sort of mouse that taste only like salt.  My girlfriend got the Cesar salad, it taste like something you could of made yourself at casa grec in the salad bar, cold tasteless and lack of flavor. The main course was a chewy duck that was a 4 bites plate. the desert was 2 spoon of chocolate in a hard crust. The service was horrible, the waiter was sitting at a table having a drink with 2 girls and completely ignoring us. On top of it they charge us a full 20 % tip (included in the meal) we had to wait over half an hour to get are plates off the table and get my  bill. The restaurant was empty. I really dislike my experience, when we left the chef was pushing us  down the stairs with his bike in his hands.  Overall food sucked, service sucked more. the 2 employees where the owners, so it gave me an glimpse of what the general idea is..."}
{"text":"J'y suis allé peu après son ouverture, et à voir les critiques qu'ils ont même 1 an après, je me donne le loisir de donner mon opinion.   Ayant débuté un blogue sur la cuisine moléculaire il y a environ 2 ans, ce sujet me tiens d'autant plus à cur, pour ne pas dire m'offusque. Considérant mon champ d'études en chimie des aliments et les bases que j'avais acquises lors de mes expérimentations en cuisine moléculaire, je me présentais au Fibo avec excitation et enthousiasme. Eh bien ! Commençons par le service et l'ambiance, et terminons avec le sundae...la bouffe.   Service - poli, souriant, serviable! Bref, le service était très bon...du moins jusqu'à ce qu'on pose des questions sur le menu. Tout le monde a le droit d'oublier des détails, des informations, c'est la nature humaine et je trouve ça bien correct. Mais lorsque le serveur à de la difficulté à savoir ce qui est au menu et à décrire les plats, c'est vraiment décevant. L'agar, l'alginate, la xanthane, et tous les termes de la cuisine moléculaire peuvent porter à confusion lorsqu'on n'est pas habitué ou qu'on débute, mais ce n'est pas une raison pour n'avoir aucune idée de leur utilité. Ce dont je me suis rendu compte, c'est qu'ils donnaient des informations erronées aux clients. Mon acolyte (aussi chimiste alimentaire) et moi trouvions cela inapproprié d'informer les gens ainsi.   Ambiance - très beau décor, moderne, invitant, et classe! Il fait un peu sombre, mais rien de dramatique. Il est juste dommage que l'on ne puisse voir la nourriture qu'on nous sert.   Bouffe - là ça se gâte ! Vous trouverez peut-être que je suis sévère, mais je parle en tant que gars qui pratique la cuisine moléculaire dans ces temps libres. La nourriture était médiocre, et à voir les critiques récentes, elle ne semble pas s'être améliorée. À notre visite, un cocktail morveux à la xanthane dosée à la saupoudreuse à sucre (une concentration de plus de 1% donne une solution visqueuse/morveuse), de l'azote liquide partout (vraiment intéressant, mais surutilisé), des kumquats et des fruits exotiques partout (plusieurs fruits comme la poire cactus revenais sur 3 plats), des cubes de gelée d'agar avec différentes textures (qui ne semblait pas être sur une base volontaire), un manque d'assaisonnement dans plusieurs plats (ailes de canard molle, buf Kobe, tataki), des espumas sans utilités (disposé comme une montagne de patate pilée dans l'assiette) et en trop grande quantité, et la disposition impropre à l'utilité d'un air de lécithine de soya (l'air est délicat et perd tout intérêt lorsqu'elle est écrasée sous un ceviche).  Parmi les points décevants, il y avait aussi: des items au menu jamais réussi en cuisine (à ne pas faire!), des agencements de saveurs douteux, et un prix élevé pour une exécution moindre.  Bref, je trouve tout cela vraiment dommage parce que le restaurant ne représente pas le potentiel de la cuisine moléculaire et lui donne une mauvaise réputation. Et personnellement, étant un fervent de celle-ci, ça m'attriste d'entendre des gens (amis et connaissances) me dire que la cuisine moléculaire ce n'est pas bon à cause de leur expérience au FIBO."}
{"text":"The single worst dining experience in Montreal that I've ever had. Period. I had very low expectations but it was even worse than I expected. Despite the terrible reviews on Yelp, I purchased a coupon that gave me a tasting menu for half the price and I still felt ripped off. I should have listened to Yelp darn it!  While the chef certainly has good intention on showcasing its different techniques, he seems to have forgotten that food must first of all have great flavors and be pleasureable. An oyster (way past its prime) with vodka, flowers and passion fruit? And topped with liquid nitrogen? Really? On top of that, the oyster was served along a salad with a dressing that was way too sweet. When the nitrogen was poured onto the plate, it also spilled onto the salad, dry freezing it in the process... I really don't get it!    I did not enjoy any of the 7 items that I tried: For a few of them, I even forced myself to eat them quickly because I wanted to leave as fast as possible. To top it all off, we were still starving after our meal and went to eat elsewhere after. Avoid at all cost!"}
{"text":"I never thought i would be so disappointed at a restaurant... My background in food chemistry got me highly intrigued with the concept of Fibo. Myself and a good friend of mine loves to experiment with molecular cuisine as it truly showcase the wonder of chemistry and interaction of food! however, Fibo unfortunately gives it a bad reputation with its very bad execution and poor knowledge of functional ingredient.  He puts xanthan gum in his drink! and at a scary level too! Working in the food industry, we work with 0.01% at a time! His limoncello drink was so gooey.  And with the coupons, we literally tried every single item on their menu. most of the descriptions were mysterious and had very exotic ingredients that were not necessarily compatible with the star of the dish.  A lot of times, what was described in the menu was not done on the dish. Example: marmirolle soufflé with kumquats, the cheese was not souffléed in any way and we asked the chef about it, he told us that he failed to do the technique of Francois chartier... but he did served it anyway without changing its name. I went at the opening of the restaurant 1 year ago and i search one year later for any improvement of them and... still very bad reviews... too bad, the concept could have been awesome."}
