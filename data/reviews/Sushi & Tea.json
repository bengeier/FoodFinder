{"text":"I try to drop by at least once a week,  Their sushi is  fresh and the couple who run the business are lovely people, very friendly.   You can eat there but it's  geared for take.  The prices are really good and there's plenty of variety.   The party platter is a great price and plenty of variety.
I also love their Bubble Tea."}
{"text":"Amazing selection and friendly staff! Their sushi is really reasonably priced and they have an amazing vegan selection. If you're looking for a swanky place to sit and dine, this may not be the place for you, but for take out or just some casual, delicious sushi, this place is awesome! I really hope they succeed here!"}
{"text":"Lots of sushi selection at a very cheap price.  Sashimi seemed very fresh and soft. Fast service, owner was nice."}
{"text":"We have ordered a few large trays of sushi from here and have never been disappointed.  

The sushi is fresh yet affordable..on average you can get a tray of 42 pc for $24. 

The restaurant is small with some tables. I think the focus of this place is takeout. 

Next time we are going to try some more interesting sushi from the menu"}
{"text":"Sashimi Don with 3 pieces sliced almost paper thin for $9. I wish I had taken a photo. Can't speak for rest of menue but for a personal size lunch item you're better off going to TNT to pick up take-out sushi. 

The staff and owner was friendly."}
{"text":"This place is great. The sushi is excellent. Fresh and delicious! And I know sushi!
The place is clean and cozy. The prices are Ok, affordable. They are fast and professional. I will continue to buy sushi from there. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"The quality of the sushi is nothing special than what you could pick up from another establishment but the price is cheap and the service is friendly. I've been here multiple times because it's easy to pick up a quick meal before they close."}
{"text":"Small and simple place but great sushi and sashimi. If you eat in, the owner is super nice and serves you at the table :) definitely worth a try"}
{"text":"Yet another gem, a family run establishment with a humble and gracious owner &  chef who graced us with extra pieces to try out. We found Sushi & Tea on Yelp, and is now going to be our only a-la-carte sushi spot. 

The location makes you think there's no way you can get the quality of Japanese food you'd get downtown or other places, and even when you walk in, you wouldn't think it - but this place has the most fresh, authentic, sushi you'll find in the city. 

The chef, Oscar, has been in the industry for 22 years and has worked with Japanese Iron Chef, so with that said, he does not let down whatsoever. 

We ordered the \"Firecracker\", \"Miami Roll\", and the \"Mango Tango\" maki rolls, side of miso soup, Avocado salad roll, Taro bubble tea, Mango bubble tea. 

THE FOOD:
To start, the miso soup was amazing, one of the best, if not the best miso soup we've had. 
The bubble tea was also unassumingly good, definiely up to par with the Taiwanese chain spots. 

The \"Avocado Salad Roll\", I dont know where else they have this, but this was incredible, no skimping on the avocado here, very impressive. They have other kinds as well We cant wait to try, especially the shrimp salad roll. 

The Mango Tango roll had real mango slices on top, I cant describe the feeling biting into this -  Mind blowing. 

The Miami Roll comes wrapped soy paper, and huge pieces, the SMOKED salmon and cream cheese just made this to die for. 

For the saucy fans, the Firecracker has all the fixings with eel and slapped with cheese and eel sauce on top, a nice BBQ taste, amazing. 

CONCLUSION:
Sushi & Tea was way better than we expected, it isn't a dine-in joint much, they do have 3 tables for up to groups of 4, but the establishment specializes in take-out and catering and is best to call in with your orders so you aren't waiting. On a side note - the party trays are the best bang for your buck and the variety is diverse!! 

There is even a little cooler with inexpensive bomb maki rolls and sashimi, made in-house, definitely will be grabbing from here to take to lunch next day. 

Don't waste your time elsewhere, you want crazy good sushi, come here, support the small guys with the top quality for less."}
{"text":"Ordered the monthly special with a sweet tofu roll. So-so....I guess you get what you pay for.
But nothing to complaint though. 
$21.99 for the 40 pieces tray and $2.95 for the Sweet tofu roll. Bang for the buck pricing.
And the owners are very friendly too."}
{"text":"Love this place. Recently moved to the area, went in expecting the worst, but the staff are super friendly, the sushi is very fresh and the prices are great. They have some great deals for party orders as well."}
{"text":"Quick and friendly service for great prices. Monthly special includes a party tray with 40 pieces for $21.99!"}
{"text":"Tried this place a while back. Friendly staff, good sushi, and surprisingly decent bubble tea. I hope people give it a try when they're in the mood for something fast and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Fresh made upon order. Gotta love discounted vege rolls too. They do pretty party trays too for crowd."}
{"text":"Dropped in to pick up a quick dinner.  Ordered some sushi and sashimi dinners to go and picked up some rice wrap combos from their refrigerator section.  

The owners were friendly and service was quick.  You get what you pay for.  The quality of the sushi was just a-ok.  Not something that I would pay any more money to eat anywhere.  The fish were the typical salmon, tuna and tilapia option.  The rolls were ok, too but I can't see myself craving their food and driving out of my way to go here again."}
{"text":"Great selection of sushi. Price was good and meal was quick and filling =) 
Will most definitely come back for more"}
{"text":"Cute little sushi restaurant nestled into Cliffcrest plaza.  Seems to be a family run operation.  Don't be fooled by the decor.  The sashimi was extremely fresh and had a hint of lemon essence to it.  The sushi rolls were also tasty, not overly salty or sugary from the mirin but just right."}
{"text":"Best take out sushi place ever! The owners are super friendly!  The sushi is fresher than most take out places"}
{"text":"We came here from looking at restaurants on Yelp near Scarborough Bluffs. It's a solid sushi take out joint for large quantities but that's it. I think this joint focuses on quantity over quality, similar to typical ayce style.The sushi description on the Special rolls seems a lot better than what comes out of it. Overall it was A-OK but the rolls are wrapped a bit loose and underwhelming. Maybe a better bet to stick to the classic tried and true here - california, black dragon etc (I wouldn't know haven't tried). Not mad at this place since it's not expensive but not excited either. After one roll, I was left a bit hungry and unsatisfied so I ordered another one to share. There are a few tables so you can eat in (which we did) or take out. 

Ordered 
Geisha Roll $9.99
(Soybean Sheet), Shrimp tempura, white tuna, crabmeat, avocado, cucumber, tobiko, japanese mayonaise, spicy teriyaki sauce on the side. 
- Listed as 6 pcs but they offered 10

Twin Salmon Roll $8.99
Salmon, avocado, green onion, japanese mayonaise, topped with smoked salmon, black sesame seed
- smoked salmon doesn't taste fresh seems like it's been in the freezer for a while
- 10 pcs

Eel Don $9.99
Little strips of Eel on a bed of rice looked kinda sad. It was so underwhelming that I forgot to take a pic of it. It seems like the cuts were made for sushi wrapping and they decided to just slap it on the rice and call it a day. I think they should consider charging a bit more and give a more generous helping."}
{"text":"Great selection of sushi! My favourite is the sashimi bowl! The owners are also very friendly so theres nothing to complain about. It is a very casual and more take out oriented place.

Have to add that the buble teas here are really good too!!! Not a lot of selection but definitely enough for fulfill that craving :)"}
{"text":"Tiny takeout, very tidy, spartan place.  The sushi chef, who I think is also the owner, was super friendly, and helped me to decide on a sushi tray, having never been there before.  Fantastic selection of combos and rolls, very decent prices.  The quality and presentation was outstanding.  No complaints whatsoever, I am definitely a return customer!"}
{"text":"Wonderful sushi! Lots of variety, absolutely delicious. Will definitely go back. Excellent service. 
OMG had it again tonight. SO good. My son requested it for his birthday dinner. Amazing quality, awesome salmon sushi. Mango tango is one of my favorites! Every time we are so impressed with the quality. Thank you Sushi & Tea!"}
