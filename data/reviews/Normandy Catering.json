{"text":"Normandy provided the catering for our wedding on 9/24/16.  They prepared all the food on site and it was cooked to perfection!!  The wedding guests raved about the food and stated it was the best food at a wedding they had ever had!!  Kathy is amazing at what she does and we couldn't have been more grateful for Normandy and their amazing staff!!"}
{"text":"Great food and people.  There is nothing they cannot prepare or cook to absolute perfection for 10 to 1000 people!   I have never had a bad taste of food from Normandy Catering.  I also highly recommend the Normandy Express for lunches and any outside events."}
{"text":"This place is not only for catering but it is a party center as well. I have been here for a New Years Eve party and for a wedding reception and both times the food was excellent, the staff friendly, and the decor wonderful. I would definitely recommend people check this place out if the opportunity ever arises!"}
