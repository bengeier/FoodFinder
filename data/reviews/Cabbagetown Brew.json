{"text":"I popped in here after walking past it a few times, and this cafe had a really nice, calming atmosphere. The patrons were relaxing on their laptops, so I'm sure that they have wi-fi, making it a great place to get some work done. I ordered a Colombian house drip, no milk, it wasn't bad. The best part of CB would have to be the friendly staff! Will definitely return again to try out their espresso soon."}
{"text":"Two words.  Hot. Nutella.  It's like hot chocolate only it's got a dollop of Nutella stirred into it, so when you're done you can spoon up the dregs on the inside of your cup for a hit of pure hazelnutty joy. (The friend I was with ordered a nutellacino, which he reported was delicious too.)

The place is done in shades of cool grey for a soothing, sophisticated backdrop to the amazing drinks.  The tall wing back chairs feel very embracing - I had underdressed for the weather, hence my stopping in for a hot drink, and it was so nice to just sit for a spell with a warm cup in a cozy chair. 

For the summer, the place offers gelato and milkshakes (a Nutella milkshake is on the menu, of course, as is a gelato sandwich on a croissant), as well as gorgeous looking pastries. The back entrance opens onto the laneway, so if you live nearby, you don't have to come all the way around to Parliament to get your morning coffee.  Definitely a place I'll be visiting again."}
{"text":"This caf√© is so cute. They make a killer chai latte and hot Nutella (just like hot chocolate but made with Nutella melted into hot milk) the owner is so friendly and pleasant and the space is beautiful."}
{"text":"Super relaxing, great drinks! I went there to study for my mid term and it has a very calming atmosphere. I also Can't wait to curl up with a good book and an americano

CB won't be a hidden gem for much longer!"}
{"text":"Nice guys. It seemed too good to be true. A cozy place in Cabbagetown, decent coffee. Pastries were from off site but good quality. Other food was unpredictable as far as availability. They try (tried?) to have creative coffees like ones with Nutella or orange. I just arrived there to find out that they are closed and it looks like some of the furniture has been moved out. They were never very busy. I would have thought this would have been a popular hangout but it never became one. Does anybody know if they are permanently closed for sure?"}
{"text":"The quality and variety of the hot beverages is awesome. The seating is unmatched. And the guys are pretty friendly too. I really like this place."}
{"text":"Nutellacino is very tasty! The Panino sandwiches are awesome and authentic Italian. Great place in Cabbagetown to meet up with friends to talk, relax or just grab a great coffee to go."}
{"text":"Very nice selection of fresh baked goods. Wonderful donut. Wonderful chocolate almost croissant. Great latte. Beautiful chai tea. Charming decor and service.

The grilled cheese was good,  but could have been better with better cheese and whole grain bread."}
{"text":"The place is hip and cool, the staff is friendly and the menu looks good.  They have the regular fixings of a cafe including patisseries and java along with ice cream.  I thought it's a clever combination to have ice cream in a coffee shop and think it will be a hit even in the winter.
I loved the wing back chairs all lined up in the main room.  It gave me the urge to run down to Daniel & Daniel and grab couple of milk crates they have stacked, put  a wing back chair on them in the middle of the room and wave to anyone passing by.  Maybe I'll hold off on running down to D&D rather check the back if they have any stacked in the lane way.  :)"}
{"text":"Been coming here since it was newly opened and honestly, it has one of the best chai teas I've had. Although I have not tried their entire menu, the sole fact that their chai is this good makes this a place you should definitely check out.

To start off, the chai has an amazing rich taste. Little hints of ginger and cinnamon peak through however, it is not too strong. It goes perfectly with one of their chocolate chip cookies. 

Next off, the ambiance of this place. This place has a relaxed and laid back ambiance. This is reinforced by their choice of furniture, which would be beautiful and comfy armchairs. The ambiance completely compliments the drinks. If you have time, definitely come in, sit down and have a nice warm drink.

Last off, the staff. The people here are amazing, completely laid back and very easy to talk to. As you come here, you'll notice that they're no longer just people serving you. 

All in all, this place is amazing. If you're in the mood for a cup of tea and some relaxing, definitely drop by."}
