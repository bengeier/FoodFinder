{"text":"I have been a vegetarian for 24 years. So, I know vegan/vegetarian food well. I had literally been counting down the days, so that I could start enjoying Chef Kenny's food again. What shocked me was that the Cajun fish was even BETTER than the one I used to order at the other place! It tasted perfect before...I didn't know that you could improve on perfection! The melody of spices, coupled with the texture of the fish was so tasty, that I left none for my guy (he was at work). He wasn't too happy, but when he ate the orange chicken and the crispy beef, he forgot all about it!"}
{"text":"Tried out the new restaurant, finally! Usually my go to is the \"orange chicken\" which is always amazing. But this spot has sushi which of course I had to try!!! The sushi does fill a void that has been missing in my life for awhile. The two rolls I got were the crunchy roll and coconut roll. The crunchy roll was my favorite. The coconut roll was good, but a little on the sweet side. Next time i will add spice! Would recommend adding mango as an option to the sushi, that would be really cool!"}
{"text":"Best vegan food in town! Super friendly and fast service every time i've been. Chef Kenny says hello and makes sure you are happy with your food. Everything is delicious and the sushi is amazing! Will be back on the regular."}
{"text":"Ok so I wanted to rate 4 stars but I was feeling horrible if i did because the food was excellent , superb. Now here is my issue , it tasted like the real deal ! My first bite i said no there's no way so i pick up my phone and call the restaurant and ask is all your food vegan based the lady says yes ! So i said thank you ! I'm still not believing it tho but it's excellent food very delicious and had me stuffed! The reason i wanted to rate 4 stars is cause i wish grub hub explained more of what is the base of each entree. But when you come across that friend that's like vegetarian or vegans are boring bring them some food from chef Kenny and ask them if it's boring now ! Sorry if this review is all over the place I'm still eating my food"}
{"text":"Chef Kennys new restaurant is just amazing the sushi is just blowing my mind and i can not get enough The best vegan restaurant in Las Vegas for sure go check it out very recommended 
it is so good!!!!"}
{"text":"Chef Kenny is back! Yay! We were so happy that the new restaurant is open. We went for lunch and got all of our old favorites and they were better than ever! They had lunch specials for $9 that came with the most delicious soup... and portions were big! We had the Kung Pao Chicken, Crispy Beef, and General Tso Chicken. All were DELICIOUS! And, we tried a new sushi roll. We got the Crunchy Roll and it was AMAZING! Soooooo good. I can't wait to go back and try more new items!"}
{"text":"Chef Kenny brought all his fabulous recipes from Veggie House, added more great items (sushi!) and created a welcoming and friendly place to enjoy a great meal. Everything was wonderful, as expected! It's such a relief to be able to go to a vegan restaurant and know we can eat everything on the menu! And there just isn't a more kind chef out there than Kenny. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Sooooooo AMAZING. Sushi menu is a great addition too. I've tried 3 rolls and all of them were so good!!!! Chef Kenny is amazing!!!!"}
{"text":"Chef Kenny has done it again.  His food is amazing! I've been twice with my daughter this week and we both love it. The staff is very nice.  And when I went in tonight chef kenny greeted me by name! It's amazing.  Cute location, comfortable interior and amazing food. We've had the orange chicken,  beef and broccoli,  edamame, eel roll, Dragon roll and Hawaiian roll so far and the vanilla and DURIAN ice cream,  which is, heavenly.  I love this place. It's a vegan paradise of treats for sure!!"}
{"text":"So good! Fresh ingredients & so many flavors! Love it! The sushi was awesome!! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I've been to Chef Kenny's other restaurants and have quite enjoyed them all. This is Chef Kenny's newest endeavor and I'm glad to report I approve of it! 

Onto the food! 

Hot and sour soup: I'm pretty picky about hot and sour soup and this one was done perfectly. It has more of that \"sour\" taste from the vinegar which is what I enjoy. The spice level was perfect as well. 

\"Beef\" pan fried noodles: Taste wise, this was good. However, I did wish it had more sauce to it because it was pretty dry. 

Fried tofu and \"fish\": I don't know why but I really liked the texture of the \"fish\"...most likely from what it's made of. I'm not completely sure what's it made from but I'm thinking it's tofu related. If you close your eyes while eating this, the texture is very similar to fish. 

Roti canai: my favorite! Roti canai is what I always get when I visit Malaysia. This is the closest place I can find that is similar to the ones back home. It's a thin flakey pastry (almost like a pancake) that you dip into chicken curry...in this case \"chicken\" curry. I highly recommend this dish.

3 different sushi rolls (spicy tuna, jack fruit, crunchy roll): Instead of the usual cucumber rolls or California rolls, Chef Kenny came up with more interesting rolls. Out of the 3 that we got, I liked the jack fruit because it's different. It had a nice sweet taste to it that I surprisingly enjoyed. 

Overall, I would come back here again. I would love to bring my friends here. I do want to try their lunch menu because from what I can see, it looks like a pretty good deal!"}
{"text":"Food was amazing! We had the Kung pao chicken and the Vegan Crunchy roll.  only thing I would add to the restaurant is more selection with spicy sauces like siracha or something to because I'm addicted to heat in my food. Great restaurant. You won't be disappointed. Also make room for dessert because they are like eye ball rolling good."}
{"text":"We finally got here yesterday! Literally have been looking forward to this since Chef Kenny announced he was opening a new restaurant. 
Happy to say,  it was completely worth the wait. 
Food was excellent. There is a lot of options and all at a great price. 
Can not wait for our next visit!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been a fan of Veggie House for years and when we heard Chef Kenny opened up his own place, we were so excited to try it! Had lunch today there and we are not disappointed!!! The vegan sushi (specifically the spicy \"tuna\" roll) was amazing!!! There's no need to go back to the real stuff. Seriously. It's THAT good. Service was friendly and warm. We are definitely coming here again, I wish I could eat here everyday!"}
{"text":"Chef Kenny has done the impossible ..Make vegan (plant-based) sushi taste and feel like real sushi. Mouth-watering, pleasant atmosphere and a decent sized menu. The staff was friendly and on top of things. I'll be back again and again and again"}
{"text":"AMAZING! everything i try here is stellar. this restaurant is perfect because you can get a strawberry milkshake and a spicy 'tuna' roll in the same spot. one of the best restaurants in town hands down!"}
{"text":"Service was excellent.  Friendly and very prompt. We ordered the smoked fish and roti appetizers. Both very good.  Then beef pumpkin squash with soft tofu and Buddha's delight veggies.  Beef pumpkin was excellent and  Buddha's delight was good.  Thoroughly enjoyed the experience."}
{"text":"I have been waiting for chef Kenny to open that place for so longggg! I'm so happy it finally happened:) I went there with my bf and we ordered kang pao chicken and crispy beef , it was sooooo good !! 
I'll definitely come back to try the rest of the items on the menu ;) 
Ty chef Kenny"}
{"text":"The staff here is very friendly, Kenny is walking around talking to everyone who walks in the door. The food, OMG the food is amazing."}
{"text":"Since becoming plant-based as of June 2017, i have dined at Chef Kenny's establishments on a regular basis. You would be hard-pressed to find better Vegan food anywhere else! The 100% plant-based Rainbow Roll is FANTASTIC, as is my favorite Cilantro Salad, that i discovered at Chef Kenny's other location. Everything on the menu is phenominal! 10/5 stars for the food, the fantastic staff, the atmosphere, and Chef Kenny himself. Congrats to Chef Kenny and his fantastic team for opening up a wonderful, one-of-a-kind restaurant!"}
{"text":"I have been seeing all about this place on the Las Vegas Vegan Group on Facebook, and I knew that when I was in Vegas I had to go here first thing. As soon as I came over the hill and started descending into Las Vegas, my mouth started salivating because I knew what I was about to experience. There were definitely high expectations. 

When I got to the restaurant I was so happy I practically ran for the door. When I got inside I was greeted by a very friendly, and helpful hostess who told me all about the sushi. I then got the menu and was pretty overwhelmed by all the amazing options. 

We all decided to order the fried rice, chow mein, rainbow sushi roll, sweet and sour chicken (not pictured), and then orange chicken.

While I was waiting for the food, I saw chef Kenny and felt star struck. I saw him walk out of the kitchen and start going around tables, and I was preparing what I was going to say. Before he got to our table all the food came at once, but he then came over and was incredibly nice and talked to us multiple times, and even took a picture with us. 

As for the food - all I can say is INCREDIBLE!!! Not only did it taste like the real deal (including the shrimp), it felt relatively light compared to most Chinese places. I left feeling perfect!!

If you're ever in Vegas, or just driving through, you can't miss this place!! You also have to go to Chef Kenny's other restaurant Vegeway, which I didn't get to try but Kenny gave me the card for it and said it's great. Amazing!!"}
{"text":"Got take out and service was fast and friendly. Place was busy at 7pm on a Thursday night. Crunch roll was great especially with the addition to the lemon. Happy to se they are doing so well."}
{"text":"I had lunch today at Chef Kenny's newest restaurant.  It was absolutely delicious!  I had the Spicy Crispy beef lunch special,  all I can say is outstanding.  The staff were super attentive and helpful.  I will be back to try some of the new vegan sushi rolls."}
{"text":"Our new favorite place. We've gone a few times now and every single time we have had an excellent meal.  The rice is perfectly cooked. The sushi rolls are the most flavorful rolls we have ever had. All the meat alternatives taste exactly like the real thing. A must try place!  Plus the restaurant is decorated very nicely with very attentive wait staff. If I could eat here every day I would!"}
{"text":"Located right next to Greenland Supermarket on Spring Mountain we have the very well-known vegan chef, Kenny. For those who do not know chef Kenny, he owns other vegan restaurants as well. Upon walking in you are greeted with a warm welcome from the staff which is a good start to any restaurant. My family and I ordered the hot and sour soup, house special pan fried noodles, fish, roti with curry, and three different sushi rolls. I am all for trying out new things and love vegan restaurants, but this one just didn't live up to its hype. Two out of the three sushi rolls we ordered tasted the same, the only one that tasted different was the spicy tuna roll only because it had a spice factor to it. The house special pan fried noodle looked very appealing and almost looked like it wasn't vegan at all, but after trying the shrimp, beef, and chicken they all had no flavor at all which was quite disappointing. However, my favorite dish would have to be the Roti with the curry. The Roti was fluffy and the curry had potatoes inside for you to dip in. However, the staff needs to be heavily worked on. With our Roti and curry, we weren't even finished yet and they took it away assuming we were done with it without even asking. Secondly, the place is very cramped. Luckily when we went it wasn't busy, but if it was a full house then it would feel very cramped as the tables are literally one feet from the next table. I could literally touch the table next to me if I barely reached out my arm. Also, the price of the food is quite pricey as well. For three rolls, a fish, house special noodles, and roti with curry, and hot and sour soup, our total came out to be over 80 dollars. Overall this place to me is a solid 3.5 stars because of the service and pricing of the food. Will I come back? Possibly, to try their lunch special. Will I recommend this place to friends? If their service improves then most definitely I will recommend this place to my friends."}
{"text":"I'm a sushi lover! When I saw this place in yelp I was like there's no way it will taste like real sushi. But I eat vegetarian and vegan stuff on a daily basis so I def wanted to give it a try and I'm soooo glad I did. I was so shocked with how everything tasted. The orange chicken was great too. Will def be returning!!"}
{"text":"Outstanding Vegan cuisine. 3 types of sushi, crispy, spicy tuna and California.  All great.  No soy needed. Spicy Beef, Orange Chicken, Orange Beef and hunan pork.  Great flavor, texture...but watch yourself birdie.....filling.  Kenny does it again!!!!"}
{"text":"This was the best vegan restaurant. Really enjoyed the food and the workers were very nice.
Was so nice to meet chef Kenny he is a very nice person and his food was excellent.
I will always come here when I am in Las Vegas.
I will also try his drive thru place."}
{"text":"I went here for my birthday dinner and let me say I was so impressed. The service was excellent they honestly seemed like they wanted to cater to us than just do their job. The food was excellent. I have never eaten a vegan meal and felt so full and content afterwards. This restaurant is truly a new favorite of mine and I will be back very soon! I also shared this restaurant with some other vegan and vegetarian friends so they can enjoy as well! It is so nice to go to a restaurant and not worry about it my meal may not actually be vegan!"}
{"text":"Chef Kenny, you rock! The waitress I had both times were very sweet and attentive. This is an all vegan asian spot with everything from ramen to curry to sushi to \"beef\" and broccoli dishes. I can't say enough good things about the sushi. It's so delicious and the \"eel\" is made in house from mushrooms. The spicy tuna hand roll was delicious and we also enjoyed a crunch roll and dragon roll. 

The lunch specials have generous portions and come with rice. The faux meats are good. Some are breaded such as the orange chicken and others are just insane that they are even vegan (vegan shrimp!!) The Cajun shrimp is so good. Sounds weird but the flavor reminded me of flaming hot Cheetos. 

Both visits we were brought complimentary cups of cabbage soup which was simple yet delicious. I've heard good things about the ramen and curry and can't wait to try them next!"}
{"text":"Chef Kenny's Asian Vegan Restaurant..

Wow! I can't believed it finally opened! But I was really excited when I was able to have their food! The staffs at the restaurant are very kind. They have a lot of choices that you can choose from the menu. Honestly, I think their food is amazing! And I can't wait to come back again!

Congratulations, Chef Kenny!"}
{"text":"Without a doubt the best Asian food in Las Vegas. Chef Kenny has put together the most amazing flavors and the best news is that it's totally Vegan. My personal favorite is the House Chow Mein and Crispy Beef. I can't begin to say how amazing the food is. Beyond belief."}
{"text":"I had to come back to Yelp to check if it was vegan because I received the food on delivery ( way faster than expected ) and the food looked like an authentic Asian cuisine, and tasted it like it too! I am amazed, all of the food was delicious. I highly recommend the orange chicken and spicy pad Thai to any who come to this establishment."}
{"text":"I've been to both of Chef Kenny's other restaurants and enjoyed them immensely.  This new one, tho, is on it's way to greatness.  I took off a star based on the wait for our food - the food quality is way up there.  We started with a tame spring roll... nothing too exciting, but it was hot & crispy so we were happy.  The only issue was that it took 25 minutes from the time we ordered for the spring roll to arrive.  After that glitch, the rest of the meal was pretty close to perfect.  The Crunch Roll was soooo tasty, plus, if you ask for it, they do have low sodium soy sauce.  The highlight of our dinner was the Orange Beef, which is incredibly tasty and plentiful.  This dish gives vegan a new position in my life because neither the Hubby or I missed the meat.  We're fans & I hope to upgrade the stars on our next visit. It was lovely to see Chef Kenny in the dining room, mixing and mingling with the guests.  You can tell that this restaurant shows his passion for vegan food."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food you'll ever have!!! I've literally been here 5 consecutive days since my first time. U can't get enough of this place!! The Hawaiian and crunchy roll are sooooo amazing & the orange chicken is to die for! I can't wait to try everything else. Chef Kenny is a vegan genius"}
{"text":"We had to make a stop here after finding out that the original chef from Veggie House made his own restaurant. I'm in love with everything on the menu and they even have pho. We got the spring rolls and spicy crispy beef and it was everything and more. He's a creative genius and he gets 5 stars every time! Oh and don't forget the spicy orange crispy beef. We will be back."}
{"text":"I had never tried strictly vegan food but I like trying different food.My vegan friend treated me. We had a dragon roll sushi, fish curry and beef broccoli with brown rice. The food was amazing as it tasted like the real thing! The portions were very good. The chef himself talked to each of his customers. He was such a pleasant person you really felt like a guest . The atmosphere was relaxing and the staff patient, friendly helpful."}
{"text":"What an amazing moment in time. A good aquaintence that we met last year at veggie house we met her up here today so place is filled with positive energy on a different level. We are ordering vegan crunch roll ,  general tao chicken and sesame seed chicken( it was a solid) chef Kenny is here food is 10\10 , am full 3 premium items = 40 dollars and breakfast for tommorow. Place will not disappoint, and tell Don that Michael sent you. He will know who you are talking about.  :)   Friendly staff friendly service, and if anything is wrong they will make you a new one."}
{"text":"So delicious! We had the \"Tuna handroll\", Jackfruit nigiri, Crunch Roll, Hot n Sour soup and the chocolate cheesecake. I just can't explain how beautifully presented they were and the textures and tastes of the sushi items were so realistic. Absolutely Yummy!  I can't wait to visit again and again because there are so many more delights that my Vegan taste buds want to try."}
{"text":"Best vegan Asian cuisine hands down. Chef Kenny is an artist! Creating the most savory, delicious and  exquisite recipes. I started off with the house soup, and ordered combination noodles for the table (which were phenomenal) looked and tasted just like shrimp and meat which almost made me question if it was really vegan ! The answer is YES all 100% vegan. We ordered the sushi hand rolls and finished off with the cheesecake . Everything and I mean everything was amazing. Chef Kenny even came around to the table and gave us an insider scoop on all the ingredients he puts into making these lovely dishes which only made me appreciate it even more. You can tell he puts so much care and passion into making your meals and creating the finest dishes. I cannot wait to go back. Loyal happy customer. And our server Sandy was great too very attentive and gave amazing recommendations and customer service ! Thank you chef Kenny for being such a passionate chef and creating an amazing restaurant where your food can be appreciated!"}
{"text":"Very impressed with the quality of all of the food we had here.  Service was great, food came quickly, and Chef Kenny himself was even around to make sure we were enjoying everything.  Definitely be sure to visit and order some sushi!"}
{"text":"I'm not even slightly a vegetarian, but my daughter asked me to try it! I will always try something, if i like it? I'll try it again! 
I'll definitely be back! The orange chicken was unbelievable! We also ordered the Ribs! Omg! The food here was delicious! The  spicy tuna roll & rainbow roll! Yummy!!!! 
Leave your bias at the curb! It was filling and super tasty. 
You should give this place a try! I'm stuffed!"}
{"text":"Everybody was happy in the restaurant and that's always a good first impression. Everything was clean and tidy. Good was especially delicious. I had the Cantonese fish. Tofu was cooked to the perfect consistency. Most impressive was Chef Kenny actually coming out from the kitchen to check on the guests and ask for opinions.... Extremely rare nowadays. Overall great. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Yummy and fresh. Ordered 2 specialty rolls. Both were very unique. The one with eggplant strip on top was epic. Had the beef hot plate also. Could have used more sauce but was really good."}
{"text":"I love all of Chef Kenny's restaurants! Very few places in town that you can go as a vegan an eat off of the entire menu. The dragon roll is delicious! I loved the \"eel\" and eggplant on top! Chef Kenny you are a true inspiration to aspiring vegan chefs such as myself! Your creativity and flavors are unmatched. Thank you for your consistently delicious food! I wish you much success!

Chef P."}
{"text":"Since I am a huge fan of Chef Kenny's Veggie Way, I decided to try his new restaurant. Lunch menu is such a great deal... Only $8.95 for vegan main dish, rice and soup. My braised tofu and veggie was great, but I liked my husband's crispy vegan beef was better(definitely ordering for myself next time) 

Only problem was slow service. The waitress who came to take an order was pretty nice, friendly and welcoming. But the waiter who came to deliver the food was kinda shy and needed to speak up. We had no idea what he said and he acted like avoiding contact with the customers. On that day there were only 2 servers on the floor and we ended up waiting like forever for the box and check. They obviously need more trained servers"}
{"text":"Best sushi in Las Vegas! Chef Kenny knocks it out of the park. Not only is the food on point, but the service is great. Everyone is so nice and treats you like you're an old friend. I recommend this place to all my friends."}
{"text":"My new favorite spot! Everything is delicious  spring rolls, vegan sexy roll and Kung pap chicken yummmm"}
{"text":"First time here and it definitely won't be my last. My wife and I really, really enjoyed our food. The wait staff was very friendly and attentive (Sandy is awesome!). They provided suggestions, and when I accidentally ordered a fried dish, they were accommodating and were willing to alter the recipe slightly so that it was not fried. Chef Kenny himself even came out to speak  with us. I love that. Again, I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Super is the only word to start this a review with. even better then Chef Kenniy's old joint 
As we entered we were welcomed by the same staff from the the old location, it was a pleasure to see key staff have moved too. 
The food, now, started with hot n sour soup, it's a big bowl good enough for four/five people. Flavors were amazing real opener of the taste buds. This time i experienced a peppery after taste which I loved but others on the table found it spicier 
Then came the lettuce wraps, this a seriously delicious dish, lettuce was fresh n crunchy with vegan meat cooked to perfection
Then came along the sesame chicken, it was probably the last on my list. For me it's was a bit oily n lacked the spicy punch, my daughter loved it her #1 dish for the evening 
All in all a must go to restaurant n Chef Kenny has that magic to make Vegan taste better then meat
We will be back often"}
{"text":"I ordered the lunch to go. The portion was so small only had 4 pieces of tofu 2 pieces of bok choy. Not what i expect for $10.It was a small snack not a meal. 2 stars for the taste Chef Kenny is a Great Chef. The food tasted great as usual.Since it was opening day i will try again."}
{"text":"We have been dying to try out Chef Kenny's new spot! We were finally able to make just before they stopped seating guests before closing. Our waitress was very thorough in explaining the menu, what her recommendations were and answering all of our questions. Never once were we rushed, which was pretty amazing considering we closed the place down. Chef Kenny came over to explain the sushi options and make his own recommendations about customer favorites. We had lettuce wraps, spicy tuna roll, rainbow roll and the crunch roll. Everything was AMAZING!!"}
{"text":"Chef Kenny was the reason why I enjoyed his last restaurant.  It's much better here, more items, a lot more chill.  He's also a much better chef and manager.  People here are happy.  The other restaurant irks me now cuz of the lack of attention to the food and service.

Old Veggie house review.
Great service, the chef is a nice and talented guy.  The vibe is relaxing and the food is delicious.  The innovative and delicious, healthy dishes blows me away every time.  Coming here for a few years after my friend first introduced me here on a whim, and I'm always finding myself wanting to come back.  I can say that these employees, AND the chef and owner himself always always go beyond excellent service.  They will greet me and all guests, along with doing so much for you.  After infrequent and spaced out visits, they seem to remember me and my friends.

If you love Chinese food, vegetarian food, or a twist on food, you'll love this place.  If you enjoy chipper employees that most Chinese restaurants lack, you'll love this place.  The vibe here is so zen!  Each time I order a dish, it never goes unfinished unless planned to be taken home from the start.  The quaint and peaceful location feels out of place from the rest of Chinatown.  This is definitely one of my favorite spots to have ever visited in all of Las Vegas.  This is an all around knock out location"}
{"text":"Remarkable!!! Recreations of fish made of veggies. Looks, feels and taste like fish. 
How does Chef Kenny do it?"}
{"text":"Had an amazing lunch with my co-workers.  We were immediately greeted and seated.  Our waters were delivered promptly, followed by three orders of hot jasmine scented tea.  Our server made some suggestions for first time guests.  Ordered to share, we had the Spicy Crispy Beef, Crispy Spicy Eggplant, and Braised Tofu with vegetables.  The eggplant was perfectly crispy without being greasy.  The sauce was a perfect blend of spicy and sweetness.  The crispy beef was unbelievably tasty. My meat lovin' BF would approve!  The braised tofu was excellent as well.  The nutty chewy brown rice was a perfect side for all of dishes.  The lunch portions were large.  We have some saved for an afternoon snack.  The vegetable soup was light and delicious.  The craziest thing was the salmon sushi.  Made from cornstarch?  Blew our minds!  Chef Kenny stopped by to check on us.  He gave us recommendations for our next visit which I hope will be soon!"}
{"text":"I was excited to visit Chef Kenny's for the first time the other day and very much enjoyed the food and service. The spicy \"tuna\" sushi was AMAZING, as were the General Tso's \"Chicken\" and Mongolian \"Beef.\" The wait staff were very friendly and helpful, and Chef Kenny came out to speak with us for a few minutes. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place! It's mind blowing that everything on the menu is vegan. We had the crispy beef, crunchy roll, rainbow roll, orange chicken, spicy eggplant...basically everything is OFF THE HOOK including the service! VEGAN or not, check it out! It's worth it!"}
{"text":"Wow! This place is ah-MAH-zing! My husband is doesn't like fried food and I'm gluten-free. So they were so accommodating to both of us in changing the  recipe.  The chef came to talk to us twice. And he said he might open one in Henderson!"}
{"text":"Today was Chef Kenny day.  With my vegan daughter, I first hit Vegeway his fast food vegan burger joint.  For dinner it was his new Asian Fusion restaurant.  

Chef Kenny met us at the door and remembered my daughter from her last visit.  The restaurant has just opened and is a local favorite.  

Starting with sushi - coconut and dragon rolls - we moved on the sesame \"chicken\" and vegetable wonton ramen soup.  Absolutely delicious and you will never miss the non-plant protein sources.  

For those who remember when vegan food equalled cardboard taste, this place will blow your socks or flip flops off.  There was so much more we would have tried if the portions were not so large.  

Thank you to Chef Kenny for elevating vegan food in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"AMAZING.
vegan crunchy roll. AMAZING.
hawaiian roll. AMAZING.
dynamite roll. AMAZING.
also got the jackfruit roll but it took about 20 minutes to come out to us for some reason.
general tso's chicken. AMAZING. crunchy and amazing.
orange chicken. AMAZING.
it's new n it's vegan, chef kenny was there and was really friendly, the wait staff was attentive for the most part, very catering. 
will definitely be a regular here."}
{"text":"Chef Kenny has done it again! His new restaurant is even better than his original restaurant. All of our favorites are still on the menu with the addition of vegan sushi, pho and more!! We went yesterday and will probably return for more today!! Very highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"Soooooo goood!!! From the special tea, to the sushi, to the entrees. We loved it ALL!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner recently and was greeted by Chef Kenny himself! 

I have always been a fan of Chef Kenny. The food prepared by him is phenomenal. Chef Kenny has a true talent for creating vegan dishes that are well presented AND full of flavor. 

One of my favorites is the Orange Chicken. I honestly cannot tell that it isn't actual chicken. I also enjoy the sizzling plates. Again, full of flavor and always served fresh and hot. 

The service here was great. Servers are friendly and super attentive. Chef Kenny even checked in personally to ensure we were having a great experience. 

Great food and great service! Well done Chef Kenny!"}
{"text":"Chef Kenny is back! After being a long time Veggie House fan it saddened me to learn about some of the events that occurred. While keeping his old menu for old fans, he brings a new sushi menu full of wonderful tasty treats. I had several rolls and all of them are equally fantastic. The staff is friendly as always and will remember customers faces. I am so pleased to have a local restaurant that creates brilliant food, and creating such a warm welcoming environment. Keep up the fantastic work!"}
{"text":"Spicy tuna roll was amazing. Orange chicken was the best I've ever had. House chow mein was incredible. The shrimp was insanely good. Super friendly staff. I wish I had one of these where I live.."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite vegan Asian restaurant! As you approach the sign on the door says \"no meat allowed in this restaurant\" and that's something I love to see. We were seated immediately and our server approached us right after that. The menu is extensive with a separate one for sushi. We ordered the fried wontons, fried dumplings and sesame chicken and all were fantastic. When we received our bill and were about to pay Chef Kenny came to our table to ask how things were. We loved that. This is a great little place. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"SOOO excited that Chef Kenny is back in business! So if you like  then you will like this place.

Da Food: 5/5 Food here is excellent, such delicious food! If you have ever eaten at Veggie House in China Town then this place is the better looking, taller, more successful older twin. All the good Chinese Vegan food you came to love from Veggie House is here, but they have now added vegan sushi, and it is bomb!

Da Customer Service: 5/5 Always excellent, a few of the divorce employees from Veggie house came over with Chef Kenny and service is still as awesome as ever. Super quick, vey attentive, before I even have to ask for a refill, or put my fork on the plate, they are refilling the drinks or taking the dirty dishes away. 

Da Price: 4/5 Prices are reasonable for the majority of the items. Many of the items are shareable size so it makes it a lot nicer on the wallet. My only gripe is now hot tea cost money, were before it use to come complimentary. 

Da Good: Excellent Vegan Chinese/Japanese food that is shareable and good for big groups or even one person who wants to taste it all.

Da Bad: A lot of processed \"fake\" meat, not many Veggies are used as the proteins.

Da Ugly: I wish the \"sushi\" was AYCE, 11 dollars a roll get a little expensive. 

Overall: This place is a great option for Vegan Chinese food, it has all you have come to love in Chinese food without the worries of consuming any animals. It is also excellent for groups of people, I like to take my parents and in laws here."}
{"text":"The staff from veggie house came over to Chef Kenny's and it was like a reunion. Simply amazing, as to be expected from anything Chef Kenny does. Thanks for making the vegan community what it is and making such OUTSTANDING food. Hats off to the chef."}
{"text":"Bravo Chef Kenny!! Everything we ordered was fantastic and the service was so friendly. 4 of us dined for lunch and everything looked so amazing but we settled on the Rainbow Roll, Jackfruit Roll, Crunch Roll, seaweed salad, spicey eggplant (very mild spice) and the Chow Mein. It was Soooooooo gooooood!! The sushi rolls were killer.

The service was awesome and even Chef Kenny stopped by to welcome us. So happy he's opened his own spot bc this man kniws how to make amazing vegan dishes. Thank you for adding killer sushi rolls and we'll def me back!

Our servers were Li and Mimi, they offer Wi-Fi, takeout, have a Groupon so check them out!"}
{"text":"Chef Kenny has done it again! I can't tell you how we desperately needed a viable vegan sushi option in this city and it's not just that, it's amazing. The eel sauce, the California Roll, the spicy creamy roll, ITS ALL GOOD!!! They've completely overhauled the menu while keeping many of the must-haves from before. Veggie House has nothing on this new spot. The staff are so personable and they're eager to provide the most outstanding service. Thank you to Chef Kenny, Mimi and the whole crew. We will be back to see you soon."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING. I was a fan of Chef Kenny's previous restaurant, Veggie House, and this place has all the same menu items as that did with the addition of a sushi menu! The sushi menu is what keeps me coming back- every roll I've tried has been spectacular. My favorites are the dragon roll, the crunchy roll, & the hawaii roll. Besides the sushi, I also love the spring rolls, Chef Kenny's crispy beef, and the General Sao's chicken. The service here is also amazing, they always remember us & are kind & courteous. As someone who rarely goes out to eat, I still find myself eating here on an almost weekly basis. It's that good."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner greeted by Chef Kenny himself ALL the staff are extremely friendly.  This is a Vegan sushi and vegan noodle and Chinese restaurant. Had the Dragon Roll, Crunchy Roll their vegan versions and the rolls were extremely good. Also ordered the beef pumpkin squash with soft tofu and mushroom so yummy and nourishing was accompanied with their red/brown rice. Healthier tastier option versus the traditional white rice. My friend had the sizzling beef plate and the entire dinner commented how glad she was to have a great healthy meal and could not tell it was not beef. Ended our dinner with their vegan strawberry cheese cake with vegan chocolate ice cream  so Yummy"}
{"text":"Had the pleasure of attending for the soft opening.  Everything was incredible - just as you'd expect from Chef Kenny!  We especially enjoyed his new sushi items (as well as old favorites like crispy beef!).    Cannot wait until he has his liquor license and stays open later :)"}
{"text":"We are from San Diego and don't have Vegan Asian food there. The closest thing we have is Loving hut. 

Spicy crispy beef was AMAZING I literally almost cried!!! Jackfruit hand roll and Dragon roll were also very tasty and just satisfy sushi cravings!!!!
They have extensive sushi menu that you won't find anywhere. If you are staying on the strip the drive is very short to his restaurant . 
Make sure to visit whether you're vegan or not!!!!!! Chef Kenny also walks around talking to his customers which my husband and I appreciated. He is a Cooking GENIUS in the flesh. Someone give this man an award!!!!!"}
{"text":"I've been waiting for this restaurant to open, and I'm so happy that I've finally had dinner here! The food is amazing, as always! If you're thinking about trying vegan food for the first time, I'm telling you now, you will be blown away! I'm not vegan or vegetarian, but I incorporate healthier, non-meat meals, at least twice a week. Just to keep the balance. I'm glad that there are more vegan options all over Vegas now. Chef Kenny is just as delightful as his treats, and the service from the staff is just excellent! That is why my friends and I always come back. It's the best and most delicious!!! Just check it out!!!"}
{"text":"Chef Kenny is excellent. His food is excellent, and the service was great. I still do not understand how vegan sushi tastes so close to the real thing. The orange chicken and pan fried noodles were incredible. I can't wait to go back for more!"}
{"text":"I was surprised at how good the food was. Everything was very flavorful even the brown rice side was good. Vegan sushi was surprisingly not just avocado and cucumber so that was nice to see. Service was good and I will definitely be returning to try more things."}
{"text":"Anything Chef Kenny touches turns into vegan gold. His new restaurant is the perfect place to share a meal with friends or a date. The only thing that's missing is alcohol, but I hear they are working on getting a liquor license! For now I'm content to sip on my Thai iced tea (~$3), which is delightfully thirst-quenching by the way. 

I'd recommend starting off your meal with some spring rolls (~$3). On my next visit I plan on trying the BBQ appetizer. Now for the main course, you MUST try the sushi. I am sold on the spicy tuna roll (~$11). My husband got the Kung Pao chicken and loved it. I mean, the menu is huge so it's going to be pretty hard to choose but there's really something from everyone!

There's also a Yelp deal and a Groupon available, so feel free to splurge. :)

YELP'S 2018 REVIEW CHALLENGE: #19"}
{"text":"My new favorite restaurant! Yesterday I went here with 7 of my friends to celebrate my birthday (I made the reservation last week). The food and level of customer service was PHENOMENAL!

We were seated right away at the most beautiful table in the room! The servers were very accommodating and the food came out really fast! Now on to the food...

The menu had a great selection of food. My boyfriend and I ordered jasmine tea, thai tea, the fried wan tons and spring rolls appetizers, the dragon roll, crunch roll, spicy tuna roll, and kung pao beef with brown rice. Everything was delicious! It is hard to choose a favorite, but if i had to pick one it would be the Spicy Tuna Roll! Sooo good! reminded me of real spicy tuna (well at least, what I remember it tasting like)! My boyfriend really enjoyed the crunchy roll and the kung pao beef (he is not vegan either)! My best friend is not a vegan but said the sweet and sour chicken was perfect! He couldn't even tell it was vegan!

Chef Kenny even came to our table to ask how we were enjoying the sushi! I felt so special. He explained how he uses guava and makes his own vegan mayo to make the sushi delicious and healthy. 

The server was very sweet and attentive; she took the time to separate our checks. She even took a group photo for us!

I had a wonderful birthday dinner. Thank you Chef Kenny and staff! I truly appreciate this. I will definitely be back and I will recommend this place to all vegan and non-vegan friends and relatives. Great work! Keep it up!"}
{"text":"So for those that have been to Veggie House,  this is a lot like that, plus a sushi menu.  There is also a new hainana (sp?) spicy pork on the chef specials that is great....crispy and spicy but not super sweet like the eggplant.

If you haven't been to Veggie House, all you need to do is come here, since it's better and has Chef Kenny for reals.  All of the (mostly american style with some Malaysian thrown in) Chinese food you could want in soy protein form, usually with a nice breading and sauce.  I'm fond of general tso's and kung pal chicken,  crispy eggplant, walnut shrimp, chow fun, and... basically there's not much I don't like.  Just watch your glucose level if you're diabetic as it's often carbolicious here."}
{"text":"This was my first time at one of Chef Kenny's restaurants. I can't believe I waited so long. It was nice to go in to a restaurant and be able to order anything on the menu. It's all Vegan. I also loved the sign on the front door asking people to not bring on any kind of meat products to this restaurant.

Everyone was nice, Chef Kenny came by to say hi and the service was exceptional. We bought the Groupon and could order anything on the menu except for the lunch special.

We ordered the Orange Chicken, rainbow roll, spicy tuna roll, fried eggplant, fried rice and chocolate and strawberry ice cream.

It was all so delicious. I am sure if you brought a non vegan here, they would love it. We had so much food left over to take home which was nice for the lunch the next day.

The restaurant was also really busy and everyone seemed very happy. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! I honestly can't believe how much the sushi tastes like actual fish, I was so impressed! I had the Rainbow Roll and absolutely loved it. I also had some of the Kung Pao combo which consisted of shrimp, chicken and beef, and all of them tasted great and very much like the real thing! The lettuce wraps and spring rolls were also delicious. My only suggestions would be to add some more dessert items to the menu- vegan cakes and baked goods would be perfect! And also to serve alcohol, even just beer and wine would be great. Other than that though this place was so on point and I will definitely be frequenting it now on a regular basis."}
{"text":"Omg amazing!!! I have been a vegetarian for 9 years and sushi was something I really missed. We tried several nigiri rolls and cut rolls and everything was perfection. The crunchy roll and rainbow were probably my favorite. The chef came over and greeted us and is a very kind guy. We love all of his restaurants. Great job!"}
{"text":"Ate at Chef Kenny's other restaurant and was excited to try the new place. Always on the lookout for vegan options, Chef Kenny does not disappoint. His new establishment  hits the mark on vegan sushi.  As I am not a fan of raw fish, the comparison is lost on me but not being a stranger to cooked and veggie rolls, this adds a new twist. Our food was explained to us in detail by our happy, smiling waitperson. Chef Kenny stopped by our table to chat and talk about his new venture. We wish him great success but that won't be necessary as the food speaks for itself. This place is on repeat for me and the Bar, who is part seal, didn't mind."}
{"text":"Amazing plant-based food that will satisfy your whole party (even omnivores)! The service is excellent. Happy employees who are really committed to the business is a wonderful thing to see! Very strongly recommend and a must for all visitors looking for vegan food in Las Vegas!!"}
{"text":"Chef Kenny has done it again!!!  The fruit tea was perfect and my orange chicken lunch special was delicious!  Left overs to boot!"}
{"text":"Chef Kenny opened another amazing restaurant. We went here grand opening night. He had amazing service and food. He was even out table touching when they were busy.  This is the place to go for Vegan Asian food."}
{"text":"Amazing!!!  Chef Kenny's restaurant is tasty, delicious, and 100% vegan.  He is extremely creative.  Vegan tuna sushi (yum!), orange chicken, mixed veggies and chicken, chow fun, just to name a few.  You will be amazed!"}
{"text":"Best vegan sushi rolls on the west coast - we though Vancouver Canada was king till we discovered chef Kenny!  Chef came out to check on us - everything was outstanding.  We plan to make this a regular stop in Vegas!"}
{"text":"After reading all of the good reviews I decided to try this place on Mother's Day and because I really like veggie house. They were really packed so I decided to order take out. I really don't like to leave bad reviews but the food was so disappointing. Lack of flavor and I couldn't eat the faux meat, very weird taste, also for over $50 such small portions. 2 stars because I liked the sushi (rainbow roll) and I'm glad the restaurant is vegan."}
{"text":"I ate lunch there with a girlfriend. The food was great, the service was horrible. It took 20 minutes just to take our order and nothing came out together. I finished my full appetizer and lunch before her appetizer and lunch even came.  Hopefully that is one of the kinks they will fix since they are still a new place."}
{"text":"Drove all the way the this restaurant for them to tell me they're closed for their lunch break. It's states on their yelp that they're open until 9pm."}
{"text":"Thump up! I love this place even though I'm not a vegan. The service is excellent. Such a warm and welcome atmosphere. I was a tourist  at Las Vegas. I ate at Chef Kenny restaurant four days in a row. I did not miss eating meat at all. The dishes are flavorful and varieties. There are so many choices. One on of my favorite is the Vietnamese Pho. It's so delicious that I though the vegan beef ball is a real meat. The soup base taste so fragrance and yummy. It's comes with a lot of vege.  I would recommend the vegan sushi too. I especially like the one with the kiwi fruit. It taste  little tiny sweet and sour. Is perfect combination. It comes with avocado too.  Don't miss the refreshing fruit tea. I will  be back for sure."}
