{"text":"Love this place for delivery of great crispy fried shrimp and then some.  Fries are bomb and huge satisfying portions! Kids found it on yelp and I have been requesting it multiple times since.  Best fried food delivery for the menu as far as i have experienced in pittsburgh. Give these guys a shot,  you won't be upset for sure! I'm a huge fan,  of the shrimp and fries."}
{"text":"Really nice people working there.  The food is excellent as well.  The wings are awesome and so is the fish."}
{"text":"Great food. Courteous service. My favorite tray for football nights or when we feel like wings watching a movie at home. Recommended #Pittsburgh"}
{"text":"I've recently moved to Pennsylvania and this was the first place I tried. The tall man at the counter was really sweet and understanding when I took forever and a day to decide on what I want. I ended up getting the steak salad and it turned out to be pretty good.. (I came back for another one the next day). The meat was just perfect and had just enough flavor. The only downfall was that they didn't have any thousand island or French dressing.... maybe next time."}
{"text":"Ate there for lunch for my crew  and tried to call back for dinner. Spent 200 dollars for lunch and just tried to place my dinner order and they couldn't hear me on the phone so I went outside to call.   All my future calls were sent right to voice mail. I assume the rude guy I was talking to before I tried to call back is at fault.  10/10 food -2/10 for customer service."}
