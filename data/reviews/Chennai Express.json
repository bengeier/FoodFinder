{"text":"4 out of 5 times could not serve the Dosa. Also the quality and quantity has degraded over last few months. I will not be not going there anymore. They were actually good when they started. Any Indian restaurant in Montreal down the drain."}
{"text":"Good quality south Indian food for decent price in heart of the downtown. Good for take away as the place is small and crowded."}
{"text":"We ordered from Chennai Express as it was close to our hotel & my daughter was in the mood for idli and dosa. I ordered the idli too & my husband ordered the Shrimp fried rice. We loved the food & they lost one star because the sambar was watery & no flavor. The idli was very soft , daughter loved her idli and dosa."}
{"text":"If you are in Montreal and looking for some good indian food, this is the place to be.  It is on a small place and there is not much room for sit and eat.  There are few chairs available but it is shared by 3 different restaurants.  So try your luck. They are quick and whatever we ordered (Idly, Vada, Chicken Briyani, Chicken and Lamb Kottu, Masala Dosa and Chicken sukka), all tasted really good and seems to be a good value for the money.  It is cheaper compared to other restaurants."}
{"text":"First time here and didn't know what to expect. Chana batura and Dosa were pretty good."}
{"text":"It is not often that you get authentic Indian food made specifically keeping the Indian population is mind. I have been to countless restaurants throughout the country and have noticed that the Indian food is pretty bland. This is because Americans cannot handle spicy food. But the food at this restaurant is awesome. This is the second time that I have been to this restaurant and have simply loved it. I would recommend it to all authentic Indian food eaters out there."}
{"text":"We were looking for some South Indian food after few days of eating various cuisines and this hole in the wall place HIT THE SPOT. It's not a sit down place in any which way or form, but if you want any authentic South Indian flavors this is it. The shrimp dosa, fish curry, Vada and idlis were our favorites from the various dishes we tried. Owner is super friendly and makes sure you like the food. A must try if your craving some southindian cuisine in Montreal!"}
{"text":"I don't usually write reviews. I like the food so much that I decided to write one.  I am a regular here. I have my lunch and dinner at chennai express Monday to Thursday. I know for sure that the food is fresh. The cook Ram is a South Indian. The service is quick and courteous. Just talk to the guy Sunny and he will take care of you. I speak to the owners on a regular basis. They take my suggestions very seriously.   South Indian thali is a must. Love the idlis and dosas."}
{"text":"I love their briyani and all kothu dishes.. price is bit low compared to other restaurants..better to take out since it has very less seatings.."}
{"text":"Hidden gem in the heart of Sainte Catherine. Friendly staff and all the taste from southern Indian cuisine make Chennai Express a great option for lunch in this crowded area!"}
{"text":"Some of the best dosas for minimum price. Non greasy and fantastic taste. Good if you are craving dosa and health conscious. We ordered onion rava dosa and mysore masala dosa, both were awesome."}
{"text":"For a vegetarian,  this is a must place. Tried andra spicy dosa, rava dosa . Tiffin platter.  All were good. If you like super spicy go for andra spicy dosa.  Another time tried naan and gobi manchurian. It was the naan and the gobi manvhurian. Pretty perfect.."}
{"text":"The idlis here are absolutely the best idlis I've had, including restaurants in India. As much fun as I was having trying out the glorious restaurants in Montreal, Chennai Express gave me the comfort of home. Thank you Chennai Express!"}
{"text":"Yum! Having lived in India we are very picky about the Indian  food we eat and we loved the flavors and the freshness of the food here! All vegetarian is also a boon. We would give it two thumbs up but are too busy devouring our dosa and pani puri."}
{"text":"The mutton biryani is the best mutton biryani i have had in all of montreal. The taste reminds me so much of the awesome biryani we make back in the eastern part of india and although this one lacked the extra grease (which is a good thing) it was absolutely lip smacking. Way to go guys!"}
{"text":"Soda machine is broken, but otherwise the food is great, quick service, and good pricing. I was planning on taking a photo but we are it too fast!"}
{"text":"Never had food from India before. Not knowing what I was getting myself into, I was eagerly helped and though the food took some time too prepare (not too long) it was worth waiting for thanks to the friendly service.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because I have nothing to compare it too."}
{"text":"Poor customer service. Firstly,i found hair in my food. I told the girl who takes order that there's hair in my food and she was like \"ok, I will get u another plate\" I expected her to be atleast sorry. She gave me a look as if it was my mistake. The food is average in the first place and on top of that the service is bad. No wonder why it's always empty"}
{"text":"excellent mysore masala dosa and if you like super super spicy then the andra masala dosa is great! The $5.99 dosa deal cannot be beat. I go because of the super tasty and affordable dosa!"}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant for those south indian food cravings. Superb dosa and kothu very flavourful food. Portion size is very good too. I think this will be my new go to place in montreal for Dosa and Kothu"}
{"text":"Biriyani was dry and wasn't flavorful. The black pepper spice in the biriyani was too overpowering.  I also ordered an egg kothu which wasn't that good either. It was too bland to my liking. I wanted to order idly sambhar but they were out of that item that day. There are better Indian restaurants in Montreal so I wouldn't visit this again."}
{"text":"Most authentic South Indian food I have had in Montreal. Chennai Express is tucked in a small corner of an ordinary looking shop that hosts three other kitchens (Wok to Go &a Falafel Express) near Square Phillips. It's a very humble place, not not much space to sit, not the cleanest, and can be very suffocating due to the heat from three kitchens. But that's what makes this place even more appealing. The store is reminiscent of food courts back home (South Asia). Most of the customers are people of colour and speak the same language as the owners and the place is always crowded. Chennai Express is a family owned restaurant and the both the husband and wife are super friendly. They cook the food themselves while their son handles cash counter.   As for the food, everything we ordered was brilliant and really exceed expectations. We tried the lamb biryani which was freshly cooked right then. It was packed with rich spices and they did not compromise on the level of hotness. I feel the biryani could do with more salt though. The fish curry was super spicy, packed with curry leaf flavours and tasted as good as the ones back home (which is rare in a store in Montreal). The fish even had bones in it! The winner for me was the Dosa! I had a masala dosa and the potato filling and sambar was close to perfection !  I love how this place is so daringly authentic. They did not compromise with their culture and taste. I would recommend this place to anyone willing to try REAL South Indian food instead of the appropriated version you find at Super Quality (owned by three white dudes who spent three months in India). Please support more family owned businesses of colour like this one which actually makes a life for a lot of families."}
{"text":"I loved their south indian thali. The ven pongal was floating in ghee and the rotis were soft. Ample serving of white rice and paapad. They had a variety of poriyal and gravy. Definitely worth the money."}
{"text":"It's a crowded takeout place. They have good dosas. I had their fish curry with rice which was spicy and i loved it. It was authentic indian food. I also tried their lamb biryani which was also delicious and spicy for just around $8. They also serve Indian style coffee which made me nostalgic."}
{"text":"The lady in the counter is ridiculous.she is not polite at all.she should know what is meant by courtesy.eventhough the food is OK.we are not pleased with the reception"}
{"text":"Dosa variety is good. I tried the Myshore Masala dosa and it was good(one of the best I have eaten so far in the valley).  Me and my wife ordered meddu vada, dosa & Onion chili uttapam- vada was salty, oily and seemed to be not fresh. We didn't like it at all.  Other thing which we didn't like was the service- our dosa came in first(self service, though ) and had to wait for 15 minutes for the vada to come in and then another 10 minutes for the uttapam. One request to the management - we have visited there as a family, and hence we feel good when our food comes together and we enjoy our food together, rather than one eating alone."}
{"text":"So, where do I start? Well, last week, I went with a friend to Chennai Express to check it out. I give one star for the outside the shop and inside, as it appeared to be a very bright, colorful, and vibrant. Beautiful paintings of South Indian dancers, and pictures delicious Chennai style food on banana leaves decored the walls. However, as I approached the worker at the front, I had an unwelcomed look from him and some of the others there. Excited of having the chance to eat some of delicious South Indian food, I asked the cashier if they had Chicken 65 (a specialty finger food of Chennai, and other parts of Tamil Nadu). He just stared at me and said \"What!?, What is that? This is a vegetarian restaurant.\"   It then dawned on me that the owners were probably not from Chennai, but elsewhere. To top it off, there was a television playing Bollywood Hindi songs, where you would expect a Chennai or South Indian restaurant to play Tamil or Kollywood music instead, or even Telugu, or Malayalee songs. Anyways, I decide to take a menu home to check out, and wow! What an amazing selection of foods, more like an international fusion of confusion, or should I say a'mix-n-match' feel good cuisine. I saw items on the menu that never existed before in our cuisine, like 'North Indian Thali,' 'Mushroom Manchurian,' and 'Paneer Dosa!' No different than having having 'Mexican Hamburgers,' or 'Spam Sushi...'   Well, I decided to give them a try a week later today and brought my mother there. As usual, like most Indian restaurants, their lunch closed at 3:30 pm and were not to open till 5:30 pm for dinner, of which, I think they take a nap or something in between. Anyways, I give them another star for still serving us, when they were supposedly closed. As an adventurer of foods, I decided to try the Andhra Spicy Dosa. I asked one of the lady workers there what is the difference between Andhra and Chennai Dosa, and she told me that it is in the spicyness. Spicyness? I was under the impression it would be cooked with a slight different flavor. Looks like she already gave me a hint of what their food was going to be like.  Thinking we were going to get some authentically tasty South Indian food, we get what looked like left overs from a North Indian buffet along with the Dosai. There was even a Paneer dish with the Thali vegetarian plate we ordered, which is absent in South Indian cuisine. Each of the dishes, and including the Masala Dosai had raw red chili powder mixed into it.  As a matter of fact, we could not taste any flavor other than the hotness of the powder. When we asked the waiter for some water, he went up and got us some cheap plastic water tumbler with a couple of styraphone cups and placed it on the table. I felt we were at a picnic or something with our self serve for water, not it is like a big deal, but usually, a lot of other places usually do. Either, we were not welcomed there, or they have poor customer service.  On customer service, there was an Americano family that entered, thinking we worked there for some odd reason (I need not explain...), they asked us if we were opened! Lol, I told them, we do not work here, and that we were customers, and if they want, they can go to the back and talk the workers. Being closed, I supposed, all of the workers were in the back with the front door opened with no 'CLOSED,' sign. Anyways, the family looked around, and walked out. Talk about customer service...  Anyways, as we finished our lovely meal, the owner of the restaurant asked my mother where we were from. Really??? I thought we were all supposedly Indians. My mother then told him she was from Malaysia, and I told him that my former father was from Chennai. The owner then tole me, that their cook is from Chennai. Well, that is good to know... lol... He then spoke to me in Hindi, and then asked me in English if the food was good. Hindi??? Uh, hello, Hindi is not spoken in Chennai, or other parts of South India, it is Tamil, even though Hindi is supposedly the official language of India, but is predominantly spoken in North India. It is obvious that when you advertise a restaurant called 'Chennai Express,' you are going to get Tamil customers, or should I say 'Chennai' people...  Turns out that the owners were were from Punjab, North India who also own the Delhi Palace next door, both restaurants are connected, go figure... My personal advice, if you want really authentic South Indian food, have it home cooked at a South Indian friends home. That is about as good as it is going to get. Otherwise, I would recommend you to try Delhi Palace instead for some real authentic North Indian food, which obviously is served with some TLC at least."}
{"text":"The best! But avoid Biryani... South Indian delicacies are the best!! I loved warm idlis!"}
{"text":"Extremely spicy food. I guess everything had spec in it. Had the Mysore masala dosa and medu vada. The side of sambar and tomato chutney was also spicy"}
{"text":"Pleasant surprise in downtown Montreal. We went into this nondescript indian restaurant without expecting much. All we wanted was a quick bite to eat. We were blown away by the flavorful food. Chicken curry and Chicken sukka dishes are really awesome and can be prepared to one's spice specifications upon request. The Biryani is good too. We ended up going there multiple times during our 10 day visit. The person who runs the place seems very hardworking and a genuine nice guy. 5 stars."}
{"text":"Ordered a chilli panner and found out that the food has \"hair\" in it. Service is awful. They are very rude."}
{"text":"The best place to have dosa , i dont think so any other place offerining dosa for $5 ,they have good thali as well and carrot halwa is my favorite ........worthy and finding the satisfaction and finding fulfillment in continuosuly serving food with same taste  to eat every time u walk in  is really great .  we feel chennai express as our home and we became so close to every one intheir that we cant end our day without  visting them."}
{"text":"South Indian food is one of my favorite. I saw Chennai Express thru the Yelp list. Finally, I went to order my food. The place is situated in the middle of downtown. It's a mini food court with three (Lebanese, Asian and South Indian) resto counters. There is bar table with four and five stools. It was lunch time; the place was booming with customers. When we got in; my first issue was the hygiene, but it is so busy, the food must be special, so I try not think about it.   The lineup was busy and long, I think it took 20 minutes to get to the cash to give my order. Finally I ordered paneer masala dosa, a special of the day. Then it took another 15 minutes to get my food. There is only one cook and one person at the counter. Going back to hygiene. The cook is wearing a hair net but the cashier who serves the sauce on the side, doesn't it. That bothered me a lot.   Finally, I got my food, I went across to the park, joined my friends, and ate my dosa. Despite the long wait and my concern of hygiene, the food was very delicious."}
{"text":"Best (Massala) dosa I ever got!!! Same for the Idlies, and accompanying sauces. Will definitely make this place one of my systematic stop when I am in Montreal!!"}
{"text":"I had been to Chennai Express last night. As another yelper said the location is amiss if you don't closely look. The entrance says ' Falafel Express ' in the front. Get in right there. Also, since most of the reviews said there r 3 kitchens etc etc. I'm not going there. At the look of it, for a newbie like me, you'd be surprised. But, yelpers do not give up on u, do they ? Just as the reviews, the food is AMAZING !!! I ordered the mutton varuval, fish curry, chicken biryani. The rice wasn't available, else I would've skipped the biryani. I got the Naan instead of rice. The owner is a humble person and cooks up a quick chat while you are there. The line to this joint was getting longer in the short time I was there. I ordered mine and came up to grab a seat. While at it, the customers around me were busy gulping their dosas ! Man, the aroma was mind blowing and being a south Indian myself, I make pretty good dosas myself.. But, did I tell you I couldn't resist the aroma ?! Guess, what happened next, I went ahead and ordered a shrimp dosa to go. Yea, a foodie to the dot. He was more than happy to accommodate it quickly into my menu. The wait was quite a while, but who cares when u can sit there and breathe in the aromas from the kitchen and be assured that all your food is being freshly prepared. I wouldn't mind. I sat up and chat with a few fellow countrymen.. ;) My order was ready and I left with an eagerness to taste the food soon. My kids ( even my 4 year old ) loveddd the food. The fish curry reminded me of home ! Thank you, for that. We were traveling to Quebec after that, so I refrigerated the curry and had it the next day. Tasted even better as we are told back home, biryani and fish curry tastes yummier the next week ! How I wish we had a joint like this near my home. It was my anniversary and we had a scrumptious finish to it. Thanks, Chennai Express for making it happier ! Anyone around this place, do check it out ! You won't regret it at all.."}
{"text":"Damn good food - yet a very different experience than what I had in mind. We went there on a Monday evening before catching a movie. We have heard good things about the food from an Indian friend and had a restaurant in mind.  Yet, in reality this is not really a restaurant - it's a space shared by three different take-out kitchens, and there is a narrow table at the entrance with bar stools for people who eat there.  There were three of us and it was not the most comfortable way to sit and talk, but at least we didn't come as a big group :) We got butter chicken, chicken curry, paratha, nan, and uttapam. Everything was very well cooked. The owner was extremely nice, and brought our trays to us at the 'table'. The mango lassie was OK, and served well to sooth the burning sensation after having the spicy chicken curry.  They also allowed us to go through the kitchen to the toilet in the back to wash our hands - there are no other alternatives. Overall a positive experience - I might be back for take-out, but probably won't be back to hang out with friends there.    Tip: They have Thali for lunch - but not for dinner."}
{"text":"I am here at least once a week if tno more. The great dosas on sales for 5.99 are reason enough to go. From the decadent and crips ghee roast doasa to the delicate and flavorful rava dosa they have it. Each dosa comes with a side of sambar and chutneys. Should you run out of sambar they will gladly give you more.  The menu has many other south indian treats, so far the only other item I have tried was the mushroom Manchurian. Crisp ad spicy it was everything you could want."}
{"text":"I visit this restaurant very often since it is close to where I live. The food is amazing, my favorite dishes here are Mysore Masala Dosa, Chana Bhatura and the Samosa Chat! A word of caution: The food can be very spicy depending on what you order.  The ambience and service are not that great and could use some improvement, but the delicious food sort of makes up for it!"}
{"text":"Excellent home-cooked South Indian food walking distance from Old Town. We enjoyed the fresh hot idli and vadas (fried lentil donuts) for lunch. And the hot sambhar was especially tasty and perfect with the rain outside. Great for vegetarians and vegans, and very affordable!"}
{"text":"They're great for South Indian dishes and serve it within the food court itself. The place itself is very limited and is quite small as it shares space with another 2 food stalls which is falafel express and the other Chinese food. For the amount of food you get, the price is not too bad. Just one thing I'd say is to be careful with the curries and foods as I found a hair in mine and I was disgusted by it. Probably will never return to this place."}
{"text":"I ordered the South Indian thali . The portions were very generous and the dosa is really big and tasty !! Definitely recommend this place !!"}
{"text":"One of the worst place to get indian food. The minimum wait time is 45 min to 1hr 30 min. The attitude is horrible and arrogant. It is a small corner shop which is actually sharing with 2 other food corners.  I kept asking the guy do you like yo take order , he is just out of his place and never took order. Don't go and waste of your time"}
{"text":"Excellent authentic South Indian food.  Lovely fluffy idles.  Very friendly nice to talk to manager. Highly recommended if you're looking for authentic homely safe on your tummy South Indian food."}
{"text":"Been here like tonnes of times. Amazing vegetarian options on the menu. Ordered -  Rava Dosa : prolly the only place I know that makes Rava Dosa in phx. Tasted great and less oily just like  how I wanted it to be. Vegetable Noodles : this was a highlight amongst all the food I ordered. Tasted delicious and did not like peas in it though. Idli Vada : did not taste fresh and vada wasn't crispy. I can't complain coz this is a breakfast item and I ordered during lunch. Aloo tikki chaat: simply the best.  Pani puri : not worth spending money on this though.  This place stands close to a 4 star but isn't. I'm flooring down the rating to 3.  Decent ambience and if you don't mind some random music, this is the best south Indian place in proximity."}
{"text":"This place is hidden gem for South Indian food lovers. Delicious food at such a low price. I tried their Masala Dosa, Mendu wada and Idly Sambhar. Given the South Indian staff Sambhar is very authentic and tasty. I was a bit turned off by Butter Chicken Thali otherwise would definitely recommend. Four stars since seating arrangement is very limited."}
{"text":"This is an authentic Indian restaurant. The family owns this business and they cook your dishes themselves. At the beginning, you might think that this hole within a hole in the wall might be a bit sketchy, but trust me it's worth it venturing out of your comfort zone. Their Masalas are God sent: crispy on the outside and tasty on the inside.... yum also their Biriyanis get sold out FAST so get one when you can. Overall, if you're looking for some authentic Indian/Pakistani food, Chennai Express will definitely satisfy your cravings."}
{"text":"I have only tried dosa here and all them were very good, they have $5 Dosa special going on since they opened, so it's a good deal. I am giving them 3 stars for the service. My husband and I went there Sunday for lunch at 1pm and they were very busy. THEY CANNOT HANDLE BIG CROWDS. My husband and I wanted to order more food after we finished what we ordered initially and the server said \"you can save that for next time because we are very busy\". My jaw literally dropped. They need to learn basic customer service and implement a better system of ordering and serving food."}
{"text":"Such a cute, clean, affordable place to get cheap, FRESH MADE South Indian food. Everything is made right as you order it, so it might be a bit of a wait, but it's so worth it for fresh, authentic South Indian food!"}
{"text":"The owner of this restaurant has one of the ugliest attitude i have ever seen, you usually walk up to the counter at this place and order so when i went there the owner who was present at the counter took literally 5 mins to talk to me because he was fighting with someone on the phone, they are super slow and have no clue wtf is going on at their shitty place. There was no customer service and the owner who is like half bald is super rude. This is not it!!, when the bhatura arrived i found a hair on my bhatura and i just felt like leaving right away for that shitty bhatura, go on your own risk !"}
{"text":"I go here pretty often. Love the food and the service. Also, the environment is pretty refresing and warm, so you can unwind and let your thoughts wander.  For the few people arguing here about authenticity, I would say this is most definitely authentic south indian!! But yea, it seems more like andhra than chennai. Well, im a big fan of spicy andhra food :)  Also, the chole bhatoore here has got just no comparison!! So yummy..."}
{"text":"**Vegetarian Friendly**  South Indian food is probably my least favorite type of Indian food, but my family insisted on going here. I could not believe how much I enjoyed the meal! We ordered and had food served to us in under 15 minutes.   We ordered a variety of items: Idli with sambar, rava masala dosa, sada dosa, and paneer dosa. The idli was perfectly soft and the sambar complemented perfectly. All of the dosas were served with a generous serving of chutney and sambar. Everything was perfectly crispy. The best part of the dosas was that they weren't oily at all! Normally I go through a handful of napkins but I barely needed one.  Their prices made it even better - every dosa was $5."}
{"text":"Husband and I spent a week in Montreal for some work, and we didn't expect to find much good Indian food there let alone South Indian food. We went there for lunch 2 times during our stay and were reasonably suprised and pleased with both the quality of the food and the taste. The masala dosas were top notch. It is a small eatery shared with other vendors, with a few seats so be ready to take your food out and eat. Busy around lunch time and lots of people were getting thalis which looked great. Overall would visit again if in the Montreal area."}
{"text":"Food is good. Carrot Halwa was very good!!!A place near to ASU campus for authentic South Indian vegetarian cuisine. It is a self service restaurant. Since they are new, they have to improve in organizing the process. It becomes messy when crowd hits the restaurant...!!!"}
{"text":"Quality food! My husband were here for lunch on Saturday, and ordered a South Indian Thali and mango lassi. The Thali had three vegetable dishes, Sambar, Rasam, Pongal, Rice, Chapati/Dosa, Curd and Gulab Jamun. Everything tastes good and quantity was sizable.  Pricing is on par with other Indian restaurants, though I find all Indian restaurants being slightly overpriced! Nevertheless, good food is worth it!"}
{"text":"Decent food. Not authentic by any means as I think the chef is not from the south, and the flavors quite don't live up to ones I grew up in Chennai. Everything is a bit unnecessarily spicy, even sambar. I think they confuse food from Chennai to one in hyderabad where everything is spiced up and hot, have no idea. So kinda all of it taste similar and the price isn't cheap by any means. The service is not professional yet, but people there are very helpful. I am a student so being accessible near ASU is the major plus. There is much better Indian( south Indian) food in the valley if you can travel and bear to stay hungry for a while."}
{"text":"The food was very sumptuous and authentic with generous portions. Quick service and friendly staff. Will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Excellent Indian food. Both northern and southern specialties are offered, I loved the South Indian Thali"}
{"text":"I tried my first mango lassi for the first time. I enjoyed the thick consistency and mango flavor. I am only docking two stars because of the customer service. The man behind the counter was unfriendly and did not seem enthusiastic to conduct business. After I made my order, he made a phone call before I could pay. I may or may not give Chennai Express another shot. I was really looking forward to exploring the tastes of their menu."}
{"text":"It was good food I'm used to more Americanized Indian food such curry corner or Taj Mahal this is super authentic South Indian food so there is a menu on the wall but it doesn't go in detail what each item is luckily the counter girl was super friendly and patient explained the food and gave us recommendations yummy food very authentic"}
{"text":"We found this on yelp diring a recent visit to Montreal. We were delighted! The masala dosas were outstanding. There is no place to sit except at bar stools in a corner but the food was worth it"}
{"text":"Food is okay for price but hospitality wise and hygiene wise they are very irresponsible. I saw my food items being handled carelessly before being served and when requested for fresh food was told bluntly that they cannot replace the food item and I have to eat what was given! Food is not authentic as well, you will be much better off paying a few extra cents at chutneys on Baseline & McClintock than eating here! We could not even finish our food half way through the meal. Bad place, will not return again."}
{"text":"A very dingy restaurant! The food was below average. Sambhar was super sour and Vadas were rock hard. Price is also steep for the quality of food. Silverware was dirty and when pointed this to the owner, he just ignored."}
{"text":"I like South Indian food and have been meaning to try this place but unfortunately the number listed on Yelp is incorrect. Many unanswered phone calls later we decided to see if this place was for real and Yes it is.  Chennai Express is right next to Delhi palace on university drive.I think both restaurants are owned by the same person. We walked in for lunch,the place was not very crowded we ordered at the counter and the food got to the table in 10 minutes which is great.  ~South Indian Thali $9.95 (rice,sambar,rasam,three vegetables,papad and sweet curd) ~paneer Dosa $8.95 (crispy crepe stuffed with cottage cheese served with sambar and two varieties of chutney) ~Masala chaas $2.95 (spiced buttermilk)  The South Indian thali was filing and they gave me a masala dosa with it which was the high point for me.The paneer dosa and buttermilk were okay. I also got some gulab jamun Yummy!  The staff is friendly and they have a $5 any dosa offer which is definitely hard to find in the valley.  PS I have posted a picture of their business card which has the Correct Number.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"Very very bad service. Took about an hour to get our order. Unapologetic staff. Said a particular item was not available but heard them call out the same for people who came after us."}
{"text":"Good food, lovely service, and Bollywood music in the background to boot. What more could you ask for?!"}
{"text":"Je recommande fortement ce petit resto  (IL u a qq chaises). Le poulet biryani est formidable, épicé et délicieux. J'ai aussi manage le poulet curry - la sauce était magnifique, crémeux et comme on a en Inde. Prix excellent.  This Indian place is probably one of the best South Indian places downtown. I love having their chicken curry and especially the chicken biryani. And the coffee is hot and sweet Indian style...Love this place. Not at expensive, most stuff is btw $5-$10. Good place for quick Indian food"}
{"text":"Authentic masala dosa I had here and credit goes to the chutney that comes with it! Very friendly folks and ran into a long conversation with the lead of the restaurant! Highly recommend a shot at it and located in the heart of the downtown Montreal!"}
{"text":"This is a take out review....   The place is cozy and suitable for takeouts. The menu has pure South Indian delicacy. The menu is gluten free, vegetarian n vegan friendly.   Got couple of idlis as I had a heavy lunch. This place was super packed and we had to wait for one hour just to get idlis....  Taste is really good felt it homemade, the price too is right."}
{"text":"The place has good, hot South Indian dishes. Service is fast, but less friendly. I like idli vada the most here as it makes you feel full and has less oil. Other than that, the restaurant has people coming from all regions of India and so a good meeting place of the North and South of India!"}
{"text":"Not great, not bad. Just your average South Indian Diner that doesn't get the sambar or chutneys right. Poor ambience, zero smiles from the person behind the counter and moderate pricing for the average food. Go here if you are craving Indian Food and have absolutely no other place that you can go to."}
{"text":"Best Dosa!! Felt like having a home made food. Had very good South Indian dishes after long time and menu looks really nice. Sure will be back to try other varieties"}
{"text":"The food flavour is excellent , but the wait is too long, and the hygiene is very low. I got a piece of wire in my lamb biryani  And the guy told me that the chicken biryani will take 40 minutes and pushed me to take the lamb.  Lamb biryani was ok Butter chicken tastes very good but he didn't give me any bread   Piece of wire ruined it all   Gave 2 stars coz butter chicken tasted good   Sorry that I had to wait for the food for 30 minutes that was not even clean."}
{"text":"I eat a lot of indian food here in Montreal, yet I was surprised that about half of Chennai Express' menu was totally unfamiliar to me. Rather than sticking with more standard fare (dosas and byrianias), I branched out and tried some of dishes that were new to me.  I started with a pair of Medu Vada, a kind of savoury donut often served at breakfast. Actually, the donut comparison isn't apt. The dough in the Vada - lentil flour? - is more hearty than donut insides, and much less sweet. The Vada tasted wholesome, and not the least bit like junk food, despite being friend.  The coconut chutney, served on the side, added a spicy kick.  For my main dish, I had a Sambar Idli. Sambar is a soup, and the Idli are dumplings that float in it and absorb its flavour. As with the Vada, it was both tasty and filling, and had a gamut of spices that were subtly novel for my Canadian pallet.  The Vada and Sambar Idli definitely both \"keepers\". I'm excited to go back and try everything else!  Seating is limited to a half-dozen bar stools at a wall-mounted counter."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I just ate an unbelievably tasty meal from Chennai Express at University and Rural. And somehow there are several meals of leftovers. How is this even possible?? And it came with the best dosa we've ever had!"}
{"text":"This is a takeout review. We were visiting Montreal and after a long day we didn't want to drive down from downtown to get South Indian food. So I made a quick walk to checkout this place after reading its reviews on yelp. We got a lot to eat though . Masala dosa was good , paneer Masala dosa was OK as they had only sprinkled paneer on it, egg Kothu parotta was good, chicken pepper fry was AMAZING, idli was decent. My wife loved mango lassi but I am sure that was not made by them. Overall, a sumptuous feast on cold February night. We asked them make all of the items spicy , so my review maybe skewed.  The wait time was 30 minutes but given the number of items ordered , it was understandable. One tip I would give is to make them move their refrigerator inside where they keep dough and chutney or anything which is needed for kitchen and only have cold drinks out. Even though it is a small corner they could keep it clean and tidy. It is not easy to keep an Indian kitchen clean, however that could encourage a lot more people to try out this spot. I saw a guy who ordered in the Lebanese spot and wanted to get some from them as well but turned away as soon as he saw Chennai express kitchen and said Nope."}
{"text":"Tried Mysore Masala Dosa, Paneer Dosa and Rava Masala Dosa. Taste doesn't come close to home, but $5, I cant complain. As many noted more of Andhra taste. OK to try if you are craving to eat Dosas. Mysore Masala was best comparatively, paneer coming second."}
{"text":"Hands down the BEST masala dosa I've ever had (and I've had great dosa in metro Detroit and Queens, NY). The potato curry is so delicious; the dosa is the perfect texture; and the sambar is outstanding. Just a sublime combination of flavors. Staff is very friendly.   Gets super busy at lunch, so I come in the afternoon when the wait is not long. Only counter seating available, so if you come during busy hours, it might be tough to find a seat as they share the counter with 2 other food establishments in the same complex.  The place is easy to miss. It's across from Burger King and in the same complex as Wok to Go and a falafel place."}
{"text":"Chennai Express is located in a mini-food court that is not the cleanest. The seating is awkward and cramped, its location attracts some riffraff, and there's a considerable wait time to be served. Butttt the food is authentic and delicious, and the staff is nice and helpful. I ate the paneer masala dosa there, and took a veggie biryani and fish curry to go. Everything was seasoned well, but not quite spicy enough even though I asked for it to be spicy. So make sure to ask for everything extra extra spicy if you really want to feel the fire."}
{"text":"It serves pretty decent traditional South Indian dosas and idlis. They come with the sambar and two chutneys - green and red, both good. I've tried several types of dosas and all are worth trying. It also has $5-any-dosa offer going on most of the time which makes it cheaper and preferable than other South Indian restos. The dosas are more filling than idlis at the same price. The ambience is ok but the dosas are totally worth a visit. It also offers a North Indian Thali which is pretty delicious and value for money. But its made in the restaurant adjacent to it \"Delhi Palace\". Its better to order the Thali from Delhi Palace since you can customize it and take advantage of ASU student discount."}
{"text":"Really big surprise here !!! Very tasty good portions and honest price. Its a little place same adress shared with 2 more fast food restos to take out or to eat in the little corner.  Very good food. Nice service. Come for lunch because at evening they already sold out almost all the food of the day.."}
{"text":"Good South Indian food. They have all the usual stuff - Dosas, Idlis, Thali Meals etc."}
