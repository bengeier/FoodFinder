{"text":"Had a good time, drinks are pricy, comedy show was dope. It's really refreshing that they support local comedy and starting businesses. Good community spot. Lower the price of the drinks playa, agree to that and I'll give 4 stars"}
{"text":"Great place! The music is old school and the sound system is just right. Small stage that had a \"dancer\" where one of VIP tables were...that was pretty different..a good different. For a smaller venue with a fairly large bar, I would've hoped there would've been more than two bartenders as the wait was pretty sorry. At an average of $10 a drink (try them...most seem to have dry ice of something like it in it) you'd be close to want to leave if the DJ wasn't Great! Have fun cause its worth trying out."}
{"text":"I'm new here and was looking for a place like home,came here and found it. I loved the music it was clean a friendly environment. Even the guy at the door was funny..I like it and will be back"}
{"text":"More like a spot for my moms and her friends.. came on a Saturday night, not sure how the other days are. Good music tho... won't be returning."}
{"text":"City lights is a local spot that has a lot of locals and visitors.  The spot has good food and good bartenders.  The owner is known for throwing great New Years Eve parties ..... I love them.  The music I like.  they have a Halloween party every year that seems pretty interesting and fun.  I am not from Las Vegas but I do visit.  I took my husband one time and he really enjoyed him self.  It got crowded though because the owner sponsored a concert and the after party was at City Lights. Oh and they have TV's with sports...."}
{"text":"we went to this place for my father's 60th birthday party.  there were about 25 of us so it was pretty tight where we were sitting.  the place is not big and not small either.  

this is an  adult club (grown folks) and the music was old school and new school.  none of that \"trap\" or \"bouncing music\".  it was a nice balance and really enjoyed myself.  

the drinks are okay and somewhat strong.  i got the adios mf so i was feeling good.  and because my mind tell me that everytime i go to a bar i have to eat......the catfish nuggets were delicious?  i also begged for a piece of chicken from the rest of the people that were with us and they are pretty good also. 

i will be returning as i had a really nice time.  if you want to have a good time, dance, listen to music, and don't have the rift raft of the youngsters.....this is a place to try."}
{"text":"I brought 2 of my friends from out of town in for a comedy night. We had the best time! Drinks were reasonable and the comedians were hilarious! Shout out to Donnie & AK, hands down 2 of the funniest comedians in Las Vegas. Not only will I return, I'll bring more friends!"}
{"text":"we had a fabulous time you are awesome Host. Your bartender Nyia should be rated number one bartender in Las Vegas...  She rocks....   the food is awesome you made my girls birthday on point thanks for a great night....   Love your spot!!!!!

The smoke free environment makes the experience even better.   The DJ was on point the music was so good he was spending and mixing like no other....

Looking for many more nights at your establishment thanks Jimmy Jay!!!!!"}
{"text":"Friday night, over 1 1/2 hrs and finally got a drink , weak .....the dj though was awesome...food took forever also :(...seemsclike the place could be good butttttttttttt"}
{"text":"Based on recommendation from local friends in Vegas, we celebrated here for my wife's birthday after dinner. When we first walked in and recognized the venue as more of a lounge than a club, we had reservations.  And the music was average when we walked in.  Well...the manager got our group (about 16-18 people) a marked off spot, the real DJ came in and this place got poppin. Local crowd was good to be with...they know how to party, the DJ had us dancing all night and we even ordered a little food later on during the night which hit the spot. Good spot to get away from the Vegas Strip hooplah, party with some locals and do the damn thing! Thanks City Lights! Yall are part of the Birthday memories!"}
{"text":"Hidden Gem, now I've driven past this place a hundred times and I will say I've  been missing out. Now it's not a big place but it's got room to dance and the D.J. was on point playing a mix of hip,hop & R&B. Don't  get  me wrong  Saturday  nights it's  a place for the Grown and Sexy. Beautiful plus 30 crowd who are all about having a good time.  so don't  So don't  bring your vans you better dress to impress because  the dress code is  strictly  enforced  This place is a definite  must check out if your in Vegas looking for a spot to chill off the strip. I will most definitely  be back."}
{"text":"Go to their FB page to find out what's going on.  Something going on 7 days a week.
It's not an upscale fancy place, it's just a nice little venue for a good time.  Nice older crowd, good ole school music.  Staff was friendly.  I think everyday is free admission except for comedy night.  I'm not sure the cost or what day comedy night is.  Call for details."}
{"text":"I had a nice time celebrating at the club. My only issue it that the well drinks are very strong with cheap liquor. If you use less liquor you can afford to buy a better grade of liquor."}
{"text":"This place was pretty good! If you want to hold a good social event or just to hang out. It's pretty dark inside with black floors and black walls makes it feels like you're walking into a haunted house , you're waiting for someone to jump out at ya. It is pretty small and could use a little TLC inside. It's not too bad of a place I didn't really feel uncomfortable or anything, the area surroundings is not in a great spot."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised by this place.  It's not the most upscale place but it is a little hole in the wall.  Nice bartenders but the food....the food is real good.  We had the catfish and chicken strips with 2 martinis for $36.  Reasonably price!  
It's a small place with a more \"mature\" crowd.  We were there on a Friday night.  They play good hip hop."}
