{"text":"This place must have gotten their act together since the other reviewers visited, cause the service was excellent. Food was ok, not spectacular, but great (and good portions) for the price.   Had the Thai Coconut Soup, Roti Canai, Mango Salad, Butter Garlic Oysters, and Panang Beef Curry and all of it was fair to good."}
{"text":"I thought it was clean relative to most other chinatown restaurants, although my mom always said \"never eat at a place that isn't busy!!\" since that means the \"locals\" probably know something you don't.  My friend and I went there anyways even though there weren't too many people there and I absolutely loved their calamari.  They also have a really awesome looking rice dish which is served inside a pineapple.  On the downside, service WAS a bit slow despite the lack of customers, and the server didn't understand much english (and I didn't understand much thai!)  But what can you do, after all it was chinatown.  I would actually go there again, but ONLY for the calamari."}
{"text":"Laksa is a new restaurant in Toronto's Chinatown. They serve mostly Thai food, but there is also a second, smaller menu with some Malaysian dishes.  I scoped out the place while on vaca and I was not impressed at all. With a name like \"Laksa\", you'd think they'd be able to provide a decent laksa dish, but boy was I wrong. The flavor was bland and very uninspiring. The fish cake appetizers that I order looked like they came from a frozen package. And to top it off, the table next to me had all sorts of issues with there food, from hair in their noodles to mysterious objects in pork.  Skip this place at all cost."}
{"text":"Not impressed. That can describe how I felt within 15 minutes of being in this restaurant. And I can tell you why you should go here for 3 simple reasons:  1) Slow, inefficient service. They didn't come take our orders or offer us water for about 10 minutes. Not okay. Then they brought my dish to the table next to me by mistake, then when they realized it, simply picked the plate up and relocated it. Gross.   2) Bland, boring, yucky food. My \"spicy\" noodles were the least spicy things I have ever tasted -- I can only imagine what someone from Thailand would have thought of this place. The noodles were also greasy and covered in a strange slimy sauce. Enough said.  3) Again with the service. Getting someone's attention to bring us the bill was more difficult than stomaching the food.  The place looks nicer than most other Chinatown joints but don't be fooled -- you can get better food and service almost anywhere else."}
