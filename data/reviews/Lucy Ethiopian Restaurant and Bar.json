{"text":"When we walked in, we were greeted by the owner and the most humble server I've ever met. The place is well designed, clean and had the right Ethiopian vibe with a modern touch. It's also very spacious. We were given the menus promptly and our server came back shortly to check. He took our order and even offered juice for our toddler... Excellent service.

The food was great. Most importantly, it was authentic. We started with the Sambusa appetizer followed by the Beef Combination and Quanta Firfir. The Sambusas were made to order and came out crispy and hot. The combination was plenty and delicious! The Quanta was one of the best we've ever had.

The owners including the chef came to check on us regularly and offered anything to make the meal more enjoyable. They even asked for feedback.

Definitely coming back again!"}
{"text":"We had a great time checking out this new spot in Old Brooklyn. We arrived around 1pm for lunch and were greeted by friendly staff who helped explain the menu options. A couple of us had eaten Ethiopian food previously but the rest of our party had not. The service was speedy and the food was delicious; meats and vegetarian options were well prepared and had some heat. Although this place could use some attention when it comes to curb appeal, the inside was clean and well taken care of. It has an event hall vibe, so it's not exactly what you might expect, but overall this was a really fun dining experience. Glad to have this place in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Newly opened and as such, things need a bit more refining.
The first time I had Ethiopian food was in Wisconsin. This is my second time having it. 

The decor is pretty interesting. They have a few tables and also some traditional straw table set up though I'm not sure if you can use it.
They have Ethiopian music videos playing on a TV.

The service was a bit slow. It took a while for a server to come and take our order and it took about 30 minutes for the food to come out.
We ordered the beef combo platter and just cause, a basket of chicken tenders with fries. 

You get a basket of injera and a large platter with about a couple spoonfuls of salad, lentils, cottage cheese and two beef dishes - kaywat and tibs - on top of a large injera. We were missing the collard greens. The portions are definitely not as pictured on their website.
Everything tasted like it did in Wisconsin. The tibs were really good. I can't really comment much on the other stuff but my partner said he liked everything.

The chicken tenders and fries were fresh and tasty though the portion was a bit disappointing compared to the 7.99 price. I'm not sure if they usually don't give you any sauce for the tenders but I wasn't offered any and also had to ask for ketchup.

I wrote this review while waiting for the check. I think it's been about 17 minutes since we finished eating and the server took our dishes away.

They offer coffee ceremonies as well and I'm guessing our server is busy performing that.

All in all, they definitely will have to go through some growing pains to improve service and speed. The server also looked super timid more than anything which makes me think she was inexperienced. It would be nice to have some napkin dispensers on each table since you do eat with your hands. 

Hopefully things get better with time and I hope they become a special place to experience something new in Old Brooklyn."}
{"text":"Last week, I brought a small group of coworkers here for their first-ever Ethiopian food experience.  The restaurant is sparsely decorated and is attached to a bar-like area, and they have another area that appears like a stage where live entertainment must occur.

Our server was very friendly and after a bit of deliberation she helped us settle on two combination platters (one beef and one chicken) and a single order of lamb alicha (for the four of us).

The meal was served within a large (traditional) wicker basket lined with injera and came full of meat and vegetable dishes.  An additional basket of injera was brought to the table and we all dug in.  The beef dishes were great...kaywat and tibs, and the chicken was my second favorite.  There was a large variety of vegetable items, but my clear favorite was the mild (red) lentils...I could not get enough of them!  The yellow split peas were also quite tasty.

I am not a huge lamb fan, but the person at our table that ordered the dish had a grand old time gnawing on the huge lamb shank that came with the dish.

Wish we had enough time for a coffee ceremony, but we were due back at the office.  We'll have to save it for the next time we visit!"}
{"text":"This was a wonderful meal! The staff was congenial and friendly, and generously assisted us with ordering and even offered to bring us more food if we were still hungry after eating what we ordered. Have now eaten at every Ethiopian spot in Cleveland, and this is the favorite. The coffee ceremony was delightful, special, and delicious, and was served to us by the same woman who prepared our food. It felt like a family who cared deeply for the food they created.  Highly recommend, will certainly go back."}
{"text":"Love this family-run business in the OB (Old Brooklyn). Others have mentioned the timing of customer service (aka slower) - this is a place to come and enjoy a leisurely meal with a group of friends. We came with a larger group of 10 on a Sunday evening and we enjoyed the time spent with one another over food. 

The food here is delicious. I ordered the veggie combo - it comes with an extra basket of injera so there is plenty of food to go around. I had leftovers for the next day. Everything was very flavorful, particularly the lentils. I could eat the lentils every day... I won't be able to comment on the meat combos, though everyone who did order it seemed to enjoy them.

Decor-wise, the place is casual and colorful with Ethiopian decor. There are TVs that play Ethiopian music videos or sports. Very laid back vibe - enjoy your time here!"}
{"text":"Delicious.  We were the first of the dinner crowd on a Saturday night.  We ordered the chicken combo and a lamb dish..  We also scored a couple sambusas.  I'm not a good judge of spice, but to me the meal was quite mild but very flavorful. The service was very good.  She was very pleasant and offered to explain things if we had questions.  No the food did not come out fast, but certainly not slow.  If you want to walk up, order and have mediocre good slopped out in a few minutes I would say try the olive garden.  For delicious authentic food that may take a bit, but will be worth the wait check this place out. I hear they have big things planned for music and a buffet,  I'll definitely be back to check that out."}
{"text":"This was our introduction to Ethiopian food, and we had a great time!  Our server was fun, friendly, and very helpful in guiding us and offering suggestions.  We had one of the combination plates, and it was more than enough for the two of us.  There is also parking in back."}
{"text":"Went here on a Sunday in Feb after the West Side Market (because sadly Steve's gyros in the market was closed) with brothers, sisters and a gaggle of nieces and nephews (2 thru 13 years old)
My wife and I have eaten Ethiopian food many times, but none of the fam have ever tried it.
At first glance the restaurant looks like a bar (which after some conversation with the owner, we found out that it used to be a small Latin dance club).  The dining room decor is simple with traditional decorations.
The owner and waitress happily put tables and chairs together to accommodate us all.
This is the only Ethiopian restaurant that I've ever seen with a kids menu.  Home run for us!  Kids ate chicken fingers and burgers while we ordered a whole assortment of dishes for everyone to try.
The Dorot Wat was outstanding as well as the Lamb Wat.  Beef Alichaw was a huge hit with everyone.  The misir wat was a fave as well.
We ordered the dishes with mild spice so the kids could try it if they wanted to.  They brought out two sides of berbere spice to jazz it up for the adults.
The service was excellent; they could not be more accommodating 
They brought us all off to the side after dinner for a traditional coffee ceremony.  They roasted green coffee beans right in front of us then brewed it up and served it!  The kids thought that was \"awesome\"
All in all one of the better dining experiences I've had in a long long time.  I travel for a living and eat out at least 3 times a week.  This was one of the best Ethiopian places I've been to and I've been to a bunch in various cities around the globe.
I would highly recommend Lucy's to anyone that wants to try Ethiopian for the first time or for a seasoned vet.  Follow them on FaceBook to see when they are starting their buffet. Good way to try a little bit of everything"}
{"text":"In a nutshell: it's worth going to try the food, but only if you're not in a hurry or expecting a great service experience.

The first impression when I walked in was unpleasant, my friend and I actually considered leaving. We were confused as to where to sit, as half of the place is a traditional bar with TV, while the restaurant half was empty without any servers. The bartender did not greet us or offer up any help as we clearly wavered. We went ahead and sat at the bar first, where we were very much ignored. When we finally got her attention, and were told to sit wherever we want -- we made sure to sit far away from her in the restaurant section.

Once a server showed up with menus -- after another awkward, unsure wait -- things finally started to pick up. He was very friendly, and made solid recommendations since neither my friend nor I had eaten Ethiopian food.

While I don't have another reference to compare it to, I enjoyed the food the well enough. We split the beef combination platter, and found the Tibs and Kaywat tasty. I liked the former best, the latter is a bit like spicy sloppy joes. Collar greens were good, too, but I wasn't a big fan of the yellow split peas. The Injera bread you eat with is just tolerable -- very spongy. And the salad is just a small pile of lettuce.

It's worth noting they do have more traditional American bar food such as burgers, chicken fingers and nachos on their menu as well, which goes well with the bar half of the restaurant. We ordered chicken fingers and fries as a just-in-case backup, and had no complaints there. The chicken tenders were quality white meat and quite crispy.

Overall, we were underwhelmed by the service and atmosphere, and a bit overwhelmed by the unfamiliar menu. But I'm still glad we tried this place -- good, new food, and a new local business that will hopefully find it's way and improve. I'd give it another chance..... on a slow night when I'm not that hungry."}
{"text":"I love Ethiopian food. Lucy Restaurant is the epitome of this refined East African cuisine. The owner and staff are hospitable and friendly. My wife and I go there every chance we get, despite the long distance from home. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Yay! My first Ethiopian adventure was a success!! This place might be in a slightly strange location, but my experience inside was CLEAN and PLEASANT and most importantly TASTY. Our server was a ray of sunshine. The chef came over to deliver the food and say hi as well. Her name is Agree (or more likely is pronounced like Agree and spelled some way I don't know).

I honestly don't know what exactly I ate that came on the beef combo platter... but I highly recommend it! Now be prepared with clean hands because Ethiopian food involves eating with your hands. You use the injera to pick up the various foods. Food is also served on injera. The injera is like a sponge-y flatbread, and slightly sour. I'm into it! I love that you can essentially eat your plate. 

I also got something called Ethiopian Honey Wine. It is very appropriately named. It tastes like honey. It tastes like wine. And it's Ethiopian!"}
{"text":"Their food is awesome. Love eating with my fingers and trying new things. Thank you for coming to Old Brooklyn"}
{"text":"I'm very excited about this new edition to my neighborhood! Ethiopian food is a welcomed change to our normal options and it was SOOOOO GOOD. It looks weird outside but that's typical for us ? Just go in and enjoy!

I came with my Ethiopian Goddess Friends () who should be the main critic on the restaurant... they approve! A few improvements could be made: the server didn't seem to know much about the culture/nature of the food... we had to ask for injera a lot instead of it being provided... and the beef platter had very little Beef and a lot of veggies on it. 

We will definitely return as the food tasted SO GOOD (the best Ethiopian in CLE) & maybe there will be some minor improvements!"}
{"text":"Excellent Ethiopian food and great service highly recommend 5 stars!!!
We had the vegetarian combo and Timatim fitfit which was delicious
The hot tea and Indira were delightful"}
