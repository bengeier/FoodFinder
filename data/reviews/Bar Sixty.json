{"text":"Went there for Sunday brunch with a couple friends, and we were all disappointed. The food was cold and bland.  It's hard to screw up scrambled eggs and toast, but they somehow managed to do so. Unlike the interior, which was easy on the eyes, the food looked like it tasted. It had no life, no seasoning, no love.  It looked like the food had been sitting around for awhile.  It was served on a metal platter and jail, cafeteria food came to mind.  The toast looked like it was flattened prior to being toasted, which was very bizarre. Even the french toast was flattened, and not only that, it also tasted terrible.  Didn't think french toast could be so bad.  I'm not having any fun writing this, as I thought the servers were polite enough.  However, they took a while to give us menus, and didn't check up on us much, even though we were the only people there.  The menu was also different than what was on the website, and had good reviews.  Oh, the bacon was the only tasty item.  The pricing for the quality of food is really not worth it."}
{"text":"Bar sixty provides exceptional atmosphere and customer service. A great place to start, end, or stay all night!"}
{"text":"Great spot, came to watch the raptors game. $5 pints and $5 wings. The wings were amazing, nice tv screens. Great change from the typical king west bars.. Great music, friendly staff, great vibe. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great neighbourhood eatery. The Vietnamese menu filled a food gap in the neighbourhood. The pho bowls are flavorful and so great on a cold night. My personal fave is the honey garlic wings where the garlic comes in crispy bits on the coating. It's a quiet spot with great food (and large tvs at the bar for those into sporting events)."}
{"text":"There is a paucity of Vietnamese restaurants in this neck of the woods. Yes, there's Spadina to the east and Ossington to the west and even some Vietnamese places north of Dundas on Bathurst, but in my opinion there ought to be Vietnamese food readily available at every street corner because wouldn't you rather eat a bowl of pho than a dry bagel from Starbucks?

I have never actually eaten inside this restaurant, but I've ordered takeout (via Ritual) many times so this review is solely for that. I am a big fan of their rare beef pho and wonton char siu pho. It is always expediently prepared and comes packaged very well for takeout purposes. Also comes with legit veggies and toppings to add in. Costs about $10 per bowl and the serving size is generous."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I walked in at noon on a Sunday looking for something to eat and were pleasantly surprised. The avocado roll serving size is huge for 6 dollars and everything is fresh. Definitely going to try their pho but will probably pick up as it seems more like a pick up or delivery place."}
{"text":"This establishment has become my go to spot in the city to take everything Toronto playoff sports related. 

More importantly however everything I've had to eat there has made for a wonderful game day experience. The wings have become my staple there. 

They tend to have game day specials, and with 6 TVs to anchor the bar/restaurant you're very unlikely to miss a beat. 

The staff are great and personable which is the icing on the cake."}
