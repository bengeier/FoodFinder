{"text":"We came here on a Saturday night for dinner because they were one of the few places that was taking reservations on a weekend night! I had never been to the downtown location before, I had only been to the Hilldale location for lunch, so I was interested to see if there was a difference. There was a large group of us but we were able to sit in the back room so we had our own private dining area which was extremely nice. We all got cocktails to start, I tried the Asian Margarita which was basically a lychee margarita and loved it. It had a nice lychee flavor without being overly sweet. I tried three other cocktails that my friends ordered and they were also great. I was honestly pretty surprised that there cocktails were as good as they were because I feel like I normally only get cocktails that taste that good from places that are dedicated cocktail bars, rather than at restaurants that serve cocktails. For food, I split the chef's choice that came with 1 specialty roll, 1 inside-out roll, and 1 regular roll for $20 because we were having trouble deciding on which rolls we wanted. Maybe we got lucky, but the three rolls we got were right up our alley in terms of flavors we liked! We got the rainbow roll, maybe the negihama?, and the spicy tuna roll. All three rolls were also very sizeable with 2 of them being 8 pieces and 1 of them being 6 pieces. It was a fantastic deal considering the amount of sushi we got and the quality of the rolls. Everyone else that we were with also enjoyed their rolls and appetizers. I would definitely go back again to try more cocktails and some of their other rolls and food options."}
{"text":"Had lunch here recently while traveling for work. It is SUPER easy to miss from outside. There is no signage except for on the side by the door, but when it's nice out that door is open and you can't see it at all.   The air conditioning was out while we were there, but they had big fans and plenty of water! I loved the specials for lunch - all chef's choice! I almost always get these to get a good idea for a restaurant. The one I got (#1) was 1 sushi roll and 7 nigiri, which were huge! It was super affordable and delicious."}
{"text":"Decent sushi.  Nothing amazing but the serving size was pretty good for the price.  We ordered 3 sushi rolls off the \"regular roll\" section and one nigiri and it ended up being about $20 total.  We felt pretty satisfied with the amount we ordered. They do have a great list of sake though.  I would definitely come back but might try Red first if it's not a weekend night."}
{"text":"My husband and I really like sushi, and we love Muramoto Downtown!! We tried it for the first time about a year ago, and I can't count how many times we have been back since. The service isn't always the speediest, but the ambiance is so nice that it is a relaxing wait. The sushi is really the star of the show, though. I've tried several different rolls, and I think the spicy shrimp is one of my all time faves. The prices are always very reasonable as well, and the fish always tastes really fresh. Huge fan of Muramoto!"}
{"text":"My favorite sit-down lunch spot on the square.   $10 for three chef choice rolls, at least two of which include proteins. Much better quality and price than what you would find at a grocery store or gas station.   The miso cod filet from the lunch menu shouldn't be missed either. It comes with sushi rice, seaweed salad, and steamed bok choi. The flavors are delicate and there is a lot of food on the plate, so I wouldn't recommend both the sushi special and the cod.   I think the miso cod is the best 14$ lunch option on the square."}
{"text":"My mom came to town and we wanted to treat her to a special dinner and let me tell you this did not disappoint. The hot drink cocktail and the cold edamame were the perfect match for a snowy march celebration. Pro tip, order the Wisconsin old fashioned if you want your cherries muddled.   The gluten free Godzilla role brought be back to my high school days - seriously they can make everything gluten free. The atmosphere is great and love watching the chefs make the sushi rolls right in front of you."}
{"text":"A favorite sushi restaurant that also serves traditional and innovative non-sushi options. The restaurant seems to have a better focus than when they were located further down King Street, and much better than the hit-or-miss 43 North that it replaced in this space (all were chef Muromoto restaurants, as is Morris Ramen next door).   The place is small so get there early or wait. There are some nice bars in the area that you can visit while you wait."}
{"text":"From the sidewalk, the place is actually really easy to overlook. The restaurant is not marked aside from a sign on the wall of the doorway. Once inside, the whole place is filled with beautiful woodwork. The ceiling kept me visually occupied for a really long time. The food itself has everything you'd expect from a Muramoto restaurant. The sushi selection is as good as their more sushi focused hilldale location. You can get the combo platters that's chef's choice, though if you really love/hate certain fish, they're generally really great about making those accommodations. The hot food has a nice variety of dishes to choose from. The black miso cod that's pretty much a muramoto staple is always a great option. The pork belly is very flavorful, with cloves of garlic stuff inside the meat. And it comes with their housemade kimchi. The brisket has great flavors, though toward the end, it does get a bit salty if you eat the whole portion on your own. The fried chicken has a very light crust, definitely not your traditional fried chicken. They also have daily specials that range from small amuse bouche type things to larger plates that you can share. Overall, it's great to have a restaurant back in this part of downtown that has the quality of sushi that muramoto does."}
{"text":"I've had lunch at Muramota at their 108 King Street location several times. It's not a large space but we've never had a problem getting seated. There are a few tables outside as well as tables and the sushi bar inside. The decor is mostly wood, but the space is open and warm. We were greeted promptly and escorted to a table. Our waiter was fun and friendly.  Each time I've gone, I've had the sushi combo #1. It's chef choice of one roll and seven nigiri. At the old location they once gave me the gourd roll and I was disappointed since I'm always hoping for fish. But I haven't run into that here. The seven nigiri have always been different varieties, very fresh, and very tasty. I really enjoy these. The roll is six pieces and on this visit it was tuna. The chef was rather heavy on the wasabi on our last visit. Both I and my dining companion were overpowered by the wasabi despite the fact my dining companion likes it when his has a kick. But in general, I find Muramoto's sushi to be quite tasty."}
{"text":"This charming spot is a solid choice for sushi near the capitol.  Would recommend going with a group to share a couple of the small plates and sushi rolls. Ordered a variety of dishes listed below (and ranked in order or preference)    Miso Soup The miso  had a great flavor  and was perfect for the cold night! This was my favorite for the night   Avocado roll Sushi, rice, in a seaweed wrapper.  The rolls were fresh and light.   Lamb Curry The lamb curry comes with rice and is a mix of the lamb with potatoes, and carrots in the curry sauce.    Pork belly The pork belly, served on a bed of kimchi and seasons with garlic has a good taste, but was not as soft as I would expect for brisket.   Edamame The edamame is served in a fairly standard way. The soybeans came out salted. They were served cold which I found to be a bit jarring.   Overall I would go back again.  I would reorder the miso, curry, and avo rolls. I would sub the brisket and edamame for some of their other options."}
{"text":"Boo. Called in advance asking about seating, told several tables clearing soon, arrived four minutes later, empty table near door, female server told us she would prep table for us, group of three women arrived after us, table prep completed, male server awarded table to group behind us, group deliberated knowing we were ahead of them, server confirmed table for other group, we left. Not cool, bud. I guarantee you will not have the opportunity to do that again to this former twice weekly customer."}
{"text":"Service was slow, rolls were very small, not fresh and really expensive. Seaweed salad had more mixed greens than seaweed.  Not impressed and not going back."}
{"text":"This place is a decent spot for sushi downtown. We ordered the Ecuador and Fire rolls for a nice mix of fresh and spicy and were fairly pleased. I think one of the sauces used a lot of mayo, which I'd prefer to do without. The miso soup has a really nice kick to it.  Service was okay. The restaurant is a bit more on the pricey side for dinner, but it does look like there are some decent lunch specials."}
{"text":"Went there for dinner on a Tuesday night. Friendly staff, good bar selection (the whiskey was overpriced, though) and the sushi was very good. But even though the restaurant was not too crowded and I ordered the small plate of chef's choice sushi, I still ended up waiting for about 30 minutes for the food. I've only eaten here once though, so this may have been an anomaly."}
{"text":"Most people I ask tell me that Red has the best sushi in Madison. After trying Muramoto today, I strongly disagree.  Muramoto is a small, intimate restaurant with really cool Japanese hipster vibe much like Morris Ramen next door. I don't get a weeaboo vibe from them, so don't start getting all \"oishii gocheesosama deshda arigato gozaimasu\" when you're there. At 8 pm on a Saturday, it was actually fairly quiet. The place was only half full, and they managed to block the noise from the loud pride festival outside. The menu has some interesting, fairly-priced hot items, but I came for the sushi. Each sushi item had a very appetizing description talking about the origin, preparation, and flavor of the ingredient. It was difficult to not just order everything.  I started a large sushi combo plate for $25. That may sound like a lot of money for a roll and 9 pieces of nigiri, but it's actually an awesome deal considering how generous they are with their fish portions. Mine came with an octopus and scallion roll, bonito, albacore, blue fin (at mid-fattiness or chutoro), escarol, scallop, sweet raw shrimp, smoked salmon, yellowtail, and chilean sea bass. I'm not going to describe it all in detail since that would take forever, but it was all awesome. Everything was so flavorful and intentional. I was at a place owned by one of Jiro's trainees a few weeks ago, and this was pretty much just as good. I got some more of my favorite nigiri and sashimi pieces afterwards. My favorite was probably the uni (sea urchin). If you're an adventerous sea food eater and have never tried uni, the sweet, creamy, fishy flavor will make you fall in love with sushi all over again.  My only complaint was the rice. It wasn't warm and was kind of mushy and pasty. It didn't ruin the roll, but I found myself eating around it when eating nigiri. I will probably order most things as sashimi from now on.  When I got my bill, I was pleasantly surprised by how little it cost. I had a world-class sushi feast for 2 people for under $80 after tipping generously. I will be back soon."}
{"text":"This place is not the easiest to find and much smaller than the old location down the street and the one in hilldale.   Lighting is way too dim, was barely able to see the menus, which have been pretty worn down as well.  We got the Chef's Choice Maki Combo which comes with 1 regular Roll, 1 inside-out Roll, and 1 special Roll, all for $20 so a very decent deal. Problem is Chef's Choice is still pretty limited and they for sure don't usually choose the higher quality or more raw fish rolls on the menu.  I've done this deal about 4 or 5 times now and each time one roll is with eel and one is fried something (most of the time shrimp tempura) and the Maki is usually tuna something. If you don't mind this, then this is the best deal for you."}
{"text":"I stopped in for a quick lunch and was surprised on how slow it was.  At most, there were two other parties eating at around 12:45.  The interior is somewhat industrial (the omnipresent Edison bulbs) but the dark wood tables, floor, and surroundings makes it feel cozy.  I was slightly turned off by the dirty windows looking out onto the street.  They were recently cleaned (I could see the squeegee lines) yet it must have been with mud as they were completely streaked. I sat the sushi bar and ordered the Sushi Combo #1 (chef's choice 1 roll & 7 nigiri) as well as a cup of Miso Soup.  The roll and nigiri were well constructed and the fish fresh.  I thought the salmon nigiri was some of the best I've tasted in Madison.  The Miso Soup was flavorful but at $4 for a small cup wasn't not worth the asking price.  Service was prompt and attentive. Muramoto doesn't have a large lunch menu beyond sushi so maybe that (or that it is still fairly new) is the reason for the light crowd.  I would't hesitate to return for sushi.  Next time, though, I hope the windows don't look like they were submerged in a dusty vat of darkness."}
{"text":"The sushi isn't shabby here, but the black miso cod lunch special ($12) is my personal favorite. The cod is incredibly tasty and tender and comes with lots of greens. I was pretty stuffed after eating the entire meal. It's an intimidate restaurant with dim lighting and beautifully plated food."}
{"text":"The best Japanese in Madison.  We started with a Fistful of Dollars, a bourbon cocktail. It was especially tasty with mole bitters adding an earthy complexity.  Then we had miso soup that included a few chili flakes adding a welcome change from the ubiquitous standard starter.   Then we had an Asian slaw with cabbage, daikon, other veggies and a light, tasty sesame dressing.  We had some excellent rolls. And tempura walleye which could match or exceed any Friday fish fry in Wisconsin.   For dessert we had a delicious ginger flan with a caramel sauce.  A cool, light way to end an excellent meal.   Sometimes they have black sesame ice cream for dessert.  It has a lovely rich buttery taste.  Far better than the standard mochi ice cream at other places. If you like Japanese or Asian fusion you have to try this."}
{"text":"Hands down, the best sushi in Madison.   My husband and I both opted for the maki special, and boy did that pay off. The chef was on point!  It starts with your choice of miso soup or a seaweed salad. Followed by 2 standard rolls and 1 specialty roll.   The chef just makes what they're feeling. I assume the chef was either in a very good mood or is a tortured artist on a quest to make the perfect dragon roll. It's hard to tell which, but either way, everything was amazing!  Although we technically ordered the exact same thing, between us, we had 6 different rolls. So... sushi surprise for the win!"}
{"text":"I had dinner here tonight with one of my reps from work. Service was quick! We ordered the dragon, fire and rainbow rolls. The sushi was fresh and the service was great. Can't really ask for much more! I would love to visit again when I return to Madison."}
{"text":"I just checked out their lunch menu after they've been open at the new space for a couple weeks. I have to say I'm one of those that encourage change, but I actually miss the old lunch menu. That's just because I was such a fan of their lunch entrees and now they are a bit different. But I still like it. I had tried a few new items from the lunch menu: the pork belly and the brisket.   Whenever there's pork belly on the menu, I suggest you order it. The pork belly had some crispiness and the sauce was sweet and savory. And served over bed of kimchi with rice and seaweed salad on the side. Kimchi was great, perfect level of spicy and sour, although I think they could include less if it. I didn't have enough pork belly and rice to go with the portion.  The brisket was a bit drier than I would like but it had a delicious sauce that made the brisket more sophisticated, must have been the miso sauce. This was also served with a side of rice and seaweed salad.  The presentation is beautiful and portions were perfect for lunch.  Oh and their fire roll was definitely fiyah-on point!"}
{"text":"So many of the reviews here are for there lunch specials and boy do they look awesome!   Anyways I came here for a dinner on a Monday night. I love sushi so I was excited to try another Madison Sushi joint I had heard good things about. My significant other and I were meeting our friend who had arrived earlier. We were all immediately greeted and told we could either wait for a table in the main area or an immediate one in the back room. We choose the back room. It is just a smaller room with only two table, nothing wrong with that! I did like that is was more quiet and private.  We started out with drinks. I tried the honey ginger sake hot. They infuse it in house and I have to say this was delicious! The flavors paired very well with the residual sake flavor. It was nice and hot which was a nice contrast to the rainy dreary day it was.   For food I ordered the Miso soup to start and the Fire Roll(the table shared this one), Spicy Shrimp Roll and the New York Roll. The Miso Soup was one of the best ones I have had in the area. It had your classic Miso flavor but with a little bit of heat and was not bland at all.   All of the rolls we had were very fresh tasting and had great flavor to them. There was not to much rice which was nice. Overall our meal was very balanced. We mostly stuck to sushi but some of there hot entrees look very good as well. My favorite was the Fire Roll this one had a kick to it and tempura Salmon. I had never had Salmon in the tempura style before but it was very good.   Overall this was a great experience and we were happy to find another sushi restaurant we enjoyed. We decided we would definitely be back to try more of the menu!"}
{"text":"First, I want to say that the staff was extremely friendly and that the service stood out.  The sushi was good, but I felt something was missing from the food experience itself. The scallop small plate came with two good sized scallops, but the dish lacked any special flair.  I felt the mushrooms overpowered the entire dish too.  I ordered a sushi roll which was did not have enough fish in it. This place is still good, just not great."}
{"text":"I'll start off by saying I am not the biggest fan of sushi. I know... who am I? However I did like this place. We had a semi large group and we had plenty of room to sit and enjoy our meal. I ordered a spicy tuna roll and a salmon roll. I did NOT care for the seaweed wrapped roll and I thought the rice roll was too large and a bit messy and hard to eat.  I really liked the ambiance in the restaurant and it wasn't outrageously overpriced. I enjoyed myself and it was a fun experience to try something new.  Not my favorite, but I would try it again."}
{"text":"Great reimagining. Love the atmosphere and the sushi. The chefs are great and very friendly if you choose to sit at the bar. High praise all around!"}
{"text":"I was a huge, huge fan of 43 North and was excited to see what Muramoto would do with the space when they moved in. Luckily, it mostly stayed the same, but the food and service didn't live up to the former place. I had been to Muramoto in its old space with the same experience, unfortunately.  Overall, Muramoto is a decent average sushi restaurant with fine dining sushi prices. My biggest critique is that the food prices are too high. I don't typically eat that much, but I found it difficult to spend less than $30 for a filling meal. I understand sushi-grade fish is expensive, but it would nice if there were some affordable options on the menu in addition to all the special rolls. I've eaten at other sushi restaurants without breaking the bank, so it's possible. An ideal combo would be something like a $10 special roll with 1 or 2 smaller $3 maki rolls. I ended up going with the maki combo ($20), which was the perfect amount of food, but also more than I wanted to spend. We also got an appetizer. The drinks were also higher than I expected, but not atypical compared to other places in Madison.   The sushi was quite good, although service was spotty and it took a while for food to come out. I was with a group of 3 and the entrees also came out at different times.  The food is decent, so I would gladly go again, but I might try one of the entrees instead of the sushi to get more value for the price (maybe?)."}
{"text":"Here's my routine. Pre dinner drinks at the wonderful chill Opus. Walk 2 doors down and have sushi that rivals the overpriced Red at Muramoto. Sit at the counter where the fresh fish is stored. Choose some Sushimi. Ask the chef for. Recommendation. Enjoy. Hit Majestic for some music."}
{"text":"Highly disappointed.  Seaweed salad mushy and yet not tender at the same time.  Muramoto roll, named after the establishment, yet very unpleasant.  I love sushi,  but I couldn't eat it.   Should have sent it back.  Tasted like bergamot/cardamom/dish soap.  The menu is sadly similar to the old menu.  Was hoping for a spark of something new.  Instead felt like the same old thing shoved into its main competitors old location.  (Weird.). I was hoping to find a reason to not go to red.  Bummer.    Positives:  Ecuador roll, cocktails are done well."}
