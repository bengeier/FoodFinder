{"text":"Came here over 23 years ago. Stir amazing food and great people... highly recommended"}
{"text":"I went to higley hot dog for over the 200th time, no exaggeration. I am writing this review a little to late, i have been seeing the amazing people down and higley hot dog for ten, yes 10 years. We moved in 2005. It has been the same great food for the entire length of time I have been going. They haven't changed, great friendly service and THE BEST HOT DOG IN ARIZONA, and my personal favorite chili cheese fries. I hope they read this review, because if it was the first time or today's visit I would not change a thing about this place. Except maybe making it bigger. 

Sincerely your, 10 year customer"}
{"text":"I wish I found this place four years ago when I started working in the area. The Italian Beef is great."}
{"text":"Cash only but not expensive. Best hot dogs in Gilbert for the money! Try the cheese fries for a delicious artery clogging side. Make sure to ask for the works on your hot dog to get the best item on the menu."}
{"text":"I have been going here since I could ride a bike.  I grew up a couple miles away and love everything about Higley Hot Dog, if it ever went away gilbert, or really Higley, would never be the same.  One of the first questions I ask someone when they come visit me here in AZ is: Have you been to Higley Hot Dog?  I'm shocked when I talk to a native or local and find out they have never been and I don't rest until they let me take them to lunch there.  Yeah kind of weird but seriously this place has a special place in my heart.  Anyway as you can tell I love this place and will eat here until the day I die.   Anyway like Amy S. mentioned they serve Vienna Beef Hot dogs that are oh so good.  My mouth waters as I think of my most recent encounter.  Also not only are their hot dogs my fav. but don't forget to order a shake, strawberry is my favorite. its a nice chill factor when it comes to 105 degree weather working in the sun."}
{"text":"Higley started out as a very small town, and higley hotdog has survived the transformation to a fast growing city.
The atmosphere is that of a small town hotdog joint, not too fancy nor a restaurant. However, the concept is simple. The food is good. The staff is friendly. Also, it has been around so long I have childhood memories here. Look forward to going back for years to come."}
{"text":"It's good! We didn't really like the chili cheese dogs but loved the Chicago dogs. The have no jalape√±os here and that is important to me on a good hot dog. Or at least having the option."}
{"text":"Great food, cheap prices but it stinks that they are \"cash only\" especially when I wanted to get more food than what I had cash on me for. They need to seriously think about getting some sort of credit/debt card machine or even an atm machine inside the sit in area."}
{"text":"Simply the best hot dog that I have ever had in Arizona. I don't go to a lot of places for hot dogs but this one reminds me of Chicago more then the substandard Portabellos that moved here from Chicago."}
{"text":"A good Chicago dog / beef spot... the food is made to order and consistently good.  It is family owned and operated and always a good experience!"}
{"text":"The staff were complacent, did a poor job putting our orders together, and the ingredients were old. Super disappointing for the price. I would go with the Costco hotdogs & save $30."}
{"text":"About what you'd expect for a tiny hot dog joint.  The choices in sausages is good, and they have a nice variety of condiment choices.  I would say the flavor of the hot dogs/sausages ranges from average to above average.  We also ordered some of the chili cheese fries.  Not bad - on par with a concession stand.  Price is acceptable and the staff is friendly.

A decent choice if you're in the mood for a quick bite for lunch and don't feel like wading through the crowds for a Costco hot dog."}
{"text":"What a find new to the area don't judge a book. The beef and sausage to die for. Nice secret Gilbert."}
{"text":"Great little hot dog shack. I love the hotdog with everything on it. The pickles and pepper are great. One of my favorite places to eat a hotdog. You don't have to pay a lot of money to get a good hot dog. The fries are ok.

Inexpensive and cash only."}
{"text":"Great little piece of Chicago right here in Gilbert. If you miss the Vienna Beef hotdog shops of Chicago this is your spot. Great malts and Wisconsin Brats too. Keep up the good work guys."}
{"text":"Love coming here... Oh so yummy!  Gotta have the Chicago Dog with everything!  Wish they would invest in Square or something to take cards!"}
{"text":"Legit Chicago style dogs. Come strictly for the polish or brat though. Everyting else is from the grocery store...this is no secret, it is what it is. You don't go to the hot dog stands in Chicage for the chicken fingers and service, do you?"}
{"text":"I have been eating at Higley Hot dog hut since I was in HS--over 10+ years!  The quality has not changed one bit!  It is just as good now as it was back then!  Love the owners & the hot dogs!  My hubby loves the Italian Beef sandwich!  We also love the Milkshakes & Chili Cheese Fries!  Can't say enough good things about this place except it's super busy during peak eating times & don't forget your CASH!"}
{"text":"We have been three times in the last month. The chili cheese fries are amazing!!! Prices are great and service is friendly/fast. Our normal go to is the Hot dog with the works (Chicago dog) and the Fire dog with the works. Also had the Chili Cheese dog and it was delicious. Awesome to have this place nearby for the days when you have a craving for a hot dog."}
{"text":"This place is just a little hole-in-the-wall hot dog stand really... so don't think your going to a nice restaurant or anything when you go. But the food is awesome. The Chicago style hot dogs are awesome... best around really!

We've been going here for 20 years and we love it. My kids would eat there every day if they could."}
{"text":"The chili cheese fries are exactly what they should be. Crispy fries topped with scrumptious chili, loaded up with beans, and swimming in nacho cheese. The combo sausage, beef, marinara sandwich was pretty good. The sausage was a little heavy on the fennel flavor, but the beef was thinly cut and delicious. My only recommendation to make it better would be if the bread was toasted. The sandwich must be eaten quickly"}
{"text":"Good food but don't forget to bring cash. They don't take card. I love a good Chicago dog."}
{"text":"'Chilly-cheese fries' - if that doesn't interest you...well I'm sorry.

You have to get the chicago style hot-dog that comes with a cucumber on top. The chicago gravey w bread is also a good conversation starter (get it as an appetizer to share). I didn't like the chicago tomali (I was curious, bad idea).

There's outdoor seating in the sun, or indoor seating...but we always get it to go."}
{"text":"Can't say anything about the other foods offered here but I have had the polish dog twice with the works and it is pretty tasty.  Keep in mind that this is a hot dog stand not a five star dining restaurant.  You want a good tasting hotdog on a fresh bun Chicago style?  Go to Higley Hot Dog!  Beats the Costco dogs down the street!"}
{"text":"Come all the way from California to go to higli's it's the best every time we come we go there best hot dog anywhere"}
{"text":"DISGUSTING, DISGUSTING, DISGUSTING.  I can't believe I spent my hard earned money at this place.  These days, it's a treat for me to go out to lunch, and I wish I could turn back time after having visited Higley Hot Dog Hut.  Where to begin....
The corn dog was MICROWAVED.  I open the wrapper, and what greets me is this soggy, mushy, greasy uncooked mess.  So I take it back to the counter and ask if they could pop it in the fryer for another minute or so and she tells me that it was microwaved.  Um, huh?  What kind of a place that specializes in hot dogs microwaves their food???  They obviously deep fried the french fries, why not the corn dog?  The fries, that leads me to another problem.  They were so overcooked, they were like miniature rail road ties.  I could have used them as tools.
Next, the chili dog.  It was a hot dog, covered in BEANS with runny, watery cheese sauce.  It had zero flavor and was a complete mess.   Beans?  No meat, just beans.  On my hot dog.  And my fries.  WTH?  
To top it all off, they are overpriced.  I honestly can't understand why anyone would continue to go to this place, and how it got good ratings at all.  Trust me folks, don't waste your money here.  I would have gotten better food at the Circle K across the street.  Hey yelp!  How about a 'negative stars' option?!  Higley Hot Dog Hut needs it!!!"}
{"text":"I am surprised by how many reviewers give this place four, and five stars. Are you guys nuts? The food is mediocre at best, and the toppings are totally unimaginative and extremely limited.  The fries were the best part of the whole experience for me, food wise. The place itself is dark, dingy, kind of dirty feeling and a TV blares in the corner of this step back into the early seventies.  The old woman behind the counter was rude, and impolite.  She cut me short to bitch at me about me taking too long to order.  When i laughed and said if she had simply been listening.... Unbelievably rude! And snippy! She assured us she was the owner, to my dismay. Wont be back, ever again.  Im still thinking i should have tried the Chinese joint around the corner instead of this hole. Oh, but the prices are cheap -- If thats any consolation."}
{"text":"Today was my 1st time ever here and i absolutely loved it!!! Very friendly staff and great food. The food came out super quick. Highly recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"Take away:  Great little spot! Bring cash! Solid dogs and amazing chili

Been trying to explore areas around here and heard about the Higley Hot Dog Hut.  They have a huge selection of type of dogs:  from your regular to polish to a fire dog to others I can't even remember.  I went with the Polish and got the \"works\" added to it--which tops it with Chicago dog fixings.  Those peppers packed a kick!--loved it.  

I also got an order of their chili cheese fries--solid choice because the chili is top notch.  It's not a bland chili--definitely has some spice and substance.  I'll have to go back and get a chili dog next time.

We took advantage of their outdoor seating--picnic tables with umbrellas were a perfect fit for that breezy Gilbert day. Apparently they only take cash I read from previous helpful reviews so make sure you come prepared to get your hot dog fix."}
{"text":"French fries are awesome here!  Hot dogs are good and the service is as well!  My wife and I enjoyed this spot and we will be back"}
{"text":"Great Vienna Beef hot dog dragged through the garden! They also have IlTaco Pizza Puffs as well. Italian Beef and Maxwell street Polish. DELICIOUS!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I moved to the area recently from Chicago and have been looking for a great hot dog stand. We will definitely return for one of the best hot dogs in the area. Delicious Vienna hot dogs, great prices and my daughter loves the fries. If you're looking for great hot dogs this is the place to come!"}
{"text":"This place is legit!  I lived in Chicago for a year, and this is the only hot dog in the Phoenix area that measures up!  Toppings are correct and service was great!  They even have a decent Italian beef sandwich with hot/mild peppers and giardiniera.  Lemonade was great too!  Its definitely a hut inside, but the people are great and so is the food!  I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Great gogs!! Wife had the spicy dog abd I had the chili dog with onions. Very good!! We will return"}
{"text":"Best hot dog place I have ever been to. Small local small business, cash only place. great food!!! I recommend the fire dog with chilli and onions"}
{"text":"Best Polish dog that I ever had. Get it with the \"works\". The gravy bread is good also."}
{"text":"Well, after reading all the great reviews and hearing a lot about this place, I was so excited to eat here for lunch yesterday! I got chili cheese fries, and a plain ole' hotdog. My daughter got an order of the chicken nuggets. I wasn't really impressed by any of the food I had ordered. I'm really picky about my hotdogs and I was kind of grossed out by how thick they were. I'm used to the dodger dog styled ones, not Chicago style. That turned me off for the rest of my meal. My bun was really soggy and my hot dog kept falling out of it and that just pissed me off. The chili fries were also really runny. Not sure if they make their own chili but it was defiantly too runny for my liking. And last but not least, my daughters chicken nuggets tasted like a bucket of salt was dumped all over them. And don't get me wrong, I put salt on everything, I LOVE salt, but even that amount of salt was too much for me! I just really wasn't impressed by this place. Ill be sticking to wienershnitzle"}
{"text":"Cheese fries are yummy, hot dogs are all beef and the best around. Perfect for a small hole in the wall joint. Would go more often but very rarely carry cash and its cash only. Went out of my way to go to atm today though because it had been too long. Parking much better than it used to be."}
{"text":"Worst hot dog I've ever had! It was dry and shriveled up. It was my first time there and I was looking at the menu and the lady says, \"you know it's not a steak place, it's hot dogs!\" I ordered and as she was ringing me up, I asked if I she can add peppers and she said no you're done! We went to the window and got our hot dogs and sat down and I went to the window to ask the teenage boy if I could have some peppers. He was nice and gave me some but I noticed he was holding a hot dog with no gloves. 

I won't be going back there again! The health department needs to look into this place. It's dirty! Gross food and terrible customer service! The lady there is so rude!!!!"}
{"text":"What more could you ask for from a hole in the wall shack that sells AWESOME hot dogs, tacos, fries and OMG amazing shakes!!!!
Just make sure you have cash!"}
{"text":"Bring cash - they don't take checks or credit cards - but their prices are very low!  I had their fire dog, fully loaded - wow, it was fantastic!  I then tried their taco, which is really a burrito - also excellent.  But one of the most pleasant surprises for me were those dang old greasy french fries - oh yeah, just like you used to get at so many hamburger places until those mean old health experts started making the chains get rid of the delicious grease.  Mmmmm, half of a good fry is the grease it is cooked in.  OK, maybe I exaggerated just a wee bit, but really, their fries are some of the best I have ever tried.  My only one small complaint is they don't have Dr. Pepper!  So I had to drink Pepsi instead!"}
{"text":"This is your standard issue Vienna Sausage Co. restaurant. When I was there, there was no indoor dining, only a walk through carry-out type operation. The only seating was outside on picnic tables with umbrellas.  Service was fast and friendly. Prices reasonable, cash only.

Once you've eaten at one of these places the menu pretty much carries the basic core of Vienna items, pretty much the same core stuff, served the same way as Portillos or any of the places in Chicago.

Cash only which I like after having my credit card numbers stolen twice before at restaurants which is why I no longer use credit cards for dining, like the time mine was stolen at Pizza Hut (which never made the TV news because they are a huge advertiser). So I generally always pay in cash at most stores and all restaurants now due to the risks. 

This place is well worth the drive compared to the 15 mile trip to Portillos in Tempe.

I'm not sure if the lack of indoor dining is seasonal or permanent but when I was there, it was outdoor seating on picnic tables in the parking lot only. I will be a return customer.

The store is located about 50 yards west of Higley Rd on Williams Field Road just south of the high school, look for the big hot dog of the front of the store! If you're going there on the 202, use the Williams Field Rd exit, not the Higley Rd exit. The restaurant is just east of the Williams Field Rd exit on the 202.

Follow-up: Been here several more times and never been disappointed. I get dogs to go and eat an italian beef, dipped, with peppers right there before the bun turns into mush. If you order a Chicago dog with everything they do one thing not typical, they put on some cuke slices so I always order mine without the cuke slices. And the dining area is open sometimes, I'm not sure what the schedule is for using the dining area. 
For dining inside, you still park in their lot and order outside, then walk around and wait for your food inside. 
Always had great food and service here. And the dogs do survive a few days in the refrigerator for re-warming in a microwave but they do change texture."}
{"text":"I have been taking my kids out here for over a decade.  The people are nice, the food is good, and the price is right.  The tacos are good old school american style. They are not heavily seasoned but are tasty.  the dogs are always good, as is the tater salad and fries.  The place has good iced tea too."}
{"text":"For a little hot dog place, this was pretty darn good."}
{"text":"Ate here with my dad, I just got a plain hotdog with katchup, no complaints there. It was very good. My father originally ordered a type of hotdog but I think they were out of sourkraut, and he got a different type. Wasn't too estatic over it but just didn't care for I think the chili. I'll definitely go back. A cute local spot. Great to eat outside when weather is nice."}
{"text":"Had lunch here a couple days ago to try it out and boy was I in for a treat! I ordered a couple of their polish dogs with everything on it and a pop and it made my day! There was a to go option but I decided to go inside and it was a nice little dining area, a little short for me but I'm a bit tall. Only thing I think would enhance the experience is if they also accepted card payments instead of their cash only rule. But none the less I received a great meal and a friendly couple to serve it to me!"}
{"text":"CASH ONLY

No notices on site and had no idea until I actually walked into the hut. Hot dog was very average, Home Depot sells better.

We will not be coming back here anytime soon.

---

I've been told they now have a Cash Only sign. Damn. Congratulations."}
{"text":"Hot dogs? Yes, please. I recommend the works, delicious. I also got the cheese fries, meh. I only wish the cheese was a real nacho cheese with a little flavor rather than a regular cheddar. This is a great lunch spot but definitely get it to go since all the seating is outside. Also, make sure you get there early because they close at 5:30 and are not open on Sundays."}
{"text":"Doesn't get any better than this!

If you're in the mood for a tasty Vienna Beef dog, then this is the place to go in Gilbert! Don't fool around with gas station garbage! If you're not in the mood for a dog, you can grab some pizza, an Italian beef sandwhich and more!"}
{"text":"Ordered a Chicago Dog and a Fire Dog.  Super good dogs and they were prepared and delivered quickly. However, the lady who took our takeout order had zero patience as we decided what to order even though there wasn't anyone else in line behind us. She was quite rude as we ordered and she commented on the length of time it took to order \"just two hotdogs\" ... tossing our bag on the counter with a \"there you go.\" There IS a \"Hot Dog Nazi\" sign in the seating area ... perhaps that is their gimmick and she was just playing the part. We will give it another shot some day as the food warranted a second chance."}
{"text":"Great hot dogs and great people running the place.
Go for the Chicago dog"}
{"text":"This is the cutest little place.  They have fast, friendly service, and their food is consistently really good.  Never had anything there I didn't like.  I recommend the bagel dog and chili cheese fries.  My husband likes their beef sandwich with the sauce on the side.  So glad we live right by there!"}
{"text":"It has been a while since I had a Chicago dog at Higley Hot Dog Hut, but it was surely a memorable hot dog, 'cause I sure could use a couple right now! I'll be stopping by next time I'm down that way!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to Higley Hotdog for at least eight years and the quality has always been awesome! I have never been disappointed. The place itself is like a small little shack type joint, definitely not fancy. The food is fantastic as well as the customer service. It's been the same people every time and they're wonderful! It's cash only!"}
{"text":"So good, so inexpensive, so lucky it's close to us. We love hot dogs and were hankering for one today. Glad we took our friends advice and stopped in. Very unassuming place but the Polish and chili dogs were awesome! The Vienna dogs and poppy seed buns were authentic Chicago fare.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Great Hot dog! Truly chicago style. 4/5 stars for lacking grilled onions."}
{"text":"What comes to my mind when I think of Higley Hotdogs? Everytime I think of this place, my mouth waters! They have the tastiest hot dogs around, and offer a wide variety of more hot dogs and other foods to explore on the menu. Also, the service helps too! Excellent service! 
So if you are ever in the area, you will have to stop by here, you won't be disappointed, in fact your tastebuds will thank you."}
{"text":"I'm just going to say \"ditto\" to Alan L's review.  It's because of his detailed review that we knew to order outside and to bring cash.  So thank you, Alan!  

The Hut is a great little Chicago-style joint that took me right back, not to Chicago, but to Hot Dog Heaven in Orlando, which has been ranked in the top hot dog places in the country.  We got a polish dog, a combo with sausage and beef, chili cheese fries, and a bottle of water for something like $13.90.  GREAT dogs, low prices, friendly staff, and excellent chili cheese fries.  We sat outside so we wouldn't have to look at any Cubs gear.  (GO CARDS!)  I'm sorry it's in Gilbert, but make the drive.  It's worth it."}
{"text":"My family and I love these dogs!!! The Fire Dog is a must. We also love the gyros and their fries. If you have cash in your pocket and you're in the area... Do yourself a favor and stop by."}
{"text":"I visited this place today, and it was okay. I ordered two chili dogs, and I thought they were a click above average . The hot dogs were a good quality, but the chili was too watery for my taste. The buns were poppy seed and pretty good, but became soggy with the watery chili soaking into them. Also, I don't understand why if you're dining in, you have to order outside? Odd. I also found it odd that the people running it, while not rude, certainly weren't friendly. There was a sign hanging on the inside to the effect of \"This isn't Burger King, you'll get it how you get it.\" Okay?? Lol? I'll try this place again and see if I like something else a bit more. It's a cool looking interior though! All in all it's worth another stop."}
{"text":"My first trip here was \"eh\" and I didn't come back for months. Recently I had a craving so I gave it another try. They actually have \"real\" Chicago dogs! Yummy!! It was perfect, inexpensive and my large iced tea was fresh. I'll probably come back more often now that I know where to get a great Chicago dog!"}
{"text":"Pretty good hot dogs. In fact, I'm getting hungry just thinking about that place."}
{"text":"Decent place...but they used harder buns than I'm used to. Nice overall menu, but not a big fan. They do try to make you feel welcome, and the staff was open to my opinion without any problems."}
{"text":"Great Chicago style hot dogs! This little gem is a favorite of ours when craving a good hot dog. Celery salt please :-)"}
{"text":"Exactly what I expect for a quick cheap lunch spot when I'm craving a hot dog and fries.  Prices are right and the fire dog was delicious.  Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Epicly delicious!! Great selection of food, homemade, small staff, local feeling. I love it. Small seating area indoors. CASH ONLY. I love it. Wife loves it. Kids and parents love it. Dogs and fries are great, chilli is okay. Fast service. I will go back as often as possible."}
{"text":"Great local hotdog place.   Great prices, really good hot dogs, brats, fries and shakes. 

Kids loved the corn dogs and sitting outside"}
{"text":"I went to Higley hot dog for the first time yesterday!! the hot dogs were great and he chili cheese friesI'm glad I'm 5 minutes away from this gem!! i will be a frequent customer!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have driven by the restaurant several times and we finally decided to give it a try. We both got hot dogs with the works and were very satisfied. These aren't your normal hot dogs. Also, the owner was there and was a hoot!  There isn't much for ambiance but we didn't care. The food was great and we'll be back. Next time I'm going to try the chili dog."}
{"text":"You MUST try the Chicago dog! Delicious!!! Being in AZ it's not that often that you can find an authentic Chicago dogs but trust me......they do it right here!! Also, if you like gooey, yummy processed nacho cheese, like I can't get enough of (I seriously crave this stuff), their cheese fries are perfect!!! Hot, salty fries drowning in nacho cheese is normally a special order request for me- but here, it just comes that way- which makes me love Higley Hot dog that much more!! **just remember that they have odd hours and only take cash!**"}
{"text":"LOVE this place! They put up with me pregnant and my crazy needs for weird combos!  awesome dogs!"}
{"text":"Best dogs in az period.  Lived around this place for 4 years and it is always packed and always has the best dogs.  Take the drive and come down"}
{"text":"Walked up with a few random people today. Unfortunately, I had to skip out due to it being cash only! Out of the few of us walking in, only one entered! Honestly, this place needs to change with the times. Therefore, being able to have more business! It's 2016, time to adjust for business needs."}
{"text":"Perfect little hot dog spot. Fed the whole family for under $20. Only a few tables and cash only. Simple and yummy. Great for quick meal or families. Recommended!"}
{"text":"Awesome little place!  Cash only, nice owners.  Reminds me of a good old fashioned Chicago style hot dog hut!"}
{"text":"I had a Chicago dog with fries. The food was 
yummy, hot, served super fast, and the service was incredible! The next time you're in the mood for a hot dog, you've got to give the Higley Hot Dog Hut a try!"}
{"text":"Delicious hot dogs! Pizza puffs! And the best chili cheese fries I've ever had. Home style family atmosphere, fast and inexpensive! Bring cash and enjoy!"}
{"text":"The works hot dog with fries and a choc shake hits the spot every time!  Only downfall is that do not take cards....cash only!"}
{"text":"Overall pretty damn good. Nothing fancy by any means which is great. Hot Dogs are Vienna Beef, so they have a great flavor and a good snap to them. I got the Fire Dog ($3.95) and was not disappointed. Fries were hot, salty and tasty ($1.65). Had to try the corn dog and that was the only disappointment. Store bought, microwaved and soggy ($1.65). 

Overall, good stuff. Will definitely be coming back with the kids. $5/$6 each will take care of the family for a tasty lunch? Yeah, I'm there."}
{"text":"Nobody would go with me, every day I drive by this shack shaped like a friggen HOT DOG! And the dusty parking lot is full during lunch. And so, I went on my own.

The Good... Hot dogs!! However you want it.. I know nothing about Chi-Town dogs, but I loved the pile of goodness that was on these,
Friendly owners that were willing to direct me through the maze, and were even happier to discover that I enjoy exploration with food.
I'm not a fan of the fries... the times I've had them they were sort of limp.
And the tamales were plastic wrapped and quite bland and mushy... perhaps thats a Chicago thing I dunno, but I like good Tex-Mex Tamales, and these weren't even close to good. Much less as good.
And as much less as I hate to say it, the Gyro's are a bland abomination of dull.
Dont even try them, presliced, premeasured, microwaved, limp mediocrity.
With such a great beef sandwich and such to be had, they should just take tamales and gyros off the menu... no reason to ruin such a great menu with these things, just remove em.

It's a specialty dog, steamed, and served with kindness and family love.
Under a giant hot dog sign.
And while in many ways I prefer Ted's grilled dogs, Higley has a definite place in my heart, and close to home.

So in closing, nothings perfect, but this place is simply awesome. Give it a try, and please support a local place! And support local people, you'll be a better person for it.
And remember, if it's local, it's healthier for you! Really!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time the other day. I must say best hotdogs I've had in years...."}
{"text":"Best place for authentic Chicago Dogs! Started my career on the South Side near 95th&Western. Used to walk to a hot dog stand like this for two dogs and fries for $2.99!  They use Vienna Beef dogs, cucumber, pickle, hot peppers and (only) mustard. Cash only (like my stand 25 years ago) and ready in a couple minutes. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Been going here since I was 10 years old love love this place!! They have the best hot dogs in town! I always get the Chicago style hot dog"}
{"text":"I'm a sucker for Chicago food from back home but out here in the valley, and Higley Hot Dog has been there for a while providing authentic Vienna Beef Hot Dogs since I went to ASU east campus.

Very home town feel, the older couple that owns/runs it are always very nice and happy and having a good time.  And the lunch line there gets long and out the door cause it's so good :)

Notes:  Not open on Sundays... and CASH only!

{"text":"You know why this place has been around 40 years +!!!!! Great food, simple and they only take cash."}
{"text":"Yummy! Chili dog with homemade chili! If I wasn't doing weight watchers, I would have eaten four of these beauties! One of my friends got the Chicago style and he loved it!
Great spot, great prices and great eats!"}

{"text":"Yum Yum, nothing like a good Hot Dog and not spending a fortune on lunch.  Polish dog is delicious, and the chili cheese fries were great.  Washed it down with a chocolate Shake... A great escape from the same old chains!"}
{"text":"The dogs are great.  Especially the loaded fire dog.  My daughter loves the vanilla shake.  We also like the fries and chili fries.  However, we have not been back lately because we were grossed out last time by seeing dead roaches on the floor in the dining room, and the floor/walls/booths were old and dirty.  Althought the dogs are great, can't shake the idea that the place needs a good cleaning up and fumigation."}
{"text":"Ok I've been eating here for years. Why? It's close to the house and the only place in a 8 mile radius to get a Chicago Dog. 

The Service is good and fast but be prepared to pay cash. NO DEBIT/CREDIT

The food? Like 2 stays says.. Meh.. I've had many Chicago dogs in my day and this is not near the top of the list. The quality is inconsistent and the dogs don't always seem fresh. If you are willing to take a drive you can find a better Chicago Dog but if you are strapped for time you can gag one down here. (Sorry guys, I know it's family owned, just giving my 2 cents)"}
{"text":"Great Chicago hot dog!  Better than Portillos and that's hard to beat!  Fun little shop.  We saw it by accident as we went to the bike shop nearby.  Being from Chicago we had to try it.  It's the only thing we tried, but when yearning that Chicago dog we will be back!"}
{"text":"Awesome hot dogs. Fun hole in the wall. Vienna Beef products. Bagel dogs, corn dogs, fries all great. Cash only so bring some green. 

Same woman takes my order every time. Eat here before you judge."}
{"text":"Food is great but I wish you posted your hours somewhere!!! Just drove from Tempe to a closed restaurant!!! So mad!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great condiments to accompany the dogs. Had the works which included a kosher dill and a fresh cucumber! Bread could be better but definitely worth the $3.50."}
{"text":"Fun little place to eat some doggies. Lots of choices. It's like a hot dog cart but it has an inside. Be aware hours are super limited and they're cash only."}
{"text":"Great little hole in the wall hot dog shack... $1.25 corn dogs are bomb. Their bratwurst is great too...get some extra sauerkraut because its delicious."}
{"text":"Great dogs, polishes, and brats. The brats really hit the mark of a mid-west style brat with saurkraut and mustard. The Chicago style dog is among the best I have had anywhere. Chili cheese dog? Pretty dang good and probably my favorite thing to get when I go here. Gotta get a root beer float too. Glad this place is only a couple miles from home!

Cash only as stated before, but the prices are really reasonable. Don't bother with the corndog - tastes like the ones you get at Costco."}
{"text":"Cheap, fast, delicious food, but be sure to bring plenty of cash, because they don't take cards.

I had a polish chicago style, a small fry, and the beautiful abomination that is only known as a \"pizza puff\", a deep fried pizza pocket style item that was tasty but really greasy and certainly very unhealthy. I probably wont be eating it again. 

Anyway, overall this place was really solid, and the oldschool fries and chicago-style dog were excellent, and the staff was friendly.

While I ate at the picnic tables outside, I most certainly saw the majority of customers get their food to-go.

Going to add this place to my regular lunch rotation for sure."}
{"text":"This place needs new owners who give a $hit about their business. The food is good, but their hours of operation are a joke. They close early or open late as they please. I'm eagerly awaiting another Chicago style hot dog joint to open up."}
{"text":"Great, quality authentic stuff from a great little iconic mom & pop shop. As a midwesterner...I can attest to the simple quality of this place that really hits the spot when you just want a real dog.

Shame on people that give such great local small businesses a 1 star rating because a small, low profit business elects to accept cash only in order to keep serving the kind of food they want to, when they want to...and not absorb ridiculous credit card fees for small transactions. It clearly states within yelp that it is cash only. Yeah, it's 2016...and if your not carrying around cash and are only relying on plastic...and then bad mouthing small businesses that make great food because they don't cater to your desires...you're what's wrong with America. Be a decent human for heaven's sake

Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"If you are from Chi-Town and you like your Chicago dogs, then this place is a must!! The beef is just like home, the dogs are bomb and they even have pizza puffs. If your not from Chicago, pizza puffs are no big deal and the tamales are for the palate of a Chicagoan with no sense of Mexican food so dont order that unless you grew up on crappy rolled tamales. Order the dog with everything, but NO ketchup! That is a no no! Yes to sport peppers, very unique to Chicago dogs, get them. 
Get in your car and go now."}
{"text":"awesome food ; hot dog is a must ,      

Chris and tracy awesome !!!' We will be back best place in Gilbert"}
{"text":"The Chicago dog is always my go-to! My husband likes the Italian and beef. The prices here are so reasonable and it's such a cute place. The chili cheese fries, YUM. You can't go wrong :)"}
{"text":"Go here if you love Chicago style hot dogs! 

Best Chicago dogs that I've had in the East Valley (and I've tried \"Chicago style dogs\" from two other local establishments)..... 

Lived in Chicago for 4 years...loved (and still very much miss) Portillo's, Superdawg, and Gene and Jude's. This dog is as close as it gets to Portillo's famous Chicago dog. 

Even though they call it a hot dog with \"the works\", it's a Chicago dog. The only thing it doesn't need is the cucumber, but I personally like cucumbers, so I'm not complaining. Vienna Beef turned me on to hot dogs, can't go wrong. I wasn't even a hot dog lover until I moved to Chicago and had my first taste of a Vienna Beef hot dog. It is just that good. 

French fries are greasy, but so what? Blot the excess oil off and move on. Decor? Not so fancy, but the food rocks and the place is clean (and it's a hot dog stand !) 

And to my fellow yelper who was turned off my the corn dog, get over it please. You don't go to this place for a corn dog. Go to Hot Dog on a Stick. I'll go to this family owned joint for fast service and GREAT Chicago dogs any day of the week."}
{"text":"Dogs are Delish, buns are a bit soggy for me but overall a good Chicago dog. Ditto on poor customer friendliness, not on their menu. You won't receive a down home greeting. Enjoy the food and by by."}
{"text":"You can't beat a good Vienna Beef hot dog... and Higley Hot Dog makes a good Vienna Beef dog. :) This is a small shop, located right on Williams Field Rd, just west of Higley Rd on the south side of the street- you can't miss it, it's shaped like a hot dog. 

They also have other menu items: Gyros, corn dogs, Brats, etc. (just to name a few). I'm a sucker for \"mom and pop\" type businesses that do business well and this place is one of them. Don't forget your cash... no plastic accepted."}
{"text":"Just a great hotdog, it feels like a family place, and I love hanging out with friends there. The chili dog is superb."}
{"text":"Gosh, I was really hoping the offerings from this quaint-mom and pop- cash only place was going ti be awesome. Alas, that was not the case. It was certainly like going to my mom's place, simple hot dogs with condiments I can get at the grocery store. Nothing special about the food, chili dog, kraut dog and chili cheese fries in the slightest. Finished the chili dog, ate a few chili cheese fries, and just one bite of the kraut dog and I was done. Dang I had high hopes. How it survives I do not know. Nice people running the place though. :)"}
{"text":"Great place for a good dog. Just a heads up, bring cash and be prepared to sit outside if it's busy."}
{"text":"Best Dogs out side of Chicago. Wish they took debit cards instead of Cash only !"}
{"text":"My favorite hotdog place in the valley. I've tried nearly all the hotdog places. Nobody beats the value or taste here. Just don't forget to bring cash!"}
{"text":"The once thriving metropolis of Higley Arizona has been absorbed by the ever expanding Gilbert municipality but not Higley Hotdogs!! Come and check out their Chicago Dogs!"}
{"text":"OMG!  What happened?  Was there an ownership change?  Suppliers changed?

Staffing was friendly and fast but ... 

The Gyros was anemic and the pita wasn't toasted well, if at all.  The Polish was barely edible and somewhat cold in the middle.


Pizza Puff was good and hot."}
{"text":"Good hot dogs, but not amazing. I also thought $10 was pricey for two dogs and a side of fries."}
{"text":"Coming from the east coast these dogs are just like home.  Best Chicago dogs we have come across thus far in the 8 years we have been out here.  Will be coming back for sure."}
{"text":"I will start with eating a steamed dog on a steamed bun is probably not this Detroiters preferred delivery mechanism.  Charcoal (Ted's) / Rollers or Flat top (Detroit Coney Grill).  However when in Higley...  Definitely doesn't stack up to the places mentioned above, but it is an OK fill in"}
{"text":"Love the vibe here!!! So, so friendly, great food, such an enjoyable experience to sit and enjoy a hot dog with you loved ones! The only bummer is they close early and my husband can never make it after work. Definitely a weekend hang for us... Heads up- they only take cash! :)"}
{"text":"5 star Chicago style hot dog!! I've been to Chicago and this hot dog is almost exactly the same.  It's a small mom and pop place with straight to the point service.  Always order the dog with everything on it otherwise you're just not getting the full pleasure of a Chicago style hot dog."}
{"text":"I've driven past the Higley Hot Dog Hut for what seems like an eternity - and I'm not exactly sure why. A few weeks ago my in-laws ate here and had nothing but praise for this little joint, so I decided to give it try while my son and I were out and about.

This place is not a palace by any means, but if you are looking for the authentic Chicago dog experience, with real Vienna beef franks, poppy seed buns and the rest of the garden, then drive no further. 

First off, heed the advice everyone else has posted and re-posted. Tip #1: bring cash. I almost never carry cash on my and on the one day that I decided to stop here I was lucky enough to have some on me. Catastrophe avoided.

Tip #2: You place your order outside on the left side of the hut and then proceed to enter through the door on the front of the building to grab a table. If you forget these instructions, there is a sign inside that will remind you to \"ORDER OUTSIDE\". If you miss that, a few helpful patrons will kindly inform you that \"you're doing it wrong\"....

If you want the original Chicago-style dog, simply order a hot dog with \"the works\" and you will get all the good stuff piled on. On this visit, I went with one of these and a fire dog - which was actually a little different in flavor and not so spicy, but it was equally as good.

Fries were okay, but somehow I missed the fact that they had chili cheese fries and pizza puffs. They are on my culinary bucket list for my next trip here. The staff working the counter was friendly and the service was fast - we had our food and drinks in about 10 minutes. 

Finally, if you plan on making a pit stop here for lunch, be aware that this place is small and seating space is limited - they do get busy on the weekends. As long as you keep this in mind, bring cash and know the ordering procedure you will be fine. I will definitely be back here again, since I don't have any place near me that serves up the 'real deal' like Higley Hot Dog Hut does. Good job guys!"}
{"text":"Yum! Stopped in for a bite for the first time and yes were like HUM when we saw the cash only sign BUT it was clearly visible. Hubby said I only have $13 so we looked at the menu and didn't see this as being a problem. We each got a wonderful fully loaded hot dog, order of fries and a drink for less then $10. Fresh hot and delicious! What a deal! We will definitely be back! BTW Go Pack Go! The complaints on cash only & the hours should not be reflective of the rating :("}
{"text":"Was looking forward to eating here for the first time and wanting to give this place 5-stars, but since it's a CASH ONLY kind of joint, I didn't actually eat here as I rarely carry cash anymore. Don't know if they have an ATM machine inside, but I'm too cheap to pay ATM fees anyway, so I went elsewhere. Better luck next time."}
{"text":"Love this place. The location is just off the San Tan Mall area but conveniently near our house. The hours are only during the daytime, which is a bummer, but it is a fun place to visit. 

After walking up to the order windows on one side of the location you see the menu. It's nothing crazy but the typical hot dog, burger, corn dog, pizza puff, fries menu. The prices are reasonable and the food is pretty great. 

We've had a handful of things here and ultimately ya nothing extremely special. The hot dogs are probably my favorite as they are good ol Chicago style steamed and styled dogs. Everything else appears to be just frozen, fried, and served - still good but it's not homemade stuff. 

The milkshakes are bomb. They're pretty good size and taste great - of course! Ha 

Overall, this is a good stop with friendly service. Again I'd really only order a hot dog from here, Chicago style of course, with fries and maybe a burger. Just remember CASH ONLY!"}
{"text":"I'm from California, travel a lot for work. This place was recommended by a coworker (was lucky to be given the cash only heads up). Any who, i ordered the works, and some cheese fries. The dog was amazing, and the cheese fries are exactly what you would expect. Didn't realize they had sandwiches until after I already ordered, will definitely return for that Italian beef sandwich, maybe some pizza puffs."}
{"text":"Absolutely awesome hotdogs for very reasonable prices - very dirty however! They're currently in the process of a little remodel and I will return soon to see. Would recommend if you're looking for a good hotdog fix."}
{"text":"This place is  my favorite thing about going to the ribbon store!
Best hot dogs with all the works for a perfect Chicago dog! The fries are always fresh and hot. Don't let the tiny little shack appearance fool you. This place is absolutely worth stopping for! 
And the best part? It's a good price. $6.25 for my \"works\" Vienna beef hot dog, fries, and medium drink. I'll take that over Mickey D's any day. 
Keep up the good work, guys. I already can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"wow pretty good stuff right here . Chicago dog was real good with all the fixing and we had a pizza puff little different but was a deep fried treat of pizza. Nice little out the way place with some good dogs .."}
{"text":"Why even come to this place WHEN IT'S NEVER OPEN?! Sunday at 3:00 in the afternoon and you're closed? Do not plan a special trip to this place unless you have 100% proof that they're open. Such a waste of an amazing, great tasting restaurant."}
{"text":"Dirty, no one wears gloves.Owner not nice at all, also be prepared to pay only cash & no receipts.  Not only that the food was cold,place too small, no where to sit at all.Review is true, Correct the problems."}
{"text":"This is my all time FAVORITE place for a good hot dog, yummy fries, and chocolate shakes! The Chicago dog is my favorite! I have been going here since I was a kid and it will always be number one in my book!!! If you love a good hot dog this is the place!"}
{"text":"Cash only. First visit here. Fire dog and chili chesse fries are good. Hot dog are not huge,  1 with a side or two dogs would make a great meal.  Very good pricing. Outside seating only. Walk thru ordering thru window. Small parking area. Good food. Will try again"}
{"text":"Since we moved near the Higley Hot Dog Hut and I have been itching to try it. My favorite quick meal is hot dogs. I would be okay eating a hot dog everyday. 

When I called to see if they were open the lady that answered said, \"we are open until 4:30 pm today, but do not come a few minutes before then because we won't be able to serve you.\" It was a little off-putting. I was a bit confused, but did understand her point. She proceeded to say, \"I mean we are ready to leave at 4:00 to be honest.\" I appreciate you honesty and I understand the subtext of the comment, but as a person that has worked customer service for 12 years, this is the one thing I have always been told not to say to customers.

I ordered two chili cheese dogs: one with sauerkraut and one with sauerkraut and onions. When I got home, that is not what I received. One was just a chili dog with sauerkraut and the other was a dog with relish. The person before me ordered two plain dogs with ketchup. I'm not sure where the mixup occurred. 

The dog itself was good. The chili was decent, pretty sure it's from a can but no points deducted for this. 

Overall the service is quick. I was pleased with that. I would be willing to give three stars, but I can't justify a wrong order for that. Also, the initial impression for customer service was off-putting."}
{"text":"Was down the street from me so I thought I would check it out since I really love chilli dogs. Have to pay in cash only not a big deal for me but it does limit them.  I got the chilli cheese fries and chilli cheese hotdog.  Was pretty cheap didn't spend too much. But the fries could have been way better and they usesd cheese sauce. Cheese sauce is cool if you are getting ghetto nachos (gas station nachos) but not on everything. The chilli tasted like it was from a can also. They were messy but not a big deal for me.  Dogs are good but other than that they were ok. Not the greatest but if you want cheap and quick they are good. Pretty much a place I'll go again if I just want to be lazy and not go far from,my place. So pretty much over all it was decent."}
{"text":"Here's what you do:

1. Swing by an ATM for some cash. Otherwise, you're S.O.L.
2. Go to the Higley Hot Dog Hut.
3. Don't look around too much. It's a hut after all...
4. Get the Works Dog. Maybe get two.
5. Enjoy.
6. Return to Yelp and thank me for steps 1-5."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. My youngest childhood are you coming here and my family eating with my family. I'm a creature of habit so I always order the same thing. I got the Polish dog loaded which is phenomenal. They have the real Chicago style not like these other places. I I have never ordered anything different besides french fries because that's how amazing the polish dog is. From when I was a child to walking in now with an adult nothing has changed its that old-school atmosphere . Seriously this is the best mom and pop place to go to in Arizona."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time yesterday. I had a chili cheese dog and fries. In case you're a bit confused like I was, you order from the front window outside, and walk around to the side of the hut to eat inside, where you will pick your food up from another window. You also have the option to eat outside. The owners were super nice, and helpful. The food was decently priced, and was pretty good. They take cash only, so be prepared! I really liked the humble family atmosphere, as they have photos of family on the walls, and Chicago memorabilia. They were really clean. The only downside is that the food was really greasy, but I guess that is to be expected of a chili cheese dog and fries. Overall, good experience."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE!   great people great food what else could you want.  It's simply the best little hotdog stand in the East Valley."}
{"text":"LOVE this place. I've driven by it many times, but always late at night after they were closed. Yesterday I was craving a hot dog, so we drove over with the pup. OMG! I found my happy place! It reminds me so much of the dive hot dog spots back home (Chicago). I love the Vienna beef dogs, and steamed (bun included) is the ONLY way to eat them if you're from Chicago. I was extatic to see they use poppy seed buns. It's a rare sight in this part of the country. Unlike most Chicagoans, I like my dog simple. Nothing on it but golden liquid deliciousness (cheese). I ordered two plain dogs, a side of cheese, an order of fries, and two corn dogs for us. Total was around $10. Well worth the drive! I was so happy with this place that I will likely easily convince myself to go back again today.  Oh.... And the pup definitely approved of the fries, hot dog, and the \"oh how cute\" comments from other hot dog junkies."}
{"text":"If you like it \"your way\", than this is the place!  I had everything and saurkraut.  Due to construction, we passed it by originally, but turned around and found it. It was so worth the search.  If you like hotdogs give Higley's a try."}
{"text":"Four stars for a reasonable price and some tasty dogs!

Came by HHDH on a Monday at 1130.  Steady stream of diners all had smiles on their faces!

I got a polish w/ mustard, onions and relish -- so damn tasty, I could have eaten four more!  Wife got the chili dog and she was very happy.  Future son-in-law went with the Works, and said all the ingredients were tasty and fresh.  He also got the potato salad which he inhaled, and I got the fries (regrettably, undercooked, yet the only negative of the day).  Three dogs, three drinks, and two sides = $15.  More than reasonable price for some tasty dogs!

Cheers!
RS"}
{"text":"I called on a Sunday to see if they are open,  when I called the lady was rude answered the phone \"hellloooo\" I asked is this Higley hot dogs, because I could finish she replied yup this is the hot dog and and we are close. Mind you this was all with an attitude. 
I'm highly disappointed. 
If you have a business phone as a personal phone was should switch to two line and if your close don't answer or answer the phone saying your companies name and nicely say we are closed. 
Just a simple customer service tip."}
{"text":"This has been a favorite stop of mine since I moved to Gilbert in the mid 80's!  My favorite is the Chicago Dog and Chili Cheese Fries.  This has been a family (Father, Mother, Son and Daughter in Law) are the only employees and now serve up this delicious food 7 days a week!  They also have great shakes!"}
{"text":"Family owned company, with great prices and great hot dogs. The hot dogs are great with a nice atmosphere. The lines move fast and the food comes pretty quick. One time I had the kiddos in the car and the owner came out and delivered my hotdog to me in the car. The only downside is they aren't open later at night which would be amazing. But I'm sure it makes sense for their budget."}
{"text":"This place is the bomb and we are going again this week. Authentic Chicago Dog!!!!  Hoping to go back this week!"}
{"text":"We love this place. Fair warning, it is cash only so bring some old fashioned paper money. I have only had one thing there that I'd say is \"average\" and that's the corn dog. I've tried about every dog on the menu (besides chili dogs because I couldn't do that to my family!) and I have really liked them all. The Kraut dog, Milwaukee Brat, and Polish dog are my favorites. It's obviously hard to mess up a hot dog but I think it's equally difficult to make them as good as they do. Good dogs, good buns, and the toppings are good as well (I get the works on everything except the kraut dog, keep that simple). Between my wife, my son, and myself we usually get 6 hot dogs, a corn dog, and a drink or two and walk out only $20 down. It's one of our favorites."}
{"text":"We have passed this place many times going to and from church and on the last day of Vacation Bible School decided to treat the grandkids and am I glad I did.  You order outside and eat inside (a novelty here) and the place is small, but well maintained.  My granddaughter had the Polish dog that was so good she had another. My grandson and I opted for the chili dogs which were smothered in homemade chili that was awesome!  All three of us shared an order of chili cheese fries and they were great. The best part is that the three of us kept within my budged and walked away stuffed.  There were many more options on the menu that I intend to sample soon. The service was the quickest I have encountered in a long time; we barely had time to find a seat and our food was ready!

Bring cash; they don't take credit cards, but I promise the prices won't hurt your wallet!"}
{"text":"I've been to Higley Hot Dog Hut a few times now for a quick lunch pickup on the way to meet my boyfriend at his work and bring him food. We like to order a polish hotdog (mine with nothing but ketchup on it, his loaded with condiments) and then a chocolate and vanilla shake. Sometimes we will sit inside and eat, and other times we take it on the go.

Either way, we have both been served promptly and courteously by the owners and the prices are a little high, but the shakes are super cheap for a large, and being a mom-and-pop business, higher prices are expected. Overall, I like this place and i do recommend it to family and friends."}
