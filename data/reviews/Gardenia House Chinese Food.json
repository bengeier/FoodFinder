{"text":"Classic Canadian Chinese food. Greasy? Yup. Tasty? You bet. Fast service? Hell yes!

Dinner for 2b is my standard go-to dish. $20, and it's enough for my wife, me, and two kids. The chicken wings a decent. Good value on the small pack of wings and fries. Lots of options on the menu.

Take-out only. No tables inside"}
{"text":"Always fresh food love it! Been ordering from here for a couple of years now.  Even after I've moved I often get it when I'm in the area"}
{"text":"Heart the chicken balls, good sized chicken and right amount of dough. Fried rice is ok but every beef dish I've tried has been yum."}
{"text":"I've ordered from here several times now and I've been very happy with each order. The food always seems fresh and all the chicken and veggie dishes I've tried have been delicious. Give Gardenia House a try, I don't think you'll be disappointed."}
