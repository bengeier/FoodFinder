{"text":"Best bathrooms ive2 seen for a long time, nice and spacious BUT unfortunately everything has MSG so we left. Wife wont tolerate it. Shame"}
{"text":"Hands down the best Pho broth I have tasted in my short time in Calgary. The staff is extremely friendly and the food consistently delicious."}
{"text":"No vegetarian options on the menu... The waitress told me they could do vermicelli with no meat, or they could do soup. Only 2 options. I ordered vermicelli and I also asked for vege salad rolls. I received just a bowl of cooked vegetables, no noodles, and it still came with fish sauce. Salad rolls were way too chewy. My dad ordered vermicelli with beef, was okay but he said the meat was a bit fatty. Definitely not the best Vietnamese. They do have delicious tea! And you can buy a bag for ~$3 from the counter. Will only be coming here to buy more tea when I run out."}
{"text":"Pho Hoan Pasteur is a chain in Calgary, it is my go to pho place. I was very happy they opened up in Quarry Park close to my work. Service is good and they are pretty quick. Their pho sate is very good with some mild spice and their pho tai is good as well. I love how hot the soup is when we get our bowl of Pho. Recommend this place for a quick lunch or a warm dinner."}
{"text":"One of my new favorite places for Vietnamese food. Nothing really out of the ordinary here. Has your usual items on the menu like Pho soups, vermicelli bowls, rice with pork etc. The one thing I especially like is the option to have your soup with egg noodles. I personally don't care for the rice noodles. Other then that the restaurant itself is a big open space and is relatively clean. It was formally called the Colonial Fusion. It's located directly east of the TD bank. In the Quarry Park shopping center which is anchored by the Co op."}
{"text":"Wow! Pho Hoan Pasteur nails it.  When my companion and I arrived we were greeted by a friendly waitress. She sat us at a comfy booth an asked if the seating was okay. She bought us complimentary tea before takng our order. The decor had a pleasant, spacious, clean and open feel. There was a generous selection of reasonably priced menu items. We were both happy and quickly chowed down.  I had the chicken noodle soup and my companion had chicken and spring rolls that came with a pretty salad garnish. It is wonderful to have a great quality and reasonably priced pho place in Quarry Park! :-)"}
{"text":"4.5 Stars. First off, I am super picky with pho. The dish itself is pretty simple, so I believe it should be done right. The broth here was definitely up to standard! The portions were good, as well as the price.   The service was pleasant as well, tea was brought right away and everything was done in a timely manner. I was super impressed by the cleanliness of this restaurant (though I know it's pretty new, so I guess this part may take some time to gauge properly).   It's nice to see some Vietnamese cuisine in the Mahogany plaza since it's mostly Western food! I'll definitely be back and hope they don't change their prices/portions. They also had a few big tables (seats probably 8-10) for larger parties! There is plenty of parking in the plaza."}
{"text":"Honestly the worst experience I've ever had in a Vietnamese restaurant. The food was cold, the meat was chewy and fatty. We even overheard another table saying they were going to go home to eat after trying the food. Save yourself. Go somewhere else. Anywhere else. The only positive thing I can say is the people were nice."}
{"text":"Just ordered here for the first time. Was amazed by the friendliness of the staff, the promptness of our order and the quality and quantity of the food  Highly recommended if looking for friendly, fast delicious Vietnamese food"}
{"text":"I was lured in by pics and interactions on Instagram so have been anxiously waiting to try this place out and was rather disappointed. The #48 Satay Beef Pho was a milky broth with a quite peculiar flavor compared to most Pho ive had. It honestly tasted like it wouldve been better as a gravy! Once the waitress dropped off the soup I never saw her again! I did not get a drink refill until I literally went upto the counter with my cup and called into the kitchen. Another customer was requiring something and her \"hello's!?\" into the kitchen were just left completely unanswered. The ONLY good thing I can say about the experience was the shaved beef was unbelievably fresh and tasty. Price point was fair but unfortunately I wont be back."}
{"text":"3.5 stars so I'm rounding it up.  We came here on their opening day for dinner around 7pm.  With multiple locations in Calgary, Edmonton and Fort Saskatchewan, I was surprised to see the restaurant in a bit of a disarray.  There was no procedure setup to separate takeout and dine-in customers and it appears that they were seating people based on a first come first served bases.  Unfortunately, they don't seem to keep track of who was here first.  After about 15 mins of waiting we were finally seated.   Menus came immediately and teas were served.  The tea was very light but has a unique flavour that I can't quite pinpoint. We ordered our food and proceed to wait 45mins for our pho, bun and com dinner.  Again, we understand it was opening night and the restaurant was packed but we did not expect to wait 45 mins for the food at a Vietnamese restaurant as they are normally much much  faster.  On the bright side, I had time to create this page for them. :)  Pho, was quite decent! It had great flavour and was loaded with fresh meat. You can smell and taste all of the spices in their broth which was quite nice. This is definitely one of the better pho I've had in the Deep South.   Rice vermicelli with grill pork and spring roll was a bit too sweet for us.  We felt the pork marinate was on the sweeter side which was nice with the noodles without the fish sauce. However, with the fish sauce on the sweeter side too, we felt like we were eating candy.  The spring roll tasted ok.   Rice with grilled pork and fried eggs, was delicious.  The pork was grilled perfectly.    Overall, we were quite pleased with the everything we had and would likely come back.  I'm confident that by tomorrow's service they will have some sort of a system in place so that waiting time will be reduced."}
{"text":"Really happy to have another restaurant within walking distance in Quarry Park!  Pho Hoan Pasteur is in the space previously occupied by Colonial Restaurant. They had a fire shortly after I moved to the area, and it sadly sat empty for about 3 years! Needless to say, we were really happy to see another restaurant open, and are always happy to support local businesses in our neighbourhood!  Overall, our meal was yummy, reasonably priced, and the service was fast and friendly. We will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"First time we came here, the staff was beyond incredible. Super friendly and to top it off, the food is absolutely delicious. No matter what time of the day, you can totally tell the food is always fresh.  We keep coming back here because they're amazing!"}
{"text":"I just did a review on their new mahogany location. I eat a lot of pho, I make pho, my family makes it...I basically grew up with it. This place, my broth was greasy and it tasted dirty... (broth is supposed to be clear). The ratio of broth to noodles was off, I barely got any broth so I was basically just eating soggy noodles. The beef is strange, texture is slimy, I don't know what beef they use but it's of low standard especially in Alberta. I will never go back to this restaurant or the mahogany location. I felt sick twice after eating here and at the other place, I heard other people have gotten sick as well. Not sure why their broth is so murky or why it tastes dirty. I also can't bring myself to eat their beef."}
{"text":"This was my first time ordering from this place and it was disappointing. The only reason I'm giving 2 stars is because the food is average and the service is awful. I ordered takeout around 11am, I thought it would be quick because it was early and I had to get to work. There was odd, club music pumping out of a large stereo for some reason? There was a large, custom order in front of me that seemed to eclipse anything I needed. It took almost 25 minutes from time of ordering until my food came out. I had to make eye contact several times before someone realized that perhaps they should make my small order and worry about the large one after, since it was so complicated. When my food came out it was plunked down so fast on a small ledge that when she turned away, the bag with the pho soup fell backwards, pouring out all over the floor. They made me another, of course, but it further delayed me. I certainly didn't feel valued as a customer and the food turned out to be quite average. I won't be going back with so much competition out there."}
{"text":"One of the few Vietnamese restaurants that offer different bowl sizes ranging from small to extra large. I love that the rare beef is actually rare and not well done. By far one of the best Vietnamese restaurants in the south that sticks to a true pho flavour. The service is wonderful and the quality of food is excellent. New favourite pho restaurant!"}
{"text":"This is so far the best TASTING Pho restaurant I have ever stepped foot in. When J walked in we were instantly noticed and taken to a table. We were brought our drinks in a timely fashion and all was well with ordering food. Meat was cooked perfect, foot was H-O-T, and everything was appetizing. I have zero complaints about the food. We were well taken care of. Only complaint I have is the waitress was drying spoons in the middle of the restaurant and just tossing them in a bin and it made for a very loud noise that I didn't want to constantly hear. Very nice staff to say the least. I recommend this place if you haven't been and I would say if you have been here that you will know how good the restaurant is. Keep it up!"}
{"text":"First time ordering in on opening weekend and it was packed.   Line up for take out and for dining in. Menu has lots of Pho  choices and pricing is reasonable.   Staff were friendly and looked stressed out but happy to help out customers.   Had the pork and spring rolls with vermicelli noodles. Fish maw was good and overall I be trying it again.   This is fourth location in Calgary and first large sit down for Pho for SE Calgary (on the new side that is). Overall you want Pho be sure to call or come early to enjoy less wait times."}
{"text":"Fantastic. Say goodbye to all the imitators in the SE. Finally a proper pho restaurant. Try the Bun Bo Hue. One of the best."}
{"text":"Another location has opened up, now in Mahogany. As with everything else that's opening in the plaza, it's crazy busy. This past weekend they were celebrating their grand opening and giving everyone an extra 10% off their orders, which I'm sure added to the hype.  Everything about my dinner here last night was on par for Vietnamese in Calgary. We waited about 10 minutes for a table. I've never waited for a table at a Vietnamese place before but it's new, so it was expected. We were sat at a table right inside the door where there's only about 6 tables with the rest being on the other side of the restaurant. This area is good for groups as the tables are close together and can easily fit 12-14 people together. However, it's a little squishy for separate couples or families to enjoy dinner without bumping elbows.  I went with the (#1) steak pho and my wife had her go-to (#32) grilled pork with spring roll bun. Both were average. The portions are a good size and for $30 for the two of us, the prices are good too."}
{"text":"Best peanut satay soup you will have. Period.  A little heavy on the noodles sometimes, so a tip is to ask for extra broth!"}
