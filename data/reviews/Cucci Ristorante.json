{"text":"A real gem in Bronte.  Every detail is looked after; food, service, and entertainment are tasty, attentive and accommodating.  Most recent visit was a birthday celebration with a group of 10, Cucci gladly decanted the 3L of tight Pinot Noir we brought with us, and served and presented our meals like we were a table of 2, even though the restaurant was full that evening.  We did however resort to the wine list after consuming our own and found it as always thorough and reasonably priced.  Keep up the with the great experiences Cucci."}
{"text":"A local favorite. Food is great, as is the service. Been there multiple times and I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"I had heard very good things about this place, and finally gave it a try recently. I came away with mixed feelings ... first the good:  very pretty restaurant, warm inviting interior, great outdoor patio in good weather, great menu, excellent food, good attentive service. But, .... very expensive for what you get .. definitely downtown TO prices, and although I'm glad they're in my neighbourhood (Bronte village), and want them to succeed, I doubt I'll be back soon. Just don't feel you get value for the prices charged .. and that's a shame, because it has a lot going for it."}
{"text":"The service is amazing and the food is just to die for! We had such a great waiter that was so attentive."}
{"text":"The venue was very clean and the room looked very nice. Thank you. Service was attentive, guests seemed pleased.
 
To provide some so feedback on dinner, there are a couple of items I would like to mention:
* The veal was very tough. I had the veal as well as did several other guests from my party and the feedback was that the veal was very tough and the pieces we inedible. Taste seemed fine, but the pieces could not even be cut with the knives provided, let alone chewed. I am not sure if they were end-pieces or not, but there was membrane that was not broken-down which deemed the veal scaloppini not chewable.
* The Organic Greens Salad was inconsistent. Comparing the presentation of the salad dishes, there were several portions that were exploding with a generous mixture of chick peas and greens, while the plates right next to them had only greens and lacking any chick peas. We found that there was no consistency between the salad servings and the portions varied from guest-to-guest.
 
The soup was impressive, tagliatelle and salmon dishes had a very nice presentation and feedback was great on these plates, and panna cotta was simple yet good. Just the major item was how inedible the veal was. Not sure if it was a bad batch or cut, but it was not good.

I find it hard to imagine I will be back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Ive been here quite a few times, and food and service have been consistent and far above most comparable oakville restaurants without the pretentiousness.   Knowledgeable staff, solid wine list and bar, quality food prepared with care, under the watchful eye of restraunteur Doug Grecco (sp?).  
Ive sampled a good chunk of the menu and my fav's are the mushrooms on toast, oysters, sweet breads, rack of lamb, halibut, gnocchi, and braised lamb.... hard to pick.  Also one of the few places that serve the Steigel Radler.  
Weekends with live music are fun to sit at the bar or patio and have a drink and appy when things are busy."}
{"text":"Dinner on a Saturday night to celebrate a 30th wedding anniversary.

Beautiful ambience (perhaps a bit on the dark side). New York style ?

The \"bubble\" served with a raspberry, perfectly chilled. A good start.

We were three and our order included mussels, graved lax, risotto, duck breast...all prepared to perfection. Delicious !

The Sancerre matched very well with the food.

The deserts from a small but tempting desert menu were all exquisite.

Service was impeccable all throughout.

A wonderful dining experience at this occasion very important to the family.

Although pricy Cucci will always be our first choice to celebrate special events.

Can't wait to go back....."}
{"text":"My now husband and I chose Cucci for a lunch for our family a week ago after our wedding ceremony. We booked their private dining room and had about a dozen people in attendance. The restaurant wasn't open yet so we had the full attention of the servers. The room itself was beautifully decorated with lovely personalized place settings and side table for gifts and our wedding cake. We decided to go with a fixed menu and had the room for about 3 hours though we were encouraged to take our time and not rush. The food, including antipasto, chicken, salmon and veal were delicious and well seasoned, and we appreciated the kids menu option as well for our nephews.The inside of the restaurant is tasteful and the location conveniently close to the lake for after meal walks. Thank you for making our intimate wedding reception lunch very special!"}
{"text":"Excellent resto, great service, great wine list, and worth the drive to oakville.  I have gone with large groups several times, and have been totally satisfied. They really cater to their clients and make you feel welcome and comfortable. Everything on the menu is excellent."}
{"text":"I attended Cucci recently for a well deserved night out without the kids!  This is an elegant and busy restaurant.   The food was great and the meal was not rushed.  My wife enjoyed taking our time and enjoying our meal.  If you deserve a night out and want something outside of the norm check this place out.  It is pricey but worth it."}
{"text":"Cant stop thinking about the excellent food that was prepared by the Chef the service was excellent and request were accomodated . Will definitely ho back !!! EAT ! 
Came back after 4 days for lunch ... still perfect"}
{"text":"Being from the Toronto area I was not to familiar with restaurants in the west end

My mother selected Cucci as she is from the area and spoke very highly of it

For starters we had the grilled calamari with a tomato chorizo mix and it was fabulous, calamari grilled to perfection and the chorizo added a nice punch 

For our mains my mother had the eggplant parm and I had the spaghetti/linguine vongole (mini clams) 

The pasta was cooked al dente and there was an abundance of clams. The presentation was nice and I really enjoyed it

The eggplant parm was just as tasty, melted on your mouth and was nicely put together  

The waite staff was very courteous and very knowledgable about the wine selection 


Over all I would have given it a 5 but the pasta was a pinch of salt away from being perfectly seasoned and for the price I expect it to be perfect 

I would highly recommend cucci to anyone"}
{"text":"Loved food, cocktails atmosphere,  wait staff fabulous, had steak, it was made to perfection of my liking."}
{"text":"Went there for dinner years ago when it first opened. Nothing has changed. The service is better than the food, and the piano player remains intrusive and irritating. How other people think this is a great restaurant is a mystery."}
{"text":"I was here for my FIL's 70th birthday, and we were a group of 14. Service was top notch and we all felt very well taken care of. 

I had the Burrata appetizer and it was delicious - creamy burrata cheese, crispy prosciutto, grapes... very delicate and delicious. My boyfriend had the grilled calamari and he said it was the best-grilled calamari he's had in a long time.

For my main, I went with the homemade gnocchi and they were so tender and light! Gnocchi can be such a heavy meal, but this was perfect! The black truffle cream sauce was divine! 

Will definitely return for a special evening out."}
{"text":"Happy New Year to us!  We booked a private table in the back of the restaurant way in advance and told management that we had young kids with us. The reservation was for 5:30 so we weren't keeping the kids up by any means. 45 minutes into the dinner, we were asked to leave because we were disturbing some of he patrons!!  I've gone out to dinner with kids on New Year's Eve in downtown Toronto for the past 4 years and not once have we been asked to leave a restaurant. 

Hey management, if one patron was complaining, why don't you comp them an appetizer or some wine? 

Horrible experience."}
{"text":"I love a packed restaurant - you know it's going to be good right from the get go and Cucci delivered in spades.

We started at the bar with cocktails as our table was turning over, the martinis were excellent and bang on to our particular (and persnickity) order.  We sat beside the piano and player and that too was appealing and not at all corny.

My buddies and I started with a dozen oysters as we finished off our marts and ordered a 2008 Zinfandel (Tin Roof) in time to open nicely for our mains. 

We then ordered two salads to be split into thirds; the roasted beet and goat cheese and the caesar with house pancetta, confit garlic & capers.  Both were excellent and portioned and presented perfectly.

Oddly enough we were all attracted to the same main course the Wild Boar Ragout - Rough house cut pasta with tomato & olives.  Again, it was portioned perfectly (meaning we all got the exact same portion) and it was without doubt one of the best pastas I have had in a while (I don't eat pasta that often but we were all scheduled for a cycling event the next day so we thought carbs).  

This pasta was meaty and the starch and protein were perfectly balanced. I would order it again and it would be the perfect choice with a glass of red at the bar after a work out, on the way home or if you're heading home late from work and don't feel like cooking (I wonder if they do take out?)

Service was outstanding, we ordered another bottle of wine and took the balance of a bottle home corked and bagged.  It was a $400 + night and I felt we got all that value and more."}
{"text":"Had a lovely dinner here and will definitely be back. We ordered the burrata which tasted fresh but kind of lacked flavour and for entrees I had the gnocchi which was excellent and my fiancé had the chicken which was also delicious. Service was ok, our waitress seemed a little distracted but was friendly and the other server filling water and picking up dishes was great. Atmosphere was very romantic but the noise level was a bit much due to the live music performer. Overall it was a great experience and I'm actually looking forward to going back and trying more dishes."}
{"text":"Been here several times, it's pricey but worth it ! The Caesar Salad is one of the best I've ever had. This place will save you a trip to downtown TO. The filet is always perfection & the braised lamb special I tried the other night was very tasty."}
{"text":"Lives up to reputation. Service was impeccable. Food was very well prepared. The charcuterie. The bread pudding. The caprese salad. The duck ragliatone -- delicious.  The flavors were sensational -- maybe not quite an absolute five in comparison to the best I've ever eaten, but worth the price for a fine dining experience."}
{"text":"On my very recent visit to Toronto the weather was atrocious. It snowed or sleeted everyday. But foodies like me are not going to be deterred by these minor impediments. 
I visited three different restaurants and I will start with sharing my experience with you at Cucci. 
This is a gem of a place. 
The food is exquisite and the service was impeccable. 
The barrata, shrimp and fresh oysters were our choices for for starters and, Mon Dieu, they were magnifique. 
My entree was the Branzino. A very unique preparation but, nonetheless, exquisite. 
This baby is going on my culinary Rolodex.
The service was extraordinary especially by John   Kudos. 
A very memorable experience."}
{"text":"Went to this place for a diner for 8 people. Reservations was a difficult process. They complained they were busy and if we came at 5:45 we would have to leave by 8:30. And they kept reminding us of that even as they were swarming the table to clean it up just as we stood up to leave. Not a nice thing to do. They actually told us to leave several times. Chill out people. It was close to turning ugly. 

The food was very good. No complaints with any of the dishes. Some timing was off with delivering to everyone but acceptable given the size of our group and the number of people in the restaurant.  We had fish, chicken and steak between us and it was presented very well.  We had a couple special requests and changes to the dishes and they were accommodated without question and delivered perfectly. 

Good selection of wine.  Cocktails were good but they failed my Cesar test. It was lame. Just in a glass with a lime wedge. It's a simple drink and something every bar should know how to do. 

They had a live band and the volume was just right and they played a good selection of music. 

As it was around Christmas they also had a Santa and Mrs. Clause. That was a nice touch. 

The biggest complaint I have is the ignorance of the waitress in pronouncing the dishes. It's almost as if she intentionally pronounced tagliatelle with a hard G and when I politely corrected her she was rude and told me not to interrupt her because  she was reciting the specials. How can you work in an Italian restaurant and not even try to pronounce the food.  I'm Italian and if you are going to use the language at least make an effort. How come Vietnamese soup has to be pronounced correctly but not Italian food. 

The place looked very nice. The decor was a comfortable look. The lighting was a bit dark and then they dimmed the lights even more all at once. That again is just plain stupid. It takes time for our eyes to adjust to light changes. You are a moron for doing that. You can purchase an inexpensive light programming kit that will gradually dim the lights and people would not even notice. 

I would go back with a smaller group but would request not to be served by the same waitress.  I'm surprised the owners have not picked up on her."}
{"text":"Has become our date night fav. Mushrooms on toast there sounds simple, but is best appetizer I've had from any restaurant!  We enjoy the live music on piano there, Terry at the bar remembers our drinks and names, Doug the owner will stop and chat while they have also 2 sommeliers there to recommend new wines or drinks.  Highly recommend !"}
{"text":"Celebration with family and the first time come here and it has a good parking and it has a outdoor seating and the place is amazing, the staff are great and they tell you today special beside the menu and it's a good atmosphere and cool design and it a Italian Cuisine and I tried the Lamb and it's was so delicious and you must try their desserts menu and they have a Wine List with white and sparkling Wines and soup of the day is a must try !! It's great with family and friends and party's and you can do private dining and you can reserve table online!! So I highly recommend this place 10/10"}
{"text":"Absolutely Oustanding!

The great reviews about Cucci are all true. If you rate a fabulous dining experience as one that includes personalized, professional service with a lot of humility, a warm and intimate interior without being dungeon-like, and food that will tickle your palette, then you will absolutely love Cucci. Is it expensive? Yes. But if you believe that you \"get what you pay for\" then it is not expensive at all.

To begin with, you are greeted at the door by a friendly and humble gentleman with a warm Latin smile and not by a sexy young blonde who judges you by who you are and what you're wearing. We truly felt welcome by the host. We were greeted at our table by a friendly and professional waiter with a Germanic accent who was not over-powering and we were served drinks and food by several friendly wait staff. And all of this in what is supposed to be an Italian restaurant.

If you are there for an intimate dinner, ask for the bench seating along the wall which is perfect for sitting side-by-side with your mate, looking out into the restaurant. If you are a larger group, there are seating options in two rooms and if you're there on your own or also with a friend, the bar is approachable and also comfortable.

They had just introduced a new \"Fall-inspired\" menu which featured a lot of \"hearty\" dishes incorporating seasonal ingredients, artfully integrated into the food. The Mushrooms on Toast appetizer lived up to its signature status with a brilliant arrangement of wild mushrooms on a piece of toasted bread with some parmigiana shavings and a delicate sauce. We literally wanted to lick the plate. We shared the appetizer and without asking, they split the portion onto to plates and where other restaurants would have frowned upon doing this, it was no problem at all at Cucci. The Caesar salad was also wonderful.

For the mains we had the Gnocchi and the Branzino and both dishes were wonderful with flavours complimenting the main items in the dishes. The Gnocchi were some of the best I have tasted with a slightly crisp exterior and a wonderful flavor. For dessert we had the Tiramisu and immediately labelled it as one of the best Tiramisu preparations we ever had. And to make things even better, there were two performers, a guitarist and singer that were the perfect compliment to a perfect evening.

All in all, if you understand that food this good, in an environment this pleasing with staff this professional and humble is not cheap, you will love Cucci."}
{"text":"Excellent! I got the Arctic char, the wine was great. The tuna looked delicious. Great high end atmosphere."}
{"text":"I have been there a few times.  The food and service are excellent.  The staff is always friendly and have always catered to my requests.  The atmosphere in romantic, quiet and had a great time.  I would recommend it"}
{"text":"Great dining experience! The service is excellent; they are very helpful, attentive and pleasant. The food is excellent and portion sizes are generous. I'd come here time and again for special occasions! It's a classy place so dress nicely; they even had a live pianist playing during our meal when we went on Thursday night. I was impressed by the whole night's experience and definitely recommend it to others."}
{"text":"Nice little restaurant. Nice wine list with very reasonable mark ups on them (2x). The food menu is very expensive however. Most of their pasta dishes incorporate seafood so almost all of them are very expensive."}
{"text":"The menu is intriguing and the service is excellent; too bad they couldn't get the food to the table before it reached a tepid temperature."}
{"text":"Great service !!! Great food !!! 
I didn't have any expectation as my boyfriend said it was good on his last two visit. We were in the area for another restaurant but the wait was too long.  So my friend decided to go there instead.  He keep warning me on this restaurant is only okay ...should made to the best 100 reaturant in Canada.  
We sat down in the only available high table.  We were surprised it was quit full on a weeknight.  The server has great knowledge on wine and made a comment on the bottle we pick should match well with our order.  
We had a soup and a dozen oyster as appitizer...the soup was okay and the osyster was fresh.. The interesting part is the sauce.  Other than the tradition seafood sauce, houseraddiah and lemon, they also have 3 other house sauce.  My favorite is the red onion vinegar.  For main course, We ordered duck breast and gnocchi.  Both were amazing!!!!!   The sauce on the gnocchi is to die for !!! It was rich and buttery, It was prefect with the truffles pieces on it. duck beast cooked right on medium rare with sautue rapaine.... With the small table We have, they are so thoughtful to put our wine aside and full up for us when needed.  My boyfriend love it so much that he told the server that his love them so much now. :)  I can say they deserved to be one of the best 100 resturant in Canada."}
{"text":"Why isn't there more buzz about this restaurant? I had never even heard of it before, but had a fantastic meal there last night.

My burrata and bean salad was a winner of an appetizer, full of fresh flavour from the salsa verde. I also really enjoyed my potato wrapped halibut served over quinoa with pea puree. And of course being an Italian restaurant, they do a phenomenal pasta.

Ambiance was dark and romantic, but a bit too noisy to be fully enjoyable."}
{"text":"A great surprise to get invited for my birthday dinner at Gucci's. The place looks  nice although a bit crowded setting. I could do without the large screen TV on one of the walls and opted to sit withy back to it, knowing too well that I would be distracted all the time. We ordered a few martini's to kick off the event while studying the menu and wine list. The wine list sure is interesting and complete with all the big names of the popular regions. We selected a great Italian red (Brunella La Garda 2006) to compliment our dinner of succulent rack of lamb and a tenderloin special that melted in your mouth. As appetizer we had Mushrooms on Toast and Mussels with chickpeas in a cream sauce. The mushrooms were fantastic, unfortunately the mussels were very basic and although the chickpeas added a nice touch I would not order it again. The staff was super friendly and the almost blackout, thanks to observing earth hour, added an ambience level at candlelight I've never experienced before. 

The live music was very pleasant and next time we will arrive a bit earlier to enjoy it a bit more.

Gucci, is a great place for a great dinner, good food, atmosphere with a group or as in our case just a couple celebrating a birthday, which the staff helped us celebrate in a kind and not your typical over the top way. Tiramisu with espresso to close it off, with a sparkling candle to boot. Yai, happy birthday"}
