{"text":"This is probably one of the best Korean restaurants I have ever been to. It hasn't disappointed me yet, and has been my go to restaurant for months now. I recommend a couple things. First is the spicy beef soup the flavor and size of the bowl for its price is a steal. Second is the hot stone bibimbap is full of veggies and tasty meat choices. Just come. You won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Five star experience overall. Service was personal and caring and prompt..  We ordered a special with several pieces of sushi and 2 specialty rolls. Also a beef teriyaki which was unique, moist and full of flavor, oniony and sweer without being overpowering. I kept stealing bites off my younger sons plate (he is not a sushi guy)    Sushi was 3 to 4 stars for me.  I am very old school.  Portions generous and fresh tasting. They have Hite and cold sake. The vibe is friendly and chill.  Free ice cream. We chose green tea, strawberry, and mango.   Decor is modern and comfortable. We sat at the sushi  bar. Good value, great food. Will try Korean menu next time.  Fun night definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Worst chicken ever! Where did they buy this chicken? No joke. The chicken tastes like rubber. I can't even think of a grocery store that sells chicken this bad. They definitely went for the cheapest priced chicken they could find.   Sushi is average."}
{"text":"This place is tempe's secret gem. Definitely my favorite sushi in the east valley and the service is great too. Get the tempe roll!!!!"}
{"text":"Was misled by previous reviews. Albacore nigiri still had skin on it that I couldn't bite through. Ordered sashimi and received nigiri. Not very impressed. Drink order wrong too."}
{"text":"Warning: be careful when you ask for very spicy because it's so spicy it's almost inedible...  I couldn't even fully enjoy this tofu soup without my tongue stinging every time. Oh well, I'll try again another time and now I know their spice can be pretty intense."}
{"text":"The chefs choice sushi plate is the best I've ever had. It's worth every penny. 10/10 would order again!"}
{"text":"The soup is not very Korean in my point of view. I expect it to be more sour. Maybe I didn't order the right soup."}
{"text":"We were looking for a new sushi spot to try and came across Gangnam Sushi. I'm so happy we found this little whole in the wall. The bulgogi was excellent and our sushi rolls were great! We will be back again!"}
{"text":"Service here is perfect! We ordered a spicy pork bibimbap and the Crazy Monkey roll. The bibimbap is of a huge portion, enough for two people (or at least one man, but too much for a lady maybe), but it is not good enough in my opinion. There are pickles in the roll, which is unique and I have high expectation for it. But it ends up that it is not my cup of tea actually. I will try to order other rolls next time."}
{"text":"I went on a Friday night and ordered the calamari and two sushi rolls. The calamari tasted like the frozen stuff you can buy at the grocery store and the rice on the rolls tasted like they had cleaning supply residue on them. It was as if someone had sprayed down the counter with antibacterial cleaning solution and then prepared the rolls. I also have no idea who my tip went to, because three different servers appeared at our table through out the evening. It wasn't even a shift change, they just looked like the were rotating and as a result they kept asking the same questions. You can find way better sushi and atmosphere in the valley for the same price."}
{"text":"Vibe and the staff here are on fleek! And food is absolutely amazing. Hands down my favorite sushi place in town!"}
{"text":"Pretty darn good for so close to a major university. Excellent sashimi, really good galbi. Servers seemed a little off, maybe new-ish? Only one of the Korean beers on the menu was actually available though. Very satisfactory for both Korean food and sushi."}
{"text":"The sushi is amazing! Love this place... the best sushi in town in my opinion!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The place was packed on a Tuesday night. If that doesn't prove that the food is good I don't know what else will."}
{"text":"This place was amazing! Husband and I went here just before a show at the improv last weekend. We were in South Korea/Thailand last year and loved the Korean food. We have been looking for a place that served good bibimbap.. and we found it!   We ordered a roll and split a bibimbap it was a huge portion and so delicious! We will be back again for sure!"}
{"text":"Great quality fish and everything else. Im pretty picky about my sushi and was reluctant to try this place... but i was surprised and very happy with everything here. Great sized portions  and quality and service to match!  If I'm ever back in the area i will make my way back."}
{"text":"Great service, portions, and quality fish. Very fresh and the sushi chef knows what he is doing. Will be going back with friends very soon."}
{"text":"Long overdue!!! My first time there was when I took my co-workers before Spring break started... Our first time there, and the food is so delicious!  The workers/manager were so accommodating and very nice and helpful!  Second time I went, I had a co-worker try it too... The portions are larger than the price.  I usually get the Unagi bowl (most of the japanese place I go to), Let me tell you-- The portion is really good for the price and they have more pieces of eel as compared to other restaurants.. Again, food is fresh!!!!"}
{"text":"loveeed it. The husband and I both enjoyed our respective bibimbaps. We went completely gaga over the icecream - get the mango and green tea."}
{"text":"Second time coming here and the food was as great as I remember! We got the shrimp and pork bibimbap and ate every last bit. The service is awesome and our waiter Charles was very friendly! Would definitely recommend and will be coming back."}
{"text":"Overall good food and friendly service. We arrived a few minutes before the kitchen was going to close, and they were kind enough to wait for us to order before shutting it down. The tofu soup and bulgogi is flavorful and their sushi is also good. Definitely a place a will be returning for a good Korean/Japanese meal. I usually save 5 stars for places that are out of this world, but 4 stars is still a place I would recommend trying!"}
{"text":"Sushi rolls were just ok. The  fish was fresh and very tasty. The service was horrible . Sat at the bar chef didn't even acknowledge us . The waitress was slow and unresponsive to problems we were having ."}
{"text":"A little pricey but everything was delish! Loved the Udon noodles! Waitress needs customer service training. At least fake a smile!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like Gangnam Sushi & Grill...And it pains me to give a poor review.  However, the food was horrible.    I ordered steamed pork belly (bossam) and cabbage ($20) and my boyfriend had kimchi soondubu with bulgogi combo ($18).  Everything was extremely salty (and I love salty foods)-- so salty to the point that it was almost inedible.  The service was sub-par, granted it was busy, but it took over 20 minutes to get refills on our drinks and another 15-20 minutes to flag down a server for our checks.    I usually give places a second chance before writing a poor review, but I won't be eating here again.  Bottom line: overpriced, poor service, and poor food. Not worth the hype!!"}
{"text":"Happy tummy and their lunch prices are awesome. I recommend the tofu soup and their side dishes."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite sushi place in AZ. The same sushi chef has been here since the first time I ordered and the sushi comes out very consistent and delicious. I've eaten their traditional, specialty, handrolls, and even sashimi salad and they were delicious. They also have other Korean dishes which I've had a few of and they were really good too. It is just too hot in AZ to order the Korean soups but their meat dishes are great too. If I could eat here everyday I probably would....  Only down side is that the person answering the phones and taking the order changes often (it is located by a university so it is expected) so sometimes they take in the orders wrong or forget the extra instructions.  Or they get rude and hang up (happened 1 time only months ago).    Overall, really great hole-in -the-wall type of restaurant ran by... Koreans... that can actually cook Korean food... which I am very picky about as well."}
{"text":"Gangnam Sushi & Grill- not only aesthetically pleasing, but beating the game in quality, taste, serving size of sushi, and most importantly, customer service.   I began my first course with two orders of the two-piece Salmon Nigiri, the Crazy Monkey roll, Saba Shioyaki (Mackerel), and Kimchi Chigae (Soup).   It seemed as just as I sat and ordered food, the food came out. Charles was especially helpful in making a recommendation and making sure I was enjoying my experience and food.   When the Salmon Nigiri came out, I was surprised to see the biggest serving size of sliced Salmon I've had. I typically can fit a Nigiri of any sort in one bite, but this Salmon Nigiri had me taking two bites. The picture I posted doesn't do it justice, but I promise you won't be disappointed. Taste-wise the Salmon was melt in your mouth delicious.   Next, the Crazy Monkey roll arrived. It was my spicy heaven. I'm a lover of all foods spicy and it really hit the spot for my Tuna craving. Beautifully presented with Spicy Mayo sauce and with added cucumber for that crunch.   Being Korean, my favorite food is Kimchi Chigae, and for who don't know, it's a spicy fermented cabbage soup, traditionally made with pork and tofu inside. I've had kimchi all different sizes and ways, but if it's not made by Mom or Grandma it's no good, but Gangnam makes it like your Mother or Grandmother made it.  First let's talk protein! Almost all restaurants I've been to in the past barely put a few chunks of meat, let alone Kimchi and Tofu, but Gangnam made my Kimchi Chigae not only over the top in taste but serving size! It was seemly endless and I was super happy about it all. I stuffed my face full and could keep eating passed the food coma (that's when you know it's good).  Coming for the Northwest, specifically from Seattle/ Portland area I've been to many sushi spots, from conveyer belt sushi, all-you-can-eat sushi to the upperclass sushi spots where clients from Japan would go to, and when I moved to Phoenix four years ago, I was highly disappointed by the sushi scene here. There had been many times I felt sort of ripped off for the amount of sushi given for the price, but at Gangnam Sushi & Grill not only do I have a five-star scenery to eat in but the prices are fair, paired with their attention to detail and look/quality of the food.   Now that I've discovered Gangnam Sushi & Grill I can say I will be coming here over and over again. ^.^ #foodie #GangnamSushi #NoRegrets #Japanese #Korean #Journalist #Vlogger"}
{"text":"Service was amazing loved our girl! The sushi it self tasted very old . I was very disappointed"}
{"text":"This place is just absolutely amazing! The sushi was absolutely exceptional and the service was without a doubt incredible. The owner, Charles, is a wonderful, charismatic man who's super friendly and kind to all of his customers. I'm definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"I did pick up once before and wasn't impressed... And this time I dinned in (sitting at the sushi bar)and still wasn't pleased or impressed by the sushi but what was worse this time after ordering I noticed/was a lil alarmed that the sushi chef was cutting raw meat, which looked like beef... Right in front on me Yuck but what had me worried is he never changed his gloves when making my sushi ,,. All he did is rinse the gloves under water and when done making my sushi went back to cutting the meat ... Honestly I'm A fool for staying but I didn't want to just hop up... I'm. Just hoping I don't get sick ... I've had food poisoning before and it was no joke !!!!"}
{"text":"This place is outstanding! I've gone multiple times with friends and the food is always top notch and the staff is wonderful!"}
{"text":"For a college sushi spot it as expected. Over all service was good and food was good but nothing standout."}
{"text":"Korean food was so so with a lot of short cuts taken on ingredients. Portions were very small. That being said, the sushi was very good. My advice got there for the sushi and avoid the Korean food."}
{"text":"What a great place. Very nice clean place with awesome service and even better food. The sushi is some of the best I have had in a while. With a great convenient place for even more ethnic foods!!!"}
{"text":"I've been coming this place for three years. And unfortunately today will be the last time eating here. The server is a joke. I requested without some ingredients that I can't eat. However it is still, in my bowl. Another ridiculous thing. Two tempura shrimps in the set should come together when they served me the entree. The waitress severed it to me when we asking for the check. Meanwhile, she said:\"it's not my fault, it's the chef forget about it.\" Oh, okay. Here you go, one star for you. I mean, seriously? Are you trying to play with me? I didn't get mad for this, I just don't like the whole experience."}
{"text":"I ate there with a friend today. We arrived at about 12:10 pm on a Sat. We had the Kobe Roll, California Roll with Real Crab, Soft Shell Crab Roll (Super Spider Roll?), and the Kalbi. Everything was excellent, and the service was prompt and courteous. Not inexpensive, but much better sushi than I have had for the same prices at other places. I would go here over RA, or Kabuki anytime."}
{"text":"I am not a fan. And it always extremely hot inside, which is rare for a sushi restaurant.  Service was good but disappointed overall."}
{"text":"Must try this place!! Atmosphere is very chill & food is even better. The portions are huge and the sashimi is the best I've ever had. If you're ever Tempe, come to Gangnam, you won't regret it! Thank you Charles for a wonderful time :) Definitely coming back again!"}
{"text":"This place was cool at first until I received my Tsunami roll with cilantro overpowering any of the other flavors. I asked if they could re-do one with no cilantro or put less in it. They politely said I had to buy a new roll and they would not remake another one...Very disappointing!! Will never come back!!"}
{"text":"Went to this place for the first time and it was great. The server was really nice and she even laughed at my joke when I couldn't say bibimbap. Great for a lunch date plus really good food. It was great atmosphere and it was really clean too!"}
{"text":"That salmon skin salad is terrific. First sake could have been hotter but we corrected that out for the second one.  Nice vibe. Nice people. GPS totally hosed up finding it. It's on University."}
{"text":"My friends and I decided to come here the other night for dinner. It was all of our first times and the prices caught our eyes, along with it's close location. The place has a very nice set up inside as well as a nice staff. The happy hour prices are very good and I'm definitely going to come back more often. As for the taste of everything, very very good as well. The fish is not super fresh, but it is still delicious, safe, and more than decently priced."}
{"text":"This place is good. I don't know how else to put it. The portions are large and the pricing is very reasonable. The atmosphere is super chill. I will come back."}
{"text":"This place is excellent! We love the gyoza, sushi, kimchi pancake and bibimbap.  The kimchi pancake is rather large, but delicious, and perfect for sharing with the table.  The prices are reasonable and we have made this part of our weekly routine. They are typically not very busy around 8 pm during the week so you can walk right in and get a table quickly."}
{"text":"Bulgogi was amazing. It's a korean marinated steak with rice. I have to say it's one of the best dishes I have ever tried. I'm obsessed with it now:)"}
{"text":"The hype is getting to be a bit too much. My girlfriend and I came here last Tuesday around 4pm and were kept waiting for an hour for our food. When the food came we were only brought a marginal tasting rice bowl rather than the rice bowl and sushi we ordered. Our waitress was new, and everyone kept coming up to us asking if we needed anything and apologizing. It got pretty annoying. Hopefully you get them on a better day than I did.  Opening a restaurant is hard business. You don't know when demand will spike, which makes it tricky to have the appropriate staff and food on hand.   When you make mistakes due to growth in demand you have to apologize and make amends with your customers: good food, comped meal... Nothing was offered.  It might be worth it it might now, roll the dice yelpers and hopefully you will have a better experience and food than me.  Sincerely,  hairy b."}
{"text":"Not good. Ordered the nigiri hamachi and the pieces were huge. Usually I would be excited but the pieces were room temp and the cuts still had the \"blood line\" in them. Gross!!! I had two other rolls that were just mush...no flavor or texture.  I am hope I don't get sick tonight. The quality of their fish is really poor."}
{"text":"The talk around town about their Bibimbap is not wrong. A perfect blend of ingredients which makes all your worries go away for a little while, especially after a long day. If you don't mind forgoing the hot stone, it's $2 less for a normal bibimbap. My best friend gets the hot stone and the sizzling sound makes others crave it. We've found that the perfect appetizer to complement it is the Agedashi Tofu aka deep fried tofu which is lightly dusted with starch and soaked in soy sauce.   I often go during their happy hours where miso soup is $2 and the rolls are cheap. The mochi was okay but I wouldn't order again. The interior is cozy and pretty. The servers are attentive and are almost always on point with their suggestions. It's a five minute walk from campus which is a great plus! It's nice to have it right there instead of having to drive to hodori for Korean food."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying how disappointed I am that I could only rate this place 5 stars because they deserve 10!! Walked in and was greeted by happy staff and right away informed about their happy hour. Gyozas were so on point and their sushi rolls tasted bomb AF. But wait there is more! I was recommended the bulgogi bibimbap and it was AMAZING!! No joke every bite made stuffing my face totally worth it! I had zero complaints and honestly can't wait to go back. Seriously try EVERYTHING!!"}
{"text":"Very happy this place opened. Finding good Korean food around phoenix is difficult and this one is closer than the ones we go to in mesa. We ordered both Japanese and Korean food. The sushi was fresh and delicious. Gyozas tasty (not a fan of the dipping sauce). The edamame not worth it.   The Korean panchan, although they don't give you as much as typical Korean BBQ places, was delicious. Excellent kimchee. The japchae and kimchee stir-fry were both fantastic. We also ordered the kimchee pancakes - good but wouldn't order it again. The service was extremely friendly and good, which you don't always find in asian restaurants. We'll definitely come back."}
{"text":"Reviews on this place are way off. Coming from California and having a good number of good Sushi around this place does not cut it. Limited number of sushi rolls. No albacore roll? Service is bad! Very bad!!! They also charge a buck to sprinkle some crunchy stuff on a Cali roll and call it a crunch roll. I'll try another spot next time"}
{"text":"SO YUMMY! I went for dinner with friends, and the place was quite full. We waited for only a few minutes until we were seated. The restaurant had a very nice ambiance. It was my first time eating Korean food - that was what we mostly ordered. We came to the restaurant a few minutes before happy hour was ending (5 mins to be exact), and ended up ordering after it was over. BUT the waiter said that even we ordered after 7, we would still be receiving the happy hour deals because we came before then!  Anyway, we ordered a lot of food, and everything was delicious. The most memorable dish had to be the octopus dish on the happy hour menu - OMG so unexpectedly good. Also, the spicy vegetable stew (on the menu it was around $30), was perfect. All the staff kept checking up on us, asking us how everything was going, I loved that. There was this one older gentleman, I believe he was either the main cook or manager- but he was so kind. And we being the Korean drama obsessed freaks, told him how much we appreciated Korean culture and food, and we spoke a little Korean to him lol. He even gave us a drama recommendation. As a first timer, I would definitely recommend this place! It was a perfect girls night out. :)"}
{"text":"The portion was small, the price as unbelievable high and the food was not fresh. It seemed like the dishes were sitting there to wait for an order to be placed, then they popped it into the microwave. We ordered the BBQ chicken and bulgogi beef and they were cold and horrible. If you want real Korean food for great quality and better price, Korea Town restaurant in Mesa is the best."}
{"text":"Pretty good chirashi bowl here.  While served in a more fusion slanted bowl, the contents were a plenty.  A good selection of sashimi pieces and some seaweed salad.  The sashimi tasted fresh and overall good.  I particularly liked the variety of seafood items selected for the bowl and I closed it out for myself with the tomago."}
{"text":"Update - Well that was fast.  Within minutes of posting my review, I was contacted by the owner who expressed his concern and empathy for my experience.  In short, the owner has offered to \"make it right\".  I won't disclose the details here; that is for the owner, Charles.  But suffice it to say, I am willing to give Gangnam another chance.  Seriously guys, the food is Really good.  If the service levels can be on par with the food quality, Gangnam has the capability to be a stellar source of satisfying your sushi cravings in the Tempe area.  Hoping for the best, and updating my review to 4 stars (primarily for the effort and courtesy extended to me).  Thank you, Charles.   Gangnam earns a low rating based on my experience.  And they lose a customer based on their ridiculous \"to go\" order surcharge.  Which is very unfortunate because the food was really quite good.  Never in my life have I seen a \"surcharge\" for simply putting something in a plastic box and wrapping a plastic bag around it.   So let me get this straight.   You didn't have to greet me.  You didn't have to seat me.  You didn't have to bring me something to drink while you waited for me to order.  You didn't have to serve me.  You didn't have to check on me multiple times.  You didn't even have to clean up after me.  And you're going to surcharge me for avoiding all of these things and taking my food home?  Are you freaking kidding me?   Like Ben C mentioned, sure, it wasn't a high price.  It's the principal, however, that translates to a slap in the face.   Piss poor business ethics, Gangnam."}
{"text":"Tasty! Small quaint little restaurant. Great service and tasty food. Love the mix of Korean and Japanese"}
{"text":"Cozy little place. 1st time here and first time trying this kind of food. Ordered the edamame (2 dollars during happy hour). Also ordered Bulgogi Bimipop. So Good! The beef has a sweeter flavor to it and the sauce you can add has a nice kick to it that pairs nicely with the dish. The little side dish they give you beforehand is interesting. I enjoyed the Kimchi and bean sprouts. Not the fish cakes so much. Service was great and food was excellent we will be back to try the happy hour sushi!"}
{"text":"Slow service. Loud music. Overly greasy noodles. Bland sushi. Probably won't ever go back."}
{"text":"Perfect little sushi spot in Tempe. It's hard to find a good sushi place that has great service and good deals.   I have been several times and it never ceases to amaze.  I love the bento box lunch deals.  Perfect quantity of food for the right price.   Will certainly keep coming back."}
{"text":"Authentic flavors of food and a great vibe. Awesome customer service!! The bento boxes are a great choice for lots of variety of food. Nice area if you're in the mood for college town as well :) I hope to be back soon"}
{"text":"Freshest/best sushi we have had in Tempe in a while. Generous servings, stupendous customer service and very nice environment. Highly, highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"Gangnam has really good Korean food (I recommend the soft tofu soup combo). There are better places to go in Tempe for sushi, but it's not bad, especially if you work at ASU and want a break from MU prepackaged sushi.   The kitchen is a bit slow, but the Korean food is so good, it's a draw.   The biggest negative is the service. I've been here multiple times and while the all-male waitstaff shift is great, the all-female shift is a toss-up. Good luck getting the drink you ordered, or any attention after you've gotten your food. Most of the time the servers were standing around talking or looking at their phones, in full view of the dining room, instead of checking on their tables. We had to walk over to them to ask for our drinks (ten minutes after our appetizer had already arrived), to order dessert, and for our check. Once Gangnam brings all of their staff up to par they will get another star."}
{"text":"This place is a great little gem in Tempe. Decent and close to authentic Korean tofu soup as you can get in Arizona I imagine. Staff was super friendly and attentive.   Was a great value as this was the cheapest meal we've had while visiting Phoenix/Scottsdale area here with our kids. Definitely a place to try if your are looking for a local place with a different flavor than the usual."}
{"text":"Pot stickers were outstanding but the sushi didn't stand out. Maybe I should have tried a different roll?"}
{"text":"Their food isnt the best, but they give good portions and are very friendly. We met the owner and he is very nice and easy to talk to. It was nice having this store open late so we could come here after watching the ASU football game. A lot of other food places were closed by then!"}
{"text":"Best Korean pancakes ever!!! Soju is delicious. The vibe is so Korean. I'm happy to be there anytime. Kimchi is amazing. The spicy rice cakes are scrumptious as ever. I want to continue going back. That place can turn your most saddened day into the brightest. I bring my girlfriends and we just eat all we can until our checks rack up in the $60-$70 range. Yummmmmmm!!! It's great as leftovers too!!"}
{"text":"We went for the first time recently and will definitely return. It was awesome!  The waiter was so nice and the environment was comfortable.  We went with the Tempe Roll and the Kiss of Fire(?) don't quote me on that. But it was amazing. The pork gyoza was great too. We can't wait to try more rolls."}
{"text":"I've been food sick all morning. Food wasn't even that good. And the gyros the little dumpling things were horrible not worth it."}
{"text":"Service good and food was amazing! Location was a bit hard to reach. The owners were vocal about their server's small mistakes. I would give this place 4 stars but the restaurant managers were rude to their employees."}
{"text":"Not often do i get a chance to have real korean food in az. The galbi bibimbap was huge and amazing. I wasnt able to finish it all! My brother got the sushi and the spicy tuna had a pretty decent kick to it. Will definately be coming back here again to try all the other korean dishes"}
{"text":"Wow! What a nice little sushi bar in the city of Phoenix, although I'd recommend coming to lunch rather than dinner because you save a good amount of money off of the dishes (the menu tells you) but the food was delicious and staff very friendly and checked on us plenty. Made sure our glasses were full and that we were happy with our meals !"}
{"text":"Good food, slow service. Luckily, we weren't in a rush. The bibimbap is definitely big enough for two people. Location is a tad odd - tucked into the corner of a little strip mall. But, good Korean food."}
{"text":"The appetizers are AMAZING. The sushi and sashimi are such a good deal. I would recommend this restaurant for sure. Good hangout place."}
{"text":"Great food, exceptional service, and the menu is very well put together for Japanese and Korean dishes. Ordered salmon & scallop roll, Tempe roll, veggie & chicken Korean bowl, cucumber salad, and edamame. My wife and I absolutely loved all of the dishes served from our order! Money spent, I feel the pricing was just right  You do get what you pay for, and I feel I got a lot more quality & quantity for what I spent. My wife and I will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"I was looking around for some decent Korean food.  Yelp mentioned this place right down the road from my hotel.  I decided to give it a try.  Like anyone on Yelp, I read the feedback before committing to a restaurant. Reviews seemed very mixed.  I decided to try it out anyways.  I was really disappointed with the quality of their food and the poor level of service I received.  They will not refill your drink unless you specifically ask them or if they decide to ask you.  I was about to try some of their rolls but not even halfway into my meal, I was presented with the bill.  I actually left the establishment still hungry.  My recommendation...stay away from here or you'll end up spending $20 and leaving hungry."}
{"text":"Finally a good Korean restaurant in the area! They immediately won my heart when I found out they make my favorite dish: the kimchi pancake! It comes with a deliciously tangy dipping sauce that really takes it to the next level. No joke, I dream about this pancake. If kimchi isn't your thing, they have a seafood pancake as well. The bibimbap was also incredibly delicious, and service was quick and friendly. New favorite to add to the rotation!"}
{"text":"Ate here with the family on a Monday night and had a great experience!  The sushi rolls were indeed HUGE and delicious.  We had the spicy tuna and the spider rolls - both were about $11 and had legit pieces of tuna and soft shell crab in them.  Most sushi places will skimp and will fill their rolls with rice and veggies to hide the sliver of fish in them but not here!  Loved the rolls.  We also had the budaechigae (kimchi stew).  This was also huge.  We shared it with our whole table and still had about half of it left to take home.  Absolutely packed with sausage and bacon...which any korean will tell you is the key.  Highly recommend you get this if you're going with a party of 4-5.  A great appetizer or complement to the sushi.    The kalbi (korean short ribs) were my favorite part of the meal.  Melt-in-your-mouth tender, marinated perfectly, cooked perfectly...as good as any kalbi I've had in LA.    All in all, the food is delicious, portions are great, and atmosphere is comfortable.  And the owner was really cool - I saw him welcome every guest personally and was constantly walking around making sure everyone was happy.  A must-eat if you're in the mood for sushi, korean, or both around campus."}
{"text":"One of my new favorite sushi places. There hasn't really been anything good sushi in tempe till this place opened. The service was outstanding!!!! The portions of sushi were so fresh and massive. I think I found my new spot. I couldn't believe the servings of fish they gave out. I had this eel bowl which blew my mind. I would recommend this place to anyone I meet."}
{"text":"Really do enjoy this place ! Went for the first time yesterday and wow. Very hard to find good sushi in AZ, let Tempe alone . I had the bibimbap (spelling) and it was delicious. Their spicy sauce is the right amount of kick (on the lighter side). The only other sushi place I fuck with is Kobe Sushi in Tempe. It's a pretty good match to it. I'll be coming here more often"}
{"text":"Went here with a co-worker for lunch. Get there early and you'll have plenty of seating choices. We got there at 1130 - just before the lunch rush. It was my first time trying the bibimbap and it was delicious! I can't wait to try the other items on the menu.  I would scope out what other diners were getting and it looks like lots of good choices. Will definitely try again."}
{"text":"Delicious fresh food, good service, average prices. Casual dining but you don't have to worry about the quality of the sushi. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Just came in for a quick to go and ended up finding my new chill spot. The staff was super friendly, even though I came in close to closing which I know can be annoying . I will definitely be back, with friends!"}
{"text":"Rolled the dice and ordered their sushi combo A. Proceeded to receive one of the hottest rolls on the menu. Not cool Gangam, not cool at all. Cuts of fish are also big. Really big. Big does not equal quality, but if that's your thing, then do it up."}
{"text":"Probably the best sushi I've had in the Phoenix area. For the price it's hard to beat, you're going to get some quality sushi and large portions. The service was fast and friendly. I ordered the flaming jack specialty roll, one of those rolls wrapped in tin foil that they light on fire. Just a heads up, It was definitely on the smokey and spicy side which I really liked. The nigiri was some of the best I've ever had and also very large. Looking forward to visiting this restaurant again sometime soon."}
{"text":"Not bad but as some others have mentioned already this restaurant is a bit overhyped. I do have to say that the interior is really nice and the music selection was great. As for the food it was a mixed bag. I had the Chicken Teriyaki for lunch which comes with salad and miso soup. When the food arrived the waitress asked if I wanted rice which normally would have been included in any other Japanese restaurant? That seemed a bit weird to me to be asked that.  As for the food I thought that the Chicken Teriyaki was decent however the salad was a huge disappointment. They seem to prepare the salad in advance and then leave it in the fridge which makes the salad extremely cold and there even looked to be some frost on there. Also the salad bowl itself was very cold as well, never seen anything like it before. The miso soup was okay I guess, though it was definitely too salty.  I was really hoping that this restaurant would be better as I do enjoy Japanese food and the location is close to where I live. I'll probably give them another chance but so far my first impressions have been somewhat underwhelming."}
{"text":"This was the first time we visited Gangnam and we will definitely be back!  The happy hour menu was great and the service was amazing.  We tried the Sake Bomb roll and were a little disappointed because the salmon was \"mushy.\"  However the roll was good overall.  Saw tons of other things on the menu and being delivered to other tables that looked/smelled delicious.  Nice hidden discovery."}
{"text":"As residents of Tempe trying to find a nice sitdown restaurant last Saturday without going all the way to Scottsdale man were we amazed to find this place!!  The atmosphere is modern and clean, the service-exceptional, and cuisine-a delightful array of esthetically pleasing Japanese an authentic Korean that lights up your taste buds!   We decided to go with the bibimbap to start with-a fresh hot Korean dish with great flavor and spicy traditional sauce.  The portion was surprisingly huge so we had to set it off to the side to save room for sushi to come. We were also wowed by the size of the sushi once we saw the beautiful volcano roll, which was \"probably the best sushi I've ever had\" said my boyfriend after trying it, to which I also agreed. We both have live in Hawaii for years, and find ourselves frequently disappointed by \"mainland\" sushi restaurants not living up to the famous fresh catch sushi of iron chefs like Morimoto etc. that we had at our fingertips living in the middle of the pacific!   After dinner we got to try the mochi-very good, light dessert option; we got mango and chocolate. Anyways, all in all-it was great and we have now found our new sushi spot!! I must mention again, the wonderful service by all of the staff, even the sushi chef came over and asked how we liked the sushi...and our server held the door on our way out! It was such a comfortable, welcoming atmosphere-like the Asian Cheers! It is so great to see such a good business being introduced into Tempe.  If they keep this up I'm sure they'll be the go-to for many other Tempe dwellers as well! ...their only problem I can foresee might be finding a bigger spot with more tables for patrons once word gets out!"}
{"text":"I hate giving a low rating for a place with such excellent service. Everyone that works here seems to love their job so much and it shows. Unfortunately, the food isn't great. I first had the bibimbap a few months ago which I thought was decent; unfortunately I've had better. It was a little bland. I had the calamari as well which was undercooked and was awful. I came back recently and had the hamachi kama with ponzu which was okay."}
{"text":"Bulgogi bibimbap.  Served in a huge clay bowl. Crispy rice at the bottom. Close to perfection.  Unagi nigri They gave us large pieces of fish. I loved it.  Went for lunch. Clean place. Kind service. Would come baxk"}
{"text":"Small, clean interior, nice environment for casual dining. Got fairly busy by dinner time, and quickly filled up a little while after we all got there at 5:30 on a Thursday evening. Collectively my group and I ordered the gal I, bibimbap, soondubu and the Vegas roll and the super Spider-Man roll. Super Spider-Man was by far the favorite, and the galbi was on point. Bibimbap could use salt and the soondubu a bit more flavor, but that's just me based on authentic Korean food. Great attentive service and great selection of food. You'll definitely find something yummy and have a great time. Will return, with more people too!"}
{"text":"Good place for quick delicious sushi dinner. Their nigiri was absolutely delicious.  The large moist pieces of fish were very pretty and inviting and that definitely woke up the taste buds. Small but also very tasty piece of rice was just enough to complement the fish. Tempura department can still use some help. The batter was flat and chewy. In my order the onion ring inside was actually more crunchier than that of the batter. It was supposed to be the other way around. Good atmosphere. Definitely would come back for the nigiri and try the rolls next time."}
{"text":"Sarah was extremely helpful but had no knowledge of geography and a complete pain in the ass to coworkers. Francisco is an amazing sushi chef from Kodakan Japan      I ordered the yellow tail nigiri salmon skin hand tools and eel cucumber roll. Everything was fresh and amazing well prepared.  I will frequent Gangnam as my sushi pallet moves me."}
{"text":"Had a Dragon Roll, spicy tuna and salmon sushi. It was all very fresh and tasty. Good atmosphere and friendly staff. Definitely a place to try and come back again."}
{"text":"Gangnam is a Japanese / Korean restaurant in the heart of Tempe. Well, at least it's close to the word \"Tempe\" on Google Maps.  I visited on a weekday night to check out the few vegetarian options on the menu. I'm happy to say I wasn't the only one eating alone. I don't know why that makes me happy... maybe next time I'll ask the stranger to join me for dinner.  The vegetarian bibimbap was disappointing. I was very excited to eat something Korean, and regretted it. The egg was overdone and vegetables were pedestrian. The only thing bibimbap about the dish was the bowl. I hate sounding so negative, but I want folks to avoid ordering the bibimbap.  The vegetarian gyoza wasn't much better. I couldn't tell you what the filling was. It was so fried it could have been anything.  But I ate it anyway.  The water tasted like the sugar from the soda machine. I felt compelled to grab my water bottle from my bag and drink from it instead.  There is a bit of good news here: The service was nice. As in, the people seemed genuinely kind. Two folks came by to take my order. Someone accidentally brought me vegetable tempura, which I sent back.   I probably won't be back anytime soon. Maybe I have to play to Phoenix's strengths instead of trying to satisfy my own cravings. RIP the dream of excellent bibimbap in the desert."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this restaurant. The wait staff are very nice and the food is the best I've had. I generally get the bimibap and it's amazing. The sushi is good and the restaurant is interesting. I can't say enough about how good this restaurant is."}
{"text":"My initial test for real sushi is if they have fresh wasabi or not, and they did!!  Great service and fresh tastes.  Great for a quick bite.  Will return soon!!!"}
{"text":"Good, fresh fish. Had Salmon and Yellow Tail nigiri and a couple of rolls. All were delicious. The only thing that could have been better is the rice. It was slightly overcooked and mushy. Service was top notch though."}
{"text":"This is my favorite sushi place in Tempe!!! My go-to for sushi. Doesn't look like much on the outside but it's cute and cozy on the inside. The servers and sushi chef are great!!! I love ordering the tuna tower it's my favorite! Also the sake bomber roll. You can really taste the quality of the fish here. I've never once gotten my order and thought it tasted fishy. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Gangnam Sushi & Grill is a great option when trying to get your sushi and Korean food fixed. I tried their chicken Bibimbap for the first time and I was not disappointed.  The portion size was enough for two people to share. The noodles were soft and flavorful, the vegetables were fresh and with a crunch, and the egg was perfectly cooked to give you that runny egg yolk flavor throughout the dish. The plate was brought in a giant hot stone plate. This gave the rice underneath the perfect temperature for the rice to get crispy. While we were waiting for our main meal, our waitress brought us the California roll that I order (which was delicious) and Korean side dishes. I was really impressed by their kimchi, flavorful with a nice spicy kick.   Overall, the pricing of the food is fair for the amount of food you are getting and the quality of it. It is definitely at an affordable price, I think this also has to do with their location. Gangnam Sushi & Grill is located near ASU Tempe. They are located in a small plaza near 8th Street and University. They are surrounded by other restaurants, including an Indian cuisine restaurant, a Vietnamese restaurant, and an Ethiopian - Mediterranean eatery.  Gangnam has an edge by having late hours during the week and the weekend. This made it convenient for my friends and me to grab a bite of food after a closing shift at work. Although we were there until closing time ( 11:45ish pm)  we did not feel rush to leave. Our waitress was very attentive and continued to make sure we were taken care of even after she boxed our food.  The ambiance of Gangnam Sushi & Grill made me feel like I was at a luxury Sushi place. It's a small, cozy location but the atmosphere made it feel like eating at a family member's house. There was noise from the other customers and the nearby kitchen but it still gave you an intimate diner experience with your party. Overall, I am very satisfied with the food, service, and atmosphere of Gangnam Sushi & Grill. I will definitely come back and let more people know of this place."}
{"text":"My friend and I went here for the first time. A bit skeptical at first but immediately loved it! The food was delicious but I didn't like how small the tables were. Even if I wanted to order more, there wasn't any room after ordering two things off the menu."}
{"text":"Awesome food. Finally a sushi bar that is not just 'average' in downtown Tempe. The sushi is great, not to mention the rolls are huge. They also offer bulgogi/other Korean & Japanese food. I'll definitely be back to check out the rest of the menu. The staff/owners were so nice. If you're on the fence about where to go for sushi in Tempe, put this place at the top your list. I'd love to see this place stick around."}
{"text":"Very tiny, intimate place with a great happy hour menu. $1 miso soup!! Wow. $6 vegas roll. The service was excellent, our waiter was attentive and polite. We went with his suggestion and had the dragon roll, my new favorite roll. Only complaint is the air conditioning wasn't working, there was a big fan in the restaurant that didn't seem to help much. We were sweating pretty bad and had to get out of there, so I had to knock a star off. We will still be returning."}
{"text":"This is a great little sushi spot, I was a little worried by its location but, the food and service were fantastic and did not disappoint. The Korean selection was just as good as the Japanese, I always expect one to be better than the other when offered both-- but I had a specialty roll and bibimbap bowl and it was all equally delicious!"}
{"text":"Great service and great food! Laura rocks, she helped us navigate our way through the menu, gave us some history on a few of the items used for cooking at the tables. It was nice to have someone guide us through what we were eating instead of dipping into the usually unknown paste. Bring your appetite the portions are big!"}
{"text":"Great food. However service was pretty upsetting. I had to wait for my party of 5 because the waiter in that area was busy and needed to catch up. I get that happens but the fact 4 other parties (3-4 ppl) were seated before us...not cool."}
{"text":"Really great food! I had the Oregon roll and it was delicious. Very clean and nice little restaurant. And the server was very friendly! Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Great food, friendly service and close to home. We really enjoyed their happy hour menu, and love that they serve Japanese and Korean under one roof. Sushi was fresh, no fishy smell. Kimchi was good. Sticky rice was on point. Very close to ASU and Gus's pizza. It's a little hidden, behind Gus's in an older shopping plaza. Clean and modest interior--this place is casual, but nice. We'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Went for the Korean food. Great service and clean atmosphere. Hot Pot full of yummy things hit the spot. Really enjoyed our visit"}
{"text":"This place has a GREAT happy hour menu! I got seaweed salad for $2.00 and miso soup for only $1.00! Perfect way to start my meals! The ambience of this place was neat kind and is a hidden treasure! This inside of it and employees set a welcoming tone, so thank you! The sushi overall here was good but not great so that is why I only gave it a 4 Star! It could've been what I choose to eat but  one day I will be back to two others on the menu! Thanks again!"}
{"text":"This place should have already put all other sushi places near ASU out of service! Good things: + Food. + Service. + Location. + Cleanliness. Not-so-good things: + The music. + The TV. + Nothing is really spicy. :("}
{"text":"Went there once,food was great! BUT, the waiter was hitting on me and my friend non stop even tho her bf was right there and he knows thats her bf. Then asked my friend's number the other day outside of the restaurant. CREEPY! And please STOP!"}
{"text":"Excellent service and food.  Short on time, I had to call in my order during my lunch break and when I got to the counter my order was ready.  I ordered sashimi and a roll. It was filling and just enough, however, I was craving something spicy. I usually don't order off the menu but I made a special request and he knocked it out of the park.  You can't ask for better service and quality.   I left full and happy!"}
{"text":"Had the He Dup Bap ... three times in as many days because once wasn't enough!! Great hole in the wall sushi place with Korean & tofu house influences. Will be back next time I'm in Tempe!"}
{"text":"Amazing sushi!! Very friendly waitresses and fast service.  The food is very consistent."}
{"text":"Amazing food! They are very friendly and prompt. Their sushi rolls are huge and delicious. Definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"I tried the signature dish Ahi tuna condo. It was pretty and yummy. However, be careful since it is very spicy (but it is ok for me tho). There are at least three kinds of sauces on the dish and they all cover the taste of Ahi tuna. So if you wanna taste the fresh fish, this dish might not work for you. The waitress's service is great."}
{"text":"Nice service, mediocre sushi, mediocre sake. Honestly, we live in SoCal and have some truly amazing sushi places in Orange County, this was not like those. As a side note, the bus-girl dumped an entire bowl of blazing hot soup on the guys next to us. Ouch! However, our server was SUPER nice & made the birthday dinner for the hubs nice."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. The staff is amazing and they are so nice, and they are just so sweet and respectful! And the food! Ohmygod where do I start?! It's so good!"}
{"text":"Alright fellow Yelpers and friends.... This place is brand new and amazing. We found it randomly when searching for sushi on yelp and I am super glad we did.   The location isn't great but honestly, once you try the food, you won't care. It's very authentic and the owner/other staff and family members were awesome. They offer both a Japanese/sushi menu and a Korean menu. We ordered from both. My boyfriend had the bimbimbop (probably spelled this wrong- opps) which is a Korean dish (I'm learning) and I had the Vegas roll and the Tempe roll. Holy moly, delicious. The bimbimbop is served in a hot skillet and is a combination of veggies, Meat and rice. It was perfect! I wish I had taken pictures of all the dishes because they were presented beautifully and tasted even better.   The others in our group had other speciality rolls and everyone raved about how good they were. I think this is my new favorite sushi spot which is saying a lot because I am a loyal customer and already had my go to sushi spot in Scottsdale.  It was that good.   Check this place out, you absolutely won't regret it. Aside from a happy belly, you will receive wonderful service. The owner even waited on us himself!  Oh yeah, try the ice cream!!!! Can't wait to go back to this place!!!"}
{"text":"The food here was pretty good. Definitely not bad at all. The staff definitely took care of us, they were all friendly. Will return to try some bulgogi next time for sure!"}
{"text":"Beautiful surprise with lovely staff and fantastic food. The bibimbap is on point as well as the Yaki soba. Will mandatorily come back. Cant wait to be hungry again."}
{"text":"The service here is unbeatable. Their tempura shrimp is to die for. They have an unbeatable happy hour.  The thing that I have noticed through my time there is that the staff doesn't just work, they care. The service makes such a difference in the dining experience.  You really can't go wrong here with the food, service, and prices."}
{"text":"The sushi here is great.  I didn't try any of the Korean selections though, as I was in full sushi mode and this was open pretty late compared to other restaurants around it.   Excellent find via Yelp and I'd suggest trying any of the special roles, though they do have a bit of a kick to them."}
{"text":"Love this place. The boyfriend and I split a sushi roll and a vegetable hot pot (a must). Plenty of food for the both of us. Food is delicious and service is always friendly. Easy parking and cool vibe inside."}
{"text":"I'm sorry to have to give this two stars.   I met my son there for lunch.  I had the four-piece nigiri and \"spicy tuna\" roll, which had an up charge cause it is labeled as the four-piece nigiri and California roll.  I didn't want the CA roll, therefore, changed it.  Glad I did!   The fish atop the nigiri was huge in some cases, folded over, which is nice except not something I'd expect.  Rather floppy, which means either lower grade or getting old.  There seemed to be an \"off\" taste in something in the spicy tuna roll.   I can't put my finger on it because it was rather sudden.   My son had the four-piece nigiri with the CA roll.   Glad I didn't have that roll!!   I don't know what it tasted like, but it didn't look like something I'd want to eat.   Sort of looked like something I'd put in a tuna sandwich or cream cheese sandwich.  Some kind of mix?   We both agreed we would not be back.   Maybe it's good with its Korean dishes, but don't think we want to find out.  The server, Mark, was competent, professional and friendly.   I don't know what the dinner traffic is like, but I hope he gets more in the way of business cause not many people in there to get decent tips.  It's in a shopping center close to ASU.   That should have been a tipoff for me.   I've not experienced a good restaurant yet that is close to the school."}
{"text":"Clean restaurant, cool music, great location and friendly service! You got to tip good since these plates are sizzling hot!  Good comes out hot!"}
{"text":"not my first time here, just the first review. The sake bomb roll was so great last time, i got it this time too. i was not disappointed. it rocks. spicy tuna, avacado rolled and wrapped with salmon.  the bomb.com also had hawaiian roll. ahi, avocado and mango. yum"}
{"text":"Favorite Sushi place in Tempe, always fresh and great sushi!"}
{"text":"Maybe it was just the word Gangnam made me want to come here because it reminded me of that song. So this place is a Japanese/Korean restaurant. I heard the sushi was good and the Korean food was good so I tried it. I liked it. I will have to say that the Korean stuff is more the pricey side while the Japanese food is about what you would find elsewhere.  I ordered sushi and Korean food. The sushi was good. The Korean tofu soup was even better. It had a lot of flavor and way more than the usual ones I find at other Korean restaurant. One thing about the staff is that they are so happy. Why are they so happy? I don't know. But they were happy and enthusiastic. If only they weren't so new and forgetful of things that you request.  Well food and service was good and the decor was very intimate so I say it's good place to bring friends and dates! There's very few Korean places in Tempe so this place is definitely a plus to the area."}
{"text":"This was a perfect date night. The food was so good. We shared a bibimbap and one of their fancy rolls -- I think a tiger roll -- and that was enough for just two of us. The bibimbap was huge! That alone would have been at least two meals for me. And the roll came out to be almost a sushi-rrito; it was pretty hefty. The quality was definitely there too. Both of us were very satisfied with our orders as well as the yummy side dishes. That afternoon, the service was excellent too. It might have been because it was an early afternoon dinner, so it wasn't busy enough to lose the attention of the servers. Nonetheless, the servers were really friendly and chatted with us a bit. Everything about Gangnam Sushi and Grill was just very satisfying that day. I hope future visits will be just as nice."}
{"text":"I came here with a large party of friends yesterday for lunch. I ordered the seafood soup combo (I asked for spicy and it was decently spicy! I was surprised to see regular cabbage in the soup) with spicy pork (good size portion for a combo meal). They provided banchan (fish cake, kimchi, bean sprouts, some type of salad, egg and soy daikon).   I'm interested to see what they offer for happy hour. Prices seemed a bit high but the portion sizes were great!"}
{"text":"This place was OK. Not the most authentic in my opinion but I think it's because they tailor their food to the students that live close by. An example is their jap chae. It was saucy and had large chunks of meat in it whereas it's normally not sauced and has julienned cuts of veges and meat if at all. I tried their sushi as well and it was standard to what other places offer. Not hating, just wont drive the extra distance again for dinner."}
{"text":"It was a great atmosphere. Friendly staff. I enjoyed my Tempe roll. Great menu. The only thing I didn't agree with was the price on some of the food items and the booze. I would come here again."}
{"text":"Amazing rolls, very good sushi! We had the sake bomb and Waikiki roll and both were great! Our waiter was very attentive and answered all of our questions.  Although the sashimi is 'fresh' every day according to the waiter I still feel that $6-7 for 2 thin 2\" pieces was a bit outrageous.   I also ordered a spicy sashimi salad and it was  ok but not something I'd return for. My daughter loved the rolls and suggests 5 stars but I'm leaning towards a solid 3 so we shall go with 4 for now.  If you're in the area, check it out! But definitely not a place I'd go out of my way to eat at... The search for the perfect sushi place continues..."}
{"text":"went in late on Saturday night, about 1230am, for just a small bite to kill time, only had an appetizer, sushi rolls, and soju. But the two we had were really good!! We took my cousin from Korea there, and she liked the food as well! They were not busy at a that time so we had no issues with service! The servers were attentive and helpful! We were there til 2am when they closed, and the servers did not try to rush us out! Will definitely be back again to try out entrees!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with a friend the other day.  Their menu is HUGE and has a lot of great lunch specials.  I opted for the sushi because I didn't want a food coma.  Overall, very underwhelmed.  Yes, the sashimi pieces are big but the fish is clearly not high quality.  It looks like it's been sitting out in the air for too long.  The sushi rice was also warm and mushy.  Gross...  I think I'll come again and try their Korean food, because that's what the other tables were all ordering.  Their bimbimbap did look really good!"}
{"text":"Great sushi. Both for me and my husbond and Out 17th month daughter. Especially the vulcano roll  hopefully we will come again, before travelling home"}
{"text":"We were looking for a good restaurant in Tempe, and this was one of the first that popped up, and boy am i happy we gave it a try! It was great! The servers were attentive, and on a Friday night it was busy, but we were still able to get a table. The ambience was not that of a fancy restaurant, but still had a good feel and nice decor. With all the amazing pics of the bibimbop, i decided to order a shrimp one, as well as 3 other rolls: the salmon and scallop, the waikiki, and the volcano roll. The bibimbop was extremely flavorful! I want to return just for another taste!  The rolls were large and full of fish, not just rice, fresh and creative. The volcano roll was definitely rich,  the waikiki was a very straight forward but fresh, and the salmon and scallop had a great semi-spicy sauce. All in all, i cant wait to come back here. The menu has a great variety, the kalbi looked like one to not miss!"}
{"text":"Another korean restaurant close to campus. I grab my lunch from DP dough right next door but I didn't really recognize this place. Last week was my second visit, and since I was pretty content with the food and service from my first visit (that was way back, like when it first opened in last summer but I wasn't on yelp atm :p )I was expecting the same level of service and food. The grilled spicy pork dish was great, except it was a little burnt. What upset me was the Budae-Jjigae. I was more frustrated than upset, because it tasted nowhere close to what it's supposed to taste like. The broth was bland and tasted just like salt water and barely had any ingredients in it. Since I live so close and come to this area a lot, I will be giving it another visit, but i hope it won't be so dissappointing."}
{"text":"Excellent family owned sushi and Korean food, in addition they have excellent customer service."}
{"text":"It was decidedly ok.  Nothing too spectacular, interesting, or new. In the end, a pretty forgettable dinner, but you could certainly do worse."}
{"text":"Fantastic. The happy hour menu is unreal. The value is unbelievable. The food is excellent."}
{"text":"The spicy seafood boiling pot was good. But my favorite is the whole mackerel--simply prepared grilled.  We also ordered Omakase B, with 6-7 nigiri sushi (huge portions) as well as a specialty roll. If you are craving both Korean AND Japanese good at the same time, give this place a try. Or, if you change your mind, there is a Thai, a Vietnamese, three Indian,  a Greek, a Mediterranean restaurant in the same plaZa! Plus a hooka lounge (Juba) mixed in with the eating places."}
{"text":"Amazing food and amazing service!! New to eating out alone, and I was so comfortable and super satisfied with the food, but more importantly, the service!! The girls recommended the regular favorites and I could not be more happy I went with their recommendations! The Bulgogi Bibimbap, or any Bibimbap I'm sure, was amazing!!! The red sauce you add on your own was so good!!! Mmm mmm good!!! Very relaxed atmosphere and again, there's no monetary value on great service!! The food is outstanding! I asked the waitress about every plate coming out of the kitchen because I wanted to try everything!! Definitely going back... Waitress recommended the udon noodles (with the chicken and shrimp (tempura)) and the soft tofu soup w bulgogi on the side!! This is a sushi place, yes, but has so much more to offer! I did have a sushi roll, (I know...all that for one person!! BUT, I brought home about 3/4 of the bibimbap), the spicy tuna w avo and the ahi on top, and it was fresh and tasty! I'm super picky and particular with sushi and this tuna was definitely fresh! Hands down, great food and great service!! Do it!! You won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Sushi was fantastic, and the service was amazing. The wait staff was super friendly and very courteous.  We even got complimentary mochi ice cream... FREE ICE CREAM!  Seriously... Check this place out."}
{"text":"Jury is still out on this place.  I want to try again before reviewing, just to be fair. Please comment and follow me for more reviews!"}
{"text":"Was out with my son and his fiancé shopping and we started getting hungry, after some debating we all decided that we wanted sushi, so my son took my phone and looked on up my Yelp app for places to go (he is a closeted Yelper haha) and found Gangnam Sushi & Grill, it was already on my mental list of places to go, because some of the cool Kat's I follow have posted some great looking pics of the food.  So off we went.  We were not quite sure we were in the correct location, but we found it, it's at the north east corner of University & Rural tucked in the back corner of the shopping center.  We were greeted right we when walked in, and shown to a table, it's a nice looking place inside.  We started off with an order of edamame, and some vegetable gyoza, let me tell you, the veggie gyoza are amazing! Deep fried, crispy texture and stuffed with great tasting veggies, a great alternative to the normal pot stickers, glad we gave it a try.  The boys went a little crazy and ordered quite a few rolls, I remember the spicy tuna rolls, California rolls, rainbow rolls and they also got a few of the specialty rolls as well. Everything was fresh tasting and had great flavor, Im glad they ordered a few so we could all try them out.    A funny thing happened after we ordered the sushi, I sort of got plate envy when I saw an order come out and I had to inquire about it. It was a hot bowl and boy did it look delish! A hot Bowl is big enough to feed 2, I'm not even lying, I had to pack up over half, which I had for lunch the following day. I got the Bulgogi hot bowl, it's a layer of rice topped with freshly steamed veggies, bulgogi and a fried egg, I also asked for the house made chili paste, gave it swirl on top it and dove right in! This was the perfect comfort meal, in fact I'm already craving it!  Service was great & friendly, and I look forward to going back."}
{"text":"They know how to make sushi rice!  This is now our favorite Sushi place in the East Valley!  The salmon nigiri is excellent!  They even make a delicious California roll; which I never thought would be possible!  The Happy Hour is fantastic!    They do Korean food well, too.  But it's the way they make the sushi rice that makes the sushi so flavorful.  The staff is always kind and the food is always fresh and delicious!"}
{"text":"This place is great. Great service. Great sushi. There spicy scallop pieces where amazing. I also had a yellowtail roll and the dragon roll which were very fresh tasting. I noticed there eel sauce was different. So i asked about it and it turns out they make it in house.  They also gave me the cucumber salad to start which was quite tasty. I am so excited its so close to where i work. I will be a regular here for sure."}
{"text":"I went there the other day at dinner, our server was quite lost in what we want and what we order, maybe our language wasn't understood dinner was great so far the service no that much, we had this two girls that work there who kindly helped us. Thank you Jocelyn and Ángela."}
{"text":"Sushi was very good, some of the freshest tasting salmon I have had in awhile. I'm from California so I always hesitate going to new sushi places with my high standard. I would definitely go back for more."}
{"text":"I've been here more than a dozen times and I like this restaurant. I don't know if it's authentic, but The Korean food is really great. Service used to be top-notch, but that's suffered a bit. I knocked off a star because the wait can be quite long, and food can be bland on occasion. The staff seems to care, but they are overwhelmed and the service suffers."}
{"text":"I haven't even left this place yet and I'm reviewing them. Sushi was AWESOME Volcano rolls and tempe roll are where it's at. Give this place a try well worth it!! I will be coming back without a doubt."}
{"text":"Great sushi, great service. Mark was an excellent and friendly server. It's hard to find quality fish in these parts. I'll be back, for sure."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite place for sushi in Arizona; the fish is always fresh and the rolls are reasonably priced. Additionally, happy hour specials will not disappoint. I also love how the restaurant is decorated: lights, Samurai swords, and a bamboo forest. The food from the grill always looks good, but I cannot resist their sushi. I try something different each time and I've enjoyed all of it. Needless to say, I will be returning many times in the future."}
{"text":"In general the portions are large and the prices are very reasonable. Excellent variety of rolls including some unconventional but delicious combinations. In addition, Gangnam offers many non-sushi options, making it a great place to go get your fix even if your friends don't like sushi. Great happy hour specials, great sushi and awesome bibimbap."}
{"text":"Worst soon tofu in the Valley.  If I lived in the area, I would consider going back just for drinks late at night but not again for food."}
{"text":"Fresh fish, good service, very unpretentious place. Just good food and reasonable prices. A place to go back to"}
{"text":"I was looking for an all-u-can eat Korean BBQ but was not able to find any in Phoenix. Decided to give this place a try. Came in during happy hour, they got some good and cheap items such as $1 miso soup and $2 soft drinks. Ended up ordering spicy pork Bee Bim Bap. It was very good. Came with a side dish of fishcake and kimchee all generous portions."}
{"text":"We live right down the street from Sushi 101 so that has always been our go to. When this popped up on our Yelp vicinity (even though we ended up driving somewhere else looking for this place). It is pretty much across the street from Sushi 101, right by Pho Nat. The place is very new so it was quite empty when I visited, but the food is good. I sat at the sushi bar and ordered all my favorite sushis off of a menu that was dry erasable. They have their menu split from Japanese food first, Korean menu second. I am going back to try the Korean menu but this trip, I ordered just sushi. The sushi was great quality and the portions are HUGE. A little too huge (I had to bite rolls in half just to eat it). And their rice to sushi ratio was waaaay off. Service could use some help but overall, not too shabby."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I came here last night and sadly the expectations were much greater than the reality.   I got the \"Chicken Bento Box\" which comes with teriyaki chicken, rice, miso soup, a California roll, and a variety of different fried vegetables. The chicken was pretty fatty, and the fried vegetables were very mushy, and didn't have a pleasant texture at all. The California roll, however, was very good!  My girlfriend got the \"Chicken Yakesoda\".. or should I say \"Yuckeesoda\" It did not taste good at all. Whatever seasoning they used, they put wayyyy too much of, causing it to be way too overpowering which unfortunately made the dish unenjoyable.  The service was okay. The time it took from when we ordered until we actually received our food was close to an hour. They forgot to give us our miso soup, and our rice, however, what they lacked for in timeliness and remembrance, they made up for in wonderful charismatic personalities. They were very apologetic for taking so long, and forgetting the soup and rice, and were eager to make sure we were doing alright along the way.  The last thing I wanted to talk about was their water. I did not like the taste of their water at all. It had a very strong tap water taste to it, and I know it's all the same, but when it comes to water, I am very picky with how it tastes, and I'm sure a majority of others are too.  Overall, I've gotta say it was just average. It wasn't absolutely terrible, but it wasn't that great either. I'm sure if we had gotten actual sushi/sashimi instead of dinner plates we would have enjoyed it a lot more than we did, because the rolls that we saw some people order looked absolutely phenomenal."}
{"text":"Fantastic! Dined in - restaurant has a nice atmosphere, wait staff was pleasant and attentive for our entire visit. We ordered a few different nigiri and several rolls - all were presented well, nice portion size for the price (ohmy, nigiri pieces were HUGE!), and delicious. The Mochi ice cream for dessert was the perfect sweet ending to a great meal."}
{"text":"Lunch double date had us try out a new spot for all of us and I'd say it was worth it. The restaurant was convenient, right next to ASU where one of my friends works. For a bit of a hole in the wall place it stayed consistently busy during a Monday lunch. Also, I don't believe it does much, if any, advertising.   Price wise I can see how poor local college students may write it off as too expensive with so many other options nearby.   The biggest pro I have about the food is the soup. I had a meat and tofu soup that came with my bulgogi that was very tasty. The bulgogi itself I wasn't too impressed with, but that's alright because it did the trick."}
{"text":"Was visiting ASU and decided to try this place out while I had about 6 hours before my flight. I found it really interesting that they do both korean cuisine and japanese sushi, so I decided to try both.  I wanted to try the Happy Hour but got here about 45 minutes too early.  So I decided to try their Kimchi tofu soup, which comes with rice and banchan. Their banchan consisted of kimchi, bean sprouts, maybe picked raddish, omelet, fish cakes, and cole slaw. The food took about 10-15 minutes to come out, so the banchan was able to manage my hunger in the mean time. The lunch serving is only like 9 bucks.  When my kimchi tofu soup came out, I was surprised to see that there were pieces of meat in it. I had assumed (probably where I messed up) that it was vegetarian because on the menu, all it said was \"kimchi\" and I didn't see any signs that it had meat. But I should have asked the server beforehand, so that was my fault. I asked the waitress what meat it was, and she said it was pork. While I generally don't eat pork, I am more strict with beef, so although she was nice about it and said it was an honest mistake to make, I kept the meal and just ate around the pieces of meat. Aside from the meat, the soup itself was very good and I really enjoyed it. So just a warning, if you are vegetarian or generally don't eat pork, ask them to make the Kimchi Tofu Soup without it!  So, when I was done with the soup, it was around 3, so happy hour!! Unfortunately, I was already pretty full from the Tofu soup!! But I really wanted to try some sushi because I was craving it and ordered hamachi nigiri and salmon nigiri, which were pretty well prices and $5 and $4, respectively for 2 pieces each.  The hamachi was good but the salmon was my favorite. I was pretty surprised how fresh the salmon tasted for being served in a restaurant in the desert! Very impressed! I wish I had more space to try out the rolls, but if I'm ever in the area again, I would definitely give them a shot. Overall, I think their Happy Hour prices are pretty awesome and I wish I had had the opportunity to explore it more!!! If you're lucky to be in the area, definitely come here for happy hour. The service was good, the staff were friendly and always checking to see how I was. All in all, great experience and I recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Waittress was very kind! Place is very clean. I only ordered Korean food. I ordered tofu soup. Kimchi was really good as well. I will visit again whenever I come to Phoenix."}
{"text":"This place is... Ok. Some of our food was good, service was ok (about half of the employees are good, half have no idea what they're doing), half of our food had to be ordered twice, half of it tasted good. We ordered an array of food including the Korean stir fry bowl, sushi, soup, apps, etc. Korean bowl wasn't the greatest, pretty flavorless. Sushi was good, but our nigiri was hard to eat- wayyyy too big for a one-bite. Everything ended up a mess as far as the sushi went. Don't know if I'll go back."}
{"text":"Great sushi place! I'm glad that Tempe finally has a real sushi place to go to! The staff was very friendly too. I would recommend going there to anyone. Best part is that they have green tea ice cream which surprisingly is hard to find at Asian restaurants in Phoenix. Definitely will be coming back."}
{"text":"I particularly enjoyed their Korean menu offerings.  I love the hwedup bap and kalbi tang.  Their sushi is very fresh and comes in large quantities to get full off of.  The nigiri sushi was the biggest I've ever seen, as the fish on top is the size of 2 orders at most other sushi restaurants.  Sushi and Korean food is always a A+ in my book.  Thankful to have found this place."}
{"text":"Happy Hour - Salmon skin roll (right) & Spider Roll (left) Yummy! This is my new Go To Happy Hour after work! 3-7pm Monday through Saturday, they have variety of things from $1-6, soooo gooood! Love this place! The service and staff are very nice as well."}
{"text":"We've come to this restaurant a few times already. Beside the convenient location (just next to ASU campus), we enjoy the food. The menu offers a variety of dishes, and everything we've tried was tasty. What makes this place different from a lot of Asian restaurants is the service - it is pretty outstanding here. We definitely recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"First time here the food was delicious and the service was excellent. The food came quickly, so if you come hungry this is the place. We went to see the stand up comedy at the improv across the street after dinner, so it was perfect location for quick and casual dinner! Thank you Gangnam Sushi."}
{"text":"Everything we had was incredibly delicious and fresh tasting. Since this was our first time here, i didn't know what to expect. We had a roll, bimbop, and katsu don...in each case i would have been extremely sad too see it end of i was not already stuffed. Definitely looking forward to my next visit. When it came to awarding stars, i was looking for a reason to take away some. Nothing came to mind...from the courteous and attentive staff, cleanliness, speed of food preparation, music, atmosphere; to whom ever created this place...well done, well done."}
{"text":"The food here is awesome! And the service is great. This is exactly what Tempe needs... a real korean style and sushi restaurant. Great flavor! I had the pro belly tofu pot.. yummmm!!# coming back for sure"}
{"text":"OH. MY. GAHD.  I love this place. Went 2xs in one week. I love to go to Shimogamo. I think Gangnam is a different atmosphere and a larger menu with different tastes but the quaility sushi is just as great. Also the tempura was fab. Service is great. and they have a great location. We will munch here often!"}
{"text":"My new favorite restaurant! Excellent food and spectacular service - at a \"it's worth it\" price!"}
{"text":"Moved here from California and we're very picky about eating Sushi. Found this place and haven't been disappointed yet. Great service, great Sushi. Give it a try."}
{"text":"I was impressed with the Sashimi Salad. It had nice big chunks of fish with a flavorful seaweed salad on top. The service was kind and attentive. My husband thought the veggie roll needed a little flavor/originality."}
{"text":"Korean is not my favorite, but I was impressed with both the flavors and service here. I had my first Bibimbop and it was great. The problems mentioned by the other vegetarian post here have been resolved and the vegetarian Bibimbop was great."}
{"text":"Friendly customer service, tasty food, and cool looking ambiance! Not to mention the home made Kimchi! Good place to have both Koran and Japanese food.   Also, they are open on Sunday nights."}
{"text":"This is truly awful sushi and service.  Just terrible.  I'm really not that picky, but the meal was bad from start to finish.  We got a couple of waters.  They had this bizarre plastic taste to them.  We got 4 different kinds of sushi rolls.  All of the fish tasted warm and slightly bad.  The rice was not the consistency it should be for sushi, it was almost mush.  The seaweed wrapping on them was at about the level I was able to achieve when I took 9th grade Japanese in high school a decade ago.  I don't know if they have an unqualified chef but the taste of every component was just bad.  If I wanted grocery store sushi I wouldn't have gone to a restaurant.  Despite there being only two other tables with people and 4 or 5 employees standing around talking, it took us a good couple of minutes to flag someone down for our check.  When we did, they didn't even apply the Happy Hour pricing to it.  We had to flag them down a second time to get it corrected.  Seriously, if you want the gas-station-sushi-in-a-restaurant experience go to Sushi 101.  At least their service is faster.  If you want good sushi, go to Sakebombers 5 minutes down the road.  I would not bother with this place and I look forward to whatever restaurant replaces them.  Bad service, bad food, bad atmosphere, just... a truly disappointing experience.  If you have a date with someone you're not into, this is where I would recommend taking them."}
{"text":"OK, first off I would like to humbly apologize for not taking any photos of the delicious sushi that I had eaten this evening.  And let me add that after that debacle of a meal I attempted last night, The timing in finding this place could not have been more perfect.    I walked inside, I was warmly greeted by three different employees and politely asked to sit down.  I sat down, I ordered, I chowed (more like inhaled) and I was very-very happy.  This is a great little sushi place, period.    There is certainly no shortage of places to eat in Tempe.  That said, there is a shortage of great, memorable places like this to eat.  If you like good quality, fresh-tasting sushi, bookmark this place, try it and enjoy!!  :p"}
{"text":"We had such an amazing experience here! This was my first time trying bibimbap and the waiter was so nice and patient with helping us decide what we should get as well as how to eat it! He answered all our questions (we had quite a few) without getting annoyed or seeming rushed.   We got the short rib soup which had a delicious broth and the meat itself was very soft and cooked to perfection.   The bulgoli bibimbap (which we were told is one of their more popular dishes) was definitely worth the hype. It was a HUGE portion,  sooo flavorful, and the meat was so tender.  Overall: great service, huge portions, and super flavorful food!"}
{"text":"First time in and it was dead around 2pm but I was pleasantly surprised by the ambiance, friendly and attentive staff and the massive portions. Best sushi restaurant near ASU hands down."}
{"text":"Most Sushi restaurants are closed between the hours of 2-5pm, and luckily found this little gem.  And better yet, came in during Happy Hour, which had a lot to choose from for Happy Hour.  Good service, and the mochi ice cream dessert was a nice finish to our sushi fest."}
{"text":"So, I always sit in the same spot when I come visit Phoenix for work. I order my usual soondubu and soju. I come to Gangnam Sushi and Grill because it's the closest spot that carries soondubu, 5.5miles.  Blame me for ordering soondubu here, but I've been here 6 times in the last 45 days ordering the same thing every time I come, except for 1 time with my coworkers. As far as soondubu goes, there is no consistency in taste or flavor. Usually it's always too salty(and I eat salty), today, as red as it is, no salt at all. No flavor.. no salt, no soy sauce, no dashida in the soup.. As if it were cooked just using Dadegi for coloring. Nevertheless, I always finish the soup! The waiter and waitress are always very polite and speedy, 5+! The place seems clean and well kept. I think it reflect the korean manager or owner lady that I always see here. Good management, bad soondubu.  I haven't tried the sushi yet, but not sure if I will.   Any recommendations for a soondubu place in Phoenix that I can make my regular spot.. say 1 - 2 times a week for dinner kind of spot?  6/2018  Update: I was wondering if anything had changed and stopped for dinner with a co worker.   Ordered the same thing I always order, Soon Dubu, and so did my coworker. We immediately followed it up with a bottle of large beer and soju.(We don't mess around)  How was it? This is my opinion, It didn't get any better.   $11.99 Soup base: 2/5 Tofu & other things: 3/5 (literally 3 small cubical pcs approx 1.25\" x 1.25x 1.25\" swimming around very loose soup base. If they would've given me a slightly larger spoon I would've finished it in 3 scoops. There wasn't much else floating around in there. Asian markets have BC* brand of Tofu packaged soup starters that is much better with just a few scallions and don't forget to throw in last weeks left over protein dish.(fish doesn't qualify).  Stick with the happy hour and sushi menu. The grilled stuff wasn't bad either! :)"}
{"text":"Best spicy pork bulgogi I've had (and I've tried a lot)! My brother loved his beef bulgogi and my parents loved the udon and sushi. We liked it so much we got take-out the next day of our 1-week vacation in Scottsdale. :)"}
{"text":"Looking for a place for lunch and I chose this establishment and my son and his mom were extremely happy with my choice! They loved their bento box (spicy pork and teriyaki chicken) and I had the tempura noodle soup and it was just what I wanted. Calamari was simple but really good, our waitress/waiter were really good at checking in on us A+ customer service! We'll be back most definitely!!"}
{"text":"I read amazing reviews and thought I'd give it a shot. That was by far the best sushi I've ever had! My honey and I try many sushi restaurants but we definitely have this number 1 on our list now. Our server Sarah was very friendly and knowledgeable with the menu. Yummiest sushi!"}
{"text":"Cons: a little hard to find, tucked in a corner with many other restraunts Pros: quick service, food (beef teriyaki and spicy pork) was amazing"}
{"text":"Love coming here for lunch.   Authentic, from-scratch  Korean cuisine just like in Dongducheon and Seoul and fresh sushi. Susan is very hospitable, kind and charming."}
{"text":"Service was average. They were attentive and friendly in the beginning but once it got busy, they were nowhere to be seen... I also had to ask for water several times. Sushi was good but the pieces were gigantic (like 4 bites)"}
{"text":"First of all i'm a huge sushi fan and I have to admit I'm quite disappointed by the lack of good selection there is in Arizona. So when I found this restaurant with all it's great reviews on yelp I had to try it out and see myself. My boyfriend and I were not the least disappointed! Not only was the costumer service spot on, the energy of the restaurant was cozy and comfortable! The pieces were pretty common sushi rolls between 10-14 dollars (average). I got salmon sashimi and two other rolls (will post pics). Everything tasted so fresh and delicious! The rolls were really good sized! Best part? They gave us a complimentary dessert that was crazy good! Everyone who loves sushi needs to try this out! Beware though, we passed the restaurant a couple times. It's a bit tricky to find if you don't know the area. It's on the mini strip connected to the Fed Ex."}
{"text":"We were craving some Korean food, this time we decided to try a new place for a change. Having seen a good rating of this place, we figured to give it a shot.   We ordered bulgogi and spicy pork totaling at around $44 (pricey for what you get). Both were okay, nothing special. We've had much better. While we usually eat with lettuce wraps, gojujang, and bean paste. Our waiter has no clue what we were asking for. Seems odd as these are normal request we make elsewhere and have never had a problem. This shows lack of knowledge of the food they serve. Disappointing. Management might want to train a bit more in my opinion. Aside from that, service was fine.   Skip. There are other places that taste better and will give you a bang for your buck while you're at it."}
{"text":"Solid place. Great variety and everything tastes awesome! Will be coming back! 3 favorites were Fire Jack, Spiderman, and Crazy Monkey. Is a bit small of a place though."}
{"text":"Tucked inside an older shopping plaza and neighboring the Ethiopian restaurant and pho place, Gangnam provides the perfect combination of sushi/Japanese and Korean food in one location. Although the shopping plaza itself is old, the decor of the restaurant is modern and hip, with a sophisticated flair.  We came here around 7 on a Friday night and it was packed! All the tables were occupied but there was still sushi bar seating available. The waiters all greeted us warmly and we decided to wait at the sushi bar area until a table opened up.  Once we procured a table, we browsed through the extensive menu and ordered enough food for a small army (What can I say, my eyes were bigger than my stomach!). We had the super Spiderman roll, bulgolgi bimbimbap, seafood pancake, jap chae, and spicy pork. Our starting banchan was a threesome of kimchi, sprouts, and fish cake.   The roll was huge, and filled with soft shell crab, shrimp, and veggies. The jap chae was excellent, filled with a lot of veggies and very tender, marinated beef. The noodles were cooked perfectly. The bimbimbap was a huge portion, beautifully arranged. I was slightly disappointed that there wasn't more caramelization of the rice on the bottom of the stone bowl. I love the crispy rice bits mixed in with the rest of the rice, veggies, and meat in this dish. The spicy pork was also very tender and flavorful, but not exceedingly spicy. The seafood pancake was good, but could have used a bit more cooking to crisp up the outside for more texture balance.  Service was a bit uneven as it took a long time to actually order, but once our order was placed we were checked on frequently and with very friendly staff.   Overall, this is a great place to dine, and even more alluring since they are open late on Friday and Saturday!"}
{"text":"I went here with my boyfriend for a little date night and we were very pleased with our whole experience here. They greeted us nicely and seated us right away. The service was on point and fast.   I ordered Chicken Yakisoba noodles and cucumber rolls, my boyfriend ordered a variety of different sushi's. My noodles were amazing. Great flavor and a good portion size. The cucumber rolls were perfectly sized and had the perfect ratio of rice to cucumber. I didn't try my boyfriends sushi as I don't eat seafood but it looked yummy and he said it was the best he's had around here!   The staff was very friendly.   We will most certainly be going here again! (And again, and again...) I have a feeling it will become a regular spot for us. I would definitely recommend Gangnam! :)"}
{"text":"We have been back multiple times since the review, and since the response from the restaurant, and in all honestly the service has definitely stepped up. We have had nothing but excellent service. My husband and I live in the West Valley and always make the trip at least twice a month. The sushi and bibimbap are the best we have had in the valley. As a matter of fact, we have plans to head that way tomorrow!"}
{"text":"Food is fresh and tastes great. The servers are all very friendly and attentive. The prices are a bit higher than other Korean restaurants, but I don't mind paying a little bit more for quality.   I would recommend coming in for lunch (a bit less pricey). The lunch bento box is a great deal! For 10.95 you get an 8pc California roll, tempura, teriyaki chicken, miso soup, and salad.   +1 from me."}
{"text":"Great place! We've been here a few times for sushi before going to tempe imporv to see a comedy show. I love their décor and the colorful wall. The place is clean and comfortable. The sushi is always tasty and their service is fast and everyone is really nice. We'll continue to make this our sushi place whenever we're in the area for the improv."}
{"text":"I'm glad it's called gangnam sushi and not gangnam kbbq. 20$ for the worst bulgogi I've ever had. Overpriced korean food so I definitely do not recommend any of their korean dishes. Sushi is good tho"}
{"text":"Doesn't look like anything special from the outside BUT the food and the service was excellent. Friendly service & comfortable spaces. We went because I wanted Pho, but when we saw they had beebimpop (sp?) we had to try it (don't see it on many menus). It did not disappoint. The server was very helpful and patient in helping us choose what we wanted. Terrific experience. Will definitely go back - if we can find it again!"}
{"text":"This place is great.  Hole in the wall location in a strip mall, but the Bimbipbap or whatever, was delish and enough for two to share.  Spicy pork, all kinds of veggies and toppings to add.  Nice service and very nice dining room.  Will be back!"}
{"text":"If I could give 3.5 stars I would. Went here based on reviews for happy hour and it wasn't that bad. The only major con: I have is the water. It tasted terrible! Worse than tap water. Order something from a bottle, not the soda machine. Probably has algae in it from not getting it serviced and cleaned.   Pros: the food was actually pretty good. I wished the gyoza wasn't fried but other than that, it was good and pretty cheap for 2 people."}
{"text":"Awesome quality! Amazing happy hour! Will definitely be back! Missed it after we left! And was satisfied.  I'm from San Jose ca so I was in search for good California level sushi and was delighted to find a place this good!! My mom was with me and was also satisfied and raging about the food! The chicken teriyaki was amazing!! The unagi nigiri was a great size and tasted amazing. We had a really good waitress, she was generous and took the time to help us and was patient. Her name was Maria! I would definitely recommend this place. Thanks so much Gangnam Sushi (:"}
{"text":"I tried almost all Korean restaurants I could find in the area and this one was by far the best. Really great bibimbap and seafood tofu soup. I'd definitely recommend and or go back!"}
{"text":"It's actually been a while since I went here. It was ok but not great. I thought it was expensive for the sushi roll portion sizes. I was disappointed because of all the other great reviews - I'm happy to pay a good amount for decent sushi but I'll stick to sushi places in Mesa instead. Might go back to try other stuff on the menu though.  My favorite go-to is Sushi Kee in Mesa (haven't tried their Tempe location yet)... it's cheap for sushi and not big on atmosphere but the fish is fresh and tasty!"}
{"text":"gooooooo toooooo thisssssss plaaaaaaaace. and come hungry because these portions are bangin'. I have gone twice now.  First time, I got the kimchi stew and was in spicy heaven. They bring it out in a bubbling cauldron and immediately the spice attacks your nostrils. From there, my memory gets foggy. I just remember sweating a lot, eating a lot, and smiling a lot. The broth is fire (figuratively and literally) with swimming slabs of silken tofu that caress your titillated taste buds.   Second time, I got the Hot Bowl. When you get this (and you will get this at some point in your life, you will), you gotta restrain yourself when they first set down that sizzling hot bowl. Why? because that bowl is so hot, it's still cookin this thing. So, let that rice crisp up just a tad. Trust me. It adds this lil crunchy element to those heaps of meat and veggies. Then, bing bang boom. Surrender yourself to the goodness  They also generally show somewhat random soccer games from leagues i have never heard of on the tvs, so yeah thats cool too!"}
{"text":"Really fantastic food and our server, Jenny, was patient, informed, and charming.  The Salmon Kama and homemade Ponzu was fatty, rich and delicious.  The soups were phenomenal, and the  homemade Kimchi was off the charts good.  Thumbs up!!"}
{"text":"Tried gyoza and bulgogi both were spectacular. Place may look like a dump on the outside but very nice inside. A little on the pricey side for student fare."}
{"text":"Their sashimi salad was lacking and filled with more greens than sashami, plus the greens weren't fresh. I picked out a few yellow and spotted lettuce from my plate. The dressing wasn't great on it either and I ate a piece of tuna that was on the edge and tasted foul. I regret paying $16.95 for this dish.   Their volcano and paradise rolls were really good though. They were very flavorful. The house sake was rough, but $3 for a small, can't really complain.   The atmosphere was nice and modern. The music wasn't to my taste. The staff were consistent with coming by to refill our water."}
{"text":"Like other reviewers, I'd say the service was great. But that's it. They give you tap water to drink. The Katsu Don was decent if you ignore the soupy rice mush under the actual meat. The spicy pork dinner entrée was nearly room temperature and just... Nothing remarkable. We should have been tipped off as to what kind of restaurant we were entering when there were no Asian customers and only a couple Asian employees... Not trying to be racist, but it's usually a pretty good indicator of the food quality when it's actually prepared and enjoyed by people of that nationality."}
{"text":"This sushi restaurant has some excellent sushi with great service. Along with the fact that the sushi is amazing and food comes in a flash there waiters are very nice and respectful. The California roll is my favorite with the perfect combination of ingredients. This is one of the many reasons why I love the food here. It is overall a great place to go and I totally recommend it."}
{"text":"Pros:  - Sushi roll size is huge! - Quality made sushi - Nice atmosphere - Not terribly expensive. Great value for the amount of food you get in each roll.   Cons: - Subpar service - Great sushi, but not elite level sushi  We'll definitely go back to this place in the future!"}
{"text":"(Lyrics - Psy - Gangnam Style)  Oppan Gangnam Sushi Gangnam Sushi Op op op op oppan Gangnam Sushi Gangnam Sushi  Op op op op oppan Gangnam Sushi Eh......Sushi & Grill Op op op op oppan Gangnam Sushi Eh......Sushi & Grill Op Op Op Op Eh Eh Eh Eh Eh Eh   Okay, with a name like that what song did you expect me to make a parody with......?  I was a skeptic about this place, but being a New & Hot spot on my Yelp app....why not!?  The place is not in the best location for a restaurant in my opinion.  I came here with a birthday dinner party.  Service wise I think they could improve; slow and inexperience.  I gather it's a new place and still might be getting it's kinks together however that's not an excuse I can forgive.    For our food we ordered the mackerel fish, Tiger & Spicy Tuna sushi, and the Bibimbap with Bulgogi.  The mackerel was cooked just right!  Salty to the bite and still retaining it's moisture; probably my favorite of the night!  Our Bibimbap was good, but I thought it was lacking in Bulgogi beef; probably another ounce or 2 of beef would have been welcoming.  I'm not a sushi snob but overall I thought the sushi was well plated and tasty.  I always enjoy a spicy and crunchy roll with some exotic ingredients.  Thus, we ordered the Tiger roll that included the Spider Crabs.  In the end, the 2 of us were pretty full and couldn't finish our meals.  Overall, I thought the food very good and finish what I could.  Not a lot of drink specials, but no complaints.  However, I was surprised at the price they were charging for some items which I could have ordered at other places for probably $1-$3 cheaper. - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Went here on a Thursday night around 9pm. On Yelp it says that it closes at 11pm, but the sign inside says it closes at 10pm. I felt a little bad and rushed eating my food. But I also finished what I could. At first the portions look small, but it's actually filling! It might also be because I ate it with some sake bombs LOL.   Me and my boyfriend got the bulgogi bibimbap. I was a huge fan of the bulgogi beef in this hot stone. One of the better bulgogis I've had in Arizona. I ate what I could because it was filling. Don't let the portion sizes fool you! We also got the sake bombs. It was litty. Might come back again to try their entrees."}
{"text":"The Japanese here is good, the Korean is better. (Prob because it is Korean owned) I usually like to pop in here quickly for a bite and watch a game on the flat-screens.  After discovering the Hwe Dup Bap here (mixed Korean sushi rice) I don't get anything else. It's a bit pricey at $16 but the value is there with a ton of fish mixed with rice, veggies, and chogochujang (Red Pepper Paste w/ Vinegar). It doesn't look pretty but it sure is a tasty bowl of goodness.  The Japanese side of the menu is decent but I found it not as strong in comparison to the Korean offerings. Sushi is average for the price though the nigiri slices here are quite phat. I couldn't put my finger on it but the sushi rice here falls flat compared to other places and the nigiri comes sans wasabi. Gyoza here is cooked perfectly and worth a try in its perfectly fried glory. Tempura didn't fare as well as the veggies were heavily breaded taking away from the shrimp.  It's pricey but the location and quality Korean keeps me coming back. (7 visits and counting!) Love the ambiance and music.  All in all, Gangnam is a great addition to the other Korean places near campus like Paradise Hawaiian and Grilled Ave."}
{"text":"The shopping center it's located in is for sure old, but the actual restaurant is super nice! I enjoyed the veggie gyoza, and my boyfriend enjoyed the spicy pork. I ended up not liking my soft tofu soup, but I made alterations to it so I really didn't feel like it was there fault. In the end the manager came over and comped it,  which I thought was very nice of him! I was more than willing to pay for it."}
{"text":"I find it hard to find great sushi or korean places in Arizona and was interested to see how Gangnam would live up to serving both! The rave reviews on a new establishment was definitely something that needed to be checked out.  The menu here has good variety with a good assortment of rolls, nigiri as well as Korean stews, casseroles and hot stone rice pots (i.e. bibimbap). However, with an appetite on the smaller end I decided to go for their Sake Bomb and an order of Vegetable Tempura.  The dishes come out with sides (banchan) typically served with Korean meals. Though it isn't the full array of 6, the sides consisted of fish cake, potato and Kim Chi. The fish cake and potato aren't the best I've ever had and seemed to be lacking in flavor. I did love the Kim Chi though, it's tart and spiciness was delicious! As for the Sake Bomb, it was a roll laid flat with Salmon, Spicy Tuna and Avocado. The freshness of the fish is okay and I found that their sushi is on the warmer side, not cold slices of fish (finally). However, it isn't amazing. The tempura was large in portion and had a good crust, but typical in flavor.  Pricing is on the pricier side as with most Japanese or Korean restaurants. Sushi roll was about $12 and tempura was about $6.  Judging by the service you can tell that the establishment is new and working out the kinks, however all the servers were genuinely friendly, sought out answers to questions and forewarned that it was their first day. Though a bit spotty in forgetting certain things, they were attentive, refilled waters and made sure to do frequent check ups on customers. The interior is clean and modern.  Definitely would like to come back to try their Korean dishes and to eat more of their amazing Kim Chi!"}
{"text":"A friend of mine recommended this place over Sushi 101, which I had already tried. I came during happy hour and grabbed the salmon skin roll, the teriyaki chicken, and green tea & strawberry mochi. The salmon skin roll had the tendency to fall out, but it was delicious nonetheless and I didn't really need to chase it with soy sauce. The teriyaki chicken came with the usual orange slice and was made with lots of sauce, the way I like it. The mochi ice cream was delicious(you can never go wrong with mochi ice cream) and visually appealing. I think I found my main sushi spot here for the next few weeks!! Very friendly staff, asked what I was doing all the way here from Hawaii."}
{"text":"OK so I went with some of my friends tonight to this place and figure we do something different than Pho.  As one of my friends got to the place before the rest of us, he requested for a corner table by the window since there was only 4 of us and the host said he can't have that table.  My friend told me that there was only 2 other tables that had customers and the host couldn't even give him that table and instead decide to give us the 6 person table.  Makes no sense at all and disrespect by the host.  Anyway, we all got there and the food was OK as we all ordered the Bulgogi entree and nothing was special about it.  Overall it was an OK experience for dinner as I was not pleased how the host can't oblige a customer's request to have a table by the corner.  I wouldn't go back to this place because of the way how my friend was treated as a customer and this place doesn't have the better food than other places I have tried.  Sorry Gangnam, you have lost yourself 4 customers that won't come back."}
{"text":"Honestly this place blew me away. I was just in the area and was craving sushi so checked out spots around me and found this place. First off the staff was very helpful in helping me choose some new things I hadn't had before! Their rainbow roll and salmon sashimi was SO FRESH!!! I even love that they have Mochi, which not a lot of sushi places in the valley do! Overall this place was bomb and it's going to be my new sushi joint."}
{"text":"I'm so happy a decent sushi place is within walking distance of ASU. I usually actually get their Korean food - their hu dup bap is really good. I also like they're later hours. This had become go to place for good healthier food when I have a late night working in lab."}
{"text":"Ordered he dup bop and soon tofu with spicy pork. Soon tofu was ok but pick pork portion was very tiny. I am Korean and Korean food here is 2/5 Dish was messy  food was hanging over the plate.   Would not come back"}
{"text":"The food was great. It was nice to see both sushi and Korean food on the menu. I would definitely go back. The Korean food was great and just like I remember it from being in LA."}
{"text":"I will start off saying the sushi we ordered was okay. The service however was terrible. Our reservation was forgotten about. Two people came late and had to ask for water from three different servers before getting water. We waited over 40 minutes for our sushi, before reminding a server, who wasn't our own about our order. Everyone at our table actually has been in food service, we could have certainly understood if the kitchen was backed up, but with a dead floor and three sushi chefs, that shouldn't have been the case. Then the sashimi was forgotten about. We had intended to order drinks as well, but after spending almost two hours waiting on food, we didn't have the patience. Our server Cody questioned us when we asked to speak to the manager, and then informed us that he was in fact the manager. I would strongly suggest some better employee training if this is the case. Jocelyn however was good, she actually brought us water and asked if we needed anything, and she was the one that checked on our orders."}
{"text":"I had Chicken Yakisoba here and it was just ok, not great, not bad.  My date had sushi and said pretty much the same thing.  The service is friendly, but it may take you awhile to get some of your food.  All in all, this isn't a bad place, just not one I would return to unless someone really wanted me to."}
{"text":"Whoohoo!!! Finally there's a real (authentic) Asian restaurant near to ASU Tempe campus within walking distance, and with late hours! I tried a soon tofu (mixed) and kimchi stew..both were really good! They have a sushi menu and a Korean menu, listed different dishes. If I may give one suggestion - would be great if they also serve boba tea/milk tea."}
{"text":"Happy hour here is dangerous. Everything is so good. All of the rolls were delicious and the bipimbap was incredible."}
{"text":"I really like this place but I have to adjust my rating based upon my last couple experiences. One time I ordered to go and they received my order but never prepared it... tonight I placed an order and they told me the price, then I show up and there's a pickup surcharge?  For real?  So they quote me one price on the phone then I show up and the server repeats that price and then says \"oh wait forgot about that surcharge\". It was $3 so nothing crazy but just a ridiculous experience"}
{"text":"Every roll fell apart. Very little taste. Nice atmosphere, but we've had better sushi in Iowa, believe it or not."}
{"text":"They normally don't take reservations but made an exception for our large group of 12.  The food was good, however there wasn't a kids menu.  If you bring little ones, I would recommend the Gyoza (aka pot stickers)."}
{"text":"Great service friendly staff food came out pretty fast. The Smaller location better the food."}
{"text":"I went here with a few of the Asian crew and people have been telling me good things about it.   My friend was telling me about their awesome Tofu soup so I got the mixed option and a side of Kalbi for about $20 dollars. Luckily, I have very generous friends so I even tried some of their food.  Tofu Soup- Very hearty and full of surprises. I ordered my Tofu soup the spiciest but it wasn't really that spicy. In the tofu soup is soft tofu, shrimp, ground meat, some clams, and a nice uncooked egg that they plot right into the bowls before serving. Since the soup arrives boiling, the egg gets cooked rather fast. In general, the soup was very hearty and tastes like a typical tofu soup with a lot of red pepper paste (a Korean specialty). The friend who invited me here raves about their soup and I agree, I would say if you had to go here, get this soup because it's unique and they do it well.  Kalbi- For those that don't know, Kalbi is horizontally cut thin slices of pork ribs. Very good but it's a pretty small plate. The meat was cooked a little bit less than what I'm used to, where the meat is slightly charred, but overall, it was pretty good quality kalbi.  Bulgogi- Bulgogi is pretty much marinated beef. In all honesty, it is not my favorite type of Korean beef as if not cooked right, it tastes like wet, salty paper bags all scrunched up together. The bulgogi my friend had was pretty dry, just the way I like it. Nothing special if you haven't had bulgogi before but it wasn't something to write about.  Bibimbap- Layer in a huge cast iron pot, my friend ordered this one and it was a beautiful presentation. I tried a little bit when he mixed it up and it sure tasted like Bibimbap! Again, nothing special, but it's a very big portion which is a plus to me!  Sushi- The sushi's pretty average here. Apparently, there are a few Korean sushi joints that add rare thin slices of beef on top of the sushi. The specialty rolls tasted of good quality but my only complaint was the salmon roll, which I found the rice to be a little bit overcooked. Sashimi (Tuna) - I snagged one off of a friend's plate. I never order Sashimi in Arizona because it literally can't compare to California. The Sashimi I find in Phoenix is either too soft (bad thaw process) or too hard (wrong cut). This time, it was too hard. The texture, which I find is the most important part of Sashimi, was like eating hard plastic.  Ambiance Gangnam Sushi and Grill reminds me of a hip noodle shop in my college. As I sometimes mention, the \"color\" of the restaurant was black, at least going there at night. You might disagree with me, because there is a giant white, wavy wall that has LED lights on one side. However, the tables were black and the bar opposite of the white wall was of granite color. Maybe they were trying to do the whole Yin Yang deal.   Most Korean restaurants give metal chopsticks (someday I am going to find a reason for this) but this restaurant gives out wooden chopsticks. I guess since this is technically a hybrid Korean/ Sushi restaurant, that's ok. I am always partial to black plastic chopsticks and I'll make an argument that I would like those instead of wooden ones but this is a very minor complaint.  Cost About $20 dollars a meal. Decently expensive but this is comparable to most Korean restaurants in Phoenix. This restaurant focuses on the fact that you will get less food the higher quality the meal is. This of course, makes sense. Raw tuna costs a lot more than cabbage. Point being, if you order a meat plate, you will get more bulgogi than kalbi at the same price. If you're into the quality of the food, then this is a perfectly fine thing to do. For one, you're eating high quality food, and consuming less calories. I would say the best bang for your buck is the Bibimbap. Looks beautiful and can feed a horse.  Selection Gangnam has an impressive array of both Korean and Sushi options. I think if I was a regular, I would never get Sushi here because it's just so common. However, the sushi here isn't bad, it's the same as everywhere else. The drinks menu is plentiful with a lot of Asian beer, wines, cocktails, and of course... soju...  Overall Tucked away in a corner strip mall, Gangnam is a pretty nice gem. It has a mix of authentic Korean food and the sushi is alright. I don't think I'd ever order sushi here because the Korean food is legitimate enough to eat on its own but everyone loves sushi so it's a good move for the owners to put it there."}
{"text":"Wow this place is amazing! We come every year to Tempe for the Arizona Aloha Festival and are always looking for a good restaurant. We are from the San Francisco Bay Area.  We were so hungry from working all day and greeting our awesome customers  Charles greeted me first and he was so welcoming and nice.  I liked the ambiance of the restaurant and felt very comfortable.  It's super clean which I love and my husband is crazy about Samurai swords and was checking them out on the wall.  Food is super delicious.  I can't tell you how satisfying it is to eat a hearty meal that you truly love.  We had the beef Bibimbob and it was out of this world.  Huge portion served in a hot stone bowl, fresh veggies and beef was marinated to perfection and juicy.   Presentation was on spot.  We also had the Kalbi Beef Short Ribs on a iron hot plate.  Off the chain!   Portion was generous, flavor = perfection and quality cuts of meat.  We also ordered 2 hand rolls and those were fresh and yummy too.  Charles checked on us several times to ensure we were doing good.  I'm sad we don't have Gangnam Sushi in the Bay Area.  I have to wait a whole year until I come back.  Charles, thank you for your outstanding service, positive attitude, friendly staff and most importantly delicious food. See you next year!"}
{"text":"Was on a quest to find a new sushi place for our family getting together dinners. My daughters boyfriend recommended go try this place. I'm glad we did.  It is a small sushi restaurant but very cozy and friendly.  We ordered a few appetizers and they were very good.  Sushi were fresh and tasty and they all had their own taste ( some-places they all taste the same)  Also have a big variety for vegetarian sushi, I would recommend to try plum one it is something very special, some of u will love them some of u will not, but it is unique one u have to try it at least once. Most of the rolls are priced under 8$ and only special ones are around 11/12$ but those are really big rolls there was 5 of us and we only ordered 3 big ones and 3 regular plus one big vegetarian roll and 3 regular vegetarian and we had to take some of it home with us.  Will definitely coming back and will recommend!  I guess we found our new sushi place!"}
{"text":"Great service. Our waitress was very attentive. Water and banchan were automatically refilled without having us to ask for it.   Food was great too. We ordered the  beef noodle soup and japchae. Both were well seasoned and delicious.   Will definitely visit again.   Plus we were offered free ice cream. But can't stomach anymore food."}
{"text":"Really awesome place. Having moved down from Flagstaff where there was only one Korean BBQ joint, I was excited to try out new places. I'm gonna be honest, realizing just how close this was to campus put me off for whatever reason; I was expecting a very limited menu with mediocre food but this was the opposite! I had the bulgogi bibimbap (a dish that I've had many a time and I'm admittedly kind of picky with) and it was really delicious. My sister had a tofu soup and bulgogi and both dishes were really good as well. If you're a student, near campus, or need a bite to eat before catching Pokemon at Tempe Town Lake, I'd definitely stop in here."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try a new sushi place and step away from the norm, but unfortunately I wasn't happy with the end result. I ordered the spicy tuna roll, and the Kobe roll. I'm not sure if it was the usual chef on staff, because comments were made when one of my friends sent his dish back. Regardless, my spicy tuna roll was mushy and the fish didn't taste fresh. The Kobe roll was a risk in itself because it had beef on it. I had never tried a sushi roll with meat! I was excited to try it, however, I was only able to take a few bites. It was tasteless, plain, and the consistency was a little off. Again, the fish didn't taste fresh. The service was great but unfortunately, the food was completely opposite. For the price, I would rather go to my usual sushi spot."}
{"text":"Strolled into this place while looking for a spot to eat sushi! Come to find out they also have an entire  Korean menu! For it being busy we received fast service and the happy hour is awesome. The crew is very attentive and it's great to see owners involved in their buisness!! Stop by and check it out if your looking for something with great ambience and a friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Very authentic Korean bibimbap, amazing bulgogi, freshest sashimi, great service - I just wish they had cucumber kimchi and fresh wasabi... I will be back soon for happy hour! I would give 5 stars but it didn't have much of an ambience. Cheesy decor and no music. Also, skip the Vegas roll.., it's out of place unnecessary with the quality of this place, you don't need a Las Vegas roll. Stay true to what you do well."}
{"text":"Best Korean food I have had in Phoenix so far. Portion size matches price. Don't drink the tap water, typical Tempe trash taste. Quality of meat could use an upgrade."}
{"text":"Enjoyed my meal here before a comedy show across the street but I will point out that there was a lady that either is the owner or the manager that was very unprofessional with her workers, kept on correcting them in front of people and so off putting overall. Plus she does her work on customer tables, you can't find a space in the back?   Anyway, the rest of the staff including the people that she would correct were attentive and kind.  Sushi pieces were huge on top of a small portion of rice. I enjoyed it, the rolls were good as well and didn't fall apart like some places.  Overall I enjoyed this meal except for the older lady that needs some help when talking to someone."}
{"text":"When you say you're craving a legit, authentic, mom and pop - hole in the wall shop - that is Gangnam Sushi & Grill.   My husband and I have been lucky enough to stumble upon this location twice and both times were amazing! The first time we came with another couple and really enjoyed some sake bombs. Good price, good options and great service. The second time we went the service was still amazing and the food was spectacular! We had tailgated all day and had been quite starving so we ordered: gyoza, short ribs (app), hot tofu soup with bulgogi and shrimp yakisoba! (We we're starving).   The appetizers were so delicious and made us crave more and the soup was absolutely perfect! Mixing the rice, soup and beef together was the perfect combination! Although the shrimp was okay, they were very generous on the amount of protein in their dishes!   I would definitely recommend and visit again. I would just prefer the land meats opposed to the sea. Overall great service and taste! You got a fan in me!"}
{"text":"Great food for a great price, but the service is awful every time we've come. Great Happy Hour!"}
{"text":"We went last week on a recommendation from Yelp to celebrate a special occasion, we were not disappointed. It was empty when we walked in around 8:30 pm, but every visible staff member welcomed us in. From beginning to end, everyone was super friendly.  The decor is pretty modern and trendy, nothing too flashy.   They have a Japanese/Korean menu, but we had choose this restaurant to try the teriyaki chicken and sushi.  We ordered sushi and teriyaki combo plate and an entree, we did not expect the portions to be this big.  It was all delicious and we were even given complimentary ice cream!   This is a very nice restaurant.  Large food portions, even the sushi was plentiful, along with some tempura vegetables.  The service is exceptional, everyone was friendly and courteous. I would reccomend."}
{"text":"So.... it was one of those days.... my friend and I had tried to go to some 4 different Tempe restaurants to find that they were closed (it was around 3 pm). Who knew that was a thing? ( not me obviously). So we found Gangnam sushi and were excited because they were open! It was a Friday afternoon but apparently the worst time to come to this restaurant for several reasons:  1. Lunch had ended 2-3 minutes ago  2. There is no happy hour on Friday... booooo.   3. They were not busy which somehow translated in the service being horrifically bad.    We were pretty bummed to have missed any potential for food specials, but carried on. I ordered the spicy tofu soup with 'meat' and an order of inari. My friend ordered a couple of rolls... one of which was baked (?!?!). I'm not sure how we got on the subject, but the waitress and I were discussing the way inari come and she told me they serve theirs differently than everyone else....she said it only had a little bit of tofu.... I decided to try it anyway. So the inari come out and they are EXACTLY the way they are at every other restaurant (little fried tofu pockets filled with rice). Weird. The soup I had was very tasty and filling, though next time I would probably skip the meat... it wasn't necessary and didn't add much to the dish. The tofu and egg and spicy broth was excellent. My friend's rolls were fairly standard. So here comes the sad part.... we ended up waiting for about 20 minutes for our check... don't ask me how, but we could not get anyone's attention. There were literally 2 tables full in the whole restaurant. The staff were all sitting around playing on their phones. We literally had to get up and ask for the check at the sushi bar. Ugh. I would come back for the food if I were in the area, but I wouldn't go out of my way for a return visit."}
{"text":"The interior of the restaurant is really nice and the place is extremely clean. Service was  quick and the food tasted great. Decent prices as well, I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant a few times and have enjoyed the sushi for the most part. I like the more flavorful selections of the rolls, the fish itself if pretty tasty. Looking forward to trying some of the other menu items, they look and smell amazing!"}
{"text":"Conveniently located near ASU, this hole in the wall joint came recommended by a friend we were meeting with his girlfriend. It was a nice, small and quiet restaurant with a cool Bambu mural that tied the space together.   For being a Monday afternoon, the restaurant was consistently busy. I can understand why some might consider it expensive and write if off given the area it's located in with the various options that are more affordable to a college students wallet.   Gangnam's menu is comprised of 2 sections-both Korean and Japanese styled cuisines, as well as a sushi menu. I ordered a Bento box that came with an order of Bulgogi, an assortment of Nigiri with Miso soup and a salad; my boyfriend ordered the Bulgogi that came with a meat/tofu soup. No complaints necessarily, other than I've had better Korean bbq. The slices of Nigiri were cut larger than most places which was appreciated. I will add that the soup that came with my boyfriends meal was flavorful to the point that I ended up eating a portion of it.   Overall, we enjoyed our lunch and appreciated the service."}
{"text":"Delicious sushi and I must say, at a decent price! Very sweet staff and great atmosphere overall. I would definitely recommend to a friend!"}
{"text":"Not sure about this place... There were 3 servers but nobody seem to know the menu. When asked to make take out order after our meal, the server asked where on the menu did I see the soup. The sushi roll ordered was way over priced. Not enough ingredient & too much rice. They had pictures on the menu which they don't even have & the server stated it's for looks. Spicy pork had a smell & wasn't spicy. Friend of mine ordered the tofu soup but it was oily, blend & no taste or flavor. We thought it was very high priced for what was served."}
{"text":"I never noticed this place before since it's tucked back in the corner of that shopping center but I saw that it had good yelp reviews so decided to give it a try!  Ordered take out from here for a lunch with friends at my house.  Prices were reasonable and the food was tasty (little more than $50 with tip to feed 5 ladies).  Service was really friendly too.  I only ordered rolls but I'd like to come back and try the nigiri to see how that tastes."}
{"text":"We went a little earlier on in the evening on a Friday. The atmosphere was a quaint trap house. They music was loud, I'm not a grumpy old man but why so loud?  Service was spotty. It seemed like we had two waitresses helping each other out this lead to more confusion than help though. Just small things all night, forgotten waters, and it took us asking for our bill more than once to final get it.  The redeeming reason they still got 4 stars was the food. We mainly stayed on the happy hour menu. The prices were good and the quality was on point. The kalbi and spicy pork were great! Other in our party went more with the sushi route and everything was great!"}
{"text":"Everything was phenomenal! We tried their sushi, gyoza, bibimbap, and mochi! And every last bite was delicious and the service was very attentive c: definitely telling everyone about this place and returning! :D"}
{"text":"Love the sushi here! My boyfriend and I go at least twice a month. The staff is friendly. We usually go during happy hour, and the happy hour menu has a great selection of sushi. The amount of sushi you get during the happy hour is worth it."}
{"text":"Another hole in the wall. This one looks uninviting and kind of scary from the outside, but please don't let that stop you! The inside is smallish, but very well planned out seating. I had no trouble getting my daughters wheelchair in side. The menu is extensive and the rolls were very good. My only issue was the length of time it took for my son to get his teriyaki Bento box. 45 minutes. By then myself and my other son were done. He let me have a couple of bites and I have to admit that it was seriously tasty. Not too expensive, clean, and very tasty. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Nice place.  Pretty busy for a week night. My husband ordered the Bi Bim Bap.  He liked it.  I tried a bit.  I didn't like it. I had the pork belly.   It was cold by the time it arrived.  (10 minutes after my husbands dish had arrived.)  It was just O.K.   The cabbage was delicious.    Nobody came to check on us to see if we needed more beer or water.   There seemed to be lots of staff around, but they didn't  come around."}
{"text":"I am very impressed with the food and service here! I have been here on two occasions. First time I had the bulgogi bibimbap and the second time I had the Katsu Don. The only thing I wasn't a fan of was the salad before the meal. The lettuce was not very green and appeared quite white. I think it may have been iceberg lettuce and I may be a bit biased because I am not a big fan of iceberg lettuce for salad. It was also super tiny and to be honest I can't tell if the dressing had little flavor or if there wasn't enough dressing... because it was quite bland. It could have been a fluke. But wow do I recommend the Bibimbap! It was so yummy! I think the prices are okay. Not super cheap but I looked over the lunch specials and those prices definitely appealed to me. The service was wonderful. On both occasions the servers were so nice, helpful, and attentive. I haven't tried the sushi so I can't speak for that but the meals I had were great aside from the salad. Although I would definitely recommend this place. It's not huge but it's very clean and it has nice decor, friendly service, and good food."}
{"text":"This place is located in a small strip mall right off of University & Rural Rd.  The inside is very modern and geared towards students.  Service there is really great, and the Korean food is actually on par.  The only complaint is that their ban chan selection is pretty mediocre.  Usually at Korean restaurants you receive a plethora of ban chan, but here, you only receive 3. They have no problem refilling the ban chan for you though...and I didn't pay attention, but I think it's at no additional charge.  They have a combo meal there that I love which you get a choice of a meat/fish and a hot pot of tofu soup. It fills me up every time!  If I lived closer, I'd frequent this place more often and try their sushi."}
{"text":"What a wonderful hidden gem! I went here for the first time last night and I will definitely be coming back!   I had the escolar nigiri and it was some of the best I've ever had. Nice thick pieces of fish, which was a pleasant surprise.   Then I got the Vegas roll and my boyfriend got the Kentucky roll (a roll with fried chicken and cream cheese? Yes please!). Both were amazing! He wasn't even hungry but he still didn't want to share his with me. My Vegas roll was one of the best I've had too. I highly recommend both!"}
{"text":"We changed summer business hours  And summer happy hours.  Check photo. I love happy hour. Happy hour menu so good!"}
{"text":"One of my most favorite spots for Korean food. Their bibimbap is definitely one of the better ones in the area and it's REALLY BIG (hello bang for buck!!) The rice comes out crispy just like it should ;)  The sushi is also good, always fresh (tho the last time I went and had the chirashi bowl, only the tuna was a little iffy - everything else tho was excellent) I like this place because if you want sushi but you are with a group who \"don't eat no raw fish\" *_* there is quite a variety of hot food, which is very good too. They also have hot sake- happy happy ;D  The ambience is casual, it's not a hole in the wall by any means, nicely decorated, tho they need to repair some booth seats. The servers are nice, typically collage kids, not that that's a bad thing, but sometimes they can be a little distracted.   All in all a good go to place for hot and cold Asian grub."}
