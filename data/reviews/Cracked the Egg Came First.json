{"text":"just ordered a hungry chief! an awesome, filling n hot wrap!"}
{"text":"FINALLY! I have driven past the truck lots of times, I finally got some Cracked this weekend at a festival in downtown Urbana. 

The burrito I got was AMAZING! I forgot what it was called, but holy cow, it was great. Also split some tots with my friends. They were crisp, delicious and had truffle oil and parmesan! 

Friendly workers, good food, quick service...do yourself a favor and try it out!"}
{"text":"If any establishment had to replace Antonio's I'm glad it's this place! Love that it ls open until 3am on certain nights :) however the service can often times be quite slow and the food can be very very greasy at times. A personal favorite are the French toast bites and sloppy Jose"}
{"text":"I discovered the Cracked Truck at the Farmers Market at Lincoln Square Mall with my boyfriend. The truck itself is pretty awesome, with its bright colors and drawings. The guy who took our order was surprisingly nice and polite, especially when taken into consideration that the line was HUGE, and had been for quite a while. I wanted the Sloppy Jose sandwich because it came with chorizo, as well as homemade bacon onion jam, but they were out. I ordered the Morning Bender, an egg sandwich with cheese and hashbrowns, with cream cheese instead, and my boyfriend ordered the same, but with chipotle pesto. We ordered a side of white cheddar bacon tots to split. The sandwiches were really good, and served on brioche from Pekara Bakery. The coffee was also local, supplied by Columbia Street Roastery. But the best part by far were the tots. Like cheesy fries on steroids. I highly recommend, plus they should be on campus this fall during the day and on Green St till 3 AM. I anticipate spending a lot of money at this truck."}
{"text":"Cracked is about as good as breakfast gets in Champaign/Urbana. They've got a solid menu that can cater to any taste and a friendly staff. There's always music playing and the truck itself is a sight to see. If the line isn't backed up due to the rush from class being let out you can get a hot, fresh sandwich in just a couple minutes.

My personal favorite is the Vegasm with the Goy Vey being a close second."}
{"text":"Fast and friendly service. I had the Morning Bender sandwich and it was delicious. I'm looking forward to trying the others."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try out the Cracked truck for awhile now and I was NOT disappointed.  The Morning Bender with bacon was just awesome.  Husband got the breakfast burrito and was not disappointed- the only breakfast burrito we've found in CU that comes close to what we got used to in Southern CA.  Different, but just as delicious.  Husband asked for no onions and they were happy to accommodate.  Remember, it's a food truck, not a gourmet restaurant, so they probably can't cater to EVERY picky thing you might want to change, but we were more than happy with our experience and will absolutely be back!"}
{"text":"The food was good, although I can only speak on behalf of the food I tried: the Vegism (I forget the name) sandwich and the sweet potato tots.

 The sandwich was definitely nice and light, not heavily seasoned, borderline under-seasoned in a good way. 

The sweet potato tots were good but after I had a third of them, I had gotten to a point where it began to taste too good,  (although just the natural sweet potato-y sweet) the sweetness was getting monotonous and my tastebuds were exhausted from the flavor [they were still tasty, it just may be that I'm not as big as a sweet potato fan as I think].

For a breakfast food truck, I say keep up the good work! Tasty breakfast food,that isn't bogged down with grease and fat. I say: A great way to start out your day."}
{"text":"These guys are amazing. Their toys are really interesting and delicious. Worth a special trip to try their food. Real quality stuff."}
{"text":"I've tried a few things on the menu and its all incredibly good. The food is reasonably healthy and its all fresh. Its definitely the best food truck in Urbana, possibly the best breakfast food server on campus."}
{"text":"This review is for the brick and mortar location, which is AWFUL. 

Where's the value added over the trucks? They still run out of food regularly (e.g., French toast bites), service is still very slow (slower than the trucks actually), they still overcharge for drinks, and they have very little seating.

Plus, the food is WAY worse than on the trucks. All of the ingredients are cold and pre-made. Instead of frying the eggs fresh, they're using some cold, strange, McDonalds-looking egg in their sandwiches. And they're not even cooking the spinach down. They use some stupid panini press on all of the sandwiches as a substitute for actually cooking things. I don't understand why the trucks provide better, warmer, fresher food than the brick and mortar.

Bottom line: go to the trucks, which are great (considering they're trucks - lack of reliable supply, high prices and slow service are understandable there). The brick and mortar should be avoided, since it keeps the bad and leaves the good aspects of the trucks."}
{"text":"Amazing food and the staff were great! Bring an appetite and an open mind to their fusions!"}
{"text":"Most delicious sandwich and tots combo ever. Strong vegetarian option for sandwich and the Texas toast bites were the bomb"}
{"text":"Egg-cellent! Sorry for the cheese. I had too. 

Tried this place because it was parked down the street from Courier Cafe on Sunday and we didn't want to wait an hour for breakfast. I had the Vegasm with spicy chipotle pesto. It was delicious! Fresh ingredients, well prepared, friendly staff. 

My very picky boyfriend had the hotdog with scrambled egg (can't recall the name), he enjoyed it. 


Definitely will try again."}
{"text":"I am forever thankful for Cracked's existence!  It's awesome to finally have a place so close to the Siebel Center where I can get fresh, delicious food so quickly.  They have a great variety of both breakfast and lunch options, make everything fresh to order, and are flexible with customizing.  I appreciate how they have wraps in addition to just baguettes, because I don't like a lot of bread with my sandwiches.  The guys who run it are very friendly and seem to work very hard to remember regulars' names and keep the truck open so often throughout the week.  I'd rather support a local business built by my peers than a chain restaurant any day, and Cracked totally deserves it."}
{"text":"Good place to grab food after drinking all night. However, some quality control issues because sometimes the people working late at night don't give a crap so I've gotten a couple of sandwiches that were burnt to a crisp on the inside and didn't realize it until I got home. 

Oh well, at least I was drunk when I ate them!"}
{"text":"Man this truck is amazing! it's all pretty  much breakfast based sandwiches. I got a sloppy joe , chorizo patty, hash browns with egg, avocado, and some special onions. It was delicious. Definitely recommend. 

It's a new food truck on campus. Find it and try it out for yourselves. They serve breakfast all day pretty much. Run by recent grads of U of I."}
{"text":"Love the food and the people seem nice, but for Christ's sake, PLEASE BE WHERE YOU SAY YOU WILL BE. 

There have been, no exaggeration, nearly a dozen times that I've skipped breakfast at home because I wanted to grab something at the truck on Goodwin, only to find they are inexplicably NOT THERE. 

They rarely update their website or facebook or twitter with this incredibly useful information, either. It's extremely disappointing."}
{"text":"It was ok. A little salty but not bad :)
Potato is very soft and just a little dry. It would be perfect if this roll could be more juicy :)"}
{"text":"Best spot for a breakfast sandwich in Champaign, no doubt. Morning bender with bacon is always my go to. Restaurant or one of the trucks, it's always the best!"}
{"text":"Fantastic breakfast spot. I have been coming here for years and every time it exceeds my expectations. Not only has great food but great service as well. This is a must go to spot for anyone looking for breakfast or breakfast after dark!"}
{"text":"Best Food Truck in Champaign/Urbana! I frequently go to Cracked in the morning on my way to work. I've tried a couple things on the menu. The Morning Bender, a mixture of hash browns, egg, cream cheese, and cheddar cheese, is simply amazing, especially with some Sriracha hot sauce. I've also tried their Vegasm, which is also pretty delicious with the spicy chipotle sauce. Honestly, the baguette bread from Pekara is what seals the deal with all of these sandwiches. It is probably more than one would like to spend on breakfast from a food truck but the sandwiches are delicious, filling, and worthwhile."}
{"text":"Woke up early on a Saturday morning just to try the truck with my roomie at the Farmer's Market. Let's just say the Vegasm is just that. Those sun-dried tomatoes, pesto...all of it was enough to make a girl swoon and then some. The line looked super intimidating, but I'd say we had our food in around 5 minutes. Prompt, piping hot and delicious. Did I mention they take card? 

My only complaint is that they cater mostly to the Engineering Quad. I see the truck parked at Wright and Green like clock work, but it's mostly by this remote street way into computer science land. Not terrible, but why can't you give the humanities some love? Or the South Quad? Just a suggestion."}

I have never been so eggcited to talk about breakfast! This clean,  convenient food truck was amazing!   Each of the items were made with a real flavor esthetic.. My favorite by far were the crispy parm truffle tots! Too bad we live so far away! 

The staff was friendly, engaging and knowledgeable.  Our food was prepared fresh and fast! Five stars for Cracked!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here for a quick morning bite to eat.  The menu is simple but the right amount of options for a morning meal.   I got a breakfast sandwich and my wife got a breakfast burrito.   

Both came out quickly, were well made and most importantly they tased good and hot the spot.   

The only downside is I though $18 for two breakfast sandwiches and two drinks is a bit pricy."}
{"text":"I've been going to cracked since it was just a truck! Now it has its own store front and I couldn't be happier. It's one of my favorite places to go on a weekend and the staff is always very friendly and ready to offer suggestions"}
{"text":"Very disappointed in this place. I am currently on a vegetarian diet and ordered a sandwich without meat. I was looking at the sandwich maker and noticed he rarely changed gloves. He would be touching meat for one sandwich and then make the next few sandwiches without changing gloves. I'm pretty sure my sandwich was contaminated with meat oil and juices and this is unacceptable to me. 

After getting my sandwich, I wanted to quickly sit down and eat it before class but there was no seats available. I know this place also has food trucks, but this is a restaurant. If they do not want to provide sufficient chairs and tables in this spacious place, they should just stay as food trucks. The ordering system is also very messy with multiple steps. I would never come back to this place especially with the taste of the food being only average."}
{"text":"we stopped by the truck at the lincoln square mall farmers market on saturday. per their website they operate on green street during weekends at bar time and on campus m-f breakfast/lunch hours. sloppy jose + plan b is what we ordered and both were great. sloppy jose sandwich had a chorizo patty which was unique. plan b was a spinach wrap with really sharp cheese. because the cheese and hummus were so flavorful it took over the sun dried tomato aspect of it a little but still great. beignets were topped with honey and powdered sugar - which we shared. the hash browns looked great but we did not have room to eat any. i ordered coffee which was fine. fast and friendly service + great food = success. writing this entry is making me hungry."}
{"text":"Not enough flavor for me but it seems to be popular with students. Prices are average for campus."}
{"text":"Really amazing food. Great breakfast sandwiches prepared well and creative mixes of ingredients. Unique food you won't find anywhere else and at a price that'll ensure you keep coming back.
I'd been looking to try Cracked for a long time and was thrilled to finally get the chance the other week. Looking forward to trying Cracked again next time I'm in Champaign."}
{"text":"Ordered a sandwich on a baguette. Got the sandwich, seemed like it was the wrong size/shape, so I double checked that it was on a baguette. I was told yes. Walked back to my office and found it was a soft doughy round roll. So either their definition of a baguette is way off or they messed up my order.

Also, there's a minimum for credit cards. The first time I tried to come here, they didn't have guac or baguettes left, so I tried to get just a side -- but I didn't have cash and they said the order was below their credit card limit. So even though the fillings were pretty alright and it's only a block away, between the payment issues and the bread issues, I won't be back."}
{"text":"Cracked has the best food on campus. 5 bucks for the best breakfast burrito you've ever had."}
{"text":"Food is really good n the price is relatively cheap. The breakfast wrap and tater tots are my go-to order. It's pretty full at night, but definitely go there if you're craving for breakfast food."}
{"text":"I would give this mobile restaurant five stars..and believe I still want to..but I waited at the farmer's market for about 30 min. for my vegasim and came home with a sunburn..love the graphics on the truck and the whole concept and my sixteen year old can run down their location on his phone.  What is not to love when I heard they serve a fried egg on just about everything....I'm in"}
{"text":"Easily the best food truck in town. I've been here countless times and have probably had just about everything on the menu and, SPOILER ALERT, it's all AMAZING.
Seriously though, you can't go wrong with anything you get here. They use fresh ingredients, bread from a local bakery and it really shows with how good everything tastes. Out of everything I've tried, my favorite is the Goy Vey with cheese. I'm craving one right now just thinking about it. 
It's one of those places where every time I see it, I have to stop. It's simply too good to pass up. Cracked is definitely one of the gems of C-U. I'm hooked!"}
{"text":"Torally legit breakfast!! If your in champagne hit this place up. It's crazy good. Staff is awesome and the food is fresh."}
{"text":"Still waiting, honestly overpriced. Its abunch of precooked or food substitutes. You're not getting your money's worth"}
{"text":"For the past few months, I've come to the conclusion that Champaign-Urbana has some sort of obsession with hockey-puck like bread.   It's hard, dense and a chalkenge to eat.  Cracked serves these buns.... The Butcher Shop serves these buns, Prairie Fruits creamery serves these buns during their pop-up dinners.  ENOUGH!  I want a soft squishy bun that compliments the contents of your sandwich.  i want the bun to slop up the juiciness of the meat, cheese or egg....or whatever condiment you put on it.m The bread is not supposed to be a challenge to eat... The hardness/thickness/denseness allows the 'in-between stuff' to start tectonic shift/slide between the union of bread and meat....trust me, if i'm not the only one in the restaurant, there are a lot of other people (adults AND kids) who just eat the filling and leave the bun for garbage.  YOU NEED a soft squishy bun!!!  (Like Black Dog!!)  Stop with the stale hockey puck like bread!!  Just because you source from local places doesn't mean it's good.  You have a good thing going Cracked.... But get a soft squishy bun!  Please and Thank you."}
{"text":"Fast, cheap, delicious, fresh. Plus they offered their services for a local fundraiser to help a little boy who has leukemia. Amazing."}
{"text":"Hands down the best food truck at University of Illinois!

Amazingly. Cracked's unique menu is perfect for breakfast/lunch and late night drunk food. I love it because it's filling, my girlfriend loves it because it's healthy, but we both agree that everything they offer is absolutely delicious. From the specialty ingredients, spreads, and sodas to the friendly staff and low prices, it's hard to justify not eating here.

Try it if you haven't already!"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING! Great food for a great price. My go-to is morning bender with bacon and sloppy tots. Words cannot explain how delicious this combo is. Plus, the owner is awesome and everyone is super friendly. Be sure to come here for delicious breakfast food and great, fast service."}
{"text":"I find all the comments complaining about the price quite interesting. The most expensive item on the menu is the sloppy jose sandwich which cost 7 bucks(including tax). It is by far my favorite sandwich at Cracked. It comes with a fried egg, hash-brown, Guac, chorizo with bacon onion jam. How is a gourmet sandwich with tons of awesome ingredients expensive at a price of 7 is beyond my understanding. Even a regular bagel sandwich at Panera or Einstein bagel is going to cost you 5,6 bucks before tax. Anyway, I just wanna say that I love this place and it is perfect for lunch while studying at Grainger library. I'm gonna miss this place when I graduate."}
{"text":"This breakfast stop is a great place to go whether it's breakfast time or not. There was still a line around 1:00 to get food and we ordered the morning bender, sloppy tots, and French toast bites. The morning bender is a quality sandwich and Cracked's decision to put cream cheese on it wasn't a choice I thought I liked but after trying it I can say I'm a fan. The tater tots are also delicious and they do a great job of packing everything to go so you don't have to worry about spillage or anything. The French toast bites were the best part of the meal, slightly crispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside, and a nice cinnamon sugar taste. It's a great way to experience college eating again! Menu items are also creatively and humorously named, like the plan b wrap."}
{"text":"Tad disappointed. The Morning Blender sounded interesting. Everything inside turned out cold, inside the toasted bun. Coffee was meh. All this for a 9$ breakfast. Will try once more, before giving up."}
{"text":"The restaurant is a terrific addition to the food trucks. I can still get my favorite Hungry Chief but the grilled cheese sandwiches are a great addition and change of pace. Love the Sweet Cheesus! The homemade horchata is awesome. The place is bright and fun, service fast and good."}
{"text":"Service was quick and friendly. Decided to go here after craving breakfast food, which I usually don't go out of my way to get. Got their white cheddar bacon tots and chorizo burrito. Would definitely recommend again for any food lover. Pricing was reasonable and the taste was well blended."}
{"text":"Cracked was one of my favorite food trucks in college, so I had to try out the brick and mortar restaurant once they opened up shop on Green Street when I visited Champaign for graduation!

First of all, thumbs up for the food!!...
The Morning Bender is probably my favorite breakfast sandwich in the entire world, and I will probably always feel that way. The ratio of all ingredients in this sandwich is pure perfection. It takes your average breakfast ingredients and transforms them into a masterpiece.

I'm no chef, but if you're going to reinvent the wheel with something as great as the basic tater tot, truffle oil is the way to do it. The parmesan truffle tots are so great. Life is short. Pair your sandwich with the parmesan truffle tots! You will not regret it.

The service, on the other hand, was not so hot! I was really disappointed. The service at the food truck was much better. Our truffle tots were sitting out for 10-15 minutes before I had to go up to the counter and ask if they were mine. The sandwiches took an absurd amount of time to make, and the employees did not seem to care about any of it. They were on their own schedules. Very frustrating!"}
{"text":"The iconic yellow food truck that I always pass by on the way to Siebel. A great place to grab a quick bite to eat between classes. Food takes just a few minutes to get ready, and is absolutely delicious. The Morning Bender and Hungry Chief are great. I wanna try the whole menu!"}
{"text":"I ordered a hungry chief and liked it. People were friendly and price is in the cheap side. Miami people here recommend morning bend and I sure want to try it out next time."}
{"text":"My sister and I were in town for a funeral:( We wanted something yummy and fast do we Yelped breakfast and the number 1 spot was Cracked so we headed over with our aunt and uncle. I had the doctor Seuss with no meat and a cold brew. Both were super yummy and filling. Thank you for a perfect send off."}
{"text":"Really wish this place was a sit down restaurant, other than that it is delicious! Very good food if you are looking for a quick bite."}
{"text":"I came here for breakfast with a friend. I ordered the chicken wrap. I thought the cheese would be sliced or sprinkled but instead it was more liquid like a sauce. Overall, a bit bland."}
{"text":"Every bite of a morning bender is a spiritual experience. It doesn't matter when I get one, be it 9 am, 2 pm, or after midnight, the cracked truck does not disappoint. I could actually live on these sandwiches and look forward to seeing this radical food truck at the Urbana farmers market starting next Sunday!"}
{"text":"I loved the Sloppy Jose and the white cheddar bacon tots were sublime. The Hungry Chef is good too but mine came with all the sour cream and guac at the very end of the burrito - hoping that was the exception to the rule. Regardless, I'm a big fan of both the restaurant and the truck."}
{"text":"I really like the food here, but they need a different system for calling completed orders. On two separate occasions in a row they had finished my sandwich but someone either jumped the line because they had ordered the same thing and picked up the sandwich, or they somehow lost my order. It is a food truck...how is it lost? Why not replace the current system with order numbers? This is extremely simple to implement and then there is no confusion about whether your order is up or not."}
{"text":"Used to be amazing and then they changed the buns which are absolute garbage highly disappointed I miss the baguette buns"}
{"text":"I was lucky enough to eat at the Cracked truck in the Food truck Oasis at bonnaroo.

 There are few things I like more in this world than a perfectly cooked egg and I know I'm gonna love a truck that makes this humble food their star ingredient. I did what I had to do and ordered the Goy Vey (bacon, hard salami, hash brown and a fried egg with sweet and spicy cream cheese on a ciabatta roll). This was glorious and for sure the best breakfast-for-dinner I've had in a long time. The sweet and spicy cream cheese made this not your regular run of the mill breakfast sandwich. The only downfall was the hash brown was fairly thin and hard to discern amongst all that fluffy bread."}
{"text":"Very good breakfast sandwich. I tried the sloppy Jose sandwich with chorizo, and it was very flavor and good! Taste it while it is hot! The bread was also good, the meat was a little bit salty but it didn't bother me (since I love strong flavors). I wanna try all of their sandwiches if I have time!"}
{"text":"I had this late night after drinking at the U of I. Don't know how much that factored in for my love of the food but wow was that awesome. Really tasty tots."}
{"text":"Holy moly!  The best breakfast sandwich I think I have EVER had!  Seriously.  This seemed almost like a new invention entirely.  Putting a crunchy hash-brown cake on an egg and cheese sandwich with pesto!?! Of course that is delicious.  They had several different versions to choose from and I am certain that all of them would have been amazing.  They all were served on a nice artisan roll and came out piping hot...as a breakfast sandwich should.  I wanted to eat this every day while I was at Bonnaroo. 
I hope I get another chance with this truck.  I will be heartbroken if not."}
{"text":"Egg vide had been around for a while. Starting with the eggslut in LA, I had been a big fan of egg dish of all kinds, until I went cracked. You see, they are not bad, it just something you would also do back in home, no particular property really stands out, most importantly, Overpirced!"}
{"text":"The food is good. I regularly visit their food truck on Goodwin Ave and get the  Underdog, which is basically a hotdog with egg and grilled onions on top-- it's tasty. Today I went to the restaurant on Green street and ordered the Morning Bender, which is an egg and hash brown sandwich. It was also tasty. I loved the overall aesthetic of the restaurant, it has a very warm modern feel. Only think I disliked was that the lady at the cashier seemed so dead and unenthusiastic that it kinda spoiled the experience for me. Overall, good food and setting but employees could try to be happier."}
{"text":"Very fast service and amazing food!! My friends wanted to go get Jurassic but their service is very slow. So I bet them that I could go all the way to cracked, order, get my food, and bring it back before their food was ready. Sure enough, I was back at Jurassic with Cracked before my friends even got their food! I love their breakfast sandwiches as well as their tots with white cheddar and bacon."}
{"text":"I'm flippin OBSESSED with Cracked! The three sandwiches I've had so far are the Vegasm, Sloppy Jose, and Goy Vey and I can't decide which is my favorite! Their tater tots are also out of this world. They put regular tater tots to shame. Prices are decent and service is quick. The food is fresh and oh so flavorful!  You can find the truck parked in downtown Champaign on the weekends. My ritual after leaving the bars is to always get Cracked. Seriously, I can't walk by it and not get something. Oh, also they deliver!!"}
{"text":"Oh my lord this place is amazing. They have the absolute best breakfast burrito I've ever had in my life"}
{"text":"super tasty sandwiches, tots and coffee. anyone that serves chorizo has my business! quick and friendly service. good music while you wait. can't wait to go back soon!"}
{"text":"The new restaurant on green street is great. The vegasm is delicious as are the parm truffle tots. Can't wait for them to be open for later hours for some much needed drunk munchies. Same quality of food and price as the trucks!"}
{"text":"I see the Cracked truck everyday so one day I decided to \"treat myself\" by getting a vegasm sandwich with a side of parmesan truffle tots for lunch. Although I enjoyed it, I would not say that the food is out of this world but it is full of flavor and not at all what one would expect from a food truck. The grease level can be up there, and so can the price for such a small portion, but it is worth an occasional visit."}
{"text":"Early morning farmer's market or late night bite after the bar, Cracked sandwiches are great anytime of the day!  All the sandwiches are super tasty, but my favorites are the Goy Vey and the Vegasm with spicy chipotle. 

The regular tots are great, but I would pass on the sweet potato tots. 

Every time I see the Cracked Truck, I can't help but crack a smile."}
{"text":"WOAH. Perfect truck, perfect food, perfect crispy tater tots, perfect fluffiness, perfect pizzazzle--- just perfect everything. 

My family and I stumbled upon this majestic food truck while exploring the UIUC campus and were mysteriously enticed by the blissful smell of breakfast goodness. We just had come from lunch but just couldn't pass by this opportunity to try the food, so we only ordered large size tater tots to share amongst our family of 4. The people in the truck were quick and efficient, only taking about 3 minutes to do our order, while making nice small talk with us as the food was cooking.
Little did I know that when our order was finished, not only did the people sprinkle some extra tots in the bag for us, but gave us an EXTRA bag of tots as well. 

Like, \"WHAAA?\" Needless to say, we were overwhelmed with potato bliss and crispy goodness as we rushed home to pour them on a plate and Instagram our win. The tater tots hands down were goldenly beautiful, and as for the taste---- . Heart emojis all around. They taste like pieces of heaven sprinkled with dollops of fried godliness. We ate the two bags within 20 minutes, and are raving to get more the next time we see them cruising on campus."}
{"text":"I started going to Cracked since before it became a physical brick and mortar store like most students at UIUC. Always the most reliable when coming out of bars at night or even studying late night in Grainger. Cracked is always there. I usually get the Hungry Chief with guac inside. It's really filling and great drunk or sober food. There's also hash browns inside and it's basically a breakfast burrito with eggs too. Sometimes depending on the day I think the burrito is all very squishy and lacks texture, but it's comfort food and that's how comfort food is most of the time. I've also had their tots, a bit on the expensive side for just tots, but they're crispy and tasty!"}
{"text":"I used to love going to Cracked for their Vegasm sandwich and Sloppy Jose. However, they recently changed their buns to ones that are soft, soggy, and disgusting. Until they change their buns back, i won't be coming to Cracked."}
{"text":"Staff is always cheerful and gets your food done fast. Love the bread options for each sandwich, as well as their multitude of sides (Mmm. ..French toast bites). Cooked hot and fresh to order, so sometimes the line can get a bit long. Definitely check this truck out to start your morning or end your night with cheesy, savory, buttery, goodness."}
{"text":"Super good, but they were out of a lot of stuff when we visited. No nitro coffee, no white cheddar tots, no French toast bites, no broccoli cheddar soup.  Bummer. I'd say maybe next time, but I'm from out of town and not really planning to be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Finally got around to trying this much-hyped-about food truck after passing it almost everyday on Springfield and Matthews. I had the sloppy jose without cheese and it was pretty tasty, but I would recommend adding cheese because I think it was missing it. I do wish there was a little more guacamole on the sandwich, but otherwise it was quite good. I definitely plan to stop by again and try their other sandwiches and tots."}
{"text":"We love having breakfast at Cracked during farmer's market season. The sandwiches are great and the kids cannot resist the tots."}
{"text":"I've been back to Cracked several times since the start of the semester. It's typically our go-to spot after the bars and I've managed to try almost everything.

I really liked the hungry chief wrap and the sloppy jose. Very hearty and filling sandwiches perfect after a night of drinking.

I thought the plan B wrap was meh, not as tasty as the other items in my opinion. 

Typically speedy  service with nice people working the trucks even at 2am with many a drunk customer. 

My only qualms is that Cracked can get expensive. Some of the sandwiches are $6-7 alone, and if you decide to get any tots or a drink, things can amount to $10 quickly."}
{"text":"Loved the hungry chief and the homemade horchata. A generous helping of French toast too!  Will visit again!"}
{"text":"Terrific egg sandwiches on campus (and at the farmer's market, as well).  I'd give them 5 stars but I think they need to add a bit more sauce/liquid to most of their sandwiches, as they can be on the dry side.  Other than that, great sandwich combinations!"}
{"text":"Ate off of their truck Saturday at the ACES Library. Wow, the sandwiches were terrific and the guys were very nice. We tried a couple of the sandwiches and both were great. Find these guys and give their food a try you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Hands down, the BEST food truck in town. I love that they source a lot of local ingredients. I'm trying to think of my favorite thing but I've come to the conclusion that everything is good here! The long lines at the Farmer's Market are evidence of this. Check their website for their weekly schedule!"}
{"text":"The best breakfast sandwich I've ever had and the truffle Parmesan tater tots are to die for!  Worth the \"scramble\" to find where they are parked! The only complaint is they don't answer the phone!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a late breakfast in the middle of a road trip and it was well worth it.  I had the Goy Vey Sandwich the the French Toast Bites (Amazing).  Family said the Parmesan Truffle Tator Tots were the best they have ever head.  Staff was very friendly and gave good suggestions.  Will stop in for our next visit through town!"}
{"text":"This is some of my favorite food on campus! I usually go for the classic Morning Bender, but the Sloppy Jose is fantastic and would highly recommend both sandwiches. I recently tried the Sloppy Tots and those were great too! Although it is nice that the brick and mortar location has more hours and is always there, I love going to the truck because The Truck Came First. I think the truck adds to the experience and makes getting Cracked more fun. Overall a great business, everyone should try it before they graduate!"}
{"text":"I enjoy a good and heavy breakfast. I avoid meat in breakfast but love eggs, potato and veggies. So, when first I saw cracked at farmers' market last year, I was happy to have one more option for breakfast in Champaign. I love this food truck. They have lots of options for breakfast. I love their vegasm sandwich. It's so good, it has hash brown, eggs, sound dried tomato, garlic basil pesto, cheese... Yum. I have tried their plan B wrap, it was ok but I like sandwiches more.
Whenever I go to farmers' market, this is my go to place for breakfast."}
{"text":"The Goy Vey Sandwich plus jam is the perfect balance of savory and sweet. Cracked offers a great selection of breakfast food that is unmatched in the Champaign Urbana area. The staff has always been friendly and has offered great recommendations."}
{"text":"Great choices and delicious!  I usually stop here when I'm at the farmer's market"}
{"text":"Great fast casual breakfast spot right on campus. Started by two U of I students so it's a nice story and authentic.

I ordered the Goy Vey sandwich which comes on a roll with salami, bacon, egg, cream cheese. It was a really solid sandwich. I also got the white cheddar bacon tots which were great and came with a big portion. They were a little salty, and I would say you could split them with someone and then maybe get two flavors."}
{"text":"Ingredients taste fresh, taters are delicious. Unfortunately, the price doesn't match what you get. This is true in terms of portion size and recipe complexity. Maybe I'm just a picky hippo."}
