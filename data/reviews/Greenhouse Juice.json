{"text":"Love their juice!  Some of the best and their almond milk and brazil nut milk are two of the best nut milks in the city."}
{"text":"I'm really torn on this one. As far as product, I'm thrilled to have a high-quality juice spot in Toronto. I've been a loyal customer at Greenhouse since it's opening at the beginning of the year and have been many times since then. I have done a juice cleanse (this was before they offered cleanse packages so it was just a really large order) and have recommended Greenhouse to many people when it was still new. Since then, it has had an almost stratospheric rise to popularity. Many reviews speak of positive service but only one time was I treated in a friendly manner, or offered help when deciding. Other times I was talked to quite coldly and served in a rush. When i was doing the juice cleanse, I went in to pick up a $200+ order on the same day they were sampling their new summer juices and I was simply given my bags and they turned to the next customer without confirming the order (there was a mistake in it I realized after getting home) or offering a sample. I thought it was just me, but my mother went in to return bottles (return 10 and get 1 250ml drink free) and she was treated rudely by whomever was there at the time, saying if she didn't have an account with greenhouse she wouldn't be able to take in the bottles and receive the free drink.

I understand business is busy and tried for a long time to ignore these occurrences because everything about the product is perfect (well, except the price... I mean, $18 for a juice is a little steep) but the cold service was not an isolated happening for me. Most people have had great service so maybe I was just unlucky but for that reason I deducted two stars. Other than that, their juice flavours are extensive (my favourites are the giver, wake up, and the chocolate almond milk) and the packaging is cute. The little barn on Macpherson is a perfect place for a juice bar. The ingredients are all organic and local when possible, and they use a Norwalk juicer, which is top of the line. I love cold pressed juice and greenhouse has the best quality juice that I've tried in Toronto. I recommend it to many of my friends, and if not for the lacking service I've experienced and some issues with pricing, this would be a five star review.

Tip: Juice cleanse packages have been rising in price, but if you're on a budget I would recommend buying 4 500ml juices and making two 'waters' on your own rather than purchasing them as part of the package. Master cleanse water is not worth $7 and chia water is very easy to make as well. I'd buy 3 green juices of your choice, one fruit juice like gold rush or wake up, then make two waters. For more calories, you could buy a 500ml almond milk and split it between two days, or just add a 500ml almond milk each day. Just an alternative, I know sometimes it's hard to get through 6 juices a day, especially on weekends if you wake up a bit late."}
{"text":"Highly recommend this juicery. At Greenhouse, you will be treated to delicious juice combos that also happen to be therapeutic. My favorite juices include Deep Roots, a beet-based combo, and The Giver which blends a bunch of different greens. As a naturopathic doctor, I am always looking for the best resources to help my clients get healthy. Greenhouse is such a resource. They also offer home delivery for their cleanse programs."}
{"text":"Love, love, love this juice! The beat juice + grape/celery/lime are our favorites...but they're all great. The women that I've met are so knowledgeable and passionate about the juice, great experience."}
{"text":"Had some smoothies this morning (the ingredients are pre-packaged for easily assembly - not something I was expecting to learn), and they were out of vegetables to add to the smoothies.

Of the fresh made smoothies, one had an overwhelming amount of ginger that overpowered all the other ingredients and was unpleasant to drink. Threw that one out. 

The other, which was was almond milk/cocoa/datey was much better tasting but there was some hard sediment in it which you couldn't bite through and had to spit out. 

Overall, I wont be going back...but then again I'm not the kind of person who thinks it is wise to spend $69 per day on juice cleanses (actual retail price!). They do make really great accessories for Instagram pictures, though! Bon appetit !!"}
{"text":"luxurious and clean.

adjectives for both the juices and the space. 

cold brew infusions, greens galore - there's no shortage of flavours to try.

you're going to complain about the $$$ aren't you. of course, because this world likes to offer you fake food for less. 

when you pay more HERE you get the quality and supportive nutrition you need for your life. 

spend more on brain fuel and save on medical bills later. and maybe even achieve your goals- who knows what the magic of fruit and veggies could have in your ability to focus and thrive. (duh)."}
{"text":"Update:  GH privately contacted me to inquire more information about what could be improved.  Stellar customer service.  Greenhouse makes a positive shopping experience. Spending money is a big deal for everyone these days, them going this extra distance really sets them apart.  

The new Brazil mylk is literally the bomb. No matter if that phrase is over or not, it took the industry and obliterated it. Nothing else mylk matters. I want to be the face on their carton with the mylk mustache."}
{"text":"The good: The juice is tasty.  I prefer it over what I endearingly call \"mall juice\". You know, the kind where they put oranges or other fruits plus protein into a machine and blend it? I like that stuff too, but cold-press is much nicer.  No pulp, just smooth, fresh fruits and veggies sometimes pleasantly spiked with a pinch of sea salt or spice like liquid cayenne or the gut-warming ginger. 

My favourites are:
- Wake Up, a zingy citrus with liquid cayenne. I like to pretend that the spicy feeling in my tummy is burning up the fat. Aw yiss, c'mon supermodel abs!  
- Gold Rush, the best-selling pineapple mix which tastes just like a \"regular\" juice which you'd actually drink purely for taste

The not-so good: I don't believe in the health miracles that some juicers do, so I drink this stuff just because I enjoy the taste and it's nice to have a cold drink as a refresher.  

Speaking of health, omigherd - the financial cost of being addicted to cigarettes would be cheaper than an addiction to this place.  A small, 250ml glass of juice will set you back about $8, whereas a large 500ml costs $11. 

If you bring back 10 bottles, you will receive one small bottle of juice for free. To be perfectly honest,  it's a rather high cost for very little return for the consumer: each bottle costs roughly $2 to purchase, and with each return the costs for Greenhouse diminishes.  These puppies are heavy as heck though, and unless you're essentially right in the same building, it's a literal burden to carry. Your reward for your collection is a measly $8 bottle. Basically, as a customer you're paying ~$90 for a return of an $8 juice.

If the returns system fell a bit more on the side of the consumer, I'd probably visit a bit more often.  For now though, Greenhouse Juice is an occasional juicy treat for me."}
{"text":"Want FRESH juice where you can taste all the goodness? Greenhouse is place to go. 

Greenhouse juice popped up not too long ago in the path, making it very accessible for a lot of the people working in the financial district.


The decor is fresh, unique and fun. It mimics the actual look of a green house with bright lights, wooden counters and very little furniture. The decor definitely showcases the variety of juices they have. They don't even have a cash register. They use the iPad system to cash you out. All very clean and sleek.


The staff is very friendly and informative and definitely have knowledge on their product. I would definitely go at a less busy time because there is a sampling station where you can try any juice before you buy. When it gets busy, it's hard to sample because there is only one person helping you. 

The juice itself is pretty amazing. There are some that are tough to drink because they are from more peculiar ingredients but you can definitely taste the freshness as soon as you take the first sip. Everything here is cold pressed so all of the juicing retains the nutrients that blenders will lose.

The only thing that makes me second guess my purchase is definitely the price as it is very premium. Depending on which one you choose, the 250ml ranges from $5.00 to $7.00 and the one 500ml is about $10.00 to $13.00. Its definitely worth the splurge but not on a daily basis. 

Great juice, cute packaging. Can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"I was in Toronto for two days and dropped by because I wanted to do a cleanse. I travel for work and with all the junk I've been eating, my body is all sorts of toxic right now. Anyhoo... I did some Yelping and I came across Greenhouse Juice.  Cold-pressed, organic, AND made daily in Toronto? Yes, please! I can't tell you how happy I was with my decision and how lovely the store attendant was. She was so patient and helped me pick the cleanse that was best for me. I really appreciated her thoroughness. Needless to say, I can't recommend this place enough. Yes, it's pricey, but quality is everything, especially when it comes to juicing! This is the type of quality (and customer service) I'm willing to pay for."}
{"text":"I'm new to this Cold-Pressed Juice concept so I asked A LOT of questions. The staff was able to answer everything and they let me try as many juices as I asked for. I ended up getting a large Almond Milk and it was outstanding. I tired to take my time finishing but I couldn't. 

Good things to put in your body are not cheap. A quality product needs quality resources.

If you're in Yonge and Summerhill/Rosedale area, check them out!!!"}
{"text":"Update: 
I had Emma reach out to me directly via Yelp apologizing for the cold-shouldered service I had received on a previous visit. Just like to say my most recent visit at the Briar Hill location was significantly better. The girl who was running the store at the time was pleasant, friendly and had the right amount of enthusiasm (knowledgeable but not pushy by any means). I will definitely be back as its only a few blocks from my work and I do love a good green juice on days I'm feeling sluggish (or need to reboot after a cheat day). 

Happy to see the owners/managers are making the effort to ensure the quality of their customer service is as high as their products. Can't wait to see what new juices they have in store come summertime!"}
{"text":"I bought the Wake Up juice and it was delicious but the price was expensive for the mL. Not sure if it's something I'd buy again because of the guilt of spending that much on that little juice :("}
{"text":"I love juice but I never have time to juice my own.
Then, BAM, this place opened up. 
I'm so thankful that it did cause the juice is really good. Yes, its a bit pricey but the ingredients are organic and very fresh so in my opinion, it is worth it. Also, the juices are Cold-pressed which I believed has more nutrients. 
Overall, I love this place and it has became my go-to juice place. 

Tip: come early, cause a lot of the large size juices always runs out in the afternoon."}
{"text":"Tried their juices at Commerce Court West and love them. Placed an order for delivery last night at 11 pm and they delivered before 9 am to my house in Mississauga. That is epitome of efficiency. Any grocery gateway or larger grocer would say its past their deadline for next day delivery.  I wish this company the very best and hope they add more types of juices to their selection."}
{"text":"I first discovered GHJ on Instagram and finally had a chance to stop in. Everyone there is knowledgeable and happy to answer any questions you may have. You can taste test all of the delicious juices. I bought bottles of wake up, almond milk, pink milk, and green milk. Will be back ASAP for more!"}
{"text":"Super pricey but such a nice treat.

I really like the packaging of the bottles (each one has the name of the drink and associated benefits--such as liver cleansing). They are meant to be kept at home or returned to the store--and if you bring back 10, you get a free drink and free yoga class at one of their affiliated companies.

Don't try the Rococoa smoothie unless you're willing to shell out $12/day (sometimes twice a day!) to feed your addiction. If you do end up trying it, ask them to substitute the almond milk with brazil nut milk! It tastes better, and is a thoughtful thing to do considering the drought in California, where 80% of the world's almonds are grown. It takes 1.1 gallons of water just to grow one almond. Very Berry is too sweet for some, including me."}
{"text":"I work next door, and usually run over in my work apron during my break or before my shift. Trust me, as someone who despises winter, getting me to run over in my work t-shirt when it's snowing is no easy feat.

Yes, yes, it's expensive. But if you want to take the time to go out and buy a cold juice press, then buy all the individual ingredients, AND take the time to juice it yourself, go right ahead. I'll trade a trip to Starbucks for a $12 healthy juice ANY day. 

Bonus points:
- Their staff is incredibly knowledgeable and friendly
- For the people who complain that they sell out easily: If you call in advance, they're more than happy to put juice aside for you!
- They offer various cleansing plans"}
{"text":"I've been doing the juice cleanses, gentle and then standard, for 2 days now. I had 2 juices left over from the first cleanse, and 1 juice left over from the second day. I've done juice cleanses before - from total cleanse. This is my comparison: 

I won't go into too much detail about Total cleanse as this is a review page for Greenhouse. 

Total cleanse is less expensive, however, the juices were not as \"filling.\" I found myself more light headed on their cleanse. In addition, they use plastic bottles and when I did their cleanse, they did not have a bottle return program. 

I found the juices at Greenhouse to be more substantial and \"filling.\" I liked that they had a \"best before\" date stamp at the bottom of the bottles. The glass bottles were not only attractive to look at (admit it, we all 'eat', ahem, \"juice\" with our eyes), and they had a bottle return program. I liked how I didn't have to \"commit\" to the cleanse - i.e. you can order online the night before and have it delivered the next day. I'm lucky enough to live very close to The Detox Market and was able to pick up the juices on the day of if I felt like I wanted to continue my cleanse. Which was exactly what I did. After my first day on the gentle cleanse, I woke up feeling pretty good, so I decided to give it one more go. I gave The Detox Market a call, let them know that i was going to pick up a cleanse that day, and when i arrived, it was waiting for me. Perfect. One caveat: The Detox Market only carries limited quantities of each - so I was lucky they had 1 500ml Almond Milk left for the cleanse (you can always substitute with brazil nut milk etc.). Because of the left over juices I had (like i said, the juices felt substantial so I didn't end up finishing all of them) I decided to \"craft\" my own cleanse today. I picked up an additional 3 juices this morning at The Detox market. If you haven't tried a juice cleanse, and CAN afford it, cause it IS quite pricey, I would recommend Greenhouse Juice Co."}
{"text":"I can't believe I spent almost $10.00 on a small bottle of juice ($9.61, to be exact). And I liked it. 

Located in the heart of the Commerce Court food court (which is also nearby King subway station), I've walked past this place many times and scoffed at the prices (like, no way would I spend that much on juice!). But today, I decided to give it a shot. I walked in and was immediately greeted by sweet, friendly service, who were ready to answer any of your questions. The refrigerated shelves were neatly stacked with two sizes of juices: 250 ml and 500 ml, and had a variety to choose from. Raw, 100% organic, cold-pressed, the bottles also indicate various benefits: energizing, skin purifying, helps your digestive system, etc.

I went with 'The Good' containing romaine, spinach, cucumber, celery, lemon, and Himalayan salt. The 250 ml bottle was literally, and barely, the size of my hand, and claimed to have the following benefits: detoxifying, anti-oxiding, skin purifying, and energizing.

I was told that the drink isn't meant to be a meal replacement but as a light snack or a drink on the side of a small meal. I had it as a snack during the day and found 'The Good' to be pretty sour, but it felt and tasted very cold and refreshing. The flavour ended up growing on me and by the end, I didn't mind it at all.

Overall, it was good. And if I had a juice money fund set up, I wouldn't mind coming here and blowing it all on their juices. But despite how refreshing and tasty, this is something I would only get once in awhile because of the price - for that price, I'd rather get a meal instead. Not bad for a 'once in awhile' snack or drink though."}
{"text":"To echo an earlier review - Yes, this place is expensive!

$8-$11 for the smallest-sized bottle is a hefty price to pay but I guess they are located in the right area for clientele than can afford it - regularly.

The advantage I'm giving right now is that they are very generous with the samples. I guess being a new store and wanting to drum up business, they want to create a positive customer experience so samples will help... especially when you aren't sure where to spend your $10.

During my first visit, I sampled a shot of just about everything on the menu. The menu also states the ingredient list in each drink. From a nutrition or even allergy perspective, you know what you're consuming.  They drink also tells you how it can help you (i.e. energy, digestion, antioxidants, etc). From a DIY perspective, you can probably try to make it at home with your own juicer given that you know what to put in it.

What sets this place apart and may still get some DIY juicers into the store is the almond milk drinks which they make in-house. I'm not too familiar with almond milk but I can see what nutritional benefits it can bring.

** TIP - They do have a bottle recycle program.  Every time you finish your bottle, bring it back.  They keep track of your returns.  Once you return your 10th bottle, your next 250ml bottle is free and you get a free yoga class at a nearby studio. For someone like me, the savings could add up... just might take me 10 weeks to get to that free bottle."}
{"text":"Purchased two bottles:

Rabbit, run: Got to sample this one before purchasing. Has a very strong ginger flavour to it! Can't really taste the apple & carrot flavour but the colour certainly shows that it's part of the ingredients haha

Almond milk: I'll buy this one again - I wasn't expecting the texture to be that chunky but I like it nonetheless :)"}
{"text":"I absolutely love the juices here! Your paying quite a bit, but it's worth it! And the prices are reasonable considering the healthy stuff that's in the juices. The staff were ok, not overly friendly but welcoming and would answer my many questions, they weren't pushy and some of them were knowledgeable on the product. I'm always happy with the juices i get the cold pressed apple juice, wake up, deep roots, and the reward program is great too when you return empty bottles you get a free juice"}
{"text":"After some time, I've learned to appreciate this place a bit more. While I still think the points from my previous review are applicable, I find the value here much better than other juicing places. LIVE Food bar's juices are sold in stores around the PATH for not much less than here, and they aren't paying the cost of renting their own unit. On top of that, Greenhouse actually gives you a pretty good quality glass bottle, whereas LIVE's are plastic. The glass bottle, if you were to get it yourself, would probably cost you a pretty dollar or two. There's also another place in the path called Belmonte Raw and their juices are even pricier than Greenhouse's.

So if cold-pressed, organic juice is your thing, then Greenhouse is a good spot to pick it up at."}
{"text":"Finally stopped at this super quaint juice bar off of Yonge St on my jog this morning & I'm glad I did. Nice section of healthy juices are ready to go in awesome glass milk bottle I'm going to re-used as my water bottle!"}
{"text":"Just don't think about the price.  Just don't think about the price and you'll be fine.  I stopped in here this morning because it is, literally, around the corner.   The ginger shot was what O came for, having heard about this tiny shot of pure ginger juice.  Wow.  serious stuff.  Almost medicine or a supplement rather than \"food.\"  (I bought one to take home and will experiment with it in a cocktail, but that's another story...).  I also sampled \"Rabbit Run,\" \"Gold Rush,\" both  spectacular -- but as I said, DON'T THINK ABOUT THE PRICE.  Very fresh, creative, delicious.  Friendly staff too. But don't think about the price.  Yes, I will be back, but as a special treat every now and then."}
{"text":"Having Greenhouse Juice here reminds me of when I was in Los Angeles.  I say this because there is an inherent juicing trend there - especially when it's raw, organic, and vegan.   They also serve up a pretty delicious and creamy almond milk in a \"glass bottle.\"  YES!!!   I first discovered Almond Milk LA, and wished they had something like this in Toronto.   And it's finally here!!!

They also have some amazing boosters and juices.  My favorite is the chia seeds hydrator.  Their ginger boost is one amazing dose of spiciness.   Really hits the heart.  Love it!  I got there at 1pm, and they were sold out of some of their best sellers.   Gotta visit earlier next time.  

Being that it just opened, I am curious to see how they will develop.   Whether if they will start to develop a detox package for those that want to buy more than just a bottle.   I would be interested in something like a 5-day cleanse or more.  And also if they will have a delivery service.    

Until then,  I think Greenhouse Juice will be my weekly ritual for when I do my grocery shopping around the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"4.5 Stars 

VIBE 
Unfortunately, there's nowhere to sit here (until the picnic tables are ready outside) but the space is SO lovely and really represents their brand from the terraniums to the lighting in the shape of their logo. It's bright and sunny. Love it! You may run into a famous face here or there as this seems to be where the Rosedale set is going for their health fix. 

I DRANK 
It's all cold pressed juice so you're getting twice the nutrients you might get at other juice bars and yes, it's EXPENSIVE (the bottle deposit is included in the price) but worth it.  

The Gold Rush - pineapple, cucumber, lemon, ginger. I am a fan of all of these ingredients. It was gulped! 
Deep Roots - beet, carrot, apple, celery, lemon - again, a fan of all ingredients. Gulped again! 

I felt so much better after drinking these. You can get samples of anything on the menu and I'm excited to see what the food menu is going to taste like. 

OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK 
Happy to soak up the nutrients in this greenhouse any day.

{"text":"Greeenhouse recently opened its location in Commerce Court in Downtown Core.  Is their juice raw?  Is it organic?  And is it cold-pressed?  Greenhouse  would answer Yes, Yes and Yes!  Combine that with their approach to sourcing from small local suppliers, and you have a recipe for a premium product for health-conscious, price-insensitive customers.

The juices, nut milks and waters are all equally good, and extremely expensive.  Half a liter of the Rabbit, Run (carrot, ginger, apple) is almost $11.  Similar sized almond milk is $15!  My favorite is the Brazil nut milk, that has Brazil nuts (yes, those giant-sized nuts that are the scourge of every packet of trail mix) and also a hint of vanilla bean and salt.  Join their bottle return program and get a small drink free for every 10 bottles returned.  And if you are in the mood for their cleanse, they have three kinds, each comprising eight drinks, totaling $69--now that seems inexpensive compared to the individual drinks.

I will return to Greenhouse from time to time, especially when I am going through periods of penitence following pizza dinners and needless snacking.  Which is almost every day that I am in Toronto."}
{"text":"This place is cute, like a little house on a prairie except in the middle of the city. I would've given a better rating had the girl not given me my order in a takeout cup instead of a bottle (after paying $12 for it). Maybe she got confused that I would be enjoying it in store (all 500 mL?) because I was sitting down and waiting for my order. However, the staff was pretty friendly and welcoming and even gave us several samples since it was our first visit, which really helped otherwise we'd have no idea what 'Deep Roots' or 'Pink Milk' would taste like.

The juices tasted pretty fresh and their flavours are pretty unique; not something you would find at a grocery store, so if it's your first visit, make sure to sample first or stay with the 'safe' flavours like apple. They have a board that displays all the prices, flavours and ingredients so you can get an idea of how it'll taste like.

The Pink Milk and Rococa was pretty good, but be sure to finish the milks before the actual date on the bottom of the bottle - it does go bad immediately ON that date. My sister liked their Deep Roots but I actually found it to be slightly salty? Having said, I liked their Pink Milk, which kind of tasted like sweet milk with a hint of beet and maple syrup flavor. The Rococa was yummy with a lot of nutty flavor and could almost make for a breakfast/protein shake. There's some dates in it which gives it a slight bit of sourness, so it's not all chocolately and nutty. The Choco-Maca would be my alternative.

The shop on King St West is somewhat deceiving; it's actually limited to whatever they have in stock that day only. So if you go in late that day and they have like 3 bottles left, that's that. You'll have to go to the one on Yonge if you want 'fresh' ones.

The only downside I would say for this place is the price. Yes, it's 'organic' and yes you cant really find anything else out there like this place, but for the size they offer it is a bit pricey. Having said I'll visit again but would be a once in a while kinda thing."}
{"text":"These juices are not cheap!! but they are insanely delicious, and often encompass many benefits that'll make your body happy and healthy. I've been to many pressed juice spots and most of the time the juice is flavourless or tastes like liquid spinach or kale...not these! These taste vibrant, some spicy, some sweet, there is so much variety here. The staff is knowledgable and they have lots of samples to try it before you buy it! They also sell lots of plants and succulents in the shop which I thought was a great touch considering the name of the juice company."}
{"text":"This spot is where it's at in TO. The quality of the ingredients in the juices couldn't be any higher. The presentation is beautiful. The taste is perfect. 

A very inspiring creation -- keep it up!!"}
{"text":"My boss convinced me to do a 3 day \"Green Cleanse\" with her this week and we used Greenhouse Juice and their delivery program. 

The cost boggled my mind (basically it costs $70 per person per day). This includes daily delivery and about 8 juices per person. 

The Green Cleanse involves no sugar or sweetened juices, so nothing contained apple, etc, only veg. 

It wasn't quite as horrible as I thought, we received:

Clean Zing - Alkaline Water, lemon, liquid cayenne - basically a spicy lemony water to drink first thing in the morning.

\"The Good\" - a green juice containing celery, cucumber, kale and himalayan salt. This one was not bad, I'm not going to say it was delicious, but it was easy to sip and I could see myself enjoying one of these in the morning.

\"The Giver\" - another green juice containing celery, kale, rainbow chard, cucumber, ginger and some other stuff. We really struggled with this one. It was quite shuddery. 

\"Almond Milk Unsweetened\" - This one was my personal favourite, probably the only one containing significant calories, could be used as a meal supplement. It contained sprouted ground almonds and coconut oil. I actually found it quite delicious but two of our cleansing group literally could not stomach it. 

Chia Seed Hydrator - was a water mixed with chia seeds to be glugged down before bed. This one was ok. 

There were also two little booster shots, one called E3 booster and one called Raw Aloe booster. These were sort of like shooting tequila, you definitely need a chaser.

Overall it was quite interesting and the company is very professional. The juices were delivered each morning packed in boxes with ice packs. If you're rich and you want to try it, I say go for it!"}
{"text":"Nice juice station, provide good juice cleanse to detoxify ur body. They have many flavors to choose from."}
{"text":"I'm kind of torn about this place. I don't love it, but I don't hate it, and for some reason I just can't stop coming back despite how incredibly draining it is for my wallet. Maybe it's just the juice fad. I've been here a few times and made four purchases: 1) chia seed water, 2) east of eden (a green juice), 3) gold rush (pineapple juice based), and 4) pink milk (beets based). The chia seed water was refreshing, and I mostly decided to try it because it was supposed to be detoxifying. I didn't really feel very different afterwards though, and really I think it's just like glorified water which is like $5 (after tax) for a 250 mL bottle. East of Eden is one of their green juices, but probably the mildest/most pleasant tasting, what with the fruits in it (apples and whatnot) - it tastes the least like drinking straight vegetables/grass. It's actually pretty decent, and I will say that it for sure aids your digestion lol. A 250 mL bottle is like $9. The gold rush juice is quite delicious and refreshing with the pineapple juice, lemon and cucumber, and has a bit of a kick with the ginger. It's supposed to be restorative and good for digestion. The pink milk was probably the most interesting purchase - it's pink because of the beets and you can definitely taste them, but the taste is tempered down/sweetened by maple syrup and almond milk. Surprisingly delicious! This milk will set you back about $11 though, but is one of their most popular ones I think, I usually only find like one or two bottles in their fridge.

Things that I do really like about this place are: the friendly staff, who seem to know their stuff and can explain what each juice is supposed to do; the fact that they are environmentally conscious (for every 10 empty juice bottles you bring back you can get a free juice!); their process (cold pressed), which uses all natural and organic ingredients and also presses them in a certain way so that most of the nutrients aren't lost (supposedly); and that you can sample pretty much any of the juices before you buy. I tried two of the other green juices (forget their names) as well as wake up (good for mornings because it has QUITE a kick to it with the cayenne pepper, but it was too much for me.)

In the end, would I recommend it? Well, it's kind of a cool place to try out and maybe purchase an interesting/exotic juice or two. The two I enjoyed the most were Gold Rush (really refreshing) and the Pink Milk (unique and also sweet and tasty.) That being said, it's definitely a novelty/luxury to me... with prices ranging from $5-12 for a 250 mL bottle, it basically ends up replacing a meal, price-wise, and I do love my food.... but for some inexplicable reason I just can't stop myself from coming back to try more and more of their juices..."}
{"text":"I'm from Malibu, Ca.  where juice bars are on every block n corner. Came here after my studio Pilates workout because my friend suggested it. I have to say it was probably the worst smoothie I have ever tasted. Actually had to tell the girl to add some almond butter, dates, and spinach and reblend it. But the girl was nice enough to do it with a smile."}
