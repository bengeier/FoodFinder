{"text":"Terrible service!! We never saw our waitress after our order was placed. Someone else served our entree. My husbands bottle beer was warm! We both would have ordered another drink but never saw the waitress. When she finally showed up with our check she dropped it and left!! Never to come back. TERRIBLE service!!

{"text":"Cute and will be back. Closest thing I can get in the west valley to the feel of joy-ride downtown. Tacos were good but I can only recall the chicken Tinga having a great flavor that stood out. We ordered beers and will have to come back during happy hour to save a little $. :) Next time, cant wait to try the horchata ice cream. Our server was really friendly. We came at a normal time (around 5pm?) and she had told us not to rush on the bill but within 10 minutes, she checked on it twice and finally asked if we could just sign because her shift was ending. If we were a couple we would have paid right then but we were friends catching up and not sure if we wanted another drink. That felt a little rushed, but I've worked in the industry and \"get it\" that she needed to close out. Location is nice with ample parking. Did not have to wait for a table even though it looked about 70% full. Menu looked appealing and restaurant was very clean. Overall, they hit the spot and we will be back to try a few more things!"}
{"text":"Went here on 12/15/16  supposedly their grand opening but no signage to indicate that. We were seated promptly.  Wasn't busy, maybe 10-15 other people there in the restaurant and at the bar.  Order was taken promptly, but the waitress couldn't answer all of our questions about the food.  We each ordered 2 tacos, I had a side of papa's fritas (waitress didn't know that was french fries) and my friend had a side of black beans.  The black beans arrived first, then after about 5 min. the tacos came and then we had to make 3 requests about our papas fritas, we had finished everything else and we had to still wait for the fries.  There seemed to be an excess of employees there, but mostly congregating at the bar and talking among each other.  The food was good and prices reasonable.  I may give it one more chance just for that reason.  The staff definitely needs some customer service skills."}
{"text":"Best Street Tacos and Red Beer ever. They make their own Mix and let me buy it to take home and make my own Reds. We frequent this place. Super cool Decor, inside and outside seating and great bar area."}
{"text":"We have been to Revolu at least 5 times since it opened.  The food and atmosphere is great and I love that they have Pacifico on tap.  The only thing I would complain about is that we usually like to sit at the bar, but every time we do it seems very difficult to get the bartenders attention after we get our first round of drinks.  The last time, we both sat with empty beers for at least 5 minutes before we could get their attention.  Other than that, we love it!"}
{"text":"Wife and I had dinner here tonight. Let's break this down a few ways. 

FOOD:
Food was good. We ordered salsa tasting and taquitos to start. I had carne asada and al pastor tacos, she had Del Mar and a carnitas queso style taco. 

Salsa tasting was excellent, 4 salsas offered and 3 of them were on point. Fourth salsa, the red, was too hot for our liking and we didn't eat it after the first taste. This could have been called out, but we'll cover that in the service portion. That being said spicy is a matter of taste and can be impacted by a lot of things from batch to batch, so you may not have the same experience. 

Taquitos were well done as well, Chipotle crema was the right sauce, could use more. Chicken filling was good for chicken. 

Tacos followed a similar theme; we liked them, they were tasty, and well put together. They just weren't \"awesome\". I'm not sure what intangibles push food over the line, but these were missing something. They didn't have \"It\". 

We didn't care for the queso style taco it, it was dry and too much cheese if not eaten immediately. We would recommend a pass on that. 

All this being, long-windily said, we are planning a return visit to try more menu items. Guac and Elote seem of particular interest. 

SERVICE:
We sat at the bar and were not impressed at the service. The bartenders take the seats at the bar and pour for the restaurant, so they are busy, but we got much better service from the second bartender who would do a table touch from time to time than our actual server. 

When the salsa tasting was dropped the correct move is to explain each flavor, at the very least warn of the hot 4th option. This was missed, she just dropped and ran. We had a menu with us and know how to read, so it wasn't the biggest deal ever, but it would have been the appropriate thing to do. 

My wife ordered a drink and found it to be far too tangy, I did as well, and she didn't touch it. To be fair we did not raise an issue, but top quality service would have noticed the untouched product and asked questions and replaced the product to make the best experience possible. 

Am I nitpicking? I'll entertain that possibility, but if I'm deciding between 15-20% or more for a tip, it's the little details that make the difference. 

OVERALL:
It was....good. Service was passable, checking off all the must haves without being any sort of above or beyond. 
The tacos were...good. My wife found them too messy to put down so she ate faster than she would have wanted. The menu seemed a little basic, I would have like to have the chance to be a bit more adventurous. No pork belly tacos??

We will be back, to try more items, but aside from chips and salsa we won't repeat any of the dishes."}
{"text":"First experience:

Great atmosphere especially since it is nestled amongst a bunch of chain restaurants.

Service was friendly and efficient.

Guacamole was way overpriced and under delivered in flavor and portion size.  

Shrimp tacos were good but nothing special.

Might be worth a second try, but no overpriced Guacamole next time.

Hope the restaurant does well, but would probably drive towards Scottsdale for better Mexican food for my dollar in the future."}
{"text":"Barrio queen it is not. Food is bland and service is not at par with its ambience. .. for Mcdonald it would compare.. whaaa  So sad I miss 83rd grill:'("}
{"text":"Delicious food, great ambiance, very good beer/drink selection and fantastic wait staff. We tried several things and they were all amazing. Favorites were the brussel sprouts, street corn nachos, pork and shrimp tacos. Can't wait to come back and try more things."}
{"text":"Not impressed. 
The poor hostess was obvious lost. She told us it would be a 20 minute wait, and it ended up being more like 45 minutes. She was never standing by the door to great people; which really confused many guests. She forgot that there were other customers waiting at the bar, and forgot about 2 reservations that showed up after us. 
They eventually put a small table together for us that was located in the WORST spot! We were right next to the kitchen and bar, and my boyfriend was bumped multiple times by staff. 
The food was terrible. We ordered chips and salsa; and the chips were stale and the salsa had no flavor . We ordered  carne asada, pork, chicken, and fish tacos. The carne asada was chewing, and the pork was dry and had NO flavor. The chicken and fish were decent; but not good enough for an hour and a half wait and at 2.50$ a piece. 
Since this is a tequila bar, I was expecting a top notch $10 margarita. But it was mediocre at best.
The servers seemed overwhelmed and needed way more help than one very slow busboy. 
Everyone was very friendly, and if they are still around in 6 months, I may check them out again for happy hour.
***update 
This place charged my card twice. Make sure you check your bank statement"}
{"text":"Drinks were really great. We only had appetizers and decided it will be worth a trip back to have 'real food': dinner. Happy hour apps (Brussels sprouts!) were wonderful."}
{"text":"Great new eatery. Our choir went here after a local rehearsal (check us out at www.valleywomensensemble.org). 20 of us gathered outside on their lovely patio while the very fun and efficient waitress Destiny provided us with top notch service. The street tacos were delicious and come with extra tortillas that can be filled with all the yummy goodness such as carne asada and battered cod. Perfect place for a respite after working hard or just for a lovely meal with your date. We will be back."}
{"text":"We checked this place out on Thursday for their \"Thirsty Thursday\" and got $2 off each specialty drink. The food and drinks were great! Loved the salsa, especially the green salsa. The street tacos were great too. Loved all the options. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere, great service and even better food!! I recommend coming here for happy hour and taco Tuesday."}
{"text":"Good food & fun atmosphere.  Great service, server was friendly & checked in on regular basis; really fast food delivery too!  Will be happy to come back!!"}
{"text":"Tried this place today for the first time.. AMAZING.. best street Tacos I've ever had, including the ones I've had in Mexico on the beach"}
{"text":"this place is great.  we went on a Saturday afternoon before shopping at the mall.  excellent service and the food was very tasty.  smaller portions but that is the trend now.  this is not your traditional authentic Mexican taqueria.  it's a modern ambiance and menu but very good.  margaritas could have been a little bigger/better.  wish they stayed open a little later bc this would be a great late night option.  overall I'd give it a A-/B+"}
{"text":"Love, love, love the guacamole trio & I think I could spread the bacon guacamole on just about everything I eat! The tacos are delish with the carne asada being my fav. Modern, fun atmosphere & family friendly at the same time. We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Good god, I never thought I'd find such a delicious Mexican food place in Phoenix- but here it is!!! First of all- elote nachos are BRILLIANT!!! Especially since their chips appear to be made in house. Secondly, their carne asada has that delicious beer soaked flavor that I grew up with and have never had at any other place before. Lastly- liquid gold cheese is exactly as described- this melted cheese with poblano peppers and corn is, in fact, liquid gold. One note- their spicy shrimp is indeed s-p-I-c-y... like, you may need to order a cup of crema on the side and alternate chugs, but well worth it. All in all, I cannot wait to return!"}
{"text":"Food was fresh and delicious! The owner stopped by and was very friendly and personable. We had the guac trio, chips and salsa, the corn, the street tacos, and tried the horchata milkshake and the churro dessert. Everything was amazing! Highly recommend! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This is a fantastic place for a Mexican grub + some great tequila shots/margaritas! The service is beyond comparison. Cade helped us with some very good recommendations for food which was very tasteful and margaritas with some amazing tequila. A must try place if you are in/visiting the valley. I WILL visit this place again (soon). Keep up the great service guys. Thank you!"}
{"text":"A ghost town during lunch so we didn't have to wait for a table. The server was very nice and attentive. The decor is pretty nice and a little trendy.
We started with chips & salsa platter. Not sure if the chips are supposed to be cold but it was a turn off. The 4 sauces all have a watery consistency and pretty much taste the same. The one red \"hot\" tastes similar to puréed chiles in water. 
Half way into the chips a gnat crawl from under a salsa dish onto the chips which the server was kind enough to then remove the basket from the table.
I ordered 2 tacos... 
Al pastor - can be best described as boring, very little flavor at all which seems near impossible considering how this meat is supposed to be prepared? The toppings were sparse, literally 5 diced onions & a single leaf of cilantro.
Quesa-Taco, chicken tinga - some boiled chicken in a little cheese roll in a tortilla with a dab of salsa and again toppings were scant. 
We were also brought an error shrimp taco which we didn't touch as the shrimp looked raw with the cabbage topping appearing old and wilted.
1 coke, 2 tacos, chips & a bonus gnat was $17- for lunch."}
{"text":"Locally owned with fantastic food. We loved everything, especially the guacamole trio. Can't wait to go back and try the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"Great Food! Great Service! Owner/Chef's Wife was present and making sure everyone was having a great experience!!"}
{"text":"Excellent experience all around - ambiance, service and food. It was obvious how fresh all the ingredients were and the recipes were really tasty. We had a margarita, La Mula, Guac Tasting, Al Pastor Street Tacos and Mexican Street Corn Nachos. I would get any or all of them again. Super close to the Spring Training Home of the Mariners and the Padres - if you're around, you should definitely check this place out."}
{"text":"Trendy restaurant with great service and incredibly bland food. The food looks great until you actually try it. The meat tastes like it was cooked in a crockpot and the fish tastes like kids fish sticks. It is extremely overpriced for the quality of the food. 

Somehow the corn tortillas are extremely thick and have a doughy taste. I don't know understand how chicken, pork and steak tacos can all taste the same.

It is clear that the restaurant is aimed to please the American clientele that lives in the area. It is a small step up from hard shell ground beef tacos. If you enjoy authentic Mexican food with flavor, you will not enjoy this place. Seems like the expensive cost is to cover the expensive location. Save your money and go to a food truck if you want good tacos."}
{"text":"We came here for their taco Tuesday special, referred by a friend, and we loved it! The tacos were delicious, we couldn't pick a favorite. The meat had a lot of flavor and there was a generous amount. Our server was attentive and friendly. The restaurant itself is beautiful and clean, with a few TVs. This is one of our new favorite spots, can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"We tried Revolu using DoorDash last weekend, and it was do good we craved it again.  The carne asada street tacos are to die for, and the asian persuadion guac is amazing! One of the owners greeted/seated us, and got our appetizer. She was fantastic!
The atmosphere was fun, and the music was awesome. There was sports on the TVs, and the outdoor patio was nice, too. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"**UPDATE = From 3 stars to 1 star! I got sick as soon as I got home from this restaurant & I live 30 min away. I didn't eat a lot since I got so upset at the establishment & only had a little bit of the guacamole, chips, salsa, 2-3 shrimp from my bowl & 1 shrimp from the ceviche.*** 

I really wanted to like this place. The ambiance is super cute. Nice waitress so this has nothing to do with her. I'll start with why I'm so upset & describe everything after. 

I ordered the shrimp bowl, it says on the menu & the waitress told me that it's spicy but I love spicy. I got my bowl & can see the large scoops of what looks like chili paste all over. I was thinking they would add jalapeños or something to make it flavorful & spicy. But no, it was just straight spicy...  not a good & flavorful spicy. I tried my hardest to eat it & finally gave in. Pulled the shrimp out & asked my server if they could remake just the rice & bean portion & I'll put my shrimp on it. She comes back & says before I ring it in I'm going to have to charge you for the rice & beans. Your joking right?! I don't like your food & you're not going to fix it for me?! Maybe if the spicy was flavorful it might be different. So I said no, forget about it. I think she heard me say out loud \"that's a good way to make your customers not wanna come back\" to this already pretty dead establishment because she came back & said they discounted my food. 
So instead of just fixing my meal in the first place & costing a couple bucks on rice & beans they lost a loyal customer that's not going to come back & is now writing a bad review on your restaurant. It cost them more to discount our check & lose a customer than the rice & beans would have been in the first place. 

In summary for the following we basically thought most of the food was pretty bland. 
We decided to order the guacamole trio so we could try all of their options. A party of 4 & no one liked the bacon guacamole, thought it was too Smokey. We didn't seem to like The Asian persuasion guacamole either. Their regular guacamole was okay. 
We thought the ceviche was kinda bland but the girls loved their tacos. 

I wanted to like this place because it's nice to have different places to go to. But it's mediocre & in today's competitive market, mediocre isn't going to bring me back."}
{"text":"Literally a breath of fresh air that there is s place like this on the west side!! First off.. the decor is just perfect, from the colors and dia de los muertos theme to the murals. The cocktails, chips and variety of salsa's were fresh and the tacos were even better!! Highly recommend the queso taco with el diablo shrimp and the potato head. We will definitely be back to try some others on their menu.  You will not regret trying this local gem:)"}
{"text":"Jerry has the best Michiladas I have ever had! The tacos are by far the best in the valley!"}
{"text":"Great place to hang and have some drinks food is good breakfast wasn't the best but the tacos were on point took me back to Chula Vista and TJ style street tacos great service"}
{"text":"We have been to Revolu at least a dozen times.  As with any new restaurant, they worked through some or kinks and the place now is amazing.  The tacos are very unique and offer a wide variety of options.  For starters, the brussel sprouts are perfectly charred and have a unique blend of green chili on top.  There are many great tacos coices to choose.  The al pastor, diablo shrimp, and carnitas are some of my favorites. We recently tried the queso taco with various proteins and they were delicious.  

While I typically dont have dessert, the churro which is a can't miss.  The owners are very hospitable and are good people.  Give this independently-owned restaurant a shot amidst the vast array of chain restaurants in this area.  You wont be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Great food!!  P83 has a nice little gem.  The street tacos were spot on!  We all ordered different ones and no one had a complaint.  The Elote is a must and the beer margarita is a must!!  On a second visit we got one of the bowls... delish.  Next time I am going for the nachos!!"}
{"text":"Revolu was by no means the worst restaurant I have been to but I dont think we will be returning. I called to make a reservation for a Friday night since we were taking a friend out for her birthday. Upon entering, I notify the hostess of our reservation time and party size and she pretty much said \"tough luck, the wait will be 30 minutes because we are packed\". Her attitude frustrated me along with the fact that I made a reservation, so I asked her \"what is the point of making a reservation if I have to wait as long as a walk in?\" and she rudely said \"we cant help the people who walk in and we cant make them get up, understand?\" I asked to speak to the manager, since he was the one who took down our reservation, and he seated us immediately and he brought us chips/salsa. The not so great experience didn't end there as it took 20 minutes for our waitress to come take our drink order, another 20 for her to bring our drinks back and take our food order. The whole night I watched the manager hustling back and forth, running food/drinks, seating guests, doing more than all other the other employees combined. The food was pretty good but not good enough to come back after the hostess with a crappy attitude and the un-attentive wait staff. If the rest of the staff worked as hard as the manager I am sure we would have had a much better experience."}
{"text":"Love this place! Liked the comfortable yet classy industrial vibe. The Margarita was delicious and the food FANTASTIC! If you are looking for mass produced commercial mexican food, This is NOT your kind of place. The food fresh, well prepared and unique. Guacamole with bacon, corn, chipotle and cotija.. a flavor explosion. The brussel sprouts were on point and the quesa-taco had so many layers of flavor it was mind blowing. Thoroughly enjoyed the culinary experience, will be returning regularly."}
{"text":"This place is amazing to say the least! I have eaten here Many a time and have never been disappointed. The food is amazing, The bar is polite and clean, and the staff have always been extremely polite and timely. I cannot say enough about the staff or the establishment itself. Bring all your family and friends. 5 stars for sure!!!

PS 
Try the Diablo extra spicy if you can handle it ^^"}
{"text":"We were headed to a movie and wanted  to try the \"new place\", Revolu!  We ordered a large draft beer ($7) and a LaMula  ($8).  The beer was big and cold, but the Mule was the wrong one, it was made with tequila (we are not tequila fans) instead of Tito's vodka.  They quickly corrected it, but not overly apologetic. We then ordered one of the street corn appetizers ($5).  It was tasty but not as large as others.  We both ordered tacos this first visit.  One was a quesadilla style Mula ($3.25) .... good, but not crispy as advertised.  I had the carne asada ($2.50), pork ($2.50), and the shrimp ($2.75).   They were all good, but the shrimp was definitely my favorite. They all came on a small corn tortilla.  Lastly we had the churro-wich for desert ($8).  It is some vanilla bean  ice cream between two cinnamon churro disks.  It was very good!  I think once the team gets used to the menu things will improve. I will return again and hope to improve my rating."}
{"text":"Really wanted to love this place but I just couldn't. Went in on a Thursday night and while the service was great, our server was attentive and fast the food was just okay. I ordered nachos and added carne asada to them, however thy came with no meat on them. I informed my server and he quickly went into the kitchen to bring out a side of carne asada. The plate came out less than a minute later the plate was blazing hot and the meat inside was really chewy, leading me to believe that the microwave is in heavy use here. The rest of the food was also just okay and came out super fast. For the prices on food here, I would expect a bit better quality is all; I would be willing to wait a bit longer for fresh food. Not sure if I would return but it is nice to see something other than a chain restaurant in this area."}
{"text":"The place is cute and seems to be popular. The tacos and street corn were fancier than your average street taco & were delicious. The margaritas were a little two sweet. Staff was very friendly and attentive!"}
{"text":"We came in Friday evening with our daughter. We were greeted at the door and seated promptly. We couldn't choose between the happy hour appetizers so we ordered three. They were delicious. Our meals were amazing.  Great modern twist to a traditional Mexican cuisine!!!

~Dr. G"}
{"text":"Just okay...came here for my best friends birthday dinner. She made reservations two weeks in advance and some people had to sit behind us in a booth which was pointless because the group was supposed to be together. 
Anyways... the service was pretty good other then that. The service was nice and attentive. 
We ordered the trio guacamole with chips and salsa and I only cared for the original one. The salsas weren't very good either. I also ordered a mango margarita and mule and both were delicious. For food I ordered three tacos (el potato head, al pastor, and cilantro lime shrimp). The potato tacos was the best and the al pastor was definitely the WORST. The al pastor tasted so fake and gross I took one bite and was done. The shrimp taco was also pretty good. The only thing I didn't like is that the tacos were super runny so it made the tortilla too soggy. For the quality/taste of the tacos they were way too expensive (about $3 a taco). My boyfriend ordered the carne asada fries and those were tasty! Our bill was pretty expensive for just okay food."}
{"text":"Chips and salsa were good - carne asada and carnitas taco good - but the Margaritas were way too syrupy and didn't taste fresh. The Brussels sprouts so so. Maybe I'm biased being from San Diego but overall not as good as I expected."}
{"text":"Fabulous tacos.  Wait staff could be a little more attentive, our order was mixed up a few times.  However, the staff was polite.  Good food, Short wait times, great tequila."}
{"text":"This is our first time visiting Revolv. We were seated promptly by the hostess/waitress at noon on a Thursday. She took our drink order and they came quickly. She gave us time to look over the menu-lighter fare on one side, heavier meals (bowls) on the other, with a drink menu. I ordered the chorizo bowl and my wife ordered the taquitos...sides are extra, including chips/salsa ($2.50). I'm glad I didn't order the chips, because my bowl was huge. I could not finish it. Black beans, rice, chopped lettuce, chorizo, with a large fried egg (over med) on top, with a very tasty white sauce that had a nice tang. The taquitos were fresh and lightly crisp, with the same sauce on a small bed of chopped lettuce. Being that it was lunch, our hostess/waitress was all the help there was until before we left. She got a bit overwhelmed, which was OK with us. It gave our lunch time to begin digestion and we were too full by then for the churro ice cream sandwich many raved about. We probably won't go back to try this dessert until after Spring Training. That's  because everything within 5 miles of there will be packed until after the first week of April."}
{"text":"Outstanding cilantro lime shrimp taco, Del Mar fish Taco was excellent, and came as Ada taco was very good.  Good craft draft beer options and specialty drinks.   Enjoyed the AZ sun on the patio. Great lunch."}
{"text":"This place has a nice patio and the guacamole was great! We ordered the nachos too and they were so good. I would like to go back and try the tacos. I'm surprised this place isn't busier. It's a hidden gem!"}
{"text":"We are regulars for Taco Tuesday but we enjoy this place more often than that!  Great atmosphere, really friendly staff and just a cool, relaxing vibe for hanging out on their patio sampling their salsas and fun hand poured margaritas! No mix here!

Every single thing on the menu is a huge thumbs up too!"}
{"text":"Love this place! First, the atmosphere is awesome! Tons of wall art, great Latin music, and super staff. Most of all, the food is very authentic, fresh and delicious!! The owner stopped to talk to us and she is definitely the vibe of that restaurant. Bravo to the chef ( who co-owns as well).

First, the menu is pretty extensive, as is their drink menu. Happy hour is 3-6 , but I didn't see anything that I would have been inclined to try. 

We started with the chicharrones sprinkled with chili powder and lime. They came out hot and freshand crackled when we squeezed the lime over it! Now that's the right way to serve them.

Lime chicken wings were next. Very meaty and tasty served with a cool crema Fresca. Would order again!

In order to get a good taste of all their street tacos, we ordered their taco flight of 10 tacos. My favorites were the El Pastor, carne asada and veggie taco. Honestly they were all good except for the Sonoran inspired bacon wrapped hot dog taco. Had to try it for its innovative recipe, but it stayed on the plate. The tacos are loaded and served on small double soft corn tortillas topped with cremas such as avocrema. 

For dessert, you MUST order their flan, freshly made by their pastry chef! To die for!! Large portion, easily shared, with a side of fresh crema and a strawberry sauce. 

Friday and Saturday nights, the line is out the door, so come early or try them out during the week! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"This place was pretty good. The real standout here is the queso dip and the Oh-My-Goodness deliciousness of the churro ice cream sandwich. The drinks were just ok and a bit overpriced and the food is standard for what you get at any modern Mexican place. Overall, I would come back for the amazing churro dessert and some of that queso!!"}
{"text":"Previously Barrel Grill the New Mexican modern fusion restaurant is delicious hipster food. 

I came about 4 months ago and would have given a three star then as the music was too loud and the were out of their signature elote. 

They redeemed themselves today with consistent and excellent customer service and I finally got to try their elote which was pretty dang good. Their iced tea, cilantro rice, and tacos (my sister and I had the carnitas, el pastor and cilantro lime shrimp) were all very yummy! Enough to make my sister say mmm out loud. 

The fifth star doesn't rank because their decor is a little confused. They kept some of the old decor from the previous concept of western and changed it to Mexican and it just doesn't quite work. The fake flowers should go.. buy some succulents for the tables, it would make more sense. If you'd never been to Barrel Grill you might not notice but they could make this place a 5 Star for sure with just a few changes. 

Jasmine was our server and she was phenomenal! At 36 weeks pregnant and still on your feet serving I say more power to you, Congrats and good luck with your New baby!"}
{"text":"This place is super cute,  great food and drinks and service. Would definitely recommend to all.  Thanks"}
{"text":"Fantastic. Located in Peoria where The Barrel Grill was. Awesome atmosphere. We sat at the bar for lunch. Josh and Ana were amazing. They were friendly in a truly authentic way. We had the guacamole trio, 4 different tacos and the corn. Everything we ate was delicious. Thank you for bringing a new family owned restaurant to the \"Westside\". Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"We were hosting a rehearsal dinner and had no idea where to go in this area.  So glad we found this restaurant.  We sat outside on the patio and pre-ordered our tacos and sides.  Everything was flawless and the service was great.  The prices were very reasonable and it was a good way to be able to feed a large group on a budget but still have excellent food."}
{"text":"I am giving this place 3 stars based solely on the taste of the food, it was delicious.  I was in for lunch and was served by a waitress and the owners daughter, Olivia, maybe 8 years old?  Just before carrying my wife's soft drink over to the table she wiped her nose/mouth with the back of her hand and then held the straw with that hand as to not lose it.  My wife also doesn't go for alot of fancy extras in her food and just wanted a regular bean and cheese tostada and was told it would be the same price as a loaded which was 10$!!!   The chips and salsa are extra as well...don't go thinking you will be going on a thrifty date nate when you come here!  But as I started out with this review the food was quite delicious but after receiving our 50$ bill for a torta, tostada, quac sampler, a cerveza and a coke....I don't think it warrants a revisit."}
{"text":"Best authentic Mexican food in town! The Elite is fantastic. And all the tacos are amazing. Have been here a bunch of times and look forward to coming back again to try more great food."}
{"text":"No bueno. Of the ten types we tried the carnitas was the only decent one. Too much sauce on each. Compared to SoCal street tacos I am used to, they aren't good. Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"I've been here 5 or 6 times now and they don't disappoint! The bowls are generous, the variety and price of tacos is great. The guac is amazing and I just had the HH nachos which are hard to describe but so flavorful, especially with the chicken tinga. 

Kids meals are a good portion too. The only complaint I have is there aren't any tacos on flour tortillas for those of us who don't like corn. But there are so many delicious things on the menu to try!! 

Staff has also been super friendly and attentive. And they remember returning customers, which is super important for those in customer service!"}
{"text":"This place has an amazing street taco selection! The Del Mar fish taco and El Diablo shrimp taco are a must try!"}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp to stop by for lunch on a girl's shopping day. Very nice atmosphere. Great vibes! You have the choice of inside, bar, or patio seating. We chose to sit outside on the lounge furniture, and were super comfortable. The food and drinks were great! The owner even brought our food out and checked to see if we needed anything.  We noticed that he was very involved in operating that day, which we admired. 

The only two things I could even imagine to improve upon would be: (a) our waitress was a bit slow, but they may have underestimated how busy it was going to be that day and (b) the music could have been a bit more fun for a Saturday afternoon crowd. 

Other than that, I was very excited to discover this place and plan to be back in the near future!"}
{"text":"What an amazingly delisheous restaurant!  Totally would recommend the street corn nachos, they are bomb! We tried a few of their unique tacos and definitely were not disappointed. Street corn became our dessert because the food was just so flavorful. The atmosphere is so vibrant and trendy too, which I personally think is important when eating out! Ended up meeting the owners to compliment them on such a fun restaurant...they are beyond dedicated to their customers experience. Would highly recommend this place! If I could give a bonus star, I would!"}
{"text":"The first time I visited this place I was impressed... good food especially the cilantro lime shrimp tacos.  The customer service was good.  The atmosphere was family friendly but also fun for adults at the bar. If you are a tequila fan then this is a must try place for you! They have a huge selection of all kinds of tequila. Prices are decent. My next visit was not as impressive. The customer service was definitely lacking...server seemed mad at the world. The food was okay but not as good as the first time.  I think ill give it one more try to see what my final thoughts are but at the moment I would rate this place average with 3 stars."}
{"text":"Good drinks, food and atmosphere! Definitely trendy Mexican food but we have enough authentic stuff around here so it's fun to try a new take on things."}
{"text":"Revolu was by far our favorite spot to eat in Arizona!  So glad we decided to check out the M's spring training field before we headed to the airport.  We spend a week in Arizona and ate out each day.  We were in Pheonix, Sedona, Glendale, Litchfield and Peoria.   I wish we would have went to Peoria on our first day instead of our last....next time.  Their food was delicious....so many yummy flavors. We started with queso dip and Mexican street corn nachos....oh my gosh they were so tasty.  For lunch we had the carne asada bowl, quesadilla, brussel sprouts and chorizo torta, again everything was so flavorful and delish!  Don't miss this spot if you're in the area.  Our server was Jack and he couldn't have been friendlier.  We will be back on our next visit for sure!"}
{"text":"BOMB! The Guac Tasting is a MUST! And the shaved corn is as well. Everything we had was sooooo delicious and the service was great!"}
{"text":"1st time here, very nice bar and seemed like a happening place. Was told it's a kid friendly place...I'd recommend leaving kids at home, more of a happy hour environment with the loud music. We ordered the guacamole and chips, guacamole was great but chips were pretty greasy. Since it was Taco Tuesday I decided to get multiple. Being street tacos, I expected a little grease but just like the chips, the corn tortillas were just greasy enough to make you notice they were too greasy. They tacos weren't bad, had decent flavors but were a bit salty. My husband ordered the carne asada bowl, again good flavor but salt over took taste buds and had too much chipotle aioli and cilantro crema. We enjoyed the margaritas and would definitely come back for cocktails but tacos need some attention."}
{"text":"From previous posts, it seems like this restaurant has gotten its act together based on feedback which is a plus. We went on a Sunday night after my tired husband didn't feel like going out but I convinced him. (Tired of pizza delivery)I ordered a house margarita.... it was strong and not too sweet just how I like margaritas. I ordered the carne asada  taco, el potato head taco and the fish taco. The el potato head taco was very unique and delicious making it my favorite. We also got the elote. It was sweet from the corn but had a kick just how I like it. My husband by this time was a happy camper and enjoyed his tacos greatly and was glad we went out. We then ordered the churro ice cream sandwich.... I think we died and went to heaven. 

Our server was very sweet and the ambiance was very nice. It reminds me of other taco places in the valley but this one is very close to my house, so we will be back!"}
{"text":"I will not be returning to this establishment. Id probably find more flavorful food in hospice nursing nursing home. I think my father and I were the only hispanic people in the restaurant. That should've been my first warning. We had all 3 flavors of tacos and each one was . The rice was bland. The chorizo beans were bland. It took a good 15 minutes for my dad to get his beer and there were hardly any people there. No thank you."}
{"text":"This place was overpriced..and not authentic mexican food.  We ordered chips and salsa...which weren't free like most mexican food restaurants.   Salsas were bland.  Tiny street tacos were 3 bucks a piece...and the only one with flavor was the chicken.  Our 8 dollar mules just tasted like overbearing lime.  We won't be back.  Lunch was 40 bucks..even with a 5 dollar coupon."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere,and the service was great. The waitress Kasey was on top of her game. We had the taco tray and they were all great. El Diablo  taco was great it had a really nice kick to it. You difinetly can't have just one. The only thing was it was just a little pricey."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service.  I typically hate guacamole but their chipotle bacon guacamole is the best!   Carne Asada is delicious.  A must ask for that's not on the menu is the Rosarita.  Fresh puréed strawberry margarita.  The best!"}
{"text":"Hubby and I thoroughly enjoyed our meal tonight. We both ordered street tacos- cilantro lime and queso for him and el pastor and carne asada for me. We loved them and agreed that next time we come, we need to split the ten taco plate. Our traditional margarita and mango margarita were very tasty. We ended our evening with the churro ice cream sandwich. Holy cow! What an incredible combination! You must save room for this treat! The only reason I didn't give five stars was the chips and salsa were not complimentary."}
{"text":"Went for Taco tuesday. Tacos were on the smaller side but the meat was godly. Great happy hour specials too and nice vibe overall."}
{"text":"Amazing!!! Downtown vibe in the middle of Peoria. Everything on the menu sounds amazing so the awesome bartender helped us pick. He was spot on! Diablo tacos and elote (corn and added the al pastor) were beyond amazing! And the shrimp aquachile was worth every penny. The staff was equally as amazing with top notch customer service! This place is a great addition and a MUST TRY!!"}
{"text":"Wonderful salsas!  From light avacado to hot arbol. David took great care of us. I love being greeted \"hello friends\".  The plates going by looked very fresh and welcoming. We will be back."}
{"text":"I stopped by a month ago while visiting Arrowhead shopping district. While I was not fond of the wet carnitas taco, I thoroughly enjoyed the shrimp and chorizo con papas street tacos. I also had the very best grilled corn elote I have ever tasted. 

I was also pleased to find Firestone Walker Easy Jack on tap. 

Happy hour and taco Tuesdays are a great value. 

The reason for 4 stars was because it was a bit loud while the place was empty - and even louder after people came from nearby baseball games. But service and food was very good."}
{"text":"This place is good, its a bit \"unauthentic\" but what do you expect from this part of town. It is definitely catered to the peoria crowd. That being said its good for the price"}
{"text":"Stopped by here tonight.  First impression- very friendly staff.  They have a very good selection of beers on tap including several local brewers.  Knew we wanted tacos but the menu was overwhelming so we ordered the 10 taco combo and told them to bring an assortment.  Not disappointed!  Shrimp Diablo was the best!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Great service, great food, great drinks and good prices!! I can't wait to go back! Next time I am going to try the elote!"}
{"text":"Came here this past Saturday before a Spring Training game, it was really awesome. I can't remember what the taco was called but it was the cheesy chicken one, and it was SO good. The cucumber watermelon drink I got was ok, I'd probably try something else next time though. Not that it was bad, I just kept getting the green leaf things stuck in the straw lol. The wait time for food was decent. Guac and fresh chips were a winner too. Patio seating was perfect, the weather was beautiful. Perfect little spot!!"}
{"text":"Very solid tacos with prices that are fair, we over ordered thinking the portions might be a little small but all in all good service and food. Nice find for us in the NW valley."}
{"text":"Each time I ate here I got very bad food poison. I ordered the street tacos the first time and the chicken tings tapas the second. Each time there was not much flavor. I do not recommend eating here. However, the employees are very friendly and kind, I just wish that they worked some place else :(."}
{"text":"The staff is absolutely amazing, couldn't have asked for better service - thank you Colton! Food was excellent I would recommend Revolu to all."}
{"text":"We're giving 5 stars to this awesome, much needed new non chain restaurant in Peoria. They bring a very clever take on mexican street food with generous portions and fresh ingredients, all presented by great servers in a very hip and open setting. 
We started with fresh, light chips and 2 types of salsas...both roasted, one tomato red and one green tomatillo and both delicious.
Moved on to the mix and match street tacos and tried the Carne Asada, Chorizo Y Papa and Del Mar fisb tacos...all unique and very tasty.
Tostadas, tortas, salads, desserts, there's so much more on their menu that I want to try...I'll be going back very soon!"}
{"text":"Good happy hour drinks and they deliver food and drinks quickly, so it's good if you want to stop in for happy hour before going to the movies. The food is ok - the best items are their street tacos and their French fries. I normally love Brussel sprouts but theirs leaves something to be desired. Staff is very friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"This place had decent food But there were problems with cleaning.there were napkins on the floor and fruit flies in our drink.even my glass was all chipped and messed up."}
{"text":"Not very good. The margarita tastes like it came straight out of a pre-made mix you get at the store. House made salsa = terrible. I probably would be happier with a jar of Tostitos salsa from the store. Not much flavor and what little flavor it does have doesn't have a good flavor profile. We got the guacamole tasting appetizer and it's...disappointing at best. Again, flavor profiles are weird and don't make sense. The chips are decent though. Atmosphere (we sat on the patio) is fine. Music was unmatched to the general theme of the restaurant but whatever. I'm sure there are decent things on the menu but based on other reviews this is highly disappointing. I certainly won't be returning."}
{"text":"Wow this place is delicious, we all had street tacos  and they were off the chain. Stop there at happy hour the place was rocken!  We came in from Kansas City found this one on yelp and we would highly recommend it. Service was great as well very friendly nice job stop in and check these guys out for sure"}
{"text":"Love love this place from the food, the drinks to the staff.  The owners are wonderful.  They enjoy what they are doing and it reflects in the staff.  The authenticity of it all is great.  The margaritas and shrimp tacos are simply the best."}
{"text":"A very good place to come with family or just relax. The food is simply delicious. People there are very nice and did an excellent job at serving us. The menu allows us to select specific food without having to order a whole meal and you end up not eating all. The prices are reasonable. (Try street tacos, they have a large variation of choices). My six-year-old who doesn't normally want to go out and eat just told me that we should just return tomorrow."}
{"text":"Glad there's a taco place on this side of the 101 that I'm excited to take friends to! Great decor, food/drink options, oh and a taco tuesday menu!! Score!! $2 tacos (about 6 or more on that menu) and also some alcohol specials on the back of the menu. Seems like its all day, because we went at 7pm.

The tacos had a mound of meat, which almost makes up for my first issue with this spot --- no free chips and salsa. Which... is probably healthier, but mexican places have spoiled us. Salsa also didn't feel fresh, but still was pretty good. Guac was alright.

My other slight issue was the service was off. They were very attentive, but little things weren't ideal. We didn't have napkins/utensils on the table when we got our chips/salsa/guac... or when we got our tacos. After we started eating, I finally asked for them, and our drinks, which were perhaps forgotten by the server? But they were ready at the bar because another server brought them instantly when my friend asked. 

I am grateful for the tacos though. Those were excellent. I got the carne asada & the chicken con crema, and my mouth water just thinking about them.

Overall, I'd come back if I was looking for a spot to get tacos & hang out with friends in west valley, partially because it's the best I've seen over here, not because it's *the best*."}
{"text":"Heard a lot of good about this place, but it didn't live up to the hype. The food isn't anything special and quite a bit overpriced for what you get. Happy hour apps are 1/2 price but 1/2 size portions so no deal there. The beef in the tacos and other plates we ordered was either marinated in something unappetizing or old meat. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Came here on a whim for our anniversary. It wasn't too bad, but also not the best either. For myself and my husband we ordered 6 street tacos, one margarita, and one Mexican corn street nachos. It was enough for the two of us. The nachos were really good but I wish they had put some spice on them (jalapenos, or spicy salsa on the side). If you go, I highly recommend you try them. I was, however, disappointed in the tacos. We got two of each to share - carne asada, chicken tinga, and the carnitas taco. The carne asada was decent, but kind of fatty (like another reviewer said) - but was my favorite of the three (but I am really partial to carne asada anything so I may be biased). The chicken tinga didn't seem to have a lot of flavor to me; again, maybe some spice. The carnitas were my husband's favorite, and I have to agree that the carnitas meat was very good - but the toppings they put on the taco were very sour in flavor, and they put A LOT of sauce on everything but especially the carnitas. I kind of wish they would put less sauce, or offer the sauces on the side. Maybe that is something that could be requested.

It is a bar atmosphere, as expected, but the prices were higher than anticipated at a bar. We came on taco Tuesday and our bill was still $40 for one drink, six tacos, and a nacho so I think that is a bit over priced for a bar-like restaurant. 

Overall I personally won't go out of my way to come here again but it's not been scratched off my list if ever in the area again. The nachos were well worth it and I guess I could always ask for some Cholula sauce to put on top of them. If you can manage to get here during happy hour they are only $5."}
{"text":"Revolu roughly translates to disaster.  I think they nailed it.  We decided to give this place as a try as we were nearby and there is pretty much nothing else around this area outside of chains.  Well...we may have been better off going to a chain.  

The place was fairly empty and it was happy hour so that's never a good sign.  We sat on the patio and were helped right away.  The waitress brought us menus and a couple of waters.  The water was tap and as you can guess disgusting.  We ordered some non-complimentary chips and salsa, queso fundido, and a couple drinks. 

The beer menu was real sad.  Firewalker 805 was my best bet.  My date ordered a Mexican Mule.  We also ordered 4 tacos.

The chips were really good.  Fresh, crisp, and tasted homemade.  Unfortunately, both salsas were terrible.  The tomatillo tasted like nothing but lime.  The red tasted super plain.  Neither one had the slightest taste of chile to them.  The queso dip was very good.  I loved the flavors and the addition of tomatoes and onions and peppers.  

The tacos came out wrapped in two corn tortillas.  The tortillas had an excellent flavor.  Also tasted fresh and homemade.  Unfortunately, the rest was not good.  The pastor was shredded, the carnitas was so plain it tasted like they just threw it in a crockpot with only water, and the carne asada was dry.  

My date said her cocktail was not good.  I tried it to confirm and it tasted like old lime juice.

The decor in the place was nice and the patio looked like a great spot to have drinks on.  The service was prompt.  The pricing was crazy for the product.  These little tacos were 2 bucks on happy hour and 3 bucks any other time.  I would be pissed if I paid 3 dollars for these weak 3 bite tacos.  

All in all the food quality was lacking, the prices were high, and the drinks were not good.  I'm sure some people in this area will find this place appealing as there aren't many other options for tacos nearby.  For those of us that know better this place has very little to offer.  

Will not be back and will not recommend."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. But I couldn't. We were attacked by flies the entire duration of our meal. While the tacos we ordered were decent (guacamole was basic, salsas left to be desired and drinks were meh) the flies surrounding our meal were atrocious. Talk about curbing your appetite. When we addressed this to our waitress she immediately said she couldn't spray or do anything about it and this is just what happens when you're in an indoor/outdoor dining. I'm sorry, McScuse me? For realsies? Luckily there are other restaurants to visit for good food but I'm highly disappointed in this one. I don't know if I'd ever come back. #byefelipe"}
{"text":"Diablo shrimp taco is spicy but good. I love spicy and I didn't expect it to be very spicy. Love it. Totally did not expect food to be this good. Love the decor in this place as well. I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"I found the food to be great, and the service exceptional. Went on a Sunday afternoon - wasn't crowded at all but had several patrons. Everything we had was yummy, and the atmosphere unique!"}
{"text":"My wife heard about this place from a friend, I was skeptical but my mind was changed immediately by the super friendly staff and the fun ambience. It took a while to choose what to eat because everything sounded tasty but we immediately ordered the liquid gold cheese dip, because cheese. I was a bit surprised to see they charged for chips and salsa but it was obvious why, both are incredibly fresh and amazing. I'd rather pay a few dollars for great chips than get bagged chips in a bowl that are just okay. 

After spending longer than usual choosing from the long list of tacos I finally chose the Carne Asada, Al Pastor, Del Mar, and Quesa Taco because cheese. Each one was amazing, they nailed the classics and the creative Quesa Taco."}
{"text":"Such a great spot! Great food and really good service. From the OG Guac to the Shrimp Diablo tacos, outstanding!  The desserts were ridiculously good....next time we are in Phoenix, we will be back!"}
{"text":"Always delicious. I definitely recommend the nachos! They are to die for! Also the potato tacos are bomb. I also recommend the elote off the cob."}
{"text":"Met here with good friends for lunch.  Ordered the chips and salsa flight.  Salsas were all very good with the tomatillo being our favorite.  Unfortunately most of the ships were crumbs.  The waiter brought us more, though. 

Three of us tried street tacos and everyone seemed to enjoy. One friend ordered a torta and fries and he liked his entree. My carne Asada taco was very good.  The carnitas taco was fair.  The standout was the elote (street corn) but an extra DOLLAR to cut it off the cob is just ridiculous.  

The server could have been slightly more attentive with the water...that's kind of a pet peeve, but very important when it's 114 degrees out.  All in all, a good find and we will likely return."}
{"text":"Favorite tacos I've had in Arizona! Their El Diablo shrimp taco is my favorite and my wife loves their queso tacos, but everything we've had here has been top notch. We have never been disappointed visiting here. It's one of our go-to spots."}
{"text":"Love this place! Food is always excellent and service is great! Although normally a beer person, their margaritas are awesome. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"These tacos seem to be made by Sweet Baby Jesus himself. Unbelievably delicious. Try the ones with potato: I wasn't too sure about 'em at first, but man, Revolu made me a daydream believer with these. Also, the hot shrimp one (the diablo I think?) is from another delectable planet altogether. Eat here once, you'll be back over and over, I promise."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time tonight. Seeing as how it was Taco Tuesday they were pretty busy but we were able to get a table right away on the patio. They had misters on so it was ok temp wise. Inside the restaurant was super cold.

We ordered chips and salsa and the salsas were fabulous! 
Ordered the carne Assad tacos, al pastor, chorizo y papa, and my husband had the carne Assad also as well as the piggy in a poncho. We both agreed the carne were the best. All of them were great though. 

We didn't experience any issues with service and it was on a busy night towards the end of the dinner rush. 

Only reason they don't get 5 stars is it says good
For kids and the kids menu leaves a little to be desired. I feel like they could do better there, but other than that a great find for a local non-chain restaurant in the 'burbs!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place... it's my favorite restaurant on the West side. The food always taste fresh and the service is always excellent. You have to try the elote nachos... they'll be the best nachos you have ever had."}
{"text":"Horrible. Quick summary. I'm pregnant and went to bite into my taco and as I was chewing felt something hard. Thought maybe it was just hardened tortilla but decided to reach in take whatever it was out. To my horror it was a large piece of plastic. Gross!!! 
We waited and waited for our very slow and very unprofessional waitress to finally come check on our table to show her my discovery. She simply says \"oh let me get the manager\". Ok, so after about another 10 mins and us watching them chat in a corner, the waitress comes back and asks to take my plate. What??  Then another 10 mins goes by and FINALLY the manager comes over, with menus. Haha. 
Right off the bat she's defensive. Doesn't really acknowledge my feelings, barely says sorry and simply says \"yes plastic is not on the recipe. Would you like to order something else?\"  Um NO just get us our check and get us out of here. We are disgusted, rightfully. 
It's very awkward from this point on. She only takes my meal off check even tho everyone else stopped eating after the discovery for fear their food might be contaminated. I mean hello, dirty kitchen!! Yet she charges them for their meals. Great service. 
We get up to leave and now is the strangest part. The manager runs over to open the door for us and says \"thanks, please come again\". Yeah right lady. You couldn't pay any of us to come back for horrible service, dirty kitchen food, and ridiculous management!!! 
Plus the food was below average at best."}
{"text":"Revolu is delicious!  The owner is very hands on and involved in the restaurant.  Our family ordered 4 different items, and we really enjoyed all of them.  Decor is beautiful! I really reccomend it.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Not that great! My tacos were nothing to rave about. Don't get a heck of a lot  for your money. The strawberry jalapeño marg  was the best!!!! The bill was crazy high for 2 tiny tacos , side of wings, Mexican salad, 3 happy hour drinks and chips and guacamole. No wonder the waitress Up sold the guacamole, bumps the bill up a xtra 8.00 ."}
{"text":"Excellent service and food! Nice ambience and cozy atmosphere. The kid meals are big, one is likely enough for two kids."}
{"text":"Wasn't sure what to expect but the food was amazing. 
Each taco had a unique taste and burst with favor. Our favorite was the Queso-taco for most unique taco flavor! The street corn was slathered with flavor, each bit was as good as the last. 
Finished off the meal with a churro dessert! The house made horchata ice cream was the best part!"}
{"text":"YAY PEORIA!!! We've got a winner! Thank you for building such a cool joint in Peoria. Highlights: fabulous service, amazing salsa and hot sauce, and great menu variety - even brunch now! This is definitely our new spot."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere!! Menu hard to read. Pricing is acceptable. The steak and shrimp options are great but the chicken came out soggy as well as the pork. We will probably not come back."}
{"text":"We have been here twice and both times have been fantastic. I'll start with the items that we LOVED off the menu. The elote is awesome, the shrimp appetizer is life changing and all the guacamole are fantastic! We love getting the salsa sampler as well. Now as far as the street tacos we haven't had a bad one yet! I have been there twice and my husband has been there three times. Everyone we have brought says the same thing... AMAZING! The only things we didn't love were a cheese skillet app and the Mexican meatball app. These two dishes weren't bad they just weren't awesome like everything has been. Oh and order the margarita with watermelon!! This place has an awesome atmosphere too!"}
{"text":"The drinks here are great, staff is super friendly. The food is good. The prices are a little high but you pay for the experience which is totally worth it. They do have discounted tacos on Tuesdays like any good Mexican restaurant!

The atmosphere is adorable, it's fun and casual and a cool place to meet for drinks in Peoria which is so important to have! Happy to spend $ at local businesses!"}
{"text":"Popped in on a Saturday night, a waiter can up and was about to seat us. 6 empty tables and tables outside. Blond female manager stopped him, took him aside and whispered to him for two minutes, then spent 4 minutes talking to someone else who then came and informed us there was a 30 min wait. No one standing around.  We had nicer clothes on- Nike polo and jeans?  Maybe she was hoping for some spring training rowdy's to come in and drink more?  My company has had 3 Happy hours there and 1 awards luncheon.  Not any more. Overpriced....  hostess told me \"good luck\" ...."}
{"text":"A fun, modern, fancy taco bar is a great addition to all the well known chain restaurants that lined this street for what seems like forever. Cute bar, fun Day of The Dead décor all over, great menu with a variety of not only food but prices. 

I was surprised when my husband and I showed up here on a Saturday afternoon that it was pretty empty. As usual we sat up at the bar. When my husband suggested we start off with the MEXICAN STREET CORN NACHO | $10.95 Queso blanco+chorizo bean spread+shaved lettuce+pico+avocado cream+cotija+cilantro lime crema Add Al pastor $3 We o cours added the Al Pastor (Spit Fired Pork) I was a little skeptical. But it ended up being the BEST choice we made. Sweet, creamy, crunchy, savory, ALL THE FLAVORS!! I would go back to Revolu just for these nachos. To Drink they had a Sangria special that was not on the menu. I went with the red. It was cute and yummy. Then we both had some tacos. To be honest... nothing sticks out to me. they were good, but nothing to die for. 

I am excited to come back, try more iteams, see what the happy hour is about, and or sure devor an entire plaate of those Mexican Street Corn Nachos."}
{"text":"The place is nicely decorated. It gives me southern California vibes. The staff is attentive, fast, & nice. The three stars is due to the fact that I ordered 5 tacos - chicken tinga, al pastor, carne asada, shrimp diablo, & lime shrimp. Out of the five the only one I enjoyed was the lime. The ingredients of the other tacos don't taste well together. Probably wouldn't give this place a second try. It's just not worth the $."}
{"text":"I always take my friends who's have a high standard for Mexican food because this place is delicious with great decorations. Always super fast too!"}
{"text":"I liked the decor as soon as we walked up, the decorative skull door handles and the Mexico taco shop paintings as you walk in we're super cool. As soon as we walked in we were greeted by a nice woman we could only assume was an owner. She promptly sat us since it was our first time in, went over the menu and was genuinely excited to see us. She have us suggestions and then our server came and took our drink order. I ordered a plain beer and my wife got a Mexican Mule, drinks came fast and beer was ice cold and cocktail was amazingly good. The street corn nachos were recommended so we gave them a try and added carne Assad. It was about this time that my wife and I stopped talking to each other and quietly consumed the entire plate, it was AMAZING! For our main course we ordered a platter of 10 tacos (we learned that is 2 many for 2 people) we ordered the Al Pastor, fish, shrimp, carne and the Quesa. The quesa was probably the best and had Chicken Tinga in them. All of the others were fresh and amazing too. Over all a great place for a nice dinner and the bar was big and drink selection great if u wanted to hit happy hour and have a few drinks and tacos or even a taster flight of Tequilla. We highly recommend this place to anyone and everyone. Service and food were amazing!!"}
{"text":"Yummy this is our second time here and it keeps getting better ! I got the spicy shrimp tostada ! ( forgot what the exact name was)  AND IT WAS SUPER YUMMY , I'm a small chick and it's huge and I ate almost the whole thing ! IT WAS THAT GOOD, now I am going to drive happily home with my gigantic food baby and call it a day! This place will not disappoint !"}
{"text":"First time here. Great food
 Def will be back. Drinks well made and food hit the spot."}
{"text":"We were looking for a quick bite and this placed was near by. They have great reviews about their tacos and their horchata shake and drink. We showed up on a Sunday at 1pm and there were practically empty. I was excited to try the horchata mixed drink, so the waitress was friendly and after ordering drinks she comes back with my husbands bloody Mary which by the way was horrible but waitress tells me they don't have any horchata and we'll have to wait half hour for it to be made. Are you kidding...a Mexican restaurant and you have no horchata ready. I was disappointed and annoyed so they tried to sell me on a watermelon drink, I subed the basil syrup with simple syrup and it still tasted like basil cucumber, needless to say I left it sitting there and decided to take the tacos to go. They were nothing special. Al pastor and carne asada street tacos plus the Mexican elote for $5 bucks with 2 bad drinks were not worth paying $60 bucks plus tip for. They didn't offer salsa/chips while waiting on the drink I didn't even want.  No salsas either in the bag to go. Bad experience. I guaranty any other place would have compted my drink I clearly didn't like sitting almost full on the table. I literally had better street tacos from the gourmet food truck downtown. Bad form."}
{"text":"We were impressed! We started with a couple of ritas. They were smooth and you could taste the good reposado. We then had the regular guac. It had a nice combo of cilantro, onions and tomatoes. For our main entree, we had street tacos chorizo, al pastor, and Del Mar fish. We liked the fish the best. 
The decor inside was amazing!
We would definitely recommend this place and will be going back very soon!"}
{"text":"Great place.  Friendly service, good drinks, good food.  A pretty big menu with lots of variety.  I wish they had more for los niños.  A very nice change from the corporate establishments flooding the area.  Not very busy, so no 45min wait like across the street."}
{"text":"Went with the hubs for lunch. Dawn  was our server great waitress. We had the salsa tasting very tasty I p ersonally loved the red. We also had the guacamole trio so good. One has bacon who knew it we would be so yummy. I absolutely loved the la hefa drink. So delicious. The aguachilie was very yummy. We will definitely be back. :)"}
{"text":"I'm always looking for good non-chains on the west side of PHX and Revolu delivered. Delicious street tacos, tortas, bowls, chips/guacamole and tons of beer & drink options. Little pricey and I'm not a fan of paying for chips & salsa - but the quality was good. Also staff should be versed on the pronunciation of Mexican food items."}
{"text":"We were in town for a spring training game, so we looked around on Yelp for an interesting place to try. So glad we landed on Revolu! 

Great look and feel inside. Imagine Dia de los Muertos + Dwell Magazine and you'll get the idea. 

Fantastic food and drinks as well. The Mero Mero margarita is refreshingly not over-sweet, and packs a nice punch besides. Also try the salsa sampler; all the salsas are made fresh in house and are a million miles from Pace Picante. The tacos are fantastic - especially the shrimp diablo and the Quesa-Taco. And don't skip the elotes either. 

If you get a chance to say hi to Jerry, the owner, definitely do. Nice dude with great stories to tell."}
{"text":"I am torn on.my review on this place...the food was good..the service not so much. We ordered several different street tacos, which were all good.  It took 15 min for anyone to come to.our table, when Jessica did we ordered waters and 
a Tijuana tea and my boyfriend ordered a beer. She brought his beer pretty quick but not my tea, when I asked she looked confused, went back to the bar, my drink showed up about 10 min later. We ordered our food and asked for our ceviche to come out before our food.  About 30 min and out food shows up still no ceviche, I asked for it and she went and got it. At that time my boyfriend ordered another beer. After 10 min I waved her down and asked about the beer. Another 10 min still no beer, another wave down, after 5 min I got up found her and said I'll wait here for my boyfriend beer, she looked at me confused. Got the beer, ordered? a few more tacos , got those pretty quick.... 
I feel it's a little over priced and would probably give it another try...
Hope the service improves!!!"}
{"text":"Nice place, clean, chill atmosphere and really great service. Guacamole, Chicken tinga bowl and street tacos we're all excellent. Get the Revalou margarita, it's super tasty."}
{"text":"My favorite thing? The Salsa Tasting. I liked the fresh chips and the spicy salsa. The heat kept building and soon I was sweating under my eyes. :) :) Otherwise, this is no Joyride Taco. The music pretty much sucks. Also, not enough alcohol in my La Hefa (which was not spicy like the menu said)."}
{"text":"Tuesday before 6 pm is the best time to come to Revolu because you can combine Taco Tuesday with Happy Hour, which should be a perfect match, but it was mostly disappointing. The small plate appetizers we ordered, bean dip, nachos, chicken quesadilla, tasted like they were all topped in the same sauce. The tacos were all salty and forgettable; I cannot even remember what I ordered. Revolu is a nice place to get together for happy hour but expect mediocre food."}
{"text":"We've been here a couple of times now and have not been disappointed.  This last time we went we sat on the patio, which was awesome! Perfect Arizona evening! We ordered the Taste of Guac,  a trio of different flavored guacamole which were all very tasty.  The many different varieties of street tacos made it hard to choose,  but they all came out great.   We wish there were a couple more flavors of margharitas to choose from, as they only have raspberry and watermelon.  Our only complaint was the slow service.  Friendly,  but slow.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Had the fish tacos and they were delicious and also I shared for dessert a churro ice cream sandwich and it was to die for*review by my son (Grayson 10)"}
{"text":"My friend and I went to a spring training game at Peoria sports complex. It got to be a little too hot outside, so we decided to leave, but were quite hungry. My sister had told me about this place and that I just had to try it. She was definitely right about that. My friend and I both got a watermelon margarita that was refreshing and delicious. Then we shared the shrimp ceviche which couldn't haven't been more fresh tasting and delicious. Then we both got two of the carnitas street tacos. This was undoubtedly the best carnitas I have ever had. Everything was absolutely amazing, not greasy, and so fresh tasting. I would highly recommend this place and can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Flavors were ok (fish taco, Elote (1$ additional to have the corn cut off of the cob??!?), chorizo taco) but the service was kind of absent. Walking in, the smell of dirty mob water hit me. The place also just felt sort of... dirty. Dusty light bulbs, left over Christmas decorations stuck to door jams, unfinished decorative 'lighting ring'. 10$ drinks were light on alcohol. I wanted it to be better."}
{"text":"*This place has a bunch of 1 star reviews that have not been posted!!

Been wanting to try this place for a while. The Huevos Ranchers were very Good but a bit small, if you're a man these definitely won't fill you up. The kids meals were large portions, free drink & 2 sides - good deal! 

I ordered the Picado Salad w $3 additional grilled shrimp. I received the Mercado Salad instead. Easy to misunderstand (even though I pointed at the menu & I said it). Waiter apologized and was quick to bring me another salad. This one still wasn't correct. It was missing the two or three ingredients that made me want to try the salad; pickled red onions Cotija cheese & if the quinoa was in there I couldn't find any. There was however a very generous amount of very large pieces of raw kale, not very palatable even though I love kale. 

I mentioned this to the waiter and he again apologized. He brought us our bill with NO discount whatsoever just saying he would be sure to talk to the chef. You would think that if they completely bomb your order TWICE you would at least get a discount if not a free meal!!! We order a few cocktails w our meal and dessert. A disappointing and expensive meal. 

UPDATE!

So a friend talked me in to happy hour here last Tuesday. Another horrible experience!! It'll be surprised if you guys stay in business much longer! We waited over 45 minutes for our appetizer (chicken quesadilla) to arrive! It finally did AFTER we we were done with our main course!! Our waiter was very clearly frazzled and kept coming to our table with other people's orders. He said there were only two waiters there and that the kitchen staff was very overwhelmed. The restaurant was packed so they are either under staffed or unorganized. 

The week before someone at work wanted to have their birthday dinner here on a Wednesday late afternoon. We were ALL very disappointed! The woman who seemed to be in charge seemed aggravated when we asked for a table for 10-13. After some serious contempt she told us to go sit in a corner area and \" We had to sit at 2 different tables and Not to get up and move around or we would confuse the waiter!\"!!!!!!!?????? God grief!"}
{"text":"Really enjoy this place. Refreshing change from the corporate places on 83rd. Restaurant has a light and airy laid-back feel to it with a \"Day of the Dead\" décor. Am always greeted upon arrival in what seems a genuine smile and hello. Been here a few times and the service is top shelf especially from the bartender Matt. 
The food so far has been fresh made to order and delicious (loved the Pozole Sunday hope that sticks around). Have to admit that I am kind of stuck on their street tacos. Man-O-Man! Tried most of them with the El Diablo Shrimp being my favorite. If you love spicy this is for you and no skimping on the shrimp either.   
You have a steady customer here."}
{"text":"My boss recommend this place and I was just pleasantly surprised. I had the street taco steak and my sister had the Nachos. The food and margaritas are great. The cost is a little higher but worth it. I would go again."}
{"text":"Wonderful new place. Excellent service and the food is off the charts. Very different menu with lots of options and flavor combos.  Really, really good Mexican food and very authentic. Started with great guacamole! The street tacos, el pastor, delmar, and queso were awesome. Will be back again, and again."}
{"text":"As you walk into this place the atmosphere pops. Beautiful vibrant paint and murals. The bar is as welcoming as the staff. The draught beer selection is a short list, however there is plenty to choose from. The menu is a precise selection of authentic Mexican flavor. They have street tacos, tortas and apps. We started with the chips and salsa. The chips are perfectly cooked. Not too greasy, not too salty. The chips come with two salsas, a red and a green. The Red was smokey, tangy and full of flavor without over powering heat. The green has a fresh lime/citrus tang with a crisp tomatillo snap of flavor. The street tacos are perfectly sized so you can try several without over stuffing your self. Then just as your main course is settling the bartender comes over and romances you with the temptation of the dessert menu. Its sold with a level of commitment. We went with a just friends level of commitment. We went with the fresh made Mexican doughnuts. They came tossed in cinnamon and sugar with two dipping sauces, strawberry and chocolate. We left perfectly full. Not over stuffed needing a wheelbarrow, but full ready for a fun Saturday night out. We will be back many times over. We are happy to have this place in our neighborhood."}
{"text":"Came in with a group of 5 on Saturday evening. My expectations were low after going through the reviews.  Hostess wasn't very friendly. She sat us at a long table, she then proceeded to throw the menus all the way down the table one by one. Not sure why she chose to do this as there were three of us within reach to take them if she simply just handed them to us. Once she was done tossing the menus she just walked away. Food was average. Salsa's were nothing special. I wouldn't return."}
{"text":"Tried this place out the other night for a friends birthday. The service was good the food was for good. I would definitely recommend this place for a casual get together."}
{"text":"We went during HH. The staff was attentive, and prices were reasonable. I'd say it's more of a HH place for drinks because the tables and floors were sticky and the food was only \"OK\"."}
{"text":"As a visitor from CA, I am thankful for Yelp for leading me to a restaurant that is not a chain and has some character in Peoria.  This cool, little bar and taqueria was a refreshing change from the chain restaurant overload of Cheesecake Factory, PF Chang, Raising Cane, etc., in this area of Peoria. 

Upon walking in, I liked the look of the place. I liked the combination of modern and rustic decor along with the Dia de Los Muertos type of skulls throughout.  An inviting bar was in the middle of the restaurant. The friendly hostess directed us to the dining area.  I love myself some tequila-based libations, especially margaritas,  so I ordered myself one with fresh pureed watermelon, The Revolu Rita.  Our server said it was a good choice.  Mmm, mmm, mmm. This was refreshing margarita goodness. 

The menu was filled with many delicious-sounding things. Ordered the Roasted Brussel Sprouts and these things were amazing.  Charred to perfection with bacon, onions, tomatillo sauce and queso. All these ingredients came together for a perfect appetizer.  We scarfed these things down. Delicious!  Revolu's owner, Jerry, came by and asked us how we liked them, and I declared them the best brussel sprouts I have ever had in a restaurant. Upon first bites, I was trying to break down the ingredients in my head to make them at home. SO GOOD! 

The three of us at the table then proceeded to order a variety of street tacos. My eyes were bigger than my head, and I ordered four. I got the Grilled Shrimp, Carne Asada, Carnitas and Chorizo Y Papas.  The Grilled Shrimp and Carnitas were my faves of the bunch.  I was stuffed between the sprouts and these. I was ready to be wheeled out of the restaurant at this point.

Our server was attentive,  very friendly and helpful. The owner, Jerry, was fantastic.  We learned he was originally from San Diego. I really enjoyed talking to him and learning about his recipes and restaurant. I thank him for bringing his Revolu Taqueria + Bar to Peoria.  I look forward to trying out more of his menu on my next trip to AZ."}
{"text":"My abuelita approved  and I approved the margaritas. Lol and a few other drinks. I'm a really talented approver"}
{"text":"Muy bien...first time here. Loved it. The guacamoles are excellent.  Loved the roasted Brussels and the elotes."}
{"text":"Good drinks and food, great service. Love trying different tacos each time. I've never had a bad experience here. Affordable and something a little different than all the chains in the area."}
{"text":"You must try the Supa Fresca! Gin, basil, cucumber, lime and watermelon aqua fresca - dangerously  refreshing and easy to drink!"}
{"text":"Went to lunch at Revolu today for a birthday lunch with work friends. Had looked the menu over prior to going and was feeling a bit unenthused, but I will tell you from the service to prices to the delicious food... amazing scrumptious food... I was more than impressed. Some things I still do not know what it is - perhaps very authentic or over the top made up words, but I do say, that the chips, salsa and guac to the array of tacos and even the corn ... the corn... so don't think, just go. Go and enjoy. BTW great TV choices and atmosphere... I could go on and on!"}
{"text":"I had low expectations and ended up loving this place. The tacos are some of the best gourmet tacos I've had and the drinks are excellent. They also have a great selection of guacamole. Great addition to the West Valley!"}
{"text":"Everything we have tried has been delicious just get ready to spend too much money on tacos. Even chips and salsa is extra but we have been back 3-4 times"}
{"text":"So this place has great potential! We came here on a Friday night around 6. We were seated right away. The restaurant itself is so cute and trendy. I love that it's not a chain and it's on the west side! We ordered the guacamole sampler so we could try all of the guacamole (Asian, bacon, and original). They all really needed salt. They were fresh and the chips were fresh and crispy, but the guacamole just seemed plain because it was really lacking salt. The green salsa was very good, but again, the red salsa needed salt! My husband ordered a beer which took forever to come and then our glasses sat empty for about 15 minutes before anyone checked on us. We ordered the elote, the fish taco, the carnitas taco, and the el diablo taco. Our food took about 25-30 minutes to come out and in between ordering and it coming out, we had someone check in once. When it did come out, nobody came to ask if everything was okay. They didn't bring out the elote so I had to wave down our waitress to come over. The fish taco was definitely my favorite thing. It had a huge piece of fried cod and it was super flavorful and super crispy. The carnitas was just okay- it needed more to it. My husband said the el diablo was really good too and spicy! She brought out the corn and it was pretty burnt in some spots, but I was bored eating at that point and I didn't want to wait for a new one so I just ate around the burnt spots. It could've been really good had it not been burnt! Definitely ask for a like to squeeze on the corn. 

I would give it 4 stars for the fish tacos and the green salsa and chips. 2 stars for service. I will try this place again because it is super cute and close by and I think they are just working out some new restaurant kinks. Hopefully next time our service is a little better!"}
{"text":"Taco Tuesday is so much fun! The street nachos are also amazing. Service was great and atmosphere is nice although a little loud."}
{"text":"Cilantro lime shrimp street taco, carne asada taco, Mexican nachos that have elote with carne asada on them & their Asian persuasion guacamole. 

This is seriously the best. 

I prefer to go on weekends when it isn't so busy. They do $2 Taco Tuesday, but it's way too busy for my taste. 
I am a huge fan of this place & have returned multiple times after attending a fundraiser that was put on by the owner for veteran suicide awareness. Thanks so much for doing that for us!"}
{"text":"Cute place. Clean. Options of bowls and tacos available. A few different vegetarian options to choose from. The salsa and guacamole were delicious. I got the vegetarian bowl and it was enough for two meals honestly. It was spicy and great to wash down with a skinny margarita. Not a greasy Mexican food place."}
{"text":"I love the Brussel sprouts dish here. It's the main reason I go. The few other items on the menu are good as well. The staff are very friendly and provide good service. It also has a really nice patio and overall atmosphere."}
{"text":"Tacos are great!!!!!  Military discounts on taco Tuesday too.  Wait staff are super nice and attentive.  A lot better than the western place that was there before.  Tracey is a real sweetheart. Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Went back for some take out tacos and id say theyre mediocre. Food trucks are the best when craving tacos. Revolu is just the preferred restaurant for tacos compared to the other restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service, will be back to try all of the street tacos. Highly recommend the beerarita and chipotle bacon guac."}
{"text":"I have to say I am happy there is a Mexican restaurant that is not the normal restaurant chain close by. The nachos were so yummy. We had a variety of tacos and each one was so delicious. The cilantro rice was good as well. The service was awesome and I am happy to support a mom and pop restaurant. We will definitely be coming back. You have to give this place a try."}
{"text":"Really cute place. We went for lunch when in town for a softball tournament. The food and service were both fantastic. We enjoyed our visit"}
{"text":"USED to be great - not anymore. The last 7-8 times I've gotten food from here it was awful. Last year they had the best food and now it's always terrible. Not sure if they lost a chef or whatever but the food is always inconsistent and always has mistakes. Know your menu and learn to execute meals every time the same - that's what working in the food industry is."}
{"text":"I had a Groupon for a meal for my husband's birthday. We went during happy hour, so items were discounted and  the restaurant was not busy. Everything was delicious! The Diablo shrimp tacos were HOT! Chorizo beans amazing and the corn on the cob made me fat after just a few bites, lol! Took the rest home. 

They do charge for chips and salsa.  When I asked for a take home of the green salsa, Colton brought out a box of their super thin crispy tortilla chips and both salsas. Very nice. 

The waiter (shout out Colton!) was solicitous without being pesky.

Hub got donut holes with chocolate and strawberry dipping sauces on the house for his birthday.

Good experience, we will be back!"}
{"text":"Fantastic street tacos and the restaurant is modern and fresh. Women's bathroom is clean and wonderfully decorated. Definitely 5 stars"}
{"text":"Loved this place the first time we visited   So much so that I recommended it for our party of 8. What a mistake!  Service was beyond slow. It took 40 minutes to get everyone a drink and another 40 for dinner!  When we asked what the hold up was we were told that the kitchen couldn't handle the crowd. It wasn't even half full!  When we asked to please hurry with the check the server was rude! Entire party was late for a show.  Never coming back!"}
{"text":"This street taco restaurant is a hidden gem. Even when we first walked in, the hostess was excited that it was our first time in and we were in for a treat.

I ordered 3 street tacos. 
Shrimp Diablo - spicy chili marinated shrimp, melted cheese and cilantro lime cream
Carnitas -braised pork with green salsa, pickled red onion, and cilantro
And my new fav there, Piggy in a Poncho - Bacon wrapped fried hot dog, Oaxaca cheese, shaved lettuce, pico, and Chipotle aioli. 

We also started with some Elote and of course, chips and salsa. Both were really good. The chips were on the thicker side in case you were curious. 

May I recommend the Jalapeño Margarita? It has El Tesoro Resposado, puréed jalapeño, triple sec, house sour and lime. It was slightly sweet and just enough spicy to give the margarita a kick. Very refreshing with chips and salsa.

We sat on the patio where it was a bit quieter and the weather was nice outside. The service was good! I'd definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Place is super cute, love the decor.
To drink: Tijuana tea delish
To eat: og guac, elote, chicken tinga and Del Mar street tacos. No complaints with any of them. I did favor the chicken over the fish taco though. Chicken was stupid moist and delicious. 
Staff is all extremely friendly. Any place that compliments me the second I walk in after sweating at a baseball game all day, is a-okay in my book. Haha"}
{"text":"Holy crap the tacos are amazing. The chorizo and carne asada are the best. My husband loved his carnitas. The chicken tinga was also good. I tried the bacon wrapped hot dog taco, I was expecting a chopped up hot dog, but it came whole. Even though it was also tasty. The OG guac had a lot of flavor. Will definitely try the diablo shrimp taco next time."}
{"text":"I had one of their cocktails (La Hefa) and I sent it back... it was like watered down mikes hard lemonade. It's obvious they use pre made mixes for their cocktails and don't do anything fresh. I tried the guacamole tasting plate... I have no words... completely lacking in salt and the flavors were... Odd... The salsa that came with the chips was not fresh, and was an overall disappointment. I had way better salsa yesterday at a street taco stand... I've had better salsa from a jar honestly. Pretty lame..."}
{"text":"This is officially my favorite restaurant.    The guacamole is AMAZING...we did a variety of 10 tacos and I just can't say any were better than the other.    Service was great too."}
{"text":"Love,love this place! Such a fun atmosphere, and great selection of fresh food. Tracy was above and beyond helping us select some of her favorites. Will definitely go back and bring friends."}
{"text":"Carne Asada street taco's, pretty sure your not gonna find a better cut of steak in a taco, delicious.  Chirozo beans, I've never  experienced, were  excellent, price was perfect,  and our server Sydney made our first visit certainly not our last.  What a great place!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service, and a very cool atmosphere. The owner even came out to make sure everything was to our standards. We'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Drive a little farther south on 83rd Avenue to discover Revolu Modern Tacqueria! Really delicious authentic Mexican street tacos! Fun atmosphere with lots of artwork to look at. The staff is friendly and Jerry the owner is welcoming and personable. 

The guac tasting was delicious; our favorite was the Asian Persuasion with sesame oil and soy sauce. Squeeze the orange slice on it for a bit of citrus tanginess. 

Others had the huevos rancheros which were VERY spicy! The green in the salsa are jalapeños not green peppers. Woo!

Our cilantro lime shrimp tacos were delicious as were the carne asada and tacos al Pastor. My son was in heaven having finally discovered the taste of Mexican Tacos here in Peoria!"}
{"text":"Don't believe all these fake reviews. I got food poisoning from this place. Nasty, gross, overpriced, poor customer service. This place will be history in six months at the most,"}
{"text":"Went in for a late lunch the day after they opened. Sat at the bar and had some delicious tacos, with chips and salsa. They have quite an extensive drink menu of which I will have to come back and check out. Service was great, food was tasty and served within minutes of ordering. Looks like this could be a cool place for a nice evening meal and seems like it has a great vibe, something the west side sometimes is missing. 
Good Luck and I'll be back soon with my wife for some tasty margaritas!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere ,awesome food ,and the service was spot on . Salsa to me is always a indication of good Mexican cuisine and trust it won't disappoint. Second the street taco's and yes we tried them all were to die for . And last but definitely not the least Andrea was a great waitress."}
{"text":"Love the warm atmosphere and delicious street tacos. Great bar! Warm salty chips perfect for scooping up their fresh salsa and guacamole tasters. Huge selection of street tacos very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Met the owner and what a first class human she was. She explained the menu and how they worked and the changes made to the restaurant. Our server was knowledgeable and had excellent energy and service. I tried 3 tacos all different and all tasty plus the street corn off the cob( super yummy) and I and shall say we the hockey parents will be back 100 percent. Love this place."}
{"text":"Great new age tacos. Definitely more pricy than street tacos are, but a cool vibe and great drinks."}
{"text":"Came here with a group of friends on Friday 4/13 while vacationing in the area. Limited options in Peoria- but this one looked the most promising. We walked in, impressed with the decor and vibe. The food and service were good. We got a taco platter for 5 people and it was a very cost effective dinner. Also pro-tip they do tequila shot specials ($3,5,10) and you can make any of those shots a margarita for $2 more... so thank you $5 margs!!! Also, stay away from the strawberry margarita- not good.
Why 3 stars? Well... when we first walked in We were seated at a round booth somewhat close to the kitchen and bathrooms, not typically a problem except we all made a trip to the bathroom before sitting down and the bathrooms smelled horrendous. Like you could smell it before you even walked into the actual restroom. This was not someone having potty issues, this was clearly a sewage issue. They tried to cover it up with some disgusting orange spray- but it was one of the most vulgar smells I have ever experienced. We returned to the table and the smell wafted over periodically and there was no way we could remain sitting there. I'm not sure how anyone was managing to stay seated in that area. The hostess apologized for the issue, saying they were trying to take care of it. We chose to stay and wait for another table on the other side of the restaurant. So despite a good meal, this completely ruined the experience. I hope whatever issue this was- they fixed quickly!"}
{"text":"Loved the food the decor and the staff.
Was not very busy, so we sat right away, staff very friendly.  Service was quick. Loved the sause dips! 
Everything was really good. Late writing this, so don't remember everything we ordered."}
{"text":"I love Revolu! Everything is amazing from their handcraft cocktails to their ceviche! Great staff  and service!"}
{"text":"We started with the guacamole trio and it was so yummy. I had the skinny margarita and my husband has the mango margarita. Mine was a little sour and my husband's was gritty. That didn't stop us from drinking them, but I have had better. Taco Tuesday was awesome. We tried the chicken tingas, carnitas, pork and chorizo tacos. All were very good. My son got the kids cheese quesadilla and it was huge. It ended up feeding two of my kids. The churro ice cream sandwich was delicious. Very cool restaurant with good food. Worth a try if you are in the area."}
{"text":"(Lyrics - The Beatles - Revolution)

You say you want some Revolu tacos
Well, you know
We all love to Yelp the West
You tell me that it's margaritas
Well, you know
We all love to Yelp the West

But when you talk about Ceviche
Don't you know that you can count me in
Don't you know it's gonna be 
All right, all right, all right


Revolu definitely brings a modern twist to your street tacos!  

I came with some friends on a Friday evening.  The place had some cool decors of some down home Barrio love and Dia de Muertos murals.  The restaurant had an open layout with a solid bar in the middle.  We sat outside on the patio since the evening was nice and cool.

For our food we started with some chips and salsa and Elote.  Great start with the chips and it seemed freshly made.  The salsa came with a red and green option; the red was a little on the thicker side, but not as spicy as the green.  The Elote, Mexican cream corn as I like to say since it was off the cob, had a hint of a kick from the Chipotle/Mayo while sour enough from the lime.  If you like corn as much as I do this a must order!  

Moreover, for my entree I went for the street tacos of course!  I ordered the Al Pastor; pork, caramelized pineapple, avocado cream, red salsa, onions and cilantro.  Definitely a twist with the caramelized pineapple which brought a island sweetness to it while still holding on to it's traditional meat, salsa, and avocado.  My second taco was the Chorizo Y Papa; chorizo and fingerling potatoes wrapped and drizzled with green salad.  Probably my least favorite cause it was like a potato burrito and I wanted some texture.  My third taco was the Piggy in a Poncho; bacon wrapped fried hot dog with cheese, lettuce, and pico.  It is what it is, hot dog taco.  I thought my bacon and hot dog was a tad bit over-fried, but got a lot of the moisture back from the cheese and pico.  However, not my cup of tea.

In the end, Revolu is a spot I definitely would recommend if you wanted to try something new.  It had some hits or misses, but more hits in my book. - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"So glad I finally made it here today. Revolu has been on my radar for a couple weeks now and shopping with my mom was the perfect excuse to drop in for lunch. The place was pretty slow and the bar area as well as the dining room were self seating. This made me a little leery of the place as my experience with self seating often means I am left unnoticed for long periods of time. This was certainly not the case here I am happy to say! First thing I noticed was how trendy this place was for being on the west side. Now I don't hate the west side but having grown up in Peoria I know it's not known for its culinary selections. 

Our server, Sarah (I think) greeted us promptly and was super friendly. We started with the guac tasting consisting of the OG, Asian Persuasion, and Chipotle Bacon guacamole. The Asian Persuasion was definitely my favorite of the three. Who would have thought soy sauce would be great mixed in with guacamole?! The chipotle bacon was ok- it didn't really have a ton of bacon flavor though. Their chips and salsa were tasty as well. 

For entrees I ordered The Bowl with al pastor. Holy cow it was a fiesta in my mouth! The al pastor was so flavorful and crispy. The crema added so much flavor and great texture to the dish, I much prefer it to a giant glob of sour cream. The portion size was decent as well- I'll have enough for a full lunch tomorrow at work! My mom ordered the El Diablo shrimp taco. I didn't get to try it but it looked like there was a good amount of shrimp and she said it was nice and spicy. 

The food was awesome, but our service is what really stood out. Sarah was so attentive without being overbearing, and was quick to get us what we needed. She even boxed up our leftovers and gave us to go drinks without us asking. This type of place is what Peoria needs more of! I look forward to coming back and trying some of their yummy looking cocktails!"}
{"text":"Great jalapeño margaritas. You will definitely have to wait to be seated because there is no hostess but it's definitely worth the wait. Great tacos but I don't think the seafood ones are as strong as others I've had in beachside cities in Southern California. Guacamole is tremendous. This is definitely a must for this restaurant."}
{"text":"Great food and drinks! Went here with my best friend to enjoy a nice quiet Friday night. We ordered their tacos and margaritas, which were amazing!
Nice place to have date night as well!"}
{"text":"Dude. This place is freaking awesome!!!! The service is great, people are super nice and quick. And the chicken taco is TO DIE FOR. Literally. The taquitos are bomb too, shoot EVERYTHING is good here. The environment is great. Overall a great experience."}
{"text":"I have been a few times and have always had a good experience. Wonderful atmosphere and if you like spicy, I definitely recommend the El Diablo Street Tacos!"}
{"text":"The tacos are phenomenal! We've come several times now and always left happy. Only a four star because the service has been sub-par sometimes. Once we were charged for the wrong tequila shots (resulting in an extra $100 on our bill- which was corrected) and some bartenders make the cocktails very differently than others."}
{"text":"I love trying new places and there aren't many options other than chain restaurants on the west side of town, which just isn't my thing. However, my brother lives over there, so I was searching for something different and stumbled across this place. I am so happy to see something other than an olive garden on the west side. This place is fun and unique and they need more like it in that area. Drinks were strong but I will definitely go for something different next time. The roasted brussel sprouts are a must have. Good food and fun atmosphere. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is definitely a welcoming restaurant.  Staff is genuinely nice and happy you are there.  Diablo shrimp tacos were awesome, but watch out they are hot ! We will be back for the mini donuts with caramel sauce - yum"}
{"text":"This place has a good vibe.  The service was good as the employees were all friendly and were working together.

No complaints but a few pointers:

They continue the trend of charging for chips and salsa.  Any restaurant that sells $12 drinks really needs to include chips and salsa.

These are street sized tacos that are priced at $3.00 each.  

Food runner could not identify what tacos were what when she delivered the food.  This is worrisome for those with food allergies.  The server must be able to identify the foods for the obvious reasons.

The tacos were ok.  While I expected to pay a bit more for  street tacos in a sit down restaurant, the meal for two was $70.  This was chips and the flight of salsas, 3 alcohol drinks, 1 corn elote, and the 10 taco platter.  

Consider Restaurant Atoyac Estilo Oaxaca as a better alternative for small sized, authentic, street tacos. - will save you quite a bit of cash for comparable authentic street tacos."}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  It is a fabulous break from all the cookie cutter chains. I am currently 1/3 of the way through the menu and everything is amazing."}
{"text":"Nice to have a non chain restaurant on this side of town, gives you a downtown atmosphere. Had the guac sampler and shaved elote to start out. Great flavors. I ordered their old school drink which was dark rum with hime made orchata, Ginger beer and nutmeg - very tasty. Ordered a couple tacos a piece, the al pastor was my favorite. The decor has a Tijuana theme (hence their name), really well put together. I hope this place thrives, it's a little gem"}
{"text":"We were in Glendale and went to visit a Mexican restaurant down the street, but they had a hour wait. So we checked out this spot. They sat my family of 8 quickly which was great. Let me say this place is delicious! We ordered all kinds of different tacos off of the menu and not one was a disappointment. Everyone in my family ate like we Hadn't eaten in days. The atmosphere is pretty cool but doesn't really fit the vibe for the food. We now have a favorite spot that we will be frequently stopping at every time we're in the area."}
{"text":"Food was delicious, especially the churro ice cream sandwich! The taco Tuesday special was great with many unique choices! Definitely will be going back shortly!"}
{"text":"We came here on a Saturday night around 5:30 to avoid dinner crowds at Westgate before a concert. It was starting to get busy, but we were able to get a table right away. Super cute place. Very friendly staff. Cocktails were good. Husband was dd so he had a watermelon agua, and it was delicious. I had the revolu picado salad with chicken, and it was so good that I've been craving it ever since! Guac and salsa weren't anything special. Overall our party was happy with what they ordered and we all enjoyed the experience."}
{"text":"Simply bomb dot com!!!! Customer service was AMAZING!!!! From the moment you walk in to that last step out the door. It is on the pricey side for street tacos, but it is pretty dang good if you ask me. We will be coming back"}
{"text":"Service was great. Went for happy hour. The margaritas are $2 off. They weren't the greatest. We got the chicken quesadilla and the fritas. Average bar food."}
{"text":"We anxiously awaited the opening of Revolu. Hoping it would be similar to Taco Guild or Barrio Queen and we were happy it was on the west side of PHX.  We gave it a try last night. To be fair, it was the second day after opening and I'm guessing the owners are still working out the kinks. The atmosphere and decor is nice. The hand painted art on the walls gives the restaurant an authentic and good vibe. We were greeted at the door by the host. There was no wait and we were seated right away. Our server did her job but it would have been nice if she had given us a tour of the menu or made recommendations. We ordered the OG Guacamole to start. The description on the menu said the  guacamole consisted of avocado, jalapeno, onion, cilantro, lime and salt but the guacamole tasted like avocado without the other ingredients.  The guacamole came with lots of chips and two tiny little plates of salsa. Not enough for all the chips and guacamole. Our server did not ask us if we would like more salsa. For our main meal we ordered two Del Mar Tacos and a Carne Asada Torta. The Del Mar Tacos were just ok. The fish was heavily breaded and the breading was mushy. The street corn tortillas were not made fresh in the restaurant. The crema tasted like mayo. The tacos had salsa on them. It would have been better to serve the salsa and lime wedges on the side. The Carne Asada Torta had very little skirt steak but enough of the other ingredients. Carne Asada (skirt steak) should be the main ingredient. We also ordered Cilantro Rice. Unfortunately the rice was sticky and dry and had no flavor. We will give it another try and hope the food is better on our next visit."}
{"text":"Nice food menu, decor is a little disappointing.
Try the trio of guacamole ,s very tasty and done to perfection. Chips and salsa was well prepared and the sauce not to hot.
We tried shrimp and beef tacos very enjoyable.
A great spot for happy hour."}
{"text":"Love this place - great food, prompt service.  I love the a la carte-style of tacos...and great to support a local establishment."}
{"text":"You MUST have their piggy in a poncho!!  May sound a little strange but it's delicious!! I also love their quesa-taco. Owner has been on site when I've gone and is super friendly as are all the employees. A must try!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite spot ever . Beer is always super cold. Tacos are bomb. They have a new Lobster taco YOU HAVE TO TRY!!!!! Everyone is friendly and when you go Ask for Deena and tell her Sindy and Nancy sent you."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a quick lunch during the week and was very pleased. I sat at the bar since I was alone.  The bartender was attentive.  I only had tacos that day. I tried a fish taco only because my hubby is very picky and I wanted to approve this place first.  Awesome.. I had the fish, carne asada and shrimp.  Watch out for the diablo shrimp, it's very spicy.  Now forward to the next week when I take my hubby for dinner.  He ordered 3 fish tacos and then another 2 because they were so good.  I got the carne asada bowl and because I wanted to punish my mouth again, I got a diablo shrimp taco.  I can't wait to go back again."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Front the entrance til the end. Tracy the manager was sweet and extremely friendly. She welcomed us front the second we got there. She made recommendations and were spot on to our tasting. Our server Elexis was superb with her knowledge of the menu and service. I have to say this place really did made a great impression on us. From the service, to the food it was outstanding! We will definitely be coming back. Thanks to all for everything!!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing! It brings that uptown local Phoenix restaurant feel to the west side. This is a very much needed addition to the west. We had the elote with El pastor added and the best elote I've ever had. aquachiles, most of the tacos offered, salsa sampler, chipotle bacon guacamole, and churro sandwich and all of it was amazing. I would recommend this to anyone in a 20 mike radius to come try this restaurant. Especially now before spring training starts and it's too packed to get it. The atmosphere is comfortable and authentic just like their food. Staff and owner are super attentive and polite."}
{"text":"Nothing bad overly bad or overly good to say about this place. 

Came for dinner on Tuesday and started with the street corn nachos. They were fine...looked better than they tasted but they weren't bad. We also had the \"house\" margarita for $5. It was watered down and not worthwhile. 

Then we had some tacos. On Tuesdays most of the tacos are $2 each. I had the carne asada which was under seasoned and cold, the chicken tinga which was pretty good, and the pig in blanket (hotdog) taco which was surprisingly tasty. 

The group we dined with all had the same feeling: \"not disappointed but not thrilled. Probably won't come back\"

I think this place has a lot of potential. It has a great atmosphere and a fun vibe but just needs to kick up the flavor. Everything was just bland..."}
{"text":"We had a great late lunch Mary Ann was a wonderful server. We are so happy they chose our area to start their Resturant"}
{"text":"Another update- Ugh! I still love this place. The food is amazing, the owner is amazing and works out on the floor when they're busy, and for the most part the service is fantastic. But I have a problem with restaurants (and any business really seeing as how I am a small business myself) not staffed accordingly. Four of us came here for a double date night. Just four. There were several (at least 5) tables that were \"reserved\" and we were told it would be a 45 minute wait. We had no idea this place took reservations so we made a mental note for next time and decided to wait. We were seated about 20 minutes later at one of the \"reserved\" tables which I thought was weird but I was happy to eat! As the night went on no one came to sit at those \"reserved\" tables. It became clear that this was a tactic they were using to keep people from sitting down so the kitchen could catch up. I totally get that but if you only have the staff to keep up with a half full restaurant then there's a problem. I also felt kind of lied to, like they were telling us (and anyone who came in after) that between the full tables and reserved tables it would be a long wait and hoped we would leave. I'm sorry but it's just bad customer service and I have to dock a star :(

Update- I came here on a busier night and unfortunately had to dock a star. They are not equipped to handle high traffic as the seating is limited and the food/drinks take ages to be prepared. I still recommend this joint but at a less busy time like weekdays. 

The food is fantastic and the service is also really good! Because this place is still new it's not crowded very often and there's never a wait to be seated or put in an order for another round of drinks. I'm going to be so bummed when this place takes off and becomes busier but also happy because they deserve it. If you're looking for some good margaritas and Mexican food I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Finally an Authentic Mexican food restaurant. They are beyond tacos they have  delicious authentic real mexican dishes we had a couple of dishes and tried them between 3 of us. The street corn is sweet roasted deliciousness! Officially in love with the Churro-which and all in house made food from scratch. Highly recommended it. It is also kid friendly. Deliciously done!"}
{"text":"Came here before a spring training game and loved everything! The food was amazing I had the ceviche and some tacos. Watermelon Margarita was delicious as well. Best part was the service! Mikey was super attentive and had great recommendations. Can't wait to come back soon!"}
{"text":"Worst food, sub par service. The best thing was the decor. All I could hear was the owner complain about how expensive his signage cost. I love the idea of making traditional recipes and elevating them with some modern flare, but this concept/restaurant does not deliver. The salsa, both red and green are very similar in taste, using the roasted chile technique....they both just tasted burnt. Also tried the cerviche, lots of shrimp which was a plus but again, execution was not there. Also had two tacos and my husband had the carne asada sandwich, no seasoning and fell flat. Best thing we ate was my sons cheese quesadilla from the kid menu. Last thing, it took us an hour from sitting to paying the bill and there was only one other table and a couple folks at the bar. We won't come back, which sticks because we love to support local businesses!"}
{"text":"Way behind on reviewing. Stopped in when they had only been open 3 weeks, this place has it together. It's hard to know where to begin. The owner Jerry is extremely down to earth and is focused on customer experience.

Food: Fantastic tacos.

Atmosphere: Awesome artwork on the walls

Service: Only one server working, but loved the \"mom and pop\" attention.

Have been back since at food is still great, but service just needs a little practice and refinement in small things."}
{"text":"Great new place to eat, food is excellent, owner is very friendly and talkative. Not the conventional style of sonoran style Mexican food but new and fresh"}
{"text":"It took a few visits to figure out what I liked on the menu, but I do love their style of modern Mexican. You can't really get the type of food anywhere else on the west side. The salsa is always delicious. I also love their take on the non spicy chicken taco & carne aside fries."}
{"text":"HEADS UP: CLOSED ON MONDAYS. 

This tacos are delicious,  the tacos range from $3 to $3.50... the guac is expensive but if you get it, they give you a generous amount you can put it on your tacos as well. 

PRO TIP: ORDER THE ELOTE... you will not regret it. It is amazing and you can either order it in the cob or off the cob which is easier for sharing. 

This place can be very affordable, but it can also get pretty pricey very quickly.


The actual restaurant is as adorable as can be and their service is pretty good."}
{"text":"Worst service EVER! My wine came out in a glass with lipstick all around it and when the server brought me a new one, she said \"hopefully, this is a little better\"!?! WTH? Our food and drinks were served at the same time, really!?!"}
{"text":"Of all the \"modern\" taco restaurants I have been to this spot is the best. I had the chicken tinga, carne asada, and chicken tacos and they were all great. My con is that the elote came with no cheese. Then I asked for a side of cheese and they handed me shredded cheese. You do not put shredded cheese on an elote. It was still good but not great which is what I was hoping for. Next time I come in I will definitely be trying their drinks a long with more tacos!"}
{"text":"Not only does Revolu have amazing food but I love that every time we walk through the door, the whole staff makes us feel like family. We have eaten there 3 times now and every time they welcome us back and are so happy to see us... they even remember that i'm vegan! I enjoy their veg head tacos and bowl and my family loved the carne asada and carnitas street tacos and flying saucers. The guac is delicious, too. It's a fun atmosphere and delicious food all around. You need to check it out. Like now. K, thanks!"}
{"text":"OH MY GAWD!!! Came here for my friends birthday lunch, and holy cow. This place is off the charts. We  ordered the Elote off the cob (chef/owner suggestion), the OG quac, Carnitas Quesa-Taco, Al Pastor Mula Taco, and the El Diablo Shrimp. My tastebuds legit did a dance. This place is so flavorful, authentic, and the vibes are just perfect. The chef/owner hung out at our table for a while, he was so great and personable, he's basically my new bff. Our waitress has so much energy. I cant recommend this place more for the food, ambiance, friendliness, just everything was PERFECT! They brought us complimentary donuts for her birthday which were......INSANE!"}
{"text":"Finally made it into Taqueria as we had been there twice before finding out they are closed on Monday.  The decorations and ambience is very nice.  Had I not seen picture posts on Yelp, would have been at a loss as there are no visuals on the menu nor posted in the room of any of the dishes.  Nice outside seating if you so desire.  Server was very friendly and helpful, but a little slow for our service as he had one large table by himself.
My husband had his all time favorite Nachos, no meat unless you wish to pay more.  Nachos were huge and very tasty with roasted corn.  I had Al Pastor street taco which is on the sweet side.  I ate it but would not order again, it also was quite greedy.  Prices on some things we felt were way to high.  I will go back as there menu holds items not seen in other places around Phoenix and would like to try.  All in all we enjoyed our date afternoon experience."}
{"text":"Really great! The food was excellent and the churro dessert was AMAZING! Got to chat with the owner.  He was so passionate about this place. Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Everything here is amazing!! Try out every kind of street taco they have, my favorite is the chorizo! Great atmosphere, good service, awesome food."}
{"text":"On top of the food being awesome so are the staff and atmosphere! Will def be coming back!!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is nice. The food left much to be desired. My street corn was over cooked and my lemon drop drink was simply lemon and a shot of alcohol no bueno. Sorry nothing to write home about. I can't say we will be back."}
{"text":"I think we just found our new favorite Taco Tuesday spot in the west valley! The food was amazing and the service was even better. Everything tasted fresh and homemade and the flavors were extremely tasty. 

We started with the street corn nachos and they were delicious. I ordered 3 street tacos, the Carne Asada, the Al Pastor, and the El Diablo shrimp. They were the perfect blend of flavor and spice and the portions were just right. We ended the night with the churro ice cream sandwich and it was probably the best thing my taste buds have ever experienced. Overall a great experience and I will definitely be coming back and bringing all my friends."}
{"text":"Sooooo so so so good!! Great service! Never have i ever had food come out so quick! I'm a very tough critic when it comes to food and service and was pleasantly surprised by this new restaurant! Tracy was our bartender/ server and was so sweet, friendly and welcoming!! Definitly recommend!!
Only recommendation is the bar needs bar mats- im a bartender and it can be very dangerous/ slippery and hard on backs."}
{"text":"I've been conserving my 5 star reviews but this place definitely deserves it. When you first pull in, you'll notice there's a spacious parking lot with plenty of free parking. The whole property looks very upkept and new. Inside, the decor is very modern, slightly edgy with cool looking sugar skull door handle. I've been here a few times and each time it is not very busy, mostly empty, so you get a lot of attention and good service. I am obsessed with the tacos here! I always wish I had ordered another one when I finish my food, they're that good. My favorite is the shrimp taco and the fish taco. They're only like $3 and $4. I love the watermelon margarita, also. It's not very strong, but it comes blended in a tall glass and tastes very sweet like fresh watermelon! Usually they have a coupon worth $30 on the Local Flavor app for $15. So you spend $15 to get a gift card for $30! One of the deserts I've tried here is the donuts. They were super hot and came with chocolate dipping sauce and berry dipping sauce. I only took a bite because I was so full after dinner that I didn't really get to enjoy the dessert. I brought my leftover dessert home but my dog ate it off the counter :(
This is one of my favorite taco places in Phoenix. You must go asap!"}
{"text":"Bomb ! Bomb ! Bomb ! From the Chips, to the salsa to every Taco I tried (Asada , pork , fish/cod). Everything was very tasty and FRESH , no watered down salsa, rubbery steak, or tap water. Hands down I will be back, hopefully they stay around for awhile."}
{"text":"¡No sé como va durar este lugar abierto por mucho tiempo! El restaurante es un intento lamentablemente fallido de comida mexicana. Una vergüenza total y descarada a la gastronomía más extensa y sabrosa en el mundo, incluso la de la calle. El servicio peor que la comida, la gerente es completamente incompetente, grosera y con muy poca visión y tolerancia. Tal vez por la diferencia de cultura, tal vez es difícil entender el concepto cuando no eres mexicano y nunca has comido tacos en la calle. ¡Si quieres \"street tacos\", ve a una carreta, y si quieres buen servicio ve a otro restaurante, menos aquí!"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised by this place! I was visiting my brother and his fiancé from San Diego and we were looking for a happy hour and had a great experience! The service was quick and friendly. The drinks and food were excellent. We went for Taco Tuesday and I highly recommend the tacos! We also ordered the nachos which included Mexican street corn on top...YUM. Thank you for a wonderful experience!"}
{"text":"Food is DELICIOUS I've never been to a Mexican restaurant that actually taste like Mexican food AND it's not that nasty greasy Mexican food it's very modern, different flavors and combinations very unique. Weekends are pretty busy and the waiting area is super small can get crowded. Drinks are pricy but really good and strong. Staff is friendly."}
{"text":"Purchased a Groupon for this place, it was such a great deal! $15 for $30. 
It's Cinco De Mayo so naturally we wanted tequila and tacos. The art on the walls was well done, the music was fun, and our server, Marianne was great! 
Food was good, prices were reasonable and the margaritas on special for 4 bucks hit the spot. 
We will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and a bit smaller place. Had their fish taco which was delicious and a spicy shrimp taco. If I really liked spicy food the shrimp taco would be five stars but it was too spicy for me, the flavor was great tho. The churro ice cream sandwich was amazing. I'll be going back to try some different tacos."}
{"text":"Not great. Not terrible. But will not be back. Long story short I called 2 weeks ahead to make a reservation for my birthday dinner. I made it clear it was a large party and it was for 20 people. I spoke to two different managers and they said it was fine. Well i arrived and 14 of the 20 people in my party were already seated and immediately I noticed the table set could not seat 20 people, maybe 16? But with 20 people in that area that would make us all sit elbow to elbow. Anyways, I brought my concerns to a manager. She offered to move the party to the patio (which I asked if done, would it allow more room, her answer was something like probably not or she was unsure.) So we added a table to the  already set table and still no way 20 people would fit. In the end, part of my party had to be isolated in a booth behind the rest of the party. The tacos are ehhh, alpastor tacos were way too sweet and the carne asada was lacking flavor. The only good thing everyone seemed to agree on was the guac. So if you absolutely LOVE guac and that's it. Go for it. If not you're better off going somewhere else."}
{"text":"I love trying new places and there aren't many options other than chain restaurants on the west side of town, which just isn't my thing. However, my brother lives over there, so I was searching for something different and stumbled across this place. I am so happy to see something other than an olive garden on the west side. This place is fun and unique and they need more like it in that area. Drinks were strong but I will definitely go for something different next time. The roasted brussel sprouts are a must have. Good food and fun atmosphere. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I've been saying for a while that the Northwest Valley needs a legit Mexican place that's not a chain. Something fresh and authentic, not a Filly B's or On the Border. It seems that Revolu might be able to deliver just that. It's a bit hidden, so I hope it'll pick up even more once people discover this spot in their backyard.

We ordered the chipotle bacon guac (yum! gonna try and copy this recipe...), a cocktail, a watermelon agua, and 6 tacos. The only thing I wasn't crazy about was the cocktail -- the Supa Fresca I believe? The combo of flavors sounds really good, but to me, the composed drink tasted like bubble gum. Needs some spice or tartness to add a bright note (I've had tajín infused vodka at The Gladly, that would be perfect).

The chorizo is homemade, so that's automatically a must order for me. I also had the Diablo shrimp (spicy, but not too bad) and the carne asada. Wife got carnitas, del mar (her fave), and shrimp. All were delicious in their own right. Tough to choose just 3 from the menu, honestly.

We met one of the owners briefly (husband and wife team, and locally owned? Heck yes!). Very nice lady, and great energy. I really hope this place sticks around for a while. Might have to make this my new Taco Tuesday spot! $2 tacos every Tuesday."}
{"text":"This restaurant is amazing! We are so excited to have a non-chain restaurant that has fantastic food and great service in Peoria! We started with an order of crispy brussels sprouts. They were so delicious that we had to order another one. I had a veg head taco and, as recommended by the server, The El Potato Head taco and added the chicken Tinga to it. My tacos had wonderfully complex flavors with delicious sauces. My friend ordered the same thing and loved hers as well. My husband ordered the Carne Asada bowl and said the flavors were wonderful! We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Wanted to try this place and I am very glad I did! Our sever, Elexis or Alexis (not sure how to spell it) was wonderful! Even though it was getting late and they wanted to close she was very patient and went out of her way for us! She answered all of our questions and gave us wonderful recommendations. Yummy drinks! The elote was delicious and I also had a vegetarian bowl. Generous portions and big flavors. The desserts are also delicious, we took them to go as we ate way too much to begin with. Worth a visit and I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Met some co workers here  around Happy Hour.The construction on the street out front made it a bit difficult to get to.But once I was in, went to the bar and ordered a Sangria.
It was what I was thinking, tasted good!
Friends showed up ,we went to the patio & ordered snacks & more drinks.
Great food& service.We will certainly return!!"}
{"text":"Great food staff is always very friendly. Good atmosphere. The patio is really nice also. Good date night spot"}
{"text":"The food was amazing. The drinks were amazing. The service was amazing! I can't say enough good things about Revolu!!! You can't go wrong with ordering ANYTHING on their menu. I will definitely be back and will tell everyone I possibly can that they need to come check this place out!!! Only recommendation would be to stay open a little later. 9:00 is a little early to close. Otherwise a super amazing establishment! Sam is an amazing bartender and Tracy was super friendly and helpful! I can't wait to come back again soon!!!"}
{"text":"It's always nice to see locally owned establishments operate in that whole area of P83 that's mostly littered with chain restaurants. Revolu specializes in Mexican street food with modern twists. It's a cool setup with nice décor and friendly servers that I'm hoping will do well in this area.

For us, personally, the food is a bit of a mixed bag.

We started with the guacamole, which included chips and a couple of decently flavored salsas. The guac itself was just kind of bland, drawing comparisons to what might be found at Chipotle. We also ordered the elote off-the-cob, which tasted okay, but was on the drier side and not as creamy as what is the norm. I'm not sure if this was intentional or a mishap, so results may vary.

As for tacos, from what we tried, the best was, oddly enough, one that wasn't even a traditional taco. The piggy in a poncho, which is a bacon-wrapped fried hot dog, topped with some Oaxaca cheese and chipotle aioli was kind of a surprise to both of us. The asada and pastor tacos were a bit of a disappointment, unfortunately. The asada was very wet, coming off more like what would be found in a bistec ranchero, while the pastor was just a bit too greasy for our tastes. Clearly, there's both positives and negatives to be found within their taco options.

My girlfriend ordered a bowl of pozole as well, which was recommended by the lady who seated us. She gave her seal of approval, although note that it's only available during certain times/days.

For dessert, the churro-wich is excellent, which is basically Mexican chocolate ice cream sandwiched between flat churro-styled dough. It works incredibly well and was probably the best part of our meal. 

In comparison to a lot of other places in this area, you can do a lot worse than Revolu. And while the food didn't really offer anything even remotely memorable aside from their dessert, they offer plenty of other options that might be worth experimenting with in the future.

Recommended to check out."}
{"text":"Loved this place . The vibe is friendly, the decor is dope and the food is bomb! Micheladas are so good here btw. 

service was great"}
{"text":"I could eat their street tacos all day - it's a wonderful place to sit and enjoy great food and super service - -"}
{"text":"so so so disappointed. The steak tacos had absolutely no flavor and the salsa had a weird metallic after taste. The taco truck on 67th and Thunderbird beats this place any day. The weird rap Music in the back ground was odd."}
{"text":"Chips, salsa, and OG guacamole were delicious! My husband had the carne asada and the queso chicken street tacos. He loved the carne asada street tacos, but thought the queso chicken ones were just okay. I tasted them and, while they were quite good, they weren't my jam. I had the diablo shrimp bowl. When I ordered, the waitress warned me that it was very spicy. I'm 1/2 Thai so I just laughed her warning off and told her I'd be just fine. After a couple of bites, I realized I should have listened to her. The shrimp was HOT! She was sweet enough to rush me over a large glass of iced water and a side of sour cream, which I quickly spooned onto my rice. The sour cream did help to temper the heat a bit. I am not sure if I'm brave enough to handle the spicy again, but it was so flavorful that I couldn't help but to continue to torture myself and keep eating. My only complaint was that I was kind of looking forward to having a sangria on the patio. It was a beautiful night, but I settled for a glass of wine. There is a good selection of margaritas, but tequila and I don't play well together. Good service, nice lively atmosphere. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"We have been here about 5 different times for either drinks, apps, full meals and even cinco de mayo! What a fun place!! Servers are fantastic - Tracy remembers us right when we walk in the door, the blonde bartender is highly attentive and provides great recommendations and the owners are pleasantly social with you during your time there. You really feel as if you are a guest in their home.  We recommend this place to everyone that we know. The food is delicious and we have liked everything that we have tried! This is our favorite Friday night spot!!!"}
{"text":"I had their tacos in the past and it was a pleasant experience, but this second time around on Mother's Day I decided to treat a special someone and this place totally bombed. 

Prices and portions are way off. 
Ceviche was not up to par and what they call a torta is a joke. 

I ordered a 3+ dollar horchata and got a glass full of ice and about 5 oz of liquid that did not resemble horchata at all. Just plain lazy for not tasting what was coming out of the kitchen. 

The side salad was old and the only thing I enjoyed was the small corn on the cob replacement. 

The place screams delicious food from its decor and I wouldn't complain about price, but I draw the line at expensive bad food and service.

Won't repeat"}
{"text":"The food was overpriced and mediocre. The meat was tough and the portions were small. There seemed to be a lot of people at the bar so maybe their drinks are good but I didn't have any."}
{"text":"Went around 8:45 on Thursday. It was very quiet,  the atmosphere is very fun, I enjoyed the decor! Our server Elexis was wonderful! She was knowledgeable about the menu and offered some suggestions! Everything seems very fresh, the chips were homemade, the salsas were homemade. We had the liquid gold queso dip and it was very flavorful! They have a nice happy hour menu. The elote ( Mexican corn)was delish. The portions are huge and affordable. I will definitely be back to try some more menu items and cocktails!"}
{"text":"This place is bomb! Love everything about it. Food and service was awesome. This will definitely be my new spot."}
{"text":"This place was top notch! It's so nice to have a restaurant + bar in the west valley that isn't a chain.

My friend and I dined there this evening and the food, atmosphere and service was phenomenal - we'll be back for sure.

My only (slight) concern was that I didn't see a happy hour menu, hopefully there is a happy hour and I just missed the marketing/signage for it."}
{"text":"The guacamole was excellent and so were the nachos however the street tacos were average. All in all it's a nice restaurant but was hoping to find a good street tacos place, the search continues.."}
{"text":"Not the biggest fan of their tacos. This is a let's try it out once spot (at lest for me just to say you have tried it. On the other hand the place was super cute and the inside panting was adorable I loved it so much."}
{"text":"Super excited that I am in walking distance from this place!! Came here earlier in the week and cant wait to come back!

The ambience is super fun, decor is really cute. Super clean restaurant. 

We got the corn nachos and they were so delicious as well as a bunch of different kinds of tacos. My favorite was the carne asada taco. The del mar and chicken tinga were so good too though!! We also shared a Mexican Mule and it was super strong but super tasty. 

Anastasia was the best server I have ever had anywhere. She was so cute, bubbly, upbeat and extremely nice! She told us about the owner, that everything on the menu was made from scratch, what inspired the menu.. she seemed super happy and excited to be working at Revolu! 

She told us they were getting hyped for Cinco De Mayo and told us she would be there,  so we cant wait to go back for some yummy food and to see her again!  Thanks girl!"}
{"text":"First let me start off by saying that I am originally from San Diego, therefore I have a good idea of what authentic delicious Mexican food and tacos taste like...not to mention my Mexican heritage. 

Now having moved to Arizona 2 years ago, I was greatly disappointed in the lack of authentic Mexican food or good Mexican food. I happened on this place by accident and I am happy I did. 

As you reach the door to the restaurant you're greeted by a Día de Los Muertos sugar skull giving you your first taste of the restaurant bars theme. Now as you enter the first thing you will notice is the intricate painting on the wall paying homage to San Diego (come to find out later the owners home town) and the restaurants colorful theme without it being an eye sore. 

Customers will be happy to find a variety of menu items, although for my visit I tried the El Diablo shrimp taco, a carne asada taco, and corn. Now I most say dining here gave me a taste of San Diego; after one bite I felt like I was back home eating tacos in San Diego or eating tacos in Tijuana at one of the many street vendors. The tacos are well done keeping with traditional Mexican spices and flavor and the corn was a home run all in itself. 

Before paying the bill I was greeted by the owner Jerry and his wife and we spent 10 minutes conversing about San Diego and his restaurant. After leaving the restaurant all I could think about was the passion the owner puts into his restaurant and the amazing food that was had. This is my definite go to spot for tacos and I highly suggest everyone try it."}
{"text":"Decided to try this restaurant which features an array of street tacos. There are murals throughout with the Dia del los Muertes theme.  It is a bar and is lit up in there like a cafeteria.  Chips and salsa are not complimentary, there were two small dishes of salsa, no spice at all but ok flavor. I ordered a few tacos and by the time I received them they were ice cold. I will say that even cold they tasted very good, had they been served hot I am sure the tacos would have been awesome. Service is really slow. I will probably try this place again, could be the staff is  not in sync with each other"}
{"text":"The \"83rd\" area is a mecca of chain restaurants amidst an equally overwhelming sea of chain retail stores.  We needed to visit one of the stores for a household item so we Yelped nearby restaurants and came across Revolu.

Cool vibe and decor although it was strange watching the hostess \"groom/petting\" the female bartenders hair while standing in front of patrons at the bar. Looked like a motherly type of affection that in my opinion is not suited for restaurant employees in public anyway, especially since it involved hair. That aside, the staff was friendly and attentive.

The food was pretty good, definitely a step up from cookie cutter Mexican thus the \"Modern\" in it's title.  The salsa tasting appetizer was ok, chips were a bit inconsistent, some fresh tasting others stale, all in the same basket.  I had the \"Mula\" with chicken Tinga - pretty tasty. Husband had three different taco's and liked them all.

Dessert: don't do it, get your sweet tooth quenched elsewhere.  I love anything Churro so we ordered the Churro ice cream sandwich, one bite and it was sent back.  The Churro was rock hard, could not get past the overcooked pastry part of the treat.  The hostess was very apologetic and talked us into trying something else from the dessert menu.  Hesitant yet sweet tooth still screaming, we ordered the Bunuelo Chips, basically fried tortilla triangles drenched in cinnamon sugar.  One bite and back it went, same hard as a rock flavorless experience. 

Overall not bad, we definitely would not go out of our way to dine at Revolu yet if faced with limited choices around the \"83rd\" we just might consider Revolu."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times now and am willing to give them a couple more shots. 

The first time I came, we sat on the patio which was great! We each ordered one of the specialty drinks, which were delicious....but a bit pricey. We started with the \"Liquid Gold\" queso, which my friends had tried the last time they were there and said it was awesome. However, when it came out, it was soupy and flavorless. None of us are the type of people to send food back, but it was that bad. They didn't charge us for it, but they also didn't send a manager out to talk to us which was strange. For dinner, I ordered the diablo shrimp, carnitas and chicken tinga tacos. All were delicious and filling. I don't remember what my friends ordered, but they had ordered something similar the last time they were there and said it tasted completely different this time.

Last week when I came, I ordered tacos again....The carne asada, al pastor and diablo shrimp. All were good, but the diablo shrimp was much spicier than last time. My dad ordered the diablo shrimp torta with street corn. He said it was good, but nothing to write home about. 

Overall, this place is new and is probably still working out the kinks. Happy that there is a Mexican restaurant that is not a chain nearby finally!"}
{"text":"Wandered into Revolu while I was waiting for my son to begin his hockey game (Revolu shares the same parking lot as the Peoria Ice Den)
 Probably some of (or maybe THE BEST)  Mexican food I've had in Arizona in the 17 years since I've lived here!!! First the bar staff is beyond friendly and welcoming ...immediately felt comfortable
The food will speak for itself! 
Although, I will tell you the Elote (grilled corn on the cob with chipotle mayo , cotijo cheese, cilantro, lime)  is something you will not want to skip!!
I've never had this, but I am looking up a recipe on Food Network!!
Also, Al Pastor spit-fired pork taco....AMAZING flavors! Small bites-small prices allows you to try many different tacos 
No cheese enchilada with  rice & beans here folks - ALL fresh ....and the house marg is also tasty!!

Lots of TV's for all the games too !"}
{"text":"I've been a customer at Revolu at least several times now and I love this place! 

If you are looking for more than a meal, if you are looking for an experience, come to Revolu. I have tried the chips and salsa, guacamole, all the tacos, margaritas, and even the new breakfast menu! I have never been disappointed with the food or the service! Don't take my word for it, come in and check the place out and I absolutely guarantee you won't be disappointed with the experience! 

I tried the chorizo and egg hash meal and it exceeded my expectations. I have a huge appetite and am usually the type to finish my meal and even my friends' leftovers and I was definitely challenged today with how much delicious food came in the chorizo meal! If you're going to try the chorizo meal I would highly recommend you pair it with a margarita with one of their reposado tequilas. The chorizo meal has a slight kick with the jalapeños and chorizo being added, so if you compliment that with a sweeter tasting margarita, you won't be disappointed! 

When you stop in, you'll be very happy with the level of service you receive from all of the servers, but make sure to ask for Andrea! She was my server today and a couple times before and she's on top of her game. She knew exactly when to come over and top off our drinks, take plates, etc without us having to wait for her.

Revolu needs more locations throughout the valley! They are definitely superior to other Mexican restaurants like Joy Ride, Arribas, Abuelos, etc. 

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!"}
{"text":"Meh. It was ok. A little twist on classic flavors, which is fun, but I wasn't impressed with the quality. My carne asada was really fatty. The hard kind you have to spit out :/ 
Kids bean burrito was 7 bucks... with tip it was $62 for our family of four (2kids). Though I did get a beer, but with the michelada mix, which ended up costing me $9- for a beer! 
Ok place, but not worth the $$"}
{"text":"Seriously good! The street corn was very fresh and flavorful. The restaurant was clean and trendy. Staff was friendly and professional. Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Tacos.  Tacos.  And more tacos.  I appreciate the fact that they have a few vegetarian options when it comes to tacos so, I tried them.  

The veggie one was good and definitely recommended even though it seemed a little small for the price.   It had lots of mushrooms and zucchini finely chopped with some seasoning and not bad overall.  

This is a personal preference, I don't really like the deep fried tacos that then turn crispy but, I tried the potato taco anyway.  It was good for what it was but, the mashed potatoes were cold.  It was like they got them out of the fridge, added it to a tortilla, then deep fried it before adding some cabbage and sauce.  The sauce was a bit overpowering for this taco so, with a little less sauce and warm potatoes, this might have been enjoyable.  

Aside from the food, it was a nice and clean place.  Friendly and charismatic crew made it an awesome experience overall. 

Overall, I'd like to try this place again because there was a few other things on the menu that sounded interesting."}
{"text":"Great gourmet tacos. Def try a little of each. 3 street tacos each was a great amount after the wonderful chips and salsa we ordered. The salsa was diff but good. We split each taco so we could both try all that we ordered.  Cold inside so we ate out on the patio since it was so nice out. The waitress made sure to tell the mgr of the temp inside since if it hadn't been for the nice weather outside we would have froze inside. Great atmosphere and beer to. Will bring friends back for taco Tuesday."}
{"text":"After several long and painful medical appointments, we were eager for a break and close to Arrowhead when I remembered reading several recent reviews on Revolu. There were just a few guests when we arrived just before 3 pm. Decor is colorful, even cheery with its Day of the Dead theme, dark wood furniture and hand painted murals. 

Our server was Cade, and while he was upbeat and easy to talk to, over the hour he dropped the ball on several key things. If I ask for water, bring it. If I have to ask again ten minutes later, don't go check another table first. Your salsa is devil fire Satan hot. Ow. 

We tried several street tacos, each under $4 and served on corn tortillas. All were nicely dressed and fresh. My cod was the winner, with cabbage and pico and creamy sauce. We each had the carne asada which we requested rare, but came out super well done and chopped. Meh. And hubby did not love the chorizo potato version. It smelled lovely to me. 

For entrees, he chose the elote, a grilled ear of corn rolled in spices, mayo and butter. Not a thrill.  I ordered the corn salad with grilled shrimp, mild. Those shrimp were sexy and smoky, crisp and chewy and worthy of designer greens. Instead, the lettuce was chopped iceberg, pale and wimpy and white under its sprinkling of black beans, corn and lime vinaigrette. 

Yes, it was tasty, but when Cade checked in we suggested darker greens to bring it up to Revolu's colorful look. 

Beverage wise, I can happily endorse the watermelon Aguas frescas as something lightly sweet and smooth. Call it liquid watermelon with the perfect texture. Yum. 

Dessert was not an option, given our need for naps, but I'm eager to try the churros ice cream sandwich with cajeta. There's more, but why settle?

The husband was underwhelmed, but with judicious ordering I'd try again with a margarita loving girlfriend or two."}
{"text":"Great customer service and AMAZING food.  We tried the street tacos and churro-wich that was as novel as it was delicious.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Hands down one of the worst meals I've ever had. Went with my husband after a spring training game. We started with two margaritas that were pure lime juice. No tequila to be found. Then we moved on to guac and a taco platter. The guac was the one \"ok\" thing we had. The tacos were soggy and flavorless. We tried the carnitas, carne asada, fish and chicken tinga. The only somewhat ok one was the chicken tinga. One top of the awful food and drinks the service was HORRIBLE. We watched the bartender make our drinks and sit the on the edge of the bar where they sat for 15 minutes for our server to eventually bring them to us. Meanwhile there were no less than 4 other servers chatting near the bar and not one stepped to bring our drinks. We will never ever go here again."}
{"text":"A little pricey for my taste (I didn't go during HH or taco Tuesday though). The chicken tinga tacos were delicious and this place won me over with their green salsa."}
{"text":"To start off the chips and both of the salsas are amazing highly recommendThey even got the drinks down. The watermelon, jamaica and horchata are the best I've had in this area. They are not overly sweet like alot of places and they are made fresh just right.

When you come here you have to try the street tacos before anything plenty to choose from! The only thing is I wish they had more of traditional plates with sides (ex. Carne asada plate with rice and beans). But other than that they have very friendly staff and good service. I definitely will be coming back to try out some more."}
{"text":"The food was great; authentic street tacos! The guacamole was incredibly fresh and tasty! I think this will be the new \"hot\" place to be for P83-come see for yourself!"}
{"text":"Well Monday must be a bad night for quality We were seated right away. Restaurant was half empty. Waitress went into to her talk about the menu. Had to ask her to come back so we could at least talk about the menu. Never did she tell us it was happy hour for drinks and appetizers. My husbands tacos were good but small. Alcarte sides. My entree skirt steak came cold and had to be sent back. Came back with a greasy tortilla on the base. Almost inedible. Barely ate it. They charged for chips and salsa. Won't even give them a second try. 
3 stars clean and pretty but awful attitude with server"}
{"text":"Seen this place several times and finally decided to stop. So glad I did. Everything from the hostess to food was perfection. Friendly and inviting staff, the decor is so fun and the food was delicious. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Westsiders ! Finally -- weve got a hip place to enjoy
lunch, dinner or Happy hour! The food will not disappoint and the service was great! It's our new fav' little hidden gem. Go check it out you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Tacos are creative, cooked with fresh ingredients, and priced right. Taco truck meets  beach hang out. Happy Hour is fantastic. The chorizo is amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Loved the tacos. The service and the beers and tequila. Super amazing place. I recommend it 100X"}
{"text":"Food was overall good.  Had the pastor tacos which were good but a little sweeter than I usually like.  Also had the chorizo papas taco which was excellent. The hot dog in a blanket Elias excellent.  We also had the elote which is delicious. the guacamole chipotle and bacon is bomb. Service was on point all around. Definitely try them out. Boom"}
{"text":"Amazing service & the food was excellent! We came for taco Tuesday & Happy Hour. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Street tacos are good. The bowls looked great (didn't have one). The La Mule drink is very good. Very laid back vibe. I like it."}
{"text":"Great eats and great vibe. They let me work outside and weren't bothered by my power cords. Will be back!"}
{"text":"I love good 'n fancy tacos. My favorite local place is Taco Guild, but unfortunately, they are a pretty far drive from where I live on the west side of Phoenix. I was excited to try Revolu--they still aren't really close to me, but their place is a lot more convenient than fighting downtown Phoenix traffic to reach the Guild.

Revolu lived up to my expectations. Service was consistent and excellent from the time we walked through the door.  The place has a fun atmosphere. When we were there on a Saturday at lunch time, the tables were over half full and it was nice and quiet.

This was our one big meal for the day--and my birthday--so we went all out. We ordered the chips and salsa to start, since that's all our son would want. My husband had one of their many beers on tap, and I had a Funky Fresa to drink, and REALLY enjoyed that. To share as a couple, we ordered Brussels sprouts. I love roasted sprouts and make them at home a lot, but I never considered adding salsa verde on top. It works, very well! Some bacon was mixed in, too. 

I ordered two tacos: Cilantro shrimp and the Quesa-taco with chicken tinga filling. The tortillas are street taco size, but they seriously pile on the filling. The shrimp taco had three shrimp--good quality ones--and shaved cabbage, and I had to eat a couple forkfuls before I dared to pick it up. It was a dripping mess and delicious. The Quesa-taco fascinated me. I've never had a taco like it anywhere else. The cheese casing was fantastic, and there was a lot of meat stuffed inside!

My husband had the carnitas taco and the Revolu wings, cilantro-lime style. I snagged a chicken wing and it was absolutely delicious.

I'm thrilled to have found this place. I've already informed my husband that we need to make return trips because I want to try most all of their tacos."}
{"text":"So spicy it had me reaching for my watermelon agua. We started with the Salsa Tasting, the red arbol was my favorite but wow, electrifying. I found dipping a chip in the avocado sauce then the spicy red made the perfect bite, cool and sassy. I had the Del Mar fish taco, tasted fabulous and will have one again. Next was the El Diablo shrimp taco, knocked off my socks with spice. I love my food spicy but this got me pretty close to the heat limit. I also had a mula with carne asada, another super taco. Remember these are street tacos so they are smaller than your more traditional taco. Paul had a chorizo y papa, cilantro lime shrimp and mula with carnitas taco. He loved all three especially the carnitas meat, very tender with lots of flavor. We both had the elote cut off the cob. Cotija cheese with a cilantro lime cream, how could it not be spot on? I had a watermelon water which is not sweet just very natural tasting. P had a margarita which was exactly how one should taste. There is a vast array of margaritas on the menu which I look forward to trying. The restaurant is well designed with Day of the Dead decorations throughout. There is indoor and outdoor seating available. All the staff seem knowledgeable about the menu, I appreciate that. It's very affordable and I walked away feeling our money was well spent. I think this place will be around for quite awhile."}
{"text":"Guess we all like different types of Mexican food, but, I will still give you my review.
Nice decor.
Seats at bar are a joke, size wise and comfort. All metal with barely enough room for your butt.
I sat at a table for cushioned seats.
Chips and salsa were ok, nothing special here.
I ordered a watermelon Rita and was so sweet could hardly drink it. Had waiter/bartender add some soda water, still too sweet.
Ordered the Del Mar street tacos. Fish would have been great, but, ended up so soggy and mushy from the salsa. 
The prices are a little too expensive for the portion.
My bill was a little under $20.00 which I gave the waiter/bartender a $20.00 dollar bill. He did not give me any change.
I am not sure this place will last as to the high prices for the portion size. The drinks are also overpriced. 
I am not sure I will return."}
{"text":"Poor Service !!!   Terrible Food !!! Nice Decor !!  Not Recommended ..... 
Street Tacos were bland and Wet ...No Flavor !!!   Chips tasted store bought and salsa was boring !!! House.made waters ...nope Jamica was powder mix ...."}
{"text":"Day of the Dead decor in a restaurant can be a bit unsettling, but don't let entering through skull door handles and being surrounded by skeleton murals make you think that the food will speed you on your way   to the other side--the modern Mexican food was mostly muy bueno, but the prices could have been adjusted for the lunch crowd. From the start I was pleased that they actually had a nice variety of beer on tap; I chose the Mr. Pina to accompany my pineapple highlighted meal.  However, I was disappointed not to sit and sip while munching some chips since they charge for chips and salsa and it seems for $7.00 beers you should be entitled to some chips, c'on....
Friend had the meal I wished I'd ordered, Chicken Tinga Torta ($12) which was deliciously flavorful smokey ancho sauce, stacked high with pretty pink pickled onions on top, and the street corn as his side (nice and charred, but needed more cheese--was there any?). 
My \"Flying Saucer Al Pastor\" for $14 was not as big of a taste treat. I liked the generous crispy flour tortilla base with the layer of bean spread, but the toppings just didn't come together into a memorable flavor.  I had to ask my pleasant and attentive server Marianne for a side dish of green salsa and some tomatillo hot sauce to taste anything. The al pastor pork was flavorful when I isolated it, but what I tasted the most, unfortunately, was the shredded lettuce which had that bagged and chemically treated not-to-turn-brown smell and flavor. With roasted tasty pork that should be the centerpiece along with caramelized pineapple and cheeses, why on earth would you bury them under a shroud of lettuce and pico (oh, guess I've fallen into the Day of the Dead motif haven't I?) and sauces like avocado cream and cilantro cream and red salsa? Celebrate the ingredients and maybe divide the saucer into 3 sections of sauces so they can be differentiated and make a visual statement, or pick the one that works best and tweak it to perfection and have that as the signature flavor. 
There's lots on the menu that I'd like to try, esp. a variety of creative-sounding $3 tacos, so I'll be back and hope most of the meals are more like my friend's sorta."}
{"text":"This place is so legit! The owner is always present and super friendly! I love the vibe in there and the hand painted murals on the wall! The bartenders are knowledable and friendly! All of the taco are so good..carne Assad melts in your mouth! The carne nachos are awesome..don't skip over getting ELOTES!! Theirs is so delicious! Taco Tuesday is a great time to try a bunch of tacos and tequilas"}
{"text":"I took my husband here for his birthday lunch. This restaurant was highly recommended to me. The service was fantastic but the food was so unique and beautifully prepared and delicious. It was a wonderful experience and we will be returning many times I'm sure!!"}
{"text":"I was so excited for this place, but it really fell below expectation. The guacamole is actually amazing. If you just want tequila and chips and guacamole, this place is for you. But we tried 6 different tacos and all of them were just a bit off. It felt like they were trying too hard to stand out. It was just disappointing to have such a big order and leave there with half eaten food."}
{"text":"I stopped in after a Padres game and had some awesome kearny Asada tacos and a killer watermelon sopa Fresca made with Woody Creek Gin, so refreshing!!"}
{"text":"First time here.   Restaurant is decorated awesome very unique.   We got a bunch of different street tacos.   They were all delicious.  Chips and salsa bomb.   Service was great Kayla C was our waitress.   I highly recommend this place.   I'd give more then 5 stars if i could."}
{"text":"The street tacos were amazing! I also loved the elote on the cob of course! Highly recommend the house rita! Service was great!"}
{"text":"Wonderful staff and amazing food. Great beer and fantastic salsa. Love this place and love having the unique, locally-owned places in Glendale/Peoria. Sits just outside the 83rd and Bell area, so it's not as chaotic as the corridor there. Check it out and enjoy the local atmosphere."}
{"text":"After our first visit the owner reached out to us to give their restaurant another chance. I really appreciate this kind of attitude about his business. That's what you get from a local business owner who is passionate compared to what you get at a national chain place. The tacos are excellent especially the tacos AL pastor which they cook on a spit. It was nice to talk with the owner and see someone who really cares about their business. I would recommend this restaurant if you like Mexican street tacos done very well."}
{"text":"Omg! This is our \"go to\" taco place now!  We've tried every taco they have and have even rated them-our fave  is either cilantro lime shrimp or carne asada.  The potato head one is like a crispy shelled taco and is delicious too! The chips and salsa are cheap and salsa tasty as well.  If you're not in the mood for tacos try the carne Asada fries, elote, rolled tacos, or a bowl- all equally as good.  Try the supa fresca it's one of their signature drinks and it's amazing!!! The owner is friendly and is always running around making sure things are tasting good which is nice to see! Her husband must be equally as awesome because she is! 
You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I was craving tacos and have driven by countless times and decided to try them out. I'm a vegetarian so that means that my choices are often limited at mainstream restaurants but after a review of the menu on the outside wall I saw what looked like to be tasty tacos. Upon walking in, no one seemed enthused that I decided to stop in. After an awkward conversation with the bartender and a server about where I could sit, I sat myself. After I watched the two chat for a bit, the server brought over the menu. I thought it was a bit off, but went along with my order because I was hungry. The chips and salsa and the veggie tacos were great. As I munched on my chips I watched people come in. They were immediately greater with a cheerful hello from the bartender who struggle with me and were seated by the same server who dragged her feet earlier. At that point I wanted to walk out. I asked for the check, paid, and then told the manager about my experience. He apologized and that was it. Service is everything and it sucked. I experienced discrimination on a taco run and it sucked. I can't see myself returning there again because no well-seasoned, overpriced, veggie taco is worth poor treatment."}
{"text":"Amazing!! My husband and I came here on a Thursday during happy hour and had a great experience from beginning to end! Our server, Elexyis, was very friendly and attentive. Our La Mulas were delicious and potent! We ordered 4 different types of tacos and they were all fantastic. The cilantro rice was to die for. We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Authentic yet not intimidating, upscale but casual, nice atmosphere and incredible service! The food is exquisite. Everything we've tried has been delicious, from the tacos to the tortas. The elote (corn) is especially tasty!"}
{"text":"Tonight was my second visit to Revolu. The second time was just as, if not more enjoyable as my first. The phone call I placed with Tracy to see if I could make a reservation was as friendly as you could hope for, and we were greeted and seated in minutes of walking thru the door. We made the choice to sit at the bar the 2nd visit and had a crazy awesome experience with Sam the bartender. Everything I've ordered is great! Tequila of the month??? Yes please! Great experience! Great establishment! Don't go anywhere Revolu!!! Try this place, don't hesitate... you won't regret!"}
{"text":"I went to a meeting here and the food was okay, but nothing special or memorable. The service was just mediocre as well."}
{"text":"Great place! Hostess was very friendly. Service was fast..strawberry snd watermelon margaritas were delicious. Carne asada, carnitas tacos - awesome! Shrimp cilantro lime is fantastic!"}
{"text":"I am constantly looking for a good taco joint on the west side. We are inundated with the \"rico\" chains, but nothing seriously tasty. So, I was excited when a good friend of mine decided to meet here for a birthday celebration. I hadn't even heard of it.

It was a mixed bag as we walked in the door. The decor is cool as others have described, but the hostess would not seat us at our table until at least half of our party was there. I could see the table, which was set (for 10), so it wasn't like they were going to sit anyone else there...oh, and it was Tuesday, they weren't overly busy.

We sat at the bar ordered a beer, and a minute later, in comes my friend and the rest of the party. Close out one tab, move to the table...sheesh.

We ordered chips and salsa to start. The chips were also a mixed bag; some fresh, some hard, some chewy. The salsa's (red and green) had no kick and were too sweet.

The chicharrones are really tasty and go really well with a cold beer.

For dinner, I ordered the Carne Asada, Chorizo Y Papa and a Mula \"taco\".

We also asked for some hot sauce or salsa to put on the tacos. They brought out a small bowl of something red (not sure if they call it a sauce or a salsa), and this was rather tasty with a bit of heat...yaay! I wish their chip version was more like this.

The carne asada was problematic. My wife had it too and we both had too much gristle. The steak was fighting back and that is just no fun.

The chorizo was unique, unlike any I had tasted before. Pretty happy with this guy.

The Mula (supposed to be a protein between two \"crispy\" corn tortillas) came out so oily that when I picked it up, it drooped down. Tried a bite, but hadda send that one back. The waitress came back with a new one, plopped it down and said: \"here is your Extra crispy Mula\". Seriously?! That version was pretty tasty, except I also got the carne asada in that, so too tough.

We had the churro ice cream sandwich and that was really, really tasty. Crunchy with the melty ice cream. Big enough to share as well.

We may go back, but won't go out of our way, and certainly won't order the carne asada or the chips and salsa. The $2 tacos are cool as well, while the adult beverages are a tad on the pricey side."}
{"text":"First time here with the wife. We were greeted immediately upon coming in. Seated and immediately serviced. We tried had the happy hour nachos, as an appetizer, tried the El diablo Shrimp which definitely was spicy and no joke. Love the spicy food and this one got me good (in a good way). I also had the Carne Asada, and the Del Mar which also were great tasting. Good happy hour prices and we will be back to try their weekend brunches! Our server was great as well and food overall very tasty! Nice modern (no pun intended) restaurant!"}
{"text":"A refreshing west side restaurant with a great vibe. Servers and owner very pleasant,  signature margarita is very good.  Definitely potential for a successful business once the opening kinks are worked out. Recommend the guacamole sampler and shareable fries with salsa."}
{"text":"Went here for happy hour during the week and it was amazing.  Very good food and drinks.  I can't even pick out one thing to rave about because it wall all delicious.  This is a must try for the West siders and anyone visiting the hockey rink."}
{"text":"I'm giving this 4 stars because I'm generous. I don't necessarily want people to read this review and be turned off by it because this place has SO much potential. It's a newer place and there's so much more they can do to make it better. The place is honestly really cute. I loved the way it looked when I walked in. We went for lunch around 2 pm on a Saturday and it was pretty dead which i didn't expect from reading all the good reviews. We sat at the bar and ordered Cadillac margaritas which really are just the \"revolu margaritas\" on the drink menu. The margaritas were WONDERFUL. I have to say it was one of the best I've had. My boyfriend is the most picky human on the planet and even he agreed on that. As an appetizer we ordered the elote which is just Mexican corn and we ordered it off the cob so it came in a bowl. That was really good. Not amazing but we enjoyed it. For our meal we ordered street tacos... 3 carne asada and 3 al pastore. They looked delicious when they came out but I have to be honest... no flavor. It's like they didn't put any salt or pepper or anything on them. Very bland. I mean the meat was cooked perfectly...so tender. All it was lacking was flavor which was disappointing. If they seasoned the meat then it would have been a perfect experience because our bartender was super attentive and friendly and looked like she really enjoyed her job... the margaritas were the best part. After our first one we ordered another round but I ordered strawberry and my boyfriend ordered watermelon. Those were also out of this world. Pretty strong too!! I say this place has potential because it's literally right outside the P83 district and it's basically on the spring training field out there. If there is an owner or manager reading this... just add more flavor to your food please. If you do that, spring training will bring in serious money for you consistently. You have the right location, right staff and the right set up. And perfect margaritas. Just season your meat. That's literally your only big problem. I really hope this business succeeds I just had higher expectations for what we ended up paying for."}
{"text":"Underwhelming at best! The guacamole was very disappointing and for the price paid, I would have expected it be made tableside. The tacos were decent but very small. The setting is nice and the service is good but trust me there is nothing \"revolutionary\" about this restaurant and taqueria."}
{"text":"Loved the laid back atmosphere, the friendly service, and the food was awesome.  Get the churro-which for dessert!"}
{"text":"Only reason why it's not a 1 Star is because I spilled my beer and the manager was extremely helpful. Other than that the churro sandwich ice cream tasted like it was cooked in oil that needed to be changed. Extremely bitter tasting and definitely didn't taste like a churro. The rest of the food was ok. I wouldn't come back though."}
{"text":"Terrible service I would not recommend this place!!!! Our server and staff were horrible!"}
{"text":"Went on a Sat night, nice outside patio seating when the weather was cool. Nice alternative to chain restaurants in the Peoria area. Our server was attentive and the food was good. Had the street tacos, carne asada, al pastor, chicken tinga. Honey and I had 6 tacos, a beer and a specialty drink for $35 plus tip. Nothing spectacular but a good date night out. I'd check it out for the happy hour and/or all you can eat fish taco night. Drinks are on point if you like tequila and draft beer. The Mexican mule is my fav by far."}
{"text":"Hostess was great. Server was nice but doesn't know a thing about their drinks. Speaking of drinks, mixed drinks are HOT GARBAGE. That being said the beer was cheap and the street tacos were very good"}
{"text":"Best brunch happy hour, food in general!!!!! The owners are amazing +40 years combined in food business. Do yourself a favor and eat here!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place! The tacos were amazing I got almost all the tacos and they were delicious. The salsas as well! My husband got the ceviche and didn't like it"}
{"text":"This place was phenomenal! The chorizo y papa tacos stole my heart and the margarita was amazing as well! Our server was very bubbly and welcoming! We will definitely be back! Especially to try the churro ice cream sandwich dessert!!!"}
{"text":"Food was not good for the price. Won't be going back. 
I can tell where they're going with the concept because it reminds me of Joy Ride and Barrio Queen. Except, those establishments are way better for the same price range.

We ordered the chips n salsa, elote, and a variety of tacos. The chips tasted like stale store bought chips, salsa was okay, corn didn't have enough lime and mayo, tacos all were practically flavorless. My boyfriend ordered a michelada and it was $9 for a pint. Pretty steep for a Pacifico and spicy tomato juice. 

The atmosphere could be better too. I liked the decor, but the light bulbs gotta go. The lighting is so bright and neon white that it hurts. Service was good and quick."}
{"text":"I do not like puree in my drinks it was asked prior to ordering however his drink was good I just didn't like mine at all"}
{"text":"My new favorite place - I literally drove an hour to get here from Old Town Scottsdale, griping the whole way - now I can wait to go back. Michael, our server, was fantastic. Really friendly and accommodating. Super cute decor and patio. Food was phenomenal. I go out to dine a lot and this place scored high marks in every category. The al pastor, Potato Head and El diablo shrimp street tacos were a favorite at our table, along with all the small plates we tried (especially the crispy Brussel sprout dish) and Supa Fresca cocktail. Check this family owned establishment out for sure - you'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"Great food and  excellent service! The owner is very nice and genuine and the iced tea is dank!"}
{"text":"The food was good and they have some interesting drinks to try (I'm a sucker for specialty alcoholic drinks at new restaurants).

The somewhat open atmosphere, though, felt a little crowded. The waitstaff was great, the manager was great, I just wish they carved out more private areas for people instead of a bunch of four-tops right next to each other surrounding a bar."}
{"text":"We tried Revolu for the first time last night. My overall thoughts after leaving.... nothing stood out and the prices are high.  No Wow! factor on anything to make me want to return. The margaritas are served in small glasses and $10 each. The teeny-tiny street tacos are $5.00 each, and I have had way better. The guacamole and queso were just ok. The service was overall good. There are so many phenomenal Mexican restaurants in the area, will choose another next time."}
{"text":"Took a little bit to get our bearings - first time here after years of coming to Barrel Grill - and were unsure where to start. Owner Jerry suggested the Del Mar (beer battered fish) taco. The fish melted in my mouth. The carne asada taco, the staple, also was spectacular. Then there is the Queso-Taco - crispy, fried cheese surrounding a protein filling of your choice - we went with carne asada. Angels sang, children wept and all was perfect in the world.

Come here. Eat the Queso-Taco and realize how incredible life can be when wrapped in cheese and corn tortillas. For your sake, I beg you."}
{"text":"We hit happy hour. The carne Asada street tacos were delicious.  Not a great beer selection but they served flights of tequila.  Eeeek.  I would like to go back and try some different foods.  I will have to say that their barstools are the absolute worst. They are cheap metal barstools.......everybody was complaining about them and sliding off of them.  We would've definitely stayed longer if the seats weren't so miserable.  The service was average .....not fantastic but not terrible."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the street tacos. I have never had one. Prices were reasonable. Staff was friendly. Atmosphere was nice too. They have 2 patios. Tv's to watch the games and light music.  Not too loud so you can still talk. Food was delicious!!  We'll come back. Tucked away behind the ball park.  6 pm on a Thursday and lovely."}
{"text":"We loved it! Such a cool environment! The management and service was some of the best service we've ever had. The Diablo shrimp was crazy painfully spicy and couldn't finish it but everything else was great! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"First time visiting... food was very tasty and unique.   The street tacos were small for the price.  Happy hour nachos were very good for $5 small plate.  Kids cheese quesadilla was big and very cheesy.  Dessert was wonderful.  The downfalls were it was cold inside and it was on the pricey side.   Will go back again... loved the atmosphere."}
{"text":"My wife loved it (I can't handle even a little spice so I had to pass my tacos over to her) good choices and you can build your plate with different tacos and sides. I loved the rice and could honestly eat it as a meal"}
{"text":"Soooo food is good if you pick the right items, like tacos and tortas but the street corn nachos were bland. Food took 30 minutes which would have been okay if we would have gotten chips but they were an additional $3 - $5. Waitress was nice but took along time to be seated since no hostess. Manager only running around bussing tables. For better food and service go to Joyride Tacos."}
{"text":"My husband and I tried Revolu Modern Taqueria for our date night and loved it! Their red salsa and guacamole were great! We got their taco tray where you can mix and match different kinds. They have a selection of about 10 or so tacos. We tried carne asada, carnitas, al pastor, chicken tinga and chorizo with potato. Also got their ceviche which was super fresh and delicious! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome place to come have some yummy tacos and drinks! Great service every time I've been there!!"}
{"text":"Really modern atmosphere.  Upbeat inside.  Menu choices were good.  Enjoyed our evening!"}
{"text":"Great place, the margarita was excellent.  The staff was very friendly, service was great. The decor was very trendie and cool. We just for drinks, the food did look really good.  Will definitely go back to eat next time."}
{"text":"Amazing authentic food. Owner is friendly and interactive with employees and patrons. Staff is super friendly and efficient. The first time we visited the manager greeted us like we had been friends forever. We look forward to our taco Tuesdays!!"}
{"text":"All white place. Didnt see a single colored person besides me. The tacos were bland. You save only a dollar on taco Tuesday. Not worth $2. All they have is corn tortilla, no flour option.

 Also, got their \"pigs in a blanket\" hotdog, originally known as a sonoran dog. It was the WORST hotdog I've ever had. The weiner was burnt, like charred. The hot dog itself wasn't even an expensive hot dog. It tasted like the Bars hotdog you get at the grocery store for $1. The bacon was burnt on the dog AND it was in a TORTILLA LIKE A TACO?! Never in my life I've seen such blasphemy done to a sonoran dog. I asked the server if I could get another one cause it was burnt looking and she hesitated to take it back. The new one i got was a little better only because the hot dog wasn't burnt. 

They also charge $10 for the top shelf tequila when the bottle itself is only $60/70. Rip off.

Never coming back here again. Save your time and money!"}
{"text":"Had a wonderful birthday dinner, enjoyed the food, incredible green salsa, amazing egg chorizo, tacos were delicious too. This isn't the normal Mexican restaurant, very hip menu, a must try as you won't be disappointed, Kylie our waitress was very helpful when asked for recommendations, she told us to get the Big Balls, which were outstanding! Looking forward to going back again!"}
{"text":"Can you say \"awesome Mexican street food?!??\" Revolu didn't disappoint - tons of selection for an amazing price. Kids meals are huge and great, too! Everything I ate was amazing. I've already told everyone I know about this place. It's delicious and the restaurant is really cool inside- the decorating was done really well. Love this place!!"}
{"text":"Have been here several times now and it never disappoints!  Last night we went with a large party and the service was fantastic again!  The tacos are to die for and the green salsa is the best I've ever had!  I love this place!"}
{"text":"Great brunch ! Drink specials as well. 
Great twist on the original Mexican style.  Food was VERY tastey.  Drinks were delicious :) 

Service was great , seated promptly. Attentive waitress but not bothersome."}
{"text":"First time coming here, and it was amazing. I got 4 different tacos and my boyfriend got 4 as well. I was not disappointed. The el diablo is very spicy but good. The verde salsa was one of the best I've had. You have to get the elote though, best I've had!!!"}
{"text":"We had high hopes but were extremely disappointed with our first encounter at Revolu. We went for lunch on the Wednesday after Christmas and had heard good things. The employee who greeted us upon entering seemed disinterested to say the least as he said no more than two words, \"how many?\" No welcome or greeting upon entering, kind of a bad first impression. Ordered chips and salsa and some guacamole to start. We received the chips and salsa and noticed that more than half of the \"chips\" were broken into smaller crumb portions. I don't mind paying for chips and salsa but at least provide ample chips. They did rectify once made aware but it should have never left the kitchen. 

After almost 10 minutes of waiting for our server to return, we finally ordered. Select tacos, rice and a salad completed our order. All in our party agreed that the tacos lacked flavor and the salad was fairly typical; nothing amazing.

The rice and guacamole were exceptional. The service lacked. The margaritas were standard and left a lot to be desired. 

If I spend $100 on lunch for 3 people, it should be somewhat decent. There's potential but the food needs some assistance and the service needs a major overhaul."}
{"text":"Honest review.... good and bad things. First when we arrived we were told 30 min then 45 min... we had a sitter and only so much time so we were determined to eat here and not try to find another place. We were going to try for a seat at the bar. We got two drinks and within 10 minutes the hostess had a table for us. Thats great news... for us... but I noticed a few people didnt want to wait 45 min and left. Kind of a weird way to turn business away. Anyway got our seats. The guac is super bland but the salsas are really amazing and tasted fresh. The street corn was a little burnt and the corn tasted like it was from an old cob. We each ordered tacos and a side of chorizo beans. The beans are a little strange and the chorizo flavor is there but the texture is a little weird. The tacos were amazing minus the carne asada was also a little bland. The quesa-taco was the best, the al pastor and chicken tinga were great, the mula was really good, and we both ordered a carne but it was kinda boring. All in all we liked the place but the drinks are too much and we probably wouldnt be back unless its happy hour. We did really like our margaritas though. My husband got two revolu ritas and i got a La Sandia (watermelon margarita) and a Funky Fresa (Strawberr marg). House sour was delicious. We liked this place and will come back but only during happy hour. We dropped $95 for two people which is a little much for street tacos when there are so many great places for street tacos. $40 of that was drinks. But still.... you can get so many street tacos and I wasnt that wowed with it. I think the atmosphere is fun, loved the art, and music... and would come back at happy hour on a Taco Tuesday."}
{"text":"Tasty street tacos! We sampled 6 plus the Brussel sprouts appetizer. Next time we'll get the 10 taco tray. Love the ambience! Hope to try out the rest of the menu on repeat visits."}
