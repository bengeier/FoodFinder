{"text":"Located in a very touristy part of Old Montreal, this place is not only overpriced, but the food was incredibly disappointing. When seated we were not asked whether we would like to sit inside or outside and in the middle of a summer day, indoor would have been the way to go, but the hostess sat us right in the sun on their patio. I ordered a panini & my husband ordered a veggie pizza. While the panini wasn't awful it was definitely not worth 18 CAD. While it was served with fries, the panini was small and the fries tasted and looked like cheap fast food fries. The pizza was thin and boring with very few veggies on the pizza. We could have easily gone to Wendy's for fries and to the grocery to buy a frozen pizza and had the same experience. So if you are looking to waste money on obviously overpriced and cheaply made food, this is the place for you. The only thing this place has going for it is free WiFi."}
{"text":"This place reminds me...always check Yelp before being drawn in by outdoor dining and a guy playing guitar in the square nearby.  Drinks were 5 star. Really. Some delicious cocktails. However, the pizza was no better than frozen. We ordered a \"Margherita\" pizza that should have had Fresh Basil on it. Got a cheese pizza. When we asked, the waiter said, yeah they left the basil off. The pictures show how they took care of the situation. Totally a joke. Drink, don't eat."}
{"text":"Exactly.  Meh, I've experienced better.  I guess I should have read the reviews before coming here.  Food is below average for a restaurant.  More along the lines of grocery store hot table.  There are better places than to eat.  Happy hunting."}
{"text":"The food was absolutely fantastic. Margarita pizza and chicken Alfredo are not to be missed. The pitchers of magic sangria are also top notch. Although extremely busy with the Canadian grand prix crowd, they still had good service. At the end they sincerely apologized for the wait, which although not that long, was still greatly appreciated."}
{"text":"Great!  Good menu for all including children. Great service. Could eat inside or out in summer. We'd come back!  Excellent"}
{"text":"Great thin crust pizza. Not a lot to it but ingredients were fresh. We ordered one sausage pizza and plain cheese and they both were delicious!"}
{"text":"Ordered the board specials squid linguini and rigatoni bolengese .  Starter of salad and Soup which was excellent.  excellent.  Dinners very good. Service good.  The restaurant is lovely.  Great location."}
{"text":"The service is absolutely atrocious, I don't know if it was an American tourist issue or a plain bad experience, but do not come here!!!  The margarita pizza had zero basil, yet was described to have it and the white wine was barely chilled.  Hostess was very pleasant and nice and they had a 2 for 1 beer special, but that does not make up for the other issues, fail on fail on fail. It is my own fault for not listening to the other reviews to begin with.  Learn from me and stay away!  THESE MOTHER FU**ERS!!! The 2 for 1 drink special is $10... For coors light! GD it, I would never pay more then $5 for one of these anyways!   AHHHHHH hate being tricked, but hats off to them for being shady as sh!t"}
{"text":"Better than expected given other reviews.  Sat outside on a busy Friday afternoon.  The waiter was arrived within a reasonable time, took our drink orders, and told us about the specials.  We ordered appetizers and drinks.  I will state that although the red sangria taste good it is a bit sweeter than I had expected. The bruschetta got raves reviews and ehh reviews at our table.   It had too much onion flavor for my daughter but I really liked it.  The poutine was pretty good.  Different than I had expected but good.  We had a variety of dishes at out table from Lasagna and linguine to pizza. Food arrived about in about the right time. My linguine with tomato sauce was very tomatoey.  Not spicy but some crushed red peppers fixed that.  One daughter got the margarita pizza was very tasty although a bit oily.  My other daughter got lasagna and was surprised by the many thin layers.  It must have been good because she was definitely a member of the clean plate club.  My wife had the black olive pizza.  It was less oily than the margarita pizza and she seemed to enjoy it.  I would note that it took a bit of time to get the check so you may want to call the waitstaff over a bit before you actually want to go."}
{"text":"We were seated and forgotten about.  We waited and waited.....walked out.  Our waitress just stared. Crap place! Please don't waste your time here."}
{"text":"Not bad. Had the pasta with rapini and sausage and it was pretty good. A tad pricey for the quality but hey, you are in Pl. Jacques Cartier, heart of old Montreal. Get to enjoy the scenery and entertainment at same time."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was beautiful. Service accommodating considering we did have 4kids with us. The meatballs and pasta fagioli were good. Ordered limoncello which tasted like Lysol cleaner. Watered down Sangria and $12 glass of Woodbridge! I hope this place can get it together considering the location."}
{"text":"This is probably the worst Italian restaurant I've ever eaten at. The food was definitely overpriced for the quality of its food. I didn't finish half my plate. Also, they charged everyone at my table an extra $2.50 for Parmesan on the side without giving notice for the charge. Most Italian restaurants I go to tend to not charge a fee for Parmesan on pasta. In addition, they had asked if I wanted cheese on my ravioli and it ended up being basically a baked lasagna. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone.  Definitely a tourist trap...placed in a very convenient location."}
{"text":"The nicest owners ever - they opened there doors to us and we're incredibly great. They made espresso martinis just for us. The music is great and the food too - go and meet donato he and his family will treat you like theirs."}
{"text":"Lovely meal in a perfect location. We sat outdoors and enjoyed a beautiful July evening. The house made pappardelle pasta was spectacular!"}
{"text":"The service was terribly slow.  My lasagna was okay.  No garlic bread or salad.  Would not go there again."}
{"text":"Horrible.  Food is gross.  Overpriced and slow service.   Avoid at all cost.  The lights went out during my dinner and they did not do anything about.  I complained about the lights going out, the food being subpar and I got the run around that my complaint was lost in translation.   So dissapointed.  Let this review be a warning to anyone considering eating here."}
{"text":"I do not leave comments often, but for an experience this poor I felt it was necessary. We waited 20-30 minutes between interactions with our waiter. Our drinks were empty for 10-15 minutes a time. My wife's food specifically said it came with 4 shrimp. When it arrived, it had 0 shrimp.   Ambience is nice, locations is perfect, but the service could not be worse. Only reason I'm giving 1 star is because I can't leave 0 and the food was actually decent."}
{"text":"This place was good. We went there for dinner on a Saturday night and got seated quickly. We got to sit outside and enjoy the music.   We started with the bruschetta and calamari. Loved the bruschetta but the calamari had a little too much pepper for my taste. My brother got the pesto pasta with chicken, my parents both got pizzas and I got the seafood linguini. Everything was decent. I think I expected a different sauce for my pasta as it was just a regular tomato sauce but overall, no complaints."}
{"text":"The only thing good about this place was the flavor of the food. The service, however, was H-O-R-R-I-B-L-E !   First, we had a reservation and were seated inside WITH NO ONE TO WAIT ON US. 2) When someone finally came 30 mins after we were seated we were told \"I didn't see you\". 3) After being asked for our drink order we were then pressured for our food order. 4) even though only 2 of us ordered drinks it took over 10 minutes to receive a glass of wine and a cappuccino! By this point, we were being serviced by 3 separate people.   Now the food starts arriving. We got our appetizer...GREAT Flavor . Then the main course. Again, wonderful flavor. However, one in our party mistakingly ordered the wrong dish as he doesn't eat ham and didn't realize the the dish he ordered had ham in it. He was so afraid to say something to Maria, who we thought was the manager, due to fear of waiting even longer to eat that he kept his mouth shut and tried to pick out all the meat. After 20 minutes I had to get up and pull Maria aside and ask her to help him, explaining to her his mistake and his fear of going another 40 mins without his food.   HERE'S WHERE the kitchen almost got an unwelcome visit from me looking for the owner, who Maria claimed was her brother. Instead of graciously apologizing for the level of service and offering to make my party member comfortable, Maria came over to the table and told my friend that she was going to take his meal off the menu and replace it. However, she then went out of her way to explain to him that it was HIS ERROR because the dinner was described as having ham on the menu. She then disappeared into the kitchen and returned a few moments later saying \" I talked to the owner, who is my brother, and we are definitely going to remove that item from your bill but please remember the menu clearly said it had ham in it\". We thanked her and kept our mouths shut, my friends new meal came out and he began to eat. Then the bill came. Guess what?!?! The old meal was replaced with the new one....not removed.  Then, to make life more difficult, when Maria ran my credit card, she proceeded to ask me OUT LOUD IN FRONT OF EVERYONE within ear-shot of our table ,\" Do you know there is no tip included in your payment\"?! At that point I almost ripped Maria a new one. I have never met such a classless individual as that and never have I ever had such a horrible experience in what really should be a wonderful establishment.   The wine was very good, ALL THE FOOD had wonderful flavor but the service.....frankly, this place does not deserve to be open with service like that. You treat patrons with respect, you don't make them wait, you don't ignore them after you seat them and you certainly don't blame them when the food, for WHATEVER REASON is not satisfactory. I felt horrible when I left Maria a $10 tip, not because it was only half of what she normally would have gotten from me but because she didn't deserve any tip and worse, it cost me $4 in fees to change the original $20 bill into Canadian money so that I could have cash for a tip to begin with.   So, you want good food at a decent price that you have to wait HORRIFICALLY long for and put up with terrible wait staff? THIS IS DEFINITELY THE PLACE TO TAKE YOUR DATE, SPOUSE OR FAMILY TONIGHT, it's sure to leave a lasting impression."}
{"text":"I don't know why this place has bad service reviews. My server and host were attentive. I didn't have to look far to find them. I had the chicken Alfredo which was good and filling.  I ordered a Heineken pitcher, it wasn't that great."}
{"text":"I had supper this evening at Trattoria Gio.  It was really warm but nice so I sat on the patio and I wasn't the only one with the same idea.  There was entertainment on the square just outside the restaurant.  I ordered lasagna.  It was hearty and just okay.  Tatiana was my server.  She was friendly and helpful and took good care of me."}
{"text":"It all starts with the hostess. Not very welcoming or friendly.  Well maybe that's just her personality. Ok so hopefully the food is better. We order the calamari to start and also a pizza, seafood linguini, lasagna, crab ravioli, risotto and a salad.  The calamari came over cooked, but we we were hungry so we sucked it up and ate it. The main dishes took forever to come out and there were barely any customers in the restaurant so there was no excuse for taking so long.  The food finally came out and was just mediocre at best.  I would not recommend this restaurant unless all other restaurants are closed."}
{"text":"Seated in the heart of old town Montreal, this restaurant looks like a grand place to dine and smells like a tourist trap.  The food is expensively price especially for what it is.    My adventure starts with 10 of us at a table outside.  It took 15 minutes for us to get our orders taken and then another 10 minutes for us to get some glasses of water.  Maybe it's slow or maybe this is just how the do here in Montreal.  Either way me no likey.    I ordered the seafood pasta.  It came out like Prego on Barilla pasta with little rubber balls that were \"seafood\" scraps.  Needless to say, I was not pleased.  However, the waiter kindly offered to switch the pasta for something else -- a pizza that was actually pretty darn good.  Oh yea my buddy ordered an apple juice that had a fly in it and they replaced it with a gingerale??  My advice?  Pasta is a no go.  Pizza is solid.  Service leaves something to be desired.  Overall still a place you can stop by with a nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Yes I'm an American in Montreal. Yes I like cocktails/good food.  Husband wanted to taste Canadian smoked meat sandwich an it was their special.  Turns out it's American corned beef,  Yes it was very tasty but still just corned beef.  My prosciutto  pannini was lightly toasted, not pressed an had 2 slices of meat.  Paid $9 for decent martini but the $12 for their  \"long island iced tea\" was over the top. It was one ounce of vodka an lots of coke!.  Yes it did have great location, free music from street performer was nice as was the wifi. Lesson learned,  order beer or martinis!  Just my opinion."}
{"text":"Excellent pasta!! The sangria was wonderful and refreshing! The pesto was very good and the spinach ravioli was very flavorful. Ambience of sitting in the plaza is great too!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place. The bartender, Boris was on point and the manager, Julien (Jules) was very cool and accommodating.  I had their poutine, which was little fried potato dumplings instead of fries and it was delicious."}
{"text":"People enjoy the terrace that's all , food is very very very but very bad , frozen chicken in fettuccini , pizza is disgusting it looks and tastes like frozen pizza , pastas are tasteless manager is very nice person  and the location of the restaurant is one of the best but it does not really matter when you sell low quality processed food and hire none qualifying so called waitresses your restaurant will never ever have good reviews.this kind of restaurants don't care about customer satisfaction they are there just to make quick buck during the summer season that's all , most of the restaurants   in this location in old montreal changes ownership quite often why? Because they don't care about customer satisfaction and quality that's why. We will never ever go here again."}
{"text":"il posto è bellissimo il suono è fresco !! piatti sono grandi e niente di più!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Yikes.  This is what happens when you have no cell service and can't read reviews prior to dining in a new area.  We stumbled into this place based on one factor, only restaurant in area to have a/c on a very muggy night.  We paid for the coolness.   Pizza was a notch above grocery store frozen.  Ordered a margharita and got a plain cheese.  Salad was lettuce and dressing.  No shaved Parmesan, cracked pepper, etc.   Raviolis would give Chef Boyardee a run for his money.  They were horrible.  Needless to say, wish we would have saved $60 and eaten at McDonald's instead."}
{"text":"Enjoy the service and the view.  The food, on the other hand, is not very good.  Vegetable lasagna: Limp vegetables, heavy sauce.  Calamari: Rings only and no flavor.  Seafood linguini: Like the above dishes, wasn't fresh at all.  The location is good as well as the service."}
