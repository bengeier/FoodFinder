{"text":"Went here today (Saturday) at about 1pm.  The place was empty except for one patron picking up a take-out order.   While we ate, there was one other table of 3 that came in.   This was the major concern about this place....no business!   My companion had a bowl of shrimp and scallop soup ($8.99), while I had the Japanese style pork ramen ($6.99).   The portions were hearty, noodles were fresh and taste was fine.  Hopefully they have more business at night, otherwise this place will not last.   We note that this same location has experienced at least 2 previous restaurant closures in the past couple years.  Overall ok, but unlikely we will be in a hurry to return."}
{"text":"$2 for a bottle of beer?! I guess I am IN!  Tea & Kitchen just opened up on Steeles between Kennedy and Birchmount has a really mixed menu that has items from Chinese and Japanese cuisine.   Fook Chow Style Fish Ball Noodle ($6.99) took forever to arrive, as the kitchen seems to be busy with some private function. The ramen Noodle with fish balls has this milky white fish broth definitely a A OK!!   A good place for cheap beers and snacks as it opens till 12 AM.   I will be back!!"}
{"text":"It was 3pm.  I thought we could have snacks with milk tea at a restaurant with the word \"tea\" in its name.  This was not a correct assumption.  Tea and Kitchen is not a Hong Kong tea cafe.  The menu was full of dinner items.    We ordered a papaya bubble tea, a jelly fish appetizer and a sticky rice balls with mango appetizer.  The best one was the sticky rice balls.  It came with 3 sweetened sticky rice balls and a few slices of mango.  They were delightful with a good mix of sweet (rice balls) and sour (mango slices) flavors.  Both the jelly fish and the bubble tea were disappointing.  The drink was a bit powdery since there was papaya powder not melted in the drink.  The jelly fish was in slices not stripes. The slice were in a soy sauce and sesame oil.  The slices were crunchy; it took a bit of work to chew them.  We supposed the chef created this dish from a jelly fish head.  I don't know if we would return for dinner (maybe, maybe not).  I know for sure we won't return for afternoon snack."}
