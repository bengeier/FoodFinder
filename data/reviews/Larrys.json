{"text":"This is a new place from the Lawrence gang, who have a restaurant and a butcher shop in the same block. Larrys is smaller, with smaller plates, all-day breakfast and great coffee. I ate here with a few friends one early afternoon and was very pleased I could order off the night menu AND the breakfast menu. We got a bunch of things to share, which was ideal as breakfast is served family-style. Our server(who I recognized from Lawrence brunch) knew the menu pretty well but failed to mention this point, so some of my friends were put off by the fact that they didn't get their individual breakfasts all together on their own plate. Aside from this minor point everything was great. We shared the cabbage rolls, mussels with spicy tomato sauce, salami, fried eggs, toast and a vinegary cucumber salad. It came out to about 100$ for 3 of us including coffees and tip. They charged us for bread but it was really good so I didn't mind so much. I can see why some people think it's expensive but I can't really think of anything else like it in Montreal. Can't wait to try it for dinner!"}
{"text":"Service impécable,
Plats délicieux et fins,
Ambiance calme et feutré.
Un vrai plaisir."}
{"text":"J'ai découvert ce resto par hasard, en cherchant un endroit où souper tôt et rapidement dans le mile-end. J'ai adoré sur toute la ligne. Gaspacho et tartare de bar, les deux étaient excellents, juste le bon dosage de rassurant et de nouveauté. Très bon équilibre des saveurs et textures. Beau décor en plus!"}
{"text":"Hey Keaton,

Miss you a lot at myriade, how are you? I'm fine, today I went to Old Montreal and it was okay. It's pretty great that it's almost Spring, how about this winter! I went to Larrys today again but I didn't have two breakfast sandwiches just one. Say hi to Ethan for me. Best,

PS: Yelp me when you want to hang"}
{"text":"Looked cute and stopped in for a drink. We each ordered a glass of wine. Waitress asked us what we were ordering for food and I said oh no thanks we just ate. She said you have to order food. And I said well we aren't hungry can we order the nuts? She said you have to order at least 3 things. What? I'm not ordering three things when I literally just ate. We then said should we just leave then? She went and talked to the manager and said we could stay. Yeah after that felt real welcome. She said they aren't a wine bar well guess what on yelp you are and in the US that means you can simply enjoy a glass of wine. Very rude and unwelcoming. Situation should have been handled differently. And if you are so worried about your liquor license maybe you should of carded me."}
{"text":"Everything on the menu is tasty. All the drinks are good. The coffee is stellar. It is super cozy. The waiters are friendly. The dish washer is hot. It's open all the time. What's not to like?"}
{"text":"Great food and excellent service sums up this review! I came here with my son based on a recommendation from his roommate. Their menu has a flair towards southern cuisine elevated by a few levels.  Since we were there for brunch, I ordered the heirloom tomato salad which consisted of the freshest home grown tomatoes that I haven't had in a long time with fried bread. The flavors were amazing. Then I tried their mashed potatoes mixed with cabbage and fried in lard... simply tasty but not greasy. The fact that they serve small plates - tapas style - you get a treat without over indulging, unless you order another plate! For a place that was so crowded, the service was great. I eat out a lot because I travel. This place should definitely be listed as a go to spot on TripAdvisor because it's a gem that everyone should get a chance to enjoy."}
{"text":"The most adorable tapas cafe in Montreal. In a quiet corner off Saint-Laurent, Larrys is a cozy cafe great for a date or dinner with friends. 

I went with my boyfriend and another couple and we shared the bread which was fresh and soft, carrots with muhammara, heirloom tomatoes, corn bread with succotash, cauliflower, beef tartare, tuna ceviche, eggplant with zaatar, chicken liver toast, tangerine creme and peanut butter chocolate tart. All items were tasty and different. We loved the variety in cuisines, textures, and spices. My favorites were the carrots and eggplant, but would definitely order all again. 

We also tried an orange wine which we learned about in Montreal. It's similar to a rose in that the wine rests for a short time on the skins of the grape, but it has a deeper taste that has a red wine mouth feel. Would recommend trying one if you haven't. 

Enjoy larrys for us!!"}
{"text":"I once found a pube in my change. No big deal. Still a great spot to work and eat for cheap. Varied menu and tasty coffee!"}
{"text":"I wanted to like it. I really wanted to like it. But sadly, Larry's did not give me that tingly feeling. 

The good:
The space is very nice. It's small, but optimally designed to feel cozy. It also attracts a fun and trendy crowd, so the vibe is nice. 

The drink menu is pretty good, I enjoyed a delicious cocktail and the others seemed to like the beer choices. 

The bad:
The food I tried was nothing worth mentioning. In fact, the chocolate cake even seemed like it might be a Costco cake, for which they charged $8 a piece. Not impressed with this. 

The ugly:
We showed up for drinks at 10pm. They sat us down and only brought the drink menu. So we ordered and that was that. Then, 20 minutes later they showed up with the food menu. And just left it on the table. When we said we weren't planning on eating, they suddenly told us we'd all need to order at least one plate each as they do not have a bar license. Without any previous warning, and now with drinks in hand, we really did not have any choice. It would definitely have been nice for them to mention this from the outset - this would have been the right thing for the staff to do. 

So without any real choice in the matter, we ordered and my husband asked for the cheese (which on the menu says $5 per piece). No one asked him how many pieces or what kind of cheese. They just showed up with 3 kinds and charged him $15. Again, it would have been appreciated for the staff to ask how many pieces and what kinds, no? 

We left feeling like we had a great night with friends, despite the deceiving restaurant and service."}
{"text":"It was super spontaneous when I decided to come to Larrys for brunch. Lawrence was going under renovations so Larrys was next best option. Their breakfast is served tapas style. They are all smaller dishes and it's a great place to order a whole bunch of items on the menu and share them. It does add up (price) but it's worth it. Their scrambled eggs are amazing; they are super runny and way different what you would expect. Their king oyster mushrooms are soooo good. I don't know what they serve underneath the mushrooms but its heavenly. Their toast is also really good, but they do put a lot of butter on it. The place is super small, so it's not ideal for groups. The wait wasn't too bad but it's best if you go early."}
{"text":"Cozy, comfy, and remarkably consistent! 

Larry's is open all day, every day, and whether you're stopping for a coffee, a quick bite, or to dine and drink, you're surely guaranteed to enjoy a wonderful experience! Dishes are on point, staff is friendly, and the ambiance is absolutely charming.

Here's a tip: early Saturday and Sunday mornings are a good time to lounge, enjoy a perfectly executed breakfast, sip from a warm cup of coffee and and take the time to breathe right. A secret retreat for some \"me time\" or perfect spot to meet up with friends! Note to young parents, bring your babies & kids - they'll enjoy the company.

Depending on when you come, you'll meet Kim at the barista station, efficient Camille or kind and attentionate Lisa to help you order.

Here you'll be served coffee made from the Heart Roasters based out of Portland OR. Even though the CAD-USD currency exchange rate is currently pretty horrible, the owners nonetheless make the effort to bring us the good quality beans while maintaining at very reasonably priced cup of coffee.

Tucked in the back are 'Fearless & Feminine' chef Mary and 'Born to Cook' chef Korlin who deliver an unstoppable amount of appealing and amazing tasty dishes from the tiniest and most optimized kitchen ever - pay attention to details such as the small racks of eggs and spice containers magnetically attached to the vent.

If you get there early enough you can witness the transformation of little white pale balls of dough into golden and delicious English muffins that make the base of the succulent breakfast sandwiches. Bubbles are mashed potatoes combined with grilled leaks. Mushrooms are sautéed with chives and butter. Eggs are prepared your way, with thick bacon or crispy sausage and toasted buttered square bread. Scrambled eggs are simply divine - creamy, buttery, rich and slightly runny! 

For lunch or later, try the spaghetti, cucumber salad, tomato salad, pork chop, or creamed cabbage all sure hits but I must confess and have yet to try the rest of the menu and indulge in some wine and cocktails. Who knows, you might catch me there one of these evenings!"}
{"text":"Creamy cabbage! Creamy cabbage! Creamy cabbage! The best cabbage I've ever had! The fish tartare was good too. The place is homey and the service was really good. One not-so-good thing was that I wanted to order soy latte but they said they didn't have soy so I ordered regular latte."}
{"text":"i literally wanna shed a tear cause theres nowhere in nyc that serves bubbles and squeek. its the perfect perfect lil breakfast w a fried egg. & the staff is lovely. ill def go back like every morning when i hit montreal again."}
{"text":"Went there twice for lunch. Hard to decide from the chalk board menu what to order, but it doesn't seem like one can go wrong with anything. High quality food, fresh, and it is kind of tapas style, so you can mix and match! I have to try the coffee and baked goods that life ok fresh and delicious, but with 2 small plates, I feel full. The one drawback is that it is on the expensive side, so I wouldn't go every week."}
{"text":"Spent our last night in Montreal at Larry's and it could not have gone better. Very nice space, helpful and welcoming staff, and the food was some of the best in the city. Have something simple like the spaghetti and you still will not be disappointed. Eggplant and prosciutto toast are possibly the best items on the menu."}
{"text":"La réputation de ce resto ne fait aucun doute!
Les plats sont de petites tailles (de type tapas) ce qui vous permettra de goûter à plusieurs choses..
Nous avons essayé: champignons, patates frites, patates et fromages dans l'huile, pain de mais, saucisses, bubble and squeak (pommes de terre pilées avec chou), oeuf et bacon, et enfin les petites crèpes (pikelets) et TOUT était un véritable délice! Les plats sont vraiment raffinés et cuisinés de façon que ça a beaucoup de goût!
A noter, quand nous y sommes allées (un dimanche matin), il n'y avait qu'une sorte de jus: pomme. Sinon, il y a des cafés (toutes sortes je crois?).
L'endroit est assez petit, et souvent plein, alors attendez vous à attendre 30mn pour une table (mais ça vaut la peine!).
Idéalement, y aller entre 2 et 4 (pour + que 4, je pense que c'est compliqué d'organiser une table et vous pourrez attendre longtemps..).
Excellent service, excellent rapport qualité-prix.
A essayer!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant! Everything I ate there was well thought out... The polenta was savory and creamy, the steak was perfectly seasoned. The portions were slightly larger than a tapas size. Only thing that was not so stellar was dessert. Should have gone across the street to get some Kem Coba ice cream! I strongly recommend checking this little place out!"}
{"text":"Wow, the food here was amazing. I came in the mid-afternoon for lunch and ordered skate wing and a winter salad. It did take a long time (like 45') for the food to arrive (including the salad) but it was well worth waiting for. The roasted skate wing was totally delicious--fresh, sweet, well seasoned. The salad was a wonderful inventive combination of crunchy winter vegetables in a beautiful presentation, lightly dressed with a perfect French vinaigrette. I wish it wasn't on the other side of town from my hotel--I would have tried it for brunch and dinner! Happy eating to others."}
{"text":"This place was great. Really good latte and delicious breakfast sandwich. Great service and atmosphere. Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"This is a tiny breakfast and coffee bar next to Lawrence which is more of a regular sit down.  Both are owned by the same proprietor and have similar food.  DL on Larry's.  

+.  Ambiance is small and more intimate that was appealing. Elevated and Open kitchen in the back. Breakfast Bar with ~6 -8 seats and a few tables with ~ 8-12 seats.  It's small but perfect size.

+.  Food is limited breakfast, pastries and caffe.  I had my scone, 2 fried eggs and a doppio.  Everything was good.  Scones I discovered that I like French style but not British.  Espresso was strong, smooth and mellow - perfect.  Eggs came out heavily seasoned and oiled but tasted good.  

+. I sat at the bar and the service from 2 ladies were friendly and prompt.

+. Price Was reasonable.

+. Parking is street and on Saturday AM, I found one just down the block.

I enjoyed my AM shots and breakfast.  It was not rushed but efficient service.  Yep, I'd happily visit Larry's again!"}
{"text":"Have been here three times. Twice for date nights. Love the cosy intimate vibe. Once on a Saturday night (busy, lively) and once on a Monday night (super chill). The other time for just a glass of wine and dessert on a Thursday night (busy but seated right away). 
Love the casual but sophisticated atmosphere. Love the concept of small sharing plates as you get to work your way through the menu. The portions are good for 2-3 people max so not great for big groups if everyone wants to try. I'd say it's on the pricier side for the size of portion you get although ingredients are always fresh and each dish is carefully thought out and delicious. For one of the meals between two hungry people: seabass ceviche, tuna tartare, crab toast (this one is piled high), the aubergine cassoulet, potatoes, lamb cabbage rolls. Everything was delicious, really enjoyed. Would be interested in returning more frequently if their menu changed more often so could try more things. Staff was informative about the food and able to describe the items on the menu in detail and clearly know about the food. This always helps. It shows they care about the food they're serving and this goes a long way!

*UPDATE* had a couple more meals i couldn't fault! Bingo! All the above still applies yet an added star as I think they have become more generous with their portions. 3 people: 3 glasses of wine, 2 cocktails, maybe 5-6 sharing dishes - we were full and happy! Around $50 per person. I'd say for a quality meal with exceptional service it's an easy 5star! It's local, independent - i struggle to fault it."}
{"text":"On a try as much as possible food adventure in Montreal this made the grade 3 times in 4 days. It's that good. 
From the cognac that shares my mother's maiden name (which had the server greet me as Madame Pinard from then on) to the great coffee everything is well done. 
Had breakfast to lunch here and the scrambled eggs are amazing traditional rillettes to an outstanding tuna ceviche and whelks.  There's something for anyone here (not a lot that's vegan tho) but it's encouraged to share and always seemed busy.
I'm already sad to have left."}
{"text":"There have been few meals in my life where from the start to finish of the meal I wasn't disappointed with a certain dish being that I usually order extensively.  I don't even like breakfast as a meal that much but Larrys showed me that it can indeed be my favorite meal.  I ordered the smoked sturgeon, scrambled eggs, toast, bubble+squeak, kale and white bean soup, and sausage.  Everything was spectacular. The smoked sturgeon drizzled with olive oil was supremely rich in flavor and texture without the dryness due to oversmoking/cooking.  The scrambled eggs were perfectly cooked and seasoned being slightly wet and luscious. The sausage was so succulent and soft I almost thought it was undercooked but it wasnt. I've never encountered bubble and squeak before but it turned out to be a skillet crisped mixture of potatoes and cabbage that was the embodiment of heaven.  With the day being so cold the soup gave my body the rejuvenating warmth it desperately needed and made my knees quiver with the sublime richness on the palate most vegetable soups are loathe to fulfill. Needless to say o will be going back there tomorrow and vainly wish this restaurant was in my hometown of new York city. So far this is the only restaurant in montreal that I wish this of. I am of a mind to steal those two ladies running the kitchen for my own restaurant in manhattan. Go. Now."}
{"text":"Sexy vibe. Tasty, innovative food.  Don't go here, you might take my spot at the bar."}
{"text":"Super bon bacon !! Vrm un petit endroit très bien , le service est super et le personnelle a l'air passionné"}
{"text":"Stopped in with friends while on vacation for pre-dinner cocktail. It's very small and cosy inside. We each ordered a couple of drinks, the standout was the egg nog (which was a holiday special). We also ordered some snacks. The mussels in cider were delicious, but their cauliflower was amazing, a definite must try. 
If you're in the area, would of definitely stop in for a drink or a meal."}
{"text":"Larry's serves up a truly beautiful all-day breakfast. The scrambled eggs are unlike any I've ever had...so deliciously smooth and creamy. I paired that with a perfect breakfast sausage and addictive grilled mushrooms. Magnifique!

I also shared pikelets with my dining companion to start the meal...they're kinda like biscuit/crumpet/pancakey type things, served with maple syrup. Needless to say, all of the above was too much food for one breakfast and by the end I was busting at the seams. But in the best possible way. And the service was exceptionally friendly. Well done Larry!"}
{"text":"I am currently sitting at the bar after an americano & a meal. Here. We. Go:

Coffee - 100% yes, sign me up Larry! 
Music - a delightful fiddle.
Staff - Sweet as pie.
Food - Tasty, humble and fresh (Its part of the Lawrence family so that's a given). Also tapas style.
Price - Unjustified, bougey prices for very humble and VERY small dishes. It makes you wonder if they think the customer will pay anything. It is almost offensive.

A tiny bowl of pasta should NEVER be $10. My nonna is doing back-flips in her grave. I don't care if the water usedto boil it was blessed by the Pope himself. Take the 55 down to Little Italy and get a real bowl worth your hard earned $$. 

2 cabbage rolls the size of a thumb are $9. Major thumbs down to that.

Being tapas style, if the expectation is for people to order a bunch of small things to share, the menu pricing is treating the customer like fools. It hurts to experience this and say this because I am a BIG fan of all the places within the Lawrence \"family\".

But that said, the prices are unjustified. 
We're not stupid. We are hungry. 

Ill be back for coffee and meet you at Sparrow/Lawrence for a meal."}
{"text":"I came here with my mom on a Monday afternoon--the truth is, I meant to take her to Lawrence but it's closed on Mondays. Oops. We were met with young, friendly staff and our waitress in particular was very sweet and attentive, knowledgable a of everything on the menu and really on top of things; sometimes you get waiters or waitresses who can't handle too much information or don't really \"care.\" Anyway, just like its sister (or I should say brother) restaurant, the food here--and I mean each and every individual dish from start to finish--was GOOD. Plates were perfect sizes for sharing and we were happy with our meal. It wasn't cheap (over $100 for two people for a few plates and a couple of beers) but you should know that coming into your meal. Quality of food was excellent and I am happy to call this restaurant a neighbourhood must."}
{"text":"Just updating to say that this place has only gotten better, amazing vegetarian dishes that taste indulgent and cosy and awesome and filling and are affordable. Impeccable wine selections. So freaking cosy."}
{"text":"Quoique Larry's est ouvert toute la journée, mes visites se font habituellement en soirée. C'est l'endroit idéal pour prendre un verre et déguster des petites bouchées entre amis. La nourriture est très bonne et on reconnaît la même qualité que chez le voisin d'à côté (le restaurant grand frère, Lawrence).

C'est petit et cozy, et le staff s'y connait vraiment en ce qui à trait la sélection de drinks, vins et bières. Par contre, c'est un peu cher pour de si petites portions de bouffe. N'arrivez pas avec le ventre complètement vide, la facture risque de monter très rapidement."}
{"text":"I came here for a casual, late-ish dinner and was quite impressed. The space is small and busy. The wine list is robust and the food is good. It's small plates, so it's perfect to share with some friends. We did fish tartare, pork, mushrooms and a few others. It won't blow you away with inventiveness, but it is good food done well."}
{"text":"Had a great late / light lunch here after coming down from Mont Royal. Flavours were quite innovative for dishes such as the broccoli but they all went well together.

I like the vibe of this place too."}
{"text":"Mon avis est un peu mitigé concernant le Larry's... On M'avait beaucoup parlé de ce brunch pour le cadre, le gout et les produits... c'est peut etre parce que j'en attendais plus mais j'ai été décu. 
Le cadre est sympa certes mais c'est petit. 

Le service et souriant et sympa

Coté nourriture c'est un peu moins bien. Je regrette que pour un brunch il n'y ait pas de menu brunch. En fait tout est a la carte. En prenant le sandwich déjeuné à 9$ je pensais avoir de quoi manger mais franchement c'est un peu limite pour ce prix la. Certes la carte est grande et il y a de quoi manger mais pour avoir l'équivalent en quantité d'autre restaurant il vous faudra mettre 2 fois plus cher je pense. Coté goût c'était bon franchement mais ca s'arrête la pour moi. A oui le café n'est pas trop cher mais il n'est pas à volonté."}
{"text":"We decided to check out Larry's for a quick drink before our dinner at Hôtel-Herman. I've never been to Lawrence or Sparrow (their sister restaurants) but Larry's had a very cool, chic look to it.

The plan was to grab a drink but we were told by the staff that they don't have a full bar license here. Meaning if you want to drink, you have to order two dishes each or if you're a couple, three. Never heard of that requirement before - I can understand having to order one dish but having to order more than that? No thanks. We skipped on both those options and ended up sharing a beef tartare.

A peek into their open kitchen. Two chefs were hard at work when we arrived.

We sat at the bar. I've never been to a place in Montreal where it was so Anglophone. Interesting/different vibe here...

They had a tray of pickled goods. Those pickles look scrumptious.

Menu is a simple one pager with no descriptions. Very hipster. They do have some interesting things on the menu.  Would have loved to try the escabeche, brook trout and ox tongue.

- Pink limoncello - can't remember exactly what this was but pretty sure it was non-alcoholic. Light, refreshing summery drink.

- Beef tartare ($14.00 large) - the tartare was really nice with a raw egg yolk on top. Wish they weren't so stingy with the bread portions. Why do all restaurants seem to do that???  Besides that, the beef was nicely seasoned and fresh. A bit overpriced for the portion size but that seems to be the trend here.

I wasn't thrilled with their drinking policy. Maybe put up a sign to inform customers about that? Can't be that difficult right?"}
{"text":"We went here 2x on a long weekend to Montreal it is delicious! Great service. I would for sure return."}
{"text":"We had the most delicious lunch. The vegetables were so fresh and sweet. The tomato salad and the corn was amazing. Cucumber salad great. Just fresh and nicely, simply prepared."}
{"text":"Toujours aussi mignon comme son prédécesseur Sardines.

Les plats sont savoureux. Nous avons pris le boudin et les aubergines. 2 plats succulents.
Un peu moins aimé le plat de poireaux, raisins et feta par contre.

Service amical en général.

Excellent pain frais!"}
{"text":"Larry's is one of my favourite spots in Montreal. Everything on their menu is absolutely delicious, and they have SO much to choose from. It's a great place to go on a date or with a small group. It's a pretty small joint, they don't take reservations but I've been lucky enough to never have to wait for a table. It's dark and intimate, and the bring food out as its ready. For a tapas place in Montreal, Larry's has my heart as my favourite one. 

Whenever I go, I make sure to order the fllamkuken & beed tartare. Last time I went they had a fish of the day, and that was incredible."}
{"text":"Outstanding breakfast! My wife and I stumbled in quite famished after walking up from the river on a rainy Saturday morning only to realize the bagels shop didn't have seating ... I jumped on Yelp to find an alternative and Larry's fit the bill. The warm-up cappuccino was on point while we reviewed our options. The wife went for scrambled eggs and lox while I opted for buttered toast, eggs and mushrooms. My eggs were served sunny side up, cooked the way I like um (runny yoke with a set white) and perfectly seasoned. The mushrooms were cooked whole with herbs and butter--- super savory! The toast was equally tasty. The lox were tender and well balanced with a herby gently scrambled egg... I had a very nice cup of perfectly roasted black drip coffee to wrap the meal. The place is intimate and the staff was kind. There were a couple of families with well mannered small kids enjoying delicious  looking pastry and sipping hot chocolate. Definitely worth stoping in if you are in the area!"}
{"text":"We had a lovely lunch here on vacation. The food was simple, but had interesting flavors."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try out Larry's and finally got there yesterday at 5:15. With smiles we entered only to find out they close at 5:00 on Sundays. No big deal we could come back another time, but apparently it was a big deal for the staff. We walked in because the door was open, no sign was showing closed and there was at least three tables still eating. We wait at the door with smiles, excited and the staff (3 behind the bar, 2 in the open kitchen) don't look at us. Finally the 3 behind the bar look at us and talk to each other and one walks over, no smile. We are told they are closed. Ok, no big deal. But they were so unpleasant, especially compared to the old business that was in the same location before them. Like we did something so wrong to walk in, then to cap off the experience when we asked what are the daily hours, since we thought it was open later he said, \"We close early on Sunday because we deserve time off too\" Wow! Don't like your hours don't take it out on us. This is the same arrogant attitude from their other property Lawrence. No need to go back. (The team at Lawrence Boucherie are very nice)"}
{"text":"I stopped in for breakfast on my last day in Montreal, and I definitely left on a high note. It's a cozy, bright and lovely space in the morning. I went simple and just had a coffee, egg and toast, and it's true what they say - simple is best when done so well. Service was great, too. I could've stayed much longer and will be sure to stop by Larry's in the evening to check out their dinner menu."}
{"text":"Delicious! The best soup and cornbread I have ever had. Bustling, charming, crowded place with helpful staff."}
{"text":"I came here with my boyfriend on a Tuesday night and I was surprised how packed it was.  This place was happening! It's a cute restaurant! Luckily we managed to get a table despite the fact that we did not make any reservations.

The waitress recommended three-four plates each to share. It was too much! Three to four plates for the both of us would have been perfect. I started with an orange wine and then tried a red. The wines were good. The wine by the glass menu was on a chalkboard and it was hard to read from where we were sitting.   

We started with the new garlic and ricotta plate. Its basically a garlic bulb baked in the oven and you remove the cloves and spread it on sliced bread with ricotta. It was ok. I've never had this before and it was not really my thing. It is definitely not as good as garlic bread.  We also shared the lonzo which was my favorite dish. Its sliced bread with a thick layer of prosciutto on top. We had the tuna ceviche and the fish tartare (salmon and bass). The ceviche plate was bigger than I expected. There was a few peices on top of each other and the pieces were pretty thick. I preferred the fish tartare but that being said I've had better salmon tartare elsewhere. The pork chop came next at the same time as the fried potatoes. We were pretty full at this point. The chop was big, fatty and juicy. The potatoes were disappointing. Some of them were a bit burnt. :(

This wine bar was good but it did not live up to my expectations. I will probably not come back. If you want to check this place out I recommend to come with not more than a handful of friends or just bring a date, have a glass of wine or two and share a couple of plates."}
{"text":"Amazing dinner at Larry's and we're glad our friend recommended us to Larry's!

The service was friendly and the food are amazing! All dishes are sharing plates, which means you get to taste more amazing dishes. :)

We ordered:

King mushroom - so buttery and delicious. The thick cut of king mushroom is the perfect bite!

Asparagus - cooked perfectly crispy and well seasoned.

Artichoke - delicious, and tangy with some delicious sesame seeds and spice!

Rare beef with chimichurri sauce - succulent tender beef strips dressed in a delicious chimichurri sauce!

Fried potatoes - crispy on the outside and super fluffy on the inside!

This place is a must try!"}
{"text":"Great cosy tapas place with delicious savours in every tapas. A bit pricey but overall I would recommend this place to anyone. Try the eggplants with goat cheese or the rubarb and beets salade"}
{"text":"Très bonne alternative à Lawrence si vous avez oublié de réserver. Le petit frère Larry propose des plats plus petits, moins chers et tout aussi bons. Du coup entrée, plat et dessert: choux fleurs brûlés parfaitement assaisonnés, morcilla/uf mollet et pois chiches parsemé de câpres et de persil, gâteau de mousse au chocolat façon forêt noire québécoise. Le bonheur."}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place!! 
Thank you for making my stay in Montreal so enjoyable. 
The food is fresh and delicious. The drinks were flowing. The service impeccable! Come to NYC!!! Thank you!"}
{"text":"I met a friend for an early midweekbusiness breakfast. The place is small but it was not too crowded, I guess during weekends its hard to find a room here and it might be too load. For us, today, it was perfect.
Not a big selection (see my photo), but they do make their own english muffins and the scrabeled eggs (with chives) were delicious."}
{"text":"What is the ideal neighbourhood restaurant? Well... one imagines a small cozy place where you feel equally as comfortable just grabbing a drink and a snack or a full meal. A place that caters to all hours... not just a breakfast place or a dinner place. You want it to be accessible to everyone - somewhere you could see parents bring their kids on the weekend just as much as the young profession couple. And the food needs to great of course. Do such places exist? Well.... Mile End might have a good one based on my visits to Larrys.

Located in the old Cafe Sardine space on Fairmount, just east of the Main, Larrys is the little brother of the wonderful Lawrence restaurant just next door. I suppose you could call it a coffee shop by day and a wine bar by night but that strikes me somewhat as reductive and not truly indicative of what Larry's offers. Larrys offers food options for breakfast, lunch and dinner from 8am to 1pm every day as well as a great selection of beer, cocktails and wine. The space is small but very warm and welcoming. I love the use of the accent wall in the back and the huge shelving unit behind the bar. Definitely has the feel of place you could stay in all day.
 
On our first visit, we went early so we went for the breakfast options. My girlfriend went with a combination of the breakfast muffin with a plate of smoked salmon. The breakfast muffin was a combination of apple, nuts, cinnamon, oatmeal and flour. A very hardy and satisfying muffin. The smoked salmon was equally enjoyable. Much thicker than your typical smoked salmon but still with that lovely texture and taste.

I myself went with the breakfast sandwich and a side-order of bubble and squeak. I have loved it when I ate at Lawrence for brunch and it continues to be excellent. A pork sausage patty with melted cheese, a over-easy egg, lettuce and dijon mustard on a english muffin. The bite of the dijon is a nice touch to the classic egg sausage sandwich. The bubble and squeak - a mixture of mashed potatoes and cabbage that has quickly become a personal favorite of mine - was nicely cooked and provided some hearty accompaniment to the sandwich.

The second time around, we were there for more of a brunch/lunch situation so ordered outside of the breakfast options. Hence, I ordered a corpse reviver - gin, lillet, amara, lemon and absinthe. It may have been 11 am at the time of order but no judging okay? Great balance and flavour - nice way to start the meal.

We still ordered the breakfast sandwich of course.... and it was still delicious. We also went with a plate of rillettes. Their butcher shop down the street has had great rillettes for years now so this was going to be a hit for sure. Great flavour and texture. Some people may find them too fatty but not me. Always excellent.

We then shared a trio of \"lunch\" dishes. First, roasted carrots with honey and muhamarah. The carrots were roasted perfectly and I loved the combination of the honey with the spicy but slightly sweet muhamarah. The fried potatoes were nicely golden and crispy. A touch of garlic and parsley came through and then you add a creamy mayo for dipping. An excellent side dish. The final dish was bulgur and pickled eggplant - a solid dish but probably the one that we enjoyed the least. Came across a little too vinegary from the pickled eggplant.

I love everything about Larrys. It helps that I love everything else that the group behind Lawrence does but still... there is something so wonderful about a place that can cater at all hours with a cuisine that is high quality and yet feels very homey and comfortable. If I lived in Mile End, I would definitely see Larrys as my neighbourhood hangout - the place to go for a drink, or a quick bit, or simply to get some work or enjoy a conversation with friends. Larrys nails the neighbourhood restaurant template perfectly.

{"text":"The place is pretty packed and small as it is popular as a brunch place. The food was amazing! Beef Tartare actually tasted like a korean beef tartare which is pretty good. I got a fairly normal brunch menu from there, but will definitely go back for lunch/dinner. I am glad with their size of portions - small plates:)"}
{"text":"I love Larry's- great ambience, excellent and well-prepared dishes, everything is shareable, sweet and knowledgeable staff, excellent wine selection, and also open very early to super late. Dine alone or on a date!"}
{"text":"The good: Big fan of Lawrence here. I'm happy to see that they managed to make a decent cup of coffee! The interior is very cool with comfortable bar chairs (which is rare)

The bad: The food is tasty but it's way overpriced! $10 for a tiny bowl of spaghetti or $9 for two cabbage rolls!! I'm sure the meat is organic etc but I have to order at least 4 courses to be full. 

I'll be back for coffee, not for food. I'd go to Le Petite Maison (or Lawrence!) or any other place in Mile-End for a brunch/lunch while filling my stomach and not emptying my pocket."}
{"text":"As a fan of Lawrence I'll be honest and say I wasn't smitten.
The space, despite previously boasting massive renovations from the now defunct Sardine, kinda just looks the same to me despite some small fix-ups.

We visited Larry's later in evening, planning to capitalize on the much-needed \"snack bar\" newly off the main; we ordered the lentils, the anchois and roots, the terrine and the pastrami. As other reviewers have commented it's rather pricey; this can be attributed to that you need to order a minimum of two plates to be drinking. This, however, didn't bother me too much- I think I was more fiercely at odds with the selection of \"snack bar\" food. After a couple of drinks I don't particularly fancy the carefully constructed Larry fare- I'd be much more inclined to head to a deli or a dive for a sandwich and fries. But that's just me.

Honestly, I'd suggest just visiting Lawrence during the day. The food is comparable if not sometimes almost identical but larger portions."}
