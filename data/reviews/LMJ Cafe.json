{"text":"Fries with no season and Chicken with no season No offense if I wanted white people food I woulda went somewhere else vary unhappy I hate the fact that different people cook different there"}
{"text":"The food here is great!!!!  I am hooked on their trio spaghetti which comes with Italian sausage, ground beef and hot links.  Delicious.. Oh and if you tell them you want it loaded then you get the bell peppers and onions in the sauce.  I am so hooked on this dish I never order anything else.   My son enjoys the cheeseburger on Texas toast and I have had their breakfast too.  Homemade sausage patty.   Oh and I've also had the fresh fried chicken.  Good place.  Think I will go this morning for fish and grits."}
{"text":"I'm on a TDY and this place is really close to base. I love their deserts and potato salad . Their sweet potato pie and fried chicken was my first meal there. I wish the place was open more but I think because of the holidays they were low manned."}
{"text":"Ok so it's been a little minute since I've ate here due to them going through some sort of transition. But, I think they back and the catfish and fries were still delicious. Miss Denise had a very friendly presence and I enjoyed my visit and the food."}
{"text":"Food was great and worth the wait to get it, cat fish and BBQ are always a big hit.  No restrooms available to customers and charging $1.50 for a cup of water is ridiculous, the staff is pleasant though but does look at you weird when you ask them to repeat the price of a water just to make sure you heard it right.  A good \"one time\" experience as long as you don't have to use the facilities or paying full price for water."}
{"text":"Tried this place out for the first time. A little off the beaten path in N.LV, but if you're in the area, very worth the stop. 

The Customer service is absolutely point on. From the moment you walk in you are greeted by a friendly smile, warming welcome and a 'hither here' aroma of foods. 

My girlfriend and I purchased the Habanero Tips, Catfish, and side order of Mac & Cheese. 

The Habanero Tips were really yummy! The meat just came off the bone ( so you know it was cooked just right ) .. The Sauce was bomb! I would like the recipe please and thank you :) .. It was sweet with a hint of habanero kick. Finger lickin' good. 

The Catfish was another hit. If you are or aren't a fan of catfish, this place might turn you into a fan or make you a greater fan. It was cooked to perfection. Not soggy nor burnt. Like I said it was perfectly cooked. This order came with a side of fries. Which were dipped into my habanero tips BBQ sauce!  

The Mac&Cheese was good. I ate my order plus my girlfriends order! I love Mac & Cheese. It wasn't salty nor overbearing with crazy flavors. It was just the right. 

Overall this family owned restaurant is a great little spot for some good ol' soul food. 

Next on my list would be the biscuits and gravy with the fried chicken and waffle combo!"}
{"text":"First time trying \"soul\" food. Wasn't impressed. Ate  peach cobbler tasted very bland. Breaded wings wasn't nothing to brag about and naked ones didn't taste like much of anything."}
{"text":"45 minutes for a chili cheeseburger & fries take out order. Asked for American cheese but got a liquid nacho w/jalapeno flavored yellow stuff instead. Everyone waiting for food looked upset at the long wait."}
