{"text":"As good as it gets. Friendly staff, amazing food and always consistent."}
{"text":"My husband and I LOVE El Metate... we joke about putting a line item in our budget for this place we eat there so much. Their food is delicious, they are family owned and operated - always friendly.  Their hot sauce is to die for, both green and red. It's possible I like El Metate better than Amados!"}
{"text":"I had a green chili burrito that was OK. Not big on flavor. I also had the shredded beef taco which were really goood."}
{"text":"For a hole in the wall mexican joint, this place rocks. It isn't high quality food by any means, but it is damn tasty. I have been here so much that I pretty much stick between the same three orders - green chili burrito, carne asada burrito and rolled tacos. I have tried other menu items, but they all disappointed me. Starting with the carne asada burrito, their pico de gallo is great! It isn't the typical kind you would find at other like-restaurants. Theirs has a flair to it that makes the cheap carne asada taste delicious. Their green chili burrito is heaven. The burrito is more sauce than meat, which to me is perfect. Definitely messy! Top it off with their green chili salsa and you will be good to go. Rolled tacos are amazing! You can actually taste the meat compared to other places where it is mostly fried tortilla. The family is really nice and know me by now. Great place for cheap, decent food!"}
{"text":"Place doesn't honor there entrainment book coupon. Says one item free with one menu item. Gave bs that it's combos only which cost more then the amount allowed on coupon. Place also smelled like feet. Glad I left without giving my business."}
{"text":"only problem I have is going through drive-thru they screw up my order. I like to order steak and chorizo burro, but get instead a steak & egg burro."}
{"text":"I do understand other reviewers that they don't have much of a menu, I have to say that their Supreme Quesadilla is good!   I also recommend their chicken rolled tacos, they are flour, crispy and come with guacamole, for the price you pay , come on people... this is no steak house!  So on average I would say MUCH BETTER than Filiberto's across the way!."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been coming to El Metate for at least 9 years and not once have they disappointed. Anything on there menu is fresh and authentic. I love my menudo on Saturdays and Sundays.."}
{"text":"Very good authentic Mexican food.  The portions are gargantuan and the ingredients are fresh.  The prices are more than reasonable.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I went to this place this morning to get a breakfast burrito ham and egg, it had absolutely no flavor what so ever and barely any cheese had no cilantro or onion or pico!!! Definitely not a filabertos breakfast burrito.!!!!"}
{"text":"Terrible waste of time and money. 99c street tacos were the worst ive ever had. Hardly any meat and it appeared to be boiled. Family could not eat their plates. Total disappointment."}
{"text":"This is my favorite mexican place ever (even beats out my dad's taco truck). My personal favorite is a Carne Asada Burrito with a churro for dessert. But honestly everything is fanstastic! I have been coming here for my entire life and I hope to never stop!"}
{"text":"I agree with what Liz already said.  The one thing I had to mention is the green salsa it is fantastic and makes everything there taste awesome.  They should bottle it.  This is definitely a hole in the wall kinda place with very \"home cooked\" Mexican food. The restaurant is kinda shabby, but not offensive and the staff are always very friendly.  The food always comes out quick and they make it up right then."}
{"text":"My family has been going there for 10 years, recently I don't know what happened! new cooks maybe . The food quality went way down.  My son ate a steak last night, it was nothing but all fat. How could the cook serve that to customers? There was no meat to eat, just fat.  We have wasted our money and told him to not eat it. We thought to order a side of red chile for him to eat, we had to pay full price since they would not allow my son to sample one piece. He just wanted to see if he liked it and was not hot.  Well that was a total waste as well. I don't know what kind of meat was in there, but definitely not red chile meat. No taste at all. The beans, this time, was not tasty either."}
{"text":"First time here. Decided to try this place based off  of the 4 star rating from Yelp. Once my boyfriend and I walked in we were bombarded with the large amount of chairs and tables even though the place was empty and not a single person walked in while we were waiting for our food. It was 5pm and the back looked like they were about to close. We placed our order and sat down while they were making our food. What was disturbing to be me was they were questioning their food to each other. They have a window where you can see the cook make the food and I saw that they threw the fish and the rolled tacos to fry in the same deep fryer which is a major cross contaminate. After the fish was done in the fryer they threw it on the griddle and saw the cook poke the fish like she was looking for something and then smelled it like if she was trying to determine if it was bad. We still kept our minds open and gave them an opportunity to see if the food was good because most hole in the walls places have some of the best food. We came home and openes the take our boxes and was disappointed. It looked very plain and ehhh. We took a bite and sure enough it had no taste at all. I would not be coming back to this location or recommend this place. Oh and they only accept cash only. I was disappointed."}
{"text":"I don't have much to say about this place. What I do have to say is something to be concerned about. The food was really good going in. GOD F-ing awful coming out. Explosive diarrhea 4 times today and the day is only half over.  I want to blow colon in a taco shell and chuck it through the drive thru.  I'd normally post a food pic but all I want to post is a toilet pic but I won't because someone might be about to have lunch.  I can give 2 shits about ever going back to this place."}
{"text":"I like this place. I've tried the tacos, rolled tacos, and the special of \"2 mini cheese and bean burritos for 2.99\". Those burritos were pretty big  for being minis!  I love the salsas ( the green is pretty hot). I did knock off a star because I feel Mexican places should always give Chips with all of their orders. Chips here will cost you 3 plus. That's ridiculous. But food is great. However the new place behind them may give them a run for their money. Their entrees already come with chips. It's TBD...."}
{"text":"This place it the best place in East Mesa to get legitimate genuine Mexican food. Hands down best. Try the California burritos or I also like the supper fries."}
{"text":"The chorizo and eggs are amazing. Asada street tacos are priced right at $1 each, the meat is tender, and taste great. The food is also authentic."}
{"text":"Sadly, this place has lost my business. I've been coming here since 2005, we moved out of the East Valley and whenever I'm over there I stop by for lunch. Well today will be the last time I go. It has become incredibly average, prices have gone up, friendliness down, and the food was just so... okay. There are too many good Mexican food places around to waste time at okay places."}
{"text":"we had breakfast there yesterday huevos rancheros for me ham and egg burrito for the wife nothing great senior taco out rocks this place  50-1 on the breakfast front"}
{"text":"The lady working the register was rude, I asked for a sample of their menudo and she said they don't do that. I went ahead and ordered the menudo anyway as I was assured by her that it was very good. Needless to say that it was not good at all. Supposedly it's made fresh every day but I doubt it. The rest of the food doesn't look too bad, not sure if I'll be back"}
{"text":"Food was delicious until I bit into my last taquito and found a toothpick right in the center. Still attempted to eat my churro just to find a fiber placed neatly on top after unwrapping it. Quite an interesting experience after using the drive thru"}
{"text":"When I worke d in Chandler I used to eat here DAILY.....  The green sauce can't be beat, period."}
{"text":"This place is what mexican greasy pits are supposed to be - it's filiberto's-ish but a little more personal and seems almost like it's family run.   Is it shiny new and clean? No. It's cheap mexican food, with awesome flavor and lots of good greasiness. Nobody is ever in there for lunch which is kind of nice because you can see them cook your food fresh and don't have to worry about how long meat has been sitting in a tin. I always get a carne asada taco and carnitas taco which are always awesome. My only negative is once my carne asada tacos had a little too much fat and gristle on them but eh for $2 each you only expect so much."}
{"text":"Awesome experience. I met this amazing guy behind the counter named Jorge gave me exceptional service, beyond his kindness and genuine charisma he gave me amazing life advice that led me to later to go a bank of America and open an account. What a stellar guy. Great food, great service and Jorge. Never can get better then El me tate"}
{"text":"My husband would go here for lunch when they were located on Kyrene & Chandler. They relocated on Alma School & Elliot a couple years ago. He always gets the carne asada burro. It really is amazing and we both recommend it. I'm a fan of their tostadas and honestly obsessed with the salsa verde here.  We buy 1/2 and sometimes full pints of it to keep at the house. The relocation has killed their business. Nine years ago it was packed. The new location not so much. We always do take out, and it seems like they are still trying to get things up & going here. Smaller facility, and still no fountain drinks? Everything is made to order, authentic and family operated. Yes, occasionally you'll see their kids there. It's sweet and they always make me smile."}
{"text":"Really great, authentic food that doesn't hurt the wallet."}
{"text":"I am a frequent customer at this restaurant.  I actually know Carmen always nice and respectful.  Today I used a coupon from Dining Advantage buy one item get a second or up to $6 value from T-Mobile Tuesdays.  The manager who has seen me before come out and says we are not honoring that coupon do you expect me to give away food.  Very rude and confrontational(not needed) I was disappointed in his actions.  Business owners should not be willing to lose frequent customers over a coupon.  Figure something out and explain in a respectful manor.  Very disappointed in the way they do business.  I will do my best to let others know not to go there.  Bad Customer service supersedes good food."}
{"text":"I did not like this place. The menudo was very poorly made, muddy and too spicy. I also ordered the tacos de cabeza, they were GREASIER than heck, the meat was refried for some reason, and huge chunks of fat were found throughout the tacos. I couldn't even finish ONE... the tortillas were actually good, if they wouldn't have been soaked in the grease from the meat. I'm never going there again... if I need menudo (hang-over cure) I will get some Juanita's at the grocery store!  OH! and they charged my credit card twice! so now I guess I have to go back!"}
{"text":"We really like this place because there's never a wait to order, the food is freshly made and really good.  If you don't mind the wait for made-to-order, this is the place.  Prices are reasonable and you can hear the conversation if you dine in.  A local favorite.  Try it, you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Not much around this area so my options were limited.  I asked what was best and ended up with a carne asada burrito.  The tortilla was homemade and delicious as well as the salsas (although lacking much heat).  The beef was of low quality.  I think people come here for the price based on the area, prices of food, and quality.  I would come back but try a different type of burrito.  Nice people and typical hole in the wall Mexican restaurant atmosphere."}
{"text":"Very disappointing, learning Google 5 star reviews don't mean much. Same old flavor profile as everywhere else. Had to wait about 5 minutes for someone to take my order. All the tables were dirty. Not sure if the people worked there (seemed awfully comfortable) but their kids were running around in circles and fingering the salsa. Got the $10 chicken Chimichanga. It had partially melted through my Styrofoam plate. Took 3 bites and still no chicken. Finally I cut it down the middle. It was just very plain and swimming in cheese. Oh and every cut went through the foam plate. Both salsas red and green were very bad. Green was almost ok, the red inedible. Took a bite of rice and beans. Then through the whole mess in the trash. Went to Costco and hot a 1/4 pound Polish dog and coke for $1.50 way better. I came here because all the rave reviews, I don't understand them. Just imagine a Filibertos with horrible sauce and about 60% as good. Been in AZ 15 years and still can't find Mexican food like Washington state. The best I can find is On the Border, Chilis and Chipotle. Sad!"}
{"text":"Not vegetarian friendly. They will not deviate from their menu to make the simple substitutions required to make vegetarian options. They are over priced. My bf says their meat stuff is tasty. Store never looks very clean and employees don't go out of their way to be friendly or helpful."}
{"text":"Just ok.  Nothing to go out of your way for.  I had the chicken combo plate.  I was hoping to find the so called \"hole in the wall\" that is an undiscovered gem, but nothing but average."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places for authentic grub in the Mesa area. The Verde salsa here is very awesome, great choice of combos and ala carte items. The do have a drive thru window as well."}
{"text":"Not a great dine-in experience. The restaurant was clean and appeared to be fairly well maintained. However, the staff was not friendly or knowledgeable and the food was just so-so. The cheap, flimsy silverware and foam plates were a terrible combination with hot, heavy, wet food. Maybe a take-out experience would be better?  We ordered: 1) #19 chimichanga plate (large chimi - guacamole, sour cream, lettuce and pico de gallo on top - rice and beans on the side.) It comes as a beef chimi. We paid extra to make it chicken, which i found ridiculous! There were rice and beans inside the chimi as well as on the side. The beans were really good, authentic Mexican refried beans! The chicken, while tasty, was very wet (too wet) and left a puddle on the plate and provide a sloppy (instead of crisp) chimi. The rice was way too salty and lacked any real Mexican flavor.  2) Chicken burrito. This was for a picky eater so we requested chicken and cheese only. It was loaded with onions and green chilis. Needless to say, the picky eater was not a happy camper. Again, the chicken was VERY soupy/wet. The soft flour tortilla was soggy. Served with a side of lettuce and pico de gallo. Most of this order ended up in the trash. :(  3) Bacon and eggs burrito.  (The menu says these are only served in the morning, but we were told they could make them anytime.) This was 90% bacon, 10% egg with a sprinkle of cheese. Because it was mostly bacon, it was quite salty. Not very good; dry and greasy.  4) Beef burrito, enchilada style.  Again, very wet, which would have been fine if the order had been done correctly and served on a plate enchilada style. What we got was a soft burrito wrapped in paper. At one point, juice actually squirted across the table when my hubby bit into it. Funny? Yes. Something you look for in a burrito? Not so much.  5) An order of super nachos (to share).  We had high hopes for these after reading other reviews. They were maybe 2 - 3 stars (out of 5). The flavor was great! The chips were super thin (but very good) and could not hold all the stuff piled on top of them. The guacamole, beans, sour cream... all good. The meat was flavorful, but gristly and we kept having to spit little pieces out. Plan to eat with a fork if you order these. Not a good idea for sharing."}
{"text":"this little gem is way better than filbertos by far. and believe it or not the have spicy buffalo style hot wings that are the best in town."}
{"text":"Really good shrimp burritos and fish ones werent to bad either.  Fairly friendly place."}
{"text":"This is legitimate and delicious Mexican food. I've been eating here for about 15 years and it tastes just like home. The owners are very nice. I only wish there were more of these around! I've never had anything bad here and love their salsas esp. The green. Yum! This is just coming from a regular with really good taste in food."}
{"text":"Delicious food for really good price. Had two crispy bean tacos, a chicken taco, and a carne asada plate. Service was good and cashier was friendly, but cook and service was a little unorganized. I had to go up and get each item separately, rather than the meal coming out all at once. Salsa bar was okay. There was green and red hot sauce, which were not spicy. They also had spicy pickled carrots and cucumbers. These were good, but did not have a lot of flavor."}
{"text":"One of the best, if not number one fast food Mexican places in the Phoenix Market is El Metate. Enchiladas are melt in your mouth good as is the green chili. Food and Mexican drinks like horchata are authentic. Service is amazing, too."}
{"text":"Stopped by here on a whim, and kept on going back. The food tastes fresh and is put together perfectly, great pricing and real nice employees.   One of the best Mexican joints I've ate at in Maricopa County, and easily superior to Filiberto's, it isn't even close."}
{"text":"Great place for good homestyle fast food.  Pleasant and fast competent service.   Prices are great and affordable.  Loved it!"}
{"text":"This is a standard looking hole-in-the-wall Mexican food restaurant just like a gazillion others in Phx.  Unfortunately this one is pretty lame.    I got two enchiladas, one chicken and one beef.  Neither meat is anything I'd recommend or buy again.    The dark brown sauce scared me and didn't taste much better than it looked.  Some sort of beef sauce I think.  It wasn't awful but it was nothing I want again. My copilot on this adventure said her chicken tacos were not so good either, and when we got back to the office she noted that we won't be trying that place again.  The place was super quiet for a Friday at 12:30pm. Punch machines were off, a 4yr old was scootering around behind the counter, and I think there were only two people working.  I wonder if they'll be in business next week."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick lunch. Place was not busy at 11:30. People working behind the counter but no communication or even ...hey will be with you in a moment. Finally someone asked for our order. I had the carne asada burro. Tortilla was fresh, burro was good.  Adequate spice, beef and guacomole. No complaints about the food quality at all...it was authentic. Better than fast food options in the area."}
{"text":"Great bang for your buck and a nice spot to eat authentic Mexican food.  I suggest any type of burrito including the breakfast burrito"}
