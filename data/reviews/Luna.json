{"text":"Cafe Luna in theory has much going for it - trendy interior, good location in campustown, free parking, and an excellent wine list. That said, it seems that their tapas style menu is still needs a lot of work for the prices they are asking. I've been twice - each time fried foods have been either undercooked or soggy, cold dishes served at room temperature, the cds being played skipped. All of that said, the staff seemed distracted - which I could forgive if there were more than five people in the restaurant. I am giving it three stars as the menu is at least interesting and the selection of wine and spirits excellent. Otherwise, it would be a two star selection."}
{"text":"I'm one of the few reviewers here who prefer the new downtown location to the campus. The room is larger ( I was always being shoe-horned into a seat in the campus location, getting hit by everyone else trying to move anywhere), the decor more stylish, the whole \"feel\" more intimate. 

The food remains the same: tapas and entrees, almost always good, but not consistently so.  I've been here quite often; still, I must confess that I have never had an entree at Luna, on campus or downtown. I always get the tapas. I've found my favorites - the goat cheese balls, the pesto burgers, the tuna tartare - and those come out reliably delicious. They are also the proper serving size. Far too many tapas restaurants call regular portions \"tapas\" (Radio Maria is real committer of this sin), which spoils the point of \"little bites.\"  Spouse gets the parmesan fries and artichoke. 

Luna's tapas is clean-tasting and fresh, not over greasy. They are also  creative. Partly because of that, I do wish that the tapas menu changed more frequently or that specials were more extensive. 

Like other reviewers, I've had trouble with service. It's been hit and miss. Getting bread to the table and refilling the water pitcher seems to consistently flummox the wait staff, but like the little girl with the curl, when the service is good, it's great."}
{"text":"The Champaign dining scene is, well, not that good, so this is a 3 relative to the local competition. Locally sourced, seasonal menu. Excellent frites, good meats.  The problems come with the service. The bar staff are nice, but not necessarily particularly accomplished, so it's wise to avoid cocktails. In a basically empty restaurant, it took us 45 minutes after ordering to get our steaks, and they screwed up one of the orders. It then took another 45 minutes to get the correct order. There's no reason that getting food should take this long. On the other hand, once you get the food, it is pretty good. And, the servers are very nice about how slow and wrong things are."}
{"text":"This is the old standby for romantic dinners with my husband.  It's a wonderful experience going there and it won't totally bankrupt you.  Their wines are always amazing.  I'm one of these wine snobs who is also totally ignorant about wine.  I know a good one when I taste it, but can never seem to remember the names and years.  Anyway, the waiters here always hook me up and it's very romantic and lovely.  I haven't been since they moved to downtown CHampaign, are they a tapas place now????"}
{"text":"With one visit, Luna has become one of my favorite restaurants in CU.

The ambiance of the restaurant is exactly like something you would find in a Chicago area place.  The atmosphere is very relaxing and the decor is modern and classy without being pretentious. 

The service there was extremely friendly and attentive.  Both Jay and Gabe offered thoughtful and quality recommendations and did a great job taking care of my boyfriend and myself all night.

The food was truly outstanding.  Everything we ordered was absolutely delicious.  For a tapas style restaurant, the small plates are all generous portions with reasonable prices.  

Simply put, Luna is a great place to enjoy a city like dining experience in a college town."}
{"text":"Luna used to be my favorite restaurant when it was on campus. It has changed. I don't know the reason, but it is just not the same restaurant.

The last two times in a row that I went there, someone I was with ordered poultry and received it uncooked. I mean purple and bloody, too, not just slightly pink. I swear to god it could have clucked, Each time, a waitress unapologetically whisked the dish away to be cooked further only to bring it back still bloody. I have never seen poultry THAT undercooked in a restaurant before. Ever. And the cooks couldn't even cook it through the second time? The person who ordered it touched the meat and said it was quite cool. For crissake I know the recession is bad, but can they really not splurge for a frickin meat thermometer?

Meat like that should never be served, but the fact that both times it was sent out AGAIN with cold, purple blood-pools inside was just sick. On top of that, the food isn't as good anymore, they took 20 minutes to seat us even though we had a reservation, and they refused to give us any kind of discount even though the meat was not edible! They didn't apologize or act like they cared at all. 

It kills me to write this, but Luna as C-U knew it is gone."}
{"text":"I haven't been here in several months, but I used to dine here regularly when I lived in C-U. 

I never had any major complaints-- I had several GREAT meals here (brunch & dinners, including one dinner with great live music). If I could find anything wrong with Luna it is, as others mentioned, the service. The waitresses are hit or miss--sometimes excellent and sometimes moody/incompetent."}
{"text":"Okay here's the deal, I personally think the food is GREAT! However, the service is so-so.

One time a friend and I showed up around 7 to eat and stood in the doorway for nearly 10 minutes before we decided to leave. Way too expensive for crap like that."}
{"text":"I first went to Cafe Luna when it was located off of Green St. on campus. I initially had a good experience, my boyfriend and I enjoyed the food, and the service was excellent.

However, their new location isn't as great as the old one. We felt our food was overpriced, and the service was not great at all. We were placed in a corner that was surrounded by the hustle and bustle of busboys clearing off tables, and people entering and leaving the kitchen. 

The best thing about eating at the new place was the bread and roasted garlic. That was it!! We ordered some coconut shrimp, and some ravioli with goat cheese and asparagus. The coconut shrimp was really overpriced; I think it was almost 8 or 9 dollars for 4 measly shrimp. The ravioli did not have a good flavor, and again, we were served 4 ravioli squares that cost about 17 bucks! 

When the waitress asked if we wanted dessert, my boyfriend explained to her that his experience at the new place wasn't as good as the last location. He explained the pricing, the taste, and the overall service. 

The waitress totally made excuses and blamed \"floods\" for higher vegetable prices and that going out to eat was a luxury.

The rudeness of our waitress plus the overpriced food makes it an experience we won't be recreating."}
{"text":"Enjoy the ambiance of Luna and there is solid food for the price. A bit skimpy on the vegetarian/vegan options, however I've seen a few more added in the past few years."}
{"text":"I remember when I first visited Luna when it was on Green street - lots of interesting items on the menu and all I tried made me want to come back to try more - always a great sign. At that location parking was a pain, so when they moved I was excited. Like several other reviews here have said, they are just not the same. I didn't find the menu selections that exciting, what I have tried over a couple visits were poorly executed."}
{"text":"This is the best restaurant in C-U.  We ordered the Parmesan fries, mushroom/gruyere crostinis, potato gnocchi and crab/lobster crab cake tapas to share.  Everything was spot on delicious!  To drink we had a dirty martini (best I've ever had) and the French Horn.  The French Horn was good but a little sour for my tastes.  The atmosphere is very quaint.  I am very excited to try their brunch menu sometime.  I thought it was very reasonably priced for everything we had.  I'd highly recommend Cafe Luna to anybody!"}
{"text":"At the old location, this was my favorite restaurant in town. Great staff, great food, and a cozy location.

Now, at the new larger place, they seem a bit stretched. When its good, its as good as it was before, but all too often they make mistakes. The waiters deliver to the wrong table, the kitchen can't get out all the dishes to a table at the same time, and if you try to talk to the manager, he mumbles feebly at you."}
{"text":"Uggggg....

OK, so I used to love Luna when it was on campus.  LOVE. IT.  Which I guess is why I have repeatedly attempted to continue my love affair at the new location.  

First and second, I went with a group for brunch.  The place was nearly empty the first time, but we waited forever for the food.  My second trip, our group had reservations and we still waited 45 minutes! I enjoyed my breakfasts (poached egg  with lox) but the service was suck.

Third (and I'm afraid final) visit was a disaster.  This was another large-ish group (about 12) with reservations.  Drink orders were taken but never filled.  Our food orders were not taken at the same time; not even close.  I was the last person to order food (by about 20 minutes) but the first person to receive my meal.  On the other hand, my husband didn't receive his dinner until after the rest of us had eaten!  All of this happened while thirsty patrons are still waiting for their first drinks.

I ordered risotto that night.  Mistake.  It was like a sticky sort-of rice pudding that was cold and just all wrong.  The very delicious-looking fries were sort of like my risotto, cold and wrong.  The steaks that my friends ordered looked great, but some were not cooked to order.

I think the most annoying part of the night was that the restaurant will not accept more than two credit cards from a party.  They will split up the check, but they will only allow two parties to use plastic.  In this day and age, I don't know how this kind of policy could even be imagined, but we asked the waitress to combine some checks so that we could accommodate.  Of course that was all wrong and took another half hour.

I also wish they wouldn't cram their tables they way they do, especially next to the door.  It's so cold, loud and crowded.  And by the way, on our way out the back to parking lot, I could hear all of the employees in the kitchen yelling about how they couldn't wait to get out of there and that they hated being there...my sentiments exactly."}
{"text":"They took down my review twice..... It was not offensive at all except stating the facts. Yelp should stop letting the owners easily taking off the reviews......"}
{"text":"a recent weekend dinner found the place almost empty at 7pm - maybe 4 tables. we were seated promptly. nice, high ceilinged room.  after we had perused the menu for awhile  & made our choices, our waitress THEN proceeded to tell us what the kitchen was out of  (?) and what the specials were.  we ordered wine, which upon tasting, was so full of sediment it was undrinkable. while she looked on blankly, we suggested a decanter. she brought one back and whisked away the first glass. the wine, once the sediment was gone was good.

there were bread plates on the table but we had to ask for bread.

the food was different and tasty. while my tofu could have had more flavor, the dish accompaniments made up for it."}
{"text":"I hate to say it, but Luna is pretty overrated. After reading a ton of great reviews, I came here with very high expectations and the knowledge that I would have to spend some serious cash. I was OK with that since splurging on a great meal is one of those things that you just have to do sometimes. Luna is certainly good, but nowhere near great and I don't feel like the price tags are quite justified by the food they are turning out. I found the food to be very hit or miss and the service to be friendly but extremely inattentive. 

The roasted garlic served with the bread is a delightful touch, although we did not get very much bread and therefore weren't able to finish off the yummy garlic. We started out with salads that were a bit pricey but absolutely delicious. As others have noted, the goat cheese balls are fantastic. However, I was easily able to replicate them at home, so I don't know that they alone could get me to come back. 

We were here during the late summer and so they were offering an asparagus dish that was also wonderful. The asparagus was flavorful, tender and perfectly cooked. We were less than impressed with the coconut shrimp which seemed to be pretty basic and no different from what you would get anywhere else. It was also only two rather small shrimp, which I know is how it is with tapas, but it seemed pretty expensive for what was the equivalent in quality as an appetizer at TGI Friday's. 

My husband described the strawberry rhubarb ribs as \"weird but ok.\" The low point of the evening was the cold artichoke. It seemed to have been overcooked, as it was dried out, leathery, and sorely lacking much of an edible portion. It had then been soaked in a very bland brine and was extremely waterlogged. So it was bizarrely dry and soggy a the same time. What little of it could be eaten was pretty horrible. The sauce that come with it, however, was really good. The focus here really does seem to be the sauces as the one that came with the boring shrimp was excellent as well. We ordered one or two other dishes as well, but they were so unremarkable that I don't even remember what they were. 

I don't know that I would go back for dinner, but maybe for a lunch of salad and goat cheese balls. There are a lot of good concepts on the menu, but the quality of ingredients and execution leaves quite a bit to be desired. I'm curious to try their brunch but there was enough wrong with the dinner that I'm somewhat hesitant."}
{"text":"I have had good experiences at Luna, but today was just ok.  Four of us went for brunch and even though we had a reservation, it took a while to get seated. The service was a bit slow, but it was pretty busy.

The pear beignets were yummy and the coffee was good. The entrees were a little disappointing especially since I've had a good brunch here before. We ordered the croque monsieur and swiss roesti.  Both come with a fried egg on top, but the egg yolks were hard and not runny at all - maybe because our food sat under the heat lamp or broiler for too long. 

I will go back because I want to give Luna another change to make my brunchy dreams come true."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I have been trying to go to Luna's for awhile now, but they always seem to be closed.  We saw them open this morning and jumped in for brunch.  Even though there was only one other table there, it still took several minutes for the waitress to notice us.  After taking our drink order, it took her another 7-8 minutes to come back for the meal order since she had to flirt with the guy at the bar.

The food was ok, a bit overpriced but not awful.  It was a little salty, and I hate hamburgers that are so wet (not the burger itself, but the toppings) that the bun gets soggy.  The fries were really good, and the waitress was friendly, so it wasn't the worst brunch I have ever had.

I may go back in the future, but I doubt it, just to slow, salty and pricey."}
{"text":"Read some of these reviews and it seems people really have it out for this place. I experienced an incredible dinner with engaging and knowledgeable staff at a great price and even had some great jazz playing while we ate. Talked to the table next to us who were experiencing the same thing who then recommended brunch-can't wait to try it later today."}
{"text":"This should be a great restaurant.  It's in a great location, the menu is interesting, and they have a good wine selection.  But this is not a great restaurant; it's a lazy restaurant.  It's a restaurant that is confident that there aren't other good restaurants in town, and that they can coast a little bit because we have no real choice when we want good food.  

Alas for you Luna, you are deceived because  this is not true anymore. There are a lot of good places to eat now.  And in those places, the tables aren't jammed together so closely that you can hear the most intimate details of strangers' conversations (spoiler alert: the conversations are about whether other people can hear the conversation). And in those other places, the portions are not tiny, like sad little retro homages to late 80s nouvelle cuisine. And in those other places, the food arrives at your table in under 40 minutes. 

I really used to like how haphazard Luna was when it was on campus. There was a sort of charm in not really knowing if you would get the food you ordered. But this charm has worn thin, and the last time I ate at Luna (last week), the disjunction between the price and the quality of the food was too great.  No way."}
{"text":"I'm back!  Long hiatus over, back to yelping.

Okay, so Luna is quite different from your typical rowdy, downtown Champaign restaurant.  It's a quaint tapas place with outdoor seating reminiscent of a bistro in London or Paris (complete with those cute little outdoor lamp posts too!).

Depending on whether you go for the entree or just stick with a few tapas selections to share, you're looking at a bill around $20-ish/person (that's including alcohol, mind you).

Their tapas plates are between $5-$7 (round abouts), and they have quite a varied selection.  I've been here a couple times, and both times the wait staff has been quite good (though nothing extraordinary).

As far as tapas go, I can't think of another place around Champaign with ingredients quite as fresh, or a menu quite as unique.  If nothing else, try their goat-cheese balls.  Suuuper rich, but suuuuper yummy.  Their duck tapas was really tasty too.

Of the two times I went, I pretty much wore shorts and a t-shirt.  Sure, there were patrons all decked out for a fancy night out with their honey, but whatever.... I cheapened the set, haha.

Despite the cozy ambiance of their outdoor dining, Luna sits riiight next to the amtrak station, meaning trains roaring past several times a meal.  It's not overly distracting for me, as I worked for a railroad company for a couple summers, but I can see how it would bother others.

Long story short, a nice place to go on a date, good food, maybe a bit on the pricey side, big alcohol selection."}
{"text":"Luna has excellent food. I've always had a good time every time I've been. Dinner is tapas and various entree's - it changes regularly.

I've only gone when I expect to spend a good deal of money, but I've always found it delicious. I prefer to go for the chef's choice special when I can. Less decisions for me and a wide variety of good tapas.

I've also been for lunch - its less pricy but still delicious. I didn't expect to be wowed, but I would say their lunch hamburger is the best in town."}
{"text":"Stopped into Luna on a Saturday evening at around 6pm after a Badgers @ Illinois game (sadly the Badgers lost). 

Decor was smartly done with deep purple wooden walls and a muted/ metallic teal floral fabric panels. Hanging lights from ikea over the tables leaving the room at a romantically lit level. I thought the setting pleasant. 

Ending up ordering 5 tapas, 4 adult beverages, 2 coffees, and a desert and the total with tax and tip was $90. 

Had the scallops (2) over seczuan beans and thought they were cooked well and were great (Brianna L thought they were undercooked, but I disagreed, maybe hers was, who knows). Also had the duck con-fit ravioli and really liked the sauces provided. The beef tenderloin kabob we both thought the beef was pretty fatty for tenderloin and tough to chew. The Parmesan fries in truffle oil were just regular overcooked fries with very little shredded cheese over them (not overly bad, just I wouldn't get these again here). Finally, had the prosciutto and manchego crostini, decent, but they provide you with their own bread and warmed, tasty garlic. 

I had their Manhattan specialty drink and it was made very well I thought. B-dubb and a sparkling wine and another South African wine that she both liked. 

Service I found to be excellent. Prompt and timely arrival of tapas and drinks. They were very friendly."}
{"text":"It's nice to know that you can find fine dining in Champaign. I went to dinner at Luna  by myself after the place was recommended to me by a friend. It was a Monday night and the place was completely empty but for two other customers. A little surprising considering how great I thought the food was.

The waitress who helped me was very friendly, and we chatted a little bit. Funny how she said she was sorry after I told her I was visiting from NYC... sure, the dining scene and the nightlife in Champaign aren't exactly the most vibrant, but this place demonstrates that there are a few nice places to go to after all.

The food is mainly tapas (for dinner at least... I think the menu is different for lunch), though not typical Spanish tapas. A lot of dishes sounded very interesting, and I ended up trying two of them. I ordered the seared tuna with red pepper marmalade, gingered sushi rice and green tea broth: it was very good though I think it could have been even better. I also don't think the rice was actual sushi rice, but that's a detail. I then had the apple braised pork shoulder with celery roots: this was absolutely delicious. The pork was extremely tender and tasty, and I also really enjoyed the celery roots, which were crunchy and flavorful. Great dish, I would definitely have it again!

For dessert, I tried the strawberry Napoleon: layer cake of filo dough, cream and fresh strawberries. You can't really go wrong and indeed it was delicious. 

They also have a fairly extensive wine and cocktail list: I had a glass of Australian wine (a blend if I remember well), which was fine but not great. However, with dessert I ordered their cheapest port and it turned out great, not too mention that the waitress probably had never poured port before (or really really liked me!) and brought me the most gigantic glass of port I'd ever seen. I thanked by giving her the most gigantic tip she's probably ever seen as well, so I guess we're even.

$50 later, I left the place full and satisfied, and more than slightly inebriated. 4-1/2 stars."}
{"text":"This review and rating is based upon my single visit to Cafe Luna around lunch time on a Saturday, when only the brunch menu was being served.

Cafe Luna is outstanding in several areas. The food preparation is perfect. Dishes are high class. The ambiance and decor are luxurious, but prices are quite reasonable. Service is competent, but not exceptional.

Food:
It is rare for a kitchen to get all of the little things right. For example, many restaurants might produce an egg dish with the eggs overcooked, their bread may be inferior quality or stale, or the vegetable preparation might obviously be given no attention. Cafe Luna's kitchen gets every little detail right.

My omelet came to me with the eggs slightly loose: perfect. The filling was sautéed mushrooms and a couple of cheeses. The cheeses were high quality and the mushrooms were freshly sautéed. The potatoes were just right, with seasoning and onions combining to make an impressive side dish. 

My companion ordered a quiche, which she enjoyed and which I sampled. Quiche is not my favorite dish, but I did note that high quality gruyere and smoked ham (or bacon?) were used, and that the custard was mostly cream. 

See the restaurant web site for the full menus for each meal time.


Decor and Ambiance:
Cafe Luna occupies a restored space in an old brick building that might have been associated with the railroad at one time. In any case, ceilings are high, as are the windows. Tables and chairs are very comfortable, the latter being upholstered. The Cafe Luna web site contains a shot that depicts the look and feel of the dining space pretty well.

The dining space feels large, although, in fact, the tables are too densely distributed to make for a truly luxury class experience. Service is ok, but not exceptional. I would guess that service degrades considerably during busy periods. For both of these reasons, Luna is best enjoyed at a time when business is slow. Service can keep up, and you can enjoy the space fully, without its being crowded. The horseshoe bar anchors one side of the dining room.

There appears to be a nice outdoor seating area. We weren't able to tell for certain, and the weather was not right for eating outdoors when we were there. On weekends, this area of town would be relatively quiet. Since the view from the two patios of Cafe Luna is pleasant, eating outdoors would probably be a nice experience.

Service:
Service is competent but not exceptional.

Price:
Price for value received is outstanding. Even in absolute terms, the prices are on the low side.

Other:
There are large public parking lots a block or two away from the restaurant. 

Summary:
In my one visit to Cafe Luna, the restaurant was truly outstanding. I, myself, can't give it five stars based on a single visit, but after a few more visits I may update the rating in this review.

I highly recommend Cafe Luna."}
{"text":"The food at Luna is quite good and they have a nice bar. I feel that the food is a bid overpriced for what you get though.The seating in the restaurant is also pretty uncomfortable even though the atmosphere is very nice. So far I have had good service at this restaurant and I do enjoy their tapas. Sometimes it is difficult to find close by parking since it is on the street and metered until 9 PM during the week."}
{"text":"Well... Luna still falls seriously short for me. The interior is amazingly decorated, they really have done a beautiful job of that, but all the details are still very sloppy. For example, the rose on our table was dead, with no water... ? How do you not notice that? The food this time also fell short... 
We ordered the Shrimp Special, which was grilled and came with coconut risotto. The Shrimp was disgustingly over-salted, and the risotto was a pilaf. How do you screw up your SPECIAL? People?
The Duck Confit ravioli was a good concept with an excellent jus, but there was so little confit in the pasta, that I wouldn't have known what was in it unless I had seen it written down. The Flank Steak Crostini was the highlight, but was too big to eat as a crostini...either spread out the topping over more bread, or call it something else... crostini is supposed to be finger food! The final disaster was the fried gnocchi. I am a big gnocchi snob, and these were so gross. I hated it. Bad concept, it kind of sticks to the top of your mouth, in a bad way and it REALLY needs to be served with sauce.
Sorry Luna,after two attempts now, I'm not coming back."}
{"text":"Cafe Luna would totally pass muster back home in California.  It is a classy, delicious, fine-dining tapas establishment.  Unlike some tapas places back home, CL gets it right--balancing taste, flavor, and high quality ingredients that create a delicious and accessible series of wonderful small plates delivered to your table.

The ambiance is fantastic, the wait staff incredibly friendly, and the wine list quite good.  It was the best meal of my recruitment trip to UIUC, and the arguments to choose the school for my PhD were incredibly effective--and it wasn't just because of the exquisite fried goat cheese balls, duck confit ravioli with teriyaki, sashimi tuna cubes, mushroom ragout, and bananas flambe.

Or was it? :)"}
{"text":"We got the lamb and chicken entrees and they were both perfectly cooked. We haven't found another place in Champaign that has managed cook our food as well. The atmosphere is pretty cool as well. I don't think this restaurant receives the credit it deserves."}
{"text":"First off, I was incredibly surprised to find so many offerings for tapas restaurants in little Champaign. Feeling a bit French, I took my mom and sister out for Sunday brunch. I always dissect the menu beforehand, so I was drooling by the time we pulled up in front of Luna. (Of course, I thought the restaurant was on Chester, not Chestnut, so this allowed for a lot of mindless driving and walking before we realized that Luna was adjacent of the train station. Had not expected it to be so close to it.

Anyway. On to the review. The place was very nice. My mom commented how much she liked the calm, dimly-lit room, and I agree. Tall ceilings, large windows, and a sidedoor leading out to the outdoor eating area made the restaurant seem bigger than it really was. The tables are arranged very close to each other, but I wasn't able to hear my neighbors' conversations, and I'm pretty sure they didn't hear mine. The bathrooms are awesome. Gray and sleek with lots of mirrors. One thing: why are the toilets set so close to the ground?

Now to the food! (And our server.) Wow, first meetings are deceiving. I thought our server (a woman, I forget her name) was a complete bitch because when I asked if the offered brunch items were entree-big, she speared me with a raised eyebrow and said \"This is brunch, dear. We don't offer entrees until dinner time.\" Whoa. My bad on messing up foodie-language. Excuse me. But anyway, I guess because she realized I was a harmless, albeit bumbling, Korean girl with aspirations of high-cuisine, or whatever, she became very nice very quickly. When I asked about what juices she recommended, she said the restaurant was all out, but then brought back three complementary pineapple-mint juices (RESUULLT! oh man, these are to DIE for. Frothy and refreshing, with chunks of pineapple and a hefty dose of mint. MMMMM! I wholeheartedly recommend).

We ordered beignets with chocolate and raspberry dipping sauces, the asparagus roesti, Grand Marnier french toast, and Gravad Lox eggs Benedict. SO GOOD. 

The roesti was basically a skillet of hash, black olives, cherry tomatoes, artichokes, goat cheese, and pesto. OH MAN! I mean, yes, salty because of the olives and cheese, but so good. Piping hot, so that the cheese and pesto just melted atop all the veggies. And the artichokes were cooked wonderfully. I justpoked it with my fork and it fell apart. Mmmm. The french toast - wow. My mom and I had been on a quest to find good french toast (ick, Walker Bros, ick) and we've found it. Thick pieces (so many pieces! Six at the least!) perfectly browned, and then sprinkled with cinnamon and juicy slices of strawberry, and topped with this whipped topping that had apparently been toasted a la creme brulee or something, cuz it had this wonderful browned, burnt topping. My sister's lox benedict: thumbs up. I am not a fan of poached egg, but Luna did it right. The English muffin, I think, was made on the premises, because I've never tasted anything like it. (Again, not a fan of English muffins, but if Luna offered me a lifetime supply, I would take it up in a moment!) She had a side of fresh greens with a zippy sauce that was yum.

Oh! And around 1:30 PM, two women sat down in the middle of the restaurant with an accordian and violin, and started playing French music. I loved this. Really did.

What gives Luna the four stars? The wait time. Granted, it's Sunday brunch, but I felt the times inbetween the juices and beignets, and the rest of the meal was just way too long. But I will be back to sample the dinnertime tapas! (And expect a review after then too.)"}
{"text":"Walking into Cafe Luna, it's difficult to imagine you are still in a little brick building in Campus Town. Chinese Lanterns and teal lights softly  highlighting mahogancy indicate this is not typical campustown fare. 

This is the only place on campus to get tapas, flavorful Spanish style small plates, but they also have a good selection of entrees. The tapas are what I'd go to Cafe Luna for and if you order a couple they make up a full meal. The selection varies, but most include some delicious local ingredients, including local greens from Blue Moon farm's and chevre produced by the state's only artisan cheese maker. 

The best things I've had here include a perfectly succulent pork shank and the flourless chocolate cake with berries. I have been impressed with nearly everything here, except for the soggy truggle fries. 

Many people love brunch here, but I found it only OK. The selection is smaller and the best thing is the donuts with creme fraiche. One time when my friend had her birthday here they gave our table three plates of them on the house. Mmmm. 

Prices are on the high end, but it is a wonderful place for a formal date or to convince guests that campustown really is a nice place."}
{"text":"I'm going to start out my review by saying this is my favorite place to get Sunday brunch in Champaign.  I almost took off a star for... reasons I will explain momentarily, but don't go thinking \"oh, only 4 stars, I can get this brunch elsewhere in town.\"  You can't.  It's also cheaper and better to go here than Jim Gould or Radio Maria, the other Sunday Brunch games in town.
I'm also hesitant to write a super glowing review because if suddenly everyone started to go there and I had a super long wait, I would cry.

The service used to be ridiculously bad, as previous reviews have stated, but obviously somebody had a word with somebody, because the last several times I have been there, this is no longer the case.

The omelets are delicious.  I don't like omelets because they're hard and brown on the outside, but not so at Luna.  Soft oozy egg.  I'm sure some people would say they're not cooked enough, but those people are just so wrong.  And the choices of omelet are delicious, as are the roasted potatoes and petite salad that comes with the omelet.
I get muesli every time I go, because I'm like that and it's Really Good, but if I weren't on a quasi-diet I'd get beignets instead.  

Admittedly, I tend to be more pro-coffee than pro-cocktail in the AM, but if you're the mimosa/bloody mary type, they've certainly got them.  I don't know where they get it, but the coffee is good too.

It's not perfect.  The cinnamon rolls were only ok.  I've had avocado issues.  One time the kitchen forgot to put it in the omelet, and the next time they didn't have avocado and the waiter didn't tell me my omelet was coming out sans avocado.  

A Chicago reviewer would say \"there are kinks.\"  I must say however, it's delicious, and you should totally go."}
{"text":"Among the best restaurants in Chambanavoy (I know that's not saying a whole lot, but still!)

Tapas is an awesome concept, and Luna does it well. They always have many small plates to choose from. Even though I'm vegetarian there are always plenty of things on the menu for me.

Food has ranged from mediocre to very good. Pesto burgers were definitely the former (I mean seriously, if you're going to mention pesto, shouldn't there be pesto involved in the dish?), roasted garlic was definitely the latter (so simple, so cheap, so tasty). I have to dock a star just because at Luna's price, I don't expect to see any mediocre dishes - and I've definitely had a few there.

Service has been very nice and friendly, but also very slow (and it's never been all that busy when I've been there, so that can't be used as an excuse). Put two hours on that meter and set a timer on your phone for 1:55 just in case.

It's a little spendy (expect to spend $25+/person + drinks), but if you want a nice meal in Chambanavoy this is about as good as it gets."}
{"text":"not sure who the last reviewers are but here is mine...

I came to Urbana from Chicago with my 13 year old son. We were here for a Science Olympiad competition and wanted a place that was unique and offered quality. I can say this was absolutely the best experience we had in Urbana. First the atmosphere was charming. We first sat on the patio and felt like we were really in Spain. Later we moved inside and my son mentioned how the architecture mixed modern local artists with a concrete loft feeling. 

As far as the food was concerned, we were very happy! The French inspiried Tapas were awesome. The seafood was cooked to perfection; the proportions were perfect. The wait staff were amazing. They told us what they thought they did best, then went into the kitchen to confirm what they could do that night. We felt like they really wanted us to enjoy our experience, and we did.

Dessert was fabulous; we had a raspberry napoleon which was presented flawlessly along with coffee and tea for my son. I finished with a Grand Marnier and I have to say I left more than happy!"}
{"text":"Food was overpriced and low quality.  Service was very slow during lunch hour and servers didn't bring out some drinks and amenities even after being asked twice.  Orders were messed up.  Very unorganized.  We ordered the Luna Club which was greasy and a salad which was drowned in dressing.  Had to ask for silverware.  2 hours for lunch is too long."}
{"text":"The reason this place went out of business was because it failed the health code inspections and violated many rules. The place was a hazard to the health of the general public."}
{"text":"So, when you show up at the restaurant and tell the hostess you love the menu online, and she replies 'Oh that?  We, like, changed our menu, like, 6 months ago'... and then you are seated in a completely empty restaurant when said restaurant is participating in the supposed restaurant week... you'd be concerned, right?  Yeah, my friend J and I were ready to bolt!  But...

Amazing drinks (none of which I can remember exactly, and the online menu doesn't show drinks beyond wine... one may have had cucumber in it..?).  Some pretty darn tasty small plates (none of which I can remember... and the online food menu looks the same as when I was there in mid-July).

Hate the location, at least 1-2 blocks away from anything else that's cool.  Our waitress was ditzy and couldn't handle us + the table of four women that came in after we'd been there for about 45 minutes, at the same time.  The restaurant week menu was lame with no real choices (I'm obviously spoiled in Detroit... and how sad is that... because we have OPTIONS with our restaurant week menus)."}
{"text":"I just read that this place was temporarily shut down by health inspectors for scoring -9 out of 100 on their inspection.  Disgusting!"}
{"text":"I have had two experiences at Luna Cafe, one of which was good. Went there a long time ago with my mom and little sister, and loved the atmosphere and thought the food was decent. 

The second time we went my entire family (8 of us) went after my little sister's graduation from high school. We made a reservation to do the \"Chef's Special\" meal in which you are given 8 to ten courses of tapas not on the menu that the chef creates.

We showed up at 5:30 or 6, when our reservation was, and they were very under prepared. We were also all STARVING, and my grandfather is diabetic, and after being seated requested some bread or a started to help tide us over until the food arrived. She brought the table of 8 four slices of bread. About a half an hour after arriving we got the first dish, and the others followed, each taking about 30 or so minutes. The dishes were EXTREMELY underwhelming, and the first 4 or 5 were cold. ONE shrimp, or ONE small slice of cheese. There is no way these could count as tapas. They were bites. Needless to say, very disappointing, not worth the hefty price tag."}
{"text":"After all the negative reviews, I was honestly kind of dreading going when my friends asked us out to dine there.  Cafe Luna changed my mind that night.  Now, honestly, I'd been to them back when they were on campus and thought it was homier and the food was actually a bit better, but we still had a really nice night at the new location and a really good meal.  Important note, they have entrees of course, but you can get by easily on their tasty tapas menu.
Here's what we had:
Mushroom and something crostini - the crostini was a little crispier than I would have preferred and it was quite salty, but my husband ate all of his and he hates mushrooms.
Walnut crusted goat cheese balls - WOW were these good.  The cheese was gooey and the bread perfect.  It was drizzled with just a smidge of honey that combined perfectly with it and everything oozed and spread over the bread.  YUM
Flank steak over potatoes - very tasty.  The meat was very tender and flavored well and the potatoes were done in just enough oil to be cooked well but not greasy.
Potato gnocchi - I didn't think I'd like this as I've only really had gnocchi's that are sooo filling.  These were nice and light, very tender and in a nicely seasoned white sauce.
Duck confit ravioli - these were so rich.  Probably one of my lesser yums of the night.  They were just a little too sweet, but I couldn't pinpoint what the taste I wasn't enjoying was coming from.  They were still ok.  
The crab cakes were good, but a little on the seafoody side (you know, just a whiff of that clam chowdery smell)  Plus, my personal preference for crab cakes is that I love them really crunchy and deep-fried-y.  They were not mushy, but not crisp.  The sauce they were served with really came to the rescue.  I could have just eaten a bowl of that sauce.  
Coconut shrimp - freaking awesome - not much more to say than \"wow!\"
The prosciutto crostini was good.  One of the guys traded his portion of another appetizer to obtain his wife's crostini...it wasn't THAT good :)  

We also had salads.  I hate beets so I avoided the special salad of the night even thought they graciously offered to not add beets.  I instead had the house herb dressing salad.  The dressing was great, but the local greens were just a bit too...earthy.  Like sometimes the base of the leaves tasted a little dirty, which I shouldn't complain about, because that's what it tastes like coming out of my garden too.  I think I'm mad about this because I was insanely jealous of my husbands salad, which involved an entire half of a pear, roasted with goat cheese and walnuts.  OOO it looked so good and he didn't even give me a bite! :)  Next time, I'll know what to get.

On to service...OK, so I've had some weird experiences there I guess.  This time that we went with our friends, the staff was amazing.  Friendly, and I don't mean the hassling you every 2 minutes and squatting down to take your order type of friendly.  Just genuinely nice and trying to be as helpful as possible, including knowing when to buzz off without being asked to.  The weird part is, I had been in twice before on seperate occasions to see about just getting a table on some random days.  Both times I entered the dining room and got looked at like I was some moron, why was I there?  I don't know what the deal was, but maybe those were the people that were garnering all those bad reviews and maybe they've all been fired because when we went this last time...wow,  excellent.  Enjoy.  I hope they stay consistent and I don't have to eat my words with a new review next time I go.  

Summary:  service is better now, order the roasted pear salad and my 2 favorite tapas are walnut/goat cheese balls and coconut shrimp."}
{"text":"I don't really go to places that are a bit nicer like Luna very often, usually frequenting greasy spoons, so I was both excited and nervous about coming here. The reviews are all over the place and many of them criticize the service. 

In my experience, it was the exact opposite. The service was perfect. We went full tapas and they were all expertly timed, the waitress was attentive but not to excess, and all the service was very prompt and friendly. The atmosphere was perfect, and I didn't recognize issues with being seated too close that some had.
The tapas themselves are where the place got knocked down to 3 stars. It was certainly good, but not particularly special - the concept of the dishes fit into the paradigm of slightly more upscale food than most places locally, but the taste couldn't keep up. Truffle fries were good, but not fantastic - missing a key essence that I can't put my finger on. The crostini were too chewy and awkward to eat, as was the bread in general. The charcuterie platter was edible, but lackluster. The ceviche and walnut-encrusted goat cheese with caramelized onions were excellent, but they couldn't carry the rest of the tapas - especially at the price. 

Overall, Luna isn't a bad restaurant, but it needs to try a little harder to live up to what it's trying to do."}
{"text":"Cafe Luna looks like a whorehouse from the outside, because it's in a long brick building lined with small windows and from the outside, the indoor lighting looks skanky. With that said, I like the lighting. The inside decor is just... trying too hard, and I never use that phrase. The silky pillows that match the walls do not work. 

Anyways, we ordered fried goat cheese balls, which was probably the best thing all night. The artichoke with brie sauce was a nice concept-- pluck off the leaves and dip in the little bowl of sauce that is the artichoke-- but the leaves barely had any meat on them, and were soggy and not very flavorful. My mom thought the artichoke had been frozen. The sauce, however, was very good without being too fondue-like. I ended up dipping bread in it. We also got the beef tenderloin, which was decent. It had a surprising heat... it wasn't even really spiciness, it was heat on the tip of my tongue and maybe once through my nose, but not a lingering hotness in my mouth. I thought it was similar to wasabi. It came with potatoes and onions that were perfectly cooked but plain. The cilantro-lemongrass pork rib was my favorite next to the goat cheese. The cilantro and lemongrass aren't very noticeable, in fact the flavors are kind of in the background. What I tasted was the meat, which was falling off the bone and really yummy. The creamy clams were gross. The sauce was pretty tasty, like a good alfredo, but the texture of the clams wasn't quite right. I thought they were too chewy and my friend didn't like how when she bit into them there was a lot of squirting action. The duck confit was a disappointment. The au jus (which I thought was chocolate at first... whatever) was really salty and the duck was just alright. My mom and friend really liked it, though. For dessert we had the cheesecake, which was very good and had fresh berries on it. 

The food was hit or miss, and I would probably go back here with specific tapas to avoid if it weren't for the awful service. Our waiter only came around to take our order, refill an iced tea once, give us the check, and come back to get the check when we were standing up and putting our coats on. We were always given our food by different people, and had to ask them for refills and such. I don't know why he wasn't more attentive, and I don't really care either... he got a shitty tip. Oh, I thought the prices were really good. We got all of that for fifty-five bucks. Cafe Luna just needs more polish on their food and better trained waiters."}
{"text":"The last time I ate at Luna, service and attention to detail in the kitchen was spotty, though the food was still delicious.

Thinking that everything would probably be fine this time, we decided to take my brother and his girlfriend (both visiting from NYC) for brunch this weekend.  I called up the night before and was surprised to hear that they were closed Thursday and Friday for Thanksgiving.  They would, however, be open at 10am for brunch on Saturday, according to the message on their machine.  So, I went ahead and made reservations for 10:30 the next morning on their website.

Cue 10:30 the next morning, and the doors are locked at Luna with nobody inside....and a note on their door saying they will be open at 10am on Saturday.

I tried calling twice.  It rang and rang and finally just beeped at me--not even the same message as the night before.  Just...nothing.

Classy."}
{"text":"I've been to Luna twice now in the past month and I have to admit I'm a fan of the food and pleased to say it's one of my favorite spots in Chambana. Great place to take a date. 

 As it is a tapas place I figured I'd be willing to try something new and different.  The one problem I had, which isn't too much of a problem, is that they changed their menu within the last time I was there.  So within the last month what i was looking forward to ordering was no longer on the menu...weird? Nevertheless, there were plenty of options the second time around for those who are vegetarian and those who are not.  

Some of the items on the menu were better than others, I would definitely recommend the roasted garlic spread.  It is practically the best thing on the menu and never disappoints. I imagine that will remain on the menu if nothing else does...One thing that I didn't enjoy was the prosciutto wrapped butternut squash. The squash was great, but the prosciutto was really crunchy and tasteless. 

Overall a solid restaurant.  If you are considering going to V. Picasso, which is in Urbana, think again. Not nearly as good and has a smaller/weirder selection of tapas."}
{"text":"I really SHOULD have enjoyed this place but they fell short a few too many times.  If I lived in the area, I would go back, but since I don't...I'll try other places during my next visit.

None of the staff seemed at all enthusiastic about serving us.  The bartender and hostess who dealt with us in the first few minutes were almost dour.  Our assigned server for the evening was helpful and satisfactory but not warm.  He did respond immediately and effectively to our request to light the tiki torches near our outside table, because there were a lot of gnats and mosquitos about.  He had to change out several of the wicks, but did it all within ten minutes or so.

The food was all right but way overpriced.  I try not to review negatively on price, but this was pretty egregious.  $6 for six spears of asparagus.  $6 each for crostinis (one olive and one mushroom) which came as four pieces and looked as if my eighth-grade home-ec partner could have made them.  We're talking slice of baguette, handful of sauteed mushrooms, slice of cheese, thrown together clumsily and broiled for a minute.  Come on guys.

The coconut shrimp and accompanying sauce were excellent.  The duck confit ravioli were also very good.  We didn't much care for the strawberry-rhubarb pork ribs, and although  my friend adores their mussels, I found them uninspiring.  He did order more bread just to soak up the leftover sauce.

We ordered a $20 carafe of sangria (not listed on the drink menu) which was tasty and elegantly served (wedges of strawberry and orange on the glass rims and blueberries mixed with the ice in each glass--a neat touch) but hardly seemed to have any alcohol.  Oh well."}
{"text":"Wait staff is slow.... The owner sits at the bar on his phone. He could help with coffee refills and be social... First and last time for me."}
{"text":"Tapas. We ordered the first seven appetizers on the menu and they were all perfect. How is that possible? All 7 appetizers perfectly done. We were not in a Michelin star restaurant in New York or LA. This was Champaign, Illinois- a university town. I did not expect such impeccably crafted food and such top notch service but then again I found it here. Food this good merits 5 stars. Deeply satisfying and perfect for a quiet date or even a night out with friends. 

Again, I only tried the tapas. I see no reason why the rest of the menu won't impress."}
{"text":"I have a few qualms with Luna. I want to love it, I really do, but I just can't. 

-The first time I went there was with a large party for Mom's weekend and we had a reservation. We ended up waiting an hour to be seated. There was no sitting area, just a hallway so it was rather uncomfortable. When we were finally seated, we had a delicious meal.

+Second time I went there was for a date with my boyfriend. We are both vegetarians and we had no problems finding enough food to eat. We left full and a little tipsy (good wine!).

-I went for a third time recently with my two roommates and it was a disaster. There was hardly anyone at the restaurant but we still had terrible service. They seemed understaffed, apparently due to rehearsal dinner going on simultaneously.  I can give some leeway on that, but there was no excuse for the kind of neglect we received. My friend had a very rare steak that took forever to be sent back. We were out of drinks for a very long time, and we needed other things that a more attentive waitress would have easily noticed. 

I want to love this place but service is a huge deal for me. It's disappointing that Luna can't excel in this because I do think they have some good food."}
{"text":"My favorite place to get brunch in this neck of the woods. The beignets and eggs benedict are killerrrr. I will say however the staff is a little too unattentive for a 5 star review"}
{"text":"Cafe Luna is lovely at lunch time, with tapas at dinner. I haven't been for dinner in a while, but it was great when I went a couple of years ago.  There's patio seating in nice weather, and an intimate dining room otherwise.

Cafe Luna is at the corner of 4th and Green in the funny wooden building - either go up the stairs from Green and turn to your left, or enter from the side entrance on 4th."}
{"text":"Food was good but not hot. Service was lacking and slow. With many empty tables it was a surprise that getting another drink or being offered dessert was difficult."}
{"text":"This was my first dining experience at Cafe Luna and unfortunately I cannot say it was great. 

Pros: the beignets were tasty and so was the sandwich. Nice portions as well. 

Cons: 

-I was seated without a menu. They could have at least said it would be a few minutes until the newly printed menus were ready. 

-I ordered the beignets and they forgot to put chocolate sauce on the plate. 

-The croque monsieur sandwich took about 35 minutes (I know baked menu items take longer but still...) and it wasn't even hot. 

I'll do Sunday brunch somewhere else!"}
{"text":"Unable to get in to the restaurant we wanted, discovered Luna by chance. Although it was busy, the host found us two seats at the bar, and we had a wonderful time. Although the bartender was new, and had to ask the host about our questions on the menu items, the service was lovely, ambiance very warm and inviting and the food superb! Every item we ordered was a symphony to our palettes. The owner/chef, Raquel Aikman, came out to inquire how we enjoyed it, and we had a lovely chat. Will be back!!"}
{"text":"Cafe Luna is a terrific place to get tapas.  I wouldn't say they are traditional in the sense that they are not Spanish inspired.. but they are good if you don't mind the price attached to it.  Oh.. and they are WAY better than Radio Maria's tapas.

Nice decor inside.. and since it was a weeknight (aka barely anybody in there), the waitress was VERY attentive.  I had one of their red wines by the glass and I enjoyed it thoroughly.  I even got a second glass.  

I had the deep fried artichoke and beet (pretty tasty but what is fried and not tasty right?), quail breast (very good and tender), scallops on a sweet potato hash (only two medium sized scallops for $14.. what a rip off), beef on crostini (good.. but not anything awesome), and the chocolate flourless cake (also good but nothing you couldn't make on your own).  It was a good meal.. the lighting is just right.

The two negatives are the price and the lack of parking.  A little pricier than you would hope for since they are small dishes not entrees.  Since it's on campus, I suppose you can walk but you would just rather have some place to park the car, no?"}
{"text":"Was down in good ole chambana visiting some friends and decided to go here for dinner on Sat night.  I had been to the old Cafe Luna when it was on Green St. in my college days.  Anyway, walked it, loved the decor!  We stood by the end of the bar waiting for like 5 minutes, someone came over and said someone would be over to help us.  Then we waited awkwardly for about 5 more minutes.  The same girl came over and was like, do you have a reservation?  We did not so she offered up the bar to have a drink and when a table opened we could sit.  We decided we were just going to eat and drink at the bar.  We got a bottle of chardonnay...it was pretty good and was glad that they knew that it was not oak-y.  We ordered a salad, melting brie pot and lobster & crab stuffed prawns.  Well, the salad was pretty good..but how can you mess up salad.  The melting pot brie....DISAPPOINTMENT!  I was expecting some sort of fondue or something...well it was little potatoes that were halved and spooned out, filled with brie that was melted.  I guess I should have asked but I thought that the name was self sufficient...WRONG.  The potato totally overpowered the brie and you could barely taste it.  I must admit, when I eat brie, I want to EAT brie...I like lots of it.  So I guess that was a bad selection.  Then the \"prawns\" came out....well it wasnt prawns at all.  It was one very small, what looked like, a crab cake, slathered in guacamole....weird....so we took a bite and were pretty confused so we asked about it because it said stuffed prawns on the menu...well, it so happens that they messed up the order and gave us the crabcake topped with wasabi guac...or something like that.  Their fault so they said they would bring the prawns right out....except the bartender came back from the kitchen and said that they were out of prawns but they could do it with regular shrimp.  We said fine.  They came out (four of them), not stuffed at all.  It literally looked like sauteed shrimp with a touch of crab meat around the edge...unimpressed.  Overall, the dinner was not that good and for the price of everything...it was really overpriced!  I liked the atmosphere but the food is less than desired and $$$.  However, the staff was super nice and always checking up on us.  I didnt have the heart to tell them that most of the food was not great....alas, I will not be going back to Luna."}
{"text":"Nice ambiance but portions are kinda small."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. Service was great-especially since it was spring break and it was not crowded. The tapas were great portions. Tried the walnut goat cheese balls with honey...divine!!!  The mussels in spicy curry were tasteful, not really spicy at all though. The slow cooked pork shoulder with baked apple, brie, and onion relish had a wonderful presentation.  Initially I thought the shredded pork was dry, but  eaten with onion relish, very tasty.  My husband had the pesto burgers with onion straws on a crostini, those three burgers disappeared so quickly from his plate, I didn't even get a little taste!? Overall an enjoyable dinner."}
{"text":"Maybe I'm not in the right crowd to enjoy the food. The feeling was far too pretentious for my taste, and the food was quite underwhelming."}
{"text":"Oh man. Croquette Madame and the Croque Monsieur. Seriously killer. It's so delicious and it has to be one of the best sandwiches in the city, by far. It's perfect for a brunch but filling enough for later on too. I also really love how beautiful this restaurant is, it's got a nice French shabby-chic look to it. It's usually fairly empty whenever I'm there, but it still takes a little time to get your food, which I don't mind. I definitely would recommend it anytime you're in town!"}
{"text":"The main thing I like about Tapas is that it lets you try a whole lot of different tastes in one meal so I was happy to find a place in Champaign that has it. 

I couldn't understand most of the things on the menu and I don't know what they were called there but I had some salmon appetizer with bread, NY Strip steak, Lobster with cauliflower and some vegetables, Crabcake, and the special dessert of the day which was pretty much some foreign sounding vanilla custard with raspberries on top. I asked for Medium well steak but it was definitely well done so it was ok. The salmon appetizer was good, I wish the bread was warmer though.The crabcakes and lobster were very good. 

The custard was typical and should have just been called custard instead of whatever fancy name it had.

If you want to have a good experience here, you should really consider having an appetizer, main course, dessert, and drinks. And bring at LEAST $40/person."}
{"text":"Today was my first visit to the new luna, and I was disappointed-- both because I really liked the old cafe luna, and because the new luna came well recommended.  

The decor in there is great:  very mod soothing old train station become chic tapas bar.  My initial visual assessment was highly optimistic.

We were seated quickly, but when we got to the table there were only 2 menus for 8 people.  The waitress apologized that they were \"short on menus.\"  I don't really understand that, because their menus are printed on paper and the dining area was half full, if that.  But, ok, they were short on menus.  (They also gave us mismatching water glasses.  I care zero about matching water glasses, except in a place that is trying soooooooooooooo hard to be all chic-chic.)

The menu shortage (??) probably wouldn't have been so bad (even when accompanied by the mismatched water glasses), but for the fact that they appeared to also be out of almost everything else.  Out of tuna.  Out of mussels.  Out of quiche of the day, risotto of the day, and quiche lorraine.  By noon on monday!  The feeling we had by the time our food showed up was that we basically had the picked over remnant dishes that no one else wanted. 

That impression was reinforced by the fact that my salmon chowder was definitely the worst soup I have ever been served in a restaurant.  In addition to not really having enough cream to really properly even be called a chowder, the salmon was off.  I would bet the price of the meal that that salmon was saturday (or friday, or thursday) special leftovers.  Yuck.  Oily salmon leftovers.  Neither I nor the other diner in our party who ordered it ate more than 2 bites.  

One of the diners in our party saw that I wasn't eating my soup and offered me a taste of hers.  Hers was only marginally better!  A tomato puree that had cinammon in it, for some reason.

One of our 8 orders came out wrong.  

Etc.  Etc.    

The waitress didn't charge us for the soup.  So, that was nice of her.  And she was really very nice and properly embarassed that they were out of everything and screwed up our order and gave us gross soup.  So pretty much one star is for the ambience and one star is for the nice waitress."}
