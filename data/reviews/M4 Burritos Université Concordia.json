{"text":"This is Montreal's answer to Chipotle. Everything I've had here is delicious. The seating area is wayyyyy to small though."}
{"text":"Not impressed. Clearly a poorly implemented Chipotle clone. Thirteen bucks for a small quesidilla and a soda. Very cheap with the chicken.  The most ridiculously watered down \"sour cream\" I have ever seen. Employees look miserable.  Tables and seating filthy. Leaving still hungry.  Never coming back."}
{"text":"Been going here for years. It hits the Chipotle spot, but the high prices, cold food, stinginess with the toppings warrants my 1-star rating. Did I mention the food poisoning? That's happened to me, and several of my friends after dining here. I've always held off writing a negative review because it's relatively new, so I gave it the benefit of the doubt, but enough is enough.   It should not cost almost $35 for two burritos with guacamole and two drinks. The gouge is too much."}
{"text":"They folded it wrong or they would have scored higher. Fresh n tasty! It's the Subway of burritos."}
{"text":"My friends and I would sometimes come here and buy tacos and burrito bowls to sneak back into the library during late night study sessions.  We're not really sure why we keep going back but the food is not very good, let me tell you. The burrito bowls are always bland no matter the combination we order and the tacos are like tiny little sleeping bags of disappointment-- bland disappointment.  Haha we'll probably keep going back though."}
{"text":"Extra charges for everything, 50 cents for lettuce? 75 cents for peppers, 1.50 for guacamole, has to be a joke"}
{"text":"similar to chipotle, decent and fast mexican food chain. the portion is good, with less selections of add ons than chipotle, but the taste is good. great for a quick grab if you are on the concordia campus"}
{"text":"The burritos here are huge and more importantly delicious ! I usually come here for the pulled pork, aka carne asada, mmm the meat is tender and juicy.... this place is about as close to the  west coast type burritos in the montreal area and the place where I come to get my fix !"}
{"text":"I think people should get a reward for finishing their meal, because the portions here are HUGE.  I had the braised beef burritos, tasted quite nice, loved the \"no freezer, no fryer, no microwave\" campaign. The fillings are tasty and the meat was very tender and juicy, although more seasoning would be appreciated (generally speaking, lack of salt & pepper).  The ingredients were made freshly, and there are no preservative tastes, however the burritos really needed some veggies to complement the heaviness of the meat and beans. There is just a lack of crunchiness from a refreshing salad or at least some lettuce leaves in the burritos, other than that, it's almost perfect.  I don't know what is the \"Chipotle\" chain that other Yelpers are talking about here, but I think this place is pretty good, food is great and the service was pretty fast. Another complain is that there is no washroom, and their Wi-Fi is not opened for the public (they probably should make it a private network, instead of a Wi-Fi named \"M4 BURRITOS\").  Great stuff, people should definitely try it out."}
{"text":"Very good burritos for a fast food. You can make them as you wish, put whatever you want inside. The ingredients were fresh, the cilantro, guacamole super good. We had the chips + guacamole with our burrito. Definitely better than 3 amigos and much cheaper."}
{"text":"While everyone waxes poetic about the heartwarming freshness of their ingredients, and how the \"such and such\" stuffed burrito that they had was large enough to take on Godzilla in an epic death match for sole possession of Mexico City, I will take the time to review what I'm pretty sure is the most under-represented item on their menu; their Chipotle Chocolate Brownie.  For just under two dollars you can get this tiny little brownie that looks as though they completely forgot to super-size it in relation to all their other goodies. But, while the desert IS small it is HUGE with flavour.   My first bite broke through the slightly crumbly crust and yielded a tentative nod to spiciness.  The second bite however... Oh my!  Not so hot as to raise beads of sweat but definitely spicy enough to let you know that you're alive the chocolate-chipotle heat took over my palate in a balanced attack of sweet and heat.    Absolute Noms! Oh, and the quesadilla was brilliant too."}
{"text":"They have average version of chipotle kind of Mexican food (I love chipotle), but my experience today is giving me second thought on whether I wanna go back or not.   3 weeks ago I called ahead for 3 salads with chicken. I went in to pay and noticed the salads were a bit hollow so I asked if there was chicken in there. The guy reassured me there was. I didn't question it at all until I went home. There was no chicken. Not in mine or my husband's or my friend's salad. I figured it was an honest mistake, but I called because I felt so hungry that I wanted to go back and get my chicken lol. They were closing and the lady asked me to come the next morning for my chicken. Seriously? I had a business trip the next day I will not pass by for just chicken in the morning.  Anyway, tonight (3 weeks later) I decided to go back for some dinner. I ordered and told the guy (very politely) about what happened. He actually remembered me. I jokingly said \"oh it was you who prepared the salad I knew you looked familiar\". He gave me the dirtiest stare and condescending attitude. I mean you could at least be nice for your literally ruined my dinner that night! I thought he would give me some sort of discount. Instead he was like \"you're coming after three weeks wanting reimbursement? I'm not a boss I can't do anything for you. I can't go around giving free food.\" He was very rude and was speaking to his colleague, in french, while pointing at me. He could of simply told me the manager is not here but if you would come back on this day she/he will be here and do something for me. The end. No need for the attitude, seriously. TBH if he was just nice about it, I don't care about the chicken.   Note to owner: you're staff needs a real attitude adjustment if you want to keep your customers. If this happened in the US I would of gotten my meal for free, extra chips to go with it AND a smile.  Side Note: I don't understand why the french people here keep making me hate them. Just be nice please, it's not that hard really. You're ruining Montr√©al for the rest of the people who are actually really nice."}
{"text":"Most disgusting burrito I've ever had. This place is a wannabe Chipotle. The rice was undertook, the beans were revolting and the guacamole was terrible. I was biting into raw rice. I highly recommend not to eat there. Hopefully a chipotle will come to Montreal and then M4 can leave!"}
{"text":"Oh man, what a burrito   As close as we'll get to Chipotle in our fair city.  I normally go for the steak on rice before they run out.  I had a coupon for carnita pork this time and was not disappointed.  All the ingredients mix well together ( rice, beans, cheese). The meat was shredded and flavourful.  The nachos are just OK, but the various sauces bring it up a notch.  They serve hibiscus and ice t next to the soda machine"}
{"text":"M4 recently opened up in the Concordia quarter, it's not bad. I've eaten at Chipotle a few times in the US and it's the same concept. The staff here are helpful and my braised beef burrito tasted good, topped with some guac, pico, and veggies, drizzled in their amazing mango habanero hot sauce.  The restaurant is small, but can seat a decent amount of people inside or outside. They have a range of drinks and alcoholic beverages to choose from too.   M4 is definitely a good choice if you're looking for something customized and quick, with a kick of alcohol (or not). Check it out, it's not bad."}
{"text":"I dont know if it was because we got there an hour before closing but the rice in out burrito and burrito bowl were hard as rock. It was like chewing pebbles. But overall, a very decent price and not so bad for a burrito place.   The ambiance on the other hand was kind pf unusual.. the background music was heavy metal and the seating was very close together, i was basically in my neighbor's conversation."}
{"text":"What a ridiculous move by the owner. He's a cheap guy, wow now they charge $0.50 for lettuce. A pinch of lettuce not standard, but 50 cents, thats absolutely ridiculous! Plus $1 extra for a teaspoon of sour cream. The guys making your burrito wont even tell you until its time to pay. Time to smarten up and take that away. The place only gets 2 stars for the food tAste which is pretty good otherwise, but service lacks big."}
{"text":"Awesome burrito bowls, chicken is better quality (real white meat) than chipotle in the states! The green salsa is really yum as well. Great addition to columbia. Wish were open longer hours! Also, wish they offered corn tacos."}
{"text":"This place is pretty cool, like subway but Mexican :) You get a choice of meat or veggies, choice of burrito, taco, salad or quesadilla style, choice of a couple salsas and then the extras. It's all pretty tasty but they definitely skimp on the cheese. I haven't been brave enough to try the spicy salsas and stick with the pico de gallo, you also have a choice of white or black beans with the burrito option. The meats could use more taste but all in all a pretty cool place and the staff is nice and efficient."}
{"text":"Not amazing, but better than I was expecting. I previously had gone to another M4 burrito and had a horrible meal so this really surprised me.  I got a small beef burrito to go on my way to class and it's the most efficient way to dine on the go. Minimal spillage and maximum belly fullness.  I got the cookie and drink combo and it was 11$, a really good deal!   Service is medium speed depending on who is before you.  This is now my last minute dinner place."}
{"text":"Ok, this is just terrible. This place is near enough my office that it means I sometimes forget how terrible it actually is and end up eating there again.  Last time  I ordered a burrito bowl with Carnita pork and all the fixings, and it was one of the most tasteless, bland plate of food I had the dubious honour of eating in a very long time. Rice was hard, the salsas were bland, as were the pork.  2 stars because the people working there are actually very nice."}
{"text":"Really don't know why i keep giving this place a chance. Went back thete again today after the awful experience a few months ago and its the same ol story. Watery burrito dry chicken, dryer beans toppings very meh with akward options. Too good of a location to be this bad."}
{"text":"They definitely should not be explicitly referencing the mission burrito because it doesn't even come close. In fact, even though they've ripped the concept, M4 burrito doesn't even stand up to Chipotle. I will start by saying that no matter how many different ingredients they heaped onto my chicken burrito, the entire thing tasted only of vinegar and mushy overcooked food. The burrito, wrapped in foil, was served to me on a dirty metal tray, no paper lining or anything. The burrito was so soggy by the time I walked 5 feet to my seat that it just fell apart onto the tray. I wasn't about to eat off of a filthy tray so I only ate the bit that didn't fall apart. At $12 for a burrito with guac, it was a giant ripoff. Chipotle gets away with similar pricing because they get the little things right and care about customer satisfaction. One thing that Chipotle gets right is friendliness of the counter staff - they always great you and do an excellent job of explaining the concept. Here, the staff were miserable lumps who couldn't give a damn.  Never again."}
{"text":"OK, this place deserves a way better rating than it currently has. Recently I came back from Texas, where I enjoyed some pretty great Mexican food. This place isn't authentically Mexican of course, but the choices are pretty tasty and fulfilling for a decent price, and fast. It's located on De Maisonneuve just outside of Concordia's GM building, so very convenient for me to pop down for a quick treat of a lunch.   I've had the beef quesadillas and burrito, and both were savoury and satisfying. The beef carnita was verrrry good. Both my lunch date and I were \"mmmmmmmmmm\"ing the whole time we ate, happy with our choices to the last bite. I didn't really like having to pay an extra $2.50 for guacamole on my quesadilla, but it still def beats the other food choices within the same one block radius! My only eyebrow-raising criticism is that what they call \"spicy\" is not even remotely spicy, so if you are craving the lip-numbing, gut-burning heat of legit spicy food, you won't find it here. They do offer hot sauces at the utensil station, so you can ramp it up a bit yourself, though.   They have jugs of ice water available, so you don't need to order a drink with lunch if you like to avoid the sugary syrup water (soda) like I do. There are no bathrooms, but they do have a hand sanitizer pump right next to the cutlery and napkins. Seating is limited, but I didn't have any problem getting a table. I'll be heading back for sure."}
{"text":"I was window shopping for a good place to eat before my 8:30pm class and I noticed M4 Burrito. I absolutely LOVE chipotle, I go everytime I'm in NYC. So I decided to give this place a chance, considering it looked similar to Chipotle's concept.   I recommend getting the bowl, you get more quantity for your buck. Barbacoa is my go-to when I'm at Chipotle, I got the same at M4. It was decent but no competition for Chipotle. It has a spicy kick at Chipotle, M4 didn't deliver that. I usually get black beans but they seemed a little dry compared to the white beans. However the white beans reminded me of canned beans in maple syrup (no thanks) lol - It just isn't in my taste buds.   Extra ($) for guacamole.   Announced that you could get a discount off of MyPiece app but unfortunately the resto didn't appear in the MyPiece app.   I honestly didn't enjoy their pineapple and mango salsa but the rest was pretty good.   Customer service from two girls (both of them had part of their heads shaved) was AMAZING. Super friendly (both in English and in French)   Downfall: Food got a little cold because the door kept opening. I recommend taking it to go and finding somewhere else to eat."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Mission style burritos so I was thrilled when the first M4 Burritos opened up in the Latin Quarter.  Another M4 Burritos just popped up near Concordia University making it a perfect lunch spot during the work week.  Tucked into a small awkward location near an alley on Maisonnueve but manages to draw in a steady stream of students.  The decor is almost identical to the M4 on St. Denis, as is the food and the prices which is to say they are all pretty decent and about what you can expect from a fast food chain in Montreal. The staff are reasonably friendly though a bit scatterbrained, but that's to be expected from a bunch of college kids.  The seating arrangements definitely leave something to be desired.  It's a small restaurant with only about a dozen seats in the dining area which wouldn't be so bad except the seats are arranged in the shape of a square.  There's barely enough room to maneuver if you are lucky enough to actually find an empty seat.  While I might gripe about the seating and would certainly like to see lower prices and more attentive staff, I'm still stoked.  Finally, I have access to mission style burritos close enough to the office that I can swing by during my lunch break and get my fill. If you haven't tried one, you're missing out."}
{"text":"Decided to stop in for a quick bite while shopping as this was the only spot that was empty nearby, and I was on a schedule.   As I walked in I first noticed that the place was not very clean; the trays were stacked up, empty bottles on the trash can, and the tables could have used a wipe down. There was two people on staff, one was prepping while the other welcomed me at the counter. Pleased my order for a burrito, chose my fillings including chicken, brown rice, black beans, cheese, salsa verde, and paid 1.25$ extra for the guacamole.   The burrito was messy, and although the chicken was dry, the rest of the ingredients made up for it. The wrap itself was so thin that it was falling apart so my ingredients were falling out and the salsa was a little too runny so in all, disaster! Overall, the food wasn't bad but could be better. The jaritos mandarin made the experience a little better."}
{"text":"i am a big Chipotle fan.. so went in expecting it to be sub par to my fav place ever to eat when I am in the US or Toronto.. I ordered chicken bowl with white rice and white beans.. and I gotta tell you its pretty decent stuff.. and comes pretty close to Chipotle (if Chipotle is a 10, M4 is a 7)... so until Chipotle takes its sweet time to come to Montreal I will be partaking in M4...   i did not find it too expensive.. i paid $20 taxes in for two bowls..   service was good as well - get in and out in less than few minutes.."}
{"text":"This review is solely about the burrito bowl. I would give the place a 3.5 star if I could. My friend ordered the burrito and was very disappointed as the wrap was soggy within mintues and the chicken was dry and tasted fake.  I ordered the veggie bowl which comes with rice, beans, guacamole, cheese, and other toppings that you choose yourself. Unfortunately when I was ordering, all the ingredients were running low so I think I ended up getting a smaller portion than I was supposed to. Also, it was not warm at all and I could tell that the ingredients had been sitting there for a while. However, I found it really tasty. The yellow rice was good and I had a combination of both the salty and sweet beans which I enjoyed. The guacamole was fresh and they give a nice big portion. It is included in the veggie bowl but costs extra for the other types of bowls if I remember correctly.   They were offering a student discount which is smart since it is located right next to Concordia. The prices are very good and the staff were helpful.   Overall I would go back and try it again. Nice alternative to the usual fast food."}
{"text":"Ok, there are gonna be two kinds of people who read this review: those who've eaten at Chipotle, and those who haven't. My apologies if you find yourself in the latter category.  So for whatever reason--I suspect provincial politics are to blame--there are no Chipotle locations in Montreal, though they are present in most other major Canadian cities. That might have been ok. I'm not a slave to the Chipotle brand, but I do recognize and detest the thinly disguised and poorly executed imitation that is M4 Burritos.  But ok, all this aside, right? Who cares if someone looked at someone else's good idea and capitalized on an open market. Let's get down to the grit. Let's talk about why I'd recommend you avoid M4.  1) Almost without fail, the meat (chicken, steak, barbecoa) is dry, poorly seasoned, or outright unavailable 2) Tortilla's are never right. They're dry, they rip, they tear, no one's happy 3) You'll get charged for even the slightest deviations from what their menu covers. Want grilled veggies? Extra. Want a tortilla with your salad bowl? Extra. Oh, and don't expect them to give you much of anything. Last I ordered a burrito bowl at M4 the girl didn't even fill it, as in I could still see the bottom of the tin, and when I asked for her to bulk it up she told me she would have to charge me extra 4) So you pay a lot and you don't really get that much food. And despite all the \"Quebec local\" fuss, the food doesn't even taste that great  Chipotle if you're reading this, HELP!"}
{"text":"I don't know why I keep giving this place chances. One of the most mediocre burritos I've ever had, and overpriced. Fillings are not even very good and they're surprisingly stingy with it. They also don't roll their burritos tight enough and don't grill them, so the thing doesn't hold together in your hands very well. Never going back here."}
