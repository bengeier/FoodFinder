{"text":"Terrible service, terrible food. Upon our arrival, they let us know that we would. We'd to wait 15 to 20 mins because they were busy. We agreed (although there were only 3 tables and 2 servers). Then, after ordering our food, the pozole was extremely salty and the tostada Chacalosa had nothing but cucumbers and onions. This was so bad that after 5 years of using yelp, this is my first yelp review."}
{"text":"This is my first time eating at this place the place looks really clean the staff looks really nice and as soon as I got here they gave me sit me down and asked me what I wanted to drink they have really good Micheladas also I asked the waitress what was good too she said that the shrimp was really good she wasn't lying also order the shrimp tostada also really good my kids decided to order a quesadilla so a really good place to come to I will recommend this place"}
{"text":"Been here 4 times and have to say each and every time was a great experience. Delicious food and unique drinks. Love the concept. Kudos to management for cleanliness and attentiveness!"}
{"text":"Love the food and atmosphere!! Owners and staff are amazing they treat you like family!! Love this place great happy hour and specialty drinks!! Fish and shrimp tacos are amazing!!! Taco Tuesdays are great here 1.95 tacos can't beat that!!!!!"}
{"text":"Worst  service that I've had in a long time. Ordered an appetizer,Never arrived. 20 mins before anyone approached our table. The food was mediocre at best."}
{"text":"Came here because it was a local restaurant. Food was great! Service was great! Manager even came by to check and make sure all was good. We were in and over in less than 45 minutes for 2 people on a Saturday night I would say that's pretty good service!"}
{"text":"Grading this on a huge curve since I went opening weekend. I knew going in that they were still finding their groove - No problem. Mostly all good except...read on:
Ordered the steak sandwich - good flavor - the steak needed a little more trimming,  pieces of fat hanging off the ends. Bread was a little too big for the size of the steak you get. The sandwich was cut in 1/2 so ended putting all the steak on one side of the bread.  
Coconut shrimp appetizer. Came with the meal instead of before again no problem. The coconut was a little burnt but the shrimp was still very tender. Tasty. Ordered 3 tacos. Shrimp, carne asada and fish. Enjoyed all 3 very much. Shrimp and carne asada were my favorites.  The menu is heavy on seafood which is good.  No burritos or enchiladas to be found. We were told the menus went finalized so could change.  On a last note and the most disappointing was the house Margarita. It was not good. It came out fizzing with bubbles. So they are using soda water or sprite. It was just blah could not taste any tequila, plus the bubbles were off putting for a Margarita. hope they find a GOOD recipe for their margaritas. I'll give them another shot. Again good flavor on the food."}
{"text":"This is a very clean and affordable seafood mexican fusion location. From fish and chips or stuffed shrimp fillet to sushi, you will not be disappointed. The fish and chips are AMAZING! The beer batter is light and crispy not thick and mush like most. You can tell its fresh! I highly recommend this family oriented restaurant. Live in the west valley and want quality at an affordable price? The come here! You wont be disappointed."}
{"text":"Holy Salt. Had the fajitas and they were beyond salty. Also ordered a shrimp cocktail and the salt was unbearable. Staff is gross as well and owner was drunk at bar."}
{"text":"Fried calamari was over cooked but the fish tacos were really good.  Service was really good as well."}
{"text":"Taco Tuesdays are the bomb here! A nice place on the westside, not super crowded and the food and service is great. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Bad first impression. Did not acknowledge us when we walked in for about 10 minutes as servers passed by us. When they finally greeted us they turned us down because they had a party of 30 that had just walked in and we were only a party of 4 and they had about 5 tables available still. So you're a new restaurant that can only accommodate no more than 30 people for lunch on a friday, not good."}
{"text":"Came in for dinner with my wife loved the fresh seafood great atmosphere and service is great and knowledgeable at the menu had an amazing server named Steph that took great care of us and recomended us awesome dishes !! You must try the fillete stuffed with cream cheese and bacon !!! Best coconut shrimp ever  !!!! Everything on the menu is exquisite!! Love this place will be back for sushi!!!!"}
{"text":"Great place to have lunch or dinner. Such a great variety of food and does not lack in taste.Stuffed peppers and the fish and chips are the best this side of the valley.  Truly a jewel in the desert, I plan on visiting again."}
{"text":"Food, drinks, and service are excellent. New favorite Mexican food place. Authentic and tasty. Will be coming here again."}
{"text":"I really wanted to check the place out based on the pics. I asked about specialty drinks because of what I saw here and all I was given was a Michelada option. Food was slow to arrive and it wasn't busy. The place has a nice feel and def potential. Seems like the bar area has it's local feel which was cool."}
{"text":"First, let's consider the chips and salsa.  The chips were not overly salted.  I appreciate that.

The salsa was a bit on the bland side.  I asked my server if they had anything hotter.  Boy do they!  She brought me about 3 ounces of ghost pepper salsa.  You could strip paint off a freight train with that. I dumped half of that into the plain salsa and BOOM, 100% better.

I ordered an enchilada platter with red sauce.  The rice _looked_ plain but had a garlic flavor.  Not a big fan of the rice.  The refried beans were smooth and flavorful.  The enchilada sauce could do do with some tweaking, as it was not my favorite (some spice I can't put my finger on).  Overall a good meal though.

The strange thing is, their menu is all over the map.  Mexican food, fish and chips, and wait for it: Sushi!  I have to question what their core passion for food is.  I think they could do better by being awesome in one style of food.  I have never once considered that a California roll would enhance a plate of Carne Guisada."}
{"text":"Came for lunch time and had nothing but a great time. Awesome set up, lots of TVs, comfortable and positive environment. Best thing was the customer service. Food came really fast and we were approached by multiple employees making sure we had everything we wanted/needed. Definitely recommend this place if your considering it!"}
{"text":"Greeted coming in -no
Bloody Mary - can't make 
Medium steak - cooked well 
Coming back - no

No apology for over cooked food.  The manager never looked our way and server just left.  No goodbye on leaving.  Obviously if you aren't a regular you don't matter.  Too bad red sauce was awesome!"}
{"text":"Al Pastor anyone? There is a gentleman with the vertical Rotisserie with the pork and pineapple on the Patio with all the fixings! Great conversation. You can eat them on the side walk or inside. On the inside you have great seatings to watch the games and polite servers. The fish and chips are \"fresh out the oil\" and they are fantastic. On a separate night I had a Chimichanga with rice and beans and while watching OKC and Philly go triple overtime they kept they beers coming.  Nice clean modern place in the West. Check it out!"}
{"text":"Pretty great location for the west valley residents, the food is amazing here and so are. I went on a Friday evening for dinner with friends , I ordered camarones ala diabla and a side tostada with shrimp ceviche. Overall good experience, the only downfall to this place was how slow the service was & keep in mind it wasn't ridiculously busy. However our waitress was sweet and nice. I would come back ."}
{"text":"Wow! The service and food is amazing! Not another Mexican restaurant in Phx that can compare."}
{"text":"Well, we went in with high hopes since it was recommended but mexican food, sushi its not. No sushi or mexican dishes, they had seafood, pasta, salads and appetizers. We had a fish taco, so so but nothing to brag about and not worth the price for the small pc of fish but looked pretty and nice, wings same like any pizza joint so average, ceviche which is over priced for the size, not authentic style, was dry shrimp with no flavor, very bland, and I had a salad w a few fruit, jicama no meat that was a handful of letuce tossed w dressing w non flavored dressing and certainly not worth 10.00 for the small bowl. I finally just tossed my ceviche in salad to spruce up flavor since at this point I was disappointed. My husband I think had a decent plate of 3 small fish and chips. Colorful plates yes and they look nice but food taste is missed. Place is beautifully decorated with kind people but wish the food was better. Thinking mexican there would be chips and salsa or beans but not here."}
{"text":"Went in on Friday8/26 this soft opening. There was 10 of us there with hungry bellies. We wanted to try the restaurant because of location. This place is 1 min away from home. They state they serve mexican sushi and pasta. Wanted to try sushi but its not ready yet. Settled for some dishes, heres what we got...
1. Wings appetizer.. I mean samething you would get at pizza joint
2. Onion rings...was a bit oily
3. Chicken alfredo- but no cream had to ask for a side of it
4. Seared Ahi Tuna-it was not seared it was medium well
5. Fish and chips- it was good but they did not have tarter sauce
6. Shrimp mushroom pasta with cream- that was good: recommend that!
The atmosphere was open concept and very clean and modern our waitress was very attentive. Overall the food should be the selling point and at this time were not impressed. It dosent hurt to try, a little pricey as well but we took a chance!"}
{"text":"Second visit and service and food has been great!! Stuff peppers, carne asada tacos, shrimp tacos, fish tacos and menudo all have been tasty! Great location and they have the NFL ticket!"}
{"text":"I'm always looking for a good fish taco in the valley and I finally found my spot....amazing & fresh, had a Carne Asada street taco, meat was tender...loooooved it! I also tried for the first time fried sushi which I heard from the owner it's a good way to work up to Sushi (raw) for those who aren't sure and I completely agree, check out my pic...great food presentation, took a few to my niece who tried and went this afternoon...the food spoke for itself, she was a happy customer; I heard. 

Ok so the light fixtures are gorgeous! It's a must try, but get ready to become a regular!"}
{"text":"I consider myself an expert in fish tacos. This place has the best fish taco I've ever had, hands down! Kim, our waitress was even better! Great atmosphere, great people, you can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Discovered this place accidentally when googling places nearby to get sushi. It didn't sound like a typical sushi place so I almost wrote it off as a fluke. I took a look at their website and became intrigued. So I decided to eat their with my boyfriend. He hates sushi so this place looked like a good compromise. We both loved it. I ordered two sushi rolls and was surprised at how big they were. I couldn't finish them. He got the enchiladas. Finally a place where you can get sushi or Mexican food without feeling like you are risking food poisoning. The pricing is also pretty decent. It also has a pretty romantic atmosphere. The dim lighting and gorgeous light fixtures really made the place even more enjoyable. All in all I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Eh. Overpriced for what you get. We usually love mojaete (the big bowl with lots of meat), and it came with mayyyyybe 3OZ of meat. The red sauce just tasted like cheap enchilada sauce you get from a can. The al pastor taco was good but small and the shrimp tostada was good, but not worth the price. Service was OK. Decent beer selection. We won't we back due to the low value."}
{"text":"Served quickly.  Server was polite and ready to answer any questions we had. Food came out fast and hot.  My husband loved the meal he got.  Fish stuffed with cream cheese, shrimp, and wrapped in bacon with garlic bread and pasta in the side. So much he couldn't finish it all! A bit expensive for us but well worth it."}
{"text":"Customer service nightmare. Food was alright, nothing I'd pay to eat again. But the customer service was so awful. The waitress was friendly, but not attentive at all. When we asked for a couple more mins to decide what we wanted, she gave us 15. And when it came time to pay ... we sat and waited about another 15 mins just for her to notice we were ready for the bill. Meanwhile her and other employees are hanging around the bar socializing. Cleanliness is also subpar here. Plus if you want water, you're going to get Tap. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Good food & service. Love their chips and salsa. Wednesday wing special is delicious and great deal. Only negative is they don't do carry out."}
{"text":"Chips and salsa were very tasty with some kick.  Carne Asada tacos, meat was bit bland and chewy.  Ordered the coconut shrimp entree.  Shrimp was large and tasty.  Ordered it with the pasta.  Big mistake.  Pasta was over kicked and awful and the white sauce was goop and taste was off putting.  If we go back would get the coconut shrimp again but with rice instead of pasta.  Prices okay.  Not a great value but didn't feel ripped off"}
{"text":"After being in the house all day I wanted to get out of the house and eat some good food with a comfortable/upbeat environment. I wasn't interested in going to a big restaurant chain, but sadly those were the only restaurants that came to mind. I drove by Casa de Plata and immediately made a U-turn. 

My first impression 1. local business, good 2. cool art work, good 3. they have a bar, good 4. they were watching football and had Spanish music on, winning!!!

The food was great and they have an alternative to chips and salsa a refreshing bright idea I haven't seen anywhere else. The working team were nice and easy to talk to. 
Area of opportunity: If the waitress or waiter packs my left over food to go I really feel like they took care of me from start to finish. 

Best thing: Free Wifi so I could do my homework :)"}
{"text":"Great food. My wife enjoyed her shrimp and I enjoyed my sea food alfredo. Garlic bread with it was awesome. Definitely will come back. Recomend it over anything else in the area."}
{"text":"This is our first time here and are very impress. Foood is amazing here!! The staff are very friendly!! We had the oysters, filete al mojo de ajo, filete primavera and tostada de pescado. They were all flavorful. I will definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"If I could give this place 0 stars, I would.  Waitress was slow as hell, orders were messed up and we were told it is human error that we could all make (instead of apologizing), and food sucked and took forever.  The worst part was both waitresses and the manager arguing and \"I know\"-ing us after the messed up orders."}
{"text":"Very pleasantly impressed by this new restaurant. Eclectic menu with some very original dishes. If you come in expecting traditional Mexican restaurant faire, you will not find it.  Instead you'll find original and delectable offerings that will keep you wanting to come back for more. The service was outstanding with a bartender that knew the menu inside and out.  Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"I went there for this first time on Sunday and we ordered \"El Molcajete\" and it was so good ! I love there presentation on there entrees. Very Unique. My only advice is get a bigger salsa bowl... but other then that it was amazing & there chips and salsa is sooooo addicting."}
{"text":"Food is overpriced. The molcajete had about five small strips of steak served in sauce with barely any beans. Complimentary bread was okay but burned. The sign outside said they served sushi but they actually did not. Not worth the money, in my opinion. Portions are too conservative for what they charge."}
{"text":"Very well served & season to perfection. Nice location, no loud mariachi like the other places. You can enjoy your food with family & friends & still enjoy a good conversation with everyone. Good happy hour too, definitely coming back here."}
{"text":"Visiting Phoenix this weekend and happen upon this magical place!!! I've only started with the appetizer and already had to give my 5 stars. Will update after the entrees !!

Update, we had between my family and I the shrimp tacos, the seafood pasta, the New Orleans Pasta and the scallop appetizer. You can watch as they are making their magic back there to bring you the plates. Drinks were also amazing, only complaint is not having any self control and having a hangover this morning. Let's see what their breakfast has in store for us today.


Update, this past weekend 5/20/17 we had my husbands retirement dinner there, I have to stay they really outdid themselves. Wanted to update the review with more pictures. Thank You so much!"}
{"text":"Surprised on high reviews, maybe just a one time glitch. Molcajete was not good at all, beef was tender but they used canned enchilada sauce in my opinion, not sure, maybe I'm so used to the molcajete from El Monte CA. La Barca Jalisco, my wife had some liquidity shrimp soup, again, shrimp cook properly but not a good combination, my daughter had fish ceviche, she liked it, service could be better, place looks very nice but that's it

Sorry, not coming back for seconds"}
{"text":"From the reviews, I was under the impression that this place would be heavenly. For the price and taste, this place does not exceed expectations. I would say there is nothing original about the flavors or dishes. The menu items are an attempt of Asian fusion; however, it was far from meeting it's goal. I had the carne asada tacos and al pastor which were made outside. If tacos is what u want, I suggest going to a taco truck where these have more flavor. My boyfriend had the mahi. Again, no flavor. It tasted like any plain white fish."}
{"text":"This little Resturant is tucked away in the shopping plaza next to planet Hollywood. We stopped in after reading some Yelp reviews just to try it out and it was not bad. I had the ceviche tostada and my fiancé had chorizo egg burrito made into a plate. I like the decor of the restaurant and I think it will go far if they have proper people hired to keep it going.
One or two bad employees can ruin your beginning.
Our waitress was nice but it seemed the other girls didn't want to participate in helpin eachother out wth tables and food so that was discouraging to see. But our waitress was sweet and very down to earth and we enjoyed the food. It wasn't bad.
I didn't like the watery salsa but that's not a deal breaker for me. Happy Eats!!"}
{"text":"We visited Casa de Plata last night for the first time to celebrate my husband's birthday. We were so impressed with the drinks and food. We started with the fried coconut shrimp which were very flavorful and filling. We ordered the molcajate, Creole shrimp pasta, fish, and campechana. Each of us loved our meals. The molcajate was full of whole pinto beans, grilled beef and chicken, and your choice of red or green sauce. We ordered it with the green sauce. It was bubbling hot and full of flavor. The Creole shrimp had just the right amount of spice and the pasta is was served over was very creamy and cheesy. The campechana contained a lot of seafood and was full of flavor. The fish contained a green sauce on top which was slightly salty, but full of flavor. You must try the Diablo Margarita, it was delicious! We will be back soon and make this one of our \"usual\" dining places from now on."}
{"text":"Been meaning to try this place out due to some friends posts. Finally! I remembered and tried this place. I was starving when I went and wanted to order everything. I got menudo which was just ok. It was kinda greasy and bland. I've had better menudo. I didn't finish it cause my tummy and grease don't do well. I also got the ceviche pescado which was so flippin' good!! Only ate about half due to finishing off the chips and salsa and the fact that they give you so much. The ceviche is so fresh and packed full of flavor. Can't wait to go back and try more seafood items."}
{"text":"I'm so mad I've lived next to this place for months and just now tried it. It was amazing! From the chips and salsa to the ceviche!! The deco was nice too. The waitress was super sweet and attentive. The food omg the fooood ... I can't wait to go back and try something else."}
{"text":"This was our first time here. The waitress is horrible. The bartender is a better server than the waitress is. He has been trying to make sure we are getting what we need since I had to walk to the bar to get a beer because the server after 20 minutes of an order still hadn't brought anything.  Maybe I needed to sit at the table with the beautiful Hispanic ladies as they are being doted over. 
The appetizer came with the main meal, the fish was so salty we gave it back and are leaving. We won't be back.
2 stars is only because of the bartender."}
{"text":"Went here last night.. had ceviche tostadas and it was very delicious and fresh!! I will for sure go back. Place was friendly and very clean"}
{"text":"Yummm 

Must try fish tacos, shrimp taco, Plata Rolll & stuffed pineapple you won't regret it...! Decor is interesting and beautiful.! Very clean establishment. They have a full bar & plenty of popular beers on tap. & it is family owned that's a big plus. I live very close' excited to stop by Sunday for posole.!"}
{"text":"Ok I love this place! Driving up to it you wouldn't think much about it and might even pass it by. 
A friend suggested it to us, so my SBL (Sexy Bearded Lover) and I thought we would try it out. 
Walked in and was completely surprised at the beautiful lighting and the cool 80's Latino music playing. It has a super chill vibe in there and you immediately feel comfortable. 
We sat down and ordered the trash can nachos for an appetizer. First off they are life changing. 
They are brought out in a bottomless bucket that's turned upside down and unveiled before your eyes, and in one smooth lift of the container your life is forever changed. I know we heard the Jesus music in the background, how could you not. 
The nachos stay mostly the shape of the bucket, but when they become unhinged, it hits you that this pile of cheesy awesome chicken and creamy goodness is bigger than your head. I'm not kidding, this pile of crunchy, salty freakishly addictive nachos is one of the best things we have found... ever.
We ate and ate and realized that our main dish needed to be a la cart. We ordered the carne asada and pastor street tacos and a few fish tacos to mix it up. Again, some of the most excellent food we have had to date. The street taco meat was never dry or chewy, but only moist, and flavorful; my mouth literally thanked me for ordering them. The fish tacos were made with love and everything was beautiful on the plate. We left there full, fat and happy. Can one ask for anything else when dining out? I think not. 
PS. The pastor tacos come with a slice of the sweetest pineapple, making that particular taco this Yelpers all time favorite. It's really not even right how perfect the food was there. Definitely a 10 on the it was so good it was stupid meter. 
End scene"}
{"text":"Food was good. However, when you have to get your own food to feed your children I have an issue with that. They offer Sushi...Where was it at? They made some lame ass excuse and the General Manager Miguel is a waste of payroll and probably drunk himself. This is the 3rd time I've went there and each time epic FAILURE!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I were a little sceptical at first. Seeing that it served Sushi, Mariscos, Mexican and Italian food all at the same place. Kinda made you think, okay something has got to be terrible here. 
We were so wrong. I had the seven sea soup and my wife had the chicken Alfredo. It was the best we have ever tasted. Serving size was great, the food was hot and the customer service was amazing. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to family and friends."}
{"text":"We have been there twice now. First time i had fish tacos. 3.95$ each. They were yummy. Price is okay. Second time we went they were nice enough to put some soccer on for me. That day i had chicken alfredo. The price was really great. I remember it to be 12$. I also had a piña colada (7$). It was good. So bottom line, food is really good."}
{"text":"This is our 3rd time coming here and the first 2 visitz everything went well.  This time, our visit sucked!  The place was dead got a server (Alyssa)seemed little overwhelmed which I didn't get since the place was pretty much empty.  She took our order and she didn't appear to be friendly or anything..wondered she got called in on her day off maybe?? Anywho,  we got our shrimp cocktails, mine was good but my husband's only had 4 shrimps!! Then we asked twice for a side of mayo, the majority of \"REAL\" Mariscos place give you a bottle of mayo, this place doesn't.  They give you this very small thing of mayo so we asked for another one which took forever. Server  (Alyssa) hardly came around to see if we needed anything,  we had to stop her for little things like napkins because who wants to use their shirts to wipe their mouths! Then we get the bill....tell me why she charged us for the mayo?? I should of ran to Jack in the Box that's close by and ask for some for free! This place is not authentic and won't go there again.  Very disappointing....I rather drive little further for real Mariscos, with nice service and don't charge for mayo! Lol"}
{"text":"This is definitely a place everyone must try! Their Friday fish is awesome and they keep it coming.  We've tried several other dishes including a deep fried sushi roll (wish I knew the name) they were all amazing.  The beer is ice cold and the service is on point! We frequent this beautifully decorated restaurant with family and/or friends and are never disappointed.  It's actually a great date night spot as well with romantic ambiance throughout."}
{"text":"Had some tacos. Shrimp, fish, and carnitas. The Carnitas Taco barely had any meat on it and nothing else aside from that. It was actually the best tasting one. The shrimp taco was packed full of shrimp but wasn't very flavorful. The fish taco was that times 3. A ton of fish. No flavor. It's too bad, I really was hoping for some delicious shrimp tacos. the Saving Grace was the waitress. She was very attentive and very nice."}
{"text":"Visited this place for a family event. There were about 18 of us. Staff was accommodating, as I'd expect because we had a reservation. The environment is inviting and very \"locally owned\" feeling. The food was very hit and miss, but quite pricey. My grown children each had a fish plate at about $18-$20 a piece. Those were huge portions and they enjoyed them. My husband had a $15 carne asada burro that looked like a flauta because it was so small but he liked the flavor. I had chicken fajitas; they were ok. We ordered an appetizer of aguachiles ($18) and it was very salty. The rest of our party also experienced good and mediocre dishes. For the price I would expect more. The staff was average. They were friendly but seemed a little preoccupied or put out at times. Overall it was an ok experience. For this price range I'd go somewhere more consistently good."}
{"text":"This place has an interesting menu. I think we came at a time that was right before dinner service so or server wasn't all that attentive. I ordered a fish taco which was amazing and I also tried the beef enchiladas. They were just okay. I'd definitely come back but service could be better."}
{"text":"Stoped by Friday night with family. Did not have to wait at all .They have excellent Diablo margaritas. I also had a shrimp ceviche tostada really good."}
{"text":"frigging amazing!  spent 150 bucks for 2 people....for the simple reason I wanted to try more and more!!!!  fresh, nice atmosphere oh and I mention the food was amazing????  they had this lava rock thing that was cooking beans, brother cheese and steak, served with tortillas......omg.......more please!  Finally a good place in avondale has arrived!!!!"}
{"text":"I live down the street from this new restaurant and always wanted to stop by and try it.  I stopped by on a Monday just to find out they close on Mondays bummer.  I finally had the chance to try it out. I was not sure what to expect since I had heard they served a variety of dishes. We walked in to an empty front reception area, but were then greeted by a smiling gentleman. We were seated quickly with no wait time.  The decor was hispanic inspired, la loteria and yet I could smell chinese food! Once seated I could smell seafood too, I was very confused yet intrigued! Our waitress was great very friendly and knowledgeable about the dishes, we had so many questions.  She brought us chips and salsa that were all gone within minutes. I ordered a margarita i had seen on Yelp and my waitress seemed very confused since I ordered it as Pinta margarita and its actually a diablo margarita! My eye went straight to the chile rellenos and that's exactly what I ordered. My spouse ordered a michelada with modelo negro and a molcajete dish that came in an actual sizzling molcajete.  I was sadly notified that the chile rellenos were no longer available so i settled for the red chicken enchiladas. Both our dishes and drinks were very good.  I will definitely be back to try those chile rellenos! My honest opinion they should just focus on one food specialty, Mexican dishes."}
{"text":"Yelped this spot, noticed the good reviews so we decided to give it a shot... I was highly disappointed. $68 down the drain. Food came out cold, sushi came out last. Still sitting there without silverware and condiments.  Service was slow. Overall the margarita was the only thing I was pleased with... new business, so maybe with time they can get it together. I won't be returning nor sending new customers to try it out. ?"}
{"text":"The service was great she explained all the different items. Even though it was a Saturday they didnt have soup. I thought it was odd they didn't offer combo meals for their tacos.  The salad was okay it tasted more like pepper spiced tomato paste my friends got a side of the hot to mix in but they didn't like the flavor of the hot. The food was decent you can tell they focus on their seafood and that dish tasted the best."}
{"text":"First thought was: Wow this place is fancy! Very simple with classy lighting and Loteria picture frames. Televisions for you to see football or baseball games.

Don't come in with idea of having a burrito or rice and bean meal. This place is Mexican seafood! They also have pasta plates and burgers. 

Our waitress Stephania was very nice and very attentive. We meet the manager Miguel, he was cool too! Apparently some of the chefs are from Scottsdale restaurants which explains the food! One chef is from Hermosillo, Sonora.

We received complimentary garlic bread which was crunchy and soft and the butter was perfect. We had the fish and chips which I am do glad they were not oily like you think of normal places. Also we had the molcajete with both chicken and steak and both corn and flour tortillas. It was boiling hot like it should be and that was good. Would I have wanted more meat and beans, yes but it was tasty. The green chile gave it just the right flavor and spice to it. 

I am coming back to try their steak sushi, their half pound buyers, and fish tacos!"}
{"text":"Let me start by advising that if you go you must have a Diablo Margarita! It is so good! This is our third time here and my husband is in love with their 7 mares soup! I tried the green shrimp aguachiles today and I was amazed at how fresh and tasty it was! We will for sure keep coming back to this place! Also they have really good tripas tacos! Super crunchy and tasty!"}
{"text":"Food was okay! It didn't have much flavor. The service was great and fast. Good came put really fast. The table salsa was amazing!!"}
{"text":"Great service, excellent food, and cool atmosphere.  Drinks were right on too.  They were not stingy with portions."}
{"text":"Great! That recently opened so he service isn't all that great. The owners, however, like to walk around and see how people are doing. The atmosphere is calming with dimmed lighting and paintings on the wall showcasing Loteria cards such as La Dama, El Borracho, El Catrin, El Gallo, etc. Sushi bar is not open yet. I'm pretty excited for when it does. Overall, the food was very very delicious! EVERYTHING was cooked to order. All the fried stuff was really hot to eat as soon as you got it. 

Shrimp A la Diabla: Its a dish of cooked shrimp covered in a dark red sauce. It's a medium level of spicy. The shrimp are cooked to perfection! You get some lemon, oranges, greens, rice, and beans. 

Shrimp Culiche: it's a dish of cooked shrimp covered in a light yellow spicy sauce that is similar to a tomatillo sauce. The person that ate it couldn't help mentioning how much she would love to take the salsa home to pour on top of some over easy eggs for breakfast. The sides were: rice, beans, lemons, and greens (small salad). 

Coconut Breaded Fried Shrimp: Its an appetizer. They smelled so delicious! You get six of them. Served on top of lettuce and purple cabbage. 

Shrimp and Chips: It looked good and it came with a side of sauce similar to ranch, but it was not tartar sauce. There were about 8 shrimps and a good amount of chips. It all got served in a bowl on top of some lettuce and purple cabbage. 

Shrimp Tacos: They get ordered a la carte. Not too pricey because you get a good sized piece of fish fried in a beer batter. It's topped with a clear sour cream salsa, tomatoes, cilantro, lettuce, purple cabbage, onions, and a few lemons. This was my plate! It gets a 10/10 in my opinion. I got 3 of them and 2 of them got me full. I could not finish the last one but luckily my table was sharing their plates, that's how I'm able to describe the other dishes. Will definitely get these again, but after trying everything else on the menu ;) 

Ojalá habrán el bar de sushi pronto. Hopefully they open their sushi bar soon!"}
{"text":"I was super skeptical of a Mexican Seafood, Sushi, and Pasta restaurant, but it was super good. I didn't try the sushi or pasta, but I had a shrimp, asada, pollo, and al pastor taco. They were super tasty and very full of meat. They also have a green and red salsa I tried on the tacos and both were great! I had all of the fixings on the side, so I could build them exactly as I wanted."}
{"text":"I had the stuffed salmon wrapped in bacon. Leftovers for days! The food was great and the service was on par as well. The night atmosphere was nice with the different lights they had...will definitely return."}
{"text":"This place is amazing and the staff plus the owners make you feel like your a part of their family! I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"I had the enchiladas,  asked if I can taste the sauce and loved them both and they were nicely to put half red and half green enchiladas sauce-  DELICIOUS MEAL. I Loved their rice !!!  
My mom had the fried shrimp, her favorite now! 

Server was very patient and helpful with us as it was our first time, definitely will go back!"}
{"text":"Every time I've gone the food & drinks have been AMAZING! I love everything about it and have been recommending it to everyone."}
{"text":"Restaurant was clean, service was okay. 
I got a ceviche tostada, it was okay. But it looked like it was thrown on a plate and done. No side of lemon or lime, no bed of lettuce. Definitely lacking on presentation. If I go back it will be to try a specialty drink, if that. But won't be returning for the food."}
{"text":"This place caught my attention since it first said it was opening. Close to home and a family business. Came in the first week and had little variety of what to choose from. Mainly 2 meals for breakfast, lunch and dinners. Fast forward 4 months since the grand opening, it looks like this place has got the enough support from customers. They have a variety of plates looking super fancy and delicious. Anything from pastas, Mexican food, sushi, sea food, you name it. I love the filete primavera with pasta alfredo. It is so well put together it makes it worth your money. While you're eating you also can't help to look around the art hung up on the wall and beautiful lamp lighting in the ceiling. Bar is also now open, something that in the grand opening wasn't even completed. Casa de plata has come a long way and I will continue returning to try new food."}
{"text":"Horrible service!!! Unless your hispanic, prepare to wait for a lonnngggg time for things like silverware, straws, napkins for the drinks, food.  Don't bother getting the appetizer, as an appetizer, it comes at the same time as the main dish.

Its safe to say, were not comming back here."}
{"text":"Delicious food, great drinks and specials and service!! Everything is plated beautifully and very pretty place as well. Salsa and chips are great.. I love the fish tacos... the fried fish + pasta Alfredo.. stuffed bacon wrapped peppers.. and of course micheladas :) waitresses are nice and owner is always present the 5x we have gone and always asks for feedback"}
{"text":"My family and I was very excited this this restaurant opened in our neighborhood. A little high expectations especially marketing seafood and sushi. From what we tried, the pasta dishes was what stood out. Onion rings batter was too light, soaked in oil, wings was good, same as what you get from a pizza joint at half the price. Pasta dish was good however needed to ask for sauce. Alfredo was just butter, not creamy. Steak ordered was over cooked, asked for rare. If you're looking to have decent pasta, try it here. Looking forward to giving this place another try."}
{"text":"The food has great presentation... that's always a plus. The tacos were very delicious, the pasta was okay not out of this world. We also ordered some oyster and those came with a bomb salsa. I will definitely be back. Not the mention it's a 2 min drive that always helps."}
{"text":"I have been given this place more than one opportunity...and the results are always disappointment. The only good thing about this place is there Beer! (micheladas) I order a shot of Wild Turkey 101 the bartender didn't even measure the shot on served me the shot in a double shooter, the amount of whiskey was definitely not equivalent to a shot. I question the bartender if that was a regular shot an his reply \"that's the way they have us server them\" I told him I didn't want the shot, and he took it back. Yet for him to serve a lil more to it an bring it back, I refuse to take and pay for the shot and all we got was dirty looks from what seem to maybe be a supervisor as well as the bartender, I would not pay for something that is not worth it. Never again will we come back...."}
{"text":"Food was absolutely amazing, staff was very friendly. Wings were better then most pizza joints. Stuffed peppers are a must try! Fajitas are the best in town."}
{"text":"We just came because someone recommend us this place, and the first think we get when we enter is that they closed in 5 minutes even tho is 40 minutes  before 9 because they closed at 9:00 pm not at 8:20 they waitress was very rude her i feel bad for the owner of this place !!! He needs to check on his employers"}
{"text":"Friendly, good prices. Fish tacos are awesome. Oyster shooters are great. Shrimp tacos are supreme."}
{"text":"Never been here, decided to try it. Its nice inside, friendly staff. The chips seem homemade, the salsa is ok. I ordered the spicy tuna roll and the steak and shrimp roll. I never had a spicy tuna with so much green onion that it actually was overpowering. The steak and shrimp roll, was just ok... I don't typically go for that kind of roll but wanted to try it. 
My husband ordered the menudo and no joke we literally filled a plate of bones and left his bowl pretty much empty. We alerted the waitress and she came and got him another bowl. Now let me say that my husband is a menudo eater and loves his menudo, he literally could not eat this one. She did take it and gave him something else which he got the Carne asada burrito which he said was not good. My son had a bean burrito with fries and he liked it.. But he's a kid and likes every bean burrito he comes across. I will say although we weren't so impressed with the food the waitress was really nice. Doubt we will be back."}
