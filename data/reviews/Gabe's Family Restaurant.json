{"text":"I went there for the first time several weeks ago and had the best  blueberry pancakes ever!!  They were very crowded but still the service was fast and the waitress friendly.  I will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I live on the east side and found ourselves in the Old Brooklyn area when we got hungry. We stopped at Gabe's on Broadview and had breakfast. It was absolutely wonderful. Food was delicious and the service was great. Good value for your buck as well. we will be returning again soon. Thanks Gabe!!!    :)"}
{"text":"Gabe's was recommended to my wife and I a few months ago.  We try to get there a couple times a month.  It is just a great breakfast diner.  I have tried a number of items off the menu as well as their specials and they have all been great.  You can't go wrong with 2+2+2 options - a lot of great food at a very reasonable price.  However, in addition to the food the waitresses and staff there are fantastic."}
{"text":"Great, old diner.  Party of 4 and sat quickly.  Came in around 11 so half of us had breakfast and the other half lunch. Super fast service, waitress very friendly. Inexpensive and good size portions.  The guy at the front was not over friendly but in no way rude.  Would go again."}
{"text":"Guy at the register: Rude and grumpy
Food: Not so fresh and yucky
If I ever decide to eat crappy diner food again, it won't be from here!"}
{"text":"I'm not too sure why everyone raves about this place. I was really excited to try it out and came in on Saturday morning. The man at the register was a peach. And yes I'm being sarcastic. No smile no warm greeting. The waitress wasn't friendly either. I ordered over medium eggs and got a plate full of raw eggs which was awesome.. I won't be back. Take the extra few minutes to drive to Georges kitchen for the same food and prices but friendlier service!

The one perk? The french toast was actually really good."}
{"text":"We were actually trying to go to another diner close by, but couldn't find parking.  Gabe's had a parking lot, so we decided on breakfast here.  Although it looks run down inside, the waitresses were friendly, it was easy to get refills of coffee and water.  There were a ton of breakfast specials to choose from.  Our group had pancakes, an omelet, and country veal.  We all enjoyed our meals and were pleasantly surprised when we received the bill, it was very inexpensive!  We will be back on our next trip to Cleveland!"}
{"text":"I always have fast and wonderful service. I normally go first thing in the morning. The two waitresses are always friendly. You'll never have an empty cup of coffee."}
{"text":"First time eating here was pretty good. Had the open face roast beef. Waitress was great."}
{"text":"Had my go to 3 eggs over medium breakfast, and also teleported back to 1980. Good overall diner experience."}
{"text":"Gabes is pretty much the same as all the other breakfast joints in the area. It's one of those places where the food isn't great but it isn't bad either. I would go back cause its cheap. Two meals, coffee and \"pepsi\" (noway its really pepsi) for 9.50. I probably should rate is slightly higher cause the service was great but the food was just food, nothing to write home about. If they would just step they're quality of ingredients up a notch they would be busier then they already are."}
{"text":"I LOVE Gabe's!!  This is the perfect family joint for regular Old Brooklyn folks.  We go there almost every Sunday.  The guy in the front who seats you isn't that friendly, but he's a staple to the restaurant!  The waitresses are super nice and always try to get to know regulars.  They also give kids tours of the kitchen when it's slow.  The brunch food is delicious and so much better than trendy, expensive places in Cleveland.  Gabe's is awesome!!  Great prices, too!

PS- someone said they don't like to serve people of color in here.  That's ridiculous.  I see people of color in there all the time and no one is ever rude to them.  I've also brought POC to eat here and we never had an issue."}
{"text":"First time in Gabe's, really good food, good portions, outstanding service!  Billy is an awesome waitress...highly recommend Gabe's."}
{"text":"Only open for breakfast and lunch...but they can do that because the place is packed during breakfast and lunch and the food is delicious!  They have an extensive menu but we mostly order breakfast. The skillet breakfasts and waffles are VERY good as are the sausage gravy and biscuits!  The staff work really well as a team and are efficient and friendly.  The restaurant is always clean and most of the time you get a table and don't have to wait too long!"}
{"text":"After moving to Old Brooklyn, we tried several local diners to determine the best spot for Sunday brunch. The verdict? Gabe's, hands down!

Great location, fast and friendly service, and yummy diner food at good prices. What more could you ask for?

They also do lunch, but I've stuck to their breakfast menu this far. I particularly enjoy their steak and eggs, better quality than I'd expected for the price! And they rotate specials all the time.

Be sure to check them out if you're hungry in the area!"}
{"text":"Greeting was so rude, waitress was ok, got our order correct. Food was way undercooked. Just pushed it aside and are the toast. Waitress should have asked why nothing was eaten but......didn't feel like dealing with it just then. Coffee was good. The guy at the cash register was just an azz hole, I didn't bring anything up, was just going to pay and go, but then this guy starts wtf?? Food very very average but the staff other than my waitress was horrible.  Sometimes I just want to sit and eat and not have confrontations. Probably won't go back unless there are some changes in the staff"}
{"text":"Gabe's is a decent eatery and I found the food quite good.  The service is good as well and the wait staff are knowledgeable about the menu, making your selection an easy one.  However, you might ask why only 3 stars?  It happens to be the owner that was the problem.  After having a delightful breakfast, I left a healthy tip for the waitress and proceeded to the check out to pay my tab.  Well, it turns out the owner was taking the money. I introduced myself, told him I was new to the area and I really enjoyed my meal.  The man looked at me and said nothing except, \"Are you going to leave a tip?\".  I thought to myself, that was odd.  I just complemented the guys restaurant and he has nothing to say except, \"Are you going to leave a tip?\"

Sadly, I have never gone back, nor can I recommend this restaurant.  It is unfortunate that success for some people inflates the ego to a degree that they forget from which they've come.  Where appreciation and humility are lost and rudeness prevails.

{"text":"Love it.   The service is top notch.   The prices are from the late 1970s.  Fresh food cooked quickly    DEFINATELY the place to eat breakfast."}
{"text":"I've lived in the neighborhood pretty much all my life and can't remember ever giving Gabe's a try, so when we needed a breakfast spot this morning we gave them a gamble and they didn't disappoint at all! 

As far as breakfast diners go, they have a great little menu that of course includes the classics, but also a couple of nice little creative spins like pumpkin bread French toast. We ordered a small smorgasbord of food and for $30 got a TON of food. The country burritos were excellent, and I highly recommend the Irish Potatocakes -- easily the highlight of the meal for me. 

Overall this place is definitely a step above the other typical neighborhood breakfast diners, I think. It is always PACKED on the weekends, and now I totally understand why."}
{"text":"Gabe's is the winner of the month long, best local diner challenge!! YAY!!!!!!!! Sorry Steve and Gus, but Gabe is the man I want to wake up too.

The waffle was cooked to perfection, with a slightly crunchy outside but fluffy inside. The potato pancakes were large and in charge, with a great herb-y hint (Thyme? Parsley? I have no idea). They auto-came with jelly and sour cream too, which the others did not. The sauce for the eggs benedict was rich and butter-y flavorful - unlike the other places where it was more comparable to goo.

I'm so happy to have you in my life, Gabe. You make coming back for seconds a treat. I'm so lucky to have found my Brooklyn local diner spot."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for the first time today, and thought it was great. We stumbled upon Gabe's while searching for another restaurant, and we were pleasantly surprised by how affordable and delicious the food was. I got the hotcakes, and couldn't even finish my plate. My husband ate every bit of his Greek omlette. The side potatoes were a little bland, but not really an issue. We will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"oh, greasy spoons ! 
Housed in a former Red Barn [the restaurant], Gabe's is another greasy spoon of Old Brooklyn. 

(caveat: I've only been here for breakfast)
My grandpa prefers Gabe's to Steve's because they have eggbeaters. They also have plus they had fresh fruit (although how fresh it really was - it's December). It's cheap, though not as cheap as Steve's... $12 for a breakfast for 2. 

The service was excellent. The waitresses poured us coffee [the coffee is bitter and generic but I'm not expecting anything more - it's only a buck or 2 for it] at least 5-6 times during our meal, my mug was always at least half full.  Also, the place was bustling [as it usually is on a Sunday] and we still got food within 10 minutes of our order (for eggs and sides). 

Gabe's: another fine greasy spoon in Old Brooklyn."}
{"text":"This place is amazing, the food is great and the staff is so wonderful. My son has ADHD and they are always trying to entertain him and don't show the slightest frustration.

So family feeling while your there. Prices are good for the food you get. 

Only reason they didn't get 5 stars is because they aren't open for dinner!"}
{"text":"When I first came to Gabe's, I did not get the best impression. The owner was grumpy, and as I came to later discover when I brought my Lebanese friend in, he only ever smiles to other middle eastern people. 

HOWEVER, the staff are extremely friendly, and the food is exceptional. I've tried everything from their French toast to their club sandwiches and I've never been disappointed. Their hot chocolate is incredible in the winter and their smoothies are delectable in the summer. Their layer cakes are also to die for and are a great way to finish off a wholesome meal. 

For such a busy place, you can get a seat fairly quickly and the seats are fairly clean. The booths are old from the wear and tear, and while they look good on the outside, when you sit down, it's a little uncomfortable.

There are very few things to complain about at Gabe's and I would highly recommend them to anyone who visits Cleveland as a spot to eat breakfast and lunch. 

Update: the owner has really improved and offers a smile when you go to pay! That makes everything about Gabe's absolutely perfect"}
{"text":"I have to say that I love Gabe's.   It is a great place!  The girls are great.  The food always comes out out quick, fresh and HOT!!  I love it!"}
{"text":"Greeted rudely by the owner from the time we walked in. Waitress was rude. There was a big fight because of a waitress and other waitresses jumped in to argue with customers! They don't not like to service people of color in here! Will not return!"}
{"text":"We go to Gabe's a few times a month. They have the best service. All the waitresses are super friendly and they get to know their regular customers. They're always sure to refill your drinks and check often if there's anything you need. The Greek omelette comes loaded with feta cheese. All the food is good. On the weekends before 1 and during the week before 11 they have a $2.99 special, 3 eggs, bacon or sausage, home fries, toast. They close at 3pm. We've gotten there at 2:30 and they treated us like we were there at 9. No rushing, still made delicious meals and didn't skimp on anything. Really a great restaurant."}
{"text":"My family loves visiting Gabe's for a piping hot breakfast! The waitresses are awesome. There's morning breakfast specials which are great. A family of 5 can get breakfast for under $25 and feel appreciated by the staff."}
{"text":"Has 4.5 score on google which I think is more accurate. I tried Steve's and Gus before Gabe's because they have higher Yelp rating but I like Gabe's the best. They have bigger portions than Gus and better tasting food than Steve's."}
