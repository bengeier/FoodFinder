{"text":"Bonne bouffe, bon service. Les escargots gratinés étaient excellents, ainsi que la viande de kangourou. Un peu cher, donc pas une place où j'irais en famille un mardi soir, mais une belle sortie en amoureux!"}
{"text":"Trois convives, 3 trois opinions similaires... Bouffe très médiocre, service moyen, ambiance agréable avec son band qui a réussi à faire lever et danser la foule, quoi qu'un peu âgée pour nous (mais le band était de type crooner) ce qui va très bien à bec cette clientèle . Bref n'y allez pas pour manger mais pour y siroter un verre tout en passant une soirée agréable à écouter de la bonne musique."}
{"text":"This restaurant is owned by a couple of Marseillais and offers French cuisine with a touch of local cuisine on some occasions. They also have pasta but I don't think it's their specialty. It was recommanded to us by the B&B owner where we were staying and it proved to be a good choice. I had the deer and it was exquisite. My husband had the beef stew, it was good but not as good as mine. We also had the snails as appetizers, they were cooked with goat cheese, it was delicious. The music didn't fit the setting, it was sometimes quite bad, but I guess it's owner's choice! Overall a good experience!"}
{"text":"Warm feeling getting into this French bistro. Nice service. Dissapointed with the wine list, not many varieties & mostly French wines. Food was all right but the presentation is great. Loved the experience because of the last hockey game Canadians vs Senators & we won. I would definitely go back especially for the atmosphere"}
