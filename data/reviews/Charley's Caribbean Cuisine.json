{"text":"This place is nice and clean. I always drove by this area but didn't think any of the restaurants were decent, maybe just the Swiss Chalet and Quizos. 

I decided to check out this local restaurant, this place seem like it's been here forever. This place is clean and organize for a ma and pa restaurant. I ordered the main special, jerk chicken on rice and peas. The jerk chicken was okay, there was lots and lots of rice and no peas. I dropped most of the rice as having just 2 items wasn't enough of a variety for me. Would preferred to have paid more and get more items."}
{"text":"Decided to pop in here after seeing they made Guyanese food that leaned toward the West Indian side of things. Ordered the bone in chicken curry and asked for a large portion of vegetables. Moving on to the cash the total came to $20, which I found very surprising, but because I was in a rush and I am too polite to complain, I paid it and got my food for takeaway. 

Returning to work, I was dumbfounded as to how small the portions were, but putting on my optimist hat convinced myself that the quality would make up for it. Boy was I wrong. First of all, the food was COLD. When I say cold, I do not mean lukewarm or less than hot, I mean actually unappetisingly cold. But it does not stop there, the curry chicken was tasteless and the gravy really greasy. To add insult to injury, there was more bone than chicken.

All in all, one of the worst Caribbean dining experiences I can report on having. At least their hot sauce was good."}
{"text":"You'd be wise to save your money and skip this place. I ordered off skipthedishes, so I can't comment on the surroundings but I can talk about the food.

Fried rice was terrible, dry, had little to no flavour. Wings were insipid and equally flavorless. I ordered a $10 serving of sweet and sour chicken and the portion was small. It came in on of those styrofoam tubs, the kind they put soup in. You can literally get 3 times that amount from any Chinese restaurant for the same price. 

Guyanese patties and phlourie were equally disappointing and bland.

The only reason I give this 2 stars was that I also got the jerk chicken with rice and peas and it was the only thing other than plantain in my whole order that had any flavour and it wasn't bad."}
