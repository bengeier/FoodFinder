{"text":"Great breakfast place, it's busy but the owner always makes sure to grab your name if there's a lineup  Menu is great, I always take the Incredible, yum!!"}
{"text":"Decor 3/5 service 5/5 food 3/5  Good prices, big portions, good location, good service. Love this place, their potatoes are just addictive. The prices are very similar to that of any breakfast place, but the place is roomier and I've never had to wait in line to get seated. Parking can be tricky but that's not an issue if you live in the area. I had their eggs benedict, their pancakes and waffles, and just today I had their healthy sandwich (egg white, Swiss cheese, lettuce, and tomato on whole wheat bread). Absolutely no guilt in that sandwich. I've been here 4 times now and plan on coming back."}
{"text":"So disappointed! Actually, i should mention that they serve really good food and offer many breakfast options. However there's a huge lack of professionalism from the managing staff. I ordered an European omelet. When the omelet arrived i noticed that the feta cheese was goat cheese, which wasn't specified on the menu. I kindly told the waitress that i was intolerant and she told me she would change it right away for cheddar cheese. Grateful, i thanked her. Than... The manager comes to our table and argues, in a pretty aggressive manner, that all feta cheese is goat cheese (uh..not!) and tells me that i'm wasting food and he'll have to charge me for it! (What!? Certainly not!). Must i remind you.. It wasn't specified on the menu!! Oddly enough, I had to argue my case in order to avoid paying for the plate I had not eaten. Anyways .. This guy totally ruined my experience over there as well as my appetite. Will not go back."}
{"text":"Très bon service. Les prix sont raisonnables et je n'ai jamais été déçue de mon choix! Un beau restaurant à déjeuner."}
{"text":"J'ai toujours une belle surprise quand j'y vais. Malheureusement, je peux pas y aller aussi souvent que j'aimerais. Mon coup de coeur c'était les dîners."}
{"text":"I came here for breakfast before a meeting I had at the neighbouring Alt Hotel. This is a very obviously new building and the interior of the restaurant is modern. There isn't a whole lot of ambience to it but it's a large space with lots of windows.  The food was fine. The crepes were good and the latte was good as well. I'm giving it three stars because it's a decent place to go, especially if you're staying at the hotel, and there's nothing wrong with the food. However, Montreal has a bounty of amazing restaurants so I'd suggest trying one of those out. In a pinch, this one will do just fine but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here specifically."}
{"text":"This is probably the most amazing breakfast restaurant I've been so far. The concept is nicer than other franchises. The actual owner would come and greet you with a smile. He would ask if everything is good and the food is not only good but clean. Would I recommend it! Yes !! Had the vegetarian omelette and it was FANTASTIC. I will come again :)"}
{"text":"This is delicious non-chain (but chain-like) breakfast in the burbs.  Coco Loco has all the standards: pancakes, bacon and eggs, omelettes, eggs benedict and on and on.  And then they have some pretty interesting combos you may not see elsewhere, like crepe-omelettes (a thin omelette served between two crepes).  The food is fresh.  The service is fast and pleasant.  Get there early (or wait until later) or else you risk waiting in the vestibule and entryway with lots of other people.  But once you're seated, you'll want to stay all day in the bright and more or less wall to wall windowed space, as the coffee refills just keep on coming."}
{"text":"Very nice place  I've take the incroyable plate it's a big plate I've brought some leftover, it's not expensive 14.95$ only. Really a great place the staff was great one of the server (thoses whilo serve the coffee) thought of giving me a plastic bag for leftover boxes."}
{"text":"Great food - awesome service and who doesn't love breakfast!? The menu is huge so you'll have to make some tough choices, but everything is awesome and the fresh fruit is truly delish!"}
{"text":"I finally went there for the first time on a Sunday morning. There was a lineup but it didn't take long at all.   The service was fast and efficient. The restaurant was too loud because it was crowded. I don't like noisy places but the food made up for it.  I had the Meat Lover Egg Benedict. It was incredible. The hollandaise sauce was so good! The potatoes were too soggy and not fresh though. I enjoyed my meal overall.  I definitely recommend this place!  Edit: I came another day at 7AM, and the experience was much more enjoyable! Worth 5 stars. The restaurant was obviously quiet, and the waitress I had this time was wonderful. The fries were fresh and crispy. Thus, try to go as early as you can if you like to eat peacefully!"}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant after seeing a 10% off coupon on 'My Piece' and did not regret that decision.  Coco Loco is a brunch spot tucked away on the second floor of small strip in Griffintown. Once I made sense of the location, I was greeted by friendly staff and seated at a table near the window where I can watch the trains go by.  I browsed the menu from home and decided on the spinach and cheese crepe omelette. What I didn't expect was the chefs special menu that gave diners the option of an appetizer, entree and dessert with coffee/tea all for about $11 if I remember correctly. And my crepe happened to be on the list!  After a delicious soup, came my giant entree with perfectly crisped potatoes on the side. The crepe was delicious. While it was a savoury crepe, I like tasting just a hint of sweetness from the batter and it provided just that.   Already, full I delved into my coconut cake for just a couple bites that my stomach could handle. The experience was so great and affordable that I even forgot about the coupon - though they did honour it without problem on my return visit.   Looking to return shortly to introduce the BF to this brunch spot :)"}
{"text":"I am not a breakfast person at all.  I was dragged here by s girlfriend and I loved it!  The prices are very competitive and the service is on point.  As I said I am not s breakfast person and cab only eat a little in the morning so I get an egg, potato's, son fruit, toast and coffee for 6.55!  Its located in alt hotel on the second floor so keep that in mind but otherwise get over here and try them out!"}
{"text":"I had breakfast here this morning and the French toast was awesome!!! The service was excellent and my food was pretty good.  It was so much food for less than $10 U.S.  My friend ordered the waffle, creton, baked beans, and Bacon.  She enjoyed all of the different flavors on her plate.  Coffee and hot tea come with each meal."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast place. Probably my favorite. I know l'avenur and others in the plateau district get all the attention but this place is really a notch above. Favoritve breakfast potatoes ever! And their serive is top notch."}
{"text":"Great breakfast place.  Easy access with lots of parking.  The food is good and reasonably priced.  They have benches for large groups.  But the syrup has a weird taste.  The waitress did small mistakes. I asked for a certain item to be removed, but wasn't. I asked water without ice, I received a glass with half of it's content being ice.  If you are in the area. It's a good option."}
{"text":"Went with a couple of friends for the first time and very much enjoyed this place. The service, menu & pricing were delish. Will definitely have to go there again."}
{"text":"Great Breakfast"}
{"text":"Saw the manager argue for 15 minutes with a client this morning, trying to charge her for a plate she couldn't eat because of alegries... created a big commotion and ruined the experience for the whole restaurant.  The food is OK but if anything goes wrong, except the boss to act like a total retard.  The management should take marketing 101."}
{"text":"Breakfast was decent, nothing too mind blowing but definitely satisfies the brunch craving.   Overall decor was nice and staff are friendly. Food was okay and I would recommend if you don't have other places to go. I've also had probably the best breakfast food and now I'm a breakfast snob so nothing compares to my favorite brunch place."}
{"text":"Your regular breakfast place. Don't expect anything out of the ordinary. We got an old avocado served to us..."}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast place, they have an original menu with things you wont find anywhere else!"}
{"text":"A modern looking diner that serves a delicious breakfast.  The bacon and cheddar omelet was light and fluffy with the perfect amount of bacon and cheese,  It was served along with really tasty crispy potatoes and some fruit.  Crepes filled with eggs and sausage was a huge portion also served with the potatoes and fruit.  The coffee was good and our waitress was great.  A wonderful spot for a hearty breakfast in Griffintown."}
{"text":"I stayed at hotel Alt which is located right next to this place so despite the reviews I went. I ordered the Italian eggs Benedict and my boyfriend got the Cinnamon Apple waffles. I have to say I really enjoyed my eggs Benedict. I thought the Italian twist was really great, it was mozzarella cheese, Italian sausage and peppers with of course hollandaise sauce! The potatoes were seasoned perfectly. The waffles tasted delicious, my only complaint would be to season the waffles as well and not just have the topping be cinnamon apples. I got a peach mixed with orange mimosa which I really enjoyed! Our waitress was a delight and when we asked for recommendations for our stay she called over another waiter which was more familiar with the area and they gave us a whole list and app to download ! Really great service and food. You have to realize with coming here it's a traditional American breakfast so if you have limited time in Montreal this may not be what you want to get! We went out of the connivence and don't regret it a second!  Cute brunch place (:"}
{"text":"A nice casual brunch place connected to the ALT Hotel in Montreal. It was a bit busy when we arrived at the peak of Sunday brunch time. It doesn't help when we have a team of hungry dragon boaters invading the restaurant. Surprisingly, we didn't wait too long as it's hard to seat 25 people together.  Instead of the usual breakfast foods, I decided to give an omelet a try. I ordered the Meat lover omelet with bacon, ham, sausages and cheddar cheese. Our order took a little bit longer to come because it was super busy. I was enjoying my hot coffee on a chilly rainy day while we waited for our food. I loved the meat omelet as it was cooked perfectly and flavorful. It also came with homemade potatoes. Overall, it was a decent brunch experience!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is in a beautiful space on 2fl of Alt hotel building. The breakfast was beautiful, everything was fresh, incredible selection crepes, traditional egg/meat breakfast, omelettes, etc. The service was pleasant. This is not a budget breakfast by any means but totally worth it!"}
{"text":"Had breakfast here while staying at the Hotel Alt (super convenient for guests!) and it's bright, open space to start your day. From crepes to waffles, omelettes, and smoothies, the menu offers pretty much anything you could want in the morning and the portions are generous!   My only complaint would be that, during our first visit, it took a while to get service. We were seated quickly, but the restaurant was busy and we were passed by a few times by servers would didn't speak English. Totally understandable in a bilingual city like Montreal, but definitely something to note if you're under a time crunch!"}
{"text":"Great! Proper brunch place with lots of options and freshly squeezed orange juice. I liked the vegetarian omelette I got, the homemade potatoes were good too. Big serving in my opinion."}
{"text":"It's a classic breakfast place, with a huge menu including smoothies, waffles, pancakes, omelettes... I ordered 2 sunny side up eggs, with sausages and coffee. What I like about this restaurant is it's location, excellent service, and friendly staff; it's one of the few joints where the manager comes by and ensures that everything is perfect!"}
{"text":"I had a great time at Coco Loco.  Went on a weekend morning when it was still a little too chilly for the patio and the line was out the door.  Wasn't sure if I had to go in to give them my name but we did as others did and waited in line.  As a gentleman came by to take names I realized all the other customers were French speaking, no problem at all however as when it was our turn to be seated they remembered to speak English to us.  A small detail, but with how busy they were the service was impressive.  They even offered us a free sample of one of their smoothies while we wait.  Their menu is extensive and their food is delicious.  Since I wanted to try it all I chose a combo with French toast, a pancake, and half waffle.  I liked the French toast the best but they were all yummy.  I also tried some of the eggs benedict and I must say their hollandaise is made well, not too buttery.  Overall a great choice for breakfast or brunch.  Don't be put off by the line, people are lined up for a reason."}
{"text":"Mon restaurant de déjeuner favori à Laval. Les smoothies sont délicieux, les patates à déjeuners sont mes favorites. J'y retourne régulièrement seule ou en groupe. Le service est impeccalble et les prix sont très abordables. J'adore."}
{"text":"Breakfast was tasty, service amazing. Great place to start the day with a good traditional breakfast. Great prices as well"}
{"text":"Good generous portion food! The waitress Paula was simply amazing! Great customer service! Will come back for sure! :)"}
{"text":"It's now become THE default restaurant for our lab lunches.. They do have more options for vegetarians. Just a small critique would be to provide seasonal fruits. My pineapple slice was super cold and barely tasted anything.. Everything else was delightfully delicious! :)  Needless to say, we'll keep on coming again and again and again :)"}
{"text":"I love the open atmosphere of this restaurant. It's on the second story and has big windows looking out. I ate breakfast there and the food, as well as the service, were amazing. They stayed on top of drink refills and provided quick and efficient service. Highly recommend them and will visit again."}
{"text":"Enjoyed breakfast at this fine diner while visiting in Laval. The blueberry pancakes were very good and the portions are big. Definitely the place to go for a hearty breakfast.  Our waitress was friendly and spoke both English and French. Overall, my experience was delightful and plan to go again when I leave town."}
{"text":"I had lunch here today.  Though the menu is mostly breakfast and brunch selections, there were some other like pasta, burger and fries, etc.    I ordered the burger and fries and they were delicious ... I'd get them again!  My server was Maxime.  He was friendly and took good care of me.  I hope I'm up early enough tomorrow to have breakfast there!"}
{"text":"Je suis allée tester ce restaurant de brunch pour la fête des meres. Je suis une grande fan des brunchs et je dois avouée avoir été très déçue tant par le service que par la nourriture et meme l'endroit. Déjà tout est de béton donc on entend les voix en échos impossible d'entendre mon beau frère à l'autre bout de la table. Cela a pris plus de 15 minutes pour nous proposer du café et la nourriture servie n'avait rien d'exceptionnel, mis à part les pommes de terre sautées et bien assaisonnées. Café filtre très quelconque :("}
{"text":"This was my first visit to this increasingly popular joint while I was visiting St-Rose.  There were line-ups, which is ALWAYS a thing for a breakfast place in Laval during the weekend at 12 PM. This was a welcomed change from my favorite resto place such as Allo Mon Coco. Its greatest failings were always the wait to get in and terrible seating arrangements (using a 4 bunker to sit 2 guests while 20 guests are waiting).  But how did Coco Loco stand to its competition?  Surprising well!  Service was relatively quick, our waitress was very friendly and efficient. Coffee and water  was topped off twice without request and our meals were provided in a timely fashion.  Thus... I'm a fan!  The decor is modern and there's plenty of space between you and other guests.   Sadly, we were placed near the side door that the staff kept using for their guests on the exterior patio. Needless to state their repeated in and outs bothered us with sudden gusts of humidity and warmth while we were sitting comfortably in a well conditioned restoraunt.  I ordered the Dulcura, crepes filled with dulce de leche and served with strawberries and bananas. They were very tasty, albeit quite sweet. The portion was very big and I left satisfied with my choice.  The price tag was reasonable.  The menu is huge and lots of choices can be had to have an awesome breakfast. I recommend visiting this place at least once, its well worth it."}
{"text":"Poor waitress having to work with such mismanagement.  Been here a few times in the past two years and nothing has changed. Waitress is trying to do everything but it's just too much.  Great effort. Food is bland. They gave a short espresso in a cappuccino cup and it took 15 minutes both times.  It's a horror show. Waitress earned then the extra star but a serious disappointment. ..again"}
{"text":"I have been working in laval about 1 week a month for he last 7 months and many colleges keep telling me to eat here but I never had, until today.    I'm so excited about this place that I'm sipping on my third cup of java while typing this out after eating a wonderful meal.    The restaurant itself has a modern, clean feel to it and it basically a big open area spilt into left and right halves.  It isn't romantic, cozy or quiet and that's the only downside here.    The place was packed and there were 4 or 5 groups ahead of me.  No worries though as I was still seated in about 6 minutes.  The breakfast menu is extensive and surprisingly varied and unique.  Bacon pancakes caught my eye as did the 15 kinds of waffles and pancakes.  Omelets, crepes, French toast and more.    I went with the wake up meal which is scrambled eggs, potatoes, toast, 2 pancakes and I added bacon.  With coffee it was only $14 CAD.  What a deal.  I couldn't finish but 2/3 of it and that's rare for me.   Did I mention it was served in like 3 minutes after ordering??  Wow.   The service was super pleasant and fast.  I can't find anything to complain about.  This place lives up to what Yelp says it is in every way.    Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I visited Coco Loco while visiting family.  I have nothing but positive remarks for this restaurant.  We were a large group and surprisingly, the service time was quick.  I ordered waffles with egg whites on the side.  This by far has been the best waffles I've had any where else, Fluffy and tasty.  I was able to taste my cousins dishes and everything was delicious.   I also enjoyed the decor of the place.  It's a shame I live so far away far, this has the potential to be one of my regularly breakfast places."}
{"text":"Still the best breakfast in town. The service is top notch, the pankakes and french toast best in town. Bravo for keeping up this high standard."}
{"text":"iHop, waffle house? Are you paying attention. Montreal peeps make fantastic breakfast (and brunch)  While I was on vacation in Montreal some friends brought me here for a nice early breakfast. Loved the decor of the place. Its bright, its cheery. I'm not a morning person so walking into a stylish bright ass restaurant woke me right up. We got there right before the line started forming out the door so get there early. They have a fantastic menu with pretty much any breakfast item you ever wanted. It is a bit pricier then the 2 places I mentioned above. For $11.95 I got a platter which consisted of waffles, eggs, sausage, bacon,ham, toast, creton, baked beans and fresh fruit. Breakfast of champions?.... more like breakfast of fall the hell back asleep. Of course the food was excellent. The maple syrup in canada is great and I brought a can or two back with me.   So if your in the Laval, QC area and you want great breakfast this is where you need to be."}
{"text":"Just a common brunch restaurant. Not so special but not that bad as well. I had yogurt fruits and it was yummy."}
