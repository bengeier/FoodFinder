{"text":"Went here last Friday and split the four-person meat platter and two sides with three of my guy friends who have pretty big appetites - yet we still had leftovers! Compared to Carbon Bar and Smoque n Bones, Barque might just take the cake. The meat was amazing and came out super quick. Another plus, it wasn't packed on a Friday. Would definitely recommend this place if you need your BBQ fix and it's way better service wise than Smoque and Bones. Go for the meat and stay for the atmosphere!"}
{"text":"At first glance, this place is confusing

Is this a bar from the guys who created the restaurant that anchored the modern Roncesvalles community like Drake cafe? Is this an artisinal premarinated butcher shop, competing with Custodios and Rowe farms? Nope

In fact, Barque Butcher Bar is  an innovative BBQ community,  a one stop shop for improving your grilling game while drinking--at least that is the intent. It seems accessible to almost any level BBQ skill, though I am the kind of reviewer who finds pure joy in the charcoal and wood room at Ontario Gas Barbecue.

Here's how it works, at least for me:
1. Get a drink and talk BBQ. Make a plan. Choose a meat and a timeframe.
In my case, I sipped on a tasty Korean sake and chose a brined chicken to indirect grill with fingerling potatoes the same evening.
(Much of meat is brined, not pre-marinated, though I had no idea about that with the lack of signage)

2. Decide on a premade rub...or better yet grab another drink, and with guidance from the Dave or one of the other staff, make your own rub

Rub creation happens at the bar and spice rack across from the butcher area. (Again there has been a real signage problem here..I spoke with several people who have been to BBB and no one had noticed the rub making area)

For me, this was the completely awesome part. I have been making recipe-guided rubs  for a long time, but Dave explained his concept of how to structure a rub starting with a salt-sugar base. Instead of my usual time consuming process of looking through a Raichlen book and hunting down spices in oversize containers, you can just get it done. All of the spices are available in small containers for $1, and there are many that most of us do not have in the kitchen. A good example, is Aleppo which I am now addicted to on popcorn.

All in, I left BBB with dinner for 3 and my drink for under $30.

It's true that the signage is confusing or nonexistent--I would bet that vast majority of customers don't know that you can make your own rub. BBB is innovation in progress, but  like Ontario Gas BBQ,a place that can Toronto on the global grilling map.

--
But of course the in-store experience is just the first part. According to my partner, who is not easy to please in this department, the chicken roasted on top of the potatoes in our Big Green Egg was better that Barque's chicken: I'm sure the innovators behind BBB would be delighted to hear that."}
{"text":"Wanna eat delicious BBQ without having to wait for a table nor shout at your friend's face while you're eating?  Walk four stores down from Barque Smokehouse, to their sibling store, Barque Butcher Bar.

I've made four visits in the past two months and I've been 100% satisfied with each visit.

Mind you that I've only ever had their smoked wings and smoked ribs, but in all honesty, that really should be the primary reason for going.  It's EXTREMELY RARE to find a place that will do smoked wings and ribs.  Because, well, it's expensive and time-consuming.  So if you can find a place (*cough* Butcher *cough* Bar) that serves smoked wings and ribs, it's worth the trip because the flavour of smoked meat trumps all other respective meats.

After that, it comes down to what sauce flavours to order.  I've tried nearly all of their sauces and dry rubs, and my top 3 are the following:
1. 'Bama (classic bbq sauce, but it works SO well with the smoked flavour of the meat)
2. Bulgogi (a spicy Korean rendition, with sesame seeds and green onion)
3. Sweet Chili (just the right amount of chili, without making it inedible)

Surprisingly, I wasn't too crazy about their dry-rubs.  Most of them had a bit of a citrus flavour that I didn't find went well with the smoked meat.  And I found that all of the dry-rubs were too salty in general.

I would HIGHLY recommend taking advantage of their all-you-can-eat smoked wings on Thursday nights, and all-you-can-eat smoked ribs on Sunday nights.  This way you can sample all the sauce and dry-rub flavours to figure out which ones work best for you.  And you simply can't beat $19 all-you-can-eat smoked wings/ribs (also comes with complimentary side of fresh cut fries).  I dare anyone to find a better smoked wings/ribs deal in the city!

As for beverages, I've enjoyed every drink I've had so far:
1. Smoke and Choke (bourbon with liquid smoke, which tasted like a delicious peaty scotch with a bit of sweetness from orange zest and maple syrup)
2. Barque 'n Stormy (surprisingly refreshing, with real slices of ginger root!)
3. Chupacabra (sweet, fruity, and refreshing; a delicious summer drink)

Overall, this is one of my new fave places to eat in the city, and it's now my default place to go for wings and ribs."}
{"text":"Tucked away in Roncy this bar is worth the hike. 
Butcher bar has a huge selection of Hooch and whiskeys.
The bartender was very knowledgeable and was happy to explain the process of how many liquors are made.
Cocktails list is definitely interesting and different. I really liked their Sake sour.

The food here was a la par with their sister restaurant Barque. The Chorizo ribs were amazing and so was the Venison tartare.

Cool spot for a couple of Sunday drinks."}
{"text":"This is hands down the best BBQ food I have ever had. The wings with the 299 rub are to die for - people in our group who don't even like wings loved these. 

We were a party of 10 and the service was still outstanding. Matt, who looked after us, never left our glasses go empty and was attentive to every need we had (we had another server too and he was also fantastic!). Not only this but they were extremely accommodating to my dietary requirements (gluten and dairy free). 

The brisket is melt in your mouth - it was definitely my favorite. I am dying to go back to this place and would highly recommend it for any occasion!"}
{"text":"No. No. No.

I hadn't been to Barque in years, (because I'm an East End Guy and if I want to pay an arm and a leg for BBQ I'm not traveling and I'm going to Carbon Bar). 

However, sometimes...you do stupid things. 

I was in the west end with my family so I thought we'd give Barque's sister restaurant a try because bad BBQ is still good BBQ. THAT BEING SAID, this was butt.

As with my prior experiences with Barque, the wings were fantastic. That's really the only good thing I can say about the restaurant. The wings are really, really, really good.

I've gotten ahead myself though. So let's start at the beginning, shall we? The meal was prix fix and we had two small dietary restrictions that they said could easily be accommodate for because 1. The one side with nuts, could be made without it and 2. One meat could easily be subbed out for another.

So, I think it's obvious how this all went downL

If you guessed the wings and appetizers come out and we eat them and they're delicious. YOU ARE CORRECT!!

Did you then guess, \"You wait 45 minutes for the meats (all of which were good, not great) with the staff unilaterally subbing out your extra brisket for extra chicken and not telling you because who cares about a thing like that when you're paying an exorbitant amount of money for bbq and then also not telling you which version of the beans are made with nuts until prompted to because, you know, nut allergies...just the people at BIG NUT keeping the sheeple in line\"? JACKPOT!

Since you're two for two I don't even think I need to tell you that between the time the sides were put down at the table (literally 30 minutes after the meats) and dessert came (which was bad, not good) that Happy Gilmore (Which I would rate a 4/5 on yelp!) played in its entirety (credits too!). EDIT: I almost forgot why it took so long between the meat and dessert. THEY FORGOT HALF THE FRIES!

IN CONCLUSION:

5/5. Run, don't walk, to Barque Butcher Bar. LOL, just kidding. 2/5. Absolutely do not go with a group."}
{"text":"If Barque is busy, you'll likely be suggested to wait here for your table.  If you're not particularly starving and want a drink, you should just stick around.

Barque butcher bar is also a full scale butcher shop and likely bigger inside than it's restaurant counterpart.  It's a lot less busy, the staff is super chill and they have an extensive liquor shelf that includes hooch (moonshine baby!).  Cocktails are on point.

The menu is isolated to more snack and sharing items, but they carry stuff that Barque actually doesn't serve yet like the chorizo ribs.  I suggest the cod and crispy rice if you want to mix it up.  Did I mention it's open until 2am everyday?"}
{"text":"First of all this place has no A/C is really hot inside. We came in with a group of 8 ppls and the server take good care of our drinks and food. The food was ok below average me myself ordered a combo comes with wings, ribs, pulled pork sandwich and fries. Is a big portion and could be shared. Wings is the best and the rest not what I expected. Just go for the wings should be safe. The most funny part of this bar is that you can't be loud cause we got asked to keep down our voices twice by another server. So we asked the manager over and he told us that there is a 2 years old baby sleeping upstairs and is 9PM. You gotta know that you are opening a bar dude not a silent barque place. First time in my life that we went to a bar got shhhhh at . Not recommend for party more than 2 people's. Lol good luck"}
{"text":"The ribs are awesome! The pulled pork is good too. They have the best caesar salad in the city and they have the most delicious buffalo brussel sprouts."}
{"text":"We booked Barque Butcher Bar for a private event, after having been there several times previously. We were amazed by how perfectly everything was handled by the management and staff, from planning, decorating their restaurant for us, to the food and drinks. The seats at the back of the restaurant and at the bar aren't as comfortable as those at the tables in the centre, since they're more bar style, so we sat some of our older guests in the center and there weren't any issues. 

We ordered the smoker's choice for our guests, which is a set meal that includes an assortment of their meat dishes, as well as a salad, sides, and dessert. My personal favourite was their smoked wings with the dry rub. I've never been able leave Butcher Bar without having some dry rub wings to satisfy my cravings. The ribs and brisket were also exceptional and are some of the best in the city. 

The cocktails were excellent, as usual. The crowd-pleaser amongst our guests seemed to be the caesar, which I had not tried before but now haunts my dreams. Our other favourites are the smoke and choke, their take on the old fashioned, and the sake sour. One nice thing about their drinks menu is that it's constantly evolving, so you're always able to try new cocktails. On the other hand, if you really like one drink in particular, it's best to enjoy it while you can, in case it gets rotated out. 

I would unreservedly recommend Butcher Bar, both for private event catering as well as for a lovely dinner with friends. The atmosphere is always lively without being too loud to carry a conversation and the staff are super friendly. One additional advantage is that Butcher Bar is not as packed as its sister restaurant Barque, so if you're craving some wings and can't wait, Butcher Bar may be a great alternative."}
{"text":"Holy jumping not only is the food and prices bloody amazing but the ambience/interior is beautiful and cozy. On top of it all, the staff is amazing. That Sarah girl is so knowledge, attentive, and helpful.  Highly highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I really want to be providing a gleaming referral of an amazing experience. But... I left rather disappointed after my trip here. Based on my experience versus the other reviews below, seems like it's best to stick to the ribs and chicken wings. The thing is I love sandwiches, and their pulled pork sandwich isn't even making the my official Top 15 pulled pork sandwiches in the city.

The pork itself was okay, and I liked that there was a couple of big chunks of pork in along with the stringier pulled bits, but the sauce wasn't really anything impressive and the coleslaw on top actually didn't seem complimentary to its flavours. Worst yet, they bun it was served on was super dry and over toasted. And just to round out the mediocrity of the plate, the fries also seemed over cooked and way too crispy and lacking flavour, aside from being over salted.

The beers are St Ambroise brands at a 14oz pour for $7. I understand switching from 20oz pours to 16oz (after all, a lot of brewers even provide custom glassware which is 16oz), and I understand smaller glasses when the ABV is above 8%, but serving 5% ABV beers at 14oz will always grind my gears.

I'm going to put this on my \"second chances list\" and come back again as I feel like sandwiches just aren't the right choice here. I feel like they can redeem their 2 star experience, but I'll likely be doing it on a Thursday for All You Can Eat Chicken Wings or Sundays All You Can Eat Rib nights where my dollar will be a little more stretched out to make me not care about 14oz beers."}
{"text":"One of the best smokehouses in the area 
Service is excellent. 
Loved the variety of meats on their platter  all tender and flavourful. 
Prefer the ambiance of barque sister location just up the street but not a deterrent to my returning."}
{"text":"Arm and a leg.. 
Absolutely some great bbq, ribs, chicken.
The lines (avoid peak times) are long, the rich folks in high park love it!  The amount I've paid for 2 kids and self are ridiculous."}
{"text":"Little know fact of this place. They have all you can eat ribs on Sunday. And it is the best all you can eat ribs I have had. The Hossin BBQ is the best in my option. But if you plan it right go with 4 people and you can pretty much try it all. The staff was very friendly and gave some great recommendation.  One note: stir your coke or it does not taste right."}
{"text":"Definitely skip the brisket dipper sandwich and go for the wings instead. These ain't pub wings....I hear they're sourced locally rather than imported in huge quantity from overseas (like most pub wings are) and boy, it shows. Perfectly rendered skin covers juicy, flavourful chicken...these wings are not too big, not too small...right in the sweet spot. They also have a variety of sauces and dry rubs to choose from. Personally I thought the dry-rubbed versions such as BBQ Za'atar or Cajun were amazeballs.

Tip: Thursday is all-you-can-eat wing night for $19.

Fries were also well above average.

Wash it all down with a St Ambroise cream ale and you got yourself a tasty lil' meal right there."}
{"text":"Super delicious BBQ place!
We tried the sharing platter with kale ranch salad, 4 tacos, chicken wings, ribs and fries. The portion is quite generous, enough for two girls to get full.
The pulled pork taco is definitely something I'd order again. It's slightly spicy but very delicious. 
There are sauce/dry rub options for chicken wings and ribs. The waitress suggested us to get one sauce and one dry rub to change it up. We got the Za'atar dry rub for the wings. It's a lemony thyme spice that is inspired by middle eastern cuisine. And the rib is regular BBQ sauce which is a bit on the sweet side.
I normally don't like kale, but the ranch kale salad is quite delicious too! The dressing is creamy and kale has a soft texture. 
I highly recommend this place and will go back for their all you can eat ribs Sunday! :)

*However I'm only putting four stars because there were too many flies in the restaurant..."}
{"text":"I scoped this place out on my Uber ride over to my AirBnB.  (I just realized that sounds ridiculously entitled but whatever. Fight me on it).  Took a power nap and a shower, put on a dress and came over. The food was amazing.  I got the buffalo sprouts, smoked banger and brisket.  

They had sour beers on draft and that's my favorite thing ever so I did it up.  Dessert offering was chocolate donuts but I opted for a white chocolate stout instead.  Oh man I got my ENTIRE LIFE here.  I love it. Had me checking out area real estate.  Unfortunately my moneys funny so I won't be moving here anytime soon but I'll def drop in to smash some food!"}
{"text":"On Sundays they have $19 AYCE ribs @6pm. I'm a small girl but I was able to eat around 20 bones because they were all yummy. I tried a couple saucy flavours such as Bulgogi, Bbq Hoisin, Buffalo bbq, original bbq. Dry rubs: lemon pepper & bbq za'atar. Buffalo bbq was probably my favorite, Bulgogi was second (I'm a saucy rib kind of girl). Ribs came with fries (also good). For the AYCE ribs, one flavour comes with 4 ribs. Non-ayce option: $2 per rib, great for trying out the different flavours!

The popcorn shrimp was delicious, especially with their dipping sauce. I recommend getting this. 

Atmosphere: more of a relaxed pub feel vs Barque restaurant just down the street. Good for groups of 4 but space can be limited as the space isn't too big. 

Service: The staff were incredible. They were friendly, considerate, accommodating & fast. It really makes a huge difference to our experience. 

FYI: differences between Barque butcher & barque restaurant? Barque butcher is more of a pub. It has a smaller menu but their ribs are individually cut which allows for more flavours (11 vs 3). Their ribs are also crispier. There are more differences as explained by our knowledgable server but I just can't remember! 

No reservations at this location.

Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Food was delicious. Nice atmosphere. There were 4 of us; we ordered the platter for 2 and 3-4 sides. Perfect amount for us and we were pretty hungry.

Sides (all were good IMO and would definitely recommend): Cajun popcorn shrimp, deluxe fries, Hawaiian pulled pork tacos.

We arrived at 5pm on a Saturday and got seated right away. Service was good - water always refilled and split the bill in half with no issues."}
{"text":"Had high hopes for this place.. But after visiting, don't feel it deserves the 4.5 star rating.

This place DOES NOT have air conditioning!!!!!!

Came here for a birthday party.. All of us agreed that the food was so-so and probably would never revisit - hence the 2 star rating..

Most of us shared the platter combo.. $39 for a salad, a sandwich, 4 ribs, and 4 wings and a skillet of fries.

Reading the reviews, many people rave about their ribs.. Most of us at the table felt the ribs were below standard.

First of all, they weren't tender.. Not even a bit, in fact they were about 40 minutes to an hour under cooked... The meat did not fall off the bone.. In fact you couldn't eat all the meat of the bone because it was under cooked.. (Hence the expression \"fall off the bone ribs\" did not apply).

Being a cook myself, I know the rule of thumb when cooking fall of the bone ribs is to check the tenderness of the meat 1 or 2 times throughout the cooking process.. That way you don't screw it up...

Secondly, their ribs are served individually, as opposed to a rack.. Given they have chosen to cook it that way, it's a lot harder to manage the tenderness.. Each individual rib was dry 

Being a butcher shop first and bar second, I would expect the quality of meat to be much higher.. Meat wasn't juicy and flavourful.. Don't think the meat was properly washed prior to cooking.. Although the meat was cooked well done, you could taste that native \"raw\" taste of uncooked pork.. Also, they use side ribs as opposed to back ribs.. Cheaper quality meat (half the price at the supermarket).. Expect more from a butcher shop..

The wings are deep fried.. So those did fall off the bone and was juicy.. They suggested the dry rub... The Cajun flavour didn't work out for me tho.. A little bit too much on the saltiness..

The Pulled Pork Sandwich was ok.. Again under-cooked.. Had chunks of chewy pork inside.. I think they left chunks I'm it on purpose to make it unique. I ended up using a fork to help eat the pulled pork sandwich lol..

Sadly, the fries was the most above average part of the dinner.. Let's be real, who goes to a butcher shop or meat shop restaurant to eat fries..

$39 for 4 ribs, 4 wings, 1 hamburger size sandwich, and fries to fill you up.. Plus tax and 18% tip.. $52

One of us had the AYCE ribs for $19 and ate 12 ribs for the night.. Because it was super hot and muggy.. No AC.. Never seen my buddy eat so little before..

This being a bar.. With a full whiskey, scotch, and gin menu.. Last call was before 9:30.. I guess we should have checked their hours of operation..

Place wasn't well staffed.. Had a small kitchen staff.. I guess that's why the prep work for ribs and pulled pork was so off.. Had 1 manager, 1 waitress, and 1 bus boy... For a restaurant/bar establishment that could house 30+ guests..."}
{"text":"Sister restaurant to Barque Smokehouse just a block away.  We had a staff party there.  Good size for 40 of us. Food and drinks were great.  Especially lemon pepper dry rub ribs and the cake in a jar."}
{"text":"I was on my way to the original Barque with a friend. I warned him the wait would probably be super long and if it was we could go somewhere else (Pizzeria Defina came to mind), but then on the way to the original Barque I saw this new Barque! So shiny, smelled like smokey deliciousness. It was almost completely empty, just one other table. Score! 

It was an afternoon on the weekend. They had a special on: $10 for a pint of beer and either wings or ribs. We each got that deal, getting one of each. 

SO GOOD! And so cheap! $10 for a beer and some delicious smokey meat was a great deal. I was happy with the beer and the meat. I had an oatmeal stout, and I still remember it it was so good. The wings and ribs were extremely delicious. Probably my favourite in the city. I am salivating while writing this and it makes me wanna go there now. If I could rate this place higher than 5 I would. 

I daydream about this place. Definitely go if you like Barque but hate the wait and noise. It's the same tasty smokey goodness in a new location next door, with a more casual atmosphere. Less seating and it has a store front where they sell rubs. I may try some next time."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Barque when the first opened and today when trying to dine there they were FULL and it would be an hour and half wait.  We were told we can dine at the Butcher Bar which is my first time here.  The ambiance is a little different--quieter as the design reminded you have a Men's Private club where leather, wood and tuft-ing adorned most of the chairs.  Oddly enough there was a Jackie Chan movie playing on the TV and projector ?.  The place was designed roomy and specious--very beautiful.

The menu, a tad different than Barque but still had all the BBQ deliciousness.  We did not have to wait very long after walking 6 doors down and were seated quickly.  My friend and I shared the \"Meet Meat Platter for 2\" and wow it came with lots of meat!  

The ultimate BBQ meat experience includes: 
- 12-Hour beef brisket
- Pulled Pork
- Smoked pulled lamb shoulder
- Smoked banger sausage
- BBQ chicken
- 'Bama baby back ribs
- Lemon Pepper baby back ribs
- Sweet Heat Baby Back Ribs

We also ordered the large Chopped Kale Salad which was so fitting in between meat bites .  My friend had the house ice team which she loves and myself Boylans Diet Coke--All in all, the meal was not 'cheap' but it was worth it--I had quite a large doggie bag for tomorrow's breakfast, lunch and dinner 

I have to say our server was very attentive and nice.  I definitely prefer the more casual vibe of the Smokehouse but the Butcher Bar was nice too--seems great for 'dates'!

Oh right! They don't have the popcorn and spice that they do at the Smokehouse  but they did have a pretzel mix with Ringolos and such..."}
{"text":"Went here the other night with a friend visiting from out of town. Barque was busy, so we got a table in this restaurant that had a relaxed atmosphere. lots of glossy rustic wood. 

Food: After reading glowing reviews about the ribs and wings. A friend and I both got the Brisket Sandwich au jus. Nothing spectacular about the meat. The jus tasted like a ramekin of canola oil. Alongside the sandwich was some spiced fries which were a great portion and well cooked, but unfortunately the bbq spice was super overly sugary, they tasted like dessert fries. 

As to be expected, the California vegetarian sandwich, is total afterthought. Avacado, sprouts tomato and mayo on white bread. Just sandwich ingredients. There are a number of vegetarian ingredients that could be bbq'd: Haloomi, grilled veggies, mushrooms, tofu steak. Look, I get that it's a bbq place, but try to understand that vegetarians might also be dining in their establishment. It is just totally lazy.

There should be a Bechdel test for restaurants and their vegetarian options. this one wouldn't pass.

If you're looking to eat on Roncesvalles and want ribs, sounds like this is your place. If you're looking for a sandwich, go to La Cubana."}
{"text":"We had a reservation for the Barque Smokehouse but were a bit early, so the Maitre d' suggested we get a drink at their sister restaurant next door, the Butcher Bar. So that's what we did.

I can only speak of the cocktails and of the service, and both were great. The menu was pretty interesting, I would definitely go back for the food. Since the Smokehouse was really awesome, I wouldn't have any doubts for this place.

Definately a nice find in the Roncesvalles Village area :)"}
{"text":"I haven't been here to eat, but rather I go here on a regular basis to get all of my meat!  Their whole chickens are amazing, they have the best bacon I've ever purchased, their burgers are great and their sausages are fantastic.  This is my go-to for meat now.  Love this place!!"}
