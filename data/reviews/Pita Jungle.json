{"text":"After a good movie at near Harkins, we went to this location in shopville. I order the most basics of greek food, a \"gyro\". Now, you would think this corporation would at least get this right, no. The meat was dry and four pieces of what passes for tomatoes in america these days, were just awful. So its on to the humus and pita bread. I mean did they store the pita in a steamer? Two of the most basics, ruined and awful."}
{"text":"My wife and I really enjoy coming to Pita Jungle for lunch and dinner.  The seasoned chicken and hummus is one of our favorites!  Service staff is always friendly and helpful with meal suggestions.  I would recommend!"}
{"text":"Probably their busiest location. Quality food, but the portion sizes at their original location always seem to be bigger! Stay clear of the one in fashion square mall. Quality just isn't the same. Guess that is to be expected though..."}
{"text":"I have never been to Pita, this was my first memorable visit there during my lunch hour. I thought since it was very crowded that it would take forever to get my food but it took less than 10 minutes. I ordered their broiled chicken pita and it was very tasty. The only thing is that I should have told them without the garlic sauce since it makes my pita a little soggy but besides that I enjoyed it and will definitely go back to explore more on the menu. Atmosphere is noisy and busy, the employees are very helpful and professional."}
{"text":"I like Pita Jungle, I really do, lots of good food, good service.  But there is one problem for me who is a Vegan, but also on a low-fat diet.  Its that their food, while much does not contain animal products, is pretty high in fat.  Even things that shouldn't be high in fat.   Example, the Grilled Vegetable Salad has 52 grams of fat. The Veggie Burger, 41 grams of fat.  Just a Beef Gyro has 55 grams of fat, 22 of which are saturated fat.  And a Veggie Garden Wrap, 30 grams of fat.    I make many of these same things at home with 10% of the fat or less, and they taste great. There isn't any reason they can't as well.  For a regular restaurant I could live with this, but for one that puts itself off as healthy, I'm not so sure."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner last night and the hostess was beyond rude. I have NEVER had such a horrible greeting. The service overall was awful. I watched other patrons be ignored even when they were trying to pay their bills. The food is always good, but I will choose a different location next time."}
{"text":"Walked in to place a carry out order I was greeted  immediately. the waitress was so hopeful in assisting me with the more healthier choices of their menu. Answering all if the questions that I had, and like always you never go wrong with going to pita jungle so much to choose from and their service is wonderful!"}
{"text":"OMG... my review may be tainted as I ate here after being thrown out of that Amy's Baking Company, and even though I was there for over an hour... I cam into Pita Jungle STARVING!   Any ways, after having nothing palatable at ABCs, I came here for a meal (see my review on Amys Baking company). The other couple who was involved at ABC was already enjoying their meal (which they should, they had to wait over an hour at ABCs before they were thrown out) I had the Gyro X2 (I love those things) and it was great! I joked with the other couple I saw from ABCs and an employee of Pita Jungle. I learned that Pita Jungle gets a lot of business from ABC, as they are all ways throwing out customers when they complain. And the customers come right to them.  My advice to the owner of Pita Jungle, would be to offer a discount to anyone who has been thrown out of ABC. Advertise that in your window!   Just to finish this story, as I left Pita Jungle with the other couple, and we crossed the street, we saw the girl that served me she was on the sidewalk just outside the restaurant. Both myself and the couple gave her $20 and advised her to find employment elsewhere. She mentioned that they were going to implement a contract for their wait staff that was ridiculous, and she was looking.  As I read the news.... yup they did!   YAY Pita Jungle!"}
{"text":"the place is really nice but sometimes there are flys in there that can get annoying. the gyros are amazing, I just have to get past the fact that I'm eating a baby lamb. the iced chai latte is super sweet and good. the servers are always nice and the food is always quick to the table. also the pita is amazing!"}
{"text":"Great food! I have been to one of the other locations on Southern and both are amazing! My favorites are the seared ahi with hummus and the grilled vegetable entr√©e!"}
{"text":"Great place for a nice lunch with good people over good conversation. The food is great, I favor the thousand bean pita on most days, their hummus selection really keeps you eating until you waddle out of there.   The Babaganoosh was not favored by a friend of mine, but I don't really care for eggplant so I wont hold it against them.   Check it out if you haven't already."}
{"text":"We moved down here from Flagstaff, so the first time I had Pita Jungle was up north. It was great food, but piss poor service up there. Occasionally we'd get sat and then the server or whoever would never show up... ever.  When we got down here we found out there was a Pita Jungle down the street and we were a little apprehensive to go there due to a few bad experiences at another location. When we finally went, we had great service, and have returned quite a few times since.  We try not to come here too often for fear of it getting old. The food is not always great, but still eatable. When it's not great, it's just a little bland (only thing keeping it from being a 5 star). The Chicken Curry Salad is hands down my favorite dish. I'm usually shocked by the portion sizes. I don't think I've ever had a small portion here. The Chicken Curry Salad and the Medchilada are HUGE. And that's not a complaint. They also have, hands down, the BEST hummus.  Every server we've had here has been on point and speedy. I read a couple of other reviews about this location and I have retort: I don't care what my server is doing elsewhere in the restaurant as long as I get good service. If he/she is serving a table clear on the other side of the restaurant and my service doesn't suffer then I'm a happy camper.  Part of the other reasons we keep returning to this location are the prices. Good size portion dishes are right at $10. Other places with similar dishes would be in the realm of $19-$23."}
{"text":"Servce was very disappointing.  Waited 20 minutes for someone to take just our drink order.   Getting our ckeck wasn't any easier  this was my second attempt at this location. First time was a to go order, got all the way back to work an only had half my order No Pita!!  I-ronic ugh!!    Never again sad to say i love the food."}
{"text":"Pita Jungle labels themselves a vegetarian/vegan friendly restaurant yet they fry their falafel in the same grease they fry their meat? This makes no sense to me since falafels are so popular among vegetarians. I would like to see this fixed."}
{"text":"The place is pretty nice looking. I myself did not feel comfortable sitting on the raised seats section so we waited longer to be seated. The lake view is nice. There was live music starting when we left. The place is clean and the food is good. Also not expensive."}
{"text":"I recently ate at your location. I sat at the bar and was served by Jaclyn...by far one of the most personable individuals I've met. Despite the fact that the restaurant was relatively crowded, Jaclyn made sure that I had what I needed. She made some great recommendations and the drink I had was delicious. I definitely plan on visiting again and have recommended your restaurant to family friends who live in the area. :)"}
{"text":"Friday Oct. 18th      I normally don't go to this location but I was in Mesa and was in the mood for something healthier then not. It only took the host, who I later found out was the manager, 5 or so minutes to seat me. I usually get the same thing when I go to any PJ because it's easy for me to log my calories, a green tea and a mozzarella tomato with basil. Today I thought it would be nice to treat myself to a little dessert, but I had never gotten dessert at PJ before and I honestly didn't know what they had. This is where things went sour. The manager had been going around talking to tables and when he came by me I asked him for a dessert menu. He smiled in what, in retrospect, was a rather condescending way, and told me I didn't need a dessert menu because HE knew exactly what I wanted, something called a \"sopa-pita\". He explained that it was apples, almond butter, vanilla ice cream, and caramel all on a greek pita. Yeah it sounds good, it also sounds very calorie and fat packed and since I come to PJ because it's the \"art of eating healthy\" I declined and asked for a menu again. He told me that I didn't know what I was missing and walked away, straight up to the server that was taking care of me. Now I obviously cant know for sure what he told the server, but less then a minute later the check was on the table and the server was thanking me for coming in. The manager KNEW that I wanted a dessert menu and interacted with the server before I did. It became VERY clear that not only was he only interested in pushing this one dessert item but that he was not interested in taking care of anyone who wasn't \"biting\". I know I could have asked the server for the menu, he was a very sweet guy and I know it wouldn't have been a problem. But I was so shocked with the managers behavior that I honestly lost my appetite. If I am ever in Mesa and craving PJ again I will take the extra time to drive to Tempe or Chandler. Oh and I looked it up just now on Pita Jungle's webpage, there is NO dessert menu item called a \"sopa-pita\"."}
{"text":"We had an awesome girls night out at Pita Jungle this evening!  The dinner, dessert, and coffee was great.  \"Server Sam\", was so personable, timely, and made an effort to know us all by name by the time we all left.  Was a great experience as it was my first time at any of the Pita Jungle restaurants!  Thanks Sam, we will be back for dinner/lunch again soon! :)"}
{"text":"Not too bad. The service is great and the food is good. The drink list is limited to say the least, but I would go back."}
{"text":"The outside of this place looks alright but the inside is filled with amazing staff and even more delicious food. Their Mediterranean chicken salad is sooo good.  I could eat that forever."}
{"text":"Love the red pepper hummus try the lemon vinagrette on everything its the best !"}
{"text":"food was really fresh and nicely prepared I would recommend the red pepper hummus but as far as the schwarma is concerned it was just ok but overall this place isnt too bad somewhere between 3 and 4 but to err on the side of caution 3"}
{"text":"There service is always great. Even When they ar√© backed up in the kitchen. Plus food is delicious. Chicken pasta salad is my favorite."}
{"text":"Great place for happy hour food.  The tapas are so insanely cheap that you can order a bunch and put together a nice little meal.  I'm not much of a drinker so can't speak to the booze values."}
{"text":"Definitely one of my favorite places in Scottsdale!!!  I always order the same thing....  hummus as an appetizer and the pesto pizza as my meal.  Heavenly!!!  Definitely the best hummus I have ever tasted.  And the prices are very affordable.   If I were to write anything negative, I would say that sometimes you have to wait awhile.  So, if you are going to the movies afterwards or need to get back to work..... leave plenty of time.  Especially if you prefer an outside/inside seat."}
{"text":"I've been to Pita Jungle a handful of times, but this time I have found THE DISH!  I had the mahi mahi with pico on top of jalapeno cilantro hummus and seasoned pita chips. Mmmmm Mmmm!!!  It was delicious, filling, and a really beautiful dish.  On top of that, it was not bad in calories. Yes, I know, calorie talk...YUK, but really not terrible for the amount of food you get and the taste!  A must try!"}
{"text":"Love this place.  Not much more to say than simple, healthy food at a reasonable price with nice staff."}
{"text":"One of my favorite lunch places to go! Attend during happy hour and get 1-3$ tapas. My favorites are the chicken and the hummus trio. The restaurant has amazing service, yet its casual enough for just a quick lunch with some girlfriends. Recommended 100%."}
{"text":"The humus was good, the pita bread was stale. Both of our chicken wraps were so dry we could 'nt finish them."}
{"text":"Had a bad experience at their at their location at Val Vista & Williamsfield. Thanks to Kevin Berk for sending us a 25 dollar gift card, which we used at their Dana Ranch location, we had a wonderful meal and the server was perfect."}
{"text":"Guys don't go here on Lunch hour it feels like worse then a costco on saturday. Too crowded, if you have ample time go for it. Food is same as any Pita Jungle corner. Service is messed up, ask for salmon salad or any wood fire its going to take 30 minutes and 30 minutes for waiting in line, i end up eating something that i don't want but will be fast and still wasted 1 hrs 15 minutes. I won't go back"}
{"text":"Update.  I received a message reply from Bettina (and my name is WINDY, not Wendy) on June 15th  to send my contact information via email which I did. I promptly received the following response from Kevin Berk;  Hi Windy, And thank you very much for sending your contact info to us. I will have the manager get in touch with you today and we will make this right for you. Again, we are very sorry for our poor showing. We expect and will deliver a better experience next time.  Thank you for your understanding and your patience.  If for some reason you do not hear from them today, please let me know.  Best regards, Kevin   TODAY is Friday June 21st, I have not heard from Ahwatukee PJ and sent Kevin an email that I am very disappointed.   This PJ is not worth my time or money.  I wish I trusted the reviews and chose a different option for dinner. This company doesn't care about their customer, charges them for items not ordered and does not refund their money."}
{"text":"One if my favorite local spots. Very kinda staff, fresh food and always affordable. I usually get Mediterranean chicken salad, blue corn chicken nachos, Spicy chicken wrap and Chicken DeL Sol."}
{"text":"This place is deeelicous! It's a nice little restaurant that seems to be packed all the time.  The pricing is pretty decent for the amount of food given.  The boyfriend an I always start with their hummus which is absolutely amazing...but they only give you one piece of pita unless you ask for more. We also have tried the roasted bell pepper hummus which was also good but didn't wow me as much as the regular hummus.  The boyfriend and I usually come by if we a light dinner or a snack with some wine.  We usually grab some hummus and the broiled chicken salad (YUM!) The food is extremely healthy and fresh which is always a plus for me  Anyhow, definitely worth stopping by!"}
{"text":"Always an awesome experience. Everything on the menu is incredible. Love the atmosphere, and the service as well."}
{"text":"Waitstaff completely ignored us after being seated on the patio.  After asking the clueless hostess if she could find a manager she told us that she could not find him anywhere.  We ended up leaving the restaurant.  This used to be a go-to location, but we will not be visiting here again."}
{"text":"Great food of course, but service is straight bush league and carry out orders are always riddled with errors. Very hard to continue to support this location"}
{"text":"We ordered 2 yellow fin tuna salads and one was way over cooked and other was perfectly seared you would figure cook would notice huge diferrence between the 2 and had one small dressing not enough for a 1/4 salad. Also ordered a salmon salad and got some spicy chicken dish instead stay away bad service bad food."}
{"text":"Wonderful energy in this location.  No one is pushy and always laid back.  They seem to have the perfect blend of getting you what you want and need but not bothering you.  Any chance I get I will come back because honestly you can order anything including tofu and be happy here."}
{"text":"I have been to five PJ's in the valley and have to say this is the worst one. I love PJ and the food is great but this location has the worst service. Every time we go we have some issue whether it's getting our order wrong, not returning to refill drinks or something as simple as making sure we had silverware. This one needs to step up the training!"}
{"text":"I like this place. Prior to my East Coast Foodies event there, I had never been to Pita Jungle. Everyone has said how amazing they are. So, when I found out that they have happy hour, I set up an event and off us foodies went.  My fellow foodies enjoyed $2.00 beers, and $4.00 glasses of wine ( I believe) and the happy hour food menu was great! I really enjoyed my falafel, side of lentils/brown rice, and carmelized cauliflower! What a filling and healthy meal.  I will go back very soon for happy hour.  Love,  The East Coast Foodie"}
{"text":"Pita Jungle usually delivers. It's mediocre. Always good but never knocks my socks off. Chicken tikka masala is pretty good as well as a normal gyro. It's solid if you want to go somewhere cheap but still be in a restaurant setting."}
{"text":"Taboule is great here..i have been looking for taboule in the valley for a long time..its perfect here..fast service, great for a quick healthy lunch.."}
{"text":"This is chipotle style pita jungle -- I love this place! My bowl was so delicious and you get the delicious chicken and the garlic dip and all these fresh vegetables. I can't wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"My experience at pita jungle was disappointing. I just went here to grab a quick lunch. The server seemed a bit rude and rushed. Price are decent for the portion. All in all just an okay meal with few disappointments. With so many other options on the street I probably won't be coming back.."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant. The food is fresh and flavorful. I had the chicken pita and a side of hummus. The hummus is obviously home made and not from a big manufacturer. Tastes wonderful. Great atmosphere and friendly wait staff."}
{"text":"My wife and I get there at least once a week and are never disappointed in the service or the food. The greek salad is very good and rarely not made the same. The lavash shrimp, pineapple and pepper pizza is always worth it. Recently tried there new  Kalib hamburger with jalopena  peppers ground into the meat along with a hummus spread on top and lots of lettuce, tomato and onions added with garlic red potatoes, very nice flavor. The prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"Still love this place!! Awesome staff and food. Come early as this place is always full for lunch."}
{"text":"Pita Jungle. I am a pita junkie for Pita Jungle. Let me count the ways I love this place:  1. It's healthy. There is nothing better than giving your body a shot in the arm of nutrition like you do when you go to Pita Jungle. I love feeling good about eating out.  2. It's fun. The decor in every Pita Jungle I've been to (and I've been to a few) is awesome. Bikes for light fixtures? Why not? Rotating chalk art on a giant chalk board? Sure!   3. The employees. Cheerful and helpful employees who are also just cool. So cool I get somewhat embarrassed when I show up in corduroy shorts and a  simple t-shirt.   4. It's delicious. Holy crap is this food good. I dream about their hummus, their lemony vinaigrette, and their lavosh  schwarma wrap.  Which brings me to my one criticism: they screw up my order five times out of ten. Whenever I order a lavish schwarma wrap it seems they inevitably confuse it with their chicken schwarma wrap.  PLEASE, if the Pita Jungle powers that be are listening, change the name of either your lavosh schawrma wrap or your chicken schwarma wrap so that poor Pita Jungle lovers like me don't get disappointed when we get our order! If they did that (or just stopped messing it up all the time), this review will be updated to a glowing five stars!"}
{"text":"Strange location. Next to a Goodwill drop off zone which had a HUGE truck parked by front door. And another Huge truck dropping off food. Mahi Mahi was overcooked and tough. Service was just ok. We're huge Pita Jungle fans, but not this location."}
{"text":"Eat here at least once a week, always ask for christi when she is available. She is one of the best servers I have ever come across!!"}
{"text":"We have ordered food for our office from this location multiple times. Each time we have ordered from them something has been messed up. This last time was it. We had called at 10:30am to place an order for pick-up at 11:30am. Spent almost 10 minutes on the phone going over our order and confirming, only to get there and wait another 10-15min because our order was not correct. On top of having to wait for them to fix the order, which consisted of them literally just taking the protein off the salad and putting it into a box, they also didn't have our additional side of cucumber. After messing up on our order and making me wait another 10-15min they made me get back in line to pay $1.09 for the additional cucumber that THEY forgot to charge and put in. We called back and spoke with a manager and there was absolutely NO accountability for their mistakes. They clearly do not care about losing business from companies. Will never order here again or suggest them to anyone else. I suggest someone have a talk with this location because that is not how you run a restaurant."}
{"text":"Love these people and their food. Everyone's super quick and everything follows a great flavor palette. Would recommend for large groups based of this particular location'a layout! Other locations are smaller I think but this is the only one I've actually been inside of myself."}
{"text":"Good place for casual lunch here in Chandler. Location in a strip mall can be a bit of turnoff.   The hummus is delicious. A large plate is enough for four people to share. Sandwiches & salads are huge!  Always have plenty for leftovers for the next day. Never tried their bar but it was certainly busy for a Saturday afternoon.   I think they could expand their patio a little bit, but otherwise an okay place to eat here in Chandler."}
{"text":"We have been to 4 of their locations (3 in Phoenix & the one in Flagstaff).  The food is great and is usually fast and consistent.  For this review, let's focus on the Scottsdale/Shea location.  They were busy, as usual, but...  We waited 8+ minutes for the server to ask if we wanted drinks because she was at the table next to us the entire time talking about her personal life with some customers.  (She grew up in South Africa with her family and I think a twin sister until she was 9 and misses it terribly...)  When we wanted a refill, my husband (after a 15 min wait with no one coming to our table) got up and went to the bartender for refills.  She said she wasn't allowed to (direct quote).  The hummus came out as a large, we asked for a small.  If you have been here before, you know it usually takes 5-8 minutes for hummus.  We waited closer to 20 and then another 15 for our meal of a beef gyro and the spicy chicken wrap.  My beef gyro came out and it was disgusting.  The meat was crusty and dry.  I couldn't eat it even though I was starving.  The server brought the manager over to talk to us.  We should have taken that opportunity to let her in on everything, but we were too hungry and frustrated at this point and potentially not thinking clearly.  She comped the humus (was not necessary, for the record) and my meal  and then disappeared.    Another 20 minutes goes by, my hubby is done eating, we still don't have refills and just want to leave.  We had to get up and go find the manager so she could run our card.  This whole lunch took WAY over an hour and I left hungry and frustrated.  We have been to this location before but never had such poor service.  We probably won't be back to this location."}
{"text":"I love Pita Jungle, but this location's customer service is pretty terrible. Walked in to pick up a to go order, stood at the counter where it is clearly designated as the pick up area, and stood there for more than 5 minutes and received ZERO acknowledgement from the staff. Now, if it were busy then I might understand, but it wasn't. This one experience completely turned me off to this location. I will make the longer drive to the location on Shea. Next time try smiling, saying hi, and provide some acceptable customer service."}
{"text":"I have been going here since it first opened as the \"only\" PJ location in town, & with the original owners. Since they went into franchise, the staff has turned horrible and the food is not much better... we have gone back multiple times over the last year, hoping things would get better. We will NOT be going to this location again. This is a great shame as I am vegan and they used to be able to cater to that - when they actually took pride in their cooking. Sad state when the best PJ is in Gilbert... To mgmt or owner or whomever cares about this location: hire better staff and start showing some interest in your restaurant!"}
{"text":"Well, we used to love this location but over the last 2 years the food, service, and quality have really gone down hill. Went there a few days ago and had a coupon for a free dip (for bday), it was an act of congress to get what we wanted - maybe new staff, don't know. We will not be returning to this location. Shame... miss the beginning years when it was just the Tempe location (before that one went to crap too)."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. Pita jungle always has been and always will be one of my favorite places to dine in the valley.   That being said, after being on a leave to my home state for around 6 months, I was disappointed to return to a \"build your own\" style setup at this location. The food was still delicious, as always, but I was so looking forward to my (favorite) lavosh chicken shawarma wrap!  It tasted totally different than I expected. Not bad, but it seemed to be more dry and so much less satisfying. Also even the potatoes were more dry than usual. Maybe it's because the ingredients  sit out for a while before being used, I don't know! Maybe I'm just picky.  Bummed, but if it's the closest I can get to rolling into a pita jungle restaurant, I'll still take it."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in Glendale. Everything I've tried I've absolutely loved. I've had the pesto chicken pizza, the mahi mahi is amazing, the cilantro hummus is delicious. Service is always great. Their lemonade is refreshing and yummy."}
{"text":"great food bad service , staff is very obtuse , no attention to detail, love the good food I will take bad service ,..."}
{"text":"This location by far is my favorite of all of the pita jungles in the area.Great service the Pita's are always fresh and the Green tea is always amazing! If you havnt had the Babaganosh its a must have!! I bring all of my family and friends from Chicago here when they come to visit and they wish they had an amazing place like this back in the city!!"}
{"text":"My absolute favorite place to eat ever! I love taking my son on lunch dates here. The hummus is to die for. And they're very vegetarian friendly. The green tea is great, the people are great, actually, everything is so go!"}
{"text":"Amazing!!! Try the cilantro hummus and the Mediterranean chicken pita mmmm :)"}
{"text":"Although not my favorite, Pita Jungle is an okay place to grab lunch.  The food is very good, but certainly not the best.  Sometimes I feel the food is too flavorful, and not in a good way.  I did just discover that Pita Jungle has a reverse happy hour on food, and I enjoyed getting just about one of everything for about $20.  The service is pretty good and PJ finds itself in a pretty good location downtown with easy parking.  I've noticed it gets VERY busy for lunch, so allow a little extra time."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place.  It was my first and probably last visit to a Pita Jungle.  Started off OK, the service was very good.   I ordered a Lavosh Pizza that had 1 slice of tomato on each piece and unbelievably 2 of the pieces were the tomato end that it not edible and should be discarded.  As for the kalamata  olives my whole pizza had 1/2 of an olive.   Overpriced & disappointing experience."}
{"text":"I've never had a pita with a pickle in it before, but I like it!  Awesome kid's menu - the little ones can choose one each of a veggie, a grain, a protein, and a fruit for $4.99.  And their meal includes a drink.  Last time I went, I mentioned to the waitress that I didn't want to order a whole kid's meal for my daughter and that I was considering just getting a side of something for her, and the waitress informed me that I could order anything off of the kid's menu a la carte.  Sweet!  The place is packed at lunch time, but the wait is not usually too long.  The food and friendly service are worth it."}
{"text":"really dig the jungle ! very. delish and be healthy. the staff is awesome. handsome food try the homemade rice pudding ! this place is very cool. a happy place.  the people who dine here are way cool also. must check it out!"}
{"text":"First off, Louis greeted me with a smile, then Dan took my order and since I am a regular he didn't assume that I wanted my usual he took the time to take me through new items on the menu.  Then my food came out flawless.  I went with the lavosh wrap.  I have been on a macro platter kick but I was impressed with my lavosh chicken wrap. James and Tyler were there usual friendly selves.  I like how the servers are not afraid to interact with the customers.  It makes me want to frequent this restaurant.  I can't stand the chains that have no personality.  Pita Jungle is growing and turning into a corporate chain but some how they still manage to keep it feeling like the original in Tempe. Please dont change the personality. This place is my home away from home.  PS Kelsey always helps me get my GREEN TEA refills!!!"}
{"text":"Pita jungle is one of our family's favorite places to go for a quick, fresh, healthy meal. The kids love the chipotle chicken flatbread and I am addicted to the Moroccan gazpacho! We feel great when we leave and usually try make better food choices for the rest of the day!"}
{"text":"4 of us eat dinner at Pita Jungle every Monday night around 5:30 and have been doing this for over 4 years. We started going there since they used to have happy hr. and continued after happy hr. changed to a discount. One of my friends always gets a chardonnay and the hummus trio - several of the waitstaff remember her order. This past week, she was served a glass of chardonnay that was $12. When she asked the waiter to explain why it was expensive, he said it is the waiter's discretion which wine to serve if the guest does not specify. The servers are not required to ask the guest. I thought you should know before you receive a bill you were not expecting. The manager chose not to adjust the price. The cost differential of the wine will now cost Pita Jungle 4 guests that dine there on a weekly basis. You do the math."}
{"text":"If you can endure the parking lot, you will enjoy eating at this Pita Jungle location. If you're flexible (at all), stay away from the traditional lunch time (12-2) as parking is a bear!   Now - the food. Really good food with good prices. Chicken schwarma is awesome and the red bell pepper hummus is too! I call it a \"carnival of flavor\" ... I'm not sure it was really that good or if I was really that hungry - but everything tasted incredible ;)   Nice outside patio seating next to the lake comes complete with free entertainment - ducks.   Family friendly place that's also good for a quick lunch with a friend/co-worker or two. Commissioned art pieces decorate the place - so if you're an aspiring artist - this might be a good place for you, as well.   Would I return? Absolutely!"}
{"text":"This Pita Jungle is located in the food court at the Scottsdale Fashion Square Mall. Out of all the eateries in the food court, this is by far and away the healthiest. There are some vegetarian and vegan options for those looking for a meat-free dish. The lentil soup is super yum and they have some great dishes I haven't seen anywhere else. They have several locations in the valley. The one on Ray and Dobson has a patio right next to a small lake. It's a great location, but can get crazy busy, especially during lunch on the weekends or on gorgeous days."}
{"text":"Pita Jungle is our go to!  My fave is the Giro sandwich w/Greek side salad. Get extra Tzatziki, it's super good.  Husband trys everything.  Salmon with grilled vegetables, last week. I like their Tropical tea combined with lemonade (PJ Arnold Palmer) more than my usual white wine!  For an appetizer we shared a bowl of red lental soup, wonderful. Get extra pita points, it's all so delicious!  We love the huge outdoor patio, but the music and general inside vibe is always upbeat and relaxing.  Service is outstanding.  Someone else said this may be the best Ahwatukee/East Valley restaurant restaurant.  We agree!!!"}
{"text":"The absolute worst food ever. The shawerma was a chicken breast cut to pieces, the pita was cold, the only one thing good about this place was the server that's it."}
{"text":"My sister finally took me here after numerous trips to Scottsdale. The chicken hummus appetizer was great. The chicken shawarma was excellent. The rice and lentils were excellent. The roasted potatoes were very good. I can't wait to eat here again the next time that I'm back in town."}
{"text":"Been here a couple times. First time was a disappointment but figured I'd give them another chance. I can safely say this place is nothing special. Make better use of your money and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I love everything at this place! I've never been disappointed with anything I've ordered here.. I love the cilantro jalapeno hummus; it is now the ONLY hummus I eat. Nothing else compares."}
{"text":"Pita Jungle is one of my favorite places ever!!! I know I should venture out and try new things but I just get the same things everytime because it's SO amazing!!! Their roasted bell pepper hummus is by far the BEST hummus I've ever had!!!!!! :)"}
{"text":"Started going to Pita Jungle''s first restaurant on Apache over 10 years ago.  We made the 25 min drive because it was so good.  Generous portions, great flavors, with unique offerings.  Since then, they have added MANY locations and like with most that do, the quality has declined.  The three dishes we had last night were all lacking.  Chicken puttanesca was missing the capers and didn't have much flavor, Mediterranean salad bland was bland, chicken lavosh wrap dry with few of the tomatoes and onions that use to make this so yummy.   Also, the side salad was made of white limp lettuce and half the size it used to be.  PJ used to be our go to restaurant for many reasons.  Not so much anymore."}
{"text":"I love all the options PJ offers, especially the healthier dishes and the fact that there are so many choices. I've never had a bad experience here and will continue to frequent PJ because they have healthy menu items."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great vegetarian meals, Always a great evening. Even the kids love it."}
{"text":"Had dinner here yesterday, and have been here a couple of times earlier in the year. Service has been very good every time. Food is good and consistent. Definitely will keep going here."}
{"text":"Been going to Pita since they were a take out only in Tempe. Fast forward 15 + years. They are getting too big for their britches. They started franchising, hired some corporate goons and that is where it started to fall off.  The chicken has always been great but is faltering. There was never any better hummus on on the planet until they added all the red oil? Be very careful of seafood. I love the seafood dishes here, absolutely fantastic, but they have made me ill on more than one occasion. I was even hospitalized  once from the shell fish.  I have some good friends that are still managers so I go back occasionally to see them. They are not as thrilled either. Too bad. All good things come to an end. This was the best unknown gem in Arizona for years.  UPDATE. No more red oil! Pretty solid but not what it used to be. Lentil salad still kicks butt."}
{"text":"If you are looking for authentic Greek food or even an authentic tasting gyro, skip Pita Jungle and hit one of the many mom and pop Greek restaurant's around Phoenix. The food is descent, but because of the crowds that flock to the Jungle, food is usually cold by the time it reaches the table. I had previously been to a different Pita Jungle (Chandler area) and remembered the food to be tastier, but it too had the same problem with slow service.  Today I visited with my husband, because he has heard mixed things about the Jungle and wanted to decide for himself. To say the least, he was not pleased with his first. We were sandwiched between two other couples in an attempt to maximize seating in an already over crowded restaurant. We heard the couple to our left complain multiple times that the glasses and silverware were dirty. After about 15 minutes the waiter finally appeared to take the drink order and attempted to flee before we even gave our food order.  On a positive note, the prices are cheap, and the beer and wine selection is commendable. I was happy to end the meal with something yummy after the all-too-cold falafel.....pistachio ice cream/baklava plate. Next time, if we feel the need to stop by the Jungle, it will be for beverages and dessert only. Try to hit this place up during off hours as well for a more enjoyable dining environment."}
{"text":"The food is getting boring now. Nothing new and exciting."}
{"text":"I have been a fan of Pita Jungle and have eaten at this location for years.  Recently, there have been some serious quality control issues.  I order the same (Curry Chicken) salad every week.  Now, I receive a different salad every week.  Different ingredients.  Different size.  Different dressing.  I will not be ordering this dish again, last time it was not only different but terrible!  Twice it has been served with absolutely no curry sauce.  Dry chicken salad with no spice or flavor with copious amounts of dry celery chunks.  Yum..  Clearly there are some recipe issues going on in the kitchen.  Very disappointed.  Management should be watching their kitchen a little more closely."}
{"text":"So happy to see them expand in the Valley. Stopped in for late evening meal. Tried one of the specials...Chicken Curry Salad. Great flavors. Nothing over powering. Beer was only $2 or something ridiculously cheap."}
{"text":"How can you go wrong here?! The food is always greats quality. I can make a meal out if the Jalapeno Humus and the Fruit & Cheese plate. Good Happy Hour to sit out on the patio under the misters.  Probably my favorite local business in the Valley"}
{"text":"At this point, I think I've tried just about all the vegan options at Pita Jungle and while they are not great, they are better than nothing.   The falafel pita is probably your best bet and perhaps the spinach pasta salad some in 2nd. The falafel platter has a strange, strange presentation. Rather than serving the falafels with sauce and veggies on the side, they serve it up like a big salad. A big salad is not an appetizer, it's an entree. And by big, I mean BIG. Only about 5 or 6 falafels, but a ton of greens. The grilled veggie burrito doesn't have very great flavor. A lot of ginger, but not much of anything else. The thing that bothered me most about this item was that they rolled the foil *into* my burrito. So, the only way I could eat the thing was by tearing the burrito apart and trying to remove the foil from my food. This resulted in a mess. Fix this, Pita Jungle. It also bums me that the vegan options are so meager. If they just offered vegan bread and lavosh I'd be able to try more of the items. I'd love the portabello burger or the veggie burger. Alas, dairy.  At least I can say that the P.J. staff is very attentive and friendly. The wine menu is good, you have waterfront-ish dining and on Thursday nights they have live jazz."}
{"text":"If this were a review for the Chandler or Tempe Pita Jungle, I'd give a solid 4 stars. But, Pita Jungle's food court cousin unfortunately falls short of that mark. I come here from time to time because it's close to my work, fairly healthy and fairly priced. But, the food just isn't up to par. I almost always go with one of their pita sandwiches and by god, if it's not a gamble each time. Sometimes it will be warm, crunchy and full of crisp vegetables. Other times, it's a stale pita filled with wilty lettuce. If I was a high-end manager @ Pita Jungle I'd take their food from any of there sit-down restaurants and share it with their food court staff so that they know what their food is *supposed* to look and taste like. It's easy to tell when food is just sloppily thrown together with little regard, and that's make for an unpleasant meal. But, I guess, if you are looking for a $6 grab-and-go meal, Pita Jungle beats the hell out of most of Fashion Square's food-court options."}
{"text":"In considering to the virtual response from 5 months ago: Thank you.  I've been to two of your locations in the southeast valley, both of which have been minimally perceptive to children.   Advice to owner: you're soon to be a dime a dozen-- if you're not already"}
{"text":"Our server, Shelly, was fantastic!  She was very attentive, excellent service !!!  Fans in restaurant still create uncomfortable freezing....broiled chicken salad and steak gyro were perfect.  Try the baba ganoush (spelling?) best in town!  Inside tables are a bit cheap and wobbly...."}
{"text":"I have to say that this Pita Jungle location just isn't good. We are huge fans of the chain, and in particular, the Ahwatukee location. Upon moving to downtown Phoenix a year and a half ago, we've frequented the 3rd Ave location about 10 times.. all of which we have been disappointed. (Yes, we think it'll just be better the next time...) The service is never great - whether we call in an order or eat at the restaurant. The food is usually good... although on occasion it has been wrong. We're not ones to complain, coming from the service industry ourselves, but I just wish this place would get its act together as we do love the food."}
{"text":"Pita Jungle is awesomeness! The only reason I'm giving this place three stars is because the last time I ate here my lettuce had fruit fly on it. YUCK! The Gyro's I had before the fruit fly experience were tasty."}
{"text":"When we arrived, the hostess did not seat us but said simply to \"sit wherever you want.\"  We chose a small table inside.  Then we waited.  And waited further.  We looked around.  We waited more for someone--anyone to show up at our table to serve us.  We thought of food.  We thought of drink.  We thought of other places to eat.  So after further waiting, we got up and left.  The hostess said \"have a good night!\"  Sure, we will, somewhere else!"}
{"text":"Dined here for the first time tonight. The food was..A-OK! Certainly not authentic Mediterranean food but I don't think it is trying to be. The first thing we noticed when we walked in was the loudness.  Way. Too. Damn. Loud. From an acoustician's standpoint, all the hard surfaces and the cavernous dining room make for a very loud joint. This is a big minus in my book.  On to the food!  We ordered the beef gyro sandwich.  Very average but tasty nonetheless. Checked out the lentils and rice salad served warm over a bed of lettuce and veggies with dressing. Sadly, this was a bit of a miss for me. The rice was quite mushy and just didn't stand up to the heft of the lentils. The taste itself was quite fine but I couldn't get past the texture. Also, if you order this dish, know that the grain/legume level far outweighs the veggies. A huge portion (which is great for the pocketbook) but beware if you're watching carbs. The salad below was actually refreshing but all in all, the dish just wasn't for me.   Also had the dolmades which were quite nice served cold (albeit a little overstuffed for my liking).  Our server was very good, very accommodating with special requests.  Service was a bright spot for sure.  Without a doubt, while I didn't LOVE the food here, it was tasty enough for me to come back again and give it another try!"}
{"text":"We were really pleased with our reverse happy hour experience here! We ordered lots of lovely little tapas (shrimp, chicken, hummus, feta, mozz/tomato salad, dolmades, garlic dip) they were all really tasty. The service was really attentive and the value for the food is fantastic. I have eaten at this location, as well as the one in Deser Ridge. Both serve good food but I find this one to be just a touch better all around."}
{"text":"These folks are a staple in the Phoenix area and don't really need my review. Good healthy eats in a happy hipster vibe. Super reasonably priced with an eclectic Mediterranean based menu. They've got the to-go process down to a science. *they have to-go Sriracha on the ready!!!  If you've been to any house party, BBQ, or bat mitzvah in the past decade you're probably as tired of hummus as I am. Skip it. Try the baba ganoush or the garlic dip. Super veg friendly. Love you."}
{"text":"Far and away, Pita Jungle has my favorite hummus. I've eaten at Pita Jungle many a time, and probably 3 times or so in the last month at this location.  The food is consistently very good. There are some things I don't care for on the menu, and they have some consistency issues on the lavosh pizzas... I've been in times when the lavosh pizza is so topped with cheese that you choke as the melted cheese goes down and fills your throat, and I've been times when the cheese is just right. (I guess the fact that it's never been too little is a good thing.)  Because of the variability that dish, and some of the other dishes I don't care for, I just stick to the hummus (did I mention I LOVE their hummus?) and the Lavosh Schwarma Wrap. I typically eat the salad and half the wrap at the restaurant, and then have a nice meal for the next day. At roughly $7 for the wrap, you can't go wrong getting two meals out of it!  I'm a big fan of clean-cut people without lots of piercings and tatoos working at restaurants (hygiene issues on the piercings), and Pita Jungle tends to attract workers who have more tatoos, piercings, and other things I just don't particularly enjoy as far as ambiance goes. That is, of course a very personal thing for me, but it's why I'd give them 4 rather than 5 stars.  That said, I am willing to put up with those things that actually really bother me because I love the food. It's not haute cuisine, but, at this price point, it's pretty darn good."}
{"text":"I picked up take out tonight for quick and easy dinner for a hectic work night.  Was very bummed when I unpacked the food and discovered no pita was included for the hummus.  When I call the to inform them of this oversight the manager got on the phone to apologize.  He then insisted on having one of the employees deliver the pita to our home within 10 mins.  Great customer service and management and even better food!!  Way to go Desert Ridge Location!!"}
{"text":"You'd think it would be difficult for a local chain to provide a consistently great dining experience across several stores, but I've eaten at four different Pita Jungle locations and every experience has been excellent.   For starters, no visit to Pita Jungle is complete without the roasted bell pepper hummus (they'll even serve it with veggies instead of bread upon request). The four-cheese spinach quesadilla is also delish.  I pretty much always order a pita as my main event (it is, after all, *Pita* Jungle) -- the chicken shawarma and Philly chicken are top picks. The tuna and veggie salads are great choices for the \"no bread\" crowd, and if you're craving a wrap, the spicy chicken is the way to go.  The only downside? Every location tends to be busy, particularly during lunch. But that's what happens when the food is this good -- other people have an annoying way of discovering it. Service is speedy and friendly, and the prices are really reasonable."}
{"text":"Had dinner here a couple weeks ago.  I don't eat meat, so I appreciated the variety of non-meat dishes, even more vegan stuff than your average eatery.  It was a Friday night, and they were pretty busy, our party of 5 waited about 15 minutes or so.  Even though the place is in a tacky strip mall (though, I understand most of phoenix is a tacky strip mall) the inside decor was attractive and modern-cafe style.  I dug that the menu had some wines from Arizona, I like trying local stuff.  My meal was a wrap pita with a bunch of veggies, bown rice, and spices.  It had alot of flavor, and was healthy to boot.  One of my friends got the Lentil Fatoosh (sp?) salad, and holy god, was that a pile of food.  He ate dinner that night, and then the next day we both had it for lunch, and there was still some left.  I'm going to say it could have used more spices though, it was a little lacking in the flavor department.  Pretty much, good place, particularly for Vegetarians and Vegans!  Oh, P.S. that little tiny parking lot gets really full on Friday nights..."}
{"text":"Great service on ordering. I had to pick up an order and rearrange the items to fit in my bicycle and the workers were very helpful. Great food!"}
{"text":"Good thing that my wife and I are here for the food. If all of the wait staff gave their guests the same attention as their cell phones, their guest service would be extraordinary.  Please try the chicken hummus; most excellent."}
{"text":"If in the Tempe Az Area, Must Go! Delicious Food! Great Service!  The Chicken Shawarma's are to Die For! The Potatoes are Yummy Too!:P And the Hummus is Very Tasty and Creamy with Pitta Bread, Love There Pink Lemonade Like Home Made!   Big Servings!"}
{"text":"I just got married the other day and had Pita Jungle cater the event. It was spectacular!!! I planned my destination wedding and had been planning for 2 years. After finding an amazing venue I found out that they allowed outside catering. At that very moment my husband and I knew exactly who we wanted to cater the event. We used to live in AZ and on special occasions like birthdays, valentines day etc we used to go to dinner at Pita Jungle. Their food is fantastic, fresh and amazing!! When we decided to have them cater the event the staff and contact for the services was so incredibly nice, friendly, thorough and made the entire experience so amazing!! I am forever grateful to them. I don't live in AZ anymore, but I do come back every year to visit family and friends and when I do, i cannot leave and go home until I have a pesto pizza, hummus and baklava. Seriously amazing food and service!!"}
{"text":"I am a big fan of Pita Jungle. I visited the Tempe location while attending ASU and was extremely happy when the Gilbert location opened. The food is great, the servers are attentive, and there are always great pieces of art work on the walls.   If you have yet to visit, I recommend the Jalapeno Cilantro or Roasted Bell Pepper Hummus. If you want to try both, be sure to ask for half n' half and ask the server for the Greek pita or cucumber slices.  There is one downside to the restaurant and that is the location on a busy Friday, Saturday, or any other busy night. Park away from the entrance so you are not circling for a spot and/or waiting to be seated."}
{"text":"I usually love Pita Jungle ( I eat here about 4 times a week) but I will drive out of my way to avoid this location from now on.  I always order take out and the inconsistencies drive me nuts. Tonight my Mediterranean Chicken Salad was missing the golden raisins and they forgot the dressing. Last time, it was missing the cucumbers. My boyfriend always gets a side of garlic new potatoes and it has become a joke each time we pick up to see what type of container and what size they will be. We always pay the same price, but sometimes the order of potatoes is at least half the size it was the time before. Of course all of this is more frustrating because you dont realize these things until you get home. The last thing you want to do is drive all the way back to the restaraunt.  At least there are plenty of other locations to choose from because this one needs a lot of work!"}
{"text":"Overall the food was mediocre and overpriced. The service was good.  I don't recommend the gyro especially if you are accustomed to really good Chicago style gyros cooked  on a spit. The gyro meat was dry and and super salty.  The tzatziki sauce lacked fresh garden flavor that really enhances a great gyros.  Thankfully they didn't give you much. The pita bread was good.   Maybe it is a  Pita Jungle thing,  but I have never had a gyro with pickle and lettuce on it before. This is the kind of gyro I would expect at a roadside diner in North Dakota.   The side order of rice has either overcooked or undercooked because it had hard pieces in it.    The servers and other staff were dressed come-as-you-are, or in other words,  ASU dormitory genre. They were friendly  and efficient,  although you might think otherwise from the server dress code. The staff dress code might be great if you work there.  Not so great if you eat there."}
{"text":"I have been going to this Pita Jungle for years and have always recommended it to people.  It has become one of my favorite Happy Hour spots.  I especially enjoy dining on the lovely patio when the weather is nice.  I was pretty surprised when my friend and I arrived there yesterday (on a Friday at 4:00) to discover that the entire patio had been reserved for a private party.  Although there were clearly empty tables, we were not allowed to sit out there.  When we told the waitress that this was a poor customer policy, she shrugged and said, \"Well, they reserved it\".  Really?  Needless to say, we didn't stay and went somewhere else.  Very disappointing."}
{"text":"I'm a huge Pita Jungle fan and recently moved down to this area to become a regular at the Mesa location by MCC.  This location has a great parking lot, wide open restaurant, patio, and even a bar space (although I've never really seen actually sitting at the bar).  It's not as noisy as the other locations and not usually as crowded.  The food is great - as always.  Sometimes service is slow at this location and several times we've seen our food sitting on the counter ready for service, only to wait 5-10 minutes before it gets scooped up and delivered by the server.  All in all not a huge detriment - we come back time and time again.  Don't skip dessert - they have excellent rice pudding!"}
{"text":"Their happy hour and tapas are great giving you a chance to try out a bunch of the menu items for cheap while enjoying a cold beer.  Thumbs up for having SanTan Devil's Ale on draft.  I go there when I want falafel but don't want to travel very far.  The last two times I got a falafel pita there the falafel was way too salty but they're usually pretty decent and only like $5.  Their pizzas are amazing so be sure to try them as well."}
{"text":"Love this place. nice decor and great food. awesome happy hour to.  nice lil tapas to choose from and pretty good drink prices. Stella on draft is my favorite $3.00."}
{"text":"Good lord, Pita Jungles pop'n up everywhere. As you can see from my review profile I am a fan of the Jungle. I frequent there Desert Ridge  location the most but I live almost exactly between this location and the Desert ridge location so now I just flip a coin. This location has some really nice decor inside, very conteparary.Same good clean healthy food as the other locations and same good service. I have been ordering the Mahi Mahi a lot lately. Good flavor with the cilantro hummus and the pea sprouts, yes I like pea sprouts. I like to eat it like a bruschetta. I take the little pita chips it comes with and put a little bit of each ingredient on it and take a bite. Good stuff."}
{"text":"Came in for an early dinner to take advantage of their happy hour, which was pretty good.  My wife left half of her dish along with some tapas from later, but unfortunately we forgot the to go box on the table and walked out.  I came back within 30-45 seconds to grab it and was told if had already been thrown away.  They apologized but did not offer a solution.  I appreciate the fast service, but some common sense is obviously missing here..."}
{"text":"This is the first time my family and I have eaten here, so here are my initial impressions. The food was neither good nor bad, it was alright. I ordered the Chicken Shawarma with a side of rice and extra Tatziki sauce. The chicken was a bit bland, but alright. The rice was a bit undercooked and had to be eaten with the Shawarma.  The atmosphere was nice, however, for the prices, I am unsure if I will return. It seems that the flavor has been muted."}
{"text":"All I can say is YUMMY!!! The food, service, and atmosphere is amazing.  I could eat there everyday.  I have been to a lot of Pita Jungles, but this one is the best!"}
{"text":"This place has good days and bad days both with service and food, but the good days generally outweigh the bad so I keep going as the meals are huge, they use lots of veggies, and it is fairly healthy."}
{"text":"I'm visiting AZ so I was able to try this joint. I love mediterranean food. The service was good, nice atmosphere but most importantly the food is delicious and prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"Pita Jungle is the Pound for Pound champion of the city.  PJ packs the best food for dollar quality and quantity I know of in Phoenix.  Not only is it a great place with a lot of options, but it is inexpensive.  We ate there today and shared the hummus, got a cup of soup and the thousand bean hot pita and an iced tea at it was only $18.  That is great for any sit down, but even a better deal because the food is awesome.  The Hummus is great.  Two tips - 1. ask for a mix of all 3 flavors (same price and you get a chance to try all three) and 2. Ask for an extra pita (no extra cost) - not sure why you only get one to start since you can barely finish the plate with 2 pitas.  If you are in the mood for soup, I recommend the red lentil soup.  It is thick and go with the cup of soup vs. the bowl.  The cup is about as big as a full bowl anywhere else.  The soup has just the right texture and full of flavor and my wife simply calls it \"goodness.\"  Salads are always a great choice and don't worry, you get a plate overflowing with food, too.  I also go with the Thousand Bean Hot Pita.  I seriously think it comes with a full 1000 beans over a bread of brown rice on a pita - very good and half the plate will fill you up.    The only downer is that the place is pretty small and the parking lot is shared by other busy places, so at lunch you have to be a parking lot stalker to find a seat.  It is worth the wait if there is one, but they pack their food in nice to go boxes, so take out is also a solid option."}
{"text":"I came here pretty much every night during spring training. It's healthy and reasonably priced. While lots looks good, I stick with what I like. The Hummus Cilantro Quinoa Salad with Blue tortilla chips is amazing. The Mayan chili quinoa is awesome. My favorite is the garlic, portobello lavash pizza. Delicious and the lavish doesn't make you fee like a fatty for eating the entire thing (which is easy to do). And the people who work there are so friendly. All around the best healthy eating option in Peoria."}
{"text":"the atmosphere here is as good as the food. You cannot be frumpy here!  The staff is the most polite, helpful and friendly of anywhere I have ever been. And the food!  I recommend the Jalape√±o-Cilantro Hummus and Mahi Mahi. Also they have great local beers on tap!"}
{"text":"Ate here 3 days ago:  Awesome food, awesome service! Only issue was my food came a little cold. But other than that no complaints! Happy to come here again!  Todd McDoodle"}
{"text":"Probably my favorite restaurant in Arcadia - I find myself there at least once a week.  In short, the food is fresh, healthy and affordable.  The staff is friendly and knowledgable.  Their happy hour may be one of the best-kept secrets in town - specials on beer/wine and a large selection of delicious tapas - all from $1 to $3.  If I had to find a flaw I'd say the cavernous ceilings can make it a bit loud during peak times.  If you go with a date that's a soft talker, prepare to do some lip reading."}
{"text":"I love pita jungle! all locations have been great. always fresh and tasty. i love the Mediterranean chicken salad but my favorite it the grilled veggie salad and I add chicken. so so good! the hummus never fails either."}
{"text":"The service was fast and we got in and out in no time. I dont know if its just me, but I like to eat my lunch quickly on my lunch break so I can do other things, and thats what Pita Jungle offered me. Thank you!! Will come back."}
{"text":"The food is mostly good but sometimes overcooked.  If you sit at the bar expect terrible service."}
{"text":"Loved this place and our waitress, Kali was top notch!!  Very pleasant and attentive made our visit very enjoyable."}
{"text":"I went here for a business lunch.   Service was good and fast and food was great.  A bit too noisy but not much you can do.  Overall i will be back again.  Good food as always."}
{"text":"We are frequent visitors.  Healthy food, good service, good kid's menu.  Not terribly expensive.  Love this place!"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING!!! Yummy Yummy Yummy. Delicious food made fresh in house. If you've never been, you GOTTA try; and if you already have, you are probably as addicted as I am. Pita Jungle Dana Park location has a great artsy AND comfortable ambience, friendly staff, delicious food (including delicious healthy food options that cater to any specific dietary need), awesome service and an impeccable \"A\" grade  health inspection record since day one (very comforting). And the Dana Park Village is easy to get to and fun to stroll around. You can't ask for anything more!"}
{"text":"Ate here two days in a row, lunch and happy hour, and ordered the same thing both times- ribeye paco with red onions.  BOTH times they were served cold!!  Grease congealed on the plate cold! I ate them anyway, bad decision but they tasted good- not worth being sick the whole next day tho...Too bad because it is a nice place but with bad kitchen issues."}
{"text":"This place has the best food I've ever tasted !!  Just awesome the service was great the staff is very friendly and the bartender is so nice and beautiful I love eating here!"}
{"text":"Been here a number of times.  I am not a huge fan of the food but it is good.  I seem to always be torn between ordering a side if I do its way to much to eat however if I don't I feel still a slightly hungry after.  The food is different lots of dishes you can order other places but they seem to have there own special twist on things.  I know if I keep sampling the menu items I will find something I really like...  end up there most time with guys from the office who really like the eye candy that seems to almost always be in the place."}
{"text":"Good little place. Best item on the menu by far is the Fruit and Cheese Fantasia. Get it as an appetizer or meal, some of the best cheeses and fruits. The Chicken Tikka Masala. Kinda like curry chicken, verrrry good. So is the Mahi Mahi. Can get very busy some times. This place plus Baked Bear afterwards is a great combo! Chris is a fantastic waiter too."}
{"text":"I came in on a Monday night just to make a to-go order. The place wasn't too busy, very relaxing. The guy who helped me at the to-go counter was awesome. He was friendly, really helpful and made it worth me coming back next time. He was a shorter guy but definitely a great dude. Like this place a lot."}
{"text":"We love the food at pita jungle. We have been going for years. Most recently the past 8 months or so to the downtown area. The service has become so terrible I have vowed to never go to this location again.  1. Called in a to go order to pick up on the way home from work. I arrive and was told it was not ready, in fact it wasn't even put in yet (15 min from work to pita) she apologized and offered me a soda. Cool I'll take it. Mistakes happen. 20 min layer my order was done but they forgot one of the meals. They hadn't even made it. I cut my losses paid and left. I shared the one meal with my husband. Lame  2. Seated outside, waitress was so uninterested in our table I felt like she was 1. About to go home or 2. About to quit  Took our order in a timely manner but was never seen again. No drink refills and never checked in on us   3. Was seated inside but waited about 15 min to only finally being approached after flagging someone down. There was a game letting out downtown so it was busy. They were obviously understaffed. The waiter was apologetic but still was having a hard time keeping up with the customers. Food was good as usual but the staff was more concerned with the large groups than my husband and I  4. Tonight.....we sat outside and waited..... Was approached by a friendly waitress who took our order. The food was brought out by someone else.  We had no silverware and had to ask ....and never saw another employee again. Frustrated my husband went inside to pay our waitress (also the bartender) who we saw through the outdoor window talking to customers/employees and texting. No drink refills or check ins.  Our bill was $66 that is too much to pay for a terrible experience. Sorry pita, you taste yummy but your service has been consistently terrible. I will drive to another location that is out of my way before going back to this location."}
{"text":"The trio chicken hummus dish is to die for!  Order extra flatbread if you want to share with more then one person. The service is fair. I always come back, great lunch spot!"}
{"text":"Awesome food! I'm never disappointed whenever I order in or to go. I love the house special Blackbean burger and potatoes."}
{"text":"Very yummy Chicken Shawarma, but I added sauces on the side. The tahini sauce was good but I wasn't a fan of the garlic sauce (even though I love garlic). I also added taziki sauce, which was really good. The cilantro hummus is a must! So yummy.   Bathrooms were a little dirty."}
{"text":"Horrible experience. Worst service. Waited 15 mins before anyone came to the table. Finally asked if we could get drinks and the guy told us he wasn't our server. I ordered a salad without cilantro. It came with EXTRA cilantro. My friend ordered a side of Orange's to go with her iced tea. When the bill came there was a charge for a kids meal on it which we never ordered and the waiter said they had to charge us something for the side of oranges so they charged us for the price of a kids meal for 4 orange slices!!!! After getting our iced tea's that we had already waited 20 mins for there was no sweet n low or sugar on the table and waited an additional 5 mins for the waitress to bring that out. Yes, I said waiter & waitress because the sever was ever changing. I will never go back."}
{"text":"The first time my wife wanted to take me here I was not too excited. It sounded like Some hippy joint, but I was dead wrong! I love this place and we have been going here for years now! I love the service and the food is amazing! They also have a great sense of humor that I really appreciate. Thanks Pita Jungle! We will for sure be back. Pro tip, check out the bathrooms!"}
{"text":"Firstly, I was so excited that a Pita Jungle opened in Ahwatukee. I have been going to the Chandler and Tempe locations for many, many years and was always more than willing to make the drive because I love it there. Until recently, I was frequenting the Ahwatukee location on average of 1 - 2 times a week to meet friends for lunch. However, the last four times (in a row!) that I have been there, the service was abhorrent, and the food sub-par.   Here are some basic, common sense rules of thumb that the Ahwatukee Pita Jungle wait staff should learn to adhere to:  1) When customers order appetizers, soup and an entree, a waiter/waitress is supposed bring the appetizer out first, then the soup, then the entree. They aren't supposed to bring it out all at once and crowd it onto the table allowing most of what you ordered to get cold. This happened the last three times I was there.   2) It is absolutely disgusting when you see a waitress wiping down tables then, without washing their hands, turn around and pick your glass up by the freaking brim and refill your drink. NASTY!   3) It really shouldn't take 3 people to wait on a table of two. Especially when wait staff cannot effectively communicate with one another. Things inevitably get screwed up. It isn't a confusing job - I waited and bartended for years and have infinite patience and respect for those in the service industry, but Jesus H Christ, where do they find the staff here? The other locations aren't like this!  Anyways, I could keep going, but why bother? Don't waste your time at this location. the Chandler location on Ray and Dobson is only 10 minutes away and it is soooo much better!"}
{"text":"Jeffery was amazing! Great at recommendations and so personable. We will definitely be back! We love you Jeffery!"}
{"text":"We go to this specific location several times a week because we always get the best service and food. The food is always fresh and the portions are huge. My favorite is the Red Quinoa Cilantro Hummus Salad and I add chicken. The staff always recognizes my family and treats us special. We will go  out of our way to come to this location if we want Pita Jungle. Great bang for your buck!"}
{"text":"I'm a usual at the downtown pita jungle. Worked in the industry for a long time and love this place. The food is consistent and amazing. There not stingy and they really wanna make sure you enjoyed your food. The downtown pita jungle is really quick with to-go orders and its so nice to be able to grab a coffee at lolas next door or relax while waiting for your food, location is killer. So without a doubt this place is definitely a five star for the food. But the reason for this review was with my last visit in to my neighborhood pita I was pleasantly surprised with 2 of the employees. Walking in I was greeted at the door with a huge smile and not the everyday cliche line of \"welcome\" but a \"hello,  how's your day going, lets get you inside and out of the heat\" I did go at a busy time and the young gentlemen (jose i think) had to put me on a small wait. He than asked if I needed anything while I waited, he went out if his way to grab me a water. Unlike usual hosts this gentleman didn just stand at the host area he was walking around looking for tables and even bussed my table and a few of the  other tables as well. He got me seated as soon as he could. This was just the starting to my great visit! I was sat in a nice area by the window, my waitress Colleen came as soon as she saw me and took another drink order. She was very good with me, always coming to refill my drinks my food was prompt and she helped me try something new! The restirant was very busy but she didnt make me feel rushed or was short with me because she was stressed about her other tables. THIS IS HOW RESTAURANTS SHOULD BE. Colleen was restaurant responsible with the small talk not in any way inappropriate and very sweet and genuine. To say the least I was very pleased. Jose and Colleen were both well dressed, hair done and well put  together unlike some  service staff at pita jungle I have had before. I recommend this place without a doubt! And if you haven't already you should be trying my new fav the grilled veggie salad! :)"}
{"text":"Servings are generous. Wife and I split a dish to keep it light, Turkey Pita. Excellent"}
{"text":"Really like their Philly Steak Pita. Will be trying some of their desserts the next time I go."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate lunch here today. The food and the service was wonderful. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The chicken and hummus is my addiction. It's so good, I need to find a way to stop myself from eating too much. My daughter tried it on Sat and she is also in love.. And she's a VERY.. Picky eater. My husband loves the chicken philly."}
{"text":"We tried this location for the first time on Saturday night. There was a short wait to let the kitchen catch-up so we ordered drinks at the bar. Drinks were ok, if not a little on the overpriced side.   I ordered the Salmon over spinach and potatoes and my companion had the burger. The burger was overcooked and this side of flavorless...under-seasoned. My salmon was ok but the mashed potatoes were real watery and again the whole dish needed seasoning. The salmon was cooked fine but over-all both entrees were very bland. The watery potatoes were really bad.  The service was fine at the bar, hostess and server. The place is way too bright. The patio was a nice dining option. I don't think we'll be back which is a shame because we go to that AMC theater there quite often."}
{"text":"The service was not only half asked but also one of the worst in dining I've ever experienced.  I was treated rudely and should have basically served myself.  This is the last time I will dine here which saddens me because I love pita jungle!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, and great service. The portions were large and very tasty. We had the 3 hummus and chicken, and spanakopita which were both excellent and the Mediterranean plate was huge and great. Kind of an American-Southwestern-Middle Eastern fusion kind of place and vegetarian friendly. My new favorite restaurant for when I visit Phoenix."}
{"text":"There are but a few things I can eat over and over and never get sick of, and one of them is the Broiled Chicken Salad from Pita Jungle. Ohh...my....GOD it is the best thing ever!!!!! I want to give it an award! It's the most simple salad I've ever seen but every ingredient is fresh, the chicken is marinated in what I can only assume to be GOLD, and the lemon vinigarette is incredible. Plus, it's an actual \"healthy\" salad, not typical these days where the caloric content of a restaurant salad reaches into the 1000s.   I've tried other dishes here, too, but when I find something I love, i stick to it. It's not that I'm a picky eater. I eat pretty much everything. But I'm just loyal to what I love.  The Lavosh Shwarma wrap is great, too, and big enough to share or keep one half for your next meal. And their hummus is the best I've has anywhere - creamy and totally delish.   Pita Jungle is my idea of culinary perfection - healthy, tasty, and affordable. When I've indulged (Read: Delux/DQ Blizzard/Z Tejas Frusions) Pita Jungle comes to me and my body's rescue."}
{"text":"Really great food and great service. The staff is always friendly. I'd recommend getting the chicken pasta salad, Philly chicken pita, or, if you're really hungry, the curry chicken salad. Also, their lemonade is on point...not that minute maid crap."}
{"text":"Wow garlic dip just like in Lebanon! Salmon fresh as can be! Family birthday party ,too. We were welcome even with three tiny ones. Service was great, food even better. We are repeat attenders. Healthiest menu and well prepared food. Friendly staff door to door!"}
{"text":"I like the food at Pita Jungle and I get the whole young person vibe for the servers but the management ought to train them. I watched as each plate and bowl was served with a healthy portion of the server's finger. They actually carried bowls with food in it by putting their fingers inside the bowl. One waitress carried the water pitcher not by the handle but by putting her thumb inside the pitcher. I don't blame the servers as much as Managemt .m"}
{"text":"Love this place! Great food, happy hour tapas & friendly service. We have been to all the locations. Been going here for years and it's still a favorite."}
{"text":"Always consistent and healthy. Recent special was tuna poke, recommended by  Joshua, was fresh and delicious. Grilled tuna with hummus and salmon salad are yummy too. Also, very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Pita Jungle has earned a very special place in my heart as \"comfort food\".  I've been enjoying their incredible food for over 10 years now.  I feel confident in assuring you that anything on the menu is thoughtfully crafted and Incredibly delicious. As much as I adore this establishment, I will offer one warning: My friends and I typically avoid the apache Blvd. location. 90% of the time we manage to get a server named something akin to \"rainbow flower\" or \"moon stream\" and they tend to forget you are there or choose to ignore you completely.  Rest  assured, the food is consistently amazing, It's just the service.  This location (ray rd.), however, has always impressed me with impeccable service."}
{"text":"I mean lets be honest- it's all chain food out on this side of town.  For me, I really enjoy the different style of food and the overall feel of Pita Jungle.  I've been a few times now, and the only complaint I have is that I'm always torn between menu items, and that if you order too much food- they won't warn you about it, but will be happy to provide leftover containers.  I've had the nachos, the salmon, the philly steak gyro, black bean burger, the grilled chicken hummus, and the medchilada.   I'm looking forward to trying new stuff on the menu every time.  Portion sizes are absurdly large for the price.   Compared to how much it costs to get similar portion sizes at other relatively hip establishments, I think Pita Jungle is a bargain.  The other thing I really like about the place is that it stays open relatively late- with a lot of places closing early over here I really enjoy being able to roll in at 915pm and not feel rushed.    Glad to break away from the larger and way less healthy chain places and grab some fresh tasting food at pita jungle any day of the week.  if you go with one other person, I'd think that one appetizer and one hot pita each or an entree is more than enough for a healthy sized portion without needing a wheelbarrow to get back to your car."}
{"text":"Great service and the food @ this location has always been spot on...different story on other locations!  I think lyndsey was a server of mine a few times and was always on target with every step of service on all her tables i saw. Great bartender/manager too!"}
{"text":"Summertime sunset adventures on the patio under the misters.  ;-)  Healthy food, a decent wine & tea selection, and a great spot to hang out and/or eat before a movie at the theater across the lot.  My favorite is the Chicken Hummus appetizer, which is scrumptious and quite filling.  I substitute the pita bread and go for the cucumber slices instead.  A bit eclectic with healthy portions, and easy to converse as the noise level isn't bad.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Stopped for lunch because my son had dined here before & thought I would enjoy it. He was right. I loved it! Arriving just as they opened we had our choice of seating. The menu had an amazing selection of vegan food but they also will  veganize any dish by substituting other ingrediants such as tofu. The server was a very friendly & helpful young lady. She was very knowledgeable in the menu, even suggesting dishes that are vegan. Most servers in SIerra Vista (where I live) run when you say your vegan. I ordered the \" Lavosh Shawarma Wrap\". It came with grilled marinated chicken breast,grilled tomatoes,grilled onion and garlic sauce, wrapped in Lavosh bread and wood-fired. It came with a side of Greek salad. I exchanged the chicken for grilled marinated tofu & left the feta cheese off the salad. The Lavosh bread was crispy yet soft. It was remarkably good! I ate every last bite! We also shared an appetizer trio of roasted red pepper, cilantro/jalape√±o and regular hummus with pita bread. I would recommend it, yumm! My so had Chipotle chicken Lavosh pizza. Thin crispy Lavosh crust topped with grilled chili & lemon chipotle chicken covered with green onions, tomatoes, Zaatar, herbs, mozzarella cheese, feta cheese, pine nuts, and a chipotle sesame sauce. He said it was fabulous! The server gave me a menu to go & told me about Tucson locations where I eat when I am at home. Love her, the food and the whole experience! See photos......"}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of Pita Jungle but the Ray & I-10 location just doesn't seem to have their act together.  I have had to send food back several times - cold steak, super salty, there was even a metal piece from a scouring brush in my daughter's food once.  Sometimes the food comes out super fast and fresh, other times its cold and the pita is hard.  So if you are going for PJ, go to Indian School or Ray & Dobson...they are way more consistent."}
{"text":"First time to Pita Jungle and was pleasantly surprised with their selection of food. I had the Pesto Lavosh turkey wrap; had turkey pesto sauce and sun dried tomatoes. Servings are huge. It was enough for two meals. Worth the money and worth your time."}
{"text":"Eating healthy is not exactly the most fun thing to do, UNLESS you go to Pita Jungle!  The desert ridge location has a great patio, a great bar and is always busy!!  The menu is incredible!  The chicken and hummus on the \"starter\" menu is sooo good!  This weekend we tried the Mediterranean chicken salad and the black bean burger.  Being a meat and potatoes girl, I was a bit skeptical.  The meal was flavorful and filling!  We get take out there all the time too!  If you are looking for a great meal, and a great patio, look to Pita Jungle at Desert ridge!  Yum! Yum!"}
{"text":"I was in the neighborhood and craving some healthy food...thank goodness I spy Pita Jungle. We shared the Spanakopita and while it's not a lot- it is under $4. My favorite was the feta cube that was served with it. YUM. Best feta... I want to buy it in bulk it's so light and delicious. We then shared the chicken shawarma  which was perfect and the grilled vegetable side which was a little too peppery- but still very good. It was a very satisfying and filling meal and great for keeping up my energy for the rest of the day. Weee!!!"}
{"text":"Probably the BEST THING I EVER ATE was from here! I stumbled upon Pita Jungle from a review on the tempe bikram yoga website--I tried it out & OMG.  TO DIE FOR.  I had seared ahi w/ hummus ($12ish) It was amazing! Perfectly seasoned, melt in your mouth seared ahi, atop a bed of amazing hummus!---with warm pita bread. It honestly was the best thing I ever ate! Would totally recommend this to anybody who loves ahi or hummus!  I came again & had Red Quinoa Salad on special & it was super yummy! $7 for huge plate of greens, quinoa, tomatoes and of course hummus!! Totally split-able & filling.   Great craft cocktails & speciality ice teas as well. We love the patio & often come before a movie (theater next door) or after a good workout"}
{"text":"Love the food here, but the service on the patio is horrible in an epic way.  My son and I sat here for a long time before a waitress even made eye contact.  Actually asked the friendly hostess to send someone over to acknowledge we were at a table in her section.  I wish it was super busy or something to explain the miss."}
{"text":"Just heard about yelp and looked up restaurants while in the Phoenix area. This place was amazing was there last Thursday, you gotta try their hummas combo. been to many middle eastern places, this was a treat. Great discovery!"}
{"text":"Great food. Vegetarian and vegan options, you just have to ask, the servers are pretty knowledgeable with their non vegan items!  Delicious hummus' , pitas, veggie salads, quinoa-kale plare, micro platter, falafels, chipotle black bean burger (with no bun since its not vegan ) & the potatos all vegan and delicious....and OMG, their salad dressings that are made in house are to die for ! I always take my out of town veg head family members here and they love it as well and always ask to go back. Teas are delicious too. Friendly staff and fast.... Cool little hipster vibe...."}
{"text":"Food is always great, however ive been here at least 6 times and each time I was never greated, the waiter ignored me, I saw my food sit under heat lamp while waiter fluttered about not doing his job, no refils, and overall standoffish attitude of the staff will make not recommend this location."}
{"text":"Great food, urban environment, and free parking in downtown Phoenix! I had the Chicken Pita Cheese steak, and it was fantastic. I would highly recommend this place for anyone who wants the \"downtown experience\" without the hassle of downtown."}
{"text":"I honestly think pita jungle is just mediocre and over priced. For all the times I've been there I have never experienced \"wow\" food. There are so many better places to experience mediterranean food so I personally avoid pita jungle like the plague."}
{"text":"I've been eating at Pita Jungle for years and was excited when they opened in downtown Phoenix.  Unfortunately neither the food nor the service are consistent, especially in comparison to the other locations.  Is the wait staff just passing through en route to other jobs?"}
{"text":"Love the new Tempe location. We have eaten here a couple of times and have had a great experience each time.  The restaurant  is open and lively.  Serve and food are great."}
{"text":"Probably one of the worst food experiences. I have ever had. Turkey burgers were like cardboard with a white whipped egg sauce. Disgusting. The interior looks like a throw back to an Italian wedding hall from the 70's. I used to go to Pita Jungle all the time. I am never coming back again. Something has gone wrong!"}
{"text":"Love me some Pita Jungle and have been waiting, waiting, waiting for this location to open. My chicken combo plate was great as always, staff and decor are both wins and the happy hour tapas were a nice pre-meal bite (two bites each, really). I second the other reviewer's mention on no place to put my purse at the high top tables. Also the location of their computers and the servers lined up creates a bottle neck trying to get to the front door/bathroom areas. A little design flaw in an otherwise spacious and stylish space."}
{"text":"I have never, ever been disappointed by Pita Jungle. Usually we go to the Shea location but today at the Chandler location service was spectacular and super quick even though it was slammed. Everything on the menu here is outstanding."}
{"text":"Great for eats before hitting First Friday. Ordered the cilantro/jalapeno hummus before   even picking up the menu and it came out fast; I was super hungry and needed food immediately. We had the Mahi-Mahi with pita chips and a small Greek salad and like always it was delish. Service is pretty good too."}
{"text":"We were introduced to Pita Jungle by some good friends and we have been going back for the excellent food and quick service ever since. Often we order take out when we n want a delicious quick meal and don't feel like cooking. I highly recommend the Mediterranean Chicken Salad for a light hearty meal. It's all good!"}
{"text":"Love the chicken humus! Lots of flavor and chicken is warm and tender. You get 2 large pitas so I recommend splitting it with someone if you plan on getting a meal too."}
{"text":"This place blew junks tonight. Take out order wasn't ready because \"we ran out of chicken \",  missed completely two ordered items which we didn't know until home. Don't go there. Not going back.  Upon review of other commenters on Yelp, my experience last night at Pita Jungle was not unique. Not going back."}
{"text":"I chose to have a happy hour snack here a couple of days ago. It had been a while since I was a patron here, and some hummus sounded amazing at the time. And, as always, the hummus (all 3) was excellent. I opted to sit on the patio overlooking the lake that sits just across a small patch of grass and a concrete pathway. \"How did this pond get here?\" I thought for just a moment...then decided I didn't care because my black bean burger was being brought out to me.  The service is almost always amazing. The guest ducks, unfortunately, have been trained by those with lesser wills to beg table-side for some scraps from your plate, and subsequently crap all over the dining area floor. All I hear from the white duck is 'quack quack!', which I assume in duckinese means 'more hummus', but I can't be too sure. I don't even know Spanish.   Other than the pandering ducks, my experience here was very good again. Looking forward to the next visit!"}
{"text":"The food is usually very tasty and vegetarian friendly. The spinach pasta salad is great and is such a large serving its more than enough for two people.   The Veggie burger is delicious and I usually order it with both sauces on the side. It comes with roasted red pepper on it which gives it a meaty taste almost. I definitely recommend the Veggie burger for not only vegetarians but for meat eaters also.    I advise against the Caribbean salad--When I ordered it the fruit tasted funky and there were like 2 strawberries on top of a heaping large platter of fruit. My friend ordered it a second time and the fruit tasted spoiled. This is the only dish I've tried here that I didn't enjoy.    The only reason I give this place 3 stars rather than 5 is due to the service... which SUCKS! The waitresses and waiters take forever to come to your table and take your orders. Last time I ate there my friends and I wanted salads and people that came in AFTER us were served their food before we could even ORDER. Every time i eat at this place I kick myself for even tipping the worst waitresses I've EVER encountered. I've had better service at crap diners like the Waffle House.   I've been to this location countless times because it's around the corner from my house and there aren't many vegetarian places in Gilbert, but I started ordering take-out orders because the service is so terrible. Even the cashier is rude and ignores people when they're standing there asking for their order information!   Ok I feel better now that I've ranted about their terrible service."}
{"text":"not really a ton of food. pretty average. not my favorite place ever"}
{"text":"I can't say enough about this Pita Jungle and the staff. It was my first time ever going to a Pita Jungle, and my server Kyle was very helpful and knowledgeable when it came to the menu. He made some great recommendations and I loved the food. The hummus, chicken pasta salad, the salmon, chicken combo, salads and desserts were delicious and amazing. The ingredients were fresh and the portion sizes are large, which makes for some leftovers. :)  I am also a big tea drinker and was shocked to learn how many different tea combinations could be made, thanks to our wonderful server. The service was top notch and and we enjoyed the friendly atmosphere. I can not wait to go back again, and I will definitely request Kyle as my server!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here over a hundred times and am still not sick of it! I binged on the Turkey Pesto for a few months and eventually decided to venture into something else. The glazed chicken lavosh pizza (add broccoli) is amazing, hummus/ chicken is always a solid choice especially with a side of cucumber. Hmm, Fruit Fantasia is a little pricey but completely worth it if you feel like spoiling yourself with a fresh mound of deliciousness. The vibe inside perfectly blends a casual feel with class, and has a nice open kitchen where you can see the masters at work."}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times even after my first experience wasn't great I thought I would give them another chance. But it's the same each time. The food isn't that great, my pitas always fall apart on me and the vegetarian pita has no flavor. Their hummus is pretty good but I don't think I will go back since I've discovered new Mediterranean places around."}
{"text":"Cilantro jalape√±o hummus with chicken is phenomenal. I recently had to order large quantities of appetizers for a client lunch. Everyone who had not necessarily ever tried dolmades, spanokopita, falafel or gyro before really enjoyed it along with the variety of hummus I brought in. I started my Pita Jungle obsession 8 years ago in their Scottsdale location and I've never been disappointed in the food!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times. First time was a complete joke and I wish I had never chosen to eat here due to a power outage and no carbon copy receipts for credit cards. They wanted me to write down all my credit card information and what not...not okay.  Second time was alright, my order was wrong but I ate it anyways and it wasn't half bad.  Third time was actually really really good.  I enjoyed my hummus app as well as my salad I got as an entree.  Maybe its as people say, third times a charm!"}
{"text":"The salmon salad is exceptionally great tonight. The non sweet tropical berry tea is so refreshing and service was outstanding although, i didn't get his name. Tall, dark hair, charcoal gray/black pita jungle shirt with a tattoo on his right arm, something about love cant remember  what it said. The hummus trio was really good too. The pitas get really hard fast. They're nit as fresh as they used to be when they first opened.   Overall, enjoyed the experience. My company was the best.  He was the icing on my cake"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying it pains me to give PJ less than 5 stars. I'm a big fan of Pita Jungle and have been to this location many times but recently it's been a disappointment. Food has been good as expected but clientele at this location, coupled with pretty slow & unfriendly service, has us driving out of our way to go to another location. Place is a hot bed for little kids and babies. I'm not oppose to families w/ little ones - I have one myself, but if you insist on having your kids run around the restaurant and/or cry their heads off please consider a pizza place. On more than one occasion we've ran into this on weekends so it's not a one off situation. When I'm spending that kind of money all I want is a little kick back, relaxing atmosphere & good service, not inconsiderate clueless patrons."}
{"text":"I love this place. The service however is a hit or miss. Either you are going to get great service or your service it going to suck butt and it never really matters if they are busy of not.  Their hummus is smooth and creamy, so very tasty. I always get the grilled chicken pita. I love this thing, probably the reason why I always get it. My partner is a vegan and this is a great place if you are eating vegan.  Ask for Jenna if she is in, you won't be upset about the service."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service. Was told the wait would be 15 minutes, 45 minutes later the sarcastic response from the hostess was \"uh I have 4 seats in the whole restaurant.\" No effort was made to put any tables together. Apparently any group larger than 4 is an inconvenience. There are better restaurants around, don't waste your time."}
{"text":"My first experience at Pita Jungle was mediocre but my friends were raving about it. I just didn't get it. I had a veggie burger that wasn't too exciting. On the next few trips though I changed my mind. Try the hummus starter -- it's the best in all the land. You can't go wrong with a wrap or pita. I usually eat tackle the one thousand beans pita, which is a huge portion and you'll definitely have left overs.  Pita Jungle is always packed. Good, friendly service. Great for take out."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant!  I've to the Tempe, Chandler, Scottsdale, and Phoenix ones. This location is pretty unknown. The food is still GREAT. The ambiance was a little unwelcoming. The bathroom is super cold, like they want you to go in-and-out  ASAP. The people that work there seem like it's their first job at a restaurant . The employees are friendly but not as outgoing as the other locations.   The food was great and the service wasn't bad either. Very quick and knowledgeable.  I'd go to this one again since it's the only one located in the EAST valley."}
{"text":"Oh how I love Pita Jungle.   I go here often - this location and the Arcadia one. I have tried a few things, but I have a tendency to pick favorites and not stray from them. I LOVE the Spinach Pasta Salad (which I add chicken to). The Jalapeno Cilantro Hummus is sooo yummy.   To be honest, everything else I have tried hasn't really done it for me. I had the Lemon Chicken Artichoke Pasta Salad the other night and I just wasn't feeling it. The falaffel is good - but nothing compared to Pita House. My date got the salmon - he said it was really good.   The servers are always, well, entertaining. I feel the urge to go spend my latest paycheck at American Apparel before going in for dinner. You know, the whole 'unattractive on purpose' thing. Can't say it's a trend that I've ever been into.   The Scottsdale, Tempe, and Arcadia locations all fit the same mold. Trendy, nice little spots. However, I went to the Mesa one the other day and it just seemed a bit off. The set up is weird: seating is on one side and the bar is off in space in the opposite corner. I asked the bartender how business had been - she told me not so great."}
{"text":"Since Pita Jungle is right across the street from Mesa Community College on Southern and Dobson, I've heard a lot about it after I started attending MCC in September. Many kids in my classes have mentioned Pita Jungle and how tasty it is, so I had to see what all the hype was about. Since a few of my friends told me that the quesadilla there is better than any others around, I knew I had to give it a shot. When I sat down in the restaurant I asked my server about this, so called \"best quesadilla around,\" and he backed up what I've heard by telling me it's one of their most ordered meals. My usual quesadilla diet consists of simple, homemade versions with tortillas and shredded cheddar cheese, or Taco Bell's small, greasy version. So, I wasn't expecting to get much more than that. Maybe because I've never really seen anything different. But what I saw when my food arrived pretty much amazed me! I was staring down at a giant, crispy mass of melty cheese and perfectly grilled chicken. The first thing I noticed was the size. Taco Bell's version is a thin layer of cheese with a little shredded chicken folded in a greasy tortilla, in a small semi-circular shape. However, Pita Jungle's version was a large, crispy, rectangular shaped pita filled easily half an inch thick with multiple cheeses, chicken, and spinach. After staring for a few minutes, I couldn't just examine it anymore, I had to take a huge bite to see if it was as wonderful as it looked; and it most surely was! The melted blend of cheddar, mozzarella, and feta cheeses was what I imagine cheese heaven to be like. The chicken was grilled to perfection with just the right ammount of crispiness, and the pieces in each bite were huge. Finally, the spinach leaves were a nice little touch that tasted great thrown in the middle of the warm, thick cheese. I ate slowly to enjoy every bite and by the end of my night, I had to cram because I was so full. Once every scrap was gone, I came to my conclusion. Pita Jungle definitely has the best chicken quesadilla I've ever eaten, by a landslide! It has the tastiest ingredients, best portion size, and is down right the most beautiful meal I've layed eyes upon. Let me also point out that the service was super speedy for such a huge and delicious meal. I went on a Friday night, and even thought the restaurant was packed, it only took minutes for my meal to arrive. To make a long story short, I would highly recommend Pita Jungle's chicken quesadilla to anyone!"}
{"text":"I waited at the bar patiently to put in a to go order. The bartender was busy on the phone taking a to-go order which took ages and def not her fault. One guy was at the bar and pulled at his credit card, so I assumed he was ready for something as well...when she got done with her to-go order she then took a couple's order who were sitting at the bar. However, not once during this time did she acknowledge me standing there with a To go menu in my hands...not even a quick, hello! or even a, I'll be right with you, nothing. After serving and bartending for a majority of my life, that is just what you do. Once she took the couples order and entered it in, she walked passed me to the guy with the credit card since he was there before me and took care of him. Again, no acknowledgment. At that point a new guy walks up right between the guy with the credit card and myself. After she finished cashing out credit card guy, she goes right to the new guy who just walked up and starts taking his order. I immediately walked off. After waiting so patiently, I was shocked she'd skip right over me and go to the guy who just walked up. Unbelievable. It's called customer service. If you didn't know who was next, just ask!! Everyone waiting will know. I decided to leave and not give this place my business. As I waited by the hostess stand, a man came by to ask if I was helped. I said, no, that's why I'm leaving. He then said he's the manager and would like to take care of me so I'll return. I told him what happened, he said the bartender is really good and must have not seen me or something.  Either way, at the end of the day, the manager spoke to the bartender, took care of my salad and took the initiative to make things right. That and the fact their food is delicious is why I have this location 5 stars."}
{"text":"I rarely write reviews but the last few times we have gotten\" to go \"from Pita  Jungle has been very disappointing.  The last 3 times we got the chicken curry salad they have absolutely had no consistency...you never know what you might get..this time no dressing And filled with heavy garlic...last time missing  ingredients listed... It has been a favorite...but sadly after the 3ed time being a bummer..we are done...."}
{"text":"By far one of my favorite restaurants and \"go to\" staples if I dont feel like cooking during the week. Also great to-go!! We love the lavosh wraps, salads (esp. with the lemon vinagrette dressing) and hummus is delicious! Would definitely recommend. Also have great drink specials at this location."}
{"text":"I'm not a vegetarian, but some friends visiting from out of town are.  After taking them here for dinner the other night, they loved it so much that we had to go back there for lunch the next day.  Their favorite dishes: - Mediterranean platter, especially the eggplant dip - Veggie stir fry, which is technically a side, but really large enough to be a main  I had beef gyro both time and would thought it was good, but I would have preferred lamb."}
{"text":"Awesome food at a fair price. Great environment. Hummus is the best. Excellent service, except too many tattoos! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"The new best take out place in McDowell Mountain area.  But, common owner, I do like to eat in as well, so please fix the AC already!!  It seems like it has been out all summer.  Your poor employees are probably miserable.  They are sweaty and not getting any tips because people cant eat here.  Philly Cheese Wrap (steak) is the bomb!!"}
{"text":"It starts with typical Mediterranean fare and ventures into something earthier.  The tastes and flavors are across the board, making it difficult to assign a star-rating; I've had 2-star dishes alongside 4-stars.  And the service can be just as variable.  Take a friend or expect to take the extras with you; the portions are sizable.  Overall, the food is a refreshing option.    I've since been to the North Scottsdale location and found it to be nearly a clone of the Tempe.  Now they're popping up all over Phoenix.  And while I haven't been \"wowed\", I am looking forward to the soon-to-open Desert Ridge location."}
{"text":"Let me just start off by saying whenever I'm hungry and have the funds to go out (which is a rare occurrence) or have friends/family in town, I turn to PJ.  Never faltering in it's deliciousness, PJ offers so many options for most eaters out there. The only kicker (which doesn't disappoint me because I don't consume it) is they don't serve any meat other than the chicken variety. So, if you're looking for a juicy steak, go elsewhere.  That said, I really think you should stay, because, day-um their food is good. When I go there, I get the usual: a Philly chicken pita (with substituted tofu) and an iced green tea. The perfect amount of food to be full but not stuffed, and an even perfect-er price.   If I'm extra hungry, or gluttonous depending on my mood, I'll add in a trio-hummus plate that is almost too good to be true. Their menu is extensive and offers a lot of Mediterranean variety. They also have banging specials every once and a while that will only make you fall deeper in love.  Other than the food, 9 times out of 10 you'll get good service, and they're always willing to make exceptions/substitutions for you, which is lovely coming from a self-proclaimed veg with a lot of veg and vegan friends/family members.  The atmosphere is always comfortable, and with their rotating art selection, there's never a dull piece of wall to be seen.  All in all, if you're looking for an excellent meal that won't break the bank, PJ is your place.  P.s. They have a little known secret that I'd like to pass along to you because, as if from my dreams to real life, they do breakfast (!) on Saturdays and Sundays. AND, again as if from my brain to actual existence, they have daily happy hour from 2-4 p.m.   Go. Go soon and go swiftly.  Thanks be to the PJ Gods."}
{"text":"The new Pita Jungle in Desert Ridge is great, just like all the other locations! This is not your traditional Mediterranean place - they focus non offering healthy items at very reasonable prices. They have many of the staples of Greek/Mediterranean food, like gyros, chicken shawarma, hummus, etc., but lack some of the less healthy dishes (like saganaki). What they lack in traditional Mediterranean dishes they make up for with other healthy offerings, like Caribbean salad, veggie burgers, pizzas, etc. Whether you eat in their nice modern dining room or take it to go, you'll enjoy the food, and your body and wallet will thank you."}
{"text":"Always excited to see new Pita Jungle locations. Food is great as always. Will go back soon."}
{"text":"My family and I went into this pita jungle location for the first time in about a year and got to say it was fantastic!! We were greeted and seated quickly and Sarah did a great job serving us. The family and I loved the food as usual and Ashley the manager was very outgoing and helpful with new menu options to try and stopped by to make sure we had a great experience. My family and I had a great time at this pita jungle location and highly recommend it. The food and service is top notch!"}
{"text":"I've been to several Pita Jungle locations, but this one the most frequently.  I love their food and eat there once every week or two.  The hummus is the best I've ever had, all three of the flavors are excellent but the cilantro jalapeno is my favorite (and it's not very spicy).   I love that you can get cucumbers instead of pita with it too.  The Tomato, Mozzarella and Basil is phenomenal.  I can't seem to order anything else there, I get this almost every time for my meal.    The one thing I've had there that I didn't like was the spinach four cheese quesadilla.  I think it is just personal preference, but I found the lavosh bread to be too cracker-like for my taste.  Crumbs went absolutely everywhere when I tried to eat it, and I didn't think it had much flavor.  As far as service, I've had better but also worse.  Sometimes the waitresses can be curt and not very friendly.... I get kind of a snobbish attitude from some of them.  I usually get it to go, so I don't have to interact with them all that much.    I really enjoy the atmosphere, particularly the modern feel and the art.  It changes every so often and seems to be pieces brought in by local artists, it's very cool to get to see a variety of local art."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this location and go there almost daily!  Matt, at the bar, is super friendly and always makes sure our orders are perfect!"}
{"text":"I like Pita Jungle's food. The atmosphere at this location is a little too inner city industrial for my taste. The vibe is edgy and I think a lot of customers come to watch people. The staff is friendly and sufficient to handle a large crowd."}
{"text":"I like Pita Jungle. I like it a lot.  Yes, the portions are mongo, but you never leave wishing you had more.  I love that I can go here and still be healthy while eating out. The last two times I went I got the Grilled Vegetable Salad, which was tasty but I felt it was a tad on the oily side. Today I got a summer special -- the Mediterranean Salad, which had chicken, romaine, tomatoes, roasted red peppers, golden raisins, red onion, corn, cilantro and a lemon dressing. It was wonderful! I thought the raisins and corn were odd at first, but I really did enjoy it. And being that it was coming on 2:30 and I hadn't eaten much all day, I snarfed the whole thing down like a little piglet. But it was all good, healthy stuff, so I'm not feeling bad. :)  The downsides to this place are that it can be a little \"crunch-a-fied,\" but hey, I lived in Boulder, Colo., for a number of years and so I tend to like that \"granola\" way. The only thing I sometimes see is that the service can be a tiny bit slow, but that could also be because it's generally hopping when I am there. The last two times I went the service was good.  I'd love to see them offer whole-wheat pasta. That would be a dream come true.  Good food, \"crunchy\" atmosphere (which I like), well priced and healthy, wholesome stuff.  Mmmm. I could go for some of that hummus right about now!  The servers seem to have a lot of those ear stretch things, which I don't get. Maybe it's part of the crunch-a-fied uniform. Ha ha. They can keep the ear things, just keep the healthy stuff comin'..."}
{"text":"We really like this place and come here often! All the food is healthy and delicious. We have had some amazing side dishes, soups, wraps, lavash pizzas, lemonade, etc! We cannot wait to take our out-of-town family when they visit. Yum!"}
{"text":"We really like this place! The food has always been delicious. We have even started buying packages of lavosh from them. We love eating healthy here.  The only drawback so far has been the service, which has so far been just so-so."}
{"text":"Freeeeeeezing indoors. So I sat outdoors. It was 100+ degrees outside . It was comfortably cool with the parasols and misters and fans.   The only annoyance sitting outside was the huge disgusting fly that kept charging at my food and landing on it. :( Sigh. You need to hire a professional fly swatter if you're gonna sit outdoors. I would want my food too if I were a fly. Its so yummy!  Very fresh pita and hummus. Food comes out warm. Excellent harmony of taste w/ the fresh cut tomato, hummus, and pita.  I thought the grape in hummus looked tasty so I consumed it whole... only to find out that it was an olive! (it had a huge seed in the middle, followed by an extremely olive-y taste)  I got the southwest style chicken on pita seasoned with cheese. It was really good. Chicken was a little bit dry but the seasoning was done well. I liked the taste and texture of tomato, beans, corn, and seasoning that gave this dish its unique flavor.  I ended up having 2 and half meals out of this one dish. (but then again, I'm a size 00p if that tells you anything)  Would totally go here again.  Its a classy place with friendly service. I would recommend it."}
{"text":"Great place for the vegetarians and meat lovers alike. Mind you, I am not a connoisseur of  authentic Mediterranean food, but I really do enjoy this place. They honestly have the best Hummus I have ever tasted. My favorite main dish is the lentil fetoush salad. It is enough for 2-3 meals."}
{"text":"PJ is my favorite restaurant- I got hooked on the Riviara Tuna Salad in 2001. Once you go to the Jungle, you will always want to go back. They have a unique and distinct style and their walls are decorated with local artists work. All of their locations are awesome. The menu is nothing short of amazing. What I love about PJ is that the menu choices are vast and different, healthy. Come with an appetite, the portions are enormous."}
{"text":"In the past I have had nothing but positive experiences at Pita Jungle. Having visited the Flagstaff location, Chandler location and the old Tempe location (Apache Rd.) numerous times, Pita Jungle was by far one of my favorite places to eat. The Tapas, specifically the reverse happy hour, as well as the atmosphere and staff at the Apache location were amazing.          Although I loved the old location and was a bit nostalgic about it closing, I was excited to try the new location on Mill Ave. Before going to the new location for the first time, I called to confirm that they were still offering Reverse Happy Hour Tapas and to ask about parking validation. I was assured that Tapas were on happy hour from 9pm-close and that they validated for the Ashe Ave parking structure. My wife, our friend, and I arrived at around 9:10pm and were seated in a reasonable amount of time.          However, we then waited approximately 15-20 minutes before any wait staff even approached us to greet us or take our drink order, far longer than reasonable. We saw the Tapas menu in the black box on the back and noted that it clearly said 9pm-close. When the waitress finally came to our table she offered an insincere sounding apology about the wait. When we started to order tapas, she hastily informed us that the new location no longer serves reverse happy hour tapas.         I honestly found this appalling as we came specifically for the Tapas, the fact that I called beforehand explicitly asking this question, and that it clearly stated 9pm-close on the menu. When I pointed this out to the waitress she informed me that the menus had not been updated from the previous location, that it wasn't \"[her] fault that the hostess didn't know the new location's policy\" and that I was given the wrong information. She even accused me of calling the wrong location. When I voiced my concern she went to ask her manager and left abruptly. I also told her that I would still need my parking validated and she took my parking ticket.         Approximately five minutes later the waitress came back and passive aggressively informed us that they would honor the menu and that we could order reverse happy hour tapas. She also told us (as if we were being scolded) that this was a one time thing and it would not be honored in the future. As we felt a bit pressured in the moment, we put in our order and the waitress rushed off.          After about a minute of thinking about what had transpired we decided that this was not a situation we wanted to be involved with and honestly, we were worried that our food would be tampered with or spit in.         I found the waitress by one of the registers and tried to politely inform her that we wanted to cancel our order, to which she responded \"fine...I will have to go tell the kitchen\" in an rude tone,  rolling her eyes, aggressively rearranging menus, and muttering under her breath as we left. Later in the night I realized that the parking ticket had not been validated and had to pay to leave the structure.         Although I have thoroughly enjoyed my previous experiences at Pita Jungle, this particular one left an extremely bitter taste in my mouth. Not only was this detestable customer service, but also an example of poorly communicated policy. Not once was an apology offered, and I don't believe this is the type of customer service Pita Jungle endorses. I understand that working in the service industry is difficult, but there was no reason for this waitress to treat us in such a way. This was an extremely disappointing experience.          Furthermore, restaurants in this building have historically gone out of business extremely quickly, and with customer service like this, I can't see this location staying open very long.           With all that said, I am disappointed an appalled with  this Pita jungle and will not be back to this location, and for that matter, I am hesitant to return to any Pita Jungle location."}
{"text":"I like this place, went there with family. I had my favorite wood fire salmon salad. Close to harkins."}
{"text":"Overall loved the location and the fact that I was not ignored I was helped right away and my sever Crystal was great friendly and fun! Without missing a beat she refilled the drinks at the table even though the place was packed. Also Jeremy was really helpful on helping me make up my mind! The wait time on the food was a bit long, but because of the service I received I will be coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"Four of us had 4 distinct plates, each very good to excellent in their own way.  We sat outside, so the ambience in general was good, but I did notice that when I went inside it was on the loud side. Service was six stars - we were in a rush and they did everything possible to get our food, drink, check to us in the most expedient manner possible.  Highlyrecommended."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE Pita Jungle at Norterra!!!  Their food is awesome.  I have yet to have a meal that disappointed!  Their wood fired chicken is so delish in fact, I just had my left overs for lunch today.  Their portions are huge which is always a good thing because you can share if you like or just bring it home for the next day.  They have AMAZING hummus!  There is one dish with grilled chunks of steak on top of hummus; sounds weird but soooo wonderfully delicious!   Great pizza too!  Reasonable prices and nice atmosphere.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!"}
{"text":":::Ring:::  Pita Jungle:    Hello?! Me:    Hi, Can i speak to Cilantro Jalapeno Hummus? Pita Jungle:     Hold Please... Cilantro Jalepeno Hummus:     Hi, can i help you? Me:    I need to tell you something... Im in love with you. CJH:     I know... i love you too. Me:     Cool... dont tell the Lavosh Shwarma Wrap.  I think she'd be jealous of our relationship.  CJH:     I know, she's delicious, but kinda sensitive about her size... shes HUGE.   Me:     I think it's a sexy huge... i mean, she wears it well.  CJH:     Yeah... so... how about you pay attention to me and quit talking about how you like her size.  I thought you loved me.   Me:     Sorry, I'd really like to see you again.   CJH:    How about tomorrow?   Me:     Too soon... ill call you next week.  CJH:     Prude Me:     Spicy bitch CJH:    K, love you. Me:    You too.    :::Click:::  The end."}
{"text":"We typically love PJ, but this location is the worst!  The service stinks and every time we order take-out, we ask to make sure the sauces and dressings are included and every time they forget.  And when we ask to double check upon pick-up, we get attitude.  We will not be visiting or ordering from the Desert Ridge location again."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service!   We so appreciate the quality!  Thank you Brian for being so attentive!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious, I was quite surprised to find the atmosphere to be so warm and friendly. I would highly recommend this place to anyone, the food is moderate price for what you get. The GM of  Pita Jungle that greeted me was very friendly, and helpful. He answered all of my many questions thoroughly and nice."}
{"text":"The owners actually work there! Attention lazy America, the owners are physically working all day everyday. Hands down the best Pita Jungle!"}
{"text":"We have been going to Pita Jungle for years & I live 5 min away from this location. 5 years now with great service & food until recently. Within the last 2 months when me and my fiance have come in our service was horrible. Our waiter took too long to come to our table, I had to order iced tea 3 times, water twice for my fiance. They kept forgetting to bring us our beverages & it was annoying. Our food was slight warm and our waiter never checked on us both times we came in. We decided if we ever want Pita Jungle, we'll be taking it to go. The staff has completely changed and I don't see the regular awesome waitresses they used to have. I hope it changes back to the way it was when it gad awesome service and a great wait staff."}
{"text":"This is by far the best location in the valley. The food is consistently fantastic and the staff is always on point. If you're trying to choose between this location and the one on FLW, allow me to save you the trouble. Scottsdale and Shea is where you want to eat..."}
{"text":"This is our Sunday after-church destination. Phenomenal hummus, pitas, pizza, and wraps. We like the hummus trio with grilled chicken, add extra pitas and cucumbers. After that go with the mahi mahi. Our kids love the lavash pizza and red lentil soup. Get a half and half of the tropical and green iced tea and they'll always offer up a to-go cup on the way out.   My wife and I walked to the PJ in Tempe off Apache during college and now have one within biking distance again! Great vibe, healthy delicious food, and good service!"}
{"text":"A major drawback is the stale smell of the dining room.  My meal would probably have been a lot more enjoyable if I got to eat in the outdoor patio.  It's a good place, however, to take a mixed group - there's something for everyone - gyros and shwarmas for carnivores, Med platter (hummus, baba, tsaziki, tabouleh, falafel) for vegetarians.  Portions are generous - especially the lentil and rice side which was as big if not bigger than the mains.  Food hits the table fast and the prices are reasonable - no wonder this place is always packed."}
{"text":"Pita jungle is usually good. but------- Today was not. My mom and I ordered spinach pasta salad and a regular tossed salad with vinaigrette. The spinach pasta was BLAND. I wish I had Gordon Ramsey there \"This is Bland!, Where is the seasoning?!\" its okay though I got a turkey wrap instead and apologized to the waitress for being one of -----\"those\"---- costumers.  There were ROCKS in my mothers salad, she thought it was rock salt used for seasoning so she bit into it but, nope,--- \"ting ting ting\" she drops the rocks on a plate next to her.  I had already complained once to the waitress I didn't want to do it again, and my mother insisted to leave it alone but, I'm leaving this review warning others of potential rocks in your salad.  Pita Jungle, I love you guys and thats why I gave 2 stars but.... come on? Wash your salad greens before serving please? We want to come back again...  P.S. I tipped the waitress 8$ on 38$ check."}
{"text":"This is the best place in town for kids meals. They are healthy with large portions, and the kids actually like to eat them. I gave them 3 stars because I find the wait staff to be less than enthusiastic. They'll take your order, but act like they are doing you a favor. When I told my waitress the kids were starving and please bring out their food as soon as it is ready, no to wait for the adult meals, she almost rolled her eyes. Who does that?"}
{"text":"I learned about this place through my belly dancing teacher, and have been to this one and the one in mesa. The place is nice clean with lots of cool art the service is great if not a little hippie like.  I usually always get hummus some of the best hummus i have had. I would suggest not you get the hummus with ahi tuna cause when i had some i was not very good just stick to the basic. If you are tight on cash you can walk in and get a gyro for 7 bucks and it will fill you up. the portions are a pretty good size and the food is amazing! I will say the reason it got a 4 star was it is always really loud when we go. you cant hear the person sitting across from you cause its just so loud so if you are looking for a romantic quit place this is not it."}
{"text":"Babaganoush yum!  Hubby can't bring himself to order anything but the tuna.  It is tasty but the menu is so varied and everything is delicious recommend you go in a group and share.  The Tempe location has consistently great, fresh food!  The one on Southern not so much. Try Tempe!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, great alternative for a more \"healthy\" choice, and awesome happy hour. Best Gyros, best salads, and best ice tea to name a few. All in all, a FAVORITE!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places! I highly recommend the jalapeno cilantro hummus. I've never had anything like it and I could seriously eat it by the bucketful. The tabouli is great, too, as is the seared ahi that they serve with hummus (an appetizer, I believe). My only complaint is that it gets really busy during the week at lunch. Luckily, they're great at carryout."}
{"text":"Five star review is mainly for our service from Britney!! She was so fun and helpful !  Food is always good as well!!"}
{"text":"I have been frequenting Pita Jungle for over 7 years since I have moved to the Valley.  They WERE one of my favorite eateries.  I have hosted keynote speakers and workshop facilitators  from the college for lunch and dinner at Pita Jungle where we'd have upwards to 20 people at the restaurant and tip handsomely.  Today for some reason I ,along with a group of friends, was ignored as we waited to be served.  We were seated and were not offered beverages until I began to wave my hands after sitting for 10 minutes.  The waters were brought to us by a reluctant host (no servers dared to approach the table...they all stared at one another) who told us that our server was busy but she'd be right with us.  Another seven minutes passed and she'd walked by our table six times and never looked in our direction.  We decided to leave the establishment and the overworked server that couldn't acknowledge a party of three (while servicing multiple tables AROUND ours.)    In short, I will NOT be financially supporting Pita Jungle in the future. The lack of acknowledgement was so blatant that neighboring tables were looking at us and then looking at the server wondering what was going on...what a shame."}
{"text":"Great food selections made of high quality ingredients. I know I am getting handmade meals of fresh, real food, not food/like products. Everyone is super nice. They have Customer service right. Hummus and tabouli are amazing as well as gazpacho."}
{"text":"Love this place. The tabouli was so delicious! Cool and casual environment. I recommend you eat here!!!"}
{"text":"Went out after work with a couple of friends and we decided to meet up at Pita Jungle. This was my first time at this place and I really enjoyed the atmosphere. The food was delicious, I ordered a chicken pita and the drinks were also very good in price. My overall experience was great."}
{"text":"The cool, hip, healthy-vibe, made them a diamond in the rough during my college years and I am not quite sure how to feel about them now that they are everywhere including Fashion Square Mall. But if these others have the same Chicken Shawarma, Oh, how I crave their Chicken Shawarma, then I will remain a satisfied fan.   Parking during the lunch hour is brutal and the street parking has been taken up by the light-rail riders and students.  I love the healthy food options, smoothies, and vegetarian cuisine. Despite sometimes spotty service every once in awhile, I think the food is one of the best in the Valley."}
{"text":"Cool and hip place for all! The food is delicious and is very consistent with all other Pita Jungle locations. The Mediterranean chicken salad is like nothing else!!! I can't believe one of the comments here complained about the large serving of food. Guess can't please everybody (too much is way better than too little), I took it home and had a wonderful lunch next day - score!! Clean, fresh atmosphere too. I learned that the food is their original design and is quite authentic not like some traditional places where they don't even speak English (not impressed with that much authenticity). Got my vote, been going here since last July, always great - so glad PJ is here in our neck of the woods!"}
{"text":"I've noticed that the Pita Junge has been advertising on Yelp.  I've always had the attitude that if a business cares what others are saying about it online then it is worth checking out.  The wife and I ate at the one in Scottsdale.  They have a nice patio area which is where we chose to eat. The place was packed on a Saturday afternoon, that's usually a good sign.  Our server recommended a shawarma dish and I opted for one of their specials with grilled chicken over linguine.  Both were really good.  We also had a couple of pitas with a trifecta (3) of delicious humus.  We probably ordered too much food but it was a tasty place. Also, it seemed like the waitstaff was hired from a modeling agency.  But that may just be Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Awesome service, food, value.  Very clean and great set up. Server was attentive without over doing it. Got the green ice tea which was very fresh and glass regularly filled. I got just a starter but it was more than I could finish. Had the ahi tuna over hummus. You get to pick 2 so I got the cilantro jalapeno and regular. Ahi was seasoned and cooked to perfection. Dirty dishes cleared promptly.Before leaving I was offered a to go tea and it was in a very large to go cup which was needed as I had more errands to run. Cant wait to go back.."}
{"text":"I eat here about once a week and I love the service.  We usually order the same 5 items and they are always made correct amd taste the same every time.  This location has a great feeiling that not all locations possess."}
{"text":"I normally order the Gambos Con Ajo and kids normally get the traditional hummus.  I have been going to this location for the past 3 years and is a huge fan.  From location to location the taste is slightly off but tonight, it was way off at one of the best tasting locations that I LOVE to dine at (Chandler).  My Gambos dish was very sour, it tasted like they forgot the garlic and put a dash too much tomato paste.  As a matter of fact that was all that I had tasted.  My children's hummus tasted like mashed fava beans with a dash of tahini...no flavor at all.    I had asked my waitress if the ingredients has changed and she advised me that they have a new distributor and cut back the oil portion used to mix the hummus.  If these changes are permanent, it appears my frequency in dining here will change.  Pita Jungle, PLEASE go back to how you cooked things from the beginning!"}
{"text":"This location has good food, however, unless you plan to spend the entire evening waiting, ordering, eating and paying for dinner you might want to go someplace else.  The interior seating area is VERY loud, making it difficult to hold a decent conversation, outside seating is much better.  We've been there twice in the last month and both times the service has been extremely slow.  When you spend more time waiting to place your order, waiting for your food or waiting for the check then it took to eat the meal, well, there is a problem."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and what a wonderful variety on the menu!  High ceilings and a really cool vibe in this location!"}
{"text":"One off my favorite places to eat. Like their customer service and attentive servers. Usually never hesitate to make the drive with my wife for some great wine selection and amazing food. Highly recommended everyone..."}
{"text":"I have gone here 3 times now and all three times  have been very good.  The service is good and food is even better.  I love the garlic potatoes there and pitas are great as well.  All the food is fresh and tasty.  There portion sizes are huge so usually I get one of the Pitas and just eat the filling and the garlic potatoes is enough to share.  I would suggest this place to anyone who wants to go out to eat but not be unhealthy. :)"}
{"text":"The food was OK but the staff were unprofessional. One of the hostesses wore a very tight and low cut dress... For a minute I thought we were at a gentleman's club. The hostess placed our menus on a table on the patio. While we were walking to our table, the manager approached us and said \"you have to go through the front entrance,\" as if we sneaked in. He didn't care that one of us was disabled, with a cane. It took almost 20 minutes for our server to come to take our drink order. Someone from our group asked for no tomato and no onion on her wrap... too bad we couldn't find our server to correct the order because he was MIA. Lastly, the food wasn't flavorful. The shawarma was bland and sauceless. If you are into trendy places with snooty clientele and mediocre food, you will love this place.  I've been to the Pita Jungle in Scottsdale and Tempe and had very pleasant experiences at both."}
{"text":"We walked in expecting a more fast food pita experience. Instead we found a more complete Med menu. Our food was delicious and I'd recommend it. They were a little slow around lunch time."}
{"text":"The food was great!  I had the falafel salad and it was delicious.  The Cilantro hummus was really good too.  The kids had pita wraps... No complaints.    I gave 3 stars because the bathroom was gross with dirty toilette paper all over the floor.  The Phoenix Pita Jungle was cleaner than this location.    Our waiter seemed to forget to check on us and offer us refills.  Other than that the food was really good."}
{"text":"So this place opened only about a month ago, and I don't even think I can count the number of times I've been here already on both hands. I really like Pita Jungle-- laid back atmosphere, beautiful interior, delicious food! Yes, the waitstaff can be slow at times, but they are young kids, and I feel they generally fit more in the \"atmosphere\" category than \"staff,\" meaning they are all young and cool and hip, and thus contribute to the whole vibe of the place.   I could make a thousand recommendations, but I won't. Just read over the huge menu and try something you never would have thought of. I promise you, it will be good. I will tell you this, though: this location is still waiting on their liquor license as of my last visit. Have the iced tea, it's yummy! Also, this branch is planning to have delivery service soon. I may never leave my house again!"}
{"text":"The food at Pita Jungle is awesome! Love the hummus, falafel and mozzarella and tomato to name a few. I have had the Mediterranean Chicken Salad my last couple of visits and it is really good. Their passion tea is always my drink of choice.  Have been going to Pita Jungle for years now and typically dine at the Chandler location. I have had Bo for a food server mulitple times and he is awesome!!! Today I decided to request him because I really like the level of service that he provdes and he is playful and fun. He has many attributes that really set him apart. You can tell when people like what they do and are very customer service oriented. It is always refreshing to see this. I will continue to ask for Bo. He is a super cool chill guy and on point with keeping the customer happy."}
{"text":"It was my second time there. Both times the food was fresh and tasty. The atmosphere is in an open feeling room well lit with natural light."}
{"text":"They say it's all about location,location, location... Indeed there is truth to it, Pita Jungle is in the heart of Roosevelt and a few steps pass Lola's Coffee. I always walked passed this place to snag coffee and hi-jack a table to study at lolas. However as I was exiting & noticed a crowd of folks eating outside. My hunger pains got the best of me, so I decided to give it a shot and the hostess, blonde wow. Getting off point, the food was excellent their menu had a nice variety of options. Great service and the atmosphere was inviting. A kick-ass place to bring friends and chow down!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Any item is sure to please. I never get dessert out but always take a carrot cake to go."}
{"text":"I ordered a salad for takeout and there was a LIVE COCKROACH in it. It was ALIVE. I am honestly so horrified and violated, I'm shaking."}
{"text":"I don't get it.  I am not a regular by any means, but on the couple of occasions I have tried to give this place a chance they disappoint.  I was craving hummus tonight, and my wife was under the weather, so I decided to order take out.  I ordered hummus, a chipolte chicken lavosh pizza and a chicken pita.  I get home (which is literally around the corner) and the pita for the hummus is cold and stiff, like it had been sitting out for an hour.  My pizza, completely wrong.  It looks like I got the lavosh pizza instead of the chipolte chicken I ordered.  The part I don't get, is Mark who was working at the bar opened the box and looked at it.  How do you say chipolte chicken pizza when there is not even chicken on what you are looking at?    I should go back, but the lack of customer service makes it not worth the effort.  I should have known when he was talking with someone else as he answered the phone when I called, referred to me as Jeff while taking my order and tried harder to be \"cool\" than accurate, that it wasn't going to go well.  When I got there, he was confused about the woman's order in front of me, arguing with a female employee between when I paid and when he grabbed my order, and then of course reviewed my order for accuracy, which we know how that turned out.  In retrospect, I should have had him turn the box so I could see in it.  The worst part is, I now write this still hungry because the wrong item is covered with items I don't like,angry that something so simple can be done so poorly, and best of all realizing I tipped for the experience."}
{"text":"I love this place! Cool, hip yet comfortable and friendly. The wait staff and chefs are ON IT! Very good customer service, very accommodating. Super efficient kitchen that just hums along. It looks like they are having so much fun too! The lentil soup- delicious, the chicken tika- wonderful, roasted cauliflower was delicious. They have live jazz on Thursdays. I am a foodie from Chicago and this has become my go-to restaurant. Thank you Pita Jungle! Keep it up!"}
{"text":"Jaclyn was an awesome! It was my second time there. I sat at the bar and had a few drinks and took food to go. The gyro is great!"}
{"text":"Delicious if you're an omnivore. I find many of the vegetarian dishes lacking flavor, so many times they'll just load with onions. Every flavor of hummus is awesome as well as their garlic potatoes. Their pitas ultimately are really the way to go.  Oh and I personally think the service at the Apache location is typically better then the others."}
{"text":"I love pita Jungle! Everytime I am in town, I make it a point to get here. The food is fresh and healthy(ish). There ice tea comes in a variety of wonderful flavors and is so delicious. I would recommend you eat here, especially if you like yummy food with a medditeranean flare."}
{"text":"The food is very good.  Service is decent.  Atmosphere a-ok.  I just don't get how a restaurant can be so dirty. Floor, tables, cutlery, washrooms.... Day late and a dollar short, that's all I can say."}
{"text":"The first time I came here was a few years back and remember that I did not like the food . I recently went back after so long and have to say I had a very nice experience. I dont know if it is a good or bad thing that what I like most in this place is not a pita or a gyro. I love the mahi mahi and the wood fired trout. The green hummus with the mahi mahi is amazing. Both the dishes have the fish so well cooked - melt in your mouth category. Recommended for those two dishes for sure."}
{"text":"Great Mediterranean food in Arizona. Generally go once a week for a broiled chicken pita and baba ganoush. Both are very delicious and the price is very reasonable. Service is laid back and casual and food comes fast. All in all a great place for friends or a date."}
{"text":"Amazing food! I always get the hummus with chicken and it never disappoints. Katie was a super friendly and fun server!"}
{"text":"One off the best places in the area for lunch or dinner. The only reason I don't give them 5 stars, is that they are too busy. They need a larger space and additional staff. Their staff are quick, attentive, and polite, but there always seems to be more customers than space available."}
{"text":"Pita Jungle is delicious, healthy food.  I went with a group for a Sunday dinner and it was busy but we didn't have to wait for a table. We ordered pitas (so warm and yummy) and jalepeno hummus for an appetizer and I had the Lentil Salad for dinner.  I would definitely try all of the hummus flavors if I were in the area again.  I had never had lentils before and was pleasantly surprised with their flavor.  No one I was with had any complaints about their food.  The portions are enormous, prices are very reasonable, and everything is so good you forget it's good for you."}
{"text":"For a place with so many vegetarian options, I've been sorely disapointed to see that most of them include the same couple vegetables. I don't consider myself a picky eater, but the vegetables I don't care for much are summer squash, cauliflower and undercooked broccoli. Somehow, they seem to be featured in most vegetarian dishes they serve.  The other option is their medeterrianian style food, in which case, head across apache to Haji Babas pronto and get some authentic cooking for half the price. Last time I went there, I almost ran across the street and bought a tub of hummus to show them what it should taste like.   I'll eat here if someone else is paying, but I usually try to talk them into something else. The food is consistantly edible, but nothing special.  I can sum this review up in one word: BLAND"}
{"text":"Bettina L.  (manger) I am responding to your last respond... I was there having lunch with my husband at the Ahwatukee location on saturday at 12:30. My server was  Stephanie. and then on Monday I went to have lunch with my girlfriends  at the the Chandler location (1949 W Ray Rd). My girlfriend picked up the check so I don't have the server's name.  As I mentioned, both locations I have to ask for napkins and refill on water.  I am going to meet another girlfriend today at Ahwatukee location, hoping things will be different. I love your restaurant and by writing this review... I hope you guys can improve on it. I will still continue to go to both places and hope you all do well and improve on attending to customer's water refills and maybe you can leave extra napkins on the table as you serve them."}
{"text":"None of this is news.  If you want a dirt cheap meal that will make both your tongue and wallet sing, go to Pita Jungle.  I agree with previous reviewers, it is a stupid name.  Throwing that aside, this is on the short list of places I would agree to for any given meal.  By myself I tend to resort to  the Black Bean Burger, or one of the Wood-Fired Pizzas.  With the girl, our order of choice is the Hummus with Grilled Chicken, and the Fruit and Cheese Fantasia.  The latter order is a ridiculous amount of food at an unthinkably low price, which happens to be ludicrously tasty.  Pita Jungle is one of those few places where it is difficult to blow it, everything is good, healthy and affordable."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch and healthy options.  I had the lentil salad and it was delish!  We ordered the cilantro hummus and even ordered one to go :)  Had a lunch date here and so glad we came.  Waiter was friendly- although it took some time to take our order....the dining experience was great.  Food came out quickly and at a great price.  Healthy food and affordable prices.  This place is filled with a variety to choose from on the menu...  It was cleaner than the Pita Jungle in Peoria."}
{"text":"found a hair in my food. maybe a hairnet or two might help. The outdoor seating is really sidewalk seating next to the parking lot and cars. Would vote lower if the option were available."}
{"text":"Pita Jungle - please google the difference between a \"smoothie\" and a \"milkshake\"! I ordered a \"smoothie\" from your menu, only to find after the first sip that it was actually a \"milkshake\". And to make matters worse, when I asked what was in the \"smoothie\" not only did the waitress confirm it was made with ice cream and was actually a \"milkshake\" but that they use Blue Bunny ice cream!!! The worst ice cream you could possibly eat with the most chemicals including high fructose corn syrup = poison!!!!! It's shocking a place with a seemingly healthy menu would serve something so misrepresented and made with the most unhealthy chemical-packed poison available!  Please be more honest on your menu in the future. As for me, once was enough."}
{"text":"My wife loves it, I think it's pretty good. If you are into healthy food then this is your place for a sit down restaurant."}
{"text":"Love this place! The food is always amazing and unique. The prices are great and the portions are large. Pita jungle is always a good experience."}
{"text":"Always love coming to this place! One of my daughter and my favorite restaurants. The Chicken Philly pita and their tropical ice tea is delicious! Always have wonderful and quick service!"}
{"text":"Who said that being healthy meant being more expensive?  Pita Jungle is a great green location where not only the food is healthy, but it is so delicious.  Its steamed broccoli has to be considered cr√®me a la cr√®me.  The customer service is fantastic, and the interior d√©cor is chic and modern.  It is a great place to enjoy healthy food at any time of the day.  Pita Jungle would be perfect place to go on a date, as the music only adds to your experience."}
{"text":"This is absolutely by far one of my favorite places to eat!  Everything is prepared healthy and is absolutely delicious!  I can't wait for their Ahwatukee location to open!  I have been asking for an Ahwatukee location for some time and finally my dreams have come true!  Thanks Pita Jungle!  P.S.  The spicy chicken wrap is one of my favorites but everything I have ever tried is good!"}
{"text":"A little over a year ago i had a bad experience at this location. I had follow up from management regarding them addressing the issues i pointed out and i am going to give them another shot because their customer service was fantastic. Thank you for your service recovery. I appreciate the extra work and look forward to checking things out again."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE SERVICE!! Went here with my family, had ordered the kids menu for one of my kids and she wanted a salmon option (which they don't have) so we asked the waiter and he agreed to put salmon on the plate. He did not inform us that this would be an extra charge (very unprofessional). They charged us $5 for a TINY piece of salmon. we had talked to the manager, didn't get her name, but she was very rude. Did not apologize, did not take care of the issue, NOTHING. she simply blamed us for HER BAD SERVICE. My family has dined here for years and will not return back to this location. manager even gave me a card to the director of operations, why couldn't she have handled the situation herself??? Very uneducated staff!"}
{"text":"I know people love these places, but I find most of their food quite boring.  I have to load mine up with added sauces to make it palatable.  Service is also a bit slow, and many servers seem... well... high"}
{"text":"Glad to see this place open.   Beer and wine for $2.00, how can you go wrong. The service was good.  The waitress was on the spot.   I had the Philly Steak Pita. Taste was good.  Good size portions...   We will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Pita Jungle always has great food and everyone is always smiling. Tika Massala and Jalape√±o cilantro hummus is my favorite"}
{"text":"love all pita jungles, this is a cool franchise ! hummus with chicken is my favorite. and the salmon is great too ! way to go pita jungle"}
{"text":"Wonderful food here -- definitely one of my favorite places in the valley.  I really dig the decor.  There's a very large framed mirror hanging on one of the walls, and the other walls are decorated with art by local artists (for sale).  In nicer weather it's nice to chill outside on the patio next to the \"lake.\"  My favorites are the cilantro-jalepeno hummus, garlic potatoes, lentil fattoush salad (the best dang dish on the menu!), and one thousand beans.  The veggie wraps and falafels are also good choices."}
{"text":"There are many good things here....salads, baba ganoush, hummus were all tasty.  I had the chicken schwarma lavash sandwich...and it was mediocre and not really authentic.  I know Lebanese food well, and eat it often.  Chicken was bland, not very seasoned, and the garlic sauce was bland too.  Too much potato I think.  The kafta that comes on hummus as an appetizer tasted good, but muted flavors.  I felt like this was watered down, Americanized traditional Lebanese food.  But they gave a little more unique, fusion-y items that are great.  I would absolutely eat there again....but know what I would avoid."}
{"text":"Food is delicious and consistent.  Only have had one problem with Chicken in our Macro Platter.  The lady and I are vegan, and knew this had to be an accident.  Garlic potatoes and Jalape√±o cilantro hummus are a must."}
{"text":"This Pita Jungle is definitely most intimate location of theirs I have visited. It has the typical Pita Jungle feel with brick walls covered in local art, high ceilings, a cool metal tree sculpture and candlelit tables.  The lobby is a tad cramped when it gets busy, but there is adequate seating and the wait isn't too crazy. After you're seating you'll find the staff to be attentive, filling your glass before it's empty and making sure you're enjoying your meal.  The food is, as one can expect from the Pita Jungle establishments, always fresh tasting and full of flavor. From their delicious wood fired pizzas, large pitas and salads, you really can't go wrong here. They also have a nice selection of wines, which are usually pretty good.  Overall, I've always had a nice evening here, leaving satisfied and filled, without too light of a wallet."}
{"text":"You know when you find one of those places that you just CAN'T shut up about??? Yep... found it!! Been eating here for years and completely consistent everytime! My favourite two things are the 1000 Bean open-face pita dish and the Baba ganoush!! I've seriously had strangely strong yearnings, at times, for their Baba Ganoush! :) The stuff is amazing! Honestly have tried most things on the menu! No complaints about any of it! And, the people working there are cool! Since I've been eating there for years, I've obviously seen turn over in staff! But, they seem to find consistently good staff!"}
{"text":"Every time I go to PJ I know what to expect...great service and exceptional food. Their philly pita is my favorite, however the gambas con ajo (shrimp and tomatoes) is a very close second. I'm a regular at pita jungle and would suggest it to anyone and everyone looking for amazing healthy food at a fair price."}
{"text":"Usually eat here twice a week for lunch and the food never disappoints. The only issue is the wait and how crowded the lunch rush is.  The parking lot is a nightmare at this location so use the parking garage next door.  As far as food you can't go wrong with the chicken philly pita or the salmon salad. For an appetizer check out the  hummus plate. I can't speak to dessert since I'm always to full to try it. I also love how they always offer you a to go drink."}
{"text":"Awesome food! I love everything I've tried especially the hummus, just wish they didn't wash the lettuce with citric acid, yuckk! I know it helps the freshness of the lettuce, but I would rather them just soak it in ice water, does the same thing :)"}
{"text":"I really like Pita Jungle.   One of my favorite dishes here is the Lentil Fatoosh Salad.  I love the combo of the lentils on top of the lettuce, w/ the fried onions and veggies.  The lemony dressing is really great too.  I have to say though, every time I come, it seems to be made a bit differently.  Sometimes there's not enough lettuce, sometimes too many onions.  I find that the consistency of pretty much all their dishes changes a lot.    Prices are fair and the portions are unnecessarily gigantic."}
{"text":"Love Pita Jungle!  They have tons of good-looking, healthy things on their menu, but I always stick with a few of my favorites because they are so good (hummus with chicken, chicken shawarma pita, grilled vegetable salad).  Their kids meals are fabulous.  My son loves them and they are nutritionally balanced, not your regular Happy Meal or nuggets and fries.   I confess to once getting two of them to go and acting like there was another kid in the car but my three year old and I ate them.  Also, try the Happy Hour where they have lots of yummy snacks for a very reasonable price.  I have not had any problems with the service or attitude.  I like this location a bit better than the Shea one because it's quieter, partially the acoustics, I think, but it may also be a little less busy since it's newer."}
{"text":"I stumbled across Pita Jungle for my first ever AZ meal when I was on a house hunting trip 6+ years ago before moving to the Valley.  It is still my favorite and a go-to restaurant where I have never been disappointed with the food.  Lots of healthy options, I like the Chicken Shawarma Pita, the lentil soup, the falafel, and especially the hummus.  After living previously in a place with lots of delicious authentic Middle Eastern food, I have become somewhat of a hummus snob, and this is the only one that compares.  There are of other good looking and healthy choices on the menu, but in keep going back to my faves!"}
{"text":"This location is my favorite one.  Settled on a lake with an inviting patio, this is the perfect ambiance for a date or relaxing meal with friends.  Local art work adorn the walls and the atmosphere is pleasant.  Start with the Hummus trio ( it's not listed on the menu but it's a plate with each hummus on it so you can experience every one) The cilantro Jalape√±o hummus is heavily addictive. In fact, I'm gettin hot and bothered talking about it so... I digress.   The Greek salad is super yummy to start with, and the wraps are heavenly. Lavosh Shawarma wrap is a customer favorite and the California beach club *with chicken* instead of turkey is super fresh and chalk-o-block full of goodness. If you wanna keep it more traditional, the Beef Gyro is even more delicious when accompanied by Sriracha sauce.   I go here all the time and love this place more and more with every visit. Eat well, live well and surround yourselves with ones who do. - Cheers"}
{"text":"Customized antipasto platter was solid and a great chance to try a lot of things.  Very nice of my server to allow for unusual substitutions so u could avoid the dairy and try the caramelized cauliflower which I loved.  I didn't like the flavor of the grape leaves or the coldness of the ratatouille (I guess I thought that was a warm dish).  Everything else was pretty good."}
{"text":"The black  bean Chipotle  burger is Awesome!  The  manager  Tyler, and staff are always  friendly  and courteous!"}
{"text":"one of my favorite restaurants in phoenix. best hummus i've ever had."}
{"text":"It's odd to me that no one has mentioned how filthy this restaurant is. My friend and I went to eat here the other night (my first time), and you can see crumbs scattered all over the tables from several feet away.   We had to brush off our table with a napkin... and when we looked at the napkin there was a disgusting layer of black crap. This indicates that the tables are not PROPERLY cleaned. My suspicions were confirmed when we saw the bussers \"cleaning\" up after a group.. which consisted of using a *dry* paper towel to make a half-assed attempt at clearing off the crumbs. That's it. What the fuck?  Waitress was okay. She was attentive and not impolite, but I could not help feeling she was not happy to be at work. But hey, I can relate to that!  The food was great. I had the chicken tikka masala. It was heaven. I never wanted it to end. mmmmm. I don't care if it wasn't \"authentic\"- it was delicious.  I tried some of my friend's cheese pizza, which was yummy- not overwhelming or greasy like some \"real\" pizza can be. She also let me try some of her Taboule, and it was really great.   All in all, great food, okay service, but it could really use some cleaning pointers from the health department."}
{"text":"Wow!  Let's talk Hummus!  By far the best hummus I have ever had.  The roasted pepper and Cilantro jalapeno hummus are just fabulous.  I really can't decide which is better so why not get a split plate of both.  Everything I have tried here has been nothing less than tasty."}
{"text":"I typically like pita jungle for a quick meal with the family.  The server at this location was nice but the kitchen staff really needs to go back for some training.  Initially it took a while to receive the food as it came one plate at a time.  Also the quality is not as good as the one in Arrowhead on Bell or in Phoenix.  Don't waste your time with the rice pudding, it was basically water with rice and sugar."}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times now and you know what..... Pretty good. Not a place to go for a \"nice\" dinner, but great for lunch. Four stars, for a lunch restaurant.   I like their M.O., if you will. Clearly the ingredients are fresh and the menu is pretty good.  I have now had the provencal, the gyro, the chicken philly and the beef philly and all were good. I think the provencal may be a little out of the reach of the cooks here, but it was still tasty. The pita's were very good though. Big and full of meat, a very good value.  I also find it interesting how every time I come to this restaurant for lunch, it is loaded to the gills with hot chicks.... Normally, that is not something I would mention, but it is so pronounced, it seems to be noteworthy..."}
{"text":"This review is for the Southern Ave location ONLY!!  I gave it one star because of the horrible service.  It has been bad for awhile, but since we live really close to this location, we kept giving them a second chance.  NOT ANYMORE!  The waitress took 15 mins to bring extra pitas, plus it took 45 mins to deliver our meal. She wasn't very hospitable either.  When we complained to the manager, all he said was \"if ya gotta leave, leave\"!!!!!  Wow, no apologies or anything.  Won't go back to this location."}
{"text":"Much better dine in than take out experience.  The service is generally good. I keep coming back as I feel it is \"healthy alternative\" to the semi-fast Restaraunt thing. I would recommend dining in."}
{"text":"SO!  SO good!  I love the hummus, the falafel, the dolmades... mmmmmm!!!! mmmmmm!!!! mmmmmmmm!!!!!  I also love how they always let me make up what I want on my plate and bring it out to me, so I always get my favorites!"}
{"text":"I have been to a couple of the PJ locations and this one is by far the greatest.  The location (right off the light rail & in a strip mall) doesn't even matter in the light of the great service and awesome food.  Iced chai...best I've ever had...salmon, delicious...ahi tuna wrap, oh my gosh.  It is all so good and the friendly staff makes it worth the awkward location an somewhat pricey items. Great healthy options that don't lack flavor!!"}
{"text":"Pita Jungle has been (for years) my favorite restaurant.  I love a lot of restaurants, but Pita really has my heart.  If you want wonderful food, good service, pretty art to look at - stop in at any of their 4 locations.    I suggest the chicken schwarma with no pickles.  Mmmmm!"}
{"text":"Ate lunch here on Monday and my food was horrible. My chicken was cold and the service was rather poor. I dont think I will be going here again."}
{"text":"I have been here several times and I just love their food. There are so many options and all of them are awesome. The cilantro jalapeno hummus is a must try."}
{"text":"I've enjoyed 3 great meals here. The hummus is as smooth as curry. Their house made black bean burger is a real treat and the spinokapita is unbeatable.   I won't frequent this location for a while because every time I go in there it feels like the kitchen isn't being supported by the front of the house. Hostesses and their friends congregate at the front bar area, take seating from customers and have long personal conversations."}
{"text":"I have been an avid Jungler for several years.  First of all, to get the real Pita Jungle experience you have to go to their flagship location on Apache in Tempe.  The vibe is truly authentic and the food is excellent.  I grew up in Portland, OR and as soon as I was introduced to Pita Jungle, it felt like a little piece of home had been transported here.  Perhaps it's growing up in a hippy town that makes me appreciate their light but satisfying and definitely flavorful fare.  Try the Roasted Red Bell Pepper Hummus and I'm sure you will enjoy.  I wanted to addressa comment I have seen about the staff being \"flakey\".  Ok, sure, most of them are pierced or tattooed and probably wouldn't be able to work any other place with that much body art except Starbucks.  BUT they are friendly, thoughtful, and attentive.  I suppose people who deem them as flakey have already made their mind up about 20-somethings with bones through their ears and dreadlocks, but hippies are people too, man!  I'm yuppie scum, and look like it too, but if you're nice to them, they're nice to you.  Golden Rule in action.  So, get yourself to a Pita Jungle.  Each locale has a slightly different vibe.  As I mentioned, the Tempe one is decidely alternative; the Shea one is a mix of rich, old people and your mid-Scottsdaliens (not my fav); haven't been to Arrowhead but Arcadia is great; the one at Desert Ridge is from what I can tell the most removed from the original Pita Jungle's quest for differentness, but it's Desert Ridge, so they do what they do best (the food) and fit it quite nicely amongst the turbo-shopping MILFs, Affliction wearing DBs and aforementioned yuppie scum.  I will say that I was never impressed with the service at the Ray Road location, but the lake-side patio seating makes up for it.    Some menu suggestions: Glazed Chicken Lavosh Pizza Any of their hummus Falafel (appetizer or pita) Beef Gyro (not available at Tempe location) Spinach Quesadilla Chicken del Sol Chicken Tikka Masala  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed the food and service we received, but more importantly I am grateful for the professional and kind way the manager cared for my son who became ill while we were eating dinner there one Friday night. My 4-year old son ate a bite of food containing a tree nut and sesame seeds (which we did not know he was allergic to at the time of his consumption, but oh do we now!) and he started to have an allergic reaction.  The manager was so gracious to us - she checked in on us once she knew he wasn't feeling well, she took care of our bill, and even cleaned up the mess left in the bathroom hallway as we raced off to the Urgent Care located in the same parking lot. I am truly grateful for how she helped me through a very nerve-racking and embarrassing situation.  Thank you to the kind female manager on a Friday night several months ago!"}
{"text":"Fast friendly and great food!  You can order take out or sit down!  The chicken schawarma is fantastic!"}
{"text":"It's a nice place to try different kind of food, the foods are very healthy and fresh.. And are not greasy which is my favorite one in this restaurant. Service is very friendly too. It is a interesting place to spend time with friends."}
{"text":"I was in at the Desert Ridge location on Thursday, September 3 for lunch. The food was great! Our service was great as always! The manager came over more than once to check on us and be sure we had everything we needed. I highly recommend Pita Jungle to others!!"}
{"text":"I love pita jungle if you haven't tried it and are thinking about it you definitely should"}
{"text":"I have eaten at many Pita Jungle restaurants but this location by far is the worst for pick up orders.  Two times I have ordered the Wood Fired Grilled Salmon salad and they did not place any dressing on both occasions!  The fact that they \"ask\" for tips on to go orders, they should make sure everything should be there especially the \"essentials\"...salad dressing!  Yes, I called to speak to a manager.  As soon as I ask if I can speak to the manager, the person who answered the phone said right away (without even checking),  \"he is currently busy\".  Of course I didn't accept that answer.  Finally I was able to speak to the manager who apologized and reasoned that the food runners are the one who prepares the to go orders.  He offered to refund what I paid for the salad but didn't refund my tip...which I thought should have also been given back since I was not happy with the \"service\" (which is the reason for tipping).  And after our conversation, I said thank you and his reply was \"u-huh\" then he hung up the phone.  I see that there are other unhappy \"to go order\" costumer reviews on here.  I think it's time for this branch to re-evaluate or re-train their staff before they lose more customers."}
{"text":"Ehh.... Pita Jungle used to be amazing before they branched our on every corner.  Now I find it just ok (at best).  Sorry guys, sad to say the consistency of food and service just isn't there."}
{"text":"I visit this place about once a week. I love the food and the healthy choices. The lentil fatoosh salad is my new favorite. You can't go wrong with the hummus. The service is friendly and usually pretty fast. I do wish there was some sort of dress code for the staff. All that skin makes me lose my appetite."}
{"text":"The food's pretty chill, but the best part about this place is the waitress/bartender Celine!!! She is the best waitress anyone could ask for and whenever I go to the Pita Jungle I always request her! If you haven't had her as a server yet, you are seriously missing out!"}
{"text":"This Pita Jungle just disappoints. The food looks good, but it's very much hit and miss. Some standards stay consistently good, but if you venture out to try something different, you're going to be disappointed!  I tried a salmon burger today and it had ZERO flavor. I don't know how that's possible. Even the red onion had no flavor. The potatoes served on the side were almost cold, and a bit soggy. Case in point: my photo.  Looks great, right?  Nope."}
{"text":"Tough week! Came here for a business lunch. The waiter was rude or rushed/ falafel was very dry / and the tzatziki had too much mint. Shouldn't corporate restaurants use recipes? I usually go to the Tatum location and rarely have any issues. Most always 5 star. But the hummus with grilled chicken is always fabulous!  I'll try to stay north of Shea from now on."}
{"text":"Thanks to the recommendation from a friend, I'm finally trying the joint.  The server at the bar immediately assisted by taking our order. My desire to want the Mahi Mahi burger prompted her to suggest a burger not on the (quote unquote) regular menu...The Salmon Burger. Fresh dill. House tartar. Fresh spinach. Steak tomatoes. And I substituted the wheat bun for a wheat pita. The parental ordered the Pesto Pizza while the juvenile ordered a Steak Philly.   While waiting for our order, I inquired about wine choices. No Moscato, but the server politely suggested their house Sangria and provided a generous portion for my sampling pleasure. Needless to say, I ordered a glass while we waited (my glass was filled to the rim). Very tasty and recommended.   Additionally, the server was nice enough to throw in some fresh tomatoes and sliced cucumbers. Crisp and refreshing. Everyone enjoyed their meals. We even shared the cucumbers with the barker, which he thoroughly enjoyed as well.  While I can only speak to the service at the Gilbert location, I'd definitely return and recommend Pita Jungle. This place was clean and the servers were very friendly.  Thanks Benerific for the suggestion!"}
{"text":"Worast services ever... Had to walk away after waiting for 20 mins and 2 complains. Talking to manager was nothing but useless... They do not even care about customer review."}
{"text":"I really like the type of food that is served here.  Mostly Mediterranean dishes which is my favorite cuisine.  The only negative is that this place can get annoyingly crowded sometimes."}
{"text":"Pita Jungle has really grown on me over the years and this location is a big reason why.  Service is always great and friendly whether it's eatin' in or for take-away.  The restaurant has a cool design and great views of the street in Roosevelt neighborhood.  Back patio is sweet and large.  I sometimes go on my own and sit on the patio side at the bar which is also nice.    Everything I've tried on the menu is good and tasty.  Lavosh pizzas are great, the Turkey Pesto Lavash Wrap is awesome, though I think it's pretty chintzy to charge for extra dressing (really, is it like made of gold???).  Many good options for vegans and vegetarians too; the Lentil Fattoush Salad is a particularly good stand out.    A great place to go for a healthy and affordable meal.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I used Pita Jungle's catering service on Saturday for a baby shower. It was the easiest experience ever and the food was phenomenal! There were 25 people at the shower and I ordered the large Mediterranean Platter and large Chicken Combo Platter. There is so much food leftover that I won't have to cook for a week! The food was delicious (as always), but I was equally impressed with the trays & utensils. It was by far the easiest shower I've ever hosted. And the price is very reasonable."}
{"text":"I love pita jungle so much. I have been to pita jungle locations plenty of time before and am never disappointed. Whether its a salad, a pizza, or their awesome hummus! I like they decor of this location the best! Our waitress was awesome! She brought out bkalava for one of our guest because it was his birthday on her own."}
{"text":"GO to Zoe's Kitchen instead!!  I've been a regular here for a year and just had one of the worst restaurant service experiences ever. Curious what others will say.   My server was a woman I had never seen there before. I ordered a pita without onions and she practically ran away from the table before I could even finish my order. Few minutes later she throws down a plate of food with a pile of raw onions on top and turns to run away so fast that I had to yell to get her attention while the plate was still rattling on the table she had thrown it down so violently.   I told her I ordered it without onions and WITHOUT  SAYING A WORD gives me a disgusted look, grabs the dish, and takes it back to the kitchen. Not a single word. Not even to say she'd have them remake it. I was shocked.   I walked to the kitchen and told her don't worry about it. I was leaving. As I was walking out the door she tried to apologize for giving me \"bad energy.\"  I won't be back. Zoe's Is across the street and they have better, cheaper food with better service."}
{"text":"Good food and good service. A bit crowded inside, but somehow not too noisy.  The portions are enormous ... which I think is actually a downfall of this restaurant. With a mountain of food, you're going to get either bored or sick trying to finish it all (or even half for that matter).  The fatoosh salas was flavorless. Not bad, but really needed a sauce on the side or spices on top. Maybe even a little cheese. It was huge, this salad could feed a small family. There is no one on this earth that ever wants to eat that many lentils .... they really should cut salads in half or inform customers dishes are served family style.   Hot pitas are good, cold are even better."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants. The Mediterranean chicken salad is the best salad I've ever had. If I wasn't hooked on burgers and Mexican food, I'd eat it every day. I love the hummus and they have a great selection of iced tea. The children's menu is great! Lots of choices! Melissa was our server today. She was delightful, energetic and accommodating. She convinced us to get a dessert (baklava sundae) and we were all pleasantly surprised! Delicious!"}
{"text":"I thought that I would give them a try while I was in town. I tried their chicken platter as it was suggested by the hostess. I explained that I really enjoyed chicken shwarma and I I was told that this was  their version. U was disappointed with their rendition."}
{"text":"Love love pita jungle...  Food is fresh and a healthy flare to it.  Some of my favorites... Salmon Salad, lavish pizza (add chicken) trio hummus with grilled chicken or ahi (without spicy seasoning) and of course the baklava!  We come here at least once a week and never disappointed.  The bar has plenty of tvs so we can always catch a game or two!  Better than the junk food you get at a sports bar..."}
{"text":"My husband and I are vegetarians and we LOVE all things Pita Jungle!! This is our fave location because it's crazy fast and everyone is so friendly. It feels like everyone just helps each other. The only downside is that they changed up the portobella sandwiches! Insert sad face"}
{"text":"I ordered a pita off the menu that included guacamole. Upon returning to work after picking up take-out, I ate my lunch to find no guacamole. Upon calling to complain, I was told their location doesn't serve guacamole and that condiments vary by location. Really???  Then why does the menu state it has guacamole?  I was told, most locations do, but this one doesn't. That, I believe, is completely unacceptable."}
{"text":"This location is a lot more pleasant to dine at then it's Scottsdale location.  The Scottsdale location is always busy with Scottsdale's finest soccer moms. Screw that.   Pita jungle is a decent place if you are looking for food that is a bit healthier. Lots of vegetarian and light fare is offered here.  I always get the same thing, because I am a meat eater. The Gyro pita with a side of the Garlic roasted potatoes. I am disappointed that they use the preformed fabricated gyro meat for this pita. Would like to see them use the fresh shaved meat. But by judging the clientele, I'm sure it's one of the least popular pitas.   Service is always adequate. Great spot to grab a pita and iced tea and hang out."}
{"text":"Sooooo happy I found this place!! Yummers and everyone there is so nice and it's healthy"}
{"text":"Customer service is very good.  Everyone is very pleasant and they are kid-friendly.  The food is very good as well - Black Bean Burger being a favorite.    The only drawback is the beer selection, but that is easy to overlook given all the other positives."}
{"text":"I've eaten here before a couple years back, and wasn't the biggest fan, but recently couldn't stop thinking about going for lunch. I'm glad I did because the food was amazing, but the service was pretty bad. It was busy, yes, but we're still customers.   I ordered the chipotle black bean burger and I'm still thinking about it! It was seriously amazing, and my very first black bean burger! I will return to eat, because I saw a few things at other tables I wanted to try. Let's hope we get a more welcoming greeting, and our server doesn't act like we've interrupted her day.  Anyway, the food was awesome! The girl I went to lunch with liked her food, too! So, if you're OK with poor service, but still want delicious food, go ahead and eat here :)"}
{"text":"I'd give 0 stars if I would. I was ordering an order for my office which consisted of 15 meals, starters and desert. I called the day before to give them a heads up of the large order was told to call back the next day at 10am. Called at 10:15 the next day was told they don't open until 10:30 to call back then ... really??? So fine I call at 10:35 and place my order. I show up 5 mins late and my order is still not ready!  So I pay and I wait. Finally they bring my order and put it on the bar. The guy tells me he will help me take it to my car once he's takes his calls. So long story short NO ONE helped me. My car was parked around the corner by the paiwai side door. I had to make 4 trips back and forth in the heat 7 MONTHS PREGNANT!!!!! Worst customer service I have ever experienced!!! A stranger who saw what was happening ended up helping me out. Never ever going back there again. On top of they they were short on the baklava...3x5=15!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"June 2015  We have been eating at Pita Jungle for years and sadly something has changed. I have always loved the food but the service is beginning to fade. The staff used to be so on top of everything.  Last night we went to the restaurant and both ordered a cup of the curried soup. We were close to the service window so we could see everything as it developed. Our soup arrived in the window and was the only thing there for some time and was ignored by FOUR expediters, they were too busy talking and rolling silverware and looking at themselves in the mirror in front of them. The window continued to fill up with orders. Finally, one of the people that delivers the food picked up our orders, not the soup which was still sitting in the window. We asked about the soup, the delivery girl said, \"Oh, I bringing it.\" My husband said, \"we were hoping to have the soup before we received our entree's,\" she quipped \"Well, the ticket didn't say that.\" She returned momentarily with our soup which was now cold. (Can you believe the rudeness, the cook seemed to understand that it should have been delivered first as it was in the window before anything else! )  Our waitress, took our order, delivered our drinks and we did not see her again until we were done eating. But I could see her buzzing about the restaurant, because something had upset her so she walked around talking to other servers about it, and then stood behind the bar to pout. Never did she return to ask about our food, or to refill our drinks or check on us.  Pita Jungle did not used to be this way, and I am not sure what has changed, but it is disappointing. The visit before this last visit we noticed a waitress stand over the silverware looking in a mirror combing her hair in the dining room.  Bizarre.  It makes me very sad, it used to be one of my favorite places, and we are in desperate need for decent eateries."}
{"text":"We have tried for months to eat here but it  was always too crowded.  Today we got there at 11 am and were able to get a table.  We ate on the patio and were bombarded by scavenger birds.  I ordered a special, artichoke and farfalle salad and my daughter got the black bean burger.  I guess i was expecting great things, especially considering how busy they always are.  My salad was ok, but i've had better at home.  My daughter's burger was ok, but accompanied by big chunks of seasoned potatoes, which didn't seem to go with the burger.  All in all, a disappointment.  My curiosity has been satisfied, but i don't think we'll be back."}
{"text":"Great, fun place to grab some healthy food in Ahwatukee. Double check their specials and the seasonal beers. There's some good stuff here. Also, happy hour is a great time to try out all the apps!"}
{"text":"Mmmmm, I love Pita Jungle!  I have been frequenting this restaurant back when there was just the one on Apache and you ordered at the counter.  I live near this location on Dobson and Ray, so this has now become my place to go and get hummus and a chicken shwarma.   Since I've been coming here I pretty much only get those two items, knowing that they will be tasty and delicious.  I always order a large hummus and a couple of extra pitas and then box up the rest to eat later.  I gave 4 stars simply because the service can be hit-or-miss.  For example, I have received my food order- had it dropped off at the table and the person turn and leave- while I still have no plate or silverware.  Then I find myself waiting to find someone to ask for a plate and silverware.  Otherwise, start with a hummus and pick something else off the menu...you can't go wrong!  Just make sure you get a plate and silverware before your food!"}
{"text":"I'm drooling just thinking about the Tikka Masala.... Extra beans sprouts...extraEXTRA masala.  With a delicious glass of happy hour wine.  This is my favorite place to stop after work downtown.    IT's always bustling busy, cool-clean and the service is impeccable.    How can you really screw up pita's and hummus you KNOW?! A+"}
{"text":"Went there on Friday for lunch. The place was packed. And noisy.  Stepped in and a young girl with shorts and flimsy t-shirt asked me \"how many\"? I was shocked to find she worked here. I would be ashamed to go out in public dressed like that.   Sat at the bar since it was so crowded. Service there was good. Wait staff coming through was attractive and dressed nice. Good selection of beverages at the bar.   I ordered the Honey Chicken Pizza, it was pretty good. Not over flavorful but decent. It was cut into 8 pieces and I could only manage to get 3 of them down, and brought the rest home. I would go back again. They must do something about the acoustics there though."}
{"text":"This was my first trip to a Pita Jungle .. but it definitely won't be my last!  The service was great.  And the food was better!  I had the salad with seared tuna, my friend had the black bean burger and we split a sampler plate of hummus.  The hummus was incredible!  Everything else was great too.     We'll definitely be back .."}
{"text":"I have been eating at Pita Jungle since the original location opened and have never had such a horrendous experience.  I recently met a group of friends at the Ray Rd location. When we arrived it wasn't that busy, but we still waited quite a few minutes for anyone to greet us. Most of the young servers seemed busy hanging out in the kitchen and the drink station areas. This doesn't set a professional atmosphere. Customers are waiting, so the employees can \"hang out\" at work? After waiting around ten minutes our server came to the table, no introduction, and said, \"Drinks?\" We decided to go ahead and order the Hummus with chicken, Spanakopita, and a Greek Salad to start with. The chicken served with the hummus was horrible. Little tiny pieces of burnt dried chicken that looked as if it had been chewed and somehow there was a puddle of grease surrounding the chicken. Pita Jungle usually has some of the moistest, flavorful chicken. The pita's served to us were hard and still seemed to be frozen in the middle. The Spanakopita was very bland at this location and almost has a sourness like it wasn't very fresh. This was also served cold in the middle. The Greek Salad was another disappointment. The spring mix was obviously bad, with a lot of rotten pieces. At this point, it should have been obvious to our server we did not enjoy our appetizers, since we barely ate them. She came to the table, asked if we were finished and took away our barely eaten appetizers. Our mistake for not walking out then. We ordered a Chicken Combo, Salmon, and a Gyro. The chicken was raw this time. I see this is a common occurrence for this location. When we brought it to our servers attention all she could say was, \"Well, what do you want me to do about it?\" We were in shock, she didn't seem to even care we were served raw chicken. We asked for her to do a re-fire, which was a mistake. Apparently the kitchen staff wants to retaliate on customers who send food back. The chicken was cooked this time, but it was as if they add a cup of salt on top on my food. The salt almost made me choke. The salmon was mediocre at best, way overcooked. The gyro meat was still frozen. The meat was not even warm, how did they send this out to be served? Seriously PJ? We finally asked to speak with the manager. I believe her name was Christine or Christina, now I can see why the staff is so unprofessional. She wasn't apologetic to any extent. She became defensive as we described the cold dishes. When we brought up the raw chicken, she exclaimed, \"We would never serve raw chicken to our customers!\" Totally blown away by the treatment of everyone, especially the general manager. She treated us as if we were just looking for something free. She finally offered to take off the chicken combo, and laughed as if it was a joke. Completely appalled at this Pita Jungle, I have even reconsidered ever stepping foot into another PJ. This has left a very very bad taste in my mouth. You should find professional management, who don't argue with customers and laugh in their faces."}
{"text":"For the first time ever, I have decided to aware 5 stars. I guess its the euphoria of enjoying Pita Jungle, then again maybe its the opportunity to go to three different Pita Jungle's and still get the same great service.  I have noticed this location to be wrought with the 20 somethingers and 30 somethingers. I enjoy the chance to kick back, be healthy and have a good time.  Thanks, Pita Jungle!"}
{"text":"Jump on the Pita Jungle bandwagon!!! The food is definitely worth it!! There really isn't much else to say, but the food is great! Oh and the atmosphere is awesome, servers are great and if you are feeling up to it you can eat outside.  Hummus is great and the pitas are well put together.  BTW - Two people can have beverages, appetizers and meals for about 20$....not that I am cheap, but I am a college student. Nice deal in my book!"}
{"text":"Place is disgusting! ! Not sure how the health inspector hasn't shut this place down yet. Very poor management - only eat here if you intend to share your meal with rats and cockroaches. Not a joke, worst restaurant I have ever been in."}
{"text":"Pita Jungle offers a healthier dining experience than most alternatives in a laid back environment. The food quality can vary from location to location I tend to prefer the food at the Val Vista and Williamsfield location. The wait staff is also very friendly and helpful. It is true that if they are busy that you may have to stand and wait for a table. However, that is also a sign of a restaurant that is doing good business and has food worth waiting for."}
{"text":"This is a good restaurant that I try to go to often. This place has some good healthy foods which are perfect for my diet after my workouts. I also like the prices here, since I eat a lot of food from working out all the time I need to be able to buy a lot and my dollar goes pretty far here. Some favorites of mine are the chicken philly and gyro. Give this place a try if you haven't yet."}
{"text":"The shock top is always cold And rice pudding is delicious. The bartenders Matt and Ashley are always friendly. I always stand by my favorite the lavosh shawarma wrap!! One of my go to places for a cold beer!"}
{"text":"Just read the review from 3 days ago. Not only do I know exactly what your talking about but I've had this happen to me 4x and I watch him do it to most of the customers that walk in. I was in there tonight. You basically have to argue with him to be able to sit where you want, even when the whole patio is empty. The funny thing is, he puts you in the absolute worse table possible. It's funny to see which customers will ask for another table and then be unfortunate enough to experience his indifferent and subtlety rude attitude. Worst host ever. He looks kinda like Ray Romano with a tan and his nose is pierced. I would think the owner of this  restaurant would be extremely disappointed to see his patrons experiencing this. Everyone else in that place is fantastic, including the food."}
{"text":"Wow!  I was really surprised!  My coworked asked me to join him at Pita Jungle and I was assuming a place similar to a Pita Pit.  Instead what I got was a full-menu, some great offerings, and not one disappointing order!  I got: Hummus - one of the best plates of hummus I have ever had Dolmades - smaller than I am accustomed to, but they were almost meaty in consistency and taste, though it was vegetarian. Tabbouleh - spooned helping after helping into my falafel pita, wonderful, crisp, just enough vinegar, refreshing Falafel - freshly fried, hearty-tasting, I was fulfilled until the next morning  Highly recommended for a long lunch or a shorter dinner.  This place is great!"}
{"text":"Every place that serves or sells hummus manages to provide a vastly different taste - some are good, some are very good, and some are not edible.  Pita Jungle manages to consistently create quite good hummus, and they do it with multiple flavors.  I have simple tastes and am a creature of habit so I usually order their hummus and chicken.  Not only is their hummus good, but few places that I have been to create chicken that is as flavorful so it's hard to pass that up when I go to Pita Jungle.    Some other great options are the California Beach Club (I sub the turkey for their fantastic chicken), and pretty much all of their pizzas or lavosh crisps.  And in the same vein, when I go for the lavosh pizza I tend to order their chicken glazed lavosh pizza.  For those of you who didn't notice any pattern, chicken is a solid way to go."}
{"text":"Another great experience there. Alexis had a nice inviting personality and really made us feel at home. The Philly steak pita is the tits and the cilantro jalapeno hummus can't be beat. I still go about every other week or more and consider Pita Jungle to be one of the tops in Tukee."}
{"text":"We ventured out for a bite and decided on Pita Jungle. We were greeted very nicely by the hostess.  There were quite a few open tables inside and outside, but the wait was 15-20 minutes...?  We asked to be seated outside and were taken right away.  For a party of five (three adults and two children) we had plenty of room on the patio.  Our server was nice and made a suggestion or two.  We opted for drinks and appetizers, we wanted to catch RA for sushi.  Our choice of appetizers were delicious, the tri-flavor hummus plate, falafel platter and mozzarella tomato and basil plate.    We had an odd feeling throughout our meal and couldn't place what it was.  Then right before we left we realized there wasn't any music outside!?!  Overall we had a nice experience and would recommend trying their great items."}
{"text":"The chicken had no flavoring, it basically tasted like bland boiled chicken. Definitely not even close to being an mediterranean food which has distinct taste and flavor. Their food looks mediterranean but tastes like sawdust."}
{"text":"Still one of my favorite restaurants.  However, getting tired of the BS of Sunday's and making people wait 20-30 minutes for a seat at 1 pm while the dining areas are 50% empty.  If anyone is listening from Pita, maybe hire or schedule more staff???  Anyway, went to Ra instead of the wait.  Have a movie to catch."}
{"text":"Of the few times I've chosen to eat here, I've always been undecided on what I want. Honestly because the menu never had anything on it that stood out to me. Or so I thought. Now I automatically know what I'm getting every time- the chicken tiki masala! Still, it hasn't gotten old. Though it doesn't match the names plate over at India Oven, it is still on point, here it jus feels healthier and lighter. The portion is very plentiful too.     As for service, very attentive yet not to bothersome, I've mostly been there with large groups and the server handles it well. And any place that offers to go drinks is always a plus for me."}
{"text":"I may be new to Yelp, but I have been a huge fan of Pita Jungle for years!   I have dined at many locations including Scottsdale, Phoenix and Tempe locations.    I love the cozy wine bar atmosphere!  My only wish is that there would be a sit down location in Old Town!    I love the hummus, you can order ask for the humus trio - well worth it.  By far my favorite is the Glazed-Chicken Lavosh Pizza!  I get it with extra chicken!  The best!  I am also a huge fan of the Grilled Vegetable Salad.  You can't go wrong with anything on the menu!    I eat in or pick up Pita Jungle at least once a week!  The portions are great and for dine in they have a great wine selection!   What can I say Pita you're awesome!"}

{"text":"First time here. Ordered the chicken philly pita. It came  quickly, but was terrible. The chicken may as well have been shoe leather. I complained to the waitress and got a response or \"really? That's too bad\" no effort to make it better   I won't be back."}
{"text":"First, how to you determine who actually works here?  If she wasn't standing behind the hostess stand, I would have never guessed that she was an employee.  Our sever didn't look like someone that should be working with food, but maybe at a thrift store.  Second, my friends meal was messed up 3 times!  Good lord, it's chicken!  My friend visits the Pita Jungles in Tempe, Mesa and Chandler on a regular basis and gets the same meal. The chicken that was prepared at this location was NOT prepared as it is in the other 3 locations.  Then the manager came over and argued with her about how the chicken is supposed to be prepared according to Pita Jungle \"training\" and obviously the other 3 locations are doing it wrong blah blah blah.  Really?  The other 3 locations are all doing it wrong? What happened to \"the customer is always right\"?  How about instead of arguing about it, just get her the chicken the way she wants it. Cripes.  Third, an employee (I figured this out after, again, you can't tell who actually works here)  walked behind my friend and as he was walking, bent over and sneezed over her shoulder/back.  She FELT the sneeze on her!  EWWW.  I saw the horror on her face and watched as this guy went to the kitchen window, grab a fork and take it to another table of diners. So he was an employee.   Yikes.  My friend did get her meal comped.  But it was such a terrible experience we will never be back.  This location needs some serious customer service training, including the manager.  And maybe name tags or something to alert you to who works here and who doesn't."}
{"text":"I would like to comment on a recent review regarding Dee Dee and this Pita Jungle location. I was also there on 4/23 and I had a completely different experience. I was greeted in a way anyone would expect when entering an eatery. While the bar was quite busy I personally was attended to and my order was taken and delivered in a very timely manner. I believe Dee Dee did a fantastic job and I would not hesitate to return or recommend this location to my friends.   I for one would like to personally thank Dee Dee for delivering the great service we have come accustomed to when visiting this location."}
{"text":"I would leave ZERO stars if I could from Saturday night's Tempe AZ location dining experience.   After we were seated we waited 20 minutes for a basic drink order ---- which we put in our food order at the same time given how bad the service was.  Our waitress then IGNORED us for an hour.  I got up and refilled my own drinks for our table, complained to the bar tender after 30 minutes we had NO service, no one cared.................   We were surrounded by tables who were served and paid their bills while our waitress wouldn't even look our way.   Our food order came out an HOUR AND TEN minutes later ---- ............. mashed potatoes were COLD, salmon was COLD............ I asked to speak to the manager who came out did comp our meal but was in TEARS about a cook not showing up and I couldn't even explain to her how HORRIBLE the waitress was at our table ignoring us the entire evening because she just wanted to comp our meal stick her head in the sand .  We were there at 5:45 ----------- and BARELY made it to gamage on-time after this terrible service not getting our food until 7PM -- and it was COLD, the chicken masala was dry, no extra curry like we order.    Not even basic water we ordered --- to top it off I called the next day to be put on hold for 15 minutes, hung up on, called back and had to tell the staff to have the GM call me.    Seriously I don't know what happened to this location but it's gone down hill fast!!!"}
{"text":"We ordered takeout from here and was pleasantly surprised by the quality. Even though it was a little steep for a broiled chicken salad (around $10) that had nothing more than chicken, onions, tomatoes and lettuce (and dressing of course), it was satisfying and more importantly kept me on my diet. I also tried a bit of the pita with the chicken and hummus dip. The hummus was excellent but for a place called pita jungle I really was hoping for fresh made pita, not the stuff that looked like they pulled off the shelf from a grocery store and heated up til overly chewy. Not terrible, but not great when I know how good pita and hummus can be. The highlight of the meal was definitely the chicken. It was perfectly seasoned and grilled so that it had a nice crust yet was still moist and juicy. The onions on the salad were surprisingly mild, almost like they had been pickled to remove the rawness that red onions have. That really made the salad for me. I would definitely eat here again occasionally but not too often considering the prices."}
{"text":"People will lie to your face. This place is not dog friendly.  I was told that Arizona law does not allow dogs on the restaurant patio by the host.    This is such a lie.  I can't eat here."}
{"text":"Maybe I'm just a fatty...but the portions are too small. Seriously, 3 pieces of bread with the hummus side? I thought it was a joke actually. Agreeably priced, but for me I would have to order two meals to suffice. So in that sense it's a rip off. Enjoyable atmosphere, really chill and relaxing. Staffed with a ton of hipster doofuses who are annoying at times, but otherwise helpful and polite. Honestly though, I would rather eat at Haji Baba right down the road for authentic middle eastern food."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place . Love the atmosphere and people there and the food is awesone!"}
{"text":"We ordered the food and it came cold. They replaced it in a timely manner and it was very good. me Very good value for the money. Very noisy."}
{"text":"Great food.  Good service.  Hummus is on point and the Red Curry with Chicken is great too.  Went with a group and had to fight pretty hard to get 8 together."}
{"text":"Soooo good! Love the Thousand Beans, its definitely one of my absolute favs.  Glad this location opened! Service is always great."}
{"text":"My wife and I absolutely love pita jungle. The humus is the best in town and is always fresh. The spicy chicken wrap is one of my favorites, and the prices can't be beat for fresh heathy food. If you haven't tried them your missing out. We give it 5 stars."}
{"text":"Good ideas, but sometimes stumbles on execution. Chicken pita i had had the right ingredients, but chicken was over cooked and tough. The vegetables are cooked just right (still have a crisp). Will try again in hopes to give more stars."}
{"text":"I've been to this Pita Jungle a million times... they are easily my all time number 1 pick for quality and consistency of their food, great value for the money, great atmosphere, and anything else you could think of for a cool, hip place to eat \"not bad for you\" food. The one thing that consistently lacks is the service, I swear it is like they hand out a new hire book that tells their servers to be aloof. BUT WAIT!!! This afternoon, I met the wife for a quick bite and had Nick for a server- the dude is awesome! He's not all up in your bidnez awesome, but laid back awesome. I am so totally thrilled to be able to write about a good service experience here because I really do love this place.   So even on it's worst service day, I would still eat here, but I am stoked to have someone I can ask for when I go next time (probably next week :)  Eat here people!"}
{"text":"The new Pita Jungle Downtown location in the Gold Spot building is pretty sweet. Healthy eats at reasonable prices, wrapped in a hip looking ambiance is money.   As a downtown dweller, I LOVE that they are open on Sunday. Plus they have a fantastic patio in the back with a bar (BAR) so I can bike on over and get my day-drinking on.   Chicken shawarma is my standard fave, hummus is always good. Pitas can be a little dry I've noticed, they need to get on that. Oh, and they serve wood fired pizzas here, haven't tried one yet but from the descriptions on the menu they look pretty yum. Will order one next time and report back for sure!"}
{"text":"They should really change the name of this place..its very misleading..i walked in thinking it was going to be a jungle but it was only pitas"}
{"text":"I recommend going before or after the lunch hour rush and trying anything on the menu,especially the humus. The staff are patient and effective. I was there recently for what turned into a 3 hour lunch with a friend and not once did I feel rushed. Prices are way fair for the huge portions."}
{"text":"Pita Jungle is always delicious! This location is my favorite that I have visited. Very friendly staff and a giant patio! Our waitress Morgen was friendly and did an excellent job, considering how busy it was. Of course, we will be back!"}
{"text":"Have been coming here since it opened.  Food has always been great and have received decent service.  However, yesterday took my father who was in from out of town with my daughter and cannot say I have ever received worse service.  The hostess seated us at a table near the front.  I asked politely if we could sit in a booth.  She seemed annoyed and said, \"then sit where you want.  I'll just follow you.\"  I tried to ignore the hint sarcasm.  After all, I realize asking to be seated somewhere else might mess things up.  Turns out she was our waitress.  Ugh!  The entire time she was very quick and short with us but the place was only 20 percent full.  When we placed our order, she immediately rushed away leaving us to wonder if she got correct.  Then called her back so that my father could ask what the soup of the day was.  She listed off very quickly all of the soups and he said he would have that one.  Then she rushes off again before he could clarify.  Once again, we were staring at each other asking which one did she think he meant.  We called for her back and he said, no, he had wanted a different one.  Before he could say another word, she rushed off once again.  We all called out for her to come back so we could finish asking for our order.  She comes back halfway to our table saying, \"I needed to tell them (the guys in the kitchen) to stop before they pour it or it will be 'wasted'.\" Hmmm, well if you would spend a little more time with us when we are ordering, maybe you would have gotten it correct?  Dare I even say, you could have spent more than a half a second with us and even recommended a soup.  But that would be too much to ask for someone that clearly either hated waiting on us or just being there in general.  Either way, I've never felt more unwelcome, unwanted and unappreciated.  And this is coming from someone who always appreciates those that work in the service industry.  Sorry Pita, but you have lost my business."}
{"text":"Pita Jungle is the McDonald's of middle eastern food. If you want the real, yummy deal walk your poseur ass across the street over to Cafe Instanbul.   Not that I'm biased...it's just that two stars means literally \"I've had better\" and I have. Better hummus, better garlic dip, better recipes, better service and at least a buck or two cheaper for better prices as well. Not that there's anything fundamentally wrong with Pita Jungle but I'd rather have middle eastern food made and served by middle easterners. Call me crazy but they just might actually know what they're doing and how to pronounce the dish without all the hipster attitude."}
{"text":"This place is always hit or miss but every time I order hummus the server thumbs up the pitas. His big dirty thumb right on top of all the pita breads. You see the guy coming in and out of the front door a hundred times an hour thats ben touched by every person in the restaurant. Just seems like a good way to cross contaminate the food during flu season... Is it me or does the salad always have slimy greens and crappy tomatoes. Suggestion tell your servers to keep their dirty paws out of my food..."}
{"text":"I have been a huge fan of Pita Jungle for years! The food is nothing short of amazing and hits the spot every time. When I'm in the mood for something light their salads never disappoint. When I wanted to load up before my marathon it was the chicken combo platter for me! I stand my ground when I say that nothing on this menu isn't delicious.   When I moved to downtown I was ecstatic that a Pita Jungle was right down the street. It is conveniently located, with a parking garage for its customers. The reason for only 4 stars is because I have sat on the patio several times (taking advantage of the beautiful fall weather) and every time the service has been less than desirable. Inside, there are no problems but for some reason it's always slow when seated outside. Which is unfortunate because it's such a nice patio! Even so, it doesn't stop me from visiting this location after work for some Tapas, or on the weekends for a lovely brunch!  Excellent, Excellent, Excellent!"}
{"text":"Tasty place. Our server was super nice without being intrusive. A bit loud (due to a small child with his video games at a very close table) but not so that I couldn't hear my companion. Nice selection of food-- I'm not used to seeing so many vegetarian options, so I was well pleased. I had about a billion glasses of iced tea (our server kept swooping into refill my glass) and a delicious pesto pizza that I'd happily order again. I'm looking forward to going back and trying more options."}
{"text":"Pita Jungle is a regular of mine.  I am there once a week usually.  Once in awhile I'll have a screw up with my pick up order but when dining in I always get great service.  My favorite location is Desert Ridge.  Thanks Pita Jungle for always having great and healthy food!"}
{"text":"First time at PJ. I've had several of my friends mention them. The ambience was great, waiter very nice. I had the Mediterranean platter and it was really good. My wife had the Shawarma Chicken sandwich.  I hate to say it, but their Shawarma Chicken doesn't even compare to  Pita Da Vita's SC sandwich. I recommend the Med Platter, but for the BEST chicken shawarma, NO ONE has been able to beat Pita Da Vita for us."}
{"text":"I am a vegetarian and I enjoyed the food. For starter's I had some pita bread with creamy cucumber yoghurt. For main course I had Mediterranean platter for which they gave some pita bread, 2 kinds  of hummus, vegi's  and some vegi Kabob ( which was delicious) and also yoghurt. The Desert was the best - the Baklawa. The ambiance is also great and so is the cost:-)"}
{"text":"Very nice meal. It's a nice change of pace. The food is wonderfully flavored with a unique creativity. The atmosphere is casual with a classy environment. Service is very friendly and the food was delivered very quickly. I can't say enough this experience."}
{"text":"Great place for some quality food! Environment is clean, not so loud and great for dates. Been here at least 8 times and I can say 7/8 have been a good time overall!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying giving this Pita Jungle location 1 star is generous. When I first heard that this location was opening, I was excited! Not many places around here have healthy, fast, & good food! I decided to take some of my girlfriends out for dinner one night and thought I would try out the newer location on Ray Rd (I live downtown and ALWAYS go to that location) We walked in the door around 6:00 on a Tuesday night, we were immediately ignored by a couple of young girls hosting while talking to some other co-workers. We stood at the front door for 4 minutes before being greeted (I am a server myself so I notice little things like that). When the host came up to us, she barley said anything to us, asked how many and sat us at a table directly infront of the kitchen next to the takeout stand. She put the menus down on the table and left. 8 minutes go by and no server has greeted our table yet, we were about to leave. Right as we were getting up, our server, Halley came by and greeted us and apologized for the wait and explained that she was dealing with a messed up ticket for another customer. As I said before, I am a server myself, so I understand these things. The place was pretty busy and we got to ordering our drinks, it took her 10 minutes to bring us our margaritas! We tried not to get very rude with her, so we then ordered our apps, we chose the Chicken & Hummus as well as the chicken combo. The chicken and hummus came out wrong, we ordered regular hummus and we got the green hummus. Also, the chicken was extremely cold. The chicken combo was cold but we ate it because we were afraid to order anything else and have it be cold too. We just were going to leave and take our money elsewhere. Needles to say, our experience at Pita Jungle will be un-forgettable.... but the icing on the cake to our dining experience was walking by the kitchen to the bathroom and hearing the conversations in the kitchen. I stopped and acted like I was watching the flow of the kitchen, but I was really interested in hearing the big red headed kitchen manager screaming at her employees. I don't know if it was a joke or not, but her employees looked de-motivated.... I wouldn't blame them.  Some other locations to check out: Downtown Phoenix, Arcadia, Tempe & Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Love the mahi mahi entree. The combo hummus (red and green) is amazing too. The Ahwatukee location is clean and fast!"}
{"text":"Excellent healthy fresh food, lovely presentation. Large portions. Friendly service. Good value. Nice wine and beer selection. Would definitely return."}
{"text":"I don't get it? This place is always packed and the food is only ok. Maybe its the fact that the price is reasonable but as far as quality and authenticity, I would go elsewhere"}
{"text":"Originally I went here  as so many people here commented on how great the food was- so my expectations were high. However, when i got there, I thought the food was just ok. Nothing special. The portions are huge and I think the food is average. Overall its not a bad deal as prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"I can tell it's under new management. So improved from past visits.  I was there on lunch Thursday and the Turkey Pesto Wrap was delicious."}
{"text":"I love this place! Healthy food, nice/happy/friendly staff, great bar, and the food always comes out super fast. Great atmosphere. Love the ever changing artwork. New favorite hangout!"}
{"text":"I have been to two pita jungle locations. This one is probably the worse of the two. I have eaten in this establishment, ordered online, called for a to go orders, and ordered to go at the location itself. First I will start with the food.   Food: I actually really like the food at Pita Jungle. Granted, I have only had 3 or so items off of the menu. The entree I get the most often is the Hummus and Tabbouleh salad with pita. I love their hummus. It is so creamy with the right amount of flavor. I always get a large order so I can have some for lunch the next day. The tabbouleh is ok. I have not had any other tabbouleh salad to compare it to, but usually I have to add my own flavorings because its pretty bland. Its parsley with cracked wheat, some tomatoes and onions. I usually squeeze some lemon juice on it, and then add the garlic and oil from my garlic mushrooms that I order (which I love. Garlic and mushrooms. Honestly, what's not to love?) as well to give it some extra flavor. If they did that on their own it would be great. Its also pretty watery so I have had to ask for it on the side, or extra dry. But this should be done automatically, because who wants watery tabbouleh sitting on top of hummus, which then also gets watery? Nobody! I have also had the falafel pita, which is ok. Sometimes the falafel balls have been really good, other times overcooked and almost burned. Its hit or miss. I have also had the 1000 beans. Pretty good. I have had the trio of hummus before but I prefer the original flavor. The roasted red pepper just didn't taste very good, and the jalapeno wasn't spicy at all.   Eating in the restaurant: We have had a few different waiters. Usually when we have the guys they are more friendly. But the women that work here are rude and cold. We haven't had a problem with any of our food eating in the restaurant. But we have had to wait for long periods of time for our waiters to come around once in awhile. Even when it is not busy in here. Everyone here is apparently allowed to dress as they please. Last night I was in here and some girls bra was hanging out of her shirt. I am sorry, but nobody wants to see that when they are eating dinner. No matter how cute you think you look. Its trashy. They seriously need some sort of dress code in these places, even if its just jeans and a t-shirt that covers your boobs.   Ordering online: There have been problems with this to the point I don't do it anymore. Some items they offer in the restaurant are missing from the options to choose from online. I have ordered online, gone to the store to pick up, and my order was missing. Then the girl who takes to go orders, called every single other pita jungle location in Arizona to find my order. Seriously? Just place a new order. There have also been times where I order something, and it didn't show up on my order, so I end up waiting around an extra 10 minutes because they have to make it after all of my other food has already been finished. I would say skip ordering online.   Call in orders and ordering at the restaurant: The girl who is in charge of to go orders is extremely rude and snobby. She never says hello when we walk into the store. Just stares at us until we order. Uncomfortable. And then when we do order, she seems like its such a labor intensive job when we order 4 things. Get a grip girl. I have also ordered my tabbouleh on the side before and then I never got it, even though I paid for it. I didn't realize this until I was at home already and was pissed but not enough to go back and let my food get cold over a salad. I also have paid for pitas I have not received. Just make sure if you order to go, check your bag of food before you leave to make sure you have gotten everything you have paid for. They must tie their bags in a knot for this reason, they want to gip you and not have you check. I learned my lesson. I check every time now.   I like the food (hummus) enough at Pita Jungle to keep coming back, but I should probably look for a more friendly location to frequent. This one just doesn't vibe well with me. So I will give this place 2 stars for the food. But 0 stars for everything else."}
{"text":"The SERVICE at this Pita Jungle is HORRIBLE!! Drive the extra 5 minutes to the one at Desert Ridge!   It was a beautiful day in Phoenix to go have a nice lunch on a patio somewhere. We arrived at Pita Jungle at 2:30pm and left at 4:00pm. You think 11/2 isn't too long, well it's not to bad if you actually ate. We ordered the large hummus trio which did come out right away, although after that we waited 25 minutes for the waitress to come take our order. We ordered 2 salmon salads and a grilled veg salad. I actually had to waive different waitress down to refill our glasses after they were empty for a good 15 minutes. About 45 minutes after ordering our waitress finally comes to our table to tell us it's going to be another 20 minutes because they forgot about the salmons and burnt them. We had been there 1 1/2 by now and had enough of this horrible service! The waitress was happy to cancel the order and make sure to charge us for the hummus that we had, which when we got the bill she even charged us for 2 extra pita's that we didn't order. So long story short...we just spent $20 for horrible service, hummus and 2 ice tea's and no lunch!! I love Pita Jungle, but this isn't the first time I've had bad service at this location, but it will be the last."}
{"text":"Food and service is consistently always great! If you go for lunch, go early because it fills up by 12 because it is so popular! Try their tropical tea. It is awesome!"}
{"text":"Love the chicken with hummus.  My husband and I are regulars.  Please keep the curry chicken salad with rice on the menu!"}
{"text":"My husband and I literally just walked out of this nasty place!  If I could give this place zero stars for the service I would! We walk in and the hostess couldn't be bothered because she was conversing with her friends at the table next to the hostess station. She then seats us at the dirtiest table that had lettuce stuck all over it and the previous diners information and tip still sitting at the table. She then walks away, doesn't offer to clean the table to go keep conversing with her friends. Waiter comes over, offers to clean the table, but then I guess forgets and sets our clean silverware on the dirty table! Gross! Won't ever be coming back here!"}
{"text":"I think their food is great, but I cannot give them a higher rating.  Their service is horrible.  My service has been CONSISTENTLY bad every time I go there for dinner.  I have been seated many times and had to wait 10-15 minutes for anyone to acknowledge me.  Trying to get a drink refilled is impossible.  It seems like the servers are  more concerned with socializing among themselves, in the back corner by the drink station than they are with the patrons."}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't already written a review of this place yet - it's one of my favorites. I've been coming here for years. I've sampled pretty much all their veggie options, and I loved every single one of them. Okay, maybe every single one. Not the the Curried Spinach Potato Pizza. I don't know, it just didn't work for me. But the rest I loved. My favorites: Pesto Pizza, Tuna Melt, Veggie Garden Wrap, Black Bean Burger, Veggie Burger, Macro Platter... well, I'll stop there.  It's true, service can be a little slow when they're busy, but the staff is  always friendly. And I love the ever changing local artwork that covers the walls."}
{"text":"I've been here many times throughout the last good five or so years, and I have been mostly happy with the restaurant. I would honestly probably give 3.5 stars, but I can't. The service is very friendly; however, one time I went and it took over an hour to receive food. That was unusual, though, as they are normally very good about service. Their food is delicious, I would recommend the beef gyro and the broiled chicken pita, both scrumptious! This is great for a casual dinner or lunch."}
{"text":"Garlic roasted potatoes *check* Amazing hummus and baba ganoush *check* Cute waitresses, some of which are babes *check* Inexpensive menu with quality ingredients *check*  There are many Mediterranean restaurants around Tempe that vary in quality and service. Pita Jungle seems to break the mold. There's something for everyone on their menu, be it the Mediterranean Chicken Salad or the Glazed Chicken Lavosh Pizza (both are awesome).   Pita Jungle is located off of Apache Blvd very close to the campus of Arizona State University. While this location is a favorite along the student body, a good mix of locals and students come here. The waitresses are very friendly and especially professional for a restaurant that serve so many college students. Like I mentioned above, many of the waitresses are super cute.  Here is a meal of champions that I personally recommend  1. Start off with the baba ganoush with chicken. This is not on the menu, but hummus with chicken is, so just as for this. You get a large portion of freshly made baba ganoush covered with chopped roasted chicken. This is DELICIOUS.  2. For your main course, order the Lavosh Shawarma Wrap. This is chicken breast with grilled tomatoes and onions with garlic sauce in a crispy pita wrap (lavosh). This comes with a Greek Salad, but they'll be happy to sub the salad for the garlic roasted potatoes for no charge.  3. Finish your meal with the Baklava coupe. This comes with 3 types of ice cream (I remember it comes with pistachio ice cream!), and it comes with pieces of baklava. So delicious. Even if you feel full, once you see this, your stomach will magically make room.  Pita Jungle gets a solid 4 stars from me. For a Tempe restaurant, I would give it an easy 5 stars, but with all things considered equal around Phoenix, I'll give it a solid 4."}
{"text":"Yum! Had the Chicken Avocado (can't recall third word) Tostada. Lunch rush. Our waitress knew we didn't have tons of time, she made recommendations and served us based on our schedule. Lovely service, didn't catch her name."}
{"text":"I love eating at this resturant, the cilantro jalapeno hummus is one of my favorite starters! I usually order a salad with 2x the meat and have plenty for lunch and dinner that night. I just tried one of their featured items for lunch today and it was very tasty- Chicken del carbon.  My only complaint about the Scottsdale location is the waitstaff, they are all plesant but I find them to be slow on service (refilling drinks, clearing plates etc) the Glendale location has a much friendlier outgoing staff. Overall a great place to get healthy yummy food!"}
{"text":"LOVE it and so close to home!  Since Pita Jungle open in Glendale I have been at least once a week (Yes, really!)  The hummus and garlic dip are to die for and on my last trip I tried a Greek Pita-Oh my!  The fruit on the Caribbean salad and the fruit and cheese plate are amazing and the chicken combo plate is so large it's two meals!  The ambiance is slightly different than the other locations but I think that is mostly due to the fact that two sides of the restaurant are glass.  Pita Jungle Glendale still features a revolving collection of art work and you can see the funky style of the other locations in the hand painted chairs and the cool artwork painted in the bathrooms.  The staff is also  extremely friendly."}
{"text":"This is a place I go to when I need some cheering up! Love this food and it's always fun to sit on the patio enjoy good conversation or just read a book while eating some great food.  Pita Jungle is one of my sons favorite places to eat as well."}
{"text":"I have been to pita jungle multiple times and have been to several of their locations. I am only now getting around to writing this review. The three stars is strictly for this particular pita jungle location. The one in Flagstaff and in Ahwatukee are much better in my opinion.   Their food is usually pretty good and they have many options for vegetarians which I always appreciate being the non land animal eater that I am. Tonight I ordered a bowl or the coconut curry soup and the Mediterranean antipasto platter. The soup was luke warm but had good flavor. I have had the platter before and it is consistently good with more than enough food. The service was ok but not overly impressive.   Overall I would recommend the other pita jungle locations over this one."}
{"text":"I'd give Pita Jungle 3.5 stars.  My wife loves this place. I enjoy the food, but not quite as much as she does.  The cost of an entree is very reasonable and you get a pretty large portion of food. I've had the chicken platter both times I've gone. The chicken was excellent, cooked well, tender and seasoned perfectly. I'm not a big fan of the beans you get with the meal, decent but not great.  The hummus and pita bread is very good.   Service has always been very good."}
{"text":"Online ordering + spinach pasta salad with fresh mozzerella = 5 stars"}
{"text":"Been here several times. Never inspired to write a review good or bad until now. Food has always been good but at a higher price with similar quality to other restaurants in the area (Zoe's kitchen, Garbanzo's, etc.).  Service has always been mediocre at best and seems to be getting worse. Went in today, was seated immediately and after waiting 10 minutes for a server, was getting frustrated. When the server finally came they decided to wait on a table that was just seated, ignoring us. Too many good choices in the area for medium grade food with poor service. Won't be back."}
{"text":"If it weren't for the bartender, this place may cease to exist and would get zero stars. I stood at the host stand for approximately 5 minutes (8pm on a thurs) and no one ever came to seat me, let alone greet me! Blessing in disguise really since the gentleman at the bar was the only person working that I could tell. Correction: all the other employees were sitting at the end of the bar doing their side work and sitting on their phones. Which would explain why I wasn't seated.   I did notice the manager walking around (I think was the manager) doing all of nothing. In short, terrible customer service with the exception of the bartender.   Food took forever to come but once it arrived we had no real complaints. Salad was underdressed but overall good as was my GF's meal.   All in all, we were saddened that this location is so poor as the others in the valley I've been to have been outstanding. We love the healthier options PJ provides but sadly the other deficiencies far outweigh our desire to return to this one. If only they could hit the reset button here...."}
{"text":"I have been dying to try Pita Jungle since I have had a handful of friends tell me how good/healthy this place was. Last night, I finally made a stop there for dinner. I had just finished my zumba class & was extremely tired/sweaty so I opted to take our meals to go.  I looked over the menu a bit before giving my order to the sweet girl working the bar. I decided on: a large order of hummus with 2 extra pitas, spinach pasta salad, pita pizza & a small order of the garlic new potatoes. Their hummus is AMAZING!! Their pita bread is yummy & pretty big pieces. The spinach pasta salad was a lot more pasta than spinach but I liked it. The portion was HUGE, could easily feed me for 3 more lunches/dinners. The pita pizza was ok, very tiny! The garlic new potatoes were delish, I loved the seasonings.   Overall, I really liked it here & would love to come back & actually sit down & eat there.The entire dining/bar area & outside patio was PACKED & it was only Monday night. Can't imgaine how busy it gets on a weekend!"}
{"text":"We love the Pita Jungle.  What's not to love.  Excellent food, extremely reasonable cost.  Heavy wine pours.  We go every time we are in town!"}
{"text":"Typical chain restaurant that prides them selfs on being healthy and organic ... More like its a healthier version of McDonalds hahaha ... On a better note it has a great atmosphere inside & out."}
{"text":"Wow! Talk about delicious! So I'm having a Lavosh pizza here at Pita Jungle and it is absolutely amazing. Service has been awesome since the moment I walked through the door, and the environment is just really chill. Definitely found a new lunchtime favorite."}
{"text":"Just tried to do takeout and they forgot my wife salad.  Got home called the restaurant and they said we should have our money back in a week or two.  I live the I'm real sorry again. This place has gone from bad to ridiculous.       70 minutes for a gyro and a tossed grilled chicken salad???  3 screaming kids and we got one of those priceless were really sorry. Don't go here with kids for dinner, and definitely don't go if your looking for efficiency."}
{"text":"If you've lived in that area of Tempe for any length of time, and you havn't been to this spot, I don't know what to say to you. Its Mediterranean/Arabic food with some creative flair, and its as close to a landmark as there is in that town. It has spawned off somewhat of a mini-empire. The Hummus and Glazed Chicken Lavosh Pizza (w/ Sriracha on it!) were staples of my diet when I lived on Apache Blvd, and although the Chicken Schwarma Sandwich isn't quite on par with the Haji Baba (right down the street), its still probably in the top five I've ever had (and I'm from metro Detroit... home to more middle-eastern joints per capita than any city in the USA). I'd give it a five it wasn't so trendy, but hey, I haven't given anybody a five yet."}
{"text":"I'll keep it short and sweet Pita jungle has achieved the rarely seen combination of low prices and quality ingredients. the hummus is some of the best (try the red pepper hummus) dolmades are also some of the better I've found in the valley. Finally, I had great experience with the service.  The staff made an effort to chat us up and make us feel welcome even when we were just getting takeout and they knew there would be no tip. I highly recommend it especially if you enjoy fresh or medeteranian food."}
{"text":"Extensive and varied menu. Large portions of fresh, flavorful food. We've been waiting since March for this awesome location to open! Definitely will be returning often. The hours are convenient as well. Yay!"}
{"text":"Tasty and healthy, what more could you ask for? I have tried several things on their menu and I have always been very satisfied. I especially love the chicken and hummus. The service is always great as well."}
{"text":"So, I had \"Hummus with Grilled Chicken\"  To be honest this is the only thing I have been a fan of. I tried a lot of the items on the menu and this is the only thing I go back for. Normally the Hummus with Grilled Chicken is better this time it was just ok the Chicken didn't taste great and the Hummus was not as flavorful, But not gonna hold that against them. I'll Still Come Back."}
{"text":"Spicy chicken wrap so delicious and you can totally share it it's huge. Love this joint"}
{"text":"While the Tempe Pita Jungle will always be my favorite, I can't help but appreciate the different atmosphere of its sister location in Chandler. The restaurant is large AND offers a bar. During the day, it attracts more of a family atmosphere along with young professionals on their lunch break.  It's more of a hot date spot at night. It does overlook a lake, which makes it a bit romantical.  You'll find all the usual suspects on the menu. Be sure to try the Roasted Pepper Hummus, the Pesto Pizza or the Pita Pizza for some deliciousness.  BIG NEWS: There's a new Pita Jungle opening in Mesa, across from Mesa Community College, in December."}
{"text":"The Tempe Pita Jungle is basically a who's who of the local music scene. When I was dining on my lunch break this afternoon, I counted 10 musicians in the restaurant from Valley bands. It's also the Casey Moore's of restaurants -- meaning you'll probably run into someone you know there 9 times out of 10. And the food is amazing. The hummus is delicious and the Pita Pizza, which is topped with lettuce, hearty tomatoes and feta cheese over a pita, is out of this world. The service can be spotty but it's worth it for the food."}
{"text":"I was worried at first, due to the surrounding area and shops. But the interior was nice and the food was amazing. Even for my standards. Highly recommended A++ Lavosh shawarma wrap was very good"}
{"text":"Went to Pita Jungle on a Friday for lunch with brunch of girlfriends, it was a busy time and whole place was jam packed. Nobody attended to us at the door, we ourselves got the table . We ordered cilantro hummus ,Baba Ganoush with hummus and pita and red quinoa arugula salad with hummus , all three preparations were really delicious . But the beverages were just average, I had a kiwi strawberry green tea and friend had strawberry smoothie. Our attender was sweet but clumsy, one time he spilled some water on my lap while placing the glasses from his tray , the other time he was in such a hurry that he swished my shades on the floor from his hand. Nevertheless for a busy day it's inevitable to wait tables with some glitches . I like Pita Jungle for their preparations, portion size and most importantly price"}
{"text":"My wife and I had dinner here tonight and as usual, it as fantastic.  The only problem was the Tomato Basil Soup ended up being very salty.  So, I sent it back and it ended up being a blessing in disguise because I got to try the Turkish Red Lentil Soup.  What a pleasant surprise that was, if you get the chance I highly recommend Pita Jungle. One of my favorite places in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants for a quick meal. The food tastes amazing and very healthy.  The hummus with tuna, the shawarmas and baklaba for desert are delicious. Also love their cocktails and lemonade."}
{"text":"I go to this location frequently. Always great service and delicious food. The happy hour is great!!"}
{"text":"Always a fan of Pita J.. I like this location since they seem to be very family friendly and still great quality food and funky vibe...with little less of the attitude that comes with some of the other locations. :)"}
{"text":"Oh, man, this place definitely surprised me. I went in as a blank slate,  imagining it to be something like Jamba Juice. No such thing though. This place is a legit, solid restaurant. Light, unassuming, flexible, and subtle is how I'd describe it. The food, service, and interior, and overall experience were all top notch and I can't imagine how they could be improved. Not too hard on the ol' wallet either. All of which adds up to 5 stars in my book. Their desserts looked stupendous and reasonably priced too. In addition to that, the atmosphere, they strike the balance between trendy, classy, and casual so well. And that's the thing I mean when I say flexible; you see families, dates, bar flies, even a kid's birthday and none of it looked out of place or imbalanced the setting in the slightest. Well done, Pita Jungle!"}
{"text":"Still a fan!  This time around I tried the Chicken Hummus Platter. DE-lish!   I phoned in the order with no problems. The chicken had a nice seasoning to it and their  hummus is simply wonderful! I don't know why I didn't try this place out sooner.   The word is that this place \"tastes healthy\" but I think it is perfect! For being a \"healthy\" eatery it sure does have MAS flavor!!!"}
{"text":"I usually love pita jungle. But this location is garbage. I've tried it quite A few times for the past year (like a moron) and have been disappointed every time. I've never Gotten an order correctly done and the chicken is always dry. Wtf. I'm over them."}
{"text":"My wife and I come here with the kids about once a week since they hooked me in with their turkey sandwich.  Always a great experience and they give the kids crayons to keep them busy too!"}
{"text":"Always great service and very nice atmosphere. They have a nice beer and wine selection and I love going for their late night happy hour. My favorites are the shrimp and hummus and for lunch I love the buccaneer and the Thai soup. The hostess today was very friendly and professional:)"}
{"text":"This is by far the BEST restaurant I have ever been to. I am beyond obsessed with this restaurant.   The food is amazing and always exactly how I like it-delicious. A few times I had less than stellar service, but since the food is so good I continue to come back again and again. The prices are pretty reasonable too.   The pitas are so tasty and the pasta salads are to die for. The best part of eating at Pita Jungle is the fact that its healthy and affordable. Anytime I meet someone for lunch or dinner I suggest Pita Jungle because of how impressed I am. Even when I order dessert I don't feel guilty.   They are great for take-out as well. I never have a long wait. It's perfect."}
{"text":"The food at Pita Jungle is really good.  I love everything I have had there.  If you are there in the fall or spring, sitting on the patio overlooking the lake is really nice."}
{"text":"Another fabulous Happy Hour.  They have stupid fantastic Happy Hour prices with everything being $1 to $3 a plate.  I love these little plates that make it like doing  Tapas.  My g/f and I had loads of food to share and a glass of wine each and our bill was under $20!  I absolutely LOVE having Jennifer as my waitress - she is FABULOUS!"}
{"text":"First off let me start by saying I love it here the food is always amazing! But I did only give them 3 out of 5 because the they take forever. I was seated and waited probably fifteen minutes just to get my drink order taken. And then still waited another 5 min to get my drink. This was on a slow day too. That's really the only reason why they got the 3 stars from me. I usually call a head and order now just so I don't have to wait. Besides that you really can't go wrong with whatever you order here. It really is fresh and very tasty. Just be prepared to wait a little while."}
{"text":"We'd been to this location several times in the past, and while it's not \"authentic\" Mediterranean food by any standard, it's still pretty good if you know what you're ordering.  The most recent time, however, changed our minds completely.  Here's a breakdown of the demerits:  1. Surly wait-staff who act like they'd rather be anywhere else than serving your table. 2. Said wait-staff (several people helped the table, and they were all equally bad) gets the order wrong, so two of three plates (pitas, two of the most simple things on the menu) need to be sent back to the kitchen. 3. Even fixed, said dishes tasted \"off,\" with the ingredients seeming to be of poor quality. 4. The other entr√©e, Mahi Mahi, was prepared correctly and tasted okay.  However, there were several bones on the fillet.  Since a whole fish was not ordered, this is a pretty big error. 5. When informed of the bones in the fillet, the wait-staff do not apologize, offer comps, replacements, etc but simply shrug and say \"okay.\"  That's two more strikes than needed, so we won't be coming back, especially to this location."}
{"text":"I have been eating at Pita Jungle for over two years while going back and forth to Arizona from Florida and made sure it it was a sure stop in the area.  I have never had anything but a great meal be it lunch or dinner. Service can vary as with many casual dining restaurants but is generally good to excellent.  sometimes there is a wait because so many people love the place.  I have eaten my way through the menu and no dish disappoints nor, certainly, do portions.  Can be a bit cacaphonous early in the dinner service as there are many kids, but this being Arizona early means it's quiet by 6:30-7:00.  Note that the Scottsdale location is actually in the food court of the Scottsdale Fashion Mall and has a limited menu.  The 4340 E.Indian School store and the others are sit-down dining."}
{"text":"Our server Joshua was amazing! We tried both of his specials, they were fantastic. Great place."}
{"text":"Worst service EVER!!!! Was seated for over 20 minutes before anyone came to our table. Oh and we had to waive someone down, and they proceeded to tell us they weren't our server. When we were finally waited on, the server was just plain rude. I love pita jungles food, but would not recommend going to sit down and eat at the Pita Jungle on Southern and Dobson!!"}
{"text":"The pitas and hummus here are very good here which is why we go here when we do.  Most the time we just go for a snack, since it is very close to us.  As stated by Earl's review the ambiance is a little unwelcoming. We also notice the employee's don't like us to just have pitas and hummus, it seems like we are waisting their time.    The drink selection could be better, they have few beers and those that they do have are only in bottles.  So this would not be a good place for a Happy Hour.    Overall the food is good, employees can be a pain sometimes, and a bad beer selection.  Ill go back when I feel the need for some pitas."}
{"text":"I was very happy to see that a Pita Jungle opened up in Gilbert, I had previously been to the ones in Tempe and Chandler and they are all good just like this one,  The food is very good, the portions just right. Something for everyone, I have not tried everything out yet, but the falafel and chicken shwarma wrap were excellent. Hummus is good, baba ganoosh is OK. I will try to go and try something new each time so I can review those items too later on.  The service is what I  call 'European', meaning, they do their job, they do it speedily and satisfactorily , but if you expect a big smile and every five minute of someone saying \"is everything OK?\" you might be disppointed. They do it, but not overdo it. I personally prefer this myself, but others might not."}
{"text":"Pita Jungle is a local favorite of Tempe, and I would recommend it to someone looking for a Mediterranean fusion restaurant in the area based on its reputation alone.  However, my experiences at Pita Jungle have been far from glowing.  The food I have gotten has been expensive and lacking in flavor, and the service has been slow.  Based on my past experience, I personally won't be visiting Pita Jungle any time soon."}
{"text":"I love going to pita jungle with my family. The staff is so friendly. And the food is awesome and always fresh. Usually don't have to wait for a table. We've been here several times and never been disappointed!"}
{"text":"This place has superb service. I've been there three times and the wait staff is always friendly and personable. The location is cool and the spacious area is bright, and great to eat in.   Unfortunately, the times I've been there, the food wasn't so good. The dolmades I had were mushy and too sour. The pasta salad was incredibly bland. The gambas con ajo was better, but not at all special. The mozzarella, tomato and basil wasn't too good, either. The mozzarella tasted old...  The atmosphere is friendly enough that you can go and have a drink and get a quick bite, as long as you stick with the hummus..."}
{"text":"My wife and I tried out Pita Jungle for the first time the other night and the food was great! Unfortunately, they brought out a completely different dish then what my wife ordered. I ended up finishing my meal before they brought out the correct meal she ordered. The waitress was very apologetic and nice though. The only reason I gave three stars was bc of the meal mishap. Aside from that the food was great! The place was a tad but on the noisy side too.  I ordered a Philly Chicken Pita and my wife ordered the Jalape√±o Cilantro Lime Hummus salad with Chicken. The portion sizes were great and both meals tasted good!   We will definitely come back for the food. Surely the meal mishap was just a one time thing."}
{"text":"They no longer allow dogs on the Patio. Uncle Bear's next door does."}
{"text":"Went to Pita Jungle last night and once again enjoyed our meal.  The quality of the food is always good and the service stellar. We have been many times and are never disappointed."}
{"text":"Love Pita Jungle. They are on DoorDash too, so if you don't want to hassle with driving and eating there or picking up you can have it delivered. The hummus with chicken and the glazed chicken lavosh pizza are the best!!!"}
{"text":"Is 11 minutes and 32 seconds an acceptable time to sit on hold? I tried to order so I could pick it up and take home.  They still had me on hold when I pulled up.  I showed the guy at the order/pickup window.  He apologized and promptly asked what I wanted to order.  I'm not one of those people that looks for anything I can come up with in order to get a discount or free food.  However, an offer to provide one of those for my wait would of been a nice offer.  This is my first time and depending on how the food tastes, may be my last."}
{"text":"First time here and won't be my last after the lunch I had while watching a little golf. Turkey burger was awesome and the bartenders were so nice. My new favorite lunch place."}
{"text":"Fantasy drafts over, season yet to begin; What better way to transition Than this fabulous pita inn.  Ok, it's a Jungle, but I wanted to make it rhyme. Never mind.....  Pita Jungle is A+ in three regards: price, quality of food and service.  The latter is no small datapoint.  I love to go to restaurants where the service staff makes each of its customers feel like the most important person in the world.  PJ excels in this regard (thank you Jessica and Tom).  If my fantasy teams are half as good as PJ, I might have a winning year for a change."}
{"text":"Great food, super healthy.  You can sit on the patio with younger kids and they are entertained by the lake and ducks."}
{"text":"I love Pita Jungle! The hummus is so good, and their chicken pasta salad is the absolute best!"}
{"text":"Food is mediocre the restaurant server didn't seem like she wanted to talk to us at all she tried to be nice but we could tell right off the beginning that she just did not give a care about us later during our dinner we encounter a slight situation where the roof started leaking on my sister the waitress laughed and said can I offer you a towel later the manager came by and all he did was put an empty bucket next to our table while we wore still eating and just walked away did not apologize could of cared less."}
{"text":"I am def going to miss this place!  Back when I lived in AZ I went or picked up food from here at least once a week.  The greek salad and broiled chicken salad has the greatest dressing ; not too heavy not too light!  The chicken shwarma wrap is good as well, get extra pickles on the side, they are very tangy and have a different flavor to them.  The trio hummus for an app. is always a good bet and their local organic wines are quite flavorful!"}
{"text":"Just had lunch here. I have never had a bad experience at Pita Jungle. I love the food and the portions are way generous for their prices. It was super crowded here today but our server worked his buns off and did a great job. It's very kid friendly with a great kids menu.   Thanks Pita, I love you :)"}
{"text":"By far the best hummus in town. I love so many things on the menu. I love that their website has a section if you have any special dietary needs. Great place for happy hour as well."}
{"text":"If I could've rated with ZERO stars - I would have. TOO MANY options out there to go back to this place. Was there on 6/28.  Isaiah was our waiter. Horrible service. Got the drinks right - but it was downhill from there. Screwed up the appetizer. Finally brought our food order. Took back my order TWICE to get it right...I ordered a sandwich with chicken and got a vegetarian option. Dah! This isn't rocket science guys.  Let me remind you - that you are in the restaurant/service industry...and you're lacking on both counts. People: don't waste your time. Plenty of other Pita Jungle locations, if you're interested in their menu. Otherwise, you would be better making another choice right down the street. There are MANY options.  Oh - and don't get me started on their idea for parking."}
{"text":"I had my lunch there today, it was pretty packed and really noisy . Our waitress was very smiley. I drink smoothies very often and all kinds, I decide to try their special smoothie \"Strawberry & Mango for $5.99\" . Actually I had a hard time to finish it,  first because it was a good size but also because it didn't taste Mango or even a smoothie.. It was more like a  strawberry milkshake. I was able to taste strawberry and ice cream and I gave to try to all the other person at my table and we all had the same answer. Normally a smoothie is fresh or frozen fruits with ice. Not ice cream..  We also order the hummus (they warm up the bread in the microwave so after few minutes the bread is hard),  chicken curry salad  (very tasty) , and some pitas."}
{"text":"I visited Pita for the 1st time today (8/10/2014) at the Gilbert location. Once I arrived to the location for a to go order a female wait staff waited to take the order. I looked over the menu for about 2 minutes. The wait staff seemed to want to hurry the order (not 100% sure). So I placed the 32.00 order at 1:56 pm and was informed that it would be done in 10-15 minutes. I than went back to my car to wait. After 15 minutes I go back in and asked about the order; was informed it was not ready. Went back to the car for about 4 minutes and returned and asked the same female wait staff once she was done with another order (I thought she would see me in front of her and address the order, but no!), so I then asked her about the order and she seemed as if she could not hear me with the look on here face, so I point to my watch and she stated it was not ready and is still cooking and she didn't seemed to really care to interacted with me, so I went back to the car waited about 30 seconds and called and stated can you place the order in the pick up window when it is ready so I can know, she said, \"sure\", and hung up! About 3 minutes later the window opens and she just place the order in the window(2:18 pm = 22 min total) and than closes the window as quick as she opened it. Now I might be looking to hard for something, but I would THINK she would at least wait 10, 20 seconds for me to reach the window and say here is your order have a nice day (something!). I just am taken back a bit. Plus my order for the spicy chicken wrap was just bad and looked a mess! I will be returning that tomorrow! Plus I plan not to ever go back to the Pita location in Gilbert and I MIGHT try another location one more time and if that goes bad I will not spend another cent with this company. I think am going to have some cereal now.   And being in Arizona and being a so-called \"black\" person sometime you don't get the best nor normal service! Was this a race issues? Not sure, but not productive service 100% yes!"}
{"text":"Take out orders are a breeze! Staff is friendly, attentive, and efficient. The food is clean eating. It's easy to have a healthy and delicious meal here. I can't seem to break from my favorite- warm chicken shawarma wrap with a Mediterranean salad and the trio of hummus. The prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why I continue to bother with Pita Jungle. This is a different location, away from the hustle and bustle of downtown Phoenix. I happened to be in the area so I figured \"why not?\" It's the fondness I have for their food - it goes way back to when they were a little indie shop near ASU. Their baba is just one of the most unbelievable things I have ever tried in my life and I always feel like I've had something healthy and good for me, no matter what I get.   When I first walk in, I'm kind of struck by how empty the place is here at high noon. I recall having to fight for space at this place. Not this time. Of course, it is the weekend, so perhaps they do most of their business during the week. Or perhaps people are tiring of the nonexistent service. I am seated quickly, which is as it should be, because the place is EMPTY. There are literally maybe three or four parties in the whole building including the back porch. I count what appears to be about nine employees moving about in various capacities, none of whom look at me. The hostess who seated me vanishes, not so much as bringing me a glass of water. About five minutes later, I get done checking my email and doing everything else I can do on my phone, so I begin to do that thing that you do, you know, look around, try and make eye contact with someone so they will hopefully come over and take your order?  No dice. After several minutes of just trying to eyeball someone into coming over and saying boo, I finally get vocal when two young men come near me and begin busing a nearby table. \"Hey guys...\" I say, fairly timidly. The four women at the table a few feet over all stop and turn and stare at me, but so focused are the young men on their work at hand, they hear nothing. They see nothing. They do nothing. I begin to marvel at the amount of time I have been here since being seated by the now phantom hostess and I begin to play that game in my head which I'm not sure you know or if it has a real name but which I will call the \"how long do you think I could actually sit here before anything happens\" game. It is now that I begin to get miffed. I'm embarrassed by having had to cry out for the attention that I didn't get and it's about now that I actually count the number of employees I can see who are apparently completely unable to see me.  Finally, one of the young men comes back to my area, though still blissfully unaware of me. It was kind of interesting, he was looking around, left and right, right and left, the entire time, I am waving my hand up and down in what I am increasingly certain will be a vain attempt to get him to see me, but he finally does. When he sees me though, he doesn't hustle right over and apologetically ask me if I have been waiting long. No, he gets a sour look on his face and looks around the room again, as if to say \"where the hell did everyone go?\" I understood how he felt. Apparently he was not an authorized employee for my quadrant of the restaurant because, after shifting around uncomfortably looking for someone in earshot who he could call over to send my way he decided that that wasn't possible just at this moment (YOU DON'T SAY) and came over to my table, weakly informing me that he \"could take my drink order.\"  Take my drink order. Not \"good afternoon,\" not \"hey how's it going,\" not \"you were waving your hand like a crazy person you must have been sitting here FOREVER I'm so sorry about that can I get you a complimentary pita bread while I try and hunt down and murder the server who has been criminally ignoring you?\" No, none of this, instead, he could take my drink order. I don't even have a drink order. All I want is water, which used to just magically show up on my table on its own at Pita Jungle. Used to.  \"You know what,\" I say. \"Nevermind.\" I walked right out and drove to Souper Salad. They don't have that mind-blowing baba but they do have tuna skroodle and at least I can serve myself."}
{"text":"One of our favorite lunch spots to eat while in Scottsdale. They have a nice affordable wine list and the Hummus Trio is outstanding."}
{"text":"The food is outstanding. So many flavors my entire mouth lights up whenever I order a meal from Pita Jungle. Love the selection for the kids meals makes me feel comfortable allowing my kids to order anything. Portion sizes are double what I eat and I alway have left overs to take home.  side note; clean bathrooms and great staff."}
{"text":"Their hummus trio is amazing! I have been to several different Pita Jungles and have had similar experiences at all of them. I always love their hummus but am less than impressed with their main dishes. I have had the shawarma before as well as the gyro and both lack flavor. Their smoothies are way too sweet and the flavor tastes less like fruit and more like fruit flavoring. Service is okay but not the greatest. I would go back but only for the hummus."}
{"text":"A few years ago my son was turning 5, I asked him where he wanted to go for his birthday dinner his reply Pita Jungle. So naturally we repeated our visit to Pita Jungle many times. My boy usually gets a special burrito, all the beans, some cheddar cheese wrapped up in 2 pitas, simple and delicious. Last night we had went out on an adventure and remembered there is a pita jungle on ray we have never been to. We called in our order, we were on our way out of town. I asked for chicken and hummus, that was great. My boy wanted his burrito. I told the girl on the phone, she sounded really put out by all of this and insisted that we get a bowl of beans and cheese and a pita on the side, I thought while traveling this is highly inconvenient for me but what ever, I'd rather comply that get my poor boys food spit on. So we show up after 20 min. of our call, it was ready. However we did get to stand there like idiots for 4 minutes... The damn bill was $5 more than usual, they put salsa on his bean bowl and rice and all of this other stuff he didn't want. I raised my son right, you eat it anyways, but he was disappointed, especially cause it's his all time favorite restaurant. I had to pay more to be rude to, and not get what I want, awesome! (sarcasm) Every other Pita Jungle worth my time, I guess the fancier the neighborhood the worse it is. To make things even better I saw 7 tickets that were ready, getting cold the cooks getting irritated and no one was running anything out. I know my business and this was poor. To make it all the better it wasn't even close to busy lots of open seating, and most of the customers looked hungry. Perhaps new staff is in order, something, I'm not asking for the world to cater to my feet, what I'm asking for all around when I choose to go in somewhere and spend my hard earned money and support other businesses is simply respect. And well I got none, and they made sure to hand me the percentage rate to tip. I left $2, more than I should of ever but hey what can I say, I didn't know it was all so bad."}
{"text":"When I lived in the west valley I would go to the Pita Jungle in Peoria every chance I had, it's a 5-star all time favorite place. When I moved to Tempe I was really excited to be by a Pita Jungle. The food is awesome and has great options for everyone including vegetarians and children. The atmosphere is really cool although the small parking lot is ridiculous to get into/find a space. The food is five star-but the service I've had at this particular location has honestly.....sucked. I've been to this location twice and even though I love Pita Jungle, I don't really plan on going back to often and haven't in quite some time unless it's a different location."}
{"text":"Pita Jungle in Gilbert has been our go-to lunch spot in the area for the last couple of years. It's always packed whenever we go, and the laidback hipster servers are always friendly, on point, and attentive in their own ways. Their menu has a wide range of mediterranean and some middle eastern healthy dishes, and I don't think we've ever had something we don't like. Today we had the mahi mahi with pita chips and some type of healthy veggie-pizza on a flat bread (?). Both were excellent. We'll continue to go as long as it keeps rockin. I'm surprised there are only a few locations in the valley."}
{"text":"I've been to other Pita Jungle locations before and have enjoyed both my food and the service. Today, my food was again great, but the service was absolutely awful.   My friend and I had a limited amount of time. We weren't in a crazy rush, but we were hoping to be finished in less than an hour. We were seated outside and then waited 15 minutes for any service (note: it was not busy). The only reason we received service at that time was because my friend GOT UP AND ASKED someone to come to our table. The waiter who took our drink order was not our actual waiter (as we found out later). Our actual waiter showed up after another ten minutes to take our order.  It took an additional 30 minutes to get our food to us - we ordered the tapas Hummus Trio and Dolmades. (Really? Did it require 30 minutes? Oh well.) Once the food made it to our table, it tasted delicious.  At one point, our waiter (one of the three times he actually came to our table) asked us if we were in a hurry, and then, why we were in such a hurry. A) that's none of your business and B) we wanted to be in-and-out in an hour - that's not asking for much!  In all, it took us an hour and fifteen minutes to eat two tapas appetizers, and it was all due to the poor wait service we experienced.  I hate to just rant about our poor service, but it was just terrible! Especially when I know that Pita Jungle is capable of soooo much better! I'm going to avoid this location from now on."}
{"text":"9/3   Follow up to message below.    Thank you Bettina (Pita Jungle Business Manager) for your reply.   It is always nice when a business takes the time to read reviews about their establishments.  Would you please let me know if the \"substitution policy\" has indeed changed for children's menu?   What steps are taken to ensure foods are fresh?   Mold on pita bread would seem to indicate bread is not fresh.  I noticed that many posts over the past several weeks seem to be of a similar nature and while each have been responded to; your response to each seems much the same.    How often do you visit each restaurant or have \"mystery diners\" frequent the restaurant?   Perhaps this would help you identify more quickly problem areas.   Thank you.    9/2  I have been to this Pita Jungle several times and usually have a good experience.   Today was different.    My grandson loves the children's options; although he does not like the fruit and always in the past we were able to substitute corn for fruit.  Not today.   We were told there are no more options.   When questioned why the change since corn obviously costs less than fruit, the answer was \"I don't know, you could contact corporate\".   The second problem with today was the pita bread.   I showed our waitress it had several areas of green mold on it and she took it to one of the guys by the kitchen.  We were sitting by the kitchen so I observed him reach into the big bin with pita bread, pulled one out...looked at it, then tossed it in the trash.   Obviously another one with mold.   They brought another pita bread to the table and this was free of mold.  The comment was \"sometimes they come out of the oven that way\".  Now that was something I had never heard before.   One of the managers who knew about the mold issue walked by the table and never even stopped to say something.    Certainly not a great dining experience and not a great customer experience.   Not sure I will return."}
{"text":"The best place! Everything is healthy! The staff is friendly! I never have to worry. Always treated well. Try the chicken dishes. The quality of the meat is fresh as is the fish! I frequent here!"}
{"text":"I guess the food is good, if you actually get your meal.  My family brought me here tonight for my birthday, but it wasn't  much of a celebration. Everyone else got their meal, except me!  We asked our server several times and kept getting excuses...kitchen forgot to make it, kitchen burned it, another server took it for one of their tables. Our table had already been completely cleared and I still hadn't gotten my meal. We just told him to forget it and not bring it.  He obviously took it off the check, but didn't seem too concerned about the issue.  I doubt we'll be going back to this location. Happy Birthday??   Update:  Management was responsive to this incident and immediately contacted us with an apology.  They sent out a $20.00 gift card for us to come up and try again.  Nice to see they felt compelled to try and make it right."}
{"text":"Foods good, service is a miss. They really need to train their staff on being attentive to their tables. If my wife didn't love this place I could easily not go because of service alone.  Some type of uniform would make sense as well since you don't know who works there and who doesn't."}
{"text":"I have always loved this place and the service is always amazing.  This visit was no exception. Kirsten our server was great. She was very welcoming and took great care of us. Thank you Kirsten!"}
{"text":"Pita Jungle is the perfect place to eat when you are on a healthy eating binge. Not only is the environment just relaxing and serene, their food is amazing. Every month or so, they feature a new artist and hang artwork throughout the restaurant that is available to purchase. They serve everything Mediterranean from hummus and pita bread to falafel to bakalova for dessert. Their hummus is amazing and comes in 3 flavors, original, red bell pepper, and cilantro/jalapeno. All three are so good but my personal favorite is the red bell pepper. But if you are indecisive, they do serve both the red bell pepper and cilantro/jalapeno on one plate. I would suggest ordering extra pita bread because they only serve 2 with an order of hummus which is never enough. I also like to order a side of cucumbers to dip into the hummus. Yummy!   I have not tried everything on the menu, but I really do favor the albacore tuna melt, if im in the mood for it, or the four cheese spinach quesadilla. Between those two, I would have to strongly recommend the quesadilla. It is a perfect blend of four different cheeses and spinach. I was, however, upset this time when I found out that they no longer serve it with guacamole. But the tzatziki sauce and pico de gallo were a good substitute. I do suggest that you do steer clear of the albacore tuna salad, I did not really enjoy that much because they put some sort of herb in it that just leaves a bad taste in your mouth.   Overall, Pita Jungle is awesome!"}
{"text":"Can we call it 4.5? Close to home and work, I LOVE Pita Jungle!   No matter what you order (newbie or Mediterranean pro)--it's affordable, plentiful and delicious! I've been for lunch, HH and dinner and I've never been disappointed.   Though I'm an omnivore, the vegetarian antipasto appetizer sampler is my fav and I could eat off this for multiple sittings (if you are there for HH and are going to order vegetarian tapas...you may actually SAVE money by just ordering the sampler app at  about $11).  Lastly, I usually find any main chicken course to be dull and am always skeptical. But the Wood-Fired Chicken is truly delish and I *may* possibly salivate at night for it..."}
{"text":"Gazpacho!! And the Black Bean burger. All through the summer, I make sure to visit often - they make the best gazpacho. As the summer heat ends, not every location still serves the gazpacho, but it was still on the specials downtown last night. Yea!! But for the months when I can't order that, the black bean burger will keep me coming back.   The rest of the family comes for the pizzas and the shawarmas, which are excellent too."}
{"text":"Started my new diet, and looking for a restaurant with more than two salads on the menu to choose from, I saw that Pita Jungle had good reviews.  I really really wanted to love this restaurant, and sadly I did not.  My husband ordered a burger special, with pomegrantes (???).  Sounded weird to me, but it was his choice.  We both agreed, the burger was bland, and had a meatloaf consistancy neither of us cared for.  I ordered the \"wood fired\" salmon salad.  I was dreaming of a great piece of fish, with crispy corners and skin and a nice smoky flavor.  What arrived was a flabby, under seasoned, really fishy tasting piece of salmon on a bed of boring greens.  I didn't even finish it, and I was starving!  Did I mention I am on a diet!?  On a good note we both enjoyed the caprese salad as an appetizer, although a little more basil would improve it."}
{"text":"Pita Jungle is great!  I love their salads - the Mediterranean Chicken Salad is my absolute fave. Their Broiled Chicken Salad is also good if if you're looking for something a little more simple. I frequently order these but have also had their Lavosh Pizza, which is tasty too.  As far as starters go, you can't go to Pita Jungle and not get their hummus and pita. The best hummus flavors are the regular and the cilantro ones. I've also had their Spanakopita (fillo dough with spinach and feta) which is great - but can't be good for you!  I enjoy both dining in or takeout for either lunch or dinner. Keep in mind, eating inside here, it gets pretty loud. If the weather is nice, I would suggest eating on the patio."}
{"text":"I love Pita Jungle. As a vegan, it has a plethora of delicious options that are light, healthy, hugely flavorful, and reasonably priced. The single reason I'm docking a star is because of the awful service I received this previous trip (Friday, Aug 21).   To preface this review, I've been going to Pita J's across the Valley for YEARS. I remember shoving my face with their hummus while studying for college finals, taking first dates there, and so it was a pretty cool milestone to be able to take my newborn and husband there as well. As a fellow restaurant patron, I always try to be hyper-conscientious about ensuring my kid doesn't disturb anyone's meal. The moment my baby's fussing becomes louder than speaking voice and makes noise lasting longer than a sentence, I'm picking her up and heading towards the door. Incidentally, she becomes silent the second I pick her up, but I subsequently walked across the restaurant a few times.   Anyway, our food arrives. I encourage my husband to eat his meal and not wait for me. When I sat back down after heading towards the door, our server comes... and drops off the bill. No asking if we needed anything else, if we wanted dessert, nothing. She then says, \"I'll bring you a to-go box for your food.\" I looked confused at my husband and asked, \"did you ask for the bill?\" He looked surprised and said, \"...no... did you?\" It was hard not to take offense at a server who clearly was trying to push us out the door. It wasn't even like we were holding up a large table during rush hour--the restaurant had few patrons and plenty of open tables. We actually asked her if she wanted us to leave, and she stammered some excuse. If she had been at all friendly to us during the meal, I might try to interpret her gesture as helpful and proactive, but instead it just seemed like a terribly rude gesture from a bad server. We walked out of the restaurant feeling embarrassed, unwelcome, and, for me, still hungry.   I'm hoping this to be a one-off event. I have positive memories of great Pita J service, such as getting 10% off as a \"biker's discount\" when I rode in on my Harley. Normally the staff is wonderful... but this was one bad apple."}
{"text":"Never fails to disappoint.  Every time I go I try and different item, and they are all just as good if not better than the dish I tried before.  Every other place I eat has to live up to Pita Jungle. The staff is wonderful!!"}
{"text":"I am so glad that Pita Jungle moved into my ever so lovely Mesa area.  I say that with just a hint of sarcasm.  I truly am happy about the arrival of a friendly, tasty and healthy dining option to my...my uh .. well Anandita put it so well.  Let's just say West Mesa is a cozy, gun ridden, overhead copter flyin-spotlight shinin', dilapidated, killer cop area.  Hell- even TGI Friday's went out of buiness here.   I have not experienced the other locations, but I love the food.  The staff has always been very friendly and quick.  I have mostly done take out.  My favorites are the Chicken Shawarma, the  jalapeno and cilantro hummus and the lentil soup.  There are many other things I am interested in trying.  The decor is desperate if I have to say anything negative, which I don't, but it is alarmingly sparse, all neutral colors, crooked hanging paintings, poor lighting and bargain sale furniture.  It is surprising because the staff is obviously artistic, as they are quite decorated themselves."}
{"text":"Every time I eat here the service is very good and friendly. The food is prepared to perfection and served fast."}
{"text":"Outstanding. Made me realize , i miss college and eating healthy!!    Its obvious they (at least the nice gal today), care about the success of this restaurant.  Clearly the staff eats the healthy food , as they looked amazing and healthy.  Ill be back for my own good!  I am 40 but felt right at home here. Thank you for brightening a gloomy day."}
{"text":"We eat here often and love it every time.  The food is delicious, affordable and healthy, however, the menu is extensive enough to please anyone.  The service is welcoming, friendly and very accommodating.  Any special request is met with a smile and an eagerness to please.  If you ask for Bai, (Bailey), you are sure to have a totally delightful experience."}
{"text":"My wife and I have had very good lunches, dinners and happy hours at a number of Pita Jungles, but the Desert Ridge location is now becoming one of our favorites. We had a happy hour and lunch within the same week and were very pleased with the consistency, quality, and freshness of the food. Our waiters were very friendly and attentive and the manager conscientious and professional. We highly recommend this location to friends and family alike. Thanks for an enjoyable eating experience."}
{"text":"I have loved Pita Jungle for years. I've spent countless hours attempting to duplicate their Shawarma chicken, lemon dressing and babaganoush at home. I've never quite succeeded and that's always sent me going back because boy do I LOVE these flavors.  This is the first time I've ever gone to a Pita Jungle and thought to myself \"this is a restaurant in decline.\" To be fair it's my first visit to the Roosevelt location - but then again, the hallmark of a good restaurant is consistency. The location is, I think, evidence that Pita Jungle is over-extending itself. Lavish in size and appurtenances, it has that undeniable vibe that says clearly \"THIS AIN'T CHEAP!\" This is in direct contradiction to the previous locations I have visited (Indian School and Apache) which have always tended toward the spartan.   That expense appears to be taking its toll. The \"large\" baba - as delicious as ever - is served stingily, spread out over the plate but less in volume than I've been served before when I ordered a small. It is served studiously with one (1) each: tomato wedge, cucumber slice, kalamata olive. The small Greek salad is nearly half the portion I have gotten at the other locations. I always ordered small because it was more than enough to feed me and large was out of the question. Here it resembles a side salad at Dennys.  All of this smacks of cost savings at the expense of portions and man, that is my definition of a restaurant that is in trouble. Pita Jungle, I love you, But I spent $33 for two people drinking water at lunch only to wish that instead I'd spent my money manufacturing my own inferior versions at home because I walked away hungry. No amount of impressive decor can make up for this. I have been pleased by your success, but now you're over-reaching. I hope it doesn't kill you.  Edit: I upped this to three stars because I kind of felt guilty. At the end of the day the food is still  just as wonderful as it always has been, but the portions were weak and I figured two stars was a bit extreme."}
{"text":"Loved the food but the service was not at all what we expected.  Granted there were 7 people in our party but having to wait over 45 minutes after eating to finally get the bill paid was extremely irritating.  The person serving our table was friendly but not very attentive throughout the entire experience.  I believe she said she was also bartending. Not sure why she was doing double duty as there were plenty of other servers handling the tables around us. We will go back as the food is delicious but not sure if we will continue to go to that location."}
{"text":"My husband and I were visiting Phoenix/Scottsdale and decided to give this restaurant a try.  We liked it so much, we came back to this location once and the one in Tempe another time.  The food is fresh, there are plenty of alternatives for vegans and non-vegans and the service was solid.  I loved the hummus, babaganoush and the veggie burger!"}
{"text":"Always a solid go-to for healthy yummy food that's not ridiculously over priced! The cilantro jalape√±o hummus is the best! Salads are big enough for 2."}
{"text":"The food at Pita Jungle is always good.  I like the garlic potato dip, the lentil fattoush salad, the Greek chicken salad, and the medchilada.  But everything I've ever had here is tasty and fresh.  I just wish there was one closer to me!"}
{"text":"Love that there is such a nice, comfortable place to eat healthy foods. Large portions. Food is fresh. Good service. Indoor and outdoor seating. Particularly nice on weekends where the area is much quieter."}
{"text":"Favorite place to go to lunch. Love the food and the location. Chicken combo platter is delicious!"}
{"text":"What keeps bringing me back here is the tapas during happy hour. You can load up on all the tapas you want for $1 or $2 for each helping. You can easily fill up on just the tapas without ordering a full meal.  I recommend the dolmades and shrimp, they are the best. Throw in a glass of their One Hope wine and you have the makings of a great and cheap meal.  Finally, the staff has been consistently friendly and prompt in their service."}
{"text":"Oh my.... So good!  I was heading to The Painter's Lounge and heard this restaurant was next door.  Very friendly staff, fast service and amazing flavors!  I will be back!!  Huge fan!"}
{"text":"What can I say? BOMB food, BOMB prices, BOMB atmosphere and always STELLAR service!  Personal favorite is the \"Chicken Curry Salad\". For about $10 you get one of the most loaded, satisfying, unique salads I have EVER had. Couple it with a Blue Moon (on tap) and your palate is set for an awesome experience! Try the \"Coconut Curry Soup\" or their \"Gazpacho\" as well because the flavors are on point! Recently I even tried their \"Gyro Plate\" (substituted the pita for brown rice) and still 10/10.   4/5 because for whatever reason, despite it's greatness, the one off of Happy Valley is still better. I can't exactly pinpoint why, but myself and my people all agree that it just is.  But seriously, if you haven't been there, GO NOW!"}
{"text":"Pita Jungle is one of my favorite places to eat.  The food is consistently delicious, the portions generous and the service impeccable.  I appreciate the vegetarian and vegan choices, which can often be lacking in other restaurants. A reliable go-to spot."}
{"text":"Pita Jungle is the best. They have excellent service and they gave us the food regardless of being busy on a Saturday night. I felt super healthy after eating the chicken salad, and I also had some cilantro japapeno hummus from my friend. It was a bit too spicy, but that was my fault. I'll be coming back again!"}
{"text":"Just had a couple drinks & an appetizer but received good service and the snack was good. Decor was nice and atmosphere fine. Nothing to rave about but no real complaints either."}
{"text":"This place was great the first dozen or so times (although their Dobson and Ray location is much better).  The menu gets old after a few times. One crazy experience: My husband and I had a hard time getting drinks, then ordering, then the check.  We could never find our waitress, as she kept disappearing for long periods of time and finally asked the manager to help. When he brought out our food my husbands meal was wrong and the mgr comped us his meal. At the end of the meal, the waitress returned to our table and apologized by letting us know that she was having \"female bathroom issues\". THOSE WERE HER EXACT WORDS! We could've gone without knowing that, but at least she waited until after our meal to give us the rundown."}
{"text":"My GF and I are both fans to this place. Decent restaurant with reasonable price. Service is always great!  We had the Ahi-tuna with 2 kinds of hummus and wood-oven Salmon salad with grilled vegi. Both are great but I like the tuna/hummus plate better. The tuna is just cooked to right and the hummus is full of flavor. The salmon is really nice but the salad missed some grilled vegi than it used to have. Service are 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Love the hummus trio! They used to have a honey pasta salad with grilled veggies on the menu. They have continued to make it for me for years. So yummy! Nice laid back atmosphere with delicious & healthy food."}
{"text":"Worst place for service.  Manager was above clearing tables to seat people. The waitstaff was more into chitchat then serving customers.  Will never be back. My mom was in from out of town and was going out to lunch with her. Will not take clients here either."}
{"text":"Good, healthy choices of typical Mediterranean cuisine.  Great for last-minute, left work late and need to eat, take-out.  The order is usually ready within 15 minutes of the call so it is easy to pop by, pick up and head home.  We order from PJ about twice each month, and the food is consistently good.  I love the 4-cheese spinach quesadilla with chicken, and their lavosh pizzas are excellent.  Their hummus and tzatziki is amazing."}
{"text":"I actually live down the street from the Downtown Pita Jungle, but have had more than one bad experience there. So, I decided to try this new location and Wow, what a difference. Huge space, awesome patio, great service and most importantly, great food. They pay attention to detail here..."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious food.  Everything is so fresh, and literally everything they have is amazing.  Even the candies on the way out rock lol."}
{"text":"I am such a Pita Jungle fan, so this review is hard for me. For some reason, this location always lets me down. The service and quality of food at the Tatum location just doesn't seem up to par with the other locations. I live 5 minutes from this one and would rather drive to the Norterra location. The mahi-mahi is usually my go to dish and it's over cooked every time. I switch to salads and still, just not up to normal Pita standards: bad lettuce, missing ingredients, wrong temperature. Like I said, I love Pita, but I avoid this location."}
{"text":"Best food ever! Cheap, delicious, and fast! Highly recommend!  Chicken shawarma wrap is so good along with the cilantro jalape√±o hummus Kate salad with quinoa! A Phoenix favorite!"}
{"text":"Want fresh, healthy food options in a rush? Then this is definitely your place. On occasion the pita bread might be somewhat hard on the edges I assume from leaving out for long but nothing that the more than accommodating and friendly staff won't fix in a second. The tabbouleh, ratatouille and tzatziki in the antipasto platter were simple spectacular. Feta was super fresh and although I am not necessarily a fan of dolmades the ones they serve could make me change my mind. Good hummus."}
{"text":"Great welcome by staff - Demi, Bill and Cat on a busy Saturday night. Thanks demi for a table near two heaters. Mahi Mahi or salmon. Cilantro-jalapeno hummus - definitely."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite Pita Jungle location. When I arrived, a hostess was there to greet me and my family, and she said it would be about a 20 minute wait, but it ended up being only 10 minutes. After we sat down, a waitress promptly arrived and got our drink order, and the drinks came out within 2 minutes. The food was good, I had the gyro. The only reason I give 4 stars was because the wait for the food was a little long for a sandwich, but they were busy. The food is yummy, the staff is prompt and friendly, and the space has nice ambiance and is clean. I would recommend."}
{"text":"Best hummus ever! We love the jalape√±o hummus, and they'll give you cucumber slices for dipping instead of pita if you want.  I love their falafel, too.  The Lentil Fetoosh (spelling?) is really good, too.  Lots of vegan options. My husband and grandkids love the lavosh pizzas and the pita wraps. The staff is great, and the food is delicious. We bring friends here all the time and they always end up coming back."}
{"text":"This place is so fricking good!  I got the chicken greek salad and it was overflowing with \"Yard bird\"   The lentil soup is excellent. Kind of a Bohemian crowd but really cool.  I will return!"}
{"text":"I've never had a bad meal here. Always fresh, always tasty. Their cilantro jalepeno hummus is out of this world as is their fruit and cheese plate with a side of raspberry dressing."}
{"text":"I'm not happy that they removed REVERSE happy hour :( we found that surprise this week.  Hopefully they can put it back. It was nice to try many delicious tapas. Small portions."}
{"text":"My sister and I decided we both wanted to try this place. We were not disappointed and are both still craving it three days later. The staff was great and super patient with us (we can both be indecisive). We will be back that is for sure!"}
{"text":"What is this place???? It's not a Middle Eastern restraunt that's for sure. My family and I had been shopping at Arrowhead when we were very hungry but our usual Gyro place was closed and so was everything else. If we do eat out, which is rare we go to restraunts and didn't want to go to a fast food place or sit for hours at the other restraunts. (being that it was a school night for my kids) We ordered gyros and the hummus. When our server brought the hummus and we tasted it I believe canned hummus tasted better. Nothing like we are used to, no lemon, garlic, or olive oil.  For four people she brought us 2 pita breads and it wasn't warm.  I've never seen anything like this. Were we supposed to use our utensils???? When our gyros came out it had lettuce, tomatoes and no tzatziki sauce. (my husband mentioned it's on the bottom, WTH!!!!) The second it arrived we all knew this is not a gyro at all, even the look of the meat was sliced incorrectly.We called the server over and asked her if it was fresh and she mentioned it was frozen. FROZEN!! it was soaked in oil and tasted terrible. Should have known when we didn't see the gyro meat spinning anywhere in sight.The drinks were terrible I was so thirsty I just sucked it up. Some sort of Guava lemonade drink. We had our server take back our plates and ordered another plate of hummus because we were hungry and their food and drinks are terrible. I will say our server was very nice. When we get our bill we were charged $1.50 twice for extra pita bread, really!!!! We will NEVER come back here. Maybe you should take the word Pita out of the name."}
{"text":"We live nearby and have been here many times. The food is usually good, but as you can see from the reviews here on Yelp, this location has issues with customer service. Usually the staff is polite, just a little slow.  This was not the case last night on 4/23. We sat down at the bar around 6:45pm. There was a blonde female working the bar. I think her name was DeeDee. She never once acknowledged us. Not even a simple greeting. One of the managers saw us and got our drink order. We continued to sit at the bar for another 10 minutes while being completely ignored by DeeDee.  Eventually some other person (maybe another bartender or waitress?) took our order. She was nice.  To Pita Jungle, I'd like to say that you should carefully pick who you let serve your customers. DeeDee makes it hard for me to want to come back. To DeeDee, I'd like to say that if you don't like people, get out of the customer service industry, or seek help from your peers to learn how to treat people."}
{"text":"They had a lot of options to choose from. I got the chicken shawarma pita which was really good and healthy. The location is ok, in a good neighborhood. The sangria was disappointing, I wouldn't recommend it."}
{"text":"Extremely happy with the quality of food and even happier with the exception customer service. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Regarding the review of the Desert Ridge Pita Jungle posted on 10/23/2015...  I was seated near this couple the entire time they were at the restaurant.  - They never complained about their food to their server.  I think it was unfair for them to not give the staff a chance to address their concerns in-house before posting a negative comment online.  In my own experience, the staff here has always made the effort to resolve food issues promptly.  - The reviewer claimed that the restaurant's manager argued with a worker.  I was seated along the same booth wall that the couple was, facing in the same direction.  I would have seen and/or heard an altercation such as the one they described.  It did not happen.  - The reviewer's characterization of the employees' behavior was invalid.  The employees in question could not be heard by anyone on our side of the restaurant, so there was no way to know if they were gossiping or talking about work.  No one was mocking anybody.  - The photo that accompanies the review shows two employees sitting together eating lunch at one table and another employee sitting alone at an adjacent table.  (The couple's server was the woman you see in the background walking from the kitchen towards the bar)   The couple came in at the end of the lunch rush.  During the time they were eating, most of the other tables in the restaurant emptied out.  That is why there are so many empty tables in the picture.  The employees had finished working the lunch shift and were seated at the tables eating.  There is absolutely nothing wrong with that, and it certainly doesn't warrant a negative comment in a review.  - The reviewer's comparison of this location to the Shea location is nothing new.  I have been a regular customer at the Desert Ridge Pita Jungle since mid-2014, although I've been eating at Pita Jungle restaurants since I was first introduced to them in 2012.  I've eaten at several locations, including Shea.  It is common for Pita Jungle regulars to make comparisons of the different locations, and fans of the Shea location tend to be fairly passionate about it.    As for Pita Jungle Desert Ridge, I like the food, the casual atmosphere, and the friendly staff.  I spend a great deal of time here, reading, writing, and chatting with the employees.  I enjoy the eclectic music, the artwork on the walls, and the ebbs and flows of the dining room.  I think it's a great deal for the price, and I would recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Pita Jungle is so good, my wife and I go every week (weekends). That's saying something since we live in Globe!!!  If you're not in a rush and just want to relax,  I suggest to go from 3-6 for there happy hour/tapas. It's by far the best deal in town. $1-3 a plate. So worth it. My wife gets there house wine for $3. We love sitting outside because of the lake. So nice. Hope to see you there."}
{"text":"A pita place with no lamb? The service was decent but the pitas were not that great. The humus tough was excellent!"}
{"text":"Really not much of a point to throw in another review, seeing  that 4 stars out of 100+ reviews should pretty much seal the deal. So this is just for the benefit of my friends who might be reading..  Probably one of the best restaurants in a strip mall. Ranks right up there with Vietnam Kitchen (L'ville, Ky) as top food destinations that may or may not have a dry cleaners next door. Pita Jungle has everything from pitas to pizza's and with a hipster wait staff to boot.  Their widespread menu and eclectic clientele will definitely make you proud to an American, whatever that means."}
{"text":"I like this place, and everything I have ordered so far.  We've been there about 5 times.  I think two $$ is fair.  It's not a bottom price point kind of place.  It's kid / family friendly.  And so far the are able to accommodate our gluten / dairy allergies perfectly, and we would know if they didn't.  This is now one of our staples when going out for dinner."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I shared the seared tuna and hummus appetizer and it was great! We both had the salmon over the spinach and mashed potatoes for our entrees. I substituted mushrooms for the potatoes. Everything tasted great! Great wait staff and casual atmosphere. I would suggest going early morning when they open or after the lunch rush they get very busy during peak hours."}
{"text":"Slow service, dirty birds all over the patio and average food.  The fish special was $17 and a really small portion."}
{"text":"After waiting for seemingly FOREVER for this location to open, it took me a few weeks to get to actually eat at the downtown Pita Jungle.  It was initially a little confusing.  We rode our bikes from my place downtown, and locked them to a tree on 3rd Ave. side.  Not sure if there are bike racks on the patio side, which seems to be the main entrance.  There must be a parking lot back there, as all things Phoenix seem to revolve around the car.  We entered from the Roosevelt side, and a sign pointed us to a host station across the dining room.  We went in and out a couple of times (bike lights, water bottles, etc.), which seemed to attract a hostess to our side of the building.  We were seated where we could keep an eye on our bikes, which we appreciated.  Our server was upon us before my friend was even seated, offering drinks.  I hadn't even been able to scan the beer/wine menu, so she brought me a water in the meantime.   I was not impressed with the beer selection at all.  It was pretty limited.  I got the salmon dinner, which included wilted spinach and garlic smashed potatoes.  These are three of my favorite things.  They arrived quickly, and were hot.  I was less than pleased that my spinach was served heaped upon my potatoes and topped with the salmon.  I was ok with the spinach and salmon touching, but didn't really dig the spinach juices soaking into my potatoes.  But maybe that's just me.  My friend ordered the spanikopita and said it was ok.  She also got the pita melt, and said that was good.  A couple of other friends who also live downtown rode their bikes up shortly after our entrees arrived.  They got the hummus, and had to request extra pitas, as the two it included were simply not adequate.  He got the falafel.  She got the chicken lavosh.  The turtle cheesecake was delicious.  My friend enjoyed the rice pudding, which is made in-house.  I really dug what the Pita Jungle has done with the physical space.  It's huge and open.  There's a ginormous patio, too.  Not sure about the heating/cooling options outside, as we ate in the dining room area (as opposed to the bar area or the patio).  I LOVE the location.  It's a nice bike ride from my house.  It has a very chill, urban feel.  I hope downtown folks support this latest Pita Jungle venture."}
{"text":"Good food but the worst service on the planet. Only plan on eating here if you have 3 hours to kill and don't expect any apologies for keeps by you waiting. They ran out of plates and ran out of glasses. Unbelievable. I won't be back."}
{"text":"I never knew how to rate this place... I totally dig the food, but the ambience and the service is just plain...well... weird.Most of the time you get stuck sitting in a sea of people. I felt like I was in a high school cafeteria.. I understand it might be a 'hipster' crowd that eats here usually, but do your servers have to look homeless? Do any of them ever smile?Or shave?I have never had a complaint about food consistency or anything, but maybe lower the prices just a little. Hummus is delicious, but not worth THAT much on my bill. I enjoy the falafel and a lot of their pita options. Do you notice I am trying to have the pros outweigh the awkward cons? I'd give it five stars if the prices were a little lower, and the service was more upbeat. That's all."}
{"text":"Went back to give Pita Jungle another try, they really improved. Seems like they've abandoned the futile idea of trying to keep the grilled chicken on the warming table and instead serve it up off the grill like before.  Employees are friendly like always, they're back to the level of quality I came to expect."}
{"text":"I really can't think of a negative at present...so 5 stars it is. Very fast, very good, very healthy. I went for the black bean burger and added jalape√±os. Really rock'n. Beer selection down to 4 taps plus bottles, but they had a few excellent choices. Would definitely come back to try out more of the menu. Beats the pants off the chains holding siege on the area."}
{"text":"To start off I am a loyal Pita Jungle customer!  However, I was very disappointed in my visit this weekend (Saturday Night) to the Pita Jungle in the Arcadia area. I waited forever for a table, which I do not mind waiting but this was a little long for my taste. Also the restaurant looked chaotic, employees running around with no direction and very unorganized. Once I ordered, I once again waiting abnormally long for my food. On a positive note the food was very tasty. I usually enjoy my meals here but this time not so much. Hopefully they get it together because I would like to come back, well maybe to a different location."}
{"text":"Phenomenal service. Christi the tall blonde was extremely helpful and she was constantly on her toes making sure we were taken care of. Very sweet and knowledgeable with the menu and took excellent care of us. Will be recommending her as our waitress again next time."}
{"text":"My husband and I were excited to try a new restaurant so read the great reviews on Pita Jungle and gave it a try a couple of weeks ago.  It was okay.  We are die hard Mediterranean food fans.  We were looking for vegetarian dishes and there are plenty offered which was good to see.  The waitress was very personable and helpful, suggesting many vegetarian dishes.  We started with a hummus sampler for the appetizer, which consisted of original, roasted red pepper and jalepeno cilantro.  All were very tasty; however, we didn't care for their pita bread at all.  It had a grainy texture.  So, that was a bummer because we ordered falafel pitas for our main entree.  The falafels were alright, but again, the pita bread made it a disappointment.  The falafel by itself was moist enough and seasoned well, but we have tasted much better. On a falafel scale, it would be a \"meh\". My husband ordered the beans and rice.  They were just okay, too. Kind of bland. The atmosphere and food are more of a fusion of Mediterranean and some Mexican. The music was a bit loud, hard rock blaring, making it distracting to converse with my husband. If you like fusion-y kind of food with a louder atmosphere then this might be the place for you.  But, if you are a Mediterranean food traditionalist, maybe not. There are much better Mediterranean restaurants."}
{"text":"I have visited several Pita Jungle locations (including this one) and had always had a pleasant experience until today. After receiving rude customer service from the host, our group chose to eat elsewhere.  Our group of 8 moms and babies had planned ahead of time to eat here. Knowing this can be a busy location, especially during lunch, I called ahead twice (once when they opened today and once yesterday). I was told that the host would be given notice of our party but we may have to wait. This is perfectly reasonable in my opinion, especially since our same group has eaten lunch (all together) at this location during the lunch hour.  Upon arriving, however, the host explained their policy was first come, first served and he could not seat our group. I offered several alternatives for him, such as waiting 20 minutes or splitting our group into 2-3 smaller parties. Their host simply told me he could seat a table of 2 and a table of 4 and that was it.  Then we offered to sit outside on their nearly empty patio if they turned on misters and were told that the misters were broken. It's July in Phoenix, Pita Jungle! I would make working misters a priority at your establishment.   After we offered to wait, split our group, and hold our babies on our laps due to their lack of high chairs, their host was unwilling to help us. We decided to eat next door where we had a great experience.   The service here was never been great (like it is at other Pita Jungle locations), but the customer service we received today from their host was appalling. If you are considering eating here, I would go next door to Il Capo where you will have better service and great food.  UPDATE 7/28: I was contacted by Pita Jungle along with another member of our party. We understand this was an unusual situation and to make up for this experience, we were given free catering for our play date today. I want to thank Pita Jungle for correcting this mistake and making us feel like valuable customers."}
{"text":"I went here for dinner tonight and had a horrible experience. Our hummus was grity and tasteless. One of the worst hummus plates ive ever tasted. I think it was old. When i asked the server if should taste so bitter she said \"i don't know\". The manager never came over to check on us or ask us what was wrong. Service was slow but the overall atmosphere was okay. For dinner i had the spicy mango shrimp which was sursprisingly good. My boyfriend had the pita pizza which was very dry. I wouldn't return to this location but i'll try another."}
{"text":"second time enjoying some appetizers here! prompt service, friendly staff-- even though we came in later than usual, i think it was 830pm!! we had the nachos, SO GOOD. i had to ask for extra chips because well, i gotta get all that goodness in my belly! Joe was our server, he was polite and patient as we took our time!"}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of Greek food. I love me some hummus and Pita Jungle has good food but I feel for the price the quantity just doesn't match up. Giving us two pita's (which costs pennies) for a full tray of dips just comes off real stingy.  They do have good food, though."}
{"text":"LOVE the black bean burger.  Ever since I tried theirs, it's my go to item. My husband has tried a few different dishes and has really enjoyed each one. This particular location is our favorite though."}
{"text":"The roasted veggie salad is amazing, especially with the grilled chicken. Don't even need the dressing it comes with, the veggies and their seasonings is all you need. The sample plate- where u get hummus, falafal, pitas, etc is AMAZING. Love it."}
{"text":"Called in a to go order for a quick meal on a Sunday night for my wife and I. Was immediately greeted by one of the staff as I walked in and directed to the take away counter. During my short walk to the counter I found the restaurant to have a nice visual ambience and trendy modern decor with music that might have been just a touch loud. Overall, seems like it would be a decent place to go for a quick meal. The girl who brought my order was friendly and I was in and out very quickly.  As for the food, I ordered the \"One Thousand Bean\" open face pita and my wife ordered the Pesto Lavosh Turkey Wrap. The bean pita had a fairly substantial pita with a layer of brown rice and medley of cooked beans with tomato, cilantro, and red onion as garnish. Overall, the ingredients were all quality and fresh. The bean blend gave it a nice mix of flavors but overall I felt like it was missing some spice and perhaps a little citrus or something to brighten up the flavors. My wife's wrap left similar impressions. The turkey was surprisingly good with a touch of honey sweetness without being overkill like a lot of other deli turkey. It also had a nice pesto and the grilled tomatoes added a nice touch but overall it still seemed a bit plain tasting.  All in all, the food was made with quality ingredients and was good albeit a bit plain. Prices seemed a touch high at first but I think the quality and portions justify it. Will likely go back to try more in the future."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. My clients absolutely love the chicken combo platter. As a sales rep, this is my go-to for catering. Great food, great staff."}
{"text":"+++++  Well I'll be a son of a gun +++++    From Yesterdays experience this location appears to of turned the corner ..... in a good way.  My Wife, Daughter, Grand Daughter and I had an OUTSTANDING food experience along with great service.  I'm now comfortable in saying ...... this Location will meet or beat your expectations."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for a quick lunch this afternoon. Service was OK. Not bad. Not great.   We ordered the Spicy Chicken Wrap and a side of grilled veggies to split. The only good thing about the wrap was how big it was. Definitely glad we decided to split!! That's about the only positive thing I can say about the food here. The wrap was flavorless. No spice whatsoever. I also almost broke some teeth on the crunchy uncooked rice. For sure would not order this again.   But wait....this is was REALLY bothers me about this place. They claim to be \"healthy.\" The grilled veggies we were served were SWIMMING in oil. So much so that they were uneatable. I decided to look up on my phone the nutritional information for this so called \"healthy\" side dish and it was an astounding 450 calories and 41 grams of fat!!! For veggies! Not worth it in my book. If I am going to consume 41 grams of fat its not going to be on cauliflower and broccoli. Sorry Pita Jungle. I am not a fan of your bland unhealthy oily food and I won't be back."}
{"text":"I've been to many middle eastern restaurants, but for my tastes, Pita Jungle has the best hummus.  It is not to thick, not too thin, not too garlicy, not too mild.  Every time I go to Pita Jungle, I resolve to change things up and eat other things, but the hummus is too tempting and I normally get a side of mixed beans to round out the meal.  Sure, the 1,000 beans meal is great, but it is often too much food if I also have hummus."}
{"text":"Definitely good food. Some salads have a lot of oil. Not sure why! Actually I see this as a healthy eat out and oil definitely isn't ! Overall not bad but if can reduce the oil drizzle I would have given it 4"}
{"text":"Been here 4 times and everytime I've enjoyed what I've had. Very local and fresh, kind of a hipster type of place. Local art on the wall, wait staff seems stoned, and the mango tea, is addictive. PESTO PIZZA add chicken is the BOMB!!! Do not come here with out ordering the cilantro/jalapeno hummus......orgasmic!!! I would pay big money for that receipe!!!"}
{"text":"The best patio and environment of all the pita jungles. And of course great food!"}
{"text":"This is not my favorite location. I find that the staff is awkward and it is so loud inside. This time I sat outside and I think they forgot about me. I am glad that they are dog friendly and suggested I take a to-go glass of my drink, but overall was disappointed in the usual great Pita experience I have had at other locations. Their hummus is worth punching someone for, but I think it is better to drive a little further for the rest of the Pita ambiance I love."}
{"text":"Latest addiction is triple hummus platter with ahi tuna.  Get an extra side of cucumbers for a perfect low carb meal of amazingness."}
{"text":"1 star for the horrible to go service. I'm writing this review after 5 tries of ordering to go, so I think my rating is fair.  Restaurants thrive on consistency.  Well Pita Jungle is consistent--on horrible service. The hostess who took my order on the phone was very rude. She constantly told me to \"speak up, I can't hear you\" in a rude manner.  A customer friendly approach would be \"I'm sorry, our restaurant is loud, can you please speak up.\" After placing my order, I asked for the total. She rudely responded \"I don't have it front of me.\"  Again, a nicer approach would be \"I will have your total upon your arrival\" or something to that extent.  Picking up the order was another ordeal of rude service! I often order to go from my favorite restaurants. After 5 experiences of horrible phone service and pick up service, Pita Jungle is a \"no go\" for me!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. First time at this PJ. Hop Knot and Cauliflower app is calling my name. Digging on the music."}
{"text":"I absolutely love pita jungle and their food, but this location has terrible service. I'm a server too so I understand if the servers may be having bad days but every time I have come its been bad. The servers aren't friendly whatsoever and I feel like they have no standards of service. It makes me sad because I absolutely love their food but the bell rd location in Peoria is a lot better. Their staff is super friendly and attentive unlike this location."}
{"text":"CATTLE CALL ? Ate here three times. The food is too bland for me. It tastes like diet food. If I want diet or healthy food I will eat at home. When I eat out I want food that tastes good. If that means adding lard, or salt, or sugar, or MSG... so be it.  Made the mistake of sitting on the patio once.  I found out what sardines feel like."}
{"text":"I have been ordering food to pick up from this location, and they are always prompt and courteous.  Plus they get my order right every time.  Recently dined in at their Tempe location, and it was great as well.  So I think this restaurant chain is well managed."}
{"text":"Great food, great service and happy hour looks great, but management is obviously oblivious if they shut off the misters outside during September with customers still eating 40 minutes before close. They also shut the vinyl enclosures right next to our able and it dripped on us (also didn't smell good and made it hotter since it blocked the breeze)."}
{"text":"I got the hummus with grilled chicken and the chicken shawarma. I like the shawarmas across the street at Greek wraps better."}
{"text":"I never write yelp reviews and personally I don't believe in them. However, my experience with Pita Jungle Downtown Phoenix has continuously gone downhill. As a vegetarian, it's extremely difficult to find restaurants catered to our food preferences. About a month ago I ordered the macro platter and Greek salad for pickup. When I came home the salad looked disgusting. There was a massive red onion with onion skin on it and a brown lettuce stem the size of 6-8.\" Basically, the salad looked liked the pantry chef/garde manger chef threw it together in a dark closet. I called the restaurant immediately and spoke with the manager, he informed me he would credit my bill in full. I still haven't received the credit and have called since the incident and was informed I would receive the credit and it was just delayed because of the holidays. Still waiting. Tonight, with great hesitation I ordered dinner. I ordered a falafel pita, sauteed broccoli, potatoes, side of tahini, side of pickles and a side of Tzatziki. My bf picked up the food tonight and upon receiving the order I noticed I didn't receive the side of pickels or Tzatziki. The red onions in the falafel pita were absolutely HUGE as well as the MASSIVE broccoli pieces and potatoes. This restaurant continues to go downhill. Their kitchen staff doesn't care about the food or presentation and it shows. I gladly welcome a new vegetarian restaurant to come into the area to take over this poorly managed restaurant."}
{"text":"Best vegetarian food! Love that pretty much all their menu item can be made vegetarian- makes for lots of yummy options!!"}
{"text":"I had heard a lot about this joint so i decided to check it out. For some reason, I thought it would be much smaller and wouldn't have waiter service. I was happy when I saw it was roomy, had a great place to sit and eat outside, and there were actual servers that would bring you your food...a hot comodity in this town.  We sat down and it took our hipster server to come take our drink orders. My friend got the chai tea...they didn't have soy milk so I passed on that. We also ordered the garlic dip. I LOVE garlic so I thought the dip was awesome but my friend warned that chai and garlic are not a good combo.  I had the roasted veggie pita and it was SOOO good. It was super big so I had to use a knife and a fork. The brown rice inside was cooked perfectly! I could only eat half of it so I took the rest home which was a nice breakfast the next day.  Overall, I thought it was a good experience. All kind of people were there and it was the first time I saw some real diversity in Chandler, very cool. The staff was relaxed so if you go, you should relax. The prices were reasonable and you do get what you pay for. I like this joint and I definitley be returning."}
{"text":"I always come to pita jungle just for their wood fired veggie lavosh. Just had dinner there tonight for my birthday with my family and they completely ruined my favorite item. When I got my meal I had to check to see if they gave me the right thing. The dish now has very little veggies(used to be a huge wrap) and they have added multiple cheeses and pesto that I had to get removed due to my dietary restrictions. If you used to come for this dish you will be severely disappointed. Probably won't be back anytime soon unless they go back to the old lavosh."}
{"text":"I loveeeeee Pita Jungle. You can;t go wrong with the red bell pepper hummus with grilled chicken or the chicken pasta salad.  Service is decent. A very chill kick back place.  Also great if your a veggie lover. two thumbs up."}
{"text":"Great food that is well priced. Come here twice a week. Lunch on Mondays and Dinner on Wednesdays. tried most of the menu with no complaints. Great happy hour prices, though the portion size is really small. Only complaint would be the wait during the lunch hour and slow service all around. Been to 3 of their locations in the valley and all have the same quality food and service.   Overall, great food at reasonable price."}
{"text":"If I could eat pita jungle every day I WOULD!!! My favorite things to order are jalape√±o cilantro hummus with chicken, the Greek salad, the mahi mahi dish, and the chicken shwarma.  Great happy hour here and the menu isn't expensive.  Love love love some pita jungle!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Third time we've been there for early dinner before a movie. It takes at least 15 minutes to get a wine from the bar consistently. We would have had additional wine but it just takes too long. Bartenders are on the phone taking to go orders. Food came before our wine. Tonight Bartender was attentive to her friends at the bar though. Menu says happy hour 3-6 daily. Waitress says not on the weekends anymore. Food was good but will go somewhere else from now on."}
{"text":"!!!-------------------SUPER SUPER YUMMY---------------------------!!!  This review is for my first visit to the pita Jungle on May 29, 2013 Noteworthy Note: My family and I had been to Pita Jungle one time before this on a Sunday afternoon, and the place was so packed that people were sitting outside to get a table and the wait was like 30 minutes, so we left to go somewhere faster that day, but not before taking in the amazing scent-sations wafting in from the kitchen. Plus one knows that of there is such a wait, the food has got to be worth it! So, we were eager to go back a few days later,  at the just-before-dinner-crowd hour, like say 4ish Pm.  The interior is trendy and updated, great artwork, lighting and overall ambiance. The staff was alert, friendly and helpful knowing that we were 1st timers.  Being that it was our 1st time we ate at pita jungle (but not our 1st time eating greek) we wanted to taste a bit of everything to get acquainted with what they had so we ordered: ---------------  Our Apps: ---------------  The Mediterranean Platter Hummus, baba ganoosh, tzatziki, taboule, feta cheese, dolmades, falafel and green beans with two pitas. (we figured we could taste several of the apps this way) + we knew we wanted lots of stuffed grape leaves so we also got an extra order of the Dolmades  All of the dishes served on the Mediterranean platter were beyond my expectations. The Hummus was smooth and fresh. You could really taste the tahini which I  find lacking in so many Hummus dishes Ive tried before. The baba ganoosh was my husbands favorite, it was lemony, savory and well textured. The  taboule was a great pallet cleanser, with the fresh chopped parsley (I didnt taste mint) cucumbers and tomato, and quite refreshing on a hot Phoenix afternoon. The tzatziki was both creamy and also refreshing. The green beans were cool and not overly crisp,  yet just the right amount of bite and so they paired well , contrasting texturally with the rest of the plate. The pitas were warm, soft and wonderfully tasty.  (The reason we aren't giving 5 stars instead of 4 enters here) We asked The Waitress who came to ask if everything was ok, if she would bring us an extra order of the Pita Bread , because there was still so much Hummus and baba ganoosh we still wanted to eat on the platter and between the Three of us the 2 pitas didn't last long enough  , But sadly she didn't remember to ever bring them. SADFACE. WANT.    Dolmades Six grape leaves stuffed with rice, tomatoes, onions and parsley, cooked in olive oil and lemon juice.  The taste was amazing! These Should be called \"Dolemites\" (google that) not dolmades because just like Dolemite they were super pimp smooth , kicked that much booty and made the ladies feel sooo satisfied.  Im not used to having Stuffed grape leaves (Dolmades) with tomato in them, & when I read that in the description, I was sort of like (*_*)? But The fist taste was just like you would want them, The leaves were not overcooked but rather perfectly cooked, soft but with just the right amount of tooth. The stuffing was delicious, light and lemony. You could tell they were hand-rolled and handmade that day, not out of some food service package. The olive oil was richly fragrant, but not overwhelming.  ---------------  Our Entrees: ---------------  2 Gyro's Broiled beef & lamb marinated with spices and herbs, served in a Greek pita with mixed greens, tomatoes, onions, pickles and tzatziki. &  1 Falafel Pita Crispy croquettes of chickpeas in a regular pita with cilantro and spices, mixed greens, tomatoes, onions, pickles and tahini.  Again Very Satisfying Quality, and taste + the Prices are crazy affordable for such great quality food. The Pitas are so good, the both Falafel and the Beef / lamb were savory and satisfying, while the fresh vegetables and pickles were crisp and  spot on fresh!  ---------------  Our Dessert: ---------------   Baklava/Baklawa Served rolled with crispy light layers of  phyllo pastry filled with chopped nuts , sweetened with Honey and garnished with crushed bright green pistachio nuts.  I could eat this everyday and NEVER get bored or tired of it, BEST DESSERT EVER!!   My overall Impression was WOW. The prices were great, the quality was astonishingly good the staff was 4 out of 5, I will definitely be making this a regular place to go and would highly recommend it to anyone who wants to try something to wake up your taste buds  , and escape the ordinary fare."}
{"text":"I usually really like pita jungle but this location seems to be poorly run. Plenty of empty tables but the food took forever and they claimed the kitchen was backed up. Stems on grapes in the salad. Graffiti in the bathroom. Disappointed."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place.  I eat here once a week because the food is awesome and affordable.  The chicken salad is out of this world.  The staff has always been the best."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant!  The hummus with pine nuts and with chicken (or without) is to die for!  I love hummus, and this is so good!  I have also eaten their schwarma pits (fried garbonzo beans in a pita) which is equally delicious.  Yum!  I have also had a small lunch pizza with spinach, pesto, goat cheese, and tomatos. Yum! All in all this place has great food, and In have always had great service, and delicious food. It is very fun and consistent.  I will always go back!"}
{"text":"Relatively healthy, tasty food at an affordable price.   You can't go wrong with the happy hour tapas for 1.50."}
{"text":"I am rating this place three stars only because the food was really tasty.  Other than that the service was so so. The place was not very clean. The restrooms were pretty disgusting (like what I would expect at a gas station on a main highway) no toilet paper and no paper towels to dry your hands."}
{"text":"We love this restaurant, it's healthy eating at a super affordable price with a great staff. I can't believe the quality of food you can get here. Yea I have had some orders with an issue from time to time, but nothing that has changed my mind on eating here. I personally like the tabouli salad with salmon. Brett Russo"}
{"text":"Since I moved here, everyone has been recommending Pita Jungle.  I don't get it.  It's fine, but not great.  In fact, the worst part of my meal the first time I went was the *pita*.  Ironic, no?  And I am a carb person.  I judge a meal by the quality of the breads in it, so the pita is important to me.  It was stiff and dry and not so tasty.  The inside ingredients were ok.  I have eaten at MUCH better places in Phoenix.  Maybe I'm not ordering the right things?  I've tried a hummus wrap and a black bean burger.  I'm not going to give up on Pita Jungle yet, because I still feel like everyone else is seeing (tasting) something I don't taste, but so far it's a little emperor's new clothes for me.    UPDATE:  I had a veggie burger, and it was decent.  Enough to bump the restaurant from two to three stars, but the jury's still out."}
{"text":"Pros: Food was fresh-crisp lettuce and other produce. Bread was warm etc. Quickly came out of the kitchen Very helpful waitress  Cons: Unorganized seating Menu was a bit confusing  -ie; does not say what the difference is between types of breads/wraps No gluten free wraps Sauce inside wraps was not spread around so when we were eating our food was dry except for that one bite full of sauce No good coffee to be had in the establishment"}
{"text":"Great salads! Happy hour has good prices for beer, wine and small plates. Nice patio that allows dogs!"}
{"text":"Used to love Pita Jungle. Recent visits have had horrible customer service, and food quality has changed. Yesterday placed order for pick up, waited at the front counter only to be ignored by multiple employees too concerned with their own food near closing time, playing on a cell phones, and another glancing over and continued ignoring. Finally after 10 minutes of waiting I picked up my cold mediocre food without a single comment. Guys at the bar noticed and commented to the waitress that I would never be back. I think they are right."}
{"text":"I found this place on yelp and called for carry out. Ordered the Ahi and pita chips as an entr√©e and a Greek side salad. The Ahi and pita chips was outstanding. I think there was jalape√±o hummus in there which made the whole thing stand out. Next time I will ask for the Ahi rare, but otherwise it was really nice. The Greek side salad was perfect as well."}
{"text":"Service has gotten better this past year. The Broiled Chicken Pita is the best!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I go here often but this last time I went to see a friends art they had on display and of course for the Shwarma (spelling?) I tend to order mine with no tomatoes and the sauces on the side. I can't help it, I like to deconstruct the wrap.   Big fan of this place and the service is always top notch."}
{"text":"I wanted to update my review after having such an awful experience the last time. I see the chairs have been changed out and are much more comfortable. We ate out on the patio and it was very nice. The food and service were both much better this time. The server was extremely personable.  I took one star off because were not asked if we wanted to order dessert and the check was just brought to our table when we finished the entrees. Since the bill was already totaled we didn't order dessert. I remember I was not asked on my last visit either and I would think that would help sales if they tried to sell desserts that are on the menu. Some of them sounded like they would be good. I am happy I gave them another try and will go back again."}
{"text":"I go here every week, the staff is always friendly and the food is always great.  Every option they have has not resulted in a poor food choice yet.  They are accommodating for my distaste for dairy.  They have limited dairy free options, but the ones they do are great, and can modify others.  Really enjoy the Fulafil Pita, the Broiled Chicken Salad, and the spicy chicken wrap!"}
{"text":"I love the food at pita jungle and that it is fast and healthy!!  The service is always great with friendly servers.  I love that you can get pita jungle delivered thru grub hub."}
{"text":"I have been going to this place since long before the expansion, had a buddy that worked in the kitchen when it was a hole-in-the-wall.  Now, I am a carnivore as I love eating tasty flesh in all my meals.  However, when introduced to \"the art of eating healthy\" I was hooked.  I even tried making my own falafel but it is never the same.  The schwarma is good, the pizzas are all great, and since I do love chicken and spiciness, I love the spicy chicken wrap (or burrito as it is huge).  However, about 80% of the time I go I get the falafel pita.  The mix of falafel, tomatoes, pickle, red onion, crisp lettuce and tahini sauce, my mouth is watering writing this.  Also, the hummus is fantastic, especially the cilantro-jalapeno."}
{"text":"Ahhh how I love me some Pita Jungle!  I eat here at least once a week.  The mediterranean chicken salad and the hummus and chicken are my two staples."}
{"text":"the food is ok, but every time we leave we are never happy with the service...seriously takes forever, and never have refills or even silverware. My bf and i used to go a lot...but haven't been in about 6 months now"}
{"text":"Having gone to ASU and been to the original Pita Jungle location, I was very excited to see Pita Jungle down the street from our new house.  I've been here several times to eat in and take out and the food is consistently the same as the one in Tempe.  My favs - Cilantro and Jalapeno Hummus with Chicken, Chicken Shwarma, Garlic Potatoes, and taboule.  I do have to say that this location is always really busy and it can get very loud in there.  If you're not in the mood to deal with crowds, order takeout...the food is the same."}
{"text":"I have to say I have tried this Pita Jungle Downtown location multiple times to give it a fair chance to display their quality of service and food.   I have been here during high and low traffic times.  Each time has been the most horrible display of customer service in the metropolitan Phoenix area.  I'm a huge foodie, so in that sense I do admit that the food that I have ordered so far has been up to par.  So, kudos to the cooks.  I recently gave this location one last chance and to no surprise they failed at providing even the most basic and courteous customer service.  Regarding the servers I have gotten each time I dine here:  raggedy clothes that are tattered and too small to be worn, simple ponytail hairdos look like they were done by a 2 year old, their fingernails are way too disgustingly long to be anywhere near food.  Ew...Gross.  And nasty stuck up attitudes.    The last time I dined here I was much more attuned to my environment and my server, hoping for a better experience.  We were sat down by the host at the long community table.  After a long wait (the restaurant was not extremely busy) our server finally stopped by to take our order.  We made a few modifications to our order and she rolled her eyes and sighed like we were being a huge bother.   Our entrees came out before our appetizers.  Seriously, can they get someone to manage the food window in a more organized fashion?  A different server came out, apologized,  and gave us our appetizers.  While sitting at our table (which is right behind wall/area where the servers fill drinks) my friend and I overheard servers talking about customers they were serving.  We heard offensive language and rude blatant comments about customers.    Our jaws dropped.    Throughout the entirety of our meal, it was a chore to get our server's attention to refill our drinks.  She sure did know how to make us feel like a burden.  We finished our meal and got the heck out of dodge.    I have been in the restaurant/customer service industry for years and I am absolutely appalled by this restaurant.   It really does not take a genius to know what is proper attire and how to treat customers.  I understand this is a \"hipster-ish\" location but come on!   I will never eat here again and will warn everyone I know of this customer hating restaurant."}
{"text":"The service here is getting worse each time we go in there. We asked for \"a couple of minutes\" to review the menu. The waitress came back 20 minutes later. No, not exaggerating, I kept looking at my watch. 20 minutes.  I don't get the appeal of this place. The food is kind of boring and bland. The prices are in line with what they should be, but this is nothing to write home about.  I'm glad that down town is getting more places to eat, but if the prevailing attitude is going to be sort of blah, then I think I'll drive to eat."}
{"text":"Freakin love this place, humus, chicken and pasta, pitta chips, yum, yum"}
{"text":"Pita Jungle has quickly become my \"go to\" for excellent service, & happy friendly servers. The healthy selection of food options is perfect for my needs. The atmosphere is perfect for indoor or outdoor service and fun with friends or colleagues. I recommend the chicken Mediterranean Salad and grilled veggies with hummus!"}
{"text":"Very cool decor although it was really dark inside. I had the fire roasted chicken... Chicken on top of mashed potatoes that taste instant and diced tomatoes.. all together I think the potatoes and tomatoes were weird together and just didn't taste that great. Disappointed, maybe I should have tried something else. Not a fan of pita bread that is why i tried the chicken. Staff could have been a little more accommodating too..."}
{"text":"I like eating here, but there are a few things they could work on.  First off, their menu is not always accurate about ingredients and they won't tell you that when you order.  Their food portions are too large, which is a good and bad thing but it effects pricing.  They are pricey, but it's Scottsdale, so what do you expect lol.  They are slow.  Don't eat here if you don't have at least an hour free.  I ate alone and ordered a super simple sandwich and it took almost 45 mins to get eating.  The food is not bad, but it's not amazing.  The waiters are nice and sweet though.  They seem happy, so the atmosphere is good.  I'll keep eating here, but with reserve to the things I mentioned above."}
{"text":"Not dog friendly.  As hippy as this establishment seems to be, they didn't allow my pup on the outside patio.  Go to Cafe Zupa, if you have a fur baby."}
{"text":"Love the mediterranean platter and also chicken salad (huge salad with great dressing) and falafel.  Only 3 stars because the service is up and down, frankly more often lacking than good."}
{"text":"I ate there 3 days ago for the first time and have gone back every day and ordered the same thing. This also happened to my coworker so becareful, you've been warned. The food is supreme. Their chicken is so good. I've only gotten the mediteranean pita which after I eat it I feel better, like I got the nutrition I needed, made with real chicken and fresh lett & tom. They put hummus and pickles in the wrap which brought a tear of joy to my eye when I discovered it. They also have interesting fresh brewed iced teas like kiwi green tea, black berry tea, etc. Totally recommend it, even in a food court in fashion square"}
{"text":"I visited Pita Jungle with a large group on December 23rd. Our whole family got the Gyros and they were great. The only complaint I have is that they do not offer Greek fries like so many other Greek restaurants offer. Perhaps it is because this place is for health freaks. Oh well, I will visit again but I really wish they had Greek Fries. That would take it to 5 stars for sure."}
{"text":"Great food and presentation, the service was however a bit slacking I've tried looking for a waiter to help me with condiments ( he didn't even asked how our order was or if we needed anything. for my order so I just had to just eat my food how it was.. refills weren't even offered as well and our food was rushed before we even finished our starters, I've been to other stores in the valley but this one seems to have been a disappointment for me."}
{"text":"I just had the spicy chicken wrap. It was awesome. If you are in Phoenix downtown. This is a place you should surely visit."}
{"text":"Horrible service we waited 30mins to be able to order our food. Our waiter seem to forget everything even us when it came to food or just simple things like to go boxes. We received horrible service. Food was good but if James is your waiter run. He was extremely erratic and forgetful. Also acknowledged it numerous times which you figure he would have got it together horrible experience would not recommend."}
{"text":"Best bargain around town. You get lots of great tasting food here for cheap prices. I've been coming here for about 15-20 years now and have never been disappointed. Great artsy/Tempe atmosphere as well. Can never go wrong with their Lentil Fetoosh salad."}
{"text":"Everything was cold and veggies were also not that fresh. Pita breads were also not properly cooked"}
{"text":"You gotta try the Chicken Philly Pita sandwich. It has huge chunks of the most juicy, flavorful chicken I have ever tasted!! How in the heck do they do that? Along with the red and green bell peppers, onion and cheese, this is a meal that can't be beat. Add the jalape√±o and cilantro hummus and you'll be in pita heaven! I've liked all the pita jungle locations, but this one is really exceptional. I took a friend who I consider to be a \"foodie\"... He couldn't stop raving about how good it was. The server was really great, too. She visited our table just when we needed something. The mango-raspberry cheesecake is phenomenal, by the way! We told the manager how great everything was.   Let me encourage everyone to let mgmt know when you've had a great experience in their establishment. Our country has become so fast paced we often forget common courtesies. It seems we are much more apt to say when something has gone wrong. Everybody wants to appreciated so take a minute to say thanks when you find someone doing an exceptional job!"}
{"text":"We frequent this Pita Jungle quite often.  Their servers are always attentive and the food is always great!  Our favorites are the Spicy Mango Shrimp (when available) and currently the Wood fired Trout with Black quinoa.  My wife likes the Hummus plate with seared Ahi and we both plow through at least 2 of their passion fruit teas.  Inside it can get quite loud so if you are there for a business meeting it might be better to sit on the patio (if not too hot)."}
{"text":"This place is the bomb! I go here all the time with the wife! Just try it, anything on the menu is great!"}
{"text":"I am a HUGE Pita Jungle fan and I've waited anxiously for this location to open because it is so close to my work. It seems to be an instant success and super-busy already... good for you Pita Jungle. The food has the same great flavor and everything was awesome.   The only reason I didn't give five stars is the noise. Something must be done about it. I took two clients to lunch the other day and they loved the food, but said they probably wouldn't come back because you can't hear yourself think. I hope it's an easy fix... because I agree... I'll send most of my time at the William's Field location which is perfect :)  Please, please do something about the noise... I love this place!"}
{"text":"This was my first time in pita jungle since I moved downtown and my server Erica was training with Jordan. And the service was absolutely amazing. I came in just to enjoy a few cocktails with an appetizer. And they girls serving my table were attentive and so sweet. I will definitely be returning to this location. Thank you pita jungle!"}
{"text":"Great value and another wonderful place in the neighborhood.   A table of four with appetizers and desert was less than $70.  The baklava was great.  Only issue was the tabbouli wasn't as fantastic as I hoped for but all and all, lovely set up."}
{"text":"Pita Jungle has something for everything. Even my pickiest friends love it.  The Desert Ridge location is brand new, has a big patio, more tables than the other locations and the food quality has not suffered.  The Salmon Salad, Pesto Pizza, Jalapeno Cilantro Hummus & the Beef Gyro are among my favorite items. This location does feel less hipster than the Tempe location, but that isn't a bad thing."}
{"text":"This place is my staple.  Delicious every meal.  The pricing is reasonable and the portions are amazing.   You'll like the wait staff.  They're sweet people.  Also the patio is really nice on a beautiful day.    Parking is easy, too."}
{"text":"This is the go-to place for me and and a few of my co-workers.  Why? Because it's somewhat healthy (one of my co-workers is vegetarian and they have a lot of vegan offerings) and we all love the food here.  Not everything is perfect, but the meat is always very well cooked and lean, they sometimes use too much garlic (but I like garlic) but the portions are healthy sized, and you don't have regret later for eating badly.    The gyros here are great btw."}
{"text":"Justin was my waiter...great guy...working bar and food...AND to-go orders..all hands jumped in to give excellent service. Food.,.awesome as always..."}
{"text":"Horrible and rude service. I didn't even get anything difficult. I got a lavash dharma and a delicious quesadilla.  The host was rude. The manager was rude and our server had on enough cologne to start an emporium.  But the food was good"}
{"text":"It was my sister's birthday and 6 of us decided to go eat at Pita Jungle. We had the best server ever, her name is Kayla, and she took care of us perfectly. She didn't interrupt us or our conversations once, always made sure our drinks were filled and you could just tell she knew what she was doing. Thanks for making my sister's birthday great, Kayla!"}
{"text":"We use to eat here and were very happy. The past 2 times we've gone, I've been so disappointed! We've been two weeks in a row...last week we saw our server when we ordered and when we paid. We asked for napkins, refills and boxes from other servers. Where was our server???? Oh, she was real busy chatting by the bar with another worker! I guess they give her better tips then we would have.   Went today and ordered off happy hour menu. They were out of the red wine so she have me two others to choose from and then she charged me the menu price. If you are out and aren't going to honor the pricing that needs to be clearly communicated. We came at the time we did to take advantage of happy hour. I really wish she would have gotten a manager involved. Maybe they aren't concerned with customers who come weekly, either sitting inside or ordering to-go.   It's time to find a new place. Good thing one is opening up in the same parking lot."}
{"text":"I had never seen a burger like that before. It was a black bean burger except it was not processed ... Just cooked black bean corn and some hot sauce mixed together and placed between the buns. I really liked the concept!  We also had the pesto pizza with spinach mushrooms and tomatoes, which was also pretty good !"}
{"text":"Awesome food. Best hummus. Accidentally I forgot my cel phone here after having dinner. The staff is very cooperative. They kept my phone until I arrived.  Best staff and best food. Worth a try:)"}
{"text":"Simply the best there is. From their hummus (the jalapeno-cilantro one is my fav), to the chicken pasta (my wife's fav) to the falafel or gyro's... you can't go wrong. Great service, chill atmosphere, decent prices and... the food.... AMAZING. I don't know why I don't go here more often. And I've frequented alot of them (the one on Apache, Ray Rd in Chandler & Ahwatukee)... They are often busy, especially weekends, but its well worth it. I like the diverse crowd too... its not like its JUST a haven for yogi's & hippies, which is nice. Nothing worse than feeling out of place, and this place, doesnt do that at all."}
{"text":"This weekend the wife and I decided to try out this Pita Jungle location. We'd eaten at the one in Tempe with friends, but this one is much closer to home.  First off, the food we ate was excellent.  We ordered essentially the same thing as we did at the Tempe Pita Jungle: Chicken Hummus.  This is grilled chicken piled atop of 3 different types of hummus.  This time we went with the Cilantro Jalapeno Hummus, Roasted Bell Pepper Hummus, and the Garlic Dip. I love the Cilantro Jalapeno, my wife was a fan of the Roast Bell Pepper, and we both really like the Garlic Dip.  Two pieces of Pita Bread apiece dipped in this delicious hummus was more than enough to fill us up. We even had plenty of leftovers.  I know they have other tasty stuff on the menu and I'd really like to try them, but this one dish is so good I'd be going back to Pita Jungle if that was the only thing on the menu.  My one complaint about this place is that the acoustics are terrible.  The restaurant was a little over half full and we could barely hear our waitress. Although, if she just would have spoken up it may have been less of an issue.  She did make up for it, though, by offering us our drinks in to go cups when we were getting ready to leave and came back with giant cups of tea (If you're looking for a tasty drink, try their green tea.)  Pita Jungle is definitely a place I recommend eating, and I'm sure we'll be back sooner than later."}
{"text":"SUCH good food, SUCH good prices, SUCH generous portions! I live in San Francisco but I will be sure to make a trip to Pita Jungle everytime I am in Phx."}
{"text":"The food is very good but the service at this location is awful. We've tried dining in several times here but the attitude toward the customer at this location is like they are doing us a favor. We love the food so just choose the take out option."}
{"text":"Placed order to go through GrubHub, food missing and the ordeal to correct was very annoying. Called Pita Jungle and they told me the driver is supposed to check order. Grub Hub said \"no\" the drivers aren't supposed to check order. Manager was less than accommodating and rather surly stating it was GrubHub's fault. Decided not to argue and drove to location in pending storm...wind/lightning/thunder to pick up missing food. Manager said they would have delivered it, yet this offer was never made during phone conversation. Manager offered desert to rectify situation..got piece of very sweet carrot cake, tossed it after two bites...eliminate the chocolate swirl in the take out dish. Will not ever go to this Pita Jungle and stick with my ususal location near Desert Ridge...."}
{"text":"I like the food at these restaurants but service can depend upon how late the young servers were out the night before."}
{"text":"As a big fan of PJ for the past decade, it pains me to say that my experience tonight at their newest location was bad. Not just so-so or meh, but bad.   First off, they had multiple tables open but refrained from seating us because there were 9 of us in our party. We said we would split into two table but we were told even if we did that, they didn't want to overload their kitchen, If seating two tables will overload the kitchen, then you've got kitchen issues.  Secondly, we waited over an hour for our food. We watched other tables get seated after we were, receive their food, and finish before we were served. I know they usually have their food out fast, like in 5 to 10 minutes so to wait over an hour was a disappointment to say the least. When I did receive my meal, it tasted like it had been sitting under heat lamps, which it likely had been for a long time.  I know this is a new location, but I sure hope they get their kinks worked out because this evening's experience was.....bad.  As a consolation, the decor is nice and the hostesses were very nice."}
{"text":"Price:  yes, it's expensive for what you get.  i bet the owners are from Scottsdale, and they'd insist that's what people SHOULD pay for this stuff.  Service:  it's sketchy, so things will go better if you'd just keep your expectations down.  Taste:  everything i've tried has been good-to-excellent  One last thing-- the tables are so incredibly crammed together, that wait staff has trouble walking around the chairs that people are sitting in.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Love Pita Jungle. My husband and I frequent this one often. We were invited to meet his brother and family there again last week. As usual the Chicken Del Sol \"Rocked\". Yummy stuff and the staff was great too, Thanks"}
{"text":"I have always enjoyed this restaurant and never had an issue with my food or service until today where a burger comes out cold in the middle. It was ordered medium rare so it was expected to have some pink in the middle but not be raw and still cold. When we asked to have it taken back to have it fixed it came back as the same patty that had been squished down on the grill. When we asked if it was standard procedure to throw the partially eaten burger back on the grill and re-serve it our waitress said yes. We told her it seemed unsanitary and she asked if we wanted a new one. Of course we said yes and the third one came out great, but when we got the bill, we had been charged for two burgers. We asked the waitress again if it was common practice to re cook meat and serve it again. Shamefully she said no. It seems like this particular establishment needs to brush up on health codes and basic customer service."}
{"text":"Really bad service. Everything comes in teaspoon or table spoon measurements. The guy at the veggies said the bowl comes with only one dressing while the menu board clearly says two. This place is no where closer in service compared to the actual pita jungle locations. Overly priced and the bowl is only half full."}
{"text":"Good food!  I ordered a chicken lavosh and it came with a bonus side salad.  Despite being packed waiter was attentive.  I would go back!"}
{"text":"We were told there is a 15-20 minute wait while half of the restaurant was empty.   The rude hostess told us because tables were not clean. Although they were all set with new silverware. Not sure if this is etiquette for restaurants..??..??   Keith out server. Awesome.   Food, good as usual. Won't go back."}
{"text":"perfect staff! they are fast and do not make you wait and are not RUDE like the other!   Ive been to other pita's and they all think they are the only ones but this one is such a chill mesa location and close to tempe.   if you looking for good food and a chilll/clean night go!"}
{"text":"Are you joking about trying this location again? This was the \"try again\". The previous visit, I  ordered a spinach pasta salad with fresh mozzarella. The mozzarella was completely spoiled to the point it was yellow and hardened. I could not believe that someone would actually slice it and serve it. I also noticed the inability to maintain fresh mushrooms, hence the now \"roasted mushrooms\" in the otherwise cold ingredient salad. Btw - update the image on the menu!"}
{"text":"This location is by far the worst of them all. I have watched the steadily declining food quality and service since they have opened. Our last experience this last time was the kicker. The waitress was a young girl with very little social skills and really needed help with articulation and volume. She had trouble multitasking and lacked attentiveness. But the other servers picked up the slack. So all was good. We ordered gyro, fatoosh and cilantro hummus. Cilantro hummus is always consistent and good. The gyro not so much. The meat was cooked like bacon: crisp, crumbly and almost considered burnt. It had to be sent back. The return food was decent but had some mystery meat wrapped inside that we will assume for our piece of mind was grill bits.  The fatoosh is 3/4 rice, which is awesome if you love rice, not awesome if you are looking for a light flavorful salad that is typical with fatoosh. The kicker, the manager and other servers wiped up tables that were considerably messy that had children seated at them with DRY napkins. No bleach/ disinfectant / wet towels used. And promptly sat another families with children at those tables. Poor quality food, subpar service I can tolerate. Not uncleanliness and poor hygiene. I will visit the other locations."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing for how healthy it is. It's really easy to order vegetarian here since most items either are already vegetarian or only have chicken or salmon added. The servers are always very attentive and friendly. I like to drink coffee later in the day and they're always happy to start a pot even if it's just for me which I think is a lovely touch. The service is always prompt and I've never had to wait too long for food. Usually it's out much quicker than anticipated. I've had the Turkey Lavosh Wrap several times, but my go to is the Chicken Del Sol with an app of their hummus. The Del Sol has generous portions of chicken and a nice southwestern tang in the broth. I usually eat half of each and then get the rest to go. If you leave some of the pita pieces in the broth it'll soak up overnight and be even more delicious the next day."}
{"text":"Excellent food! Excellent service! They helped me out with my dietary restrictions with such care and detail. Half off wine on Tuesday helps too!"}
{"text":"I went to pita jungle today on shea at lunch and was told that they would not take any more customers because they were too busy.  I was not given a wait time or to go order as an option.  I was just told that no more tables are available today and turned away.  I did not appreciate the customer service I was given.  Should it not be the customers decision to wait if there are long wait times?   I have never had this happen to me before at a restaurant.  I think that pita jungle management should let this GM know that it is never appropriate to turn away customers when the restaurant is busy as it is not good business."}
{"text":"Good food just on the expensive side. Went with a college friend for the first time didn't know what to expect. Great service and great tasting food. Would recommend to anyone wanting to try different good food."}
{"text":"WAITRESS named ANNE, one of the worst I have EVER had at any restaurant, very rude and crude, did not even give me or my gf silverware or napkins the whole meal. Nor did she check-in on how everything was. Acted like serving us was an inconvienence.   We WILL NOT be visiting this establishment anytime in the near future due do how aweful the service was. Food was ok nothing to rave about. But BAD service goes far regardless of the food and forevermore leaves a bitter taste in your mouth!"}
{"text":"The Pita Jungle never disappoints me.  It never matters what I order they're always blowing my taste buds.  Very satisfied!  They're always very polite and prompt to sit us.  It's clean, and has a great environment.   It can get pretty busy so don't go there if you're rushing to get in and out."}
{"text":"I love Pita Jungle, regardless of the location.  The food is delicious, and so much of it for a great price!  Their happy hour is even better and a great way to try a variety of their appetizers.  The service here is pretty quick, always friendly, and if you like fresh lemonade...this is a great spot!"}
{"text":"Hummus and Ahi Tuna. Doesn't get much better. Great service. Wonderful food. It's a bit noisy for my taste. But that just makes me talk louder!"}
{"text":"This is always a reliable place to eat at. Today I had a few Tapas. Dolmades are always tasty as are the falafel. I was disappointed by the time and olive pita. It lacked moisture. But what made up for the dryness was Aloha Longboard beer. A favorite of mine since my visit to Maui. A must have from now on!!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch and had the chicken curry salad. It was solid, but a very mild curry sauce. We also had the falafel platter, which included two very dry pieces of pita. It was ok, but nothing to rave about."}
{"text":"Food was great as always at OK, but service was pretty bad. Slow to take order, food took nearly 30 minutes with a slim crowd. Never checked back to see how things were or if we needed anything else (we  did). Not bad enough to keep from coming back, just a tad disappointing.."}
{"text":"Avoid this location for many reasons.  1. The hostess seated us at a table that was dirty.  2. When the server (Tony) finally showed up (10 minute wait), he was very rude.  3. It took 5 minutes yo get my drink, and they weren't even busy.  4. The staff was habitually touching their face and hair, especially the bartender tonight (5/1/12). I hope none of them touched my food.... 5. When I ordered with Tony, I made a mistake and he rudely tried to correct me instead if ask questions.  6. I had an empty glass of water for over 10 minutes.   Not sure why this location doesn't have their act together. Tell all of your friends to not waste their time."}
{"text":"First timers at P. J.  (Shea restaurant). We had hummus sampler, bowl of chick, garlic, coconut milk, white onion, red bell, jalapeno and yellow curry soup. Fantastic!!  I had chicken combo plate and my wife had a mahi mahi dinner. Pistachio ice cream and carrot cake for dessert. Food was superb. Our wait person, Josh Berk was very knowledgeable and efficient. Great job!!"}
{"text":"I never wanted to try hummus because of how it looked. When my fiance finally convinced me to try it, it was here. I absolutely love PJ and the chicken lavosh pizza is to die for!"}
{"text":"Terrific, terrific, and did I mention Terrific! Delicious food, great atmosphere, great prices, and super service!! We can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This is our go to place.  Tried almost everything on the menu.  Happy hour Tappas are an awesome deal and tasty.  Live jazz on Thursdays is not always my cup of tea but usually not annoying.  Service is usually pretty good too. 4.5 stars cuz thats highest I give unless there is a happy ending"}
{"text":"Amazing hummus! First time taking the kids and a great place to admire the local art work."}
{"text":"Strange as it may feel to order something called the \"Philly Steak Pita\"--on the same menu with the \"Macro Platter\" (steamed veggies and tofu)--the Philly is one of the best items you can get here. It's finger-searing hot, a dripping mess of thin-sliced beef with grilled peppers, onions, and melting mozzarella cheese, a satisfying handful of goodness that's begging for an extra dollop of hummus or garlic sauce to create a stream of perfect bites. All for less than 7 bucks.  I've been going to Pita Jungles for at least 15 years now, starting at the location by ASU and now mostly at this Chandler location. It's our standby when we want something on the healthy side. Very few items on the menu have ever disappointed, and the bang-for-the-buck here is high.   Beyond the Philly, my favorites include: grilled veggie salad, chicken combo, and the lavosh shawarma wrap.  I'd agree that the service can occasionally be a little snooty, trying to be a bit too-hip-for-you, but generally, we get good service here."}
{"text":"I find myself at Pita Jungle Ahwatukee once every week or two,  mostly due to lack of other more healthy options in the area and the fact that I can order vegan very easily.  However it is unfortunate that the food almost always far exceeds the customer service standards...  with the exception of a couple of servers, Keith being one of them. It seems like management is too lax and although I can appreciate a casual environment, it shouldn't mean service suffers. It is usually expected that our waiter/waitress will be talking to another server at a POS or by the bar when we are waiting for drinks or even after the food has been delivered, rather than asking if there is anything else we need. We have been on the patio numerous times and it has appeared the servers pick up patio tables so they have some inside then maybe a random few outside, which typically lends to patio tables getting poorer quality service and servers feeling too strained.   Pita Jungle offers great options for children, however when I asked on our most recent lunch visit, which of the food options are organic for the kids meals (i.e fresh fruit) the server said \"I don't think any\".  With the spotlight currently on non-gmo food and organic living, I am very surprised that Pita Jungle hasn't taken the organic plunge yet.  I think the business would sky rocket.  Overall it's not bad,  but it could take steps to hold servers more accountable while still maintaining the artsy edge and definitely introducing organic options."}
{"text":"Hummas & Sirloin still delish. More than enough! Ask for extra feta & a to-go cup if you're like me & can't finish a drink!"}
{"text":"Went here a couple of weeks ago and it was awesome as always! I love the seared ahi with jalapeno cilantro hummus. Just make sure you get the pita chips instead of the plain pit bread. It takes it to a whole new level!"}
{"text":"here's the plan. First get in your car, drive Pita jungle and get whatever is in the menu! everything (except dishes with olives, i hate olives) is delicious! and get Tabor as server! shes super nice!"}
{"text":"I was recommended Pita Jungle by a friend who loves the place. I thought it was good but not quite as incredible as my buddy does. I'll still give them another try to see if it was just my one dish on that particular day."}
{"text":"I have to say Pita Jungle is one of my favorite places to eat. Lunch or dinner is great because you always leave feeling good. The grilled chicken with hummus is wonderful, get the trio of hummus. Love this location too"}
{"text":"The patio is the best here just wish the chairs were padded. Haha I bring my own pads when on a date now. They have good healthy tasty food to choose from. Anyone can find something they like. I personally like in the appetizers the grilled chicken and hummus, you choose the type, so I get the trio. Substitute one pita for more fresh veggies. Its a great meal"}
{"text":"Pita Jungle always takes wonderful care of my family and me. Great service. The young lady who helped us was pregnant and was so so nice! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I went to Pita Jungle for the first time on Saturday Feb. 1st. I had heard some really great things about Pita Jungle and was excited to try it out. I grossly underestimated the popularity of the place though and when I walked up I was surprised to see just how busy the place was. I was with a friend and we were told that a party of 2 had a wait of about 15 minutes. I found the hostess to be a bit short, she was clearly overwhelmed but honestly, that should not affect how she treats people. When we were finally seated I found myself wishing we had sat outside, I felt as though I was sitting on top of the people to my right and left. I felt as though I was intruding on other's meals. The waiter was very nice and knowledgeable about the menu which I found to be incredibly helpful being that this was my first time. I order the Mediterranean Chicken Pita and was very impressed. It was delicious and I thoroughly enjoyed the flavor. My biggest complaint about the whole trip was the wait time to receive our check. We were on a schedule and it took forever for us to receive our check and had to flag someone down to take our payment. I will definitely be returning but I plan on going during a time when it is not as busy and I can enjoy myself a bit more"}
{"text":"Different styled chicken shawarma. Bit pricey, but VERY clean inside.  The manager was really nice when I had asked a boor about the menu. Overall a great place."}
{"text":"My love affair with Pita Jungle is a long one.....perhaps longer than any other restaurant, certainly longer than I can remember, and at least for the adult portion of my life, which is why it pains me to write this review.   For the last 6 months, I have ordered takeout one day a week from this location, typically on a Friday or Saturday. The ridiculousness that has become my adult life has necessitated a heavy reliance on takeout for my main source of nourishment. Although the food is always spot on at Pita, my takeout experience has been anything but.   The prior 3 out of 4 times I went to pick up my food, I ended up waiting past the promised time. Now I'm not unreasonable, waiting 5 or 10 minutes is not a big deal, but each time has been a wait of 25 to 30+ minutes past the pick up time, with no apologies or explanations. I was beginning to wonder if they had ever started cooking my food before I got there. The last time I must've looked really irritated, because I was offered an obligatory baklava for my wait.   Used to the wait, I started showing up 5 to 10 minutes past the promised time, just as preventative maintenance. Imagine my surprise when my order was ready as promised thie time. I left with my bag of food and a smile on my face. I get back to my friend's house, open the bag, and begin to realize just how badly the order has been screwed up. We ordered 4 items, 3 of which were wrong. I load one item up and head back to Pita. Making me wait a ridiculous amount of time for my food is one thing, but blatantly screwing up my order is too much. As I explain my situation to the takeout girl, she goes to get the Manager who proceeds to inform me that I ordered it wrong. As I struggle to keep my cool, I inform them that they must be mistaken. One item was ordered with chicken, my item was turkey, and the other two were salads. Everything came with chicken. The salads were for my vegetarian friends, and I'm allergic to chicken. There's no way you're going to convince me I ordered chicken for myself and two vegetarians. Sorry, try again. Without too much ado, the correct dishes were provided, and yet another obligatory baklava was offered. I declined. There is only so much wrong that baklava can right. Don't get me wrong, their baklava is amazing, but it's not going to make up for them screwing up my order, then trying to blame it on me. Oh, and did I mention that they gave me a coupon for a free appetizer? Too bad the coupon expires in a few days.   I'm afraid I will be taking my weekly Friday takeout business elsewhere, until enough time has passed that maybe, just maybe, I can find it in my heart to forgive Pita Jungle. In the meantime, I suggest you try to get it together down there. In case you missed the count, that's 4 out of the last 5 takeouts you missed the mark on, including 1 you tried to blame on me. That's shameful."}
{"text":"I used to get take out from here 2-3 times per month, then a few months ago I felt there was a terrible combination of increased prices and lower quality.  I always thought of Pita Jungle as an inexpensive option, I could grab take out for the two of us for low-$20's, then I realized I was paying $35 +/- and multiple times getting home to find something wrong with our order.  Maybe it's my mentality:  once I'm used to paying a certain amount for a restaurant, that becomes its value, and in my opinion the large increase made the price here beyond their value."}
{"text":"We have visited other locations and always enjoyed it. Today was a bit of a let down. The high point of the meal was the garlic dip appetizer, the dip was fabulous but it would have been nice to have more than one piece of pita bread to scoop the dip with. My husband had the seared tuna salad, it looked pretty but in the end the flavors were just odd. I had the black bean burger, the actual burger was good but overshadowed by the soggy bread, non dressed salad, mushy flavorless \"garlic\" potatoes and lack of condiments offered to top the burger. I guess the most disappointing though was the staff, they would make a wet rag seem a sparkling wit. It's really too bad."}
{"text":"I simply love this place. I love it so much that I have no shame admitting my membership in that oft-derided (by patrons and employees alike) class of people known as \"regulars.\" While its proximity to my house is a bonus, I go for two reasons: the food and the staff.   I've sampled pretty much everything on the menu, and I like most of it. For the price, it's hard to find a better casual Mediterranean-Lebanese-and-surrounding-areas inspired restaurant with reasonable prices and quick service (sometimes the food comes out too fast!). I am partial to the falafels and all of the lavash wraps (highlights include the turkey pesto and the lavash shwarma), but there are some hidden gems that you might not expect to be as savory as they are (I'm looking at you, garlic mushrooms and cold salads).   The place can be busy and a bit noisy during lunch and dinner, but I've hardly ever had to wait. If, however, you're not satisfied with the table situation, I highly recommend the bar. It is more comfortable than it looks, and, if you come on the right night, you'll get to enjoy the company of Pita Jungle's veteran bartender, Jaclyn, who pours a mean chai (they do have those) and can tell when your drink needs a refill even when it appears that your drink is not in her direct line of sight (this is the true sign of an experienced restaurateur)*. This may possibly be the most important legacy of her time in the trenches of the Old Town Scottsdale club scene, her seeming clairvoyance in all matters related to beverages.  The pleasures of the bar, however, are not limited to the fact that my food is always prepared exactly to my not-so-elaborate specifications, or that my glass is never more than half-empty. At this point, the food plays second fiddle to Jaclyn's acerbic, but refreshing personality. Her company has become an enjoyable part of my twice-weekly (often thrice) Pita Jungle excursions, especially when all it takes to upgrade to first class is the delivery of a piece of chocolate, however small. A bartender who is always on her toes, and whose conversation is a welcome respite from the soul-wasting, quotidian struggle with traffic, work, and  the other assorted charms of adulthood, is proof enough that life can be enjoyable.   While this review has perhaps morphed into an elaborate panegyric about the unacknowledged gem of Pita Jungle's staff, the other reviews on this site are proof enough that service counts just as much as food, and this place excels at both. It is nothing short of a proverbial breath of fresh air in the Scottsdale restaurant scene, which has been stuffy for some time. And this despite the fact that they serve Pepsi, not Coke.  *Perhaps a technically incorrect use of the word \"restaurateur,\" but it sounded good, didn't it?"}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite place to eat in Tempe. Food is ALWAYS good. Service, always friendly and timely served. I love that they promote local artists and it helps the atmosphere feel cozy and downhome. I'm fully convinced I'll never find a better greek salad or garlic dip. Wow. Thinking about it makes me wish I were back at ASU. Two thumbs, way up!"}
{"text":"Pita jungle has a very friendly environment, and very friendly workers!The food is great and they have a wide verity to choose from.The service is great we didn't wait that long for our food to come out.I would recommend the chipotle chicken lavosh."}
{"text":"The food at Pita Jungle was nothing spectacular. I was excited to go here because of the great reviews. First of, we ordered a few things of the happy hour menu, hummus, baba ganoush, lemon chicken and one more which I've already forgotten. The lemon chicken was decent quantity and had some flavor. The rest of the apps were mediocre with regard to taste and tiny tiny servings! I had the chicken platter and my husband a gyro. His gyro was decent, but my platter was not..the chicken was dry and the beans very plain. The pita they served was also dry and stale. I wouldn't go here again."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of Pita Jungle and all its locations.  The tempe one is walking distance from my aparment so I'm a little biased. Last night my family that lives in Surprise came to visit me and we I decided to take them there. My 12yr old sister was really hesitant towards the menu but fell in love with the Chicken and Cheese Pita Crisp and home made pita chips. My stepdad was even more weary since he was just getting over some nasty food poisoning.  I ordered for him and got him the Grilled Lavosh Shwarma wrap.  Being a meat and potato type he looked at me like I was crazy but he devoured it faster than it came out!  The grilled veggie salad is an easy go-to but the lemon dressing was a little intense for me. The Taboule salad is wonderful, and all of the different Hummus' are prefectly smooth and tasty. Love this place"}
{"text":"Awful service. Maybe it would be nice to actually come back to the table after you serve the food. And also forget about the extra items I wanted. Not really busy. Actually really slow here. Maybe because other businesses that opened up downtown that actually care about their customers"}
{"text":"I luv, luv, luv  this restaurant, so please don't let the quality slip, ok?    I was there during the week about 3:00 pm and there were about 5 people total in the restaurant.   I ordered the red lentil soup (a fav of mine!) and it was served at room temperature and I think they changed the recipe because it was bland, lumpy and grainy instead of smooth and creamy.  so send it back, right?  Sent it back to heat it up and it then it came back only slightly warm.  Just declined it after that.  Really Pita Jungle?  Don't have a microwave?    The veggie burger was yummy and delicious, though."}
{"text":"I seriously love Pita Jungle. I've been eating at the Tempe location since it was a little hole in the wall but this location at Ray and Dobson is just too busy (I think). As much as I love the food I think the kitchen staff should take a little more time in preparing their dishes. The other day I ordered a lentil salad for lunch that was soo delicious but I'm 99% sure the rice was bad and I became violently ill right after lunch. Too bad...   Secondly, I ordered a vegan version of a meal that did have chicken in it and substituted it for tofu for my vegan friend. I came home with the food to come to find chicken was in his meal. This could have been really bad if we didn't notice it right away.   I just hope that someone from Pita can read this post and realize that a loyal customer just wants to give some constructive criticism. I love this restaurant but if I keep running into these situations I'm going to have to deem it another careless chain restaurant which is NOT what I'd want to do at all."}
{"text":"I was skeptical going here my first time for lunch.  We sat in the outside section along Mill.  The ambiance was fantastic and the service was great.  I ordered tomato basil on lavish.  As I said, was very skeptical and figured it would be some vegetarian lunch that would leave me hungry and looking for somewhere else to eat on the way back to the office.  I was so wrong, the food was amazing, so much so I go at least once a week.  The humus and chicken are delicious too..."}
{"text":"Y-U-M-M-Y, healthy options. I only wish they had a frequent diner punch card to help me manage the financial aspect of my addiction. (:"}
{"text":"Stopped by yesterday to have something to eat. Ordered the gyros. Sandwich was good, plenty of meat but I have had better."}
{"text":"Pita jungle always has a great selection of food and the decor is always great! I love the art and the nachos are to die for! Especially if you need to eat gluten free!"}
{"text":"Big fan of the pitas, always cooked to order and excellently crafted. Service is usually good, although I must say... Not a big fan of the hostesses they were quite rude and seemed like they just wanted to clock out when I ate there. Other than that no complaints."}
{"text":"Great service and friendly too! Jordan is very attentive and helpful! She always knows what we need and when. I recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"Fantastic and fresh food.  Just as good as the Tempe out post.  Hard to find this style of food around here.  Fish is always great, and pitas and giros are amazing.  Go here!"}
{"text":"The food is great here, and they are pretty big meals. I always enjoy the food and love having the left overs for lunch the next day. I have been here often but have never had a very good experience with the staff. They are always very short with us and don't seem to enjoy serving. However the food is very good so I will keep going back."}
{"text":"Terrible service, my food was ok but my sister's food was wrapped in tinfoil and tasted like metal. The chicken was dry. The kids meal was crap: a glob of steamed spinach, an orange slice, more dry chicken, and noodles with shredded cheese posing as \"Mac and cheese.\" This was not my first time coming but it will definitely be my last."}
{"text":"Good for after the rock gym when you are hungry and look like hell, a nice lunch, or dinner with family or visiting guests. Very inexpensive, HUGE portions, fresh, healthy, lots for vegetarians, i never notice the service, love it. I sat here one rainy Sunday with my sister and talked for countless hours while we drank chai teas and coffee. The wine bottles are overpriced, but they let us re-cork and take home what we did not drink."}
{"text":"Great food, reasonable prices, great service! You should go! Calling in your order on a busy day is definitely the right way to go as this place gets packed at lunchtime!"}
{"text":"Pita Jungle is among our favorite food and there are two locations in Gilbert. I recommend the Chicken Wraps, the salmon, or the curry. I will say that both times we've done take-out, we feel that the portions were drastically smaller--so I would say go here for dine in and get take-out elsewhere."}
{"text":"We use this as one of our staple restaurants. Better than average food and good service. It is noisy because of the poor ceiling design, but other than that it's a good place to go for a quick dinner, lunch, or happy hour."}
{"text":"Never had a bad experience . this menu seems to have a way of pleasing any and everyone who visits. The staff is friendly, although they can be distant if it gets busy, but what place doesn't ? I do prefer to sit outside due to the decor in the restaurant the sound seems to bounce off the walls when the place is busy. My favorite item on the menu is definitely the Sharma wrap ! Their garlic hummus cant be beat!"}
{"text":"Fresh, healthy, and quick. Wide variety of dishes, and healthy portion sizes. Order the Hummus, you won't regret it! As far as entrees go, the Macro Platter is nutritious and filling, and the Mediterranean Platter gives you a little taste of everything."}
{"text":"Quite a decent Medit food place.. Try their sides - they are a steal for what they cost..  Great kebabs"}
{"text":"I have eaten at many Pita Jungle locations, but this one is the best!  Gyro was loaded with meat and the hummus is so good.  If you like dessert, the chocolate baklava is a must!!  Yummy."}
{"text":"I have been to several different Pita Jungle locations, and this one is the least inviting. The food is fine, fresh ingredients competently assembled. This particular location just has a \"vibe\" problem-can't put my finger on it precisely. Perhaps it's too cavernous, maybe too institutional feeling-I don't know. Maybe I just don't like the artwork-but this is not a place I enjoy sitting down to a meal.  The service is very hit-or-miss (they either wanna sit down and eat with you or you have to hunt them down just to pay and get out) and like I said, the ambiance is...weird, for lack of a better term.   I perfer the one in Tempe much better for atmosphere, even the one in Chandler. This location is perfectly adequate for picking up dinner on the way home from work."}
{"text":"The downtown location food is hit or miss. I don't know if it depends on who is cooking or what is happening. When you go on a 'good\" night the food is excelent otherwise it's just ok. This location does consistenly have poor service though especially on the patio."}
{"text":"I just got off a 21 day all vegan fast and all I can say is that if it had not been for Pita Jungle I probably would not have made it. They have some great vegan options as well as just a large selection of healthy fresh menu items at a very reasonable price point. The only reason that I took off a star is that both times I have been here the parking is horrible. The plaza that it is in is awesome for bike up or walk up business, but if you are in a vehicle and it is anywhere from 11-1pm in the afternoon you may as well hang it up cause odds are it is not going to happen.    Back to the food, the hummus trio is seriously fantastic. I don't know of anywhere that I can think of off the top of my head that has better hummus. (I have been wrong before, so feel free to correct me :).  PS...Leave it to me to look over 30 super healthy and delicious menu items to find the one thing on a slab of bread and covered with melted cheese. (The chicken philly pita). There is a little something for every tastebud on their menu which makes for an easy choice if going with a group where no one can make up their minds."}
{"text":"We have needed something like Pita Jungle in this area, like, forever.  My wife and I were joyous when we saw they were opening a location at 7th St and Missouri.  We have visited a couple of times and ordered take out several more.   The food is delicious, as always, but the quality of delivery, both to the table and to the home, sucks.  The kitchen is slow for in-house orders, tables settings and presentation are sparse, and it's noisy.  I get that prices are low, and the quality is good, but they are sacrificing customer satisfaction by ignoring the little things. Like keeping drinks full, or being prompt when someone asks for extra napkins.  Their other locations can do this.  I know this location is new, but they should be past the startup errors by now.  As for take out orders, I have yet to have one right.  I'm not one to stand there and open every in the order to make sure it's all correct.  I'm assuming a quality restaurant like this will get it right.  Bad assumption.  The food is often cold, and/or, soggy, meaning it's  prepared well in advance of scheduled pickup time.  Orders are frequently not correct, like missing extra aioli, or being charged for a side salad when you asked for a substitution instead of potatoes.  Also, five little pieces of potatoes really don't constitute a \"side order\".  Particularly when you're being charged extra.  If you are going to patronize this place, just be aware they have a long way to go in the customer satisfaction department."}
{"text":"I love Pita Jungle! Every meal I've had is on point, at any location I've been to. The chicken and hummus is my top pick. Their pesto pizza with chicken is healthy and super flavorful. I recently had their cheese and spinach quesdilla with chicken and fell in love!! Happy Hour is the best time go if you want a quick drink and filling snack, very well priced items.   I gave THIS location 3 stars because the service is always spotty, no one really smiles at you, and if you order food to go, they will NOT heat up the pitas. I have even complained before about this because,  lets be honest, who eats a COLD pita and enjoys it. My response was \"Its something we choose not to do. You can request it on your next order.\" Seriously? I've had to go orders from many other Pita Jungles and they some how managed to find the time to heat up my pitas. Get it together!"}
{"text":"one of the few hipstery/yuppy places in tempe!  call what you want, it's damn good.  i've never been disappointed in the food here. the quality of the food and the atmosphere is extremely high for the price.  and it's a healthier alternative to other nearby eateries.  the Mediterranean burrito thingy is HUGE and tasty.  it makes two meals for me.  places like this in SF charge about double for the same food...  good for a date (dont get caught checking out the waitresses), group of friends, or the fam (just not the little ones)."}
{"text":"Great place to eat and watch the crazy people at Amy's Baking Company from the safety of the fenced off patio ....."}
{"text":"Pita Jungle has the best hummus I have ever tried!  My favorite thing to get is the hummus and tabouli, its a meal itself!  Also, Gambas con ajo is delicious and savory, with carrot chips! Luckily there are more than 1 around now, I've been to 4 locations, same quality and service is apparent at all."}
{"text":"Portions too small when ordering sides- when I order side of hummus or in the Mediterranean platter, portions are significantly smaller than at other Pita Jungle locations. Not feeling like I'm getting my money's worth."}
{"text":"Great food & atmosphere service was excellent . I had the Tiki Masala chicken was juicy and tender rice was delicious great presentation It is always a pleasure to have a wonderful experience when i go out to eat #1 priority to besides great food is having a server that is kind and courteous.  Elizabeth  Bustamante thank you for great service have an infectious smile wonderful way to end my week. Dine date 6-17-2016 Michael Millan"}
{"text":"I had an errand to run so was in the neighborhood figured I'd stop into this place. Girl at front counter was super friendly and helpful. The only thing I remember about her is her voice. Could listen to her tell me how inept I am for the rest of my life. She recommended a shushuamadh thing so I had that. Food was ok, not my favorite but would come again to listen to her voice. If you see this, drinks?"}
{"text":"Not really big on this type of cuisine but they have something for everyone! Hello Philly Chicken Pita. Service has always been fast and friendly on our visits, especially with my family being very picky with little substitutions on our pitas. I get mine with mozzarella and onions, skipping peppers, and they always accommodate. The chicken is out of this world. No idea what they put on it, possibly paprika, but it's incredible. Our pitas are always nice and soft as well.   Definitely worth a visit if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"I walked in with high expectations for good service and a meal. Waitress was not in her best mood so was inflexible With our requests which I though were very reasonable. Food was ok, but the salads ($14) with addition of Protein was cheap and was not enough for a meal. They nickel and dime you for everything.  With so many choices around I will not be coming back. Staff, flexibility with menu, food taste, and portions Are all to consider"}
{"text":"Pita Jungle=Great Success!  Love coming here, I haven't done breakfast yet but it's still on the to do list.  Today I had lunch with the family and ooo we love to go here, healthy, fun and upbeat atmosphere. Started of with their amazing iced tea-great as an arnold palmer- :) and then snacked on some jalapeno/cilantro hummus with their fresh and delicious pita bread.  I ordered my usual...the broiled chicken salad.  SOOOO yummy, full of flavor and oh so freakin' good for you-I swear!!  My brother had the spicky chicken something-looked like a giant burrito you could eat for days and was a whopping $8.50 As for mom she had a pesto chicken pizza-smaller so it's perfect for one person to share, if there are two of you plan on an appetizer or salad to share.  Daddio had something a little whacky, I forget the name but it was on the appetizer part of the menu and is really healthy for us to eat.  They looked like green leafs filled with rice and other veggies served cold and covered in an EVOO.  so good and it was $54.68 for us to have lunch (plus tip) and our server was great as well.  MUST go if you haven't been, it can get busy but don't let that get in the way :)"}
{"text":"I love this place!!!  We always get great service- whether we are in a hurry or we just want to sit back and enjoy.  My absolute favorite thing is their Baba Ganoosh the broiled eggplant puree with tahini sauce, yogurt, fresh garlic and lemon juice.-- it is the best I ever had.   I have even gone their to get it to go and took it back to Oklahoma for my family to try!!!    I am glad they are expanding-"}
{"text":"My wife and I went to this restaurant 7/2/17. We have been visiting Pita Jungle for over 10 years. We were greeted by a scantly dressed host who was very polite. I was a bit intimidated when our non-smiling waiter, who I thought was a customer since he was in street cloths, came to our table. He was not very cordial, slightly impatient, and seemed to be just going through the motions. We ordered 2 waters, an appetizer of glazed chicken pizza, and Shrimp Ajo. The pizza dough was soggy, and the chicken topping tasted like pre-cooked chicken. The shrimp was over powered with some type of citrus and had very little flavor. My wife ordered the salmon over spinach with brown rice and I ordered a Philly Steak Pita. I called my waiter over and showed him a burnt scorched substance in my pita the size of 2 quarters. In 60 seconds I got a new one but never got an apology. My wife's dish was over powered with garlic in the spinach but the salmon was perfectly cooked. Flavorless, but perfectly cooked. Our server continued to treat us indifferently, even to the point of dropping the check without asking if we wanted dessert or anything else. I told the manager about this and he apologized about it and said he would speak to the server. We will never return."}
{"text":"I love Pita Jungle expect this one. The bar is always completely dead, feel sorry for whomever bartends at this one.  If there was 1 TV to watch sports, I would literally come here 2-3 times a week.  All other pita's jungles in the valley have at least a TV.  The food is fine but we would rather drive to the downtown phx pita jungle multiple times a week for more of an atmosphere."}
{"text":"They have awesome jalapeno cilantro hummus! Their tabouleh salad was pretty good, but a little too much cilantro (yes, it's possible)."}
{"text":"Now, why haven't I hit them up for their HH before now?  $1 humus  $2 dolmaldes  $3 chicken & pine nuts  $3 glasses of wine?! (wow)  {and this wine snob actually liked both the white and red, each from Argentina.}   kids meal is $5 which includes fruit, drink, and things like pasta, chicken AND broccoli - it was a very big kids meal and extremely healthy. Alot of choices - cuz we all know how picky kids can be!   I am defiantly go back to partake of this amazing deal asap - esp now that the weather has broken and time to be outside on their patio!"}
{"text":"Very good hummus and green tea Arnold Palmer. I think their turtle cheesecake is the best I've had too. Only knock is the service could be a little better. Waited around for the waitress a little. Regardless, I'll be back and would recommend it."}
{"text":"I do love going here. The service has never been a problem for me on a late Friday or Saturday night. Even on a busy Thursday lunch, we had a great server. But I have gone to Pita Jungle for years and wish they'd add some new gluten free options. I know people say \"get a salad\" but sometimes we just want a \"real meal\" besides the hummus, chicken tikka and salad options. So I hope someday they can add some more items to the menu."}
{"text":"Love the menu!!! and great organic hefeweizen type of beer!"}
{"text":"\"Let's meet at the Chandler Pita Jungle!\" texts fiddle r dee. \"What's it near? Like the mall proper?\" I text back. \"Dobson and Ray!\" she exclaims (she's easily excitable it's pretty cute the first hundred thousand times but after that it's like wha'ev's :p) \"What the hell!?! That's not near the mall!!!\" I shout in my mind. I had no idea that there was anything else in Chandler besides that obnoxious mall, an In-n-Out Burger, and were all the house wives whose husbands aren't wealthy enough to give them houses in Scottsdale lived. I couldn't believe it. Amazing.   So I park the chrome trimmed tank and burst through the doors looking for the fiddle r and a bunch of friggin' ducks that she has been eyeballing for lunch. She urged me several times in class via text to hurry because raw duck gives her indigestion and she didn't think the proprietors would look favorably upon her preparing her own lunch on the patio (unlike the Monastery). She was ravenous and there's a fierceness that comes out when she gets that way. It would be scary if it didn't makes me giggle. Anywhodunnit, yah, a friggin' patio and with friggin' ducks! I love friggin' ducks! Oh yah, around noon this place is filled with soccer moms mostly minus their spawn but a couple of the moms stole them away from their nannies long enough to show the brats off to the other soccer moms. I imagine the conversations go a little like this, \"Look how much more better and how much more pretty my baby, I forget its name, is than your baby that you forgot its name is.\" \"oh yah, but at least my husband, I forget his name, bought me better tits than your husband, you forget his name, did.\" and then they go runnin' for the shelter of their mothers' little helper... I think this is why I wasn't really noticed when I first walked in and asked about the ducks I look nothing like these people, my soul had not been crushed by the fact that I sold my dreams for a cookie cutter cardboard existence (mostly because I sold my soul in 4th grade, a long time ago).  I finally found fiddle r at her table on the patio and exchanged glares I sat to wait another ten minutes until someone asked us if we needed help. Luckily for the staff the conversation was fairly good otherwise the fork that Ms. fiddle r was fiddling (she's an amazing fiddler) with would have ended up in someone's temple a couple of times.  When we finally received a bit of wait attention nothing on the menu jumped out at me. I was thinking lamb or pork gyro. Sad face for Howard, beef gyro for me. Fiddle r ordered the Lavosh Shwarma wrap that read like it might be the good side of yummy but I didn't want to order the same thing because I wanted to be different.  I've been to one other Pita Jungle (across from MCC in Mesa on Southern) three times in total but have never been overly impressed by them but seemed fairly competent. This one fell inline with it's sister store even with the strange beef in the gyro that I think they try to make look like lamb but in rectangular slices. WHERE IS THE FRIGGIN' LAMB!?! The exception as far as the food is concerned was the Blue Corn Nachos that fiddle r ordered for us. Someone in the kitchen dumped a bucket of goodness onto a plate and slathered it with cheesy gooey-ness! Yum! Fiddle r and I enjoyed it muchly as did the ducks. And actually ducks like a lot of things I wouldn't have thought like tomatoes, beans, beef, and chicken. I wished they served duck because that would have been hilarious.  What made this place fun was not the food (2.25-2.5 stars - I changed my mind.) and definitely not the service we received (2 stars, I wasn't even asked if I wanted another beer) it was the shaded friggin' patio located on the edge of a man-made lake-ish type water feature and the friggin' ducks and as always the friggin' company."}
{"text":"would normally give this a 5 star as I love the food and tea. They however just switched their teas and as a regular I'm so disappointed. Pita Jungle you should know better than that!! It was cheap tasting and no where near their old LOCAL tea. Bring back the tea please!!"}
{"text":"We love the food here. Good food, good prices! Only down side is everytime we order to pickup they mess up our order so double check your order before you leave. All in all... Great food!!"}
{"text":"I agree with many reviewers here that the Dobson and Ray has much better service, but no matter which location you go to, the food is always fantastic! I could live on nothing but their hummus trio. Those who say the menu gets boring need to try the specials! They are always fantastic and completely unique. Love love love this place."}
{"text":"Came in during lunch time, extremely busy!   Prices are great, paid $15 for two Pitas! Can't beat that!  Food is amazing and staff is very friendly!"}

{"text":"My niece and I meet for lunch every so often and we always choose this Pita Jungle. I have never had bad service or a bad meal there. Love the staff and the food!"}
{"text":"The wife and I love this place and have ate here too many times to count. Great salads, gyros, and pita pizzas. It's a popular and fairly healthy joint, one of the best places to get a good dinner for $10-20 I've found."}
{"text":"I love Pita Jungle...the bf on the other hand is waffling on his opinions---the first time we went to the one in tempe together we sat there for 15-20 mins and no one ever came by to take our order, bring waters or even silverware so we just left.    Sooo last night we decided to venture to the downtown location for another go together (I've been plenty of times and love it so I was super excited) and we kind of had to sit and wait again for a server....10 minutes later-not that long but no one even stopped by to tell us they'd be with us soon-once our server came by she totally ROCKED!  made me so glad that bf changed his opinions a bit, I think her name was Alisha? anyways, we had a great time just hanging out on the patio drinking wine and eating reverse happy hour, which by the way is super cheap $1-2 tappas and then drink specials as well.  we walked out of there with a bill of $26 for 2 glasses of wine, 1 beer and like 6 tappa plates :)   love the location, service and food...hopefully next time they'll jump all over us right when we sit down so bf stops teasing me about having to wait ;)"}
{"text":"Oh Pita Jungle how I love you! I had lunch here yesterday and ordered the lentil and Fetoosh salad, so yummy I love this salad. Our server suggested we try it with the chicken being Saut√© with pine nuts, delicious. I think I could eat here everyday I love it so. I do have to say I like the vibe and staff better at the Indian school location but this one is right by my house."}
{"text":"You can't really go wrong eating at A Pita Jungle but this one is by far the best. The food is always on point. It is always very fresh, consistent and delicious. I've eaten at least 75% of the menu items and the are all good. The chicken in particular is always cooked just right no matter what dish I get. I could go on and on about the food, basically it all seems to be made with passion and pride. Then there is the staff. They are always happy and attentive. I always feel welcome and appreciated. I eat out a lot and this place has everything you are looking for in a restaurant. Great healthy food, great service and at an affordable price."}
{"text":"I would have gave it zero stars but that wasn't an option.   First things first.... I am middle eastern and this is NOT the way authentic middle eastern food tastes like.  Everything was tasteless, we ordered many different entrees and everything sucked... I would NOT recommend this place to anyone who's looking to get an authentic middle eastern meal.  Disappointed!"}
{"text":"Ok seriously I don't miss Arizona but I sure in the hell miss this place. I daydream about this place....I miss everything on the menu because trust me I tried it...I was a hungry pregnant women on the prawl....besides I loved the live music and the hummus was out of this WORLD!!!  If you haven't gone....go you won't regret it...It's one of the few things about Arizona I miss....."}
{"text":"I love Pita Jungle! One of my go-tos for almost a decade now. The Med Chicken salad and Chicken Tikka Masala are my favorites, but you can't go wrong with their hummus trio. It makes me sad that a lot of my favorite servers are gone now. It just hasn't been the same, but I still love this place. Even though I moved and it's not as convenient to go there, I will make the extra trip to get their amazing food and green tea!"}
{"text":"Wow!, Tia never fails to impress!  Just to set the stage, 2 weeks prior I had been in with my lovely wife, Tia served us and the service was impeccable as always. This week I introduced a friend of mine to dining at Pita Jungle, but most importantly Tia.  She as always greeted me with a huge welcoming smile.  I sat down at the table and she asked me if I would like the wine I had from two weeks ago.  I said sure, I was blown away by her remembering that.  It doesn't end there, then she asked what I would like to eat, I explained I think I'd like what I had last time I was in, not only did she remember what I ordered but the special way that I ordered that menu item.  This type of service cannot go unrecognized and more professional servers need to understand what makes great service.   I drive by 2 Pita Jungle locations just to go experience Tia's Pita Jungle.  See ya next time Tia!"}
{"text":"I visited PJ for the first time this past week around 1:30 pm.  It was extremely busy and noisy but people seemed to be enjoying themselves.  We decided to order take-out since it was too noisy for us.  We managed to get a seat at the bar when someone left while we waited for our order.  I would not take kids here.  The bartender/waitress(?) was competent enough but dressed inappropriately - tight TIGHT top, boops hanging out - (yes, I know - you guys don't have a problem with that- but I'm a mom and trying to teach decency to my child!)  I was embarrassed as I had brought my 6 year old with me.  This is not an adult night club- so please dress more appropriately!  Food was fresh and came rather quickly considering how busy they were -  but very very messy to eat  -  I am glad I brought ours home.  I have not visited other PJ's so I do not know how this food compares."}
{"text":"Pita Jungle is where I learned that I like hummus! I never purchased hummus anywhere before eating there with some friends. My friends ordered it and I loved it. Since then, I've tried hummus many places, but I still feel that Pita Jungle has the best. Their pitas are awesome of course too!"}
{"text":"Humus is great. Very friendly and accommodating staff. My husband got the salmon and had specified it not to be over cooked and it was. Also the potatoes were quite peppery. Spinach was good though. They did adjust the bill for the overlooked salmon."}
{"text":"Last night I had an experience I wish to share involving this brand and its location.  At 9:24 PM I placed a take-out order. On the phone I was told that the order would be ready in about 20 minutes.  I knew from the numerous orders I have placed for pickup in the past this really meant 25-30 minutes but in this case it was even longer.  The meal included a vegetarian chili. When it finally arrived I noticed that the chili container felt very light so I looked inside and observed that it was about 1/3 filled with chili. I brought this to the attention of the person who I had pain that this is not the typical volume for a small order of their soups or chili. She began to say that maybe the cooks ran out when serving mine up, but then stopped herself when I think she realized that short-serving someone is not an adequate remedy to being out of a product. She took the container to the cooks while I remained up front by the register. She returned and told me that the cooks were going to heat up more of the product and add it to what was in the container.    Again, I waited probably an additional 10 minutes until one of the servers then brought me the container. This time it was wrapped in a bag with a knot tied in it.  This seemed unusual to me so I had the intuition to not just accept the bag the way he handed it to me but instead place my hand against the container - it was ice-cold; clearly frozen chili was was simply taken from the refrigerator and dumped on top of the warm chili in an effort of the staff to essentially say to me \"screw you.\" They knew they were closing and were probably assuming I would be long gone before I realized what kind of crap they pulled.  I instructed the server to feel the temperature of the container and advised him that I was not pleased with what I had been dealing with there.  I told him to forget trying to make anything right at that point. I did so because there was no telling what the next level of retribution would be against me (through my food they were serving me) because of my complaints.  I took photos of it as soon as I got home and as you can all see the temp was so low that it wouldn't give a numeric reading on the thermometer.  I threw it out because I realized I had no idea if there could have been anything else done to it  This is the first time I had ever written anything on Yelp - for anything.  So I would ask Pita Jungle if they think this is funny. Does your company have investors? Would they think its okay that your staff pranks the food that your customers eat?   Would the Arizona Board of Health be okay with your staff pranking the food your customers eat? I'm a physician; how could I ever trust what you feed me again, or recommend to anyone else that they trust what you feed them?   Oh, I'm sure the readers will get the typically placation response but to me this falls flat on its face. You've got a problem over there that's going to affect your brand. Your cooking staff is unprofessional and immature and your management is either encouraging it or ignoring it. This is a problem, a big problem.  Over the last few years I have spent a lot of money at your establishment but this was just too much this time for you to keep my business."}
{"text":"Great healthy lunch option. Love the open floor plan of this location. I really enjoys their specials and rotating menu. The super green and fennel salad is delicious!"}
{"text":"Very good food.  Incredible kid meals...  Finally a place that offers kids a real meal.    Seems to be busier during the week and a little slow on weekends so easier to get a table on Saturdays!"}
{"text":"Yuk! It's probably one of the worst meals I've had at Fashion Square. I always get the gyros at the PV mall and they are amazing! I figured I'd give Pita jungle try at Fashion square and I could barely get through the meal. The beef was dry and the pita it was on was so stale making it hard to bite through. I'm not sure what it was but I asked for lemonade and it tasted unlike any other lemonade I had before. What a waste of 10 dollars!"}
{"text":"Love this place!!! I always get their Jalape√±o hummus with cucumbers and grilled chicken to go! They always have it ready when I get there and it's always perfect!"}
{"text":"The food here is AMAZING! The grilled chicken is some of the best I've ever found. I enjoyed the lentil and rice and everything else I've had. I give the food 5 stars, but over all only 4 since the service isn't always 5 stars. Never terrible or anything like that but some servers are nicer than others. I keep going back and I will continue to."}
{"text":"The food is generally good here, I especially like there happy hour menu it's fun to order a bunch of Tapas. NT"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat and have eaten here for years! Came in tonight and tried the Island Shrimp Pizza. Should have stuck to one of my other favs, it was bland. Shrimp had no flavor, and ways to much cheese, and not enough sauce. I would recommend a drizzle on top of the pizza. Next time I might try the Spicy Mango Shrimp. Just hard to try new things. They do have the best Cilantro Jalape√±o Hummus ever. Happy hour is awesome also. Hummus and Pita for $1. Who does that? They do!!!!"}
{"text":"It's a great, hip, vegetarian-friendly restaurant.  Their hummus with chicken, in particular, is amazing.  I don't know if it's their huge portion sizes or rich ingredients, but I always feel heavy after eating here.  If I had more self control -- did I mention how amazing their hummus is? -- then maybe I would just eat a little less and take the rest home."}
{"text":"For years, Pita Jungle been one of our go-to favorite casual places. Lately the food has not always been as consistent. Unless Josh is there. He always makes sure the food is perfectly cooked and served to our liking. Ask for Josh!!"}
{"text":"10/17/2017 Yelp review Pita Jungle 4 E University Dr., Tempe, AZ 85281 (480)804-0234   I found this restaurant through Yelp because the photos of foods were so amazing. The pita Jungle offers a healthful and natural cuisine and vegetarian options. The foods there have the feature of Mediterranean diet which balances green, grains, legumes, meets, and fruits. The most recommendations are pitas and wraps. There are no unhealthy foods like hamburgers or chips. Even pizza, the chief will add lots of vegetables into it. Customers can order any foods with low calories. Only one thing need to mention is the Pita Jungle doesn't have any drinks except special cocktails and mixed-drinks. That also the only thing I'm not satisfied with. However, the waiters will give you a cup of ice water if you don't want to drink cocktails. It's more important for me to eat something which look like very pretty. At first, I was attracted by the photos the past customers posted. When I went to there, I just hold the picture and told the waiter what I wanted to order without reading the menu. The result was it was pretty dishes indeed. The chief tried to present the best state of the foods. Whatever the taste or appearance, it was perfect for me.   The restaurant's furniture looks like a bar with tables in different size and open kitchen. Every table has a little candle lamp which adds a feeling of romance for the whole place. There are lots of graffities on the wall with animals, landscapes, and unique symbols. They make these small room to be a visual art. When you sit there, you can look around these paintings and wait the foods sent to you. In the middle of the room, there were some shelves showing the typical foods in this restaurant and some organic vegetables and fruits. In my opinion, it will be better if the restaurant can play some light music.  I only came once. The waiter gave me the menu immediately when I sat on the chair even through there were so many customers at that moment. The restaurant only had 5-6 waiters and waitress, but they did a good job which controlled the time from order to dish up in 20 minutes for every consumer. However, I found that it's hard to call the waiters if I had any problems, because they didn't wear staff uniforms. When it met the peak time, the customers couldn't tell waiters apart from the crowds. So, I just waited at the seat or rose my hand to attract the waiters' attention. Or maybe it was not suitable for the employees wearing the same clothes. After all, it is a restaurant with special characteristics which is not a traditional dinner place. I suggest that the waiters and waitress can wear the same hat or have the same label on their clothes which can be easily classified.   And about the price there. It's quite an ordinary-price place. Everyone can cost $10-$20 per time for a great lunch. For example, the classic pita is about $8 each one. The vegetarian sides are less than $4. The price of drinks is $5-$7. It is a good place to have meal with friends. I will go there again and tell this restaurant to others."}
{"text":"Pita Jungle would land somewhere around the 3.5 star area, which is generous in some regards and possibly misleading in others. The food and prices are fair; the service was prompt and friendly - but I still can't walk away from Pita Jungle with the devotion of a fan. Before I go forward, I'd like to state that the prices are from the website, as I cannot recall the exact prices upon purchase.  I had the falafel pita ($5.49) and a glass of Green tea. The girlfriend  ordered a philly steak pita ($6.79). The Falafel at Pita Jungle was good, but not the finest I've had. Regardless, we got a few extra things from the happy hour menu, which runs from 3PM to 5PM, if I recall correctly. The pita and hummus platter was affordable ($2) and tasty, offering three flavors of hummus and a decent amount of pita to dip with. The happy hour Falafel ($2) offered two pieces of chick pea goodness to enjoy.  Pita Jungle offered me a tasty lunch, but it didn't fill me with an insatiable desire to return. Given the fact that it provided what it aimed for, and didn't turn me off in the process, it's certainly A-OK."}
{"text":"Oh I wish I could give half stars. This is a solid 3-1/2 star restaurant with interesting menu options and decent service.   I have enjoyed all of the menu items that I have sampled. The spicy garlic humus is the bomb and the item I have had most often. With each visit the service I have received has been consistent."}
{"text":"That damn no 1/2 star system strikes again. If it were in place, I'd give our experience this location a solid 2.5 stars.   On the drive there, we contemplated Crazy Jim's but decided to give this location a whirl in hopes of it outshining it's sister spots.   For starters, this is the cleanest version of any location I've visited (Chandler, Tempe, Arcadia). I agree that the interior decor doesn't really match the vibe but it's nice and the patio has plenty of room with proper seating.   Down to business: The service was the BEST we've ever experienced at any location. Our server was sweet, attentive and helpful; just the right blend. She deserves 5 stars; and that's so rare for Downtown service.   The food: salty, messy, blah creations we could've whipped up better versions of at home.   Roasted Red Pepper Hummus and Pita: It had been over a year since my last PJ visit and since then I've become quite the regular at Crazy Jim's. I literally spit out the hummus and pita in the most ladylike fashion imaginable; I couldn't even eat it. Once you get used to real, homemade pita, this store-bought version won't cut it. The hummus was over blended, bland and salty. Crazy Jim's is flavorful, chunky and fresh. I was instantly sad we placed our whole order at once, otherwise we would've cashed out and headed straight there.   Dolmades: the flavor was sort of there (it helped \"soak up\" the salty hummus left in my mouth), it was missing something but I couldn't quite pin it and they were pretty messy. I'm used to them all being tight, perfect cigar rolls, even fresh-made same day.   Salmon entree with garlic mashed potatoes and wilted spinach: My first version was a salt bomb. I ate about 3 bites and super nice server got me a new one. It took about 15 min (rightfully so) and the new one looked NOTHING like the old one and tasted like actual salmon, spinach and potatoes. Plenty of food for leftovers. Again, nothing spectacular but good enough.   (Husband) Turkey pesto lavosh wrap: Meh. I was underwhelmed and kind of annoyed he ordered something we could've made at home; only our version would have had better quality deli turkey. Theirs uses that \"slimy\" deli turkey...not a fan and barely a pesto flavor.   Overall, for $45 for 2, the experience simply wasn't worth it. I enjoyed the patio and could see returning for a beer or glass of wine but certainly not the food. There's just not enough attention to the ingredients or consistency. Next time I want cafe style Greek/Mediterranean, I'm heading to Crazy Jim's."}
{"text":"Always sooooo good. The portions at this location aren't as gargantuan as the original location, but still a great deal and super yummy. Love love love"}
{"text":"This place has the healthiest kids meals around and my kiddos enjoy eating it despite its healthiness. As for my husband and I, we love the humus & chicken and cheese & fruit fantasia. We also enjoy the atmosphere. It's fun to see the artwork of different featured artist displayed there. And for whatever reason we like the way the servers are allowed to wear their own style of clothing. I guess it makes it feel like a creative and yummy place to eat."}
{"text":"Went there last night before a play at the Herberger. Arrived at 7, got a table right away as they were only a few patrons at the time. Did not get a waitress until 7:15 only because I had to stick my head out of the booth to look for one. This redhead said \"Oh, I guess I have this table now.\"-wow- really welcoming. We gave her our order and waited... and waited. She finally came over at 7:30 and told us there was a \"mix-up\" in the kitchen and they were getting our order fixed now. We asked how much longer, as our play was at 8:00. She said she would find out, but never got back to us. In the meantime, other customers who were seated AFTER us were getting their food! We spoke with the manager Dustin at 7:40 when our order finally showed up at the window. He said he had no idea what happened; as the manager he SHOULD have \"an idea\" of what happened and should have come to our table to let us know."}
{"text":"Eat here weekly and is consistently great. My cardiologist has me on a crazy restrictive diet that limits me to no grain of any kind, no diary, and no processed sugar in addition to watching my sodium intake. And you can imagine this limits what I can eat significantly when going out. Thanks Pita Jungle for actually having several options that fit the bill and are tasty to boot."}
{"text":"I recently went to this location for the first time for a work lunch. Given that we have a party of 12 and it was lunchtime, I was surprised by how quickly we were able to get in and out. The srvice was pretty standard for Pita Jungle... Very apathetic. On the other hand, I loved the portobello pizza! It's not super easy to find since it is tucked away in a plaza and the layout is a bit more cramped, but overall a positive experience!"}
{"text":"I have never been disappointed here! The happy hour tapas menu is amaaaaaaazing (although the hours aren't the best), but the full menu is pretty awesome as well! Love the vegan info on the website, and I love that the staff will help you figure out awesome substitutions.   Definitely hipster but the food is excellent and the people are fun!"}
{"text":"After 5 or 6 trips to this location, I can't say I've had a bad meal though service was slow on a couple of occasions.  I love the hummus, they have a few different kinds and you really can't go wrong with any of them, baba ganoosh is delicious, spanakopita, lentil salad, black bean burger, veggie garden wrap - all really good choices.  Falafel pita is awesome but the hummus and tabbouleh pita is outrageous.  They give you big portions of hummus and tabbouleh with a pita on the side, it's the one leftover I consistently eat.  My husband raved about the Gambas Con Ajo.  I would like the option of a whole wheat pita and I wish they were warm when they are served on the side but that's really just my Pita Jungle wish list, not a complaint.  The parking is good here too so that's another plus."}
{"text":"Great service and yummy food! Wonderful outdoor seating for groups and friendly kid service. Fun place to hang with friends!"}
{"text":"Always satisfying! Never been disappointed by this place! Red pepper hummus is my fav & I used to be addicted to the philly chicken love it! Always fresh!! Lemonade is perfection!"}
{"text":"We went early because we had my 12yr old, two six year old girls and a baby, plus my spouse - were celebrating anniversary. Ordered 10 of the Tapas items which are $2 to $3 each. Hummus, garlic dip, scallops were the best. Mussels were obviously low-grade frozen (two for $2), shrimp was just okay, felafel was okay. Kids meals were healthy - not the standard chicken fingers and fries. Kids need to be ready for veggies, cous cous and my kids had veggie burger patties which they liked. In fact, all three kids said they really liked the place and want to go back.  Now the main meals good to bad: my son's philly cheesesteak on flatbread was terriffic, my wife's fish was badly overcooked & had to be replaced, and my Gyro was surprisingly bland & luke warm. I ordered Gyro to see how well they do a standard Med style dish, like ordering spaghetti & meatballs at an Italian place. I was really surprised how mediocre it was. I wanted something hot, fresh and with terrific gyro sauce. This isn't going to be your NYC street-corner delicious Gyro that's for sure.   This experience would've been worse but service was excellent. Our young server didn't get flustered with a whole gaggle of kids to deal with, in fact there were at least three other families there. The manager came over to personally deal with my wife's poor fish dish and replaced it promptly. Overall I would give it another shot  but I'm not expecting the most fabulous food from this place. Maybe the kitchen was just having an off night, but since the family was treated right I'm pretty happy."}
{"text":"Stephanie that runs the bar, is the bomb! Her boss should be so proud! She runs the bar, phones, take away orders with a breeze! Pls her customer service is awesome! Thanks Steph! We had a great time with you!"}
{"text":"The food here is really fresh, but the place is busy. Leave time to get a seat but you'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"I went here again and the experience was much better. Food was pretty good and sitting on the patio is nice when it's cool"}
{"text":"I love Pita jungle- fresh, delicious, and healthy food! It is a great alternative to all the junk food near ASU."}
{"text":"Go here often for take out. My food is always amazing, ready when I request it and the staff is friendly."}
{"text":"Blake and Liz where amazing!!! We had such a good time and the food was amazing  thanks Liz for being so great to us!"}
{"text":"I just love this place. One of my favorites. The happy hour menu is great and the tapas are amazing . Their hummus chicken is off the charts .You can't go wrong with any of them. The atmosphere is so funky and fun. YOU MUST TRY THE PINEAPPLE INFUSED MARGARITA . It is like nothing I've ever had before....simply delicious . We always sit at the bar because the service is great and the girls are so friendly . I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I love the pita sandwiches here, especially the Philly Steak Pita, but for the price they charge, they should at least come with a side.  The sandwich looks lonely on the plate with not even a garnish to accompany it.  The filling is tasty and juicy, however if you don't remove it from the foil (which is meant to keep it warm), the steam will make the pita too soft and it will fall apart on you. My favorite side is the garlic potatoes, unfortunately I have never gotten them HOT, always half luke-warm, half cold, and let's face it, they don't seem like they were cooked in the last hour.  The last one I had, had plenty of garlic, however half of it was raw, which made the whole dish bitter. It is nice that they have varieties of Ice Tea, however they don't have regular ice tea as an option. Located in a rehabilitated building, the location is convenient to downtown, but has limited parking, and is always busy.  If you manage to get in without waiting, consider yourself lucky."}
{"text":"You can always count on the food being fresh and tasty with a large variety to choose from so you rarely get bored with the menu. The atmosphere is casual and the bathrooms are always super clean! I do have to say that the reason I did not give this location 5 stars is due to the service. It can be hit or miss. Tonight it was great but can be slow at times. It is a fairly small location so I'm not too sure where the wait staff disappears to but when you need silverware or a drink refill it can be frustrating to wait for your server to appear in the dining room to check in you. This is definitely one of my favorite healthy eating choices."}
{"text":"My server Shelby was AMAZING! Best service, and amazing food!!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place for anytime of the day with friends or family or just for take out!! You won't be disappointed at all!!!!"}
{"text":"Another great experience at Pita Jungle!  I've been here many times, but hadn't written a review until today.  We started off with a mix plate of roasted bell pepper hummus, jalapeno/cilantro hummus and baba ganoosh.  It came with two pitas and all three were very tasty!  Next up was the broiled chicken salad. Very tasty and the lemon vinaigrette dressing was delicious!  My friend tried the lavosh shawarma warp and enjoyed it very much.  The garlic sauce makes that wrap!  Our server, Skyler was excellent as well.  Everything just when you expected it.  Made many suggestions that applied to what we were ordering.  Genuinely gave a damn about what he was doing. Last but not least, offered up \"to-go\" drinks at the end of our meal.  Not in any way trying to get us to leave, just a nice touch before leaving.  Other things that may or may not matter to anyone reading this: It has a nice patio and open floor plan inside. Keep in mind it's directly across the street from Mesa Community College.  I notice all different kinds of people when dining here.  It adds to the whole experience for me.  I'm not hung up on clothing choices or body art my server(s) wear, as long as they are doing a great job.  Will I continue to go here?  Absolutely!"}
{"text":"Fun, delicious, reasonably priced. Nice, clean atmosphere. Great location. Portobella burger is tasty and the hummis is awesome!"}
{"text":"Great place for hummus. Their broiled chicken salad is also amazing with a lemon vinaigrette. Although, this location has a very hectic and small parking lot."}
{"text":"Ordered 3 items. Only received two but paid for three. Really frustrating. Go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Beyond impressed with the manager that was so generous and helpful. I had placed an order over the phone which was not ready when I arrived nor could they find my order. The manager offered me a complimentary glass of wine while I waited and then gave me my meal free because it was a pretty busy evening! I was shocked and thrilled with the service I always get when I go to this location :) as always my favorite is the hummus trio with chicken!"}
{"text":"Chicken combo platter is where it's at.  Light healthy food.  It's high in my rotation"}
{"text":"Yum! stopped here randomly and was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food and service.   Pro tip: Get the mahi and pita chips! You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Perfect service. Always a great place to eat! had Dylan as my server he made us great cocktails, an Acai Shandy and a Prickly Pear Lemonade. The cocktails made our horrible movie at the movie fest a little better. :) We also love Josh Berk he always hooks it up fatty style.. Josh really hooks it up. So does Bill."}
{"text":"Went here recently and forgot how much I loved this place. I would eat just the baba ganoush. Chicken curry salad yummmmm. Sorry this is not the deepest review but I just love their food. If only they were closer to where we live, this would be our go-to 'we don't wanna cook tonight' place and we'd be a lot healthier than the pizza-and-wings place that's currently our go-to!"}
{"text":"Pita Jungle, although a chain restaurant, rarely disappoints me.  Does it have the finest food, probably not, but it caters to the varied, like me, who want to have the choice of having a decent meal with no meat.  So, I had one of my favorites, One Thousand Beans, which is definitely a two meal dish.  Leftovers will go well with scrambled eggs or egg whites.  Le bf had the salmon burger and he so obviously was satisfied because he said so.  He ordered us up a bowl of vanilla yogurt for dessert but since the waiter said it was just a scoop he said \"give us two.\"   Well, it was way more than just a scoop (see picture).  There is a yogurt store right or almost beside this PJ so maybe they have a cooperative thing going on (wouldn't that be nice and novel) and they run over to the yogurt store for this dessert.  Oh, and I should mention that the was service good.  Our waiter was extremely personable in a genuine way.  I am giving this PJ in Chandler 5 stars because it was, all in all, a good dining experience."}
{"text":"I love Babaganoush, and it's been hard to find  some that is traditional, smoky and not overly seasoned. And now, with Pita Jungle,  I have a place to satisfy my cravings fairly close to home! I can't believe in all the years we've lived here, I haven't been to a single Pita Jungle. I actually thought it was more of a fast food place, order at the counter, rush, rush, rush.  I have never been so happy to be so wrong!  Honestly, everything we had for lunch was fantastic! Hubby had an ahi salad which was sublime with the ahi seared to perfection. I had the hummus and ahi. Simply divine.  I would never have put the two items together, but it worked for me -- two of my favorite foods on one plate. I agree with all the reviewers about the hummus here -- probably the creamiest I have ever had with a delightful flavor that I could pair with anything now.  I wanted some baba but didn't want to order an entire appetizer size, so our very helpful server brought out a side dish of it . . . yum! Had we not been heading to Costco for some groceries, I would have taken some to go!  The seating options are many - dine inside at a table, banquet or communal high top, or dine al fresco. You couldn't miss sitting in any of those locations, although, if you want a little more quiet, I'd recommend sitting on the patio. Service was great and you could see that the managers were watching with a close eye.  There will be many meals, both eat in and takeout, in our future with Pita Jungle."}
{"text":"Good thing they are expanding to several locations. Try their ready made hummus. My favorite is the spicy chicken wrap which is huge!"}
{"text":"I've been hooked on Pita Jungle for years, that's why I want to write about their decision to replace real Sriracha sauce with a house brand that either hasn't been taste tested or just plain tastes bad.  I'm a hot chili sauce fanatic, especially for Sriracha and Cholula. A few weeks ago our server at Pita Jungle delivered private label green and red hot sauces to our table. The name brand Sriracha was gone. The taste is awful - of both, but my main complaint is the red which I like to eat with baba ganoush.  Additionally, the bottle is some cheap, unsqeezable plastic that takes 2 hands to operate, so you can't exactly put some on a bite while you're eating. The taste is vinegary, without the wonderful nuanced blend of chilis in name brand Sriracha.  For hot sauce lovers, this is quite a negative and, in my opinion, a bad business decision on Pita Jungle's part, akin to a hamburger place deciding they're spending too much on ketchup and starting to bottle their own. To me, a restaurant should do what they do well (cook) and buy their condiments. It's forced me to give up their baba ganoush though, on the bright side, I'm now eating their cilantro jalapeno hummus which requires no accompaniment.   But, honestly, bring back the name brand Sriracha."}
{"text":"Most everything I have had here has been delicious.  The coconut curry soup is amazing. I get it with the spinach and cheese quesadilla and it is a great combination. Their hummus is delicious, too and you have to try the tropical tea.  Can't wait for my next visit. The host is also a really nice guy and has always been very friendly when we were waiting for a table."}
{"text":"Love Pita Jungle but my experience at this location was horrible...got my order wrong and was just a very unpleasant experience....the lady at the table next to me returned her order because she found a hair in it...gross...  They also have out of date information on their website....looked at their online  brunch menu before I went but when I got there, the menu was different and they didn't have the dish I wanted. Epic Fail."}
{"text":"The food was fantastic, I was quite surprised to find the atmosphere to be so comfortable. I would highly recommend this place to anyone, even though the food is very pricey for what you get. I've been to other Pita Jungles and they're all pretty similar, this one was the best experiences though. Waitress was attentive and kind, and answered questions thoroughly and nice. If you're on the edge, I recommend this Pita Jungle for dinner tonight."}
{"text":"Very bad customer service. We went in at lunch time and the service was horrible and the food was even worse. I will not be back pita jungle."}
{"text":"Huge fan of Pita Jungle, and this is my favorite of the locations I have been to. The location is in a strip with a movie theatre, sushi bar, book store with a coffee shop, and a couple of bars so you can make a night of it.   Oh yeah, and the food is awesome!"}
{"text":"Went to visit pita jungle gave the restaurant another try .I got there beef gyro was very tasty .aBit noisy for me can not hear myself think .Very busy that the waitresses seem over whelm to me. That they just want to take your order and go forward. So they can sit more people down to eat. Either then that this time was alittle better. The food was good."}
{"text":"Service is just so hit and miss. We stopped in today to get a to go order at about 2:15 and waited for a half an hour. Then they got our order wrong. If my wife didn't like their Med salad I would not be back. The food, in my opinion is average at best. Service is inconsistent and the bad experiences out weigh the good experiences."}
{"text":"Ordered the spicy chicken wrap.  I never expected it to be spicy curry.  Very disappointed.  You need to explain it is curry spice in the description.   This is one of the few times in my life I ordered a meal I could not eat.  Two bites and threw it in the trash.  I had taken it to go so I could not complain to you in person.  Yuck!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Every time I order one thing, I see all the other plates coming out and think \"oh, next time I will have to try that one!\"   Everything is fresh and so tasty!  Service is overall good. My one complaint (keeping me from 5 stars) is sometimes the music is played a bit too loud making conversation difficult."}
{"text":"Having been to several of the Pita Jungles around the valley (corporate and franchised locations) it looks like the owners have refined their formula for future growth.  While this location lacks some of the funkiness of other, more intimate Jungle spots, it seems this version will be the template for large-scale  Jungle world domination.  The space has ample seating, a good sized bar area and a large patio for Phoenix-style al fresco dining (which,unfortunately, typically means a lovely view of the parking lot).   What sets this location apart, however, is Sam!  If you have the chance, ask for this dude to take care of you.  Sam is perhaps the most accommodating server we've had anywhere in some time.  He even handled my mom (the prototypical high maintenance, special order customer) with aplomb and grace.  He was on the spot and his attitude and knowledge of the menu were exeptional. In all honesty, we may have enjoyed his service as much as the meal, which was the consistently fresh and tasty Jungle fare.   We have only one recommendation for improvement: please. please, please stop serving gyro meat of the stamped and pre-sliced variety.  Good gyros mean meat shaved off the spit (like those found at Haji-Baba in Tempe). Aside from this soap box admonition, score another win for PJ in Ahwatukee."}
{"text":"This was my 1st visit to Pita Jungle and even though I had seen ads for it; I had not given it a try. It is very busy at lunch and seems to draw a good crowd. I had the hummus plate and a Gyro and a lemonade. The hummus was as fresh as you could get and I am sure it did not have the chemicals or preservatives you get with store bought hummus. I could not even finish the gyro which I will split with someone next time I go. The lemonade was fresh too, but very tart. I think I will go with tea next time the acid in the lemonade did not agree with me. The service was fast and friendly. Overall if you are looking for healthy alternatives this is the place."}
{"text":"The food here is so tasty.  I like that they have a large variety of choices and that many of the choices are not found in typical restaurants.  The thing I like about this location in particular is that it is by a lake.  The view out the window is relaxing."}
{"text":"Have been to all the Pita jungle in the valley but always I find this location serving and presenting the food really different than others....service is as well really excellent out here compared to other locations....other location I will rate 1 out of 5....love visiting the Scottsdale location....I get falafel with tahini sauce with some cilantro garnishing only at this location than others..."}
{"text":"This is the most beautiful location.  I really don't mind the parking, although I do like to go a little earlier or later than the typical lunch hour.  I love all locations of PJ!"}
{"text":"I had the hummus sampler and the glazed chicken pizza. I split it with another person and it was delicious. The atmosphere was good, we ate at the bar and the place was fairly busy at lunchtime. I'll go back again."}
{"text":"I don't think I've had a dish from pita jungle that I didn't like. I started with a simple gyro and really love the simple flavors that come together to make a delicious pita. I've even ventured over to their salads and specials and really like their micro plate - everything I need, everything delicious all on one plate. This location has a very convenient to go window that makes it ideal to call and pick up an order for lunch."}
{"text":"Was in town for business so looked up Yelp for dinner suggestions around Tempe.  For a late night this is probably heathier than others.  I like the high ceiling industrial look of the place, but when it gets crowded the high ceiling makes it VERY loud.  Some describe it as \"hip\" and \"young\" and it is since it is around ASU.  The staff was very friendly and attentive though, not flaky.  The manager is really cute too ;)  I sat at the bar in front of the open kitchen and enjoyed watching them like a  machine moving fast and smooth.  Like!  Very friendly staff and fast service.  The food, oh the food!  Not that I have tons of experience in Mediteranian food, but it was good!  I had the grilled veggie salad and loved every bite.  It has the grilled flavor plus tangy salad dressing.  Everything on the menu looked great.  Must return to try them all :)"}
{"text":"Their food is healthy and reasonably priced. I usually get a gyro and a hummus and pita plate when I go. Its delicious and has a chill atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Friendly service. Ordered the Veggie burro. Should have gotten 3 friends to help me finish it."}
{"text":"Ordered blackbean burger anf falafel salad. Food was ok and lacked proper seasoning. But the ambience and service was really great and worth coming for again."}
{"text":"I didn't have the best experience the first time I went here but I changed my review star after seeing how attentive and awesome customer service the management had, they go above and beyond in trying to make your your experience at pita jungle more that expected.  Yes I will go back ,  we all have bad days, stress, etc..."}
{"text":"DO NOT GO HERE!!! Got food poisoning from this location. So sad loved pita jungle too."}
{"text":"Great Mediterranean food.  They do the classics well and come up with great original dishes.  I eat here all the time, sit down and take out.  Service is always good."}
{"text":"Some of my coworkers and I decided to do a takeout order for lunch. We picked up our orders and took them back to the office, when my coworker noticed she did not receive half of her order. I ordered the Mediterranean Chicken Schwarma Pita and took one bite and noticed MULTIPLE HAIRS  sticking out of my schwarma, as I spit out my food I grabbed the strands of hair to realize that is was a an entire HAIRBALL in my gyro. I will never order food from establishment ever again."}
{"text":"Great service, large portions. We love thw hummus and gyro wrap. Ice tea is amazing! The outdoor patio is awesome during the cooler months, and they do have a happy hour menu. Plenty of parking all the time."}
{"text":"We were incredibly disappointed with our experience here. We had a friend visiting from out of town and last Saturday decided we'd like to check out a new happy hour around town. We saw that Pita Jungle's happy hour looked pretty promising and waited an extra hour to go out to eat so we could get there at the beginning of happy hour (3pm). Note that this location (Ahwatukee) opened in the beginning of March, and the information on the restaurant website has still not been updated to include this location. We arrived around 3pm and were sort of greeted by the hostess. When we asked for our party of four to be seated on the near-empty patio, she made the \"I'm sorry\" face and proceeded to explain that all the tables out there are two-tops. The plastic, easily-movable tables. We waited for a couple seconds longer for her to say \"Well, I can see if we can work something out.\"  You do that. Don't think too hard.  While we were waiting we looked at the menu and found out that THIS location doesn't do a weekend happy hour. Thanks for updating that website. We almost decided to leave and come back another time, definitely wish we would have done that, but we were pretty darn hungry at this point. After pushing two tables together the hostess came back inside and grabbed four menus, then proceeded to greet another group, then flirt with a co-worker, THEN say \"you can come with me\" to our party with barely a glance in our direction.   We were seated in the very far corner of the large patio, as far away from the door into the restaurant as possible. I imagine this came into play later with our terrible service. Our server came, got our drink and app orders, and did well to check on the apps when we were about halfway through them. Our friend got a strawberry banana smoothie and it was delicious. We ordered the baba ghanoush as we were promised that it was extra smoky, and we love it that way. When it arrived we were surprised to find a pile of lumpy, stringy eggplant that clearly needed another round or two in the food processor. The texture was gross to the point where my SO couldn't eat it, and she is usually crazy about baba ghanoush. It was smoky, however. Our friend ordered the stuffed grape leaves, and they were fine. Comparable to what you would be served at a fast food Mediterranean place - definitely nothing special.  For our entree we ordered the black bean burger. We have had the burger once before (take-out from the Arcadia location) and liked it, but it is SO mushy and hard to eat as a burger. It just falls apart very quickly. We like the cranberries in the burger, very nice touch. The toppings both last time and this time were disappointing - the onions were cut so thickly that the taste of onion took over and it was hard to enjoy the burger. The tomato slice was incredibly thick and included part of the hard center near the stem (again, both last time and this time) and we had to do a lot of doctoring to enjoy the toppings.   Here is where we started to be severely unimpressed. While we were eating our entrees, our server was no where to be seen. Not once did she return to the table until about 15 minutes AFTER we were finished eating. During the meal we had to ask a hostess to refill our four empty waters, and then another server to refill another one later on. At the end of the meal, after we had been sitting for quite a while, we finally had to ask another server if our server was still around. She replied \"Well, I hope so!\" and went to find her. It should be noted again that this was about 4:00 on a Saturday afternoon. It was NOT busy and there were plenty of waitstaff. Our server eventually showed up looking a little sheepish and took our plates. We asked for the bill and lo and behold, it took another five minutes to get the bill out to us. We didn't even consider waiting to have her come back outside to pick up the credit cards - we just walked them into the front desk. We had written clearly on the back of the receipt how much should go on one credit card and how much to put on the second. After waiting for the hostess to track down our server to run the cards, we got them back to find that she had gotten the amounts correct, but the cards switched around. Really? Really?  Yeah...we won't ever be coming back. Left feeling disappointed and frustrated at having spent any money on this dining experience.  EDIT: Changed to three stars. After our last review we were contacted and given $25 credit at the Ahwatukee location. We returned for happy hour since that was our original plan. Our server was fantastic, very attentive and positive, fun to talk with (didn't tell them about our credit until the end). We had a hard time spending $25 at Happy Hour with all the $1-$3 tapas. Good margaritas for $3.50. We had all the vegetarian tapas and they were delicious. The only thing we'll still be staying away from is the grape leaves -unimpressive both times. We'll be back, but probably only for happy hour."}
{"text":"This place was a real find for us!  If you like Mediterranean food, excellent service and a varied menu, this is the place for you too. I never even liked hummus until I tried their's, try the cilantro/jalapeno, and their fruit/cheese plates are fresh and plentiful!   I've had better gyro's, but I'm really a fan of this place.  Great for lunch or dinner, prices are in line with any other sit down restaurant."}
{"text":"If your are going to sit in the restaurant and eat, it's very good. But this place could care less about people who phone in orders or order through a delivery service.   I ordered through uber-eats one night. My driver showed up to the restaurant within 5 minutes. They let the driver sit there for 45 minutes while helping every customer who walked through the door.   I know this because I actually showed up to the place thinking my order had been lost or forgotten. I waited with the driver for more than 30 minutes while the restaurant let delivery drivers stack up.   The way they prioritize people and then ignore others is terrible. This place is the worst for service and I wouldn't recommend anyone to eat here even if it were free."}
{"text":"I come here often with friends.  I always want the salads here but the chef's knife skills are seriously lacking as far as cutting the lettuce into properly portioned pieces. Instead you get lettuce that is half the size of an entire leaf and makes for an unenjoyable lettuce experience.  I had the gyro today and it was absolutely wonderful, beautiful complimentary flavours and a perfect portion.  Check out their website for nutritional info on each item, the beef gyro in this case had about 1800 mg of sodium but it was worth it.  Def reccomend, I keep going here with friends. Try the passion tea!  Also, this place is always packed and very noisy."}
{"text":"What you'd expect from a chain Mediterranean (?) restaurant.  It's good, but not authentic or amazing.   Just wish they had a full bar like the one downtown."}
{"text":"If you are ever having a hard time choosing from their menu, you can never go wrong with the black bean burger.  It is to die for."}
{"text":"Food is always amazing.no matter the location. Service is hit or miss. Today was great. First visit in a year though because it was so bad in the past."}
{"text":"I don't usually yelp but because of what I saw I felt I had to write something. This message is for Mark in the Bar area, you need to not be so rude to customers that pick up deliveries. I was in the bar area when 2 delivery people came in and you didn't smile, greet or even thanked them for coming in. As a business owner myself  i know how important it is to treat your customers with respect and kindness. If you acted like that at my business you would not last unless your attitude changed. I hope this gets to your boss so that they can do something about it. As much as I love the food I will not be returning to this Pita Jungle."}
{"text":"Now here's a place to eat healthy and sustainably.  Everything on the menu is good, so just order it. -My grandma prefers to watch other people's fabulous plates go by until she see's one that looks like entirely too much fun.   I like musing about how the wait-staff choose their ensembles for the day and looking at the rotating gallery of art on the walls."}
{"text":"I've eaten at this location several times and always had a great experience.  The servers are prompt and friendly, food is always great (and served at the correct temperatures) and the restaurant is clean.  I recently used them to cater a small party at my house and was very impressed.  The food was great and they packaged everything to make it easier for me to re-platter.  The serving sizes were generous and everything tasted amazing.  Will definitely use their catering services again."}
{"text":"I frequent Pita Jungle and it is always exceptionally good but yesterday 4/27 I went there with my Aunt.  We ordered the Cauliflower tahini to share. I ordered the Gyro and my Aunt ordered the Chicken Shwarma wrap. We both said at the same time that the Cauliflower tahini was the best one ever and I have had many many orders of it and all of them delicious but yesterday's WOW!  So good!  I have never had a complaint at any of the Pita Jungles. Just rave reviews. The staff are always friendly and orders come quickly.  I'm going back today for another order! The only small complaint is it gets noisy."}
{"text":"The Pita Jungle management is really trying their best to remedy my experience and I am appreciative. Thank you."}
{"text":"Excellent service, food simple, nutritious and appealing presentation. Highly recommend experience"}
{"text":"Such a good choice on so many levels. Outdoor water front dining, very good food with healthy options and well prices across the board. Try the jalape√±o hummus."}
{"text":"I really love the vibe of this place. Sometimes I come just for a drink and some dessert. I want to say in the last year I've been here at least 10 times. The staff is always friendly, the drinks are always good, and the food is great."}
{"text":"Decent place in the heart of Mesa. They have a wide variety of food and drinks. Service was good and food arrived timely. Solid 4."}
{"text":"As usual the food was great, the service was friendly and the price was right.  This is a special restaurant in our neighborhood and it is both family friendly and a great date night.  It has become our once-a-week fix."}
{"text":"Yet again Pita Jungle comes through. Just killing time and I stopped in to see my favorite Jaclyn at the best hangout in our area.   Casual and classy. Remarkable appetizers and great ambiance. A very fun atmosphere with a constant upbeat vibe.  We are always pleased to hang out with Jaclyn and her personality and pedigree never cease to make Pita Jungle my new hangout."}
{"text":"In a place where chain restaurants and fast food joints are king, Pita Jungle (only a local chain) beckons - even though it's 7 miles away from the hotel I stay when I'm here for work. I gladly drive (yes, I used 'glad' and 'drive' in direct relation) the 15 minutes to eat here (or carry out).   The menu is diverse, fresh and healthy, and there are tons of veggie options. I've been twice - last time with a friend who was living here (thanks, Dave!) and this time on my own - and have had the veggie wrap and tonight had the black bean burger. The veggie wrap was HUGE and had the most unique combo of ingredients - brown rice (like a soft burrito, mmm), broccoli, cauliflower, eggplant, carrots and I think a saffron seasoning. It was AMAZING. They were out of the black bean burger that first time so I had to try tonight and was NOT disappointed. Came with sliced roasted red peppers, lettuce, tomato and onions and on soft multi-grain bread. Delicious home fries on the side. YUM.   I also recall that their trio of hummus is fantastic. And they have a good selection of bottled beers, including a local organic brew.   As a side note - their Web site is rad! Very neat design and artwork throughout. Props for that, for sure!   Oh - and I almost forgot to mention their dirt cheap prices! This place gets a San Francisco thumbs up, for sure! :)"}
{"text":"I used to live right next door to this place, and I still work down the street.  We used to hit this place at lunch a lot.  I always ordered the Mediterranean Chicken Salad which was perfectly textured - until they started replacing the lettuce with parsley.  Now it is almost inedible.  The prices seem to have steadily climbed as well.  Last week, my lunch crew decided we will not be going back for lunch because prices have risen to much and the quality of the food has declined.   18 bucks out the door is a lot of money for sandwiches and salad at what is essentially an upscale fast food joint."}
{"text":"$3 Sangria all day everyday?!  Yes.  Food is always excellent, staff is always nice- what more could you want?"}
{"text":"Always fresh, love the specials and the best flavored iced-tea. They ask if you want to take some to go so you have something cool to quench your thirst on those steamy days!"}
{"text":"This place is consistent. It's got a nice open ambiance and feels casual / artsy. It has been several months since I have been in, but I could tell many of the staff were the same. So I assume they have a pretty good morale, low turn over. The menu has a good variety, my wife and daughter are vegetarian, but not myself or my son, but there are plenty of choices to keep us all happy. Which isn't always the case, and another reason I like this place.  Every time we have gone, the service has been good. We are checked on frequently and the waitress/waiters seem to know the menu and be helpful. The food quantity and consistency also is good. I would say the only thing that happens with the hummus plate is not enough chips, we always end up with extra hummus, which seems like a waste. The flavors have that extra little unique flare.  If you want a casual / good place to take your family, this is it."}
{"text":"Chicken chipotle lavish pizza makes me happy! Spicy and savory and so much more. My new favorite is the curried chicken salad. The golden raisins and caramelized onions top off its greatness."}
{"text":"Tuesday, a visiting family member decided to take eight of us to dinner and one of the girls selected Pita Jungle.  I am now sad to say that I had never been.  Both the food and the experience were excellent.  I had the Chicken del Sol (a Southwest style chicken cooked with diced tomatoes, garlic, black beans, and sweet corn), which comes with a chipotle cheddar pita crisp.  The chicken itself was better than most, but what really made the meal was the chipotle cheddar pita.  It complimented the dish perfectly.  Perhaps most surprising were the portion sizes, given the relatively low cost.  I did not expect to have so much food.  Serving eight people is difficult for anyone, but the waitress handled our party's size decently well.  The only mistake we had was an incorrectly-prepared dish, which the staff replaced without a fuss.  It is the only thing keeping my review from being five stars.  We've already made plans to go back..."}
{"text":"So good, I love pita jungle. My personal fav is the honey seared ahi tuna salad. It comes with fruits in it like pineapple and strawberries which goes together so well with the fish!!"}
{"text":"Visiting from Cali, had dinner with some friends who lives in Maricopa.  From the moment you walk in, your nose is tickled with the fantastic smell from the open kitchen!  The four of us shared 2 appetizers; mediterranean antipasto platter and the cilantro jalapeno hummus...we almost fought to lick the plates.  Then my husband and I shared the falafel pita and gyro pita, deconstructed style...the falafel was phenomenal!  Nothing negative to say about this place.  The decor was unique, kinda street-art esque.  Wish we had one of these in Cali!"}
{"text":"EMILY WAS AWESOME! We have been coming to Pita Jungle for many years and, although we have always loved the food, the service can be hit or miss. We appreciated the prompt friendly service tonight and will spread the good word!"}
{"text":"Wonderful food. THe iced teas are to die for. I love the service and that they give you huge to go teas when you are leaving. We usually go for the salad and the hummus. CAnnot go wrong there. Honestly, we have not had any bad food or bad service there."}
{"text":"What's NOT to love about this place! Service and food are awesome. The environment is clean and chic. It feels like an upscale Scottsdale cafe instead of a Gilbert hideaway. I love their falafel! I order take out often with this place and they always have things perfect."}
{"text":"Wow! Great service and the food was as amazing as it always is. We had the hummus trio, shrimp in ajo, garlic lemon chicken and mozzarella and tomato. Steven was our server. Try the Happy hour tapas menu, I love it!  This is our new default location!!"}
{"text":"OMG!  Who would have thought you could make a full meal with just fruit and cheese. They have this plate called the fruit and cheese fantasia, and it is delish!!!  I have been here twice and meant to order something different the last rime I went, but I could not say no to the fruit and cheese..it was like a drug addictaion and it was callin me"}
{"text":"Horrible service. Each and every time. They don't care to educate you on the menu and you feel stupid for asking a question. The male server got my order wrong, didn't put my drink in a Togo cup like I asked, and even got the person next to me order wrong as well. It was a joke."}
{"text":"Sadly, I have to give this location of Pita Jungle mixed reviews. The food, as always, is delectably tasty. We had a mixed hummus platter to start with. Three varieties of hummus with pita bread. All three were very good.  I had the Chipotle Chicken Lavosh (special). It was so tasty! Really flavorful and really spicy. Loved it.  Here is the downside - all concert floors, tables packed really close together, and ridiculously loud in the place. Hard to hear the person across the table from you talking.   Love the food, the location/build out are mediorce at best.  Chandler location is a much better set up."}
{"text":"Poor job today Pita Jungle.   1st, the waiter & host Chris had the menu under his armpit and he had these huge sweat rings under his armpits on his blue extra tight t-shirt. So I just remembered they had a black bean burger and ordered that without looking at or even touching the menu. The place was dirty, I sat by the window and the window seal was covered with dust and etc.. The booth table leaned down towards the window and the seat was sunk down in the middle, it was worn out. The black bean burger completely fell apart. You couldn't take a bite without parts dropping off the burger on to the plate. It was a mess.  I asked the waiter, Chris, for some ketchup, he delivered me an empty bottle and walked away. I had to wait and call him over again and ask for another ketchup bottle.   Chris asked me if I want a doggie bag for the fallen apart pieces. I said no thanks, it didn't even taste good. I only has a couple of bites.  He did not offer me anything after I advised him it all sucked. I paid full price and left..  I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Yum, Yum, Yum!   We arrived and were promptly seated.  Friendly hostess?  Not at all, but whatever.  I don't need that to enjoy myself. Waiter came by promptly and took our drink order.  We asked for a kids menu and he brought back a piece of paper with available items written by hand.  They were out of their kids menu.  A wave of panic immediately came over me as I realized this meant no crayons to entertain my little ones until their food came.  A few rounds of \"I Spy\" saved me.  The waiter came by to take our order and we made the biggest mistake of the night.  He never came back.  Okay, eventually after a long, long time.  We ordered pita pizzas for the kids (tasteless and bland, but they ate them) and my husband and I shared the chicken chipotle 'pizza' and lavosh shawarma wrap.  Heavenly!    We kept oohing and aahing about how delicious our food was.  Only complaint was that they burnt the lavosh so we had to pick the burnt parts off.  Oh another complaint.  There wasn't any cheese on the pizza.  But it still tasted yummy.  Saw a couple of plates pass by that I wish we would've ordered (nachos and a fruit plate.)  We finished with the baklava.  We both loved it, but it was really hard.  Since I'm not a frequent baklava-ordering girl, I didn't know if that is how it is supposed to be served.  After hacking off pieces, we were rewarded with mouth-watering bites.  Yes, the service was sloooooow and the lahvosh burnt, but we will return.  It's great to have options for healthy, delicious food!  Also, FYI, join their online club and they will send you a coupon for a free appetizer :-)  I love free things, especially when our spartan meal came to $30 (small pizza, wrap, 2 kids pizzas and water)"}
{"text":"A hoping place with a great variety of  dishes to order Offers Brunch, lunch and dinner Food was good with great service. Wold just suggest to the chefs to scrub the potatoes prior to cooking them and add some spice to the Lavosh Shawarma Wrap. Nice but a bit tasteless and bland"}
{"text":"This evening dinner was calling, so off to our favorite healthy restaurant. We visit at least 2-3 times a month.  We have always have had good service. All the waitress and waiters are always polite and willing to make sure everything is top notch. Tonight Bre was our waitress, her attention to our quality of food and drink was impressive. Her caring attitude as the other employees display keeps us coming back again and again.  When we have out of town guests, they always ask \"dinner tonight at Pita Jungle?\"    Bring back the Kafta burger!! Yummy !!"}
{"text":"Good mix of cuisine   Always friendly staff  Love the pita which is good when you name the place Pita Jungle"}
{"text":"I usually love Pita Jungle but my trip to the one in Dana Park was disappointing. The place has little inside seating and the order was mixed up and the chicken was dry in our salads. Maybe it was an off day but the one I normally go to on Shea and Scottsdale is head and shoulders better than this place"}
{"text":"Got it to go - order was hot, fresh and ready to go within minutes. Bartender was very friendly and the food was excellent. I always tip 20% on to go orders when the service is great - thank you"}
{"text":"I had seen Pita Jungle around but never got around to trying it until I saw this mall location. I got the Philly Cheesesteak Pita (I know, the unhealthiest one, right haha), and it was just FANTASTIC! It was filled with meat and yummy melted cheese, mushrooms and green peppers. I usually hate green peppers, but these were cooked in a way where they were so soft and sweet, I almost liked them better then the rest of the pita. The pita itself was warm and fresh tasting. I've gone back for this same pita multiple times, and I've noticed that it seems to taste better when the dude with the beard makes it :)"}
{"text":"Waitress needs to learn how to listen and put a order in. Asked for no onions on salad. Came with onions. Really? Than 2 minutes after salad came main meal came. Timing people."}
{"text":"Jalepeno and cilantro hummus is soooooo good.  Good iced tea, good pita pizzas, all of its healthy as well as delicious too!  They even have a couple of great \"normal\" items for less daring diners such as the Philly Chicken Pita."}
{"text":"Pita Jungle is a chain restaurant, kind of a P.F. Changs of Mediterranean food.  They have a consistently good Hummus and Baba Ganoosh, but Pitas are what they're about. So don't stray far from their namesake,  At my host's recommendation I went with the Philly Steak Pita which was was very tasty. It was full of good meat flavor, with very good sauce in ample quantity.   For the most part everyone in our party needed a box.  While it isn't exactly an \"authentic\" Med/Middle Eastern menu, it was a good choice for lunch."}
{"text":"Blow's my mind how this place has existed for so long, so close to my house without being noticed.  That is the major hurdle to jump is the cookie cutter exterior facade which is of no control of the restaurant to a certain degree, but could be achieved (maybe some 4' LED's in an abstract collage across the store front).  The food is excellent, the service is unbelievable, and incognito which is such a social commentary that is amazing.  I think in some ways just the philosophy of how the kitchen is visible is what the restaurant is about, and the people and organization of the tables.  It really blows my mind to think that there are people who think about how things interact and create points of overlap, functionally and physically.  If I was suck on an island with only the \"Pita Jungle,\"  I would have a huge delicious menu to not get bored with I could probably go every day for every meal and not dip into my savings and still feel healthy wonderful, funny, and intelligent; but that might just be because of how the portions and the size of the table are in direct conflict, so perfect is it when you spend 20 bucks and the table can barely contain all the wonderful and delicious samples of perfection."}
{"text":"Lentil fetoosh. That's all you need to know. Seriously one of the things I crave with that lemon dressing and the caramelized onions, it's so good! Actually, I've never had a bad meal here. I get take-out here quite frequently after the gym or yoga and have had most of the salads and a few of the pitas. The service is quick for take-out or dining in, the employees are always friendly and the food is consistently good. Servings are very large so you can easily get two meals out of most things."}
{"text":"As one other reviewer also stated, I got food poisoning from this establishment. How can I tell? Well I had lunch there yesterday at 2:30 and then just watched it come all back up a half hour ago. I ate 17.5 hours ago. Food shouldn't sit in your stomach for more than 8 hours. Didn't even eat anything in between because I felt progressively worse after lunch. Like everyone else is saying...go to the one on Shea, never had a problem with that place ever and I've lost count if how many times I've been there."}
{"text":"Healthy eating that tastes delicious! I have several faves, but I like the gyro, as well as the three flavor of hummus.  There is also a chicken with the 3 hummus that is delicious.  And it is a crowd that is always about 70% women."}
{"text":"Lunch-Time Tomorrow I Think So...I Love The Pitas Here & Not To Mention The Chill Atmosphere It's Just A Great Place!"}
{"text":"Food sat readying widow for more then 15 minutes. Then tried to serve it. Management was rude about it. I have been here many times. This waiter was very cold."}
{"text":"Love this place!! amazing food. always fast take put. the chicken pasta with lemon vinegarette is my favorite!!"}
{"text":"Great place to grab some healthy food. Great service too! I eat lunch at this location a couple of times per month."}
{"text":"We love the food but are growing weary of the inability to get a take out order right. They are like 1 out of 6 on the last 6 orders. Sure, once you can deal with but now its obvious this store needs a new manager."}
{"text":"Our daughter took us here and I usually do not like Pita's, Wow was I wrong about that. I had a chicken philly pita and it was fantastic!!  The service was good and attentive and the place was packed. We would go there again when in town!"}
{"text":"I love love this place. The menu is exceptionally unique for this part of the country and their prices can't be beat. Seriously. You can spend $10 - $15 on a fulfilling lunch and still need a to-go box. I've been here dozens of times and will be back dozens more. I always sit at the bar because the girls are friendly and especially attentive. As a bonus, they rotate talented artists work every now and then which is cool to look at while you relax."}
{"text":"Great Mediterranean food!  Food and service are always great.  I have been many times and I am never disappointed."}
{"text":"I loved this place and when I first came here I was expected a cheezy place that would have no ambience or character to it. I arrived in time for the happy hour specials and the beer wine and select bites were very cheap. I ordered the gyro and it was very moist and I wanted to take one to go!  The bakalava was very good to finish everything off. The service was very good and the ambience made me want to stay and have a few drinks and relax after a hard week.  I would recommend this place to everyone since the entire bill was so cheap I had to question the waitress if everything was on it."}
{"text":"Pita Jungle is as good as it gets. Simply said, they have a great concept, affordable food, and friendly service. I even love all those tattoos and ear piercing and other eclectic nuances of the staff. I'm too much of a wimp to get anything pierced, or anything permanently installed on my body, but I love seeing it on your crew. Keep up the great work to the jungle. Me and my friend are sure to be back soon."}
{"text":"I was super excited to find this location here, right in my own neighborhood! I'd been to the Tempe location many times, but that's a bit of a drive for the every day dinner.  And it turns out, I like this location so much more!  Parking is rough most of the time, but if we don't luck out and get a reasonable spot, we'll park on the other side of the lot and take a walk.  Inside is ever-changing art hanging on the walls, Greek/modern decor, and a lovely view of the duck pond there on Ray and Dobson.  We have yet to make it out on the patio, but in good weather, I bet that's perfect.    I've always liked Pita Jungle's food, but that's because I am not vegetarian.  I enjoy healthy food, but I do need meat.  This explains why my vegan friends aren't quite as taken by PJs as I am.  I love the Chicken del Sol, which is a southwest spin on a greek stew sort of dish.  The cheesy pita wedges around the edge give the presentation of a sun, and are delicious to dip in the broth.  The chicken is just spicy enough that I enjoy it.  Lately, my boyfriend and I have been going just to split an appetizer; the chicken and hummus trifecta.  That's not what it's called on the menu, but that's how I remember it.  It's offered as one of three different kinds of hummus with chopped chicken and pita, but don't be afraid to ask for all three varieties.  If you must choose just one, the red pepper hummus is the best.  With an extra pita and some of their fresh lemonade, the two of us walk out completely satisfied.  Service has always been very friendly, and I appreciate that they always offer (or just provide without warning) an extra beverage for the road.  Their lemonade is so good I can't turn that down.  I'll definitely continue frequenting this Pita Jungle!"}
{"text":"Great chicken combo. I am a fan of Pita Jungle. Great healthy options from the appetizers to full entree options. Ask for a cucumber jalepano margarita, they do a pretty good job!"}
{"text":"This was one of my favorite restaurants when I lived in Phoenix, and one that I make sure to visit whenever I return. A local Phoenix chain, Pita Jungle has started to branch out to southern California, and I just wish they would make their way east to Chicago. The Indian School location is my favorite, but at each location in the Valley you can find quality food and attentive, friendly wait service. Their falafel and classic hummus are both very good, but my favorites are located in the \"Healthy Burgers\" section of the menu. Their veggie burger is excellent, but their chipotle black bean burger is sheer joy, striking a nice balance between spicy and sweet with the inclusion of dried cranberries. If interested in something lighter, try their Caribbean salad, which is a salad of fresh fruit topped with coconut and strawberry dressing. It makes for an enjoyable dish during those hot Phoenix summers. Other favorites of mine include their nachos, mixed beans, lentils and rice, and their garlic new potatoes. The decor of their Valley locations is a good balance of fashionable and relaxed. Pita Jungle is definitely a great place for lunch or a casual dinner with friends, or just to eat out on your own and enjoy excellent food made with fresh ingredients. I love Pita Jungle!"}
{"text":"I've been craving this pita jungle for while and now I finally got to eat some. I got a typical gyro which is not bad. Healthy and enough for what you're paying for. I would definitely go back for more. There's still lots on menu that I gotta try. Happy hour is 3:30-5:30 for $1-$3 ranges for small portion food. Gotta try that too. Location is pretty good and nice."}
{"text":"Of course the food is amazing... That's why I have been coming here for years.  I love the servers... Especially the tall dark-haired one Brett... He is amazing!"}
{"text":"If I could give a minus star I would. We went there as we used to love Pita Jungle in CA. Here the place was empty and not very clean looking. Staff unfriendly and food yuck. Never come back"}
{"text":"Yikes! Don't come here after 9pm if you want good service with good food. We arrived around 9:05 (they close at 10pm), and from the second we walked in, we could tell our business was notttttt wanted. My fianc√© noticed a kid who worked there kept staring at us (as if \"ugh, why did they come so late?\") that pissed fiance' off and I had to tell him, whatever... They have an hour til close. It's not like we got there at 9:50pm.  Our server was nice with good service.. In the beginning, lol. Part of my wrap was literally coming undone & not wrapped at ALL. See pic. it's not what I remember this item on the menu being at other locations. Either the other locations do it wrong & I liked it better like that, or vise versa, idk. It was cooked so sloppy that it was hard to eat (in public without getting shit everywhere). I'm surprised it was even served like that actually. If I wanted to eat it with a fork, I wouldn't have ordered a wrap, lol  I think our server knew we weren't pleased but instead of asking how everything is (?? I've been a waitress...), she drops a box off for me & soon after the check when I've barely even eaten anything yet. So that was our  cue, that indeed, we were not really welcome. Shame! Maybe you should close earlier if you don't want people coming in at 9pm to eat at your establishment."}
{"text":"I really love Pita Jungle.  There are few places I go to eat where the entire menu is appealing.  This is one of those spots.  It allows you to be healthy or indulgent; the choice is yours.  The awesome thing:  it's all delicious.  I'm a fan of their salads.  They're huge, stockpiled with loads of fresh ingredients.  I love to get a side of falafel and hummus.  Good stuff.  This location really stands out because of the service.  Graham helped me when I dropped in for dinner.  He was great:  attentive, witty and fast!  Without a doubt, I'll be back."}
{"text":"They have an extensive Vegetarian/Vegan/Gluten Free/Paleo menu and their online tool really allows you to see how their food is prepared and acts as a good guide to determine what fits your needs. The Late Night HH tapas menu is super cheap and a great treat at the end of the day. Highly recommend the hummus trio, black bean burger, and philly chicken pita for those who aren't as GF/Vegan sensitive."}
{"text":"Again fantastic service as always thank you SAM!!!!  but i might add today in the parking lot i witnessed how ppl have become so \"entitled\" in our society and it was an eye opening experience to actually see how my waitresses sam josh brenna elizabeth kelly ryan and  all the others must feel with this society so bug  HUGGGS to ALLL of you in dealing with these select individuals  i give HUGSSS to there dedication for allowing customers to treat them in properly and than post  bad reviews about there \"service \" on yelp  which CLEARLY is NOT always the case some ppl just will nvr be \"happy\" Its insanity  HairDoc TK."}
{"text":"This went from being one of my faves to low on my go to list. My past three visits I've either relieved the wrong order or been served stale/old/bad food. Makes me so sad as I've been dining here for the past 8 years : ("}
{"text":"Great food, as is the norm with all the Pita Jungle locations. Ambience is a little lacking at this one, not bad, but not up to the Ray & Dobson location. Hard to match up when you're playing a strip mall/ movie theater parking lot against a community lake. The service is up to par but not exceedingly good. You'll never go wrong here though as the food always exceeds expectations!"}
{"text":"Pita Jungle is one of Fran's favorite restaurants.  We eat in or carry out from there at least once a week or more.    We typically have the soups and the chicken hummus.  On occasion,  I have strayed and had the black bean, veggie burgers and Gyro Sandwiches.  They are all good.  If I have one complaint, it is that I feel that the menu is a little bit limited for me.  It might be because I'm burned out because we eat there so much.  In the end, you can't argue with the quality of the food or the prices.  I actually believe that Pita Jungle is one of the best values in town."}
{"text":"My friends and I had a great lunch here today. Love the decor! I would have walked out of there with one of the chairs if it weren't a crime in 46 states.  But restaurants should be judged on their food, not their completely awesome seating, so, here goes!  I had the broiled chicken salad, vinaigrette on the side. Yum!  Probably could have had more creative vegetables in the salad, I'm just saying, but it was delicious and I enjoyed it. My friends both ordered beef gyros, and loved how flavorful they were. Yay!  The service was fast and friendly, and they were even able to wrangle Thing 1 and Thing 2 sitting at the table next to us, bringing them food quickly and cleaning up their mess upon leaving. Great job!  Parking was not cool, but that was only due to the lot being resurfaced.   Like this location better than the Arcadia one. Good work team!"}
{"text":"First time here for lunch. Immediately greeted by the hostess with a friendly smile. Took a seat at the bar and the bartender (petite brunette) was extremely pleasant and accommodating. She told me what she usually orders and I opted for that choice...very satisfied! It was the gyro without the pita bread with the tzaziki and lemon dressing on the side. Atmosphere was very clean and inviting. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Always solid...never had anything I didn't enjoy! Humus is delicious and chicken Schuarma always does it for me!"}
{"text":"I work for DoorDash delivery service, and I would have to say this restaurant is one of the busiest I pick up from. Mark the \"take out\" order manager works the bar taking drinks, food orders, plus all the calls for take out orders. I have to admit he has always been friendly, smiles big, and sufficient and very pleasant to deal with. Kudos to you Mark for a job very well done. Thank You!!"}
{"text":"I went to the one at Dana Park, but I can't seem to find a page for that. So, I don't like to eat out very often, but this place changed my mind! I love Pita Jungle and honestly feel right at home! Their garlic potatoes are probably the best fries I've ever had! & our food came so fast too! The food is great, everyone is so friendly, and it's so cheap! I can't wait to go back : )."}
{"text":"Very disappointed!  While my husband and I love Pita Jungle, we had a very bad experience at this about 2 weeks ago when some friends from KC came to visit.  We arrived about 5:30pm, placed our order and everything seemed fine until we realize it was quarter after 6.  Husband went to find the manager to see what took so long, because we noticed a nearby table got their food when they arrived 10 minutes or so after us.  Manager said he will check on the order and come talk to us.  We waited, but he didn't come out.  When we left we went thru the main dining area (we were on the patio) to see if he was on his way to talk to us.  We left because they had a seminar to go to that night and couldn't wait any longer.  The entire evening was horrible because we went to Jack in The Box next to Pita Jungle and inhaled the food, which gave some of us a heartburn."}
{"text":"Ok so I usually love pita jungle first time ordering from this location. I ordered takeout my large hummus looked like less than a small and was garnished with a bunch of cilantro and chickapees no tomato,cucumber  or olives.  Maybe they were out of cucumbers because my side had 6 slices! I ordered 3 extra pita and got 1 to go with my large hummus. The sauce from my shrimp leaked and soaked the foil wrapped pita. Very disappointing wish I would have opened the bag and looked at it before leaving!"}
{"text":"I'll make this short. I was craving a gyro, and the one I got at Pita Jungle definitely hit the spot. It was delicious, a good size, and decently priced. Also, the workers are very friendly which is always a plus. I left with a full stomach and a smile on my face... love it when that happens!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome but the service is random. Some days it's good some days it's horrible. Today was in the not so great day. Forgot things had to wait on others."}
{"text":"Amazing food! The chicken and hummus is my favorite, but everything I've had on their menu was great. Delicious falafel and shawarma, and the key lime candies on the way out make it worth the trip every time."}
{"text":"First off, glad to see someone move into the Gold Spot building!! Got my husband to come and try Pita Jungle, even though he says no the Greek food.... The building is done up nicely, with a great outdoor patio area. The beers on draft are first rate, and the happy hour tapas menu (all for $1 !!) is great for chatting and sharing.  We ordered wayyyy too much, as the plates are very large. We shared the Greek salad, fresh and tasty. Husband had the Phillie Pita... huge, and hot, tasty and given a good review by him, with a \"I could do this again\". I had the Tuna Pita. It was great, but I thought it was tuna in a pita, and it was greens with tuna on top with a pita on the side. Was great, but huge!! Then we shared two of the one dollar tapas plates, the falafal and the hummus trio. Both good...  Service was wonderful, and the whole experience was good. Glad to have them in the hood, a new place to ride our bikes or scooters to!!"}
{"text":"I had the gyro and it was pretty good. Lots of meat and lettuce. I had to ask for more tzatziki sauce because it was a litle dry."}
{"text":"I have not been to Pita Jungle in awhile and me and some friends decided to get an early dinner. I had the nachos (which were great), my friend had a gyro, and another friend had a specialty salad. The food was good but my friend never got her bread with the salad. The only time we saw our server was when he took our orders and got us our drinks. We waited 30 minutes for our check. There was a large party who arrived but still he did not even stop by to let us know our check would be a few minutes or didn't even ask to send another server to get us refills. We had to flag down another server to find ours so we could get our check. We finally go my it and we waited 7 more minutes for him to come and get it. We finally went inside and asked the hostess/ to go cashier if we could pay with her and she said no we have to cash out with our server with a rude tone. Usually places let you cash out with a hostess or cashier upfront that so I was surprised when she was unable to help. It was extremely frustrating for us just waiting to be taking care of. What made it worse is that many times we saw our server just standing and looking out the window (we were in the patio). And to top it off after we cashed out we got no \"have a good night or come again, or sorry to keep you ladies waiting\". Just earlier that day I had an early lunch with amazing service else were (during a lunch rush) and then I get one of the worse service later one :/ Pita Jungle please train your staff how to deal with rushes and ask for help, and show some basic costumer service skills."}
{"text":"I love pita jungle for their healthier food options. I go there quite frequently since its close to my job. I always buy an extra pint of the lemon vinaigrette sauce because it is my favorite dressing. I was there monday and the guy at the bar refused to sell me a pint he was hesitant saying that what they gave me in the salad was more than enough, like if he knows how much i need. I use it for other salads that i make at home. He told me to hold on while he asked his boss then while i was waiting for him he took a phone order and again he says that was more than enough and that they were on a low supplyof lemon vinaigrette. Like seriously dude im trying to purchase it i am not asking for it for free. I told him i have bought it before yet he didnt seem to care and said that suddenly they stopped doing that which i think is a bunch of bull. I just think that is very poor customer service youre not going to tell a customer how much is enough if they are paying."}
{"text":"Pita Jungle makes me so happy, I usually do a little dance while I enjoy their food. I have never had a bad meal at either location, though I prefer the one on Indian School. My favorites include red lentil soup, tiki marsala, chicken pita or lavosh, and the lentil salad is amazing. Great staff to boot. It is a perfect place for dinner if you need a quick restaurant on your way to a play or concert."}
{"text":"After leaving for lunch became sick had one of the salads with chicken. When i got home threw salad out but kept dressing and ate on homemade salad next day and became sick again..ugh"}
{"text":"Out on a date and he says \"Pita Jungle\" after the show.  I say OK!  I am in love with the red bell pepper hummus and rice pudding ~  We get there around 12:30 pm on a Sunday (today) afternoon.  Not a wait (great!) we sit by the wall so we can hear each other!  The place is always noisy as it is a cafeteria type setup.  Our waitress was on top of things, wine, ordering, etc.    He orders the Faluja somethings which are like vegan meatballs in a salad.  We share the Moroccan Gazpacho Soup (YUM YUM YUM) and I lay into the hummus.    Needless to say with all that food we were stuffed!  With 2 glasses of wine I was ready to take a walk (in Phoenix I think it was like 120,000 degrees outside) so we walked around the misters ~   Clean place, staff ready to serve, food a plenty, and he treated :-)  The bill was only $39.00 with all that scrumptious food!  ~ Luana Joya Lucia"}
{"text":"Great consistent food and customer service keeps me coming back again & again.  I'm a vegetarian & find the menu full of options. I'm very picky about my food choices & they always accommodate my special requests.  I've never had a bad experience here. The staff is always friendly, helpful, and happy.  I've also noticed the staff seems to work as a team.  It's actually amazing to watch how they fill in & cover for each other, do I've never had to wait, never had a problem. I commend your team and find that lacking in many businesses.  I rarely eat in, but order take out about once a week.  It's always ready hot & have never had any problems. Consistency over the years has made me a loyal customer! Thank you pita jungle! Your food & staff   are top notch! Kudos."}
{"text":"This is a very trendy yuppy place. However, that being said the food was fresh and healthy. I had the chicken pita with classic hummus.    What surprised me is based on previous reviews I thought this was going to be a chipotle like pita restaurant. They have a bar with beer on tap.   This atmosphere was interesting. Definitely trendy. Overall the food was not bad, but nothing that wowed me."}
{"text":"Superb food and beer. Are and drank at bar the other night. Had the chicken avocado pita tostada and a lemon shandy. Both were wonderful. The service was really great. The only thing that was a downer was waiting 23 minutes after I finished for a to go order of rice pudding. Q"}
{"text":"Picked up a TOGO order today around lunch time. Awesome as always! My order was ready when I got there and was still fresh upon receiving. Great service and atmosphere.:)"}
{"text":"I love Pita Jungle and have been to several locations. Always very fresh, refreshing, and satisfying. Menu options are heath and vegan conscious. My all time favorite is the jalapeno cilantro hummus. Felafel sandwiches and salmon spinach salads are also very high on the list."}
{"text":"I love Pita Jungle. I don't live in Phoenix, but I visit often since my family is there. Every time, I go to Pita Jungle. My last visit, I went straight there from the airport. The food is so yummy, it's easy to order healthy, prices are reasonable, and portions are huge. I always have leftovers. The salads are my favorite, but the chicken plate with beans, rice and garlic sauce is also really good. And they have bottomless refills on my favorite drink -- Arnold Palmers. What more could you want? Pita Jungle, please open a San Francisco location!"}
{"text":"The Good: I am thrilled to have a nice healthy restaurant so close. Even though I think Pita Jungle has a great atmosphere, I still feel comfortable and welcome wearing my workout clothes and riding my bike to dinner-- major plus. The food is delicious and healthy, from the starters to the salads, to the pita wraps.   That being said...  The Not-so-good: I was underwhelmed with the friendliness of the waitstaff. I felt like I was annoying the hostess when I finally asked if I could put my name down for a table, after she kept ignoring me for a minute or so. When we were finally seated, our food took extra-long to get to us. Our server was nice, but almost shy. None of this was a deal-breaker, but definitely made our night less than perfect.   Pita Jungle is a great weeknight post-workout choice that could work just a tiny bit on costumer service and wait time."}
{"text":"Awesome food! We had great service and the best Mediterranean food. It is always nice to have a restaurant that serves food other than what the mainstream serve."}
{"text":"Spicy chicken wrap and chicken lavosh pizza were highlights from here.  I can honestly say we have never really had a bad meal from pita jungle.  It has definitely earned its way into our regular rotation."}
{"text":"Nothing bad to say about this place.   Food: best around for this style of cooking. I love their grilled chicken on the cilantro-jalape√±o hummus.    Atmosphere: casual, laid-back, classy  People: staff is great  Prompt, upbeat, attentive.   Price: I feel the cost of my meal is more than fair because the quality of food and service you receive at Pita Jungle, is comparable to that found in higher-end restaurants."}
{"text":"\"This restaurant is always busy!\" (Lunch, Dinner, Winter, Summer) The quality of food in this restaurant is Primo!  I feel by stating the fact above I've given you an idea how good the food is...    I've tried the appetizers, the salads, the Falafels, the Gyros, & the \"hummus!\"  \"Oh the Hummus!\"  My favorite is the \"Hummus with the seared Ahi!\"  I've never had a bad meal here! The service has always been great. They get your food to you fast...Also the waiting staff is very bohemian, which makes dinning here even more interesting! This is not a stuffy upscale restaurant, but the food is as good if not better than most of the overpriced joints around town!  My only complaint is that it is always busy, & therefore loud!"}
{"text":"Pita Jungle... Pita jungle....  I don't know what it is... You're atmosphere is usually not my cup of tea.  Not normally a fan of my servers having dreadlocks and tattoos.  But you know what?  Keep bringing me that hummus and taboule and I'm transported to a world where I too have dreadlocks and tattoos!  Maybe even a few piercing.  And all of the sudden, I am an art critic too.  I'm in love with the food here at Pita Jungle.  Never a bad experience.  My biggest issue is when I forget what I ordered and what is what on the plate.  All I really care about or think about when eating here is, \"does it taste good with a pita?\" The answer is usually, \"Hell yes it does!\".   The art all around the restaurant is a nice touch.  Service is always quick and the food is always fresh.  Wish additional pitas were free but it's all good, I can spare the 34 cents.  Always happy with my experiences here.  Bring your hipster friend here before it's not ironic enough for them."}
{"text":"Love it.  Good fresh food. You can watch them cook the chicken not just heat it up. Very generous portions an entire chicken breast and about 4 cups of rice. My favorite order is a side of brown rice a side of seasoned chicken and a side of feta. This depending on which Pita jungle you are at will run you anywhere form $5.89 to $7.89 the location at the Scottsdale Fashion Center food court is the cheaper one but you have to deal with the crowds."}
{"text":"I wasn't sure if I would have the energy to review Pita Jungle since it's one of my all time fav restaurants and there would just be way too much to say. I only go to the Tempe location; I tried the Chandler one a couple times but it was not nearly as good or consistent as the Tempe one. This restaurant is awesome! Great for casual eats or formal meets like dates or group dinners. The food is very reasonably priced, huge portions, very fresh food, and very very delicious! Whenever my family comes to visit, we always plan at least one meal here. I have loved every dish here; no joke, it's all belly pleasing goodness. Here are some of my favorites (some have meat from before I was a vegetarian):  *the medchilada: a giant burrito wrapped in lavosh, no longer on menu but they still make them upon request at this location* the hummus: I like half roasted red bell pepper and half cilantro jalapeno, this explodes with flavor and is a great starter for non-hummus consumers* tsatziki: they have the best tsatziki ever, omg, just the right amount of seasoning, I could drink this stuff* gambas con ajo: jumbo shrimp swimming in a delicious light red sauce, served with a pesto cheese covered pita* MTB: mozzarella, tomato, basil with evoo and balsamic, huge slices and very fresh* grilled vegetable salad: huge and covered in yummy veggies, thought it would be weird to have hot veggies on a bed of salad but oh-no-sir, this is sooo yummy!* California beach club: stuffed with turkey, cheese, and lots of veggies in a pita. I still get this minus the meat and always get tsatziki on the side. This is a nice cold, fresh option.* broiled chicken pita: huge chunks of tender chicken in a pita with all the right fixings...although their garlic sauce is super yummy, I trade it out for tsatziki.* spicy chicken wrap: oh man, this will clear up any congestion you may have, so yummy, and so spicy...if it's not hot enough for you, try it with extra saracha.* Pesto lavash turkey wrap: if you're not a fan of hot turkey, swap it out for their scrumptious chicken* black bean burger: mmmm mmmm mmmm...I like to get mine on their whole wheat bun, the roasted red peppers and other toppings make this* glazed chicken lavosh pizza: oh man this is what pizza should be about, savory and sweet, the caramelized onions are soooo good on this pizza!* chicken combo platter: a bit of everything, make your own pita sandwich, mix and match flavors* fruit & cheese fantasia: a great platter to share, tons and tons of fresh fruit and lots of varieties of cheese, served with a pita.*"}
{"text":"The service was mediocre, nothing special. The waitresses don't tell you that the pricing for a soft drink is 3 dollars and they dont tell you refills are NOT free, they just continue to fill them up. They refilled my drink twice on top of the initial cost and it cost me 9 fucking dollars for some sprite.   On top of that my girlfriend ordered the pesto pizza, the menu in the store says \"+$2\" for chicken. I was charged double that.  Also, all the ingredients in the meals aren't listed on the menu, and the food was mediocre at best. Hard to eat, prepared slopily.   I wouldn't come back here if they gave me a coupon for 100% off my next meal. DO NOT GO TO THIS PITA JUNGLE!!!!"}
{"text":"The place seems clean it's just getting your food that there always seems to be an issue. I Ordered a Wood Fired Vegetable salad to go and it took over 30 minutes to get. I thought I learned my mistake and ordered it again but for pick up; so I don't have to wait that long. Now I have the wrong order, a cold salad, with meat.. Probably won't go again. Too many inconveniences for something seeming simple. Not to mention I've only been twice. Not a great expectation to start off with. Slow service and wrong orders."}
{"text":"Been to the Gilbert restaurant twice in the last 2 weeks and won't go back. Food was good but the kitchen uses an excessive amount of garlic in their  entrees. I had indigestion until the following night."}
{"text":"Always a classic. Pretty consistent, great prices. good food. The service could improve, though."}
{"text":"I'm a regular at Pita Jungle, but not all locations are equal in quality, offerings and service. I live by the location downtown and drive to Arcadia because they use a better quality salmon and know how to prepare it (without overcooking most of the time). I've also had the fatoosh salad at both, and the rice was mushy downtown. I also love the chocolate pistachio gelato that is unique to Arcadia. Service is also better at this location."}
{"text":"If your new to Arizona or visiting, you gotta come here, its CHEAP, healthy and no need to dress up, they have take out also.  So when you go, you have to have their chicken with hummus, AMAZING and so damn tasty, I recommend the Lentil Fetoosh Salad, funny name, but the divine flavors are no laughing matter, also they have a honey glazed Pizza, Eat that one too and of course some Tzatsiki, so refreshing and light.  And if your a vegetarian or are a slob and have room for a good side dish, do their brown rice and lentils, there is just something about the seasoning that makes this a meal on its own, so you can even throw some grilled chicken on that and call it a night. Its really really really good."}
{"text":"If you like hummus, then this is the place for you.  Super casual, Pita Jungle has a good mix of young and old patrons. On any given day you'll see students, executives and seniors. The ambiance is uber casual with concrete floors, upbeat music, and an outdoor patio. The servers are young and some look like they just came in from the pool! That doesn't mean the service is bad, exactly opposite. I have had good service every time I've gone in there. The menu is varied including hummus with chicken, lentil soup, pizzas, pita sandwiches, Greek salads and on and on. They also have a thirst quenching Arnold Palmer (lemonade and iced tea.) They are generous with their portions and are always cool with giving you a \"to go\" cup drink. (Almost a necessity in Arizona summer 100 degree temps!) Don't forget to try the baklava and pistachio ice cream for dessert..Yum! if you are looking for good food in a casual environment then this place is for you."}
{"text":"Great restaurant with yummy, healthy eats. Have been coming to Pita Jungle since its early days in Tempe, and love that they have expanded to other areas. This new location is special because of the owners. They have a local rock and roll connection and are super nice guys!   I know that this place will do well, and wish everyone all the success they deserve!"}
{"text":"As soon as you walk in, you will be greeted by the employees, which is great and omg is this place busy.   I had the Lentil Fetoosh Salad, no idea what Fetoosh means, but omg is it amazing! It has Lentils and rice cooked with carmelized onions, over mixed greens, tomatoes, cucumbers, red onions, sumac (a seasoning), toasted pita chips and lemon vinaigrette. I seriously tasted and enjoyed every single bite. It's a huge plate, that can be shared. LOVED IT!   I will be back again to enjoy this amazing plate. MMMMM"}
{"text":"Inventive dishes, but the portions are too big to justify their motto of 'the art of healthy eating.'   The service is average. On a busy night, try to order everything at once otherwise you will be at the table for a long time.   Always try a special. They are almost always excellent.   The hummus is excellent. We get it everytime, automatically.   PJ is a great spot for a date or a casual dinner. Be sure to get your order in promptly, otherwise you'll be at the table for awhile. Drinks are available, but are not set at world-beater prices.   Insider tip: try Pita Jungle for breakfast! They make a great egg pita sandwich!!! (Coffee is average, btw)"}
{"text":"Came in with a massive group of people (18 I believe) and sat outside. The service was fantastic and very nice considering how disorganized our group was. The server himself gets 5 stars.   We ordered various apps, wraps, and salads. The food here is huge, but the pita itself is not very fresh, seems store bought.  Hummus - Very creamy, and over blended, could have used more garlic and lemon. Baba Ganoosh - Excellent, best thing on the menu Chicken wrap - Mediocre at best, nothing to write home about Chicken salad - Same as the wrap, same chicken  Overall the food was quite bland, and needed a lot more fresh herbs, garlic, and spice."}
{"text":"Pita Jungle offers a variety of food for all people, unfortunately it has a hot kitchen and every time I eat there my stomach gets upset... sad to say that the food is harsh on me, and it is too hot to really sit and savor my food."}
{"text":"Good solid food although veering heavily from authenticity. But looking beyond that point, what you get is tasty. I had the garlic dip for appetizer and then the grilled chicken pita. Both dishes were good and fresh.  Service wasn't too bad but it was really loud and cantankerous inside. Not the best atmosphere to really enjoy your food, but the place is a scene, so take it for what it is."}
{"text":"I went here on my second date after watching Big Hero 6, It wasn't super packed, being that it was a Monday night. The place looked very nice, we sat outside. Our starter was the baba Ganoosh and the cilantro jelepano hummus, both which were good.    Our main meal was pitas, I got the falafel and my date got the gyro and just like the starters, they were very delicious, our dessert was the baklava sunde. The ice cream was alright but it was the baklava its self that was delicious. I will defiently be coming back here in the future"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Healthy, very yummy and service is always great.  Our families favorites are the hummus, curry chicken salad and salmon with spinach.  Rice pudding is great for dessert."}
{"text":"very healthy, delicious food. everything tastes fresh and not heavy at all! definitely great, healthy place to eat! even their nachos didn't make me feel sick and heavy afterwards!  i would recommend the chipotle black bean burger. packed with flavor!  i just have to say that it's NOT authentic Mediterranean food, they've taken the idea of Mediterranean food and \"Americanized\" it and they have a whole mix of different types of healthy food."}
{"text":"If you haven't ate at Pita Jungle before then what are you doing with your life?! I'm obsessed with Pita Jungle and all of their healthy options they have. The food is so fresh and they have a large menu so everyone can find something they like. My go to is always the half red pepper and half cilantro jalape√±o hummus to start with veggies and pita bread. Then for my meal I either get the chicken del sol or the wood fired grilled chicken. The service is always good and the food is amazing!"}
{"text":"I love pita jungle! Healthy but delicious! My favorite thing is the chicken hummus trio with the extra special and fluffy pita bread and some siracha. Make sure to ask for the special fluffy pita bread! A healthy alternative to this dish would be no pita bread  and just extra cucumbers... It's just as good in case your watching the carbs!"}
{"text":"Could this indeed be one of my Favorite restaurants in the Valley. YES!!! This is fairly new to this area. Boy could they use a few good restaurants here. Of course in the last few years now they have them and this is the icing on the Cake! Beautiful decor. Very clean,everywhere. The food is beyond outstanding. We both got the chicken curry salad. It was huge portions and we both had hot Tea, which our server refilled many times. They were busy , it was a Saturday. But, the service was stellar and the food magnificent. Pita Jungle is new to me just this year. Though they have been around for many years, I had never visited them before until recently. Look what I've been missing!!   Love the food here, it also has lots of parking in the lot. Very Healthy."}
{"text":"Oh my! I cannot believe that I had never experienced all they have to offer. To be honest many people had told me that they liked Pita Jungle . But, they never told me the true details. For some reason I just never thought I needed to go here. But, my friend was here visiting from Denver and she said that she wanted to go there as there were none in Denver. I agreed to go. How bad could it be, plus I had never been there before. We drove past the one on University, But there is never anywhere to park over there ,so I said , \"let's go to the one on Southern\". I drive by it all the time. Anyway, long story short. It was beautiful outside on this day, so we sat on the Patio, which was really nice. Our server was an amazing young man, who was happy to answer all our questions, even though he was also very busy. His name was David and he was wonderful. The food was absolutely divine! Every piece of it. I had Coconut Curry soup, which was magical ,just a cup which was a large serving. I also got Hummus with Ahi Tuna. It was made to perfection. My friend got Broiled Chicken Pita,which she said was divine as well!We also shared a Spanakpita which was amazing.  The food here is wonderful! I cannot believe that I had waited so many years to visit it. Proving that things may not always be what you think. So you should always give everything a good try. Bathrooms were clean and so was the restaurant inside and out on the Patio as well. Lots of nice parking."}
{"text":"I have been a customer of this establishme however over a decade and have always thought it was some of the best food in town. Over the past year approxamitly I've seen a steady decline in there customer service  and it pains me to say I am close to never going here again. There food as i mentioned is never the problem, they have a great menu and everyhing on it is excellent.   Over the past year I've noticed it has slowly become harder and harder to place my orders over the phone due to long hold periods (5-10minutes). I tried staying mindful of how busy this place can be, assuming they'd get to me ASAP. This doesn't happen every time but enough to say it happens all to often. Up until recently I ordered take out 3 times a week. Over the past month 3 times in a row on seperate occasions I have call down there and was immediately placed on hold, which I don't mind as long as im promptly attended to as soon as possible but these were extremely long holds where I'd give up after 10 to 15 minutes. Naturally someone on hold can be forgotten by mistake from time to time, it happens. I've done it by accident myself, I wouldnt hold it against them if this happened every now and then on occasion. However lately it hasn't been out of the ordinary to be on hold for 5-10 minutes before being attended to, sometimes holding for quite some time then being hung up on. Last night I was placed on hold and waited 12 minutes trying to be patient and assuming they were busy. I hung up and thought I'd just called back 30 minutes later. This time the phone rang over and over and I couldn't get an answer. Me and my wife were set on having there food so we decided to wait another 15 minutes and call back. Once again we were instantly put on hold, I tried to get a word in to let them know I'd been waiting for 45min to put in an order, hoping they would at least assure me I would be attended to in a reasonable amount of time, but he didn't wait for me to say I was willing to hold he mechanically asked then immediately put me on hold. Once again I waited on hold for 8 minutes before I gave up. It is very disappointing, before this place became very popular the customer service was excellent and now it seems some of there workers have an attitude as if you are lucky to be eat there. I do however want to make it clear this review is a testament to the service I've received NOT the quality of the food. Pita Jungle over the past decade I've ate their food has progressively gotten better from what started already started as some of the best food in town. That in which has been what keeps me going back, but I will not continue to if I keep having such a hard time placing an order. When you place an order your hungry, having to hold and debate hanging up and calling back is too much of an irritation to deAl with when I'm ready to eat. Perhaps an online ordering system might be a good option for them if the incoming calls hard too hard to manage."}
{"text":"Bad food, expensive, not worth the money.  I got a to-go of falafel starter and 2 chicken  combo platter, and i regret spending $ 35 on this tasteless meal. The pita bread was cold and i opened up the box 5 minutes after getting the food.  Will prefer Greek Wraps/King Gyros to this place which are economical and tasty."}
{"text":"Excellent food.  Excellent service.  Beer list rocks. Cool hip vibe.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"Dry chicken served with the chicken combo... can tell it was cooked earlier and allowed to sit and then served ...the waitress was just thrilled about her job!"}
{"text":"Kevin convinced me to give the mall location another try.  Food was fresh,  fast and tasty. A bit different than the sit down locations,  but still good.  Nice alternative I  the food court to all the unhealthy fried choices."}
{"text":"The kitchen and wait staff needs to do a better job being aware of delays and customer mood.  Waited 20 minutes fur a table,  then another 20 to get our food.  No one came by to tell us how long it would be,  apologize for the delay or accommodate us. As nice as our server was,  she was clueless as to what we were experiencing. Once the food was dropped off we didn't see her until she brought the check."}
{"text":"Please,  please,  please change back your iced tea!! Admit that you made a mistake with this change and go back.  We used to come here at least once per week, sometimes twice per week - now maybe once per month.  All due to the HORRIBLE chemically tasting iced tea.  Even when we do come our bill now will always be $6 - $12 less since we only order water now.  (Good for us,  bad for you)   Saving a few cents per glass isn't worth losing loyal customers.  Every visit I ask,  as the universal answer is \"the owner decided to change it.\"  I'm reply,  I have to say,  \"tell your owner he is an idiot.\"  Seriously though,  this is a really bad business decision."}
{"text":"I attempted to order something to go, girl on the phone didn't know what was vegan or not, wasn't helpful and stated nothing was vegan. Not sure how much it differentiates between locations but glad I didn't order from here. I'd like to try to order again sometime since there is very limited vegan options around this area but  maybe another time."}
{"text":"My go to location for pita. Love the service love the food. It's decently priced, but the food is amazing. The service is quick and friendly. Always recommend this location."}
{"text":"Yum!!!  Excellent service and generous portion of chicken given with meal.  I love sitting inside or outside and meeting friends here for lunch, such a great location.  Something for everyone and great for kids."}
{"text":"I'm not usually one to write reviews but I decided Pita Jungle needed a review. My co-worker and I enjoy coming to Pita Jungle because of the healthier food options and the atmosphere. I have been coming here for two years and always enjoy the macro platter with grilled tofu and grilled veggies. The past couple of times we have been in the food has be less than average. I have sent my food back a couple times to be fixed and it was still just average. Such a disappointment because we really love this restaurant and used to really enjoy the food. We have been requesting Ana as our server for about two months now because of how personable she is, her desire to make our time there worth while, and her eagerness to make sure our food gets fixed. If it wasn't for the awesome service every week I'm not sure we would be back. If the kitchen could get it together you would receive 5 stars. So for now you get 4 stars because of the good service."}
{"text":"It was busy Sunday afternoon so we weren't greeted and they seemed to be missing a host. We then seated ourselves at an available table when it was then right away Rachel came to the rescue. She introduced herself as our server and we were well cared for. She was friendly, knowledgable of the menu aswell with the history of the place. The food was excellent, the lighting and overall ambience was tip top. Only advice for the business is the first impression is lacking an inviting atmosphere. A simple smile, hello, or just a \"I will be right with you.\" Goes along way."}
{"text":"I love this place. Great menu and tons to choose from. The staff is just a bunch of hippies but whatever. I recommend the chipotle chicken pizza, it is awesome! The pita is so fresh here as well. You will not be disappointed. The price is actually ok too! Hummus is great, teas and juices are even better. You won't regret this choice."}
{"text":"My fave is the chard ahi and hummus with warm puta !! To die for ! And the caprisi salad is so good also !!!"}
{"text":"The manager was excellent. The waitress was wonderful. The view and the staff is beautiful. Only bad thing was the food and the punctuality. The burger I ordered was cold. The potatoes were freezing. They took back the plate to be reheated. Came back out. . . Colder. Wtf?? Sunday evening during th rush hour isn't the best time to come. Only complaint. Still a good eat.  The manager was quick to fix everything. One of the best experiences having to deal with one regarding this. Would I come back? Possibly."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant. Great food, wonderful servers. Nice young vibe. My husband and I in our 60's and do so enjoy the service especially Rob the bartender. Great value and extensive take out menu. Thank you!"}
{"text":"I was really prepared to not like this place.  I've been here a few times, never been wow'd, and it's probably been a good year since I've been last.  So when my co-wkr wanted to go, I quietly groaned.  But it wasn't bad, not at all.  I had the seared yellow tuna over salad, fish was a bit flavorless but the salad w/ sesame dressing was actually surprisingly tasty.  My friend ordered the Carribean salad, think basically HUGE fruit bowl for $10.  Order this if you're too lazy to chop a variety of fruit and eat that for breakfast for a few days in a row.  I kid you not."}
{"text":"I've been to this location several times, but our latest experience was very poor.   First of all, I'm baffled how people can desire to come to such a place. Mediterranean food needs to stay overseas where it belongs. However, everyone has the freedom to choose what they want, so I'd never stand in your way. But this is rabbit food IMO!  With that out of the way, I appreciate the healthy options that Pita jungle offers people (the only reason I gave it 2 stars). There is obviously a market for this type of place and they've managed to handle it pretty well. Enough carrying on. We went there for our friends birthday, had a party of 12 (they were not busy by any stretch of the word). Once we were seated it took about 10 minutes to get our order in, and then we waited an hour+ for the food to come out, and several of the dishes were missing items. I get that we had a larger than standard party, but kitchens HAVE to be able to handle it especially while not being busy. The waitress did what she could, but the overall experience was pretty poor, hence the 2 stars.   If I'm forced to eat at a Pita Jungle again, I hope it'll be at a different location."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant by far! They have missed a few things in a few of my to go orders but have always corrected it by offering a coupon for a free entree or app. The food is very consistent and I probably eat there 2-3 days a week which is insane but I crave it!! I'll always be a loyal customer!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Healthy fresh Mediterranean cuisine in a funky artsy atmosphere.  Portions are large enough to share - lentil  Fetoosh Salad is amazing!"}
{"text":"Falafel pita (sandwich) was actually a pickle sandwich and I hate pickles. Why does the chef think pickles are a good thing to put in a falafel sandwich? And not just a few to add that flavor (which I find repulsive) but like 8 large ones that take over the whole Pita! There's practically no falafel at all- just two balls cut up- LOL! Then what was even worse was the spinach/rotini/pesto/green pepper/lemon salad. First off, green peppers are never a good ingredient in any dish - they do not add good flavor. Secondly, the spinach was drenched in pesto and lemon flavor which do not go together. I really don't know why I got this salad but it was definitely a waste of money and calories. They should take it off the menu. If I ever have to go back - which chances are I will because my family goes here often - I will stick with their black bean burger, hummus, and pita which doesn't disappoint."}
{"text":"Falafel is the bomb! Love the kids meal options also! Go early, this place gets packed for lunch."}
{"text":"Great lunch or dinner option if you're in Tempe. Everything is fairly healthy, flavorful, and creative. The hummus is awesome, especially the cilantro jalape√±o hummus. I've had the chicken del sol, the mahi mahi with pita chips, and the mahi burger in the past, and have enjoyed it all. I found the nutrition information listed online a little surprising in regard to serving size and sodium content, but I do love that they list this information.. More than most restaurants can say!"}
{"text":"This place is consistently fabulous.  Every time I've been there, I've gotten great food and great service.  One of my favorite offerings is the Moroccan Gazpacho.  If you love crunchy veggies and a lot of cilantro, this cold soup is for you.  It is accented with plump golden raisins -- which sounds a little weird, but it is divine.  It adds a little sweetness to the strong (but delicious) onion and cilantro.  The cold tuna pita is also wonderful.  It's served more or less like a salad, with one of Pita Jungle's sublime pita's on top.  It is also topped with sprouts and a light lemony dressing.  Another fine sandwich is the lavosh shawarma wrap.  Oh dear God....  It just makes me happy.  Juicy chicken, lettuce, tomato, pickles and a shmear of garlic sauce.  It's just so good!  If you love hummus, this is another must-try!  The cilantro jalapeno hummus is to die for!  I was actually hoping for it to have a little more of a kick -- it is incredibly mild, but very flavorful.  This is definitely one of my go-to places when friends come in town.  There is always good music in the air, and cool art/photography on the wall."}
{"text":"They almost had me at HORRIBLE when it came to food quality but their service topped it off. Wont be coming to this location again! Arcadia Location is MUCH FRIENDLIER. Felt like I was being served by a bunch of ignorant kids who just got out of school. ONE WORD EMPLOYEES!!!! Get some!"}
{"text":"I like this Pita Jungle location more than some others because the bar and seating is better laid out.  Great food and lots of vegetarian options.  Their cilantro jalape√±o hummus is top-notch.  Typical Levantine fare with some southwest flair.  Bartenders are really attentive, and they actually have a lot of tvs for sport-nerds like me.  Only complaint is the to-go orders come with cold pita bread in the bag it came in from the bakery.  The rest is great, but the bread from Albertson's doesn't feel very special.  Just warm those suckers up and put them in foil like every other Med - restaurant please.  Great spot particularly for desert ridge."}
{"text":"Pita Jungle really brings out the animal in all of us. The patio ambiance makes me feel that with a couple trips to Urban Outfitters/Goodwill I could be a long term hipster. Low key hipster vibes with a solid menu. I always get the chipotle chicken lavosh pizza. It's allegedly a shareable size but the day I share it is the day I stop going to Pita Jungle. Wait staff look super cool like they have a back story to share but too much angst to share it with you."}
{"text":"We got take out from this location the other night and the lavosh shawarma wrap was amazing. We also got two orders of hummus and both tasted great, they were a little light on quantity with one of them. Overall delicious dinner. It's a quick way to eat healthy."}
{"text":"While the atmosphere was nice out on the deck, the food was disappointing.  We ordered extra so we could have leftovers, but we left it all there. The name says pita jungle, but with their avocado hummus, they served subpar tortilla chips. So we ordered a side of pita bread, which came out whole instead of cut up nicely, and was quite tasteless and flat. You would think it would be their specialty since it's in the name. I spit out my bite of the salmon burger, and the side of potatoes should have never left the kitchen. The grilled vegetable lavash was also disappointing- the wrap was hard and dry, and the veggies were okay but they were smothered in garlic mash potatoes. I wouldn't have ordered it had I known there wouldn't be more fresh veggies. Never going back."}
{"text":"Arguably some of the best food in AZ. I've been going here since college. It's electric 'free-spirit' vibe only adds to the experience of some seriously amazing food. I've been to nearly all the locations and unlike some multiple-location restaurants each one is very similar to the other and carries its indie vibe through-and-through.  Would recommend the hummus w/ grilled chicken (if you're feeling adventurous go with the TRIO of hummus) Tsatziki and the 'Fruit and Cheese Fantasia.'   I've really never been let down in almost 10 years and the prices will work for a big or college-thrifty budget."}
{"text":"The hummus trio con pollo and pollo shawarma pita (per Stephanie) were great.  Nice beer list + happy hour.  4 thumbs up  + 1 big toe up = 5 stars."}
{"text":"Great place to eat, I love the jalapeno hummus and the chipolte chicken lavosh pizza. The atmosphere is alive, great energy and has a fresh new look with a friendly staff. I think this is the largest Pita Jungle that I have seen it's defiantly the nicest location. Lots of seating inside and out. Can't wait for the weather to get warmer so we can enjoy the patio area. The best part of having this great new place is that its only 1 block away from where I live, perfect walking distance.  The only thing I did not like about this place was that it closes way to early 10 pm and on First Friday it should stay open to at least 12 or 1am. Hope they adjust those hours soon, so Check it out.... =o)"}
{"text":"Awesome place...fantastic food! This is the best Pita Jungle yet! One suggestion...the happy hour is from 3-5pm. That's great if you're a high school student or unemployed...however, if you're neither of the previous, their happy hour doesn't suit you well."}
{"text":"Great food with large portions, upbeat and helpful service, nice location, easy parking (park in the parking garage in the alley in back) and reasonable prices.  Gluten free options abound, and all of them are tasty.  I've eaten here about five times and never been disappointed.  One occasion was a large group with shared tapas and the staff handled it very smoothly. My favorite dish is the hummus (regular plain Jane flavor) with chicken and cucumbers on the side to replace the pita.  Mmmm.  They also have a full bar and, at least the times I was there, a decent bartender."}
{"text":"I have been a fan of Pita Jungle for a while but I usually have eaten at the one in Desert Ridge.  Well Hubby one day said \"hey meet me for lunch at Pita Jungle near work on Indian School\"  I was like cool.  THEN he said \"you'll love this one, its way better than the one near our house\".  I gave him that skeptical look (oh you boys know which look I'm talking about...)  We went and had a great lunch and I have to tell you this place is way better.  The Jalapeno and Cilantro Hummus tastes like fresh Cilantro and has a little snap from the Jalapeno the way mother nature intended.  I love the Chicken Tikka Masala which is loaded with tender chicken in a sauce I can swim in.  My husband always orders the same thing - the Chicken Del Sol (which I am secretly envious of but refuse to order the same thing as he does.  I know I know, I'll have to get over that some day...)  I also tried the Hummus and Steak on the very last visit and have to say that this dish just rocks!  I think I could order anything here and it would be fabulous.  I love the funky Bohemian-cool atmosphere of this place too.  The servers are all really friendly and very efficient. Love this place!!!"}
{"text":"I find my thoughts and opinion on this pita jungle are similar to others who have been here.  The staff that were working, looked like they  were not happy and did not seem like they wanted to be there. Kind of scary looking to. Even tho i know thats not nice to say. Anyway this place seemed to lack quality compared to other pitas. ordered pickup and got the macro platter but when i got it was cold and they added no pita and  and you get more of a roll out attitude and presenentaion that is less caring and not up to the typical jungle pita standard and that the employers don't care for their jobs there and have no real desire of providing food in a desirable presentation either overall pita jungle is awesome and i really recommend but disappointed to report not this location. What shame its the closest one to me but my favorite spot is the one on e shea"}
{"text":"Mmm... Pita Jungle. I had been craving it all week and finally my lunch buddies decided they wanted to go. This location is BUSY at lunch time; full of corporate type as well as families with children (bad idea to bring kids at lunchtime, it's just WAY too packed). Yesterday we were seated at the bar. I was kind of irritated (only mildly) because when we walked in, we were greeted by the hostess and a guy I assume to be an owner or a \"big wig\". The \"big wig\" looked us up and down like we didn't really belong in the place, I really don't know what that was all about. So I asked if we could sit at the bar, we were initially told there was no room, but then an employee that was sitting at the bar decided to move to let us sit (duh). So that little irritation aside, we were seated and greeted again by a very nice bartender/server. I mentioned that I was STARVING and ordered the pita burrito, the bartender asked me if I've ever had the Medchilada. I said no, she said \"Oh you must try it, it's full of beans and you can add chicken.\" PERFECT. After a very short wait, our orders arrived. My friend had the Philly Chicken Pita and the other had the broiled chicken pita. EVERYONE was in pita heaven! My food was so flavorful! The chicken was moist and tender, there were about 3 different beans in the dish. I don't usually eat brown rice because it tends to be crunchy or too grainy, Pita Jungle has managed to make brown rice moist and enjoyable! very nice! The only thing I would change about my food is that it had A TON of chicken in it and it almost overwhelmed the dish. Pita Jungle is and will remain one of my favorite \"long lunch\" spots!"}
{"text":"Refreshingly fresh and healthy food in Scottsdale, AZ.  Great happy hour with delicious small plates. Reasonably priced.  On those hot days I headed here for meetings and never disappointed. Their hummus (trio) is excellent, served with warm pitas."}
{"text":"Help me understand why, after 20 years, you would start adding mushrooms to the spicy chicken wrap? I have been going to Pita jungle since it was in the original location on Apache. I've been eating the spicy chicken wrap for 20 years. Yes, I'm old. All of a sudden yesterday mushrooms show up in the wrap.  The waiter fixed it and came back with the right order. But I was shook."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to eat. The red pepper hummus and the chicken salad are pretty awesome. They also have a good idea with the kids meal."}
{"text":"Excellent service and quick turnaround on the appetizers and main course. We came at about 6:30ish on a Sunday night and it was steady but not super busy. My green iced tea was excellent and kept full the entire time as were the other drinks at our table. My Philly Steak pita was really good and when I asked for no peppers or mozzarella and add tomato she said no problem and it came out perfect- the other meals were also stellar. As everyone inhaled their meals and all gave a thumbs up for what they had. We also ordered desserts- rice pudding, raspberry sorbet and the turtle cheesecake.  All delicious!!! Thanks!!!"}
{"text":"This has been one of our go to places at Norterra since it opened with us eating there a couple of times a month. Sadly the food and service has declined so much that we do not see returning. The last time we were in, the pitas with our Hummus Trio were cold and soggy and looked moldy. Last night at dinner it took forever to get our Hummus Trio and the pitas were cold and we did not get the extra pitas we ordered. It then took about half an hour to get dinner. My wife ordered her wrap without onions and, you guessed it, the wrap was loaded with onions.  My daughter had a pita with her kid's meal. We asked for some hummus to go with her pita. You would think with the long wait and the problems with the appetizer that the hummus would be no charge - it was $2 for a couple of tablespoons of hummus. People around us were sending back their food and complaining as well.  One of the families complaining was from Canada. How embrassing to think that they may have been spending the only Saturday night of their vacation at a place that cannot serve basic food in a timely and edible fashion.  And, no, it was not that busy to the extent that is ever an excuse."}
{"text":"I come here just for the hummus. It's freshly made and so damn delightful.   The pasta is also a go to dish of mine.  They can get busy on the weekends so prepare for a wait. Staff was friendly."}
{"text":"You know a place is going down hill when management is not concerned with customer service... Do NOT join them for Happy Hour or Tapas because honestly, good luck if you do.  Time to change my post- work out routine because they just lost a fairly frequent customer over a plate of olives... Sound silly? I agree! Long story short I was sitting at the bar decompressing and wasn't aware that by the time I ordered it was six minutes past the Happy Hour cut-off time. Simple solution... override the system and tell me thats the last Tapas order. Pita Jungles management's solution, who is apparently not concerned at all with customer satisfaction,  give me the lame \" the computer wont let me do it,\" response. I just want some olives! There are to many restaurants in town for me to frequently visit one with management like that. I've been in industry I was not impressed. Corporate apathy is not my thing, if your into it than by all means go sit at their bar."}
{"text":"This place is great.  Never had a bad meal.  You should absolutely try the jalape√±o cilantro hummus + siracha.  I usually stick with the macro platter because it's healthy and their beans are amazing.  The veggies are always perfectly steamed and most importantly, makes me feel good.  I've never had better beans.  Can't go wrong with the pesto pizza + chicken or the lentil fetoosh salad - a salad so grand I cried when the waitress set it before me.  Service has never, ever been an issue for me here.  I am always treated like a king here."}
{"text":"Haven't been to Pita Jungle in a while...well we live in NJ so we only get it on our visits to AZ. This place never disappoints! Huge shout out to Josh for recommending an off the menu special that was delicious - shrimp, mango, ginger, rice, veggies and some heat to keep the flavors lingering on your tongue!"}
{"text":"Tonight unfortunately was the worst pita jungle experiences I've ever had and it was for my rehearsal dinner before my wedding.   Normally I love pita jungle food is good and service is relatively good. It was a regular Friday date night for my fianc√© and I for years and still is. I rented out the back patio and because I was expecting of a party of 20 and or so and had ordered catering two weeks in advanced. I was already sad because a few family members got sick and couldn't make it to the rehearsal but looking forwarding to eating at our favorite restaurant and sharing it with our family who have never been there before. First of all they got the time I asked wrong. So they were not prepared once we arrived. I reserved the patio just incase. However no one was even in the Restaurant so that was clearly a waste of $50. Being unprepared my family and bridal party had to push the tables and chairs together so we can all sit together, then once the food was served it was served on plastic delivery plates like we were at a picnic or something.   I was very disappointed as the staff was not very attentive we only had one girl who can't clear plates all by herself there should have been another person helping her. No one checked if we would like water and the way things were served was very trashy. I honestly could have served a better small dinner at my house then pay all that money for what we got. It made me feel embarrassed on how everything was since my fianc√© and I raved about this place.    Also when my bother asked for more ice tea from the server because we ran out of the green tea she said \"no\" seriously? Something along the lines of that was all we got, or paid for.    I would not recommend catering or private parties there. It was not very special for a tiny rehearsal dinner."}
{"text":"As a Vegan I was extremely excited after looking up Jungle Pita's menu and seeing how many Vegan options there were and of the course the decent prices. Immediately after walking in, I was impressed  with the design. And the food was really good! The reason why I gave such a low score is because of the customer service. We ordered our food to go, the girl at the register was rude. She seemed as if she was doing us a favor by walking over to help us. She made no eye contact and was very short. My mother in law made a little joke to try and make things \"a little less awkward\" but that went u noticed. They weren't busy (a lazy Sunday afternoon.)"}
{"text":"Went here expecting more of a fast food atmosphere, its casual but you sit down and have a server. The food was ok, nothing special. I had a chicken pita, my son had the gyro. He liked it. The pita bread they serve with the Taziki appetizer wasn't that warm and isnt your traditional pita, they should serve it with the one they use for the gyro.I dont think ill go back, to many awesome places around here and the food was a bit over priced and just average tasting."}
{"text":"Awesome pita & middle eastern food.  HUGE portions.  We liked the falafel, hummus and the chicken lavash sandwich (forget what they call it).  I wish we had these in Massachusetts."}
{"text":"Delicious. Best hummus and taboule ever. Highly recommend the spanakopita. I am one person and was full on those two starters but I splurged for baklava which was also perfect. I hail from SoCal and used to live in Phoenix area. After a decade in LA I finally found a Greek place comparable to Pita Jungle. A must try place and the decor is spot on for bougie people everywhere."}
{"text":"I actually really enjoyed my first visit to the Pita Jungle! I wasn't expecting much, but it surprised me!  My wife and I ordered the Spanakopita as an appetizer to share and we both loved it. It was by far the best thing we had here, although our entrees were not too bad either. I ordered some kind of spicy chicken wrap, which was decent, but I don't think I would order it again as my wife's pesto turkey wrap was much better (and I don't even like turkey).  One thing to note is that the portion sizes for the entrees are quite large. My wife and I discovered that even with me being a big eater we can probably get away with sharing one entree along with an appetizer. The prices seemed expensive at first, but once you realize that one entree can be shared they don't seem too unreasonable.  The service is not bad, but one thing I didn't like was that the wait staff dresses casually and with no uniform. It is hard to tell who works there and who doesn't. It might make the employees more comfortable, but some of the things they were wearing seemed a bit unprofessional.  In any case, Pita Jungle is a unique restaurant that seems to offer tasty foods that are healthy as well. I think we will be back."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Pita Jungle in the valley! The service is good, good is excellent. Can't get much better than this location!"}
{"text":"Let me start out by saying I love love LOVE pita jungle and their food. I've never had one bad meal there ever. This particular visit was extremely unenjoyable. It wasn't the food or timing but the terrible service given to me and my family. His name is Mark. I repeat MARK. Do not get Mark as a server. I only know his name because of looking at the check. It was like talking to a wall. I would ask him if I was able to make a modification on my order and he just stared down on his notepad and stayed silent. Not even a head nod or any simple gesture to clarify my questions. Then as we are still eating he dropped the check and Togo cups that we didn't even ask for on the table. Making us feel very rushed and that he was trying to get us out of here. The only thing that came out of his mouth the entire time was \"Goodbye\". Well, goodbye to you Mark."}
{"text":"Happy hour is a good deal at the Pita Jungle. The tapas (small, sharable plates) are tasty. There is a cilantro jalepeno hummus is scrumptious. The pitas could've been warmer/fresher when served."}
{"text":"Great servers great food. Our server was amazing!   But the hostess was terrible. You can tell she doesn't want to be here. Every customer that comes in is an inconvenience to her. She scowled at my wife when asked if we could sit out side. I have never written a yelp review and it was so bad I had to create an account just for this. She needs to go. I was embarrassed for this place just watching every customer looked shocked at the disrespect coming from the hostess. If she is trying to scare people away so she didn't have to work she is doing a great job."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Healthy food, great tastes, and a fun atmosphere.  Be careful when you order out for lunch though! They've gotten my order wrong several times but have been extremely accommodating and apologetic- offering comped meals, etc."}
{"text":"Come here quite often for lunch, must have been a bad day.  I was here on Friday the 23rd with a group of colleagues. As usual, we ordered a couple plates of hummus - green. As I'm scooping some of it up on my fork, I notice a round green object hiding in my scoop. I assumed it as a jalape√±o since the hummus is jalape√±o/cilantro.... NOPE. As I inserted that delicious bite of hummus into my mouth, I found that the little green object was a ruse; a rubber band in disguise.  I informed our waiter, who was pretty slow on the refills and wasn't quite aware of how to place drinks on the table without excess body contact or reach. He replaced the hummus, not providing any apology. The replacement wasn't even comped.   On a positive note the hummus today was much better than last time - rubber band free. As was the service."}
{"text":"The ratio of pita to hummus is upsetting and, frankly, unacceptable. Somewhat tasty however."}
{"text":"A must: hummus. Also, pesto pizza. This place is rad. Good prices, out of control good happy hour prices, great staff, amazing and unique food."}
{"text":"This place would get 5 stars everytime if they would just add more wait staff. Been in here multiple times and every waitress has too many tables so it takes a while to get service but when they do come around they are friendly and apologetic about the long wait. Food is phenomenal every time but management, please get more staff on each shift!"}
{"text":"Incredibly delicious I love it. Full of flavor and healthy with a quick service. I recommend this highly."}
{"text":"This was only the second time I have ever been to this place and it was really good both time. This last time my server Adam was on top of everything. I never had to ask for him to refill my water. The appetizers and food came out very quickly and everything was delicious. I will come back any time."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant of all time. Healthy, fresh and fabulously low key. Love it!"}
{"text":"Good food-menu is suitabke for anyone's dietary needs. In house Sangria is very good!!!"}
{"text":"I love eating here. Great food and lively service. The falafel and hummus are my absolute favorite. Love the atmosphere as well."}
{"text":"Tonight was the first time I've experienced Happy Hour at Pita Jungle. A frequent diner at the North Scottsdale location, I often opt for the Philly Pita (with steak, if you please), which is a bit of deliciousocity for your taste buds. Tonight however was out of the norm as I opted for the Happy Hour menu. Throughout the night our table tried almost everything on the menu, a few of my faves included the mini version of hummus, the mushrooms sauteed in lemon, and the falafel nuggets of joy. The best part of this lil outing was the bill, which at around $2 to $3 per item led to an outrageously low bill. This is a great place for the 'on the budget in a recession' happy hour. Win for the Pita Jungle, even beyond the normal Philly Pita 'o' goodness."}
{"text":"Nothing more to ask for when you want a delicious, healthy meal; upbeat ambiance and great service.  Their menu has many vegetarian options including the falafel wrap, veg sandwiches/burgers, superb grilled veg. salad and the must have Hummus trio! Nevertheless, the shawrma chicken wrap, chicken salad, fish (LOVE the wood fired mahi mahi) and other meat items are delicious as well! The spicy chicken wrap is big and good for sharing.  On a pleasant weather evening or brunch time, their patio seating is great. Also love the happy hour and reverse happy hour after 9 pm with $2 yummy margaritas!!  Like I said, nothing more to ask for when you get just everything at one place. Thanks Pita jungle for your awesome service and tasty food!!"}
{"text":"Great food, good for dates AND takeout! Good  happy  hour  deals  and  half off wine bottles on certain days."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of Mediterranean food, so when I was in town, I had to visit.  Their hummus is amazing with their pita bread.  The portions are big and definitely worth the price.  Only peeve with this place is that it can get majorly cramped and crowded during lunch time. Try going a little bit after the lunch rush to avoid the crowds."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised. Mediterranean Combo, Lavon Swarsza plate all very nice, delicious and healthy. I would eat here again."}
{"text":"I love this Pita Jungle!! Hayley and Eric at the bar offer great suggestions !!  And they are cool! Mark the manager- again cool! We had tapas- highly recommend the hummus trio, tomatoes and mozzarella and the pita with herbs- also has onions, olives and tomatoes-- I don't recommend the mussels! Non happy hour- tuna pita awesome!! Then lavosh -- get the house lavosh!! Veggies!! Omg!!  You can't go wrong- but the DR location  is the best!!"}
{"text":"Pita Jungle is a vegetarian delight! Their menu has many vegetarian options that taste great. Start with an iced tea, and make sure to get a to-go cup when you leave to really get your money's worth.   The hummus is creamy and seriously some of the best I have ever had. The trio allows you to sample all flavors while you pick a favorite. I usually need to order an extra pita to finish the hummus (can't waste something this good!).   For the main course, I love the lentil fetoosh salad, and it is very filling. The 1000 bean pita is also great, and also very filling. Whenever they have the lentil soup- get it. The roasted potatoes are a nice accompaniment albeit a little heavy if you're eating beans and lentils.   The dessert menu leaves something to be desired, but just explore downtown and you'll find other tempting options.   The lunch rush can get very busy, but just go a little early or a little late and you won't have an issue. Parking can be annoying because the garage is awkward but you shouldn't have a problem if you avoid the lunch rush. There is street parking available up and down the neighborhoods surrounding Pita Jungle.   Service can be hit or miss. Sometimes it rocks, other times it's slow and you feel like you are annoying the staff. I don't really care about the staff's moods, so I don't hold it against them.  Vegetarians and meat eaters - enjoy!!"}
{"text":"I love this place and for those wondering.....no, it's not only pita's :) My fave is the hummus with chicken and toasted pine nuts. Very very good. Can't go wrong at Pita Jungle.  It's good food, a lot of vegetarian dishes, however there are some very excellent meat plates as well."}
{"text":"This place is hands down good every time we go! My husband and I have been going ever since this location has opened. Even though we have seen some turn around with staff, they still are able to find very friendly respective employees (which makes your dining so much better!) The food is more on the healthy side, so if you are looking for something fattening, I would not suggest this place. Happy hour is pretty good as well, and the hummus trio is amazing!"}
{"text":"Starters were a bit mediocre,  the one I got anyways, seemed reheated, not fresh.   But main courses are HUGE and so tasty.  Great for sharing.  Good prices and of course endless refills.   The place is huge and has a nice modern vibe to it. Not to mention all the mod servers.  I liked it.   Great for large groups :)  And a healthy choice"}
{"text":"We decided to try a different PIta Jungle that we hardly ever go to.  We waited to be seated and we arrived before another bigger group but was seated after them.  She came out and verified that there were 2 of us but there was 6 of us.  So she took back the wrong group and had to end up waiting a little longer.  We were starving and with 3 kids.  We were seated and ordered our food which arrived rather quickly.  Our server was great and on top of things.  I would return here because i love their food and that location isn't too bad."}
{"text":"I love eating here. Their food always tastes really fresh and its really affordable.  I usually always have exceptional service.  I normally eat at theTempe location but think I like the newer Mesa location better.  I've eaten lots of different meals there and they are all good.  I'm not afraid to try something I haven't eaten.  I tend to crave Pita Jungle quite often."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is very nice and relaxed. Table for two on a Wednesday not too busy and waited a notably long time for our dinner.  I am disappointed to see they use plastic containers  for take out as well as plastic bags.    Since I am vegan, I got the spicy chicken wrap and subbed for tofu instead. The wrap was yummy, over stuffed and messy but nevertheless yummy."}
{"text":"I am reviewing the catering services provided by this restaurant.  Recently I worked with the wonderful staff at Pita Jungle to provide catering for 200 people at short notice following a family emergency.  They were compassionate, kind and so helpful in aiding us in selecting choices, worked on a tight deadline and had all the food delivered on time, well presented, and everything was delicious.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Decent food and service. Nothing is spectacular, but I eat here weekly because it's close to work. I'd recommend the chicken or phillies that they offer."}
{"text":"About three years ago I went to Pita jungle in north Scottsdale. And haven't been back since it was a long ways to go. A friend  and myself met yesterday at the Scottsdale and Shea location. I was very eager to eat there again. However this was probably the worst lunch I have ever ordered and will not be back. I ordered the Philly steak it was so over cooked that I could not even identify The peppers and onions. The meat was so over seasoned and salty, parts of the meat were even burned. Sorry for the poor review but it's the truth."}
{"text":"I can see that there are two other reviews here, another from a big PJ fan, Brian.  Similar experience.  We ordered some staples that we normally get at other PJ locations.  Got the Humus with Grilled Chicken.  Chicken was dry, reddish (too much paprika?) and no flavor.  Not the juicy grilled-to-perfection chicken that we're used to getting at the other locations.  Tabuli salad did not have enough dressing and was sandy - they didn't soak the wheat enough?, and the the rice was undercooked in the grape leaves wraps.    Not to mention, the tables are flimsy and cheap looking, wobble, and just an overall horrible experience.  We paid, and before walking out, decided to share this feedback directly with the manager.  She mentioned that they were still trying to work out kinks, and mentioned that she went through the stuffed grape leaves we returned with the chef and agreed that it was undercooked -- which didn't stop her from serving it to others right as she was talking to us!    We also waited ~ 40 minutes for our food.  Was barely warm, and we had our 2 year old daughter who loved mac and cheese, but this one came cold and clunky, so she said \"I don't like this mac and cheese!\".  Very disappointing.  It is worth to drive the extra few miles to the Shea location."}
{"text":"As a person who eats vegetarian food at home and out in the world, I had received many recommendations to try Pita Jungle by the time I actually sat down to have a meal at what I imagine Applebee's would be like, if it were based in Beirut.  Off to an awkward start from the words \"Pita\" and \"Jungle.\" What image is that supposed to conjure up exactly? The menu seems to be grounded in Middle Eastern food (Pita) and is simultaneously out-of-the-box, unpredictable, kooky (JUNGLE!). For the three of us who dined here, they missed both of these targets.  Pita Jungle has some Middle Eastern basics, even going as far as offering a fettoush salad, which I appreciate. But the food lacked the freshness and lusciousness of real Middle Eastern food. Half a plate of tasteless-but-fresh-looking veggies, without a drop of olive oil, lemon juice or vinegar in sight. For anyone who has traveled to the Middle East, or whose family comes from there and knows home cooked food of these styles, I think you'll be underwhelmed by the flavors of these look-alike dishes.  The \"jungle\" part of this menu is just unappetizing. Looking for Chipotle Chicken Lavosh Pizza? Of course not. No one is. Well, maybe Guy Fieri.  If you're looking for no frills, healthy-ish and affordable food I think Pita Jungle is probably a safe and consistent bet, especially in Scottsdale.  I'll take my chances with the salad bar at Whole Foods instead. At least they know how and when to use salt."}
{"text":"I was a little skeptical going to this place because it seemed....well a little too healthy for me. i was surprised to find that the food was very rich and full of flavor with heaping portions.  The restaurant has a great new-age southwestern feel to it that the ladies at the table seemed to love. I thought it was a nice relaxing environment, which was nice.  The waitress that we had was awesome. She had good recommendations and remembered all of our meals by memory. She swung by or table just the right amount of times. I had no idea what the food was but she was willing to explain everything to me.  The food was different. I had never really tried this kind of food before. It had awesome flavor and the portions were large like everyone else has been saying.   The only reason that I did not give them a perfect score was that we had to wait a good 20 - 30 minutes when the place was not very full and the food just was not my favorite. I believe that it was good for what it was."}
{"text":"As usual another awesome experience with our favorite server Joshua Berk.  Food done quickly and delicious! Witnessed GM being attentive to customer with special food needs!"}
{"text":"I'm giving this place five stars because there isn't a place like it. Healthy, Mediterranean, interesting hummus options, and great drink specials? Come on, this place has it all if you like all of those things. The name made me think this place was going to be a walk-in joint with a sub-par menu. I ate at the downtown PHX location, and I was completely surprised! Eat out on the patio if you can. It's a lovely setting with stringed lights overhead, and alley views. You get a real urban setting here, and delicious food. I had a pesto turkey pita and my husband had the Philly cheese steak one. We ordered the cilantro jalapeno hummus = this is a must try. We didn't go during happy hour, but the menu had really great prices $3-$7 for drinks and small plates. Portions are generous. ambiance is great for date nights or casual drinks with friends."}
{"text":"Just spent $50 on a pick up for humus and chicken! Had no pita and had no chicken, oooh sorry after I repeated myself 3 times on the phone. And she gives me a bag of cold pita. Really roll those eyes at someone else, taking my money somewhere else. I eat here every week . Bye!"}
{"text":"Pita Jungle Chandler location...What is going on? I have frequented this location for the last few years and to be quite honest I have never been 100% satisfied because it is always hit and miss. Either you get crappy service and good food or crappy food and good service.   In this neck of the woods you really don't have a neighborhood hangout that offers healthy fair. So it is the GO to place when you want to stay close to home and don't want the big chain restaurants nearby. Over the years I have come to order the same thing because it was simple and easy. The chicken and hummus plate with a greek salad is my usual. About 2 months ago my roomie and I went in and we switched it up a bit and got the salmon and hummus with the greek salad. The salad had wilted greens. I am not talking about one or two but practically the whole salad. Well I finally flagged down my waitress whom I show the lettuce to and ask for a new salad. Well she has this look on her face like....what's wrong with that lettuce? She brings a new salad with the same crappy lettuce. She did not even ask if this particular salad was OK. This makes no sense for a restaurant that touts \"fresh and healthy\" in their mantra to serve this type of produce. Not to mention it is right next to Sprouts and Whole Foods is down the street. Hello Pita Jungle...if your produce stinks go buy fresh produce.  Anyway I emailed the store and got a prompt reply back from the manager. She stated that they have been having some issues with the line, thanked me for my email and sent me a $25 gift card. I have to say I was very impressed. Especially since I really did not want to write a bad review because this was an easy fix. As for the crappy service I could live with it on occasion. I know good help is hard to find in the restaurant business.  So tonight I decided to get my usual with my gift card. First off I see they have online ordering, which by the way did not work. So I call. I must have called 5 times before someone answered the phone and the phone rang for well over a minute once. I thought maybe they were closed on Mondays. Finally someone picks up and takes my order.  I get there a few minutes later and the place is jumping but not crazy crowded. However, the staff is always running around crazy but it looks like they are getting things done. I am waiting to get my order and 3 people asked if I was being helped. Great Service btw. But alas always hit or miss. My food comes out a few minutes later and I am off.   I get home anxious to see if my greek salad got an upgrade to better lettuce. Lets just say it was the same as my previous visit. I had half the nerve to take a pic to show but it really does not matter. I don't feel like wasting anymore time or energy on this place. To top off the bad lettuce the pita was stone cold. You never get cold pita when you dine-in but my pita was hard as a rock. That was the final straw. The thing is they have so much potential at this location. But they just can't get it right.  I will no longer frequent this Pita Jungle. There might be a hope for the other locations but as far as Chandler goes spare yourself the game of Russian Roulette."}
{"text":"A manager for PJ reached out to me offering a gift card to try their location again. I went this past Sunday having picked my son up at the airport and wanting takeout for lunch. We ordered the salmon burger and an order of hummus with chicken. Much to my delight everything was just as ordered and I didn't have to do the checking myself at the counter. Nice job PJ on Frank Lloyd Wright!"}
{"text":"I love this place. The service is always great and the food is healthy and so tasty. I can't get enough of the garlic portobello flatbread pizza and the falafel platter.   They're really fast with to-go orders, but when I can, I love dining in. The atmosphere reminds me a lot of the restaurants around Seattle (where I moved from).   Such great staff. They're all friendly and laid-back. Really makes me feel comfortable."}
{"text":"I had a waitress tonight who was fantastic,  and she made my dining experience fantastic. My daughter was visiting from out of town and she is very hard to please, but thankfully for the staff, she really was impressed. Thanks   for your attention to detail, that made my day and I will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"I don't think anyone makes lentil beans as good at myself!  No one except for Pita Jungle.  I love their lentil beans with brown rice and Caramelized Onions.  I love the saut√©ed vegetables.  I love the saut√©ed mushrooms.  I love every single soup.  I love the hummus and pita bread.  I love the salmon salad.  I love the Sangrias.  I love the garlic mashed potatoes.  I love the Shawarma Roasted Chicken Pita.  I love the Curry Chicken salad. I love everything about Pita Jungle.  Everyone does.  Often time when I'm ordering to go, I hear other customers ordering things to go with no hesitation, no questions ... they know exactly what they want to order."}
{"text":"How long have we waited for Pita to open downtown? How long? Boy, oh boy, oh boy!! It was a glorious day when we (my lovely co-workers at Arizona Theatre Company) heard the news that Pita Jungle was open for business. Of course, the best part is that we can walk there from our office on 5th Ave and Roosevelt. Also fabulous is the food! Delicious food!  I've been for lunch a few times now, and I want to do a happy hour there soon. I keep eyeing the bar area ....   My favorite thing to do at Pita is split two specific items with a friend.   1. Cilantro Jalapeno Hummus (the small platter is plenty!): Chickpea puree with cilantro, jalapeno and tahini sauce, seasoned with fresh garlic and lemon juice and topped with pico de gallo.   and  2.  The Glazed-Chicken Lavosh Pizza: crispy wood-fired Lavosh crust topped with honey mustard glazed chicken, wood-fired onions, cheddar, feta, mozarella and herbs.  I don't even like hummus THAT much, but I really love THIS hummus.   The only thing I have had (so far) that I wasn't crazy about was the Taboule salad, but maybe I'm just not a Taboule kind of gal?  Overall, pretty delicious. I've noticed that they're still working out some issues. There have been a few customer service inconsistencies, but I'm still in the \"grateful they're open\" stage."}
{"text":"Loved their yellowfin tuna salad with strawberries and pineapples. We usually call ahead and get their food to go and it usually takes 45 minutes or longer which I do not understand. Especially for a salad or cold pita. Food is delicious and very fresh however seems a bit pricey for the serving size."}
{"text":"Really great service. Our server suggested off the menu specials that are only served at the Scottsdale location and they were AMAZING. I have a pita closer to my home but will go out of my way for this location."}
{"text":"When I am out to eat something that makes a huge difference is how they act with my odd requests. I have an extremely limited diet and with that comes some pretty odd requests. They have always been awesome with my requests of no bread, and please don't season that.  I think they have the best humus I have ever had. I can't eat bread but man oh man its good with cucumbers!  One recommendation is if you are getting it to go, call it in then pick it up. Take out seems to take a while."}
{"text":"Yesterday my wife Jenn and I went here for lunch and I kept reassuring her that this place's food is just awesome. I had my traditional chicken with hummus and Jenn had the salmon and garlic mashed potatoes. Now my wife has a tendency to eat kinda fast when she's found the right dish and to say that she vaporized her salmon is putting it mildly! LOL! I couldn't stop laughing at how much she enjoyed her food. For her first time there she was really impressed and I mentioned that it gets better. Their salads are good and she and I will definitely venture out here again. It was busy but we were able to sit immediately and the wait for our food didn't take long (the salmon usually takes about 15-20 minutes). It was cooked perfectly and to see my wife smile was well worth it. When we left we passed by the notorious Amy's Baking Company and just drove by. Although going there would be tempting to see all the drama, its not worth spending money on a place that violates labor laws, serves horrible food and where Gordon Ramsay walked out. Thankfully Pita Jungle is right there in a rather busy complex and we can't wait to go there again soon!"}
{"text":"Pita Jungle is incredible! Every location I've been to is clean, professional, healthy! A HIGH Recommend!"}
{"text":"This place not only has great food but a real friendly staff.  We need to eat here more often. I love there falafel and my hubby had the gyro.  Soooo yummy.  There special tonight was a watermelon smoothie so I just had to have that too.  It was refreshing and tasted just like fresh watermelon."}
{"text":"Here's the short version:  Pita Jungle's Food=AWESOME Pita Jungle Tempe's Service=HORRID....but worth it for the food.  Here's the long version:  The food is so fresh, and the rotating specials are awesome.  The cilantro jalepeno hummus is the BOMB, I love all the pizzas, and the lavosh wraps are so yummy! When ever someone is visiting- I bring them here!  The funny thing about pita jungle's tempe location is that 90% of the servers pretty much provide the opposite of customer service. They are all super edgy and have probably heard of every band ever way before they were on itunes. I'm pretty sure having piercings and obscure/ironic tshirts are madatory for hire. For instance- one time I was there for lunch and a waitress was holding a tray of cups of water. Some one bumped into her and they all came crashing down. Another server who was standing right next to her, looked, smirked, and went back to doing what ever pita jungle employees do.   Ask for the cherry lemonade- not on the menu but it will change your life."}
{"text":"I love to eat here. The food is good, light and fresh. Tasty cocktails if you're in the mood and convenient for a date night with the hubby.  My favorites are the tzatziki and the chicken phily pitta."}
{"text":"I love the Pita Jungle so...SO much. I have had probably everything on the menu over the years and it is all divine. I love their curry chicken salad, their tabouleh, chicken del sol, black bean burgers, nachos, pitas, pita chips....the hummus is a gift from heaven. I have no idea what they put in it (magic? love? Unicorn tears? Crack? It is all possible) but it is one of my favorite things on this planet. I could eat a drum of it. This location is loud, but it always has great, prompt service. The hipsters are always smiling and attentive and make this place just a little funky. Do not ever stop doing what you do Pita Jungle!"}
{"text":"Our server James was incredible: cute, patient, attentive and funny.  I'm STILL thinking about that Passionfruit Lemonade...*smacking my lips*.  The Chipotle Bean Burger and Chicken Pita (forgot which one my friend got, but she didn't leave a crumb!) was yummy.  The potatoes had good seasoning but were a tad overdone.  Dessert was DELICIOUS!  That Turtle Cheesecake is superb!  They lost 1 point for the rude employee by the payout area who seemed annoyed when we asked for dressing and ketchup AND for that cleaning lady who started sweeping around us while we were eating.  I absolutely HATE that!"}
{"text":"Pita Jungle is simply awesome.  I've been to the Tucson locations, which are also excellent, but this was my first time to the Mesa location, and must say I think this is the best.  Food is OUTSTANDING... fresh, high quality, tasty, healthy, and inexpensive.  What more could you ask for?  Gazpacho is fantastic.  Staff is great... beautiful interior of the restaurant, and comfortable patio.  Very highly recommended.  Can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Stopped to have dinner before a movie. We waited less than 5 min for a table. The food was great! We will return!"}
{"text":"This Pita Jungle location had great Customer service and friendly staff, the were quick clean and efficient. My cup was always filled with their delicious fresh brewed (cause you can taste the difference when tea has been sitting too long - ick) tropical black iced tea. I had the Mahi with red hummus and it was delicious, fresh and cooked perfectly. My only criticism would be that serving the pita chips already placed in the hummus made some of them soggy.. just bring them on the side and your presentation is still pretty."}
{"text":"So I lied... I somehow ended up at this Pita Jungle again, tonight. We were in the area and it just happened...   I just got home and crawled into bed and was trying to drift off to sleep but couldn't. I kept thinking about the 3 star review I gave this location just earlier today.   Tonight we had a totally different experience at this Pita Jungle location. We sat ourselves, shortly after our server made her way to our table. She was very friendly and quick. She took our order immediately, brought our order out within 5 minutes of us placing it and filled up our water glasses so often they never reached the halfway point.   It doesn't stop there either. My dinner companion wasn't sure about the Chicken Shawarma that he ordered. For some reason he thought that the \"red sauce\" was missing. According to the server and the menu there was no such sauce... It then became the mystery sauce. Our waiter was so concerned about him enjoying his meal that she checked with him several times to see if he wanted something else.   At the end of our evening, without our request our server brought us our check and low and behold, she had removed the Chicken Shawarma from our ticket. Talk about service. We were so impressed that we made sure to thank her in the form of dolla' bills.   I changed my mind about this location. I'll happily be back after such a positive experience tonight. Hopeful we get the same waitress that we had, next time.   P.S. I got the hummus again, just as delicious as always. This time I requested that they bring a big bowl of cucumbers and tomatoes instead of pita bread. You should have seen the size of the bowl they brought out! Wow. I am a happy and full girl!"}
{"text":"We have been waiting for PJ to open at this location! They have not disappointed on any of the 4 occasions (plus one take out). We have been lucky enough to have the same server every time. He's very attentive and thoughtful. The hostesses have all been warm and every time we visit, a manager stops by to check on us.  We never stray from the chicken and hummus with a side of caramelized cauliflower. I'm salivating just typing about it. The kids menu is full of healthy options and they are great about accommodating substitutions.  Pita Jungle is always my first choice whenever we go out. I'm so excited to have this new location so close to home!"}
{"text":"First, let me preface this with the fact that I love Pita Jungle. I go to the one on Frank Lloyd Wright regularly. When my family and I found ourselves in the Shea area around dinner time, it was between PJ and Coconuts... we should have just chosen Coconuts. There was a short 5 minute wait for a table to be cleaned, but after we were seated, we sat... and we waited.. and we waited.... and waited some more... 20 minutes later, I got up and asked the hostess if there was a server assigned to our table because no one had stopped by yet. I sat back down and watched the hostess do absolutely nothing. Five minutes later, we got up, left and walked right over to Coconuts which was AMAZING!! I don't think I will ever be attempting to go to this particular PJ again..."}
{"text":"The Pita Jungle in Tempe is by far the best PJ around!  Love their food - the hummus is the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"Wow I absolutely love this place ! The hummus is amazing, and the whole menu. Everything I've tried has been delicious. Also, I don't feel like a fat lard after I finish my whole plate because it's not greasy gross food. Anytime someone comes into town or deciding where to eat I recommend Pita Jungle."}
{"text":"I found the Pita Jungle by accident while looking for another restaurant. We HAD to use the restroom so after no luck with the other place we just decided to stay at the Pita Jungle.  One of the main reasons was because when we used their restroom it was SUPER clean and so was the eating area and kitchen. Another reason was that the food smelled lovely!  Fortunately, we decided to give it a try. The staff was super nice and helpful. We opted for the outside seating which was lovely in the perfect weather! The patio was super nice and I felt like I was in Europe NOT in the U.S. I really loved the ambiance, decor, and presentation.  I ordered the shrimp and OMG it was sooooooooooo good! The shrimp was sauteed in onions, crushed garlic, and tomatoes. It came with pizza slices shaped pita with pesto spread. OMG! I cannot emphasize how delicious and flavorful it was.   I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"OK, OK, I'm playing favorites, but I want to give props to the Pita Jungle on Shea.  Yes, that's right, props.  They have the same excellent food as the other PJs with servers who are engaging and attentive.  Tiffany was our server today.  Our order came quickly and she never stopped smiling."}
{"text":"The only place you can eat real hummus and listen to Regina Spektor.  The service sometimes leaves something to be desired, but the great food and locale keeps me coming back for more."}
{"text":"Finally took the chance to try Pita Jungle and was very impressed! I ordered the chicken curry salad which was great- and large enough for two or three meals. The service was friendly, and the food came very quickly! You can dine in or choose to-go. Very healthy menu which is SO nice to see! Will be back!"}
{"text":"I love Pita Jungle, I really do. The food is so good, I love the atmosphere and it's definitely priced right. But I have a complaint about my experience this past weekend. My three girlfriends and I went there for lunch and had a great time. Even introduced two of them to Pita Jungle and they loved the food.  BUT our waiter was rather sneaky. Two of us paid for our meal on card and the other two put in cash...and needed change. Our waiter rather boldly said \"all set! Thanks\" and then promptly disappeared. Getting a rather hefty 35% tip. I mean he was a pretty good waiter, but by no means deserved a 35% tip! Yikes! I hope he had a happy night out at the bar that night.  Oh and yes, the parking at this location is atrocious."}
{"text":"Ate here because it was my girlfriend's favorite when she was going to school in AZ. I had the spicy chicken wrap and it was very good. This place is billed as a healthy restaurant, and while the ingredients might be clean and nutritious, the portion size wasn't.  My wrap was massive!  I'd surely eat here again, but I hate leaving so much food on the plate."}
{"text":"Great Healthy Restaurant.  The food had fantastic flavoring and was cooked perfectly.  Definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I love all of the lavash wraps and salads. The service is always great! It is even great to get their food to-go."}
{"text":"Pita jungle is always great!! I get the same thing every time at every location (chicken combo platter) and it never fails to be awesome. Chicken is always cooked perfectly. One of my favorite places to grab a quick bite."}
{"text":"This is my FAVORITE place to eat. The food is amazing, but you don't feel guilty afterwards (SO many healthy options).  The hummus and teas are awesome."}
{"text":"Who could ever go wrong woth Pita Jungle.  Consistancy, price, service and food!  One of my all time favortes for Happy Hour.  Another must try is the Fruit Fantasia....you will not regret it.  PROMISE.:-)"}
{"text":"My experience at Pita Jungle was very dissapointing. I've never been here before, but I have been hearing how wonderful it is for years, so I was super  excited to go get some take away. First of all, upon entering it was so insanely loud, I was shocked.  There is absolutely no sound absorption as everything is wood and metal with no insulation. The sounds of the spatulas banging  on the flat top grill were overwhelming. Service was fine though.  I got home, the food was very sad. My chicken shwarma just tasted like grilled chicken bits on a pita with a piece of lettuce. No flavor at all, and cold. The gyro was so salty and also completely cold that my husband couldn't even finish it. The spanakopita was also drenched in salt and not flaky at all, and  I'm pretty sure the spinach was frozen.  The jalape√±o hummus was the only highlight. I can't complain about that, but sadly my only experience at Pita Jungle will be my last."}
{"text":"First of all, the food is good. Some concerns were that one of the dishes we ordered was supposed to have mashed potatoes with it. They weren't mashed at all. When we mentioned it to the server she didn't really care and then the manager came over and was like \"yep, those aren't mashed\". Didn't apologize or offer to make it right. Just an \"oh well\". We asked for more pita with our hummus because for the amount you get, two pitas, are not enough. They charged us for the extra pita. We asked for a to-go container later for the left over pita and we got more pita for free. So just ask for it to go if you need more pita. I felt like I was eating in a Chucky Cheese building. But I will repeat that the food is good. They just have some bugs to work out."}
{"text":"Just picked up a take out order and the chicken pasta salad was great as well as the cilanto humus. bBut the steak pita needs to be packages differently. It was wrapped in foil and the cheese was all stuck to the foil and the pita got all soggy. To bad it was ruined by the lame way they wrapped it"}
{"text":"I am updating this formally negative review to reflect my past experiences and fast response by Pita Jungle management to my negative post and experience.     Sincerely JD"}
{"text":"Great place to stop by after classes at MCC! Baba ghanoush and the chicken dishes are the best choices. Service is average but food is always great. The baklava is super sweet. Servers are nice and there are a lot of students and professors that frequent during the week."}
{"text":"Just picked up my catering order for 25 people at work and I couldn't be happier! Ryno the GM at the 44th Street & Indian School location, helped me personally and was so nice. He helped me get the most bang for my buck and offering to package our pitas \"open face\" saved me from an annoying afternoon of coworkers complaining because they didn't want this or that on it.  The hummus is fantastic and the veggies crisp!   Thank you Ryno and the staff there, we'll be putting you guys on our regular lunch order rotation!   ~Lisa"}
{"text":"I've been to Pita Jungle on numerous occasions and I have loved the food every single time. I have 2 fave dishes. The cilantro hummus with chicken and the chicken pasta salad. Both are amazing and the beef gyro is pretty good too! I am never disappointed with the food at this place. I always leave full and satisfied. Only reason I didn't give 5 stars is cuz service is always a hit or miss."}
{"text":"This is the last time I'm ordering from this location. Sucks because it's so close. But this is about the third time I've ordered to go and y'all forgot something. So annoying. How do you forget the salad dressing every time!!! GIT"}
{"text":"Awesome food,great service,  the waitress Michelle G was and is always friendly!! It the second time I've come this wk and got her waiting  my table super sweet chick , thanks for making our visit great!!"}
{"text":"The Fatoosh was okay, the Hummus and Tabbouleh were great.  The Shawarma was really disappointing.  Just a mildly marinated chopped up chicken breast.... The search continues for great Shawarma."}
{"text":"I had the Mahi and pita, I always have the Mahi and pita!  We also ordered garlic mushrooms.  Very tasty!  Pita Jungle is one of my favorite spots for lunch or dinner.  Prices are decent too.  The staff has been friendly at all locations I have visited."}
{"text":"Looks appealing superficially for vegan options, and indeed there are some, and some of the options can be modified. We went as a business dinner, seated on stools and a high bench, and was extremely busy.   Unfortunately the food proved to be super bland. Hummus and bread is easy to get right, but too many places find it easy to get hopelessly wrong too. All the menu options seem to be variants on this.   Perhaps the only saving grace was the passable beer menu.   Pita? Not for Peter."}
{"text":"I love me some Pita Jungle. I tend to get the gyro but I love, love the jalapeno hummus too. everything I've tried has been great. The staff is always helpful with the menu & seem happy to be there (which is a BONUS).  This location is definite healthy alternative to the usual mall fare. So go for it. You won't be sorry."}
{"text":"best Mediterranean food in the valley,  love the open kitchen layout, it makes for a great show on a Friday or Saturday night, the live jazz on Thursdays and Saturdays makes it worth the trip from central phoenix for me.  i got hooked at the location in Tempe when i was going to school, Samir was running it then( one of the greatest chefs in the southwest) they still use many of his recipes and maintain his style.  they have a few locations all over the valley. Chandler, with the pond, the patio, and the interior layout w/ live music this is with out a doubt their best location, ask your server for the details on the dishes it will make your decision a lot easier, great wine list too and again allow your server to guide you in the right direction.  healthy fresh food, great prices, great service, creative atmosphere."}
{"text":"The food here is perfection...its fresh and delicious...the hummus is a great starter and I love the chicken schwarma wrap, beef gyro, pesto chicken pizza and the mediterranean chicken salad!! I go there about once a week and I alternate between those choices...they have great smoothies too...my coworker told me to try a carib peanut butter banana smoothie and I thought it was gonna be awful but it was perfect...its enough for a small lunch...the open setting is great and the staff is nice...it gets crowded but be patient its worth it!"}
{"text":"Picked up an extremely sub par lunch for take out today. Usually can't go wrong with grilled chicken and hummus. Chicken had a lot of gristle and the hummus was runny. I have eaten here many times and will take a break for a while. Maybe expanding their footprint in the valley too much and quality of their food is diminishing?"}
{"text":"I've said this before.  All Pita Jungles aren't created equal.  I really enjoyed dining at this location.  My boyfriend and I stopped in Wednesday evening after yoga. On Wednesdays, bottles of wine are half off.  I didn't take advantage this time but plan on it next time.   The location is big and had a constant flow of people coming in and out.  Service was awesome and the food was exceptional.  We got our usual meals ... A regular gyro and a falafel bowl.  I'll definitely return, maybe next Wednesday.  I noticed a sign for live music on certain days, maybe Thursdays but I'm not totally sure."}
{"text":"I like this location, but I get tired of PJ's menu. It's great if you are vegetarian, cause they know beans, but I am always looking for some sophistication in a veg menu- like adding some carmelization, smoking, chargrilling, or stewing- processes that add complexity of flavor.  The food always tastes fresh, but not fussed over.  I dig the space here, tho- sparse and sophisticated, but earthy and casual- without trying too hard. Enjoyable stuff when you're in the mood."}
{"text":"Pita Jungle is a staple favorite of mine and my boyfriend's. Healthy, hearty and great service. It's too bad that a lot of their prices have gone up (as have other restaurants) but I'll still patronize this place. Read as: some things went up in price almost two dollars, but you can still have a meal and a drink for around $10, more or less, depending on what you order. I definitely like this place over the new one across MCC on Southern - there's something about being by the lake that makes it special. Even if there are stinky ducks there from time to time. ;)  Ooh - and the gambas con ajos is my favorite appetizer! :)"}
{"text":"OMG they have the best Dolmades I have ever had. I've searched high and low for them, including multiple Greek restaurants and the Greekfest. Still no one can beat PJ's dolmades. I am also in love with the roasted bell pepper hummus.   I went there for take-out yesterday. The dolmades were almost finished by the time I got home. I skipped the pitas that came with the hummus and instead brought out my own veggies, all of which went great with the dip. I want the recipe!!   The restaurant itself is such a pleasant place to be, too. The inside is huge with high ceilings and lots of windows, and the patio is always hoppin'. This was the second time I went and I have yet to eat a mediocre item there."}
{"text":"I'm pretty disappointed to write this review as I LOVE every other Pita Jungle I've been to. However, as other reviews have stated, this location is really struggling. I've been a few times now and service has always been very slow. It was better tonight, but the food was the big problem. We ordered hummus and pita, and though it came out quickly, when passing the pita around we noticed one of them was soggy and covered in some type of pink/red stain. Turns out they put a paper towel in the bottom of the pita bin and we just literally got the bottom of the barrel that had been sitting on the towel. Not sure how sanitary it is to serve that. I ordered the lavosh shawarma wrap which I've had many times at other locations. This time, it came out with no sauce on it and I had to ask for the sauce. By the time it came out, the lavosh had dried out and the whole thing fell apart. Also, the side salad had no dressing on it, and I had to get a side of dressing for that too. My husband's also didn't have dressing on it. Overall, it was (another) really disappointing trip to this location. We have such high hopes because it's in our neighborhood, but both my husband and myself said we'd rather make the trip to other locations rather than come back here. I know they haven't been open that long, so hopefully they work things out."}
{"text":"Love this place. Happy hour is great prices and every time we go we have the best margaritas!!!"}
{"text":"In the past 6 months since I've been eating healthy and losing weight (119 pounds)  Pita Jungle has become my go to place for outstanding healthy food. I usually go to the restaurants in Scottsdale and the food and service have been delightfully consistent at both restaurants. If you like good healthy food, this is the place for you!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat healthy Mediterranean food!!! I got the spicy chicken wrap (open face) and it was UNBELIEVABLE!!!! Friendly staff and great atmosphere! Highly recommend it...."}
{"text":"My only con was that service was a little slow. Food and everything else was great! I went on a week day night for dinner and it was pretty full."}
{"text":"This place never disappoints me each time I plan a sudden lunch or dinner with friends. We stepped in on a Wednesday evening and given the special menu available and my first try on the buccaneer wrap .  Must try -BUCCANEER WRAP on their menu .Foods is served very hot and the wrap is of decent size .Apart from it , the best part at this location is the staff. They are fantastic and prompt also their suggestion would never go wrong with me.  All our order of 2 wraps and a dessert is ready upon no time and I would recommend this place for my fellow yelpers."}
{"text":"Haven't eaten here in years and was pleasantly surprised by the amazing consistent quality of all the food my girlfriend and I had. Also, Megan was super rad! Very attentive server. Definitely coming back and asking for her. Desiree greeted and served our drinks flawlessly :) Thank you!"}
{"text":"This is a must stop. The food, and I mean every dish, is DElish! Not your average food fare offerings but wonderful, palate delights. Healthy, tantalizing and satisfying appetizers, entr√©es and desserts. The Yellow Fin Tuna salad, the Chicken Tiki Masala, Mahi w/ Red Quinoa & Veggies, the Shrimp on Brn Rice with Mango Saracha Sauce. Very nice flavores that keep you dreaming about what new discoveries you will make on your next visit. I'm very picky about what I spend my $ on and what goes into my body. This is the best buy on both accounts! Enjoy!  *Josh is a GREAT server/Manager and Ryan also. Good service!"}
{"text":"The food is always very good but they get a three stars at this location. I used them for a very large catering order to feed about 30 people. I choose to pick up the order as opposed to have it delivered. When I arrived to pick up the order there were a few things that went wrong. 1. due to the location it is difficult to pick up large orders unless you can pull up front to load the vehicle. Well there are pick up parking spots but patrons who are staying for lunch seem to feel that they can park there for as long as they want so these were all taken which meant i had to park in the far back part of a parking garage. No biggie except the restaurant does not have a cart to load the food on to take to the parking garage well.... they do but they only have one and that was in use for the guy doing deliveries. I had to make five trips back and forth to the garage with food. On the last trip I finally got one employee to help me out with a tray or it would have been six trips!.  Another issue is that the trays that the food is put on are flimsy even if you are very careful. I had thin plastic sandwich trays with a depth of an inch and a half over filled with humus. These would be trays you would serve sandwiches on. The covers kept popping off as they were transported and humus leaked out everywhere. Containers were not well sealed so I also had other food items all over the car. When I got the items out on the other end to take into the office it was very difficult as the containers were very leaky and messy.  I have done a lot of catering orders over the last eight years and this has been the worst as far as packaging, maintaining quality of food and keeping food in containers that keep food at temperature.  I was able to fix the presentation of the items but it was awkward.  I am happy to say that the other pita jungle locations do a better job of catering, I have to specify what containers I want used but other locations seem to be accommodating.  I will not be using this location in the future for catering orders. The container issue could be fixed but the assistance with the order which was large could have been handled better."}
{"text":"I'm doing an updated review for Pita Jungle.  After my last review, they sent me a $20 gift card to make up for my last visit.  So we tried it out again.  This time we got the hummus trio and an extra pita since we knew 1 pita was not enough for all the hummus they give you.  You might even need two extra pitas.  But we made do with 2 pitas, so my husband got 1 and I got 1.  Mine was not great... it actually had a soggy spot and a tough, dried out, hard spot.  But overall was a good appetizer.  It was hard to pick an appetizer as there are so many that sound good!  My husband got the fish sandwich (grilled mahi mahi).  I got the Caribbean salad and I love it so much!  It comes with a small amount of lettuce on the bottom (they could stand to add a little more lettuce, actually), and a ton of fresh fruit on top!  With a strawberry dressing and grated coconut on top of that!  The fruit included strawberries, watermelon, cantaloupe, honeydew, pineapple, apple, banana, red grapes and golden raisins.  (Could possibly change with the seasons, though.)  It was a huge plate of salad and I definitely couldn't finish it all, so I took at least half of it home.  So... this is a great place to take your raw vegan/fruitarian friends!  Wonderful salad.  I'm hoping to come back often.  Oh and one other tip: I saw the patrons at another table order hummus and also some cucumber and tomato on the side.  So one person was dipping the pita bread into the hummus and another person was dipping the cucumber and tomato into the hummus.  I thought this was a great idea if you wanted to do a gluten free option with the hummus."}
{"text":"A trendy spot that parents, grandparents and kids can come to, as well! The food: muy bien. But I gotta say, I always order my tried and true favorite: the lavosh shawarma wrap! Texture is great (soft and tender chicken with a crunchy lavosh wrap); but the best part is the garlic spread! Yum! And also order the cauliflower appetizer!!"}
{"text":"For mall food, this place if pretty good. Not the best Pita or Hummus I've ever had (that would have to be in Athens!), but enough to satisfy a Greek food craving and probably one of the healthier options in the food court.   I tried the Broiled chicken pita and roasted red pepper hummus. The pita was pretty good, I felt it needed a little more flavor so I added some of the red hot sauce they have by the register. The hummus was a bit disappointing, It lacked flavor so again I added the red sauce. I feel I could get better Hummus from Trader Joes, but the upside is they give you a whole plate of it! I was also sad that the pita they served with the hummus seemed like it was just taken out of  a bag. I mean....at least throw it on the grill to warm it up !!"}
{"text":"This is hands down one of the my favorite places to eat. The food is always fresh and made to order. The staff is super friendly. When my take out order was wrong, the manager took care of my next visit, no questions asked. The Greek salad is amazing and that dressing!! It's the best! The location is right on the water and I love it here!!"}
{"text":"Good, consistent food. Always friendly staff, ambience is a little plain, but all in all good place to grab a casual meal"}
{"text":"We go here about once a month and always have a good meal. I love the chicken philly and the Mediterranean salad. Their ice tea is always good too. We get it to go a lot too and the food is always hot and packaged well."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. Great awesome and healthy tasting food. Definitely one of my favorite places to go. So creative and in their food and it is all delicious. You won't feel like you overpaying here."}
{"text":"This place was amazing. The menu options all looked so good that it was hard to choose. Everything we are was delicious. I really liked the way that the children's menu was set up where you choose something from each food group. It was a little on the pricey side for lunch, but as an occasional treat it was well worth it. We will definitely be going back if we are in the area."}
{"text":"Outstanding! The Jalepeno and Cilantro is the Bomb! And their pitas are really good .... if you want to change it up ... do it jungle style, then do it at Pita Jungle."}
{"text":"Our first visit. We have been to the Tempe location, this location has an entirely different \"look,\" much more upscale (which wouldn't be hard if you're comparing it to the Tempe strip mall original).   We read the previous reviews including the bad ones and saw that management was responding to them so we thought we'd give it \"one try.\"  Glad we did.   Bowl of pita chips to start, I liked them my wife didn't...she said they had a hint of fish to them that I could not detect. Grilled Salmon entree on wilted spinach was excellent, lentils and rice were very good, cauliflower was very good, as were the garlic mashed potatoes.   One thing I really appreciate is that the food was not \"over salted\" which is something we're encountering too often when we eat out. I can add salt if I need it.  Our waiter was Luis, he took our order and gave helpful answers to our questions but our food was actually delivered by an unnamed \"expeditor\" who brought stuff as soon as the kitchen put it out. Worked well for our visit.   We had carrot cake and chocolate baklava for dessert, some of which joined the \"boxes to go\" from our lunch. BTW the portions were large on everything we ordered with the exception of the carrot cake which was small but very tasty, so we had boxed part of almost everything we were served.  We had iced tea and water, no alcohol, our tab for two was $49+tip.   We thought the meal was good value and while a bit high for lunch we thought it was worth it and will return.  Our visit was Sunday at 11:30 am and the restaurant was not busy until we were ready to leave."}
{"text":"Love Love love the Greek salad and the dressing that is on it :) it's also a nice touch when they give you a drink to go!"}
{"text":"OK, so, before I say anything else: I love Pita Jungle. Best hummus ever. The glazed chicken lavosh pizza is one of my favorite dishes in town. The Fruit & Cheese FANTASIA deserves its capital letters. Basically, when it comes to the food, Pita Jungle is takin' care o' business.  So, with that in mind: What the hell were they thinking with the name?  I'm still running into people who have lived in the Valley for 6-7 years and never eaten there, though they declare themselves fans of mediterranean or vegetarian cuisine. Their stated reason: \"Sounded like a fast food place\" or \"I was afraid of some Eurasian Rainforest Cafe  knock-off.\" (OK, that last one is mine from when I first moved here.) It's name might actually be worse than Pita Pit's - and Pita Pit basically IS a fast food place.  I also have a minor problem with the entire staff looking like half-starved refugees from Planet Hip, but that might be just be envy at the fact that I will never be that cool. It's like an indie record store that serves food.  Go eat the food. Make fun of the name."}
{"text":"I think I am yelping all the places that I love and/or frequent first. Pita jungle never appealed to me until this location. Now, my household comes here all the time. They have a great happy hour and their food has always been fresh. Also, for all you spicy food lovers out there, Pita Jungle has every popular hot sauce possible. It is great! The staff is wonderful as well (at least the ones I've associated with have been) and they are defiantly healthy. I am glad this Pita Jungle exists.  Food = 4.5 stars  Service = 4 stars  note: this restaurant could improve if they had ranch, TVS, and WIFI."}
{"text":"I have been a patron of Pita Jungle for 12 years. This was my go-to place in college, during my vegetarian and vegan years...And even now, as a carnivore, making the trip is ALWAYS a highly anticipated event. Not only is the ambiance great (amazing local artist's work on the walls), open yet cozy dining room, cool/hip looking wait staff, but the food is amazing. Even if you hate vegetarian or middle eastern food, this place will win you over.  The hummus is a must have. A friend and I can easily polish through an order, without filling guilty or gross. I've head everything from the salads to the pizza to the pasta, but I must say I always go for the falafel pita. The seasoning is amazing, the veggies are fresh, the pita is made in house...You can eat a great, healthy meal, and not feel hungry 45 minutes later.   It's also a great first date place, because it's not too fancy, not too casual, and if the date goes bad, there are plenty of things to distract you! If you run out of conversation, just discuss the art on the walls. And, you don't feel awkward about ordering what ever you want, without wondering if you are spending too much!"}
{"text":"I lived in the Phoenix area for two and a half years and any time I go back, I always demand to go to Pita Jungle. Saying demand sounds like a bad thing but I don't joke around when it comes to the Pita Jungle.  It's a funky, artsy place with healthy food that tastes good and a huge selection of food and drink. Most of the time I take service into thought when rating a  place and while the service could be better, I still give this place 5 stars b/c I've never had a bad meal there. From their black bean burgers to their amazing hummus, they got it all!"}
{"text":"Not impressed. Location on 75th and Bell much better than this location. We went when it was busy but they messed up our daughters order 2x. Kitchen crew not on their A game"}
{"text":"Tried the lavosh pizza & I loved it. Light & fresh so yummy. Not so hot re-heating (sog city sweetheart) unless you want to do it in the oven & that's not happening in the summer so be a piggy & eat it all or share. So yum! Can't beat the happy hour specials either."}
{"text":"Food...EXCELLENT  Prices...GREAT  Atmosphere...LOUD and FUN  Service...TERRIBLE, NOT FRIENDLY.  Staff dress code...TERRIBLE  This place makes me think this place is ran by foreigners who think they're a part of some secret mafia group, but really thy're just unorganized flakes."}
{"text":"Just a little heads up.  On the menu, the Chicken Pita is listed as made with Broiled Chicken.  On the menu, the Chicken Shawarma is listed on the menu as made with Grilled Chicken.  I ordered the Chicken Shawarma because I wanted grilled chicken.  What I received when I ordered my Chicken Shawarma was boiled chicken ... not even broiled.  It was a major deal as far as taste concern but just for those who want GRILLED chicken.  It appears it's not on the menu or at least this Pita Jungle location doesn't make it.  Just sharing!"}
{"text":"This new location is just great. I have to compliment Brody who was my server. She assisted me in deciding on a Cold Tuna Plate that was delicious. I will be eating there quite often.  Ron Hourihan 480-285-1652 www.SMME.com"}
{"text":"Service is friendly and the food is always impeccable, but there's something about it being sort of like a fast food place in the middle of the Fashion Square that takes away what makes the other Pita Jungles in the Valley special."}
{"text":"Not a fan of this particular location - I think I'm gonna stick with the Chandler one.  I love Pita Jungle, I really do, and I would usually leave a raving review, but after my visit last night to the Tempe location, I feel obligated as a long-time customer to give other potential visitors to the TEMPE establishment (not the other ones) a  friendly note that the service I received from the hostess last night was absolutely terrible. When I went in and asked for a table for two, I didn't get a simple \"hello.\" She picked up two menus, put them on the table closest to her and walked away. The table was right by the entrance where it was chilly and the draft kept coming in, so I asked if I could sit elsewhere... to which her reply was picking up the menus and silverware and then HANDED IT TO ME as she pointed to a table in the back. I'm not a lazy person by any means, but I don't feel like I should be my own host when I'm trying to support an establishment. I don't know her name, but she was working around 7:45 p.m. on Thursday, March 4. Perhaps some manners and training in hosting etiquette would be beneficial to her and this location. I think I'll stick with the Chandler location until then."}
{"text":"I'm in love with Pita Jungle!  This was the very first Pita Jungle location my husband and I tried out about six months ago and while it was VERY busy the day we went there, the service was outstanding and very attentive.  First off, my husband had the Portobello Mushroom Burger and he absolutely devoured it.  Messy, but delicious (his words).  :-)  Garlic fries on the side were over the top.  Yum!  I, on the other hand, had the Chipotle Black Bean Burger.  Yum as well, however I was kind of disappointed that the burger (because it was so moist) kept falling apart on me and I ended up eating most of it with a fork.  Otherwise a very good burger.  And of course those delicious garlic fries (I could make a meal of those alone.)  If you're looking for a quiet restaurant, this is not a good choice.  The food and service is outstanding and the place is huge.  People know a good restaurant when they see one and this is a good one.  :-)"}
{"text":"It was my first time coming back here in a really long time. Last time I had a horrible experience at the Dana park location with the Caramelized cauliflower, it was swimming in grease and the lady told me I should order with easy oil next time! Check my other review for the Dana park location. I'm truly disappointed in pita jungle, the use to be my favorite place to go. This last time I came in the service was painfully slow and the cooks in the back were having a gay ol time cracking jokes and laughing/ horse playing. I saw my chicken shawarma sit there for 15 mins before it came out so the pita was soggy and lettuce was wilted af. Do not come here!!!"}
{"text":"Huge fan of Pita Jungle. Have been going to their various locations for years, which is why tonight was such a disappointment. If you plan on having the Garlic Saut√©ed Broccoli, please be warned: it's literally a daily hit or miss. Let me explain. My girlfriend is a vegetarian and very picky. So we tend to order take out for dinner from this location several times a week. Both she and I have the saut√©ed broccoli with almost every meal because it USED TO BE BOMB. Then, something went south. One day we got broccoli that tasted and felt as if it came out of one of those nasty microwave pouches I used to eat when I was in school and poor. We made it a point after that to ask for extra char on it and for a while things were great again. Then recently we had another horrible broccoli experience so my gf called and spoke with the manager. I believe Kevin was his name. He was wonderful and apologized and asked that we give them another shot and sent us a gift card in the mail. Sooo cool of him. Today, my gf went in to grab our food with said gift card. The nice guy at the counter opened the container and asked if the char on it was okay. It was. Looks can be deceiving. The broccoli was drenched, repeat: DRENCHED in oil. When I bit into it, it literally felt like there was a teaspoon of oil sliding down my throat. I couldn't eat it. Pita, what happened!!!??? Your food is amazing, but someone's broccoli game is no longer on point."}
{"text":"Excellent service. Horrible food. The falafel, lavash pizza, Greek salad were just not good, the humus was just ok - this is a chain and a bad representation of Mediterranean food (not authentic in any way, except menu)! would not recommend or come here again. The plus is the service, our server was excellent."}
{"text":"I am SO disappointed. Wow. I picked up my to go order. Got it home & found a mess. The juices from all the dishes had spilled out into the bag all over the other items. Ugh. My son ordered the Chicken Del Sol & it had undercooked beans....I ordered the garlic potatoes....how do you burn &:undercooked an item? My suggestion is to come up with a better packaging system for take out. SOMEONE needs to pay attention to the cooking of the food itself. & have more consistency. Really a let down."}
{"text":"I love Pita Jungle but just this location alone woukd be 1 star. Everytime I go I get forgot about, so never greeting and getting me a drink for 10 minutes or so. And my stomach just seems to hurt when I leave. Only location w this issue"}
{"text":"My first time into a Pita Jungle in a few years, and now I'm a fan. Shwarma wrap was excellent but the garlic dip won over our whole table."}
{"text":"This place keeps going further down hill. Went here for lunch with a big group last week... Got the gyro bowl, double avocado. I received the avocado but half of the pieces still had skin or partial skin on them, and most of them were rock hard. Face down of course, perhaps in an effort to trick me.  1 star for 1% effort. Wish I could give zero stars."}
{"text":"Love pita jungle! I love the cilantro jalape√±o hummus, their pizzas are always a good choice. And the service is always great!"}
{"text":"This was our first visit here. Not bad. The Greek salad was good, but some of the lettuce was brown, but the lemon vinegrette was really good. Wish I had a piece of pita bread with it. The Delmas were ok, not much flavor, too much oil on them. The Pita sandwich was not my idea of a Mediterranean pita. The meat and lamb were boiled and had no taste. It was loaded with pickles, which do not belong in a pita, there was tomato and greens, no feta. The tizitse had no flavor and again had pickles and chunks of cucumber. Not sure what the point of the pickles is. The food definitely needs some flavor. We will probably go back to try something else since they are the only real Mediterranean game in phoenix."}
{"text":"What I love about Pita Jungle is it's consistency.  I have dined at three different locations with the same results.  The food is very good... I've had many things on the menu, but the new one for me is the Chicken Tikka Marsala.  I order without the rice and sub in Mushrooms and Veggies.  Amazing dish.   Service is always tops!"}
{"text":"Sat on the patio with my toddlers, brother, and mom. Our server was Ressia and she was amazing! We are a very high maintenance group with our constant requests and whatnot. We know we aren't the easiest table but Ressia went above and beyond serving us. She was always there to check on us or see if we needed anything. Also the fact that she interacted so well with the kids was a bonus. She was such a doll.   The food was delicious as always. I decided to try something new and had the Chipotle Chicken Lavosh pizza. I was not disappointed!! Even my family kept asking to eat some of my newest discovery.   This location is one of the better ones in my opinion. It's always such a clean and welcoming environment. Can't wait till next time!"}
{"text":"I love stopping into Pita Jungle for their happy hour after work.  Its a great little bar with a fun atmosphere that fills up fast.  My only 2 complaints are how their food specials on happy hour are only til 5:30 (cuz so I'm frugal!) and how all the employees wear regular clothes, so I can never tell them apart from the customers.  When I can get off early enough to make it in time, the portions for happy hour are perfect for a little eater like myself at $2-3 a pop.  Their hummus is by far my fav and I crave it for weeks after I go there!"}
{"text":"Family has started coming here often for breakfast, and healthy juicing. Highly recommended, amazing place!!"}
{"text":"Went here on 12/30 right when they opened and the hostess killed our vibe right away. Very unfriendly, no smile, no hello, just \"how many?\" Plopped our menus on the table without a word. She was young with long brown hair and the dirtiest white converse I've seen in my life. Please get new shoes girl, that should seriously be a health hazard!!!  Our server was Britanni and she was pretty nice. The food was just okay, nothing great for the price. My steak pita was $8.79 and my friends Veggie Scramble was about $15.   The place is nicely decorated with indoor and outdoor seating."}
{"text":"Pita Jungle is one of my favorite places to go for reverse happy hour after 9pm.  They have $1 - $3 little tapa plates and we usually split 5 or 6 of them!  Hummus, olives, mozz & tomato, garlic potatoes - yum!  That way, you get so much variety.    I love how vegetarian friendly their menu is and I enjoy that I can try something new almost every time!  My favorite is the Thousand Bean pita - its so huge that even when splitting it with my man we are unable to finish it!  I wish their staff was more friendly.  On more than one occasion I've had staff be outright rude.  All other times, it never goes above mediocre.    Also, whats with the weird pita to hummus ratio?! From the name, you would expect an entire jungle of pita bread. There is always way more hummus and never enough pita...I am okay with eating my hummus with a spoon. I just don't want people to look at me funny."}
{"text":"This place is always AMAZING!!! And I make it a point to visit when I am back in town.  Their hummus is sooo good- wether you get the original, red pepper or new Avocado- it is AMAZING!  Hummus comes with cucumbers and tomato as well, not just Pita bread. Their salads are good to, so much food an easy thing to split. You will have left overs if you order it to yourself. Lastly I always order the Hibiscus Berry Tea(in a To-Go cup) you get a little more and it's very refreshing!   Overall I love this place and will dine here many years to come!"}
{"text":"Tasty Food-5 stars Take out meal being accurate - 1 star  I have ordered to go many times here and end up with missing items.. happened more than once. Ensure your order is accurate before leaving."}
{"text":"Anyone who knows me knows I am addicted to their Gazpacho. It's so yummy and the pine nuts what a great addition. The cilantro jalapeno hummus is divine and so is the Gambas con Ajo appetizer. The portions are huge so you can definitely share with a friend. I love this place also bc I can walk in there after a yoga class and not feel like I am under dresses."}
{"text":"So amazing! Went for happy hour and tapas and the lemon chicken with pine nuts is my favorite. The kafta and salmon slider were pretty good too."}
{"text":"I cannot believe I haven't given a review of Pita Jungle yet! This is our lunch spot! And apparantly the rest of Phoenix considers it their lunch spot too....  Good luck finding a parking spot ... Have fun waiting for a seat ... ... because it is going to be busy!  We've started parking at the Walgreen's close by because it's ALWAYS packed. Annoying as it might be ... it just shows how AMAZING this place really is.  The hummus is sooo addictive. Seriously. I can't go a week without it! Their beef gyro puts Greek restaurants to shame. The cucumbers and tomatoes that come with the hummus are just scrumptious.  No matter what you're in the mood for - Pita Jungle will satisfy!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here 50 times and it's almost perfect every time. Service is quick and friendly. Environment is clean. Everything on the menu is good. Berry caffeine free tea is great."}
{"text":"My family (my wife, two young daughters and I) stopped in to Pita Jungle prior to catching Star Wars at Shea 14 (we had tickets for 5:30).   We arrived at Pita Jungle just after 4:30, were seated and ordered immediately (chicken combo platter, black bean burger and two kids meals). After we arrived, there was a flurry of activity as seemingly ALL the staff was catering to one table specifically, then another pushy customer came in with plenty of demands. Otherwise, it was not particularly busy.  We waited...and waited...and waited as table, after table, after table (who placed their orders after us) received their food. By 5:10, we still had no food, but were told 'it will be up any minute now'. We explained that we needed to leave, and the waitress said she'd see if the manager could do anything to help.   No manager ever came over to express any concern, or offer any explanation as to what had happened. Ultimately, we just told our waitress to cancel the order and walked out.   We typically love Pita Jungle, and visit the Indian School/Arcadia location often. However, we were really disappointed with the (lack of) service at this location...and ultimately disappointed that we were basically ignored."}
{"text":"Pita Jungle has to be one of my favorite restaurants in all of Arizona. It's probably the non-chain restaurant that I have been to the most. Whenever I have out of state friends come in, we always go to Pita Jungle and no one leaves disappointed. I normally always get the grilled chicken with hummus as my entr√©e (it's on the appetizer menu) and I substitute the white hummus for their garlic dip. Their lemonade is also amazing. I have been to many locations all across the Valley (Ahwatukee, original Tempe, Ray & Dobson, downtown, Fashion Square, MCC, Dana Park, Williams Field) and they are all consistent in my opinion. Overall the menu at Pita Jungle is on the healthy side, but that doesn't mean it's not delicious. I would definitely recommend giving Pita Jungle a shot if you've never been here."}
{"text":"The outside of this restaurant looks like any other low end strip mall restaurant but when you walk in the atmosphere is very modern, clean and refreshing. The place gets really busy during lunch rush so don't expect a lot of attention from your server. Whenever I go to a new place like this I always like to get a sampler of some sort so I ordered the Meditterranean Platter. It came with Hummus, baba ganoosh, tsatziki, taboule, feta cheese, dolmades, falafel and green beans with two pitas fairly priced at $9.99. The portion was so huge I could have easily split it with another person. The Hummus was lightly seasoned and velvety smooth. The baba ganoosh was a little dry but easily moistened by the Tsatziki. My favorite of the platter was the Dolmades the Grape leaves were tasty and the filling complimented it very well at just the right cold temperature. This place has plenty of Vegetarians and even some Vegan options. If you're looking for a delicious and healthy alternative to fast food in the Tempe are, I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I could eat here everyday!! Love the food, and the staff is always nice and accurate with my (our) orders even when they are swamped."}
{"text":"When I think of a quick, healthy dinner option that is delicious or a place I want to meet my girlfriend for a light dinner, I think of Pita Jungle.  I have been coming to this pita jungle location now for years.  It's clean and the patio is great!  The patio faces a lake and it's lit with cute lights.  The food is fresh and hot and you know exactly what you're getting when you come here.  I always get the hummus and taboule with a side of chicken and cucumbers.  You will never go wrong with that dish!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here on and off, but I have always got a great meal out of it. The food is very price worthy and, as I most probably wouldn't make this a place where I would hang out and drink, they have that option too.   I had the schwarma last time, which basically is a pita wrap of the kind that can be found all over Europe. Tasty to say the least.. but I have to get better at trying out their curry dishes, because they look and smell fantastically.   Some people say they have gotten bad service here, but I never have had a bad experience. It's very casual and I must say I appreciate that. As I said, its more a place to eat than a place to hang out at."}
{"text":"Love the outdoor patio area! I'm glad I had my first Mediterranean experience here. Hummus and healthy wraps for the win! :D And as my best friend put it, this is like the food that Jesus ate :p"}
{"text":"This was a good place.  Service was on point and the food was great.  I haf baba ganoosh w/chicken & cucumber slices instead on pita."}
{"text":"Crappy service. Healthy salmon was covered in oil and cold. Place sucks."}
{"text":"One of my all time favorite Tempe lunch spots. Great place to take friends who can't decide what they want. I've never been disappointed with pita wraps and hummus - order extra cucumber and pickles for dipping."}
{"text":"I've avoided reviewing Pita Jungle because I just don't think my meager words can do it justice. So this is what I've come up with:  If I could live here for the rest of my life and roll around in their hummus all day long, I would die happy.  My favorite restaurant in all of Phoenix. Hands down."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good. Nice atmosphere, very casual. Prices are low to moderate. Hipsters tend to hang here.  They do make mean whole grain pancakes in the morning. I would stay away from the pita burrito as it falls apart almost instantly. Defiantly vegan friendly! The pitas are very tasty too with a great texture."}
{"text":"Great Mediterranean food. \"Quick on they're feet\" wait staff. Reasonably priced and a great light meal after our hike to the summit of camelback mountain. It had an open kitchen and wood fired menu items like pizzas and pitas. Amazing falafel, great hummus and other Mediterranean sauces. Very authentic, sampler platter."}
{"text":"Loooove this place! I like the different types of selections and it's fairly cheap in price and decently healthy. One of my top favorite places for sure!"}
{"text":"This is such a great place with a great food selection. I have recommended this restaurant to so many people and I don't think anyone has ever been disappointed with the food.   It has been a while since I have been to this location. It is so close but yet so far! The food was great but I had to drop the rating by one star because the service was just not up to par.   Our dining choices were the red pepper hummus (a must), grilled chicken pita, beef gyro pita with garlic potatoes, and an old fave spicy chicken wrap."}
{"text":"LOVE Pita Jungle and it's reputation for such wonderful and always fresh cuisine! This particular venue is NOT represented well by barmaid, Selina! Snippy this afternoon and two days ago! Even when slammed, all other wait staff I have encountered over the years at any Pita Jungle have always been warm, friendly and enjoyable! Two days ago Selina tallied up my bill without giving me the happy hour wine discount! Her response to me was that she rang up the tab after happy hour and I should talk to a manager! I took her rudeness that day as an aberration.... Especially considering I had just picked up the tab of a friend who had a drink and neglected to pay (he had paid for his take out order prior and was negligent not malicious)! Since I was visiting with him, I did not wish to have Selina nor the venue stiffed!  However, her behavior today resumed with snippy comments again! Just decided to have my glass of wine and forgo dinner here! Unfortunately (for me), I will NOT return to this location of Pita Jungle due to the unexpectedly rude behavior of barmaid Selina! These types of behaviors are usually not known to management unless someone brings it to the fore! Some sort of customer service training is in order for barmaid Selina! As an aside, when I asked for my bill this afternoon (and requested anyone but Selina) I was greeted by manager Fabian! What a pleasant, understated and humble of spirit manager! After inquiry by Fabian, I explained my distaste for the first time EVER, with wait staff at a Pita Jungle venue! This manager comped my glass of wine (not my request nor desire) and so graciously engaged with me to determine the issue at hand! At this moment, I am feeling confident that my critique will be taken as it was given..... In the very best interest of Pita Jungle!!!"}
{"text":"Pita Jungle never ever disappoints! The white wine sangria is delightful! Their garlic dip is amazing and not to be missed! We tried the wood fired chicken over wilted spinach and mashed potatoes... Oh yum! Miranda was friendly and efficient! LOVE local artist, Aaron Voigt's, \"tree\"!!"}
{"text":"Pita Jungle never disappoints!  Fresh, delectable cuisine!  Bonus this afternoon was our delightful server, Nate!"}
{"text":"LOVE Pita Jungle.....since their humble beginnings on Apache Boulevard in Tempe! My all time favorite dish is the wood fired chicken on a bed of spinach! My husband always selects the hot Pita with Mediterranean roasted schwarma! They also have the very best garlic dip and I ask for Greek Pita to go with it! Ambiance is very hip and the clientele reaches all demographics! One of our favorites and they have locations all over the valley now (when in Cali we make a point of going to the Newport Beach location)!"}
{"text":"Salmon dinner substitute potatoes with carmelized cauliflower and a side of garlic spinach=delish! Food and service much better the second time around. Some places just deserve another chance to get it right :)"}
{"text":"Delicious food and dessert. Friendly service and quick. Great for lunch. Conveniently located near the light rail in the art district. Good value"}
{"text":"I love the Mediterranean salad but sometimes the chicken on it is really fresh and cooked really good and sometimes (usually lunchtime) it's not as fresh and delicious. I wish it was more consistently fabulous. The service is always very friendly."}
{"text":"Just had an awful experience with coworkers at this Pita Jungle location. Got here at 11:15 to beat the lunch rush, ordered within 10 minutes and didn't see our food until after 12pm. When we inquired about the status, our server said \"we're busy right now\" and left us to wait another 10-15 minutes while other customer that arrived later than our trio were paying their bills! Then we receive the food and everyone's dish was significantly subpar compared to other recent experiences eating at this location. There was one time we were asked if everything was ok- before we'd even had a chance to eat (why do they do that?) There went $17 on a crap salad with over-cooked, skin-filled salmon and an iced tea that wasn't refilled once. Thanks, guys. I'll stay up in central Phoenix for future work lunches."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots here in Scottsdale!  I love their Baba Ganoush, Roasted Red Pepper Humas, Stuffed Grape Leaves, Falafel and of course the Baklava.  This place is is super inexpensive and they give you a lot of food...The only thing is eat fast because the food comes out of the kitchen at lightening speed! So if you order an appetizer wait to order!"}
{"text":"I went to Pita Jungle last night and I had an amazing experience !  I had an Awesome meal I had an Awesome server  I will recommend it !"}
{"text":"Same high Pita Jungle standards great new spacious location! I'm sure this Pita Jungle will be here for a very long time. As always the service is fast and friendly. The Hummus was smooth and bold; my salad was fresh very developed in flavor. No complaints here... well maybe their prices, but keep in mind I am a little cheap but the food is worth it which is why I keep coming back."}
{"text":"This is a pretty cool location for a PJ.  There is actually a lake out back so you can sit on the patio and watch the ducks.  Very cool for a restaurant in AZ.  The food here has consistently been very good and the wait staff is very nice and cheerful.  They are more of a 4.5 star place to eat.  They get docked a bit because it seems a bit slow sometimes and the restaurant is always very noisy.  If you don't really want to chat it's ok, or just sit outside and watch the ducks.  Try:   - Nachos   - Chicken Tiki Masala   - Hummus   - Steak and Cheese Pita"}
{"text":"Yumtastic!  Good food and dietary-restriction friendly. If you have any loved ones who can't have gluten, dairy, wheat, malt, or coffee than this place has a dish or two for them.  I'm not sure what it is, but this place is better than its Arcadia location."}
{"text":"I come here all the time! The food is fresh and tasty and the service I receive from Sarah is great! She is super friendly, and gets my order in right away. I hardly have to wait for my food to come once I order it. I love the philly chicken pita and the cilantro hummus. So yummy! I recommend this location!!"}
{"text":"The staff allowed a woman whom I nicely asked to contain her children, berate me and come back twice to tell me how \"mean and evil\" of a person that I am for asking her to quiet her screaming children during lunch.  I asked the staff to remove her, and they simply stood and watched/listened.  I've never been treated so horribly in a restaurant.  My friend and I will not be returning, and I will share this experience with everyone that I know.  I asked for the manager, and he did not choose to help the situation by showing up.  As a former restaurant owner, I am horrified and disgusted."}
{"text":"If you want Americanized Mediterranean food, because authenticity doesn't matter to you, this is your place. The food isn't terrible, it was okay tasting and did seem on the healthier side. But take the Pita out of it, it's just not Mediterranean/Middle Eastern food. Perhaps you can say it is to mediterranean food what Taco Bell is to Mexican food. Again, no issues with the place. The food was ok, and the service was fine. I guess what threw me off was the \"pita\" in their name."}
{"text":"Me and hubbies go to lunch spot . Never get tired of hummus and chicken !!! Very affordable . If your out and about don't doubt , check it out !!!"}
{"text":"I've been to this Pita Jungle MANY times. In fact, every weekend I go here for one thing, and one thing only... the berry iced tea mixed with lemonade. If I could rate Pita Jungle solely on that I would give them a 5+++ stars, however I cannot, but you should definitely try one-it will rock your world.   Here's the thing... what I usually get to eat here, I do like, but I can never get anything different because the menu just doesn't appeal to me. The items are just not quite what I am ever looking for, ever. I will say that their roasted red pepper hummus and grilled chicken are great. I also have enjoyed the spinach quesadilla and taziki, but other than that I find the food and service to be mediocre. That being said, I do frequent here often for a healthy meal and to support a local business over the many chain restaurants in this area.   And...That's all I have to say about that."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants in Scottsdale, I come here about once a week because it is Delicious and healthy. I bring friends and they all love it when i bring them. Every time I come (which has been once a week for the past two months) I try something new. So far I have no complaints, the food has been terrific. Everyone should start off their appetizer by getting the chicken with hummus (Its the best). So far the best entree I have had is the Lavosh Shwarma Wrap, its just flat out great. Then if your still a little hungry i would recommend a cold watermelon smoothie, BEST smoothie I have ever had. Now the only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because the service is a little slow. It is always crowded every night, and the waiters and waitresses seem to move slow. Its definitely possible for them to be quicker if they tried harder I think. But besides that the restaurant is a grand slam."}
{"text":"Came here for the second time today. Excellent food, lots of variety on the menu, nice decor.  Service our first time was excellent. Today it wasn't as good. Still, I recommend it."}
{"text":"Always friendly and fast service with great recommendations from the kitchen. We're here 3-4 times a month!"}
{"text":"Love Pita Jungle!!! I think this location will always be a favorite!! So many fun memories, and great meals here!! Love sitting on the patio when weather permits.  Pita jungle has the BEST HAPPY HOUR around. My favs are the falafel, the shrimp, mushrooms, hummus and garlic dip. Soooo good!! We're pescatarians so can't review the meat dishes, but the spinach pasta is one of my personal favs. Don't think I've ever had anything here that wasn't wonderful, and thrilled that they have so many great meatless choices. Our server once recommended we try the Chipotle flatbread with tofu, insane!!! I know, many don't get real starry eyed over tofu, but this, omg, was absolutely incredible!!!  Always good food, the service is exceptional, the servers are knowledgeable and fun, and the patio on the water is a very nice plus."}
{"text":"Pita jungle is usually pretty good, but I just got frozen basically inedible dolmades in a takeout order and it's making reconsider eating there again. So disappointing."}
{"text":"Horrible experience - 50 min wait for food and the server misplaced my card and didn't seem to care at all!"}
{"text":"A little on the pricey side for healthy food. Sometimes the fruit and veggies are a little on the old side. For the most part, their food is delicious! I love the cheese fantasia platter and the broiled chicken salad! Delish!"}
{"text":"I came into this location as soon as it opened, Upon arrival I was immediately greeted and pointed towards a table. After choosing a seat my server offered me a drink and took my order. Everything was good and the food is great. I just received a lot of dirty looks from a few people which made me feel awkward 1 of which was a server who was wearing a pink shirt and a pink hat. Other than that I'd say this visit was very pleasant for me and I'd return on my own time for sure."}
{"text":"Used to love the food here, can no longer say the same. Ordered the pesto turkey lavash with tofu and it tasted very gross they also put a cucumber head with the stem on it in my side salad. Ordered a chocolate covered baklava and they gave me 1 old mushy strawberry. Not to mention it took 40 minutes for our food to come out. Not going to stop here ever again."}
{"text":"This pita jungle was the BEST yes I said BEST restaurant I have ever been to. The food was so delicious like to die for kind of food lol and the staff was very nice and on top of everything. Had my drinks refilled before I asked and my food was served to me quickly after they took my order. I Highly recommend this location it is the BOMB!!! GOOD Job to all the staff!!!"}
{"text":"This place serves really great food at very reasonable prices!   We usually end up there around 9 p.m. or later and the place is always hoppin'.  The staff is very accommodating so you have the mixture of good food, good prices and good service - what could be better?"}
{"text":"Fantastic food at great prices! Doesn't get any better for \"fast food\"....$1-2 tapas during \"happy hour\"; amazing! Wish Pita Jungle would come to CT..."}
{"text":"I love everything about this place and I eat at a Pita Jungle at least once a week. Here's why I love this place...   First, the waitresses are all super cool and edgie. If you're a semi-goth chick with a couple of tattoos, midrif, belly button ring, and hot body, you ought to apply to Pita Jungle and go get me some hummus.   Second, the hummus. I get a hummus plate with 1/3 hummus, 1/3 babaganoosh, and 1/3 Tadzhiki (my spelling stinks I'm sure). This is a great appetizer and is fun to share.   Third, the prices. This place is a great bargain.   Fourth the portions... They're huge!   Fifth, the \"Garden Veggie Wrap\". Okay I love meat. But occasionally my body tells me I need some veggies. When this occurs I go to Pita Jungle and order this beast. It's huge, it's tasty and it's loaded with veggies. I figure I get a week's worth of veggies in one sitting with this baby.   Sixth, everything else. I love everything on the menu... the smoothies, the Lavosh Schwarma Wrap, the pizza's, the wine list, and the Seafood Provencal is an amazing portion of seafood for 10 bucks.   In closing please excuse my spelling. I ran spell check and apparently my spelling here is so bad even spell check can't help me."}
{"text":"Hate the new decor and lighting. If I wanted to  feel like  I was eating in hospital cafeteria. I would go to one"}
{"text":"I had dinner here with three good friends. The waitress was extremely patient when we didn't look at our menu for practically 15 minutes because we were catching up. The food was great and the atmosphere was very relaxing. Every dish had a Greek twist to it so be ware. I would return to try more."}
{"text":"One of our favs! We love the cauliflower side dish, we love the garlic dip, we love the jalapeno hummus!"}
{"text":"I'm so bummed! If you are looking for an owner/manager that appreciates your business, this is not the place. No matter how good the food or how great the service is, I believe common decency is important. It surprises me that the staff is so good seeing that their leadership is so rude. I know many other businesses that will appreciate my business and look forward to taking my business elsewhere in the community."}
{"text":"I have to admit, I'm not a fan of Americanized ethnic food. But this place does a very good job of it. They offer high quality food and atmosphere at prices lower than you would expect. Their food selection is quite healthy as well. About the only thing deep fried on their menu I could find is falafel. Their Mahi Mahi with Pita chips, in particular, is very good. And their hummus, you can tell easily, is very fresh."}
{"text":"Nice to have a closer Pita Jungle.  This location is missing the Pond they have at the other location past the 101 on Ray Road, but it has a much bigger patio which is always a good thing.  The inside of the restaurant is pretty big and a little more modern than the other Pita Jungles.  The staff was very nice and efficient on my visit.  Since they have only been open two weeks I think that is a very good sign.   This is a busy shopping center so the parking isn't as great as you would assume it to be. A special note to the Minivan that parked in the compact spot next to me, your car is not a compact.  Try:  - Nachos! - Ginger Stir Fry - Lavosh Pizza  - Hummus"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite lunch spots, I have to admit this place is addicting.  Cilantro Jalape√±o Humus?  Yes sounds crazy but and amazing blend or love and spice, everything nice!  Glazed Chicken Lavoush is a treat and I agree the portions are hefty, but healthy.    Great concept, the staff seem very happy, and it shows because their service is fantastic.  I am ready for lunch in a couple hours.... I'm bringing my flute for a little magic.  stay classy Pita Jungle"}
{"text":"I've eaten at Pita Jungles before, and I love their food. That being said, I will never visit this Pita Jungle again. My husband and I gave it three tries, and every time the service was really terrible."}
{"text":"Huge greek food fan here.  The Pita jungle is awesome!  However, it's not the best place to get your typical greek fare from.    FOOD: Their wraps and pitas (of course) are great.  For lunch, try the Schwarma Wrap and for dinner, get the Medchillada...it's huge!!!  The great thing about Pita Jungle is that it's extremely healthy for a restaurant.  Their food isn't greasy and they have whole wheat pitas and brown rice.   The hummus is always good as well.  They're not skimpy either...when you get chicken in a wrap, they stuff it with huge chunks of chicken breasts.  SERVICE - They have an opportunity here, but I won't complain too much.  This location seems to be better than others.  The wait staff is average, however extremely fast.  The kitchen can really get things out quickly which is great for lunch.  VALUE - Awesome value.  Just about everything is under $10 and you can get some pitas and wraps for around $6.   If you're in to greek and/or healthy food, give it a try!"}
{"text":"Pita jungle is a solid fast casual restaurant where you can get a quick healthy bite to eat.   Love the ambiance of the restaurant and will have to come back to check out happy hour."}
{"text":"Its a Friday early in the evening and we decide to go to Pita Jungle. Good fresh healthy food. We walk in and its not too crowded. Pretty clean as always. We are seated right away and are asked about drinks. We order them and start glancing at the menu. I must say I do love the new happy hour menu. Awesome small plates that are really affordable of some of the best hummus and garlic dip and other great stuff. We get our drinks and then the waitress takes our order. I order a happy hour garlic dip and the Gyro. My husband gets the tuna with hummus. She leaves us and we wait.   It starts to get more crowded. Another four sets of couples come in while we are waiting and talking. We are still waiting. All the other tables are getting their drinks and ordering. Still waiting. Then the other tables start getting their food. Wait, what? We got here almost 15 minutes before those guys. How come they got their food? Ok. Still waiting. Another set gets all their food. Mmmkay. Our waitress comes over and offers us refills. Says food will be out soon. So now I see everyone that arrived after we did eating happily with huge plates of food. Bummer. I wonder why we were ignored and put last? We were very nice and polite. We showered. We weren't dressed bad. However, we are not your \"normal\" looking couple. Maybe that is it. Hmmmmm...  Food finally comes. I get the garlic dip. Husband gets the hummus. He gets his pita for the hummus. Wait, don't I get at least one pita? The waitress huffs and goes and checks on that. So I grab my husbands plate of pita. I rip one apart and it snaps like a cracker. What the? Its toasted solid. Not soft, but hard with crisp black edges. My husband didn't mind it but I did. So I pick around the softer center part to enjoy my garlic dip. Then the main plate of the Gyro arrives. And they gave me a small plate of little pita for the dip. Cold and un-warmed, but I was glad it was not burnt. We finish the garlic dip and I start on my Gyro. Three bites in I get a serious crunch. Then this awful taste in my mouth. The lamb inside the gyro is burnt. Burnt to a nasty charred crisp. Since I already ate 1/3 of it (it was all veggies and this was my first bite of the meat) I politely asked for a box. We pay and leave. Not very happy.   To sum up, bad service. Burnt or un-warmed food. Good garlic dip. They highly need to fix some service and cooking issues before we return again if ever."}
{"text":"Really good, reasonably-priced, dinner option.  I was a little skepitcal (being from out of town) because of the name and the uninspired strip mall that houses it. But my native pho-town guide said it was one of his favorites, and that his career exile in DC had him missing Pita Jungle.  The hummus was fantastic - one of the best I've ever eaten, and the accompanying pitas were very good. We all ordered various forms of the chicken shawarma (pita or plate), and they were large portions of chicken, fresh vegetable additions, and delicious sauce. It was a great deal at about $10. I also got the butternut squash soup, which was good, but not amazing.  Pretty cheap eats for this part of town, fresh and delicious food, good service, very fast food prep, and a really lovely establishment overall."}
{"text":"I used to like this place but tonight, not so much. The falafel appetizer was dry and tasteless. The dolmades were mushy and watery-tasting. Tapas of mussels contained TWO mussels!!??   Two mussels!! The scallop portion had three small scallops. The only reason I gave them one star (other than not being able to give no stars) was the Philly steak sandwich which was ok.   Done here...."}
{"text":"This is a nice location close to downtown, plenty of parking spaces which is a big plus. Food is good, I've been to most of their locations. I order the hummus with chicken and pine nuts which is always good, had a side of garlic dip (make sure to ask for a side of olive oil with it) had the coconut curry soup which is a very good soup. Just a side note: the bathroom is disgusting!! They really need to take care of their bathroom sanitation."}
{"text":"Five stars to Pita Jungle for being one of the handful of places that my mom, dad, husband  all enjoy. Oh, and I love it.  After about 2 hours of deliberations last night we decided to head over to the Scottsdale location. Bad news was that it was a 25 minute wait. The wait was made even worse by the fact that I'm quite sure the hostess accidentally skipped over us at least once. But once we sat down we forgot all about it. The parents had the salmon ($13), my husband had the seafood provencal and I had the med platter (it's the first time i\"ve gotten anything other than the lentil fattoush salad, which is one of my all-time favorite meals). We all all got the cup of red lentil Turkish soup which was fabulous! Everyone was happy and full at the end of the meal and my dad was even excited about how cheap everything was.. thank you Pita Jungle."}
{"text":"I'd like to congratulate Pita Jungle on having the balls to move into the deserted shithole that is West Mesa -- someone has to do it first! Now there is a great, healthy restaurant that's open past 8 p.m (they're open 'til 10! 10 p.m.! In West Mesa! Can you believe it?!?) As typical with Pita Jungle, the food was tasty and fresh. And it was served up a little faster than some of the other locations because it was less crowded. Also, the building looks really cool. However the renovated it, they did a great job -- it's open and much sunnier than some of their other spots. I'm sure I'll be coming here a lot for weekday lunches."}
{"text":"Great healthy option in the Happy Valley area.  There are many restaurants to choose from, and this fits the bill to meet your health conscious needs.  The wifey and I love the Baba Ganoosh.  However, I felt the pitas were a little chewy, but the flavor and taste of the Baba Ganoosh is quality. Therefore, the flavor outweighed the chewiness of the pita.  I ordered the spicy chicken wrap, and really felt the chicken and wrap should be separate.  The chicken is just too saucy and drips from the foil.  I believe placing the chicken in a bowl while dipping the pita/wrap would be a better way to enjoy this entr√©e, because the flavor of the sriracha is a great kick to eat with a fork.  Although I am just a yelper that eats!  Overall, the wifey and I love the hip atmosphere.  It feels young and fresh, which exemplifies the taste of the food.  We will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"This Pita Jungle is the best one in town! They don't cheat you on the amount of food you get! The prices are good! We come down from PRESCOTT just to go here! A+ service! Never been disappointed here! The best healthiest food in town!!!"}
{"text":"This Pita Jungle is not as good as the others! Their portions are a lot smaller!! We love the other Pita Jungles! This one is the closest to us so it is disappointing that they are so cheap with their portions because we have to drive past it to go to another one! Sad but true!!!! Tried many, many times!!!"}
{"text":"Very good food and wait staff . Hummus with grilled chicken and a pita bread make a great lunch. My second time here and I'm happy . :-)))"}
{"text":"Completely INCOMPETENT! I would leave a review of Pita Jungle's food, but I never received it! Not only that, the manager was completely unhelpful and the staff was clueless.  This evening, I ordered two gyros, a chicken shawarma wrap, hummus, and garlic dip through UBER Eats. The driver arrived about 40 minutes later with half of our order missing! I tried catching the driver before he drove off, but I missed him. So, I lodged a complaint with UBER Eats, but to no avail.  Then, I noticed that the missing items were crossed out on my receipt so, I contacted Pita Jungle about my erroneous order. Sure enough, they didn't even prepare my missing items. However, I WAS STILL CHARGED THE FULL AMOUNT! First I spoke with the hostess who tried to hurry me off of the phone (after putting me on hold for 5 minutes). She recommended that I contact UBER, and then she lamely tried offered me store credit (I guess she didn't realize that I'm ordering delivery for a reason and I'm hungry now...intelligence check?).  Finally, I spoke with the manager. She was completely rude, unfriendly, and unhelpful. However, before she rushed me off of the phone in less than 10 seconds, she said that she would call UBER and have my food sent ASAP.  ONE AND A HALF HOURS LATER...still no food!!! So, I called back to speak with the manager and found out that she never even called UBER! I can't tell you the last time I was disrespected like this, and received such bad service! Pita Jungle is atrocious, their \"service\" is an assault on the senses (especially their shitty \"manager\"), and their food is GARBAGE!"}
{"text":"Ahwatukee Pita Jungle is open!!!  First trip was great, went for our weekly girls dinner, server Sam is the BOMB!  I have been to every location in the valley and this one is my fav.  Will be a regular spot for us!"}
{"text":"Went to Pita Jungle last night for an early dinner. The restaurant was not half-filled, and the server was great in the beginning with taking our orders, but got progressively worse as the meal went on. He made up for it at the end with bringing to go-drinks, but didnt stop by during the meal for refills.  The food we ordered was very good with good prices.  My wife and I ordered the tapas which worked out well. We had the hummus trio, garlic dip, falafel, mozzarella and tomato, and pita with olive oil and thyme that may have been the highlight. My daughter had the mahi and she enjoyed it, but not as good as salmon. My son had a mac and cheese kids meal that had great variety, comes with fruits, vegetables and a protein. He opted for the mashed potatoes which were good.  We had he turtle cheesecake for dessert which may have been frozen, but tasted yummy.  We will be back after not having gone for years. Hope the service picks up a little though."}
{"text":"Great AZ based restaurant chain that is growing and why not, the food is very good.  I have eaten here for years and should probably have more consistency in my check ins because I would be the BOSS!    For those who seek healthy catering options, these guys rock my staff have always appreciated it.  Their menu selection is very diverse and the hummus is off the hook.  I love having the mahi with hummus and pita chips!    You can always try out their lavoush pizza's and never forget their Pitas!   The staff are always cool hipsters that actually work really hard for their tips (at least in the two locations I frequent).    Only feedback for the owners of the company would be to be more consistent in your recipes across your expansions!"}
{"text":"Place is really nice and a great duck off spot, i definitely recommend it to anybody.. it caters to the vegetarian crowd but have food for the meaty crowd as well...  Philly Chicken Pita is the bomb....."}
{"text":"We come here 2-3 times a month and have yet to have bad service or a bad meal. We like the bar and most of our service has been from the bartenders. Pita jungle has the best hummus and pita we have had in AZ and the grilled chicken is very good. Bartenders mix drinks well and are friendly. Vegetarian or not they have a great selection for you and your plant and bean eating friends.   We have never done take out so I cannot comment on how good it is but it seems very popular as it fly's out the door all day / night. I'm not sure who does the hiring but they do hire attractive women so its a nice bonus if that matters on where you choose to eat :) extra star for the hiring."}
{"text":"Hair inside my food. The manager is extremely rude and not professional. If only you knew how this place is ran. The water smells like they received it from the bathroom. No one is wearing proper gloves to handle food. everything you eat is handled from someone else's actual hands. Nasty place to eat."}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken combo platter. My two pieces of chicken breast were way too dry and the pita bread should be soft also. I could hardly to hear what my friend was talking about at the restaurant because the music was too loud. There are some improvements which the restaurant management needs to work on."}
{"text":"Oh no Pita Jungle what have you done?  I can overlook the skimpy pine nut garnish on my favorite appetizer, but taking away the strawberry kiwi iced tea has left me heart broken. Please bring it back!The passion tea you offer is too strong and doesn't even compare to the refreshing strawberry kiwi. I have introduced so many friends to this tea and it quickly becomes their favorite.  I would give you a 5 star rating for the food, but taking away the tea seriously is a big fail in my eyes."}
{"text":"This place was mediocre at best. The customer service was terrible. I could barely tell who was working there and who wasn't."}
{"text":"Bad service at the Norterra location that is the only reason I'm giving it 2 stars. The waitress blamed it on the expo, then the other waiter blamed it on lack of staffing. The place had maybe 20 people in the entire place and 3 at the bar. Great food good prices bad service. Will not return to this location again."}
{"text":"Man, I love Pita Jungle. I found them as soon as I moved to the Valley in 96 and have been a customer ever since. The atmosphere is chill and the food is awesome. Get an order of the jalape√±o, cilantro hummus! It's pretty damn good! I've never ordered something I didn't love at Pita Jungle. Get in there!"}
{"text":"Pita Jungle has a huge selection of menu items that can be ordered by vegetarians which is why I'm giving it 3 stars, however, the wait staff had no uniforms when I was there and the way they were dressed did not give the impression of cleanliness with their clothing choices. It's great that you can work somewhere that allows for nose rings, lip rings, etc., however, this isn't the greatest look for a busy restaurant and made me hesitate to return. The noise is deafening to the point that I had to text the people at my table in order to have a \"conversation\" with them. If I go again, I'll be getting my food to go as it's much more restful to eat someplace that I can actually have a conversation with my dinner companion."}
{"text":"First time coming to this location & it was ok. We used to live closer to the downtown one & loved going there! Food & service was consistently good! We stopped here for lunch on Saturday & they seemed a little disorganized. When we responded, \"dining in\" to the greeter's question, he then appeared confused on where to sit us. He kind of walked us around & kind of told us to pick where we'd like to sit. We had no preference so he took us to a booth but he needed to have some boxes removed first. It was odd since they weren't very busy & there was plenty of other seating. Our waitress was a delight though! Friendly & attentive! I tried one of the seasonal specials, the Roasted Veggie Penne Salad, & it was tasty! Hit the spot! The other weird thing was the tables seemed dirty. I noticed my napkin was sticking to it & when I went to lift it, some of it tore off & stuck to the table. Then I realized what I thought was the \"style\" of the table, grey with white splotches, was actually just a bunch of napkin pieces stuck all over. It was like that at our table & the ones next to us. Not sure we'd come back to this location. Maybe we'd just order pick up next time."}
{"text":"This is one of the best Pita Jungles in the Valley! Ashely, the bartender/MOD, is AMAZING and makes your dining experience off the chart! Her knowledge and enthusiasm about the food industry and Pita Jungle makes you want to come back over and over! PS- Best chicken breast in town!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, and outstanding service. I am so glad they have finally opened Pita Jungle close to where I live."}
{"text":"I really like Pita Jungle. We went when it was packed and the service was still fast. We got a gamut of healthy dishes hummus, beans, veggies that all turned out to be really great. Ive also had the lentil fetoosh salad at a another location. That lentil combo is called mjadara to those of us who eat it at home...cant say that it tastes like my mom's, but for those who dont know what the real deal tastes like, its pretty good ;)"}
{"text":"Love love love eating here.  I often crave their Black Bean Burger and have tried to make one at home but haven't figured out a few ingredients they use (flavor-wise).. oh well, I guess I'lll just have to come here for it.  Other things i LOVE to eat here: - Caramelized Cauliflower w/ Tahini - oof, so my favorite! - Lentils!! I love cumin and this definitely hits the spot - Grilled Vegetable Salad.. they are not stingy at all with the portions on this one - Lavash 'Quesadilla' starter.. OMG.. crispy, cheesy, oh my!  Food has always been great tasting, never disappoints and I do not get bored.  Only downside is that when this place gets busy, it gets BUSY and you have to wait a lot longer for food turn-around time... servers are quick and I've never had bad service (just maybe slow service, but hardly a fault of theirs if the kitchen is slammed)."}
{"text":"I got chicken tika masala to go and the rice was undercooked and the portion was so small and there was not really any flavor. If I had more time I would have returned it. Not too pleased."}
{"text":"Love this place. eat here at least once a month. I always order the lavosh shawarma & chicken del sol. enough said"}
{"text":"Let's cut the witty intro and get right down to the awesome food recommendations:  Cilantro Jalapeno Hummus ... AWESOME! Hummus with Chicken ... AWESOME and filling! Spinach and 4 Cheese Quesadilla ... TASTY!  Just go there. Go for lunch with a bunch of people on a sunny day and sit outside near the lake/pond. Go for dinner on a first date with a cute girl. Just go there."}
{"text":"Back when I did a stint as a pescetarian  (I did four months) I went to this place, it was good meaning the food.   What I didn't like was how crowded this place was and how children were just screaming from left to right. (side note: I'm a tolerant person around kids even though I have none) but this was over the top. Basically the tables were so close you actually were sitting with other people eating with them, and that made me awkward.   None the less I never went back.. but I still gave it a four star because overall the food was really good and they had a ton of good choices to choose from. :)"}
{"text":"My family has visited Pita Jungle at the Happy Valley location three times, and all three times the experience has been wretched.  On two events, the food service was poor, the waitresses did not appear to care about what they were doing, and each time payment to escape the personal hell took forever.    On the final attempt we tried ordering food for takeout; this turned out to be a failure as well.  The order was lost and the staff insinuated that I either never placed the order or that it was made to a different location.  When making the call however, I told them who I spoke with {Cindy} and when confronted she did not recall taking the order.  Attempting to fix the order and give them one more chance, I waited for 25 minutes before throwing in the towel and calling it quits on this location.  It's too bad because at other locations in Phoenix, the food is actually quite good.  Three strikes your out!  Will NEVER return and will not recommend to family or friends."}
{"text":"While this Pita Jungle location isn't my absolute favorite (I like the Arcadia location much more), it gets the job done. Since I work in Mesa, where the to-go lunch options are VERY slim, I know I can rely on this place if I'm starving and in a rush. One of the nice things is that I can either call in my order or place my order online, and then pick it up in a flash.  Some of my menu favorites are the: pesto pizza, grilled veggie salad and cilantro jalapeno hummus. One of the nice things about pita jungle's menu is that the food isn't greasy and I don't feel like an oinker after scarfing down my lunch.  The atmosphere at this particular location is much more casual than the PJ in Arcadia, and the service is A-OK. I guess this place just doesn't get me really excited, but the food is good, healthy and somewhat close to my office in downtown Mesa."}
{"text":"Pita Jungle is one of those trusty lunch spots you can rely on to combat your afternoon hunger pains. The food is good, not blow you away amazing, but I've always left feeling happy with my meal. Plus, I give them major props for a healthy menu and their hummus is yummy.... Cilantro Jalapeno Hummus? Yes please!  Generally I order the Wood-fired salmon salad, and for about $11 I think that's a pretty good deal (especially for salmon). The pitas and wraps on their menu are in the $6-9 range, and I enjoy the Veggie Garden Wrap - it even has eggplant in it, a favorite of mine. With ample portions and reasonably priced food, Pita Jungle is a solid member of my lunch restaurant rotation.   I just wish it wasn't located in a strip mall. During lunch time the parking lot can be complete madness, and the inside can get crowded as the tables are somewhat close together.   This particular location on Indian School (I'm not sure about other spots) also has a reverse happy hour that lasts for just one hour, from 9pm-10pm (close). I thought that was kind of interesting... a one hour happy hour? That's cutting it close... but the deals are really good, $3 for a glass of wine. However the fact that it's so short makes it highly unlikely that I'll head there just for reverse happy hour, but count me in for lunch!"}
{"text":"We came here at 1 pm on a Friday and it was packed. The service was slow but we understood because it was packed. We ordered the special avocado hummus so good. We then each ordered the Mediterranean sampler plate. For future reference that is a meal for 2. The falafel. Taziki, baba gonoush and dolmades were very good. I look forward to my leftovers tomorrow....yummy"}
{"text":"We've eaten at every Pita Jungle location, and PJ is one of our favorites. It's a perfect place for lunch because even if they're busy, their service stays consistent. They've always been friendly and it never takes too long to get your orders."}
{"text":"The black bean chipotle burger is my favorite thing on the menu to order (because I'm fake healthy) the chicken Shawarma is also a  house favorite I always recommend that for first timers.   Pita jungle is nestling ground for hipster food junkies and the atmosphere reflects that. It's s great place for groups and late night dates for two. Super chill vibe and music is always A-1."}
{"text":"1st time. Got small hummus, split it w/ all three kinds. Very delicious. Salmon salad was also delicious. Would recommend & will be back!"}
{"text":"Pretty good stop for healthy clean eating. Brother in law took us here to eat. We had a cilantro hummus with pita bread pretty bomb. I ordered the chicken combo platter it was really good , the chicken are huge pieces . Has rice and beans and a lemon taste to it with mash potatoes I believe way on the bottom . Gulva lemonade was sour but great taste as well. I had fresh fruit to . I will say the girls bathroom when I went in it it smelled disgusting so please take care of that but over all great vibe great food."}
{"text":"This is a pretty straightforward Pita Jungle - I've been here twice, both times for lunch on a weekday. Parking is a pain, so plan accordingly.  The decor is ... nicer?... than other Pita Jungles I've been to, as far as being less bohemian and more upscale, I suppose. If  your idea of \"upscale\" is minimalist modern art 80s decor (lots of black and white geometric shapes with pops of primary colors)   The food is as good as any Pita Jungle. It did take a very long time to come out, even though we ordered right away upon arrival, and while the restuarant was busy, it was not crazy busy.   The real issue is the service. We've dined at the restaurant twice, with groups that are not particularly huge - 5 people the first time, 5 people the second time.   On my first visit, the hostess tried to refuse to do anything to allow us to sit as a group of 5, unless we wanted to sit at the tall communal table. It was 6 months ago, so my memory is a tiny bit fuzzy, but what stands out is that a) our very reasonable request was apparently insane and b) she was very very rude, and continued to be rude in our direction throughout the entire meal.  On my second visit (this past week) we sat at the high communal table (to hopefully avoid conflict with any wayward staff members) The communal table is perched at the edge of the bar area, and it suffers from what I consider to be \"bar-bad-service-syndrome\", which is where the servers handling tables in the bar either have way too large of a section and/or are also taking tables in other parts of the restaurants, and as a result they never show up to help you.   Our server (30s, long dark hair, mean face) was incredibly annoyed with us from the very beginning. Any and every request was met with exasperated looks, irritated body language, and eye rolls galore. Not \"can I please have caviar served on a gold platter while you balance on an elephant's back\" sort of requests... can we please have straws, can I substitute roasted vegetables instead of salad, etc.  Here's the thing: when you disappear for 20 minutes at a time, yes, when you return to the table there are going to be several requests that have built up in the meantime, since you deserted us with no assistance for way, way too long.  We were celebrating one friend's birthday (hence the lunch outing) and when the bills were presented, I asked the server to please charge both my check and her check to my Amex. As you can imagine, irritated hair flipping and grimacing ensued.  I even made it as simple as possible by placing both checks into the same black folio. When I recieved my check back, I noticed it was for a lower than expected amount. Upon further investigation, the birthday-girl's check was charged to ANOTHER member of the party (who had not asked for this) SO. FRUSTRATING.  We worked it out amongst ourselves and beat a hasty retreat far far away. Hopefully we can find a better Pita Jungle destination somewhere close to work for future lunch-jaunts.This place is the pits."}
{"text":"What a great location!   It is pretty new, and I love it because it is super convenient to pop over on my lunch hour.   The decor is beautiful; more modern and trendy than many Pita Jungles I've been to, but in an awesome way. They have lovely and unique light fixtures throughout, and the restaurant features a pallette of silver, light blue, and grey tones throughout. There are some neat rustic accents as well, including wooden \"banquette\" seating on the patio that is just gorgeous. The patio is covered and can be enclosed with plastic \"windows\" - we sat outside on a day that was just a little cool and it was so comfortable! The indoor section opened to the patio through several sets of nanodoors, which were kept open. The patio seating was very comfortable.   We had a wonderful server who was very prompt and checked in regularly. She accidentally dropped a fork at the table next to us  (which startled everyone) but she had a great sense of humor about it, apologizing and laughing about making everyone jump a foot.   The food was great, as usual - delicious pitas and hummus. I got their Mahi Mahi with Cilantro Jalapeno Hummus, Pita Chips, and pea tendrils. It was very good, although the pita chips were heavily dusted with a red powder that covered my fingers and rubbed off on my face and clothes - I was a disaster by the end! Definitely recommend being careful with those.   Pricing is just a little high for a lunch spot, I'd be happier if the items were $1-2 less each, based on the quality, but honestly the setting and service made me overlook that completely.   If you're in North Scottsdale and want to hit Pita Jungle for lunch, definitely try this location!!"}
{"text":"The most inconsistent of the four Pita Jungle restaurants I have been to - always disappointed and say I am not coming back to this location."}
{"text":"This is our favorite Pita Jungle of the five locations we have been to. We wonder why we go to any other when we do.  Food is consistently good and what we expect when we order a known item. Servers who have been there know what we like and are very friendly and helpful. Josh is one of our favorites!!!"}
{"text":"Love the decor of this Pita Jungle - had not been to this location before. Food wasn't as good as the Shea location but better than Desert Ridge. It was a fun evening for us.  Great service!"}
{"text":"It was around 4 pm when I walked in for a to-go order. I ordered the hummus with grilled chicken under the appetizer section. I didn't have to wait long for my order to arrive, probably 5-10 minutes at the most.  The decor was very airy it was very well lit.  I agree with fellow yelpers that their hummus was smooth and flavorful. Actually, it is probably the best hummus I've had in a while.    There was a sliver of cucumber, a small wedge of tomato and one olive on top of the hummus. Then there was a fairly generous portion of grilled chicken and pine nuts sprinkled on top as well.  However, I was extremely disappointed with the chopped grilled marinated chicken. The chicken pieces were definitely over cooked and dried. If I was eating at the restaurant, I would've definitely made a comment to the wait staff. The chicken also had a tangy marinate to it which was too tangy for my liking. It felt like there was an extra squeeze of lemon juice that I thought they could do without. This was a bummer since their hummus is indeed very good and if it was cooked properly with juicy pieces of chicken then this place would have gotten a 4 stars at least.  The two pitas that they give you are a lot larger than the normal pita breads you get at the store so there is plenty to share.  If I'm in the area again craving Mediterranean food, I'll probably give this place a try again and order something that doesn't have their grilled chicken."}
{"text":"STELLAR Happy Hour Prices.......  More $2.00 food options than I have ever seen!  Martinis might have been $3.00? I forget....  But it wasn't crappy well liquor either!  Tons of outdoor seating - but like most PHX restaurants - the views were of the parking lot - as well as Desert Ridge.  Tons of indoor seating as well.  \"Acoustics\" not so great - but I dont see it intende to be a romance destination."}
{"text":"Great food, slooooow service. I didn't understand why our server Kayla was sitting down talking to customers who were eating the whole time and when we wanted to pay she was across the restaurant sitting down talking to someone else.. Luckily I reached out to another male server to take our payment. It's just kinda annoying when the restaurant was practically empty by the time we left and I couldn't get anyone to take our payment. At least the food was delicious!!"}
{"text":"I love this place, highly recommend trying the hummus and chicken. Ask for pita chips instead of the regular pita. Also got to try the broiled chicken salad, so good."}
{"text":"I stopped in for a late lunch with my son and was very pleasantly surprised at just how good the service was here.  We had drinks by the time we sat down and our baba ganoush app was there in light speed.  The food was very good and the Gyro that followed were huge and amazing.   Very cool artwork on the walls and the nice and clear appearance make this place high on my list for a quick byte for lunch. A bit more upscale than your average lunch spot yet with the prices and service that are better than most.  Will certainly be back for a tasty Gyro."}
{"text":"Yum!  Great service, great atmosphere.  The food is like a healthier take of Greek food.  Pretty tasty and less guilt!"}
{"text":"Second time I've been to this location.  I generally go to the Dobson/Ray location, which I greatly enjoy.  This place plain.. how do i put it... sucked.  We had nice patio seating, around 7pm, three of us girlfriends.  Our server took forever to get us our drinks to the point we had to go up to the bar after a while to get them ourselves.  Then before our food came out, we were told one of the things I ordered was out: (Kafta Burger was out prior to me ordering it) cauliflower, so now I had to get something I'd never had before: Spinach Lavosh Quesadilla.  OK, fine.  My spinach lavosh thing was a gross combo but I was hungry, so I ate it.  The spinach was a terrible ingredient in this combo, I think Arugula would've tasted better or even basil.  My friends Gambas were tiny and the sauce was below-par (she also usually orders this at the Ray/Dobson location... flop.  Our drinks were correct but the table next to us (who were there for a birthday) got their drinks and their food all screwed up, plus really late.  They complained and got helped by a guy... we didn't complain as we figured they'd covered our concerns already.  It is terrible planning when a restaurant like this doesn't have things off the menu.. it's frustrating to keep ordering and keep being told they're out.  Get your stuff together, folks!"}
{"text":"Walked in and ordered the Grilled Vegetable Salad with extra green veggies and the gal taking the order was friendly, prompt and my to-go container came out within 10min with a *crap* load of veggies - seriously awesome that they were not meager or stingy with those portions.  The green salad portion was small, but since I got lot of sauteed greens, I was more than full with that.  The ambiance is nice inside... I like it much better than the Ray/Dobson ambiance. This place has much more open seating and, like the Ray/Dobson location, a nice outdoor seating area (but in the front).  Actually, as I parked the car, I was thinking this place was going to be packed.. when I walked in, realized the patio was busy because no one was really seated inside - duh, April! the weather is perfect for outdoor dining these days!  Food was plentiful and delish, staff was friendly and quick, ambiance was nice yet casual - I'd come back if ever in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"We have eaten at this Pita Jungle about 5 times.  It has been good all of the times.  The only thing I will not order is the tuna and hummus here.  They cook it differently than the Pita Jungle on 44st and Indian School.  The best way to explain it they seem to omit a certain ingredient or two.  Other than that I love this place and it is good. This time we had a pesto pizza with chicken and it was good.  We also ordered the spanokipita (close enough) and it was good too.  I love this place and recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"I really liked the interior designing of this place. There were many displays of artwork by a variety of artists that gives a kinda rustic but modern feeling.   I got the Mediterranean chicken roasted shawarma (mainly cause the name was funny) and it was the perfect portion. There was an equal amount of everything so no flavor of one ingredient like the onion, tomato, or chicken overpowered the other. It was tasty meal overall. Cant exactly pinpoint why but there wasnt nothing to complain about it. The type of full I got from is was a very healthy one in that I didnt feel regretful of my decisions like I would with fries or ramen. My friend got the baba ganoosh (another funny sounding name) and the eggplant sauce that it came complemented my shawarma well so if you ever go to pita jungle, get a friend to order the baba ganoosh and swipe their sauce! (theres a lot so dont feel guilty)"}
{"text":"Mmmmmm. Fresh food, good service. The pita bread is the freshest, softest, yummiest ever! I have had hummus, gyros, \"healthy\" burgers, and fajita pitas here and every time the food is better than the last thing I tried. The potatoes that come with the burgers are great too!"}
{"text":"Healthy, tasty and reasonably priced food. Service is usually quick, and always friendly. Never had a bad meal here."}
{"text":"Love Pita Jungle. Never had a bad meal. Each location is on point with d√©cor,  atmosphere,  food quality and speed of service as well as the friendliness of the staff. There is a reason this formula is so successful it works!!"}
{"text":"i almost died of dehydration...water, water everywhere, and not an attentive server in sight. i blame this on howard B. who could not get his A in gear. i guess the fact that my party of one waiting to double proved to puzzle the pita peddlers, one asked me if i had been helped and i said no, but i was waiting for someone... so no rush...she asked if i would like a drink and i said i would love an iced tea. it must have been a survey because she never came back. i chatted with the ducks for awhile, evidently people in chandler do not talk to ducks, i think that is speciesist, but understandable because i eventually grew tired of their complaining about obamacare and intellectual property laws..i decided that i wanted to eat them, luckily howard arrived to talk me out of it. yay service...  no, not yet. only when I exclaimed \"what is going on here?\" in reference to something typically unsavory, did our hot pants waitress take notice. being loud does pay....blue corn nachos and lavosh shawarma subbing out the greek salad for taboule of course. i love taboule and pita jungle does it well so one star for the taboule. the blue corn nachos were meh (sorry howard) but the ducks enjoyed them. there is a woman who works here who takes a bit of enjoyment from scaring the ducks away by whipping a blue cloth at them, and hey...not so nice lady. ducks love chicken..did you know? this bothers me a little but makes me happy to like chicken as well. so the the other star is for the ducks. to the lady who scares the ducks...i got a warm tingle in my heart when you stepped in the duck poo. quack"}
{"text":"The hummus trio is great and a must.  I had the chicken lavosh pizza and my husband had the Mediterranean salad, both were yummy!  The kids meal was one of the better ones around.  The service was fast!  And don't forget their homemade lemonade!"}
{"text":"Love pita jungle! I've only ever done pick up never gotten to sit down there yet. Love the chicken! Pita is always soft and delicious. the hummus is delish. And love their salads. I've tried a few. It's always busy here."}
{"text":"I just love going to this place! I'm not a vegetarian but they just have such a unique food menu and the service is always great! They have a great variety of tea and I love getting one to go! The warm chicken salad with the pasta and lemon dressing is amazing, I was skeptical to try the dressing but I was pleasantly surprised! It's a great local spot!"}
{"text":"Pita Jungle is so good! I know I'm just joining the ranks upon ranks of people who also love Pita Jungle, but gosh, it is great.  I had gone to another location a year or two ago and couldn't get the delicious Chicken Lavosh Shawarma out of my head ever since! So, we finally got the chance to go back again this past weekend and it was as delicious and pleasant as I remembered.  The dining room at this location is nice: open, bright, with some homey bohemian decor. Speaking of bohemian.. that is pretty much the word of the day with this place - the staff definitely have that vibe and dress accordingly.   Our table was located right by the window to the kitchen, which was probably the least ideal part of our meal this time. It was noisy and our party of three often had trouble getting our conversation heard across the table.   The server was great - kept our drinks full and took care of our order well - everything came out right. He was friendly and helpful.   We started by sharing the hummus and pitas, which was tasty and filling - they really give you a generous portion of the hummus. After surveying the menu at length, I finally settled on a return to my original favorite: the Lavosh Shawarma Wrap and it was as delicious as I remembered! The garlic sauce inside is really what makes it, and the wrap itself is fresh, soft but a little crisp at the same time, and not greasy at all. The wrap normally comes with a Greek Salad, which I don't care for, so  opted for the grilled veggies instead (there is an upcharge for this) - they were AMAZING! I feel strange getting so excited about a side of veggies, but these were seriously delicious. Whatever sauce they cook them is is super tasty - the mix of veggies consisted of broccoli, cauliflower, carrots, mushrooms, zucchini. It was a generous portion and really good.   Pricing is pretty approachable - around $10-15 per person."}
{"text":"My first time experience was a terrible one. A friend of mine and I went over to this place and ordered 2 different orders. They not only mixed up our orders with rice in one and avocado in another but the falafel felt like it was cooked days before."}
{"text":"I love Pita Jungle.  I usually get the gyro (substitute with Chicken), but everything is delicious, you can't go wrong.  Cilantro lime hummus is the bomb."}
{"text":"We just moved from NY and don't know of too many places. Pita jungle was very close to us in awhatukee and we tried it first for take out and then ate at the restaurant! Very cool atmosphere- and great for the kids. I love that they have healthy options that include all the food groups for the kiddos and they enjoyed it! I got a delicious bean burger the last time. Servers are super friendly and attentive. Most definitely will be back for a quick, healthy meal."}
{"text":"Great staff and environment. I'm never disappointed here! Everything I've tried here has been tasty and for great prices too! The Mediterranean chicken wrap is my go-to! I just had the salmon salad and it was excellent! Their happy hours are great too!!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Best hummus I have ever had hands down, its theyre own recipe.  Wraps and gyros are great, and all items on the healthy side.  Its very casual as the staff wears whatever they want basically, its all good vibes and good food.  Def try the black raspberry iced tea."}
{"text":"Great place! I was in the area on a business trip, was really hungry drove around and found this place. No expectations,didn't check any reviews, I walked in it was very busy (good & bad sign right!) I got seated right away very friendly waitress made a few suggestions and took my order, I got the Philly pita, awesome! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I love this place place! I really love that it is a local spot with several locations to choose from. It has a cool, edgy feel while still feeling modern and clean. The food is amazing, I can either have a super healthy meal or indulge a bit. Definite go to for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Honestly, I only come here for their hummus. It is amazzzzzzzzzzzing!  I even had The Boyfriend bring some to San Jose when he visited once. Teeheehee."}
{"text":"Yummy food.  Nice staff.  Tasted healthful and delicious.  Great combination!"}
{"text":"I recently had my baby shower party here in their back room (I was so happy they had a room all to ourselves!) and I was very, very impressed with their service!  My girls arrived at 10:30 to setup since we had it starting at 11am and the staff was friendly and helpful even with helping carry things in.  Our server, Valerie, was very attentive, sweet and quick.  The place itself is very cute and since it kind of went with my theme of 'natural/wildlife', it was an ideal setting... all the decor was spot on and we had very little to decorate for the event (the back room is very well decorated in that sense).  We hosted Sangrias and Tea/Lemonade as well as Appetizers and Lavash Pizzas (basically everything) and with the 10 girls, it came out to $13 a person which was pretty perfect, especially since it included alcohol (the girls ordered whatever drinks they wanted).  The girls afterward said they had a great time, especially since the pizzas were so good (and the sangrias)... I'm happy they liked the food.  This was a great place to host a party and the price point was perfect, too... decor was in-line with our theme and the staff was 5 stars!  I recommend this place :)"}
{"text":"I will admit, I usually love pita jungle, but tonight changed my mind completely. Here is a pic of the wood fired chicken without spinach... somewhere in there is supposed to be mashed potatoes too. My wife got the same thing and we paid $27 for this. I've have been to this location probably over 75 times in the last two years and this is my last. We ended up tossing it after trying it. I took the pic after covering it in pepper to at least not waste all that money, but it didn't help. Unbelievable."}
{"text":"Welcome back to my quick and concise reviews.  I will talk about the food and what I think of it.  What tastes good to me might no to someone else.  I will not talk about every single stupid little detail.  Plus I will not cry because the hostess did not smile at me when I first walked in.  I only care about how the chefs feel anyways.  If you want long reading.  I suggest you read about how to assemble a Haiku poem.    We stopped by here on Saturday at lunch time.  I ordered the Turkey Lavosh Wrap and it was really good.  The salad was really good too that came with it.  We ordered some fried pastries stuffed with feta and spinach.  It was really good.  I did not notice the green pesto on the plate.  That took it up a notch to awesome.  This place is good and I recommend it."}
{"text":"Time for a quick and concise review of this Pita Jungle. I will keep it shorter than two people arguing which is better vanilla ice cream or chocolate ice cream.    I meet the misuses here for lunch today it was her little treat to me.  Plus it is close to her office too.  I pretty much get the same array of things at the Pita Jungle.  The food is pretty consistent location to location.  I had the Turkey Pesto Lavosh wrap and it was good.  The little salad that comes with it was good too.    The only knock on this place and it may be more for me is the sound.  It is loud in this place.  I have a hard time hearing and it was impossible to hear my better half telling me about her morning.  I have to turn my head to hear her the best I could.  That would be the only thing preventing me from coming to this location.  The food was good and the server did a good job.  Just to loud for me to hear.   Great place just a bit noisy."}
{"text":"YAY!!!! I am so excited that there is now a Pita Jungle this close to me. I should probably just leave them my credit card and pick up my dinner daily! The food and service was excellent for our first trip. The food was really hot and fresh. I had a steak pita which was amazing. I really like the green iced tea. I think it was strawberry kiwi and it was yummy! I really love pita jungle and am so glad to have one closer to me. Someone from work brought some of their food to a holiday party and the platters they did were great. All the food went before any other food! The hummus platter had 3 different kinds and each was better than the previous! So they also do great catering/takeout."}
{"text":"this is hands down my favorite place to eat! there pesto pizza tastes absolutely incredible and it's cheap! I would recommend this place to anyone :)"}
{"text":"How can you go wrong with Pita?? I mean, are their things I don't like on the menu? Sure. The point is, more times than not I have left tummy full & happy. Service is good, place is always lively and they have great kid plates. Go! It's good."}
{"text":"Food is very good. It is great to have another healthy option close by. I love Mediterranean food, so in that regard they had me at hello. Though the waitress was very friendly, service was slow. I think they might want to add more staff if they are going to do table service. And the room was freezing - I mean really arctic. So much so that I had trouble enjoying my meal. I will definitely be back, but next time for takeout:)"}
{"text":"I feel a bit silly even writing a review of Pita Jungle...I mean everyone likes this place, right?  Well I have never been disappointed by the food and I've tried just about everything on their menu (but always end up back at the Chicken and Hummus appetizer).  The only complaint I have with this location is how close all of the tables are to one another.  It's kind of tough to have a super private conversation in here during a busy time...but that doesn't stop me normally.  Pita Jungle has definitely become one of my go-to restaurants when I can't figure out what I want to eat because I know they are reliably good."}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat hands down. My favorite items are - broiled chicken salad (sometimes I use my own homemade ranch) this salad is the best. The jalape√±o hummus is so good. The pesto flatbread with chicken is amazing. The fruit Fantasia is so good and so much fruit and cheese comes with it for the price. The chicken deal sol, black bean burger and chicken philly are sooo good!! And the nachos are amazing!"}
{"text":"Excellent food with a lot of healthy options. Excellent service too"}
{"text":"I love all the other Pita Jungles  - sadly this location has been consistently poor!   The food here is 'hit or miss' and the service is terrible!   Eg. My waitress actually rolled her eyes at me today and was pretty rude in general -  yet still managed to get my order wrong!!!!  I do not recommend this location!"}
{"text":"During undergrad and graduate school at ASU, I grew up eating at the Pita Jungle in Tempe.  Recently my friend and I met up at San Tan and she told me there was a Pita Jungle nearby.  Of course we went and I was SOO excited!!!  I loved the ambience.   The food was just as I remembered, only better-nothing is better than Pita Jungle's hummus! The service was right on with everything we needed, without having to ask....a major plus!!  It was everything I could ask for: delicious food & great service! I can't wait to go back for more!"}
{"text":"Fantastic Humus! Yummy! I had a great experience at Pita Jungle the other night. My group and I were sat at a table promptly and our drink order came out quickly. The service was just ok, the waitress forgot one of our appetizers and it ended up come out after our meal:( eeek. But other than that mishap, everything tasted great! The prices are moderate and it had a good atmosphere. I also checked out the bathrooms and they were clean and tidy! Thumbs up for that! Next time I'm craving humus I will go back:)"}
{"text":"I'm so glad I found PJ! I'm on an extended visit from the Bay Area, and getting tired of the 'over-bearing' fancy places in Scottsdale ... everywhere I go, I feel like I'm in a place where every element of the dining experience (architecture, tables, even the darned restrooms!) has been carefully crafted by committee to suck me in and empty my wallet .  PJ is decidedly 'rough and ready' and all the bettter for it.    The caprese salad (tomato / mozzarella/basil) is surprisingly good, and the chicken Lavash (sp?) is fabulous - their bread products are pretty good!   My g/f enjoyed the Salmon too.  I love sitting outside in the heat at night, watching the world go by.  I would warn against the Chicken Tikka Masala, though; the waitress said 'It's good if you like Indian food'; I'd say, only try it if you've never tasted the real thing!  The chicken was pentiful but chopped into mechanical looking cubes, and didn't taste like they'd been in the sauce for long ... and the sprouts were decidely strange.   But still .. the atmosphere, and most of the food, are fabulous, so they get my vote and return dollar!"}
{"text":"I wish I could love this place... It's just tough.  I've eaten here several times and just haven't really LOVED anything. My sandwiches have always been dry and kind of bland tasting. Salads have been ok, but I usually feel like I can make them better. Hummus - dry. Dolmades - tasted like the ones from the jar. Ahh, so sad, because it's food that I do normally love.  Here is why I gave this a three- happy hour prices are good ($2 or $3 for small plates). With prices like that, I can forgive some of the food quality a bit."}
{"text":"Ah yes. The good life.  Just finally had Pita Jungle for the first time. Read a lot of reviews about it. Friends bragged about it. Did some research online. Then I decided to order my lunch online since I only had an hour for lunch.  I ordered the Mediterranean Salad with a side of Mixed Beans.  Salad....divine. Golden raisins. I got mine with double chicken. Dressing wasn't necessary. Enough flavor in the vinegar and light oil. I only ate hlf of this thing because it was DAMN huge.  The mixed beans were interesting. I thought it would be a small portion. Turns out it was for a family of 14. Ok.....I'm overdoing it a bit. Family of 4. Amazing mix of pinto, lima, northern, etc. Fantastic flavors.  I'm coming back. Short review? Yes. But keep in mind, I ordered my food, picked it up, met my friend's parents, ate, and wrote this review all in one hour.  Order ahead online for pickup.   Best. Place. Ever."}
{"text":"I recently had some friends over at my house for a impromptu dinner party, and needed some solid grub. Mostly because I was feeling lazy and didn't want to cook.  Judging by my past experience at another Pita Jungle location, I figured that it would be a safe bet, and of course, I was a winner. Again!  If you want to see my review on the food and whatnot, you can read my review for the location on Shea.   This location promptly took my order, I picked it up, and was on my way in no time at all.  They even set me up with all utensils and napkins, without me having to ask for everything.  Portion size was fantastic, as always. We had enough food to feed an army! The sides in particular were a hit. The garlic potatoes and the beans were a hit.  Solid work as always Pita Jungle. I love you long time."}
{"text":"A friend just treated my daughter and I with dinner at the Pita Jungle. I have been meaning to drop in but the place is always packed and when I eat out lately it's mostly from the local fresh produce rack at the store. I developed a real hankerin for hummus when I helped my friend Mamood start tucsongyros.com many years ago. Who would have thunk all those dam brined pea lookin things on the Pizza Hut buffet would ever make it into my stomach again... Pretty darn tasty stuff if you ask me and the Pita Jungle's Cilantro Hummus is made fresh and served perfectly chilled. The Portobello Burger is quite a meal and really appreciate the fresh baked bun. Our server Josselyn was a charming young lady with an old Hayden Mill Flour Sack T-shirt that I must have. Good times and you'll be seeing more of me around these parts."}
{"text":"My friends took me here during my recent visit to Phoenix. I was confused by how excited they got when we decided to try Pita Jungle, assuming it was going to be similar to Pita Pit -- boy was I happy to be wrong!   The building is awesome. High ceiling and lots of windows, with a cool little outdoor patio. The staff was friendly and helpful. We took a while to decide what we wanted, and our waiter was more than patient with us.   The food was delicious! Definitely not your run of the mill pita place.   My only complaints would be that our food took a while to come out, and that when something burned it the kitchen, the smoke flooded into the dining area because of the open-air concept."}
{"text":"Ok, I know I know, I don't live in Phoenix anymore. But holy hell this place is amazing! I moved away 5 years ago and I still think fondly upon this place.  They have the best gyro, in my opinion. Their hummus is fresh and made with love. I like that their children's menu is simple and healthy. All the good things kids need!  Their wood-fired pizzas are to die for. I come down to visit when I can and I always make sure to visit Pita Jungle. I wish the NW, of all places, had something like this. You would think this belongs on my streetcorner here in Seattle...but nope. It's in sunny Phoenix. Well done Phoenix for putting something tasty and healthy in the desert!"}
{"text":"Pita Jungle is an incredible place to eat...they have some amazing things to eat yesterday I had...well don't remember what it was called but it was like a chipotle chicken pizza sort of thing with tomatoes...Wow it was really good...the crust was very thin almost like a thin cracker and loaded with chicken and sliced tomatoes with what I would guess was the chipotle sauce dribbled over it...  If you have not eaten at Pita Jungle you really need to at least give it a try there are many of them around the city and I've eaten at two or three and everyone has been as good as the others. I have yet to have a bad experience with any off them...plus you can call your order in and just run down and pick it up...just saying...really good place to eat...great service...and reasonable prices..."}
{"text":"Had dinner here on Tuesday night. The waitstaff was friendly and prompt. I had the seared ahi tuna with cilantro jalape√±o hummus. I loved it, but my girlfriend felt the tuna was slightly over cooked. She ordered the wood fired chicken. That was excellent as well. I actually liked the flavor of hers better, but both dishes were awesome! I would also like to add that the temp inside the restaurant was comfortable. Most of the time, regardless of time of year, I find most places to be too cold, but this time I was able to leave my jacket off and was never uncomfortable. The parking lot at this location is crowded but I found a spot no problem. The restaurant was full but no wait. Only thing I didn't check out the bathroom, but the rest of the place was clean, so I would be surprised if the bathroom wasn't."}
{"text":"I called  manager over to tell him the tazeki  sauce was full of salt .like some one opened a salt shaker and dropped it in container. He was like I was doing him a favor ."}
{"text":"Just like the other visits.  The food seems to be good and consistent from location to location.    My better half wanted to eat here this time.   I had the turkey pesto wrap.  It was good.  The pesto was right on.    Not much to write about. I have been here a lot and will come back again and again."}
{"text":"Healthy options.  I got a salad,it was huge and delicious.  Ill be back next time I visit that mall."}
{"text":"The food is amazing! I always get the seared ahi on top of the hummas (cilantro jalapeno, red pepper, and original). Totally delicious! I have never had any problems with the food but the service is hit and miss. When I go at 11 beating the lunch rush, services is great.   Another time, I went for lunch with a friend, I arrived around noon, the service is awful. Wait staff did not bring out the side hummas, we had to ask a different server for sauce for the gyro, when our server showed up to take the sauce coming from the other server, she stuck her finger it and had to get another one. Then she decided to take the nearby table's order as we waited with to get her attention. I finally helped myself to a shelf to get my own box. We tried to flag anyone to pay and were told we had to wait for the server.   I have served before and my friend currently works in fine dining so we had very little sympathy for the bad service."}
{"text":"This place is always beyond packed, even when the doors open.  On this particular visit, I was one of 15 people waiting in line when the doors opened.  I had just come out from a movie, was hungry and wanted the grilled chicken and hummus.  I forgot how pricey it can be $11 for just that one dish, but was pleasantly surprised by the portion size.    I waited about 15 minutes for my pick up order even though I called it in ahead of time and had to wait in line to get in the joint, which was less than awesome.  The service is never amazing, here or any of their locations.    The food is what gives the 3 star rating."}
{"text":"It's Pita Jungle; the fast food version of Mediterranean cuisine with some happy hippie service added on... what're you expecting?  The food is good for Americanized slightly bland version of Middle Eastern food. I can make better hummus at home for about $1, but when I'm lazy, this will do.  At least they use quality olives & pickles. I'm not saying I won't eat here again, because I will, but I'll definitely be in casual clothes and have my credit card ready so I don't have to wait an extra 15 minutes for the staff dressed as regular people to hopefully come back and finish my transaction.  If you like mediocre gyros and hummus and don't want to wait forever, PIta Jungle isn't bad.  It's just not phenomenal either."}
{"text":"fantastic nachos and gyro. very trendy place, feels like Seattle."}
{"text":"I frequented this restaurant weekly while in Gilbert for the past 6 months. The food is always excellent.   The service is usually quite good. There are several outstanding servers, but once in a while I have had a server (same server each time this happened )that has never checked back to see if everything is ok. Perhaps it is because I dine alone and  I am not worth that servers time... ( I generally tip 20% sometimes more)"}
{"text":"Had lunch earlier with the hubby.  He had the wood fired salmon, mashed potato, spinach saut√©ed with lots of garlic ! It was cooked to perfection. I enjoyed the  chipotle chicken pizza on flat bread. It was the right amount of cheese and spice.  The service was fast as it wasn't very crowded.   Overall this spot is perfect for a quick healthy bite to eat. Will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Excellent food and a fun atmosphere! We really enjoy eating here. The service is always good and the food is consistently good. This last time I had the Philly Steak Pita and my wife had the Spinach Quinoa Salad. Both were obviously completely different from each other but were equally good. The food is fresh and they are always happy to see you."}
{"text":"The food was delicious and I went at 11am to ensure I could find a parking spot and get quick service. There is a parking garage but there was only a few spots left when we got there.  I had the 4 cheese and spinach quesadilla and it tasted nothing like you would think. More of a Mediterranean cheese crisp, 4 cheese with fresh spinach sandwich between lavosh bread. The tzatiki sauce was very fresh too and great with it. My boyfriend had the Philadelphia cheese pita and it was almost more than he could eat. But we did share a plate of grilled vegetables which was very tasty and spiced just right.  Our first time there and definitely made a fan of me. And there is a coffee shop next door for a mocha to go, which I did."}
{"text":"Ate at this Gilbert location on Williams Field Rd last night. Our regular PJ is Anderson Springs at Dobson which has a bit of a funky bohemian style to it. I think it's hard to franchise bohemian, as I don't like newer locations I've been to as much as the Dobson location. Waitress took our order quickly, but it took almost 30 minutes for our food to come out. I was about 15 seconds from walking out and going to Filibertos next door. The biggest plus is what they've done with their kids menus. Excellent healthy choices! Steamed brocolli, spinach, tofu all on the kids menu.?!?!"}
{"text":"What happened to your restaurant? I used to dine at the original location back in the 90's up until it moved to Mill Ave, it hasn't been the same since. The red pepper hummus was almost the consistency of soup tonight, and your lentil fatoosh salad was very bland and came with no dressing (ordered to go). I'll go to the Mesa location from now on. The whole vibe is so off, nothing like the Apache location. It's so bro-ho now. No thanks-"}
{"text":"There isn't much to add other than to emphasize slower and crappier service compared to their other locations.  It's amazing how moody, posing hipster servers can wreck an otherwise good restaurant.    Pita Jungle's food is still delicious and insanely cheap for lunch or dinner, and I will continue to go back again and again.  The tartness of the cilantro jalapeno hummus can work wonders on an otherwise annoying day.  During my last visit my lunch buddy and I marveled at: A) how this location is much more Tempe-ish in dcor and atmosphere.   B) how skilled our server was at being so disaffected (a definite Hipster Olympics contender) as she tried to look emotionless to everyone equally.  An easily 4 star place - sinking to 3 for service.  I'll take the Arcadia Pita Jungle over Tempe's any day."}
{"text":"Quality food done consistently. This place is a must for anyone. The chicken lavosh pizza is particularly good."}
{"text":"Love the garbanzo coconut curry soup!  I order brown rice with it. So good. Everything here is fresh and yummy!"}
{"text":"I LOVE PITA JUNGLE. There were a couple of girls there super concerned with their hair and constantly playing with it which was kind of gross, but the girl who helped me, Amanda, basically handled everything. She was answering phones, tending the bar, doing to go orders, getting drinks, greeting AND seating all with a smile on her face. Great service and always great food! Thanks, Amanda! 10/10 for sure"}
{"text":"The salads here are absolutely delicious and there is so many choices to choose from! The service was so nice and I enjoyed that the hosts and servers were all wearing their normal attire. The building was so unique and I loved the decor in the place.   I got the Greek Salad, I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"I like to eat healthy and this place has so many delicious and healthy options.  I love the Mediterranean chicken salad and the Spanikopita is so good."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants! I love the chicken pasta salad, my husband loves the chicken Philly pita and the fruit plate is amazing too! In fact everything I've had there is awesome!"}
{"text":"Fresh delicious food and generous portions. Love Pita Jungle.  The roasted chicken salad is the best.  My 2nd favorite is humus with roasted chicken in a wrap. Because I do not eat  Wheat  they graciously substitute Brown rice.  As soon as they serve Wheat Free wraps I will come more often.    1949 W. Ray Rd. was the closest location.  Recently a location opened at 4921 E. Ray Rd. only 6 minutes from my house.  OH Happy Pita Jungle day.    Servers are pleasant, accomodating and efficient.  Never have to wait long for a table or service."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good here. I always get the gyro and my husband likes one of the chicken wraps. We usually call in the order and bring it home since it's always packed in the evenings.   The salmon is also really good for a healthy option."}
{"text":"So, this was my first time to ANY Pita Jungle location and I found it to be good....But, JUST that....Good.  I had heard many GREAT, stellar raves about this place that I was really wanting and hoping to have my heels topped......But, unfortunately - NOT.    Now, don't get me wrong, the ambiance is cool, the vibe is cool, the service is cool.....the traditional lamb Gyro, was average.  First off, I had to salt the lamb itself a little more than I'd prefer to bring the flavors forward, and the Tzaziki sauce (which I ordered on the side, Thank God) had more sourness hints to it than it should have, and that I've experienced at many other Greek spots (that KILL and take names) on the Gyro I had today.  So, while I probably won't ever go back to PJ (unless I'm forced to by a mob of friends/colleagues), I don't bash its teeth out....I just turn my nose up to it because I know of a much better place that I'll continue to get my Gyro Pita's from - And, that place remains the Champ!...Crazy Jim's - 15th Ave - The Original! :)  Take my word for it - I'm ELITE!!! LOL  Happy Dining!"}
{"text":"Met up with a friend here for their happy hour menu where a lot of their stuff is just $2. The food was really good, I wish I knew about this place earlier. Ordered chicken, hummus, pizza, and mozzarella/tomato salad. Everything was really good and fresh. Will come back again!"}
{"text":"Yummy healthy food! Can't go wrong! They also have a super affordable, generous kids menu!"}
{"text":"I've been going to this pita jungle for years.  The food is really quite hit or miss.  i think I've had most of the stuff on their menu, here are a few standouts:  the hummus is very good, the shwarma is terrible, the turkey pesto wrap is good, the lentil fetoosh salad is very good, the club wrap is bad, the lavosh pizza is good, and the glazed chicken lavosh pizza is really very unique and tasty.  I'm giving Pita Jungle three stars only because of their service.  The service is not really terrible, I just find it annoying that the servers and the larger restaurant for that matter don't seem to care about your experience.  After being a patron of Pita Jungle for so long I find it weird that it seems like the restaurant actually tries to hire aloof servers."}
{"text":"I went today with three friends for dinner around 6 PM Sunday night. Though it seemed quite busy, I was pleased to get a seat within two minutes upon arrival. Outside seating, despite a hot Arizona summer, was pretty nice with shade. However, this is where the pleasanties end.  Our table remain neglected for approximately twenty minutes. No one bothered to offer us drinks, and it was quite irritating to see tables who arrived after us being served appetizers. When our waiter came, he did not even apologize for the wait, and we gave our orders: drinks, appetizers, and pita sandwiches.  The hummus and garlic dip came relatively quickly, only twenty minutes later. Both were alright, but something is seriously wrong if all of us were only served one pita with the two dips, and each dip was more than twice the size of the pita. We asked our waiter for extra pita, and he kindly agreed. The entire duration of dinner, it never came.  Refills were also a pain, as we would ask someone to fetch our waiter, and he wouldn't come until ten minutes later.  An hour after ordering could not possibly justify only four meager gyro sandwiches. I've been to plenty of other businesses who have made that kind of order and more in just ten minutes during a busy lunch hour. Half the tables outside already left, including tables that arrived after us, and we were the last ones served. The food was of average quality, and I've been to better with cheaper prices.  Slightly expensive, I can see as justified. But many agree that time is worth much more than money. I had an excessive amount, over an hour and a half, wasted on a decellerating Sunday night. Staff is kind of nice, but I suggest a serious change in priorities so that first time customers like myself aren't immediately turned off. I can say for certain that I'm never coming here again, and I'll find myself at better places much closer to home."}
{"text":"Had lunch at this location the day before Thanksgiving. We sat on the patio and both the lunch and the service were awesome. Our food came out very fast and it was very good. Have eaten here a couple of times before, it was good but nothing great, this time it was definitely above average!  Would recommend for those who have family in town or want to sit out on a patio while our weather is fantastic"}
{"text":"I really enjoy the Jungle.  It is a great place, and the food is almost always spot on.  I took one star off because more than a couple of times,  the service was not the best.  I recommend the lavosh shawarma wrap and greek salad.  Yum!"}
{"text":"My wife and I had eaten at  different PJ location several years back, and did not enjoy it. We decided to give it another try this past week. Unfortunately, our experience was no better this time around. We both absolutely LOVE gyros, and have eaten hundreds in our lifetimes.  In all honesty, the gyros here look and taste like they came out of a box.  For some reason, this chain has decided not to use the good ol' tried-and-true gyro meat roasting on a spit that is served by almost every other Greek-ish place (I verified this with the server). The meat here is dry, bland and has the consistency of a sponge. Please see some of my other reviews for places that know how to make a proper gyro. The hummus appetizer was also not to our liking; it was far too runny. The place was packed on the Friday we were there. They must be doing something right, I just can't figure out what it is.  On the positive side, our server was very friendly and efficient and seemed to enjoy what she was doing. Will not return."}
{"text":"Great service every time, no matter how busy.    Great beer on tap.  Great food and food specials.  Beautiful women.  What's not to like?"}
{"text":"We went to the Jungle yesterday and we've never been there before. Tried going there with our two young kids. My youngest ate off our plates because he showed a great disdain for their kids' meal. Not sure why a bland Mahi Mahi is an option for kids. Well, we ordered it so I guess we had to pay for it although he didn't eat any of it. Maybe making some concessions in that regards to customers should be made in future cases for them. I'd probably go back and eat but without the kids."}
{"text":"The lentil soup is pretty tasty. The chicken shawarma was not bad. The garlic potatoes and ice chai latte can either be a hit or miss."}
{"text":"I ordered using ubereats, and while the food was pretty good, they forgot to give me utensils and napkins. I had to walk around my hotel to find both I could use to eat. I included in my \"additional notes\" section on ubereats for napkins and utensils to be included as well, so that was a bummer when it wasn't. I got the cilantro jalape√±o hummus, Mediterranean chicken salad, and the garlic new potatoes side. Everything was great except for the potatoes--a little on the bland side."}
{"text":"Wow -- cheap, delicious, OK service, and upscale Arcadia vibe inside.   I'm sold.   I'm aware of the complaints of the Tempe location, so I'm on guard.  Although it's newly opened, I will def. go back to try out some more.   *Cheap* Dinner for two with an appetizer and drinks was $22.   *Delicious* The food was was great.  Cilantro jalapeno hummus?  OMG.  I'm starting to DROOL just thinking about it again!!  Tangy and zesty, but not spicy enough for you wimps out there.  And with grilled chicken and pine nuts?!?  Yum.  Beef and shawarma gyros were dependable and good.   Lots of other choices I want to try next time, esp.  the wraps, veggie burgers, pizza and spicy mango shrimp.    *OK service* This one I will let slide since it is only their second week.  Service was kind of sketchy.   It was crowded and we were told in despair by the host to pick our own table in some kind of confused blather.  Our server was cute and attentive, and quick.  She easily accomodated a change in our order.  It took a while to get place settings and menu, because, well, we were told to seat ourselves and our server wasn't aware of this.  Hopefully the confusion will be corrected over time.  *Upscale hip Arcadia vibe* Gorgeous gigantic dark-wood mirror frames the back wall of the strip mall joint.   Open layout , with full length windows and small sleek dark-wood tables throughout with a handful of patio tables out front.  Clientele of talkative (borderline loud) 30-something singles (some w. young kids) reflects the neighborhood.  A bit more polished than the Tempe location, but still OK to dress casual."}
{"text":"Maybe I'm not ordering the right thing?  I've been here twice and both times I've walked away thinking, \"I've had better\". The first time I played it safe and got a gyro.  It was OK. The meat was a bit dry.  I got a side of rice that was so dry I sent it back and got a replacement that wasn't quite as dry.  Service was terrific.  The second time I got the chicken platter and my wife got the Philly cheesesteak gyro.  The chicken was dry, the rice was dry.  The beans were delicious.  The Philly didn't taste like a Philly cheesesteak or a gyro so it confused me.  However, it was good.  Again the service was terrific.  The atmosphere is OK.  It's a bit tight and if it's crowded it can get very noisy.   I'll probably go back if I'm in the area and I don't want to fight for a parking place at Desert Ridge. But, I won't drive out of my way to eat here."}
{"text":"I've come to this location many times for lunch, dinner happy hour and reverse happy hour. I believe you will be able to find something good to eat here. They have a nice patio out in the back and plenty of tables inside. Weekends they have live bands come in to entertain the crowd. \"Do I not entertain you??\" Just kidding.... No Braveheart here but had to throw that in there!!   Anyway, my favorites:  Starters: grilled chicken and hummus. You can have this to dine in or as a good to go order. And you can even have this as an entree because it is that good. You'll have the regular hummus with an olive and a couple cucumber circles.   Featured Specials: Mahi Mahi entree. \"Instead of the Mahi Mahi can I just have one Mahi?\" Sound familiar? Comes on a bed pea sprouts greens, 4 small crunchy paprika looking sprinkled pita chips, and a nice creamy green sauce. Spritz it with lemon. Delicious!   Healthy Burger: chipotle black bean burger. House made black bean burger (made with corn, cranberries, garlic, onion, carrots, oats, variety of peppers) with onions, tomato, pea sprouts, and a side of garlic potato.   Happy Hour: drafts are a couple dollars. White or red Sangria $3. Margaritas, mimosas, martini, cocktails are also on special. Tapas style starters such as falafel, grilled lemon chicken, mussels, hummus and pita are $3 and under. $5.99 for the mix of 3 of the following: chicken slider, beef slider, chicken paco or ribeye paco (pita transformed as the taco shell). Otherwise they are $2.50 each. Happy is from 3-6pm or 9pm to close.   A place to eat, enjoy, and entertain. See you there!"}
{"text":"Pita Jungle, where have you been all my life???....  Grabbed lunch with my Medical Director here the other day, kinda nervous cus you know...it's the MEDICAL DIRECTOR.   They asked if we wanted inside seating, outside seating or first available. I blurted first available and she said she had a table right away. I think the big guy wanted to sit inside cus it was kinda warm outside.  Anyway, I wanted to order the Seared Tuna with Hummas but that was like $10 and his salad was more like $7 so I went with the Hummas with Taboule which was about $7.  Taboule is considered a salad I guess, I was sorta expecting lettuce and whatever but it's actually a bunch of chopped cilantro mixed with onions and lime...?  Then it was piled on top of their AMAZING hummas....OMG.... *drools again just thinking about it*  Served with 2 good sized pita breads, this was a fantastic lunch for me!  I even had enough left overs for dinner. The Taboule was surprisingly delicious and the hummas was orgasmic.  I will definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"Called in an order for the Philly Steak Pita. The peppers and steak were great. Great flavor. What seemed to be missing was the cheese. Unfortunately, 75% of the cheese was stuck to the foil that the Pita was wrapped in. Memo to the staff...use some wax paper next time. This oversight cost you 2 stars."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times.  I have never been super impressed with the food.  It seems a little over-rated to me.  I'd rather go to a family-run authentic Greek restaurant than a chain I guess."}
{"text":"We went to the new location at Dana Park.  We sat outside, which I wasn't thrilled about because it was kinda cold out.  But there were warm heaters that made it enjoyable.  I had the gyro and it was very good.  My friend had the Chicken Tikka Masala and that was excellent.  We also shared the roasted pepper hummus and that was great.  It was super creamy and garlicy.  Staff was great, too."}
{"text":"Worst service I have ever had.  Slow could not get our order in.  Good was ok. I would not come back."}
{"text":"Great Mediterranean Food and a perfect spot for lunch.  This place is crazy during lunch, but it's a big place and it looked like the tables turned pretty quickly.  I opted to get take out and it was ready in about 10 minutes without having to call ahead.  I got a chicken wrap and the hummus which I shall save and continue to consume until it's gone."}
{"text":"Been here a few times. It's very popular.    But I can't figure out exactly why.    Service is slow (although staff very attractive).  Food quality iffy I think.   Not much flavor in the things I've had.   And the place is very noisy when full.   So I'm sorry but am not impressed.    The dishes I've had include marginal hummus with pita not cooked enough, a dry bean burger, and a spicy chicken wrap that was dry and lacked flavor actually."}
{"text":"Why oh why must you cremate the falafel?! Sent back charred crackle only to be replaced by same.., sigh. Last two times seated in front window full of flies and had to move."}
{"text":"I have enjoyed this Pita Jungle location for years.  The food is a 5 Star rated and alway fresh quality.  The problem has been with the wait staff honoring happy hour and having issues with my order of house wine on 3 separate occasions.  1) The first time I was told I had to ask for the happy hour price and was charged full price. I asked for a manger and was told the adjustment could be made. 2) Another time I was told they were out of house wine. 3)  Two weeks later I was told they do not have reverse happy hour on wine any longer and was given a wine list.  Watch out for upsales and check your bill as the errors I found were in their favor.  Review your bill before you pay and don't feel pressured ordering something you don't want.  I enjoy a good full body wine but on these 3 occasions the house table wine was sufficient for my meal."}
{"text":"Four of us went there last night. We had variety of dishes including gyros and vegan items. The service was great and the food was hot and delicious. Our server, Derrick, was awesome.  The domestic beers are priced right. This is tasty stuff folks and not overpriced. There are a lot of places to eat in this neighborhood..... go here! You won't be disappointed. Parking is tight in the area but they validate for you if you park in the University and Ash ramp."}
{"text":"The Gyro Sandwich is Awesome, I drove 10 miles out of my way to have lunch. Staff was great and fast! Special thanks to Ashley."}
{"text":"Pita Jungle is a \"trendy\" middle eastern cuisine eatery.  Not fancy, casual, fast service.  The taboule salad is delicious, the mediterranean chicken salad is huge and very good.  The hummus with grilled chicken appetizer is to die for and the gyros is pretty good too. The prices are reasonable.    It's not very authentic middle eastern food though, especially if you are from a big city east of the Mississippi......were ethnic diversity is what you are used to.  It's got more of a California spin to it.    The tables are very close together, a little too close in my mind.  I do wonder if they put MSG in their food...because EVERY time I eat there, I'm swollen, my rings are tight and I get slits for eyes!!!  But it's short lived and since \"real\" ethnic food are hard to come by in Scottsdale....it's worth it!"}
{"text":"We tried Pita Jungle for the first time. We got a bunch of tapas at the happy hour which was nice to try. One of our orders was a little messed up. We had 2 Portobello Mushroom sandwiches. One was specifically ordered with no bun with a lettuce rap. The order came with both sandwiches made the same way. Had to send back the messed up order. Not a big deal but it is worth mentioning. We will try another location. The food is worth another try."}
{"text":"Really really bad customer service. Won't be back to this location. Ended up leaving because of the rude hostess and rude waiter. Couldn't care less about being so unwelcoming. There are so many great places in Gilbert, don't waste your time or money find somewhere else."}
{"text":"I love to take my son for lunch or dinner there, they have an awesome new kids plate that they use AND they offer fruit which is a healthy addition to any meal.  My son doesn't eat a gyro, but loves the mean, bread and just cucumbers on the side - they always accomodate.  Last visit our food was cold and they had to re-fire it.  I didn't ask to talk to a manager, but he came over and said that he would cover our entire meal.  I offered to pay for half since the food wasn't bad - but we ate the second version, he refused.  Now that's quality services.  ALSO, their Baklava is amazing!"}
{"text":"We like Pita Jungle.  My son loves to get a deconstructed gyro and make his own gyro taco!  If was really good!  I ordered the chicken tikka masala and I love curry.  I would have to say that the dish was a nice concept but when you love Thai and have a Thai meal but with Greek flavored chicken and what tastes like paprika. They didn't go well together for me.  But aside from that, all the tastes separately were really nice.  Chicken was so tender!  Just not working cohesively for me!"}
{"text":"We are huge Pita Jungle fans and have been for the past 10 years. However, tonight we placed a takeout order which included the side order of garlic new potatoes. We got 10 small chunks of potato in our order. I would hardly (actually not at all) call that a side order. More like two large bites. Skimping on orders because it's takeout is a HUGE turnoff and quite a disappointment to a longtime customer."}
{"text":"Came here with a large group and waited about 15-20 minutes for a table of 15. The  hummus with grilled chicken $10 and the mahi mahi with pita chips $11 are my 2 favorite dishes. \"Instead of a mahi mahi, can I get just the mahi?\" Lol anyone recognize this line?  Good for kids because they have a kids fun kit filled with crayons and a fun sheet.  As usual, all pita jungle locations have local art work on the walls for sale."}
{"text":"Been here a couple times for lunch pick up. Outside patio looks inviting to enjoy lunch. Quaint area. And next to a coffee shop!  The second time I decided to get the Chipotle Black Bean Burger. I was in the mood for vegetarian healthy food. Super flavorful black bean patty mixed with onions, garlic, cilantro, corn, bell peppers, carrots, oats, cranberries, jalape√±o peppers, chipotle peppers and a blend of spices on a bun with chipotle hummus, lettuce, pea sprouts, tomatoes.  Paired with cut garlic potatoes.    I'll be back again! :)"}
{"text":"I was so excited that Pita Jungle finally moved out to the suburbs after having to wiggle my way through light rail traffic to visit their Tempe location for years. Finally!! This location does not disappoint. It is beautiful inside, and like the other locations it is fun to see the new art that is displayed each time we visit.  The food is savory and tasteful without being laden with fat and grease, and a welcome note to the chain glutton that is Gilbert. Their chicken is second to none. On most occasions, I order just a side of chicken and some of their salad or pitas with pico de gallo, and it is a perfect meal. They even make nachos semi-healthy and non greasy. They use a variety of mixed beans then add just the right amount of cheese. A must have for those of you who love to sample nachos and believe it should be it's own food group.  Service is pretty good, that is when they write down the order instead of trying to impress you by repeating your order to you then sauntering away to the kitchen. That is almost assured a wrong order fix for later for every restaurant.  My only complaint is sometimes how they prepare your food is not necessarily what is printed on the menu, so if you are particular of a food preparation they will accommodate, just be sure to clarify first. Other than that, fresh tasting food, with a healthful and mouthwatering twist. Wonderful!"}
{"text":"The food here is really just average. There isn't a ton of flavor and the service is average. Typically, I opt for Z's Greek, the Mediterranean fast food restaurant down the block instead. Cheaper and better food."}
{"text":"Great menu and food. The downtown location is my favorite.  The chicken shawarma (spelling?) and grilled vegetables are my fantastic. The moroccan gazpacho is great also."}
{"text":"Had the Mahi Mahi with cilantro /jalape√±o hummus. Was absolutely amazing!! Need to go again soon. The staff was super. Cannot say enough good about this place."}
{"text":"I really enjoy Pita Jungle because it definitely takes this genre of food to the next level. They have the most amazing hummus! Absolutely a MUST try!"}
{"text":"For as many times as I've eaten at and taken out Pita Jungle, I probably should've had every item on the menu by now.  However, their hummus trio and chicken is so DARN good, I order it nearly every single time!!  You can not go wrong choosing Pita Jungle, whether it be for a casual lunch, take out, or a big dinner with friends."}
{"text":"This place never disappoints. The food is amazing, the prices are great and the service is always wonderful. The food is fresh and there are so many awesome options to choose from. I almost always have Kevin as a server and I leave happy every time. He is amazing! I'll be back to see him for sure."}
{"text":"First time at Pita Jungle. I ordered a pita falafel and was disappointed. I had high expectations from this place. The pita bread was cold, stale and overall my pita was flavorless. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"We were seated immediately and the waiter took our order but people coming in after us were served their food before us.   We ordered the pesto pizza and a turkey pita sandwich. I ordered my sandwich with no onion and added avocado. My sandwich came - with onion and no avocado. In addition, the turkey was processed meat. I haven't eaten processed meat in over three years. And, both the sandwich and the pizza were dry. Needless to say, I was sorely disappointed.   The food is overpriced for what you're given. I'll come back if someone else is buying."}
{"text":"Love this place. I have been here numerous times since they opened their doors. My kids love this restaurant too. The added pickles to the gyro is such a nice pop to the wrap. We always order the cilantro hummus with extra pitas. If you're in the mood for a fast, casual lunch come to Pita Jungle. Smoothies are great too. A great idea is to eat here before or after entering Arrowhead Mall. The food is so much better than anything offered inside."}
{"text":"We had some of the worst service I've ever experienced here at lunch.  It took almost 2 hours, and there were other people who came in after us, ate, and then left before we even got our food.  We had to remind our server many times for everything we asked for, and there were no apologies, no communication, and it was maddening.  Why should it take 20 minutes for a hummus plate?  It shouldn't ever take that long to simply spoon it on a plate and serve it.  The food was average at best.  The philly cheese pita had chicken and cheese and that was about it... there were literally 3 slices of green pepper and about 5 onions.  Finally, we ordered Diet Coke, and they served diet pepsi (without letting us know).  We ordered other drinks and they didn't even remove the diet pepsi from the bill.  The only reason I let the quality of food and the diet pepsi on the bill slide was because I knew it would take waaaayyyy too long to wait for a correction.  Steam coming out of my ears after that visit!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious!!!!  Even though wait time can take long (depending on whether you dine in or have take out), the Gyros are delicious, as well as their salad topped with onions, lettuce, and crushed feta. Definite five star!!!!"}
{"text":"Okay, this is probably my favorite Mediterranean Restaurant ever. It seems pretty simple, but the idea plans out and works out so well. The staff are incredibly nice and friendly when you walk in, which I absolutely loved.  I order the gyro, which was absolutely amazing. The meat was so moist and tender, and of course the pitas wouldn't be spectacular if it wasn't in the name! 10/10 absolutely LOVED!"}
{"text":"Was excited to get some Pita Jungle. Drove 15 minutes from our house because website said they were open till 10 pm. Pulled in to parking lot at 8:47 pm to find the employees locking doors and closing shop. The door even said 10:30 am to 10 pm. Very disappointing. Mist likely will not be returning."}
{"text":"Food is good but for some reason the last two times I are here I got sick. I don't know maybe it's just me. Service is a 5 out of 10.  Food is pretty good"}
{"text":"I love pita jungle. The food is amazing and everything tastes so fresh. I have loved everything I have tried there. Only downside is it's super busy nights and weekends. But that's because it's so good. I would hope they would have a happy hour or some kind of promotion for birthdays or something like that. The service is pretty good also. I highly recommend the garlic dip!!"}
{"text":"The seared tuna with cilantro and jalapeno hummus is to die for! I always try to seat outside (unless is too hot), I found the inside to be too dark. Price is good, service is good, food is good, doesn't get better than that!"}
{"text":"Love love love Pita Jungle. Healthier option than most other options in this area without compromising taste. The broiled chicken and jalape√±o cilantro hummus are my weakness. Also the iced green tea is delicious!"}
{"text":"LOVED Pita Jungle. Very Fresh, Very delicious, Very affordable.  We tried the beef gyros, the falafel pita, a kids plate, and a piece of carrot cake.    The Beef Gyro had a pickle on it, which we thought was strange, but it WORKED, YUM!  It was on a nice soft flat bread with beautiful greens topping it.  The Falafel was on a toasted/almost crispy pita and was flavorful as can be.  Also with beautiful greens and a delicious tahini based sauce.  the kids plate was amazing, no blue boxed stuff here...delicious tangy grilled lemon chicken, homemade mac'n'cheese, really green, fresh beautiful broccoli, and a side of fresh fruit with a drink for $4.95  The Carrot cake=moist and delicious, but I probably would leave the caramel sauce off. It actually worked with the cake, but was a little too sweet for my tastes.    The service was a teensy bit slow, but it was very busy today, probably because of the extensive vegetarian list and Ash Wednesday being the day of our vist. But that said, the service was also attentive and friendly.  Decor was fun and funky, very bohemian, so were the staff there.  Loved it."}
{"text":"Long time customer of PJ, love it, usually. This downtown location was absolutely the worst! I usually frequent the one on Bell Rd. but was in the neighborhood and tried this one. The dish I usually order (Chipotle Chicken on Lavosh pizza) and carmalized califlower was brought to our table. First, the pizza...it was super spicy and looked burnt, it tasted so awful that we couldn't even eat it. The cauliflower was undercooked and the sauce was watery. We asked for the bill (we had a coke and ice tea) and without an apology,from them paid for our drinks and left. NEVER AGAIN. The locale at Bell Rd. is awesome and the staff very friendly. Stay away from the downtown one."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with pita jungle.  Great menu options for every eater ( I have taken my vegan parents here) .  I usually get the hummus tri and mozzarella and tomato basil apps.  For main entree I stick with the pesto turkey lavish wrap that comes with a huge sandwich and side Greek salad( I can usually only eat half).  My bf usually gets the salmon plate which comes with bomb garlic smashed potatoes ( that I normally steal) and steamed spinach! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Ive been to several of the locations throughout the valley and this is one of the best ones.  Ive been to one that is not nearly as friendly and overall stingy and this is not the case here.  I'm a garlic lover, unashamedly so... I do have a lot breath mints so have no fear!  I say that because the garlic dip is amazing and has been for years.  A side of chicken wrapped in a pita smothered in the garlic dip is bliss.  Great food and a clean/efficient space."}
{"text":"My least favorite pita jungle location throughout the valley.  I always order garlic dip and extra pita when I eat at pita jungles.  While its as flavorful and great as everywhere else here they are by far the most stingy in the amount they give you.  I once asked during a takeout order why it was so small (i ordered a large like always) and the explanation was \"a large is just supposed to cover the bottom of the container\" and that was exactly what I got.  Imagine taking a paintbrush and spreading it along the bottom so that it appears there is more.  I'm talking millimeters here.  Every single other location gives double what they do here, and when I brought it up I got nothing but attitude.  Wont be visiting this location again."}
{"text":"Poor showing today from PJ. The shaved steak was ultra dry, the seared tuna on hummus was over cooked bad. We had a great Greek salad with chicken.   My wife and I were in Flagstaff and ate at that location 3 times, it was delicious every time.   This location has good staff and a nice mountain view but the food could use a boost."}
{"text":"Another wonderful meal and service. Sitting outside having lunch in the sun. Chicken tikka masala excellent and my fattoush salad big enough to share! And we did not wait long at all for the food to arrive. All worked like clock work! Couldn't resist the cheese cake. Delicious! Ryan, our sever was so attentive and pleasant. I need a loyalty card for this place!"}
{"text":"Pita Jungle never disappoints! They have tasty, yet healthy food for adults and for kids. My favorite is the chicken curry salad and my husband likes the mushroom burger (the mushroom is the patty). My 2 yr old gets choices for protein, starch, veggie and fruit. He went with turkey, brown rice, carrots and fruit. Service was fast and attentive too!"}
{"text":"I get cravings for their curry chicken salad! Its the perfect balance of curry chicken, rice, salad and fried pita chips. I usually like to try different foods at different restaurants, but this is one of those places where I have a favorite and I get it each time. I haven't tried too many other foods here, but I do like their differnet hummus and salads. Service is consistent and its a kid-friendly spot which is a plus for us."}
{"text":"Sam was our server today for lunch, she was an example of what every server should strive to be. Knowledgeable, friendly, and patient. I wanted to adopt her. Keep hiring people like Sam and I will continue to come back!!"}
{"text":"I've had my share of issues with Pita Jungle, but not at this location.   The staff are very friendly, location is amazing, food is good, and consistent.  My wife and I come here on the weekend normally 3-4 times per month.  Did I mention good service?  Every time.    For something light, the fruit Fantasia is amazing."}
{"text":"The staff is extremely friendly and very attentive to your needs.  I love the hummus it was absolutely delicious. The pitas are huge! Great place for a relaxing atmosphere.   They did get my order wrong but fortunately they fixed it in the way I wanted. I ate half of my pita before I realized it didn't have the right toppings but they fixed it and stuffed it this time. The manager has the best customer service I've ever seen!   The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because it is a little slow on getting the food out but it's totally worth the wait.   My boyfriend and I were fighting over the rice pudding. Best I've ever tasted! I would recommend this place to anyone who wants to chill back and have a healthy treat. Oh they do serve alcohol didn't try it though."}
{"text":"Good stuff! Dolmades are A++. The Falafel pita was good. I also ordered lentil soup that they originally ran out of. At the last minute they said they \"found\" some which didn't sound appealing but I was confident I didn't get someone's left overs. The only thing I didn't like is I got a single slice of pita with the soup, only it looked like maybe there should have been 4 slices but was missing the other 3. You know, a round pita cut into 4 slices. Hopefully it only came with one old cooked pita... I wouldn't say this turned me off enough not to visit again - was just an odd instance. Anyway, good stuff, good people, good food!!"}
{"text":"Right from the beginning this place was on the mark. From the atmosphere, to the server, to the food,  each in itself was a pleasant experience.  We started off with two appetizers, the three hummus  and the babaganoush.   Both served with pita. All spreads were fresh and tasty.  For the main coarse we all ordered the salads.  The portions were massive and beautifully plated. Service attentive, friendly, and never rushed us out.  Our drinks were constantly refilled and as we asked for the bill , a fresh cup of our drink to go was given.  Will return and most definitely more than once."}
{"text":"By far one of our favorite restaurants. It is consistently good with so many options. The menu is big and I've never had something I didn't like! Their hummus is so delicious and their garlic dip is amazing. They also give you huge to go cups of whatever you're drinking! The iced tea- any flavor is so good. I think the prices are very reasonable as well. Great happy hour as well! My go to is the Mediterranean roasted Chicken shawarma as a bowl with brown rice."}
{"text":"Pita is my go-to place for phenomenal food and great service.  Some of my favorites are the Philly Chicken or steak, the Tabouleh with chicken, and any of the lavosh pizzas.  They continue to evolve, bringing great new dishes and beverages, while consistently maintaining great customer service.  This particular Pita has such a cool vibe.  Really enjoyed it.  Staff always super friendly.  That's all I can ask for when looking for a favorite place.  Thanks!"}
{"text":"This is a very consistent, and solid place to eat. I love their gyros, and I think they have some of the best hummus I've had to date! The roasted red bell pepper is by far my favorite. Try the one on Mill Ave!"}
{"text":"Came here for family dinner before a movie on a Sunday evening.  We were seated almost immediately and ordered drinks and an appetizer (6:20pm).  Both came out very quickly.  Despite the kids drinks being wrong, we rolled with it.    We finally got to place our order at 6:53pm.  Service suuuuucks.  I love the food at PJ but the service here blows."}
{"text":"Friendly and assertive staff with high-quality healthy food fantastic!  Will continue to support Pita Jungle business model for years to come! Beautiful job on the new build-out of your Shea location"}
{"text":"Bartender was friendly.We were traveling through and she was nice enough to give us  suggestions on local as well as tucson area. The food was pretty tasty for a good price. I think the falafel pita was $7 and  came with potato garlic wedges.   I'd go again and when coming through tucson"}
{"text":"It is nice to eat where they are happy to accommodate requests.  I made a comment about the \"exploding\" spicy chicken pita and the waitress told me how to order it to avoid the problem.  My wife and our server then had a nice two minute conversation about how things migrate from the specials menu to the main menu.  One negative, the place is crazy nosy!  They need some sound deadening.  Back to the positive: The service is good, food is tasty and it is served hot.  I like it."}
{"text":"The coconut curry soup is just..... Beyond belief... That's all... That's it!! Just stuff it in your face and b happy!! The lentil salad... Delish... The chicken w/green hummus, the falafel... On and on... Just go, b happy, thank me later..."}
{"text":"I loves me some pita jungle! This new location is fast and delicious just like their other ones. Consistently good food and service."}
{"text":"Good place to stop for a healthy meal! Service was good, hummus was good, and the pizza was okay.  Not my favorite type of pizza, but I was sharing a meal and everyone else enjoyed it.  They have great Pitas and a small, but good, selection of beer on tap. Worth stopping in if you are in the area for lunch or dinner!"}
{"text":"Yes it was lunchtime when I placed a to go order. But she advised me to pick up in 20 minutes. I get there 20 min later and waited an additional 15. They were very busy should of given a realistic timeframe. After waiting, no apology nothing. Poor service. Staff more during busy periods.  After my review I was contacted by Pits Jungle and now feel confident they will work to improve their service. Their food is great, their service should be too."}
{"text":"Great healthy option for eating out. We love to get the hummus sampler because we like them all! My favorite entr√©e is the spicy chicken pita, yummo.  We have always had good service and fresh, consistent food.  Gotta love the location for us inhabitants of Gilbert,  too."}
{"text":"To be fair, I've only been here after 9pm midweek during happy hour. I get stuck at work late. Really late. I'm seriously craving a gyro or baba but no one is open past 9pm except Pita jungle! Then, I get inside and can't make up my mind what I want. Hummus? Feta? Pita w/olive oil and spices? Oh wait, it's happy hour! I'll have tapas! One of each for $1-$2 per piece! Oh, margaritas are $2 during happy hour? Don't mind if I do! For $10 I have my fill of food with a margaritas to boot, getting a taste of everything and trying something new, and I'm in bed by 10:30pm. With the money I saved on the meal, I generously tip my server and everyone goes home happy.  I have never had anything bad here. Some things are mediocre, but for the price I can't and won't complain. The staff has always been friendly and attentive. The first few times I asked the server for recommendations and they were all as described and exactly what I was hoping they would be."}
{"text":"Well I really expected this place to be really good..  We went in very hungry. Their ice tea was really good.  My daughter and I ordered the blue corn nachos to start.  They were ok but pretty bland.  I got the gyro which comes with nothing. I had to ask for sauce.  Both were very plain not much flavor.  I also found the pickles on it to be strange. My daughter got the Philly steak pita which she thought was very plain and really didn't like at all.  It was pretty soggy and drippy. The lady next to us sent her salad back for some reason I didn't hear.  I heard her order it with dressing on the side but had it on it when it came out the second time.  The guy 2 tables away also sent his back because it had cheese on it and he ordered it without. After that all I heard was the kitchen prepping for later. They were chopping vegetables very loudly for the rest of the time we were there. Between that and the music I left with a headache. My daughters comment on the music was she was pretty sure the same song has been playing the whole time we were there. I don't think we will be back."}
{"text":"Their takeout is unbeatable! I ordered a salad and it was ready in 5 minutes! I've never had to wait longer than 15 minutes for anything I've ordered including appetizers and entrees. Enduring is light and tasty. Eating here is always a great choice!"}
{"text":"Love love love the food here. Great prices. Service is alright. But I don't go here for that. I go here for the awesome food."}
{"text":"I'm addicted. Been eating healthy and pita jungle is where to go! Such amazing food and great service. Prices are good, but can't stop eating here! Try the chicken pasta salad!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a healthier alternative in Desert Ridge, Pita Jungle is definitely your place.  They have a lot of great options - I recently had the Spicy Chicken Pita which was awesome.  3 stars is due to the service - over the last few months, it is truly hit or miss.  Sometimes you get a great server while other times you only see them for the drink & food order, and then to give you your bill."}
{"text":"Food was good but disappointed in lack of gluten free bread.  Left with few options which were salads or sandwiches wrapped in lettuce."}
{"text":"I live right across the street. Been coming here for 4-5 months now. This pita jungle is the best in the state in my opinion. Service is awesome, the location is awesome. The food is just as good if not better than any other location.   Sky is a great waitress, so is Janice, and Phoebe, those are my go to servers/waitresses! Sometimes I'll get a togo, or i'll just have a beer and eat in.   I've met some very cool people from the neighborhood just eating here and sparking up some conversations."}
{"text":"I just found out from the duke that this was a local est. I feel like an idiot. Every time I go into this joint I get a good vibe all around whether its' from customers and employee's. Awesome hapy  hours. normal and reverse  hours, I dig the patio layout and I am sucker for em' too. The food is delightful  I always  enjoy trying out the vegan/mediterrenean style dishes. . Also another plus is they serve alcohol! No local micro brews :P...I think."}
{"text":"This is a great location for Pita Jungle.  I love the fact that there's a comfortable outside patio.  Service was fast, and the menu is great, like all the pita jungles in the valley.    I got the black bean burger, which was delicious, but hard to eat since it was loosely packed.  Next time, I'll get a real burger.    Their food is always great, refreshing and well presented."}
{"text":"I really do enjoy this place (: i will keep it pretty simple. I always get some chicken shwarma-warmanarma whatever the kitchy name is, basically, i order grilled chicken, tomatoe, and lettuce in a pita. Always comes out warm & fresh. I find it very good, the chicken (for my taste) does not need fancy sauces. Although, since i nix many of the other items that it comes with, i do feel sliightly overcharged, however, i reaize i have 'customized' their menu. P: the inside is clean, the servers are nice. I cannot complain, they do their job. I reccomend this place for a nice lunch, early dinner. We have frequented this place after weightlifting seshs."}
{"text":"Great location for catching up with my best friend! Dinner time was Not too busy or loud we got all our catching up done! The cilantro jalape√±o hummus is to die for! Sometimes I come here just for that! Our server Rockie was great and kept my water full!!"}
{"text":"I was highly disappointed with this stay on Thursday night. The restaurant was fairly busy, but that was not the issue. My husband and I sat down and waited for roughly 15 minutes before we even got menus and acknowledged. My husband had to flag someone down to let them know we have not even been waited on. When the waitress (I can't remember her name) finally came up and said this isn't my table but I will start your order. We never once got an apology for the wait and in addition no refills on drinks or anything. I was definitely disappointed with this stay as we visit the location quite frequently.  This service here was usually a 5 star but this time not at all up to standard."}
{"text":"What a letdown. I've been to the Pita Jungle on Indian School, which was alright, and the one in Tempe, which was really awesome with excellent food and quirky servers...and then there's this one. I guess I shouldn't have built it up so much for my friend, because it was really an awful experience.  Our server (Kimberly, I believe her name was), was horrid and unfriendly, speaking to us like we were beneath her-I'm assuming because my friend is clearly butch and didn't fit into this gal's ideal clientele. She was extremely unhelpful. We ordered appetizers and wraps--chicken shawarma for me, gyro for my friend. The server made it clear she couldn't wait for us to leave. She offered us to go boxes within ten minutes of receiving our food. It was shocking for me. I don't get a lot of snooty attitude because I'm feminine and the only thing out of the ordinary is the fact that I sometimes walk with a cane. Maggie and I took a moment to regroup, focus on the food, and not the nasty demeanor of our waitress. We weren't going to let it get in the way of a good meal.  Except it wasn't. I don't know what kind of shawarma they were serving that day, but it wasn't the Pita Jungle deliciousness I'm accustomed to. It tasted more like fast food than an awesome Middle Eastern dish. The cilantro jalapeno hummus was okay, but the pita was hard. The cucumber slices were tasty and fresh, and the Purple Haze beer we shared was good. The lettuce in Maggie's gyro was wilted and gross. She picked that out, but the gyro was still sub par. I tried it myself, and it was meh, too.  I will say that the guy who ran the food from the kitchen to the table was super friendly, and the other waiter seemed alright. But as far as this place goes, between the hateful waitress and the mediocre food, I was really disappointed. I thought Pita Jungle was better than this."}
{"text":"Had the salmon salad, oh boy was it fantastic!!! The honey sesame dressing as a substitute was perfect!! My date had the yellowfin tuna sesame salad, seared perfect!! I'm not a big health food person, but this place was awesome!!! Don't hesitate to try it please!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious food that is much healthier than your average restaurant.  We love their green tea and Chicken Tikka Masala."}
{"text":"Pita Jungle is by far my favorite restaurant in the Valley. I Love the atmosphere at this location and the servers are always friendly. With that being said, nearly every time my family and I have been here, (at least once a week) the server we have isn't very attentive. The only time we really see our waiter/tres is when we order and receive our food. Any time in between that, they pretty much peace out. We do continue to come back though because the food is always amazing and even though the service is not always the best, it's the friendly smile on their face that counts!"}
{"text":"Joshua took the order for our table of nine by memory.  I love that. This location has a pretty small indoor area and a large outdoor space.  Sunset can be a little brutal for half the folks at the table, but its great outside when the sun goes down.  Pita Jungle is always a good choice when  you have a mixed party of vegans and carnivores.  The service was good and everyone seemed to enjoy their meal.  Easy choice for a group!"}
{"text":"There's nothing more pleasant than being a vegetarian, ordering a veggie pita from work for pickup, getting back to the office and having a turkey filled pita in your hands. Starving I picked out all the meat and ate the veggies. The veggies were delightful, but definitely not enough for a meal. I wish that they definitely got it right the first time. The guy who took the order was busy, which having worked in the restaurant business for over 10 years I understand, but he could not hang up any faster. And there is nothing worse than being ready to enjoy a nice lunch, and then realizing that it could not be eaten all due to someone not listening to the customer. It's all in the details- you should repeat the order when it is taken the first time, and as it is given/served to the customer."}
{"text":"I'm am an avid visitor of pita jungle. I live in phoenix and would go all the way to the tempe one several times per month. Now I am five minutes away and I love it. I had the honey glazed chicken lavosh pizza and it was amazing. The one in historic phoenix is urban, modern and the diverse crowd there is welcoming to all.  Whenever we are trying to decide where to go eat pita is always first choice.  Pita jungle is and will always be my favorite place to eat."}
{"text":"I was just having a discussion about top 5 places to eat in the Phoenix area with my friends. Many of their answers were fancy, expensive, date type places. Mine top choice was Pita Jungle.   Every time I am here, the food tastes fresh and made with love. The lavoshes are very tasty.   But my favorite orders are the grilled chicken and hummus or the Mediterranean chicken salad. Both delectable!!!!"}
{"text":"The place is clean and the ambience is great with some real cool artwork!:) I tried lamb gyro and liked it. Sangria was good but not too great."}
{"text":"so... I hate to be the scumbag rating with one star but...  I will paint this picture for you: Our server at the 2nd time we tried ....  beater tank top, disgusting armpits learning over our table.... yum yum.  NOT.   My first experience with this place was last June in Flagstaff, AZ.  There were 4 of us....  2 of us are from the restaurant industry so we get it.....We were sat, and we sat there for 15 minutes.  Not one person came by to get a beverage order or anything.  The group of servers where standing at the bar drinking their beverages and showing each other stuff on their phones...   We flagged one of them over, he literally rolled his eyes, and looked over at one of the other servers and pointed at us.  still nothing.... so we left.    so, I am back in Phoenix this week ....  I am a vegetarian... sounded like a good idea, same friend I am with, we decide to give them another try.   yea, pretty much the same thing....  we kept having to flag our server down, we had to ask for our appetizers as our lunches came out first ... and he gives us some bullcrap story about how pita bread takes forever to warm up.  uh ok.  whatever.  So, I am never going back, I tried twice.  At least the 2nd time I got to eat, the food was good.  But really I can't stand watching servers in restaurants drinking their beverages, watching the game and playing with their phones.....  Bummer."}
{"text":"I definitely enjoyed my experience here. Large variety of food, lots of vegan options. I had chicken schwarma which was great!"}
{"text":"A great place to get your healthy food fix. Nice variety on the menu with vegan options."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. Staff is friendly, restaurant is clean & it's always hopping. I go as often as I can & order the gazpacho. What I love is that it's always a hair different each time I order it. That tells me it's always fresh and and is at the whim of the chef that day. One time it had watermelon in it. My only gripe is that they don't carry this soup year round.  I don't think it's popular because people hear cold soup & assume it's not great. But it is. It comes w/ two pita triangles that have been fried. yum Lg order is $5  Btw, I'm on a one woman campaign to get it year round."}
{"text":"I truly enjoy Pita Jungle but this experience was sad. I take clients for business meetings since it's fast, consistent (usually) and perfectly priced. This time our server walked up to the table and without a greeting \"what do you want to drink\" then we order food and mine arrives cold. I tell him and he says, \"we will warm it Up\" then the next one comes, cold. It's the same gyro bowl I get every time I come. Since I'm in a meeting, I just say, \"sorry to be a pain but it's cold again, I'll just eat my soup\" he says \"ok\" and takes it away. When my client left I asked to speak to the manager, Jeremy. He could have cared less as well, clearly the service is a reflection of the management. Instead of anything apologetic, it was \"ya we should change that dish because we get a lot of complaints about it being cold\" I explained to him I eat it all the time and he was surprised. I explained about the service and he says \"I'll talk to him, sorry for your experience\" and walks away. Definitely won't be back"}
{"text":"I think this place has great food.  It is tasty and filling.  I order take out a coupke timea a month.  Everything is fresh and seems healthy."}
{"text":"I have been told by many friends and family to try pita jungle since I love that style of food. After my first visit I am surprised I haven't tried it sooner. Aside from the magnificent entree I was recommended by the lovely young lady Tiffany, the atmosphere and service deserves more praise. A very hard to find and highly sought after hospitality are what molded my experience into perfection. Tiffany exemplified knowledge of the product as well as contagious happiness and the feeling of comfortness. Unfortunately for me this location is not close to home however the locals will enjoy her customer service. Thank you Tiffany for making my visit a pleasant one."}
{"text":"My husband and I went on a Wednesday evening and everything was spot on for us.  It was busy, but we didn't have to wait for a table,  Our food was fantastic and our server went above and beyond helping us with our menu selections. We're so happy Pita Jungle has opened a location so close to where we live and can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Love Pita Jungle food and service.  Hate the restrooms.  What is with this trend in having restrooms so dark you can't tell if the previous occupant left anything on the toilet seat? I should at least be able to tell if I have spinach between my teeth and refresh my lipstick.   Obviously managed by men.  Buy some lightbulbs for goodness sake!"}
{"text":"We went for dinner today.ambience is ok.food is also ok.but I personally didn't like my chicken pasta.it was nothing but grilled chicken on top of cold pasta without any sauce or flavor."}
{"text":"I don't understand why the Yelp price rating for Pita Jungle is \"$$\". The most expensive item $14.59 and nearly everything else is under $10. The price rating should be \"$\".  Big eaters, rejoice; not such big eaters, be warned:   Pita Jungle serves up plentiful portions for their prices. I got the Chicken Tikki Masala if it wasn't so tasty I would've stopped eating when I hit the half plate mark. The Lavosh Shawarma Wrap was huge - I swear it was stuffed with 40 pieces of chicken. And it came with a hearty salad.  Pita Jungle gets five stars for price, value, and taste. Minus one star because....  -The cleaning staff could be a bit more efficient. About 7 tables were vacated while we were waiting outside but it was about 10 more minutes before anyone was called in. -Boy was it noisy! We had to shout to hear each other. If they were playing background music, it was drowned out."}
{"text":"For reals, this is my new favorite place. I LOVE it. The staff is friendly and the food is great! LOVE their hummus. My friend and I got the hummus trio, garlic dip (hummus?), olives, and feta cheese for happy hour and it was bomb sauce. Then for dinner, we split the pesto pizza and garlic potatoes. SO GOOD! Love love love."}
{"text":"The food is delicious, the location is prime, and the service is good. The guava lemonade is the best lemonade I've ever had, anywhere.  I'm a single person and I eat out alone half the time.  My only complaint is that the last two times I've been here I have been seated in a small table, in between other customers when the restaurant is practically empty. So now, instead of enjoying a quiet bite to eat, I'm forced to listen to conversations on both sides.  When I asked the host to seat me elsewhere, I was told that there's no server for that table/section. I understand that some restaurants give their servers sections instead of a table rotation but that shouldn't negate good customer service."}
{"text":"Second time coming here and this time i ordered the Cilantro hummus with chicken and let me tell you it was awesome! Great tasting food and just down the block from my job. Have tried the cilantro hummus at other places but none as good as Pita jungles! Highly recommend it nice location and great staff you cant beat that."}
{"text":"Like Flies in your food? Ya I didn't think so. That's what I found when I went to this location on Apache Blvd. on 6/27/2013. How disgusting.   Placed an order on the phone, great. Got there, they lost my order, when it was ready I paid, the guy was nice in taking my money. Got back ate some of my Yellowfin Tuna Honey Sesame Salad and discovered the little bastard. I about threw Up. This is SOOO GROSS. I cannot even describe how disgusted and sick I am feeling right now. I cannot believe I spent time, took of work to go get my lunch, so spent gas and discovered the surprise after I got back."}
{"text":"Great service, friendly staff, excellent food!  This location is in the mall so it has a limited menu.  I just wish they had more options from their regular menu---like pizzas and a food happy hour!"}
{"text":"As a Pita Jungle regular, this is my favorite location. The manager is always walking around and asking customers how the service is. The food is always delicious and reasonably priced. I work across the street and come here for lunch at least 3-4 days a week."}
{"text":"The food was amazing the falafel sandwich was great and the hummus was amazing. My wife had the salmon burger and it was also amazing will def be back"}
{"text":"Here for a trip, been addicted to this place and been coming everyday.  Really great food, there's an older semi-blonde guy always up front which I think is the owner, you'd think he'd recognize me since I been coming EVERYDAY, so today I just came in and said \"omg I love this place, I'm addicted!!\" :) with a friendly smile in my face, but he looked at me like he saw a ghost with a blank look in his face, I'll stay positive and won't tell my self he's an asshole, I'll just assume he's got Alzheimer's. I like to frequent places where at least my face is recognized and I get better service for being a regular. But over all place is awesome. :)   I won't be coming here again, he showed me today his good bye greetings are fake and doesn't give fuck about his clients, maybe all just about the money.   Ps I just told the waitress and showed her this review, she chuckled and said haha that's so true!! Adam, he is an asshole. Lol"}
{"text":"Pita Jungle is among the tastiest of the tasty! My personal favs are all manner of Lavosh pizzas, and the chicken combo platter. Be sure to try the cilantro-jalapeno hummus as well. PJ is just enough granola that you feel alternative, but everyone still smells good. It can get crowded on typical dining out evenings/times, and the tables are pretty close together, so not the place to have an intimate conversation, but great for casual dinner/drinks."}
{"text":"Came out to AZ to visit a good friend and she took me here for dinner, deff have to say everything I had was real good; chicken hummus wrap. All on point, well seasoned, good atmosphere and good service over all and the portion size was more then enough. If I'm ever back in Tempe inwould deff go back here for lunch or dinner"}
{"text":"I hope someone else writes a review about this because 'I swear I am not making this up.'  I normally like the pita jungles I have been to (Mesa, Gilbert), and I have had 1 good experience at this Chandler location.  However, today I had lunch with a friend and we sat on the normally quite pleasant pation. Now maybe you won't believe this, but midway through lunch 2 men working on the patio started a chain saw fewer than 12 feet away from us.  Okay, it stopped after about a minute, only to be followed by more chain saw noise a few moments later.  This was followed by an electric sander and pounding.   Please understand that this was not at 3AM or 9PM or some awkward time.  This was at 1:45 lunch time.    We cut our lunch short and decided to leave.  But before leaving we contacted the manager and complained about the noise.  His reaction?  Well, I can't control that.  Corporate sent the crew out and I have nothing to say about when they work.  And the hostess should have asked how everything was.  And then, 'we had to do the work because someone got hit by the post that was there...' and on and on.  This manager blamed everyone else for the problem--the hostess, corporate, and even insinuated it was our fault for not saying something.  Well, sir, you are the manager and the buck stops with you.   You could have at least approached the tables that were out there and offered to reseat customers inside the restaurant.   And as to your claim that you were not aware that customers were being disturbed?   Really.   IT WAS A CHAINSAW.   It made a noise!   It made A LOT of noise!   Noise that was followed by sanding and pounding.  You sir, need to be re-educated.  Get a clue about how to handle odd situations --of which I am sure there will be more.  And, learn how to say, \"I am sorry for the inconvenience.  I understand how frustrating that must have been.\" As it is, I found your response unbelievably inadequate."}
{"text":"Wow... loved everything about this place. Went during happy hour and tried several small plates.  Not a big hummus fan...well I wasn't till I tried the treo.... I'll be back."}
{"text":"The food is good! The pita's are a little harder then other Greek places, I really like the mahi mahi with chips! the hummus is very good. this location in particular is really slow. If you order to pick up give your self some time to wait."}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant three times. Each time I get the same thing: Red Quinoa Salad over Cilantro Jalape√±o Hummus. It's really good. Today though, the arugula was dead/yellow/lifeless and the salad was SATURATED with the vinaigrette dressing. Almost inedible. As a note to the kitchen: please make an effort to be consistent. Quality control! With that said I have to mention the kids meals are awesome. Great big portions and healthy.  I will come back. I spotted some other amazing dishes at nearby tables. I'll have to change it up next time!"}
{"text":"Words cannot describe our love for Pita Jungle. We've been eating here for nearly 12 years. To the point where my husband stopped asking (\"Where do you wanna get lunch?\")  When we moved to Houston for 6 years - we missed our weekly Pita stop so much!! Nothing compares.   Our highlights of the menu: - Chicken with (red and green) hummus (sub out chicken for gyro meat and you'll thank me)  - Gyro (the best ever!!) - Broiled chicken salad. The lemon dressing is to die for.  - Gambas con ajo, shrimp in a zesty tomato garlic sauce with cheesy pesto Pita's. Yum!!  And don't forget the berry tea!!   Although the service is really hit or miss. We can usually skate out of our meal for less than $26 and it's delicious!!!!!"}
{"text":"We were frequent visitors to Pita Jungle in Glendale. Great food, great service, great management. We have since moved to Scottsdale and have been to this location twice, and sadly both visit have been awful. After our visit tonight, we will not be back. The restaurant was not busy but we waited a few minutes to be seated. We started out being greeted by our server fairly quickly and got our drinks right away. After that it went downhill. We waited almost ten minutes for our order to be taken. When our waiter did come he said he was held up on the patio, but we saw him the whole time standing in the kitchen. Hmm. We ordered tapas and our meal assuming we would get the tapas first. We did not. Everything came out at once. After our food was dropped off, we realized we did not have silverware or napkins, and with no one in sight, I had to go to the kitchen area and ask for silverware. I was told they would bring us some extra napkins, which of course no one ever did. We then needed refills on our tea and had to flag down a waiter at a different table who was refilling his customers drinks to do ours as well. Our waiter never came back to check on us. A manager told away our dishes and we finally had to request our check. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"** Thank you Pita Jungle for getting back to me:)  They completely went above and beyond to make it right.  I will surely be returning!   I am so irritated with the customer service for Pita Jungle.  We ordered take out one night, and when we got back they put the wrong hummus in the bag.  One of my favorite parts of Pita Jungle is the cilantro hummus.  I emailed to see if we could get a voucher or something for the hummus and nobody responded.  I know it is a small request and it may seem petty, but it is the principal.  I could have gone back in, but we were busy!  Knowing they are blowing me off kind of makes me never want to go back.   I am not a fan of Pita Jungle right now.  A small email would have made it right."}
{"text":"I cannot imagine my life without Pita Jungle.   We generally order take-out.   So easy and so friendly and efficient.  (parking always is a pain at the 44th plaza, especially on weekday lunch hour.   I love the pita pizza, the shwarma, salads, and chicken pasta.  HUmmus is really addicting.  I also love that no matter how many ways you custom order your choice, Pita Jungle accomodates without any attitude.  How rare and great is that? Always clean, consistent and never a bad experience."}
{"text":"Always good to go to the pita jungle! If you are near here one day just drop on in.. They have good big salads and amazing green tea. The jalape√±o hummus is the perfect blend to."}
{"text":"Food is fantastic.  Grilled cauliflower with tahini - who knew? Grilled vegetable salad- big and delicious! All of the hummus varieties- unbelievable. I would eat here every day if I could. Actually, I would go to the Pita Jungle Happy Hour every day if I didn't have to battle/monitor teenage daughters at home. The tapas menu is ridiculously cheap and good.  Throw in a few glasses of decent Happy Hour wine, and there's no reason to go anywhere else. The service is always good, and I recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"i really didnt expect the setup inside when i walked in. instead of a 'get in and get out' type joint, i found a pretty nice, casual sit down restaurant with an attempt at a lounge/bar area. not bad.   the menu was extensive and offered a variety of vegetarian options (i'm a meat girl so i went for the gyro). service was fast and friendly. not a bad place to go for lunch, but if you want to take out i suggest calling ahead first and putting your order in."}
{"text":"I love Pita Jungle every time I eat here the food is fresh and fantastic.  I do however have to give 3 stars much to my dismay EVERY time I sit down to eat the service sucks.  It's usually slow and the last waitress we had kept forgetting to refill drinks and that's just annoying.  I have no beef with the chef but they need to upgrade the service one more star for me.  Don't just do the minimum, please!"}
{"text":"My wife dragged me into Pita Jungle. I got to admit I was not really interested in eating at Pita Jungle. However, I made my wife happy & agreed to eat there. I ordered the Philly Cheese Steak. Wow, it was amazing I was shocked by how good it was. The Hummus & Chicken was delicious as well. Glad my wife dragged me into Pita Jungle."}
{"text":"Everything we had was amazing!!! Had a second great meal here in their Flagstaff location. Heading back to Sedona from Grand Canyon, thought we'd yelp a restaurant in flagstaff on the way. When we saw pita jungle listed and verified they were related to the Scottsdale location which we raved about, that's what everyone wanted! Another great meal, wide variety, no item disappointed!"}
{"text":"Great food. The tomato mozzarella basil salad was great. The tomatoes were so juicy. The shrimp appetizer with pesto pita  was awesome. I loved the wood fired grilled chicken breast. So garlic and lemony. Great service and affordable."}
{"text":"Top notch and always fresh. Beat hummus and best spanakopita in town. Amazingly large patio great for the good weather seasons. Awesome craft beer selection. All in all, a very tasty and very healthy way to go. If you do hummus, add grilled chicken or steak, and for a not so healthy twist, add the pita chips. Oh yeah!!"}
{"text":"We opted to share the Mediterranean Chicken Salad and the Jalepe√±o Cilantro Hummus. More than enough for us to share. We could probably eat here every day of the week. No really, we could!"}
{"text":"Great visits every time.  Great tasty menu.  Many vegan and vegetarian options.  Wheat pitas are vegan, regular are not."}
{"text":"So, I have to admit that I once threw up in the Pita Jungle bathroom, but it was not Pita Jungle's fault - it was definitely something I ate the night before.  It certainly made for a memorable first date experience with my now husband, and we have been back many many times.  Oh, how I love Pita Jungle.  I haven't tried anything that I wouldn't have again in a heartbeat - currently I am hooked on the Potato Pizza.  yummy!  Their breakfast options are wonderful - definitely try it on a lazy Sunday morning.  There is usually no wait.  The ambiance is fantastic, casual and arty, with a little bit of crunchy granola thrown in.  A++ for vegetarians and meat-eaters alike.    Eat hummus and pita.  Try falafel.  Try anything on the menu, because it is all good."}
{"text":"Awesome food...very accommodating!! I'm new to the area and I felt so welcomed by Christian. He made my favorite little cocktail of Tito's n sparkling water with a lime. I can't wait to bring my family and friends here...Awesome place!!"}
{"text":"This place is good for a quick and simple meal whether it be lunch or dinner.  The place is frequented by \"health conscious\" people who eat lots of salads and live on hummus.  So finding me in this place when I'm a meat eater, is rare.  However, when I do get in, I enjoy their beef gyro and jalapeno hummus with pita.    Their gyro is of course not the authentic Greek kind, where it's vertically roasted on a spit and then shaved thinly just before serving.  It's the \"processed\" or the pressed kind where it's thicker cut and dryer.  They do serve it with the tzatziki sauce, but they put their own American twist to it and put pickles in it!  I know, it's atrocious, but actually tastes ok once you accept that you're sitting in Pita Jungle, not in some amazing hole-in-the-wall restaurant in Rhodes or Athens.  The servers here always crack me up.  Some are friendly, but most look like they don't want to be there.  They're dressed hippyish and that's their style I guess to fit the restaurant's vibe.  The place always reminds me of Berkeley, California except the food there's much better.    Overall an ok place if you're hungry and don't have the time to go out to a real dinner."}
{"text":"Top notch, fresh Mediterranean food. You cannot go wrong. Don't hesitate to take on an adventurous food experience at Pita Jungle! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Pita-riffic!!  Okay cheesy, I know, but this place needs to expand their franchise to Southern California. I can't wait to go back the next time I am in town...  The food here is fresh. Everything on the menu is healthy, and they have a HUGE selection of pita's, salads, gyro's, oven baked pizza's and even a section of healthy burgers.   Everyone at my table ordered something different so we could share. The beef gyro was my favorite.  It was overstuffed with tender beef and veggies. The Vegie burger was delish, adorned with a huge grilled red pepper, and garlic potatoes.    The Swharma was excellent, as was the hot pita bread and hummus.   The six of us had great service, and our waiter never missed a beat. He refilled our drinks without us asking, and promptly attended to our every request.   I would easily head here for lunch or dinner. The decor is modern, contemporary with a hipster/fresh vibe.  They have tables in side, a small bar area, and a huge patio out front.   I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"go during happy hour or you are not getting a deal the food is a-okay. But not a place I would ever \"crave\" basic greek and pita food nothing crazy.. WHAT I DO LOVE ABOUT THIS PLACE IS  THE DECOR."}
{"text":"This was my first time to Jungle Pita. The food was very good and moderately priced for the large portion you get. Good experience and friendly staff. The only thing was that we felt rushed near the end of our lunch. There were people waiting to eat but we didn't need to feel the pressure to finish. (We were in and out in less than hour which is very typical for lunch in my opinion. We were not loitering for hours)."}
{"text":"Gotta love Pita Jungle, they are sprouting up all over the valley and for good reason the food is hard to beat.  The food is delicious and they give you plenty of it.  Standouts are: -Lavash pizzas (i know pizza at Mediterranean place? but trust me this is the best thing on the menu) Glazed chicken or the chipotle are a must, crispy crust and big ol chunks of chicken. -Hummus is great, red pepper, cilantro/jalapeno and traditional -Gryo, good size portion -Med plate, good sampler platter -Fruit and cheese bowl, good lord this is a bunch of fruit and cheese!  So far nothing has disappointed but its really hard not to get the lavash and hummus every time.  Atmosphere is really laid back, servers especially (definitively can wear what they want). Nice rotating artwork throughout the place that can be purchased.  This location sits next to a little lake so its had a good vibe unless the ducks bug you :-)"}
{"text":"I go here more often than I would normally visit a restaurant.  Mainly, because my girlfriend pretty much has her own table here.  She's a serious fan of this spot.  So, much that she got me take her here on our first date.    So. I've eaten here more often than I want to admit to, and every time the food is delicious.  Surprisingly delicious.  Reading the menu items, I'm usually not impressed, nothing sounds that good.   But every time I try something new.. it's amazing!  I'm working my way through the menu, and haven't found something that I truly disliked.  Their specials are usually pretty awesome in price and quality, and their hummus is something everyone should try.  The only reason they don't get 5 stars... is their service.   I know they're busy, but seriously.  I have only had 1.. that's right, 1 experience with their wait staff that was positive.   Usually, I'm watching my food wait at the counter by the kitchen for one of the servers to realize it's ready.  Other times, I'm trying to melt ice to \"refill\" my own drink.    It seems that some servers are careless, some are rude, and others are just too busy.    Except for the girl with the big glasses..  I don't remember her name but she gets her own 5star review from me."}
{"text":"Happy to report that this location has really done a great job with takeout orders. Much more organized and thorough.   Good food, fast & fresh.   Well done Pita Jungle!"}
{"text":"I ordered Pita Jungle through the Ubereats app and the delivery came in a little under 20 minutes.. impressive. I ordered the California Beach Lavash wrap with chicken and it was legitimately one of the best wraps I have ever had. I also had the cilantro jalapeno hummus and it was also the best hummus I have ever had. I am so glad I ordered delivery and will do so again. Only complaint is that I wish the extra pita bread didn't come wrapped in aluminum foil. Other than that, A++."}
{"text":"Loud place, not somewhere to come for a relaxing lunch. Great healthy food, very fresh. Small Greek salad $6, husband liked the Gyro."}
{"text":"Curry salad delicious...mixed hummus platter delicious...recommend these highly...Pretty much everything is good here."}
{"text":"We usually eat at the desert ridge location but saw a movie at shea 14 we were excited to have dinner so close. I don't know what was going on but our service was terrible and kind of rude and we couldn't get out fast enough."}
{"text":"Flipping awesome.  The hummus cannot be missed - we had a plate that was split plain and roasted red pepper. The pita bread is bomb.  Service was great - they are all very humble and casual (attractive, too) and after describing a dish we had seen there once before but was no longer on the menu, he whipped it up for us no problem.   All in all, you are eating light, healthy, filling, and fresh. What's there not to love? Plus there's a Zen Zen fro-yo next door. Done and done."}
{"text":"This is another outpost of the chain and it was pretty empty on a Friday night. I either keep ordering the wrong food or the place just isn't that good. I used the $25 gift card they gave me for my last bad experience here seven months ago. My order on this date night was one of their Lavosh Pizza's. It was the shrimp and feta concoction The crust was cracker-like, but in fairness the ingredients were fairly fresh. The waitress quickly gave us a new pita when the one we got to dip in our red pepper hummus appetizer was hard as a rock. They should cut the pita in triangles and put it in a warmer before serving. The hummus was decent, but nothing really was too memorable."}
{"text":"I've never been to this shopping center/Pita Jungle location before and I was really pleasantly surprised! The restaurant was large and very bright and clean. There was a big patio out front that looked inviting even with the 100 degree temperatures! The waitresses were attentive and the Roasted Vegetable Salad with Chicken that I had was really good! The next time I am over that way I'll likely stop in again."}
{"text":"The food is great and fresh, with a nice healthy selection. They have awesome vegetarian/vegan options, but also have carcass for the carnivores. The service is always good. My only complaint is the seating isn't super comfy & it's kind of loud in there. We go all of the time & love it, but I wouldn't go if you're looking for an intimate, quiet, romantic evening."}
{"text":"My wife and I tried Pita Jungle for the first time last night.  The service was fast and very friendly.  The greeters and serving staff were all friendly and accommodating.  It was fairly crowded for a chilly Wednesday night, so we were expecting some good food.  We ordered a hummus starter, with two pitas.  I had Schawarma, and my wife had a Gyro.  The pitas served with the hummus were warm and delicious.  But, the hummus was just plain bland.  I would also call it over pureed, but that wouldn't have mattered if it had been more tasty.  I love hummus, can could eat it with a spoon, but this hummus just didn't grab either of us.  My Schwarama was tasty enough, but nothing to go out of my way for.  My wife and I were both surprised by her Gyro.  The meat was actually salty, and didn't taste like any Gyro meat I've ever had.  The Gyro itself was okay tasting, but it was the least tasty Gyro either of us have ever had.  It was a pleasant evening, but the food just doesn't rate a return visit.  There are too many places near Norterra to get better food.  Of course, most of them don't serve alcohol, so if you want a brew with your meal, you may be more limited.  We were really surprised by all the great reviews, since that definitely was not our experience.  Updated November 13, 2013 After my first visit, I wrote the review, above, and left a two star rating.  Despite the excellent, friendly service, my wife and I had no intention of returning due to the lackluster food.    After writing the review, I was contacted by Pita Jungle management and asked to try them again.  So, we did.  On our second visit, we received the same exemplary service, and met Travis, the manager.  Travis and the rest of the staff were awesome.  We decided to try dishes from the specialty menu to see how much these guys could shine.  We ordered Chicken Tikka Masala and Wood-Fired Fresh Salmon.  Both were delicious.    Given the great service of both visits, and the really good food of the second visit, I really wanted to give four stars.  But, we couldn't escape the fact that the hummus has a acidic sour flavor, and is over pureed.  I think they use vinegar instead of lemon juice and over puree to cover the consistent texture.  It's not bad, but it's not even mediocre either.    Then, there are the pita entrees.  Delicious pita bread and fresh tasty veggies make them quite palatable.  But, the gyro meat's only flavor is salt.  That's just not right.  Frankly, I have to admit that another location just about a hundred feet away makes better pitas and has better hummus.  All the food really should be delicious for four stars.  So, I'll just say they're 3.5 stars due to mostly delicious food and great service.  Since there aren't any half stars, I'll just have to round up to four.  So, for pitas, keep walking till you get to the other place on the left.  For everything else, Pita Jungle is a great place."}
{"text":"My daugher and I love this place! Great service, great food and great prices!  Our favorite starter is the red bell pepper hummus with chicken! My 2 year loves everything we have tried so far!"}
{"text":"YES! YES! YES! You can't go wrong with Pita Jungle. Order out or dine in, if you are visiting Pita Jungle, put this on your list as a MUST. Start with the cilantro jalepeno hummus. The chicken tika masala is delicious if you are feeling Indian, or if you want a salad, the chicken curry salad is amazing! They have wraps, pizza, and a ton to choose from so you can't go wrong. My wife and I have never ordered something and been disappointed."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of the whole Pita Jungle family, so I was pretty pleased with the newest addition. Working at the Downtown campus of ASU, there are certainly some great spots (especially when the food trucks hit on Friday), but having some pita goodness less than 5 minutes away is nice. I actually missed the grand opening by....well, about 5 months, but better late than never!  So first, this place is basically a \"spic-and-span'd \" version of the Tempe and Indian School PJ's. For Desert Ridge and Downtown, the Jungle seems to have cleaned up their act a bit, with the ambiance and serving staff. Not that I dislike the punk chics with sleeve tattoos at the other locations (cute inked girls are never a bad thing), but you can see that the Roosevelt location is trying to draw in the business crowd. It must be pretty successful; we got there at 11:15 with the place half empty, and it was packed within 15 minutes.  Our server was very good, on top of our table (in a good way) during the entire lunch. I am pretty easy at Pita Jungle; I am legally addicted to their hummus, so I just got the Hummus with Sirloin while my lunch-mate ordered a greek salad and dolma. Everything was fantastic. I have never had a bad order of hummus from PJ (and there have been A LOT of orders), and the sirloin was really good. I was used to the chicken, but the steak was a welcome change. I even grabbed a dolma from CM, which was very good, almost like a full sushi roll with just rice.  Overall, it was a very good lunch experience. I would suggest getting there early to avoid the lunch rush and dive into some pureed chickpea splendor."}
{"text":"Ate here for the second time today and had the superb Derek as our server. Hubby and I have tried the Philly, black bean burger, garlic potatoes, hummus trio, and turkey burger special. Holy flavor explosion!   I was not a huge fan of either burger(two different visits), primarily because I am not a big onion person and that is a distinct texture and flavor. Due to the sauces and lettuce with dressing on the turkey burger, I would say that it had a bit more taste to it. My husband really liked his Philly pita and the garlic potatoes and hummus trio were wonderful. The small hummus plate was still huge and filling. We did need to order 2 extra pitas to finish it. The cilantro jalepeno hummus was the best by far and I will definitely try a dish with that in/on it next time."}
{"text":"Well this place has been going down hill for a while, my GF and I were in there the other day and the \"kid\" who was our server was lousy and we had to argue with them to get a free small dip via B-day coupon my GF had, then they said no substitutions on the free dip...WTF ?  It really is worth losing repeat customers over a $3.99 app promotion....see ya..."}
{"text":"The food is good usually, during the week is best as you have a better sever staff, weekends you have the trendy/hipster \"airhead\" ASU kids running things and they all seem hung over or just dumb, the Gilbert location is much more solid in all aspects...only drawback there is all the damn children !!  lol  Anyways the food is stil good, hence the 3 stars, Tempe location need to work on their server training...."}
{"text":"Well we decided to try out this new Dana Park location as we have been disappointed in all the other locations in the east valley (except for Gilbert-San Tan location) this location is nice as it is close to the 60,  the patio/bar/entry area takes up most of the space..Kudos for having real booths at this location, it steers the families to that side of the place however the dining room is small so you will still hear the kids crying and whining...lol...the service was just ok, food was just ok as well (my chicken was overcooked but it seems no restaurants can cook chicken right anyways so...), also we were perplexed by the large entry way with piano and stadium seats for waiting it looks cool but too \"hipster\" inspired and wasted space, there are like 12 tables + the booths total in the dining room so seems a bit small and to have all that wasted space up front seems really annoying given our table was positioned right in front of the kitchen entrance and bathroom entrance...the bar looks interesting so we may check out happy hour one day, overall it is still Pita Jungle which is far better than all the chain restaurants in Gilbert so 3 stars...we still prefer the Gilbert-San Tan location however..."}
{"text":"Can't believe this place is packed all the time. People are wasting their money and time eating at this place. This is not \"Greek\" or \"Mediterranean\" or anything close to that. This is a washed down version. Real authentic Greek meat need to be on the cone that spins around and they cut it from the cone and it falls in a pan. That's how gyros or Shawarma is suppose to be. The chicken \"shawarma\" that I had was just chicken breast cut into small little pieces put into this \"pita\" that they use that's not even cooked right because the juice destroys the pita and everything comes out on your plate and it starts looking like a salad. This is not real Greek food. Their are so many good mom and pop places you can go to and get the real feel of Greek food. This is just stopping you from a great experience. I do not prefer this place to anyone who knows food but those people who are controlled by generic will stay and keep coming back. Open your eyes people."}
{"text":"The downtown Pita Jungle has been long in coming, but I am happy to report it was worth the wait.  Popping in for a quick take out order, I was really pleased to see the spacious interior with contemporary yet cozy tables and chairs. This seems like a departure from the other PJ locations, and it really fits the venue. Polished concrete floors and a historic building make a great canvas for this PJ location. It has a noticeably different feel than the Tempe location, and that isn't a bad thing. Bonus points to PJ downtown for providing ample space between tables. If you've been to the Arcadia location then you know how tight seating is, and you essentially need to introduce yourself to the people sitting next to you, as you will be hearing every word of their conversation.  As with other PJ locations, this location is filled with attractive servers, bustling around. When I went to pick up my order, I noticed a few employees were having a bit of a spat, and launching zingers back and forth at each other. Not sure what the issue was, but maybe a better location to fight would be in the back kitchen area?  In closing, this PJ location is off to a great start, as with any new venture, there are things to be worked out. I imagine if they get some front of house leadership in place, things will run more smoothly. In the meantime, it is a reliable place to grab a good meal."}
{"text":"WOW, WHAT A PLACE!!! These are the types of fresh restaurants I am dying for here in Ohio. If you make it out to Arizona or California, look up nearby locations of Pita Jungle. Relaxed environment, friendly staff, happy hour specials on wine, beer and appetizers, and FRESH ingredients. The pita wraps were tasty and big; the homemade hummus was a delight, especially the cilantro jalapeno; and even my first try of lentil soup was memorable. Also this was the only restaurant during my 5 days in AZ that I just HAD to return to for seconds."}
{"text":"This place puts on a great happy hour! the 2 dollar appetizers are fun to order and try new things with a group of people, everyone gets a taste and a great deal. Last month they had a 1.99 wine special going and the wine was tasty and satisfying. We get the best service while sitting at the bar. At the tables, not so much. On the regular menu, the salmon dinner is wonderful. Especially the spinach that goes with the salmon. Divine.  Very casual place, great after a little shopping at Desert Ridge or meeting up with friends making it freeway close after work. A little on the noisy side but for the great food and value, I'll take it and we'll continue to eat here."}
{"text":"Pita Jungle is like a grandparent.  Extremely reliable, always fills you up when you visit, and hasn't changed style in over a decade.  And like a good grandparent, you don't need a reservation to get in, but patience is virtue because sometimes there's a wait...but it's worth it.  Personally, I love the specials list on menus because they're unique and odds are, you might not see them again.  Yesterday, I ordered the grilled cajun mahi mahi with toasted pita chips and jalepeno cilantro hummus.  Yeah, I know. That was quite an order.  But for $10, it's a great portion and the fish was prepared perfectly!  I highly recommend PJ for lunch and as soon as the server shows up, I highly recommend you order the trio hummus plate along with the tropical tea! What a good start to a good day :)"}
{"text":"We eat here every week, and the food is consistently cooked to perfection. We have tried it all .The service is excellent, especially Cristina! Ask to sit in her area!"}
{"text":"The food and atmosphere is great but most importantly I love the staff. Miranda is my favorite sever and she is amazing every time. I will keep asking for her any time I go. She's friendly, prompt, and a great person in general! Yes you can come here for great food but coming for the awesome staff is what makes it worth it!"}
{"text":"I went to Pita Jungle on a Sunday afternoon around 1pm. There was a fifteen minute wait for a table for two. No big deal it was packed for Sunday lunch time!  Our server was very nice. She attended to all of our needs. I don't remember if she told me her name or not. The staff there is usually pretty nice.  Me and my brother started off with a small hummus duo and ordered pita chips with them. They are so delicious and it was my brothers first time trying them and he enjoyed it! For my main course, I had the taboule salad with chicken and my bro ordered the gyro. My salad was delicious and fresh. My brothers meal said it lacked pizzazz. It needed more flavor and meat.  The restaurant smells funky all the time and I cannot pinpoint what it is. It's like... Stuffy bleach? Not sure but it smells weird.  Anywho, I love going to PIta Jungle. It's great."}
{"text":"I always have a fantastic experience at Pita Jungle! There is always a friendly hostess to greet you, management always says hello and checks in on you, and the service is impeccable. I usually sit at the bar or a high top table and Tiffany is very prompt, and provides excellent service. After returning from my first dining experience with her, she remembered me, my order, profession, and her level of hospitality is second to none.   5 stars from me Pita Jungle, keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"Pita Jungle has always been one of my favorite places to eat - although not this location. I called in my order to go - just a gyro- I was told it would be ready in 15 min. I arrived on time and sure enough the order was ready. Unfortunately, the gyro was not even warm and looked less than appetizing - with an open kitchen it was obvious the staff was less than pleased with me. Literally less than 2 min I had another (or the same) gyro.  Today Pita Jungle, you get 3 stars for poor service and questionable food quality."}
{"text":"Luv the food here, especially the gyros. Friendly, laid-back atmosphere. I'm a frequent flyer"}
{"text":"Glad to get a seat inside with 102 degrees outside:( Im not from Arizona.  Great tasting freah food.  Not too heavy but filling.  I had the curry chicken salad.  Opted for taziki sauce.  Was very yummy.  Little slow to get order taken but food came quick after in."}
{"text":"I liked the place it has a special look. Very spacious and nice restaurant theme. I tried the hummus and grilled chicken it was a very special dish and chicken was great. I would go back to this place and try different dishes !"}
{"text":"We ordered from the catering menu at the Dana Park, Mesa AZ location and were more than pleased with the service we got. Not only was the food plentiful and delicious but the manager was very accommodating and friendly. We will definitely cater from them again!!"}
{"text":"A guy at my gym highly suggested I try Pita Jungle. This is my first time at Pita Jungle and I am not impressed with their food at all.   One positive thing, the servers were all really symmetrical (that is science for attractive) and worked as a team. However, the waiters and waitresses were so busy they all looked like they were chickens running around with their heads cut off. They were overworked and made a lot of mistakes to other tables near me. Wrong drinks were brought out, customers had to ask for soup to be brought out before their meals, wrong entrees were brought out to the wrong tables, and customers weren't given the utensils. My server essentially only served my food and ran my credit card. She eyeballed me every two minutes and even asked me if I needed a box 5 minutes in. I felt rushed to finish. However, another server took care of me. He brought out my drink, took my order, and gave me my check. I ordered the bell pepper hummus and pita. My main meal was the Shawarma, a Mediterranean chicken pita, without onions. The chicken was so dry I asked for tzatziki sauce to drown in my chicken pita. My waitress asked if my chicken was dry like she knew it was going to be dry. Not sure.   My meal was 14 dollars something cents. A little pricey for a fast food-like quality. Perhaps I shouldn't judge this entire chain as a whole because of this is a one-time poor experience. I may have to give it another try at another Pita Jungle or when they're less busy."}
{"text":"I ordered the Mahi Mahi and we had a mozzarella salad to share.  My dining partner had Salmon.  the salmon was over cooked after a careful conversation about how it should be cooked.  So, why 5 stars?  The manager was genuinely upset about this, paid for my partners meal, AND assured us there would be training on how to cook salmon properly.  I have to say I was impressed-and believed her.  This place has character, food is good (not wow but good) and service was good.  Don't get it confused though with Pita Pit which is literally 2-3 stores down you'll have a very different experience."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in the staff here due to the gossip aloud mocking others included , a manager with blonde hair arguing with a worker infront of customers. The hummus with chicken came over cooked with hard to chew pieces.  He had Sharma sandwhich.  Well to some it up we won't be coming back to this Pita J. Shea location blows this one away for food and service!."}
{"text":"It's fast, quick, fresh, and has a decent amount of options on the menu that can be made vegan. The staff was awesome in helping find out what dishes could be made vegan, which was great!   I ordered the falafel wrap as a bowl instead of a wrap so the onions, falafel, and tomatoes were on top of a bed of rice with the tahini sauce on the side. It was delicious and tasted super healthy and the tahini sauce was perfect. On the side I had the tabbouleh salad because tabbouleh salad is my favorite and I was pleasantly surprised with how tasty it was. I wish there would have just been a little bit more tomatoes. Both left me feeling like a nourished my body with the right food, rather than feeling bloated, like some restaurants do.   Anyways, it was kind of busy but the to go service was speedy fast, so way to go on that!   Like I said, I wish there was a Pita Jungle in Indy because I would definitely visit frequently to grab a quick meal for lunch!"}
{"text":"Pita Jungle   My oh my. So many yummy choices! If only there was a pita jungle in Indianapolis! A variety of the menu options can be made both vegan and vegetarian. I confirmed that the tahini is vegan (usually it is anyways).   I've always loved Mediterranean food and Pita Jungle offers it all. I ordered my food to go and was so impressed by how fast it was prepared! I got the falafal wrap as a bowl with organic brown rice, which was vegan. I'm not sure if their wraps are vegan! I also ordered a side of tabbouleh salad because I LOVE tabbouleh and couldn't resist!!!!  (See both pictured below). Both were super great servings, I was stuffed afterwards and definitely could have been shared between two people.   The service was nice, and as stated early, the food was prepared in a fast and timely manner.   I absolutely loved the falafel rice bowl, it was delicious and fresh tasting. The tahini dressing was super creamy and delicious. The tabbouleh had just the right amount of lemon and it tasted so great, I almost had to go back for more.   There are quite a few locations in Arizona, so if you haven't yet tried Pita Jungle, I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"We decided that we would try to be healthy for lunch today so we decided to come here because of all the options on the menu. New year, new me? Nahhh - more like new year, new restaurants. Cheers to this being my first review of 2018!   I usually frequent the Scottsdale Rd & Shea Blvd location but this one was closer to our office. Once we arrived, we were seated and it was probably around 11:30 a.m. so it wasn't busy yet. We started with a hummus trio - original, roasted bell pepper, and a cilantro jalape√±o hummus. It came with 2 pitas so we shared that and also ordered a side of veggies (tomatoes & cucumbers). There were 4 of us and I thought it was a great sharing appetizer.   For my entree, I went with the spicy chicken wrap (as a bowl and not a wrap). It was definitely plentiful and I ended up eating a third of it. Lots of veggies and they add brown rice for the bowl option. I thought it would be healthier without the pita - I was only trying to justify what I would have for dessert.   Unfortunately, we didn't order dessert. Do they serve dessert here? I honestly can't remember. If they do, I would recommend the servers mentioning something. I quite honestly don't even remember who our server was. I think I saw the busboy more than our server.   It got busy near the end of our meal so I can understand why our waters were not refilled. The weather is beautiful and in the 70's right now... Really should utilize the patio and fresh air! Next time, I'll ask."}
{"text":"Food is good and the only reason to dine at this Pita Jungle.  Service is very poor and management is careless.  Takeout  is also a miserable experience.  Insufficient telephone lines, always on hold, never able to take the order,  and one you pick it up, it is  rarely the correct order."}
{"text":"I'm new to the Gilbert area and was looking for Mediterranean food and came across this spot. Amazing hummus! Really enjoyed the people here and the managers were very accommodating when j requested a custom order. Thanks Sean and Ryan. I recommend the iced tea!"}
{"text":"Always delicious no matter the pita jungle. Had some Pita-Dough (gift certificate) so decided to come on MLK for lunch since I had the day off. The place was pretty slow with maybe a handful of tables and we got seated promptly. Our server was great and attentive and I think one of the only people working so was hustling back and forth but made sure we had everything we needed along with refills. We ordered dolmades and hummus to start. I lie that you can mix and match the hummus. My favorite is the cilantro jalape√±o hummus and we split it with regular. We also got the feta cheese and spinach quesadilla served with tzatki sauce and added chicken along with the feta and spinach lavash wood fired pizza to split and baklava to end it. Everything was yummy. One tip, just make sure if you have pita dough, to use all of it in one shot as the remainder does not go back to you. Mine was for $50 and our bill was $45 and some change. So not made about a couple bucks not coming back."}
{"text":"Alright, just to set the record, I gave this place 5 chances to make me not do this, and everytime that I went, I was dissapointed.  I wasn't even dissapointed by the same thing evertime I went either.  It was always something different.  1st visit: I walked in, and then was ignored by the \"hostess\" while she was on her cell phone on a \"personal\" call.  The server brought me the wrong drink (lemonade, not ice tea?! -.- seriously...)  Even after I asked for the right drink, it never came, so I gave up.  The philly steak pita is not so great.  Very bland.  Service was just jacked up.  2nd visit: Didn't get service until 23 minutes after being sat.  Trust me, I timed it.  Server didn't even apologize or even point out that we had been sitting there for quite some time.  Plus, it wasn't busy.  After the food was ordered, I never saw my server until the bill.  Brought us the wrong bill...so we had to wait another 15 minutes before we could pay...and then another 15 minutes till we got the right bill.  ARGH!!  3rd visit: Ordered the salmon salad, got the salmon entree instead.  Told the server, and the server stood in front of me and argued with me about what I had ordered.  Pretty much said to my face that I was lying.  No tip, FTW!  4th visit: Sat and watched my server (while our drinks were empty) stand behind the bar and chat it up with a couple of coworkers, while our food was dying in the kitchen window (you can see where the servers pick up the food from the kitchen from where you are sitting)  Estimated time in the window...14 minutes.  WHOOOO!! -.-  5th Visit: This time I decided to skip the service and do a to-go.  So I call ahead...get there 15 minutes later...go up to the bar, and tell the lady...\"I'm here to pick up a to-go order under the name of Rebecca.\"  She looks at me dumb founded and then quickly goes to her computer and says \"Oh right, what did you want again?\"  Starts putting in my order as I'm standing there.  (Now what was the point in calling ahead?) Then I ask her, \"are you putting in my order right now?\" she says, \"Uh It's okay, It'll only take like 10 minutes.\" -.- yeah mmhmm...I watched my food sit in the window of the kitchen...for about 10 minutes.  Then some other server packed it up and put it behind the bar, and watched it sit there for another 15 minutes.  I didn't get my food until some old guy at the bar pointed out to the bartender that I had been waiting for quite sometime for my food.  So all in all, I waited for almost an hour to get my food.  With no apology from the dumb bartender.  So! My final statement here! If you have good luck, by all means run over to pita, and maybe you'll have a good experience, but as for me, you won't see me there ever again =]  oh btw, I had both the salmon salad and the salmon entree and both are pretty good, only if you're crazy craving salmon =]  good portion and pretty good sides that come with the entree."}
{"text":"I had plans tonight that were unexpectedly cancelled and after my yoga class (At One Yoga), I was starving. Somehow, I had managed to go all day without eating. Spontaneously, I decided to head over to Pita Jungle (Scottsdale and Shea) to see how long it might take for a take out order of Chicken/Hummus (sub cucumber for pita bread) and a small side of Tabboule. The bartender (Ana?) warmly greeted and, was cordial and efficient and told me it would be just a few minutes. She wasn't kidding! The total of my order was $10.39 and the bag of goodies was in my hands so quickly that it actually took longer for me to drive home...  The food held its integrity in the packaging and was 95% as good as if I was sitting on the Pita Jungle patio enjoying it with a glass of wine and about to head to the Gelato Spot for dessert. Tonight's trade off though is that, I had dinner while sitting in my favorite chair, with enough to have lunch and maybe a light dinner tomorrow night too!"}
{"text":"This place is always good. Never had a bad meal yet. I started going there at the Tempe location many years ago. This location is nice and right by the house. Love the Philly Steak pita, Gyro pita, all the types of humus. Food is good and healthy. Always busy and can get a bit noisy during heavy eating hours. Quick service and great tunes. Yummy!  You can listen to their music feed here. http://www.pitajungle.com/music-player/"}
{"text":"When Gabi K suggested we stop at Pita Jungle for a bite to eat after a Yelp event I had images of Rainforest Cafe in my head.  I think it's the \"jungle\" part of their name that led me to that vision.  But when we arrived at Pita Jungle I didn't see any over the top jungle decorations, loud fake animals, or screaming children (phew).  Instead Pita Jungle is a lowkey spot to get some good Mediterranean food.  I had filled up on good eats at the Yelp event so I just split some pita and hummus with Jared M.  And yes, the hummus is as good as the other yelpers claim...mmm.  Gabi hadn't pigged out at the event like we had so she ordered her favorite macro platter- it appeared to be both healthy and delicious!  Definitely something I\"ll be ordering during future trips to Pita Jungle.  Oh, and the price is right too. Now this is one jungle I plan on visiting again!"}
{"text":"I totally dug the layout of Pita Jungle.  I was a bit confused about what Pita Jungle wanted to be at first: Bar?  Vegetarian/Health-conscious restaurant? Central Phoenix Trendy Eatery?  I am not sure I can put my finger yet on what Pita Jungle is, but I enjoyed my experience and would be open to repeating.  My friends and I split the jalapeno and cilantro hummus and it was quite splendid.  I was a bit confused why it only came with two pitas when it was clear that two pitas would not be sufficient.  Luckily, each additional pita was only 39 cents.  Still, don't serve a dish that is not complete without paying extra.  My friends all had various other dishes that were huge portion-wise.  They all enjoyed their selections.  Service was decent."}
{"text":"Amazing food for cheap prices!! So healthy and authentically delicious. Get the spicy chicken as a bowl."}
{"text":"I love this place. Their cilantro hummus and Chicken Tikka Masala are the best!!!"}
{"text":"Pita Jungle is pretty decent I've had their chicken shwarma plates every time I go.  It's pretty college-neo hippie-veggie-art on the walls is for sale-type of place.  Not to say that's a negative, just a weird vibe for me personally. Haji Baba is just down the street and personally that is more my speed and I think their hummus is better too."}
{"text":"Terrible!  There are way better restaurants in this area . .  . go try something new!  This place is old, tired and the food is not that good or healthy, (like people think it is) Pretty average. . ."}
{"text":"Worst service ever. Seated quick, orders taken promptly then we didn't see our server for the next half hour. This wouldn't have been an issue if the food I had ordered was tolerable. I usually love pita jungle (chandler location), and if there is an issue with the food they are always quick to remedy the situation with the exception of this location. they never even offered me a chance to exchange my order, besides the fact my wife had finished her meal 10 minutes before we saw our server again. Bad experience ending with just a check and a, \"sorry it didn't work out for ya bud.\""}
{"text":"Love this place. Service has always been good. Only have had to wait 20mins at most for a table on a busy day."}
{"text":"I am a regular at this place and there are few places I can say that about. The food is excellent, authentic, and inexpensive. The waiters and waitresses may put you off at first by their casual appearance but it sets the comfortable atmosphere of this place. Inside is a little cramped but step out to the patio and you you can eat at the shore of a beautiful lake. The ducks are fun at first but as a regular, they can get annoying. Fortunately Pita Jungle has taken measures to stop them from visiting your meal. There Hummus is incredible and I also recommend their beef gyro and pesto pizza."}
{"text":"My family used to eat here all the time but it's been a good two years since we have ordered food here. We always loved the hot pita, specifically the Mediterranean roasted chicken (shawarma). We just ordered a take-out order tonight and it seems the chicken is now shredded, and tastes and has the consistency of canned tuna. I am so disappointed and could barely finish it. My husband felt the same way. Sadly, we probably won't be back. Please bring back the old chicken Pita Jungle!!"}
{"text":"We stopped by Pita Jungle before hitting the road back to Los Angeles. The Mediterranean Chicken Salad was nothing short of AMAZINGLY DELICIOUS!!!! I ate every last bite. Can't wait to stop by Pita Jungle on our next trip to Phoenix."}
{"text":"Not giving it a bad review on the food, the food is spectacular. It's the service, 3 times in a row I've tried to call in an order and the same kid picks up and hangs up or answers  and asks you to hold until you hang up.  Last wait was 11 minutes before I hung up...I can only assume they are not interested in take out orders. There's plenty of other Mediterranean restaurants that will accept my business.  A shame bad service can ruin a great business."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in this place and the service we received or lack of on our visit.  We were sat at our table and watched as the hostess sat 2 other tables after us.  The waitress came and took their drink orders and not one person came by our table.  As we sat there we watched a group of 8 employees gathered around the kitchen laughing and joking as we sat there still not one acknowledgement or I will be with you in one moment.  The restaurant was not busy and the way we were treated will make us think twice before we step back inside this joke of a restaurant."}
{"text":"What's the deal with the Kefta Burger. Sometimes you serve it and sometimes you don't. Some locations have it and some don't. It takes prob 10 min to prepare. Just serve it already..."}
{"text":"Great food, great servers. Mgmt? Not sure. Friday night. 12 open tables and they are making families wait. We actually sat at an open table waiting for them to seat us at an open table??"}
{"text":"We came in during the lunch rush today (Saturday) expecting a little wait. Despite remaining patient for 10 to 15 minutes after being seated, my husband had to ask a server to find our server. She kindly brought us waters but our server didn't ever arrive. We left and are now eating Tuna at Ra Sushi next door."}
{"text":"Oh, Pita Jungle. Your genuine and friendly service is the best thing you have going for you! My husband and I each had a cup of lentil soup and split an order of Hummus with Chicken - red bell pepper, of course! We replace the pita with cucumber slices and the cukes were English, which means more skin, and less flesh. As well, they were dry and rubbery, as if they had been sitting out sliced for a while.  We've been Pita Jungle patrons for many years. Sadly, the portions and food quality have dwindled while the prices have continued increasing. That's ok, it's to be expected when chains expand, right? Well I'd also expect a great bathroom and parking situation and this location fails on both points. I can't say if it was just this day, but the bathroom smelled overwhelmingly of urine; I was looking at all of the surfaces trying to find the source, but ended up holding my breath while the paper towel dispenser vomited 3in sections of paper (no chance I'm touching that door handle!) There's also no designated parking, even though the very classy Jack in the Box next door has its own marked spaces. The location is on a very busy corner of Mill and University, so parking is already scarce.  Come on, Pita Jungle. I throw enough money your way that you don't have to make the healthy dining experience painful. My husband and I will be trying other places before returning here, sadly.  Oh yeah, there is also art for sale if you feel like wasting anymore money on your next trip to Pita Jungle! If you're really interested in local art, I prefer the selection at Crepe Bar."}
{"text":"Worst falafel sandwich ever and I have had plenty. This was was grainy, burnt and had no taste whatsever. They put so much lettuce and some of the worst vegetables known to mankind in this hellhole of sandwich. The pickle had a tale, the onions were from the end of the onion and the lettuce was brown. THIS WAS DISGUSTING. One arrogant staff member gave me an annoying fake smile, she looked like a manager type. This is what happens when you open up up fifty restaurants, you lose the quality, but in this case I'm sure that there was no quality in the first place. It figures that this place is in the same shopping center as Amy's Kitchen. Seven more bucks down the drain.  UPDATE: Management was nice enough to contact me and apologize and they also gave me a $25 gift card. I will give them another try. Thanks to Kevin."}
{"text":"My business partner and I have been coming to this location since it opened, regularly. The servers have always been friendly especially Kev short for Kevin. Today was a completely different experience. Which will make it difficult for me or the people who witnessed the attack from the manager to come back. I had my little dog with me today on the outside patio. My business partner and I were conducting a high-level interview over lunch. All of the sudden there's a loud jack hammer across the street, so loud we couldn't even hear each other. We were going to move to the front patio, but our server said we could sit inside. I was just thinking how nice our server was again, as usual. Then the manager Kevin Metz comes over. In a very aggressive manor he asks, \"is that a service dog?\" I say \"yes, it is.\" He then probes further, \"does he do tricks?\" I thought, what an odd question to ask, especially with attitude. I replied, \"he does, for me not you though.\" He didn't like this. Then he accuses me of being sarcastic. Now I'm irritated and on the defensive. I asked for his business card. He straight up told me, \"it's at the front counter, get it yourself!\"  This wasn't enough of an attack, to insult me further he asks, \"are you being sincere?\" I told him I didn't appreciate him insulting my integrity.  He interrogated me in front of my colleagues and completely ruined our lunch. Everyone was blown away at his demeanor and how unprofessional he was. Chances are we will never come back. At least not as long as he is managing. I am going to share this experience with the three owners' as I feel they would like to know how their customers are being treated by Kevin Metz. It is clear he was suffering from a pride attack rather than just getting the facts. I shouldn't have to explain I am a former Marine with anxiety and do in fact have a registered service dog!"}
{"text":"Another fantastic meal at Pita Jungle. The Chicken and hummus was delicious and my husband  said his salmon was wonderful. Great service too! Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I normally enjoy Pita Jungle, but this was our first visit to this location. I don't think we'll return. The Spanakopita was barely warm, and I had to double check that they actually used fillo dough. It certainly didn't look like it at first glance, and it did not have much of a flaky crunch. It absolutely was not worth nearly $4 for a very modest halved triangle. My sirloin with hummus was simply not appetizing- the two flavors did not  marry well to my taste, and the meat was too overdone (and I was not given an option to have it rarer). The chicken with hummus and pine nuts is far superior and a dish I have enjoyed many times before. Hubby enjoyed his falafel pita well enough. His only complaint was that there was not enough tzatsiki sauce. I thought the falafel was overly crunchy and too dry on the inside, but then again, I am super picky about falafel, having spent a summer in Ann Arbor years ago, learning Arabic and eating outstanding Middle Eastern food.   The service was OK, not particularly friendly, but efficient. I think this location can take a lesson or two from the East valley locations."}
{"text":"Should have tried this place sooner. The oven wasn't working on this day, but I wanted the Chicken Shawrma Pita anyway. The thing was huge and the roasted white meat chicken that was inside was delicious. Got some pickles in the last few bites also, but next time will get garlic sauce on side. Both Tahini and garlic in same sandwich are too much. One of the better chicken pitas in town in terms of the overstuffed variety. I think the Pita Bread or pita wrap? could have been bigger or fresher, but still quite satisfying. Also ordered a side of garlic new red potatoes and these were big wedges of potatoes loaded with spices and of course garlic. Counter girl was helpful, but the other counter girl probably should not have been crouching down and eating food right where folks place to-go orders. Show some class and eat in the back."}
{"text":"My wife recommended Pita Jungle, and assured me that it was \"much better than the name makes it sound.\"  Unfortunately, we had a very disappointing experience this evening.  First, the waitress seemed overloaded, and did not remember our drink order. Next, my wife Received her entr√©e before mine, and before we received the appetizers.  My entr√©e arrived about five minutes after my wife's. Overall, the service was slow, and not very attentive.  To make matters worse, the food was not very good. The spanakopita was overcooked, and burned in some places. The tomatoes and mozzarella had unripe tomatoes, and like every other dish that they serve there, they were smothered in sprouts of some sort, and intertwined with pita chips.  I had the mahi-mahi, and while it was a very nice texture, it was a little bit more fishy tasting than I am used to.  My wife really enjoyed the hummus, and the garlic new potatoes were good, but not great.  The last complaint I have is just about how they seated us. Even though there were several other tables available, they put us right next to a group that was large, and boisterous. When that group left, the restaurant was practically empty of patrons, but they seated another group right next to us."}
{"text":"This place ROCKS! It's a little loud, but it's worth the visit.  Granted, I cannot pronounce half of the things on the menu, but the Jalapeno Cilantro hummus is to-die-for delish.  The Greek salad is awesome, as are the gyros.  I've never made it past the hummus, gyros and salad, but it is consistently great food and quick service.  Always busy, but isn't every good restaurant?  Go! It's yummy! This location is my favorite, as I think the one at Desert Ridge has slightly different tasting food (on the negative side of different tasting, that is)."}
{"text":"My favorite pita place is Desert Ridge Pita Jungle! Their food is great, healthy and the best server is Jen Allen. Can't get any better than her!! She truly is a friendly & courteous! I will keep coming back."}
{"text":"It's hard to find healthy food when you're on a roadtrip through Arizona but this was the perfect stop for us, next to Lola Coffee. Never had the option of having grilled ahi tuna served with hummus before, but that was such a great combo. Their hummus platters allow you pick between three different types and they're even flexible even to allow you to do half and half. Got an order to-go and they did everything right w/ respect to ensuring we had everything we needed from a flatware standpoint to enjoy a nice \"car picnic.\" They use actual lavash for their wraps, rather than tortillas, which was legit and appreciated. Great service."}
{"text":"Love love love! This location is the absolute best. They always have excellent service and their portions are amazing! Jalape√±o/cilantro hummus is amazing and we love the Mediterranean chicken salad. Out of all of the pita jungles in AZ this location is the best!"}
{"text":"HUGE fan of the Tempe location from my days at ASU so was psyched to hit up the Scottsdale location when I was in town last week. Still hard to beat the Schwarma lavosh wrap. Would love it if they opened a location in SF. Come on, please?"}
{"text":"This is the place to go for healthy, great food with a modern, ambience. Art is comprised of  artist's work hung on the walls and available for sale. They have a nice open patio in the back looking over the water feature at Anderson Springs. I have not had a bad meal here ever. Everything is tasty and fresh. Kyle was our server and he was friendly and fast. He even offered to put some ice tea in a to-go cup. I've been to Pita Jungle in Pasadena, CA and in Irvine, CA it's not the same in Cali. It's way better in AZ. Certain evenings have live music. This is a great place for a date with music, wine with some apps; how can you go wrong? Keep up the good work with great food Pita Jungle - and I will always come back!"}
{"text":"I work across the street and we've tried ordering from here several times. I have yet to have a positive experience. Today, I placed a group order for pickup. After picking it up, I realized they'd forgotten part of it. When I called the person on the phone was very rude. She did offer to grab a manager but instead of putting me on hold she just hung up. My previous experiences were similar. The food is okay but the customer service is awful. Do not recommend."}
{"text":"I love Pita Jungle!  It's fresh and  ever so yummy!  Stopped in for lunch a few weeks ago and ordered the chicken pita and added avocado and it was HUGE!   I ate every bite.    I can't wait to go back next time in PHX."}
{"text":"I'm impressed!  I was visiting Phoenix, and a friend recommended grabbing lunch here.  I ordered the seared ahi, and it was really, REALLY good!  I was amazed that one could get seafood that good at a Mediterranean establishment, in the middle of the desert.  The place was very crowded, which is testament tot he quality of the food.  I will definitely return to Pita Jungle the next time I'm in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Obsessed with the Mediterranean Chicken Salad! Ordered pick-up last time and all was ready upon arrival."}
{"text":"I am definitely going back to PJ!  I ran in to pick up take out for two, and immediately wished we had decided to dine in.  It's spacious and welcoming, but so far back off the main street you have to be looking for it to find it.  My wife had the ahi tuna salad which was light, very tasty and fully satisfying.  I had the spicy chicken wrap.  Rather, I had a third of it and am saving the rest of the ample portion for lunch!  Based on other Yelpers, I have to try the hummus.  Next time for sure..."}
{"text":"One of my favorites! Never had anything I didn't love. Happy hour is a best-kept secret! 3-6 everyday"}
{"text":"PJ is like a music artist who had a hit single or two, then tried to drag it out as long as possible, but subsequent product just wasn't much ...   The gyro is great, the hot pita (especially philly steak), is great.  But everything else?  Just bizarre combinations of anything except substance - i.e. lacking meat, flour, and whatever else makes life good.    Because I like most people have to admit gyros and pitas are great, I gave it one more chance.  But there were a number of problems: - Old, old building with a cruddy interior makes you feel like why am I paying olive garden pricing (or more) but getting the quality of an old west-side circle k or something ??? - Hard, wooden chairs that were uncomfortable after about the first 5 minutes. - Dark lighting, without a corresponding slick mood.  Just dark and uncomfortable.   - I got a chipotle chicken pizza (the only thing I could find with real meat in it other than pitas and gyros, and this was DINNER time for me - but that's the problem with going to lunch places for dinner I guess) .... and it was ridiculously spicy.  The only dip was cucumber yogurt dip.    I like the pita jungles that are in mall food courts, because they don't try to pretend to be something they're not.  PJ's are a good place to get a $6-8 delicious lunch.   But they need to give up the idea of full service sit-down restaurants, because that concept just isn't fulfilled with old buildings and hard uncomfortable seats and a slim, lunch-y menu and a scarce wait staff that appears to be new to the industry.   This location is just begging for a new owner that is willing to bulldoze the place and re-build (or remodel), make it comfortable, surrender the idea of full service dinner, open the darn place from 11 to 4, and do a really good job at it."}
{"text":"Review is 7th st and Missouri location - Pita jungle has been one of my favorite restaurants since my first visit in Tempe around 2002.  I have tried most of the stuff at pita jungle and have never really had a complaint.  No matter which pita jungle I went to the quality was good and everything was cooked, plated and served pretty much the same.  Every once in a blue moon the chicken might be dry but on rare occasions.  For all my experience at the different pita jungles I would give them a 4 or 4.5 (excluding the 7th st and Missouri location).    I live very close to the 7th st location and have been there about seven times since they have opened.  Every one of the seven times something has not been right (service bad, food bad, got the wrong order, out of what I ordered, etc.).  On top of that I find it weird that all the other locations plate everything the same but this location.  The last time I was there I got the black bean burger (which has always been very good).  This burger on the other hand was terrible - I have never had a black bean burger anywhere that was as bad as this one.  On top of that I ordered it for lunch and instead of taking 15 minutes like normal it took 45 minutes. The manager said they had to make it from scratch cause they were out (they must of winged it because it was literally all black bean with none of the other ingredients) and that's why it took so long.  I ate two bites of it, it was terrible! He assured me he would take care of it and it would reflect on the bill.  Needless to say I didn't see him again and the bill was not adjusted.  I was frustrated so I just paid and left.  After seven bad experiences in the short time it's been open I would rather drive downtown or 44th st and Indian school where I can count on the quality of food and service I have come to expect from pita jungle."}
{"text":"I am so glad there is one of these on the West side! whenever I go to classes in Tempe I go here, and now I can go anytime I like for lunch. Love trying new things and have never been disappointed!"}
{"text":"This place had the WOW! factor of my first Chipotle.   I had a few tapas which were great appetizers for less than $5, but I was not prepared for the awesomeness of the Veggie Garden wrap.   Firstly, it was HUGE! And the quality of the food was so high that I couldnt finish it! A wonderful blend of veggies that is way beyond your iceberg lettuce/ tomato/ onion joke of a wrap that most places serve. A Savory sauce holds it all together from the inside, while a great tortilla hugs it together externally.   The service was great.   The art was great.  The atmosphere was hip, artistic, and classy"}
{"text":"Thank you Thank you Thank you Pita Jungle for having gluten free options!!!! We absolutely enjoyed our lunch! I had to have gluten free because of my allergy and I totally enjoyed the nachos and hard apple cider!!! My husband had the hummus and ate every bit!! We will definitely be back.  And our server was outstanding, which is always a big plus!!!!"}
{"text":"Great location, I love the indoor and outdoor bar. Food is consistently fresh and prepared to standards. Happy hour prices are great. I love pita jungle!"}
{"text":"So delicious! I saw the word pita and thought it sounded good for lunch. I was expecting more of a grab and go place but was pleasantly surprised to find a really cool restaurant with a great patio. Delicious food and great prices."}
{"text":"Great food! We were on vacation and ate at this place twice in a week the Gyros are great and I also really liked the veggie burger! So good thinking about it makes my mouth water. The place is big and spacious and it's kid friendly."}
{"text":"Just returned from dinner....I thought maybe they had changed hands.  Nothing seemed really good.  Service was mediocre, the place was freezing, and I ordered a broiled chicken salad that was chicken that had been made very much in advance and was dried out and not crisp.  I hope this was an off nite because we would hesitate to return."}
{"text":"Are you kidding me?  This place is the best.  Healthy, tasty, good food that wont kill you."}
{"text":"Before I moved away 5 years ago, Pita Jungle was one of the last spots I HAD to have before I departed. It was always one of my favorites. As I was driving down Southern yesterday, wandering aimlessly through the city trying to find my way around again, I stumbled upon a new Pita Jungle location that wasn't here before, and, immediately flipped the car around and found the shadiest spot possible.   The decor is simple and very open, lots of windows and funky paintings on the wall. I remember the Chandler and Tempe locations being a little cluttered, but I suppose things have changed. We started with the falafel platter, which consists of 5 crispy chickpea croquettes on a bed of greens, they were cooked perfect and the flavor was great. I opted for the Lavosh Shawarma Wrap - Grilled chicken breast, tomatoes, onions, and garlic sauce, wrapped in lavosh bread and wood-fired, served with a greek salad. It was delicious, exactly as I remembered. I also had a mango-banana-pineapple smoothie, which was awesome and super refreshing on a hot day. The waitstaff were friendly and helpful and had everything out and ready within a reasonable time frame.   The fact that this place has an open kitchen totally does it for me. I love it when I am able to watch the chefs prepare my food, and see how they maneuver around their kitchen.   No complaints from me, I have and always will love Pita Jungle."}
{"text":"The gyro was good; I did learn that they have a tapas hour during later hours after the main dinner rush. I stayed and ran a tapas tab...tried the Shrimp w/ Ajo Sauce which was delicious!  recommended to the owner to think about placing it on the main menu as a full entree!"}
{"text":"I love Pita Jungle's food (service is another story)!! Never had a bad meal. And what I love most of all is the lemon dressing they use on the Greek salad. It's soooo light and refreshing. The only thing I don't like is that they don't serve pepperochini with it. I could eat those things whole! Pita Jungle where are my peppers??  Anyway, as far as the service, I've gotta agree w/ Robert A. At both the Shea and Indian School locations, the service is very spotty. In fact, I was just at the Shea location last night, and after being seated outside...in the sun....we were not greeted by our server for 7 min! Ummmm....no water....no iced tea.....not even a \"hello I'll be right with you\"!!! On the flip side, the kitchen is lightening fast. No kidding, our food was at our table shortly after we finally got our iced tea!  The Indian School location is worse for service. Because the location is so small, its like the servers are pissy just so you'll want to leave and they can rotate your table!"}
{"text":"Us tukee girls don't always make it out to Fashion Square for shopping.  With the Chandler mail just a hop, skip, and a jump down the 202, that ends up being the usual mall of choice, simply out of convenience (and being a pretty good mail, too).  However, when we do make it to Scottsdale, you better believe we try to get as much shopping in as our feet, and our credit cards, will allow.  Last Sunday was no different as far as the shopping goes, however when we decided to get a snack and made our way to the food court, I was silently dreading having to eat food court food.  I wanted to Yelp about somewhere delicious, darnit!  Then, just as I was sizing up my options . . . there it was . . . could it really be?!  Did that sign say 'Pita Jungle?'  By golly, it did!!  BTW, Pita Jungle is another thing we tukesters have to make a special trip for.  Must have been my lucky day!!  After trying to decide what my sister and I were going to split (so that we could partake in more than one plate of deliciousness) we went with the Mediterranean Chicken Salad and the Hummus with Chicken.  She got the Lemonade and I got a fruity Green Tea.    Everything was fabulous.  The salad had so many fun flavors going on and just the right amount of dressing to hint at flavor, but not weigh it down or make it soggy.  The hummus with chicken was huge!  The seasoned chicken on the hummus was juicy and very nicely seasoned.  The pitas that came with were not my favorite, but hey I didn't really need the extra bread anyway.  We couldn't finish it all, and didn't really want to carry it around the mall to take it home, but I was still happy that we got it (though feeling a little guilty for being wasteful).  In the end, a successful shopping trip and a great meal!  What more could this Yelper ask for?"}
{"text":"YUMMMM!! love this place so good! Place is clean, and in a part of downtown not super busy. I like the ambiance and went for happy hour. The tapas plates were not to generous though next time ill get an actual entree plate. Really good flavored food! yum will be back!"}
{"text":"Pita jungle is \"OK\" at best, I'm Egyptian/Lebanese myself so i know what this food should taste like, Pita jungle do make a good attempt but the food is defeinitley not authentic, \"BUT THEY DO NOT CLAIM TO BE AUTHENTIC EITHER\", so maybe my personal expectations are just too high!!  but i must say\" the Hummus is mediocre and the the pitas don't seem very fresh!"}
{"text":"We have eaten here a few times. The food is ok, it's healthy. The workers are friendly.  The place is clean, ok.   The prices are high for the sizes. There aren't many ingredients on most dishes, they are simple so I feel the price is a bit high for what you get.   My 1 start is because 2 times I called in food to go late at night. When I get home my chicken was uncooked inside. It was cold like if it was frozen before. One time is not good, twice is unacceptable!"}
{"text":"Amazing food!! The cilantro jalape√±o hummus is delicious and the gyro is my go to when I can't decide (not to mention the fresh lemonade). Very healthy choices for kids too which is hard to find when going out to eat. Service is hit or miss but never bad."}
{"text":"I went here in July while visiting Arizona. Being vegetarian I had to check this place out. I ordered a large hummus. I was short on time but within 10-15 minutes received my food promptly with great customer service. I recommend this place."}
{"text":"Alway stop when we're in town. Amazing fresh food. Really good prices. Friendly  service.  Drink menu has a good variety as well."}
{"text":"This is my first time eating here!! No I believe that in a review there should be everything from food to ambience and scenery involved. So here we go.  I've always been apprehensive in going here bc I don't care for gyros. So I went today to try out the food and I was surprised.  I got the Chicken Tikka Masala. It was very good. The sauce was right now. Perfect flavor profiles. Just the right amount of salt and spice. The chicken was delicious had been marinated and flavored on it's own. I was impressed. And the rice wasn't dry! Very good.  The energy of the place was perfect for lunch. That's when I went. Energy, fast paced and great. The service was awesome. Always attentive on the drinks being filled. And the food getting out quick.   And my favorite part. A lot of great looking guys. Very handsome. Girls and gays would love it here. And I'm sure the girls were pretty but I didn't notice. I will be going back for the scenery and the delicious food."}
{"text":"yep, it's certainly a vegan hooters, lots of eye candy, not a lot to offer service wise. what is up with that? there are plenty of non mush-headed hipster types who would probably love to work there. but i guess they have such a following management doesn't care? too bad.  anyway, food is pretty good --i love the chicken pasta salad (order with added feta and extra dressing) or the macro platter-- but not to die for. if you're super in to hummus and falafel and the like, then try King Tuts, Sabuddy, Haji Baba or Oasis...all serve the same type of food more authentically and are all within 5 miles of this place.  if i'm seriously craving this food, i usually order pick up (be sure to check your food before you leave, as everyone has mentioned, they seriously suck at their jobs, and nothing's worse than getting home to find you have hummus and no pita, or pasta salad with no dressing). and they also deliver! no kidding, it takes forever and like i said, you're probably going to get screwed out of something...but if you absolutely can't get out of bed, this is the best hangover food ever."}
{"text":"Excellent service.. management goes the extra mile to go the extra mile, whatever that means!  I like the lavosh pizza but nothing is as good as the grilled chicken with garlic sauce.. thx Pita J."}
{"text":"Just ordered 2 medeteranian salads and one grilled chicken salad. Should have labeled the grilled chicken the burnt chicken salad. Could only eat half the chicken on my salad. The mediterranean turned out good. Paid $39 for takeout and feel let down since the 'grilled chicken' is what got me to order. Maybe next time it will be cooked right, or at least someone will notice if black chicken is going out."}
{"text":"We had a great experience here. The waitress helped us find some good options for my niece, who is vegan. She was very knowledgeable and friendly. I had the jalape√±o cilantro hummus and it was really good! Everyone who tried it liked it. Service was fast too!"}
{"text":"Great place,  just wish they had Stevia as a sweetener there.  They have it at their Nortera location."}
{"text":"If it was not for the convenient location next to a movie theater, I would surely never eat here. However, since it is the only place serving food at an affordable price for a teenager at the location, you get to hear about their sodium filled sauces, above mediocre service, and bland taste. I have had just about everything vegan on their menu. The rice and lentils are bland and tasteless, their potatoes are drenched in a sodium barbecue-esque sauce, and their veggie burgers are overpriced, too large, and not very tasty.  The service is usually alright with an occasional good experience.  At happy hour their tapas are usually a good deal, and go nicely with their $2 Margaritas. I recommend them.  Otherwise, get in the car after a movie and go somewhere nice."}
{"text":"I would give 3.5 stars if I could.  My friend and I tried this place for lunch one day.  The place is modern and has a comfortable feel.  We were seated promptly and started off with Chai Tea Latte which....wasn't really my favorite.    My friend had the Beef Gyro which she really loved.  I honestly did not care for it but Mediterranean food was never my favorite from the beginning so I trust/value my friend's opinion more.    I had the Pesto Pizza with chicken with the recommendation of the waitress.  I thought it was just ok.  The pizza was tiny and had not much flavor.  Again, I thought it was because I'm not used to the Mediterranean food but my friend didn't care for it either.    *Location = close to the stores *Ambiance = very comfortable  *Service = a little unreliable.  we were served wrong dishes first and they had to take it back. *Food = not my favorite...as for my friend who is into healthy food, her rating was around 3.5 *Price = Ok"}
{"text":"Pita Jungle is the best!  Great food, service and prices!!! I typically go to this location but they are all consistently good with food and service. I typically order the same things all the time (ahi tuna app, babaganoosh, flavored hummus, crispy cauliflower, chicken lavash, broiled chicken salad) food is delicious and perfect every time. Always crave the food! When I don't know what I want, I go here. Pita Jungle never disappoints! Do yourself a favor and eat here! I could eat here every day!"}
{"text":"I work down the street from this Pita Jungle location and a lot of times people just settle for what's next door from their work just to get by, but that's not the case here.   I love their menu and it has so many options to pick from. Friendly for everyone including for those who don't eat meat. This location is very cleaned and customer service rocks! If you choose to dine here you'll leave with a full tummy and a smile on your face :o)  A+"}
{"text":"Management contacted me sent me, apologized, talked to waitress, etc. They were great about handling the issues. So now back in love with Pita Jungle... all is right in the world."}
{"text":"Love PIta Jungle for lunch!  What an amazing menu they have, so much to choose from!  I love their gyros and beans!  I also love that they have smaller selections so you can share a few items or just order something small for a child!    It is a perfect place to meet someone for lunch, so delicious and the prices are very reasonable!"}
{"text":"We are big fans of Pita Jungle but this one is by FAR our favorite.  The staff here is wonderful, they are all so attentive and personable.  Our 4 year old picks P.J, every weekend when it is time to decide where to eat.  I love that their kids menu has such great options for her.  My husband and I always have a hard time deciding what to get because the menu is just fantastic.  We love going during Happy Hour and taking advantage of the smaller plates.  We just discussed after our last visit how impressed we were that we each had a meal, a kids meal, an appetizer, a soft drink and a happy hour drink and with tip our bill was right under $30."}
{"text":"Sylvia was our server and she did a terrific job! The food was perfect, the atmosphere was casual and sort of trendy. The place was clean and a little noisey.  A solid 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Great Salmon Burger and Potatoes. Amazing strawberry smoothie too.. ! Love it"}
{"text":"Love the food and variety here! The atmosphere is artsy and the people colorful. The parking is tight - get here before the lunch rush starts around 11:30am. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Service was very slow. Had to stop waiter several time to ask for drinks and food. Sauce on salad was very minimal.  Only order side order of humus took over 30 minutes to receive."}
{"text":"Pita Jungle is a pretty solid place in my book. My 4-star rating is for my overall experience here over a few visits. Tonight probably would have been more like 3.5 stars. I really didn't feel like cooking tonight because that would require me to go grocery shopping so I recommended to my fianc√© to grab dinner here.   We sat out on the patio because we probably won't be able to sit outside at night for much longer because this summer heat is creeping up fast.   From the seasonal menu, we ordered the avocado hummus. Why? Because I was telling myself it was healthy fats so it made myself feel better about eating all that pita bread with it.   For my entree, I went with the chicken tikka masala. I went with it because my boss always orders it so I wanted to give it a try. Honestly, I'm not sure if I would order it again. It tasted fine but I wish it had a little bit of spice to it and also, it was just somewhat warm when it got to the table. I think my plate was warmer than my food. The brown rice seemed like it was cooked with not enough water so it ended up a bit drier than it should be.   My fianc√© made a smarter selection tonight. He went with the chipotle chicken lavosh pizza. I had a slice of it and made a mental note to get it next time."}
{"text":"The food is alright.  Nothing to get too excited about other than that it is healthy.  The service can be spotty."}
{"text":"Excellent.  Worth all the hype. Get the cilantro hummus and the baklava. You will not regret it.  Everything is pretty fresh and tasty."}
{"text":"I had a one-star experience at this location over 4 years ago, and have mostly avoided this place.  The rotten experience, driving anywhere near campus, and snaking my way around the choo-choo helped.   But my most recent visit back was QUITE GOOD!    A large group of us came for the reverse happy hour.  To my surprise, it wasn't very busy (that's why the reverse happy hour bozo!) .    If you haven't tried it, every item on special is only a few bucks.  Between the 10+ of us, we sampled everything on the happy hour menu.  And everything was fresh and delicious!  On top of that, the servers were friendly and attentive.   Of course we also ordered non special items like the baklava sundae!  I'm going back just for that!  (and the Cilantro Jalape√±o Hummus)  Pita Jungle in Tempe, you're back on my good list."}
{"text":"Good food, good service. I even got a nutrition menu when I asked for it (the nutrition info is available on their web site but it is not very easy to read on the smart phone screen).  I wish they has some options for health conscious people and those items were listed in a separate section (say under 500 calories, or 700 calories)."}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat in Tempe!  The atmosphere is always perfect; not too loud, but still noisy enough with the good music to be enjoyable. I love the rotating art collection, because it gives me something new to look at every time I come.  The food is so good. I've only ever had one thing that I didn't like (the chicken pasta salad), but It's been a 10 for me every other time. The Glazed Chicken Lavosh Pizza is my favorite dish with the Fruit Fantasia at a close second."}
{"text":"I love Pita Jungle.  All of them.  Everytime I come to visit my parents in AZ and I fly into Sky Harbor, on our way up to Payson I beg my driver's to indulge me.  I have tried to re-create their hummus, but I can't -- it is truly amazing, so smooth and delicious.  And the price is right -- try a comparable \"upscale\" place and you would be paying triple the price.  The salads are awesome.  I am a big fan of the Lentil Fatoosh, the Broiled Chicken, the Honey Pasta, and the Greek Salad.  The fresh and light dressings are awesome.  As for the Pitas, the California Beach Club is awesome.  And their smoothies, so freakin' good.  And their iced tea is not your run of the mill stuff either.  Service has always been fine, and when it has been lacking, the food has always made up for it.  I live in Chicago and I wish they would open an outlet here, because we have nothing like it here.  We are the city of big asses with our deep dish pizza, hot dogs, and sausages.  I miss you, Pita Jungle!"}
{"text":"We have been to many Pita Jungle around the city and without question this Pita Jungle is by far the best! the dining room is much more spacious much more comfortable. the ambience of the room is outstanding. the restaurant is surrounded by ceiling to floor windows what you live for sightseeing and natural light. I have one drawback in that if you were to eat at the bar you may find it to be quite loud because the kitchen is open and it's right behind you.  We really enjoy the food and the setting."}
{"text":"Had the Hummus with chicken and it was awesome!!!! Was able to get half regular hummus/ half cilantro jalapeno hummus (which was great!). Had a falafel pita which was pretty good also. Waitress was very attentive and it was crowded. Will definitely go to again ."}
{"text":"My wife and I came to Pita jungle after movie and we were thoroughly delighted. Our servers name was Sarah and she took care of us and did an excellent job. We had avocado hummus and chicken and it was terrific. I highly recommend Pita jungle at Norterra. Mark was the manager and made us feel very comfortable. Again a big shout out to Sarah our server. Well done"}
{"text":"Don't be afraid to try new things! Lentil fetoosh plus chicken is amazing with fried pita chips! The iced green tea is spectacular! My husband loves the Mahi Mahi and the chicken shawarma. The gyros are great! So is the hummus plate. Pretty good for a date! Weekdays get there before 8!"}
{"text":"Pretty good food, although its kinda loud inside, and you can't drink outside. I agree, too much cred. The food is okay, but the lousy drop out student service SUCKS."}
{"text":"Please be aware: the serving sizes here are Ginormous! So share most items - - including the side salads unless that is all you're getting.  Hummus is super good (and I'm pretty picky on this front).  Though when getting a wrap (I got the chicken version at the Waterfront mall), I probably would get the sauce on the side (it was abundant) as well as the pickles.  Maybe it's just me, but I've never had pickles served on a Mediterranean wrap before?!  All in all, quick, good and on the healthy side :)   PS, I hear there is a humus trio that's not on the menu that's damn good!  Cheers"}
{"text":"LOVE Pita Jungle! Healthy (at least it tastes healthy!) and flavorful. I love their pia bread, it's always fresh and hot! Service is always so prompt. I've had all of their Gyro's and I add feta to the ones that it doesnt come with and kalamata olives as well. So tasty!"}
{"text":"The waitress service was good, but the salad had no dressing. When I asked for more they brought me a tiny amount the size of a tablespoon. When I asked for more they said it would take 5 minutes to make. After 10 minutes I gave up and returned the food. The Manager did not even come over to discuss the issue. Avoid this Pita Jungle and go to another one as most are pretty good."}
{"text":"***Thank you for graciously reaching out to me and making me feel better about revisiting this location. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Didn't know what to expect here.  We saw one of their shops while driving around.  When we google mapped the one on Tatum Blvd it was a little hard to find as it's hidden in an office building complex.  The food was okay and could be better with some instructions.  If you get the spanakopita tell them to keep it in the oven until the top layers are crisp.  The beef gyro was surprisingly good............but skip the garlic potatoes.  They were not crisp and they were garlicky.  Service was pleasant, but a little slow."}
{"text":"Not bad. Not crazy fantastic Mediterranean food but not bad either. A little pricey though."}
{"text":"You won't want to share the spanakopita.  You may not even want to share the hummus, and this comes from a person who categorically doesn't like it.  The food is great and the service too.  Oh and the patio...a tranquil relief to a harried work-day."}
{"text":"Love this place.  The concept, food, service are all good.  Started out by discovering the Tempe location, but have visited all of the other ones as well and love them just the same.  Though everything is good, my fave dishes are the grilled chicken hummus (red + green) and the salmon salad."}
{"text":"One of my favorite pita jungle locations - great service, large space, and as all the other pita jungles, great food. I just wish the steamed muscles we're on the main menu. Waitress suggested the baklava bread pudding and it was very good."}
{"text":"Love pita jungle!!!! Hummus cilantro jalape√±o is my favorite, with ice green tea. You can't go wrong with anything on their menu. And if you are here during happy hour, they have a great tapas selection. Kids menu is a good portion and they have coloring/activity books and crayons for the kids."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat in Phoenix.  Easy on my waistline and delicious!"}
{"text":"Oh man, super side about this Pita Jungle experience. Generally, I love everything about Pita Jungle but not today.  First, ordering over the phone for take-out was kind of a nightmare. I had to rephrase my order three times to make sure the girl understood that I was ordering 2 gyros with all veggies on the side. If you don't order it this way, the veggies get gross and soggy. I also ordered a side of garlic potatoes and the lemon-cilantro mixed bean as well as two drinks: coke and green tea. They don't have Coca Cola products so Pepsi had to do. While this isn't a big deal, it added to the bummer experience I had.   When I arrived, my food was ready and I was happy to see veggies were on the side. I took a sip of my green tea to realize it wasn't the delightful Passport tea that I crave on a regular basis. When I asked about the tea, the girl said they have recently made changes and this is one of them that the customers are not pleased about. I have to agree. Because of this change and my overall experience today, I probably won't be back. The new green tea isn't even close to as good as the last one.  I got my food home to find the meat in my gyro was burnt. I've never had this happen at Pita Jungle before. I also didn't care for the lemon cilantro mixed beans at all. Since Pita Jungle is a healthier restaurant, I was imaging this side to be light and refreshing and instead it was heavy and just not good.   I'm sad about this experience. Unfortunately, due to many things not going right I don't foresee myself ordering from them again. Bummer deal!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Always a good option. There are so many delicious items on the menu. The staff is always helpful and friendly. I highly recommend Pita Jungle to anyone in the mood for greek food. The lentil fetoosh is amazing!"}
{"text":"I frequent this location often and can say the food is consistently good, staff is friendly and attentive but my complaint is the inside restaurant. The noise factor makes it impossible to have a conversation. I always ask for outside seating but there weren't any tables available on my last visit. I was having dinner with a friend from the west Valley and we pretty much ate and ran as it was too noisy to hear each other."}
{"text":"Lot's of reviews for Pita Jungle - and I would say that the 4 Star rating average is appropriate!  Food is good, atmosphere comfortable, service decent, price reasonable ... all good!  Lot's of healthy options with a Mediterranean flair, making an excellent option for a good meal out!  I've been back several times and  recommend it regularly.  Both visits I've had seafood (a seafood stew, and salmon), both times very happy with it - and the $1.99 margaritas (all summer long special!) are a great deal!"}
{"text":"My wife and I always order the pitas here and they are outstanding!  We live at the north end of Gilbert and this particular location is at the south end of town and it's worth the drive.  There is a newer location at Val Vista and Baseline however that place is a giant noisy echo chamber of a restaurant to eat in and the kitchen noise is EXCESSIVE.   I like that you can order ahead and pick up.    The food tastes very fresh (try the baba ghanoush) and it's actually one of the few meals we buy where the food is worth it.  There is another authentic Mediterranean restaurant just a couple blocks from us, however their gyros taste nowhere near as good as Pita Jungle.  We always order take out.  I dislike eating in restaurants these days due to all the noise.  It's hard to find a quiet dining experience without screaming children."}
{"text":"Pita Jungle is one of my all time favorites, especially for a restaurant chain. They have an awesome assortment of food for people who like meat and for vegetarians and vegans.   What wins me over about Pita Jungle is their consistency with delicious food and the friendly servers.  The experience yesterday could have been a bad one, but because they were so attentive and thankful for my patience,  my overall experience was pretty good. I called in a to go order around 10:30 am and asked for it to be ready by 11:40. I arrived at 11:45 and the order was not ready. Not only was it not ready, I didn't get my order until after 12:00 pm. Two people were helping me,  I hate that I didn't get their names so they can receive kudos, and they kept me posted on the order, they were super apologetic and explained why there was a delay, they walked the food to my car and helped me check the order. I was super impressed with how they handled this situation and even though my order was late, i am more than happy to order from this location again due to the excellent service and quality food!!!"}
{"text":"Thankfully, there are too many Pita Jungle locations to settle on this mediocre one. I've been disappointed here on too many occasions to come back again. Unfortunately, this is the closest one to my house. Shouldn't the service and food be consistent at all your locations?"}
{"text":"My go to has always been the broiled chicken pita and it has never lead me astray. Perfectly cooked chicken, hummus, pickles, and other vegetables all wrapped in a warm pita. Paired with a side of the garlic potatoes- perfect.   This time I decided to switch it up and get the chicken tiki masala and I was pleasantly surprised. The same perfectly cooked chicken in a creamy coconut sauce all served over a bed of brown rice. The flavor was really nice and this is a dish I would most definitely return to.   Lastly, I absolutely hate bananas, but there is something special about the peanut butter banana smoothie. TRUST ME, it's worth the six dollars."}
{"text":"This is a great location in Ahwatukee if you're coming from the movies or seeing one after! Service and food are solid as always. This time I tried one of the seasonal dishes as an appetizer and it was really solid! Avocado, garbanzo beans, cucumber, lemon, and tomatoes served with chips! Try it before it goes out of season!   Also, they have wine Wednesday's! Half off any bottle of wine."}
{"text":"Ordered a broiled chicken salad on Friday to go. When I got home and began eating my salad, to my dismay I almost cracked a tooth on a chicken bone."}
{"text":"For healthy, fresh and god food pita jungle never disappoints. They have great variety and something for everyone. Happy hour and tapas menu will fill you up and be budget friendly. Customer service is good. We've been several times, eat here regularly. The last time we were there June 2017 it was clear the kitchen was struggling to keep up (first time ever experienced this). Our server not only acknowledged and apologized for this, but offered a free appetizer. We didn't want anything, but had planned to get a pizza to go so he comped it. Excellent customer service!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times and have tried various items on the menu from their pizzas to the hummus to their sandwiches, soups, and salads.  One definite plus is the consistency in the quality and flavor of their food.  I have yet to try anything I haven't enjoyed here.  As mentioned by other reviewers here, their portions are on the large side and if you have any dietary restrictions, they're very helpful.  The staff for the most part is friendly and accommodating.  The atmosphere is usually a little on the busy side, but relaxed.  The art work on the walls rotates and tends to be a topic of conversation between my friend and myself.  One thing for sure is that if the weather is nice, I'd suggest sitting outside simply because the tables feel a little crowded indoors and if you're looking to have a private conversation, this isn't the place for you."}
{"text":"Well ok if you are somewhat trying to eat healthy. I'm not sure this is the spot to be.  I order a chicken combo plate I missed the memo on there that it was a lot of carbs I basically ended up pulling my chicken and eating that.  It was served with beans rice and I think potatoes! Not what I had in mind when I read it.  However portions are good very large so If your hungry you will leave full.  Service was ok, slow but our waitress was nice!  It was very confusing as to who worked there and walked off the street into eat.  The place could use some deep cleaning And more attention to the servers outfits.  Our waitress however looked nice.  First impression, are so important  I don't think I would be back while in town.  Humus was good. Family didn't seem to mind the place, but not my cup of tea!"}
{"text":"Always have great Food at this location. Almost identical to the other ones I have been to solid food and atmosphere would definitely go back if i was in the area."}
{"text":"This was a refreshing delicious lunch. The only reason I'm giving them 4 and not 5 stars is I ordered their fresh lemonade, and they didn't tell me it was guava lemonade. I love guava but this lemonade tasted alcoholic:(. Their fattoush salad was amazing, it was the perfect combination of seasonings and lemon. I would definitely eat here again minus the Lemonade."}
{"text":"What's great about this place is that you get good food pretty quickly if you don't have a lot of time. It has a casual feel but the food is more of what you'd getting in a 'nicer' setting. I had the chicken shawarma, which was pretty good. It wasn't the best I ever had but it was flavorable and juicy. I thought the service was good and I like how open the dining area was. For a quick, healthy option I would definitely return here."}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE!  Try the red bell pepper hummus with chicken and pine nuts.  So good!"}
{"text":"I loved Pita Jungle as an ASU student and was elated when I saw that this location was opening up in my neighborhood a few months back.  Since it opened, I've taken every opportunity that's come up to drag uninitiated friends over to sample their flavorful and healthy offerings.  No one's walked out disappointed.  Personal favorites include the lavosh shawarma wrap, spicy chicken wrap, broiled chicken salad (a great way to load up on lean protein), and the caribbean fruit salad (massive).  The value you get from the huge portions is insane.  I love the fact PJ is open until 10 every night.  As I noted in my Arcadia Wildflower Bread Company review, beware of this plaza during weekday lunch hours: the parking situation is ridiculous."}
{"text":"Pita jungle is a Tempe tradition!  This is a great location.  Tried the uncle bears peanut butter porter, it's liquid Reeces Pieces.  Order anything wood fired.  Or their namesake pita or shawarma. It's awesome to be able to go out to eat and get some vegetables!"}
{"text":"Great healthy food. I eat here all the time and just about everything I have tried on the menu is good. I love the Philly Steak Pita. Good staff and clean restaurant. Price isn't bad for the quality you get. My only complaint is I have a large appetite and sometimes don't get full off one item."}
{"text":"Service was fantastic. Food good. Only problem was the fruit side on the kids menu was 2 grapes 1 orange wedge. We asked for more and not only got the same exact thing but were charged $1.95 extra   This is just WRONG"}
{"text":"So, I have been to this Pita Jungle many, many, (did I say many?) times before.. Never have I had such poor customer service or been treated like my patronage didn't matter.   I called in an order to pick up. You would think that ordering that way wouldn't require much in the way of customer service. Right? Well, apparently, this staff didn't think it deserves any.   I'm pretty sure the \"manager\" was one of the people I came across during this trip to Pita Jungle. I won't be coming back after today.   Upon arriving, no one was at the front of the restaurant to greet the other customers waiting or me. No problem. I was just picking up food anyway, so I went back to pick it up. Another customer arrived before me & another right behind me.   No one greeted us or came to deliver our food for over 20 minutes (and that was just the beginning). Then, a waitress came up & asked what I had after another waiter asked the first customer what she had. He just disappeared after that & I never saw him come back with her food or ring her up.   The waitress couldn't find my order & said she would ask another server if he had it. (Meanwhile, the manager had been sitting at a table talking to someone this ENTIRE time). He was facing the to go line & never asked someone to help us or made an effort to help us or any of the groups of people who came in & kept waiting to be seated.   Finally, the manager ended his long conversation & curtly asked what I had. I, once again, stated my order that was now placed over 30 minutes prior to this time. I told him that if the order wasn't already entered I would rather just leave, since I had been waiting so long already. He went to go check on it. I looked over at the place the order comes up & my order was already there when the manager went over to check. So, I decided to wait since it was already up.   However, the manager came back & told me my order was coming up. (I saw it was just sitting there, so I wondered why he didn't just bring it with him when he walked back over to us. Instead, he brought a customer's food (who just arrived). He rang him up. Then he took the order of the person who had been in line behind me & rang him up.   In the meantime, it had been 36 minutes since I called in my order. Due to the attitude of the manager & his clear lack of customer service, I finally just left without my food. Who knows when he would finally bring me my food & it had been sitting out on the counter for over 15 minutes without being refrigerated or anything. That's how people get food poisoning. It had chicken in it.   I've NEVER, EVER left a restaurant without my food before. This was the worst customer service I have received at this restaurant & pretty much anywhere. The food isn't that good to go through all of this hassle. I won't be back. I can promise you that."}
{"text":"I never have a bad meal at Pita Jungle. While I go to the one at Desert Ridge and the original in Tempe, the Arrowhead location is the one I most frequent. The servers are always very nice and attentive. I usually get the Macro plate or the spicy chicken pita. A side of garlic potatoes is my usual side. The hummus is great, though, I think True Food does their hummus better. The decaf berry tea is yummy and hits the spot. But the thing I really love and just discovered is the kid's menu. If you want your kid to eat healthy, this is the meal to get and they will eat it. I select one protien (chicken, legumes, garden burger, etc) a Green (carrots, broccoli, spinach, ect) and a Carb (12 grain bread, mac/cheese, pita.) Its $4.99 and served on a tray with four compartments (the fourth holds a little fruit medley.) I can go there and have a healthy, delicious meal and also feed my one-year old something other than grilled cheese or hot dog.  Someday, I need to try the Caribbean Salad. It looks delish. I love fruit and coconut. I will keep going back and so glad they have locations around the Valley."}
{"text":"They just opened a new Pita Jungle near my work. I've had the opportunity to visit 3 times now. Twice for lunch, and once for dinner.   Let me start out by saying, the primary focus of a restaurant should always be the food. You are going to eat.   But the secondary focus is the experience. The reason you pay more, and leave a tip is for the experience.   I can say, hands down, every single Pita Jungle I visit, the food is extraordinary, and the service is awful.   Let's start with the latter, so we can end on a high note. They have a very relaxed vibe, which can sometimes make it hard to figure out who is a server, and who is just looking for the bathrooms. They dress like a hipsters paradise, which is fine, but at the very least a name tag, or apron would REALLY help when trying to track down a server.   More recently when I visited for dinner with my folks, we had a young lady, who I assume was named \"Karma\" based on her necklace. She was nice enough. I arrived separate from my parents, so she brought me a drink. I had to flag her down to order an appetizer. Once my parents arrived,  she brought them their drinks and we literally did not see her again for 15 minutes. Not anywhere. She either has an invisibility cloak, or was trying to eat or... something. When we finally ordered, it took another 20 minutes for our food to arrive (1 soup, and 1 pesto pasta?). To her credit, she did refill my fathers lemonade multiple times, and brought him a \"fresh one\" when it looked watered down. But this was par for the course. I warned my folks about the lackluster service.   Now for the food. Everything I have ever had a Pita Jungle has been wonderful. I love the Red Pepper Hummus, as well as the Cilantro Jalapeno. Occasionally the pitas are a bit stale, but at 50 cents a pop, I can't complain. My \"go-to\" order is the Falafel Hot Pita. It's majestic. All the flavor you could ask for. (though once they forgot the Tahini and it was dry as all heck but still flavorful) I also recently fell in love with the Pesto Pasta. The right amount of Heavy to fill me up, the the right amount of light so I don't feel FULL.   All in all, if they could imrpove their service, even just slightly, I'd bump them another star."}
{"text":"I am not a fan of this type of food, however, the meal I got was OK, and the rest of the party really enjoyed theirs, so I am not reviewing on the food. (because looking at all of the reviews, people love this place!) I will review the service though: We had a party of 7 ladies getting together to catch up. Drinks were delivered promptly and the server was really nice. Plates were cleared as needed. So far that was nice. However, there were a few things that bugged me. One, half of us ordered a bowl of soup along with our entrees. As we waited, I figured he must have forgotten them. Nope- they were delivered with all of our entrees! So we had bowls and plates and going from side to side to eat them all. (If I go to a steakhouse and order a steak, baked potatoe and a salad- I would get my salad first, right? Is this concept lost at this place?) The soups should have been served as an appetizer.  The other thing I dropped a star for is that the server never asked if we wanted separate checks. Just dropped the check in the middle of the table and we had to add, subtract, some put in cash, some credit cards, etc. That itself is annoying to the guests. Computer systems these days can easily separate checks, and especially with a group of women who usually prefer it, it can actually be a time saver. (women usually like separate checks while men will take turns picking up the tab) It would have been nice to at least be asked our preference. Will I go again? Only if friends want to, but I'm in no hurry."}
{"text":"This place has the best pita bread and hummus.. I also love their veggie burrito! Yum"}
{"text":"I love Pita Jungles menu. They have so many great healthy options for people with dietary restrictions. Today my daughter and I came in around happy hour and loved the tapas menu, it was super affordable and great portions. Our waiter was really friendly and noticed when I had the wrong salad brought out to me before I even said anything. We'll come back to eat there again for sure!"}
{"text":"Good food, great service. Definitely not traditional middle eastern food, but we enjoyed it. I loved the chocolate covered baklava."}
{"text":"This is one of my 'go to' places when I am looking for a casual, low cost lunch or dinner. All of the hummus selections are tasty. I usually treat myself to the chicken & hummus with a combination of the cilantro & pepper hummus. The food and vibe is great. I would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Last place I'm going to try in Glendale,AZ before I leave in 3 hours =[ Well so I came here for lunch...before taking off for an 6 hours drive back to Costa Mesa...  The menu featured many foods that didn't sound very Mediterranean to me so I decided to be adventurous and try the Mediterranean Plate....which i have no idea what half the stuff are for $10 ...well it was a really big plate with green beans, hummus, two other types of hummus-like sauce, some kind of rice wrapped in leaves, fried veggie cake of some sort and a whole lot of chopped cilantro and parley and tomatoes mix served with two pita bread. I took a look at it and didn't even know where to start...i didn't exactly eat it the right way...you were suppose to put everything onto the pita bread and eat it like a sandwich..but instead i ate them individually. it was very interesting at first and everything had a unique taste...but after like a few spoonfuls of the stuff... everything started tasting very lemony..they use a whole lot of lemon juice in the green beans...and the cilantro-parsley-tomato mixture and the eggplant puree as well. The pita was good dipped in the hummus and what i believe was eggplant puree.. the fried veggie cake thing was okay when dipped into the third kind of sauce.  It was a fairly big plate of food so I ate only a little because i got tired of the lemon juice taste...it's only good in small doses... my bf ordered the chicken pita with a side of garlic potatoes. The chicken pita was good but the garlic potatoes lacked garlic taste to me. We also had ordered Spanakopita - which is layers of flaky crisp fill dough stuffed with spinach and feta cheese...it was like $4 for 2! kinda expensive and small....and it wasn't very good either..it was a little dry.  Service was pretty good...the waitress came around a few good times to check on us even though they got pretty busy.   Would like to come back and try other things =]"}
{"text":"Yum! You know you're in trouble when you get hungry and immediately log on to yelp to find out where you are going to eat. But you haven't done me wrong yelp, in recommending Pita Jungle.   Today I had a lunch of baba ghanoush and the pita pizza. There was plenty of BG left for me to take home, but the pizza was gone in almost an instant. Let's not debate this in the classic Chicago vs New York style, this is a pita with pizza toppings on it, not brain surgery. But the ingredients were what made the meal. FRESH. the spinach was not previously frozen, the tomatoes were firm and juicy, the mushrooms were not out of a can! there was a touch of feta, and just the right pizza spices.   It was small, pita bread small, but that's cool, just because I want to eat like a pig doesn't mean I should...all of the assorted staff who approached me were friendly and the service was quick. I will be back for falafel, for pesto pizza, for the macro platter and a couple of the other sandwiches that looked good."}
{"text":"I was so excited to hear that PJ opened next to my work!  I love how trendy the decor is and the food is even better!  I could eat that grilled chicken and hummus everyday if I could!  Last time I tried the Grilled Veggie salad, it was a large portion and delish!"}
{"text":"Dined here with my customers. It is an Arizona a chain and my felafel sandwich was good.  The felafel and veggies were great but the pita bread was a bit boring and I did not eat it.  My thighs say thank you.   I like the decor and recommend trying.  The sales and wraps looked marvelous. Recommend."}
{"text":"I come to this location regularly and have previously had pretty good food. However, this is the second time that I've order my meal and gotten home to find out that my food didn't look right. I literally spent about 7 min picking \"burnt sauteed onions\" out of my philly chicken pita. What I can't understand is, as a cook/chef how you can throw that on someone's plate and then send it out of the kitchen and be proud of that presentation. The first time it happened, I called and spoke to the manager. However, I shouldn't have to do that if everyone in the kitchen was on their A-game. No one wants to eat burnt food, especially since I've spent my good, hard earned money. It is clearly a reflection of the establishment and the people that's being hired to cook the food. Needless to say, I am extremely disappointed with this location. I'm trying my best to give this location a second try, but I'm leaning towards driving a few more miles to one of the Scottsdale locations.   I won't even go into detail on the service at the bar. It depends on the day, but there's one really nice girl and the others need to be fired along with the cook!"}
{"text":"Amazing staff - very friendly and super attentive. Food is lovely and great for sharing  Not authentic if you are not from America but really good if you don't know better"}
{"text":"Love Pita Jungle. The food is tasty and healthy... you can't lose. My only complaint is that they should have better pita since you know... it's in the name. I can buy better pita at Sprouts."}
{"text":"Summary: delicious food, relaxed atmosphere, attentive and friendly staff....and as someone who has a lot of kids to feed, it is cheaper then McDonalds to feed them and so much healthier!  We have tried many of the dishes and my favorite is ole faithful, the gyro. You have to spurge for a side and get their broccoli. Steamed is great but their seared is just ridiculous.    They have great drinks too for dinner, drinks and a movie. They have a pineapple mixed drink that is tasty and potent."}
{"text":"I've never been anything but complete satisfied with the food and service at Pita Jungle. I'd recommend them to anyone interested in a great, healthy meal."}
{"text":"I really want to love Pita Jungle.  The food has always been consistently good.  In turn, the service has been dependably terrible.  This location takes the cake.  The following gripes may seem like an overreaction and, if isolated, may be.  It's just too bad that this type of service is par for the course at the Jungle.  The host was fine.  A nice enough kid, if a little in over his head.  It was a weekend afternoon and the crowd was accordingly large.  We were finally seated and our waiter was the requisite bored, slightly laconic twentysomething.  He took our drink and food order and promptly disappeared for an hour.  Seriously, we didn't see him again until it was time for the check and all he could muster was a weak apology muttered under his breath.  We did, however, get the unique pleasure of being assigned the hippest of hip female servers who brought us our food complete with a side of smug irony and a nasty case of stink eye.  At this time, we had to ask the totally overwhelmed host for silverware.  Nobody ever bothered to offer us drink refills.    If I wanted to be surrounded by a bunch of kids who don't care about their jobs, I'd go to Joe's Crab Shack.   Whatever -  I'll probably still go back."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to hit up if I want something healthy. It can be a bit pricey but I love that they have to go ordering so that I can call ahead on my way home from the gym and just stop by and pick it up."}
{"text":"Probably won't go again. Got take out and wasn't happy with the quality of the food. Got a tiny $6 piece of carrot cake that was frozen solid. Hummus was not good."}
{"text":"My Co workers  love this restaurant  but I am not a big fan . Decided  to give it another  try . The chicken  was moist and tender  but not much flavor . I like my food more spicy sorry"}
{"text":"Food is excellent, every time very fresh. The portions are quite large, yum always have leftovers. The califlower with camelized onions with tihini sauce is really good. The concrete floors make it a bit noisy, but atmosphere is nice. The servers on many occasions have been just ok. Great vegetarian choices, been there for lunch or dinner both excellent."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today and everything I ate was amazing! For an appetizer we ordered the cilantro jake pano hummus. It wasn't too spicy, it had the right amount of \"kick\" to it. For lunch, I ordered the Greek salad and I added chicken to it. The chicken was moist and had excellent flavor. No dry chicken on my salad. I also had their sangria, and they have the best sangrias!!!"}
{"text":"I love pita jungle! Sometimes the service isn't the best here but overall I've had avoid experience. I love their sangrias and I love their grilled chicken. My son loves their Mac n cheese. We always get the turtle cheesecake when we come here."}
{"text":"Poor service. Ordered a cocktail which hadn't arrived by the time the food did.  I canceled the cocktail, explaining that I'd expected it earlier. So the food server starts to walk away with the food!  We made sure he didn't.  Later, asked for some feta for a salad.  Never arrived.  Awful service; will not return."}
{"text":"Had one of the best servers ever! I wish I got his name. But we were there last Saturday for lunch. He was ON it - I didn't even notice my ice tea was refilled until I went to take a sip and then he even asked if we wanted to-go cups when we were getting ready to leave. He didn't bother us unnecessarily but was always there too...how'd he do that? AWESOME! (He also came running out when my friend left her cc .)   The food was DELICIOUS as well. I had the Shwarma - which is a hot pita with roasted chicken and all kinds of other goodness (hehe, I forget - but look it up on their menu). It was a good portion too, no skimping on meat or filling. The chicken was marinated to perfection, tangy and full of flavor. I was delightfully surprised. The pita itself wasn't dry either like I've had at other places. I ate the whole thing and am craving more right now.   This location has a nice outdoor seating area as well as a jumble of indoor seating with not much privacy ..but at least the sound doesnt carry too much. We had a baby with us and sat inside, and we were comfortable. Gets busy during the lunch hour - though they said it'd take 15 mins for a table and we only waited maybe 5.   I'm already wanting to go back."}
{"text":"Pita jungle is a great place for some excellent food at a cheap price. I frequent this restaurant on a weekly basis, and each time I am welcomed with a smile and acknowledged within seconds of arrival regardless of how incredibly busy they are. If you want great food accompanied with great service then pita jungle us a great place for you to try out."}
{"text":"While I've only been here once with some coworkers for Happy Hour, I think this place has a lot of good attributes to make it a place to come back to.  I liked the fact that it wasn't too loud to have a nice conversation during happy hour.  We ordered drinks and got the Hummus Trio, Babbaganoush, and some pita.  The first batch of pita was cold but nice and soft.  We quickly ate it up dipping it in the hummus and Babba.  The different types of hummus were very flavorful.  The happy hour prices on the appetizers were great but our server told us the servings were only enough for one person (so not really for sharing).  We asked for more pita and then got a few whole pitas which were warm.  When they cooled, however, they got hard...not very appetizing.    Servers were friendly and checked in with us often enough.   It wasn't too crowded when we were there (between 4 and 6 on Friday) but busy enough.  We didn't have too many other things to eat but the menu looked interesting--I definitely would like to come back.    One tip: there is a parking garage with free parking across the alley from this place.  It doesn't have a lot of spaces but probably is best for late afternoon to early evening."}
{"text":"I had a great meal at this restaurant.  I was appalled at the hostess.  She was wearing 'Daisy Duke' shorts, her butt cheeks were hanging out and the suspenders she was wearing kept pulling her shorts up into her rear end.  Our table was close to where she was standing and we were constantly seeing her put her fingers into the back of her shorts and pull them out of her crack.  Now normally I would not be upset but she was setting tables with silverware and giving out menu's with those hands she kept sticking up her butt crack and I couldn't help thinking \"How much fecal matter is she passing along to the patrons\" which caused me to stop eating, pay my bill and decide I would not be coming back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"What a disappointing experience. I went in on 10/8/2012 for a late lunch. The crew is so disappointed to see anyone outside of rush hour. It is the most unwelcoming feeling. I could not sit down because of the filthy seat. My husband had to find something to wipe down my booth seat before I could sit down. The busser didn't even seem to notice that there was dirty seats at every table he cleaned. The floor under one table was absolutely filthy. No one blinked an eye. The manager stood and stared out to the floor. He was far enough away to not see anything. Bad strategy. The server completely abandoned us after our food came. She brought me a ketchup with nothing in it and then proceeded to stand at another table and talk for five minutes. My husband had to go get some pico and tabasco for us. We finally interrupted her to get another bottle of ketchup.  I did not like my meal at all. It fell apart. It was dry. They put about a 1/4 teaspoon of hummus on it. It was a black bean burger that desperately needed salt. I had no opportunity to ask for anything to improve it because the server failed to check on us for eternity. My hubby loved his hummus and chicken dish and the caramelized cauliflower/tahini dish was out of this world delicious. That got them an additional star.  This store has completely neglected the details. Their standards have taken a serious dive. I will not be going back until they have new management in place. Cleanliness, and customer service are seriously deficient."}
{"text":"First off, 1 star off for the Lavosh.  I had the Lavosh shawarma wrap, it was super tasty, but after eating it, it felt like I had eaten an entire box of Captain Crunch aka the world's sharpest cereal, and the roof of my mouth cursed at me. Really.   The Spanakopita (Spinach/feta phyllo concoction) and the hummus were yummskis.  reasonably priced, friendly staffed, delicious fewd.  Will def return"}
{"text":"Great food great ambiance, nice staff... and very beautiful view.  I always get the Lavash Shawarma wrap!  The Chicken Lavash pizza is also very good!"}
{"text":"My new favorite place! The food here is excellent! It was my first time coming here with my friends who love it here. I tried the Hummus trio from the Tapas happy hour menu and a burger (i forgot the name of). Our server was very attentive and the vibe at the Pita Jungle is super chill! Definitely try it if you are thinking about it"}
{"text":"I love having a healthy option at the mall. Pita Jungle is one of my favorite restaurants."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch and sat at the bar. Haily was the bar tender. Super fun to talk to and gave excellent service! I will definitely be back! The only complaint I had was that they did not have a wide selection of liquor."}
{"text":"I've only been here a handful of times but every time I absolutely love it. The bartender Jeremy makes some great drinks and is always very helpful when I'm not sure what to get. Happy I moved in to this area and found a great spot like this!"}
{"text":"Nice large portions with pretty clean ingredients this place was a nice find.  My friend Andrea took me here and it was my first spot to eat in in Scottsdale.  I had the Pita Chips app which was huge and delish, as well as the Lavosh Schawarma Wrap.  It was big and filling and the chicken was good and there was a lot of it!  Definitely a good bet.  Inexpensive, clean, and pretty quick!"}
{"text":"I've been to other Pita Jungle (the restaurant, not the legendary place where few have dared to enter, and fewer still made it out alive) and this one is really posh and designed for a more comfy feel than the other one I went to.  They have lots of healthy food and the jalapeno hummus is pretty solid too!  You get a pretty large amount of food and it's a good value.  Since I was in town for the BCS championship game, it was even cooler that I ran into fellow Auburn fans at this locale."}
{"text":"Came here, it was pretty packed but we got seated immediately, we just missed the 3:30-5:30 happy hour and 9-close reverse happy hour ($1, $2, $3 menu), but all good. I split a Chipotle Chicken Pizza ($10) and a Mahi Mahi with Pita Chips ($10) with my brother. The pizza looked and tasted delicious! It looked like it was definitely worth more than $10, not that this is a bad thing, but it gave a reminiscent taste of Taco Bell's Mexican Pizza. Just the lime and saltiness of the sauce gave it a feel of taco sauce from taco bell, but trust me, it was great, and i'd come back to eat it again in a heart beat.  The Mahi Mahi with Pita Chips was also pretty delciious, though the serving size was unfortunately not as big. For $10, I'm sure it was that price because of the fish, it was beautifully played, there was quite a generous amount of fish, though I woulda liked more than just 4 pita chips haha. With only four I was sort of forced to throw big chunks on my pita chips, but whatever. It was still delicious, and a cheap meal for 2! Around $24 after tip which isn't bad. Finally a place I got to eat out while I was visiting Tempe and I got to see all the college girls, hahaha!"}
{"text":"Pita Jungle is a great place for lunch or dinner, with lots of vegetarian options and healthy options. The only real downfall of this location is the noise - with a full work week crowd at lunch, it's insanely loud...like almost having to yell at your companions to be heard loud. I got the Pesto Pita pizza, which was yummy and filling, and a Greek Salad which was fresh and good. My favorites are the hot salads because they are big and filling. The lentil fetoosh salad is so great - delicious and savory rice & lentils, topped with lightly dressed salad, topped with amazing caramelized onions and pita crackers. So satisfying and delicious, and feels really healthy too."}
{"text":"Excellent food! First time trying the gyro. Our server Tiffany was fantastic and extremely helpful in helping me select an entree. Highly recommend for anyone looking to explore hummus or greek/Mediterranean type food."}
{"text":"The service and food are always great. The menu isn't exotic, but offers a wide selection of healthy options. For me, hummus is a great way to start, and of course a 1/2 dozen desserts to choose from for later. Overall it's a kid friendly, waist size friendly, place to grab lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Been here 3 times! Love it more and more every time! Hummus! I now drive up Tatum in traffic just to get the Hummus! Jalape√±o and Cilantro Hummus! Oh boy now I am craving it again. I will do take out for the Hummus. A creative and delicious menu. Wraps are really good. The place is a tad noisy so I enjoy take out. Full bar. Waiters are pleasant. Priced well and delicious. Everyone should try this place out. Oh get the Hummus!"}
{"text":"that was likely the cleanest, healthiest gyro i've ever eaten (for better or worse). and the falafel balls were crunch crunch yum. i thank my phoenix native roommate for the suggestion - it was spot on what we wanted."}
{"text":"Huge portions...extremely yummy...poor service...I guess there is always takeout :)"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch and had a pretty decent time. It was packed, had to wait a bit. Kind of an odd location I think, but its close to the rail and some other small shops. Our waiter was a bit of a putz. He forgot our hummus plate before hand, and then got one of our orders wrong. Decided to eat it anyways, and it was good, just not what i was expecting. I dont know how long they have been open, so Ill pass and give them a break this time. It is a bit fancier than the other pita jungle out in Arcadia. The big mirror was just odd to me. But just the same as the place out in Arcadia, it seems beautiful people seem to flock to this place for some reason. My attention was diverted more than once with some of the business women coming in. =) I definately will give it another go once I feel its been open a while to see if the service gets better."}
{"text":"Went to lunch here today with a co-worker. We left about 11am and got there about 1115 or so and the place was packed, which is definately a good sign!  Once we got seated, we ordered some hummus and pita bread. Like others, you get a full dish of hummus, and 1 pita. You definately need 2 or 3 to take down the whole thing. The hummus was some of the best I have had around town...  The Chicken Lavosh Wrap I got was very tasty.   The only negative thing I have to say is that the parking lot shares with Rubios, Pei Wei, Subway, Zen Zen, and a few others. It was pretty difficult to find a spot to park. But if you can find a place to park, make sure to check this place out. Its some tasty business!!"}
{"text":"Came in with a group of ten people 30 minutes before closing for a going away dinner for our buddy an couldn't have felt more welcomed by Kevin our server! He was so nice an so acomidating! The food was almost as good as the service! We will all definetly be back! Thank you so much kevin an pita jungle for making it a nite to remember!"}
{"text":"Mmmmm....this place is the BOMB!! I ordered the chicken curry salad and they gave me a huge portion. ..service is excellent and waitresses are beautiful..I will definitely come back here if I'm on this side of town again plus the food here is a much healthier alternative if that's what your looking for"}
{"text":"A fantastic place to go if you have a group with different tastes. Here, you have quite the range of options for both meat eaters and vegetarians. You can definitely find something on the healthier side of restaurant fare. Each and every Pita Jungle has a little bit of a different flare that does a pretty good job of matching the local feel. So all in all, Pita Jungle is an easy choice for a relaxed lunch or dinner.  Sad to say, however, that in the last year I have seen the quality of their food and service continually decline. I have been coming to Pita Jungle for years, and it's unfortunate that I no longer trust that I will get the same good quality of which I know they are capable. Dishes that I have noticed are inconsistent include the coconut curry soup and the lentil fatoosh (I find this particularly sad as those are two of my favorites). The Caribbean salad is also hit and miss, but this is likely highly dependent on what is in season. There are, however, things I have ordered that I have always been pleased with, including the baba ganoush, hummus, falafel wrap and black bean burger."}
{"text":"Food was ok nothing really exciting  Big portions Great server   Tried the cilantro/jalapeno hummus its tasty but not wasn't spicy $5 order  *chicken wrap lots veggies and large portion   *Kafta burger best part was garlic potatoes 1/29/2015  Total for all around $30"}
{"text":"Just wonderful!!!!  :/   I just ordered the hummus trio and when I got home they didnt  include the 2 pitas!!! how am I supposed to eat this ???  Really???!!! --- not coming back !"}
{"text":"I ordered tonight for pick up and I said more than two times no pickles on my Mediterranean pita, when I got home: Pickles everywhere! Aghhh! I hate pickles!!! Please pay more attention to your customer's requests you ruined my dinner!!!!"}
{"text":"I took my family here yesterday. Staff was friendly. There was no wait. And the service was outstanding! Can't recall the last time we enjoyed our time out this much."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time. I knew it was a good sign that the place was packed. Had the chicken shawarma. I've had many shwarmas, and this one was the best ever!!! I'll be back!!!"}
{"text":"I usually love Pita Jungle. This one served us bland plate after bland plate. They are not following corporate recipes. Really, really bad."}
{"text":"Brittany was the best this evening! She was friendly and took great care of us!  Thanks for the A+ service tonight Brittany!"}
{"text":"Ahh Pita Jungle, I wish you were closer. But if you were closer, I'd probably have no money...  Pita jungle is super, super yummy. The hummuses (humi?) are creamy and full-flavored. If you order the pita/hummus plate you can order 2 hummuses- try them all! Oh and try adding chicken on top of the hummus, it's ahmaaazing!  Their salads are also outrageously tasty and made with high quality ingredients.  The iced chai was bomb too!   Definitely one of my food highlights while visiting ASU.  Good for: Dates Internship meetings Sending parents when you need to clear the beer cans from you place Chillin with friends!   The only things to watch out for is: If it's busy, it will be kinda loud (acoustics or something) and you get squished pretty close the the people at the table next to you. Still soo worth it."}
{"text":"Same food as the other Pita Jungle that I thrashed for being a haven for obnoxious douchebag (and douchebag-uette) servers (and hostesses ad managers) EXCEPT, at this location, it's like they were actually happy to see us!  Coincidentally, the two locations are equidistant from my house, so there's no doubt which one I'll be going to from now on.  Wish I had known about this location sooner - oh well, one day I will learn to use teh internetz."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this Pita Jungle off and on for a while, since I work nearby.  I can't figure out why everyone that works there is a jerk.  It seems to be only me - I see other people getting good service with a smile, but I'm always \"S\"-d on whenever I come here.  Today will be the last time I ever do.  Great food, but the one star is for the unconscionably rude staff.  My bro-in-law and another good friend feel the same way, too, and we're tempted to think it's because we don't look like we belong here, but that's just a shot in the dark.  Once or twice I'd forgive, but EVERY time?  F this place, seriously."}
{"text":"Love the cilantro jalapeno hummus!  So amazingly good.  Great with the Ahi or chicken, but was best with the steak was bummed when they stopped serving it.   We had the falafel salad earlier this week, and it was horrible. Very dry to the point of burnt.  They brought a new one out, and almost as bad.  The ended up comping the entire check after a billing error wasn't caught right away.  Honest mistake.  In closing, hummus good, falafel bad, customer service, above and beyond."}
{"text":"Please note this is specific to the Tatum location only - Be careful when ordering out .. Pita comes cold from a bag and not toasty warm like they serve u in the restaurant. You will need to ask to toast the pita or take it home and warm it your way. Giving 3 stars for my experience today with white undercooked pita."}
{"text":"To be honest way over priced the fact I wanted veggies over rice and I get charged more for veggies come on guys and then I've had chicken with curry sauce before today ask for the same thing and I got this chicken that had no curry spice at all to it veggies are undercooked...  Very disappointed with Pita jungle I am sticking with Pita da vita in Gilbert.  At least I won't get charged for veggies and it's actual curry sauce.."}
{"text":"Went to Pita Jungle for lunch with a couple of friends, as usual, the chicken hummus dish with cilantro was outstanding, however, our server Tim...made the day, he was super nice and attentive...they finally  got it right!"}
{"text":"Got to say I love three lavosh pizzas!! So far the jungle is great and I have had great meals at all of there locations so far.. Arcadia location has chill atmosphere good hipster wait staff fast service menu is healthier than lots of places good place for all ages and tastes."}
{"text":"Sad we just found this place!! We loved it! Katie the waitress is amazing! She was one of the best we've ever had!  The food was great and the place is kid friendly, the kids plates are a great value! Can't say enough about this place!"}
{"text":"Friend and I lunched here yesterday.  Another good experience at Pita Jungle. For me, I really like the menu with food and profiles that are far away from fried food and burgers.   The Shrimp appetizer with cilantro, tomato, and pita bread w/pesto was very good and big enough in portion to work as my meal. Yum!"}
{"text":"The food here is similar up every other Pita Jungle, but what's awesome is the atmosphere. It's a little loud if you sit inside but if you get on the patio it's great- right on a lake."}
{"text":"My Wife & I went to this location for the first time since moving to Gilbert about two years ago, and, realized why did we wait so long ! Was very comfortable inside with a modern touch to it, and very open feeling. Felt welcomed by the staff, and recieved suggestions from nearby customers. We ordered the caramelized cauliflower, which was so tasty, just excellent ! My wife ordered a Shawarma wrap which came with a salad, which was large, tasty, and she could only eat half. I ordered a salad that was on they're specials menu, served on top of hummus, which was also loaded with flavor and also good size. Overall, we enjoyed a great dinner, and felt totally comfortable and not rushed at all, our server was also on point, for sure we'll come back."}
{"text":"This was my first Pita Jungle before they started popping up everywhere. I love this Pita Jungle. It is always busy and has a wonderful outdoor patio that I have spent many happy hours on. Their sangria is very tasty and their hummus is my absolute favorite hummus of anywhere I have been. Freakin DELICIOUS!!! This Pita Jungle just has an amazing vibe that none of the other locations have. Plus, they have never messed up my order here. Love, love, love it!!"}
{"text":"First time visiting  this location.  The food  was decent. Not great . Had the hummus with pita. Tried their lentils  soup . This was flavorless.  Tried their yellow fin tuna salad and phili cheese steak . Service was attentive"}
{"text":"I loooove Pita Jungle!  Their food is incredible and healthy - a rare treat these days.  The hummus that kicks things off is some of the best I've ever had.  I've stuck to a few dishes including the Chicken Masala and the  black bean burger (I'm not a vegetarian, but I prefer it to real burgers now!).  I have yet to find hippy health food that compares.  The servers are always really nice and attentive, and best of all it's fairly cheap.  I would definitely eat here every day if there was one closer to old town!"}
{"text":"Love this restaurant! Definitely the best location I've been to. The mill location is awesome too.  The staff here are super friendly and have a good eye for when to check on guests and when to let them enjoy their food.  The food is sooo delicious. Happy hour is definitely the way to go for new comers that are unsure of whether they'll like the place. Happy hour is Monday through Friday 3 to 6 I believe. All the food items are $5 or less and they're small portions so you can try lots of goodies :)  I forgot what pita wrap I got, but it was amazing. Super flavorful sides as well as marinades on meats! There's also a salad I've had my eye on. I'll have to try it next visit!"}
{"text":"I was pretty disappointed with this location after having been to the 7th street location prior to visiting this one :( I tried pita jungle for the first time at the 7th Street location and fell in love!! All of the food was awesome and our waiter was great... come to this location and there was no consistency (food or service). The pizza tapas I ordered at 7th Street was crispy and had fresh arugula and yummy pesto. I ordered the same exact pizza here... the pizza wasn't even cooked! On top of that, the items (such as the arugula were not present and the pesto was waaay too salty).  Overall, the rest of our food didn't necessarily have anything wrong with it, it just appeared to be better cared for at the other location :/ (presentation and flavor)  I won't give up on pita jungle, but I don't think I'd come back to this location."}
{"text":"Great food great service,  nice ambience and decor.  There were like eight parties ahead of me but since I was eating for one I got sat at bar. Had lumberjack IPA.  And looking over the vegetarian options chose the roasted garlic & portobello mushroom pizza delicious and rich."}
{"text":"This was my 5th visit to a Pita Jungle, usually predictably enjoyable.  Mediocre experience today, at best.  The staff seemed a little discombobulated today.  My wife had the peanut butter/banana smoothie ... How can you go wrong with that.  I had a side of hummus and a felafel wrap, how can you screw up hummus; however, the wrap was not good at all.  The felafel was burned, a good 1/16\" of crust, they were literally black! That kind kind of ruined lunch.  Off to Whataburger now."}
{"text":"This place has a very unique menu. Their staff seems to be having fun at work and has favorites that honestly sounded like they might be their favorite foods. They also have some incredible iced tea. We were there during the day so no drink he's for us! I was impressed all around. There was not a super high cost and there was a lot of love that went into the food."}
{"text":"Great food in an eclectic environment. The pretty hostess at the front smiled at every single  person she came in contact with. The server was attentive and professional, and a cool guy. Even offered free hummus as it was our first time. We came in from Dallas on business and we could not have felt more welcome. The gyro was very good as well."}
{"text":"I called in an order tonight for a pesto lavish turkey wrap and spicy chicken wrap. When I got it home I realized that I did not get the turkey lavish wrap but something different and my boyfriend's spicy chicken wrap was a complete mess. Getting an order correct is very important especially if people are picking it up to go and won't realize they have the wrong thing until they are already home. Very frustrating. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Second visit will most likely be back. Food and smoothies are top notch. Service is great even though they are always have a large crowd food is delivered"}
{"text":"I am so disappointed.... I usually go to the pita jungle on 44th street  and have always enjoyed everything. Today my mom and I went to pita jungle on 75th and Bell.  We endeared the cauliflower and it came out extremely burnt. I was hesitant to return but even the waitress could tell, so she took it back to kitchen.  She brought it back and it was barley cooked as if the cook was proving a point. I again asked to have them cook. In the mean time the pasta salad that we ordered had arrived, the chicken was raw.  Cold to touch and skin on chicken was still pink.  I spoke to the owner who told me it was the marinade that made it pink and the pasta made the chicken cold. We sat next to kitchen so there was not enough time for chicken straight off the grill to become cold if it was thoroughly cooked.  Very disappointed, that he didn't even want to hear our side and immediately got defensive. As the owner I would think you would listen to your customer rather than argue, and just say  \" you will not be charged\" and walk away. Ended up leaving hungry as no food was edible."}
{"text":"I have been in Pita Jungle now a couple of times it was my first time at this Pita Jungle, cute little restaurant in Tempe.  My friend and I just went for a light dinner.  So, we ended up getting the Cilantro Jalapeno Hummus and some Tzatziki.  Wow, I forgot how awesome the hummus is at Pita Jungle, nice and spicy. If you have not been to Pita Jungle for hummus you are definitely missing out.      While when we were trying to pay for our bill, our service was telling us that the credit card server was down and that we can only pay with cash.  First of all you never tell your customers that you can only take cash at a restaurant when they take credit card too.  Second you can write down the credit card number on a credit card slip and then have the customer sigh it.  Third the guy was like you can wait around until the system comes back up.  Yeah no, we will just pay cash and leave.      Our server was very nice and kept our drinks filled the whole time we were there.  Normally I did not leave a 2 star rating, but that was just not acceptable for customer services.    Happy Yelping."}
{"text":"Went in for my regular order of a philly chicken pita and draft beer. Not sure what has changed, but for some reason placing my order and then getting my food took, what seemed to be, twice as long as usual. I know summer can be slow, but for us regulars, it's nice to know that when we stay loyal during tough times, that our restaurants also stay loyal to us customers by having adequate staff.   My food was good as usual but being there almost an hour to place and eat a simple order was a little long.   I'll be back I promise and hopefully so will the service level."}
{"text":"This place presently surprised me. Great food, great atmosphere and a full bar with happy hour!"}
{"text":"We found this place on yelp and were happy with our choice. The restaurant was very busy but we were seated right away. They had misters outside but it was still way too hot to sit out there. We ordered the Chicken Schwarma. It was very tasty and came out very fast. The waitress was very friendly and attentive and helped us choose from the menu. She checked on us several times and even let us take our drinks to go."}
{"text":"This is my fave Pita Jungle location. The service and food are always great. I am obsessed with the Mahi Mahi with hummus and pita chips. As always, I will be back."}
{"text":"Been to pita jungle several times. Food is generally good. Ordered the wood fired salmon tonight. It was a little dry. Food is reasonably price and ambiance is cool."}
{"text":"Love this place. Lots of options for your vegan and vegetarian as well. The have a regular happy hour as well as a reverse later in the evening for cocktails as well as appetizers. They have a rotating special menu as well as a good selection of craft beers"}
{"text":"I have been to another one and feel in love with the falafel I had. I ordered and when I took my first bite I was a bit disappointed. Although good, the bread was hard around the edges and tasted a bit stale. It wasn't hot or warm but room temperature and did I mention stale tasting.  The employees don't look happy or that they care to be there. My guy waiter was nice enough but I felt a bit of a disconnect with the whole environment.  I will go back to the one in Mesa but will pass on this one."}
{"text":"I have been here twice with friends from Phoenix while visiting.  Great food.  Nice variety of items on the menu.  Huge seating area indoor and out so never a long wait.  Best sangria I have had in a long time.  Ordered a greek salad this time out and it was great.  Just like back in Greektown in Detroit."}
{"text":"Still flying solo.  My friends took me for dinner here and it was excellent.  Humus appetizer was great.  For main course did broiled chicken pita wrap and it was perfect.  Recommend!"}
{"text":"We usually eat at the Pita Jungles in Scottsdale or at the Desert Ridge location, and they are good. Stopped at this location today in Chandler and WOW! The tapas - hummus trio, dolmades, Kafta slider and falafel were SO good, it was noticeably better than the other locations, and reminded me of the original Pita Jungle in Tempe.  Found out this one is the 2nd Pita Jungle location opened and has been around a long time. They've got something right, it's worth the stop here!"}
{"text":"Hands down best Pita Jungle location I have been to. Definitely give it a try if you have been scorned by other locations. Ethan, our server was funny and attentive, food was actually prepared with care and with presentation in mind. Definitely recommend and will be back."}
{"text":"I try to stay away from big chains like this, but I just moved here and was craving falafel so bad, and I really wanted to try it.  Food was ok. I ordered a falafel sandwich. Didn't blow me away. The pita was hard and flavorless. I also ordered tabouli, which was pretty much all parsley. The mixed beans were really good.  Atmosphere was pretty cool  Service was good. Between my server, the manager and the buss boy, they asked me if I was okay about 10 times which was a little annoying.   Wouldn't really come back too many times because I can make this food better at home."}
{"text":"As always, great food, atmosphere and service. Good for a casual lunch with a friend."}
{"text":"Pita Jungle is a great place to go for healthy and tasty food. Most locations you will find are absolutely packed because they are in very busy urban centers such as Desert Ridge or Scottsdale/Shea, but this location is in an new growth area and the location is still new so it's easier to get in during lunch and dinner rush.  The variety of food is great. They have something for the salad lover, vegetarian, pizzas, and lots more. They have a nice covered patio area with barside service. The bar is great and it's a good place for happy hour too. I live nearby and eat here at least once a week. The food is consistent, fresh and the service is good. I do sometimes wish they would find a few new servers, but good help is hard to find. The place is clean and the food is very tasty, healthy and you should try it. Large portions too."}
{"text":"I love this place but recently food is not the best. Maybe they changed the chef? The flavors are not there anymore :("}
{"text":"The new location is still ironing out a few kinks, but nothing worth fretting over. I often hear about parking being an issue; however, they validate parking. And it's on Mill for Pete's sake! of course parking isn't a dream.   The food is always delicious. The happy hour pricing is so cheap $1-$4 for small dishes that are perfect for trying foods you might not otherwise try. I have never had a bad meal at Pita. It's a lil artsy, healthy place."}
{"text":"I came in here today for the first time at this location. I had to philly chicken pita and they made it spicy for me by request. The pita was bomb with tons of flavor. I had some pita chips on the side, definitely puts any fries I've had in the past to shame.   Another thing I liked is that the whole place was Live and packed with people, who were on lunch break and just relaxing enjoying the weather outside in the patio area. The service is great, and I like the vibe   I Would Def come back again !"}
{"text":"STAY AWAY!!!!!! Do not eat at Pita Jungle Chandler!!!  This place has gone downhill since they changed management!! !!  Ordered medium burger , it came well done and then was told it was my fault by rude manager! This was 3rd time in a month my order was screwed up!  Wrote letter to corporate and a guy named Phil Pederson responded with form-type letter not addressing any of the issues! I rewrote turning down patronizing offer of gift certificate as he never addressed any of  the problems at this location and never heard again. Obviously they do not care about customers or future business!   STAY AWAY FROM PITA JUNGLE CHANDLER!!!  THEY ARE PUTTING OUT SUB-PAR FOOD WITH TERRIBLE MANAGEMENT!!"}
{"text":"Had the best soup here...I don't remember the name,  but I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"I really wish I had taken a photo our food was well presented. My friend and I ate here last Saturday for girl talk. I had the albacore tuna pita and every bite was so amazingly fresh and oh so good. I really like that the flat bread is served on the side. My friend had the black bean burger and loved it. This is definitely going to be a restaurant to return to. My only regret was they do not serve a plain green or black iced tea. All featured teas are fruity, but no worries, I had San Pellegrino instead with a twist of lime. The host and staff are wonderful. Delicioso!"}
{"text":"This Pita Jungle location was very clean. The staff was friendly and our waiter checked on us frequently. Pita Jungle has  great service and the chicken Pita wrap was tasty."}
{"text":"Pita Jungle = wholesome love.  I'm a big fan and lover of Pita Jungle and have frequented the original Tempe location numerous times ever since hs back in 98 and have enjoyed many chicken shwarmas and hummus plates BUT the Chandler location rocks! I just love their space in the Anderson Springs Plaza, it's airy, love the art, the lighting, the staff and the overall feel. Atmosphere aside, like the Pita in tempe and the Jungle in Mesa at Dobson and Southern, the food is just awesome. I believe this is the location that I fell in love with my all time favorite item on the menu and that is the chicken pasta salad, a concoction of Marinated grilled chicken breast tossed with rotini pasta, fresh tomatoes, with lemon vinaigrette. Eversince first bite, I have been enamored by this simple pasta salad, the lemon vinaigrette is simply delicious intermixed with the pasta, I usually ask for extra tomatoes coz i love my lycopene. And I tend to order it often, I must remind you all that I'm not a fan of the norm but this dish does it to me. Anywho, tonight, I tried something new, after being reassured by my friend Dani that it's alright to live life on the edge, so, i got myself the Philly Steak Pita. YUM, liked it not loved it but I'll order it again in the future. BUT i still love my chicken pasta salad."}
{"text":"This is the fourth pita jungle location I've been to, and I must say this location beats out the Chandler location in terms of character, and overall atmosphere. Now, the Chandler Pita Jungle may have a \"lake\" view but this one is set in the middle of the very artsy and picturesque Roosevelt neighborhood. Its setting alone yells out sophisticated urban space. The large windows facing the street, the whole exposed air ducts/loft look and the large mirror with the kitschy frame made of various radios and stuff - love it! now, as for the food, what can I say? I love pita jungle for what their menu offers, and I am boring when it comes to Pita Jungle coz my usuals are hummus, their garlic potatoes (yum!), the Chicken Shwarma plate, and my ultimate fave their Chicken Pasta Salad (rotini pasta, with grilled chicken and sliced tomatoes) boring eh? So, I decided to change it up, and this time I got the Chicken del Sol, it's more of a stew of sorts with chicken pieces and stewed tomatoes and a cheddar lavosh crisp as an accompaniment. It was good, loved the taste and flavor but I really felt they went overkill with the tomatoes, it  was a tomato filled dish that really became too much that i started hating what i ordered. =( Chances of me getting it again is a possibility, maybe I'll ask for less tomatoes, but me coming back to this location? of course! love the vibe and can't wait for another pita jungle outing. =)"}
{"text":"Service was terrible, we arrive 30 minutes before happy hour ended. We were seated immediately but waited 23 minutes before the server brought us water and asked us what we wanted to eat. \"Oh really happy hour is over???\" Never again."}
{"text":"Food and service is always good. We had the jalape√±o cilantro hummus, broiled chicken pita and gyro sandwich. Can't go wrong with that. Their tea selection is nice and refreshing. Servers always attentive and super nice."}
{"text":"I will be completely honest we only went to Pita Jungle because we were in a rush, knew where it was and another person in our group also from out-of-town who told us he enjoyed it. What a great accidental discovery!! Everything about the place was great. Staff was very friendly, and our server on our first of two visits in one weekend was fabulous. She patiently answered all of our questions and provided various tips about different items on the menu. 3 out of 4 of us had the coconut curry soup --wow wow wow was it good! So good that I had it again on my second visit in one weekend! Between the four of us we order the following items: lentil soup, yellowfin tuna honey sesame salad, spanakopita, wood fire salmon salad, side of cauliflower with caramelized onions, and a portobello & garlic lavash pizza (with added chicken), tabooli salad. Loved the freshness, loved the plentiful portions & of course the flavor explosions! The tabooli needed to have been chopped more & was a bit dry, but other than that it was all great! The honey sesame dressing & the amazing seared yellowfin were complimented by all the fruit. The spanakopita was not traditional in it's shape but who cares it was delicious!  Dessert...oh the rice pudding--YOWZA was it good!! We were in town for a long weekend & we ended up here twice. Learned there are franchise stores in Southern CA so we look forward to seeing if they are close."}
{"text":"Updating to keep the review fresh.  Food is always good, the specials are tasty and the service is quick.  Can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Pita Jungle is great and some locations even have live music!"}
{"text":"Yes - they are healthier than most restaurants but their food is not like it used to be when they were a tiny place in Tempe. The pitas are HORRIBLE! Find another supplier for your pitas or at least warm them up or try not serving stale ones! It is like they go dumpster diving for old pitas behind other restaurants. Awful!!"}
{"text":"I just realized I have never reviewed this place even though I come here so much. Is the food authentic middle eastern? No, but its still darn good. Love the menu options. I've never had anything here that wasn't delicious... Totally my go to place. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Lol wtf is up with AZ and shit service?  6 people order food got 1 right!  Good job PJ.   I will say what i did eat was good but no matter its not worth adding stars.  Welcome to the jungle, your going to dieeeee!   Haha"}
{"text":"When entering thee was a funny odor - hard to describe but it was not food or spices. Hostess was pleasant, server was prompt and courteous. Appetizer and entree plates were colorful and created a nice presentation for each dish. Particularly liked if we were asked if we'd like to take a tea to go. Nice way to top off a good experience."}
{"text":"I've been frequenting Pita Jungle for years now, and am very grateful that there is one in my neighborhood. Since I've tried almost everything on the menu, there are definitely a few dishes that stand out more than others. This is one of those places where you have to know what to order. Here are my go-to's:  - Jalapeno cilantro hummus: Some of the best hummus I've ever had, you cannot go to Pita J and not order the hummus! - Chicken Tikka Masala: a generous portion of chicken over brown rice, full of coconut milk flavor with an extra bite from the pea shoots - Chicken Pasta Salad: perfectly marinated chicken breast over a huge portion of pasta with a lemon vinaigrette  - Mediterranean chicken salad - sweet and savory, with feta cheese, pine nuts, raisins and all sorts of other fresh ingredients.  I rarely order chicken in restaurants because it's typically not cooked very well, but whatever they do to theirs is amazing! If you order any chicken dish, you really can't go wrong. Also, they have the best Arnold Palmers, made with fresh lemonade and passion fruit iced tea. I crave Arnie's from here on a regular basis. Service at this location is typically good as well,"}
{"text":"I have been going here since 2001, back in the day when Anthony from Drunkin Immortals worked in the kitchen....  Let me tell you, This WAS a local hidden gem, I have had EVERYTHING on the menu and only have been disappointed once back in 2006  when I ordered the pesto veggie pizza. Just not a good combination.  But honestly this was a place where the people who worked there really took pride in there job and the food they served...  Pita Jungle used to be really hip really unique really ecclectic a place you can go to eat really yummy health conscious food and people watch...Its like you had to be tattooed colored hair crazy addiction to massive amounts of piercings rockabilly just colorful artsy types but all very attractive very friendly....  Just walking in was like stepping onto the set of CHEERS everyone remembers your name...its always packed even outside with the lil tiny seats they would be filled even when its raining...I mean one time I was there back in 2003 during monsoon season and the lights went out people where still eating and coming in ordering food!! It WAS that good...  I never understood how the persian restaurant stayed open next door( between me and you they must be a front, cuz pita jungle was always packed!)...  My fave is The medchilada- its a huge pita wrapped lke a burrito stuffed with chicken and beans and cheese with cheesy saucey yummyness and brown rice ( not to fond of) i always get extra garlic sauce to eat with every bite... garlic dip - yummo spanakopita--yummy apple cinnamon cheesecake (they might not have anymore)- nummy jalapeno hummus--ummm so much to list...  But now 2010....  I was just there yesturday, matter of fact after this im gonna call and complain...  it was empty... (I was shocked !  no matter what day or time you it was always packed) ...  We walked in the hostess came up all quick she had a cute skirt on, we gave her a compliment (should have known right here) she didnt say anything....  When our waitress came up She was numb with no personality, she gave us no name and showed us no interest in our pita jungle experience...  I felt rushed immediately, I really dont like that...I noticed they had expanded their menu to include sirloin and breakfast ( i had the breakfast pita b4 it was yum) but I noticed Medchilada was not on the menu...  I asked our server if they still made it and a slight spark lit up her face she said yea...i evoked an emotion out of her that made her respond!! (she must get something when someone orders something from the ole school dayz) I dont eat meat anymore so i wanted a medchilada w/out chicken while my lover ordered his with chicken...  2mins later our food arrived and the waitress was sending out the impression like she had something else better to do and really wanted to be done with us...  Pita jungle USED to be known for the quality in service,food and portions...   my medchilada was so skimpy and dry it was similar to an over cooked cheese crisp without cheese a spoon full of beans inside but a huge bowl shaped mound of brown rice thats was dry ( not fond of) not only was it not seasoned but there was cilantro in it it was soo dry and overcooked when i cut into it caved in and revealed its hollowness reveling our nameless waitress, or extra side of potatos where charcoled black not seasoned ( i guess they dont use salt anymore) my beans where not seasoned...the chicken was dry like wood.. my garlic dip tasted like bland watered down soupy mashed potatos...  nameless unfriendly waitress came back all to quick, to get asking us anything out of the way and just topped off all our drinks not even asking if we were ready for more(after only taking two sips) messing up the balance in my tea...  After only 5 bites I was so uncomfortable full literally but feeling akwardly hungry still i began to wonder if they now added MSG in their food....  waitress appears with check where she meticulously charged for everything an decieved us when it came to happy hour prices, not even telling us the speacials or that we are there during happy hour...she even charged us the same amount for the medchiladas even though I had no chicken in mine... we asked for the chicken we were charged  for and she got obviously annoyed, then we pointed out the fact that our potatos where really burnt and she just walked off then came right back with a snotty attitude talking about she doesnt know who made it but bringing us a to go box with chicken that still was dry and looked like woody the wood pecker was peckin at it....  I was so sad and heartbroken to be treated so ill...this used to be my fave restaurant..if i hadnt had so many awesome experiences previous and this was my 1st time coming i would never go back.  I honestly feel like the magic is gone Pita jungle has sold out and let their greed get the best of them....they gave up quality for quanity BS they have cheap help that alters the food, bad service, This place sucks lost a longtime customer"}
{"text":"OUR MENU CHANGED RECENTLY. Yuck! Warn somebody first. Please put a sticker next to what you changed. I was just there 7/29 and had a great experience. ..but today I ordered the Lavosh Pizza....NO visible signs of feta ..no olives....there were mushrooms but they looked pickled..and the pizza was dripping with what looked like weeds and balsamic dressing which I got all over myself since there was nothing on the pizza to hold it. So does this mean the next time I come in I have to run through all of my favorites to find out what changed? How are your regulars suppose to know. That was just a bad experience. My pizza was weeping  balsamic dressing. ....that is rediculous. The waitress said the menu changed....I wonder if that is the case. Also there was siracho on every table. I asked the waitress to take it away because this used to be an item you asked for....I had no idea that was part of the regular decor.....needless to say she wasn't too happy when I asked it to be removed....I figured it out later when I looked around. That explains her annoyance that I asked...oh well..."}
{"text":"Tried the chicken schwarma pita wrap to go.  Got home and dug in but very quickly noticed a distinctive odor/taste of fish (probably a cooking surface that was not cleaned thoroughly after a prior dish).  I've had schwarma before and it's usually delicious, but the schwarma sauce was underwhelming and did little to counter the pervasive fish flavors.  Felt like I was eating a mahi-flavored chicken taco with hummus smeared on it.  Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Pita Jungle has the best Jalape√±o Hummus! Perfect for a date night and you get a decent sized glass of wine for the price. Never have really been disappointed with anything on the menu. Service is usually great as well. Pizzas, Mahi Mahi, Grilled Chicken, Soup, Shawarma, Hummus, Fruit Plate, Kobe Burgers....ALL amazing!"}
{"text":"I used to live by this place.  I quite miss it.  The 5* is for their hummus alone!  SO GOOD.  Three different kinds: cilantro jalapeno, red pepper, and regular.  I've not had anything bad here and have never left here hungry.  Staff is always friendly and speedy and the atmosphere is trendy/casual/relaxed/come as you are.  This place is super popular with the veggie/vegan set and for good reason: there are lots of options for those wanting their grub sans animalia.  Hard to criticize a place that combines great food, great value, and great fun!"}
{"text":"Hubby & I enjoy trying various restaurants around the valley, but when we want our favorite food with gracious, attentive waitstaff, this is where we go!   We've had just about everything on the menu and (not exaggerating here) have not had a single meal that disappointed!   How many places can you say that about? ;-)"}
{"text":"First time eating at this location, and was surprised the food wasn't quite up to par compared to locations in Mesa & Chandler!  Hubby's food wasn't served hot and my roasted garlic & portobello pizza had barely cooked garlic cloves and very few mushrooms, but a big pile of fresh basil over one side.  Neither were worth sending back, just blew my 100% positive experiences. Will for sure go back to other locations.  Service was great, but it did get pretty loud as the dinner rush came in! Avoid that if you can."}
{"text":"I loved my gyro and all of the dishes that my lunchmates ordered looked and smelled amazing :D   If I get the chance to go back, I'd get a Christmas hummus plate with chicken."}
{"text":"I'm still debating if I should rate this place 4 stars cause I like the food, but the service made me feel uncomfortable.   For some reason I always thought Pita Jungle was a type of mediterranean fast food joint so I never had any desire to visit one.  So! when I decided to check this place out based on a bunch of people telling me how awesome it was, I was so surprised! The inside of this place reminds me of a restaurant I would see back home --- it made me forget I was in Arizona, which is nice, cause it's so frickin' hot right now.  I had the dolmades, shwarma, and a bit of the beef gyro -- everything tasted pretty good.   Service wise -- I don't know. Maybe our server was having a bad day or whatever, but the vibe I felt off of him made me feel bad for eating there. I don't know what it was, I tried to be nice, by saying \"thank you\" a lot and trying to sound chipper here and there, but nothing. I really don't like saying negative things about servers, as I know how hard the job can be, but he seemed like he was either really bored or hated his job and that feeling just made me uncomfortable for being there. I don't expect servers to be happy go lucky or anything, but I don't want to feel guilty when someone takes my order and brings my food to the table.    There are a lot of things on the menu that I want to try. I am not sure if I will go to the Gilbert location, maybe I will just order to go, but I do plan on tasting the other dishes that they have to offer."}
{"text":"I have been to this place several times and I'm always thoroughly pleased with my choices, some more than others. Top favorites would be the hummus (get the trio where they let you try all 3 for the same price or some combination thereof) and the chicken chipotle lavosh pizza (it's amazing). The lentil soup is pretty tasty as well.   The other perk is that service is generally fast, the staff is friendly, and the portions are a good size. The food is as good there as it is to-go which I've done a few times."}
{"text":"Love this place when I'm in the area. I used to get seafood special which they haven't had lately. Now I get mahi-mahi with hummus! Very good!!"}
{"text":"This was my first time here. The Food was good, the service however was a different story. The employees did not smile or greet me walking into the restaurant, and kept throwing things onto my plate. And when is ask if I could try something they gave a distasteful snare.i know it's annoying to be busy and have people ask you stupid questions but still, there should be some type of costumer service. Just saying."}
{"text":"We love pita jungle! Best service, best food, and it's nutritious! TREVER is superlative! He makes the best hummus on this side of Syria! We will be coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"I've been a customer of Pita Jungle for many years and was very disappointed in my experience this evening.  Although it was a busy night, we were seated almost immediately. Our server took a few minutes before approaching us for our drink orders and we felt as though we were inconveniencing her. She called me \"honey\" and \"baby girl\" multiple times, which is a major pet peeve of mine (I'm 30).   I asked for a glass of wine and we ordered an appetizer and two entrees. Our appetizer was served by a runner and another runner served our entrees. This runner asked if there was anything else that she could do. I asked about the glass of wine that I had ordered. She quickly responded, \"Oh yes. That's on it's way now.\" A few minutes later our server stopped by to check on us and I asked about the wine, again. She acknowledged that I had ordered wine and left to go get the glass.   Meanwhile, I began to chow down on the Chicken del Sol- one if my favorite dishes and the reason we went to Pita Jungle tonight. I was extremely disappointed to discover that it was extra soupy and had little flavor. It is a soup, but it tasted very watery. A manager stopped by to check in on us and I mentioned this his him. He basically said that each chef on staff cooks differently and that it is supposed to be brothy. I completely understand that restaurants have different chefs, however, I believe that good restaurants are consistent in their menu items. I also have ordered this dish many times, for many years now, and it has never tasted so bland. There were no apologies and no attempts to fix the situation.   Finally my wine came! Again, there were no apologies. Instead, the server looked towards the table behind us, noticed that they had not been served their dinner, and asked to herself, \"Where is their dinner?\" That table seemed very upset, as did the man at the table next to them. I observed him attempting to wave down someone to take his order twice (the manager included).   The check came and I paid. When our server  returned my card she said to me, \"It worked, honey. Now you don't have to do the dishes.\" She probably was trying to make a joke, but it wasn't the way that I wanted to end an already negative experience."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to this location at Ray Rd. and Dobson Rd. I ordered my usual, which is the gyros. I was here with my wife and daughter. The waitress suggested that I try the green Sriracha instead of the red one. I did and for some reason it was not as hot as the red for me. The green one did taste real good with my gyros. The gyros for me was very tasty and I was very satisfied with my choice. I must compliment the waitress we had, she is very good at what she does. For the taste of the food and the service I will give it a four stars. Keep in mind I am not a good reviewer but, I was very pleased."}
{"text":"After a concert at the MIM, we went to have a late dinner. They were close to closing, so we orderes from the happy hour menu. Everything was yummy, the pizza, falafel, scallops, etc. Abs the prices were just right!"}
{"text":"My favorite is still the one on Shea but this is also great.  Kids meal can't be beat.  Fattoush Salad is great, so is the black bean burger (just add Sriracha).  Tapas portions at happy hour look great, but we always forget about that until after we've already ordered."}
{"text":"This review is based on takeout experience only, but I've been very impressed and have been a repeat customer because of the quality of service I've  received. You would think the takeout crowd would cause your wait to be twenty minutes or more for food around prime lunch rush times, but I've ordered at the restaurant and only waited ten minutes at noon. It's a little confusing if you just want to order food to go (go to the bar!), but the bartenders and hosts are always so kind. I was in the middle of my order and the girl taking it received a phone call which she said she had to take. Working in service, I know this stuff happens, so I waited patiently for her to resolve the problem. I may have waited four minutes, but she decided to comp my appetizer for the \"inconvenience.\" Entirely unnecessary but very much appreciated. Not to mention, the food is awesome. Vegetarians and vegans alike can find something delicious at Pita Jungle!"}
{"text":"The new location is a huge disappointment solely due to parking issues in a place like mill avenue. Dedicated parking is almost a mile away by walk and you can always expect to be charged extra for parking since they somehow make sure you don't get out before an hour. Also, the old location had a nice vibe which I just don't feel at this place anymore."}
{"text":"Was touring ASU and came across the little place while walking around Downtown Tempe. I had previously been to the location twice in Pasadena, CA, and was impressed both times, so I figured this would be great as well. The seasoning of the gyro is spectacular, and the price is cheap is well. I also recommend the spinach pies and the pita and hummus."}
{"text":"We have eaten at most of the  Pita Jungles locations in Phoenix. They are all consistently good. Fresh and healthy. My favorite is the Mediterranean chicken salad. The mango lemonade is yummy. Biggest drawback is no menu changes in 5+ years. I guess if it works why change but I would add some more choices. For example their Pita falafel is mediocre and they are the Pita Jungle."}
{"text":"Great food in a casual atmosphere.  This restaurant is right near my home so it is a favorite spot.  I have been here several times and the food is always excellent!  Looking for a healthy bite in a casual setting?  This place is for you!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love Pita Jungle, especially this one because of where it's located in a historic building. A few weeks ago, my husband and I took his family here, who are of Syrian descent. Of course, they were delighted to see Hummus, Falafel, and Baba Ganoush on the menu! They were even more delighted when our food came out, and it tasted not only authentic, but was presented in a modern way and was completely yummy! I ordered the Hummus Trio platter, which was bespeckled with kalamata olives and lemon chicken. Yum! Others at our table ordered the wraps and the pizzas, all of which were excellent! We also got a Tomato-Basil Caprese Appetizer for the whole table to share, which we all enjoyed. Service is usually quick and friendly. The brick patio is very cute with string lights and a laid-back ambience.  They have great happy hour tapas platters, too! I love this place because it's healthy, reasonably priced, and gives you an authentic taste of the middle east."}
{"text":"I've enjoyed the tasty food and great service here a few times for dinner and once for happy hour. I try to avoid wheat because of a bit of gluten sensitivity; but even so,  I've found good options here, the most notable being their creamy and generous chicken curry salad.  I guess my only grouse is the location of the place, which makes parking quite tricky especially during peak hours."}
{"text":"I love their new concept! They've revamped their menu to embody a build your pita, soup, lavash, or bowl. The ingredients are ridiculously fresh as they are constantly swapping out bowls and trays with freshly made batches.   I had a vegetarian bowl with so much protein! Beans, tofu, and hummus filled my belly very quickly. Even if you're eating there I'd recommend getting it \"to-go\" as you'll likely have enough to take home.   I'm so happy and in love with this place. Places like food courts are typically not kind to vegetarians. I've been traveling through Australia and Fiji this past month and despite having ordered falafel in dozens of cities, pita jungle is by far my favorite Mediterranean food that I've ever had.    Side note- great place to take a date. They have the ability to satisfy every dietary need without any fuss."}
{"text":"Love the variety & especially the humus and fresh cucumbers on the side. Must try thus appetizer with any of the meals. Many vegetarian options available."}
{"text":"Love this place! So many great choices. And healthy, good quality food. Awesome baba ganoush and gyros. Nice atmosphere too. Service was good. We weren't rushed and prices were good. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"It's been a long time since we've been to this location, they have expanded onto the next door space, and added a small bar area. Now, with 3 kids in tow, and my littlest one a very wiggly toddler, I was getting anxious!  Now that I am a parent and am looking for kid-friendly but not-fast-food-places to go eat with the family, I thought we had made a mistake by going there, it didn't feel very \"kid-friendly\", plus my wiggly toddler started throwing her crayons all over, while her older siblings helped out by grabbing them. I thought the server was going to be annoyed, and our neighboring customers were going to get upset, but none of that was true. I am not a parent that lets my kids run wild, but my daughter was being a little loud, so I took her to the bathroom, had a little talk with her, and I don't know how much her little mind grasped of what was going on, she behaved really good, and customers and server were really helpful by not staring, not giving us the \"eye\", and actually interacting with us, and asking us her age :D We had the Hummus and Chicken from the appetizer section for the little ones, that comes with pita bread, they all enjoyed it, and had enough for us to try it too.  My hubby got the Wood-fired Fresh Salmon with Garlic Mashed Potatoes and wilted Spinach. He loved it, I thought it was really good, although he didn't leave enough to try everything, that's how good it was. Me, I got the the Lavosh Shawarma Wrap, with grilled chicken, tomatoes and onions, and it came with a side Greek Salad. The wrap was very good, but the salad was and eye opener, as far as the knowledge of how something so easy to prepare be so good. We've been making our own Greek Salads here at home for lunch, and dinner, yummy!! So, don't feel intimidated if you have little ones, but still want to enjoy of some very good, healthy food outside the house. The servers are really good, the atmosphere is very eclectic and fun, and food is delicious!!"}
{"text":"This has always been my favorite Pita Jungle.  We've been coming here for almost a decade and it has been pretty much consistently great for all that time.  I love the shawarma wrap, black bean burger, and stuffed grape leaves.  While we were eating outside a little bird is snatching sugar packets off table.  But only \"Sugar In The Raw\", not the fake or white packets.  Quite a discerning little critter :-)"}
{"text":"I have to say this place is good. I am not a person who likes to try anything different.  I like what I like and that is it. I do not like to eat dinner food for Breakfast like my girlfriend does. Heehee Seriously, she will eat eggs for dinner and pasta with gravey for Breakfast. Anyway, pita Bread or Wrap it is a hard choice as they are both really good. The portions of food are huge. Almost too much, but hey I am not complaining. I like my sandwhiches with Garlic,not tahini.  Chicken is really good and I do not normally go for chicken. Every thing seems to be really fresh I must say and the salads are great."}
{"text":"Amazing hummus, pita and feta. My favorite was the spanakopita. AMAZING!"}
{"text":"Oh man I'm pissed. Where do I start. First things first. This place should be called Off the Deep End cause thats where I ended up after I got out of the ICU. Long story short I take a bite of this \"food\", next thing I know I wake up in the hospital surrounded by gang bangers. DO NOT EAT THIS FOOD!!! The staff was friendly and considerate as they took my order and brought me poisoned yard work clippings. BUT DO NOT TRUST THEM!!! Later that night I got EXTREMELY sick (gastrointestinal experiences, hallucinations, severe fever, respiratory distress) and had to be air-evaced to the hospital from my house. Needless to say I'm extremely lucky to be insured and even more lucky to have escaped with my life. I didn't know how sick somebody can be without dying before I went to Pita Jungle. STAY AWAY AT ALL COSTS."}
{"text":"I thought it was safe to go back. Boy was I wrong. My love of hummus blinded me and I threw caution to the wind and returned to Pita Jungle. After my close brush to death the last time I ate here, I decided to give them another chance. It almost cost me my life. The food wasn't poisonous this time, and I was very happy with the friendly, helpful staff, until I was served a glass of tainted milk that sent me straight back to the ICU. I can't keep up with these medical bills. This is the SECOND time I nearly lost my life at this place, and now I'm probably going to lose my house too. I don't know what I'm going to do. I have started a GoFundMe page to help cover some of the cost but so far it's only made 11 dollars. Lawyer up Pita Jungle."}
{"text":"I love so many of the dishes at Pita Jungle. Their hummus is some of the best you can find. Definitely a great place to take friends if you're introducing them to healthy foods."}
{"text":"When you order your app and you want to try more than a few I suggest the red,white, and baba. It's a good trio. The Schneider Weisse organic beer is good."}
{"text":"Ok, so i'm a regular at the Arcadia Pita Jungle. Last night, I was returning something at the mall, and hesitant to get my usual Mediterranean Chicken Salad there {rather than calling it in and picking it up on my way home}. But was starving, so went for it.   YOU GUYS, the prices are better here and the salad was 10x better! The sweet lady working the counter seriously packed it with goodies and it was absolutely heaven! The salad was definitely made with love and I could taste it! If you're looking for a healthy place to dine in the mall, this is it. I also LOVE their mixed beans. So naturally, I ordered a side of them too.   Next time i'm at the mall and hungry, you better believe i'm returning! & hopefully the sweet lady who was working this time, is working again! (9/21/16 at 7 PM)."}
{"text":"Service, Service, Service!!!!! Not only is the food amazing each and EVERY time, but our Server, Cristal was the best!!!!!! We will be sure to request her again! Thank you Cristal for making dinner with my Mom so enjoyable!!!!"}
{"text":"The service here is pretty poor. Once my party was waiting to be seated in the front of the restaurant. We stood there for 5 minutes while staff standed by the counter chatting away. We finally are told from across the room to sit where we would like. The waitress annoying came to take our order and breezed off. We ate our food and was never checked on after that. No refills for our drinks, nothing. The chicken in my salad was undercooked. You could see it was still slightly pink.  I have also ordered over the phone and the service is equally as sloppy. They often sound hassled by the call even though it's usually at night as opposed to the lunch rush. Once again the chicken comes undercooked. I order it because when it's done correctly it is appetizing. Alas, more often they can't get right. Occasionally I'll order the fish and spinach. When it gets to me it's fish and spinach soaked In oil. Very sad. Just not up to par with other pita jungles."}
{"text":"PITA JUNGLE YOU'RE DEAD TO ME!  Another terrible experience, why do I continue to go? No more! The food is great, but I rest use to be treated like an idiot."}
{"text":"We always order lunch from this location and the last couple of times they have been neglecting! with packaging the food and following the paid substitutes!!! Sorry, Pita!We love you but you need to get rid of the slackers"}
{"text":"Stopped by for quick bite aftwr work on a business trip. I was humgry and tired and this hit the spot. Very reasonable prices comvined with friendly attentive service, made for a great experience. I tried the hummus trio on the tapas menu and it was delish!!! I will definately be back on my next business trip. Make sure to look at the back of the menu for the tapas, it was really awesome!"}
{"text":"The bartender and hostess were wonderful; they greeted us promptly and we were provided timely service. Unfortunately we had a clear view of the kitchen which made it difficult to order food (see photos) I'd like to say the view changed but it only grew worse. At one point the guy preparing the salad mashed down the trash with his food prep gloves on and then continued to make salads : (   We have always loved the other pita jungles we  went to and I sincerely hope this was just a rare occurrence.   What appeared to us to be the manager (as he mentioned being shorted on the alcohol that he had ordered) walked past this area of the kitchen more than once & didn't seem to give it a second thought. However we did notice (just as we were closing out) that someone did come in and start to sweep the kitchen. So it is quite possible that he said something to them off to the side and they begin to address the issue after we left."}
{"text":"This place was great.  Me and my coworkers went there today.  I got a Chicken Schwarma, my two friends got a salad, and the twhc was to die for.  Service was a little slow, but hey, it's right across the street from MCC.  And it was on the lunch hour.  Can you say \"packed to the gills\"?  It was.  The food was fresh and good tasting, the mahi (which I've had before and is my favorite) was so good, cooked well, and came with some wonderful pasta salad.  I love this place."}
{"text":"I had no idea there was a regular sit-down restaurant version of this mall-food-court favorite.  The place was absolutely packed and so many were waiting patiently!  I took a seat at the bar and was greater promptly.  I ordered my \"mall\" fav salad...the Mediterranean.  It was delicious but looked like a smaller portion...could be because of the larger plate.    Can't say it was worth $14.00...$10 something plus tax and gratuity.   I'll definitely come back to try something else though!"}
{"text":"As always Pita Jungle delivered.  I had the Gyro and it was just what the belly ordered. Great atmosphere excellent service and tasty food."}
{"text":"I come to this branch because it is closer to my home.  The place is nice, however it lacks something.  Maybe it is because it feels just cold.  The food is nowhere near the one on Shea & Scottsdale Rd.  Sometimes I have no choice but to come here if my doctor is running late."}
{"text":"I stopped in today for a large hummus to go. I was so disappointed when I got home to find a thin layer of hummus- in a ginormous container. Is this what $8 of hummus looks like? They also gave 2 pitas with it-but they were cold."}
{"text":"Great food!  Great atmosphere!  Great service!  Our table was even visited by the deliciously french manager Andreane (spelling?)    Outdoor patio seems more like Brooklyn than Phoenix......Ultra urban!  Plus the over all decor seems  notch up from other Pita Jungles I have visited.  I can't wait for this weather to get better.  I hope spend more time on the back patio throughout the winter months, and hope they will bring some live acoustic music on board."}
{"text":"Came in to celebrate their 10 years!!! Congratulations you guys!!! They were offering free small size hummus. We got the trio, I love the green & orange hummus, not sure the names of them. It came with 3 pita breads as well. So delicious!   I also got the chicken shawarma & shared it with my brother. It comes with salad as well. The meals are pretty big you can share. The hummus could be shared with 3 or 4 people depends how hungry you are."}
{"text":"UPDATED REVIEW: after my poor experience with the gyro sandwich I was promptly contacted by the manager, which of course got me to come back and give them another try.   This time I actually went to the location and it was quite nice on the inside. Service was terrific! My waitress was very fast and very friendly, no complaints at all, the staff seemed really on point.   Instead of the gyro I order the chicken shawarma lavosh wrap, which was pretty good. The lavosh was kinda thin and crispy - more like a tortilla really. But the wrap itself was good as it held together right until the end of the sandwich. The chicken was nicely grilled and it had some crisp veggies and a garlic sauce, but I did find it slightly on the dry side, overall.  The side salad was very fresh and just the perfect amount.   While I wasn't blown away by the wrap, I give a decent score - certainly better than the gyro which just tasted like salt and made of that generic compressed gyro meat instead of fresh shaved lamb/beef steaks. But a gyro that authentic is really hard to find in Phoenix, to be honest.   So my updated score is an improvement, though I am still not 100% sold on Pita Jungle. This particular location is welcoming and clean and the staff gets top marks. I can't give it full stars for the food, because it just isn't the authentic middle eastern food I am looking for, it's more a trendy fusion style, something fresher than fast food, but still more a lunch meal than a nice dinner."}
{"text":"Welp, I have to say, Pita Jungle never disappoints! It was after 8 PM on a Sunday and I was literally craving a Greek salad but for the life of me, couldn't remember who would be open at this hour. And then...DING DING! Duh, Pita Jungle is right by my house and open later than most quick places.   I am absolutely in love with their Mediterranean Chicken Salad. I could drink the lemon dressing. It is so light and refreshing. The salad is packed with their delicious marinated chicken, golden raisins, taboule, corn, feta, onions, roasted bell peppers, cucumbers, toasted pine nuts, and cilantro.   If i'm feeling VERY hungry, i'll get a small order of Baba Ganoosh with a pita! This is a delicious dip consisting of broiled eggplant, tahini, greek yogurt, garlic, evoo, lemon juice, and a ratatouille garnish. It is different than hummus and SO dang good!   I will say, for the salad and a small baba to go, it is usually around $18 but hey, it is fresh, healthy, and WORTH IT!   Their Happy Hour is also definitely worth mentioning. They have a variety of tapas ranging from $1-$3 and house wine is only $3 is well! Can you say, YES PLEASE?! It is Monday - Friday from 3-5:30 PM and reverse is daily from 9 PM - close.   I'll be back soon!!"}
{"text":"We've been going to this Pita Jungle since it opened and it had been one of our favorite go-to spots. Lately, however, the service is not as good, the portions smaller, and the quality inconsistent.  When ordering to-go orders we used to be offered something to drink while we waited for our order - not anymore. While dining in, we used to have a to-go offered of whatever we were drinking (tea or lemonade) - no longer the case. A large order of soup to-go now gets you a large container - half full.  It just seems as if the details have slipped and what were once \"delighters\" have been axed from the experience.  Bummer."}
{"text":"We had an incredibly disappointing experience with the bar.  It was my husband's birthday and we decided to go to Pita Jungle for a late lunch. The hostess promptly seated us at a table that wobbled so bad I thought the top may fall off and on the floor was a host of objected to help steady but without success. We asked to be moved. The next table was better but not perfect.   We ordered 2 pineapple margaritas from the drink menu. Our server took our appetizer order and brings 2 glasses of water. The water was non-filtered and had a smell I guess that why they put lemons in it. Now our appetizers arrive and our server is assuring us our drinks are coming. We see her go back to the bar and tell the manager she needs these drinks. But I don't think the manager now's how to mixed drinks because they still aren't getting made. In fact no ones are getting made. The table behind is wondering where their drinks are and the table across from us too.    Drinks finally arrived. It took at least 15 minutes maybe longer to get our drinks. Our food arrived 5-7 minutes before the drinks. Sad but true. It was at this point we decided to go elsewhere. The appetizers were good and the waitress was kind and this is only reason I am giving them 2 stars.   No excuses we watched the hostess get over whelmed, the servers get over sat, tables not getting pre-bussed or even cleaned once the customers left. Did the busser have the holiday off? Did the service bartender have the day off? A manager was present and it didn't make it any better. Is this a fluke?"}
{"text":"Best happy hour! Tapas and cheap drinks! What more could you want? Staff has been hit or miss. But overall food and drinks are always great."}
{"text":"I would give it a 5 for food alone....the jalapeno cilantro hummus with chicken is my favorite food in the ENTIRE world.  It really is that amazing.  I also love the black bean burger, the chicken schwarma, the meditterean chicken salad, and pesto lavosh turkey wrap, the tomato basil bisque...all amazing.  Watch out for the moroccan gatzpatcho- disgusting....cold salsa basically with chunks...  Ewww and the grilled veggie wrap makes you smell like garlic for a week which is weird since it doesn't really have a good flavor.  AND MY BIGGEST BEEF WITH PJ-   They bring my hummus and immediately bring my food 1 minute later.  Time appetizers and entrees appropriately please."}
{"text":"Really enjoy this place! Fresh, healthy food and wonderful humus! Laid back environment and service has always been really friendly."}
{"text":"They restaurant itself is very cool. It's open dinning feel with a patio. The food is never something i'm going to be complaining about either."}
{"text":"I have been eating at Pita Jungle since the original store opened in Tempe and have always been extremely pleased with the food and service, until last night.   While the food was still great the service was below par. It was 6:00 pm on a Saturday evening and the restaurant was almost empty, so the issue wasn't due to a full house. Our server was a nice looking you man, not sure of his name since he didn't welcome us to Pita Jungle or offer his name.  We didn't realize that we couldn't be served alcohol outside so instead providing an explanation or recommending that we move inside he just simply said \"I can't serve you alcohol outside\". So we ordered water and he walked away, no question of would we like a tea or a starter.   When he returned with our water, I had a couple question regarding gluten free options, hopeful that he would be more engaged but was again struck with the feeling that we were a nuisance.  Thankfully the support staff served us our food and were very pleasant and helpful because I was prepared to leave.  I will likely not return to this location but if I do I will request a different server if he is there."}
{"text":"I had a different idea on what the menu would be like. It's actually a very diverse menu that could make almost anyone happy. The Dolmades were fantastic. I really like the three humus flavor with seared ahi tuna."}
{"text":"If you're looking for some downtown city ambience this is a great place for two or take your friends. Food is always good."}
{"text":"We love pita jungle! The chicken curry salad is my absolute favorite! The cilantro jalape√±o hummus is amazing!"}
{"text":"DO NOT MISS THEIR tapas, especially the  baba-ganoush. The chicken del sol was fully flavored without being too hot.  Our server Karissa, was an absolute delight...friendly, personable and knowledgeable. This Pita Jungle fits us to a tee."}
{"text":"I love the food and dislike the atmosphere of all the locations!  It is always so noisy because there is nothing in the design to absorb the noise. Take out may be the way to go here. I'm not going to dine in again because the experience is so unpleasant and you can't hold a conversation with people at your table."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Pita Jungle.  The service, the food and everything is so much better that the D. Ridge one.  I almost always rather drive further and enjoy my meal.  Today it was a very successful lunch.  The twins ate almost everything on their plates.  They are always great at letting me pick 2 proteins instead of one. I think our server's name was Chris.  He was very nice and efficient. I had the Gambas al Ajo, shrimp on a tomato garlic sauce with some pita with pesto and cheese.  It was delicious.  My hubby wolf down his black bean burger.  He kept raving about the potatoes that were on the side.  We will definitely keep coming back."}
{"text":"Ill admit I used to hate this place. The one by Shea 14 had the worst waitresses.  Im talkin mega bitches. They way they acted was like a skit on SNL, unreal.  I took my family there for my Moms B-day. We ordered something and the waitress brought the wrong thing.  After like 30mins of waiting for her to come back we told her we odrdered something different.  She was like, \" No you didnt!\"  I was all \"excuse me\" \"Im sure it was a misunderstanding\"  Thats when she said\" You are just saying that to take it off the bill\"   WTF, WHO the F says that!!!  Finally Igot a manager who took it off, we didnt even take a bite.  There was a lady eating right by us and she leaned in and said she had that waitress last week and had almost the same problem.  If she was a dude Id think she had royd rage.  Just some skinny little bitch though.  Anyway, I went back after 2 yrs. We had great service both times.   I totally love the glazed chicken lavosh pizza!  I had tryed the Medchilada, DONT EAT IT.  Its kinda hit or miss with this place.  But if you are a veg than you have horrible taste in food anyway soo Im sure itll all be good   ( I say that lovingly, Im a vegetarian sometimes :) )"}
{"text":"First time here. Totally didn't know what to expect I thought it was like diet/tofu food. I'm not a mediterranean fan but the food was okay. If you do decide to come the humus was good & the nachos. The wood-fire chicken (it felt really soupy, because of all the juice). The chicken was good."}
{"text":"I love pita jungle but who doesn't?! I have ate here way too many times to count but I just wanted to stop by to rave about my favorite salad in the whole world that is from here!!! It has hummus lining the plate of the salad and since I'm obsessed with hummus and it's vegan, it's a double win! Oh & cant go wrong with a tasty red sangria"}
{"text":"This is my favorite pita jungle! I used to live near old town & this pita was one of my go-to spots! I've been here with friends and family both, I even got my dad to love pita jungle by bringing him here (which is an accomplishment). We love the food- especially the hummus's!!! My ultimate favorite item is the quinoa salad that comes with hummus & pita(with no feta) I literally crave this salad! I'm drooling right now just thinking about it! Additional to my obsession with the food here... I've always had very good service at this location! Better than any of the others. When I come to visit Arizona you can find me at this pita jungle!"}
{"text":"Casual Happy Hour...I wanted to try one of everything on this menu, and I think I did! I started with a few favorites Shrimp in Ajo, Fresh Mozzarella & Tomato, Chicken Slider... Then I tried my absolute new favorite -- Salmon Slider! I will definitely try this on the dinner menu when I come back.   The Happy Hour Menu is must try as it give you good sample of most of the menu for cheap price!"}
{"text":"You can never go wrong with eating at any of the Pita Jungle locations.  I've been here several times and my family usually orders the same things because it's so delicious. First off, always order the humus trio! It's delicious and my favorite is the cilantro-jalape√±o humus. We usually order it with chicken and it automatically comes with pita. If you are there from 3-6pm, you can order the humus trio as a tapas and it only costs $1.  Their are amazing salads, like the pesto salad, tasty wraps, like the shawarma pita and yummy burgers. I highly recommend the broiler fish sandwich! It's delicious! It comes with a side of potatoes, which can get overcooked at times. But the fish is always well cooked and the spicy sauce is amazing! I use it for my sandwich and for my tomatoes. You definitely can't go wrong with that option!  We never get dessert because we are always stuffed, but they have some delicious options, like a baklava bread pudding.   There is also a rotating special menu that has some unique options, like a Mediterranean turkey burger or chipotle chicken wrap. It's worth a shot!"}
{"text":"Horrible service. They got my order wrong twice. The third time they gave it to me to go?  The manager gave me attitude when she rung me up an even charged me for an extra entree I didn't order. They had a staff of about 8 people with only 4 tables. They could not handle what one good waiter/waitress can. Oh. Nobody ever came to see if we needed anything or if we wanted anything else.   I'm never going back to this place. Do not eat here."}
{"text":"We finally decided to give this place another chance at the encouragement of their corporate office.  I'm glad we did.  We actually had the same server as last time but this time, he was 100 degrees better.  Attenttive, helpful, and our Mediterranean Antipasto plate was perfect.  Thank you Matt.  You did great!  And I'll be back again."}
{"text":"This place has a really nice vibe, the food is always consistent and service has always been great. If you haven't tried this place...it's a must!"}
{"text":"My friends have recommended this place several times and I turned them down because I didn't realize that it is a sit down restaurant with food other than pitas. I wish I had gone sooner! I ordered seafood linguini and it was really good. It had huge pieces of shrimp and large mussels and the sauce was delectable. We also ordered the rice pudding for dessert. Its a large portion; you can easily share it. It came with fresh strawberries which really went well with the sweetness. The service wasn't fantastic but I also didn't spend the entire meal searching for my waitress. My only real quip with this place was the parking lot. Its small and fills up quickly. We had to park across the street. Besides that, I would definitely return!"}
{"text":"I love there food, atmosphere, and there hip staff, which you could see working at trails. the portion size is eminence and the service is pretty good. I have noticed a couple more locations in phoenix and Glendale, will definitely be trying them out ."}
{"text":"i dont know why i didn't fall in love with pita jungle sooner.   i work right next to the mall so the food court is super convenient for us. let me tell you a story of how i ate here everyday for lunch for a week.   i ordered a standard gyro with no pickles (they put pickles on their gyros and i find that disgusting)  my coworker, jen, ordered the pasta salad with chicken on top.   mine was delicious and i tasted hers. hers was so good! i was like, that's what i'm ordering tomorrow.  the next day we went again and i ordered the chicken pasta. while waiting for the food to come out someone in front of me picked up their order of a hummus trio with chicken on top and a side of pita.  the next day jen asked where i wanted to go to lunch. i said pita jungle and i got my hummus trio.   and the trend continued. their food is so good!!!! and its like $8!! and since i work nearby i get a discount!   today i had a side of chicken breast with super fresh mushrooms. i watched them steam them, then put them in a pan with w tons of garlic, red wine, and seasoning. some of the best mushrooms i've ever had and it was a HUGE order of mushrooms.   i love this place!"}
{"text":"We were invited back to try out the service, and since I love the food here I had no problem coming back.  I will say our service was much better than what I stated in my earlier review. Our waitress was very friendly, funny, and had some great suggestions. Glad I can come back here to grub. :)   Come eat here!!"}
{"text":"I love a Pita Jungle, the food is fresh and always good. We have had Dustin as a server several times and he always remembers names and orders and is quick with an excellent suggestion. Always fast and professional."}
{"text":"Horrible service! My wife and I got the same thing (beef gyro) and her's came out 20 minutes before mine. I ended up having to get mine to go because my 2 year old was at his sitting-still limit and they didn't even offer an apology.  Also, we were never asked if we wanted a second drink."}
{"text":"We've been sitting here for 15 minutes and had to beg to be served. No one had even brought us water. I'll never come here again. The food better be good."}
{"text":"Many options. Fresh food. Healthy food. Taste great. Customer service could use a little work the wait staff acts like they're too good to work there. But an overall average experience with above average food."}
{"text":"Food is always consistent at this location - fast and fresh! Our server seemed a bit to overwhelmed to get anything straight. Long wait time to place our order, took forever to get our check even after I gave him my card in advance, and then he swiped and charged me for someone else's bill. I had to tell him item by item what I had ordered so he could re-ring me up correctly. It too me almost 30 minutes to get out of the restaurant upon finishing my food and waiting to pay. I was late getting back to work. NOT PLEASED."}
{"text":"I love this place. The service used to suck but their bigger space has really changed things. I LOVE the lentil fatoosh salad and the schwarma sandwich. SOOOO good. The tangy dressing in the salad is so amazing and the garlicy sauce on the sandwich is making my mouth water.  The chicken hummus is also awesome."}
{"text":"I want to love Pita Jungle - it's close to my house, reasonably priced and fairly healthy - but I don't.  The food is just ok.  I am sad it's not better. Service friendly and fast - just not spectacular flavors."}
{"text":"The best part of eating at Pita Jungle is that almost everything you order is super healthy. It's unlike a lot of restaurants because the menu is so different. Dishes that you would think should be bland are always flavorful! No matter how busy they are, you always get great service. You even can get your drink to go which is a huge bonus! I'm glad Pita Jungle has numerous locations so I can eat healthy when I'm in different areas of the valley."}
{"text":"I fuckin love this place. I was surprised to hear that they have a location in Pasadena. The Shawarma and hummus combo is so good and tasty."}
{"text":"Great!! My favorite food, this one and the one by my work are both really yummy. Chicken flat bread pizza is by far my favorite. Good food and beer can't complain."}
{"text":"Regular to-go customer of this location. Great chicken shwarma pita. Best to order your food during the week as the line gets tied up on weekends occasionally and the food is usually cooked better when they aren't rushed. My order always ready for pick up in about ten minutes nor more than fifteen. Parking is kinda bad though being an older location."}
{"text":"What happened?   This new menu move, I'm not digging it.  Smaller portions with the same price.  Is it healthier or just cheaper to make?  Is this because you have become a chain and you've  lost your home town roots?  Please bring back the old menu."}
{"text":"I read some of the two star reviews and still can't figure it out.  I think this place is great!!!  Fantastic service, some great vegetarian food in Ahwatukee (finally!!!!) and there is absolutely  nothing for me to give it anything other than 5 stars.  The waiter was very fast and friendly, the atmosphere was pleasant, and overall the food was excellent.  I lived in the Mideast years ago and I love falafel...you can't find good middle east food in my neck of the woods...at least not until now. I'm sooo happy they're here; it beats Chinese by a long shot!!!"}
{"text":"I wish I had a Pita Jungle in my town. It's healthy, fresh, Mediterranean inspired food. The prices are on point as well. This location is smaller than others I've been to. The menu and service are consistent and don't disappoint. They have some outdoor seating too. My coworker really enjoyed his Gyro sandwich here. I love the chicken too. I also love the gelato...and in Arizona in the spring/summer gelato is always a good idea!  Please have more California locations Pita Jungle!"}
{"text":"Their beef gyro's are delicious!  Great portions for what you pay.  And their falafel is really good too.  Not a great portion it seems for an order of hummus, we got like one piece of pita.  Just didn't seem to be much there.  We always do carryout, and either the bartender is really nice and funny, or just werent very friendly."}
{"text":"I truly wish I could love this location as much as I love, love, love the one at Desert Ridge. But, I just don't :/  I took my son for lunch, it's enough to break him out of his normal go-to favorites but I thought for sure he'd be a convert.....not so much. The chicken gyro wrap was all bread and under-seasoned chicken. And it took a loooong time to get to the table. I had the garlic mushrooms, hummus with cukes, and dolmades....flavor same as usual, but also a big delay for items I'm pretty sure are pre-made each day. Granted, this visit was during the holiday shopping rush, so maybe the staff was frazzled. But, I feel the location lacks personality overall and could use some pep in the step! Not to be overlooked...HH tapas and house wines are still totally the perfect meal at any of their Phoenix locations :)  ***REVISED REVIEW TO FOLLOW: I returned to PJ Glendale last weekend with my son and we were both much happier with the speed of service, quality of food, plus the atmosphere overall. On this visit, tried the Pinot Grigio alongside the Grilled Veg Salad (I added grilled tofu - great addition!)....it was a tasty combination overall with an abundance of garden favorites. My son ordered the Chipotle Chicken Flatbread Pizza...he enjoyed it and was surprised at how much meat was on it...the only downfall was the level of spice, too much for he & I both, but that's always a personal choice and the name alone told us to expect some heat. His soda was refilled twice as needed and by a server who had a great disposition despite a busy Saturday evening crowd.  Thank you, Pita Jungle, for restoring my love of The Med!"}
{"text":"I love that this place has food choices for vegans & meat eaters alike. The food is non processed & tastes great! I also like that you can get alcohol here too!   My one criticism is that the pita is sub par. It tastes like they bought it at the grocery store. If pita is in the store name they should have fresher, better tasting pita bread!"}
{"text":"Pita Jungle.  Now this is a place to get great food.  If you love hummus,  and I love hummus,  this is THE place to go. The presentation of the hummus spread over a large plate with pita bread is exquisite! And the taste, magnifico! Such flavor and did I mention the hummus is warm? Not like eating it out of your fridge. I would recommend the Jalepeno hummus appetizer. Delicioso!"}
{"text":"Kudos to Pita Jungle.  You can expect Consistency and Good Service when you dine at Pita Jungle.  I have been to several Pita Jungles in town and one thing for sure is that your food will be very consistent and your server will be attentive.   My experience at PJ Downtown Phoenix last night was excellent.  It was late, almost closing time and my wife and I were greeted as if the restaurant was just opening up for the day.  We did not feel rushed at any time and the server was very attentive. We shared a Caramelized Chicken Pizza (Lavosh) and a small Greek salad.  The flavors were great.  I do think that a Greek salad should have Kalamata  olives on it and they don't do that at P J.   Good Value, Great Locations and Great Service is what you will find at Pita Jungle."}
{"text":"I love coming to pita jungle. There has been a few time where I had to wait a little bit for my order after going to pick it up for take out, but other than that there hasn't been any problems. I've never been unhappy with the service. Any time I need some pitas and hummus I know where to go."}
{"text":"Always amazing. Every location is good. I love the chicken shwarma pita! This location is my favorite. First one I ever went to and consistantly awesome!"}
{"text":"Just tried call in an order. 6pm on Tuesday.  Called three times.  Phone rang 15 times then disconnected me.  No voicemail.  I've been to the restaurant several times and I like it so this was very disappointing"}
{"text":"I would say that I prefer the Mesa location simply because it tends to be quieter but this one is within walking distance for me so it's often the one I go to.  Plus I like sitting out out by the lake when the temperature finally becomes reasonable.  I was reading the previous reviews and a lot of people have had problems with the service but I've never had anything but wonderful service here.  I've eaten here during busy and slow times and the service has always been pretty consistant.  The food is excellent and, I think, appropriately priced.  I love going to a restaurant where a good chunk of the food is vegetarian because that is so rare.   I especially love their Gazpacho, Roasted Red Pepper Hummus and Spinach Cheese Lavosh thing on their app menu.  I do eat fish occasionally so my only sadness is that they stopped carrying the Tuna Melt Pizza which was to die for.  Maybe they'll bring it back someday.......can you hear me Pita Jungle?"}
{"text":"SO good!  I don't know the exact names of the the food I had and I don't care.  It was all amazing!  I know I had the portobella burger...Delish.  Awesome hummus.  LOVED the curry chickpea soup.  Fun, healthy kids' meals.  Loved my daughter's shawarma.  I am dreaming about this place and I want one in Chicago.  Period."}
{"text":"First and definitely won't be the last time I go here. Service was great, food came out quickly. We had the jalapeno cilantro hummus and roasted vegetable salad (both Staples here) and their special Philly cheese steak wrap. So good!"}
{"text":"Another great Pita Jungle location!  I met a coworker here today and loved the bright and airy atmosphere, our amazingly friendly server and the extensive and delicious menu!  I enjoyed the gyro in a brown rice bowl - just the right portion and so tasty.  This place is so reasonable too and always provides a consistent experience."}
{"text":"I make lots of Mediterranean, Indian and Asian dishes at home so I'm critical of \"hummus joints\" the Tzatziki and hummus and taboule are great, consistent. I love the cilantro and jalape√±o hummus. Still trying to copy that recipe. It's always busy and a little loud."}
{"text":"My favorite place in Chandler to get my Mediterranean taste buds fulfilled! Haven't came across anything I didn't enjoy here. Love to get any of the pitas especially their mediterranen chicken or Falafel! Be sure to try all their hummus flavors here they have a great roasted red pepper! Great vegan options here as well, the chipotle black bean burger is one of my favorite non meat options! Service can take a little bit depending on how busy they are, dinner can be busy so get here a little early."}
{"text":"Its not often I give such high marks to a chain.  Or more specifically a location within a chain.  Pita Jungles are everywhere in AZ and the growth of the franchise shows no signs of slowing down.  The experiences you have at Pita Jungle can vary by location and the staff they employ.  These different locations can often have their own atmosphere unique to the neighborhood they're situated in.  In fact if I were writing this review about Pita Jungle in, say, Arrowhead (which I've gone to multiple times) I probably wouldn't be giving such high marks.  But the Downtown Phoenix location is different.  I've read the reviews both good and bad about this location.  And as much as I've looked attentively for areas which I could criticize since going here, this location has never let me down and its time to give them credit for it.  I've actually used this location far more for takeout than dining in.  They have great party platters that have wowed my friends and family for years.  Today though I dined in for the 3rd time at this location.  The location itself is fantastic.  In an old restored historic building thats been around almost a century.  Its nestled wonderfully on the corner of 3rd Ave and Roosevelt right along the arts district.  The interior is modern, but you get great views of the neighborhood from inside and there's a patio out back with plenty of extra seating.  Definitely feels like a neighborhood haunt.  The service I've received each time here has been exemplary and today was no different for lunch.  My staples are the hot pitas.  My favorite being the shawarma.  The one I had today was just as good as its ever been.  Clean, flavorful, fresh ingredients, and at a reasonable price.  I didn't know this but they also apparently have a Sunday Brunch menu which my Dad jumped on.  He had the pancakes with blueberry sauce and was highly satisfied.  All totaled (including drinks) lunch only set us back $20 with tip.  I've had a number of other dishes here as well including the hummus, the tazziki, their caprese salad, and even their wraps.  Every dish has exuded quality and flavor.  It's really no wonder Pita Jungle continues to grow.  They've got a menu that appeals to a wide variety of tastes and diets.  From my experience, I haven't had a bad item here ever.  I'm pretty certain any Pita Jungle will deliver on most of these qualities.  But in terms of aesthetics, vibe, and service, Downtown Phoenix may be Pita Jungle's preeminent location."}
{"text":"Really loved the atmosphere, great service, and the food was fantastic.   I got the veggie wrap, which was really excellent. It was also super filling and I wasn't able to finish the whole thing, so you definitely get your money's worth out of it.   We also ordered the Mahi Mahi, which was also quite stunning. The cilantro jalape√±o hummus was amazing. There could have been a bit more food for the price of this dish.   Also ordered their fresh guava lemonade, which we loved.  I would definitely seek out going there again."}
{"text":"Really good food and friendly / cool staff. Be sure to ask about each dish because they're very creative and inventive and the item may not come as you expected. However the food is great. The atmosphere is relaxed yet vibrant. The downtown phoenix location can get a bit loud. My favorite one is Mesa."}
{"text":"Awesome hummus.  The place is always a little busy but it's worth the wait.  The food is good and the prices are fair.  I highly suggest the chicken schawarma and any hummus."}
{"text":"Awesome food!  Very \"outside the box\" healthy side and good.  I dig the non-mainstream appeal to it all from staff to decor!  Highly recommend for anything from breakfast (tempe location) to dinner.  Can't go wrong at any location but Tempe has a Mushroom, cream cheese crepe (breakfast) that I wanna make love to!!  Locations menus differ slightly so keep that in mind."}
{"text":"Very good, great salads and magnificent gyros. Clean crisp location and pleasant atmosphere. I would recommend  avoiding peak hours to get better service."}
{"text":"One of my favorites for a quick healthy meal.  Serive is good for the most part...."}
{"text":"A Phoenix staple, Pita Jungle has expanded so much over the years, that you can now tell the difference in taste and quality between venues. Its a natural pain of growing a business, as more management, more staff and more processes make it harder to keep the store exactly how it was when it first got started. This is kinda how I feel Pita Jungle has gotten. I no longer have the same level of experience every time, at the same place nor comparing different locations.   At this particular location, I have tried a couple of things during multiple visits. I really enjoyed their curry coconut soup at lunch: it was pretty thin/light and had a lot of Thai flavors (and the cup version was filling enough). Their grilled veggie salad was huge and a great concept, but their eggplant was under cooked and under seasoned, and since the veggies are already grilled in oil, the added dressing with oil made it a bit heavy.   Speaking of oil. I used to LOVE love love their side of cauliflower with tahini sauce and caramelized onions. I would come to the Pita Jungle in Gilbert just to order that and nom it for dinner. The past couple of times I have ordered this dish, I have ended up with incredible stomach pain (like my intestines playing in the French Open)... every single time, immediately after. I'm starting to think that its the oil content in the tahini, or something that they might have changed in the recipe to make it more cost effective. Either way, its a painful dish, and it makes me sick every time. It used to be my favorite thing on the menu :(  In terms of service, its very much dependent on how busy it is. Its been impossible to hunt someone down at lunch, but I've also had great service at night time (when its half as empty). It would be great to see them revamp their menu (again) to contain less items but focus on higher quality ingredients, juicier meats (I often get dry chicken shawarmas) and more unique menu options."}
{"text":"I must confess that I was pretty hesitant to try this place. I mean come on, a chain Mediterranean restaurant sounds extremely far from legit. I like my ethnic food like I like my bars- small, hidden and full of funky people. Pita Jungle looked like the equivalent of Spaghetti factory for Italian food or the freakin Rainforest Cafe.  Rant aside, I was happy to be somewhat convinced otherwise. Don't get me wrong, their food and overall flavors are still very Americanized. HOWEVER- they are super super tasty and worth going for even tho its not 100% ethnic.   Hear me out. Pita Jungle is really a vegetarian's dream- and I'm not even vegetarian myself. Go and just order their appetizers and side dishes, they are good enough to make up a fantastic meal. The baba ganoush (eggplant hummus) had the smoky eggplant flavor i look for and it was very creamy and soft. Their side of lentils and rice is pretty abundant (for a $3 side dish) and a great base (just add veggies). My favorite though is their side of cauliflowers with tahini sauce and caramelized onions. Beware though, the cauliflower may be perfectly cooked and the sauce may be super tasty but this big side dish is heavier than it appears- the tahini sauce is heavy on the oil and spices, so its not recommended for the faint of stomach.   Food aside, their sangrias are pretty mediocre but who am I to judge- I'm the idiot ordering sangria at a Mediterranean restaurant. Overall though, its a great place to go when you want to spoil yourself (by going out) but still eat somewhat healthy, or at least to pretend like you COULD eat health... you know, if you actually wanted to."}
{"text":"Huge fan! So happy there are several locations and the flavor and quality is consistent with each of them! The Mediterranean chicken salad is phenomenal....as in, bring a friend to share this abundance of flavor. I've also tried the hummus with grilled chicken appetizer (served with cucumber slices if you want to keep it lighter than pita), the chicken curry, and the blue corn nachos which were different because of the tzatziki sauce and cilantro hummus I added to the plate :) All in all, a fun place for lunch or a casual dinner. They have happy hour 7 days a week and I think they all have actual bars to sit at, although the one at this address is a limited space small bar. The bar and long high table at the Tatum location is probably a better bet for happy hour."}
{"text":"This place is so modern and pretty inside. I love their affordable and healthy kids meal. I think it was $5 and my child got vegetables, fruit, chicken and a drink. Such a great price for a healthy meal! My food was delicious as well. I also got the peanut butter banana smoothie; although it was really good I don't think I'd buy it again because it was pretty pricey! They have a great happy hour every day, which I love because you can try certain items on the menu for $1!!"}
{"text":"This place had a nice dining area. Gives you a casual feel. I ordered a gyro and unfortunately I hated it. Coming from Tampa and having gyros all the time you have a certain expectation especially with the tzatziki sauce. This gyro had a spring mix on it a little different, but the pickles and their tzatziki sauce are what really made me just pick off the meat and leave. This sauce tasted more like a lot of mayo and something else it was not good. And taking a bite and tasting pickles was unexpected and didn't go well with everything else. But maybe it's different on the west coast."}
{"text":"I really was impressed tonight when I walked over from the studio to pick up some take out.  I believe the young man's name was David who helped me.  He had just been promoted from general help to handling take outs for this location.  He's going to do well.  The service he provided was just what I could have asked for. He knew the menu and a lot of small details I wouldn't have expected.   He even made me aware that there was covered parking that I didn't know about.  I haven't been in a Pita Jungle for years but if he is representative of the type of people that the company hires, I'll go back more often.  I certainly couldn't complain about the food either!  I like vegetarian especially when there are some interesting dishes featured which they definitely have."}
{"text":"I ordered takeout for the first time and it was a great experience. The gyros we ordered were still very warm and delicious when I got home. The meat was juicy and the sauce just right, not watery. Let be those gyros!"}
{"text":"Came in for happy hour with a friend - normally I come here for lunch.  Decided to sit in the bar.  Erica was our server and she was very attentive even with how busy she was because she had patio seating too, and the patio was crowded because of the great weather. Erica took great care of us, even offering suggestions to me for food when I couldn't decide.  Heard her offering  others recommendations as well.  Very friendly service!  I ended ordering the Kafta pizza which was very tasty.  I would highly recommend this spot to anyone.  Great food, vibe, and service!"}
{"text":"Decent service, and good food. I like their happy hour. I wouldn't come here if I was starving but portion sizes are adequate."}
{"text":"We were recommended to try this place out for Mediterranean food.   We came as first time guests to this eatery and was fully warned by a particular employee whom is super stingy on the toppings. Glad, he didn't serve me. He was training a gal on how much to give for each order. She was generous on the toppings, whereas I hear this particular employee literally measures and counts exactly each piece of protein to give each guest. Beware of this guy and don't let him serve you. Lol!  ***Pricey meal at the food court, I expect more portion!"}
{"text":"Food is healthy and delicious. Staff is fast and friendly. We love coming here. Our favorites are the chicken pasta and the fish salad with strawberries and pineapple!"}
{"text":"I thought this place was great. I loved the food. I really liked their hummus sampler platter. I just wish they gave more than two pitas for it all. Me and my husband couldn't stop eating. It was worth it. We will definitely be back"}
{"text":"I am wondering if there has been a change in management?  Place has totally gone downhill.  Gal working bar/take out is so unfriendly.  No hello, no assistance.  She really does not like her job.  Sad as their food is typically a good/fast food alternative."}
{"text":"The service is quick and friendly the food is always good and comes out fairly quick. This location is very loud. The ceiling tiles are metal and it really amplifies the sound, even when its empty. I would not bring a date her only because you will be yelling just to speak over the noise. Please teach the servers how to pour wine in a glass. Every time I order a bottle of wine every server pours it so little drops splash everywhere. It never fails. Its happened so often I began to order beer and my wife just orders wine by the glass."}
{"text":"We stopped by for lunch today. It was busy but not packed. We were seated right away and then promptly ignored for close to 10 minutes. Not even a drink order. A server finally arrived and her pleasant and friendly personality went a long way towards making up for forgetting about us. My husband order a pita and I got the chicken platter combo. The meat was juicy and perfectly seasoned and the warm pita was yummy. I wasn't a fan of the beans on the side but I was too full to worry about them. It was a hot afternoon so they even made us to go cups of our beverages. We will definitely go back and give them another shot."}
{"text":"Had lunch there yesterday and was impressed, of course it's not authentic middle eastern food, I'm middle eastern, but it's not bad food. I had the Philly cheese and the Dolmas, I wasn't sure if the they were actually cooked after stuffing or they cooked the stuffing and just served the leaves just out of the jar, which is what I think. Anyways if you're looking for authentic it's not here but if you want good out of the box food then it's great."}
{"text":"Pita Jungle was one the first places I ate when I moved here 14 years ago. It was right by ASU and delivered on those days I was too hungover to get out of bed which was a PLUS. Since then I have really enjoyed their grilled chix pitas, smoothies, and tsatziki. I was grateful they opened up an Arcadia location a few years ago..Whenver I want a consistemtly good chicken pita this is my goto spot. But as of late I have been attending their reverse happy hour which starts at 9 and goes till close which is around 10. They have a list of 10-15 tapas for $1-3 per item. I get the shrimp which comes with 2 ($3), plate of thyme and herb pita- 1 buck, trio of hummus 2 bux..u get the point. Its the healthy dollar menu!! check it out if u want a late night snack."}
{"text":"Love the food; however, the service is always supper slow. If you are trying to stop in for lunch make sure to add an hour to your trip as it is always packed. They don't take reservations but they do have online ordering which is usually what we do."}
{"text":"This place is pretty darn good. My wife has gone here a bunch of times without me and brought the hummus home which I have always enjoyed. I finally made it a point to go and grab some lunch with the family. My wife and I split the gyro and philly chicken sandwiches with a side of hummus. It was great. The kids got the chedder pita melt. I will be back."}
{"text":"While the food is good, the to go is lacking. My receipt clearly shows what I ordered (philly steak pita).. what I got was not even close (some kind of chicken wrap)."}
{"text":"I ordered the Gyro and it was good. Pricing was great, service was nice, atmosphere was cool. I will be going back."}
{"text":"By far one of my favorite places to eat in Arizona. Great food as well with great for you!"}
{"text":"It's always a great experience going to this pita jungle location. The staff is always friendly and the food is always great."}
{"text":"It was a last minute decision to have dinner there .. Was looking for something quick and fresh .. It hit home in both counts .. Very reasonable place and the service was friendly and efficient .. Try the kaftan .. The jalape√±o hummus hit home"}
{"text":"I would give this place a better rating if the service was better. I always get the spinach quesadilla. Only thing ive found that i enjoy. Make sure you get the sauces in a cup on the side and not on the plate or your tortilla will get soggy,"}
{"text":"Get the falafel bowl! It's huge (basically two meals) healthy and so so yummy! My friends were trying to steal bites when I wasn't looking"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place! Amazing flavorful falafel, I even got my roommate hooked on it. The falafel salad is huge and could absolutely make a full leftover meal from half of the salad."}
{"text":"Love this place. Friendly atmosphere with good quality food. Very comfortable and happy hours are a great catch."}
{"text":"Everything here is awesome. Happy hour is amazing. Food is great. The only complaints I have is the bar is very slow (but happy hour margs are $3 & delicious, just slow). And there's a host that flaunts multiple EDM style music festival bracelets on her wrists, and for us it just kind of brings down the 'sophistication' level of the place. If we wanted to be regular happy our goers at a junkie festival goer place we would probably go mellow mushroom or some crap place lol but over all very great place."}
{"text":"Try the gazpacho. I never had it before and was reluctant to try cold soup; but I was not disappointed. Cold soup in the Arizona summer was perfect. I usually like to get the Greek salad.  The food is always fresh and tasty and the staff is very friendly.  I like to go there when I feel like eating healthy."}
{"text":"Simply fabulous.    Showed up on a Monday night (of all times) and this place was hopping.  As in packed.  As in - the only seats were outside.    I was pleasantly surprised with attentive wait staff, inexpensive prices, and absolutely amazing food.    Had the hummus, the Falafel Pita, and some Baklava.  I highly recommend it all.  You definitely have a new fan."}
{"text":"I am a HUGE fan of Pita Jungle. The last experience was a disappointment and was the first time my husband had been there. The staff (both coming on and leaving) were hanging around eating and drinking with aprons on. The food was just so-so. I usually LOVE their pita bread but the stuff we got seemed like it was just some dried up store bought stuff. We just stopped in for tapas and a drink and I doubt we will return to this location for a full meal any time soon. :("}
{"text":"V E G A N  H E A V E N ! Seriously tho!!! I am in loved with the tahini cauliflower, falafel, and cilantro jalape√±o hummus! I come here all the time and have never had a bad experience. Do not get this place confused with the treacherous pita pit."}
{"text":"I had the falafel and my boyfriend had the spicy chicken wrap. Big portions. Lots of options. Great, friendly service."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying my review has nothing to do with the food, which was terrific.  It has to do with the service which was terrible all the way around. Hostes starts off by being rude to my kids who went in first to get a table. Walked up, took menus and walked away without saying anything to them.  It took about 15 steps for her to turn around and look at them as if they were stupid for not following her.  After that she gave them a hard time when they told her we had a party of 5, initially refusing to put together two tables to fit us.  Next, our waitress was late (apparently 30 min), which I didn't need to know, but the waitress staying to cover felt obligated to share. New waitress came, introduced herself by saying...you waiting on anyone else? In addition to staring at herself in the wall mirror the whole time we were ordering, she didn' pay attention to what we were asking her.  Then,  when my mom paid and said, \"keep the change (16% tip even with cruddy service) she brought back the changed and slapped it down, saying here's the change and gave a bad look.    I would have complained to the manager, but after watching her treatment of the woman behind us who had to wait 40 minutes to get her food done correctly, I choose not to.  That woman was smart, since the manager wouldn't give her a break on the bill she simply put the tab on the table, said, I guess this one's on you, and left."}
{"text":"Pleasant surprise.  DELICIOUS LUNCH!   Spotted this gem of an eatery in the Khols shopping center, thinking it was a fast food/take-out joint.  Opened the door, realized it was much more, and almost walked out.  The staff were friendly, welcomed me, and offered to help.  I explained that I needed something fast, to go, and they accomodated.  I ordered the     Ordered the Roasted Chicken Pita (Shawarma) and a side of mixed beans.  Clean, casual, comfortable atmosphere.  Engaging staff.  Definately recommend to friends and family and will be back."}
{"text":"I've never had a bad experience here ever! The hummus is incredible, the hummus trio is my absolute favorite! They are always extremely accommodating when I ask for a side of cucumbers instead of pita bread which is great! My best recommendation is to always try the daily specials, they are always the best! Their lemonade is to die for. Very fresh and inventive! Super friendly staff, always go the extra mile and ask if I would like a to-go iced tea for the road...yes please! Healthiest kids meals ever! My kids love eating here, and we've patronized many locations. Only drawback to this location is parking...if you come during the lunch rush, good luck to you! Come early, like 11 am. or late after 1:30 so you can get a spot & a table :)"}
{"text":"We were visiting family in Scottsdale and they took us to dinner at this location, because they like Pita Jungle and because this was supposedly one of the original, non-franchise locations. In their words:\"this is the best Mediterranean food you'll have. And their vegetarian food is amazing.\" Maybe I'm spoiled with Greek, Lebanese and nouvelle Mediterranean food establishments on the East Coast, but I was prepared to be amazed. No such luck! The Patio was full on the lovely evening we went there and inside was cold and very loud, with the industrial decor doing nothing to make conversations easy. The friendly hostess made sure we had our own nook (can you please re-upholster the banquettes or change the seats, they are uncomfortably worn out) and left us to wait for our server. It took a long time for water to appear and even longer for our server. We ordered drinks and a plate of what is commonly known as meze (appetizers) with warm pita to share while we were deciding what to get for dinner. Amazingly, they charge for each pita above the two that come with the platter. And two is not enough for a shared plate. Our wine finally came out, gingerly carried by our server with fingers on the bowl - yuck! The platter of appetizers was underwhelming: 2 falafel, deep fried into oblivion, some passable tabbouleh, slabs of feta, 2 rice filled grape leaves, which were so uniform that they must have been industrially made and finally spoonfuls of hummus, tzatziki, baba ghanoush and ratatouille (?). The dips were okay, nothing you couldn't buy in any decent grocery store these days. The ratatouille was a far cry from it, and not even close to the Mediterranean \"Ghiveci\" you can get in Greek, Turkish, etc. restaurants or make at home. The chunks of zucchini were big, the rest nonexistent and in a thin, bland sauce. No sooner had we dug into the appetizers, that our main dishes show up and the server and busboy hustle to make room for them. In other words, say goodbye to whatever you wanted to mop up with pita on the appetizer platter! Our serve got half the orders wrong, but by that time we were really hungry. Not only did the server argue with us about what we ordered, we were cowed into eating what was placed in front of us. The vaunted Shrimp Paesano special was one pound (yes, one pound!) of noodles with four measly shrimp on top and shreds of some vegetables. The fish on the salad was raw, not seared and my lavosh portobello pizza deserves a sentence of its own. Nice crisp crust, good mix of cheeses and tomato slices, basil (not herbs, as in the menu) sliced and not chiffonaded, but here was the kicker - the mushrooms were in thick slices, they were raw and the olives scattered on the pizza had pits in them! When finally summoned over, our server offered to have the kitchen cook the mushrooms. Having read about what might happen to food that goes back, I politely declined. In the end we got free dessert, a nice touch and both the rice pudding and the baklava were tasty, albeit run of the mill. We like our family, so we agreed with whatever they said, but even my husband who will pretty much eat anything shook his head."}
{"text":"Service was prompt and the food and good! Really enjoyed that they had a happy hour but was a little surprised when the happy hour portions were just a couple bites. The server didn't explain that and when I ordered mushrooms for the table, it ended up being a couple bites for one person. If we needed enough for the table, we might as well have ordered a full priced item.   Other than that, this is a good little place to grab some fresh, semi-healthy foods. My kids love the hummus trio and my wife and I always seem to order the chipotle chicken lavash pizza!"}
{"text":"Had takeout from here over a dozen times, and I almost always get the ahi tuna hummus trio and falafel balls. Honestly it's only been good every other time and I feel the portion looks different every single time, sometimes it's way less and other times it is just okay.  I think it's been superb only once which was the first time I ever ordered. Might be a place I have to sit there and eat at but I am hesitant. Also phone customer service is awesome but when you go in to get the food, customer service severely lacks even when they aren't so busy."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in Scottsdale. Healthy options, fresh ingredients, great service. We generally get takeout from Pita Jungle and the food tastes just as great as it does in the restaurant."}
{"text":"This location is solid. I ordered the gyro and hummus. Both were fantastic. Great service too. Fresh, good food."}
{"text":"Dam these guys are good!!! Basic restaurant service with no fail... they approached during the meal to make sure everything is fine... delicious spinach pasta salad and a wrap with a smoothie."}
{"text":"Quick easy and a healthy delicious place to dine at any time. I come to pita jungle all the time for their hummus and amazing entrees. Everything is big portioned so you always have some to take home and enjoy later."}
{"text":"My favs are the Philly Steak Pita and the hummus trio with chicken.  I usually call in my order and pick up because the service there isn't that great."}
{"text":"Food was not good. I have really enjoyed other pita jungles, but this one was just ewww. Got 2 kids meals, chicken philly wrap, and tapa hummus. The best thing was the fruit on the kids' plates and they didn't even make that! Not to mention they messed up our order, but that doesn't even stand out. Will NEVER return"}
{"text":"It is has been a while since I visited Pita Jungle, but I remember their food, friendly service and casual atmosphere to be exceptional. The only other restaurant that was close it was the sadly closed Gentle Strength."}
{"text":"So delicious!! My wife made me come after me saying no for years. Thank goodness she did. I had the wood fired chicken with garlic mash potatoes. It was so fresh and tasty. So good! A must when you visit Arizona."}
{"text":"When I heard about this place I was really excited because it is hard to find really friendly vegetarian food in Tempe.  The atmosphere here is great and very sunny.  It is in a strip mall which takes away from it a bit, but the inside has a funky feel to it.  I always want to like the food, but something is just off every time.  The black bean burger is good, but it comes on an untoasted piece of wheat bread that gets all soggy and falls apart.  Everything else is OK, but why do they do that.  It makes it disgusting.  Put it on a bun like normal people."}
{"text":"Excellent food, great friendly service at very good price.  Nice place easy to park with great menu selections.  I drove by the place for months and should have stopped in long ago.  They could offer more beer selections.  Overall very good and will be back."}
{"text":"I really love this place it was suprisinlgy good and you get a lot portion for the money. It is packed so there maybe a wait but overall a really good place to try"}
{"text":"LOVED this place until I found a fly in my pita today, the waitress was such a doll and took it back, brought me a new one and didnt charge me, but still sad to say, I won't be coming back to this location again."}
{"text":"I love this food. It's so fresh and precisely done! I would love to come here again! This is one of my favorite kinds of food and the layout of the menus, the restaurant and the service is good.   The only thing I would say is that home-made tabbouleh is of course a tad better than it is here."}
{"text":"The longest wait ever, it an hour and fifteen minutes to get our food. My mom had food poisoning after. I probably won't want to go back."}
{"text":"Pita Jungle is a family favorite for my husband, 2 boys and me.  The food is fresh, tasty, has a variety of options to suit every taste and the staff is always ON IT."}
{"text":"The best hummus I have ever tasted!  I have even tried buying several different store brands just so I can have hummus at home, but I have not been able to find anything as good as Pita Jungle's.  They have an online allergen menu showing all common allergens that are in their food.  This makes it so easy to order right off their menu with many items not even needing any substitutions if you do have an allergy.    I love the Happy Hour as well.  Many times I have walked away only spending $10 and that is with tip.  Their Happy Hour consists of small portions of their hummus, shrimp, scallops, pine nut chicken, falafel...all about $2 a piece.  Oh and wine is I believe $3 on HH as well.  Yum Yum!"}
{"text":"Back to 5 stars cuz I just love this place! And because I haven't seen the server with a corncob wedged tightly her nether regions the last two times I have been in.  Holly, the bartenders (there are 2!) are both super nice and always friendly. One of them always calls me \"hon\", which reminds me of Arkansas and I love it!) Anyway- my new fav is the honey ahi salad on their specials menu. The seared ahi is sliced and tastes amazing with the strawberries, mangos and pineapples all covered in the tangy-sweet honey dressing! I can't get enough. I would only love it more if they added avocados. Maybe I will ask next time!"}
{"text":"This location seems to have better food than the others. However the service here is a little slow. The staff is friendly and we are always sat quickly but once at the table it seems like it takes longer than it should for the server to come around. None the less, this is a great place."}
{"text":"My wife and I were looking for some middle eastern food and came upon this place. The service was good and so was the selection.  Regarding the food: tasty, but not the real deal.  I would come here again possibly but if I want a real fix of authentic tasting and looking medditeranian / middle eastern food I won't come here looking.  To clarify - authentic Shawarma is cooked on a Rotisserie style spit standing up, letting all the fat, juices and spices roll down the sides. It is supposed to be served with Hummus, a salad consisting of tomatoes and cucumbers and some french fries. It can be served in either a pita (greek style is best) or a Lafa (similar but not the same as lavash). It can be topped with Tahini sauce as well. The Shawarma spices are unique and can include: cumin, coriander, Za'atar and many other good spices, the flavor is what's supposed to make this dish what it is! The chicken, turkey or lamb is supposed to be succulent and juicy - not dry!   I have had the real thing in the middle east many times so I know what it's supposed to resemble.  Falafel is the same as well, to be good you must master it...."}
{"text":"The food was delicious and exactly as expected of Pita Jungle. Our server was friendly. The food was a little slow but likely because it was a pretty packed house. The reason for the lower rating is that this restaurant is NOISE--Y.  We were practically yelling at each other just to hear. The problem is that this is just one big open room with no dividers to help bring down the noise. It was so noisy that it seriously will affect whether I go back...and I can take noise. If noise is an issue for you--this location of Pita Jungle might not be for you because it is a very busy spot. Get it to go, eat outside or something. The food is worth it. The sore throat from having to yell at my dining companions? Not so much."}
{"text":"I so want to love this place, and it's other locations, but no deal, Sporto. Food we had was nothing grand. The Chipotle Black Bean Burger had an odd mesh of flavors. I did like the Lemonade Tea. I doubt I'll return. Happy that many of my friends like their food but it's just not for me."}
{"text":"YESSS. I am truly blessed to live across the street from the Pita Jungle. This is one of the few places in Scottsdale with a good selection of non-meats. I'm fairly sure they've imported the attractive hipster waitstaff from Tempe as they look adorably out of place in this neighborhood. My favorite dish is the One Thousand Beans hot pita and I do believe it has nearly ONE THOUSAND BEANS! For about $8 it feeds me for three meals."}
{"text":"Not bad, actually. I got the Mediterranean salad and was pleasantly surprised that the chicken was actually grilled in house, right before serving it to me. This is rare for airport food.   Also, the lemon vinaigrette, which I was regretting because the first taste was too tart, paired quite well with the raisins and feta cheese.   I'd do it again."}
{"text":"Had a dinner here and I mistakenly ordered the lavosh pizza instead of the (glazed) lavosh pizza.   I don't know how that could have possibly happened, lol.  But they were totally cool and brought me the pizza I wanted as soon as I tasted the error.  Friendly staff, unique food, and a great place to bring you out of town guests for a treat."}
{"text":"I'd never been to Pita Jungle and was expecting really good food. What I ordered was so bland and tasteless. Soggy bread too. Super disappointed and will never order from this place again."}
{"text":"I've been to the Pita Jungle in Chandler twice, and on both occasions had excellent food, great prices (given how good the food was, paired with huge portion sizes...I recommend the garlic dip and peanut chicken wrap), and good service (refilled drinks often, brought more pitas, brought boxes when we were done w/o our having to ask...).  I'll definitely be going back and recommending it to all my friends.  My kids liked the pizzas; color crayons were offered and used.  The baklava (sp?) and pistacio ice cream were to die for.  I don't have a bad thing to say."}
{"text":"I haven't been to a bad Pita Jungle yet.  Pita Jungle is funky and fun, and with DELICIOUS reasonably-priced mediterranean food.  The staff are no nonsense and fast."}
{"text":"Employees don't wash their hands.  I was waiting in the washroom with my young daughter and when she came out, the water in the wash basin would barely trickle out, making hand washing difficult.  My mind was already on the implications of this for restaurant staff, when an employee came out of one of the stalls and shot past us without even a glance at the sink.  This behavior suggests that she doesn't habitually wash her hands.  Gross.  I love Pita Jungle and the food+service have always been great, but cleanliness and food safety trumps this.  I won't be back. UPDATE:  Owner messaged me via Yelp.  He sounded sincerely mortified about what I described above, stated that the water in the women's room was fixed the next morning, that employees were encouraged to use other sinks until that one was fixed, that this Pita Jungle location has an excellent health record but that there was no excuse for this type of behavior.  His response was so immediate and sincere that I will take him at his word that my review will be used to emphasize the importance of hand-washing to his employees.  I'll change this review if I go back in the future and things have changed. UPDATE 2: I now stop by fairly regularly for take-out at lunchtime as I drive between 2 different job locations. Have had dinner here 1x since original review. Were it not for the handwashing incident I'd give this place a 4/5. Service is always a little slow with servers who don't seem super engaged but the food is reliably excellent with large portions and good prices. They'll accommodate special requests like whole wheat pitas or extra cucumbers without blinking their eyes and often without an extra fee."}
{"text":"The food is delicious and even better, good for you. I ordered dinner over the phone and didn't have to recite a card number! Our food was ready when we arrived to pick up within 20 minutes. Realized three hours later I had left my wallet there! I realized because Manager Ashley looked up my husband on FB (I don't have my actual name on my account) to let him know my wallet was there. When he went to pick it up, she asked for ID to make sure she was giving basically all of my life's information to the right person. This type of thing hasn't happened to me in years, so I'm extremely thankful not only for the great healthy food, but also the great people that work there and take care of their customers in every sense of the word. Thanks Ashley!"}
{"text":"Food is good and cheap but they overkill the taste of their special platters. Sometimes simple food is a good and healthy choice. I prefer their wrap instead of other stuff in the menu."}
{"text":"I am giving this 2 stars based in all of my other experienced here, which were 5 star experiences until last night.  Before I get to that the staff is very friendly and have always been nice & went above and beyond to make sure you were happy.  I have enjoyed popping in for an appetizer & glass of wine & even lunch!  Now I have been ordering their Salmon & swapped the potatoes & spinach for grilled veggies.  I have eaten this dish for 2 years.  My new fav is the Cilantro Jalape√±o hummus appetizer.    Last night, the hubby & I weren't into cooking or going out so we decided to order PJ to go.  He has never tried the Salmon before & since I always get it he would go for it too.  Sad to say Gus 1st experience was god awful.  The salmon was WAY over cooked on both of ours.  The best way I can describe it it was fried salmon!!!  So I told him to call & he did and they said Sorry!  That's it?! Sorry! I ate the hummus & grilled veggies & that was my dinner...  I am going to stop in & bring my salmon to prove to them of my discontent as sorry just doesn't cut it for me.  I am sorry I had to write this review and hopefully someone at PJ finds it useful.  Update:  I congratulate both Corporate & The local management for quickly contacting me to rectify this matter.  The manager actually called me twice to which I failed to return his call.  I was offered a free meal to rectify this matter & I kindly decline this offer as I didn't post my review to receive something for free.  I do appreciate the gesture and that is what probably should have been offered on our initial call.  THANK you for quickly responding & I will be back in soon!!!!"}
{"text":"This is one of my nephew's favorite places to eat! They have tasty, fresh items and offer veggie friendly choices as well.  The hummus is great! The nachos are plentiful! My veggie wrap came out too hot to touch, but after it cooled I enjoyed it.  It is a large open space and it makes visiting difficult because it's pretty noisy. Overall, enjoyable and fresh!"}
{"text":"This place is horrible! We've tried it 4 different times and always the same. We just keep hoping it will get better, sadly it doesn't! Service sucks. Food takes FOREVER! I don't think it takes 35 mins to steam broccoli. Are you kidding with that?? They never get the orders right and when they do get the food out it's ALL WRONG!!!  I love pita jungle but definitely NOT this location."}
{"text":"I was really hungry for lunch and craving hummus...too bad that I wasn't able to eat here because  I was completely ignored by the hostess/cashier.  I wanted to place an order to go, stood looking at the menu, put it down, waited, and waited, and then she walked by and gave me a dirty look, WTF?  So, I walked out.    Plus, the hummus with grilled chicken appetizer is now over $8.00 when it used to be about $6.00....I understand inflation, but the timing seems off.   Take your money someplace else.  In the same shopping center is Filibertos and C&K Chinese Gourmet, both of which will actually serve you when you're hungry and ready to order."}
{"text":"I have never tried this wonderful restaurant before I finely went with a friend a week ago Friday and I am no totally addicted and I have only got the same dish the sizzling broiled chicken salad  I have now gone back 4 times with in a weeks time I love it and the staff is so kind and very nice and attentive and worth a good tip"}
{"text":"Three words: Chicken and Hummus! Omg.. If the most addictive drug in the World had a food equivalent, this would be it! I made a small change to my order because I didn't want the pan fried olive oil chicken.  I requested the chicken 'shawarma' with half red bell-pepper hummus and half regular hummus...so goood!"}
{"text":"I'm pretty much a fan of any Pita Jungle.. but especially this newer Desert Ridge location for two reasons. First, it is only about a 10 or so minute drive up the 51 to this Pita Jungle from CenPho with little traffic during non-rush hours. Secondly, the tables are HUGE which is a big plus for me, considering that the tables at other PJ's are cramped and pushed together. They seem to be ironing out the flaws in the food and the space is really beautiful. Pita Jungle is perfect, as always, for a fast, quick and healthy meal."}
{"text":"I have been here numerous times and I always thoroughly enjoy my food.   Delicious healthy food that is not to expensive... you can't really ask for more.  I have been to the Pita Jungle in Tempe before and in no way does it compare to this one in ambiance.  I wish they had this exact restaurant in central phoenix right near my house... I swear I would want to come eat here everyday.  Anyway until that happens I will have to settle for driving a little out of my way to enjoy their food.  On Sunday I stopped in here to pick up some takeout... I had their hummus and taboule pita... I had them put the red pepper hummus instead of the regular and it was sooo delicious and the perfect amount of food.  I cannot wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Great for mall food!  I think I went at least 3 times during my 5 days in Scottsdale.  Certainly doesn't rank up against the best in its price category, but one of the better food court restaurants I've been to.  The single best dish is their side grilled veggie plate.  They somehow spiced it perfectly and actually pan grilled it right in front of us.  The salads were also good especially the fattoush and the pitas & wraps were fine.    If I am at a mall, hungry and see a Pita Jungle, I will be going there."}
{"text":"Pita Jungle is one of my most favorite restaurants. It is consistently good! I have recently ordered delivery through YELP and both times were exceptional. The food always arrives before the estimated arrival time! It's hot, fresh, and the boxes are packed with food!"}
{"text":"This place was quite busy and the pitas were decent. Ordered some salad and my favorite was the cilantro and jalape√±o dip, not spicy at all.  Good spot to get your pita fix."}
{"text":"This place has gone so far downhill its almost not even worth dining at anymore.  I used to frequent the Apache location in college and never had a bad meal there.  Good service, prices, portions, seasoning.  The service at the new location was terrible and the food basically disgusting both times.  I used to get the Chicken Tikka Masala and the Spicy Chicken Pita- things that are tough to mess up.  This time the Tikka was runny and fairly bland.  The chicken in it seemed like it was either old or undercooked- chewy and not really a good texture.  The Pita was downright disgusting to eat.  The chicken was super watery so much that the entire thing had already fallen apart in the wrap by the time it got to me.  Tangential to that was the awful service.  Both times the waitress was nice, but failed to do such basic things as give us napkins.  When I had to literally scoop the wrap off my plate with my hands because she also didn't give me a fork I got pretty annoyed.  Back to the wrap it was flavorless as well.  No hints of spice.  The vegetables were sparse and mushy whereas they used to be plentiful and properly cooked.  My friend got the salmon burger, an old favorite, which is now bland, dry, and flaky.  I don't think I'll be coming back.  Given that this location (geographically) is historically doomed, the lack of people in there at busy times of the week, the now poor service and even poorer quality food I can't imagine it staying here long."}
{"text":"A Washington friend and I came here yesterday after a movie and feasted like Kings.   Most do not realize that Pita Jungle has a Happy Hour where all their appetizers are $1, $2, $3.00, or about 50% off.  It lasts until 5:30 pm exactly, and then resumes with a Reverse HH at 8:30 pm.  Everything is excellent!  You can also can order off the regular menu as well.   My favorite dish continues to be their Falafel on pita sandwich for $5.99. But if you do not like pickles, make sure you ask for it without.  LOL. We also had two of each of the following: their grilled shrimp, Hummus Trio, several individual serving of Falafel balls,  Baba Ghanoush (roasted eggplant), a side of Tzatziki sauce and two glasses of wine.   As I said above, everything was excellent.  The bill came to a very fair $37 including taxes, but before tip. I'm still hopeful that someday they'll add a Tahini plater.   Now even though our server was wearing a University of Oregon jersey, she did a very nice job, and was very attentive.  So despite our misgivings, we tipped her well.  Go Dawgs!"}
{"text":"I wish I could have liked this place more since I've heard so many good things.  It could have just been what I ordered...but am I willing to go again?  No.    Nothing really jumped out at me and so I ordered something I know I like and that was the beef gyro.  I've the real deal in Greece and loved it and I'd like to say I at least know what the authentic gyro tastes like.  Pita Jungle's version was just so so.  There was enough tsatsiki sauce on it and it lacked flavor I feel.  I was sad that it was such a let down.  I wanted to try more than just the gyro on my first visit, so I just ordered a side of their garlic new potatoes.  With something that has the name garlic in it, you'd think they would be seasoned well.  These potatoes were severely lacking the garlic flavor and were very dry.    Sorry Pita Jungle, but I won't be trying you again.  :("}
{"text":"Great food and great service. Jackie even gave us a specialized dessert! The air conditioning was fantastic and the beverages were on point. We'll be back for lunch and dinner this week."}
{"text":"I just got to sample your food at The Taste event in Old Scottsdale this weekend and was BLOWN AWAY with how delicious it was!! It was hands down my friend and I's favorite item at the event.  I believe it was a pita chip with cilantro hummus and ahi!! Magnificent! Can't wait to come into your restaurant soon. I've always seen it by the movie theater we go to and next time we'll come early just to eat there. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Good food, good happy hour.  Pita jungle has quite a few small plates available for happy hour, a large bar area and good drink selection.  The food is definitely leaning towards a vegetarian bias, but there are proteins if you are not a vegetarian.  Very reasonably priced also.  Good place for some wine and conversation."}
{"text":"I will only add to the many reviews saying that the service here is pretty terrible, but the food is pretty good.  But I will add that I went to the Pita Jungle location in Scottsdale and received better service.  Still not great, but better.  Their falafel plate is great, the honey pasta salad is good but easily made at home, and their hummus is reliable but again, I could make this at home and not be ignored by indifferent servers as I wait 20 minutes for my check."}
{"text":"love this place. Their spices are unique and so is the taste! Definitely going again."}
{"text":"I went to Pita Jungle to get a dinner to take out.  The woman who takes the orders for take out food was horrible.  I cannot understand how the management allows someone like her to deal with their customers!  She was so rude.    And the manager on duty was not nice either.  It's sad when a restaurant has people working for them that treat their customers so awful.    I guess I will go elsewhere to eat because sometimes they have nice people working the counter and sometimes they have awful people working like tonight.  Even the manager was terrible.  Don't eat here.  They could care less about their customers and my meal was not that good.  That's another thing.  Sometimes the meals are good and sometimes they are awful!  No consistency at this restaurant and horrible employees!"}
{"text":"So glad the Tempe Pita Jungle moved to this location which is walking distance for me. Pita Jungle is a go-to with reliably good food, decent prices, a nice happy hour and attentive staff."}
{"text":"I enjoy the consistency of this establishment and the variety available here. It's a great place with many options for all types of diets. They usually have a menu of specials and what I've noticed is that if it becomes popular enough it gets added to the menu!  The ambiance is casual and cool. Modern yet warm and ok for meeting up, dinner date or even a rehearsal dinner (I went to one here that was FANTASTIC). The ingredients are very fresh ans healthy. Seasoning has always been on point. I've only had one friend in 13 yrs that didn't like it here...our waiter bought her lunch from her favorite place  next door (it was Jack in the Box). He was super sweet and geniunely felt bad that she wasn't enjoying her lunch. He asked her what she wished she could have and he brought it to her no charge and comped her meal. I can't say enough good stuff about this place. Def give them a try and be adventurous.   I love the cilantro lime hummus, the chicken macro platter and also dig thier fruit Fantasia salad, which is mostly fruit and shaved coconut. Sometimes I'll order thier lentils and beans with a side of veggies as a meal and it hits the spot. The teas are also very tasty and unsweetened. I ask for one to go since I enjoy sipping on it.   Hope you like them too!"}
{"text":"Food always consistent and delicious. Service always great.  Hummus choices are awesome. Delicious flatbreads and salads. A fabulous lunch spot"}
{"text":"LOVE the food. SOO yummy and SOO good for you. Only complaint is the location. Its hidden in the corner."}
{"text":"Didn't even make it in the door. Drove several laps around trying to find parking. Almost all parking belongs to Jack in the box nextdoor. Insane. Went elsewhere."}
{"text":"I came in last weekend and Liz was my server. She was very attentive and kind. It was a great experience"}
{"text":"This my second review. First was 5 stars. Last 2 visits a 4 and now 3. Over $100 spent and 6 EH's. Very average meals."}
{"text":"FYI - the Kafka and Mediterranean Chicken salad are both so good!!  If you're staying away from carbs, ask for sliced cucumbers and tomatoes instead of pita bread. They're very accommodating and the veggies are ripe, fresh and tasty."}
{"text":"Yum, Yum, Yum!  Went here for a late lunch, and was surprised how busy it was for almost 2:00pm.  The two of us were able to be seated right away, and received super fast service.  The hummus is delicious, although they give you a huge plate of hummus and only 1 pita with the small order....I could've used a couple more, but whatev.  The greek salad I had was the perfect size and delicious.  Just what I want in a light lunch!    Definitely one of my favorite lunch spots, or dinner spots when I'm not eating pizza.  :)"}
{"text":"MMmmmm vegetarian heaven!  So many choices, I never know what to do!  This visit I tried the cilantro & jalapeno hummus, which was delicious, and the greek salad.  Always yummy!  Service is always a little slow, but I like to call it more laid back....just enjoy yourself!"}
{"text":"We are here AT LEAST weekly. Excellent service, and great tasting food! Their baba is out of this world! They gladly accommodate your dietary restrictions or item changes if possible. They don't have that much employee turnover and I think that is the reason for the excellent service. I would have given them 5 stars except for three items: 1. Portion sizes vary - I understand that it happens sometimes, but it happens a bit too often 2. Presentation - From day to day ordering the same meal the plates come out looking totally different. Yes this is ONLY a presentation issue - just not consistent. 3. The cost of Ice Tea - $3 is a bit high."}
{"text":"We go to Pita Jungle at least weekly to the Desert Ridge location. Unfortunately, this time we went to the Happy Valley location.   It seems that we had either a new waitress or she did not know how to handle tables with children. The children got their food LAST even though we requested that they receive their order first.   Our request for special orders were resisted. The waitress tried to talk us out of them. Just simple substitutes nothing fancy.  End the end, just not a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"Way to early to have doors wide open.   It's way too hot in here. . Very uncomfortable. Someone must be monitoring.  Turned the a/c down. . Thank you. ."}
{"text":"Holy CRAP was this place packed today!! It's gotten astronomically popular since it arrived in this location about two or three years ago, and despite being a decent-sized establishment, if you arrive dead on at midday you're in for at least a five to ten min wait unless you're lucky. Just like I wrote in my review of Vogue Bistro, I felt like I wasn't dressed appropriately, although this time it was because while I was wearing brown camo cargo pants and a grey t-shirt, seemingly everyone else there - both typical patrons and servers alike - were dressed like they were starring in a Wiggles on-stage production. I'm a big fan of the Chicken Tikka Masala, which I've been ordering ever since it was an experiment listed on a sheet of A4 paper attached to the main menu; it's now a regular item. I also get the caramelized cauliflower with tahini which is utterly delicious. I'm NOT a big fan of cheap, sh1tty tattoos though, and I saw a whole stack of those too.  Today was more or less a day like any other. Met the wife here, sat down, were promptly served our food. I went for the lavosh shawarma wrap instead of my usual since I'm trying to cut down on carbs (a very slight cutdown.. whatever!) but did get the cauliflower too. The cauli was different today. For a start, they brought it out on a full-sized plate, whereas it's normally served on a side-item-sized plate. Was fine with me as the wife usually shares it. While the lavosh wrap was absolutely delicious as I remember it being, the tahini sauce that went along with the cauli was weirdly sweet. Like it had sugar or syrup mixed in with it. Usually it's a more tan color and savoury, but this time it was more on the amber/orange side. When the server passed by I asked him whether the recipe had officially changed - he said no, and that they might have overdone one of the ingredients in the kitchen, but he definitely noticed the difference in color too. I said I was asking because I wouldn't order it again if it tasted the same, but I'm a big fan of the usual sauce. He said he'd check with the kitchen.  Not more than a couple of minutes later he comes back carrying a giant dessert plate with a slice of duo-tone baklava on it, covered in giant sultanas (aka golden raisins, I believe) and dusted in cinnamon powder by way of compensation. Jesus on a pogo stick. Chevy Chase could have tobogganed down a snowy hill on the bastard. It was delicious - I shouldn't have eaten it but I did. Even the wife, who isn't a big fan of baklava, took a couple of bites and proclaimed that it was the best baklava she had ever had. Very nice of them to do this, especially being so busy. Double-size side item plate and a comped dessert for two - you folk in Liberia are sure missing out! Definitely coming back (I would have anyway, I had no major problem with the meal).  I thoroughly recommend this place, it's a great all-round location if you want reasonably healthy macrobiotic stuff in a funky kind of atmosphere, long as you don't mind some of the saddest tattoos you'll probably ever see. They thoroughly deserve their high rating and a Yelp ambassador should consider giving them one of those \"People love us on Yelp!\" stickers that are inexplicably given to other places such as Mr Goodcents. Although, if you want proper fresh Greek, Greek Wraps just up the road trumps them. I'd rock up there for a chicken kabob wrap on their freshly baked pita any day of the week. And no, owner of Chicago Gyros, they didn't pay me to say that. BTW, Greek Wraps did a giant renovation around Christmas last year, the place is almost literally three times bigger. Now if only Haji Baba's would renovate that rancid cesspit they call a restroom.."}
{"text":"Love Pita Jungle, Jen Allen is a great server and always gets it right.  I like to make things complicated."}
{"text":"In some ways I like this Pita Jungle's location the best!  Pita Jungle's other place near the Harkins Shea 14 can seriously be congested at times.  The place is always packed and parking can be scarce  But, here inside the Fashion Square food court, the line is short and the food just as good.    My favorites continue to be their Falafel and Gyros.  Both remind me of the middle east food that I enjoy.  Also, their Roasted Bell Hummus, Tzatziki, Garlic Dip, Grilled Chicken and Hummus Trio are all fabulous.  Very much the same as in their sit down restaurant. The only thing missing from their menu is some Tahini and Baba Ghanoush.  Well you can have everything can you?  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Amazing staff. I travel from Las Vegas to come here a couple time a year. This is always one of my first spots for dinner or lunch. The staff truly knows the menu and when you ask what is good they don't just read the menu they tell you what taste great together"}
{"text":"Love, love, love Pita Jungle. The food is absolutely delicious!!  For as many times as I've enjoyed their food, I've never actually dined in the restaurant (we always get takeout) - but judging by the crowds I always see - it is a popular spot for sure!   I have ordered several things off of their menu and loved it - I usually get the Greek Chicken salad - they give you TONS of chicken and it's so delicious!"}
{"text":"I'm giving you 3 stars cos of past experiences.   You guys are great, but some times not everybody on your team is rowing in the right direction... maybe sometimes it's like their bent over, farting into the sails. \"Go, ship, go!\"  And yeah, there was that time when you gave grandma diarrhea for lunch from a bad salad, sooo.   Ooor the time you obviously had a cat steal away with my wife's Poke Salad but did manage to rescue it's mangled body back to be served on a plate.   Yeah, 3 stars for effort.   Sometimes you guys are spot on and sometimes you guys think you're hot, & you can feel the mist on your face, but really you're standing on the bow, smilin' , pissing into the wind.   ( Apologies to any sailors I might have offended with this review )"}
{"text":"Went here 3 days ago. I normally get the chicken and hummus with the flat bread. However, this time I thought I'd switch it up and get the fish sandwich. Huge Mistake! I'd give the sandwich 0 stars. Honestly I'd rather eat a Filet of fish from Mcdonalds. Don't ever order this crap. Stick to the hummus or whatever else you know will be good."}
{"text":"Absolutely LOVED this restaurant! My kids could not believe their eyes when our appetizer of fruit, olives and pita arrived! We were in heaven. Great food, the black bean burger was divine with fresh sprouts. Our waiter was awesome as well! We will defiantly recommend this restaurant to friends and family in the area. Go get yourself some great food!! what are you waiting for? GO!"}
{"text":"Very poor service. I asked a food server about a portion size and she walked away shaking her head. The staff gave the attitude that your lucky to eat somewhere so hip. The long facial hair is a bit disturbing. Facial hair is proven to be filthy, and should not be near food. I will never come back. May even give the health department a call."}
{"text":"We hit up Pita Jungle before we headed to Gammage for a play last night and although it's not our first time to Pita Jungle, it was our first time to THIS Pita Jungle.   The 5 stars is based on the awesome service experience we had. The food is always good, but Kevin, our server, was kind, polite, friendly, and helpful. But what really put it over the top was his very thoughtful gesture of bringing my son club soda and a cloth when my son inadvertently spilled food on his tie without even being asked. He even helped him get his tie clean. It's this kind of simple, yet sweet gesture that gets ya a big tip and Kevin earned every cent of it.  Pita Jungle's food is delish. We had the hummus for an appetizer, just the basic hummus. It was creamy, flavorful, and the warm pitas were perfection. My son and I also had the chicken schwarma pita...our favorite. The chicken was perfectly done, not overly sauced, and the pita again was warm and wonderful. We finished the meal with a baklava sundae. OMG...I will be back if only for the sundae alone! Warm baklava with ice cream and chocolate sauce? YES PLEASE!   The restaurant was super clean with lots of local art on the walls. The open floor plan made it very welcoming and bright without allowing for it to get too loud.   Thank you so much for a great experience. We don't get to Tempe often, but we will definitely make a point to visit this Pita Jungle when we are there again!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed lunch today with friends and my gourmet son at Pita Jungle. It's hip and trendy, but don't let that stop you from coming to visit. The food was very good.   Since the weather is so nice out, we were able to take advantage of patio dining. Our server was nice, but honestly, I don't remember her name. In fact, I'm not sure she introduced herself, but one of my friends knew her from a previous restaurant they both worked at.  We enjoyed the falafel platter and the small hummus as starters. The falafel was flavorful, tender, and not overdone at all. I hate hockey puck falafel. My vegetarian friend enjoyed the roasted vegetable salad, my son had the pesto pizza, our other friends had the lavosh pizza, and I had the chicken schwarma pita. All were very tasty. My son enjoyed his pizza so much that he didn't even speak the entire meal.   I'm looking forward to coming back soon to try out some other treats! I have been told via my Facebook Check-In that I MUST try the nachos so next time, it's on my list!"}
{"text":"A Phoenix Valley staple.  Decent Mediterranean fare.  Nothing gourmet but solid. Healthier option"}
{"text":"I usually get the Falafel Salad, Falafel Pita or Hummus and Chicken whenever I go here. So delicious! However, It was time to try something new this evening! I ordered the Red Quinoa with Cilantro Jalape√±o Hummus as well as a side of chicken from the Hummus and Chicken plate and pitas. Wow! Super yummy!"}

{"text":"I order take out/delivery from this place regularly... so fresh, healthy and delicious.   The Lentil Fetoosh and Salmon salad are incredible.  Very large portions give me two-four meals out of an entree and couple of sides.   Their kids menu is so kid-friendly and healthy at the same time.  I'll keep coming back!"}
{"text":"Met my ma, bro and sis there for lunch the other day. Very crowded and noisy, aside from that the food was awesome as it usually is its been my this has been my fourth time eating there."}
{"text":"I love coming here in nice cool weather and enjoying the lake view on the patio, although the ducks are not always the most polite of dining companions.  The last time I was here, I branched out and got the pesto pizza. Basically, it was a pita with pesto, a bunch of raw, barely cut up veggies (including an entire mushroom), and cheese, just melted for a moment. I was unimpressed.  Luckily, it wasn't my first time. Their gazpacho, tomato and red lentil soups are all amazing, and my favorite is the spinach feta quesadilla. Best quesadilla I've ever had. The iced tea is delicious, they're quick to refill, and will often offer you a travel cup to go.  Service, while a bit slow, is very friendly, and I love the number of vegetarian options.  Price point can be a bit high, but the food is good quality, and except the pita pizza, it is DELICIOUS. Looking forward to being a continuous customer."}
{"text":"Great place to go if visiting someone at ASU. Everything was good but I definitely recommend the chicken shwarma pita or the Mai-maui. Hummus is also very good."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in Scottsdale.  Great prices for the quality of food.  Lots of items for everyone including meat-eaters, vegetarians and vegans."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of Greek cuisine and this establishment! The food is always fresh and the portions are generous.  Every time I go I have a different item from the menu. Last night's choice was the chicken combo plate. Once again I was completely satisfied!!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here for lunch. We stood at the front for a good couple mins without being greeted. There was only the bartender that was up there and he was busy taking a takeout order. It wasn't busy either, there was only one other table when we walked in. However when the bar tender was finished he greeted us kindly and told us to sit wherever we liked.   We sat near the back, there was only one server around. She took a little bit of time to actually come and greet us. However, she was very friendly and got us menus and drinks right away.  After we got our drinks, another server actually came  to get our food order. She was very friendly as well and our food came out real quick! It was so delicious and it tasted fresh! I love how they serve healthy tasty food!   Overall the food was great and the service was good! I would definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"I've been to 5 Pita Jungle restaurants in the area and this is the BEST one. The food and service is always spot on. My next favorite is the one at the Scottsdale Fashion Mall."}
{"text":"Pita jungle has been one of my favorite places since I moved to Phoenix in 2011. I have ventured to 3-4 locations and always have enjoyed the food. I currently live 5 minutes away from this Tatum location so I come here quite often. The service is always good and consistent. I have never had a problem what the menu offers (of course), but my issue lies in the consistency of the kitchen. Specifically at this location the quality of the food always varies.   The best example I could give is that I am a creature of habit. I order a side of garlic mushrooms every time I make an order, without fail. It seems as if in the past few months the recipe has changed or they are just prepared differently depending on the chef who makes them. Who knows- sometimes they are amazing, and sometimes they taste like they have barely touched a hot pan or have barely any garlic. Maybe it's just me, but I feel the consistency of the plates I normally order is lacking.   Otherwise, I would have definitely rated 5 stars!"}
{"text":"The only reason I gave this a 4/5 is because most of the time that I come in the servers are usually rude. Last night when I went in with a friend to have dinner I had a really nice man for a waiter, I forgot his name, and he redeemed the place for me.   The food is always amazing. Cilantro jalape√±o hummus? AWESOME! Always a good meal and I usually have some to take home with me. I would recommend this place to pretty much anyone.   And anyplace that I can order a Woodchuck is already a good place for me ;-)"}
{"text":"I'm addicted to the Mahi Mahi with hummus. The only problem is that I always ask for it without pico on top and they ALWAYS put pico on it. Literally every time.   My husband really enjoyed their vegetarian burger. I also like both their green and black teas. Service is friendly but not always prompt n  We do wish it wasn't quite so loud so we could hear each other more clearly."}
{"text":"Great food but the worst service possible. Servers never ask how the food is, don't fill waters, and basically avoid customers entirely after setting your food down. We have eaten here multiple times and it's always the same - such a shame because the food is so good."}
{"text":"Normally, I'd give it a 4 star review. Have been coming here for years and years.  Lately though, service is getting worse, and the kitchen is failing completely.  Went in today with a friend, our server Christina, was amazing as always. Great lady with a great attitude, always.  Placed our order - 45 minutes later, we were still waiting. We had watched as two tables of 4 were seated, ordered, served, and left.  We had to take our food 'to go' as we were out of time.  Manager never came over to check up on us, despite being told by Christina.  It gets old hearing \"the kitchen staff is on high turnover\" and \"we're sorry!\"   I drove 20 minutes to my appointment, opened my takeout to find my order COMPLETELY WRONG.  It's frustrating when you are willing to pay good money for decent food, but don't get it.  I hate to say it, but I don't think I'll be back anytime soon. There's only so many second and third and fourth chances you can give before speaking with your wallet."}
{"text":"I don't like the way two stars looks, but I really have experienced better Greek food in better establishments.   I went on a Friday night and they were extremely busy. The noise level was ridiculous and we were placed less than a foot from the people eating next to us. We all heard each other's conversations and I was practically rubbing elbows with a stranger. Not my kind of place, but I noticed a lot of the people in the place seemed happy.   The food itself is just...okay. For the price, I'd have thought a pita would come with SOMEthing, but it didn't.   The waiter was friendly and kept our water glasses filled. He went so far as to offer water to go, but what's the point when we were never left thirsty? Lol."}
{"text":"The service is very good.  The prices are ok.  The meat could be marinated or flavored a bit more and they don't seem to spread the meat and vegetables evenly in the pita sandwiches.  Otherwise, not a bad place to eat."}
{"text":"I've stopped by this location a couple times over the past month and both times have received good service.  The inside is new and clean, the wait staff had no problem splitting the checks for our group.  I'm on a no carb/no potato kick and the wood fired chicken has been my go to on both occasions (roasted veggies substituted for the mashed potato), the portion was very generous for only $9.99!  I probably could have taken half of it home for another meal but it tasted so good I polished it off with no regrets."}
{"text":"Joshua was so amazing! He recommended this off menu Spicy Shrimp dish that was possibly the best thing I've ever eaten! I'm calling in advance to make sure he's in so I can eat that again! Give the man a raise!"}
{"text":"Ah Pita Jungle. I've been going there for 14 years now. They served me my first hummus. I've had a number of friends who worked there over the years. The service is the only dynamic factor in my rating. I've run the gambit as far as that is concerned. Overall they are solid. If you are a dip person, try ordering a half and half order of their garlic dip and hummus. Totally worth it. Their shawarma always hits the spot. The falafel platter is the best buy for the money."}
{"text":"This is the best Pita Jungle I've been to. The workers are super polite and cool. Shoutout to Dwight in particular, great service!"}
{"text":"We would not come here except Ashley C makes it a great experience. The food and drinks at happy hour are unbeatable. Way to go Ashley!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try Pita Jungle for quite a while. I literally pass it everyday as I commute home. Let me tell you, it was everything I thought it would be...amazing!  Went during the lunch rush, like only a crazy person such as myself would. Walked in and we were seated immediately. Our server came over promptly and took our orders. I kid you not, we were there for about 7-10 minutes and got our food within that time. I was flabbergasted!   I ordered the beef and lamb gyro. It was the largest, most succulent and flavorful gyro I've had to date. Get this....9 bucks! Well 9.48 with tax...CRAZY! The other person in my party had the hummus trio (cilantro/jalape√±o, roasted red pepper, and original). The cilantro/jalape√±o was my favorite. Not one flavor overpowered the other. I might even suggest the flavor of the jalape√±o be a bit more present, but it was just phenomenal.   All in all, our dining experience lasted about 20-25 minutes. Talk about stellar and unheard of during the lunch rush? Bravo, Pita Jungle...Bravo!"}
{"text":"Good food. Healthy food to be exact. Crazy portion sizes. Salads are enormous. Hummus is to-die-for. Always friendly and helpful with things I don't understand on the menu. The pizza are great here and I always get them on the lavosh bread. I rarely support chain restaurants, however here they keep it good, simple and me a regular."}
{"text":"Welp. If you like ROCKS in your food this is a good place to go... ordered the chicken del sol, it was great until I munched on a ROCK(no joke) in my food! I told the waiter, he seemed surprised and brought the manager over who was pretty laid back about it.. \"they come in our beans sometimes, I've had them before...\" are you f-ing kidding me!? I tried to be pretty easy going about it, luckily I didn't break a tooth..   But there was no real apology or any type of discount applied to the bill, I guess if I want to eat rocks this is the place!  I don't ever write bad reviews, but this deserved it."}
{"text":"I have ordered a couple of party trays.  We had so much food! It was so tasty and we had so much food! Now that I have tried it, I will be ordering all the time when I have a party. There is no way I could make all this good for the price! It was for 10-12 but I would think it could feed 20. We had chicken combo and Mediterranean antipasto. It was nicely packaged with all the utensils.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I have been eating at this joint for the last 4 years. I have probably paid for someones college. The food is always amazing. The staff is always friendly and the garlic dip and hummus is out of sight. (That means \"FANTASTIC\" for those born after 1990)  I give it a 10 on a scale of 1-Awesome. Go. Eat. Now."}
{"text":"The food is always good, but it can be hard to get in and out and back to work in an hour.  It gets busy and I think they could use another server or two during the lunch rush to get the patrons in and out.   Parking is rough, so leave early (do an early lunch).  I usually still have to park a couple blocks away.  Not bad when the weather is nice, but I can see it being misery in August."}
{"text":"I love Greek food but I have eaten here at least five times and I will now only go to it if a friend chooses it. The acoustics are awful and I feel like I am hearing everyone except who I am with.  No one who serves customers has a smile. If I spend money I expect the servers to act like they enjoy their jobs. I love to tip but at Pita Jungle I feel like I am giving money away to servers who hate their jobs and are annoyed with anybody that they must serve. This is my first negative review. It's such a nice place so it annoys me that the service is subpar. I've had better Greek food just about everywhere else I go.  I had high hopes for this place, but it is just not good (especially for the price)."}
{"text":"This place is close to our house and we love the food...BUT the service, the 6 out of 7 times we have eaten here, is beyond frusterating! I only give it 2 stars because of the POOR service. Maybe they just need to work out the kinks...but, when? Great food but go when you have all the time in the world! The service will KILL YOU!  If you go to this location, ask for Colleen. She was wonderful."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant chain. It was my first trip to this location.  I always order the Mahi Mahi with hummus and chips because it's too good to pass up. This time it tasted \"fishy\" rather than delicate. Service was good."}
{"text":"So we were supposed to go swimming the night before a flight...we didn't.  We came to Pita Jungle, at first I felt we were alone which is not what I really like from a restaurant but then it became zip zippity with the service.  We ordered the soup and the Spicy Chicken wrap and these seem to be the steady option for when I want #health at Pita Jungle."}
{"text":"Myself and 3 coworkers went in for lunch. This place has been cleaned up, service and food have been polished. Hummus and chicken never disappoints. Salmon burger with garlic potatoes are a home run. The happy hour prices can't be beat."}
{"text":"I was already a long-time Pita Jungle fan but was a little skeptical about how the food court version would be.   Would the menu be extremely limited?  How long would I be standing there waiting for my order?  These were just a few of my concerns.  But once I saw the huge and delicious Lentil Fattoush salad (my PJ \"usual\"), I knew this location was totally legit.  The Lentil Fattoush was just how I remembered it at other locations, and the vegetarian chili was great as well - so hearty and flavorful you hardly notice it's meat-free.  The wait-time was remarkably short, too.  What a great way to fuel up on something healthy before, during, or after a shopping expedition at Fashion Square."}
{"text":"I've been here many times in the past 2 years and have never had a bad experience.  The food has tons of flavor and always manages to feel light/healthy no matter how much I gorge myself!  There is also a cool, artsy vibe to the place.  I usually start out with the baba ganoush, which is pure eggplanty, garlicky goodness.  For a main dish, I really like the glazed chicken lavosh pizza.  It is very sweet for a pizza though so it may not appeal to everyone's palate.    The Pesto Lavosh Turkey Wrap made with chicken is also a winner.  When I asked if it was possible to make it with chicken instead of turkey, the waitress wholeheartedly endorsed that option, saying she always gets it like that.  The Mediterranean Platter is also delicious and a great way to sample a handful of different things.    Much as I love PIta Jungle, I'll admit I've had a couple of things I wouldn't necessarily recommend, so here you go.  The Caribbean Salad is just a huge fruit salad covered with coconut shavings that I don't think is too special.  The Spicy Chicken Wrap was just okay - the chicken had a great kick but the rice, beans, and [steamed?] vegetables were kinda bland and brought down the overall flavor.  Still, plenty of great options here!"}
{"text":"Excellent fresh salads and pitas.  Be warned - the portions are big, if you think about getting a side and are not ravenously hungry don't!"}
{"text":"Pita Jungle is one of my favorites in town!  The food is amazingly crisp and fresh, and they have some inventive combinations as well as some authentic offerings.  The place can be a bit pricy depending on what you get, but it's a good value if you stick to the basics.  Eat at Pita Jungle - you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"The only thing louder than the deep cuts of Arcade Fire blaring and the bad paintings on the walls is the screech of the metal chairs scraping across the concrete floor.   Too loud for anything but takeout. Though the staff may be friendly, the place is virtually as inhospitable as an actual jungle."}
{"text":"Maybe i was just really hungry. The food was delish and very satisfying! Good service, too. :)"}
{"text":"Pita Jungle is one of my favorite restaurants to go!   The kiddos also love their food.   My MIL joined us for dinner and I insisted we shared the Chicken Schwarma and the Mediterranean Chicken Salad.   She loved it!!.  My daughter finished up their kids meal with is a plate full of healthy goodness (Chicken, carrots, fruit and Mac and cheese)."}
{"text":"Thank you to the manager who cleared up an issue that could have made my wife very ill. Ordered item that listed honey and asked waitress to leave off the honey which she said could be done. Manager later came over and informed my wife that the honey was mixed in and could not be removed.  Wait staff needs to be more informed as my wife could have gone into diabetic coma. Thankful for manager being on top of things.  Ordered a gyro instead and really enjoyed. Would give 5 stars if it weren't for waitress's ignorance"}
{"text":"If I could put 0 stars I would. The fact that I came in and they told me they were already closed which the time on the door said they were still open is outrageous. With the guy behind making the food seriously had an attitude problem and was completely rude. Will never be back to this pita jungle ever again."}
{"text":"I am currently eating at pta jungle at desert ridge... they have the best service & the guy named Kyle is the most nicest & really great at his job. My favorite spot here on out for sure :-)"}
{"text":"Tried this Pita Jungle a little over a month ago. Usually not into chains, but this place was pretty good. Good food, good service, and great music and atmosphere.   We had Spanokopita, I had a gyro, and my daughter had a chicken pizza.   Spanokopita was good, gyro could've used a touch more meat, and the pizza was good. Overall: affordable, good place to grab a fresh tasting bite with Mediterranean flare!"}
{"text":"This was my first time at Pita Jungle. I ordered the hummus trio which was amazing. Also the chicken tikka masala which was also yummy. I'll be back for the food only, likely takeout but the overall customer service was lacking. I didn't feel valued as a customer."}
{"text":"I always order the spicy chicken wrap! And it's always delicious! The staff is very friendly but service itself is slow. Wish it didn't take 30-40 min for one wrap."}
{"text":"Clean environment, friendly staff, and awesome food. It's always busy at this location, but that's a good sign. They have fantastic curb side pick-up if you call ahead. Love their food."}
{"text":"Smoothest, creamiest hummus Ive had. All three flavors are great and paired with some whole wheat pitas and some marinated chicken= WIN. Fair prices and huge portions."}
{"text":"I would have enjoyed my experience much more but it was way too loud. I was with a friend a we had a hard time hearing each other.  The hummus was wonderful, and the amount of food was generous.  However the other food was just ok. It was not at the level I expect for the price."}
{"text":"I was in Phoenix this past weekend for work and my friends took me to Pita Jungle - AMAZING!  We don't have anything like that in Utah and I was in heaven.  I had the chicken swarma pita (twice- don't judge) and it was SO, SO good.  I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Horrible horrible place to eat!!!!  I ordered the broiled fish sandwich and it was awful!!!  Absolutely no flavor at all!!!  The potatoes were not hot nor flavorful!!!  Our server didn't even ask how our food was and I'm sure he noticed that the fish sandwich was not eaten!!!  What a waste of money!!!  So disappointed!!!  Will never return and will not recommend this place to anyone!!!  I'll stick with Pita Kitchen!!!  Much better food and value!!!"}
{"text":"Horrible!!!  Chicken Tikka Masala was \"Freezer Burnt\".  Will never go there again!  It took a while to figure out the off taste, but finally did & fortunately didn't get sick from it.  Couldn't finish, because it was so bad, bad, bad@"}
{"text":"Had such a yummy lunch and received unbelievable service from Tiffany! She was so attentive and anticipated our needs without us even asking! A wonderful experience!"}
{"text":"Great food and great prices!  Don't pass this place by!  The menu is awesome and they never let you down on service!"}
{"text":"We had a disappointing dinner here tonight.  They were out of Pinot Grigio.  My knife was dirty.  The waiter forgot to bring the appetizer.  Service was generally inattentive.  The food was fine except the potatoes were rock hard and dry.  When I tried to cut one it launched from the plate onto the floor.  The potatoes are served in a very small dish that makes cutting them more difficult.   I've had many lovely dinners at Pita Jungle locations but not tonight."}
{"text":"SO EXCITED to have Pita Jungle so close to our home! Yipee!!!!! If you haven't been OR you have been and you haven't had the  \"Caramelized Cauliflower with Tahini\", YOU MUST ORDER THIS!!! It's a great appetizer and easily shared amongst two people. I love the chicken tiki masala as well, YUMMERS!!!!   Of course this location is pretty new so they have \"things\" to work on but stop by and give them a try!"}
{"text":"Ohe of my favorite places to eat at when I visit fellow Zumba Instructors in the area. We teach a class and make it a ritual to come to this location. Friendly staff, great service and AMAZING FOOD!!!! I order the chicken tika masala. YUMMY and the carmelized cauliflower!!!! It's A MUST ORDER!!!"}
{"text":"Great food, awesome chicken masala!! Love it all.   One thing I don't get is why the girls who work there dress like they do!? Tight outfits and they all have that \"i'm too good for you\" attitude.  Other than that, food is delish!"}
{"text":"always the best!!  if you want a healthy meal option for your kids at a decent price, this is the place to go!!"}
{"text":"This place is always busy but for me it is hit and miss.  Sometimes the food is delishious and sometimes it is rotten."}
{"text":"I am a regular here - as well as the other valley locations - this one is closer to home though.  I feel like I know their menu without looking and I mix it up everytime I'm there - its great to order a few different appetizers and share everything - the more the merrier. I always feel that everything is really fresh and healthy. I have never had a bad meal here - however sometimes the service may be a little inconsistent. It's still worth a visit - its healthy, cheap and very casual."}
{"text":"This place is always consistently amazing! I love the salads and the wraps... They give you large portions and always choose the best ingredients.. They have seasonal options which I also like... hummus is to die for!"}
{"text":"Service was friendly and quick, the atmosphere was inviting (a little loud with families and lots of people), and the food was delicious!! Large portions that I had plenty to take home for another meal."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place and I'm so happy there's one in central phoenix now. My favorite is the chicken hummus with cucumbers. And the Mediterranean chicken shwarma."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, fantastic location, very very cool. Not too expensive, totally worth it. Does wonders for the poor Phoenix Downtown scene. I love it.   Downtown love  Have fun"}
{"text":"Great healthy food, love these guys..menu choice is great, bring back the coconut curry please , please.."}
{"text":"So the food here is really really tasty and fresh. Their grilled chicken salad is awesome. Also the fruit and cheese plate is delicious and huge. The service has always been friendly and fast and their pizzas are so good."}
{"text":"I went with a friend for the 1st time.. I had a Gyro platter 3 weeks ago.  Sad. They have bland meat that is not on a Gyro Spit .. They pan fry it. The prices are high for the atmosphere ... The service was great, it is a fun place. I will go back and try something other than a Gyro."}
{"text":"Pita Jungle is easily one of my all time favorite restaurants. The dark, candle-lit atmosphere and the local artwork that is featured makes for a really chill place to have a delicious dinner.  I personally love the broiled chicken pita, a simple chicken pita with a little extra flavor. The hummus and chicken is also really tasty. They also have really good iced-tea.   The place usually is pretty busy, but I've never had to wait more than 5 minutes to be seated and their service is always quick. This is the perfect place to go whether with a group of good friends or on a date."}
{"text":"I got food poisoning eating at this location. I ordered the Gyro and cilantro hummus. Later on that evening I was vomiting profusely.  It was either the bad meat or a cook who has bad hygiene. I will never eat at this location again. Neither should you."}
{"text":"Spacious patio and sit down inside seating. The food was very good and the hummus was creamy-I just wish that they gave you more pita bread. The portions are appropriate and not too large ..we definitely will be going back."}
{"text":"Excellent! great location, great atmosphere, good prices, excellent service, excellent food. Stopped in for dinner, had the spicy chicken wrap, excellent. The Berry ice tea is excellent too. Five Stars."}
{"text":"Pita Jungle is generally kid-friendly and we've come here a lot for that reason.  I don't know if I'm just getting burned out on the place, but it really doesn't seem to hold up in comparison to the Tempe location.  Generally the staff is pretty inattentive.  We are often left without water, or milk and they forget to bring things to the table.  The kids meal here gives surprisingly small portions compared to other locations.  It is common to see 4 or 5 little quarter-sized slices of carrot on the plate.  We pretty much need to order more veggies every time, which takes forever and they charge us for it.  I love Pita Jungle, but this location.... not as much."}
{"text":"This was not my favorite Pita Jungle location.  It was a bit empty on a week night and the service was just okay.  Had some of the happy hour for items and they are mostly not memorable.  The hummus trio is good.  Tried a lentil soup that was super thick and not really edible .  I didn't care for the bland flavor at all.  Also had the cauliflower appetizer which was the best part of the meal."}
{"text":"I'm not sure I am as big of a fan of this restaurant as others are.  Number one the restaurant was PACKED.  Every table taken and people standing around.  Granted I came on a Friday night but this is a big restaurant and I could hardly walk to my table or the bathroom, ect. without bumping people, purses, ect.  Number two the restaurant is LOUD.  I want to eat in peace.  Good things are the way the children's menu is set up.  You pick a carb, a protein and a veggie.  Then you get fruit and a drink all for a low price.  The food is served on a tray so that each food item is separate.  The kids enjoyed that.  The falafel balls are good.  The babaganouj is really good.  The hummus I didn't care for... at least the original flavor that I had.  The stuffed grape leaves were just okay.  I didn't like that random olives were scattered on the vegetarian sampler plate.  I accidentally ate one with a bite of other food and almost broke a tooth."}
{"text":"Loving Hut was closed tonight (Sunday) and so I opted for this new spot on my radar. Let me just start by saying what a beautiful restaurant.  Pretty decor accompanied by a pretty and attentive staff.  Started the night off with the Hummus and Taboule served with pita as an appetizer, it was me and two other guests so the waitress was nice enough to add two more pitas for each of us.  The hummus trio was DELICIOUS, spicy, pungent, and the taboule the perfect accoutrement.  The dish came out before we were even done with figuring out what we wanted for our entree.  Excellent service!  Not to mention the plate was hearty enough to feed a starving commune in Africa.  I ordered the falafel pita and my guests had the Mediterranean chicken pita and the other had the Greek salad (she's not the one to take out to dinner) haha i was so mad i was like whatt??? you ordered the salad??  but i guess you could blame it on the waiter kind of rushing the order (it was sunday night at 8:00 with not much other people in the restaurant so i could see why he would want us out quick.)  Before we were even half finished with our hummus appetizer our entrees were on the table.  My falafel was a little crunchy and felt like it should have been more fresh, kind of made me wonder how it came out so quick, they probably had pre-made falafel on the side and just threw it in.  but i still love falafels and this had some serious spice and flavor, i couldn't complain.  After reading reviews on here I told the waiter to order my guest the mango raspberry cheesecake and she was in love!!  The waiter brought out some boxes for our unfinished plates and we happily obliged.  He then brought some extra pitas wrapped up after i already paid for the bill which i thought was awesome!  I was checking out their happy hour specials and they looked very appealing, $1 to $3 Tapas with $3 imports after 9 sounded like a plan to me.  Definitely coming back here!!"}
{"text":"I thought this place was going to be awesome based on reviews & a recommendation. WRONG.  The gyro was an absolute joke! It's beyond me that a Mediterranean restaurant would serve pre sliced gyro meat.   And pickles on a gyro?! Insanity.  We were from out of town so maybe I'm just spoiled with meat off the spit (Kronos) gyros.  My fianc√© had the chicken combo plate.  The chicken was seasoned ok but the rice was undercooked.  The beans that came with it were good. I'll skip this joint next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Pita jungle is awesome. my two favorite items are chicken shawarma pita and seared ahi tuna w/ hummus. Both of those items cannot be beat for the price. I go with my friends all the time and no one has ever said anything but \"awesome!\" Sometimes when they are busy it takes a while to get your food - but this is super rare."}
{"text":"Went for lunch on a Friday. We were seated in the patio right away. As soon as we sat down the server came & took our drink order.  Holy moly the hummus here is to die for. Get the trio. The jalape√±o & red pepper are to die for. Seared ahi tuna was a little over cooked. Sizes are big enough to share.  Great service & yummy healthy food."}
{"text":"Love this location, always very clean and the staff is super nice. Our order always comes out correctly and quick. I highly recommend this location."}
{"text":"This service was great we had never been here before and Billiam was our server and he helped us with the menu and let us try some different sauce he was very friendly. That food was also great I got the California beach lavish wrap with chicken and it was so good. It was alot of food also it came with a Greek salad we will definitely be back we highly recommend PITA Jungle."}
{"text":"Be aware this site is franchised meaning it's not like other locations. Wanted to go for happy hour. Got 2 menus but no Hsppy Hour. Had to ask. Then it started. Well this is a corporate menu. We don't have the same things. Ok. Can I have the Happy Hour Chardonnay?  We no longer have that. Then why is it on the menu?  The Happy Hour scallops and the mussels are not available at this location. Again, why r u handing me a menu that says it is?? Garlic lemon chicken taps so dry. Supposed to come with pine nuts. Did not. Falafel so overdone I could not eat it. I canceled my order to go. I have eaten at several Pita Jungles including the original. Always had fabulous food. I am so disappointed in this location. Whoever oversees the kitchen needs to b fired. This location is a disgrace to the. Corporate Pita Jungles. Only reason I gave it one star was the server was amazing. He took off the food I couldn't eat and my wine was complimentary. He apologized profusely. Was not his fault. I love pita jungle but will find another location. This one sucks."}
{"text":"I have always loved pita jungle but now more than ever. I am obsessed with the chicken pasta salad. The lemon vinaigrette is so delicious I drown my pasta in it! I love all of their teas. The staff here is incredible and they all treat me and my boyfriend really well!"}
{"text":"Pita Jungle is a fantastic restaurant -- this was my first time to this location and everything was delicious.  I've only been to the location on Shea so was glad to see more sites. We ordered takeout on a monsoon summer night -- would have liked to have eaten there. The restaurant was fairly empty because of the harsh weather. It's a nice place with a full bar and kitchen area.  I ordered the chicken shawarma with rice which was delicious. We also ordered pita bread and a variety of dips. The rest of my family enjoyed their entrees too.  This style of food is usually delicious and mostly healthy. Pita Jungle does everything well."}
{"text":"Pita Jungle has a variety of healthy food options as well as a full bar. Their service is very quick and their food is noticeably fresh. I went here for the first time about two weeks ago and have been there once since. The gyros are great as well we their broiled chicken wrap. If you're looking for a fresh healthy food option I highly recommend Pita Jungle."}
{"text":"The service was incredible! David is a wonderful server! The food was fantastic as it always is at Pita Jungle! Fresh and yummy! The falafel was the best i've had! The portion sizes are HUGE and I can make 3 meals out of 1 from there, an the pricing for it is so reasonable! I highly recommend this place!  I've seen reviews from other people of this place, and maybe they didn't have the best service, but the other 2 locations I have been to, the one in Tempe and the one in Phoenix, have all been positive.  From what I was told, this place is all about the simplicity of food and the less done to it the better, as well as maintaining a casual atmosphere.  I appreciate this approach as the more you add to food, the less healthy it can become.  It is a very casual atmosphere, and since it is not a corporate establishment, you should not expect the wait staff to act like they come from a corporate owned restaurant unless they did, like our server was.  There are some non-vegetarian options as well as mostly vegetarian, and so far I have not had 1 disappointing meal.  My fiance, who's first Pita Jungle experience this was and is an avid eater, was extremely impressed with this place.  It's definitely worth the money and the food is very, very good!"}
{"text":"I decided to try this place while visiting my brother in Phx.   The restaurant was nearly empty, yet the service seemed to lack. I yearned for another napkin but never got one. Food wasn't bad (Greek salad and chicken cilantro/jalapeno hummus), but what bothered me the most was the bartender.  He was a big-mouthed young dude who kept disparaging the customers calling in to place order or pre-order for eating at the restaurant. I could heard him bitch and moan about the \"late\" order, yet the restaurant wasn't even close to closing.   I kept wondering how much he values his job. He seemed more interested in impressing one of the very young waitresses (dressed like a whore I might add). Where was the manager? Please get some \"adults\" to run this place and teach the youngsters to value having a job, and how professional conduct should rein at all times.  Jeez!"}
{"text":"We stopped in tonight because we had heard rave reviews about the one on Shea blvd.......this clearly is not the same owner,...... We were seated right away by a shabbily dressed hostess who didn't say too much, then a waitress with no name tag, a tank top with her breasts showing and tattoos all over gave us our menus and walked away......she came back a few minutes later and took our order.....as this was going on, I watched a server with a baseball cap on serve food to tables with gloves on and garnish or whatever he was doing with the same pair of gloves.....now mind you, gloves are fine, but when you then proceed to wipe off whatever got on your gloves on the butt of your pants, that's where  I draw the line at nasty!!..I then read some of the reviews on here and was horrified that more than one review had complained of food poisoning!!!! Oh hell no!!!!  I told my husband we need to go, and told him what I had observed, and the reviews on here.....we booked it on out of there before our food even came.....I will not return......not unless they clean up their sloppily dressed wait staff and teach them some \" clean\" ways to serve food and proper ways to dress.....get them some nice t shirts with your logo on it or something....and for gods sake, a name tag!!...people serving things in a tank top with breasts exposed isn't my idea of professional or clean......and clearly if people are getting food poisoning, maybe someone needs to teach the cooks a little more about food safety."}
{"text":"I was hanging out with my vegetarian friend and she had a taste for Greek, so voila, we ended up at Pita. I was personally not that excited about it because I have been at the Desert Ridge location and have not been impressed, but I personally think my palate has improved and now I'm more into greek, Lebanese, and other flavors I wasn't as much into before. This place is much more cozier and intimate than the Desert Ridge location, and the service was good. My friend had an issue with her plate. But it was fixed in a jiffy. There's a big danger here though... They're right next door to an cookie ice cream parlor (lol). And I almost fell for it, but other than that the food was ok, and looking forward to trying other items in the menu"}
{"text":"Had to wait a little for a table.  The first time we were seated was right by the open kitchen.  It was so loud that we asked to be moved.  We had to wait again for a new table.  The waiter wasn't overly friendly or helpful.  (In fact he spilled one of our glasses of wine.  He right away brought over a new glass (in case the first one had a crack in it) but didn't bring a replacement of the wine until we asked and even then he brought like 1 oz.  I'm sure more than that spilled and it seemed rude not to just replace the entire glass of wine.)  I had a cucumber cocktail that was so good I had two.  Also, we shared the sampler of hummus that was delicious.  For my meal I ordered the caprese plate with pita chips.  It was amazing.  Really, really good.  My only complaint is that it only came with 3 wedges of pita chip.  I needed more and was charged $2.99 for a small plate.  Darn!  If the food and drink weren't so good I would never come back!  ;)"}
{"text":"I've eaten at the old Tempe location for several years and would order take out lunch from here a couple of times a week but the new Mill location is ridiculous for trying to pick up your order. Too inaccessible and no take out parking. I'll no longer be getting lunch from here."}
{"text":"I really don't think you can go wrong with pita jungle, and this location was my favorite place to go when I was living on this side of town still.   I usually get the hummus trio with chicken or the garden veggie wrap is always great and feeds me for two days. I really like the atmosphere at this location and whenever I'm around this area for work, or a movie, I make it a priority to stop in and get food from Cat and Josh (both great servers).   Definitely stop in or get food to go, you won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"Yesterday they had a small mishap on my order and i was unable to go back in for them to correct it. They told don't worry we'll take care of it. They did today without any questions. Kuddos to this place you still have me as a loyal customer."}
{"text":"Always loved their happy hour specials. One of the best black bean burgers I've ever had. Their Kafta Burger hit the spot as well.   Bartender served us tonight and didn't have any good recommendations for beer which kind o blew my mind but the food was delicious, atmosphere was cool and service was adequate."}
{"text":"Had dinner here with a friend and enjoyed my dining experience.  The ambiance was wonderful and  the staff was friendly and helpful regarding menu suggestions.  It's great place for a romantic evening (outside is best), girl's night out or just a family dinner.  I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Absolutely so bomb!!!!!!! Seriously, i got the ahi tuna appetizer in hummus and the tomato, basil amd mozzarella appetizer as well. I have eaten there and ordered the same thing like 5 times in a row!!!!"}
{"text":"So, I might have been slightly wrong about Pita Jungle. Because of the Butterfly Effect, right after the ink on my PJ review dried, my buddy's wife wanted their takeout and since I hadn't been for a while, I thought it was only fair to the Yelp gods that I check my assessment's veracity.   My decision to get the jalapeno and cilantro hummus was heavily influenced by my spritual/culinary guide, Richard Z. He's usually right about two things: My neurotic behaviors that lead me to straight to crestfallonically laced internal disharmony and food.   It was tasty, indeed. And spicy enough to make me smile.   But here's why I'm bumping up the stars...  Our server said the funniest shit:  My friend asked:   How's the tuna melt pizza?  Awesome Server:   It smells terrible.  Friend:   Like Farts?  A.S.:   Like vagina (answers phone)  - Takes order. Puts phone down.  Well, not like my vagina.   Dallas and Friend:  ... (staring blankly)  Three Stars!"}
{"text":"Last time at this location! Women's bathrooms are dirty trash over flowing paper on the floor mirrors dirty, not sure they get cleaned daily.  Went for dinner earlier at 4 and received the wrong drink, cold pitas, and waited 10min to be acknowledged to order drinks. Food sat under the warmer and our waiter was mia. Will stay away now."}
{"text":"In Phoenix on business, needed a late take out dinner and having been to the Desert Ridge location, knew I would have great food. The food did not disappoint, but Mark, the bartender/takeout master went above and beyond. He made me feel right at home while waiting for my order to go, so much so that I plopped on a barstool and enjoyed a refreshing beer while I waited the seven minutes for my food. Needless to say, the food was ready to go before I was since after a 12 hour day at the office, I finally felt relaxed and stress free!   It's not usually relaxing to be a woman alone at a bar/restaurant, but I will definitely be back here on my next business trip to Phoenix!  Awesome place and amazing staff!"}
{"text":"Had dinner here tonight and so happy with the food, service and of course that there's finally one of these close to my work and home!  It's new and lovely but with all the wonderful Mediterranean food we've grown to expect and love from Pita Jungle.   I had a delicious Strawberry Banana smoothie, a good sized portion of a spanakopita for my starter and wonderfully fresh falafel hot pita for my entree. I'd highly recommend a visit and many again. It was buzzing but the service was still attentive. Bravo!"}
{"text":"After searching for some healthy food options close to our hotel I saw the great reviews about Pita Jungle. I wasn't quite sure if it was going to be more of a fast food place, which I didn't want, but decided to give it a try anyway.  Wow!  Food tastes so fresh and is very tasty.  Started with the lentil soup first, which was delicious. The pita chips they served with it were delicious!  I had the red quinoa and hummus salad. It was exceptional. Flavors were amazing!  It was so good I went back today to take one with me for lunch on the golf course.  Server was very nice and helped us make some decisions, since it was our first time at Pita Jungle. This is a new favorite \"go to\" for me when I visit Scottsdale. You won't be disappointed with the food."}
{"text":"As a regular guest at this restaurant I want to give a shout out to the crew for their consistent quality of tasty, healthy, dishes. My personal favorite is the grilled salmon dinner, served with spinach and garlic mashed potatoes. I have never had cause for disappointment, ever. Thanks to an ever changing menu, rather than just resting on their laurels, I've enjoyed dishes such as ahi tuna salad, excellent red quinoa pilaf, and many others.  The small bar, always packed with Erica the bartenders legion of adoring fans, is always fun, congenial and well stocked. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"The BEST hummus I have had.  No lie.  Creamy, yet light, flavorful, yet not too much so...it was heaven in my mouth, served on a warm pita...delightful!  I could've eaten an embarassingly large bowl of it and had that been enough.    Falafel was tasty and my taboule was light and refreshing, the fruit platter looked huge and delicious...everything was beautifully presented, colorful, and just tasty.  I felt tragically unhip here, but alas, I kind of already am tragically unhip.  However, when I'm in the Phoenix-area again and craving some serious hummus, I will face the hipsters and come back.  Scoff if they must, I need pureed garbanzo beans like nobody's business."}
{"text":"I am a really picky tipper. I need some exceptional service to tip the whole 15%. However, i tipped 50% here...why? Because our server was SO NICE. He was beyond exceptional.  I'm currently on a primal diet (no dairy, no gluten, no processed anything). I told him my diet limitations and he didn't seem fazed in the least. He told me about other ingredients that he'll remove that wasn't mentioned on the menu, and was super helpful and accommodating of my weird eating habits.  Plus! The food was good! The place was clean! The atmosphere was really relaxed and casual.  This place was great and I'll definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"I've come here once a month for the past couple months and just like other pita jungle locations, I always really like the food and the service.   I had Jennifer today as my server and she was really nice! I ordered the buccaneer wrap (spicy chicken with curry sauce and a side salad is what it comes with) and it was divine. I usually get the hummus trip because I love their shawarma, but dared to be a bit different today and it definitely paid off.  It's a bit cold in this location but I like the open floor plan quite a bit, it's great for people watching.  Will definitely bring friends in for happy hour sometime, because their specials are pretty great.    Thanks Pita! You're a keeper for The Tukee!"}
{"text":"SIMPLY the BEST Coming to Desert Ridge in Jan. 09!!!!!!!!! West side of Tatum -North of 101 -in corporate officepark"}
{"text":"The darndest thing happened tonight at Pita jungle. I ordered the yellowfin salad.  It was exactly as described in the menu. No complaints there.   Both my wife and my sister-in-law ordered the avocado chicken salad and-of all things there is no avocado in the salad. Not a shred.  I mentioned to our waitperson Madeline about the absence of avocado in the avocado salad and she said I guess they forgot to put in it. I was gobsmacked  In all fairness though Madeline made it right by crossing it off our bill.  Other than that I love PJ and will come again. The menu is terrific!!!!"}
{"text":"A solid 4 stars for their eclectic menu selections. I had the poke salad, the wife a chicken tostada, the BIL a salmon dish, and the SIL a burger. All were most interesting culinary choices.  Now the cons. One  being buried in a strip mall was not to my liking. The general view was the parking lot with cars, people walking, etc. that is a 2 star feature. Waitstaff was amateur hour. They got the wrong table, and when we demurred they insisted it was what we ordered. That was a two star performance. So, their composite was a weak 3 stars. I think I would return if only for the food."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants!  Fun atmosphere and terrific food. The service has always been great too!"}
{"text":"This place is Good.  The food looks and tastes very fresh.  I don't think I've ever been to a Mediterranean restaurant that was extremely clean and modern.  The service was very good and the food was extremely good.  I don't live in Arizona but if I am ever within an hour of one I will make my way to it.  Pita Jungle people, please open one in So Cal."}
{"text":"My son wanted to eat somewhere healthy so we went here.  It was my first time and I loved it!  I don't think that you can go wrong with anything on the menu.  Also the kids menu is great and teaching kids about healthy eating.  Very cool!"}
{"text":"The Pita Jungle has delicious but healthy food.  My son 8 year old  is the one who originally  turned to this place.  They even offer healthy meals for kids and educate them on how to eat healthy.  I need to make sure to visit the Pita Jungle more often."}
{"text":"One of my favorite lunch spots by the office.  But I will gladly go there anytime for a delicious and healthy meal.  I love the wood fired veggie salad with a tasty chicken breast on top.  Also do yourself a favor and start off with the roasted cauliflower."}
{"text":"I went here on a recommendation from a friend. It is located in a plaza so parking was a breeze. We went on a Sunday night, so it was fairly busy. But we were seated immediately and greeted by a waiter soon thereafter. I have to mention that there is no uniform in this place so the waiters/waitresses look live average Joes / Jills. When our waiter approached our table, I actually though he was just some guy coming to say \"What's Up\" and to meet some new people.  There is plenty of seating in this place. There is a patio outside also but since my visit was during the abominable Phoenix summer, I elected to sit inside.   The food is quite good. I ordered the hummus as an appetizer and it was served with pieces of Pita on the side. The hummus was tasty and creamy while the Pita was soft and chewy. Perfect combination. For dinner, I got the bouillabaisse, which was quite good. It was definitely better than the one I got at Church & State and it was half the price."}
{"text":"The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. I ordered the chicken shwarma and my wife had the filaffel sandwich. Not sure of the spelling on those but both were great. My chicken sandwich seemed a bit dry but once I tasted the combo of the veggies chicken sauce and pickles it balanced well and was very tasty. We also ordered the Mediterranean plate. That was also very tasty."}
{"text":"More like 3.5 stars. Something was missing at this pj and I can't quite put my finger on it. I think it was - dare I say- the flavor!? The food was good but for instance, the garlic dip needed more garlic. It was good don't get me wrong ....but if you won't need any tic-tacs after noshing on garlic dip and pita bread then something is wrong with the dip. I feel like they used a mashed potato base and then just added some garlic. The fluffy texture was a little too fluffy. Not bad but just a bit off. The chicken was good but needed more splash of lemon. And the cilantro jalapeno needed some more cilantro. It didn't taste fresh at all. Not bad; but not zesty with flavor. Overall we vote that the food was Pretty Okay.    Our server was so sweet and so attentive. 5 starts for service. And the interior is great; the space is comfortable and fun.   It's just can we get the food back on track?"}
{"text":"The service at this Pita Jungle sucks! Sucks. sucks. sucks.   *Sorry for such a LONG review, but really, it's because I want to help you out here.   And, It's too bad because the food is absolutely delicious and I love the fun and healthy concept.  Two stars here..one for the food and one just because the whole concept of Pita Jungle totally completes me. I keep coming back for the zesty hummus and that oh-so-creamy garlic dip. Heaven! Warm pita bread never tasted so good except when it's from Pita Jungle. And at happy hour, who can beat less than ten bucks for your entire food and drink bill?   So what's the problem? I don't know. Ask the servers ...that is..if you can ever find one. I'm a pretty chill customer; if I don't get good service I give the benefit of the doubt and just figure my server likely had a bad day. I'll always give you another chance. But let me tell you what happened on 3 different occasions. I came on separate days; separate times of day; and had different servers each time:  First offense: Came in with a group of friends for reverse happy hour on a Friday night. Got seated right away. Took 10 minutes just for a server to come by and get our drinks ordered. No problem, we are a happy crowd just laughing and having a good time. Another ten minutes goes by. Hmmm..getting a bit hangry here.  Finally had to hunt down a server just to place our food order. Ugh. We finally get our food...the hangriness is satisfied. So tasty! But now we need refills. After another 10 minutes of hoping a server would check on us; ask us for a refill, clear up the plates - heck anything? Gosh, we start to feel like we are imposing or something. I tell you what, the place was packed and there were only 2 servers. For a Friday night with packed indoor seating plus an outdoor patio I can tell you that this just doesn't add up. Well, at this point we forget about ordering additional dip or drinks; just give us some more pita bread to finish up what we started here and let's get outta here. Waitress tells me Sorry, but we are closing and the kitchen is shut down. Um? Its only like 5 minutes past. And you know what, if you hadn't made us wait 20 minutes just to place our order we could have eaten and had our fill of it like centuries ago. Matter of fact, we could have left the building and gotten out of your busy way exactly 20 minutes ago. I was embarrassed that my dinner party left the place - still hungry and now late for our next adventure. Thanks a lot.  Second offense: Just me this time and I popped in for a second chance. Got seated right away. (hey, they got that part down right!) But then the same drama with trying to place my order happened all over again.  (Won't repeat it - just see above. exact same offense) Who is my server? Is anyone coming over? Here is a tip, Pita Jungle. I'm a cool chic, I love the bohemian vibe, and yes, it's totally cool that servers dress in what I shall call 'street wear' ...but if they insist on taking their sweet old time, I wonder if you can just give out a name tag or have them introduce themselves so I know who to hunt down? All I can see are a bunch of folks standing around, chit-chatting with each other. Oh wait, those are my servers hanging out by the bar area. I am all about whistle while you work, but can you just see about taking my order sometime? Well, I'm so happy the bussers here have it together. They were more helpful to bring a water and/or clear my plate than the servers. I guess they weren't elite enough to stand around and chit chat with the rest of the waitstaff.   Third offense: I notice that if you get a seat at the bar, you are literally sitting right across from someone and they can't MISS you at all. I figure this has to be the way to do it. Placing an order, getting a refill, hunting down the bill should never be a problem again. Right? hahaha..nice try! Came in again and plopped right at the bar. Got my food ordered. Check. Alright..I'm off to a good start. Minutes later my food arrives. hey, hey!! We almost nailed it. SIGH. But then..I was forgotten again. I find that after 15 minutes sometimes folks need a refill or a check-in on your meal. (Me, I just wanted a water actually. Well..at first. Then I lost track of all the things I needed because time turned into a quantum leap). I see in front of me 3-4 servers hanging out and laughing amongst themselves. It goes on for...well...ever. I look around the restaurant and the folks at the tables (inside and outside) seem to shift in their seats a bit. Finally I pipe into their private conversation and ask just for a quick water. They all glare at me as if I am completely interrupting them. How could I be so rude? Alrighty then. I'll just pay my bill and leave. Finally just chased down a busser (figured that part out!) and they took care of it.   No more stars for you. Look at this trend in similar Yelp reviews.  Should I give you yet another chance, Pita Jungle? C'mon, get your waitstaff in order."}
{"text":"Very good food.  Not that expensive.  New location opening up in Ahwatukee at Ray/I-10 by AMC theater.  The Hummus & Chicken appetizer is out of this world."}
{"text":"I'm been waiting for over an hour to get some items I ordered from the happy hour menu. Our waiter is a complete moron and apologized for nothing. Won't be back.   Update: the manager finally came over and comped our bill which wasVery nice. It has been so long that I was still a bit hungry when I left. I won't return to this location."}
{"text":"I feel very fortunate to live so close to my love, Pita Jungle. The best roasted red pepper hummus and everything I have ever tried has been perfect. A standard favorite is the pesto pizza and a fabulous recent discovery is the philly chicken pita. I love this place for a healthy alternative and I could totally eat here twice a week. Lots of great veg friendly options, also a bonus!"}
{"text":"Pita Jungle is my gold standard for Mediterranean food. Sure, it's more fusion than authentic, but the food is amazing, the portions are huge, and the prices are fantastic.   Every single time I come here, I get the Hummus with Chicken. They make hands down the best hummus I've ever had. It's smooth, creamy, with just the right balance of tahini, garlic, and garbanzo beans. They serve it with delicious hot, chewy pitas, and top it with a whole lot of roasted, spiced chicken and pine nuts. Outstanding.   Their other obvious Greek choices are damn good as well. The baba ganoosh is beautifully roasted and mashed, with just a bit of spiciness to it. The falafel is perfectly fried, without being burned or soggy, and richly flavored with cumin and chickpeas. The taboule is absolutely stellar and brightly flavored with parsley and lemon.   The pizzas and pita wraps are all pretty large, especially for the price. They offer a fair diversity of pre-arranged combos: everything from a philly cheesesteak pita (for the less adventurous) to a chipotle chicken lavosh pizza. There are salads and pastas as well, also presenting a mix of Mediterranean cuisine with more familiar flavors. Personally, I love the pizzas and end up ordering one about every time I go, my favorite being the lavosh pizza.  Honestly, you can't go wrong with anything here. Everything is fresh, healthy, delicious, and enormous. Even the daily specials have nearly always been wonderful (barring a poorly executed attempt at Tikka Masala). The wide diversity of the menu means that even people who don't care for Greek food will be able to find something enjoyable. But, the high quality of food also means those people may end up changing their minds."}

{"text":"Love puta jungle. Food is great and have decent selection of beers. However nickel and dime you. Ask for onions on salad and get charged extra. Come on an onion isn't that much."}
{"text":"It's about time I write a review for this place. I've been here numerous times, and am always pleased with the food and service. Since I'm pretty much a regular, the staff is usually very friendly and attentive. (I even bring them backed goodies during the holiday season.) The gazpacho, when available, is a must for me. All flavors of hummus are great, and usually some decent wine choices. Have tried many dishes, and haven't been dissatisfied. Their seems to be something on the menu for all tastes. Also, they're good about substitutions and variations when ordering. (Even Sally would be welcome!) This is one place I will ALWAYS recommend to people who haven't tried before."}
{"text":"I love all Pita Jungles. This one is brand new and looks great inside. Cool vibe, great food. A little noisy but it's not too bad."}
{"text":"I was so glad to see that Pita Jungle opened in downtown Phoenix.  It is great to have another fresh, healthy place to eat nearby.  The location is great in the historic Gold Spot building on Roosevelt Avenue.  They did a great job with the space - there is a nice outdoor patio, a fireplace near the bar and the exposed brick walls.  The service was friendly and efficient and the food was just as good as the other locations I have tried."}
{"text":"Pita jungle is the perfect place to go for good fast food versions of mediterranean food. It's quick and a decent price. Plus if your health concientious this is a good place. Plenty of vegetarian and vegan choices as well. They have stuff for meat lovers too. Make sure to grab happy hour.  It's 3 to 5:30 and 9 to close. Definitely worth the value."}
{"text":"Great food and service. I come here for lunch on my lunch breaks, and as of yet I haven't had a bad experience. Also wanted to mention we had and awesome sever on a very busy Sunday evening. Thank you (Mackenzie) you were great!  Keep smiling and giving all your customers a great visit! :)"}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner and everything was absolutely delicious!  The food was fresh and we were served promptly.  We were greeted by our waitress, Angel and found it very helpful that she assisted us with our questions about some menu items.  Besides being pleasant, she was very attentive during our dining experience.   We look forward to returning to dine in very soon and will be sure to request Angel as our server."}
{"text":"The meal I had was DELISH... I had the hummus with the seared Ahi Tuna.  The waitress even let me try all three types of their hummus (the roasted red pepper was my favorite) and the Ahi was a perfect medium rare.  Will definitely be back for that dish.  I also tried the chocolate baklava which was a nice twist from the traditional dessert.  Make sure to stop by and give them a try."}
{"text":"Wow! This used to be one of my top 3 restaurants. Visited this location yesterday and was so discouraged. A friend told me they almost chocked on a piece of really hard plastic, I decided to go anyway (accidents happen) and it's literally one on my favorite places.  We ordered a Medeterenian salad and the broiled chicken salad. The server was okay, I think she was new. I always mixup the broil chicken and the wood fired chicken even tough they are totally diffrent. I didn't have the menue infront of me; she had a hard time explaining it. But it was ok until the first few bites of the medeterenian salad. We were trying to explain that something was wrong with the salad. My friend always orders the Medeterenian salad or Greek salad. I told her the dressing was rancid. My friend wasn't feeling well. Poor girl was so sick she almost vomited. The manager never came out. When the server came back she told me she couldn't find the manager. Unlucky lady I know who the manager is since this USED to be on of my favorite places. I told her you were standing right next to him right before you walked over?! Horrible service. This is not an awesome spot. I'm not sure why they lowered their standards. Not only is the service horrible but the food made my friend sick.  No love to  and from this place. I'd definetly skip it."}
{"text":"I est at Pita often. Some great options are their various salads, pitas, and wraps. The whole menu rocks in general!"}
{"text":"All in all not too bad... the hummas is very good and the tabolie is OK... i have never actually sat there for dinner since i get takeout... the one thing i dont like is that they dont have fried kidby... if anyone knows where i can find it please let me know!!!"}
{"text":"This is our go to place for drinks in the neighborhood. Mike is an awesome manager and is attentive to his customers. Kyle can pour like nobody's business, and has the funniest corny comments.  Jenna rocks, but is only there mornings. This is a genuine \"Cheers\" type of atmosphere and they know you on a first name basis. If you are afraid of Mediterranean food, they have a killer Philly Steak Pita."}
{"text":"Ordered through Yelp, delivery by GrubHub.  No complaints w/ either of those services only w/ the food.  Cauliflower was warm only not roasted or wood-fired and hummus w/ chicken was completely missing the pine nuts.  Will NEVER order take from Pita Jungle again."}
{"text":"Pita Jungle hummus is my FAVORITE hummus ever!! I always enjoy the atmosphere, food and service here! :)"}
{"text":"Always come here for the chicken and hummus.  Food is very consistent, and staff accommodating to my requests for no pita and extra vegetables.  The place can get very loud, and is usually very busy, but service is timely."}
{"text":"My coworker/friend and I visit this Pita Jungle frequently as we work just 5 min down the street. The last time we were there we discovered the seasonal menu that had been the seasonal menu for months had changed. We had been eating at Pita Jungle more frequently than we used to specifically for the avocado chicken tostada menu item on that seasonal menu. It was in our opinion the best dish they had and would notice a lot of people around us ordering it as well. Needless to say we were quite disappointed the last time we were there that it was no longer available. I understand that seasonal menus change hence \"seasonal\". However, I would love to see the avocado chicken tostada be added to the regular menu, because it seemed to be quite popular and could be an everyday menu item. Now my friend and I have no reason to visit this establishment for lunch."}
{"text":"Solid pita joint.  We were in and out in 13 minutes, but the potatoes and the chicken shawarma pita were exceptional.  I expected more of a quick service establishment, but this is more of a sit down place.  Enjoy."}
{"text":"Great place and great atmosphere. My favorite spot for years. The food is always spot on. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I usually call orders in they are pretty quick, love the chicken salad and their turtle cheesecake is delicious."}
{"text":"Have never dined in but carry out has always been efficient and quality. Food always prepared as ordered, even with modifications. Food is always hot indicating their recommended time to pick up is on point. Pita jungle will stay in the rotation of carry outs we order. Wife has gluten allergy and still many options for her."}
{"text":"It's good. Lots of vegetarian options and its very possible for two people to eat for under $11."}
{"text":"Location, location, location.  Great building, easy to find, and conveniently close to my favorite downtown venue The Lost Leaf!  What a nice surprise - Happy Hour prices until 6pm on TAPAS (that's a fancy word for cute little plates of a variety of dishes).  Nice to try a variety and not commit to a big plate of one thing!  Good service, salmon salad was fresh and generous without being ridiculous.  Veggies were fresh, salmon was grilled perfectly and very fresh.  WORTH the drive downtown."}
{"text":"Loving the Pita Jungle! Almost twice a month my friends and I meet there for gossip and wine and mediterranean food.. AND the crowd reminds me a bit of DC... (silly I know!, but I love when guys are in suits at lunch! ).. hehe! ABOUT the food... Greek Salad.. if your watching your mid.. this is what I say works! Large or small .. the large too much for me.. but its a good salad. IF no dates that week! THEN 'splurge' on the Spinach Quesadilla. its on lavosh bread... and not over greasy.. their version of pico de gallo, is fresh and works with the quesadilla.. and the tsaziki is a plus.. all med cafes need an awesome tsaziki, after all its just a given! They have a full bar.. good wines.. Gazpacho rocks! AND Ive had the seared ahi with fruit salad.. YUM! the portions are big.. be prepared... :-)  NOW If I were here on a lunch hour.. idk..this place has a wait outside and in.. and its placement of tables is on the European scale (like elbow to elbow).. make friends , I guess!"}
{"text":"I won't be back. Tried this place 4 times and each time I'm disappointed. Chicken was super dry. Waited forever for food. Service was lacking. Relatively expensive for the quality of food and the dining experience."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this location for years now. I crave their salads at least twice a month. They are HUGE! I always get two big lunches out of one salad. At around $10 a salad that's a great deal!   It's funny how depending on who's in the kitchen how much their food can differ from day to day. On several occasions I've had to ask for a missing ingredient or dressing. They are always quick to get it for me so no harm no foul I suppose.   Their hummus and Baba Ganoush are Outstanding and it's hard for me not to eat a huge batch. In fact sometimes I simply order a small plate of each with a side of the grilled vegetables (also fantastic!) and call it a day.   The ambiance is casual and very loud. Don't come here if you just want to relax and get away from it all. I do like how they showcase various local artists every month by displaying their artwork on the walls. In fact, several years ago I bought a giclee taken along the Ganghese river and met with the photographer to pick it up. I now have a unique canvas hanging in our front room along with an interesting story behind it.   Sit on the patio when the weather is nice and order a Peach Sangria. Jeff, behind the bar will hook you up!"}
{"text":"Love the Curry Chicken Salad, Black Bean Burger hold the bun, extra Chipotle Hummus please (they're always so accommodating!) and the Pesto Turkey Lavosh wrap! Portions are very generous, always enough leftover for lunch the next day! Service is always extraordinary!"}
{"text":"I love Pita Jungle. Everything I've ever ordered at Pita Jungle has been delicious. This particular Pita Jungle has a really nice modern interior. They have great happy hour specials too. Order a few small side dishes and get a glass of wine.   Even my 4 year old likes the food here and she's one of the pickiest eaters ever."}
{"text":"Amazing food!   We ate here after a wedding and we were starving.  The food hit the spot.  This was real authentic shawarma and falafels. I have been to the Middle East several times and this food was just as good.  I took one star off for noise from the kitchen"}
{"text":"Good service - it's fast & easy.  Alcohol is served only if your'e dining inside.  But it's nice that they have an outdoor seating option.  I was pleasantly surprised w/ the quality of food.  It was actually pretty good and reasonably cheap."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place, and I think the food at this location is better than the other.  The food is amazing!!!  I've pretty much had everything on the menu and have never been disappointed.  I love going there for tapas.  From 3:00-5:30 it's happy hour, each plate is like $1-$3....so awesome!  The Sangria is wonderful and only $3!  The coconut curry soup is the best, and if you are looking for a great salad....the Mediterranean chicken salad can't be beat!  The babaganoush is perfect and the pizzas are super yummy!  I prefer the wraps to the pitas however."}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about this place. The food is only alright. I have never been completely sold on any meals I have ordered there. The portions are so big that it is no wonder Americans are fat. My favorite part of their menu is their organic beer selection. I love Eel River Brewing Company's Amber Ale and Extra Pale Ale. The restaurant is set up in a crammed fashion. The location in Downtown Phoenix was more inviting and comfortable. With that said, the worst part of this place is how unprofessional the staff is. Their manager either has no restaurant experience or is a slob, because the employees are allowed to wear regular street attire. The dress code makes it very difficult to distinguish between who works there and who is just a young customer. HINT: the employees look like they got done working a shift at Zumiez before they showed for work at Pita Jungle. Once you figure out  who does and doesn't work there, it is easy to realize that the place is always over staffed (once again, does the manager have no restaurant experience?). In all, I will continue going to Pita Jungle in search of complete satisfaction. And if that does not happen, at least I will have a good beer to drink."}
{"text":"Honestly, Pita Jungle is one of my favorite places to eat, but tonight the service just sucked. I waited for 15 minutes & not a single server came up to me at all to take my order. I was just about to leave when a server finally came up to me to take my order (honestly I think she only came up to me bc I probably looked ticked off). The food was good as always but the service was just bad."}
{"text":"2 times in 2 days. Must be good food. Once for lunch. Once for dinner. Gyros were terrific. Salads are enormous.   Going to come back."}
{"text":"Never, ever order the Lebanese meatloaf. Took three bites and asked for the check. Hot meatloaf that was not in a loaf, on top of cold salad. Nope to Baked Kibbeh. Out of pocket $18 and staving.  My server acknowledged it wasn't his favorite dish after he asked me if I liked it and brought me my check.    All fairness, two stars for the dish. I'll just stick with my usual."}
{"text":"What more could you possibly expect from a place in a mall food court? This place is great.  Very tasty and much much healthier than anything else you will find in the food court.  I am particularly fond of the hummus, anything with their grilled chicken, and the cheese steak.  Smaller menu but just as tasty as the other locations but with more of a mall type environment."}
{"text":"I feel this is still a 2.5/3 star place and it really based on their food.  The food is good most of the time but the service, the service is really bad each and every time I go there!"}
{"text":"The food at Pita Jungle is really good but the service at the 2 locations I have been at is always the same, horrible!  I came into this location to have dinner with 3 other people and walked in and asked for a table and the hostess sat 4 people who came in after me before me.  When she walked back she said, \"Oh, I forgot that you needed a table for 4 as well.  Something will clear up soon.\"  Then our waitress was a little less than thrilled to be helping us.  The food took forever to get to our table and we were never asked if we wanted more drinks, we had to ask another waiter for help.  I am all for supporting local establishments but Pita Jungle is hard to support when they seem so uninterested in their customers."}
{"text":"Okay, a few months ago when I came to this location, I went to the bar & waited & waited and was completely ignored till I ask for a manager. She gave me her card for the next time I come. Well I wasn't looking for a freebie so I ignored it Today I went after all this time, I sat alone at a two seater table, waitress was very sweet.  That wasn't my issue... a gal came around w/ her broom& dust pan cleaning the floors, could she have waited till I was done eating before she pulled the chair in front of me to clean! And my feel weren't dirty to be dust off, which I don't think she was aware of it. No smile or excuse me! Pissed me off!!!! Can you wait till I'm done next time!!!"}
{"text":"Loved every bite! And the staff was very friendly. Food came out quickly and tasted amazing! I will surely become a regular."}
{"text":"I had lunch at Pita Jungle with my mom yesterday. We were looking for something close, good and healthy and Pita Jungle met our criteria. I live around the corner and eat there often. I would not say this is the most authentic food on the planet, but the food is always fresh, affordable and AMPLE! My mom and I could have (and should have) split a pita and left there completely satisfied. She got the gyro and I had a chicken shwarma pita. Both were pretty good (although I prefer to go a mile down the road to Eden's Grill for the real deal, which I did later that night). The atmosphere at Pita Jungle is great. It's very open and the decor is contemporary, music is decent. The patrons seem to be healthy and happy, which adds positively to the ambiance. The service can be hit-or-miss, but overall everyone is friendly, just at times can be a bit slow.  I recently went there for Happy Hour, which I liked and hated all at the same time. I enjoyed being able to sample several small plates, expanding my experience with the menu, but the portions were minute, which was really surprising/disappointing since everything I've ever had there is ridiculously over-sized.  While it was fun to taste some new things, it was a bad value and I likely won't return for another Happy Hour.  Overall, it's convenient, has a nice atmosphere and is fresh and healthy. I think it's well above average, but again, when I have a craving for real middle eastern fare, I would just assume running a bit further down the road for some more authentic food."}
{"text":"Pita Jungle is for when you want a simple change of pace. I'm not a big fan of their food but I do like the chicken & humus or lavosh pizza. My wife likes the Mediterranean Roasted Chicken pita. Its good for a couples night out."}
{"text":"Just moved to Scottsdale a few months ago and i am hooked on this place! Great food and the ambiance is nice and relaxed. I love that you can go in right before closing and still get same service. My favorite so far is the chipotle chicken pita pizza and the cillantro hummus."}
{"text":"This Pita Jungle is my absolute favorite location out of all of them in the valley!!!!  My favorite meal is no longer on the menu, but this particular PJ will make it for me, without being rude, mean or nasty, every single time!! I can't say the same for other locations.  On this particular visit the gal at the register was obviously pretty new.  I placed my order knowing my desired dish was not a menu item. I requested that she consult the chef (Rosie?) to make certain he could/would make this for me. He came out to verify the dish I wanted then told me, \"no problem\".  As I waited for my order, this amazing Chef even sent a sample to my table to confirm it's what I wanted and that it was prepared as requested (extra spicy).   The manager, Mark, was accommodating as well.  I am beyond impressed with the outstanding customer service and my FANTASTIC tasting meal.  I forgot to mention I drove from Surprise to Norterra for this deliciousness!!!!! No regrets. None.   Chances are high I'll be back next week too!"}
{"text":"The food was not fresh AT ALL! I couldn't even eat it, the workers were very nice and friendly but I was so disappointed, I've heard great things about Pita Jungle, this was my first time. I ordered a Mediterranean wrap and it was nasty. Not eatable."}
{"text":"my wife and i ate at the chandler locale once because of all the great reviews are love for the food was not there and the cocky wait person wanna be hippy child also left us wondering what was so fab about this place......now i know this review is about the sd location in the mall and it happens to be convient to hit now and then but every time i finish eating a meal ther i wonder why ......I have tried salads, hummus which is flavorless, gyros ....the chicken they serve is xtreamly dry as well"}
{"text":"Service was great. I never eat veggies but I was forced to here. I'm trying to eat more greens so this is a good thing. I got the philly peta. It was really high quality and I actually didn't mind the peppers and onions."}
{"text":"Pita Jungle is the bomb!! The Cilantro Jalepeno Hummus is awesome. It has great flavor and not to much heat."}
{"text":"So easy to give 5 stars. The food is awesome. Not going to go into tons of details.  Try it, you will be delighted....the specials are always something new and great as well!"}
{"text":"Depends greatly on the location the one in ahwatukee is going downhill. Probably won't visit that one anytime soon because every time I go order the same thing and the portions get smaller and smaller. This last time we went with eight people and not really anybody was that impressed with the food portions."}
{"text":"Usually good food but I don't know what this is lol Supposed to be lentil soup but never in my life have I seen it this color or taste like this (I'm from a Mediterranean home)"}
{"text":"I really like this Pita Jungle. It's my go-to spot for Gyros. Mmm! They're very good here -- the best I've had on the east side of the Valley. The Gyros are a decent size, and they put the best pickles on them too (not sure how authentic pickles on a Gyro are, but they're really good so just go with it). The Tzatziki is very good too. Just an all-around mouthwatering, flavor-complimenting Gyro experience.  Also worth noting is that this particular location sits next to a \"lake,\" so the outside seating makes for a very pleasant alfresco dining experience -- when it's not blazing hot, that is. There's also a lot of tasty vegetarian options here too, so you can safely bring along your vege-pals and know you're all going to find something that suits you."}
{"text":"Went here with my sis the other night, and I was thoroughly impressed. We ordered a bunch of appetizers--names I can't pronounce--but they were all good! There was a shrimp dish w/ tomatoes that was my favorite. And I also really liked this yogurt dish with cucumbers, came with pita bread too. It was all very tasty. The wine was delicious too. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We stopped for a quick takeaway and Wow was it quick. Less than 5 minutes and it was fantastic as always  This time it was a Philly Steak pita. My all time favorite never fails to deliver."}
{"text":"Chicken was dry, pita bread was seriously the hardest bread I've ever tried. My kids food was more appetizing.  Her chicken was moist, tasty. Overall not nearly as great as I remember,  when we lived here."}
{"text":"Pita Jungle is now one of my favorite places to go for dinner. It's both affordable and healthy. Thought it's usually  crowded with \"Hipster\" ASU students, I have yet to receive bad service. Our food has usually come out in a timely matter.  As for the environment, It's very nicely decorated with art from local artists and it's very well lit.  It's nice and open so you can see what's going on through out the restaurant. It's never to noisy, so it would be a great place to take a family or even a date.  Almost every visit, I've always gotten either the Broiled Chicken Salad or the Lavosh Shawarma Wrap. The chicken has always been moist and dish is always flavorful. The lemon vinaigrette dressing is almost good enough to drink!  Though I have not tried a lot on the menu, some of the food they bring out always make me say \"Ooh, what's that?!\""}
{"text":"Pita Jungle is a great place to go for great food for any lunch meeting or dinner. I have never had a bad meal once. I have been here several times now and every entree is always prepared fresh and creative. You cannot go wrong with any of these... starter hummus plate, yellowfin tuna honey sesame salad, hummus with seared ahi tuna, shawarma roasted chicken wrap or wood-fired fresh salmon.   Staff is always friendly as well. Our waiter today was extremely helpful. Only issue is the interior needs some work. The table we sat at today was very wobbly and sticky, it didn't seem like it was cleaned before we sat down. There is also some ductwork and diffusers that need to be cleaned, they are extremely dusty and dirty located above where the drinks sit (gross!). Looking up at those almost made me nauseous and not wanting to eat the food. Some improvements would most likely increase my rating to four stars."}
{"text":"You can always expect a great filling meal from Pita Jungle. The staff is usually friendly and quick to respond (sometimes), which is always a good quality to have.  There are a handful of items on the menu that I love. To start it off, the Seared Ahi Tuna with Hummus is extremely tasty and a nice starter for the table. This comes with 2 pitas, that are always warm they are served. If you're not feeling the Ahi, try the chicken over hummus!!! Very good! Best hummus in town!  As for salads, I have had quite a few. Here's a quick list for some I recommend.  -Mediterranean Chicken Salad -Caribbean Salad -Wood Fired Salmon Salad  As for the entree's, I love the Lavosh Shawarma Wrap but all of the wraps always look delicious! I have had a traditional gyro and I am not too impressed.  This is a good start for this menu, because there are a ton of dishes I want to try, including the pizza!  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I was hesitant to go here as I had bad service last time. However my daughter had a performance and begged for Pita Jungle. As we stand and look around to see who we need to be searching for to be seated. The manager who is right in front of us- who I at first thought was a patron joking with the kitchen staff. She finally blesses us with her presence but after we interrupted her from joking with her staff- Twice I have come to this place and had issues both times it's the same tall waiter with a beard. As They seat us right next to the kitchen and see all my food come out and my waiter wonders to the bar area and never checks on us for drink refills and then gets my order right, but does correct it. Good food, bad service."}
{"text":"My first time at pita jungle I would say it was very light and delicious! Vegetarian chili is a must try!!"}
{"text":"My family and I love this place, usually go the Nortera location, but the food was just ok, service slow and inattentive and the worst is there were flies everywhere. We tried to tell the server, she could have cared less. Won't be going back to this specific location again."}
{"text":"Love pita jungle!!! Favorites are the chipotle chicken lavosh pizza and fried cauliflower. Try them both, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch on a sunday. And... we were served water in the first five minutes of sitting down! Whoa, timely service! AND our food came really fast! That's an excellent change from the Tempe location. The view of the pond... er, lake is pretty nice, too.   Who cares if the staff is a bunch of hippies... if you're that tightly laced, your kids probably need a little variety added to their life anyway. Geez."}
{"text":"So the service is better, but still with the weird aloof attitude. At least they refill the waters more often. My main reason for writing a new review is to mention that they have this amazing yellowfin burger on the menu now that comes with a delicious red pepper aioli. Man, I'm a sucker for a good aioli. The first time I had the burger (it's actually a yellowfin steak, not a ground-up patty) it was a little overdone, but then I had it... uh... a few more times..... and it was nice and pink throughout. Perfecto."}
{"text":"great lunch place .... quick to get in and out and the food is comparable to the great gyros I had on the east coast.   It's a staple out here so I will likely be eating there often."}
{"text":"We love the Pita Jungle on Ray & Dobson in Mesa, so when were in the neighbor we stopped at the E Ray Rd Pita Jungle.   The site needs some very serious management attention.  We arrived for a very late lunch and while they were not busy, they had a long wait list.  There were several tables for two available and I asked if we could be seated at one of them and the young man seating people said I would need to wait until he seated some of the larger groups.  We waited about 15 minutes (Not horrible) and then he seated us at the table I originally asked for.   We waited over 15 minutes for the waitress to take our order and then another 35 minutes for our salad and black bean burger both with iced tea to come.   The gentleman at the table next to us vocally said he would need to get up and hunt down the waitress to get their check.  After our food arrived (It was well prepared and tasted good) a different table got up and started to leave.  They were stopped by an employee and they told them they waited over 15 minutes for someone to come and take their order and that they were going to the Mellow Mushroom and had received bad service here before and we never be back to try it again.   After they left the waiter for the table came and asked the employee what happened and he said \"They waited  3 or 4 minutes and left\"  Total LIE!  We love Pita Jungle but will never try this location again."}
{"text":"The food here is always pretty good. There hummus is some of my favorite and their gyro and philly steak wrap are also amazing. One tip I have though, the Tikka Masala needs some acid (lime juice or something) to get the flavor right. Service has always been very good as well. They should try to get some better beers on tap though because none of the stuff there is too appealing."}
{"text":"I've always been a fan of Pita Jungle and it's been great at the locations I've been to.  I like their pizzas and the black bean veggie burger is my \"usual.\"  Recently I decided to do something different and had the curry chicken salad.  Wow.  It was so big and I think it had more toppings than lettuce!  Usually salads don't have enough topping.  There were so many different things in the salad and the curry flavor was different on a salad.  I don't think it would've worked without the grapes and raisins.  I might have to try something new again.  I liked this location."}
{"text":"Easy to find because it is a stand alone location. I found the seating to be open and great for a large group at this location. As always the food was delicious and the food came quickly. The service is also wonderful. We were quickly seated and our orders were placed. I will definetely be returning"}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of Pita Jungle, but this was my first time at this new location. This is an excellent spot for the health-conscious \"foodie.\" It's Mediterranean focused so, if you are expecting more New American dishes, this is not the spot. Pita Jungle in my opinion is known for the hummus, so make sure you get to try all three flavors.(A great platter to try all three is the \"Hummus Trio with Chicken)\" Recently, I got the \"Mahi Mahi with Pita Chips,\" you can check the dish presentation in my photo section. It's a grilled piece of Mahi on cilantro-jalapeno hummus, and it's garnished with pita chips, pico-de-gallo, and sprouts.  The service is also excellent, from the hostess to the waiter who took our order."}
{"text":"I'm in love with Pita Jungle. Delicious food that is fresh and (can be) healthy. Cool vibe inside...and outside. Most of the servers are friendly too (except that one guy). Good beers on tap. Tasty gyro wraps, chicken & hummus, salads, and pretty much anything on the menu."}
{"text":"This could possibly be my worst visit to this location. I'm actually sitting at the bar as I started to write this. I thought it would be good to wait a couple of days before I finish this. But screw it, there's no excuse for this level of service. The bartender that was working was far more interested in the 20 minute conversation she was having with the bartender that was getting off shift. So aside from taking my order and pouring a beer, I didn't get so much as a glance from this girl. Once her co-worker went home, the level of service did improve to a point. But at the end of the day, this location leaves a lot to be desired."}
{"text":"Been to this pita jungle a few times and can never seem to get consistent quality with the food. Our waiter rarely filled our cups with water and didn't interact with us much.  I got the gyro pita. The gyro was extremely dry and almost crunchy from being over cooked. This place needs to step of their quality of food."}
{"text":"Stopped in with my lady, and never had before been to this location. Establishment was clean, the staff was friendly and professional, and the food, as expected, was delicious. My lady had the wood fire chicken with mashed potatoes and loved it. I had some hummus and caramelized cauliflower. Thanks for the food and service folks. We'll be coming back."}
{"text":"I tried this place today for the first time through Yelp since I was craving hummus. I typed in hummus and first result was Pita Jungle. I tend to like Greek food so I ventured over and enjoyed a very pleasant lunch.  The atmosphere is super causal but stil a restaurant with a hostess and server. The prices don't reflect the atmosphere, it easily could $3-$4 more expensive.   Food is great. I ordered the beef and lamb gyro with mixed greens, onions, and that tzatziki sauce...ahh nom nom. The hummus like others have said is the best I have had.   Love that  I found a new lunch/dinner place. Thanks Yelp!"}
{"text":"Best salads in Phoenix and the waitresses are hot. Need I say more?"}
{"text":"Keep your eyes open when eating Pitas from Pita Jungle.  Just received an order through Door Dash and the two Pitas that I received with my Hummus order were moldy.  It really kills your appetite when this is the first thing you see and you're about to dig into a meal.  I also typically love their Mahi dish, but this serving was dry and over cooked.  What a disappointment."}
{"text":"I have eaten here a few times, and as the prices rise, the portions shrink.  My \"go to\" meals are Turkey Pesto Wrap and Chicken Curry Salad.    They are inconsistently served, and portions vary.  Last night, June 30, 2018,  the Turkey Pesto Wrap had shrunk down, (in the incredible shrinking machine), to nothing!  (But for a 10.99 price)    We were at happy hour, at 9:00 p.m. and ordered some Tapas.  Then you have the nerve to serve the end of a tomato, (1 slice) with a microscopic piece of mozzarella for $3.00???    The only happy hour item, that looked good was humus trio for $2.00...I spent $28.00 and was still hungry.    The waitress was not present, no napkin or silverware, she never checked on us.  I should have shafted her tip, but I didn't.  The only one that bailed us out was the bus boy.   In addition, this place is in need of deferred maintenance.  It is dirty looking, black goes up wall for 12 inches, probably from a dirty mop.  It needs new paint and a thorough cleaning of the floors and walls that are black and sticky.  The booths are uncomfortable. And very shabby... I  REALLY want  my $28 refunded, BECAUSE that was not a good food experience.  You need to be on your game every time I dine with you.    If I don't get my money back, I will not return.  I will be following up with your manager."}
{"text":"I have been eating here for years, I enjoy the wraps and salads.  However, prices are rising on meals, while the consistency of the presentation varies and it is starting to bother me.  One day the Curry Salad  is generous, for 12.29, but the next time it could fit into a small salad bowl.  Wraps are inconsistently served, also.  My daughter's wrap was devoid of ingredients.  My last visit was Friday,  June 29th, 2018.  I was very disappointed in the portion size  of the salad and tiny chicken portion with it.  Also, there was very little lettuce on it.     I used to take some of the salad meal home, but last night, I ate it all.  Everyone at the table finished their meal.  I cannot continue to pay exorbitant prices, for inconsistent, shrinking, tiny portions. I cannot believe our tab was $48,  I don't know about you but my income has not increased enough to continue to pay those prices, while your portions shrink.  We are almost unable to continue being your customers.  I want something for my hard earned money."}
{"text":"Love love this place, always friendly.. i usually call in a get order to go, i never wait as they always have it there and waiting. People working are always smiling and friendly.  i usually get the same thing and have found very minor inconsistencies.    Thank you at Pita Jungle Chandler"}
{"text":"My wife and I own Hawaiian Experience Spa in the same center as this Pita Jungle and have found this to be a life saver. We try to eat healthy even when working long hours and Pita Jungle is where we go. Today we had lunch and dinner there! The service is great and everything we have had has been excellent. Today we had the Chipolte Chicken Lavosh Pizza. For $9.49 it was enough for us both.  We also order from Pita Jungle at the spa for our date night treatments which include dinner. We try to get only the best for our clients and Pita Jungle is our #1 choice."}
{"text":"I always come here when I don't feel like cooking and I want something healthy for my 2 year old. The past few times I've come I've gotten the black bean or salmon burger. The cilantro jalapeno hummus is amazing. I love this place!"}
{"text":"I was surprised to hear that the Peta meat is 80% beef and 20% lamb. either way it tastes really good but the question remains how is that made?  kind of reminds me of a hotdog and how that's made... either way it's good!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed a delicious lunch today and had the best wait server.  PHILLIP, went out of his way to be accommodating and was so pleasant.  The restaurant was very busy, however, Phillip was attentive and gave exceptional service.I needed a doggie bag since the portions are huge.  I was running errands after lunch , so Phillip included a bag of ice to keep the food cool. Thank you Phillip.  When i got home, the food was still cold."}
{"text":"Phillip was so friendly and courteous .  He went out if his way to be helpful.  The portions are huge and requires a doggie bag.  Phillip, made a special effort  to keep  the leftovers cool with ice and he double wrapped the food to keep it dry.   Thank you Phillip for exceptional service.  I accidentally posted this review for the wrong location and meant review for ARROWHEAD location.  The staff here are so honest, they alerted corporate to mistake.  Kudos to you for alerting corporate."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch. Ordered hummus, Co worker got a chicken shawarma. Her shawarma took over half an hour to receive and we watched as 13 people who placed orders after us got their food. They did not do phone orders, this was a joke for service. Will not be coming back as it's actually a loss of money on our part to have to wait so long for what is basically a chicken wrap."}
{"text":"Just picked up a take out order from this location and wasn't terribly impressed at the quality of the take out items. I love the Mediterranean chicken salad and find it a very good value for the price because of its size I always have enough to eat it twice. I sat down at my desk and opened it and realized there was hardly any lettuce. Just mostly toppings. My coworker got a small hummus and asked to sub cucumber for the pita and the cucumber order was also quite sparse. Weird because the portions have historically been great but today, not so much."}
{"text":"Stopped in as the reviews where great and have to say they where spot on. The food was outstanding and the service was awesome. My soft drink never got below a half full before the waiter refilled it. The place was packed and obviously the staff was extremely busy so I was surprised even with as busy as they are their service is outstanding. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"We were at Pita Jungle last month during a terrific weekend in Scottsdale/Phoenix.  We chose Pita Jungle due to the great Yelp reviews, and were not disappointed.  The food was good, the servers were quick to check in (although the food wasn't quite as quick), and everything was super tasty.  The one weird thing was that orders were getting confused left and right, so that our meal was first offered to the table next to us -- even though they already had their food.  It was kind of ridiculous, but probably not the servers' fault!"}
{"text":"I did not know i would be so impressed! They did a remodel and WOW!!! Everything got amazingly better.  A salad or wrap that you let them know what you want in it. Everyday it can change or stay the same. Their pricing is simple and portions and large. They also always serve you with a smile.  Pita Jungle has exactly what  you want because it's your way, clean and beautiful presentation!! Thank you Pita Jungle, I will defiantly be back again and again!"}
{"text":"Just like having a water front meal on the coast of Mediterranean, except there is an apartment complex across water way.  This location is the most scenic of the chain with a water front patio. The menu is the same as the other locations. The really inconsistency of the items on the menu. One of my frequent items is the veggie wrap, Some days it is vibrant with canalized onions and a strong taste of garlic, other days I need to use a pint of siracha to give it flavor.   Alternatively for a lighter, cheaper meal I opt for the falafel pita, the falafel itself is one of the better ones in Arizona but still far from the best I ever had in Haifa, The pita is chewy and fresh and there is ample tahini and salad to fill the pita.   I recommend this place for a lunch, or dinner on the patio. Occasionally on weekends there is live music inside which can make conversation a bit difficult.   Parking in this strip mall can be a bit tight too."}
{"text":"What a bummer.   Have been going to this Pita Jungle on occasion for quite some time, but it seems it's going through a rough stretch or something (new management?).  Ordered take-out (just a couple different hummus+chicken, a chicken/pasta salad, some pita, and an order of baklava for dessert).   Told it would be about 20 minutes...  oops...  Long story short, just under an hour later, we got our order (quite troubling for a place that does - or at least used to do - such a brisk takeout business).  I suppose the exasperation of waiting so long and watching people torch the poor server manning the bar/takeout station was distracting, and we forgot to check our bag.   Well, turns out the order was light one dessert... no baklava - double bummer.  To add insult to injury, the hummus was badly over-seasoned... It was edible, but ya know, Pita Jungle is one of those places that kinda tastes/feels healthy (in a good way), so it's real downer when you feel like you're eating bar food at an Applebee's from all the salt.  With the exception of the vastly over-matched server desperately trying to wish some speed into the kitchen, this was a total disappointment - but one extra star for effort there.  55+ minutes for our takeout order (w/ nothing outside of grilled chicken that actually had to be cooked).  Others waited longer!  There were people straight-up yelling at the poor server.  Yet there was no sign of a manager coming out to at least acknowledge the problem or make the slightest attempt at making things right.  Not much help from other servers either (on a not-too-busy night) - though, I'm not sure what all they could've done other than serve as canon fodder.  We'll definitely be taking a break from this particular Pita Jungle for a while."}
{"text":"I don't need to say anything other than Grilled Veggie Lavosh Wrap. Jaw... drop... floor. And the spicy garlic potatoes... can I please steal your recipe so I can make those every day of the week?   I'm always amazed by PJ. This location has \"the lake\" which has an amazing view and PJ has wonderfully outfitted their patio so you can sit outside for all of the seasons. They have several heaters outside, plants, flowers- Just beautiful. The inside has dark wood tables, a giant ornate mirror in the back and pictures/paintings on all of the walls.   They had me by the first sentence but I also absolutely love their falafel platter, thousand bean pita- (DE-Lisious open faced pita), and of course the hummus. Their happy hour is seriously ridiculous!  Hummus for a $1?!  I know, I'm getting carried away here but it's true! Their food is fresh, bursting with flavor and priced for what you get. I never eat my whole meal and always take half of it home with me. And they even give you a to-go cup for your drinks (non-alcoholic that is).   This is a place I can go eat, not feel guilty, stuff myself and have a good time with friends and family."}
{"text":"I've been eating at this place for years now. Today was the first time I got food poisoning from a salad. I've never had a problem eating here until now. I just hope the cooks really aren't being careless now."}
{"text":"I was a little upset when I first heard they were moving to mill because the Apache and Dorsey location is literally 2 minutes from my apartment, but after seeing the new location, I decided an extra 3 minute car ride is worth it. The place is huge and the decor is really cool and modern. They still have a lot of the same staff working, which I like because they're all really friendly and a lot of them know my order. Me and my roommates have been here twice since they opened..yesterday. That's how much we love it there. I'm really excited to see how great this location will be! My only \"complaint\" is that I wish they were open late so I could get my del sol pita crisp and extra crispy garlic potatoes after a night on mill!!"}
{"text":"Rarely do I give a 5 after just one visit, but my visit to Pita Jungle yesterday deserves it.  I was in a hurry, so needed food to-go.  This is often a dicey predicament.  I walked by on at 1:30pm on a sunny 72 degree day mid-week & the outdoor seating was almost full and the inside tables were packed with servers sprinting around every corner.  I walked to the back, asked for a menu, selected the special - Seared Yellow Fin Ahi burger on 12-grain bread with spicy aioli served with a side of garlic new potatoes for only $7.99!  I sat down, sent a text, Tweeted once - took a sip of my diet pepsi and was surprised to have my food delivered to me.  It was 4 minutes!  Holy cow!  The tuna was perfectly seared and deep pink in the middle and the aioli was tasty but not too spicy.  The bun was fresh and the potatoes were garlicy - but not too strong to prevent me from speaking to dozens of students at ASU a couple hours later.  On my next visit to Phoenix in March, I will return!"}
{"text":"Food is good, though portions are being reduced often. Tried to bring this to the attention of the manager and she had such a bad unprofessional attitude. Though a chain, each restaurant is independently owned. Better to go to the one on Shea or Desert ridge."}
{"text":"Cant go wrong with Pita Jungle!! Love the vegetarian options every time! I had the Veggie Penne salad, add a little hot sauce and it was wonderful. Daughter had a salad that had hummus around the edges and it was great too!! Been to many Pita Jungle locations over the years and its always the same great food and service."}
{"text":"I've been to several Pita Jungle's in the Valley. This one breaks the mold, I felt like I was in a 5 star restaurant. The decor, and the food presentation was 10 fold any other P.J.  My spanikapita was presented beautifully!! Turkey Burger, perfect. Even my daughter ALWAYS has the chipotle chicken lavosh pizza, and it tasted better than any other.......Why is this one so different?  Our server had the personality of a wet mop though, he was one piece of this puzzle I didn't get."}
{"text":"The service and the food are outstanding! Highly recommend! Can't wait to taste one of everything! Happy hour is fun with tapas...reverse happy hour."}
{"text":"I am a fan....  I have always been a Pita Jungle fan for the great food and excellent service. I  am a frequent diner at the downtown location during lunch and happy hour. I was sooooooo excited to have one go up in my neighborhood. This location is trendy with an upbeat atmosphere. What I admire most about this location is the location has plenty of parking since it is in a grocery shopping store location.   What I like about Pita Jungle is the food is cooked to order and fresh. You get plenty of food for the price and they cater to all types of taste buds. Clean, healthy food for a great price.   My first experience at this location was take-out. I placed the order in house and waited. The wait staff immediately greeted me and got my order in. They move fast as it seems the moment I sat down my food was ready to go. Sadly one of my entrees was wrong. However, I won't allow that to stop me from coming. It was an honest mistake. The waitress put the order in properly though it was a simple mistake on the cooks end. I called the location and the person who answered the phone apologized and said they would make it up to me the next time I came in. That has been my only problem I have ever had at this location matter of fact at any Pita Jungle. I have always been happy with the service and quality taste of their food which is why I will always return.  Thank you Pita for a job well done on hiring great people and cooking tasty food."}
{"text":"I LOVE PITA JUNGLE! Why aren't they in Chicago?! Damn this unhealthy meat-lovin city! Let's try something different...  Anything I've had here was remarkable, and I've tried a couple of different Phoenix-based locations, so they're doing something right. Try the jalape√±o hummus for a great spin to a Greek dish, and if you're really hungry, I highly recommend any of their lavosh pizzas. My favorite though? The Chipotle Chicken Lavosh Pizza, of course! It is delicious and mouth-watering.  I deduct 1 star solely for the fact that their parking lot is VERY inconvenient and way too crowded."}
{"text":"Another place we really wanted to like. Service was ok, nothing special. The food was meh, really lacked in flavor. The most annoying part of our meal here was the flies. They had the patio door open and we were seated by the front door. The entire meal was spent swatting flies. We think there are much better Greek places with much better service and food then Pita Jungle."}
{"text":"A group of us stopped in after a Yelp event because it was a short walk from the Womack. I had some of the baba ganoush, a spicy beef pita and sauteed red potatoes. The baba ganoush was okay. The spicy beef pita was kinda of like a burrito... it's not really on the menu. The item on the menu was the spicy chicken pita so I asked them to substitute it for beef and they complied. My friend ordered a side of the red potatoes and that was tasty and well seasoned.   Pita Jungle was a Mediterranean fast food ... so for what it is. It's great!"}
{"text":"I was super impressed by this place, which was strongly recommended by the Accountant at my company's corporate office. It has a huge menu and is right in the middle of the college area of Tempe.   The place is trendy, busy, and noisy. It was filled with college students and young professionals the night we were here. My coworker remarked at the fact that there is not one, but THREE different types of \"Veggie\" Hamburgers. I almost opted for the grilled portabello mushroom burger but instead decided on The Broiled Chicken Pita.  First we tried a starter, hummus and pita. The pita was soft and not burned or overcooked. The hummus was really good. The chicken pita was a little over-covered in greens, but that garlic sauce made it one of the best sandwiches I have EVER had. I can't wait to come back to Phoenix -- this will be a major stop for at least one meal every time I come back!"}
{"text":"Food is amazing. The Mediterranean chicken Shwarma is delicious. The plate runner didn't ask if we needed anything else so I had to go to the bar to ask for some Siracha sauce. I must've been talking to the owner or manager because he came over asked if there was anything else we needed and brought us some free drinks. Pita jungle is awesome!"}
{"text":"Never disappointed, always good!   always on point and delicious. One time a flatbread took a little longer than usual and when he brought it to me he said it would be taken care of. Amazing service like that will always keep my coming back. plus the food is amazing!"}
{"text":"Nice place and good food. This specific location is nice because they have a large patio that is kept cool in the summer with the help of misters and it's shaded from the hot afternoon sun.  The wait staff here is friendly and efficient as well and I've never had any problems with orders. I hear they have some great drink specials too."}
{"text":"Love this place! They have healthy food and it tastes delicious! I am hooked on their cilantro  jalape√±o hummus salad. I add grilled chicken to it and cucumber slices instead of the chips or pita. Service is always quick and friendly. We usually eat here every Friday and they are busy but always get us taken care of quickly which allows us to come here on our lunch break. I would recommend them to anyone looking for a health alternative to fast food."}
{"text":"Love this place. Staff is always friendly and service is fast.  Outside patio isn't much to look at but it's in the shade which is always nice in the heat"}
{"text":"Went on a weekday evening and the place was full but not uncomfortable. We had to wait a few minutes for a table because we wanted to sit outside but the wait was reasonable. I'm usually determined to find the least healthy item at places that otherwise would offer some very healthy choices. So I ordered a Philly Cheesesteak pita and wasn't disappointed. Get some hummus before the meal, you won't regret it. The service was very good and the prices were reasonable."}
{"text":"Been here 100 times, and probably come back 100 more.....pita jungle rules all."}
{"text":"This is our fave Mediterrenean joint.   I was craving for the Beef Gyro Sandwich loaded with tomatoes, romaine lettuce, pickles, and tsaziki sauce wrapped with warm soft pita bread. I prefer lamb gyro over beef, but they don't have the former.   My husband and I switched, since he usually orders the Gyro and I get the Mediterrenean Platter which consists of hummus, tsaziki, falafel, dolmades, tabouli, and green beans salad.  Another fave of mine is the simple Lentil Fettoosh salad with the yummy lemon vinegrette.  My son wanted the Mac and Cheese with broccolli and veggie patty.  I asked for the ingredients for the veggie patty and it just had too much stuff in there.  So, I talked my son into omitting that one.  His usual is the Caprese Salad and tsaziki with pita, but we've been having that at home lately.    They do have a great KID'S MEAL MENU.   My DH and I believe that they have the best Baklava served with Pistachio Ice Cream!!!"}
{"text":"After another local venue refused my reservation for 20 (6 days in advance, mind) I decided to give ol' PJ the party.  From my first call through my last goodbye, everything was flawless.  Rachel answered the phone and was appreciative of the call-ahead of the party of that size.  When I arrived at 640, Rachel, Destiny, and the rest of the host staff were warm, welcoming, and gave me a tour, allowing me to choose where my party was seated (we picked inside, the noise level on the patio was pretty high with the traffic on 7th st)  The service was exquisite.  Jacinda and her partner (who's name I have quite forgotten, apologies,) were more than efficient and accommodating, even when the party numbers dropped due to life happening.  The food was hot, fresh, beautifully presented and delicious, the cocktails (that rocks marg, tho...) were cold and tasty, and things literally could not have been better.    Thank you, ladies and gentlemen of 7th st Pita Jungle, you made my birthday dinner a treat."}
{"text":"Looking forward to coming @ happy hour for Tapas  the gyro was delicious but cracker crust for pizza,  not my style"}
{"text":"Great service.. great food... all around a excellent place for lunch or dinner. We have been going her for years! From shwarmas,gyros,or my favorite pasta salad everything has always been good and identical to the time before. Great consistency!!! One thing you should surely try is the fruit fantasia... it is always prepared and cut fresh and you can taste it!!"}
{"text":"The portabello burger is soooo nasty! Yuck!  The only things we get are the thousand bean pitta which is really good and the pesto pizza yummy as well.  They have fast service."}
{"text":"Disappointed in you Pita jungle.... I used to LOVE this place... then all of the sudden the portion size of the spinach pasta salad has just diminished.  They barely give you any pasta. Also, I always add chicken and lately there is barely any on it.... sorry but paying 18 dollars for what I have received the past few times isn't worth it.    They used to be on top of it and the portions were what you pay for! I don't know what happened, but I'm REALLY sad. This place was my favorite."}
{"text":"The jalape√±o hummus is very tasty. I recommend the caribbean salad for something fresh... And you can never go wrong with the lavash chicken shwarma (excuse the spelling)."}
{"text":"Wish I would have known about this place 8 months ago... What a great little spot.   Unfortunately, in sort of a dumpy mini-mall is hidden this little gem, great food, great service and very affordable.   I had the Falafel Pita and also tried some of my friends Philly Cheese Steak Pita, both were two thumbs up! Healthy, clean kept and a great atmosphere inside the restaurant... I will definitely be heading back here."}
{"text":"I have come to love me some Pita Jungle as of lately. The food is always good but the service can be a little spotty from time to time. You can't go wrong with anything that you order so look over the menu and see what tickles your fancy for that day and have at it. The portions are always huge so if you leave hungry than I don't know what to tell you."}
{"text":"Disappointing ! Black bean burger tasted good but fell apart my first bite. It seemed as if they cooked the beans and then formed into a patty. Would be much better if they threw on the grill for a minute. Waiter cleared half eaten plates away without batting an eye - he must be used to it. 3 soft drinks and 3 mediocre entrees + 15% tip = $47. Won't be back !"}
{"text":"I love this place! Even when it's busy, the staff has always been nice and service has been fast as they can get it out. I'm there at least twice a week!"}
{"text":"Found this place and fell in love. Prices are great, service is friendly and excellent. Food is amazing! My husband and I love this place for their prices and because the food is really healthy. So if your looking for healthy great tasting food, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Great food 95% of the time. The only thing I complain about is the dry chicken from time to time. Otherwise its consistent and good! Thats what I want in a restaurant! Been going here for 12 years. Love it each time. Its either the Shawrma Wrap, Lentil Fetoosh or Chicken combo with Broccoli on the side.  Service is consistent too with most of the same people there for a long time. Not a lot of turnover. Sometimes it can suck. But I still get what I want and the food is always the same, good!  Great place!"}
{"text":"Holly Cow Pita Jungle!!!  Way to move up in the world!  This place is fancy fancy for a Pita Jungle.  Food was great!  Service was great!  Decor was great!"}
{"text":"I always eat here when I want to feel healthy. You can get brown rice and quinoa until your heart's content. I'm a fan of the cilantro/jalapeno humus! I've had a quite a few food items here. They're all good, but not \"blow you away\" good. They taste healthy! So . . . . if you're needing a break from the burger/pizza/steak/pasta/mexican/etc. . . .   this is a good pick!"}
{"text":"I am a Pita Jungle fan but this location did not do it for me. Between the two locations I always dine at (Downtown and 7th street) this one was not my best first experience. Less than a week ago was my first experience at this location. Beating the lunch crowd myself and two other guest were the only ones at our long table. The bartender was our server who took a while to come by to ask what we wanted to drink. Oddly she only had one person at the bar to wait on. Placing our orders while we got our drinks our food came in a timely manner. Though the food was awful. My sizzling salad was cold, no salad dressing at all, brown pieces of lettuce and the portion size was small. Oddly one of my guest who had a greek salad had no dressing on her salad either. Trying to track the bartender down was impossible as she got busy. We asked another waitress to bring us dressing which she did right away. That's when the bartender came to check on us. I did tell her this chicken was cold. I order this chicken at least once a week either at a location or to go so I know something is wrong. Then no dressing? She apologized and offered to make another salad. She said the chef is new.  Because I don't throw food away I declined the offer and could not afford to wait any longer.  I then paid my tab and left. None of us were happy and all of us felt this was not the typical food or service for  Ptia Jungle. I am not in a rush to come back but if I do I will make sure I tell them to serve the chicken hot and please add the dressing."}
{"text":"Review from a 5 year old on the Kids Menu:  \"I like the mac and cheese!  It  had good cheese and made it nice and yummy.  It was a special mac and cheese.  I also got the turkey and fruits (strawberries).  It was yummy and fresh.  Pita Jungle is really good!\""}
{"text":"TWO HOURS. My order took TWO HOURS. By the time it was delivered, my husband had already made the kids another dinner and I had fallen asleep. When the food finally was delivered TWO HOURS later, the delivery girl chirped \"Oh, the kitchen is really back up\" as if it was no big deal. If a restaurant is THAT backed up as she claimed, they have a responsibility to call outstanding deliveries. Not to mention, somehow my ability to rate them on Seamless was disabled. I should know better than to think Phoenix is up on the delivery game, but was so excited to see more options this visit to AZ. After a day of travel we just wanted some good, healthy food delivered...but not food that took TWO EFFING HOURS."}
{"text":"I love this place!! It's got delicious food, pretty healthy overall and my whole family loves it here. They re-did the kid's menu a while ago and that really saved the day for us. My girls love choosing their protein, their \"carb\" option and their veggie. They have nothing that isn't delicious, but I'm partial to the Chicken Lavosh Shwarma wrap - ridiculously delicious!! My husband swears the basil pesto wrap (with chicken instead of turkey) is the best. I even love the broiled chicken salad. Not sure what they do the chicken (the marinade and wood stove must help), but it's fabulous!! They're pepsi servers too, so I can enjoy diet pepsi here too. There can be a wait at busy times of days, but come at off peak times if you don't want to wait. The servers are great too!"}
{"text":"I love Pita Jungle.  Mainly I visit for their hummus and ice tea.  Plus the shrimp/pita/tomato thingy is to die for!  Parking at the 44th/Indian School road location is a nightmare so just run in and pick it up!"}
{"text":"Always great service and very consistent with their food. I recommend for lunch dinner or just a Happy hour"}
{"text":"This is one of the best of their locations. The food comes out quickly and in enormous portions. I always get the macro platter and sub out chicken for the tofu - the chicken is so perfectly seasoned and super moist!   Parking is not the best, but you can usually find a spot, even after waiting a few minutes during the busy lunch hour.   Lunch seems to be the busiest time here as there are a lot of offices and businesses near by, so there is that."}
{"text":"This location is the best, very consistent. We've gone here on several occasions. Everything we try is delicious. Orders come out quickly and booths are spacious. I have two picky eaters who I had to coerce to try this place and now it's one of their favorite restaurants. Staff here has consistently provided good service but I have to say they are the most unprofessionally dressed restaurant staff we've ever seen."}
{"text":"Came here for a quick lunch/snack on Saturday and was impressed with all the menu offerings. The pita bread was much better than any pita bread I've had in the past and I really enjoyed the avocado hummus with blue corn chips (basically guacamole but creamier). The falafel was decent but a little too crispy in my opinion.   One waiter seemed a little too nonchalant when I asked if certain dishes were free of my listed allergens, which made me a little nervous. I asked a second waitress who served the dishes and she went back to the kitchen to verify which put my mind at ease."}
{"text":"I have been eating at Pita Jungle for over three years and it never gets old. Love the caribbean salad, the pizza's are amazing and the hummus and pita bread are the best! This along with the great service will make me return for years to come. A little pricey which is the only thing keeping me from the full five star review."}
{"text":"I've gone to Pita Jungle for several years and it never gets old. Their hummus is the best, and I never tired of the chicken lavosh pizza nor the carribean salad. A little pricey, but worth it!!"}
{"text":"Had the Gyro the other day.   I don't know if it's I'm not used to pickles in it, or there were too many ... but it overwhelmed the sandwich.  The rest of the ingredients were ok... but I have to say I was underwhelmed.  Nothing on the side with the Gyro.  Kind of expensive for a so-so sandwich."}
{"text":"This location (finally) lives up to the name. It was a little rough going when they first opened last year- crazy echoes. Some forward thinking creative and intelligent person (no it wasn't me) put up decorative cork boards to soak up the sound. It was all good from there.  The grape leaves, the lentil soup, the unchanging specials... it's the perfect escape from organic chemistry at MCC across the street.   The service is usually pretty great- and good people watching too. They accommodate groups well. The baklava ice cream dessert is mouthwatering. Lemonade and ice tea always please and go very well with the macrobiotic platter or just a plate of hummus with pita."}
{"text":"I ordered the cilantro jalape√±o hummus & it was un-enjoyable. My pita was falling apart, stale & on top of it all cold. It wasn't how I expect my hummus to be from there. Maybe it was a bad day for the restaurant but trying to fill a craving and it not living up to my expectations is highly upsetting."}
{"text":"Really healthy and extensive menu. Great selection and everything was delicious. Appetizer platter, kids meals, macro plate. Yum! Service was quick and helpful. Good lunch destination."}
{"text":"My Beautiful wife and I have been coming to Pita Jungle since were were both in school together in Glendale. We loved it instantly and have been coming every since.   Recently were were at this location after having not been to one in about a year. I was pleased to see that the menu was mostly intact and the food quality and quantity was exactly the same. Top Notch.   We had our old standbys the mediterranean chicken salad, with hummus style chicken, no tabouli and the lettuce chopped fine. Amazingly fresh and filing and exactly as we remembered it.   My wife had the Gambas Con Ajo which is shrimp in a tomato sauce with soft pita wedges. So good.  They did have some new teas and they were great.  Service was as aways 5/5 and the Food I was happy to see was still 5/5. Overlal 5/5."}
{"text":"You would think with a name like this they would have homemade quality pita. Not so. Do you like cardboard?  Do you like loud?  Do you like NO protein?  Then this is the place for you. Won't go back. When I asked about the Pita the manager told me that corporate can't decide on a recipe. Give me a break. Don't go."}
{"text":"I'll preface this by saying this was the first time I'd ever had Greek/Mediterranean food, aside from the odd serving of hummus, so I really have no idea what I'm talking about.  That said, the food here is delicious. I decided to dive right in and try something totally new to me, so I got a falafel pita. The first bite, I didn't really understand the flavor. The second bite, it was like \"wait.. wait.. I think I got something!\" And with the third bite, I realized it was delicious. I'm sure this has nothing to do with Pita Jungle and everything to do with me not knowing what the hell falafel is. Regardless, it was delicious, and I consumed the remainder of my pita with gusto. I have no idea if it was authentic, but I do know that it was tasty.  We also got the Mediterranean Platter, and pretty much everything in it was delicious, except the taboule was rather flavorless. It was pretty much just a big pile of greens (parsley, I believe), a few small pieces of tomato, and I guess there was some sauce or something but it didn't really taste like anything at all. And there was a lot of it. The platter was probably 1/3 taboule. So it was kind of a waste as we ending up throwing it away.  We ordered take-out so I can't say what the dine-in service is like, but just from the few minutes I spent inside the place I think I'd feel out of place there. With the dim lighting and the seats filled with the hipster crowd, it's definitely not the atmosphere I go for. However, the girl I talked to behind the counter was nice, and she offered me a glass of water while I waited for my order to come out, so I put a buck in the tip jar.   A bonus about Pita Jungle is they have online ordering, which is great for a socially awkward person like myself who abhors having to speak on the phone to people."}
{"text":"If you're not ordering the Cilantro Jalapeno Hummus dip, then you're doing wrong! Everything on the menu tastes amazing and full of fresh ingredients. My personal favorites are the California Club (turkey) or the Turkey Pesto on Lavosh. The service is excellent and they are always willing to provide recommendations. I'd suggest sitting outside on their covered patio. It provides a great view of the lake and surrounding restaurants! Be sure to join their email list and they send you a free small hummus appetizer within a few days."}
{"text":"I always start off with the cilantro-jalapeno hummus... you won't regret it! If you're ok with a few extra calories, ask for the Greek pita bread; it's a little thicker and melts in your mouth. I'd recommend the California wrap with a side salad. The portion is rather large so share with a friend or be prepared for leftovers. They have a decent beer selection and great munchies during happy hour. If you can, snag a seat outside and enjoy the great Arizona weather."}
{"text":"Dropped the ball today..   7 servers standing around while my server is clueless to our tables drinks that have been sitting there for 10 mins plus at the server well done.  Not good when you want you cold beer and a full glass of ice for the sangrias.  So I had to go up there and grab them myself.    The bartender sees me and I say looks like I have to get these myself or I won t get them..   So she says yeah you can take them..  Then she doesn't think to mention anything to our server or the manager.  Then... We don't get our appetizer at all..  We ask to speak to manager ... He is to busy to come over to talk to us because he is stuffing his face in the private dining which we can see...   On top of that all it looks like the last 10 people to eat at this table left their food underneath it which would normally make sense to clean up by the staff.....Apparently not.    Food was good though!"}
{"text":"Very dependable. Food is good. Service is usually quick. Feels healthy. Good standby/goto restaurant, especially when you want something reliable and reasonably quick but don't want fast food.   If tattoos offend you this is not the right place for you because it would appear that tats are mandatory in order to get a job here."}
{"text":"I'm craving this food right now. This location has an awesome expansive dining area - great for groups. Our server was ah-may-ZING! And probably the best baklava I have EVER had. So glad it is next to my office!"}
{"text":"Very cool laid back vibe. Everyone is very nice and personable. The Red Pepper Hummus is very tasty ( ask for an extra pita) We had a Gyro and Stir Fry with Shrimp. Both were very tasty. We will be back!"}
{"text":"My husband and I go to Pita Jungle regularly for Happy Hour.  We enjoy sitting on the patio and relaxing.  The hummus is yummy and we can get a couple HH apps and drinks for less than $20 when we leave. The service is always good and the food is consistent between locations."}
{"text":"It pains me to say this but the quality of Pita Jungle is going down little by little.  The Chicken which used to be consistently awesome is now hit or miss. I'm not sure if this is because the food is being sourced from a different place to save money or what but the fact is I have had bad, tough chicken on several occasions.  I sure hope this is not a trend but I have seen this happen to other restaurants in past.  Please keep your attention to detail your customers notice this. Update: last visit, quality much improved!!!"}
{"text":"We had an unfortunate experience tonight. We have driven past a few of these restaurants. We finally decided to try it after seeing a movie. We were sat down right away by the hostess(who was very nice). We then looked over the menu and waited. Then we waited some more. I'm not sure how long we sat there but it was certainly more than enough time to take a drink order. After seeing others being tended to that had sat down after we did, I told the hostess we haven't been helped. By that time we had decided to just leave. As we were leaving the owner or manager tried stopping us and said that it was on him. Unfortunately by that time we had lost interest in dining there for the night. I hate leaving negative reviews, but I work in the service Industry and first impressions are quite important to me. We may or may not attempt another time."}
{"text":"I LOVE love pita jungle at Val Vista and baseline... Get the same salad each and every time curry chicken salad! Amazing best is the brown rice!!! This is the worst salad they have EVER made!!! There is about a WHOLE pound of carrots I assume to make up for the fact there is NO brown rice at All!!!! I am sooo disappointed that I spend my whole lunch hour driving and waiting for a salad I won't even touch! Will never go back to this location again!"}
{"text":"My first time trying pita jungle. I usually see them at the mall and didn't like their menu there so I'm glad I came into the restaurant to try their food. The menu is a lot bigger! My friend and I tried their hummus with meat and then split their California sandwich which was PLENTY of food for two people. I saw a lot of different things I would love to try!! Can't wait to come back. The waitress we had was very nice also. So thanks again!"}
{"text":"The second Pita Jungle location I've tried and once again loved it! I started off with the avocado hummus and tabouli salad. My friend is Lebanese and well she makes the best tabouli salad but this was close! Just don't know how I felt about the big chunks of tomato in it. It was more like a fatoush salad without the sumac. It still revived 5 stars because it was still good and perfect for the summer time. I also ordered the California wrap for my second time and it was just as good as the first time I tried it! Thanks a lot and I will be coming in to try out more things from the menu!"}
{"text":"Perfect every time!! Have several favorites from the menu...hummus platter with seasoned chicken and thousand beans with side of broiled chicken are both green options for healthy eating! And the green iced tea is the best in the valley! Youthful servers always friendly and super with special requests...this FLW location has great patio seating with toasty heaters for chilly nights! Definite local treasure!"}
{"text":"I'm revising my previous review.  I was upset at how long the hold times were to order over the phone.  I felt like it was handled very well and every effort to correct the situation was taken.  I'm very happy about this because the food here is really tasty and I look forward to going back and having a better experience."}
{"text":"I have dined at pita jungle several times and it is always great food and service. I went in on Monday and was greeted as soon as I got there. I was by myself so I sat at the bar. My super cute server, Ashley, was awesome. I ordered one of my usuals, the pesto lavosh wrap, but she recommended I order it with their lemon pepper chicken breast instead... MIND BLOWN. Throw some siracha on that baby and I could eat that every day for the rest of my life. I also love that it comes with a side of their awesome greek salad and the wrap is plenty for 2 meals! Their food always seems so fresh and satisfying. I have never had a bad meal or service at any of their locations."}
{"text":"I enjoy eating at various Pita Jungle locations but tonight was exceptional. My server, Jeff, realized (after running my card) that he had given me the wrong bill. I didn't even notice! He came back to tell me he noticed the mistake before making the final charge to my credit card so my card was never run. He brought the correct bill which was $20 less expensive. I gave him more than 20% as a tip for being so honest. My server was Jeff and my table was 43/2. I was there on 7/23 around 7pm. Jeff gets all the kudos for this one and, in the future, I will read my bill more carefully! :)"}
{"text":"I like pita jungle just like anyone else, but I think it is given too much cred.  The Fake Mediterranean stuff like the lavosh pizza are good, but I can't really say that anything else is anything but adequate.  Falafel is ok there.  The most bangin thing is the red pepper hummus, but I would just buy it to go, cause to me, the pitas taste like they bought them at fry's.  Salads are huge here, if you're into those for a meal.  Other than that it's just doing what it's supposed to, nothing above and beyond.  I usually find that it's very crowded there too.  I would rather hit up Haji's."}
{"text":"Decent Hummus. Good sides and plates, especially their grilled chicken."}
{"text":"This was our first visit and we were not disappointed! The service was outstanding! Huge shout out to our server Eddie who never let our drinks get more than half empty, answered all of our questions, and following a HUGE Antipasto platter, he split our Chicken Sharma between my Bride and I. The servings were very generous and the flavors were conversation stopping. For a place known for its vegan choices, this carnivore was very very happy! We had no complaints about the price. It was an excellent evening."}
{"text":"I love you Pita Jungle. Not only do you have a separate menu for us vegans, but now you have a Tapas Happy Hour and a kids menu?! Hold the phone!  The Tapas Happy Hour is daily from 3pm-5:30pm and the plates are all $1-$3. My favorites include the hummus trio sampler and the falafel (comes with 2). Delicious!"}
{"text":"I truly enjoy every visit to Pita Jungle. I get excited knowing it'll be exceptionally good, and good for me. The hummus with grilled chicken is enough for two people. Skip the regular, boring hummus and go with half roasted bell pepper, half cilantro jalapeno for a winning combination under $10 bucks. Throw in an extra pita and you've got a full lunch or dinner packed with mouth watering flavor and tons of protein for all you diet/fitness fans.   It's been months since I've strayed from my beloved hummus, but I can't fail to mention noteworthy selections on the menu. The roasted chicken shawarma pita is your standard gyro. Tender meat and fresh veggies. *Ask for extra tzatziki sauce*  Fancy stepping out of your carnivorous comfort zone? The Chipotle Black Bean Burger will satisfy your need for spices (not heat), and double down on an intricate blend of healthy ingredients. Homemade black beans are the building blocks of the patty, tossed with onions, garlic, bell peppers, oats, cranberries, you get the picture! Served up with chipotle hummus and potatoes. My recommendation for nervous new vegetarians who can't fathom giving up the beef."}
{"text":"I get togo food from here often and the bartender is always fast and friendly. The menu has a lot of healthy and tasty options."}
{"text":"Aside from Postino's, this is probably the most frequented Gilbert spot on our favorites list!   They now have a happy hour!!!  3-6pm Monday thru Friday ($1 off beer, $2 off wine & specialty cocktails - tons of tapas choices ($1 - $3) with something for everyone.  The salmon sliders (3) are out of this world.  I love the salmon dishes at PJ so I knew this would be good. In two visits I think we've sampled about half of what they offer (shrimp in ajo sauch, olives, feta, garlic dip, tzatziki, sauteed mushrooms) and none of them disappoint.   Sad to see their red blend go away but luckily the 19 Crimes from Eastern Australia is good enough substitute for me."}
{"text":"Usually I love pita jungle.  Last night we got an order to go and I was eating some left overs today only to find a very large beetle in my ginger stir fry.  I can deal with a lot of things, but bugs is not one of them.  Now I'm worried that I won't be able to eat there anymore because I am really grossed out.  Usually a great place but right now it has left a bad taste in my mouth."}
{"text":"Went back for a late lunch today and it was amazing our server was super nice and informative food was awesome as usual!  I was going to post pics but I ate it too fast ! We had the Mediterranean salad basil pesto pizza philly cheese flatbread and my husbands favorite cilantro hummus! Great job pita jungle and we will see you again"}
{"text":"When it first opened the service was horrible.  I think we went 5 weeks straight before we got service that didn't get the order wrong.  However, since then it has been the same fabulous service and food we are accustomed to at the Chandler location."}
{"text":"Hands down the best PJ location of all, yes even the Shea and the Indian School locations. My fav item in the menu is the Falafel with a side of garlic mash dip. Happy hour is awesome because you can sample a ton of tapas including garlic shrimp, pitas and dips etc."}
{"text":"Best salmon and amazing hummus. No bad foods here! Only downside is everyone knows how great they are so sometimes a wait."}
{"text":"Meh. Not a fan. Sister and I came here after a day of shopping at Norterra. We were famished and super excited for some pita delicious-ness. The restaurant was packed, people were waiting in random spaces so it was hard to tell who had already put their name down or now. We ended up going to the bar.  Our server was super nice and knew a lot about the menu, which was good. The one thing I noticed right away, was that the servers, or employees seemed to all be half dressed. I don't have kids, but there were kids there, and it seems like this is a family enough style restaurant so that was unprofessional to me.   When our food came, I had been so excited to try the falafel pita but when I saw it, I wanted to cry and my stomach started to riot. The falafel was burned and bone dry. Made me thirsty just looking at it. and holy onions. There were so many onions, no sauce. just ick.   We didn't stay long after that. Most likely won't go back."}
{"text":"Not a bad place to grab some takeout. Decent salads at decent prices to break up the monotony of the school day."}
{"text":"Always great each time I come in I work in the restaurant industry and the kitchen always looks amazing and so is the food I love it"}
{"text":"I love to swing through Pita Jungle whenever possible!  Every time I come, I cannot resist ordering something with pita and hummus, and it is always roaring good! The salads, smoothies, and pitas that I've shared are all delish.  Also, there are so many non-meat and non-gluten choices. The servers are hip without being pretentious, no snakes in the grass here. The decor is king!  Come on, what a cool giant mirror!  Just writing this review makes want to get lost in the jungle again!"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite place to get a gyro! Good price for the size you're getting! And here I thought it was a vegetarian place lol"}
{"text":"I love Pita Jungle just as much as the next person, but I have experienced seriously inconsistencies between all 4 locations I've frequented. Sometimes the food (esp the hummus) is SO incredibly salty that I can't even taste the hummus for what it is..... It is awfully Americanized, but there are so many other wonderful things on the menu to choose from.  The Fetoosh Salad is really quite good but it will feed you for 3 days (no kidding). My absolute favorite is the Mediterranean Salad with tabouli, raisins, pine nuts, and sauteed tofu. The Vegetarian sample platter is also a great way to get many good things.  The service is really, really, really weird. If you order an appetizer, 9 times out of 10 it will come WITH the entrees. Not in any good enough amount of time to work on it before much else. Some of the servers come back to the table a million times to ask how you are doing when you would like to be left alone to stuff your piehole. On that note, there are SO many airheaded, clueless hipsters working at these places that the service really, really, really suffers.   Otherwise, enjoy your Americanized Middle eastern food. It's damn tasty."}
{"text":"I love Pita Jungle. Such great flavor and I appreciate all of the vegan options. My favorite entree is the Macro Platter and my husband loves the Shwarma. And of course their hummus is the bomb. Pita Jungle also has the BEST happy hour food by far with the best prices. I love that there are several locations, but my favorite has always been the Dana Park location. There's just something about it. I like the atmosphere, the fountain by patio, and the servers are friendlier at this location. Also, I have noticed that they might be a littler more generous on their portion sizes than the other Pita Jungle locations."}
{"text":"5 stars for catering!!! I was a little hesitant on getting Pita Jungle for a catered corporate event... They blew it outta the water though, all the platters looked elegant.  The staff was absolutely top notch and went above and beyond.  Kudos Pita Jungle for having amazing staff!!!! Makes all the difference in coming back.  Thank you!!!"}
{"text":"Pita jungle is awesome! Great options for healthy eating! Ice tea is on point! Every time I come to Phoenix I stop here at least once! They are kid friendly and have a bar area. The jalape√±o hummus is a must try!"}
{"text":"One year the local rag reader mag.  voted this place in the annual \"best\" issue... \"The best place to take someone from Tucson to make them feel like they are in Tucson\"  This is a compliment.  I love pita jungle.  The Chicken and humus appetizer is great... get the humus half red pepper and half jalape√±o.  Also, the Menchilada is enough grub for a few days."}
{"text":"Never had a bad thing here!!! Hummus trio is perfect for sharing or add chicken to make it a meal all your own! Lavosh Shawarma Wrap is another favorite of mine, I just ask them to add a smear of original hummus as well."}
{"text":"After a recent bad visit, Kevin (PR I think) and Manager Joe at this location, reached out immediately to make things right. And boy did they. I've eaten at PJ for years and am so happy that ownership is just as passionate and committed to providing a great experience today as they have been since the beginning."}
{"text":"Always a great menu- so many choices! The broiled chicken salad is a favorite. The chicken breast is always perfect - tender and marinated just right, on top of romaine with big tomato wedges, cucumber, and red onion. The best appetizer in the world might be the shrimp dish they have smothered in garlic with pita wedges to help enjoy the sauce. The place is always crowded- because they have great food!"}
{"text":"Pretty, casual restaurant with high ceilings, cool fire warmers for outdoor dining, and the best key lime pie candy in a basket at the hostess stand.  The hummus here is my fav!  I always get a large trio platter and a warm chicken pita.  Prices are just right too and service is always on point!"}
{"text":"After a crazy long day of work I decided to go grab a quick bite to eat at this new location close to my office.  I am a long time customer of Pita Jungle and very familiar with the menu and quality of food.  While I can't say I've visited every Pita Jungle in the Phoenix area, I can honestly say that this was the best service I have ever had at a Pita Jungle.  My server's name was Kelsey and she made the entire experience worth coming back.  Kelsey was quick to point out item's that were new to me on the menu, and catch me up to speed with the drink specials.  This to me is often something servers overlook.  I was happy to kick off my visit with a margarita, on special, and have everything else delivered in a timely manner.  Kelsey was also quick to keep the table clean and bring me my check when I was ready to head home.  Thanks again Pita Jungle for hiring this amazing server!  I will be back!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Great service and nice atmosphere. Inside is noisy. Food is consistently great. I've never had a bad meal here. The ahi and hummus is my favorite.  They offer drinks to go after your meal. Upbeat and yummy,!!"}
{"text":"A chain, yes but good and consistent.  Service was typical Pita Jungle service as was the food.  I will always eat here."}
{"text":"This place brings back good memories and I try to make a stop everytime I'm in town. Their passion ice tea is always very refreshing, perfect for the hot weather. Their hummus and tzatziki are always good starters. My favorite entree is their lavosh shawarma wrap with chicken, garlic sauce, and onions. It's baked so the outside wrap is slightly crispy and the inside is steaming hot. For dessert I love their carrot cake, back in the day I would pick up their carrot cake to go."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful meal at Pita Jungle this past Saturday. The staff was extremely attentive, expecially our server Jessica. From start to finish, the food was excellent and the service was top notch!"}
{"text":"I love coming here. The space is clean and inviting. The food is so yummy. The service is great and they keep reassuring if you are well. They make you feel so comfy. I am amazed by one of the managers at this location. I believe his name is Dale. What a professional and kind person. He made sure his customers are well taken care of and that the restaurant is moving at a great pace. He actually gets out there and works with the team and is so kind to everyone. I love Pita Jungle but hands down all the others need to take notes from this location. They are fantastic! Keep up the great job"}
{"text":"I really love Pita Jungle and I hate to post anything negative but I just gotta bring this to your attention. I ordered the wood fired salmon salad tonight and the salmon was completely raw and ice cold in the middle. You guys are usually great so I'm sure this is a one off but I just wanted to let you know. Thanks"}
{"text":"I have been a patron of Pita Jungle for YEARS (late 90s).  I used to live and work near the original one in Tempe.  Things have really changed and not for the better.  Inconsistent food and quality at every location.  I understand they have grown but they sure have not maintained quality and control.  The original restaurant was run with a touch a class and respect for the customer.  I remember the club I worked at we would always order our dinners from the original Pita Jungle and the one time we had a problem the owner came and dealt with us in person.  Now if you have an issue/problem they act like you are a bother and really don't care.   It's kind of makes me sad when restaurants go in this direction.  It clearly is about money now and not the local eatery that cares."}
{"text":"The food at pita jungle is very good from what I've had. However I do lot recommend this location. The wait staff was very unprofessional. We sat in a table right next to a group of employees blatantly gossiping, eating, and even FaceTiming other people. All while ignoring tables!! The food was good but the service ruins this location."}
{"text":"Not sure why I am bothering to write a review about this place but here it goes...  Cool decore, they have a spent a ton of money being hip.  Staff is cool to and for the most part do a good job.  Food is iffy... nothing great, to be sure. The hummus is just horrible, gyro is ok if you are really hungry.   Its a place for the masses who have an hour lunch and want to do something their friends will think is cool."}
{"text":"Having had a fantastic experience at the Gilbert (Val Vista and Williams Field) location with our entire staff for a employee's anniversary lunch, I figured Pita Jungle should be Pita Jungle, right?  And the Chandler location is closer to our workplace, so I called and let them know that two days hence, we would be treating one of our employees to his anniversary lunch.        We would be a party of fifteen, and although I know they don't take reservations, I wanted to find out what we can do to make it less of a surprise for them, and smoother sailing for our healthcare office's staff (we would have a set period of time to eat and get back to see the afternoon patients).      She reiterated they don't take reservations.  I know, sweetie, I know.  I'm just calling to give you a head's up that we're going to show up at noon in 2 days' time and we would like for that to not be hard on your staff.  Or mine.  \"Okay,\" she said, stating she would make a note, \"but it isn't a reservation.\"  Okay, I gotcha.     I called the day before to re-remind them we'd be there in one day, at noon, with 15 hungry people.  \"We can't, we don't, we won't,\" etc, she says.  I know, honey, I know you don't take reservations, I know what you can't and don't do in terms of reservations. Do you ACCEPT larger parties? \"Yes,\" she says.  \"So, I'm just calling to see what CAN be done\" I say.  \"I'll make a note but you can't have a reservation.\"  My goodness, it's never been harder for me to arrange to drop a few benji's on a small establishment.  The Gilbert location was gracious, had left a few tables in one area free, then scooted them together when our party arrived (just a couple months prior) and had us seated in one minute flat, gracious and happy to see us... so I figured with the ample heads-up, the Chandler location would probably do the same, right?     Right?      We show up, 15 of us, at noon the next day.  The young, male (old enough to drive, too young to drink) host is astounded at the size of our party. Like, he has never SEEN 15 people all together at one time before, ASTOUNDED.  I mention that while we know they don't do reservations, I've called ahead two days, and one day, prior. *crickets* She said she would make a note, let you all know we would be coming so you could plan ahead. *crickets*  To make sure you wouldn't be overwhelmed by our party. *crickets*  Because we are celebrating a much-loved employee's anniversary and it's really important because this is his favorite restaurant.  *crickets*        \"Well,\" he sighs, \"I don't know anything about that but it's going to be at LEAST a half hour wait. Is that okay?\"        There's no harm in asking nicely, so I did.  \"Well, actually, is there anything that can be done? We have about 49 minutes of lunch time left, so that doesn't really enable us to eat, is there any room out on that big patio? There's a large table down the middle of the restaurant that's just the right size for our party, which was completely empty, until you sat two people in the middle of it, like, 4 seconds before we were greeted, could they potentially sit somewhere else? Because we'd fit right there and they don't even have a water glass yet; I would pay for their lunch.\"        No.  There was obviously nothing he was willing to do, so I let him know that anything they can do is appreciated, because all 15 of us are here, and there's no time to arrange anything new.  So we wait for 19 minutes, and he comes over and tell us \"It's going to be at least another 40 minutes, so is that okay?\"      No.  That wasn't okay, not even remotely okay, and honestly I expect to be treated like this at Oregano's, pal, but I really didn't see this one coming. Why would you tell us 30 minutes, and 11 minutes short of the 30 minutes, tell us it's another 40 minutes?  You've been seating everyone who came in the door.  I asked if there was a manager. Nope.  Is there anyone I can talk to? (Because I'm thinking as a manager, I see potential solutions to this problem passing before my eyes with every choice you make, friend.)  Nope.         I know the kid is young.  And this is not his place.  And he can't possibly have enough experience to even know what customer care looks or sounds like... but he couldn't have possibly been slow enough to think that, on any level, this was okay.       So, in order to not break my recent goals of never saying reactive things, I simply walked out the door.  Saw Valle Luna just down the walk, and walked in there to ask if they'd seat us.  Sure, they said, come on over!      So all 15 of us mobbed down to Valle Luna, had just about the most delicious chips and salsa I've ever had, cold drinks on the table right away, and hot lunch served up within about 10 minutes, a check and boxes shortly thereafter, and we were back to the office on time, stuffed full of really delicious and satisfying food.  Please consider going there; they were fantastic."}
{"text":"The Pita Jungle is a locally based chain featuring a Mediterranean inspired menu. I was introduced to their cuisine by a friend, shortly after I moved to the valley back in 2009. And I've been enjoying their offerings ever since.  I was happy to see them expand into both Tucson and Flagstaff. Meanwhile, I've eaten at several of their locations in and around Phoenix. Consequently, I can say without hesitation, that the consistency of the food, from one Pita Jungle to the next, is remarkable! And recently, I had the pleasure of introducing another good friend of mine, and my oldest son, to the Pita Jungle near Mesa Community College.  The weather lately has been gorgeous, so we all agreed to eat on the patio. The service was both hospitable and relaxed. That's the general vibe you can expect at a Pita Jungle. And per usual, the service was excellent!  I've enjoyed nearly everything on the menu. So I suggested the hummus sampler which featured three kinds of hummus (regular, cilantro-jalape√±o and roasted bell pepper), cucumbers, olives, and Pita bread. Needless to say, it's probably the best vegan appetizer you're likely to try. And I love meat!  I selected a gyro, which is typical, however, I tried the Roasted Chicken Shawarma for a change. It was just as excellent as any other gyro I've enjoyed here. My company also enjoyed their choices and their first visit.  The most remarkable thing about Pita Jungle, besides the incredible flavors offered across the menu, is that it's all fresh, very healthy, and heavy on vegan offerings. Who knew that was possible?"}
{"text":"i usually eat here after i hit the gym, cause after a hard workout you want something light and healthy. The servers are always nice and attentive. Been here a few times and i havent had a bad experience yet. always ALWAYS have the humus!"}
{"text":"This location is extremely inconsistent.  I have been supporting Pita Jungle since they opened their Tempe location on Apache Blvd. many years ago.  I work in the area of this location, but unfortunately today will be my last meal they prepare.  I hope they improve for their own sake. The location has steadily declined over the past two years and now is at a breaking point.  It's been a good run pita"}
{"text":"Went here with a co-worker for a quick lunch last week, and I now understand what the buzz is all about.  The food is tasty, healthy and simple.  Simple meaning that it doesn't have all kinds of crazy stuff/ingredients in it, and you can order a light healthy lunch easily.  We shared the trio hummus and a veggie pizza.  Both awesome, although I would say I've had hummus that is just as good elsewhere (but I guess how amazing can one make hummus, really?  it's chickpeas, garlic and whatever else you throw in there).  However I was QUITE impressed with the veggie pizza.  Perfect size for sharing, and the veggies were so fresh and colorful!  What a treat!  Will be back I'm sure.  I have a closer one in Gilbert & am hoping the food is consistently good across all their locations."}
{"text":"Fresh food, friendly staff and a nice place.  I recommend the hummus and the chicken pitas. This place has something for everyone, from the vegans to the carnivores.  An old favorite.   We occasionally do take out as well.   Can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"Always consistently good! I usually get the coconut curry soup or the falafel salad. Delicious every time! We also ate a lot at the Pita Jungle in Flagstaff when we lived there. I loved that this location had the same stellar service and food. I highly recommend them. I also like that they have a lot of vegan items to chose from. That seems to be hard to come by at many restaurants."}
{"text":"Another really popular place I just don't understand. It was crowded and the service wasn't that great. My grape leaves tasted like rubber and had tomatoes in them even though I asked for none.  The hummus tasted like it was made from powder and the pitas were hard."}
{"text":"I liked this place but didn't love it. Supposedly their veggie wrap is vegan if you omit the cheese, but ask to confirm. And then you can also get their falafel wrap. I got the falafel salad and the roasted red pepper hummus. The falafel itself isn't that great, it's basically just crispy and doesn't have much flavor so I wouldn't get that again. I enjoyed their hummus and pita bread though, but the pita goes stale quite quickly. If you leave it while you're eating your entree it becomes more like a cracker. I might come back here, but I also didn't like the dressing on the salad and we had to keep asking for extra pita. I've also had the spinach pasta which is vegan and pretty good, but very very oily. I'd try some of the other Mediterranean places over this one if you looking for a good meal."}
{"text":"Pita Jungle is one of my favorites because the food is great AND healthy. I leave there satisfied unlike the other times I may eat healthy and leave a restaurant wanting something more.  I haven't found a favorite dish yet, darn... more research needed. Last week I enjoyed a tureen of Roasted Tomato Soup. Yes, I said tureen due to the size of their \"bowl\". Nice thing was I took it home and still had 2 servings. I think next time I'll try the sampler my friend had, it looked amazing.  Why only 4 stars you ask? I found their hummus bland.....needs a little kick of garlic if you ask me. I see the red pepper hummus favorably reviewed-I'll order it next time."}
{"text":"Wine Wednesday-1/2 price bottle. Love that!  Try the Italian Pinot Grigio and you won't be disappointed. Enjoyed the seasonal avocado hummus.  We split the Lavosh Shwarma which was nicely plated for us with our own little salad. Perfect night with great service and fresh flavorful food."}
{"text":"This has become a favorite location of some of my co-workers that are on a special boot-camp diet because they can tailer to their needs.  After planning an extended lunch one day, we headed out to eat, and I don't think we planned enough time.  They were packed, wall to wall.  They were polite and worked quickly to get us a table and the service was really impressive.  To be honest, when I walked in the door, I thought I might be in Scottsdale, lots of people looking like they were trying to impress others, including some of the staff, but they lacked the attitude that often is associated with Scottsdale.  What was the most impressive was the service, that will rate them high in my book anytime, polite, quick, willing to work with us.  The food was fast and good, and extremely hot, temp wise.  They worked past my concerns of time and delivered an excellent meal in a rather challenging time for them."}
{"text":"I like Pita Jungle, their menu will work with most moods that I or my dining peeps are in, the food is great.  My only complaint has been the noise level, it's hard to carry on a conversation in the resturant."}
{"text":"The location and premises are fine.  Our waitress was so sour we actually made a bet as to who could make her smile before we paid the bill...nobody won.  The chicken in the chicken tikka was so rubbery that you could not cut through it even with the table knife they gave you.  The sauce was bland and lacked flavor.  And for this I paid $11 for the entre.  Definitely  not a repeater!"}
{"text":"First time visiting and we had Christi as our server. She was very attentive to our needs and made our experience exceptional! Food was good as well. We will be back!"}
{"text":"I love coming to pita jungle but what I love the most is that when I made a to go order the to go person who said her name was gabby had such an amazing personality regarding she was busy when I picked up my food she helped me right away and checked the order and made sure everything was ok !!! Definitely come back again !!"}
{"text":"Pita Jungle is definitely one of my fav restaurants.  I've been here countless times over the years and it is always a great experience.  There truly is not a bad thing on the menu.  Some of my personal favorites are the hummus trio with chicken, turkey pesto lavosh wrap, and the black bean burger.  They def have the best hummus I've ever eaten.  Everything is very reasonably priced and it is an extremely laid back atmosphere with very fast service.  If you go during high times expect to wait, but it is always well worth it.  If you want to try a variety of dishes go during their happy hour and try their $1 or $2 tappas.  You can order a whole bunch!  Never had a bad experience here... I would highly recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Good food but refused customers OUTSIDE due to the breed of their dog. 4 people didn't eat here today because of that. Sad."}
{"text":"Oh we love pita jungle! Great food, like seriously everything is yummy! I am having to muscles tonight, a special I've had once before. I love the salads and the pizzas. Hubs gets the philly cheese steak pita. The kids meals are the best part, so many healthy options and include a drink for $5! Love."}
{"text":"I love Pita Jungle, especially this location because it is so convenient for me, the service has always been outstanding, and there is a ton of seating both inside and outside. I also really like that they have recently (well maybe not so recently) started a happy hour tapas menu with food ranging from $1-3 Monday through Friday from 3-5:30pm.   My go-to items I order are either the Hummus with Grilled Chicken ($9.50, off the starter section)  or the Glazed Chicken Lavosh Pizza ($10.50) and I always order a regular/tropical iced tea ($3) for my beverage because it's the perfect blend of fruit, black tea, and some other flavor that equals heaven in your mouth. If you are a tea drinker, get it and also ask for an iced tea to-go, it's my favorite iced tea of any restaurant.  Back to the food, the hummus with grilled chicken appetizer is the perfect, maybe a little large, portion for one's own meal. You can choose between having one type of hummus or you can have all three (plain, roasted red pepper, cilantro)  that is topped with diced and shaved chicken and a side of two freshly warmed pitas. On the days I don't care about the calories I am consuming I opt for the glazed-chicken lavosh pizza. The glaze drizzled on top of the chicken and trio of cheese is honey based so you get the perfect combo of salty and sweet with each bite! I always keep coming back for more.   I will say that I am bummed that there are certain dishes you can order at one Pita Jungle location that are not offered at others; it is heart-breaking and annoying. I'm talking about you Wood-fired Veggie Lavosh Wrap (off the Specials Menu that comes with roasted potatoes and red pepper hummus) that I can only get at the Tempe location that is nowhere near my house. If this were Christmas, you would be Scrooge! Bah humbug!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places for lunch or dinner.  Lots of healthy options and almost everything is super yummy and portion size is just right.  We've brought many out of state friends and family and they are always impressed. Big salads and many entries that you won't find at other places like jalape√±o hummus, chicken lavash shwarma wrap,  and pesto chicken pizza.  Yum!"}
{"text":"I love their food.  The Medchilada is great the Tropical tea is awesome.  My kids ordered Strawberry smoothies and even though they were 5.99 I couldn't be mad because they were so damned good.  I've also had their Mahi Mahi with pita chips another great choice."}
{"text":"The food is always freshly prepared.  Medchilada is a great \"secret\" menu item and longtime favorite of mine.  Coconut Curry soup is great.  Tropical tea is delicious.  I recently tried the Kafta burger and it was awesome bursting with flavor. Another favorite of mine is the Mahi Mahi with pita chips."}
{"text":"This place is wonderful,  salads, pitas and anything for lunch.  This place is a little loud but is definitely chill.  Philly cheese steak pita....The bomb."}
{"text":"The reason I'm writing this review is because of how well the bar tender served everyone at the bar. I came in for a solo meal after a long day and wasn't expecting much. I wanted something quick, healthy, and affordable. I sat immediately at the bar and really enjoyed the attention to detail that Stephen gave to everyone here. Thanks for surprisingly pleasant experience Stephen!"}
{"text":"Was there with my daughter the other night and got the chicken pasta salad. Not sure what they did different but it was seriously the best chicken I think I have ever had!  Super moist and garlicky!  I love pita jungle and not just because my daughter worked there and all the staff are fabulous and attentive!  Ask for Valerie when you go,she is my favorite waitress!"}
{"text":"I went here for my sisters surprise birthday party and everyone working there was so much help! They gave us our own back room which completely hid us from the front, they helped identify my sister and her boyfriend so we could surprise them, they dealt with a fairly large group of people in such a nice manner that I couldn't help to applaud them. I will definitely be returning and hope I get the same waitress, I did not get her name but she was blonde and super helpful. Ps the food was also wonderful, the pita bread and hummus was amazing as was the turkey wrap"}
{"text":"We used to really enjoy this place. Everything had been consistent and tasty overall. One dish in particular was our favorite, chicken del sol. However, we got it to go about 3 months back. The dish was hardly recognizably. Flavorless, under seasoned and colorless. My 8 yo could make a better version. So we stopped going, but decided to give it one more try a few days ago. This time the dish had so much lemon it was not editable. Not sure who is tasting these dishes before they serve them, but we are done with this place."}
{"text":"Really fast service, even during a really busy time. Great specials, always something to eat/drink that's worth trying. Their happy hour is nice, but their prices are low to begin with. All around super convenient but really tasty!"}
{"text":"When I want a healthy meal I stop here. The menu is diverse but I like the pesto chicken and then take the Mediterranean salad home for the next day.  Staff friendly. Food consistently good. Have a variety of seating options for all kinds of tastes"}
{"text":"Food was good but what made our visit excellent was our server, Rocky. Attentive, kind, and patient. Great server and great experience. Food notes: Get the garlic dip appetizer and carmelized cauliflower side dish. Both were excellent. Gyro was just o.k."}
{"text":"Never been here before, loved all the food and service from our waiter, Lev! Many vegetarian options as well as a great Wood-Fired Chicken. Great atmosphere as well:)"}
{"text":"I ALWAYS order the Chicken Combo Platter because it is that good. It was just as tasty this time, however, I think the delivery was a little sub par.  I didn't have a \"to-go\" utensil package to eat with which made it immensely difficult to cut the chicken (which is normally sliced, but wasn't this time apparently) since I only had a plastic fork to use that I had at my office."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Pita Jungle location. Probably because it's right in my neighborhood and extremely convenient. I like that it's a little bit fancy and the art work in the restaurant really suits the Downtown Phoenix style. This is a great place for lunch or dinner. I have yet to try brunch. This is also a good place for take out. I like to order and take a short bike ride then come home and pop in a movie. This is what makes living downtown fun.   My favorite dish is the chicken combo at any Pita Jungle. This is due to the delicious garlic sauce that I can mix with the rice. I also like the combo of beans, onions, and pickle. So good! No matter what you are eating, I recommend ordering some garlic sauce on the side. If you like garlic that is..."}
{"text":"Whenever we want to eat healthy and right this is where we go and this is where we order from they do a great job and it still tastes great after a 45 minute wait on delivery"}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots in the valley for lunch, dinner or takeout. Never disappoints and food is always fresh and fantastic. My best friend and I meet here every other week and have wine and dinner and it's very reasonable. Ahi and hummus appetizer is a favorite and you must try the caramelized cauliflower side and/or the coconut curry soup. Oh and the best falafel pita I've ever had. Love love love PJ!!"}
{"text":"I always order the hummus sampler, which comes with of course traditional hummus, roasted bell pepper hummus and cilantro jalapeno hummus,  extra pita bread and a side order of cucumbers.  I love their curry chicken salad with extra caramelized onions.  I order the same thing every time that I haven't had a chance to try anything else.  More reason to return.  :)  It sounds like a a lot of food and I usually share this between 2 people easily.  It's a satisfying amount without feeling stuffed.  My only complaint is that the staff should have a dress code.  I understand it is very casual, however, I don't care to see the person taking my order with a backless shirt or extremely short shorts.   The staff has always been very nice and helpful but for the dress code alone I can only provide 4 stars."}
{"text":"I first went to a Pita Jungle over three years ago and wasn't impressed.  Earlier this week, a friend and I met at the Downtown Phoenix location for my belated birthday dinner.  Wow, has my opinion changed!  Service was great.  The ambiance was really comfortable.  The food was delicious.  What I appreciate most was our server's honesty.  I went in knowing I wanted baklava.  When I asked him if it was good, he said no.  I asked if he just didn't like baklava or if it was truly not good.  He said it was truly not good and recommended the carrot cake instead.  It may sound inconsequential to be so impressed about someone's opinion on dessert selection, but I thought it was really cool.  and the carrot cake?  TO. DIE. FOR.  Thank you, Anthony!  I went back yesterday with my cousin for lunch.  We arrived close to 12:30, at the height of the lunch rush.  We went in, gave our names, and waited just a few minutes for a table.  Again, service was great, even when we asked for extra pita, refills, or took forever to make up our minds.  This place  has quickly risen to the top of my favorites list!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch at 11:30 on a Monday. Ordered a Strawberry Banana Smoothie, Cilantro Jalapeno Hummus, and a gyro. Food was good and service was fast and friendly. Good spot for a quick and casual bite."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to eat! Food is delicious and healthy. Service is fantastic. This place is often busy and loud! If the weather is nice, definitely do sit outside. I recommend the Cilantro Jalape√±o Hummus, Turkey Pesto Wrap and 1000 Beans entrees."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Pita Jungle location. It's never too busy and the service is always good. Pita Jungle has the best hummus in town! I can come here to eat veggies and hummus and leave a happy camper. My only complaint is that the pita bread here is way too chewy. I think if you name your restaurant Pita Jungle you should have decent pita bread. Just my opinion."}
{"text":"If you're in Tempe or Phoenix I HIGHLY recommend Pita Jungle - one of my favorite restaurants of all time - heathy, tasty & amazing!   Get the Mediterranean Sampler Platter & some kind of chicken! The food & ambience turned a pouting 12yr old into a happy kid again: and I think that's about the most amazing thing you can say about food.  We split the Mediterranean Sampler Platter, Chicken over Cilantro Jalepeno Hummus (YUM! It's in the pics - looks like chicken over guacamole), 4 drinks and fed this family of 4 for $33!  Can't beat that at a great restaurant!!! Love, love, love this place - been coming since there was just the Tempe location on Apache back in the mid-90's. The service is EXCELLENT!"}

{"text":"Great little restaurant in Gilbert.  The hummus is absolutely delicious, especially the cilantro one.  Wait staff are attentive, and prices fair.  All the food arrived hot and fresh.  They also have a walk-up To-Go window, which is very convenient."}
{"text":"We love pita jungle and frequent all locations. The food is always delicious!.  But the last time we went to this location we were somewhat disappointed. We don't know the servers name but she had a gold lip ring in the middle of her lip, small petite female. Someone needs to remind her that she's in the hospitality industry and it wouldn't kill her to smile. She was so miserable looking it made us uncomfortable. We even asked a different server when we needed something for our table because we felt like our server hated her life. Maybe she was having a bad day? No excuse to zombie serve us at your job though. We will be back but definitely not her in section!"}
{"text":"I could eat at this place daily. I love love love their greek salad and the turkey pesto lavosh. The hummus is really good too. I find that the service is always pretty good, although when its super busy it can be spotty (understandably). I really enjoy the art that they feature in the restaurant and the overall laid back feel of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Fresh.  Tasty.  Interesting.  Good \"People Watching.\"  Love everything I have tried here.  The Happy Hour \"tapas\" are excellent.  My daughter could not get enough of the garlic chicken one.  The 3-bean plate is delish - kinda like \"meatless chili\" but you don't miss the meat.     The fruit salad is massive and the fruit served with it is completely top-notch.  Wait staff is mostly cute college girls, which is hardly ever a completely bad thing.  Never had a problem with good, attentive service, which CAN be a problem sometimes.  I go eat there as often as is reasonable.  Highly Recommended."}
{"text":"I'm a huge Lebanese good fan and I will admit I had low expectations because of the cutesy name. But the hummus was some of the best I've ever had (including in the Middle East) and the shawarma has big chunks of juicy chicken and wasn't oily like shawarmas sometimes get. Service at lunch was really quick and friendly!"}
{"text":"Fantastic dinner at Pita Jungle!   Wish we had this place back east!  Fantastic app of Seared and Seasoned Tuna over Hummus.  A combo I wouldn't have thought of but flavor that knocks you off your feet!   Great Gyro too.  No street meat here!   Wife had Hummus and Beef tips and she loved it as well!   Young vibe and good bar scene.  Open late.  Quick sit down service.  We will be back very soon. Can't wait!"}
{"text":"New to the area, I made it a point to stop in to Pita Jungle based on my first experience in Scottsdale/Frank Lloyd Wright area.  Came in earlier than normal to place a To Go order, staff was exceptionally friendly & accommodating.  The Hostess said most of her dining involves eating their food, we agreed, the Menu choices, reasonable prices & fresh flavors can't be beat."}
{"text":"Amazing food ... hummus is really good.  There chicken is filled with flavor  Pitas isn't made in house but still good Very reasonable priced , not starving but hungry try there roasted vegetables.."}
{"text":"Came here before seeing Star Wars with my friends to grab some dinner.  I remember this location back since it was Ruby Tuesday's years ago and seeing how they changed the ambiance in the place and had really made it look good was my first thought.  For food I had the nightly special of coconut curry soup that was really tasty and was recommended by my friend who got a cup before I got there. I followed that by getting the salmon salad but I swapped the Ahi Tuna from the Ahi salad (the ahi salad had a bunch of fruits in it and I am one of the people who likes my fruit separate from my other foods). The salad was really good and the crust on the ahi was great. The fish itself wasn't the freshest but it wasn't bad either. Just don't be expecting high end sushi quality.  The service was great and our waitress did a great job handling splitting checks for the group and getting things out quick.  The only negative I have is that the prices are a bit on the high end for the type of food but being on Mill it is to be expected.  I am probably going to add them in as a regular in the rotation of pre-movie dinner spots in the area. Going with 3 star for now as it's good but middle of the pack as far as options go but really should be a 3.5."}
{"text":"Boy do I LOVE Pita Jungle!!  I'm so glad they made it up to Desert Ridge. I have always had a fantastic meal at Pita Jungle. My favorite is the Mediterranean chicken salad. It's HUGE and so delicious. Great chicken, fresh veggies, the perfect dressing. There is nothing better, except maybe the hummus. Always a hit!  I'd love to review more menu items, but I always get the same thing. The lemonade is great, not a fountain drink. And a great tasting fresh lemonade, not like all the others.   The service has always been friendly. They are always super busy, so sometimes you have to wait. But, it's so worth it!  Lunch is always crazy busy. The patio is perfect on a great night. In the summer they have mist and big fans.  I could eat Pita Jungle almost every day :)"}
{"text":"Worst Pita Jungle I've been too.   The server didn't even tell us it was happy hour so we ordered things on the full price menu. (Would have changed my order had I known).   The food that was brought to us was cold and the proportions of the ingredients were off.  It took forever to get our water and the waitress was slow to stop by to check on us... and other employees never made eye contact."}
{"text":"I love this place. Thought about take out all day. Called at 520 pm and the girl who answered is hurting the company! She sounded like I was bothering her and said she would transfer me to someone who'd take my order......10 mins later I hung up, called back and the same girl answered with the same response, same attitude.. Forget it, poor service!!!"}
{"text":"I love eating there.  The food is always so good and healthy.  The Mediteranian chicken salad is my favorite, but I have enjoyed every meal.  The seating is too crowded and they are always busy, but it is worth being a bit cramped."}
{"text":"It started off good, the host was very friendly and greeted us with a smile. After that it went downhill fast. Our server name was Kyle. I don't know if he was new or just didn't care, either way you should always put your customers first no matter what kind of day your having. My wife and I ordered an appetizer before our meal. However, the appetizer came with the meal, what's the point in that. It was a bit annoying. That's just the start. He walked by our table several times without acknowledging us or even refilling our waters. We had to ask him to refill our waters. Then we had to ask another server for our check and to go waters. Even paying for our bill took the longest time, which I however thought we should have been comp for the terrible service. I also noticed that other customers were looking for Kyle too. I think moving forward we will continue to go to the Desert Ridge Location, by far the best!!!"}
{"text":"Chicken Philly pita with tsaziki on the side in less than 30 minutes. Fuck yeah. So much chicken so little pita."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this location since it opened.  Tonight may have been my last visit.  Came in an hour before closing and the staff was so concerned with closing duties they forgot they were still serving customers.  There were less than 15 guests in the place and our food took about twenty minutes to get to the table.  Ok, not a big deal but my chicken was over cooked and really over seasoned and my caramelized cauliflower was so undercooked it was more like lightly steamed... my husbands chicken philly had barely cooked onions and peppers.  The waiter came and saw my barely eaten food and didn't even ask if something was wrong with it.  This was a terrible experience.  I don't think there was a manager around.. too bad because maybe a little guidance would have gone a long way."}
{"text":"This place was fast in service when I ordered via phone; however, a big minus was the food did not taste like authentic Middle Eastern food. The dolmadas tasted like cleaning product was in it. The falafel was decent- but again it's America - nized version of middle eastern food."}
{"text":"Christi was our server today and she was absolutely amazing!! Always love coming to this location. Everyone is always so friendly and attentive!"}
{"text":"I was helped at the bar. She was busy taking to-go orders, helping the bar patrons, helping guess begin a to-go all while giving amazing service! She was so helpful and so attentive for how busy it was. I loved my experience here. I'm from the west side but travel for work and appointments. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This locations keeps messing up orders. The acknowledge that they make mistakes and do nothing to fix them. After throwing another lunch away that was prepared by then I have decided to stop supporting the entire company. We eat at pita jungle at least twice a week and the lack of customer service is becoming more and more of an issue. I will not be going back."}
{"text":"Delicious meal today with friends.  I like the food at Pita Jungle, but it doesn't make me rave. Today's meal was \"raving\" good!  My Grilled Mahi with Quinoa Pilaf (pictured) was fabulous, and was on the Specials menu, so, of course, I wonder if I'll ever see it again! Had cabbage, pine nuts and almond slivers in it, too. Friends had gyro sandwiches (good), and another item from the Specials menu, Red Quinoa Salad with Cilantro Jalapeno Hummus, which she enjoyed. Good food, good service, good time."}
{"text":"I didn't know food at one Pita Jungle could differ from another.  I swore I would never return to this location after I witnessed an employee do something gross (sneezed in her palm, handled money, and then bare handed my pita), which I notified a manager of and it was rectified.  Fast forward a couple of years.  I return.  Wow.  The tofu at this location is fantastic.  The Macro platter here is worth the drive from where I am and I would drive past 2 other Pita Jungles.  Big fan.  The server was really nice.  I was at 0 stars when I walked in and became 4 stars when I left."}
{"text":"One of my all Time favorites. Clean healthy eating on a whim ! Love the different art the host in the restaurants around town . Cilantro jalape√±o hummus with chicken add cucumbers  is my jam !"}
{"text":"Be honest. How many times a day do you check yourself out in the mirror?  A bunch? I know, me too. Sort of. Well...not really, but I do look for my reflection a lot In all sorts of things.  Like the toaster.  Or my computer screen when it's black, and almost always my car...its windows as I'm getting in, and the rear view while when I'm driving.  Well if you like checking yourself out too, a lot, have I got a hot tip for you! Pita Jungle.  The food here is great.  Let's see, you need to order something...yeah, just get the cilantro-jalapeno hummus for an appy, and the lavosh pizza with chicken as your entree.   There, now that that's out of the way, check out that mirror on the north wall spanning the entire room. Glorious isn't it. And there you are. Is this not the shit???  You, in all your glory, sitting there facing the mirror and talking to your bottle of Coors light as anyone who tries to furtively check-out your backside is busted by your mirror glancing skills.  You'll delight when your order arrives, as you can now watch yourself eat, drink, and steal wayward glances at all the weird people in this place who ARE NOT looking in the mirror at themselves.  I also recommend the Coors light. Not too hoppy or bitter with just the right amount of alcohol. They serve it in a brown bottle with a cute blue label indicating it's cold.  Just precious."}
{"text":"For a food court fast food vegan style establishment, I have to admit it was great. The chicken greek salad was delicious and I paired it with the Moroccan gazpacho. I should have other one or the other, the salad alone was huge; enough for two to share."}
{"text":"Yummy Mediterranean! While the food is good it is not Greek or Lebanese. Their grape leaves are cold which actually if you know great stuffed grape leaves they have to be warmed with extra virgin olive oil. Plus I consider myself to be a baba ganoush expert because my husband is Lebanese raised and there's is pretty good except for the gross salsa they plop in the middle. However their saving grace is the caramelized cauliflower appetizer and their lavash bread wraps are delicious, such a refreshing change from nasty carb heavy pitas!  Plus the service is great!"}
{"text":"What's for dinner at least 3x a week in our household? PITA JUNGLE! The food is CONSISTENTLY fresh and delicious! When I ask my five-year-old son where he wants to go to eat, his answer is the same as above. He enjoys the kids plate that consists of chicken, hummus, steamed spinach, and fresh fruit. I always order the caprese salad as my meal with extra basil and vinegar. Their cold green tea is always refreshing! About 90% of the time, the service is outstanding! It's that 10% that gets a lil under my skin- cuz when it's bad, IT'S BAD ;(  I don't wanna have to flag my wait staff down for something I need to even start to eat. That puts a damper on my dining experience. I have to say that the service at the location and the Tempe location are the best. I am surprised that the one in Mesa is still open because I consistently get SUPER HORRIBLE service there!!!!"}
{"text":"Consistently good. Good bang for the buck. Healthy food choices and fun atmosphere. One of our favorites."}
{"text":"Chicken marsala to go straight out of the bag and I haven't touched it. Highly disappointed for being $13. Hopefully it tastes better than it looks. :("}
{"text":"Love the broiled chicken salad. The wait tends to be a long time. I recommend calling in your order."}
{"text":"In town for business, staying at a hotel, and just wanted decent, healthy carry out. I followed the suggestions on the reviews and got the Mediterranean chicken salad. It was delicious! I highly recommend it to anyone who is just looking for a quick convenient bite that is not fast food."}
{"text":"Yummy.  This is my 3rd location that I've visited and I'm hooked.  Great space, great food, great service and great company.  I will come back for sure when I'm back in this neighborhood and need to have a chill spot to relax a little and get my grub on."}
{"text":"I love Pita Jungle so much.  It's great at this location as well as the one off Happy Valley which I frequent more.  I love the fact that there is one next to my shop and also one close to where I live.  Very convenient and yummy.  Can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Delicious food.  Great service.  Attractive scenery.  Knowledgeable staff on what's good and popular.  Seemed very casual but not too casual, loved it.  Definitely a mixed crowd.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"Not a huge fan of this location. I have been to many of the others and usually have the yellowfin tuna salad. I ordered it here and the tuna came in small cubes and was cooked all the way through. At the other locations it is one piece and just seared on the outside. I asked their server about it and she said each location has a different menu. So I won't be returning to this location."}
{"text":"Get the red pepper hummus with chicken and you will not be disappointed. Service was great and Abby was so friendly!"}
{"text":"Once again you messed up. When a person asks to not have items included such as onions or raisins it means they do not want them!!! Also ripe cucumbers are not soft and are not discolored. Yours consistently are both of these.  I have tried you many times but after this take out disaster I'm done with you Pita Jungle. You simply stink!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Great fast service and yummy pretty healthy food. Great at lunchtime. Large portions, reasonable prices and great service.  I'm a fan of Pita Jungle!"}
{"text":"I never thought I'd say it but dammit, I have jungle fever.    Pita Jungle actually makes healthy food taste good, which I didnt think was possible.  I usually go for some sort of chicken wrap, which comes with a salad, etc etc...  The hummus is also a staple in my PJ diet.  Cant go wrong with the caprese salad too.    Service is something I think could be better...  The waitstaff is all pretty granola-y, which I have nothing against, but they dont so much hustle as they do shuffle around.  If you know what I mean,  No?  Go see for yourself.  But get there early, you'll usually wait a bit."}
{"text":"For the money you spend here, the proportions are HUGE. You'll need a doggy bag. I ordered a side salad. It was as big as my head. I wanted to order Greek food, cause HELLO?, it's a Greek restaurant. However, my budget didn't allow me to order the lamb. Sooo, I ordered the next best thing. Mexican food!! Yes, they have it here too. I ordered a cheaper quesadilla so I can't comment on their Greek food, but let me say the quesadilla was really, really good. And I had to take most of it home because I was already full with the yummy salad.   Enough of the food. So from the outside, the place looks like a shabby place. The location is in a tiny plaza between a bartending adademy and a Planned Parenthood. However, when you enter, you are transported to a classy, laidback restaurant. It's packed and for good reason. And on the wall, there are local artist's pieces displayed for sale so they apparently support local artists. Very cool in my book. It's along the light rail, which is good cause the parking lot is small. Even though it's packed, the waiters are VERY organized and attentive."}
{"text":"The first couple of visits the menu might come off as a little insipid.  Don't let that deter you because your tastebuds need time to detox from all of the fatty burgers you once consumed. You will soon find a menu full of dishes to feel good about."}
{"text":"The food is always so fresh and tasty. They have a really great happy hour so it's cheap to try multiple appetizers. The hummus and gyros are my absolute favorite. I really enjoy the falafel too."}
{"text":"When I want to feel like I am eating really healthy or pretending to be a vegetarian for a meal, I love Pita Jungle.  But the whole truth is there is no where I have found in AZ or SD that has better Falafel than Pita Jungle. Their Falafel's are perfect, crunchy and not oily at all. They must have some miracle oil that does penetrate the food, because sometimes I forget they are fried! And when you order the Falafel platter it comes with lots of fresh tomatoes, pickles (my favorite), Red onions, and lettuce. Make your own wraps with the pitas provided and you are in HEAVEN!   Oh and don't forget their Mediterranean platter, with tons of great hummus, tabuli, baba ganouj, and my favorite a cold green bean salad, which I know doesn't sound that appetizing, but try it just once and you will be hooked!   The food is always fresh, healthy, and oh so yummy!  And they are expanding all the time! Which means getting good food will be easier! New location to open in Phoenix and Tucson!"}
{"text":"Just stopped in for dinner after a long work day. We have eaten at Pita Jungle before so we were eager to have our favorite there. Unfortunately, the turkey burger was removed from the menu! Dang it! My fianc√© order the fish sandwich instead. The fish was dry and lacked any flavor so he had then exchange it for the bean burger which was better. I had the Mediterranean platter and it was good as well. It seems like food and service isn't what it once was when we would go in the past. With so many restaurants to choose from in the area an established restaurant can't afford to let things slip. Our meals were good but there are several other restaurants where the ingredients are fresher and the service is more engaging. A nice place for a quick casual meal."}
{"text":"First time there and waaay impressed with the food. Seven of us went and no one had any complaints about anything. We all very much enjoyed our selections. Every plate of food that I saw had fabulous presentation with the exception of the plate of hummus we ordered for the table. It arrived in unappetizing pools on a plate. Tasted great but ugly to look at. The music is extremely loud but this is right in the middle of college student heaven so it is expected. I LOVED the food and am excited to go back.  Parking in downtown Tempe at lunch is a nightmare, but you already know that."}
{"text":"Yummy Tapas! Awesome atmosphere! Except my friend found a hair in her shrimp dish...eek!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Pita Jungle location! The staff is so friendly and accommodating and the food is delicious of course! I love coming here whenever I am in Ahwatukee!"}
{"text":"Food great as always TOO LOUD Whether it's True Food or Pita Jungle which create really good food. I don't understand why they don't understand that a healthy environment is also important. Everyone's voices bouncing off the ceiling is not healthy. Substituting aliveness for noise not a good swap Comfy relaxed booths would be awesome."}
{"text":"Best hummus on the planet.   My favorite restaurant of all time.  The chicken pasta salad and the chicken combo platters are my favorites.  They catered my wedding almost 7 years ago and recently catered a bridal shower I hosted for a friend.  I've been to the Tempe, Scottsdale, Arcadia and Desert Ridge locations. All of them are awesome!"}
{"text":"If you want hummus, a delicious salad, or some more traditional dishes you will love it. Downside is that service has always been slow, always very very loud inside on busy hot days, and they have the tables so close to each other that your chair gets hit several times during your meal by servers & guests trying to get in/out."}
{"text":"Go here all the time.  Great food never had a bad experience yet.  Great gyro.  Love the hummus and rice pudding.  Alexis is a great server really brightens the place up.  Will be a regular customer for you keep up the great work."}
{"text":"Not much to say here that hasn't being said.  PJ is my staple restaurant for fresh, healthy mediterranean inspired food. Avoid if you don't like crowds though, it's almost always busy."}
{"text":"Yummy! Big portions, low prices... and food that doesn't make you feel guilty after eating it.  Love the outdoor atmosphere too.  This is a nice place to bring friends after a hike, or just enjoy a casual meal during your day."}
{"text":"Normally I love Pita Jungle. Still mostly do. The food is always great. But today, with a group of people, we had, by far, the worst service I have ever gotten. And one of the people at our table was friendly with our server. Well, she was served just fine. The rest of us? HORRIBLE!.  It started promising with immediate drink orders and deliveries. And then it spiraled down real fast. It was 30 minutes (maybe more) before she came by to take orders. And if you are wondering why we didn't waive her down, she wasn't anywhere to be seen.   Orders taken and 25 - 30 minutes later we are wondering where our appetizer was. She asked if we wanted it first, we said yes. I am certain if I didn't call her over and ask, we would have gotten it with our main course - something I despise. (It is called an appetizer for a reason!)  5 minutes later, appetizer. 10 minutes after that the very slow bringing of the food and the \"Auction.\" After we all had our food...oh wait, we had that lone person that had to wait a while longer. No, she didn't have a special order. Finally, we have food and drinks. Oh wait a minute - some of the table got refills.  Here is the worst part - I LOVE LOVE LOVE the food at Pita Jungle. but today, my stomach was in such knots and frustration, I really didn't enjoy the food. It was delicious, I just didn't get a chance to enjoy it.   A FEW HOURS LATER - I am very impressed by how fast Pita Jungle got in touch with me to find out more about the issue. I will go back because the food is great and because of the way management is handling this."}
{"text":"I am a huge PITA JUNGLE fan and have been going to the Shea location for years. I recently took my husband to the FLW location.  He's never been to PITA. He loved it!  The service was great, the atmosphere was great and the food was outstanding (as usual).  If you havent' been, you're missing out on a nice dining experience!"}
{"text":"Love Love Pita! I have tried a lot of the menu items but always go back to getting the Mediterranean Platter, it has a little bit of everything. The black bean burger is good as well. I've never eaten an actual meat hamburger in my life so it still feels weird to eat this... but gosh is it delish. This location is always packed... weekend, weekday, early, late... always busy. However, you still don't have to wait too long for your food and the servers have always been polite and courteous. If you like healthy AND hearty... go to Pita!"}
{"text":"Of all locations...this place is THE BEST! From the warm and welcoming staff, to the amazing food. I have never been disappointed with the food they have to offer. They'll even customize to fit your diet (Ketogenic/Low Carb here!)  Prices are cheap and you get great value for what you pay. I'd highly recommend this location to anyone out there that might have had a bad experience in the past. They'll treat you like family."}
{"text":"Pretty disappointed with this place. Lights out all over. Purses and personal belongings all over the bar. Dirty menus. Bar supplies not put up. The food was substandard. We ordered hummus and it was watery and bland. I know it's a chain but a little more management presence would go along way with details. It was busy and the food came out quick but it was flat, bland and boring. I think people come here for cuisine that's different and it's in a good location. I want this place to do better because I have been to some that were good."}
{"text":"Why have I not tried this place before?  After a movie, while roaming around the outdoor shops, the familiar voices/sounds of \"I'm Hungry\" starts to be heard from the family.... they always set me up so well.  The portion sizes are huge! Like BIG! Easily shared between 2 people for one order. The 4 of us shared a \"Yellowfin Tuna Honey Sesame Salad\" and a \"Chicken Del Sol\". The tuna was seared to perfection and not overcooked, and the chicken was moist and tender... both dishes satisfied the entire bunch!  It was busy, and service was a little slow. But, nothing that could not be dealt with. And, when the server did come around, he made sure we were well taken care of before moving on.  At around $11/plate, and only having to order 2, this is a great place to bring the family if on a budget and looking for good quality food!  Lastly - the bathrooms were clean and well kept. I was a little surprised considering how busy they were. And, with little girls, clean bathrooms are a huge plus in my book!"}
{"text":"Always Fresh and Delicious   I have always enjoyed eating at Pita Jungle, the service is exceptional and you always leave pita jungle wanting more.   The serving sizes are very generous and you will find yourself having to take home leftovers. Today, my friends and I ordered the hummus trio for an appetizer, and we split a few chicken pita wraps. If you like hummus at all, you need to try the Cilantro Jalape√±o hummus, and the Roasted Red Pepper Hummus they are delicious. If hummus isn't for you Pita Jungle offers a wide variety of menu selections. There are quite a few salads (\"Sizzling\", or \"Cold\"), healthy burgers (Black Bean, Portobello Mushroom or Broiled Fish) and Wood Fired Pizzas.   The service is always friendly, courteous, and the food is always fresh and delicious. So if your ever in the area give Pita Jungle a try"}
{"text":"I really liked Pita Jungle. Our server was very sweet, she was very helpful when I asked for suggestions, she also made my entree a special custom order (which I appreciated and she encouraged). The food tasted good and I would definitely come back. The bf ordered the chicken pita with the greek pita and I ordered the \"Pesto Lavash Turkey Wrap\" but substituted the turkey for chicken (upon her suggestion)."}
{"text":"I ordered the Falafel Salad and got the worst food poisoning I've had in years. Reported it to the Pita Jungle Uptown location and they basically said I was lying. I will never go back."}
{"text":"Always Fresh and Always good   I have always enjoyed eating at Pita Jungle , the service is exceptional and you always leave wanting more.   The serving sizes are generous. Today, my friends and I ordered the hummus for an appetizer, and we split a few Chicken Chipotle Pita Wraps. If you like hummus at all, you need to try it, you won't be disappointed.  If hummus isn't for you Pita Jungle offers a wide variety of entr√©e selections. There are  salads and great desserts.  The service is always friendly, courteous, and the food is always fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"Vistes from Portland and wanted something fresh with healthier options. They have great selections to accommodate many tastes! A casual and friendly atmosphere with fairly quick service."}
{"text":"Love this place.  So fresh and very flavorful healthy food.  Great staff and service.  The pita chips are to die for and so is the wood fired chicken!"}
{"text":"\"Quantity without compromising on Quality\"  Pros: Large portions Yummy food... I have been there a couple of times and was never let down Great variety Good Tapas especially if u end up in the Happy Hour Reasonably priced  Cons: As someone else mentioned -Beer selection on tap Not really a con but personally i feel that the food ain't really zesty a la authentic meditarranean food... They could atleast provide a sumac in a pepper shaker as they do at the Zaytoon Kabab bistro"}
{"text":"I normally LOVE Pita Jungle but this location is a disappointment. It was dirty, music blaring from the kitchen clashing with dining room. People openly eating in the kitchen.  The food was meh, servers were disinterested  Poorly managed from what I saw. Sad because  the other locations are wonderful."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been going to Pita jungle for a couple of years now and its one of our favorite dinner spots.  The decor is cool with local art on the walls that is always changing.  The staff is always friendly and upbeat.  The have a pretty good wine list and fresh healthy really good food.  Best hummas ever and the greek salad is super yummy."}
{"text":"Have been craving the Tempe Pita Jungle for a bit now. Just miss the place...haven't been there in over a year.   So, I was riding the light rail today getting some errands done and just decided....\"Hey, I've got nothing to do...and the light rail stops basically right in front of Pita Jungle....so, why not?\" So I rode the light rail into Tempe and got off at the Dorsey station, walked across the street, and there I was.  I ordered the chicken schwarma (sp?) pita sandwich and a side of the green beans and an iced tea. And literally the food was served within two minutes....I swear.   Food was still great tasting and great quality. I've always loved the green beans there.....reminds me of something my mother used to make. They are served cold....but they are SO good. I think it brings back childhood memories.....AKA comfort food.  Love the vibe of the place....with the cool cross-section of Tempe patrons that visit the place and all the great artwork on the walls.   Glad it's on the light rail line which adds convenience.   Great place to enjoy some great food in a great atmosphere."}
{"text":"They are not dog friendly on their patio...I can't believe that they have a big beautiful patio but refuse to allow dogs. They have specials for kids...which in my experience cause way more dammage and are dirtier than most dogs I know."}
{"text":"Pita Jungle is a popular lunch place in the area and parking can be an issue.  The d√©cor is sleek with loud music playing in the background. The menu has a great selection of items to choose from.  We had two different hummus, roasted bell pepper and cilantro jalapeno.  I really like the cilantro jalapeno, it was creamy with a bit of a kick to it. The Mediterranean chicken salad was delicious, the cubed chicken in the salad was a little warm which I loved.  The portions are huge.  The server was fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful delicious lunch at Pita Jungle today. I'm keeping to a very clean diet, and the ability to order from the protein and side menus allowed me to put together a tasty, filling and nutritious meal while enjoying the company of my family in a great atmosphere!  The service was excellent, as always, and the restaurant was clean and nicely furnushed. It has a great ambiance for conversation with your dining companions.  I have visited this restaurant at least five times, and always found it to be perfect in food quality and preparation, speed of service, and general atmosphere.  For the food quantity and quality you receive, the prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"Why would I tell you when I'd be coming! You don't like the element of surprise and know that your black bean burgers are still the same mushiness. You'll never know if and when I'll be visiting one of your locations. I like surprises."}
{"text":"A few friends and I stopped by last night to try out this new location, and it's a hit!  It's super cute inside, with a large enclosed patio, interesting decor, etc.  It's definitely one of the cooler-looking Pita Jungles.   The food was delicious - definitely up to par with my expectations based on other locations, and that's saying something wonderful.  We ordered a tri-flavor humus, coconut curry soup and the honey sesame ahi salad.  Our friends had the shrimp linguine and the Mediterranean platter.    The flavors and preparation were excellent on every item.  My ahi was perfectly cooked and the salad was lovely, the soup was full of flavor, the humus was large and yummy.  The Med platter was packed with an impressive array of items and the shrimp linguine even seemed to have more veggies than usual.  The only downside was that the pitas were a little dry.  I've gotten several different take-out items from this location, and they were tasty, as well!  Check your takeout order before leaving - mine was missing pitas once and they don't include plastic ware by default.  The service was just ok, but that's pretty par for the course at PJs.  After a few more visits, this might bump up to 5 stars.  If you've never been to this delightful local chain before, Pita Jungle serves the most delicious, healthy food for a great price.  Almost everything on the menu is incredibly flavorful and never heavy.  Suggestions include the famous hummus, the pita and lavosh sandwiches (generous portions bursting with flavor), wonderful lavosh pizzas, and the delicious seared ahi tuna dishes.  The side vegetables and potatoes are both amazing, and you can get the veggies steamed, so you can even come here on a diet."}
{"text":"It breaks my heart to change this from 5 stars to 3...the food here is terrific, but I've gotten terrible service over and over and over again.  The servers are frequently awful, whether we've come in groups or just the two of us.  They're unpleasant and short, they make mistakes, then don't check on the table after the food arrives, so they're too late to correct the problem.    The takeout isn't consistent, either - the last time, they made the wrong food when we were in a hurry, then remade it and left part of it out (so we had to go back in, which made us late), and charged us the wrong amount, to boot.  They reversed the charge and re-charged us the right amount, which still ties up the money.    After five or so bad visits in a row, my husband won't come here anymore, and I don't blame him.  After coming here hundreds of times (I've been the Duchess for ages), I don't know when I'll be back.  Why 3 stars (instead of 2 or 1)?  The quality of the food is still excellent, but it's the same as every other Pita Jungle.  I wouldn't come to this location."}
{"text":"I'd never been to a Pita Jungle until my friends invited me to dinner with them there.  I'd seen the place many times but until I got the invite, I'd not seen the draw.    We started off splitting a hummus and pita appetizer.  It was delicious!  Great texture, beautiful amounts of garlic with cucumber and tomato slices on the side to go with the pitas.  My friends raved about the gyros (seemed a bit odd to me that they had lettuce but, they did not complain.)  I got the beef philly pita, being a rebel.  It was a bit juicier than I expected, and I have had better but I enjoyed it more than I expected.  The staff was reasonably fast despite it being a rather packed house and was unfailingly nice.  Not many places would be that busy yet that fast and pleasant.    If I was a bit more in love with the Philly, I might have given 5 stars but I will very much consider going back some time in the future.  Very much a place to go with friends!"}
{"text":"wiat was a bit long during the lunch hour, however great food  and great service."}
{"text":"I crave their hummus so HAVE TO go regularly. Try the jalape√±o cilantro version for a taste bud explosion. Falafel PTAs are great and for me Pepsi products are the icing on the cake."}
{"text":"Great service and tasty, yummy food. I've never had a bad meal at any Pita Jungle location. It's hard to pick a favorite dish. Some things are no longer on the menu, but I've asked for them anyway and they have always been accommodating. I kinda love that in a restaurant.  Our server today was great. Ask for Mariah. She'll hook you up with beverages to go and is fast and sweet.  :)    Take all your out of town guests here. Each location has different decor but the food remains consistently good at each and every one.  Love me some Pita Jungle!"}
{"text":"Mmmmmmmmmm I LOVE me some Pita Pit! Great to have this location down the street. Philly/Chicken Philly Pitas are legit, original Pitas are SOOOO good and the spanakopita is BOMB!   Kinda feel like a guy named Shiloh should be taking my order sometimes tho (bonus points if you get the movie reference)...I get funny looks from people because I'm eating meat from time to time. But it doesn't stop me from coming in and gettin my grub onnn."}
{"text":"I was visiting Phoenix and was looking for a good vegan spot, after hunting thru Yelp, I decided on Pita Jungle....and I hit the Jackpot! Service was great, and the food was even better. My waiter was quick, informative and even insisted on checking to make sure everything I would be eating was vegan. They even switched my bun for a whole wheat flatbread. I had the black bean burger and it was one of the best burgers I've ever had in my LIFE, meatless or otherwise. It was seasoned to perfection and so was the potatoes. It came with tahini sauce, which I've never had before, but I loved that too! Everything tasted like it was freshly made, and not that over processed heat it and eat it mess. My friend ordered a side of baked cauliflower that was dressed in caramelized onions and that was amazing too! I definitely recommend this place whether you are a vegan or not."}
{"text":"This is hands down my favorite Pita location. I've been coming here for a few months, and I always sit at the bar.  I always sit at the bar because of your bartender, Ashley. And considering the last 3 times I've been in, I've run in to the same people - I know I'm not the only one who comes in specifically because she's working.  I was in tonight, and it was very busy. But while everyone seemed to be frantically running around, Ashley was calm and cool, while remaining friendly and engaging.  When I asked her what her background was, I was not surprised to hear that she grew up in the restaurant business.  I loved my flatbread, as usual. But, the reason I come back here is the superb service at the bar."}
{"text":"This is our first visit at this Pita Jungle since moving to Ahwatukee.  As others have mentioned to me, the service and food is not as good as we have experienced at the other locations."}
{"text":"Always a great experience here. I've been coming here for years and the food is always on point and the service is just attentive enough. The only complaint I would have is it can get very packed so once in awhile the service can get a bit too busy and it is hard to flag them down. However, they are very quick with any requests and the food comes out quickly. They are very consistent and I haven't found something I don't like on their menu and will continue to keep trying new things! Definitely try the nachos, garlic mushrooms and lavosh shawarma wrap!"}
{"text":"Pita Jungle is my new favorite vegan-friendly restaurant...love it!  And my super-picky, non-vegan husband also wholeheartedly approves.  Score!  This will definitely be one of our top picks for family meals out, from now on.  The trio of hummus appetizer...oh my gosh, SO good!  Maybe I was overly hungry when we got there, but I swear the cilantro hummus was close to the most delicious thing I've ever tasted in my life.  When asked which type of pita bread we wanted with it, I originally said whole wheat, but was grateful to our server for informing me that only the regular pita is vegan.  Whole wheat pita is not.  For my entree, I opted for the portabella burger without bun, which was outstanding and plenty filling.  My husband ordered a wood fired chicken pizza and really liked it but wasn't able to finish the entire thing...he's a big eater, too, so it must have been substantial.  My daughter ordered a chicken wrap and that thing was enormous.  She loved her meal, as well.  We all ate way too much and left with uncomfortably full bellies, but it was because everything was so darn good!  We agreed that this meal was one of the better ones we've had recently.    I also want to mention that the staff here impressed me a lot.  Everyone, from the greeters to the bussers to the servers, were so warm and friendly and attentive.  Our server checked in on us often and he was just so NICE!!  Not in the overly-familiar kind of way some servers are when you can tell they're just working it for a good tip.  This guy was such a genuinely nice person and had the perfect manner of stopping by frequently, making sure we were happy and had everything we needed, without being intrusive.  The service here made for a very pleasant dining experience.  We will be back, no doubt about it."}
{"text":"Came here for my first Pita Jungle experience and was so pleasantly surprised, the meal was delicious.  A friend and I stopped in for lunch, luckily we made it just before the rush.  We were seated right away and everything was great.  I can't honestly rave about the service here, like I did for the other location in Glendale (where I went with my family a few days after this visit), because it was just alright.  Not bad, just not exceptional.  The server didn't seem to know which menu items were vegan, and actually told me that the portabella burger entree was...I found out later (after looking up the menu online) that it is *not* vegan because of the bun.  I wondered because after eating the burger, bun and all, I didn't feel very good.  So although it was very tasty and I enjoyed it while I ate, I was kind of sorry later.  Lesson learned.  Next time I will consult the online menu chart.  But all in all, it was a great meal and at a very reasonable price."}
{"text":"Americanized Mediterranean food... and delicious!!!! So healthy, too. I've been going to PJ for over 10 years and have tried almost everything on the menu but love the jalapeno hummos, chicken shwarma lavosh wrap, the honey mustard chicken pizza...   The servers are kindda strange... they're mostly hippies or grungy people with a bit of an attitude but always professional and polite! Still, they coooould appear a little neater but I guess this has become part of the PJ experience. The one on Apache is where I have frequented most but the one off Ray Rd is right on the water so it's a nice place to sit out on the evenings or for a late lunch!  Service is usually quick and everything is tasty.. I haven't had a bad experience at this place :-)"}
{"text":"Love everything food wise & good vibe. It's great to sit outside when it's not too hot!"}
{"text":"You know a restaurant is good when people flock to it despite light rail construction and its screamingly awkward location amongst Planned Parenthood, a tattoo parlor, a bartender school and Filiberto's. The rent must be wicked cheap.  I love the hummus here; both the plain and roasted red pepper are so good. It is the smoothest and most flavorful I've ever had. The Greek salad is good and the pitas are always warm and fresh. I hate a dry pita. Oh, and their passion fruit tea is great.  The chicken shwarma (sp?) pita is my favorite, coming in at a mere $6. They use the same chicken for the pitas as they do the hummus and chicken and chicken on salads. It's \"roasted\" or something that sounds fancy and appealing. Regardless, it's amazingly juicy and flavorful. Did I just say flavorful again? Indeed.  Since I'm a carnivore, I wish they had an actual gyro on the menu or some other meats besides chicken and fish. I respect their green-ness, so I'll just continue to get my chicken pita.  Parking is a nightmare at lunch, which is the only time I seem to go. With only 30 spots for the aforementioned businesses, the shopping strip can get crazy. Go before noon to secure a position."}
{"text":"what a disappointment.  I've been eating here since they opened and it's always been fresh and yummy.  This time was not.  I ordered take out last night of a Lavosh pizza and a broiled chicken pita.  I literally had to pull rotten lettuce off the pita.  And the lavosh pizza had so much arugula on it that it looked like a salad on crust.  I had to pick off.  Even if you look at the pic on the menu of the lavosh pizza, u don't see the arugula.  Total overkill.  I'll probably go back but definitely will be letting them know.  Oh, and hardly any feta, I had to add more."}
{"text":"Love this place! The food is always really good and HEALTHY! Prices are reasonable and service is never bad! Will def be back to this place if I visit AZ."}
{"text":"We love coming every so often to this little place. I love getting the chicken del sol. My wife is a little boring and just gets a pita sandwich thingy every time but I branch out. The servers are always dressed like the local college kids and you can't really tell if they work there or are just a random stranger asking you what kind of food you want. They dont write down your order, which sometimes you think they wont remember. Miraculously the food appears so I guess they have a good memory and aren't just another patron.   My knock is the grape wraps weren't as good as other places and it took FOREVER for someone to come greet us when we sat down. Now I'm not just trying to be an impatient customer like, \"hey you should be right there within a half of a second of me sitting my chubby arse down.\" It took a bit over 5 min for us to be greeted after we sat. Nonetheless, the waitress was friendly and honest about the food. I love when the staff doesn't BS me about the food and just point at the most expensive thing on the menu. She turned her nose toward an item I asked and guided me to her favorite which was one of the cheaper items. I took her up on the selection and it was great, other than the grape wrap thing. I'd recommend coming here and testing it out."}
{"text":"Hummus had mold in it. I told the server, and he just asked if I wanted more of the moldy hummus :( The dolmas had no flavor. Tasted like they were soaked in water. So disgusting! The tahini roasted cauliflower was alright but bland.   Though we did have some menu highlights, fresh tabouli and Tzaiki sauce, the food was not fresh and the kids running the restaurant do the bare minimum to \"make it right\". I doubt they actually make anything in house here. On top of this, the parking lot is a bit of a nightmare to navigate. Needless to say, too many good restaurants to come back to this yucky one. Will definitely pass in the future.   P.S.- Bettina, not sure how to message you through the  Yelp app, but it was definitely not cilantro. It was an overwhelming musty flavor in the hummus that can't be mistaken for anything other than mold.   I told the waiter thinking it was the pita originally. He offerefmd to get me more of the same kind, but I declined. He confirmed that none of the pita was made in-house, but offered to get me some of the other kind of pita instead (without the pocket), so I obliged. When I dipped it into the hummus, and it still tasted like mildew/must, according to both me and my mother, we deducted that it had to be the hummus that was the mold culprit.    I was just there 12/18 at about 1 pm, and we sat on the patio. My waiter was about 5'4, male, dark hair, thin build, kinda hipster looking. Hope you can look into this so it doesn't happen again. This experience was truely gross."}
{"text":"I really don't want to be the person to give the three star review, and I have a hunch that my not-so-great experience was due to the time of day I visited.   My boyfriend suggested this place as a tandem destination because it is open until 10pm, and it has a full bar. He had previous experience with the restaurant so I agreed, and we took off on our bicycle made for two.   We rolled up (literally) at around 9:15pm and the place was dead. Probably not a good thing since we were both a little sauced already. The hostess and the waiter were both really friendly and extremely helpful.   We started out with a beer. The selection was pretty good because they had much more than the typical Bud Light, Miller Lite, Michelob Ultra fare.   My boy ordered the Glazed-Chicken Lavosh Pizza and I got the plain old Lavosh Pizza. His was delicious, but mine was certainly lacking. I expected roasted tomatoes, but there were whole slices on ever piece of lavosh. The bottom was also burnt, and the whole thing was pretty unappetizing.   I ordered the baklava as well, and that was very good. They drizzled some sort of carmel-like sauce all over it which I have never seen before. It was a great addition to one of my favorite desserts!"}
{"text":"My husband and I ate there tonight. It's been about a year since we ate there because the last time we did I was throwing up all night and ended up in the ER. I'm really not sure what it is but tonight my husband has not left the bathroom and I am very nauseous AGAIN.  Most disappointed because the food is very healthy. Since we eat a Vegan diet, there aren't too many places we have found to eat out.  I do think things were a bit over garlic'ed, okay forget the \"a bit\" WAY TOO MUCH GARLIC.  I have to say, it ruined our date night, and no price is worth what I'm paying. Won't be back!"}
{"text":"Have eaten here twice in the past week love the grilled veggie salad love the lovosh pizza  service is always wonderful"}
{"text":"i absolutely LOVE this place! the staff is always so chill and laid back. amazing customer service and AMAZING food! i've had the mahi & pita chips, almost every single appetizer lol, the pizza, falafel, umm.. can't remember what else! next on my list is the black bean burger. this place reminds me of bein back in seattle. the vibe is on point and the people are rad! i'll keep comin back for sure"}
{"text":"Thanks for serving me rotten artichoke.  Thanks for not chomping the meal.  This place is either great or horrible.  It could possibly be most inconsistent restaurant I have ever gone too.  The manager comes over and apologies but doesn't comp the meal. And doesnt assure me it will never happen again.  I believe he said I checked and didnt see any more rotten ones.  No kidding they are not all rotten.  Rotate your food to ensure its always fresh.  Restarant 101. Obviously I have to continue to expext more of the same."}
{"text":"First time to Pita Jungle... we loved it! it was late, and it was packed! But where there is great food, you should always find a crowd. The portions were enormous, even the appetizers which makes it great to share with a small group...the atmosphere was a lot cooler than i expected being from out of town. The artwork on the walls really caught my eye and gave me a lot to look at-which made the time fly while waiting on our order, which was perfect timing.. didn't take long at all. The pricing was great, and the selections on the menu made it so hard to decide what to get, but everyone one was extremely satisfied with their meals. Wait staff was quick and friendly. Wish we had one of these at home - definitely leaves you full, and not guilty since you are eating pretty healthy here."}
{"text":"Tried a gyro with a pickle in it for the first time. Dislike.  I usually like a variety of flavor in my gyros but with the pickle in it, a big one at that, it really dominated the taste. That's honestly mainly all i tasted was the pickle and some sour cream.  My server recommended the garlic potatoes. They weren't really garlicky at all. It was just really oily and bland, something I wasn't expecting. Honestly I feel like this restaurant is a product of it being over hyped by the masses. Kind of like how everything is apparently amazing in California.. but in reality its not. I'm glad i tried this place but if I was really craving Mediterranean I'll probably take my taste buds elsewhere."}
{"text":"I had a less than stellar experience in the past, but maybe it was a one time thing.  The food is good, service is okay.  When I'm in the area, it's a great choice, if I can find parking! It can be tricky as spaces are limited for all the congestion at peak times.  I recommend the hummus, iced tea, and blue corn nachos with chicken."}
{"text":"I must be hitting the jackpot lately on dining at less busy times!  I can't think about anything not to rave about!  First, let me say I immediately noticed a difference in the atmosphere from this location to desert ridge. I liked it, definitely felt like we were \"downtown\".  I came with the bf and his buddy, and we all gawked at the HUGE mirror on the wall with very unique knicknacks framing this monstrosity.  The \"executive\" seats were also a nice plus and a step up from aforementioned location. We also stared at the hugely inviting booths that were sadly all occupied, but luckily our seats were nice and comfy anyway.  We got the hummus as an appetizer of course, with chicken. Mmm Mmm Mmm mmm! The 3 pitas brought weren't quite enough and they do charge for extra, but its $0.39, nothing to squawk about. The hummus plate is so large and generous, and it could not be left to waste. I don't know what the chicken is marinated in, but I would like to learn, and replicate it at my house!   Friend got the spicy chicken wrap and coconut curry soup. The soup was in quite a big bowl but I was focused on the hummus and did not try it. I did try the spicy chicken, and it had a nice flavor to it. The wrap is gigantic btw. My bf got the wood fired chicken special, and it was also humongous. Huge portion of chicken breast over broccoli(came with spinach but he subbed, n/c) and garlic smashed potatoes with enough tomatoes to feed an army. Okay maybe not an army, but plenty of extra for me!!! Those tomatoes were so tasty, almost like bruschetta. I want to go back again soon and find those tomatoes in another dish, I hope!  Then there was one of the best pizzas I've had in my life. I was feeling incredibly indecisive today, but this pesto pizza called out to me, and I added chicken (for $1.79). Holy Mother World of Flavors! Even my bf said my dish was the best at the table.  This delicious pita pizza was packed! Pesto, feta, spinach, mushroom, tomato, chicken, topped with melted mozzarella.  Again, I consider myself a completely stuck up pizza snob, and I would not have changed a thing about this!  Good service too, but to be honest, I like the food so much this is one place I would still go back even if the service wasn't good!"}
{"text":"I love Pita Jungle and I have been to multiple different locations around the valley and this definitely has to be my least favorite.. the customer service is horrible! I have been in when it has been super slow and when it's been super busy and the service still is horrible both times.. multiple times it's almost like you have to get up and get your own refill. If not you'll be waiting for 20 minutes.. my most recent visit was today and there is only 4 tables with no more than 2 people at them and all the workers are like huddled up at the table on their phones, our server in particular had his girlfriend there and was like snuggled next to her watching videos on their phone then I get my food served with stale pita bread.... I would have to agree with other people that the quality of food has gone down, I wish I wasn't so disappointed with the customer service always being so bad because it's so conveniently located to my job."}
{"text":"Never grocery shop on an empty stomach, or when you're about to pass out.  So I stopped at Pita Jungle before leaving the mall.  I ordered a shawarma pita (chicken, greens, tomatoes, onions, pickles, garlic sauce, and tahini).  The thing was huge.  While that's normally a good thing, I didn't love it enough to want that much of it.  But I have some sort of eating disorder that prevents me from leaving food on my plate, so I stuffed it down anyway.  The pita bread was a disappointment.  It was too chewy and dry.  Not the soft, doughy pita I prefer.  The filling was okay, although I'm not sure the pickles were a good idea.  Pita Jungle is not a bad option given the choices in the food court here, especially if you don't want to stand 5-people deep at Paradise Bakery, but certainly not a destination for me.    And just for the record, don't shop after lunch either.  You'll find you need something sweet.  Hence the giant cupcake in my cart."}
{"text":"Pita jungle is great! The food is always fresh and delicious.  We have been there for lunch, dinner and happy hour. Whenever we have out of town guests, we make sure to take them to one of the locations. Our best experience was at the Shea location with Josh, who was our waiter at happy hour on two occasions. He truly makes sure we are happy with everything!"}
{"text":"Awesome.  Chicken pasta salad, cheese and fruit plate, or Mediterranean platter...can't go wrong.  Good wines, exceptional service, a cool vibe, and really kid friendly."}
{"text":"This place is always consistent. I love the spin on some med. dishes. Some of my personal favorites are chicken with hummus as a meal. Get half red half green hummus.  You can't go wrong with the chicken shawarma, philly cheese steak or lavosh.  Delicious and laid back. This location had live music on a Thursday night. Pretty nice addition"}
{"text":"We love, love Pita Jungle. My husband and I took our out of town guest for dinner and they wanted to go back the next night for more. They have a great menu. Everything is fresh and delish! If you have kids they have the greatest kid menu. If you have never tried it, get going it's the best!"}
{"text":"Delicious every time, they have a great variety of amazing food which you can tell by how packed they are almost every day of the week! I would definitely recommend their chicken Masala, red Quinoa salad and salmon dinner."}
{"text":"I've been eating at this Pita Jungle since 2003 and easily 10+ meals a year ever since without an issue once.  I wish all places were this consistent in regard to service and food.  Definitely a go-to place.  Only wish I had -- I miss the ambiance of the original Pita Jungle from the 90's when it was a 4-table hole-in-the-wall on University where you knew all the staffs and chefs names.  Long before liquor licenses, expansions, fancy kitchens and more.  Good simple food created by people who loved what they did."}
{"text":"Amazing chicken pasta meal. I forget the name but it's amazing it has a Zesty dressing with lime and juicy chicken and hefty pasta. Delicious!!"}
{"text":"Last night was my 2nd visit back to this place and I left oh-so-happy about it! I often got this confused with Pita Pit, but the two restaurants are very different. This one you sit down and are served. Both times I went on a Friday night after a movie and it was a little crowded. There may be waiting if there are more than 2 of you, but it's not a long wait if you do. The first time our waitress was good. Last night, the waiter was okay. I'm too busy eating and enjoying the food to really let that part bother me too much. Around 6-7pm last night, it was nice to sit outside on the patio since the sun had already gone down, but if you go earlier, there is shading over the patio.  The cilantro jalepeno hummus is \"Ah-mazing!\" Don't worry about it being too spicy, because it's just the right amount of spice that balances the cilantro flavor.   The pesto pizza is delicious! We added chicken though which made it more filling!   As other reviewers had said, it feels like everything is so fresh and you don't feel overwhelmed with gluttony once you are done. With the exception of the falafel, not many things are deep fried. Most foods here are grilled or baked. All of the meats and some veggies are marinated, so everything you order is full of flavor."}
{"text":"Is it just me or is this place getting worse and worse? From the service to the food Pita Jungle is slipping! I appreciate the vegan options and how it is clearly defined on their website but I would make hummus better at home."}
{"text":"Hey vegans, they've got a menu guide just for you (ask for it), showing exactly what dishes are vegan and which are not. They'll also happily substitute ingredients in and out of any dish to make them vegan for you.   I recommend: the potato garlic dip, the hummus (get the regular pitas, the greek ones have dairy in them), thousand beans, the macro platter and there are a few more good ones as well."}
{"text":"I have waited about 8 months for this 'coming soon' place to be 'now open' and I honestly think it was worth the wait.  Went on opening night, and it was great. I never went to a sit down Pita Jungle, so the slow service seemed liked an eternity. I will attribute that to the new staff getting the hang of things.  I'm vegan so I was very happy that they gave a list of what was and wasn't safe to eat, and WHY! That was the best part; you could change the meal to be vegan/vegetarian.   Went today again and liked it even more than the first time.  A good drink ran Rada about 5 bucks, and The hummus sample plate was a buck and additional pita was not even 50 cents more. Amazing.  I like hummus.  You can get veggies with it instead of pita if that's not your thing.  If you're looking for beef and pork though...keep going. The only beef you'll see is in the Gyros. Burgers are veg. :D I am very happy to have this place just walking distance from my fab flat!! Thanks for finally opening!!!!!"}
{"text":"I agree with other reviewers that this location is more of an \"upscale\" environment than other pita jungle locations. It is definitely beautiful and I would really like to eat in their outside area someday soon. Both times I have been to this location were for takeout so I can't speak much for the wait staff but the people running the takeout door, yeah a whole separate door for takeout -  a really nice touch, have been pleasant and helpful. The last time I ordered I went I ordered an iced chai tea to go. My to-go cup was much smaller at this location than I have had in the past at other locations. Hope that isn't how it is going to be from now on because I will probably stop ordering them. Also, I asked for almond milk. Just soy or cow milk. That's a bit of a bummer. But the food was good as always!"}
{"text":"This place has issues.  I'm not going to visit here anymore.  I ordered the hummus  n grilled chicken with double chicken to go since their service is horrible and the staff really looks ungroomed.  It was $15 bucks n the food was ice cold so I warmed it up when I got home.  I believe in 2ns chances but its always something so I will make my own.  Sorry honest review"}
{"text":"Just arrived from Pita Jungle on 44th and Indian School. As I waited to give my order I had the feeling that I should be running for the hills. First off in a city where salutations are as commonplace as dust I don't think I even heard a faint hello from all four employees hanging out no more than 2 feet from the front door (2 of them were hostesses) - something told me Papa Bear was not here to mind the roost.  As if the service wasn't already a telltale sign, I went ahead and ordered what I thought would be a semblance of a good pita sandwich. However, I should've known when the guy that brought over my bagged food handed it to me as if it were the remnants (read: crap) from his pooch in the bag.   Sorry--grew up in NYC have been eating pitas, et. al since I was a wee one, This was awful. I purposely do not own a microwave to avoid the temptation of ever putting my bread in there, and here I was PAYING for chewy bread, awfully cooked chicken and bland sauce.   Sorry Pita Jungle, but maybe a good heart to heart staff meeting may deem necessary--re-evaluate the customer and act accordingly---Hint: starts with \"human\"!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places here in AZ.... food is excellent,  consistently. It's odd in a way because every time I have been here I feel like it should be in SF not in Phoenix. From the vibe, the decor to the music...  love it. Keep up the good work....when we are  back in AZ we will come again. Oh and Jenna was wonderful, incredible, the best!!!.....even if she did pressure me into adding HER to the review.  All kidding aside....place is great."}
{"text":"Was seated rather quickly. Asked for a high chair for my little one and they said ok, then forgot. Couldn't find anyone to help so had to just go get it myself. They provided us a nice kids menu and coloring pages with crayons. Ordering and receiving food was normal. Server refilled all drinks relatively timely. There was just nothing special about this experience. The food was good and the atmosphere on par with expectations. The staff could be more organized and friendly."}
{"text":"Went back...it was better then the first time...but the service was not what it could be...Oh well, the food was good. Need to work on the service they need to get wristbands or something..never know who my waiter is half the time."}
{"text":"8/2017: love the PJ! This location is okay. The chicken pasta salad was a little short on the pasta, but it was okay. Jalape√±o hummus is our fav! You can't go wrong with the good food, decent prices,  healthy options & Friendly service! We have been going to PJ since the mid 90's in Tempe...we live in Cali where we have one PJ in Newport Beach. We miss this place!"}
{"text":"Love pita jungle The food is really good, healthy choices Great location for me as I live close by Service is inconsistent, had a server one night who seemed really out of it and our food took forever.  Most other times though the servers have been great and even ask and bring you a to go drink before you leave This place helps me keep on track with my nutrition if I'm going to eat out"}
{"text":"I love pita jungle but I HATE this location. The staff (with the exception of the sweet hostess) is rude and extremely inattentive. They take forever! The last time we went there I called ahead to be sure I could bring my dog and eat out on the patio I was told we could by the hostess but when we got there we were told we couldn't have our dog on the patio because they didn't have a dog license. So irritating! The manager said that because we were told we could have the dog we could do it. This was so embarrassing...everyone was staring. So we sit outside and no one comes over...for 15 minutes...so we left and went to Taco Bell (lol). The last time we were there they were super slow too. Ugh, that place is so below standard. I'll just drive to the Apache original-they have never let me down."}
{"text":"There is no beating PJ in terms of delicious, healthy and customizable Mediterranean food!  I recently switched to vegan and PJ is super accommodating and flexible with making pretty much anything vegan.  You can sub in tofu for the meat and they'll let you know what breads have milk products or honey and what you can substitute.  Not to mention they have the best cilantro jalapeno hummus in town. (psst, they have a chipotle hummus too!)  I hear this place was a madhouse when it first opened, and it does have a great lunch crowd, but the 2 times I've gone and sat for lunch recently have been immediately seated and out in an hour.  This location caters and now has delivery for catering too!  Can't say enough good things about this place.  =)"}
{"text":"Ah I love Pita Jungle. Please come to Santa Barbara. I have never ordered anything I didn't like. The Veggie Burger is so delicious, also the honey pasta salad. I always get their iced tea and an order of the hummus, I get the two flavored ones side by side."}
{"text":"Well, I stood at the bar for 15min with a menu in my hand wanting to order carry out but though the bartender came my way several times, once even completing a carry out order for a guy standing right next to me, I was never acknowledged.  At one point, a woman who also wanted carry out who came in after me, went and sat at the bar & was promptly greeted.  This is where my patience ran out an I walked out.  SUDDENLY, a guy who must have been a manager came out of the restaurant asking if I was there for carry out to which I responded \"I wanted to order but I'm over it now.\"  He politely offered to take my order himself which I appreciated but he HAD to have seen me to know that I was leaving without being helped and after I'm halfway to the car is too late..."}
{"text":"Love love love this place. Great food, excellent wines and appetizers, too. Prices are very good. Sometimes we see a lot of people waiting, but it seems we've never waited more than a couple of minutes.   The wait staff are knowledgeable and helpful at offering suggestions. We've eaten just about everything they have on the menu and have never been disappointed. We think they have the best hummus EVER."}
{"text":"First time at Pita Jungle, was presently surprised that they had beer.   Had a Blue Moon and a Cheese Steak Pita and helped myself to me wives jalape√±o humus. Awesome food, best humus I have had"}
{"text":"I've come to Pita Jungle Norterra many times and just love it like no other. I have yet to Yelp about it so here I am. Tonight we experienced yet another amazing night of dining over $3 wines and a variety of delicious meals. Our waitress, Liz, was not only very friendly, but also very attentive. The food was lovely, the atmosphere perfect as usual, and the staff warm and caring. Can't wait for our next venture to the jungle."}
{"text":"Don't bother stopping in when your in the area with your pet- supposedly their misters are broken. Not sure why that problem wouldn't be taken care of before summer? Service was great, but I honestly prefer the location in Chandler. The happy hour tapas were not only cheap but surely surpassed the entree I ordered. Also, $2.99 margarita is too good to be true. Order a beer instead to reduce human error? I'm giving 3 stars only because I'm a loyal fan & whenever I can swing by somewhere with my pup is a good time in my eyes."}
{"text":"There's a pita Jungle by my office in Mesa on Southern that is better, I'd say, as is the one on 40th str and Indian School. I always get a trio of hummus, usually roasted red pepper, cilantro jalapeno, and garlic dip (sometimes baba ganoush). Their garlic dip at the Desert Ridge location is a little less garlicky than it should be and the cilantro jalapeno hummus isn't spicy at all (I've found the Ray Rd location has the spiciest!) I had the tropical tuna salad, and the dressing was delish! Tuna was cooked well (\"seared\" as they say). The bf had the black bean burger, which he loved, though I thought the burger itself was a bit wet, in a water-y, not a sauce-y kind of way...  The roasted Red pepper hummus was very good though, better than I remember. The margarita was not half bad, and only $1.99, (also house wines, and draft beers) which I don't remember their drinks being that cheap.  Fortunately, I'm not at DR very often."}
{"text":"SHORT AND SWEET! I REALLY LIKE THIS PLACE.  Great food, and very Healthy. I eat here 2 days a week."}
{"text":"Solid 4 stars, the food is always consistent and service has always been good as well. One of my favorite things about Pita Jungle is that the servers don't look at you like you have 3 heads when you make changes to the menu options"}
{"text":"First time here, my sis always tells me how amazing this place is! We had the jalape√±o and cilantro hummus with chicken and a side of pita bread. AMAZING. Service was great and quick! Wish they had a place this good in California!"}
{"text":"I've come full circle with Pita Jungle, having lunched there often  when it was a single restaurant near ASU where I was a student. Now, it's moved in a few blocks from my home and office in downtown Phoenix, in addition to locations throughout the state. So yes, it's a chain, but I forgive its chain status because it's a local chain with local origins.  This new location is just what downtown needed, and a good move for the restaurant too. The space is huge, and fills up the Gold Spot corner beautifully, right next to the charming Lola Coffee. The food is what I've always liked about Pita Jungle: Mediterranean style with creative diversions, a lot of healthy fare, hummus, baba ganoush, all that good stuff. This time I spotted a new entree that caught my attention: chicken tikka masala. Nothing wrong with that, as chik-tik is actually an invention of British-Indian restaurants, and not an authentic \"Indian\" meal per se. So I tried it. It was nothing like typical Indian restaurant chik-tik, not quite as greasy, but still flavor-packed, and tasty. I'd get it again.   I'll be back often for lunch."}
{"text":"I don't think I know a single person who hasn't been to Pita Jungle, a health-focused, Greek-influenced restaurant with more than 10 locations in the Valley. It's wonderful for vegans and vegetarians because there are so many animal product-free menu items, and so many meatlovers I've gone with have been crazy about meat-free items, too.  I get something different just about every time I go there, and usually end up ordering a feast that requires to-go boxes at the end of the meal. One thing never changes-I always order their iced soy cappucinos, which are so sweet and tasty on their own, no additional sugar is required.  When I went to the north Scottsdale location, my pal and I asked for a bunch of different things to sample, and everything was so delicious.  For starters, we had the cilantro jalapeno hummus ($5.79). All of their hummus types are great (there's original and red pepper, too), but this is my favorite because it's so flavorful. It has a little kick to it that diners sensitive to heat will be able to handle, and the cilantro makes it extra flavorful.  I also ordered a cup of red lentil soup, which was on special. Now, keep in mind, this was a cup-I couldn't believe how generous the portion was.  I sort of wish the soup hadn't been as mushy as it was-when I eat lentil soup, I like whole lentils in the broth. But despite the texture, the flavor was so good, I ate it all. It also came with a tasty pita chip to dip in the soup.  I told my pal she had to get the garlic smashed potatoes ($3.99), which have always been a favorite of mine. I love that they have the skins in, and they're not too creamy, which I love.  She also got a chicken tikka dish, which she said was great. I didn't taste it,  but it sure looked pretty.  I ordered another special for my meal, a spinach and cheese quesadilla. It's made with a flatbread instead of the traditional tortilla, which makes it really crispy. Not my favorite type of quesadilla because I'd prefer a tortilla, but it was loaded with veggies and seemed much healthier than just a plain cheese one.  I paired it with a special appetizer, fried cauliflower. I'm not a huge fan of the vegetable, but just like the radishes at Caffe Boa, I thought it would be interesting to try, and it was. It was in an interesting spicy sauce and was very filling for just being veggies.  The meal left us super-full, and I got two days worth of leftovers when it was all done. There are tons of daily specials to choose from, and the regular menu is huge, so if you're one of the few people who's never been to a Pita Jungle, head there now."}
{"text":"Food is unreal - service is good 2!"}
{"text":"Gross and seriously?!? I love pita jungle, I have eaten here for years and especially at least monthly at this particular location. This week we had the worst experience and not sure will be going back now. We found a long piece of black hair snug in our food right when it was brought to us, we brought it to the attention of our waitress who took it back and then YES charged us for it. Seriously?!? Hair in the food and charged for it? So disappointing."}
{"text":"I really love pita jungle, they have tons of health options and everything is fresh. They have numerous, convenient locations around the valley so you're always likely to be near one. Skip the fast food and head here instead."}
{"text":"I tried this spot while in town from California:  Good food Good service  Great vegetarian options Great drinks Did not have to wait to be seated Fast and friendly service"}
{"text":"I have a serious crush on all Pita Jungles. They serve me absolutely delicious hummus and let's be honest, I could probably finish off the entire serving by myself. Oh wait, I have! The hummus and chicken platter is one of my all-time favorites. However, it's not the healthiest, so most times I try to go with the Broiled Chicken Salad or one of the broiled chicken pitas. However, on a fat kid day, I love the Philly Cheesesteak Pita or the Chicken Cheesesteak pita. I also enjoy the Chicken Lavosh without the garlic sauce and hummus as a substitute (see? More hummus. I'm obsessed). Just recently, I ordered the Mediterranean Chicken Salad (trying to be healthy) and holy salad Batman. This salad could quite easily feed a family of four. I got through about 1/10 of the salad before getting full and it looked like I hadn't even started eating it. The salad also has enough flavor on its own that it doesn't even need the dressing. If I were to order that salad again, I would share it and add an order of hummus on the side.   I like this location because it's convenient and a relatively healthy (and quick) option while on the go at the mall. I can run in and grab something to go or I can take a break from shopping and eat in the food court. I was very happy when they opened this location years ago and I definitely hope they stick around forever!"}
{"text":"This Pita Jungle does an excellent job with takeout. I can call ahead, order my food and within ten minutes, the food will be waiting for me in the front. I also enjoy the reading material waiting for me should I decide to walk in and order it instead. So I am adding this to my list of favorites for take out that gets me in and out!"}
{"text":"I always eat here! Such amazing food & great prices. The service is always prompt & friendly I recently had an error made to my order which Never happens & I wasn't able to eat the food. Unfortunately I was too far away to have the mistake reversed so the manager Immediately took care of my bill.  Such great customer service!"}
{"text":"Always have been a fan of Pita Jungle since 2006. I recently revisited on my trip back and I have to say I am still very impressed!!! Their Lentil Fetoosh salad is great! However, their Caribbean Salad is a must have, especially during these summer months!"}
{"text":"Usually a favorite choice.  I took 7 ladies with me after movie.  Service was very slow.  2 ladies were informed there was no shrimp 12 minutes after ordering and our orders were being delivered.  1 guest got her tapas pizza after most had finished their meal.  She reordered after shrimp info. The tapas pizza shouldn't take too long.   I poured refills on teas and waters as servers did not.  One came to the table while I was pouring and didn't offer to finish pouring remainder glasses.  There was an error on one of the checks, it was adjusted. We paid bills and sat at table chatting.  There were many empty tables Monday 4:30.   I did speak to manager on our way out, he had reasons for poor service  and offered a comp appetizer next visit. How will that be documented? Most managers give you a business card with item written. I will not ask for free app.  Food was fine.  Lots of dining choices in the area.  Won't rush back.   Best part of meal, a former student is now working in the kitchen.  Thrilled to see him grown up.  3 ladies at the table had been his teacher in elementary school."}
{"text":"Met my wife for lunch here one workday. I'm a fan of Pita Jungle so I figured it was a safe bet. It was pretty busy but we got right in. My favorite thing at PJ is the hummus, but for some reason the hummus at this location was disgusting. I couldn't even eat it. I let the waitress know and she removed it from our bill. All and all probably not the ideal place for lunch during the week but it's pretty standard PJ as long as you stay away from the hummus!"}
{"text":"Happy Hour is off the chain! $1, $2, $3.. yum!  Regular hours my fave is the Pesto Pizza dipped into the cilantro hummus.. Mmm good!  And the atmosphere is nice when it's not too crowded.. service is decent, some times are better than others.. but I've never had an awful experience here.  Delicious =)"}
{"text":"Love this place. Very vegan/vegetarian friendly. Hummus is all amazing. Never had food here I didn't like. Restaurant itself and bar area are super cute. Service is always good. Great happy hour. Glad to have a place like this in Norterra!"}
{"text":"The happy hour tapas are the hidden gem here...sauteed scallops, sauteed mushrooms, etc. a great value and great food."}
{"text":"Great! Great food and Carrie was super. She suggested the Spinach and Pesto Lahvosh Pizza. Perfect!"}
{"text":"Cilantro Hummus is so yummy!!!! It is the only thing I have tried here but the menu looks good. Every party I attend I bring the cilantro hummus with pitas as an appetizer."}
{"text":"Out of town traveler and found this on yelp! Will be back next time I am in Phoenix, it was GREAT!"}
{"text":"What's in a name right? I heard Pita Jungle and thought of some 2nd rate mall food court dive in the back corner.. you know the one with the guy who has the really long armpit hair. A  trusted food blogger wrote a review about this place so I HAD to give it a try.  Well to my surprise and honest delight this place didn't have one gnarly armpit to be found!! In fact this place is VERY sleek and sexy in its space.. the food super YUM-E! ((I do feel a little uncomfortable writing about food and armpits.. Im becoming far to self aware!)) The servers were all very attractive and their service very much fit the surroundings, clean, not rushed, comfortable and friendly.  When I ordered the Medchilada the server warned me.. he said he had finished one barely and that I may not be able to.. I just looked at him and said \"hello!\" with 2 hand motioning up and down the sides of my belly! With that he smiled and placed my order though I appreciated the warning. When it came it I was stunned.. he wasn't kidding.. this is THE BIGGEST thing on the menu.. HUGE! It came with the most tasty side of brown rice Ive had! There was so much chicken inside it was falling out the edges.. I sight to behold though not quite a sight when you saw me trying to eat the thing. Id like to say that I have an unhinging jaw but even this was far to thick to grab and take in. All for 10 bucks, oh yeah!   Oh yeah!!"}
{"text":"Great to have a Pita Jungle at Norterra.  I love their Happy Hour.  Never had anything that wasn't delicious.  Great vibe for families or a night with friends."}
{"text":"Can never go wrong with anything at Pita Jungle. All of the portions are quite large and perfect for sharing or taking home for a snack or dinner later.   On my recent visit I had the grilled veggie salad and it was huge! My lunch date had the broiled chicken wrap and it was huge too. On my previous visits I've had the hummus which is always a great choice (the Cilantro Jalapeno Hummus is my fav), the portabello burger was ok. A bit hard to eat. Not sure I'd have it again. The Hummus with Chicken was tasty, the Nachos are HUGE and very good. The soups are great too. Like I said, anything you get here is great and very fresh and tasty.   The inside isn't very big so tables are very close to each other while you can opt to sit outside. I usually sit outside even in the hot summer months because it is shaded and there are misters so it's actually not bad and you get full services outside.   One downside to this location is the parking like others have said. There is never enough parking for all the dining choices that are located in this shopping center. I always either try to go before noon or wait until 12:30 or a little after and I'm usually lucky on finding a spot."}
{"text":"Ordered chipotle chicken pizza.  Chicken was very dry so I basically just took it off. Husbands ordered Chicken breast with veggies, was very dry as well. At least the Restaurant was nice and clean. Disappointed with our dinner."}
{"text":"Pita Jungle is a good go to for a spot to meet friends or go on a date for some pitas and hummus!   The other food is good too, but that is what I feel their specialty is and they don't let you down.   Service is good Food is good Prices are reasonable   Worth a taste."}
{"text":"Good Hummus  Pita jungle doesn't disappoint with its tasty hummus and pita bread to snack on during a night out with friends or business lunch meeting...  Convenient locations and good service..."}
{"text":"Haily kicks ass! Sat down at the bar for the first time ever here and she was instantly attentive to us! Fast service and awesome to talk to. She was managing the patio and the bar and rocking it. Super easy to talk to a fun! Never a dull moment and never an empty drink. I would definitely come back to see Haily just wish there was more of a liquor selection. Haily rocks!"}
{"text":"By far my favorite food ever! I eat here at least twice a week I love it so much. I often order the Mediterranean Chicken Salad with blue corn chips. Everything else I've ordered is amazing too. Fresh, tasty, and awesome portion sizes."}
{"text":"The one thing I love this place is that they have such a versatile menu.  You can go with the typical Gyros, a burger, a pizza or a salad.  The gyros and Shwarma are delicious.  You cannot go wrong with the salads as well, my favorite is the chicken curry salad (curry is just the seasoning, and it is not Thai curry).  There happy hour menu is pretty good as well with drinks mostly at $3 and Tapas at $2 (they are quite small)"}
{"text":"So good! Quick service, friendly, attentive. Loved the $1 happy hour tapas hummus trio. Small but enough for my husband and I to munch on while waiting for our gyro and chicken schawarma. All in all a nice inexpensive semi-healthy quick lunch."}
{"text":"Decided to try Pita Jungle for the first time this evening, big mistake; My girlfriend and I went to the Tempe location to place a takeout order to share and were greeted by shambles of misfortune.   We went to the bar to place a to-go order with maybe 3 other people at the bar from the time we walked in to the time we left with one entree and a smoothie (easily 30 min wait). The seat I decided to sit in had the check, empty beer pint and dirty plate from the last patron, I pushed all forward closer to the bartender yet neither were cleared the entire time we were there, gross.   My girlfriend was interested in their Guava Lemonade and asked the bartender if it was good only to feel like a complete fool for asking with his response, \"uhm it's guava and lemonade.\"; Thanks buddy, we can read. The entree we ordered was the Chicken Del Sol, expecting marinated grilled chicken unfortunately it was diced, Super Dry chicken in a bath of tomato based sauce. More of a soup than an entree.   The only thing that was somewhat alright was their strawberry banana smoothie (or milkshake), which came out 10 minutes after the entree came bagged out ready to go. I don't say all of this arrogantly, we both work in the restaurant/hospitality industry and were disappointed, let alone it bring our first time there."}
{"text":"I've been a fan of Pita Jungle since my ASU days, when I lived down the street from the Apache location. Now I live in the Arcadia area so this is the one we frequent. I haven't noticed a huge difference between the two locations, same great food, same stoned servers.  My usual is the Portabello burger. The balsamic marinade they use is fantastic. The presentation is a little messy, but once it hits your lips it's so good.  I pass on the new potatoes for steamed spinach and it's pretty amazing.  Everyone knows the hummus rocks. I love how they let you split up a small order between the roasted bell pepper and jalapeno cilantro. It's like a little hummus sampler for less than $5.  The service can be spotty, especially when it comes to drink refills, but I've surprisingly never had an order come out incorrectly. I normally would not be surprised by this standard service expectation being consistently fulfilled, but I have had some BAKED servers here, so the fact that they can remember my steamed spinach substitution each and every time is kind of impressive. So, good job, stoned servers. Maybe work on the drink thing, though."}
{"text":"Ate here today.  The service here is the worst I've ever seen. It took forever to get our order taken, after that it took over 30 mins to get food.  One person in my party ordered a black bean burger and the beans were not cooked.    My other coworker also wants me to add that he had pickles In his falafel.. \"who does that?\""}
{"text":"not impressed with service or food although it looks nice inside. went in this afternoon for a takeout and the hostess couldn't answer any of my questions. she told me to go to the bar to put in a carryout order but when i was ignored she ended up taking the order herself in kind of a rude manner. i think she was on her break but someone should be covering or if she decided to do it then be friendly about it. anyway, i have never heard of putting potatoes in the garlic sauce - totally disappointed it wasn't authentic toum and their gyros are not from a spit. the side of garlic potatoes had a weird aftertaste too and we ended up throwing about 2/3 of the food right into the garbage. huge waste. oh well...lesson learned."}
{"text":"I guess we can all agree that  a) Food is awesome  and  b) Service sucks  You have been warned.  ______  Additional Note (11//4/06)  They have breakfast on the weekend that is an amazing deal! I got a huge plate of tofu, broccoli, squash, zucchini, etc. for around 6 bucks and had enough for dinner the next night! The smoothies are always banging, the menu was comprehensive enough and the breakfast in the pita was gigantic and delicious-almost would recommend to split it!  Eating outside is nice, but were too many flies when we were there."}
{"text":"Super delicious!  The hummus trio w/grilled chicken is amazing.  You could actually have it as a main course with some cucumber slices!  The chicken curry salad that they often have as a special is fantastic.  The falafel platter is excellent.  Their kids meals are well-rounded and tasty...and they provide plenty of crayons for their kids' placemats which have lots of activities to help pass the time before the food arrives.  This place is so good.  Healthy and delicious.  Go."}
{"text":"SOMETHING has changed at the Desert Ridge Pita Jungle - for the worse. We've been coming here on and off over the last 8 years and it was always fresh, healthy, and great like every other Pita Jungle has always been. But our last visit (December 2017) was practically inedible. The lettuce was brown and limp, tomatoes looked like they'ed been cut days ago, and the hummus tasted like mold.  I would have sent our food back but it wasn't just one dish - it all seemed old. I've never been served 3 different dishes that all look like they've been sitting uncovered in a fridge for the past week, and that's exactly what our food looked like. I also didn't complain to the server because the whole restaurant, though not very busy, was very dirty. And anyone could see just by looking at our plates that the lettuce was brown. So what are the chances anyone there either didn't already know or cared??  The floor was dirty and full of crumbs and straw wrappers (no one was sweeping even though there was plenty of staff not doing anything and lots of empty tables that could have been swept under without disturbing any diners). The walls are dirty from the floorboards to about 5' high. The bathroom was surprisingly ok ... it was actually cleaner than the rest of the restaurant. The menus were dirty, and the woven pleather chairs are cracking and in disrepair. Honestly I was shocked because we've always loved Pita Jungle but after I'll never eat at this location again. Just now I was looking for a place to go tonight and wondered if our last time here was a fluke - but saw all the similarly bad  recent reviews and felt I needed to let the manager know that there's more out there."}
{"text":"Love pita jungle and the variety lunch today with Co workers. Someone ordered a turkey burger and after eating half, we realized it was uncooked. Not even rare, this was plain ole raw ground turkey! Waiter was apologetic though."}
{"text":"I love this place! Everything on the menu is good, and the passion fruit ice tea is awesome! The food is on the healthy side, but doesn't taste like you are eating plants. Garlic humus is always a good starter that wont disappoint. I have been here several times and never had bad service."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with my husband.  I had a gyro and he had the lentil soup.  Both dishes were good!  Pretty big restaurant for downtown Phoenix."}
{"text":"Loved coming in last night it's nice and quiet our drinks were great , great customer service food was delicious will come back again"}
{"text":"For all you pita lovers, this is your place to go! Friendly service and a variety of food to try from Pita wraps, pizzas, salads and more. My friends love to come here and recommended the chicken pita wrap which I ordered. The wrap is big and enough to share with 2 people. I only ate half of the wrap. They don't skimp on the chicken either. The wrap came with a salad which was very fresh and perfect complement to the wrap. Next time I want to try their pizzas!   Parking: large lot"}
{"text":"As the time has gone on this place is getting worse and worse.  9 times out of 10 when I call in an order for pick up 1 or more of the orders is incorrect, today it was 3 out of the 4 orders were incorrect.  The food is never ready when they say it will be whether you schedule a pick up or come in when they tell you to.   The blonde woman with the gap in between her front teeth is absolutely the worst person to have greet and service the customers, she is incredibly rude over the phone as well as in person - today after 10 minutes of clarifying the order, I decided to double check the bags and she said to \"get out of the way so she can help others\". After calling in to speak with the Manager Nate, I have never received a call back even after numerous messages have been left. At this point myself and the company I work for will rather go to Saba's for our mediterranean food, they are always on time and never rude."}
{"text":"Dropped by Pita Jungle on a Friday night around 7:30 pm. The place was buzzing, but not overly packed or crowded. Our party of 3 was seated almost immediately and we were able to put our orders in quite quickly. Initially, I was leaning towards a lighter meal, but once we got inside the enticing aroma of good food persuaded me to get a falafel pita. We also grabbed a spanakopita for the table. The falafel pita was super delicious and as expected, extremely filling. The falafel was flavorful, crunchy without being too crispy, and well balanced against the veggies in the pita. I would definitely get this a second time! The spanakopita was also good, savory without being salty or overwhelming. Service was amazing and our server really made our overall experience great! Pita Jungle is a great place to go if you are trying to grab food with people who love going to town on meat and also those who are leaf eaters, like me."}
{"text":"we were in the mood for some vegetarian fare and two of the places we wanted to try were closed, so we remembered pita jungle!!!  it was 3pm on a sunday so noone was there. we basically had the place to ourselves, but since there were so many takeout orders for superbowl sunday, the cook service was a bit slow.   we each had one of the daily fish specials, one mahi mahi dish and one other tuna dish. the mahi mahi was ornately presented and tasted even better! with all the extra hummus, we both got quite full! each dish was about 10 bucks, so we felt well spent! good wait staff. we'll have to place pita jungle closer to the front of the memory bank!"}
{"text":"Pita Jungle is my absolute favorite Greek restaurant! Every thing that I have tried has been amazing and I usually get the same thing each time I go because its just THAT good. First off, they have the best hummus ever. I love all three flavors of their hummus but my favorite would have to be the cilantro jalapeno hummus. The number one entree that I get pretty much every time I go to Pita Jungle is the Chipotle Chicken Lavosh Pizza. All of the flavors blend so incredibly well together and it is one of the best pizzas I've ever had in my life. To end the meal they have some pretty amazing baklava that I always make sure to get. Pita Jungle is a 5 star all the way!"}
{"text":"Busy, but the server tried very hard to keep all tables happy.  Food was good as always. like the old lemonade blend better, though!"}
{"text":"Jen is our server often here and our tennis group loves her because she is always cheerful and attentive. And she also gets the orders right and the bills correct. What else can you ask?? Oh yea, the food is great too."}
{"text":"I order food here every week and it never disappoints. Best place to get healthy food that is satisfying and delicious. Never gotten a bad order nor have I ever had issues ordering for pickup. Love their pita bread and hummus!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This was my go to Mediterranean resto but tonight something was different. Seemed a bit disorganized, menus were sticky and had some wine splashed on them.  It didn't have that sparkle it usually has. Our food for two of us took nearly 30 min to get to us. And it just tasted ok. The seared ahi tuna was on the salty side  (on hummus appetizer) and the med. wrap was haphazardly put together and a little soggy. While the Taboule salad was too watered down and again haphazardly placed on the plate. The service is however excellent and very nice. When we found something unexpected in our app. They immediately changed it out for us, apologized and also took it off our bill. Just a little more TLC on the restaurant atmosphere and food structure and presentation would be give so much more high marks."}
{"text":"The food is good and you should give it a try. It is not my favorite but I went there thrice when I am in the mood for pita.   I gave them three stars because their gyro pita is really good, but the rest of the other food had too much cheese in it.   the atmosphere is cute! I like the art on the wall and the small living room for people to relax and drink their wine."}
{"text":"Ahhh, I wish I didn't have to leave a less than fabulous review for this place. I so wanted to love it, buttttt I can't.  Let's start with customer service: It was awful. The hostess seemed annoyed. Our waitress seemed annoyed. No recommendations, no smile, no checking in... to the point where we had to ask her if she was having a bad day because it was so noticeable - to which she replied, \"Nope.\" Lol, oh okay....  Next up, food: I ordered the chicken curry salad. He ordered the mediterranean chicken sandwich. What came out was a chicken salad, and grilled chicken wrapped in bread. We might have went wrong with our choices, but our food was absolutely bland and neither of us finished our plates. The tomato basil soup was awesome, though!  In conclusion, we both realized we are Middle Eastern and have probably been spoiled by Arabic spices and seasonings... and therefore, this place just didn't stand a chance. It is very healthy food, though - so, if you're not Middle Eastern, you might enjoy this place :)"}
{"text":"You've got to try their bell peper hummus!!!  I get it to go about once a week.  Also if you're on a budget, get a chicken wrap from their kids menu. Pleanty of food (comes with grilled veggies and a drink) for only 5 bucks!"}
{"text":"Not sure if we came at a bad time and ordered the wrong foods or what but this place did not live up to the hype. Hubby had the black bean burger with potato wedges, I got the wood fired chicken with mashed potatoes and tomatoes, everything on his plate and my plate tasted extremely acidic with very little flavor differentiation. I couldn't get a bite of anything to cool my stinging mouth. I would've asked for ranch dressing or some type of equivalent to cool the black bean burger if the server had ever checked back on us but she didn't. She also didn't say a word when she threw our check down on the table before we were done eating.  UPDATE: I emailed as requested below in the response from Pita Jungle and was never responded to."}
{"text":"My family came from out of town and they are hard to please because of their pickyness. But, I will say Pita Jungle isn't too bad, I just felt like I was entering in hipster territory.. But I digress, it was good food our waitress was very helpful."}
{"text":"Ordered the Mediterranean wrap asked for sauce on the side and I got the food w/ sauce on it. Waitress was very nice and offered right away to have it made properly. New wrap came out and almost finished when I picked out a piece of lettuce with a beetle type bug on it. Waitress ver apologetic but the manager not once, did he come over to apologize acknowledge the issue. Very unprofessional of him. That location has lost mine and my friends business."}
{"text":"Do not go to this pita jungle. I love pita jungle but this one does not do their food any justice. Not only is the food terrible but the service is just as bad. I ate at this pita jungle 4 times in the last couple months and each time the lettuce was old and bruised. The salads were missing at least one ingredient each time and sometimes the dressing. Finally fed up this last time I called and talked to the manager, he was about as clueless as the kitchen staff. He did not offer a new salad or any other way to fix the problems. I'm sure he was probably eager to hurry back out to smoke with the rest of the staff just outside the pick up window. Don't mind me, I love to inhale your second hand smoke as a pay 40 dollars for my overpriced wilted lettuce salad that's missing half it's ingredients."}
{"text":"Everything about this place is just \"OK\"... nothing special, nothing creative.  It was unique many, many years ago when it opened but now it is the same old, tired menu. Go to Sprouts or Whole Foods and get the same things for 30% of the cost and it take 2 seconds to make at home - or - find a better restaurant that has similar food."}
{"text":"Worse Pita Jungle ever! We waited 25 minutes and the waitress never checked up on our table, to make sure our drinks were still full...and we never got our hummus appetizer!   This is the worst experience at Pita Jungle EVER. I didn't even want to give them one star, but you have too, in order to review. We left without getting our food.   No one even stopped us when we left. My husband had to go back in to talk with the Manager about the crappy service."}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place.  We always go there when we are in Glendale.  Always consistently good.  The appetizers are super huge and can very easily substitute for a meal.  I recommend EVERYTHING on that menu.  Wait staff is Awesome!  So good!"}
{"text":"I really like this location. I first visited the Pita Jungle in Tempe but I think this one is better because it's bigger and has more of a hang out vibe. I also think the servers are more personable here, but that's totally subjective. Happy hour is great for drinks but I still prefer the full-sized food portions. I don't think you get the same amount of food during happy hour. I think the full-sized is a better deal.   When I ate meat, I loved the chicken Philly, but now that I'm vegetarian I prefer the fatoush salad. The portion is so large that I'm never able to finish. The salad is still great the next day cold or warmed up with a quick stir fry. I also always start with the potato garlic dip, it's just so delicious and simple, though I get it with cucumbers and tomatoes instead of pita. I once had the Caribbean salad when it was very hot out and it was an incredibly refreshing fruity salad. I shared it with another person and we still couldn't finish it.  This place is great for big groups, dates, and if you're flying solo you can sit at the bar and talk to their friendly bartenders or watch the tube. I like that Pita Jungle started in AZ, so I continue to support them."}
{"text":"My spot live entertainment, food was okay I just expected more. I would eat and try another entre to give them another chance I think that they can do better... I would go back and give them a try for sure. I would have gave them a three and a half if I could do it almost at 4."}
{"text":"Even when they are busy food always comes out quickly, great portion sizes.  Great place to meet up with girlfriends.  I love the patio at the Scottsdale Shea location."}
{"text":"Where do I begin! Atmosphere is cool. Drinks are \"dynomite.\" It's next door to my work. The staff is well, HOT! WOW! Oh yeah and the food isn't bad either. Really, the food is awesome. It's very healthy and they have an extensive menu and it's very affordable. My favorite is the Shawarma (Mediteranian Roasted Chicken Pita). There are several other locations. If you haven't tried one you should! Get that Whopper out yo mouth get your fat butt off the couch and get something healthy for a change!"}
{"text":"So happy to have a Pita Jungle in Ahwatukee.  Went yesterday (Tuesday) and it was very busy for a late lunch crowd. Great view of South Mountain from the patio.  We went during happy hour they have tapas for 1, 2 and 3 dollars speaking my frugal language..... the tomato mozzarella.... FRESH and tasty.  Small but perfect for starters. I normally order the fruit and cheese plate served as a meal but we order as an appetizer then I get the pita pizza perfect for kids or for someone that has devoured half a cheese and fruit platter on her own.    For my husbands birthday they let us bring in a cake ( most restaurants will not allow at all or will charge a plate  / serving fee) no singing...... they are not that kind of restaurant....  my husband would have divorced me if people came out singing and clapping happy happy birthday to our guest.    Great experience LOVE the eclectic decor."}
{"text":"I love Pita Jungle. Became hooked on it about 6 years ago.. I've never said this about any other eatery, but I can eat here every day. And that's not an exaggeration. The food is excellent.. always really flavorful. Never have had a bad meal here. Food comes out fast and is very reasonably priced. My personal favorites: -Garlic dip -Hummus trio -Any of the pizzas  -Lavosh shawarma -Berry tea -Really the entire menu  Aside from the food, the atmosphere is great. Really laid back with eclectic decor. You'll notice each location features a large mirror and rotating artwork display, which is pretty cool.   Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"Easy decision.  Hummus with grilled ahi tuna for a great (and light dinner).  Your choice of two, I'd recommend the Cilantro Jalepeno and Regular."}
{"text":"Pita Jungle has always been one of my favorite healthy choices. They have consistently created unique Southwestern Mediterranean Fusion dishes which of always invited fresh and healthy ingredients with a very modest price.  Although this location doesn't lend itself to the traditional Pita Jungle vibe its very fun and well designed. I do think the old location of Apache was much better.   I highly recommend the chicken Del Sol, any of the flatbread pizzas as well as the chicken shawarma or Gyro wrap.  Probably one of my favorite restaurants have ever been to my life."}
{"text":"Great tasting food, the place is a little noisy and a table for two inside is very small. We had to keep moving plates, S&P glasses etc around to keep them from falling to the floor. Service was slow at first, but once our waitress started, she was great. Very friendly and knowledgeable. Worth the money.  I'll go there again for sure!"}
{"text":"Great to see Pita Jungle arrive in Dana Park. This location is smaller than the other ones I've been to and can fill up quickly. We have been here a few times and have had consistently good service.   We picked up platters for a party. They were ready to go on time and the food was perfectly prepared.  The layout is interesting, a lot of the room is taken up by a waiting area and reception kiosk. It seems like more tables could have been made available inside. I like the separate take out door and counter. It seemed like the bartender was also in charge of the takeout orders. We were well taken care of and didn't wait at all.  The outdoor seating and windows are going to take a lot of direct sunlight in the summer. It will be interesting to see what they do to address the heat and keep people cool inside and out from May - October.  As far as the food, our Pita Jungle favorites are the Chicken Chipotle Lavash Pizza, Cilantro Humus and Chicken, the amazing baked Cauliflower with onion strings and sauce (don't miss this one, every time we order it people sitting nearby ask about it) and the Roasted Potatoes.  The kids meals are pretty cool. Kids get to pick from a variety of items to build their plate."}
{"text":"The new Pita Jungle freaking rocks. I haven't been to one in years, but I can see them quickly becoming a new favorite.   Ambience gets an 8.5 so far.    I'd have to spend more time in the inside and see the bathrooms to finalize it. but it was pretty kicking Monday night at 7:30 three days after their opening with a lively crowd--somewhat unusual and definitely welcome for Downtown.  Good parking right off the patio was open during my two hours there.   But we walked there, taking our seats in the patio in the back after a friendly greeting with the bartender.  The *full bar* window sits *very nicely* between the inside and patio which combined make a very un-Phoenix like setting, something I'm really fond of getting used to downtown.    Inside, I was instantly taken aback by the pleasant configuration of the cavernous interior.  I soberly staggered about, grinning idiotically.  Its a use of space that easily beats the last tenant, a fly-by-night home-foreclosure help-line.  I didn't miss the always-closed design firm that was there before either.    I admit my continued giddiness.  Outside was comfortable and quiet for the most part except for the occasional headlight glare.  We were the only ones seated on the spacious patio.  But it wasn't isolated; foot traffic from folks driving up, walking in like they weren't from the neighborhood along with folks who lived next door--all nice people--added to the pleasant urban dichotomy of entrances in front and back.  Service gets a 9.5/10.   Our position outside in view of the bar made it easy to be seen, so I can't say the same for the inside but have high expectations.    The staff should read the directions/learn how to turn the heater on instead of depending on the later arrival of the one bestowed with that knowledge.  I'm guessing enough restaurant patrons would have just gotten colder and more irritated while they waited, I'm not that kinda guy.  I chocked it up to an opening day jitter and pushed both buttons in.  The food came out wicked quick, and the super cute waitresses were friendly, patient, and otherwise on top of everything.     A phone call before we left was answered promptly and courteously.  They said they were \"not busy\", but were crowded when we walked in, suggesting they know how to deal with traffic.    Food gets an 8/10.   To start off, it was $5 for what I think was 20oz of a perfect Devil's Ale:  a fun, big glass with a handsome head...Drink me, it begged, and I happily obliged.  Served cold, it warmed me right up.  If a buck (or two? please?) were off the beer and the joint stayed open till 4 AM...it'd be a madhouse.  We can dream, but I doubt the looming apartments would enjoy that kind of big city vibe off the patio.      In the meantime, they could have had more warm drinks besides the tasty hot chocolate for the winter. Lola Coffee next door could hopefully provide some of that vibe for some real synergy if they stayed open later.  The tzatziki put me in food paralysis--a heavenly feeling I get when I first take a bite of something and it's that amazingly good all other senses shut off.  I kind of wondered at the better part of $8 for my companion's small pesto pizza with no meat but it too was a 10/10.  The beef gyro was some points lower, I seem to recall enjoying its selection of stock greens (I just killed it this morning as I write this),  but the meat was average and a bit lacking on the sauce.  Either way, they  made up for it with a hearty, filling portion that should be an easy standby for any carnivore, especially one on a budget...   ... but take the gyro by itself.   It doesn't quite work next to its $3 up-sell garlic potatoes which were mediocre in the beginning and went cold quick.  Skip 'em.   Still, the potatoes along with everything else wait in my fridge for the next day like everything else I took home.  Shouldn't be too hard to give them enough kick again in a toaster oven or microwave.  The rice pudding was served cold and average on its own (maybe that's the point?), but it was definitely enlivened with the right amount of cinnamon and half the amount of fresh fruit they put on top.  Total bill was $36 before tip. For appetizer, main course, dessert, and beverage for two in such a expletively awesome place, it's definitely worth it.   As a quick dinner to go, it's a major, major reason to not hit the local fast food joints in the late evenings too.  8.8 out of 10 for my best luck to the latest addition downtown, the newest for all of 4 days before Vitamin T opens up.    What bad economy?  I sometimes wonder. =)"}
{"text":"This is our favorite place to catch a quick bite.  The food is always fresh and the atmosphere is light. Staff are always friendly and efficient.  We seldom need to wait to be seated, and we can order, eat and be on our way within an hour almost every time. We have eaten here many times and have had no problems. I would highly recommend this establishment to my family and friends."}
{"text":"Much like Sam A. (4/12/2012) we had an incredibly disappointing experience with the food. Our server was better and more attentive, hence 2 stars instead of 1.  To start with we found the Spanakopita to be incredibly salty, like they used a tbsp instead of a tsp. My wife ordered the Broiled Chicken Pita which I have had before and is good, but this time it was a disaster. The chicken was cold and the pita was cold and stiff. It got sent back and we got a new one which was better but still not as good as the Chandler location that I have eaten at before. I ordered a spicy chicken lavosh wrap. Now I love spicy food, but besides being spicy, this had absolutely no flavor. It seemed as if the mix had been marinating for a few days killing off any flavors that the beautiful ingredients should have had. Again very disappointing.  Not sure if it is because this is a new location or a large location for them, but I have experienced much better, and the food quality was so far off their standard it makes me hesitant about ever going back. It is not complicated food so it shouldn't be that hard to get it right."}
{"text":"This place always seems to be mentioned as a good vegetarian place to eat. It's ok. Not super good but not bad."}
{"text":"Was very disappointed today, the gyro  was so soggy and the meat was dried out.. Sadness   The service was excellent. Guess an off evening.."}
{"text":"I stopped here on a whim a few weeks ago thinking it was a semi-fast food place. It wasnt! Took me nearly 10 minutes to find a parking spot due to the overwhelming popularity of this place (which is a good sign!) I walked back to the takeout counter and browsed the menu and decided on the chicken shwarma sandwich, red pepper hummus, and a kids meal for my 2 year old son (chicken, broccoli, and rice). The lady at the counter was very helpful and full of suggestions. The food only took about 7 minutes to be delivered into my hot eager hands. I was surprised at the quality, it was very fresh and VERY good! My son ate all of his lunch and so did I. My only 2 complaints were:  1.) The prices were a bit higher than I would have liked 2.) The parking, oy!   But overall it was really good food and friendly service :)"}
{"text":"I'm giving these guys the max (5 stars) because I go here at least once a week and the food is always great - at an incredibly reasonable price. The menu is very varied, and just about everything I try is good. The crowd is very different from the typical Scottsdale crowd, and the overall vibe is just right.  I tend to eat late, and it's nice to have a place that is not empty at 9pm.   They don't allow smoking on the patio which is another big plus.   Even though I gave them 5 stars, there are a couple of issues. 1) the place can be freezing inside - more so in summer, ironically - due to a/c being on way too cold. I've spoken to several waiters/waitresses, they say there is one manager there who insists on keeping the place icy cold inside, summer and winter. I always sit outside in summer, but in winter I do sometimes feel too cold.  2) there is one sub-standard waitress who has a definite 'attitude'.  This is sad because 99% of the staff are absolutely fantastic.  This one lady looks like she really feels the job is beneath her. Thank goodness I've only ever encountered her once in maybe 100 visits."}
{"text":"Okay, so I have lived i Phoenix for a year and a half and I am moving in 5 days and tonight was my first meal at Pita Jungle...can you say SLIP!?   SO SO good! My girlfriend and I started with the jalapeno hummus which was wondrous! The pita was great and light which didn't take away from the great flavor of the hummus. For my entree I went with the Mediterranean salad which was one of their specials and I LOVED it! A mix of lettuces, tomato, red onion. tabulli, roasted red peppers, pine nuts, golden raisins, and feta cheese topped with a very light lemon dressing made for an awesome dinner. As I looked around the restaurant I wondered how I could possibly make my way back to Pita Jungle before the move. Don't make the same mistake I did-get your ass to Pita Jungle stat! Your tummy will thank me later!"}
{"text":"Update: I returned to give this location another chance and had phenomenal food, my other favorite menu item the mahi mahi with cilantro hummus and pita chips. Service was fantastic. Great experience.   I LOVE Pita Jungle and go to many locations regularly. One of my favorite \"go to\" dishes is the tikka masala. Sadly, this location's tikka masala did not taste like what is made at other locations, and I have eaten that dish at at least 4 other locations. The server brought me another tikka masala without all the paprika sprinkled on it, but the whole dish was off. It did not even satisfy my want for Indian food, so I'll have to go to an Indian place tonight.  I love Pita Jungle, but this place did not deliver one of their standard dishes."}
{"text":"Granted, the ambiance at this location is completely different than any of the other locations I've been to, I think this is such a pretty space! I was especially impressed that despite all the concrete and block, it wasn't as noisy as some other Valley restaurants that share design elements.   As for the food and any menu recommendations, I like the:  Red Pepper Hummus   Gambas Con Ajo (5 shrimp, loads of garlic and tomato. Hint: the description says there's cilantro. I HATE cilantro and I like this dish.)   Spicy Chicken Wrap (packed with chicken, beans and rice -- big enough to share!)   Broiled Fish Sandwich (My fish was cooked perfectly here. There was way too much bread, though. I wound up eating most of the fish with a fork and leaving most of the bread)   Fruit & Cheese Fantasia (A hit with my family. It's huge!)   Wine List (they have great selections! I can always find something I like.)   Perhaps my least favorite thing on the menu: One Thousand Beans because it has tempted me more than once and then proved to be beyond bland -- flavorless. Blech!"}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere. Food tends to be on the healthy-side. The shawarmas and salmon are the best items on the menu."}
{"text":"Top of my list when in the mood for fresh and healthy eating. The grilled chicken hummus is addicting! Staff is nice and speedy. The lunch time is super busy so be prepared to wait."}
{"text":"The best!! I love the cilantro jalape√±o hummus with chicken! Also great options for happy hour! Healthy and great service. Love this place"}
{"text":"Pita Jungle in general gets 4 stars, this location gets 2. This location at night is packed. The tables are always so close together and they pack 3 million people in a relatively small area. Its on the border of a fire hazard. I would rather have some space and have to wait for a table, then to be packed like sardines. The loud music on the weekend is annoying. The food is phenomenal, but try the Mesa or Gilbert location."}
{"text":"I love Pita Jungle!  And this location is far better than the one on Tempe.  The food is phenomenal and there are so many choices.  I've been coming here for a few years and I've never had a bad meal or bad service.  The location is great because it's right on Bell Road and close to all the shopping centers without actually being in the mall.    I've found this is a nice restaurant to meet friends for lunch or dinner since the menu has a lot of options for the healthy-conscious, gluten free, and vegan eaters.    Regarding the food itself: delicious!  I always have a hard time deciding what to get because everything is so good!  The hummus with chicken is a must-have for an appetizer.  For entrees, the Philly Cheesesteak Gyro, and regular Gyro are always good choices.  If you've come with a hearty appetite they have different types of Mediterranean pizzas that are huge!  Seriously so big they barely fit on the plates and you will be taking home leftovers.  And then my all-time favorite - the Honey Balsamic Seared Yellowfin Tuna Salad: perfectly sweet and crisp with tons of ripe fruit tossed in.  I really can't say enough good things about their food.    On top of all that, they also have great servers who are super nice.  I've always been offered a beverage to-go when I receive my check, and have never had to flag down a waiter for anything since they check in pretty often.    If you haven't been here yet, you must try it!"}
{"text":"Great food!"}
{"text":"Used to be good.  Now they buy presliced gyro meat.  Isn't food fatty enough these days?  Nope have to make it dry and crunchy as if fried and make it extra salty.  Avoid this place.  I edited this post after contacted by owner that they didn't use a roaster or deep fry the meat.  Well the quality of food was poor.  The gyro meet was dry chewy and crunchy even."}
{"text":"Took waitress awhile to acknowledge us that we almost walked out. Pizza was not hot. Greek salad was okay. Staff didn't look clean."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere!   The portions were awesome The Price is Right the resturant was clean and the server was friendly. Loved it! !!"}
{"text":"If your into raw chewy ahi that every bit requires 15 mins to get through the Ahi tendon. (I ordered two plata of the Ahi and hummus.) then you came to right spot. Some of the worth quality Ahi I have had apart from a two day old supermarket sushi roll. Service was great.  The waiter did give me two $5.00 off coupons that I can only use on two separate occasions which means I need to give them my money two more times to save $10.00. I think the $50 I just spend for two plates of low low grade ahi was enough. Thanks but no thanks."}
{"text":"I had left a five-star rating for this specific Pita Jungle, but now need to take away a few stars. The food is still awesome, and the servers are nice, helpful, and courteous... but the location is DIRTY.   They desperately need to repaint. The walls have coloring on them, cracked paint, and what looks like food stuck to the walls. It's gross, and I avoid this location now, to go to the one in Dana Park, which is much (aesthetically/hygienically) cleaner. Don't get me wrong - the staff are awesome, the bartender is great, and I've always had amazing food here.  It's just that they definitely need to clean up the place a bit. I'd happily bump this back up to a four or five star if they do so.  They also have music on Sunday nights, usually an acoustic small band or solo artist. Nice touch to get people in -- but a repaint would work wonders."}
{"text":"I really love the food here and the service is always awesome too. Their dedicated take out counter is efficient and quick!   I usually order the falafel pita and it's amazing. This PJ usually fills it more than the PJ on Southern in Mesa. It's also a much more updated interior and is freshly painted/stylish. I've had dates here and family dinners. Both are perfect reasons to come eat.   All the staff we've ever had have been very nice and courteous! Definitely recommend, and they have good vegan options too!"}
{"text":"Horribly disappointed. Having been a regular at the downtown location this place cannot compare. Awful awful bartender. I walked out! Usually when you ask someone what they would like to drink you give them a menu first. Duh!  Then when I ask for the ASU game, don't act like its an obscure European sport that no one else would enjoy. You have ruined my Pita Jungle experience near my new home. Hopefully you don't suck in life as much as you do at your job."}
{"text":"I'm not sure I love this place as much as my wife but I do have to say it was really good food when we went the other day. Really busy when we were there but actually was kinda cool. We ended up sitting right next to @jenn_ex and her family so it was cool to chat with them and the others around us. Everyone seemed to be having a great time and we all just loved our food. My wife, Michelle said (5 times) \"I could drink this hummus\" so I suggest you order the hummus sampler appetizer. :)"}
{"text":"Always a fabulous meal! Lots of GF options!And healthy if you want.  My favorite these days is Hummus w/ Kafka w/ blue corn chips instead of pita. I get the trio of hummus (original, cilantro & red pepper). Love it! Healthy & reasonably priced!"}
{"text":"For it being fairly full, it was the fastest service I've ever had at a Pita Jungle. I liked this one."}
{"text":"My friends and I love going here for lunch. Not sure why, but it 'feels' healthy. Not sure if it is or not, but I'm very stuffed when I leave. The bell pepper hummus is awesome."}
{"text":"First time eating here last night. Started off with the hummus for an appetizer and got the gyro for my main meal. Everything was excellent.."}
{"text":"Sooo yummy!  I love eating at this place.  Service is amazing, every time we go there they get all the orders right and the food is yummmm.  I actually do not like Hummus but this restaurant changed my mind.  I can't get enough of their jalapeno hummus.  Only reason I didn't give them 5 star is due to some menus comes with only 4 pita chips but with lots of hummus.  I wish they give more unless I'm suppose to ask for more??? I'm not sure.  Still I'm going back today for Lunch...YEAHHHH!!!"}
{"text":"I want to thank this location for trying to understand the situation and make it right.  Now THAT is customer service.  I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"oh pita jungle. how do i love thee? let me count the ways...  PJ is one of the only places I can bring my parents (Hearty Midwestern Carnivores) and still eat healthy/veg. They love the art.   The food is incredible.   Whether you get a salad, combo plate or Philly Chix Pita... it all rocks. (Except the chix tikka masala special - no good)  Plus, being in the PJ atmosphere just makes you feeeeeel cool.   I witnessed a funny/classic PJ situation when a mom ordered her son decaf coffee (why? i dont know...) and they only had regular. the server poured a cup of regular, handed it to the kid and said to the mom - \"Welcome to The Jungle.\"  You have to have a sense of humor and a laid back personality to really appreciate the greatness of such a quirky, honest little joint.  Enjoy yourself!"}
{"text":"Used for catering and they always seem to be spot on. Fresh....on time....and plenty of food for everyone!"}
{"text":"When I consider the one food that I would eat, barring all others, the Jalpeno Cilantro Hummus with pita bread is the one. It has everything going for it: great flavor, protein, carbs, etc... We used to make special trips here to get this as a take out. The pita alone is worth the trip! You must try this.  Each location is always busy and loud, but the service is almost always busty and prompt. I'm not kidding, each locations has the same servers, I swear!"}
{"text":"So the five stars on this one is more about the location than anything else.  I love PJ.  I never tire of their menu as there are many options that I find tastey and sensible if you automatically box half of it to go (i.e., portions are HUGE).  What I am typically not a fan of when it comes to PJ is that they all seem cramped, making use of every square inch of floor space.  But this one...  ah. This location is airy and open; dare I say - spacious?!!  Parking can be a little snark inspiring but once you get past that and get into the actual restaurant, take a deep breath and enjoy of the wonderfullness of PJ without having to rub elbows with the people at the tables on either side of you.  ;)"}
{"text":"Tried PJ for the first time during a biz trip, will eat here upon every return. The food is fresh, healthy and delicious. The wait staff is relaxed and appropriately engaging. LOVE IT - a bright spot!"}
{"text":"Healthy, delicious, and fun!   The Mediterranean platter is amazing and you'll definitely have left overs if you try to tackle it yourself (well at least I always do!).  I'm a HUGE fan of their falafel pita sandwich and cilantro jalapeno hummus.  I like Pita Jungle because i can go in knowing i'm not eating super greasy food NOR am i tempted to get any french fries or unhealthy food.   All of their food choices adhere to the healthy living culture as best as any restaurant i've found in the west valley/glendale area.   A bit pricey for a med student's budget, but i like to treat myself to Pita Jungle every now and then.  They recently started a reverse happy hour that i've heard is phenomenal.   Try this place..you won't regret it and your body with thank you in the long run!"}
{"text":"While I don't falter often from my usual order, everything from Pita Jungle that I've had has been great. I usually get the half jalapeno/half roasted red bell pepper hummus followed by the glazed chicken lavosh. The lavosh is absolutely amazing, toasted in their wood fire oven and topped with generous portions of the honey glazed chicken and feta cheese. The half green tea/half lemonade arnold palmer is my refreshment of chioce, refreshing my taste buds and preparing them for another round of the excellent food.   The servers here are great too, but I don't mean in a white-glove waiter sort of way. These are the people that are fresh off the bong, and honestly, I'm surprised the food even makes it to the table intact. Don't get me wrong, If they were to change this I may not frequent as much. I enjoy my fare share of baked-out-of-their-mind servers, there's just less stress!    The only negative thing I can think of about this place is that the dishes are a little too expensive to make it a weekly stop and the tables are pretty crowded together. Other than that I've never seen anything to complain about.   I also love the ever-changing art from local talent! Very chill place..."}
{"text":"I absolutely love PJ. Chicken Shawarma Pita with Feta Cheese is my jam. The Lavosh is amazing too."}
{"text":"I don't know how people can say best service ever , I will rather Driver 15 min to the Tempe location , waited 10 min for a server , host took our drink order put her hand in my face when I asked to order and an appetizer and told me to wait for my server .food is delicious but not worth the HORRIBLE SERVICE!"}
{"text":"I have been to this location multiple times, and everytime it gets worse.  The staff tends to be rude, and for the most part you can't find anyone to help you.  My first visit was just me and my fiance.  We waited thirty minutes before someone even took a drink order.  Then we waited another hour before our food got there.  I had the Chicken greek salad.  The chicken was so overcooked that even my dog wouldn't eat it.  The gyro looked like rubber.  I decided to give the place  a second try.  I went there today, there were three of us.  It took thirty minutes to have a person even look at our table.  Two other tables that were seated fifteen minutes after us had food and drink already.  We had our menus closed and were looking for the staff.   Finally someone took our drink order.  Another thirty minutes later we get the wrong drinks, five minutes after that our drinks.  Our food order took almost an hour and a half.  We had a pita burrito, a chicken wrap (also overcooked), and a gyro (still rubber).  I would not recommend this place to anyone, even my worst enemy.  When we finally just asked to get our food boxed to go (still not at the table), we got attitude from the staff.  The staff is rude, inconsiderate, and they lack hygiene.  DO NOT GO HERE!! You are better off going hungry."}
{"text":"Excellent take-out and ordering. Always fast and ready at the counter within 5-10 minutes, quick counter service and out the door :) I don't like eating in much; kids etc... So I order for pick up a lot. They're just very consistant and the food is always stellar and I continue to come back time and time again.  I want to tell a story about once I forgot my wallet at home and later when driving home from the office I wanted dinner.. called ahead ordered food.. got in and realized I didn't have my wallet. I felt like an idiot. In my stupor I assumed I had to drive home and return later to grab my cold food or re-order again. There was a manager sitting close by at the end of the counter and realized what I forgot. He asked if I've been there before and I said \"yeah all the time actually\", not like he was really concerned but he ended up telling me \"don't worry about it\" and to take the food w/o paying. I made sure he was serious and I thanked him a few times and went home.  I ate... got my wallet and drove back. He wasn't around (in back somewhere) but I told the girl what I ordered and she was a little shocked that I came back. Anyways... I paid and went back home. I know $14 or so for the meal wasn't a massive hit to the biz if I never came back... but  the point is he hooked a brother up in need. It's just a cool mentality to have as a manager / biz owner and I appreciated it and I won't ever forget it.  Thanks manager guy... you've got a customer for good."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great food and service and if there ever is a problem they are quick to correct and make it right. Good people"}
{"text":"I always come here for the Spicy Chicken Wrap!  The food here is healthy, and their menu has a lot of tasty veggie dishes.  So I don't feel guilty when I come here!  The ambiance is fun, hip, and casual.  The dining room is very bright with natural light.  The floor plan is very open.    Also, there is an outdoor patio, which is great when the weather is nice.  Plus, there is a full bar with flat screen tv's to watch sports too.  The hostesses, servers, and bartenders are always smiling too!"}
{"text":"Unique and delicious! I love how it's Greek and meditarian but also has a healthy twist! Yes it's says vegetarian ... Yes they still have tons of things to chose from with meat! So good but normally busy so be warned. Service is good and uniquely does not wear uniforms."}
{"text":"Not sure what is going on with what used to be my favorite location, but I won't be returning for quite some time. The last 2 to 3 times, it has taken forever to get waited on. They are putting more lettuce and brown rice than ever into the Chicken Curry Salad, and much much less chicken. It really seems like they are under new management. The waiter we had tonight should not be a waiter. Nice guy, but he can't remember anything. I saw another table get up and ask for someone to please come wait on them. The place was not busy at all, but everything was way behind. Time for me to take a 6 month break and find another Mediterranean restaurant to give my $$ to."}
{"text":"I really really wanted to love this place. I went in today with family from out of town to celebrate my birthday. While the place is beautiful and the server was very nice, the food was not. My salad was missing items listed in your menu, and my gyro had the grossest nearly rotten tomatoes on it. The gyro meat really left something to be desired. I have never seen gyro meat that looked like meatloaf before....  But the icing on the cake was the horrible bowel problems both my mother and I had just a few hours after. We wont be back."}
{"text":"I've only had one bad experience when dining in, so I figured it was just a onetime thing. All other dine-in experiences have been alright. BUT, the times I've placed orders for pickup have been horrible. Today, I ordered a gyro with a side of the garlic new potatoes. The potatoes were burnt. The garlic couldn't even take away from how burnt they were. I know for sure they wouldn't serve those potatoes to anyone dining in the restaurant. It seems like it's always something when ordering for takeout, so I'm  just not doing it anymore."}
{"text":"Great food at amazing prices.  The food is top notch quality with tantalizing flavor.  Best hummus in town and most flavorful salads.  Yummie!"}
{"text":"My pita was stale and my dolmas were frozen. I never knew that they freeze it and heat it up before serving it. I've always thought they made it fresh. I guess the secret came out.   After this comment, a customer service reached out to me and I was able to go back to test their quality of food again. This time around, it was way much better. It was exactly what I went for. Food was amazing.    Thank you! You got your customer back."}
{"text":"Have been to many Pita Jungle locations, but I go to this one the most. I like the layout of this location the best. It is pretty open and spacious which I like. I have never had an issue with the service here, it has always been fine by me.  The food here is excellent though. My #1 favorite thing on the menu is the Lentil Fetoosh Salad. It is massive, and I love the crunchy pieces of pita throughout the salad. It is very flavorful and filling, definitely something to order if you are hungry. The hummus is excellent as well, I like to get a trio to have a little of everything. Their blue corn nachos are absolutely fantastic as well. I have also tried the falafel pita, but prefer the other things I've tried over that.  Been back many times and will be back again!"}
{"text":"Boy I hate to give them less than 5 stars, but damn this Pita Jungle is slooooow.   We decoded to come at lunch and it was busy but we were sat right away.  We all ordered super basic stuff, 2 people literally ordered hummus and chicken.  It took over 20mins just to get our food.  When you have a 1hr lunch, that's rough.  Pita Bread was cold to boot.    Can't say I will be returning to this location.   Food was good as usual though."}
{"text":"Great tasty food at reasonable prices Try the chicken Swarma  much delicious Tapas are fantastic!"}
{"text":"I ordered a salad to-go and had them add shrimp which was about $3 extra. I got home and there was only two shrimp on the salad. Great food but seriously I paid extra to get shrimp for a reason and I got screwed."}
{"text":"Fresh delicious food and generous portions. I freakin love Pita Jungle.  The roasted chicken salad = delicious. Jalape√±o cilantro hummus = divine  My son had the kids meal, you build your own.... broccoli, diced chicken, fresh fruit & macaroni, plus a drink is $4.99. Great price, and again huge portions for mostly healthy food.  We'll be back fo sho!"}
{"text":"Driving through on our way back to CA from NM and my boyfriend spotted this place while we were getting gas. I fought him every step of the way because I'm SUPER picky with Mediterranean food. Well let me tell you, this was the best! I got the Mediterranean antipasti platter and it was the absolute best I've ever had. It was fresh, quick, and delicious. Falafel and dolma were outstanding. Great drink list too!!!   I do have one negative thing to say- and I hate to be that person, cause I truly loved the casual vibe- but the hostess was dressed so inappropriately and unprofessionally that it really left a bad taste in my mouth. Totally a friendly, cute girl, but her shorts were so short I could see her butt cheeks while she was taking us to our table and her cleavage and belly button ring didn't scream professionalism either. They should seriously consider some kind of dress code, as someone who's been in the restaurant business a number of years I couldn't believe that was okay!   Other than that little rant I can't speak highly enough of this lunch. Amazing!!!!"}
{"text":"Just tried this (local?) chain on a recent trip to Phoenix when I was in the mood for Greek food. Excellent and innovative take on traditional Greek. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Love this place. The restaurant has a very welcoming vibe. Their services are pleasing. The food is great and has huge portions. I recommend the Trio Hummus Starter with Pita and the California Beach Club with Grilled Chicken. It's very healthy and the prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"Awesome job Chandler pita jungle. about a week or so ago I called in an order and arrived about 15 minutes later and they couldn't find my food. The girl said she had but then it was gone... Had to wait. Tonight I called in my order and arrived 15 minutes later and there was a couple placing an order. I then paid for my order, then a young lady placed an order. As I waited an additional 15 minutes, the couple AND the young lady were given their orders. Finally I was given my order and when I asked why I received mine after both of them I was told, \"our saute guy is really backed up.\" So I was angry at this excuse as it sounded ridiculous so I just took my order and left, figuring I would just not return to pita jungle, as this was the second time in a row your restaurant disappointed me. Then I arrived at home and when I opened my order, My sandwich was made incorrectly from how I ordered it. I called and of course the only solution to this is for ME to go back to the restaurant and have it replaced, however this was not an option since I had already spent more time than I wanted to get a quick dinner for my wife and I as we wanted to watch the Coyotes game while we ate. Based on these experiences, I will not return to Pita Jungle.  I thought I would update this review. I sent an email to the company and within 20 minutes, both the store director AND the operations director responded. It is customer service like this to show their concern that WILL bring me back to Pita Jungle in the future, especially since we really love the food."}
{"text":"Absolutely adore pita jungle.  I'm not a vegetarian but I love their food.  I get the fattoush salad which is warm rice and beans and tons of garlic on romaine.  I've had their schwarmas, their falafal and their hummos and have never had a bad experience.  The new location makes me super happy.  Parking can be hard sometimes but there is a garage just next door."}
{"text":"I have to start by saying Rachel provided amazing customer service and it was super busy when I was there (lunch time). She was answering phones taking orders from walk ins like me, and delivering orders to those that ordered ahead. Also when I asked her for her name not only did she tell me, but she reached out shook my hand and asked me what my name was and said nice meeting you. That made me feel like an appreciated customer.   The hostess was also very nice and said hello and greeted me when I walked in. I was able to see the peeps in the kitchen and they were moving and looked very determined to get all orders out on time.   They were so busy and I managed to get my walk in order in 10 minutes which is HUGE! The food was packed perfectly and it tasted amazing.   Everything was great since I arrived until I got back to the office to eat. I live in the west valley, but I would not mind driving the 30 min here to eat. Thanks guys!!"}
{"text":"Food was good taste like the other pita jungles. Customer service started off well maybe because they had been opened for 30 minutes. I was seated outside as requested. Nice view and the waitress was attentive at the start. Our food did come out fast and it was delicious, but we were not checked on or asked if we wanted more to drink when we clearly needed more. The waitress I think forgot about her first customers or just became very busy... I honestly do not know..."}
{"text":"HUGE portions! Spicy Chicken Wrap was twice the size of a Burrito from \"that place\" down the street!"}
{"text":"My favorite weekend lunch spot. Go at least once a week. I love the coconut curry soup and spicy veggie wrap is outstanding. Always served fast by friendly staff. Love the place"}
{"text":"Overpriced not so tastey food. if your looking for a greek type meal you can find better places then this."}
{"text":"i'm not an arizona resident/native (but who is?).  i have 2 friends who live in the area and every time i come to visit, i have to come here.  being from chicago, it's refreshing to have a healthy choice when i come visit.  i LOVE the chicken pasta salad.  i know, it's nothing fance, but it is refreshing and yummy.  i recreated the dish at home.  i also think the hummus is fab, too.  being from chicago, i know good food.  pita jungle is a great place for healthy, refreshing food in a laid-back atmosphere.  eating outside by the lake is the best."}
{"text":"Listen, sometimes a man just needs to wrap his face around some perfectly plump and sensationally moist boobs. Boobs on a salad. Boobs with caramelized onions. Boobs covered in Taziki. My point? Nobody serves up perfectly prepared chicken tatas over a bed of lettuce better than Pita Jungle.    Pictured is the Broiled Chicken Salad. I added caramelized onions and subbed Taziki for the normal dressing. I also added extra chicken boob to quell the raging testosterone storm in my body. \"Man need meat!\" ((Insert a photo of a Neanderthal, or frat bruh here))  Hayfa (the amazing woman who puts up with my shit) ordered the same thing, minus the extra meat (haha), but did add a side of seared Ahi Tuna and the Curry soup. Both were incredible. The flavor profile of the soup is really amazing. Get it! Try it. Love it.   Staff are always amazing. The front desk girl was a little awkward when we first walked in. Let me explain:  Her: Hi, for here or to go?  Us: For here.  Her: ((7 seconds of awkward silence and blank stares)) Me: Is that cool? Are you guys closing soon or something? (Assuming her silence meant she didn't want to seat us)  Her: No. Just pick a table and I'll let the server know.  Me: Haha... Cooooooool.   It was more entertaining than irritating, so all is good. My wife loved the cozy looking sweater thing she had on, so forgiveness was extended to her.   This location is always chill. Lots of seating. And really amazing service staff. The food is consistently prepared which is expected, but not always the case with some of our other favorite spots in town.   If you haven't been. Go feed your face here. We always leave feeling deeply satisfied.  -Adam"}
{"text":"Popular casual chain pita spot. 3.5 stars  Food: 3.3, Atmosphere: 3.5 Cost to worth it rating: 3 (~$8 pita) Return worthiness: yes Eve award: best non-dairy garlicky sauce  Highlights: - Garlic sauce: obsessed with their version as it's not cream-based. Has garlic, mashed potato, olive oil, and lemon. Simple, refreshing, and delicious--and friendly to the lactose intolerant crowd. Pitas would just be average and boring without it. - Outside patio: love the tall fire tube heaters as they look really cool - Buzzing atmosphere: lively place to go - Portions: huge pita  Lowlights: - Babaganoush: always love this dip but they put yogurt in there so couldn't have their version - Tahini: bit too much spice included, I like the traditional pure light brown sesame - Long wait: the hub went to get takeout and order took a half an hour--another guy waited 45 minutes!  I'd try it again to get more of that garlic sauce and come for dinner to sit on the patio."}
{"text":"I don't have a good reason to have avoided this place as long as I have, so when the chance came on Saturday to check it out I was ready.  While I don't necessarily love the name, the menu was exciting - so many things to try.  We got the hummus sampler and then I got the special, which was a Greek enchilada - I totally added feta and kalamata olives (which was an excellent choice).  The rice that came with it had just a bit of cilantro in it and the tzatziki sauce was nice to have on the side.  The hummus was equally tasty and everything was fresh and well seasoned.  I had probably six refills on the fresh lemonade, which made sitting out on the porch that much more refreshing.  The service was attentive and while I probably won't be coming back to this location, I will totally come here again."}
{"text":"Pita Jungle on Apache is the kind of place I want to love: art on the walls, specials under $10, good location, a hip vibe, and an eclectic and healthy menu, but due to poor service, mediocre food and other, better restaurants  in the vicinity I can't bring myself to recommend Pita Jungle on Apache whole heartedly if other options are available.  Let me give you a bit of background to better qualify this review: I've been to the Gilbert location for takeout a couple of times and visited this Apache location last Thursday, at 9:30 pm. It was the end of a five day fast and I had just finished a busy day and an exhausting workout, so I decided to treat myself to sit down at Pita Jungle looking forward to a flavorful and healthy experience.  The Good: The Daily Specials this night are about 10 bucks and feature a variety of grilled chicken, tilapia, mahi mahi, hummus, pita and vegetables. The location has an ASU crowd of happy hipsters tucking into their fare with good natured raucous laughter and conversation.  The Bad: Time from seating to water was 15 minutes. Service pace bad. An additional 20 minutes until food arrived. Soup arrived and entree immediately followed. Back server was mute and perfunctory. Request for additional condiments never arrived. After ordering the main server \"James\" _never_ checked if anything was needed, only to pick up dish and deliver bill. _Never_ asked how things were, just said \"All done?\". Mahi Mahi was overcooked and there were not enough pita chips for the overly salty hummus.  Summary: If you want to meet up with your hipster friends, or a desperate for a vegetarian option with later hours, try your luck. However I'd recommend the Blue Nile or ever go next door to the Tasty Kabob."}
{"text":"This place is always so awesome to go to...The food, art, service-everything, i always feel great leaving this place.  My favorite Items are probably the Red Pepper Hummus (which i add chicken to), the Chicken Shwarma, Veggie Burger and the Shrimp.  Also-they have one of the best Iced Soy Chai Latte's in Town!  Enjoy feeling healthy and happy while eating here-its awesome."}
{"text":"I like this place but it is really nothing special. Everything I have had was good but not great. The 4th star was for price. It is reasonable for what you get.   I like the hummus trio and the chicken gyro."}
{"text":"Excellent! Seriously not a bad thing on the menu. I was in Glendale for work, and our group ate here for lunch AND dinner! I had the jerk chicken wrap, and it was to die for. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"With so many healthier choices sprouting around the east valley, I will take my money elsewhere as this company serves great tasting food but horrible service. They have staff here that ''bow down'' to the most abrupt and rude regulars whom act like they need a red carpet when they arrive. I used to frequent this location here numerous times a month but was ultimately turned off by Hosts requesting me to move away from a table because a regular was coming in!! Why does Pita Jungle condone this infantile behavior? So I tried another location because I know Pita Jungle is better than this.  Nothing wrong with helping loyal customers, but allowing such behaviors causes stress for patrons like myself. I am very low maintenance, but every time I get seated I would like not to be asked to move for the measles 20 minutes I am there!  I am sure the many, staff especially feel the same way. What really drove me away from frequenting this location was how i experienced a manager miss treat their staff by berating them in front of patrons.Very disheartening."}
{"text":"Pita never disappoints. This is the tastiest health food on the planet and the house Rita  easily makes Top10 status. Service is always great. The freshness of their food is naturally enhanced by dining outside if you can."}
{"text":"I love the food and atmosphere here. Kids meals are healthy and huge and so there is always take home food for leftovers"}
{"text":"Pita Jungle really does healthy/flavorful/Mediterranean exceptionally well. I find myself gravitating towards this location most of all because its outdoor patio overlooks a \"lake\" (some sort of man made pond with a tacky fountain in the middle).  Nonetheless, it's nice to sit outside in a location that doesn't overlook a parking lot or street.  It's also very kid-friendly with dinner options my daughter will actually eat (Mac and cheese with sauce made from scratch, steamed fresh broccoli, low-sodium turkey, and fresh fruit).  It's food I would actually prepare for my daughter myself at home so I don't feel like I'm skimping on nutrition when I come here. At Pita Jungle it also means I can get a nice adult meal for myself without feeling like I've regressed.   I tend to gravitate towards the same dishes - the chicken hummus plate, the tuna + hummus, the salmon dinner with spinach and mashed potatoes, and the gazpacho when it's on their seasonal menu. Their chicken shawarma pita is also a good go-to but the garlic mash can be a little overwhelming.  Their portions are fairly large so the hummus is perfect for sharing and the appetizers can easily be eaten as a main course.   My only criticism (and this is pretty much my experience at all three East Valley locations) is that the wait staff tends to be a bit aloof.    My one wish for improvement is to change change up their seasonal menu a bit more. Because I come here so often, it would be nice to see a Spring 2014 menu that was different from the Spring 2013 menu. Just to throw some variety and excitement in there.   The Chandler location also caters! That's right - not all of them do, but this one does. It's always a big bit at my office when we get it catered in as people are always asking for healthier options."}
{"text":"Worst Pita Jungle ever.  The Pita's were very dry and stale.  They smelled funny too.  I always get the Chipotle Chicken Lavash. I asked for no onions but I got onions which I picked off.   Wouldn't of made a difference it tasted funny nothing like I have had before. I waitress was not attentive and we had to ask for our drink refills.  I love Pita Jungle but will not return to this one ever."}
{"text":"I've been to two other Pita Jungle locations, and was excited that one finally opened in Ahwatukee.  I've been here six or seven times, and the food quality has not been up to snuff.  Last night I ordered the portabella burger.  Portabella was overdone, shriveled, with no taste, and the garlic potatoes, which I usually can't get enough of, were inedible and left on the plate.  Last time here I ordered the chipotle black bean burger, which was fairly tasteless.  My husband got the ginger noodles on both occasions, and they were fair.  Service at the bar is good, but I don't think we will be back here soon."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying Josh is amazing at setting up a catering event!!! We had a multi-location event catered by Pita Jungle. Josh gave me great suggestions for making the event excellent! His food suggestions were loved by all my guests and the wine selections were superb. In addition Josh is so wonderful to work with, so responsive to all my qustions and concerns. He did everything humanly possible to make my event the night to remember, my guests are still talking about it 2 weeks later. Bravo Pita Jungle and especially to Josh!"}
{"text":"I love Pita Jungle but we had stop for lunch today at this Chandler location. The food was good, but the surrounding environment was not okay with me.  1. The girl sat down at a dirty table 2. Both bathrooms  (M&F)were very dirty 3. Some of the wait staff was in another world  4. Leftover food on the patio deck and not pick up  I had asked one the wait staff to pick up the food from the deck and look at me like I was speak another language. After speaking with manager he did send someone over and it was finally taken care of. Where the common sense with food works today, and you is want better wages well take better care of your work environment so your customers would enjoy coming into your home to eat.  The manager also needs to be more visible and walk through his business or none of this would of happen."}
{"text":"This was my first trip to a Pita Jungle.. and I will be back.! The service was great. And the food was very good! I had the salad with seared tuna which excellent. I recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Gave them another chance and the quality still seems to be the same; poor.  The Greek salad had gigantic pieces of lettuce that were barely cut, tomatoes that were green on the inside and the salad had barely any feta cheese (that's the best part about a Greek salad!).  Still, after all these months, a total disappointment.  It's like the people in the kitchen have no clue what good food should look and taste like.  Or they just don't give a damn."}
{"text":"I always seem to order the same thing...pesto pizza with chicken please!  The chicken here is so delish!  I don't know what they marinate it with, but it is very good!.    I am constantly looking at other peoples orders because everything looks so good!  The hummus trio always a hit!  I recently tried the chicken dinner it's served on a bed of mashed potatoes and saut√©ed spinach.  It was delicious!  I just wish the tables were spaced a little farther apart.  I always feel like I am imposing on my neighbors conversation :)"}
{"text":"Welcome to the Pita Jungle we got hummus and drinks - We got everything on the menu that you want, pita we know the names We are the restaurants that you find, whatever you may eat If you got the money, honey we are here to please (your palates!)  I likes me some Sirloin and Hummus please!  Love to come here for lunch.  It's a tad bit on the heavy side, but I didn't tell anyone to eat the entire meal!  I always eat about 50% of the hummus.  Stuffing my face any more and I would be a glutton and I'm anything but.  Their wraps are excellent, but again take it easy cowboy.  If you can't or don't want to finish it all take home for a 2nd meal.  I recommend the Sirloin and Hummus for lunch for sure, but their variety of Pita sandwiches are just as good.  They salads are huge, but definitely worth it and on the healthier side too.  The service here is always tops, and hots, wink wink! :)  Overall, I like the ambience of this particular Pita Jungle.  Very modern and sleek with an industrial look.  I totally recommend a stop by if you're ever on the North side of town! - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Consistently good. Solid service. Healthy, light eats at an affordable price. Also close to the movie theater."}
{"text":"Let me just start by saying the food at Pita Jungle is consistently very good.  However, my experience at Pita Jungle today ended with me being able to eat very little of it, so I couldn't really give it too much weight in my rating - hence the two stars.  4 of my coworkers and I headed up to Pita Jungle in Mesa today for lunch and it was my first visit to this location.  We weren't in a particularly big hurry since our boss was on vacation so we figured it would be a great day for Pita Jungle which is usually crowded for lunch.  However when we arrived there was no wait at all and we were seated immediately on the patio.  Great start.  The waitress came around after about 5 minutes and took our drink & appetizer order - we ordered the hummus trio.  We got our drinks in about 10 minutes and at that time she took our lunch order - couple salads, couple pitas & a falafel platter.  We then waited about another 15 minutes for our hummus to come out, which was kinda lengthy considering it was just hummus, but we weren't annoyed yet - just hungry!  After the hummus came out, we were left waiting another 35 or 40 minutes with nothing brought out from the kitchen.  The waitress had come around to fill our drinks a few times but had been MIA for a while.  When she finally came out to bring food to another table, we flagged her down and told her that we needed our food ASAP and we needed it TO GO.  We weren't rude or anything, but we let her know we'd been there for an hour and wouldn't be able to stay and eat.  She seemed really surprised which I found weird - um, is this the usual time frame for lunch around here??  After that, she brought out our checks (before the food was brought out!) and we were there for another 10 minutes before our food was ready and we could leave.  I strongly suspect the waitress forgot to put our lunch order in until we told her we needed it to go and that was why everything took so long.  But the most annoying thing was that she never even apologized or attempted to give an explanation, her attitude was just kind of \"oh well\".  We finally got back to our office (about 4 miles away) after a 1hr and 55min lunch of only hummus & pita bread.  In fact, my chicken shawarma pita is still wrapped up and waiting in the office fridge."}
{"text":"The other day I was discussing options for lunch with a colleague near the Glendale Mall and with loads of places to choose from we narrowed our search down to somewhere that serves fresh ingredients with a Mediterranean or Greek flair ~ Pita Jungle seemed to be our best option!  This Pita Jungle is ALWAYS busy and there is a reason why.  They serve delicious food and give fantastic service!   We like their Roasted Bell Pepper Hummus ~ Chickpea puree with roasted red bell peppers and their tahini sauce with fresh garlic and lemon juice.   We also like their (ever so becoming famous) Cilantro Jalapeno Hummus ~ Chickpea puree with cilantro, jalapeno and their tahini saucem with fresh garlic and lemon juice and topped with a little pico de gallo.  We will almost always order either Hummus and pitas extra to go for munchies later or the next day.  This is a must do from me to you!! You won't regret it.  They have very good salads especially their Mediterranean Chicken with grilled chicken, lettuce, veggies, roasted bell peppers, etc with feta cheese and pine nuts. Yum! We also like their Carribean salad which is basically a fruit salad with pineapples, oranges, grapefruit, apples, strawberrys, watermelon etc on top of some mixed greens, topped with shredded coconut, raisins and a strawberry vinaigrette. Something really fresh and doesn't way you down afterwards.   Of course they have Pita's beef, chicken, steak and tuna ~ what no lamb? They also offer Wood Fired Pizza's, burgers and Combo Platters with fresh Mediterranean dishes served with fish, chicken and beef, etc. They have many menu options to choose from, so have fun ordering and sample everything!   They are a very consistent 3+ to 4 star rating, although with some minor changes to their menu to include lamb and a few other more popular Mediterranean dishes they could easily go to a 4+ to 5 star rating.  I hope to see you there on my next visit!"}
{"text":"I'm so ~ oh so glad to see Pita Jungle open at the Norterra shopping center at the I17 Hwy and Happy Valley!!!  This shopping center desperately needed another great place to dine and drink with friends and family!!    They have the same menu ~ serving fresh and great tasting ingredients with a Mediterranean flair.  This Pita Jungle is very new but they have seemed to work out most of the kinks that come with opening a new restaurant.  Their food is DELISH and they give fantastic service, despite what the angry Desiree says, lol!   You can't go wrong in ordering their roasted pepper or the infamous  Cilantro Jalapeno Hummus.  Heck order the trio and try all three as an app!    I like their Mediterranean Chicken and their Carribean salads.  Both are very tasty and wont way you down afterwards for additional drinks or desert.   Their pita's are also very good.  I prefer their  Mediterranean roasted  Chicken shawarma ~ yum-fest! We also order some of their pizza's that are cooked in their wood fired oven.  Go for either their glazed Chicken Lavosh pizza or their roasted Garlic and Portobello pizza, both are full of flavor.  The best thing about this Pita Jungle....well besides their~  -the most awesome location (you can do dinner and a movie at Norterra)  -the young and uber friendly and accommodating staff  -the fresh with healthy options and delicious food   is their Happy Hours from 3pm to 6pm and then again at 9pm till close!!!  $2 beer and wine, $3 mix drinks and they offer a selection of $2 and $3 tapas apps!!!  I hope to see you there on my next visit!"}
{"text":"Stacey the general manager was amazing! She went over and beyond taking great care of us. They were out of blue corn chips for the nachos...she went to neighboring restaurant and got some. So to our surprise, we had delicious nachos because of her level of service! Thank you Stacey! We will absolutely be back again!"}
{"text":"Wow. Every time I go, I'm a little more impressed and full than the last. This was the first location I went to, and it's intimate and cozy. The food..... yum yum. Note: I think some of the Best falafels I've ever had. I most recently went to the location in Chandler. It was crazy! It seemed as though, in the matter of a year, this place had blown-up. Everyone and they're babies and grandmoms were sitting. Despite the almost standing-room-onliness, we got a seat right away, by the delightfully hipster staff, and were waited on immediately. I figured our orders would take forever, but they were very timely. And did that impact the taste, you ask? Nope. Amazing. Well done guys!"}
{"text":"We went her recently for dinner and it wasn't as good as I remembered it.  Me and Dom shared some mango shrimp thing with rice, it was okay but a little too spicy.  My mom had the tuna, she liked it.    We also had hummus, pretty good.  Not THAT great.  This place is a little too pricey for what you get and it was LOUD in there.  Oh and no drinks?  Just beer and wine.  Grrr."}
{"text":"I dig the atmosphere, I enjoy their food. Good service and a tastey schwarma left me with nothing to complain about. The pita and hummus made for a delicious appetizer. We left feeling full and happy."}
{"text":"I've dined here many times as well as order take-out every once and awhile. Service is always on point when I dine in, and the food comes out right on time. The gyro is very tasty, I love the salmon salad (they certainly don't skimp!), and the pita bread and hummus has the right amount of flavor without being too bland, or too much. The only reason I didn't rate it a full 5 stars is due to my last take-out order experience. I arrived exactly when I was told my food would be ready but I assume it came out a tad bit earlier than expected. It was somewhat cold when I got home (not a long drive at all to get there), and the tahini sauce was very watery this time. Other than that, I've never really had a bad experience at Pita Jungle before!"}
{"text":"Pita Jungle is an unassuming, relaxed restaurant. The decor and mood are decidedly low-key and menu centers around purportedly healthier foods like hummus, falafel and of course, plenty of pita. Ingredients are typically very fresh and vibrant looking. I can highly recommend any of the hummus appetizers as well as the baba ghanoush. The warm pitas such as the falafel or beef gyro are definite winners being cheap, delicious and filling.  This is a sit-down restaurant but food typically arrives very quickly and you can done with your entire meal in less than 40 minutes. The service at Pita Jungle isn't the place's high point. It's usually friendly but there's a short and rushed feel to it. That's probably due to the great value that Pita Jungle offers. Considering that myself and a companion can eat there with 3 courses for around $20, tips are generally low as well, even if you're tipping 25%.  Overall, the food is good, service is quick and the experience is laid back. It's definitely one of my favored locations in the valley on a budget."}
{"text":"Pita Jungle is one of those places that gets a lot of attention, and it's hard to say why. The food and atmosphere are decent, but nothing to write home about. Never had great service at one, but you kind of expect that at multi-loc trendy spots. It's just all around basic.  When you live in Tempe and are surrounded by so many authentic Mediterranean joints, eating here doesn't make sense. It is a nice spot to meet up with friends though. The menu has a lot to choose from and the drink specials are good so I'd say it's not a place you have to avoid. Just don't have high expectations."}
{"text":"We had a date night here last Friday... this location is much more intimate and quiet than the one on ray and dobson in chandler, making it a good date choice.  Good job babe :o)  The staff is friendly and attentive but doesn't hover.  I had the hummus and chicken appetizer which was very good and flavorful.  Morgan had the pesto pizza, which was YUMMY!  I always want what she orders!  I'm pretty sure I've mentioned that before though, so I won't blab on and on about it.  I also had a glass of reisling, but I don't remember specifics.  It was tasty as well.  Morgan had an iced coffee of some sort, with soy milk, they didn't have skim... just whole and soy, which we thought was weird... but she ended up really liking the soy in it.  It was good!  Like ice cream.  I had a great time... but I'm pretty sure it was mostly the company I had :o)  But, we'd go back here for another date for sure.  I just have to add, after reading other reviews, that there are often kids here who's parents let them run around etc.  This should'nt be a reflection of the restaurant.  Its a reflection of friggin parents who let their kids do whatever they want, whenever they want. Just an observation but it seems to be more prevalent in Gilbert.  Watch your kids people!  And if you dont have a sitter get your food to-go for f*cks sake!!!  Some of us DO have sitters and want a night without kids running around.  Its just rude and inconsiderate.  Sorry.  Rant over."}
{"text":"Pita Jungle has become one of my favorites in the Gilbert/Chandler area. Great spinach pie, awesome hummus, large portions, nice view. I usually order appetizers because I can never finish a whole meal and even then I often take home leftovers."}
{"text":"Was really satisfied with this place. They have vegan and vegan-customizable options, and were super-friendly to help me out there. Ordered a gaspacho and a veggie wrap, both of which were delicious; the wrap was humungous and kept me full for a long time. Prices are reasonable. Service couldn't have been friendlier. If I'm back in Phoenix, I will definitely keep this place on the radar. Recommended."}
{"text":"If I had all the money in the world, I'd eat at Pita Jungle everyday!"}
{"text":"They have made some very impactful changes which made my lunch experience today top notch. Now I have to ask myself: why have I not ordered the gyro before?!"}
{"text":"This Pita Jungle is on par with the other locations. Being in a large parking lot is nice and the new construction took consideration to have a larger entry/waiting area, which is nice. It's the same menu and selection as the other locations and, dine-in or take-out, it's as consistent as the others."}
{"text":"Hummus and Chicken Shawarma are always AMAZING!!!!  There salads are large and yummy!!!  Every time we eat here we are always pleased!  Service is prompt, despite how busy they are!  My children are picky eaters and the choices they have are perfect!  I know that I will always be happy when we come here!!  I recommend this restaurant to everyone!!!"}
{"text":"When I find a place that serves healthier food I'm all over it and this place has it all! They feature brown rice,beans and grilled chicken...which is all part of my my healthy diet. I ordered the Chicken Combo Platter and was pleasantly surprised when they brought out this huge portion of chicken,mixed beans and brown rice which included a side of pita and the most delicious hummus I've ever had!(I couldn't even finish it) I use to make fun of restaurants that served a healthier cuisine and would get upset when my friends would drag me to eat at places like this...feeling like I am being tortured because I didn't have my greasy,deep fried meal that I was accustomed too lol.But ever since I started eating healthy,finding Pita Jungle is a \"God Send\" and I'll be coming back on a regular basis."}
{"text":"Pita Jungle is soooo good yet this set up is disappointing. The assembly line style doesn't really suit the food you'd expect from PJ. I've eaten at the regular restaurants numerous times and always enjoyed it, but this just wasn't that good. The guy at the counter wasn't very helpful - he struggled to come up with a response when I asked for a recommendation.  This Pita Jungle would do better if it just selected a handful of things off their regular menu rather than copying the Chipotle-style set up. Because it's occupying space in a food court, it has the potential to outshine the other options. I hope they rethink the menu - I know they can do better. We shall see."}
{"text":"I come to this Pita Jungle occasionally for lunch since it is close to my office. I love the variety of healthy options they offer - fancy salads, wraps, and appetizers. I almost always order hummus, whether it's regular, bell pepper, or cilantro. So good!   My favorite salad is the tuna honey sesame salad. It has seared yellowfin tuna, leafy greens, fresh strawberries and mangos, topped with a honey sesame dressing. Awesome!  For entrees, I have tried the mahi mahi with pita chips, the chicken del sol, chicken tikka masala, chicken and onion lavosh pizza, and pesto turkey lavosh wrap.   Pita Jungle is a good choice for a fresh, healthy meal. They update their menu with different specials so you can always find something new to try."}
{"text":"Very kid friendly, which I appreciate having a two year old. While we were waiting they gave us some crayons and paper. I love their chicken and Cilantro hummus!!! Best ever. I only wish I could order the pita in a whole grain option, that's my only suggestion. Very relaxed staff and low key while still being professional and a great restaurant., will be coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"A very interesting dining experience. A unique flavor in every dish, if you're tired of the same old flavors around town, this place will reignite your taste buds.  As a vegetarian this place has a great variety on the menu. I have tried the 'Healthy Burgers', the Tapas, been really satisfied.  They have a super value Happy Hour (3-530pm, reverse 9pm to close) menu.  Have to go back here to try some more stuff."}
{"text":"Pita Jungle is a cool place with a large menu and many healthy options.  I strongly recommend any variety of hummus.  Usually, I get the roasted chicken shawarma pita.  They also have a happy hour menu and several local beers and wines.  Prices are good for the quality of food and the kids meals are great.    This is a Phoenix treasure!"}
{"text":"We went to the new PJ on 7th St and Missouri on a Thursday night in Oct.I thought it would be nice to sit on the patio. Boy was I wrong, the noise from the street is awful, you cannot hear anyone talk. The bar is nice because you can sit either inside or outside but again the noise is just too loud from all the traffic passing by. The food is good, I order my usual chicken pita dish and my friends had the salmon burger and the fruit fantasia.  The fruit plate was amazing and large enough for 4 to 6 people. I will be back to PJ but not this location due to the noise level. The Dessert Ridge has a very nice patio so I'll be dining there."}
{"text":"I am obsessed with the Lentil Fetoosh salad and I don't really know why. I have had it from nearly all of Pita Jungle's locations and this one used to make the best and biggest one. It is seriously not consistent throughout the different restaurants, which is kind of upsetting. I go to the 3rd Ave & Roosevelt location the most, because of its proximity to my work. I'm usually ordering to go and the salad is much smaller this way than if you were to dine in the restaurant. Lately the actual salad portion has been so small that I think twice about spending the close to $10 the next time I'm craving it. I don't think the order should deviate from what  is served to those dining at the restaurant. I'll most likely keep going, but I just want things to improve, or go back to the way they used to be! :o("}
{"text":"Sam,   You were rude on the phone when I called to place my to go order. I knew immediately when I spoke to you at the counter that you had been the one with whom I placed my order. You basically dropped my order on the counter in front of me. I could tell you weren't going to exert the energy to say one more thing to me - the customer. I said thank you, to which you mustered up a thanks. You obviously think you're very cool and important - with your black hair, plastered on makeup, and diamond finger tattoo (how original on that one). You're not important, Sam. And if Pita Jungle has any idea what they're doing, they'll fire you. You're terrible at providing customer service, which is probably one of the easiest professions out there. I've done it. Never did I act as if I was better than the customers I was serving. You should try and get over yourself, for your own sake.   Unhappy Customer"}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with this Mediterranean food chain. Great food, great prices, great service!"}
{"text":"As a Lebanese-American that moved to Phoenix 2 years ago, from Los Angeles via Chicago,  I've been very disappointed with the selection and quality of Middle Eastern.....oh .....uhum .\"Mediterranean\"\"  restaurants in the area.  I finally made it to my neighborhood Pita Jungle.  The location is excellent, right next to a movie theater and other restaurants and shopping.  The restaurant itself, is large and airy and is very hip.  The service was OK, friendly but needs some work with getting the order right.  To be honest, I wasn't expecting an authentic Middle Eastern food experience.  I ordered the Tabooli (Parsley Salad) and a side of Hummus and a side of 3 falafels.  I am pleased to say that I was surprised how good the Tabooli was. Very authentic.  I asked for a side of olive oil and lemons. I like it extra lemony.  The humus was excellent and very flavorful.  The falafels on the other hand need some work...They looked overcooked (falafels are supposed to be a medium brown, and these were almost black). The mixture needs work, maybe a hint more garlic.  The pita bread was warm and tasty.  Overall I was pleasantly surprised and will definitely try it again."}
{"text":"I usually love going to Pita Jungle.  I have frequented both the Apache location and the location in Glendale.  But last night I took my husband to the one on Ray for the first time since it had opened.  I had actually been there two days prior with my family.  I noticed on both occasions that the manager was walking around and making snide comments about the employees.  Huffing and puffing while standing at one of the computers.  Yesterday, though, we walked over from the theater and I heard the manager on the phone standing in the empty patio seating area complaining to someone quite loudly about the staff, again.  This time someone was just standing around when they should have been prepping their station, someone else was late coming back from a break.  I know things like this happen, but it doesn't make me feel very good when the manager feels so poorly of the staff.  I think it would have been better if he would have taken the call in the back ally, maybe in an office..but not some where that incoming customers can hear him.  I just didn't expect that every time I went there I would hear him complaining.    I'll go back...but because of the food....not the management."}
{"text":"Awesome. Just awesome! Great menu, great atmosphere (despite strip mall location), great service and DELICIOUS food. Wonderful selection for vegetarians and non-veggies alike. The name is kind of weird, but trust me, this place is worth a try!"}
{"text":"I can't find any words to describe the food at Pita Jungle other than hearty and delicious. The portions here are generous sized but prepared healthy so you can indulge without feeling guilty.  I'm not a big fan of hummus or even the pita dishes so I go either for their fish or their wood fired chicken. The wood fired chicken in particular is served with delicious, zesty garlic tomato sauce that almost make your toes curl. Accompanied with mashed potatoes, this is probably my favorite dish.  Unfortunately I've only ever had Pita Jungle as takeway so I've never had the eat-in experience but I bet the food is even better dinning in.....some day."}
{"text":"so. while the husband and I were dating, we ate at various Pita Jungles a couple times and I declared that I disliked it.   I have now changed my mind. I got take-out during the lunch rush and my order was ready in 5 minutes!!! The girl at the counter was the sweetest. Yes, it can be on the pricey side, but the wraps are delicious and healthy."}
{"text":"this seems like the upscale version of the pita jungle in tempe.... including one seriously snotty hostess.  HOWEVER - the food, as always, is fantastic. had the beef gyro ($5.95) - delicious, although overladen with red onions, which i truly detest. lots of meat and veggies, and yummy yummy tzatziki sauce.  the bf had the falafel pita ($5.50-ish), which was pretty good, although not the best falafels i've ever had (but really, i had them for the first time in the middle east....)  water was kept constantly full, great attentive service, good food, not bad prices. just a really snotty hostess who looked at us like we were scum (we came from a vb game).   i recommend trying the california beach club pita ($7.75) - it's soooooooo good, AND it's enough to be 2 meals! score!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite local places. I love the Shawarma, Philly Chicken Pita, and Pesto Lavosh Turkey Wrap. The Happy Hour that starts at 3PM is really good, with Hummus for a dollar, and Falafel for $2. It has a good local restaurant atmosphere."}
{"text":"I love pita jungle, BUT they have got to do something about pasta salads, to receive some boiled pasta with chicken and i dunno what else was in it, but it was the planest flavorless thing ever, and i LOVE a pasta salad, i was disappointed. As of late i feel like all the salads are kind of disappointing, except for the greek, and lentil"}
{"text":"Accidentally showed up during happy hour and that was great!    They have little tapas dishes for under $2.00.  Perfect little appetizer before having one of their yummy gyros! I always have to order extra tzatziki,not because there isn't enough on the gyro, but because it's pretty damn tasty!   My friend had their Chicken Pasta Salad and as usual, it was delicious.  I was sad to see that they didn't have their tomato basil soup this time.  I dream about this soup. I crave it. There is just something about this soup that makes you feel all fuzzy and warm inside!  I will order this soup even if it is 115 degrees outside! The kicker...their fresh pita chips that are served with this soup!   Yummy!"}
{"text":"Not my favourite location, but I love this place so it's hard to make myself rate it low.  Wait, no it isn't.  Let's face it: service here isn't as friendly or fast. Our waitress wasn't bad but the rest had attitude written all over their faces. Lots of local art, pretty cool. More space in this one is a plus, and it was quieter.  Also the food is not nearly as good. I had the falafel pita, which I haven't had before. It was dry because the tahini on it was such a small amount it was hardly noticeable. It was a disappointment and I've had falafel pitas of higher quality and better taste from a stand in a mall. I'll keep my business at Indian School... Sorry Tempe PJ!"}
{"text":"Oh Pita Jungle, how I love you so. I first was brought here by my mother upon my return to Phoenix for a healthy lunch. The place is very busy but adequately priced. I am a huge fan of the greek salad and if you just want a light lunch, get a small. The falafel platter is delicious, as well as the spinach four-cheese quesadilla.  I've never had a problem with the service, my water is always promptly refilled and yes, they are short, but I would be too if the place was as busy as it is during lunch.  Art adorns the walls and I'm a fan of that huge mirror [sneaky people-watching!] on the back wall.  I would recommend this place to anyone, it really is my favourite spot for lunch."}
{"text":"Went to lunch here and had the gyro. It tasted great!!! The flavor of the meat and sauce was amazing. I didn't expect it to be so good. The service was pretty good too.   This chain has a healthy menu and a variety of food. Good times!"}
{"text":"Pita Jungle is a safe bet for good fresh food. Their servings are huge, so be prepared to leave with leftovers or a stomach ache. I also loved that they had their entire menu on the calorie counter app. I have on my phone. I take what I eat pretty serious and knowing the nutrition facts really makes ordering food much simpler. If you aren't as picky as I am everything on the menu is great. They unfortunately don't have avocado otherwise I would have given them 4 stars. I recommend the broiled chicken salad, it's delicious."}
{"text":"I get the chicken pasta salad every time and am never disappointed! My boyfriend and I also love going their for happy hour when we get off work at 5. They have great 3 dollar margaritas and hummus!"}
{"text":"We eat at Pita Jungle at least once a week and have for years.   Love the fresh veggies and Mediterranean flair.  We are always delighted when we get our favorite waiter Josh Berk.  He is truly interested in making your dining experience something special.  From beverages to your main course and even dessert.  We always ask what is new or have him suggest something he has concocted from the regular menu with special additions. We have never been disappointed. You can tell he truly enjoys what he does and is so professional and attentive. He is why we keep coming back aside from the great food."}
{"text":"This was our first visit to Pita Jungle. It happened to be happy hour. We tried many items on the menu and were extremely happy with all of our choices. Kristen is a genuinely happy person and was happy to recommend delicious fare to us. She took great care of us, she was professional, personable, friendly, and prompt with all aspects of our needs without being overbearing. We enjoyed a wonderful bottle of wine called 19 Crimes, while sitting outside by the water. This was a fantastic way to spend our Wednesday afternoon."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch after a morning of medical tests. I had to fast through breakfast so I was starving. The falafel pita and grilled veggies hit the spot. Ethan the server was friendly and attentive. The food was delicious. Warning - the grilled veggies have quite a bit of garlic in them. I definitely needed a mint after that. The pita was delicious - great flavor in the falafel on chewy soft pita bread.   The thing that made Pita Jungle lose a star was their bathroom - the water in the sink doesn't stay on unless you're holding it down and the soap came out of the dispenser so forcefully it spattered on my shirt - neither are deal-breakers, but things I noted."}
{"text":"Great gyros and friendly staff. I stop in each time I'm in the area. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"My wife and I love Pita Jungle's food but my wife went for a pick up order I wanted a beef/lamb gyro and when I got my food there was a chicken dish of sorts instead of my gyro. No big deal we called and let their manager know of the mistake she was pleasant and apologized and offered to give us 2 free gyros \"just give us your name and last 4 digits of your cell\" when I came in to get our food they mysteriously could not find our record. So the owner came over and asked who I talked to he personally looked and again could not find it. So I left embarrassed because I assumed they thought I was trying to get free food out of them. My wife immediately called and gave them our info and mysteriously they were able to find it with little effort and asked that I turn around and claim our food which I did not. This is unfortunate because we eat here at least twice a month and I often bring friends or family with. I will never return again. Lost a loyal customer over a gyro and poor customer service. Next restraunt please Paul"}
{"text":"Pita Jungle is a great place to grab a fresh Mediterranean meal; It's quick, refreshing, and will definitely fill you up. From starters like hummus, baba ganoush, and taboule to pita dishes like gyro, falafel, and shwarma, you have every option available to you. They even have burgers and pizzas for you and your friends if you're not looking to explore new cuisines.   Part of my pros for Pita Jungle are also cons. Yes, the food is made to order and there is a wide variety, but none of the food blows me away. It does the job to fill you up, but is nowhere near other Mediterranean restaurants that are family run operations pumping out delicious dish after delicious dish. To be fair, it's not supposed to be - but Pita Jungle is a clean and chic version that seems to lack some of the love and flair that I have come to experience.  The experience inside the restaurant is nice and caters extremely well to large groups. I was with a group of 10 people and we were immediately seated at a big table. The entire space is huge and it looks like the place could seat more than 100 people. If I ever have a Big Fat Greek Wedding, I'm going to have it here. Just with that home cooked, love infused food.  For the food, my recommendation is that if you order the falafel, make sure to ask for extra tzatziki sauce, as it comes pretty dry. If you can get extra, it will go a long way to increase your enjoyment. Same for the schwarma."}
{"text":"I gave this place three and not five strictly due to service and ambiance. The food is delicious. typical fresh, organic, vegan, vegetarian restaurant. They have some beers you normally dont see which is nice. The thing i didn't like is how it takes so long to get anything. Also all the staff seem strait out of a comic book. TOO HIPSTER! they all were skinny jeans, deep V shirts, fake glasses, chomo mustaches and you can never tell who is staff and who is a customer."}
{"text":"Food is generally good. You get ginormous portions and I noticed people tend to share plates because of that. They serve four peaks 8th street ale.  I like what I had (curry chicken salad), but if you're not open to trying vegetarian/vegan options or Mediterranean inspired food, then you probably won't like this place."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to this location.  It has a great contemporary look.  The bar area is good sized and a great place to eat.  All the servers were very nice and very attractive!  My chicken tikka masala was delicious and I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Welcome to the neighborhood Pita Jungle.  The food is as good as the other locations and the service is very friendly.  I wish the bar area was a little larger.  The outside patio is a great option on nice days."}
{"text":"I usually hate hummus but the hummus here is really good especially the cilantro jalape√±o hummus with chicken. Wraps are pretty good too especially the Spicy Chicken wrap.  I can't wait to eat here again."}
{"text":"Stopped in today for lunch.  This place is usually busy because they have good food and friendly service.  I ordered the chicken tikka massala.  It is a large serving and comes with plenty of chicken and rice.  Nice flavors and spices.  Plenty to take home for leftovers.  Enjoy the outdoor patio when the weather permits."}
{"text":"I've never had a bad meal here. The hummus is very tasty- especially the cilantro jalape√±o. The major bummer is that the large hummus appetizer gives you this huge serving of hummus and only two pieces of pita. If you want more pita- you have to pay!  Imagine having a large group; this can add up very quickly.  The kids meals offer tasty and healthy choices and are a good value.  My favs are the chicken schwarma sandwich, the red quinoa salad, the mahi mahi and the Mediterranean Chicken salad."}
{"text":"If I could eat at 1 restaurant for the rest of my life it would be Pita Jungle. Now I wouldn't say that I'm obsessed with Pita Jungle, but I appreciate the quality and consistency in the food and experience.  I've been eating at Pita Jungle for 15 years and I still have not had a bad experience.  Sometimes the service can be iffy but it's always well intentioned.  One of my favorite restaurants, period.   Here are my food go to's... - chicken and hummus (get all 3 flavors) - Mediterranean chicken salad (chicken, parsley, feta, pine nuts, raisins) - Lentil and Fattoush salad  - anything from the daily specials list"}
{"text":"A friend and I have been dying to try this place because everyone is always talking about how great the food is. So we decided to give it a try last night. When we walking in the d√©cor was arty and cute, and it was actually pretty packed in there which was excited because that's normally a good sign on a Wednesday night.   There was a sign that said \"see hostess for seating\" with an arrow not really pointing to anything just into the large dining room. So we walked up to what looks like the hostess/cashier station and I asked \"Are you the hostess\" and the reply I received from a younger girl about my age was \"I guess I can be\". And this is where the TERRIBLE service had just begun.   We sat and waited for at least 10 minutes before a women can and asked what we wanted to drink. A man returned with them and told us he was our server. His name was David and was one of the most unpleasant servers I have encountered so far. He had the most put out attitude towards us, for example when he took our appetizer plate out of the way he took some silver wear with him, he said \"I'll bring some back.\" In a tone as if we were stupid to think he wasn't. When he brings new silver wear he TOSSED it onto the table and said \"Here\" And walked away. Every time he came to our table which wasn't not that often we would just cringe. When it came time to get the check he asked if we wanted it split we said yes, he walked away quickly not even asking how we wanted it split and came back and put the check onto the table stating \" I don't know how you want it split, figure it out and I'll do it.\". After that we just wanted to get out of there, we gave him $9 in cash to put towards the bill and the rest on the card and we clearly said to him to do it this way. He returns puts the check down and goes \"Well I put $7 in cash and kept the $2 and put the rest on the card, I thought that's what you said I could do\" as if he was scared we weren't going to tip him or something and he NEEDED to take that $2. I was shocked as a past server I would never bold face take money off the top like that. I told him no that was not correct and signed my receipt and gave him his REAL tip that was going to be on the card not his $2 in cash that he felt the need to keep. And we were out of there.   Now other than the service the food was fantastic. The hummus appetizer was amazing and we both had the gyros and they were amazing as well.  I will most likely not ever return to this Pita Jungle location because the service which is a shame because the food was really great."}
{"text":"I would give 5 stars based on my 1st visit. The food was delicious, service was great. I was so excited to go back with my husband & 3 kids. The place was packed, a single person walked in front of us, the hostess sat him in the last 4 top. Then she told us we had to wait, we sat for a few minutes, then a couple came in and she sat them immediately. I was irritated as I looked through the place to see many singles in tables with 4 chairs. I think she needs a few \"hostess placement lessons\". We walked out right over to Savor Flavor, and had a delicious fast meal. I will go back to Pita Jungle, but I hope this review makes someone teach their hostesses how to properly seat people when the place is busy."}
{"text":"Food is always great and fresh, plus always is served quick. I love the environment inside so relaxing."}
{"text":"Great location, rude staff, and the item I ordered was not only terrible, but cold (Lavosh Pizza). In top of that, after five minutes into the food, they gave us the check, like rushing us out. I've been to other locations and the items I've  ordered were better, but the staff is usually rude and careless."}
{"text":"Was here visiting prospecting schools for my niece. I had a flight leaving around traffic hour so didn't want to be far from the airport but I also don't like to eat anything heavy before a flight. My friend suggested this Pita place. So happy we did! The restaurant was very clean and we were greeted right away. There was beautiful art decorations all over with the option to purchase. They had a large menu and I really wanted to try everything. I didn't get a picture of it but we started with a trio of hummus. I believe the three were cilantro, roasted bell pepper, and regular. It was delicious! The pita bread they brought over was very fresh and warm. I was stuck between the Turkey Pesto Lavash Wrap and the Lavash Shawarma Wrap. I asked the waitress which one she recommended and she told me to do the Chicken with some of the sauces instead of turkey in the pesto wrap. IT WAS DELICIOUS! The prices were so fair and there was plenty left over. The waitress we had made sure the water was flowing and she was very attentive (I'm mad I didn't get her name). My only complaint, the parking. We struggled to find parking. Seemed like this shopping center was a little too busy that day. Other than that, I look forward to going back on my next visit!"}
{"text":"So nice having a Pita Jungle not all that far from my downtown office.  The cilantro jalapeno hummus is just the thing to fix a crappy day!  I haven't ever had anything at any of the PJs that I didn't like.  The gyro and falafel are among my faves.  So crave-able!  Being so new, I expected the service to be slow and mediocre, but it was fast and on point.  Nicely done!  There was a 15 minute wait, but they were turning over tables as fast as they could."}
{"text":"Hmm I swear I wrote a review for this place? Sigh.. well let's just say Pita Jungle can be a hit or miss from time to time. Sometimes the food taste great and sometimes I feel like they didn't put seasonings on anything. The portions are huge which is always a plus as I usually end up taking most of my meal home for seconds or thirds, but this particular go around, although I took my leftovers home, I ended up tossing them as the salad I had was just blah. Never fret as I will be back yet again as like I said, it can be hit or miss. But at least the service is always good!"}
{"text":"Good, fresh food. Hubby loved his schwarma and curry, and the flavors in both were great. Only real complaint was the size of my $7 pizza. It would have made a good appetizer, but not for that price or for a meal. It was maybe 8\" across. Tasted great, and I realize pesto is expensive, but still. Other than that, everything else was great, and we will probably give this another try."}
{"text":"Happy Hour at Pita Jungle is the best thing ever. Pitas are great. I'm deeply in love with the restaurant's foods. My boyfriend and I always call the same things whenvee we go there. I love the thyme and olive oil on pita, baba, chicken with pinenuts. The waiters are great, they never write down the order, but never mess it up. Not even a single time when we were there."}
{"text":"There is not enough positive feedback that I can provide regarding my dining experiences at Pita Jungle at Arrowhead.  The food and service are consistently outstanding.  If you have not already visited this restaurant location, I highly recommend that you do so.   Thank you."}
{"text":"I've since received an answer to my inquiry and the management staff at Pita Jungle apologized for the lack of a response and for the poor service at the Chandler location. I've been back to the Mesa location, which I've always enjoyed, and found the quality to be as high as in the past."}
{"text":"Wettest water in town!  The food is good, and hot too!  Try the dip! It's made from peas!  Can you imagine?!"}
{"text":"Went for a business meeting.  Business was brisk. Lots of seating. I ordered their portobello mushroom roasted garlic with feta. I admit. I'm a feta freak!  The crust was very thin, cracker like. It was light and delicious. Also had their unsweetened berry iced tea.  Try flavorful. I had been to another location and it too was delicious. You can't go wrong.  Also their cilantro hummus is to die for!"}
{"text":"This very busy place lives up to its reputation!  I wanted something healthy and somewhat low carb and settled on the Lavosh vegetarian style.  I had never had Lavosh before and I was pleased!  The vegetables were well cooked and the Lavosh crisp.  I had enough to take home for lunch the next day and it was just as delicious.  Service was quick, had just started talking to my lunch mate and our lunch was there.  When I want something different, I will definitely return to Pita Jungle."}
{"text":"Great hummus. My favorite menu item is the mahi mahi on top of cilantro hummus with sprouts. Great blend of textures and flavors. Waitress was snooty though. Acted like I was wasting her time."}
{"text":"When I am in town I like to have lunch with a friend at this location, and they have always been extremely accommodating. She has a short lunch break so I always arrive about 20 minutes early to order and ensure her food arrives right when she sits down, and they have done it every time. Great food as well."}
{"text":"Great place for a HEALTHY meal! Prices are great but place is ALWAYS packed so arrive before your appetite does. I have never tried hummus until then and I must say it is a very good appetizer. With how busy it was, I was surprised as to how quickly our food came out. I didn't feel \"over-stuffed\" as some heavy food leaves you feeling. Go try it!"}
{"text":"My first visit and I will return. The service was excellent and we were seated right away. Our server was right on the ball and helped me try to make my meal choice since it was  my first time. He had very good suggestions.  I ordered the special mahi mahi with pinenuts, caramelized cauliflower with a spicy sauce. It was excellent but a bit too much sauce for me personally. I would ask for the sauce on the side next time.  Our drinks were filled promptly and the outside seating area was great because it has misters. Our server took the dishes away promptly and brought the check in a fast but polite way.  I will be back again and again and plan to try many new things on their menu. A great new place to eat"}
{"text":"the food is usually fantastic but ever sense they began brunch the service is just awful! I will not be making a trip back there for a long while"}
{"text":"I wish this place was in California!!! I would eat here often.  The food was delicious!   My husband and I were in Scottsdale staying at my brothers, and wanted to go somewhere healthy...after 3 days of non-stop fried foods, burgers, pizza, well...you get the picture.  My brother said he knew the perfect place, Pita Jungle. We arrived and took a table.  The server was great, the menu was huge, many selections to choose from...it was hard to decide!  My brother got the Chicken Pasta, husband got the Beef Gyro, and I got the Mediterranean Chicken Shawarma Pita.  All were excellent!  Especially mine!  There was SOO much chicken inside, along with hummus and lettuce.  Mmm..I wish I had one now! :) The prices were great too, I think my Pita was something like 6 bucks.  Very reasonable for a great dinner.  I will be eating here again next time we're in Scottsdale. P.S.  Pita Jungle please come to Long Beach!!! :)"}
{"text":"Pita Jungle is always awesome! Had the grilled vegetable salad tonight and it was perfect! The garlicky dressing may make people around me disagree, but hey, I liked it! The vegetables were perfectly cooked, just slightly grilled without being mushy and overdone. Cilantro jalape√±o hummus is always fantastic! Service was attentive and quick, always appreciated!"}
{"text":"I love this place, dine in or take out. I always get the hummus platter on appetizers, hubby always gets a gyro sandwich. Everything is good you can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"just around $6 for a philly cheese steak pita.  and it was huge.  in another city, i wouldn't rate this place 5 stars, but in this city, it's the best!"}
{"text":"Omg- soooo good.  I always get the same thing- Hummus as Appetizer and the Lavash Shwarma.  I just can't NOT get this when I go- it's that good.  Staff is always friendly and attentive- LOVE the food!  So glad there is one close to us now, although I have to say this location on Ray Rd. in Chandler has always been my favorite when we lived there.  Highly recommend!!  :)"}
{"text":"I too am a big Pita Jungle fan, and have been  eagerly awaiting the opening of the new  FLW/Thompson Peak location.   I called today around 3 p.m.  and placed a take-out order for  the lentil fatoush salad, which I've had many, many times at other locations and always thoroughly enjoyed.    Upon arriving,  I was a bit  surprised to see how small the restaurant  actually is, based upon the size of their Shea and Tatum locations - I'm sure it has to be difficult getting a table during typical lunch and dinner times.   Also guessing that parking might be an issue; the area right outside the restaurant is not very large.  Obviously the Safeway shopping center has other parking areas to handle the overflow but it could potentially be a hike - not ideal when it gets hot.  Anyways, long story short, my salad was waiting for me, I paid, and brought it home.  Opened it up and discovered they forgot to put in the salad dressing.     Ate it without, consoling myself how many fewer calories I was consuming without the dressing, but it was pretty disappointing - the dressing is a huge component of the salad.  Also disappointing were the onions in it - the carmelized ones were burnt, and the raw chopped red was overwhelmingly  strong.    Even the cucumbers had an odd taste to them.   I think I'll continue to visit the Shea location until this one has been up and running a bit longer - they seem to have some kinks to iron out."}
{"text":"Pita Jungle was a great addition to the neighborhood choices. I have been coming here at least once a week since this location opened. I always order the grilled chicken with cilantro hummus. The last two times I ordered this item the chicken was a little rubbery tasting and many of the pieces were fatty. I am not sure if they changed the chicken or not but something is definitely different. Originally I could count on consistency..........not anymore. I am very disappointed as Pita Jungle was a staple for good healthy food. I no longer will be patronizing this location."}
{"text":"Seriously great food. Pita jungle has. Great atmosphere with good people and great food. The only missing star is because it is expensive"}
{"text":"I don't know why Pita Jungle is so popular. The food is expensive and it's somewhat bland.  I had a portobella burger that was OK, although somewhat tasteless. The best part about it was the grilled red pepper on the side. Some bland potatoes didn't help.   My partner had a trout salad. The fish was kind of smelly which indicates it was too old.   I have eaten here several times and have never been impressed. There are many Mediterranean places in the valley that have far better food and they are way cheaper.  The building has no sound dampening so the eating area is extremely loud. People start yelling at each other in order to be heard so the din was annoying and uncomfortable. I had a tough time hearing my partner or the waiter. There was so much noise I was afraid I was going to get a headache.   As for atmosphere -- it was industrial and not pleasing. They should call it a Concrete Pita Jungle."}
{"text":"I've had falafels at quite a few places and the one at this restaurant was average.  It seemed to be overfried.  Don't think I will be back with my family."}
{"text":"I have gone twice,  once with my wife and once with a friend.  Both times I had really great servers. I got help finding vegan food but one server did try to have me order something with parmigiano cheese.  Everyone liked it. That is a good summary.  No burger for little kids though."}
{"text":"After a bad experience at their downtown location we decided to drive alittle further to the uptown pita jungle. Im glad we did, Impeccable service and we were seated quickly. Our server was Max, he was friendly and quick. The food was delicious and for my boyfriends first time trying pita jungle he Loved it. Will definitely return to this location from now on."}
{"text":"15 minutes sitting there in a mostly empty restaurant and we hadn't even gotten our drink order taken, meanwhile 4 of the staff are standing around laughing it up with each other. Walked out. This location has such terrible service. Rather drive down to the one in tempe."}
{"text":"First time in the area and decided to eat here since we were at the norterra shopping center.  My food was gross (I got the chicken Tikka masala). My man got a pesto pizza. Food took FOREVER to come out and the server sucked!!!! Plus, why don't restaurants have a dress code for their staff!!!!? Half of her ass was hanging out of her too small shorts and barely covered her top. I noticed 3 other servers like this. Some of these young girls may think they will get bigger tips but not everyone wants to see that .... Needless to say I will never be going here again.. I'll take my business elsewhere"}
{"text":"I LOVE Pita Jungle! I have been going here for years. I think the environemnt is perfect and I love the Veggie Salad.. I also love the cilantro hummus.. When I am in the mood for chicken, I have the Chicken Shawarma wrap and my food has never been bad here. I have taken the kids here for years and they love it as well... Always safe with Pita Jungle if you arent sure where to go out.. Its always awesome."}
{"text":"We had a great experience at this Pita Jungle!  We love the food and the atmosphere.  We had great service and what an affordable Happy Hour from 3-5PM Monday -Friday.  I really enjoyed the Pineapple Margarita's!!!"}
{"text":"We love this place.  Yes, it is too noisy and uber casual but the food is just yummy.  If you go be sure to get the red lentil soup, the hummus with chicken, salad, or virtually any entree.  They supersize most dinners so be prepared to eat a lot or take a doggy bag home.  Also a great place for vegetarians. Good place for a quick meal before or after a Harikins movie (located in the same shopping center)."}
{"text":"Okay, I'm not a vegetarian, and most of the stuff I've tried here was a little out of my normal range.  But the food is phenomenal!  And how many places can you go in this area and have dinner overlooking a lake?  (Okay, it ain't Lake Tahoe, but it IS water).  Service isn't always perfect, so don't be in a hurry.  But the staff are very nice, the atmosphere is great, and did I mention the great food?"}
{"text":"Being from California, I expect pretty much all food to be expensive, good or not.  This place was super original, loads of healthier options , amazing tasting food, and all of it totally affordable.  I love this place!  You can feel the college vibe in this really fun downtown place!"}
{"text":"Worst pita jungle I've had. I had the hummus with chicken, which I've had at several other pita jungles, and this was just gross. The chicken was dry and appeared to look over cooked and shredding. The hummus was watery. I will not be going back to this pita jungle."}
{"text":"Great food! You can never go wrong with the chipotle chicken lavosh."}
{"text":"Fun food and great flavors. Work your way through the menu like me and enjoy different dishes. There is quite a variety. For small and large groups there is unusually something for everyone. I suggest you get the three flavors hummus with chicken. It's a crowd pleaser."}
{"text":"When I really think about it, I don't know how many stars to give Pita Jungle.  It is basic Mediterranean food; the chicken can be dry; the amount of garlic is often overwhelming (it will ooze out of your pores for a solid 24 hours).  The wait staff can seem a little...Berkley college student.  All of that said, when the food is good, it is some of the most flavorful, healthy, comfort food you'll have in the valley.  The portions are generous and the prices are certainly affordable.  There's also something about Pita Jungle, something you can't put your finger on, something that will bring you back even after a stinky Greek salad w/ very dry chicken."}
{"text":"After walking around that giant mall, my friends and I were pretty hungry. I decided to get a falafel wrap. I appreciate that they freshly fried the falafel, but it took forever. The girl who took my order didn't crack a smile even once and seemed like she was in a bad mood. It was only an okay experience. And what was with those little cups with like two drops of Sriracha sauce in them? Kind of awkward. They should just leave the bottle out for self-service."}
{"text":"This is honestly the only Pita Jungle I've been impressed with. I enjoyed sitting outside with my family. The waitress was nice and even let my uncle sample some wine before bringing it out. She was tolerant of my uncle even though he kept calling her \"pita lady.\"   I had the black bean burger once, which was good. Not great, good. It came out on two toasted pieces of whole wheat toast. I really wanted a bun for the full ~burger-effect! Aside from that, my family ordered an appetizer the pita lady suggested; half cilantro-jalapeno hummus, half red bellpepper. We all got pretty full from that, and an order of tahini cauliflower we shared amongst ourselves for an appetizer. The tahini cauliflower is ridiculously delicious, in my opinion but my mother and a friend of mine weren't a fan, claiming it was too heavy. It may have been, since we all had lots of leftovers.  Another time I went, I sat inside near the exhibition kitchen where I could see my food being prepared. My aunt said she wasn't into seeing the cooks make her food, but I think it's all about preference as I think I may actually prefer it, now. I was relieved to see everyone was wearing gloves and not fiddling with their piercings or picking wedgies. You never know! I enjoy knowing my food is fresh, plus it's entertaining to watch hipsters crumble feta over salads. Am I right or am I right?  That same day I ordered the Mediterranean platter. It came with fresh hot falafels, tzatziki, hummus, baba ghanoosh, a block of feta cheese, dolmades, pita, taboule, and greenbean salad for only $10! I was happy with my food and the experience. The lemonade is good but has some kind of mango-ish syrup in it. Not what I expected, but whatever. I can't complain too much about this place because the service has been great. At the Pita Jungles I'd been to in the past, the service was kinda bad (inattentive, unfriendly, etc.)"}
{"text":"The food here is pretty good. Quite a few inexpensive items. I enjoy the atmosphere of the place and I love love love good Mediterranean food. They have a delicious dish with cauliflower in a yummy sauce. The only complaint would be the service. It took forever for my group of five to even get NOTICED in the place. The waiter walked up to me, took my order, and quickly walked away! My friends were confused and they were ready to order! When he came back WAY later and he was very short with everyone. He seemed like some uppity frat boy that would rather be gettin' laid and drinkin' beers. Other than that, food's great. My friends were just a little offended."}
{"text":"I love Pita Jungle.  It has something for everyone and at a reasonable price!  Veggie-friendly, vegan-friendly, and carnivore friendly; Pita Jungle throws together clever Mediterranean recipes with a hip, modern flair.  My favorites are Lentil Fetoosh and 1000 Bean salad.  For the meat-eaters, I recommend any of their pitas or seafood dishes."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service.  We placed an order for delivery.  They deliver humus with no pita or cucumber to even eat it with and blamed it on delivery company.  They put the order together.  Pita was standard not optional.  Own your mistakes.  Didn't even try to resolve.    So I was asked to discuss this offline for obvious reasons.  So I contacted them and now they are not responding!!!    We were able to resolve the issue to our complete satisfaction.   They took complete responsibility and I look forward to visiting them again soon."}
{"text":"When we first sat down it took them 15 minutes and for us to say something until we got served.  I was recommended this place by a lot of friends, however, I didn't think there was anything special to the food.  We ordered the Mediterranean Sampler, which had a sample of several of the appetizers and it was alright, but nothing special.  The food had a more American take on Mediterranean food so if you're looking for something authentic this place isn't it.  The gyro meat was cut extremely thick and wasn't cooked the same way it normally is.  Overall though, the food wasn't bad and I thought the gyro was very filling and ingredients were fresh, but nothing that really stands out which is why I gave this place three stars."}
{"text":"I have been a fan of Pita Jungle since the early 90s. But this location has just gotten worse & worse. I only go here bc it is close to my house but the last 3 orders have been very disappointing. The lettuce tastes like it was poured directly from a plastic bag, not rinsed at all, very chemical tasting-yuck. Then, no dressing? I asked for it on the side but only got some tahini.and no pita bread w the falafel salad. C'mon people. Then the Mediterranean chicken shwarma was dry, tasteless and again, gross lettuce. No humus, tahini or garlic sauce. If I knew it was so poorly done I would have ordered a tzatiki side. I do not think I will eat or order from here unless I want a disappointing meal. Too bad."}
{"text":"I ordered two Shawarma pitas to go and a Cilantro Jalape√±o Hummus. I opened up the pita for the hummus and the pita had mold all over it. Our pita bread on our Shawarma pitas was stale and the chicken was dry. I use to love this place! What happened? I've been a loyal customer of Pita Jungle for 16 years.  I will not be going back to this location."}
{"text":"UPDATE: 2/11/17 - As you saw from the manager's comments, they got in contact me and will be providing me a free entree for my next visit. That is how customer service should be. Kevin was very prompt and helpful. I've updated my rating to 4 stars based on the excellent customer service.   ------------------ Original Review: 2/10/17 We always enjoy Pita Jungle, but on tonight's take out order the Chicken Curry Salad had no chicken. It did however have pieces of pita bread. Hopefully next time we will get the food we ordered."}
{"text":"My family and I have dined at this Pita Jungle location many times since relocating to AZ. Food is always excellent and service top notch. Very professional staff make the dining experience very pleasant."}
{"text":"As a young guy, this is the best location ever!  Not only is it across the parking lot from a gym, but it is next door to a smoothie/juice bar.  This Pita Jungle more than likely has the highest concentration of yoga pants being worn.  As for the food, it was great!  Everything was fresh, the wait times were minimal and the servings were plentiful.  It was a nice meal shared on the outside patio, which is great in the Spring evenings and Summer nights!"}
{"text":"I was so relieved to read the rest of the reviews on what a disappointment this location of pita jungle has been (I thought I was hallucinating). The service is slow, and on more than one occasion the hostess and the servers have acted like they were doing us a favor to provide us with any customer service. It's just odd.  I was so excited to see they were going to open this location so close to my house, but the quality of food is not at all like the other pitas, namely the one on Shea. It's really unfortunate because I have to ask myself if I walk to this location but deal with everything mentioned above, or get in my car to drive to another one just to get the quality I expect."}
{"text":"Great food with lots of healthy choices. However, the service can be slow on occasion. Recommend for lunch with friends but not family."}
{"text":"Incredible food, very nice atmosphere, open kitchen, reasonable prices, and best part...our AWESOME server Brooke.  Her skills are incredible.  Always checked to make sure we were doing well, drinks never ran out, and her cheery disposition was nice.   Service was fast and friendly.  Food was hot and delicious.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Roasted veggie salad is like swimming in oil. I thought other reviewers were exaggerating but they were so right...I wrung the eggplant slice out and there was a massive pool of oil covering my salad :("}
{"text":"This place is awesome;  everything we ordered was spot on and delicious.  The patio was a nice size but unfortunately had no sun!  They lose a star because they were understaffed and made people wait when there were available tables.  Also they could afford to carry a little better of a beer selection.  I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Only Two Stars -- simply because this location doens't live up to any of the other Pita Jungle locations we've visited.  The food is okay but the service is lacking.  Compared to the other PJ locations, the portions are smaller and the food is bland."}
{"text":"The good is usually pretty good at this PJ location however the service has slipped over the last few times we've been there.    Nice staff but they seem to have forgotten that it's fine to be a hipster..... however,  you still need to provide good service."}
{"text":"My best friend and I went here and thought we'd enjoy some happy hour eats. The place was nearly empty. Even still, we couldn't seem to get a good response from our server. My dining partner had a question and at one point wanted another appetizer, but it took forever to get her attention. Although the happy hour portions are very, very small - did I say \"very?\" - they are delicious. I like the healthy options available at Pita Jungle. I'll definitely come back and give them another chance."}
{"text":"This is a great place to go it doesn't quite have the same nostalgia as the location in Tempe which is a little more artsy however the food is really great and there's lots of parking at this location definitely recommend their pizza it is delicious"}
{"text":"Lived up to all the others I have been too!   Food tasted great, fresh, and came out quickly. Portions are always plentiful.   The waitress was very very nice and very good.   This one was a little awkward walking into....at first we thought it was closed for the new year."}
{"text":"Solid Pita Jungle. All our food was fresh, fast, and good. A little bit of a wait on a Friday night, but not bad. Staff was fast, friendly, and courteous. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place will blow your mind. You like humus?...neither did I...until now!!   Fresh and healthy food. Great and fast service."}
{"text":"Needed to go to target and had never been so I thought I'd give it a try. Not even half full restaurant and most already had their food, and no one at the bar. I had to wait 30 minutes to get my one pita sandwich. Seriously considered just canceling my order a few times. Next time I feel like getting a pita I might as well go shopping for the ingredients, it's probably be faster."}
{"text":"I like the ambiance of Pita Jungle.  It's a nice casual restaurant with faux healthy food.  Usually I eat their grilled chicken and humus.  Get it with the cucumber, tomato and a combination of their three humus.  Pretty tasty humus.  Today I tried the Kafta pizza.  It looked interesting - spicy beef, jalapeno, tomato, onions, pine nuts.  I should have stayed with the chicken and humus.  The Kafta pizza was a greasy mess with non-spicy beef and the jalapeno were nowhere to be found."}
{"text":"Curry coconut soup was very good. I liked the updated decor of this newer place. Waitress was dressed so cutely."}
{"text":"I finally made it to this new location of Pita Jungle last week for dinner... While it has a different feel to it, I liked it just as much if not more than the other locations.  It's modern and spacious and has ample seating both inside and out.  Not to mention, you can always count on PJ for an affordable, filling, and healthy meal.  I went with a group of five of us on a night that was actually pleasant (not too hot), so we opted to sit outside even though there was a ten minute wait to do so.  We sat at the communal table inside and ordered some hummus as an appetizer and then once our table was available, we moved outside.  I tried something new this time - the sauteed garlic spinach.  I ordered it as an appetizer (i know, kind of weird), but it was the perfect healthy beginning to my macro platter entree.  While Jared would not kiss me that night (hello, garlic breath), it was worth it... I enjoyed my meal and our service was attentive as well - and that says a lot since our group went through a ton of water and iced tea.    Other items that our group had were greek salad with chicken, some seafood special, chicken schwarma, and curry chicken.  Everyone was satisfied and went home with a full belly.  I learned that this location is a franchise and not the same owners as the original PJ locations.  I think they are planning on opening some additional locations as well.  That's fine with me - the more PJ locations, the better.  The \"Jungle\" continues to be an old standby for me, my friends, and family - no matter what location!"}
{"text":"Since I'm a regular at this location of the Jungle lately, I only feel it fair to review this one too... (I reviewed the Indian School location back in January).  This Jungle is still one of our regular restaurants on the rotation - it's cheap, healthy, casual, and huge portions.  Still consistent and I've never had a bad meal at any of the jungles.  I pretty much order the macro platter every visit, but on occasion I'll mix it up with a salad, wrap, or pizza.  Most recently, I really mixed it up since I was feeling adventurous.  I ordered us an appetizer of 1/2 hummus and 1/2 garlic dip.  I really liked it!    The texture was smooth and it went well with both the pita and cucumbers we requested.  Call me crazy, but I mixed it up even more and ordered the spinach pasta salad and added tofu to it for my entree - and again, delicious!  As a matter of fact, so good that I didn't even add my normal squeeze of sracha sauce!  If you haven't been to Pita Jungle, go soon - don't expect a fancy schmancy place; just go in with moderate expectations for good food that comes in big portions.  Speaking of big portions, I'm off to eat my leftovers... :)"}
{"text":"It's hard to keep up with all of the new Pita Jungles in the Valley, but I'm doing my best to make it to each one.  Today was the day for me to finally try the Fashion Square Jungle location and it did not disappoint!  Laura L and I were doing a tad bit of shopping and we worked up an appetite for lunch.  We would've likely gone to one of the sit-down restaurants in the mall but we were limited on time since she had a flight to catch.  It's nice to have a decent option in the food court as in the past I've gone to Paradise Bakery or Panda Express.  Laura went with a gyro and I had a small greek salad with a falafel ball on the side.  I enjoyed my meal despite having to eat it in the middle of the crowded mall food court.  The extra bonus?  They even have Sriracha in little cups on the side!  While I wouldn't seek out this PJ location, it comes in handy when you're at the mall... Keep up the good work Pita Jungle peeps.  Next stop? Downtown in the works I hear!"}
{"text":"I like Pita jungle a lot, the pizza I had there was amazing, and the atmosphere is pretty cool. The server I had last time was quick and friendly and comp'd my daughters fruit bowl because it took him so long to bring my marinara sauce. The one thing I was disappointed with is that for the price, my pizza was really small, and for the same price, my friend got this huge pita. The pizza was about the size of a small microwaveable one. Usually I can never finish a meal when I go out to dinner, but here, I very quickly finished the whole thing."}
{"text":"The Jungle (as we call if for short) is one of my favorite places to go for a cheap, healthy, casual meal... I've been to 3 of their 5 locations (Scottsdale, Phoenix, and Tempe), and the food is consistent at all of them.  However, this Phoenix location is my favorite not only because it's closest to home, but the atmosphere is a tad nicer than the others and because the service is extremely attentive!  Portions are big, and although I have my favorite items on the menu, I've enjoyed everything I've tasted at the Jungle!  The dish I consistently get for dinner is the macro platter.  I'm not a vegetarian, but I love this!  It comes with mixed beans, brown rice, fresh steamed veggies, tofu, and pita.   Add a little sracha sauce, and I'm a very happy camper!  As for other menu items that I like, the hummus is great to start.  I actually have several friends who order hummus and chicken for their entree too!  The gambas con ajo is listed as a 'starter' on the menu, but it can also be a meal!  Their honey pasta salad and their spinach pasta salads are delicious and HUGE portions.  If you like pizza, try the glazed-chicken lavosh pizza... it's my brother's favorite!  The pesto lavash turkey wrap is a good one, as is the medchilada.  Honestly, you can't go wrong...  The local artwork adds to the experience.  I warn you, once you try the Jungle, you'll become a regular :)  See you soon, Pita Jungle!"}
{"text":"So YUM! Fresh. Quick. Party of 5 we each loved our meals. They were so delicious. I live in NJ and wish I had one closer. Honestly cannot wait to get back to one. Great lunch spot.   We had the hummus, chicken salad, veggie burger, lamb pita, mahi sandwich all GREAT!!!!!"}
{"text":"Always get good service.   Great, fresh tasting food and lots of options to choose from!   My favorite is the red pepper hummus appetizer. It comes with one pita so if you have two or more sharing it I'd recommend ordering an extra pita. Their tzatziki is especially good and fresh tasting also.   Their Arnold Palmer is pretty good, but a tiny bit on the sweet side."}
{"text":"Thanks for your message, Bettina. I am not going to the trouble to dig out the dates and times of the occurrences, Pita Jungle troubled me enough and anyway that won't solve the problem at all. We have not and will not be back, but I appreciate the message. ~ MJ"}
{"text":"Wear your raincoats!  My friend and I had a great meal here this past weekend. Well for me, my food consisted of the hummus trio appetizer. I highly recommend trying it!  However when we were ushered to our table the table was wet from a drink spill and had not been wiped down yet. Our hostess asked.. \"do you want me to wipe it down\"? My response was  \"yes, I don't want to sit down and then get wet..\" I was perplexed. The table was then quickly wiped down.   Finally, at the end of our meal while we were waiting for the check I was startled by a splash of water to my leg. Indeed, the busser had tossed an abandoned full glass of a water into the planter nearby. I was shocked. Not only were there multiple parties seated on the patio but there were also customers outside of the Pita patio enjoying ice cream with little children running around. I have never experienced anything like this! My jeans could have been dashed with mud. Perhaps I had come on an off day..."}
{"text":"I've always been a fan of this Pita Jungle. Regardless of take-out or sitting outside by the lake, service and food are always great."}
{"text":"A staple in our diet.  Nice gluten friendly options.  Not all locations are equal!  Maybe we are spoiled by the Chandler location.  We also like the Mesa location... Awhatukee not so much.  My husband has taken to the small bites happy hour menu.  I really like the salmon and the tiki marsala. Oh and the cauliflower side dish is excellent at the Chandler location.  I did not enjoy it at the other 2 locations.  Each cook makes a difference.  I think what makes Chandler location so special is the chef's are in full view of the patrons."}
{"text":"I know it's a pita place but the Fresh Salmon plate is amazing. Many restaurants have this dish but this is one of the best I've had.   My only complaint is that it's busy and there can be a wait at lunch time but that's a sign of a good restaurant."}
{"text":"I cant believe I had never been here before. I was craving something cold and fresh, maybe even healthy, why not right?  My wife ordered a Beef Gyro and I got the Mediterranean Salad. The Gyro was really flavorful! Almost tasted like Chorizo! Which was a good thing!   The salad I ordered was very large. It had a little too much parsley for my taste but overall the rest of the ingredients worked really well together. The lemon vinaigrette wasnt very sweet and was packed full of flavor. I managed to finish the whole thing and was pretty full for a good while.   Prices were about spot on as to what I expected. About $10 salad and what not.   i would definitely come back for more freshness!"}
{"text":"Great food.  Friendly staff.  Wonderful environment.  One of my family's favorite places."}
{"text":"Super healthy food... Everything on the menu is great!  If you find yourself around any pita jungle I would recommend it!"}
{"text":"Happy hour tapas AWESOME prices - although tiny portions! Cool atmosphere.   Food we ate: falafel, hummus trio,  chip lite chicken pizza (best deal)  Yummy cocktails too + awesome drink specials during the happy hour."}
{"text":"I've only been here once and both my husband and I were surprised at how good the food happened to be. We didn't actually eat there..We sat at the bar and waited for our food and then took the food home. We were both surprised at how large the menu was and we had a hard time picking out what we wanted to try. We we got home and dug in the food was great and we were NOT disappointed."}
{"text":"I had my first Pita Jungle experience today and I was extremely impressed. I'm a SoCal guy, so I'm not sure how far and wide this chain reaches in the Phoenix area... if the Pita Jungle owner happens to catch this post, PLEASE come to Los Angeles.   The food was fantastic. We ordered:   Falafel Pita  Philly Chicken Pita  Broiled Chicken Pita  Veggie Garden Wrap   The chicken was perfectly seasoned. I personally had the Philly Chicken Pita and it was smothered in delicious melted swiss cheese. Generally, you might think something like that would be loaded with fat and calories, but a quick check of PitaJungle.com shows the Philly pita to only have 730 calories. Pretty much all of their offerings are below 1000 calories and relatively low in fat as well.   The open-kitchen concept is interesting too.   The bonus: you get to see HOW your food is made.   The negative: you get to see WHO makes your food :-P There was a beefy fellow with a neck full of tats and hickeys making the food. Classy!   This place is awesome.   If you're in the Phoenix area...   Get some!"}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere. Two ladies at the bar are awesome Nicole and I forget the other ladies name but starts with a M."}
{"text":"Same menu as all the original (and only one true to my heart). Always start with the cilantro jalapeno hummus, add some sriracha and enjoy. I like their starters such as the fresh mozz and tomato dish, and on the cheap check out the pita crisp, its a cheesy mini-pizza/quesadilla circle of goodness. This PJ is def yuppie compared to Tempe but I guess everyone deserves cheapish delicious mediterranean food. The restaurant is huge with tons of seating, the servers are quick and refill drinks often. The manager might hire based on looks though..."}
{"text":"I used to go to Pita Jungle all the time during my college years. It used to be a great cheap option for lunch, dinner or a snack. Now that they've opened more locations it seems the prices have gone up and the quality has gone down. Service can be hit or miss at this location, sometimes you have a great server who refills your iced tea constantly and at other times you can be ignored. The cilantro jalapeno hummus is the best thing on the menu. My friends and I always order it with extra pitas. Their salads are decent, the fruit salad is the best. The pita pizza's used to be the best deal, they are still tasty but slightly more expensive. The medchilida is great for sharing. Most of their bean dishes are pretty tasty and very large. I don't know what it is about their iced tea but it is amazing and addicting."}
{"text":"We love Pita Jungle.  Our neighbors raved about it when we first moved here.  The food is fabulous and everyone is helpful and friendly.  We feel really lucky that we live close to their restaurants."}
{"text":"Large menu. Lots of  vegan options. Their hummus is a must try. Wasn't a fan of a salad I had but management replaced it with something that would make me happy. We keep coming back here for the good service and healthy choices."}
{"text":"I normally wouldn't give five stars to a place where I found a hair in my food. But I admire how the waitress handled it. She was apologetic and had no hint of an attitude. She understood that it was gross and corrected it by giving me option to have another meal prepared or have the meal comped.   She handled a crappy situation gracefully, which unfortunately is hard to come by, and that's why a gross restaurant experience is getting 4 stars."}
{"text":"We are very pleased to have a pita jungle close to home. Always outstanding food.  This night I came in for take out it was very quick to come out. Thanks   Only reason dor the 4 stars. We always order humus w chicken and ask for cucumbers instead of pita. We always order 2 extra sides of cucumbers because you  are very stingy on the serving size. For $1 we get 8 cucumbers.  Thats needs to be looked at.... its awful.  Hate feeling ripped off. Hope management can look into this."}
{"text":"Stopped in for an early dinner tonight after shopping at arrowhead mall. Restaurant is nice and big and very modern/urban decor. It can get busy but today we were seated promptly and service was great. Our server was Carly and she was very friendly, knowledgeable and took great care of us.   I love their teas. They have a great strawberry kiwi green tea that's light and refreshing! They always offer you a to go tea which is nice.   We started with the tomato mozzarella appetizer. It was amazing!! Crisp and fresh veggies and came with the most delicious balsamic glaze. Big portion so perfect to share or even get as a meal. She got the salmon salad which she enjoyed and I got the mahi with pita chips. I replaced the pita chips with cucumbers for a healthier option. It comes with a jalape√±o cilantro hummus which is incredible!   Overall great experience and I love all the healthy options."}
{"text":"Great dinner tonight! Went for dinner tonight with a  girlfriend and sat on the patio. Mindy sue was our server and she was very friendly and provided great service through the night.  I love their green tea. Great flavor and they always ask to take one to go which is nice.   Appetizer: hummus trio with chicken. Jalape√±o cilantro hummus is my favorite! So refreshing and I eat it with cucumbers for a healthier option Meals: - tomato mozzarella appetizer for my meal. So fresh and delicious. Love the basalmic reduction. - turkey pesto lavish wrap is a favorite. So good, light, and the pesto makes this dish.  Overall everything was great regarding food and service. A perfect location for a healthier meal for date night or girls night. I will be back soon! Thank you pita jungle (:"}
{"text":"I'm excited that Pita Jungle has arrived in the uptown neighborhood and given us a extra shot of flavor from the ole spice weasel. The green tea with kiwi is a great, refreshing drink option and goes great with the hummus and chicken OR the wood-fired chicken breast. The caramelized cauliflower and tahini can also be a fun treat, but is quite rich. YMMV"}
{"text":"I've been to 4 locations across the valley and honestly, this one stood out for me. Of course, the food is standard across any of the locations. However, we walked in 40 minutes until close and I was a little concerned they'd be visibly upset. Not only did they not seem upset in the least, but our waitress was on point. She was tentative and patient since it took us a minute to figure out what we wanted to order.   I recently had a friend in the industry complain about the aholes who show up 30 minutes until close.... I was interested this evening being the \"ahole\" this time... Well, not only did a couple come in after us but I heard the kitchen at 9 pm. They said, last ticket is in and the kitchen is officially closed. As it should be, they don't serve until 8:30 and close at 9:00, they take orders until 9. Way to go Pita Jungle kudos to you!"}
{"text":"I just love Pita Jungle. Honestly, it took me a while to enjoy it and explore it as much as I have over the past year. The chicken curry salad! That's it :-p  Seriously though, the chicken curry salad had me think \"this is an extremely well balanced salad with everything one could need I a meal\". Prior to finding this amazing salad I tried their spinach pasta salad, again, amazing and made me want to try all of their salads.... So that's pretty much what I have done. The carribean salad with the delicious sugar coconut shredded all over it was interesting and delicious although I was a little worried I may consume a little too much fruit for my stomach to handle. The curry soup, yum (can you tell I love curry). I used to stick to the falafel until I found out the sodium content and thought perhaps I ought to stay away from it for a while. I won't go through the menu item by item because it may take away from the surprise for you :o) So I will close by saying that the kids menu is slightly impressive compared to any other places using the myplate guidelines to ensure kids are getting a serving from every meal, they aren't spiced and just simple for the possibly picky eaters. I like it and I can't deny it and we've been eating there pretty darn regularly so I'm pretty positive we will be back."}
{"text":"We frequent the Pita Jungle more than any other restaurant in the valley.  It's a great place to go for fresh, healthy, delicious food.  Undoubtedly my favorite restaurant around.  I love the decor of the Tempe, Scottsdale, and Chandler locations, but I think the Desert Ridge location strayed and tries to be a little bit too posh.  Regardless, the food is still delicious.  Try the red pepper hummus and the baba ganoush.  And the tablouli salad with hummus and feta cheese.  And if they still have the masala chicken special, eat that too.  You can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Okay, let me first say I love Pita Jungle. However, the most recent experience was about a C+/-. My friend and I went there to grab a quick lunch during the week, the place was pretty busy and we were informed that there would be about a 10 minute wait. Not a problem. So we went to sit in the booth towards the back of the restaurant. We were soon offered drinks while we waited, so we ordered a couple of iced teas. (A+ service there! So happy when waiting clients aren't overlooked!) So we waited for about 10 minutes and then were showed to our seats...then we waited...and waited...and waited. About 15 minutes later, the server came to take our order, we ordered an appetizer and two entrees....15 minutes goes by and my friend asks if they can also bring cucumbers for the appetizer when it comes out, server says 'No problem'...another 10 minutes goes by and finally our hummus comes out. No extra cucumbers, but by this point we are ready to gnaw off our fingers. With one scoop of hummus left on the saucer, the guy comes out with cucumbers, but my friend says disregard, as there is no longer anything to dip them in...then another 20 minutes goes by and the server comes up to the table to let us know our entrees will be out soon...then another 10 minutes...(for those paying attention, we have been at the restaurant for about an hour and 20 minutes or so) and finally our entrees come out. I ordered a gyro, she ordered the roasted veggie salad. Her salad was good, my gyro was cold. However, since I am more or less working with about 60 minutes for a lunch HOUR, there is no time to even mention it. No matter, the gyro was tasty (even though it wasn't warm). Two hours for a gyro and some hummus is a little extreme."}
{"text":"Excellent service and recommendations  from our server Andrew! We went for happy hour and ordered a Kafta pizza (amazingly awesome, flavorful and not crazy spicy), then decided on some tapas: Hummus Trio, Dolmades, Gambas con Ajo, and a delicious seasoned chicken w/ pine nuts that was incredible). To wash it down we had a Kiltlifter and a Tikkister (such a tasty cocktail!). Everything was perfect."}
{"text":"Was on a diet and needed a healthy alternative. Pretty solid place. They could not accommodate  a part of more then 4. That being said, they are good for a small group but nothing more then 4. Try the jalape√±o cilantro humus. Not too spicy, but it hits all the right places."}
{"text":"Fantastic service by Eddie thank you for being so attentive while we were in during the lunch rush.  The black bean burgers were delicious! The caramelized cauliflower was a perfect appetizer! Will be back soon for another plant based lunch"}
{"text":"On previous visits I would have scored them with a 4 but this time it was a bad experience. On the positive side, the server was nice. On the negative side, the food was slightly warm. My protein serving of gyro was crispy but only slightly warm in parts and cold in other parts. It wasn't crispy like it was cut off of a spit, it was crispy from overcooking it on the grill, but it still wasn't hot. The single pita I ordered was barely warm but yet crunchy on one end. It should have been warm and soft. My husband had a lavash pizza which was served on a cold plate so by the time he got to the third piece out of eight, it was cold. He really likes this pizza but not when it gets cold. It's always nice to walk up to their door and see an A rating from the health department. But that makes it even more disappointing when the floor under the tables is filthy. Food, paper, and silverware on the floor when the table has been reset for the next customer. That does not equal an A rating for me. The dress code for servers is rather loose, which I understand for this type of restaurant, but having someone's midriff showing is not appropriate. Overall, it was not a good experience which is upsetting since we usually enjoy our dinners here."}
{"text":"This is the best Pita Jungle I have been to.  The service at this location is outstanding.  We have never had issue with delayed food or attitude & the servers go above and beyond.  The food at this location is consistently good & the portions are generous.  I am a huge fan of the cilantro hummus topped with pico de gallo.  The garlic potatoes are simply awesome!  If they don't come with your dish, order a side of them.  Pita Jungle has a TON of vegetarian options.  The Macro Platter is a great choice.  I think I would sell a kidney for their mixed bean recipe."}
{"text":"Great service and fantastic food,  Ask for Chris!  a your server and you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"The hummus is very tasty and the fruit and cheese platter is huge! We asked for cucumber slices and tomato for our hummus and we were brought 3 slices of cucumber and maybe 4 tomato wedges. I would have preferred more. The overall service is not very attentive but they are very nice."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Great outdoor patio with misters, looking out to the lake.  Food is fantastic, large variety in menu options, best kids menu around and excellent customer service.  And to top it off, their prices are very reasonable.  A great value for the whole family!"}
{"text":"Always good food and service- the garlic dip is awesome and we always order it with cucumbers instead of pita. The nachos are awesome and they have the yummiest rice pudding."}
{"text":"Take out lunch, Jalape√±o hummus and caramelized cauliflower and tahini,  tropical iced tea...  freakin perfect!  I also really love the Caribbean salad.  The takeout counter is convenient, and if I stay to eat I alway like the dining area and have only had great waiters and waitresses."}
{"text":"The youngest step-son and I stopped in for lunch today and it was very good. He ordered the cheese pita, I tasted it and man it was good!! He loved it too! I had a cold med salad, it was loaded! It was huge! It was good, but a little too overwhelmed with a vinegar flavor. I love vinegar, but I wanted a little more complex flavor in my salad considering it had pine nuts, raisins, etc.  The were very fast, very nice and the price wasn't bad for such a nice, healthy, sit down lunch! I will be back for sure :)"}
{"text":"I've been missing out this whole time! Today was my first day there for a work luncheon and the Mahi was amazing! I looked at everyone else's dishes and it all looked delicious. The staff was very efficient as well for serving 18 of us."}
{"text":"Well, I've been to 3 other Pita Jungles (North Phoenix, Scottsdale & San Diego), so visiting the Glendale location was bound to happen.  Went there for lunch today - it's by far the SMALLEST location, but as ususal, the food was wonderful, service was great.    I ordered the spicy chicken pita wrap while there, and a large cilantro jalapeno hummus w/pita to-go.  Those wraps are so darn BIG - I ate the second half for dinner.    Again, smaller location, but great service, huge portions.  So far, the San Diego location is the biggest by far.  I'm really a fan of this wonderful menu.  Don't know how they make everything, including veggies, taste so good!!!"}
{"text":"LOVED, LOVED, LOVED this place for the food, but really do NOT like the squishy table seating.  Different, fresh, healthy dining food.  HUGE portions.  I've been 3 times and ordered the spicy chicken wrap, and the pesto turkey lavosh wrap, and a HUGE order of the jalapeno cilantro hummus TO-GO and ate it for the next 4 days at home and it stayed fresh and tasty.  The wraps are big enough to have a leftover lunch the next day (or share with someone).  Dining alone not so great.  I was seated at a long table with strangers bumping my elbows.  It might be chic & trendy, but I prefer to have \"personal space\" when I'm dining.  I would not even like this seating if I were dining with friends.  I ended up walking out, and asked for my order To Go.  Not the fault of the waitress - she was still wonderful.  For the reason of the bad seating, I knocked off one star - I would knock off two, but the food is really great.  The staff was fast & friendly, optional outdoor seating available (nice for AZ winter)."}
{"text":"Thanks to the impressive and professional people at Pita Jungle my husband and I were recently invited back to the Tatum location to give it another try. Our experience was excellent and I can't say enough about how the members of the Pita Jungle team treated us after our initial negative experience.  After my first review of this location, I was immediately contacted by a member of the Pita Jungle team apologizing and asking for more detailed information. I was so impressed at this company's ability to appreciate my constructive criticism and take interest in remedying the problem. No defensive attitude or pushy behavior...just genuine interest in how to make their business better.   Needless to say, the Tatum location proved my previous review completely wrong and showed me what they are truly capable of. Our service was great, the food delicious (as always!), and we were completely taken care of. The manager made sure to stop by several times and even thanked me for my feedback. Kevin, the man I emailed back and forth with several times, was very helpful, appreciative, and always quick to respond. I can't say enough about our treatment, both in and out of the restaurant.   We will continue to be huge fans of Pita Jungle for a long time to come. Thanks everyone!"}
{"text":"Pita Jungle gets four stars for three reasons:  #1: Awesome atmosphere. For being a chain restaurant (and after having been to some of the other locations around the city), this Pita Jungle really stepped it up when it comes to atmosphere. Great patio, cozy seating, and a laid-back bar.   #2: Excellent service! A group of friends and I sat at the bar today and had very impressive service. The bartender was quick, casual, and attentive...without that lurking feeling you can sometimes get. She was the perfect server.  #3: Badass happy hour. I love the $1 and $2 tapas! The hummus is so creamy and delicious and I love the oil and vinegar all over the mozzarella and tomato. Yum!  Good work PJ!"}
{"text":"On Tuesday August 16th my wife and I were at the Pita Jungle Fashion Square location. We were taking our time reading the menu and trying to decide what to order for lunch. The gentleman taking our order was wearing a blue head scarf. Most importantly though he had a very nice smile and wonderful personality. He very energetically helped us out with what always seems to be endless wonderful choices.  We were very satisfied with our Mediterranean salad and tofu.  Additionally, next to the gentleman was an equally cheerful and very helpful young lady who made our order.  Great food.  Great people.   Hanks"}
{"text":"Went there for my birthday this week as I had received the \"Free Dip\" email with any entree order.  As vegans, we love, love, love the cauliflower dish. I think next time I'm just ordering that on brown rice. The tahini sauce is amazing!  Shared the fallafel bowl with my husband. Not enough sauce on it and got more. It's really tasty and now they even have green Sriracha! My only complaint is that when we received the bill, $5.00 was taken off of it.  The dip was $5.99.  Now, I'm not usually one to mince words, but $1.00 out of my pocket is something worth complaining about.  The coupon should say $5.00 off.  When we asked the waitress about it (Darian), she said that's what the promotion is.  It would be nice if the wait staff would recognize your birthday once you show them the coupon.  You know, act like they enjoy their job and wish you a happy birthday instead of always being unfriendly.  This happened on my husbands birthday too.  Couldn't they just say, \"Happy Birthday!\" smile and act happy for us?"}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant with healthy food. Occasionally a little loud with unique music choices, and other times perfectly in balance.  Recommend the cauliflower tahini well-done."}
{"text":"Yelpers seem to live this place... So I had to see for myself!  I'm here for a business trip and was looking for places close to the hotel to walk to. What an awesome little spot! It's kind of hidden back behind some industrial offices... But what a great find! They flavors of this place! Wholly baba Ganesh! Awesome awesome awesome!   This place is easy to get on and out of, you can eat there or take it with you.   I came in with a group of 10 and ordered off the menu... Sort of. Mark was so amazing and accommodating. He split this and added that, this meat, that side, this sauce and none of that. What a trooper!  He even packed up our drinks in \"to go cups\", split our checks and had us all happy, full and out the door!   It seriously was so good, I decided to come back the same day for dinner. ( I NEVER DO THAT! ) I ordered the cilantro jalape√±o hummus ( texture and flavors remind me of guacamole!  Omg! ) and added chicken and 2 extra pittas. This is soooo big that it's going to be my full meal, with the baklava..... Of course. For all of that plus a huge green tea... 19.00! Worth every stinking penny!!   Mark! I will be back every time I'm in AZ! awesome experience and awesome place! PITA JUNGLE , you rock!"}
{"text":"Nothing like food poisoning to ruin your week. Thanks Pita Jungle @ Norterra, for the raw chicken.  I  Don't mean just a bit undercooked..... I'm talking wet, fleshy, RAW meet on the inside. And all they had to say was\"Uhh I'm  sorry\" Then after getting more upset with them, they only offered free food next time..... WHY WOULD I GO BACK?!!!"}
{"text":"My family and I love pita jungle. I have a pretty picky eater and she love pita jungle. There are many healthy options here. Over the years, I have tried a lot of stuff on the menu. Tonight my wife and I split the red quinoa with cilantro jalape√±o hummus salad and my kids each had a kids meal. The salad is pretty tasty. I am not a big fan of kale but I really like it on this salad. When you pair it with the blue corn tortilla chips it takes it to another level. I would definitely recommend this place if you are looking for a good spot to eat."}
{"text":"This location for Pita Jungle was pretty true to the others I've been to.  I had the lentil soup & added a side of grilled tofu.  It was standard - very flavorful & vegan!  There are many options that you can get that aren't on the menu - simply ask your server!"}
{"text":"Pita Jungle is our go-to place for quick service.  The wait is typically short and the staff is usually quite attentive.  The food is always either good or great.  My current favorite dish is the quinoa salad on the specials menu - I get plain hummus with quinoa, kale, and other goodies on top with a side of pitas.  The soups are also amazing and many are vegan!  We've brought many picky out-of-town guests, and everyone is always able to find something they enjoy!  The happy hour is great as well!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to Pita Jungle for almost 20 years now. It's just one of those special places that never gets old! Their Mediterranean chicken salad is pretty much the best salad on earth. Ahi tuna hummus is ridiculous,  Turkey pesto wrap is amazing, and the baklava is the freshest because they sell it out so fast!  An easy 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Pita Jungle is my favorite spot for healthy and delicious eats. I've tried different items from there menu. I'm always pleased and satisfied. The atmosphere is great and customer service is awesome at this location. I always end my meal with some baklava."}
{"text":"I ordered the cold tuna pita which was fantastic. Definitely a lot of food for $10. The entire menu looked amazing and it was hard to choose what to order. I can't wait to try the hummus next time that everyone talks about!"}
{"text":"Worst service..no water provided..because who really needs that in Az? No one checked on me after my food arrived and they forgot my to go cup of Tea.  Fo-riz..its 3:30pm not like they were busy or anything.  Go to the Shea or Chandler location...so much better! I'll never come back to this one."}
{"text":"This location, thankfully,  is less noisy than others I have been to.  Food is ok, but I was disappointed in their Guajillo Shrimp \"special\" - a grand total of five (5)  medium shrimp in a  small appetizer bowl with a slice of lemon and a small amount of spicy sauce. For a not-so-bargain $7.99 !  Not a bargain and not special in any sense."}
{"text":"Incredible customer service.  Me and my friend were there after they closed and we were never rushed or even pushed to leave. Didn't even know they were closed. Classy people."}
{"text":"I am sitting here working through the remains of last nights dinner.  Granted I cannot eat like the healthy 20 something I once was but I do not eat like a bird either.  I had the small garlic hummus plate and chicken tiki marsala ($15 w/tax).  With the addition of an extra slice of pita bread this was definitely a meal for two.  Looking around me just about every one was taking a healthy serving of their meal home. As far as taste and preparation go there was nothing great or lacking.  Thomas, my cat, has just confirmed the chicken was good.  :-)  When I was still out in the parking lot the hostess was holding the door open for me.  With empty store fronts all around it was pretty obvious where I was headed.  Waitress got to me after I just had time to decide what I wanted (about 3 minutes).  I ordered water to drink and gave her my dinner order at the same time.  She asked if I would like my hummus up first or with dinner (first).  Off she went, turned in my order, got my water ( I noticed they used the filtered water from the soda dispenser), then brought my hummus and pita.  I had maybe 3 bites when my entree showed up from another server.  My waitress came by and made a bit of apology for the short time delay, not sure whether I would have been happier with a longer time delay if it ended up under a heat lamp and I don't see out of my left eye so I couldn't tell what was happening in the kitchen.  This was about 6:30 on a Wednesday evening.  I would say the restaurant was about 20% full.  They were on the verge of too much staff.  Everybody was friendly and smiling.  All in all a pleasant place to dine.  The people I saw picking up take out seemed to be happy with their orders and were repeat customers.  As a final note it is a good thing babies bounce well.  Two tables over a toddler climbed up the back of a chair and over it went right into the aisle.  Other than a bit of pride and a bloody nose the child was fine and really didn't cry nearly as much as some kids do for no reason."}
{"text":"Met a friend here for lunch Saturday. For starters we shared a small roasted bell pepper hummus. She had a Falafel Pita and I had chicken tikka masala and we sampled each other's. We decided all the food we had was good. We had really good service, especially as we had a 2 hour lunch. We never felt hurried even as it got busy later on. The decor was nice, a mixture of different size tables that they were moving around to accommodate different size groups and some high tops and a community table. They have a nice patio but it was a bit chilly to eat out there in the shade. Just as we were leaving we noticed the lamp shades and bicycles hanging from the ceiling."}
{"text":"Walk in and order the The cilantro jalape√±o hummus you will not be disappointed! The chicken tikka masala is always my go to main dish! The food always prepared perfectly and service is always great!"}
{"text":"I loooove their chicken shwarma pita. Good quick service during lunch time and friendly wait staff."}
{"text":"I dont eat here often as I mainly just do pick up orders.  Jaimie (spelling?) Helped me out tonight and she was great!  My order was a little slow coming out but she kept me posted, offered me water and was just the ultimate professional.  Glad she works at the PJ I visot the most."}
{"text":"Ok I'm as surprised as you are that a mall food court restaurant can make good food. But they did a great job. My tuna was medium rare and the hummus is never disappointing. Excellent lunch.  Menu descriptions could use some work.   Please comment and follow me for more reviews! I would love to have you!"}
{"text":"Do you ever just crave jalapeno & cilantro hummus? No? Well I do, and still recently new in my area of town so unfamiliar to all that is in my surroundings, so I checked the Yelp app for hummus and Pita Jungle showed up, and get this it's within 3 miles of my place, so this was a win win for me!  I knew what I wanted so I called my order in, I got a small side of jalapeno cilantro hummus with cucumbers and a chicken shawarma pita with garlic potatoes was told my order would be ready for pick up in 10 to 15 minutes.  Arrived at Pita Jungle, and have to say I like the setup of this place, and it seems to me that maybe each Pita Jungle is set up a little differently, which is cool, I like variety.   Even the small hummus is enough to share between 2 people and the side of cucumber looked like it was maybe a whole cucumber and this side was delish, just what I was craving. The garlic potatoes are always a favorite with me at Pita Jungle but the chicken shawarma wasn't that great, I couldn't place my finger on but something was off so I didn't finish that.   I can't really attest to service since I was a pick up only, but I was greeted by the hostess when I entered and showed were to get my order. Glad to have found Pita Jungle in my area, I'm sure I will be back."}
{"text":"So some for their lunch time crave hamburgers or sandwiches, but me, sometimes I crave pita bread & shawarma with tahini  and arabic pickles. Some coworkers where headed to Pita Jungle for lunch and I thought it would be  perfect time to try them out, get what I was craving and see how they are, so I placed my order.  I ordered the chicken shawarma pita with tahini & garlic sauce, pickles, tomatoes, onions & some mixed greens, Omg it was just what I wanted. The garlic sauce was not too over powering but you could tell it was there. My friend makes the best garlic sauce made with 40 cloves of garlic it's my favorite stuff, but for days you just sweat out garlic , but keep the vampires away, but this garlic sauce, it was perfect, hint of garlic to let you know it was their but not enough to offend anyone near you.  The pita bread was the perfect texture and the chicken was perfectly seasoned and cooked. This was a good shawarma pita wrap.  Happy to add Pita Jungle to my lunch rotation."}
{"text":"Dad wanted to eat in for Father's Day, so I called in an order and picked it up on the way over. So easy. They were friendly and efficient, and the food was great!"}
{"text":"I frequent the Desert Ridge location often.  I usually sit at the bar when I'm alone and always have very prompt and friendly service.    Anyone that is familiar with PJ knows they have the BEST hummus in town.  I love to get the trio of regular, roasted red pepper, and cilantro jalapeno.  And for an entree, top it off with a protein such as the ahi tuna, chicken, or steak.  My BF and I will often split the Chicken Curry Salad, a side order of Tahini Cauliflower, and the Mixed Beans AND we STILL have left overs.  My new recent favorite is the Veggie Lavosh Wrap.  OMG, even if you aren't a Veg Head this is sooo yummy and a HUGE portion!  Also, if you are on a budget... House Wines (Red & White) & Margaritas are super cheap!"}
{"text":"This is the third Pita Jungle in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area I have been to.  It is quite new and everything was clean and bright.    We went last night, a Friday night, at around 6:30 pm.  There was a short wait for the two of us, but probably only 5 minutes.  There were loads of families with children there, which I do like to see.  The atmosphere was rather loud, but it suits the time of day.  I've also been here in the afternoon and it was quieter.  I really enjoy Pita Jungle's food.  Although I didn't have the hummus this go round, I like it.  Last night I tried two specials, the coconut curry soup and a couscous salad.  As to the gentleman who ordered a beer and the soup and didn't like it, I think that might be because the soup has a delicate flavor and beer would likely make it impossible to taste.  It reminded me of a lovely corn chowder made in a vegetable broth base with curry and light coconut flavor.  The chunks in the soup included garbanzo beans and red pepper.  I thought it was delicious.  The salads here are always large.  Unless you have an enormous appetite, expect to leave some on the plate.  The couscous salad was made with spinach, parsley, red pepper, tomatoes, pineapple and many other things I've probably forgotten.  I found the pineapple a bit overwhelming in the salad.  I wanted more parsley because it goes so well with this salad.  My husband ordered the gyro and ate it all, I didn't hear any complaints.  The hostess was friendly and our waitress did a good job.  In the span of our meal (I think we were in and out of there in 30 minutes) she refilled the water glasses three times, checked on the bowl of soup that didn't come out with the rest of the order and brought us our check.  Everyone working there was dressed in a trendy style, but I think it adds to the atmosphere.  We will definitely eat here again - probably with our kids next time."}
{"text":"In my opinion sitting at the bar is the best! The staff is fun and friendly and it's pretty entertaining. I have literally never had anything here I didn't like. My Husband loves it too and it's the best because we can eat healthy and not feel like we are sacrificing flavor or fun eating."}
{"text":"I have been going to this location for years and everything I get has been great. The portions are generous and the service is always good."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try out the Pita Jungle location near my home for quite sometime now. So I called in a pick-up order on my way home from work. When I got there, I go in and walk up to the pick-up counter. The girl who greeted me and helped me complete my order was very nice and in the dining room there was live piano music being played (I LOVE the piano) so I was totally bummed I had just ordered for pick-up! Soon after I walked in, though my experienced changed from 'Awesome!' to 'Hurry give me my check so I can get out of here!'  After I walked in I felt like I was being looked at. So I glanced up and noticed this guy further behind the counter just looking at me. He had co-workers chatting around him, but he was staring straight at me. It was very uncomfortable! I felt like he was watching me the whole time I was there. I found it rude, disrespectful and creepy to openly stare at a customer. When I first walked in my experience was so pleasent, but now I'm wondering if I feel comfortable enough to try this location again! I know that if I order from here again I'm going to ask the person who takes the order if the man is there and if he is, I'll go somewhere else. I don't know who he is but he was sort of tall and heavier set, had dark rimmed glasses, and a thick tattoo band around his left calf.  Based on the food and my initial reaction to the environment I would have given this location a 5/5 but after factoring in Mr. Creepy it only gets 3/5."}
{"text":"Came here for G's birthday.  That is nice of them to take reservations for us.  We had 11 of us.  The service was great.  The place can get a little loud.  I ordered hummus and grilled chicken with pine nuts served with pita!  Very good a little salty then normal.  Never had to ask for a refill - Awesome!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch at 11:20am, it was not too packed yet.  My brother got there 10 mins later.  We both ordered.  I got the Chicken Philly Pita.  My favorite!!!   This location did not disappointment either.  Woot woot!!!"}
{"text":"This is one of the new locations, love the \"newest\".  The server was awesome!!!  I ordered the hummus with chicken.  It was good.  Why 5 stars?  The server refilled our drinks into togo cups when we are getting ready to leave.  +++++"}
{"text":"The food was great as usual like all the other locations.  I like the vibe and feel of this location.  2 Cons:  Service was slow and our desert was hard like a ROCK!  We mentioned it to the server and she said oh, they probably baked it too long.  WOW!  Ok, so we can suppose to choke it down?"}
{"text":"I have been to this location in awhile, but my coworker from IN was in town.  She wanted something healthy, so Pita Jungle popped in my mind.  She absolutely loved it.  She commented on how trendy the place is.  She loved the pasta salad and the portion is huge.  I ordered the humus and grilled chicken with roasted pinenuts.  OMG, this is my favie now.  Move over chicken philly steak, Hello my new friend humus with grilled chicken with roasted pinenuts.  The pita was plenty.   Mmmmmmm.................."}
{"text":"I'm so sorry to give them 2 stars! But, alas, I had to do it.  This isn't about the service (which is great) or the location (location, location). Their onions penetrate every facet of the menu.  Everything! I just can't stomach it anymore, even after visiting 3-4 times.  some of my friends even work here! Anyway, don't come here if you don't like onions or sitting one foot away from the next table."}
{"text":"We were looking for a healthy spot and came across the Pita Jungle.   Upon entering, I knew it was going to exceed my expectations. From the ambiance, to the friendliness of the host and server, to the menu, it was first class. And the food was incredible. I started with a quinoa chili which was amazing, followed by a chicken avocado tostada pita which was even better.   If your in Peoria, you need to try this place. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I like the concept of Pita Jungle, I have just had better. Way better. The service was pretty good and it is just off of the light rail. We sat near the back where the booths are coming apart. I know they are probably going for the whole retro, artsy type vibe but I am an artist myself and I would just call it dumpy. We ordered the hummus (of course) and pita, a falafel pita, Philadelphia cheese-steak pita, and the pesto pizza.   I was extremely disappointed by the pita when it came, a whole plate of hummus and they gave us this small, sad looking pita to go with it. For a place with pita in its moniker, you would think the pita would be the prize of the menu but it was chewy, flat and stiff. I sat there the whole time eating and thinking how much better Zorba's in Chandler is than this.  The hummus is okay and while the falafel was passable, they wrapped it in that so-so pita. The pesto pizza was good but nothing to write home about. The cheese-steak pita needed to be mopped up after but I hear it was good.   For $28 for these items I was left feeling like we would have had a better experience and WAY more food to show for the money at Haji-Baba's in Tempe on Apache Blvd. At least I got some free 944 magazines out of it but I was hungry again two hours later."}
{"text":"I wouldn't say that the service was unfriendly but where was the service? Coming in was okay, and we sat outside so maybe that was our own undoing. I always feel when you sit outside, the waiters forget about you or something. It was so lovely out we didn't want to be cooped up inside though. The timeline went as follows:  -Drinks were ordered, took at least 10-15 minutes to get our basic order. Longer for the booze, it came a little before the meal and the waiter had to be reminded. -We ordered several tapas since the waiter pointed out that they were having happy hour specials. They never arrived. -They were busy but the wait was so long for food we eventually ended up trying to find our waiter to see if they had forgotten about our order.  -At long last the food came and we had to remind her we had ordered tapas and we had wanted them before the meal. So we ended up with tapas with our meal which was ideally ordered to go with the drinks.  The falafel platter was a little disappointing as is the case whenever I order it from here. For some reason they always over-fry the balls leaving them too hard. Nothing really beats Haji Baba's or Elie's Deli."}
{"text":"This PJ's food is as good as any of the others, which is excellent.  We ordered the hummus trio for starters, and a chicken philly and Greek gyro for the main entrees. Both were hot, delicious, and we wanted for nothing insofar as the food goes.  A couple things that seem to be a recurring theme in this area is the lack of enthusiasm in the staff.  Maybe it's the local youth who work in restaurants around MMR, but there is a general malaise about them that you don't find in other parts of town.  Another thing many restaurants do that I find annoying is seat you RIGHT on top of another table even though there are many others available!  I know this helps the server maintain his/her section, but it's annoying to overhear the next table's conversations when I don't NEED to!  Please take note of this, PJ. : )  Other than that, this place is awesome and we look forward to riding our bikes down here to HH."}
{"text":"I've always heard of hummus and this place but never thought once to give either a serious try. I stumbled in because a friend referred a girlfriend and she wanted to try (thank you Janae).   This particular location isn't much on the outside but has a pretty cool environment inside and on the patio especially at night.   It's always lively and a little loud, which I love. The waiters/waitresses don't have uniforms so it's got a pretty laid back feel to it.   This place isn't just a cool nice hangout though, the food is delicious. At first I was apprehensive to try hummus but I tried both red and green with pita chips which are great themselves (I'll get to those next). My favorite is the red hummus but the green is very refreshing.   You've got to try the pita chips, I always see them in the bag at grocery stores and never tried them and still haven't till this day because I'm afraid they won't match the taste/texture of Pita Jungle's. I always get them when I go, a must. They offer them baked or fried.   The portions for each meal are pretty good size so expect to take some home. Oh and try the chicken chipotle pizza! It's to die for.    The bad:   I've gone to the Tempe location twice now and coincidentally got pretty bad stomachache and ended up hurling both times. It seemed a little dirtier than others but it didn't deter me from going to the other locations because I simply love their food.   Five stars because the environment is nice and the food is even better."}
{"text":"**Vegetarian Friendly** So many vegetarian options, that I didn't know how to pick! I made it in time for happy hour, and it's a great happy hour! Tons of their appetizers in tapas form ranging from $1-2.   Tapa: Hummus Trio Plate of traditional, roasted red pepper and jalapeno cilantro hummus. All of which were fantastic! I really enjoyed the freshness of the cilantro.   Tapa: Garlic Dip Not sure what this was made of, but it was just as delicious as the hummus! Not too overpowering of a garlic.  Tapa: Falafel Comes with two falafels, and they were perfectly crispy. I really enjoyed these with the hummus trio.   Entr√©e: Red Quinoa with Cilantro Jalapeno Hummus Such a light and healthy salad, yet filling enough for dinner because of the hummus. I wish they had pita chips on the side instead of blue corn chips, but it was still delicious! They also have an entire section of vegetarian sides to complement your entr√©e.   Also, great service! My waiter (Derek) was phenomenal. Very attentive, polite and great at making recommendations, and everything was with a smile on his face. I truly appreciate great service at a restaurant. Overall, cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"We happened to walk past this place after seeing a moive and the aroma got our attention.  I had the salmon and grilled veggies (best thing I ate on the whole trip to AZ) my husband had the gyro (he won't stop taking about it). So yeah we highly suggest everyone try it. We ate outside, very friendly service. Everyone seemed to like working there. Next time we come I'm trying the hummus (heard it was amazing)"}
{"text":"Pita Jungle is one of my favourite places to eat. The fruit Fantasia is outstanding, however, food safety and hygiene are very important to me because who wants to get sick right? What I observed Sunday night was disgusting. The person that prepares the salads did, in fact, have his gloves on but he consistently rubbed his nose, ears and beard \"with the same gloves\" and proceeded back to doing what he was doing. Nice!  I won't go back to this location and candidly, if any restaurant does this I won't go back regardless how good the food is.  Yuk!"}
{"text":"I love Pita Jungle sooo much!  I go for the hummus alone, but everything else I've ordered has been fabulous.  The lentil fatoosh salad is my favorite menu item (besides the hummus trio), but the last three times I've had a special....the red quinoa salad.  OMG.  Best. Salad. Ever.  I crave this salad.  I wish they'd add it to their regular menu."}
{"text":"I just love Pita Jungle!  First time to this location and I was surprised to see some different items on the menu.  I was especially happy to see the Cilantro Hummus with Red Quinoa as a regular menu item because at Gilbert location this is a special once in a while and I always order it when it is.  That said, this location was great!  Nice decor, great service.  We sat at the bar and the bartender was so nice.  He let me sample different wines and then when we told him that we wouldn't be boxing up our leftovers because we were going to be walking around the art festival for a couple hours, he told us he could put it in his fridge and we could pick it up when we were headed home.  I've never had a restaurant say they could hold on to our leftovers before.  Food was amazing as always.  Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"I ordered chicken and hummus to go as I had just gotten off a flight from San Jose.  My expectations would have been the norm which consisted of fresh moist chicken with regular and spicy hummus. Unfortunately, The chicken was subpar. It looked like dog food from out of the can and a few chunks of chicken which were not fresh. I expected freshness as the time was approximately 1 o'clock in the afternoon, with a full house of customers. Most of the pieces were hard and rubbery and the rest of it just tasted old.  The hummus was fine, just as my palate craved it.   I was disappointed and contemplate going back to Pita Jungle.  If I decide to go back it would be for something other than chicken."}
{"text":"This place has gone down hill. It used to be better but it now seems just like any old chain restaurant. From food quality to cleanliness, everything is suffering. Bummer!"}
{"text":"Oh, Pita Jungle!  Dining in or carry out, I have never been dissatisfied!  It is so wonderful to find a quick, inexpensive, healthy meal, especially when pressed for time and needing to call in an order to be picked up.  The chicken Philly pita with a side of tzaziki rocks my world!"}
{"text":"4 years ago I had a pretty ugly experience at this particular location and never returned again until a few weeks ago.  Kevin reached out kindly asking me to give him the opportunity to correct this and I have to say, I was extremely impressed that he cared enough to take this leap despite it happening 4 years ago.    Kevin was great and it's because of him and the bar tender at the time and how considerate they were that I'm changing this to a 3 Star review from a 1. I'll be honest, I wasn't too keen on the shift manager Mike, he clearly didn't see the value in what Kevin was trying to achieve.  The bar tender who took my order was lovely and I definitely appreciated his understanding."}
{"text":"After several tries, we are finally giving up. We were seated in close proximity to everyone else. I know this is done sometimes to help the servers. But since we hardly saw ours, it wasn't worth sitting at a tiny table with people on either side of us. There wasn't enough room at the table for the appetizer we ordered and our entree plates. Some of the food is consistently good, but other items are disappointing. The many, many bussers didn't think to clear our empty plates. Our server was very friendly, but we only saw her once, and then had to flag her down to pay our bill. Inconsistent food and crowded seating will keep us from coming back. We will head over to the Chandler location for the quality and service we've come to expect from Pita Jungle."}
{"text":"Love the food...but was disappointed that there was no apology for the plastic lids in the bottom of my to-go soup.  Sent an email to corporate suggesting the \"new location\" needed a reminder to look before you fill."}
{"text":"I went to Pita Jungle the night before the PF Chang's Rock n Roll Arizona Half. My friend was very insistent that she wanted Mediterranean food, and this was close to my hotel, so here we went.   The restaurant decor was interesting with a lot of mismatched furniture. It had bright colors and artwork throughout.  We were seated quickly and had a friendly waitress. We ordered the hummus trio for four of us, which was delish and devoured the whole thing. The cilantro jalape√±o was a favorite of ours--very flavorful, but not too spicy.  The menu is quite extensive, but also confusing. The pita wraps, sandwiches and it wasn't really clear how they were the same or different.  Portions were very large. I had ordered a tahini cauliflower side to my pita wrap (chicken shwarma) and probably didn't need it.   I almost felt like this was the \"cheesecake factory\" of mediterranean restaurants. It had a large menu with a lot of things, and really large portions. It was good, but not amazing or unique. Also, when I looked up the nutrition information online after, it seems that they had taken what is normally a very healthy cuisine and \"americanized\" it and made it really calorie dense and heavier :("}
{"text":"Wow, this new location is a huge improvement over the old. I came back here for the cilantro jalapeno hummus, which was memorable from my visit last year. The new location has a much less eclectic, more classy look.  Surprisingly, on a Saturday night, we were seated quickly. The restaurant was busy, but not packed and the ambiance wasn't too loud. We had an awesome server who did a great job of checking in and staying on top of things (I wish I remembered his name!).  The menu is more simple and easier to navigate than I remember. We started with the aforementioned cilantro jalapeno hummus. My friend got the salmon burger, which he really enjoyed and I got the red quinoa with cilantro jalapeno hummus, which was basically quinoa with greens on the awesome hummus. I also got a side chicken breast.  Iced teas were continuously refilled (in these huge tumblers). We finished off with the rice pudding, which was also great.  Fabulous experience all around! I'd definitely come back if I'm in the area again."}
{"text":"Love the good and the ambiance. Service can be a little slow, but friendly. Today was very fast, despite only two servers on, but it was a slow time of day."}
{"text":"Best Pita Jungle in town. Brunch was awesome! Whole wheat pancakes, mimosas, and basic pita omelette all were delicious."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Pita Jungle.  We ordered several appetizers and samples each of them.  The food was incredible and the service was spot on. Definitely returning to this location again in the near future... and will be asking for Lisa!!!"}
{"text":"Great hummus! The chicken and hummus is my favorite!  Service is pretty good and prices are slightly high."}
{"text":"I hate doing this, but after Pita Jungle being one of my favorite restaurants in the Valley for years, I think I'm giving up on them.   Let me preface this review by saying that I've likely been to this Pita Jungle about 50 times over the course of three years or so.  At one point I was going once a week because it's near my office and has a great selection of vegetarian items. I love the lentil fatoush salad, the cilantro hummus, the soups....and that CAULIFLOWER! But the inconsistency as of late has brought me to this 3-star review today.  Today we ordered take-out from the office at 12:40 using their online ordering system. The system told me it would be ready at 1:15 at the latest. I arrived at 1:15 to pick up my 2 items (one of which was tabouleh - come on!) and they weren't ready. I waited another 10 minutes and finally said something to the gal and she went to the kitchen to retrieve my order. No apology, nothing. Just, \"Here. Do you need any napkins or utensils?\"   I got back to the office and couldn't wait to tear into my tabouleh salad, which comes with hummus and pita. What I found was a giant container of hummus with a scoop of tabouleh on top. Really? I thought it was supposed to be the other way around? So I unwrap my COLD pitas (which are usually toasty and warm) and started dipping into my hummus salad. Now I feel gross, because I just basically ate a plate of hummus for lunch.  The food and service use to be so consistent, but recently the food is practically a 50/50 gamble. And the service even more so. The manager (I'm guessing since he was the only one in a dress shirt and pants) was behind the counter when I was paying and didn't even make eye contact with me let alone greet me. I've seen him there MANY times and I would have thought he'd recognize me by now.  I feel like each time I go i get a different version of my favorite dishes. Lentil fatoush used to be my fave and the last five times I have told myself that the recipe I make it home is better. And it's not $10 when I make it at home.   Sorry PJ, but I think I'm breaking up with you. *sigh*"}
{"text":"I like PJ, the hummus platter is always a winner.  For some reason though this location lacks some jazzzzz that the other location on Scottsdale and Shea seems to have.  How can that be explained?!?!  Same menu, same food but somehow not the same. We do come here since the location is convenient but every time I sit down, I can't  seem to help myself and  compare this PJ to the OTHER PJ.  I know, I'm so unfair. Well, good thing sushi station is next door as that seems to be where I've been gravitating towards lately!"}
{"text":"l LOVE PITA JUNGLE. Jen Allen is my favorite waitress there.  She always get my order right and makes great recommendations... like the Greek pita bread...mmmmm"}
{"text":"Food was delicious. Service was very slow. If we ever crave Pita Jungle again, we will defintely do take out instead."}
{"text":"Shmeh.  Pita Jungle (pronounced hoon-glay...kidding, not really) is an area standard in many respects, but when looked at objectively, it's kind of a mish mosh.  And a mediocre one at that.  Don't get me wrong - the food isn't bad.  It's just that if you are jonesing for anything Mediterranean, this is not your place.  The menu is loosely inspired by mid east cuisine, but really, it's more of an upscale, continental restaurant with hummus barely wafting through the air.  Chicken in any form is well-seasoned and moist, baba ghanoush is toothsome, as is hummus, though not better than Trader Joe's, sadly.  Taboule used poorly chopped curly parsley (really, that stuff should be reserved for garnishes and nothing else - flat parsley is the way to go) and was a little underdressed.  Hubby's salmon was fishy and tasted like it hadn't been seasoned.  Underwhelming all in all.  That all being said, with the lake view, well-appointed decor, modern art slicked walls, live music and potent drinks, this place is more of a spot for sipping and nibbling than tucking into generous plates of mideast fare.  Maybe they should call it the Pita Lounge (minus the pita)."}
{"text":"I eat here more than anywhere else.  The variety in flavors combined with the quality of food is excellent!  The Cilantro Jalapeno Hummus is a must to start.  For entree's I love the Chicken Del Sol, Glazed Chicken Lavosh Pizza, Mahi Mahi with pita chips and they usually have great specials.  For price, flavor and variety, I can't think of a better place."}
{"text":"Customer service is always an A+! My husband and I come in a lot! They have our drink order down as well as our food order!! Super friendly and they always cater to our needs! We love this pita jungle!!"}
{"text":"Usually the Pita Jungle around the valley are very helpful and on sight. If you come during lunch hours you will see the entire staff on their lunch break and nearly impossible to come order To-Go Food. I would highly recommend driving another 5-10 to a Pita Jungle with someone who seems to be taking their job/career seriously."}
{"text":"This place is a long time favorite and the location for this restaurant is very nice. You can get a table on the back covered patio by the lake. Love the cilantro hummus with grilled chicken, coconut curry soup, greek salads (add gyro meat) and the salmon dinner or salad."}
{"text":"I love Pita Jungle and have been a loyal customer for over ten years but this is the worst location. I will never be back to this one, ever. It is NOT ALLERGY FRIENDLY, so watch out if you have food allergies. Let's start with parking here being a complete nightmare and then this restaurant being cramped and noisy. It's always been my least favorite but I was at work and needed to pick up a to-go order.  First they are way understaffed and the poor girl doing to-go could not keep up with all the people waiting to place and pick-up orders along with the phone orders that came in non-stop. I placed my to-go order for a salmon salad which I eat frequently and just had last week at the Mesa location. I have a dairy allergy and have never experienced an issue with this order. I mean I eat Pita Jungle several times a month and I know what is safe. The girl tells me the salmon specifically takes 25-30 minutes and I say ok, I'll wait. I just thought they were overly busy because I can pick up this same salad from the Mesa location and they have it ready in less than 10 minutes. My order is ready and I check it to be sure they included the dressing and I realize there is white stuff all over it. Feta cheese? WHY? Seriously this salad does not come with feta cheese. The girl informs me that they changed their menu at this location ONLY. Um how can you be an allergy friendly restaurant but allow one chain to make up their own recipes for the same salad? That's not safe!!! Especially when the allergen guide on the Pita Jungle website says that this salad does not contain dairy. The girl says don't worry I'll have them remake it. So she brings out my salad and I head back to work. Then I realize that they took my piece of salmon and the 2 dressing cups out of the feta cheese salad and put it in a new plain salad. So there was still feta cheese all over the bottom of the salmon and the dressing cups, which got all over the new salad. I threw my salad out. No lunch. Seriously I've never been so disappointed in the service I've received from any restaurant."}
{"text":"Food is great, love it love it love it.  The Philla Steak Pita, the hummus, the mediterranean chicken salad, gotta love it.  Wait staff on the male side is total eye candy, however, can't say I'm impressed by being called dude.  My waiter need some listening skills as he forgot my soda until I reminded him for the 2nd time.  Maybe cuz it was cuz he was giving elevator eyes to customers and staff.  Would give this place more but think the male wait staff needs to come down to earth a bit so we can at least have a decent conversation....dude."}
{"text":"We visited on Sunday, June 19th at 5:00 p.m.  This was the first time my dinner companion has eaten at Pita Jungle; I've eaten at this location numerous times.  The service and food were OUTSTANDING - as normal!    We started by ordering several items from the Tapas menu - it was Happy Hour and the prices were an excellent value!  We ordered the Falafel, Garlic Lemon Chicken & Pine Nuts, Hummus Trio, Mediterranean Olives, Pita with Thyme & Olive Oil and the Shrimp in Ajo Sauce.  The portion sizes are geared to one person - but are a great value.  All items had a beautiful presentation and were delicious.    The tapas alone were probably enough; however, my companion ordered the Philly Steak Pita and I ordered the Pita Crisp (added Gyro).  Both were very delicious as was the Turtle Cheesecake.  Great Service - Delicious Food - Great Value!"}
{"text":"Date of Visit:  01.06.17 at 1:00 p.m.  Server:  Christi (tall, blondish hair, lots of visible tattoos).  My 'home' Pita Jungle is the one on 7th Street.  This is my second visit to this particular location (Tatum) as I had lunch with a friend who works in a building located in this complex.  Food:  I had the Beef Gyro pita and my friend had two sides (Lentils with Rice and Grilled Veggies).  The food was good and was consistent with other meals we've had at the 7th Street location.  Service:  not good at all - poor!  Think of the interaction you have at most drive-thru fast food restaurants and this is the level of service we received from Christi.  She was very short and to the point - no customer engagement, no smile.  When she initially came to our table, she did introduce herself - but just kind of going through the motions.  We placed our drink order and I stated we wanted an order of the Pita Chips and asked what type of dips were available.  Christi responded by pointing to the Starter section of the menu and said to the effect that 'all of these are dips, just pick one'.  It was obvious that - at least on this day - she was not in the mood to provide a great (heck, even half-way good) customer service experience.  We ordered the appetizer and also our meals at that time.  Our drinks were brought to us by a different person, our appetizer was brought to us by another person, and our lunch was brought to us by another person.  Christi reappeared towards the end of our meal and filled our tea and then came back with the check.  This is where it gets interesting.  Paying Cash - Be Aware:  The bill total was $29.69.  I'm 95% sure (well, more than that but there is always a chance) that I placed a $20 bill, two $5 bills and four $1 bills ($34.00) in the cover.  My friend and I discussed the tip amount as we are both typically generous tippers but felt that the lack of customer service from Christi did not warrant more than $4.00 and change.  Christi came to retrieve the cover and stated that she would be right back - told her that there was no change necessary.  We continued to chat and finish our tea.  After about 5 minutes, Christi reappeared, laying the cover on the table, opening it and stating that we had not put enough cash in to cover our bill and then she just walked away.  Looking at the bills in the cover, there was a total of $29.  My friend and I looked at each other in amazement.  I felt like I had been ripped off (now there is that small chance that I mentioned earlier that I was wrong - but very, very small).  I asked for a manager and Jeff came to our table.  He approached and I said that we had not had a great service experience and his exact response was 'Oh really?' and in a tone as if he did not believe me. I explained our experience - both the lack of customer service and the payment issue.  I stated that I wanted to count the payment in front of him and for him to take the payment so there were no further cash mishaps.  I counted $32.00 and gave it to him - stating that there was a very, very small chance that my first count was incorrect and that we were only leaving $2.00+ tip based on our experience.  The initial response from Jeff was to state that he was sorry and that I did not have to leave the $2.00 tip if I felt the service was bad.  He kept repeating that verbiage - did not have to leave the $2.00 tip.  I felt as if Jeff was really not concerned about our experience and commented to him that I would be emailing the corporate office and posting my experience on Yelp.  At this point, he apologized several times and asked us to come back again to give them another try, etc.  He continued to state that I did not have to leave the $2.00 tip.  It's interesting to note that he never introduced himself; it was only after I asked his name did he tell us it was Jeff.  I'm not going to starve or miss a mortgage payment because of $5.00 - it's the principle.  There were more customer centric responses that Jeff could have offered to include reducing the bill by $5.00 or take a % off the bill due to the lack of service that we expressed.  I normally pay with credit card (love the Amex points) but have occasionally paid with cash - using this same procedure of including the tip amount in the cover initially so the server does not have to return to the table.  Going forward, I will only provide enough cash to cover the bill and then have the server return with the change and then leave the tip on the table.    This experience has left me not feeling good about visiting Pita Jungle again - I know I will never go back to the Tatum location.   I've always gotten great service (and posted on Yelp) from the 7th Street location and at some point, I may return to that location."}
{"text":"I love Pita Jungle! I have been here several times and never disappointed.     As an appetizer I love the Spanikopita and highly recommend it.  I also recommend the hummus, fresh and delicious.   I have a hard time choosing an entree because they have so many good options and I am a vegetarian so having options is fantastic.  I particularly like their falafel hot pita.  Getting some of the yogurt sauce on the side makes it even better!  Good portions.  I can't wait to try their pizza's as they sound fabulous.    I love their iced teas as well, I don't even have to add sweetener even though they seem to be unsweetened.  What I also like is they give you the option to take a refill in a to go cup!  I never had a problem with the service at all and it is very reasonably priced!  They have a kids menu also for those who need it."}
{"text":"Oh how I wish these were in California!!!  I visit my best friend in AZ a couple times a year and everytime I'm there I beg her to take me to Pita Jungle.  I have to say the one in Chandler is my all time the favorite.  The atmosphere is hip, the service is awesome and the outside area backs up to a lake.  It so nice and peaceful to sit outside, watch the ducks and eat their cilantro jalapeno hummus!  Everything I've had at this place is delicious.  The gyros are made with just the right amount of tzazkiki sauce, the hummus is smooth and creamy and EVERY flavor is a must try.  I tried the mediterranean chicken salad just this last weekend and my taste buds were in heaven!  So lemo juice, feta and pine nuts took the salad over the top.  Now if we could only convince the owners to branch out to California, say Westlake or Thousand Oaks area I bet these would take off.  With all us health food nuts out here we would appreciate the good food!  :)"}
{"text":"Found a surprising little fact if you are in a brunch mode. They have great bloody Mary's! A stealthy fun day drinking spot. Most come for the hummus but come and have some chicken and hummus or garlic dip. Great menu. Fun beer selection."}
{"text":"Reliable, tasty food, good prices, great for groups.   Since I moved downtown in 2010, I have frequented the location of PJ quite often.  This location does not take reservations, but I have been with groups of 7 to 25 people, and they were reasonable and helped us find tables together.  Or, there's a large table towards the front where large groups can sit together.  I had a graduation party there, meetups, and birthday parties with excellent service. The wait staff doesn't hover and make us feel like we have to leave immediately after eating.   Food: Hummus is ok, soups are usually quite tasty. The happy hours specials are nice.  The veggie wrap is usually very good but have ordered a few that were bland.    Service: Usually quite efficient and helpful. Sometimes a table may have one server and multiple individuals coming by with food, but I have not had any issues.  They also don't make us feel like we need to leave ASAP if we are just chatting or hanging out.   Atmosphere: This location is surprisingly not busy as often as I thought it'd be.   There is an outdoors patio, nice in the spring and winter.  The inside has booths and tables, plus a bar area."}
{"text":"I'm just not a fan of this place. I wanted to like it, I came 3 or 4 times trying different things off the menu - veggie burgers, salad, pitas - but just wasn't impressed. I love the healthy concept but the flavor just isn't there."}
{"text":"I cannot think of any place better when it comes to Mediterranean .. bang for bucks spent ..all vegetarian recipes are amazing  My all time fave !"}
{"text":"The food here is so delicious it saddens me that I don't live closer. There are plenty of options to choose from on the menu, many of which are vegetarian--most of which can be made vegan. There's not much of that in the West Valley, so that makes it all the better. A standard meal will start at just above eight dollars; I especially recommend the portobello mushroom burger! Servers are always kind and willing to accommodate, so no worries there. I've never gone and not been seated immediately, and the restaurant itself doesn't feel cramped. It's the sort of restaurant I definitely enjoy defaulting to, and I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Even at 2 pm very crowded!  Waitstaff not too thrilled to be working today...or just not thrilled I ordered water?!?  Either way, sub par service at this restaurant. Still love the food. They did not have my favorite red quinoa salad on the menu here.  So, I had to make a break for it & go to one that has it!"}
{"text":"Smaller than the typical store but great service.  Had somethings not in the regular menu - red quinoa salad w/ cilantro jalape√±os hummus (served w/ pita or blue corn chips).  Really hope this is available at all of the stirs soon because it is really yummy!  Crave it when I'm not able to get it!  Also love the Moroccan gazpacho - spring for the avocado add-on; hope this stays and isn't just a summer soup special. (Can make it myself but it's always better when they do it!)"}
{"text":"I love this place..something for everyone. For Garlic Lovers - the garlic dip will NOT disappoint. You will ward off all vamps guaranteed. Philly cheesesteak/chicken lovers...unforgettable. Lemon chicken salad amazing (HUGE grilled  chicken strips), tuna pizza..odd maybe..but delicious all the same. Need I go on? .the only thing i didn't care for was the veggie burger oddly enough. For an exceptional veggie burger I would steer you towards Four Peaks Brewery. But other than that they are spot on everytime all the time. Can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"For starters, I love Pita Jungle and although the food here is top notch the service is annoyingly bad.   The past two times the servers have disappeared to that magical vortex called \"server land\".  Where on Earth do they disappear to ?   I'm not sure how there can be 5 people in the restaurant and the server(s) can't seem to handle it. At times there are servers walking around, literally right past your table, ignoring the fact that you've even sitting there for 10 minutes with a menu and they don't stop and ask if you need anything due to some strange server boundary rules.    \"Have you been helped yet?\" Seems to be a common theme in this location.    Long winded way of saying food 10, service 0."}
{"text":"What a fantastic find! Thank you E. for mentioning this place. We love it! Even their ketchup tastes yummy! Great atmosphere, great staff, great food, great music, great art! Can't wait to try more options there! Thank you Pita Jungle for making my taste buds and tummy so happy! Great for veggie friends and non veggie friends too! Not too expensive either :) Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Do not order from a delivery service, ie grubhub or yelp. I was really disappointed with the service. The order was picked up an hour later then it was made, and arrived soggy and cold. The manager reached out to me, but really didn't do anything about it, he took grubhubs side (I have the emails to prove his non caring attitude)...Just a warning, pick up on your own, cold and soggy is what you'll get if you use a service to deliver. I live 5 minutes from the restaurant, if I would have known it was going to be such an ordeal to deliver, I would have walked there. Terrible."}
{"text":"So glad this local spot is emerging to so-cal and they are getting a taste of a great Phoenix -Metro eatery. Pita alway is good ... and pardon me but, Phalene is just a gorgeous than life server."}
{"text":"Pita Jungle seems like a place I would like more, but I can't say it wow'd me. We actually came for the Happy Hour and that was the least impressive part of the entire meal.  Although the prices seem low, the portions are incredibly tiny and it adds up fast. The happy hour is good to try things I guess, but not great in terms of value like a happy hour should be. We tried the hummus trio, but the classic hummus was the favorite out of the group. We tried the falafel which were good but nothing out of this world.   The garlic shrimp were probably the best out of all the tapas and the mussels the least. The fresh mozzarella and tomato was totally not worth $2.50 and needed some sort of bread accompaniment. The baba ghanoosh I would not order again, and is usually one of my most favorite items in terms of middle eastern food. I would expect a place named pita jungle to excel on the items were ordered for tapas, but they did not.  The best part of the meal, which gave this place three stars instead of two was a surprise. We ordered Blue Corn Nachos which were delicious and a huge portion - quite frankly I would order these again and skip the whole tapas thing.   Never would I have though a nacho plate would be the shining star in a review for a place named Pita Jungle.   Service was ok, ambiance ok, but nothing spectacular."}
{"text":"Hummus is barely good if you have had any home made Hummus. Gyro meat is solid, but doesn't have the freshness. Pita bread is definitely old and unsavory. They should learn from some of the fine pita bread bakeries in Los Angeles. None of the food options stand out to me and I do love Greek food."}
{"text":"This was my first time going to Pita Jungle, though I've heard good things from my boyfriend's sister, who lives nearby. All in all, eating here was a pleasurable experience.   The food was non-greasy, and if you have kids the menu has good options for them to choose from. Plus, the happy hour here is great! (So, I've heard. Just by looking at the menu, I loved the prices.)   Our waiter, Anthony, was very helpful and checked on us often to make sure we were well taken care of.   As for food, we ordered starters: jalape√±o hummus, spanakopita, tzatziki, and the greek pita. Also, the mushrooms. Delicious!   Wish there was one of these near me in LA!"}
{"text":"I truly wish I could rate this location with more than five stars. Yelp's five star rating is described as \"Woohoo! As good as it gets\". Wrong. It is better than the best and it is all thanks to this location's GM, Mike, and the amazing team that he has put together. I know that this post is going to be long and most people only read the first few sentences so if those few lines are all you read, then you will be just fine knowing you will be taken care of at Pita Jungle off of Frank Lloyd Wright.   About a month ago, my fiance and I ordered take out and got a few miles down the road when I realized we didn't get what we ordered. We quickly turned around and explained what happened to the take out greeter and she called her manager over. This is where we met Mike. Mike apologized sincerely and had everything remade and told us to keep everything else and then, if that weren't enough, gave us a credit to come back and be his guest the next time for free. We were completely, and I mean completely, blown away by this customer service. Truly, we weren't angry at the wrong order, that happens, but he treated us like he had done us a true injustice and did everything he could to sincerely fix it. Having that mistake was the best thing to happen to us.   We went back tonight to have dinner and use our credit for free dinner. We sat with Delaney and asked to speak with Mike. No sooner that we asked, we saw Mike quickly walking with plates of food and basically running back and forth to the kitchen (I think a guest was complaining about their salmon not being charred enough... I saw the salmon... It was black... crazy people). He took the time to come to our table (almost out of breath but no matter, with a smile). I shook his hand and began to thank him for his hard work and dedicated demeanor and just explained how blown away we were by his hard work and commitment to customer service. He was sincerely grateful and we even talked a bit and got to know each other. He even invited us to be his guest AGAIN because we \"made his night\". We were blown away... Have I said this enough? The rest of the night was perfect, right on par. Food was delicious, prompt and hot. Delaney was attentive and really genuine.   Overall, we left there feeling like family, feeling like we have a lifelong friend in Mike. I do not take time to write reviews, EVER but this, this was something that I will be telling everyone for a very long time."}
{"text":"It took over 10 minutes to even get greeted. We watched people that sat down after us receive drinks and have an order taken before anybody showed up. Even after we had mentioned that we needed to see a server   Disappointing :( I'll go back in hopes that it was growing pains since it just opened. But....."}
{"text":"I like this location. I do sales in the area and it is always quick and affordable.  If I bring others to dine it is not as fast but you get good healthy food for an affordable amount. My customers seem to like it as well."}
{"text":"I am giving this location 5 stars for the exceptional customer service we received today. We ordered an early dinner via Grubhub. Opening our delivery bag we realized the store had forgotten to put the pita bread in for our appetizer. Impossible to eat without! We didn't have any crackers so we called to get a refund for the dish as we couldn't eat it. We were transferred to the manager who offered us a free entree but hey what we wanted was a refund as the appetizer tray was over $13. He actually came and delivered the pita bread and gave us a coupon for a free entree. That is real customer service and he should be applauded for this.  And the food was awesome too. We will be back!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to this location for years. I went to Israel in the summer of 2006 and when I came back to the states I refused to eat hummus because I didn't want to replace the memory of the amazing, authentic hummus I ate in Israel with some crappy hummus that you get in the grocery store.   I didn't have hummus for over a year until I discovered Pita Jungle. their hummus (all 3 kinds) is the most authentic that I've found outside of Israel and New York.   2 months ago I brought my roommate who professed to hate hummus to pita jungle. By the end of dinner she was stealing all my hummus.  Since the beginning of my interactions with pita jungle there is one thing that I have eaten the most frequently. The Fruit Fantasia (a plate of fruit and cheese) and the hummus starter. I'm going to let you in on a little secret: apples and hummus are delicious together.   For the more adventurous people reading this try dipping the banana and the cheeses in to the hummus as well. YUMMMMM!  The only reason why I give it a 4 is because they give less fruit and cheese than they used to. It used to be the best deal going because I could make 2 meals out of the platter for something like $8. Now it's $10 for the Fruit fantasia and I only get 1.5 meals out of it. Still worth it though.  Bonus points: They have many healthy options for those people who are trying to watch what they eat."}
{"text":"Gilbert Location. I usually go here about once a week.  The service is allways great,  and when you want a good healthy meal after working out, or a nice lunch on the weekend, this is the go to spot.  Their hummus is great, especially the jalepeno, and their chicken dishes are allways very satisfying.  Love the jungle :)"}
{"text":"Love this location! Try the pesto pizza! So yummy. I don't know what the use to season their chicken but it's like crack.   I love Pita Jungle!"}
{"text":"Pretty much our go to place in the area if we have 2 hours to kill, are relatively hungry for something that won't clog our arteries, and need to get our toddler out of the house.   Biggest complement I can give: Out-of-town in-laws here months ago, with a few of them pickier than your average bear (for glutein free, organic, etc). We met them here when they first arrived thinking this was the best bet for finding a good match for them, and they kept coming back for nearly every meal. Seems to be a little something for everyone, and we bring a lot of others here for a nice casual meal.  First off the service has always been outstanding. It's obvious they make a real effort to give a good experience, and bringing our little boy here isn't as much a chore as some other places. Very kiddo friendly, always lots of high chairs, by default they give crayons to the kiddies, and the kids menu doubles as an activity page (connect the dots, coloring, etc). Kids menu is also great, you get to choose one thing from each of 4 food groups-think we got mac&cheese, tofu, broccoli, and corn this last time.   Restaurant is bright and relatively clean, and when it's not scorching hot, the outdoor patio is a nice setting. Portions are Mucho large, we're usually taking something home for each of us for dinner. Food is above average, but some aspects are hit or miss (Lavosh bread wraps are too starchy for my taste). I'm a big fan of their flatbreads (especially Chicken Fetoosh) and some salads (Lentil Fetoosh, Falafel, not chicken pasta). Jalape√±o Cilantro hummus and most other hummus is a good bet, but the Ahi hummus misses the mark in my opinion. Pretty good handful of local beer options for a healthy place. Overall usually a positive experience, and we'll keep going back as the ol' local standard."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been going to ALL of Pita Jungle's locations for over 13 years and the consistency, friendly service and good food was always expected and delivered. Not once have we had a bad experience.  Love, love LOVE that Ahwatukee now has their own PJ with AMPLE OUTDOOR SEATING. Best place for fresh, crisp iced tropical tea or a glass of wine. Great art (often for sale) on the walls and delicious pitas... My fav's for lunch are the Chicken Philly Pita (ask them to add mushrooms if you like), the red pepper hummus plate, and the Lavosh Schawarma Wrap. For dinner, their fresh fish dishes are always prepared in some tasty, unique way...love the Mahi Mahi with Pita Chips and the Broiled Chicken Salad is huge and satisfying...yum! Desserts are very tasty too, if you have room for some Baklawa or Carrot Cake."}
{"text":"I love this Pita Jungle! I come here once a week on my lunch break and I always sit at the bar. Matt, who works the bar when I am there, is seriously amazing. He remembers what I drink, my name and it seems he is like that with everyone. Love him -he's super fast too, I don't know how he multi-tasks so well.    My food always comes quickly which is appreciated and it always tastes good! I would definitely recommend this location of Pita Jungle to anyone looking for fast service and great food."}
{"text":"I love Pita Jungle, fresh quality food that is consistently delicious! Thank you Pita jungle!"}
{"text":"I love pita jungle! Jalape√±o cilantro hummus with chicken! I ask for blue corn tortillas and vegetables to dip into my hummus. So many things are yummy! Ang the give me an ice tea cup to go! Thank you Pita Jungle, I'll keep coming back!"}
{"text":"Went into pita jungle tonight and had the worst service I had ever had. The only thing good was the friendly host who seated us. About 5 minutes later another host gave us a friendly welcome when he noticed we had not been greeted by our waiter, he said he would grab our server. Finally our server came over with water. He was extremely awkward. He did not give us any type of greeting at all. He didn't introduce himself (say his name), and he didn't ask how we were doing. All he said was \"would you want any other drinks\", so my friend asked for a guava lemonade and she tried to finish her sentence by telling him what she wanted to eat but he interrupted her by saying \"hold on\" and proceeded to check a table next to us to see if how they were doing. After being cut off my friend put in her order and I put mine in. All he said was \"okay\" and took our menus and left. When he brought back my friends guava lemonade he quickly dropped it off and walked away (it was not busy). Our food came quickly. He just dropped it off and left, didn't ask if we needed anything else. After that he didn't check up on us how we were doing, never refilled our cups. He awkwardly came out with the check, he didn't ask if we were splitting and when I asked him if he could split it he looked really confused. I repeated what I ordered and what my friend ordered to let him know how to split it and we had to tell him a couple more times. Keep in mind each of us only ordered two very small plates. He came back with the checks and of course handed us the wrong books( easily could have handed us the right ones by checking our orders that we recited to him 4 times). We put our cards in immediately, he picked up the tables books next to us and looked at ours and kept walking, my friend stopped him to hand it to him and he then took it. He came back and dropped it off he didn't say bye to us, and didn't tell us to have a good night. We had to figure out his name from the nice host( or busser not sure) who grabbed the waiter for us. His name was Nick, was wearing a ball cap, stripped grey shirt, and probably really new. Just hope he can improve so people don't get that service again."}
{"text":"The only reason this is getting 2/5 stars is because their food is good!.....SERVICE IS TERRIBLE! Manager and host staff could not get anything right after three times of sending the order back( w/no substitutions I might add!) Sending us away after an hour wait for a TO GO ORDER, w a 10%. Off our next entree!....In my opinion.....visit the other locations!"}
{"text":"Not great. It took 45 minutes for my food to completely come out (I just ordered hummus and pita) and the quality wasn't wonderful. I love Pita Jungle and am a regular customer but have not ventured to this specific location prior to this. The pita was hard as a rock. Sent it back. Took another 10 minutes for them to bring out more pita that was still hard. At the same time I ordered a side of pico (something that's usually on the hummus that I order) and they completely forgot about it until I flagged them down and asked again.   I feel bad because the servers are always so nice. At the same time, I didn't even know who my server was because the girl who was helping me the entire time was completely different from the girl who took my order and brought me my check. I was there for an hour. For hummus and some hard pitas.   Update: I've been to this Pita Jungle a couple more times since the review and they've made up for the original bad experience with great quality food and kind servers."}
{"text":"One of my favorite healthier restaurants in the valley!! Great food, great atmosphere and nice waiters. I always have a great experience here! I recommend trying the macro platter or spicy chicken pita"}
{"text":"Love me sme Greek! And pita jungle takes care of you. Their Greek salad is huge and it has the perfect amour of dressing an their pitas are warm and tasty. Tge wait staff is young and they have good rapport. It is nice to see them in street clothes, it makes it so it isn't stuffy. Pita Jungle is a great place for lich or dinner and e prepared because they get really busy!"}
{"text":"What a cool place to eat at, the humus is awesome and the food tastes very healthy and fresh. Very busy at night every time I've been there, so you may be doing a little waiting until your server gets to you. Prices are good and people are friendly and know the menu well."}
{"text":"I'd eaten at this location dozens of times until I started going to other Pita Jungle locations. This Pita Jungle has less then desirable service and the food is not as good as it is at other locations. However, I LOVE the hummus!  On the flip side, they have the best art at this location.  I always thought they should utilize their space a little more by having an open mic night, or just local musicians playing in the corner."}
{"text":"WOW!!! This Pita location truly Never disappoints! Loving the new menu specials and even more so the Amazing staff! I came in after an extremely tough day and Mark was truly AMAZING! Food is consistent and oh so Delicious!  I live downtown but I will Glady make the trip up north for the great service and taste I can count on! Well done Pita of North Scottsdale!  I will be back!"}
{"text":"(JUDGED SOLEY ON FALAFEL BALLS AND SERVICE) I really wanted to like this Pita Jungle and I did INITIALLY but they kept messing up. I will say, their staff in terms of servers are very nice; however, I'm an avid Falafel connoisseur and this place even offers happy hour and reverse happy hour where their falafels are BOGO, awesome deal right? WRONG! I received and even paid for 6 (bogo) BURNT falafel we didn't even really eat and definitely did not enjoy. Our 1st order they were so burnt and bitter we HAD to let our server know, she happily put in a new order for us so I was content. I overheard her ask the cooks however \"did you guys make these fresh?\" MEANING we probably got premade Falafel balls they reheated and that totally explained the burnt part until we got our 2nd order which were supposed to be non-burnt.... yeah nope. They were even more burnt than the first ones! They have an open kitchen and I'm bilingual- don't judge a book by its cover because their cooking didn't think to scope out their customers, I was sitting directly beside the kitchen and I can hear all the unnecessary, rude and explicit (Spanish profanity)  comments they were saying over having to make us new Falafels WHEN THEY WERE THE ONE WHO BURNT THEM IN THE 1st place! Never returning here again."}
{"text":"amazing gyros, amazing salads, amazing hummus, amazing green tea, amazing seasoned potatoes, great service"}
{"text":"Overall, I'd give this place a 5 star for fresh ingredients and taste, but I have to take away 1 star for its, errrr, pita?  Correct me if I'm wrong, but I found the pita to be a little dry and lacking in chewiness and since pita is the staple here, I just had to take away one star...  Otherwise, I'm sure the hummus would have been eaten completely instead of being enjoyed with a bag of Trader Joe's pita chips a few hours later (delicious!)..  Fresh tasty  food & I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Another great meal at pita jungle. So far I have never had a bad meal & I'm usually at one of these place twice a week. The jalape√±o hummus should be illegal for being so delicious. The chicken is so yummy, I get it every meal in some form. The green tea is the best I have ever had. Keep up the great food pita jungle I am hooked."}
{"text":"This place has a ton of options, I never would have tried this place based on the name alone but it was a suggestion of a co-worker of mine. I was actually surprised at the menu. Tons of Mediterranean type options. I like the vegetarian choices. The service was decent."}
{"text":"I was suprised at how much is on the menu. I was just expecting pita wraps and that is not the case. They have a pasta dish and hummus and all sorts of good stuff. I ordered the hot Philly Steak pita with onions and green peppers  for $6.95. It was so good and i cant wait to go back to get it again.. I always worry about getting philly steak sandwiches cause I love them but some places dont trim the meat real well and you get lots of fat on the meat. Not this place, no fat on this pita. My friend got the California Club cold pita which was $7.95. It was  huge and she had to take half of it home. It came with a side of cucumber sauce. That sauce is delicious. I love this place and cant wait to try some of the other items on the menu. The best part was I left saticfied and perfectly full. We were quick to be seated and the food came out quick as well."}
{"text":"What I really like about Pita Jungle is that the veggies in the food are always so fresh.  I had a salmon salad today that had cucumbers, tomatoes, red bell peppers and was topped with their delicious lemon dressing that makes the salad taste so fresh and bright.  We also got a large order of the cilantro jalapeno hummus that I could sit and eat with a spoon it is so dang good.  I absolutely love their fresh squeezed lemonade.  They have about 6 taps for beer and all but one of them (Bud Light...ewww)  looked like it was a rotating tap that changes when the keg blows.   The have fantastic gyros that are actually very well priced.  If you are in the mood for some medditteranean appetizers, come during happy hour."}
{"text":"This location has really upped the cool factor for all other Pita Jungles out there.  They hired an LA based graffiti artist to tag the walls in virtually every area of the restaurant.  Check out the men's restroom door; very clever.  The outdoor patio and multiple bar areas are great for busy nights.  I would love to see them up the caliber of their beer selection like some other locations have.  The only real \"craft\" selection they have is Ballast Point Sculpin, and, let's be honest, they just sold out for 1 billion dollars.  So come on, Pita Jungle.  Expand that craft beer selection.  I did love the wine on tap, including the wine that I enjoyed that gave all the profits to autism research.  Very cool.  The cilantro lime hummus is my favorite appetizer anywhere.  They had specially made olive oil and balsamic vinegar to eat with it as well that tasted amazing.  The bar service was fantastic.  Let's hope this doomed space finds it's permanent resident with Pita Jungle!"}
{"text":"I have been to different pita jungles before a few times but this one tops the rest.   The overall vibe of this place was spectacular. The waitress we had was one of those few that you just feel comfortable with. She also was on top of our requests by brining the check right in time.   The food, as usual, was delicious. Now I have the habit of getting the same thing every time, but how can you refuse the Mediterranean Chicken Salad? I did get a taste of on of their cold soups. It was described as almost a salsa flavor, but was so much  more than that. The flavors here are always on point.   Make sure the try the ice tea here. No sugar needed as it has the right kind of flavor to appeal to the masses sugar free! Not bitter but still tastes like something.   I feel like this location will become my new favorite spot."}
{"text":"Love Pita Jungle.  Everything on the menu delivers and the atmosphere is great.  Try the hummus with broiled chicken or the glazed chicken lavosh pizza.  Both are consitent hits.    The casual atmosphere fits for visits with friends, dinner with the family, or a business meeting."}
{"text":"I've never had a bad experience with a Pita Jungle location, but this one is my favorite by far. I love the patio all year round and the staff is the best."}
{"text":"This place was great! Local beers great hummus (we got the jalapeno cilantro). I got the Spanikopita and it was some of the best I've ever had. Then I got the chicken shwarma pita absolutely to die for. Friendly staff clean environment. Tables are a little small for the large plates however. I will absolutely be back!!"}
{"text":"Pita jungle is one of those special restaurants that make me feel great once I walk in. Instead of all the employees wearing a company outfit, they rather wear everyday clothes which I feel makes it feel less corporate and more relaxing and enjoyable. Not to mention all the servers have a great personality. Moving on, the food is incredible, they have food that everyone will atleast like one of the many choices. I truly recommend this place for not only the service, food, but also the prices, its very reasonable for everything you pay for."}
{"text":"Not Your Typical Pita Jungle  I sadly have to say I agree with the other reviewers who were disappointed with their experiences here.  I suggested returning there this evening but my husband turned it down, too, after our initial try a couple of months ago where we were pretty much ignored when we walked in before the hostess sauntered up to station, more or less grunted at us and we followed her to a table that was thisclose to the one next to us.  The atmosphere was not at all like any of the other PJs at which we've dined - sterile looking, dismal and dingy - my husband's main reason for passing it up this evening.  Plus the wait for service and our courses was fairly long.  Nothing impressive to consider returning although in all fairness for a proper review, I suppose we ought to consider doing so.  In their defense, they're a new establishment and perhaps working on getting some kinks out. Still doesn't make up for the decor and uncomfortable feeling of sitting in such close proximity to other diners."}
{"text":"This place is recommendable and this place is commendable. Not only is the food healthy but it's tasty and scrumptious too! The service is great!"}
{"text":"Good food, good service, great atmosphere.  I would recommend this place.  They have options for vegans which is great.  I needed a place to take my vegan mother and this place was perfect.  They have a pretty good selection of meals.  The Beef Gyro was good and their Black Bean Burger was pretty delish too.  Love love loved the hummus (garlic-y) and their tea is super good too. Go here!"}
{"text":"Pita Jungle has a great atmosphere, good service, excellent food.   I recommend the hummas and the chicken schwarma is my favorite thing to order. It is very reasonably priced and an excellent place to eat."}
{"text":"Great food, a little bit pricy for my liking but not anything overwhelming. The hummus and pita bread are awesome. My wife and I go here when we want something a little bit more fresh and light weight than our normal restaurant picks. Just be prepared to see a bunch if hipsters covered in tattoos and in jean shorts as the wait staff. It took me by surprise the first time I went in."}
{"text":"Coming to the Pita Jungle was like going to an upscale hipster restaurant. Everyone who works there is a hipster, but it's got this nice clean vibe with comfy chairs and large windows to balance out the coolness of this place. The tall ceilings make it seem larger than it really is and it's one of those joints that it wasn't what you expected when you walked in. I was expecting a sit-down place with such a cool reserved atmosphere. But it is and I totally dig it.  Having never been here before, the menu was overwhelming! I love Med./Middle Eastern type food a lot and this place had everything from falafel to spanakopita to gyros to baba ganoush and baklava. It was like a dream come true. Our server was of great help to me as I couldn't even decided between three or four dishes! She gave me a few suggestions and I ended up with the falafel pita. My friend got the veggie burger.  The portions are absolutely huge so even though you might be paying a slightly higher price, I took part of mine home to warm up later. The falafel was aboslutely delicious with such great texture balancing the crispiness of the falafel with the softness of the pita bread with a great crunch from the veggies all with an amazing sauce (not sure?!). I was in heaven for a while, which is totally fine for me. My friend really enjoyed her veggie burger and I sampled the potatoes. They were good but I really like Greek potatoes and would have like to seen something a bit more like that. All in all, I thought it was a great experience and it seems like the locals like this place. If I ever come back to Phoenix, I would definitely come back here!"}
{"text":"Food is good, service is also good. A group of us met here for a work day lunch and our food was presented to the table really fast.  However, while we were sitting at the table our conversation started about how we could not tell the staff from the patrons. In fact the patrons were dressed better than the staff. No shirts that say \"Pita Jungle\"and in some instances the waitress's had barely any clothes on at all. This is Scottsdale! not a beach hut and a stripper lounge. We were somewhat turned off by all the skin, tattoos, butt cheeks and camel toes. C'mon management bring some class to the joint."}
{"text":"Yes, it is cool to have a pita jungle in the mall. The falafels are good, as is the chicken and hummus. However, I asked for no onions and got a LOT of them, all the pitas were cold and so hard they hurt to chew, and the girl who took our order was cold and expressionless. I prefer the restaurant locations."}
{"text":"Love it.. Been eating it since 1995. Spicy chicken wrap, Mediterranean pasta salad, hummus, curry chicken salad"}
{"text":"Came back to Pita Jungle after several years (bad previous experience caused me to stay away). Took the chance and came back again. Ordered the Pesto Lavash Pizza and it was delicious. It was a bit pricey for what I got but tasty nonetheless. The reason why I give it a 3/5 is because service was less than stellar. Co-worker had to wait like 20 minutes to get his order taken since it came after I did.  All in all would come back again but will try for an earlier time slot to avoid the slow customer service."}
{"text":"Salmon dinner with spinach and mash potatoes are to die for...Salmon is so juicy! I cant bring myself to venture away from it"}
{"text":"Ate with some coworkers at this Pita Jungle. Ordered the hummus platter which was actually pretty good (although the pita themselves weren't warmed at all and actually felt crunchy in some pieces which really shouldn't happen). I ordered the Chicken Lavash flat bread and was really not impressed. My chicken was over cooked and dry and the flatbread was super crunchy (almost like a tortilla chip). There was zero flavor/sauce which made it taste even worse. In the end, I only had about half (since I was hungry) and did not ask for a box. Overall, not a good experience and will likely not return. Pita Jungle really needs to up their game."}
{"text":"So I have been to this place quite a few times, and seeing that I life right around the corner it's very convenient for me and the food has always been great. The reverse happy hour is my favorite time to go because it's great food at a great price ($2 per item). The last few times I have been there I sat at the bar and had the best service ever from a waitress by the name of Jaclyn. Not only was she easy on the eyes but her service and attention to detail was top notch. We had great conversation the entire time but it certainly didn't take away from the other patrons that were sitting at the bar. They got the same level of service that I was receiving. All in all this place is great and if you go sit at the bar or ask for Jaclyn, it will be the best service you get."}
{"text":"I was warned that their happy hour app. would be small.  I just had no idea how small.   Thinking that I had already eaten a taco for dinner, and might be getting some more tacos later (what can I say, I like tacos...), I thought the sauteed mushrooms would be enough to hold me over.   Sadly, no, no, it did not.  There might have been 5 actual mushrooms in the dish. It was served on what I can only perceive as a sauce plate. I probably consume more wasabi on an average sushi meal than the size of that plate.   It made for a very sad customer (well, I was warned), but at least the story ended up happily with me getting more tacos somewhere else."}
{"text":"Dont get me wrong, the food here is great. We love it.   The service... not. We've been to this location twice, and both times we were lucky if we could find our server to bring more drinks or pita bread for our appetizer, and we were lucky to get our food within that timeframe, too. We were completely neglected for most of our experience, only had a group of 4-5 people, and they were not even at full capacity.   Would love to return, but would hate to receive this horrible service yet again."}
{"text":"Yummy!  They don't offer a traditional kabob which is disappointing but the food is delicious nonetheless! The saut√©ed mushrooms are amazing! Great for lunch or a casual dinner...love the art wood by carved nation.com."}
{"text":"I could not be more sad about my second time to Pita Jungle.  The one in Tucson was great.  This one is ridiculously busy, which isn't a bad thing, I just don't think they are staffed to handle it.  Still waiting for my order I called in well over and hour ago, it's been a half hour wait so far..... And it's only for 4 people!!  I have an appointment that I am now 15 minutes late for and counting.  Heard a few of the waitresses complaining  about how busy they are and don't have a hostess.  Slightly unprofessional but no biggie.    I'm sure the food is great!  I'll update maybe when I actually get it! :/  I'd suggest a different location, coming on an off time or something.  Oh and just a note to the guy who \"helped\" me.... \"Sorry, we're crazy busy\" isn't something I want to hear!  I can see that, not my problem!  Next time just tell me you won't be able to get my order done on time on the front end!  Update: The food WAS tasty, I'll give them that!   However, they forgot a side of chicken, one dish had two different types of hummus and was only supposed to have one, and one dish which was supposed to have extra chicken didn't.  Went back in and Marnie was very friendly and helpful in refunding my money. She was polite, professional, and apologetic. Someone should thank her because she is the only reason I'll give any type of catering from here another shot."}
{"text":"Employees were incredibly rude. They messes up my order completely and then when I requested the right food they got frustrated and condescending.  Never coming back to this terrible vendor. A true shame."}
{"text":"Always been such an amazing place and today was no exception! I live when I entered that there was a free WiFi sign, so I took advantage of it! I was greeted warmly by the hostess and the manager. I decided to sit outside as the weather was gorgeous! I looked over the menu of wraps, entrees, drinks, and appetizers. I decided to get the California Beach turkey wrap. The wrap came with a Greek salad and inside the wrap was turkey  tomato, pickles, onions, mixed lettuce, and aoli. All of it was grilled to perfection ans it was absolutely delicious! Especially when I added the siracha sauce!! All of the flavors combined with the sauce made everything just pop and oh so right!  My waitress was so nice and continuously checked on me! I felt so relaxed and not rushes at all! All of this delicious food only added up to be $11 with tax and I got to take half home!! Pita Jungle will definitely be my go to spot whenever I visit Phoenix!!!"}
{"text":"This was my 2nd visit and probably last.  My gyro was just OK and we were charged for an extra beer.  Waitress was pleasant and corrected the bill.  Besides the mediocre food, really don't enjoy the staffs overly casual dress and that they only seem to hire young people with as many tattoos as possible.  Kills the atmosphere for me."}
{"text":"I have frequented most pita jungles in the valley many times, I usually order the same thing every time. The food and service is always great, and I never have any complaints. Recently things have been different, I always order the green tea with every meal every time. I could drink it like it's water. But the Tea is different. I first thought they made a mistake by giving me a black tea so when I brought it back in they informed me they are using a new tea and that I did have the correct green tea. I'm not a tea snob by any means but the new tea is disgusting and chemical tasting. For an establishment that has had the same product for years and same customers for years why change it now. I will always come back for the food and service but will never order the iced tea again."}
{"text":"Can never go wrong with the hummus and chicken or ahi tuna app....also love the wood fired salmon salad.  Waterside porch is an added bonus!"}
{"text":"The service is always slow but the food is always good! Fresh, healthy, good portions."}
{"text":"Pita Jungle has become the place that all of my friends from out of town demand that we eat at when they visit. Sometimes, there is a bit of a wait - I guess Yelp is cluing people in.   The menu is primarily Mediterranean inspired, but there is definitely something for everyone. Price-wise, it's really affordable, especially given that the portions are huge. I always take half of my meal home. Leftovers never tasted so good!  The jalape√±o cilantro hummus is ridiculously delicious, but you may need extra pita unless you really load it up. There's even a tapas happy hour ($1!) Monday through Friday, 3-5pm, and a reverse happy hour 9pm-close.   I could probably fill up on the appetizers alone, but the entrees are great too. My old standby is the Lavosh Schwarma Wrap, which is stuffed full of chicken, hummus and veggies and served with a Greek salad. Thankfully, they cut the wrap in half, because there is no way I could eat that monster in one sitting.  In addition to the fantastic food, service is always friendly and attentive. I might have more than a little crush on this place. How'd you guess?"}
{"text":"These guys are great. I usually only do take out from them and it's always ready in under 10 minutes. Food and service is fantastic!"}
{"text":"Delicious food every time. Unique menu options. Fantastic service; the staff is always friendly and helpful. We will be back!"}
{"text":"My wife and I eat here regularly. The food is terrific. The staff is friendly and the prices are more than reasonable. Don't let the name put you off. The cuisine is a crazy cool mix of Mediterranean and Italian  and the dishes are all healthy and delicious. My daughter loves the hummus and the spinach four cheese quesadilla. My wife is all about the Philly steak pita or the beef gyro. I am a big fan of the baba ganoosh. They have this dish called the medchillada. It's like a healthy enchilada. It's full of chicken, beans, rice, greens, etc. and comes with guac and tsatziki and it is huge! I doggy bag it and have the rest for lunch the next day. There are great wines and beers and the pistachio ice cream is to die for. Eat here. Eat here often."}
{"text":"I tried this place for the first time today and the food was delicious.  I ordered the Mediterranean Chicken Salad and it was fresh and full of wonderful flavors.  The chicken was perfectly seasoned and the choice of ingredients was unexpected yet delicious!  Kudos to the chef and owners for great quality food at a good price.    HOWEVER....  I take off a star because of the outrageously rude service.  I was dining alone and was not only ignored by my server, but when I asked to pay he did not answer and only glared at me.  He brought the check a moment later with no smile or \"How was the food?\".  The only contact made by any staff member once my order was taken was by a buser that took my plate away.  Shame on the server for having a severe attitude problem, but double shame on the restaurant for staffing their restaurant with disrespectful employees."}
{"text":"I really love this place. They have a very nice patio setting and everyone is really nice. They also have an amazing tea selection! I got the Cilantro Jalape√±o Hummus with chicken."}
{"text":"This was our first time at this Pita Jungle. We ordered a Gyros & Falafal. Neither one tasted very good. The meat in the Gyro was too thick and the Falafel lacked flavor. The pitas are thin and tough and fall apart. The service was friendly. I felt sick after. We will not be back again."}
{"text":"I had lunch there on Friday with my wife. She had a roasted chicken salad that looked good. I ordered a philly cheesesteak pita which had an extra dose of some bad bacteria! Yep, I got poisoned the pita jungle. About 2 hours after lunch and for the next 24 hours, I was spewing even when there was nothing in me to spew!   Anyway, I really liked pita jungle until this episode. Sadly, I will not be eating there ever again."}
{"text":"Called ahead on Saturday 3/15 to let them know 10 people would be coming to dinner at 8:15pm.  Person on the phone said they do not take reservations. I said I just thought you might like to know if 10 people are coming. She said she would let someone know. Show up, hostess was shocked. They put a table together and our server did a good job making sure everyone had what they needed and did separate checks which was above and beyond. Here's the real reason for this review and I hope someone who has any say in what goes on there gets this message. The lentil fattoush had so much garlic in it, it could have killed a horse. I took 3-4 bites and had dragon's breath immediately. This has always been my favorite dish at PJ, but wow. Yuck. Ruined it for me.  No goodbye or thank you as the hostess at the podium was on her cell phone as we were all walking out.  Pita Jungle on Ray. Meh."}
{"text":"Review actually 4.5   GREAT SERVICE!!! Try the chicken del sol, all options are possible vegetarian as far as I know. The garlic dip is amazing, the humus is just good not anything to write home about. Easy to have a healthy meal here and you ALWAYS have enough for leftovers!"}
{"text":"The service was not awesome.  My falafel was mediocre. The pita was kind of cold. There was way too much lettuce on it, and the lettuce was also sliced way too big to be practical.  My friend had a veggie burger with cheese, they put 1 square inch of cheese on it - what? And, it came on burnt toast? Hm.  I will not be back any time soon. What a disappointment."}
{"text":"I want to New York City last summer and everybody told me before I left that I would really enjoy the food!  The funny thing is, after 4 days in NYC, I only had one memorable meal, but living in the Phoenix area, I have my choice of wonderful establishments to have a delicious and memorable meal 3 times a day if I wish!  Pita Jungle is a family owned restaurant that has been around for what seems like forever.  They started out in Tempe, and have exploded in the last few years to include Scottsdale, Phoenix, Mesa, and Chandler.    If the crowds are any indication, this place is good!  But let me warn you, not everyone in your party will like it.  If you're into artery clogging, fried foods or bar foods, then Pita Jungle is not for you.  Pita Jungle serves some of the freshest, and healthiest food in the valley.  I believe they originally started out to be vegetarian, not sure, but there is something on the menu for everyone, including meat!  One of my favorites is the Caribbean Salad; a gorgeous and colorful, mouthwatering display of the most beautiful fruit you have ever seen in your life!  There's pineapple, oranges, strawberries, apples, and more!    But beware!  The servings at Pita Jungle are huge!  A plate is usually enough for 2 people, if not more!  I can only eat about 1/4 of the Caribbean salad and then take the rest home.  The restaurant is comfortable and clean, decorated kind of artsy, and modern.  If I had one complaint, it would be the one-seat ladies room!    Pita Jungle is my favorite place to take my girlfriends to lunch, since we all like fresh and healthy food.  My husband is more of a hamburger or meat and potatoes guy, this type of food just doesn't rock his world.    Anyway, if you love healthy, fresh food, salads, pita sandwiches, vegetarian, chicken wraps, and hummus, you'll love Pita Jungle!  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Fantastic product and service!!  Be sure to try the spicy chicken wrap--you better because this beauty is huge and delicious down to the last bite!!  I can only wish that we had a Pita Jungle back home- Chicago- so many imposters that do not live up to the quality offered here at the Pita Jungle here in Scottsdale!!    Next time you are in the area- local or visitor, be sure to pop on over and try this place out--Many great fresh and yummy options to choose from--wraps, salads, etc.  Thanks again and we look forward to seeing you again, soon!!!"}
{"text":"Went for Monday lunch with my hubby it was Extremely NOISY and every table full.  Everyone was shouting to be heard over the jazz 'background music'. The original paintings in the dining area are a bit disturbing too.    Service: Our hostess and server were on top of it. The cooks not so much.   Because of the name 'Pita Jungle' we selected pitas. I should of been warned when our servers expression changed upon our order.   I had a traditional gyro pita which came loaded with decayed!! at the edges lettuce, not bruised I know the difference.  I picked it off and ate the rest which was ok not great.  My Big Fat Greek Restaurant gyros are way better.  Hubby ordered the philly chicken pita, the chicken wasn't seasoned well and they went overkilled on the cheese.  We are not returning though we live 1/8th of a mile away.  The neighboring tables seemed to all have the mediterranean gazpacho soup.  It looked ok but I didn't go to a mediterranean restaurant for cold soup."}
{"text":"Fantastic Greek food. Best Gyros in the east valley, and their jalape√±o cilantro hummus is to die for. I wish they gave you more pita for the hummus, but luckily I always have some pita chips around. You know it's a good sign when all the cops are eating here."}
{"text":"The staff should wear clothing that distinguishes them between them and the customer's. When you look around for someone to help, you can't tell the difference. The place could be a little cleaner, the mix match tables and chairs makes it appear with pretty good wear and tear give the impression they bought their stuff used. Lots of the staff hang around and chit chat. The food is ok, not the sort of food I'd crave and go out of my way to stop and get. They're in a great location, which they should use to their advantage. Someone should come in and teach them how to better run this place."}
{"text":"I'm writing this review exclusively to process my love for the Caramrlized Cauliflower with Tahini.  Holy mole this is GOOD STUFF!!!"}
{"text":"Great food with healthy choices with sincere service. This is one of our favorite lunch and dinner places."}
{"text":"I absolutely love the broiled chicken salad or broiled chicken pita too. I am giving it a fair the stars because one time it can be great food and service and the next time the food is just as bad as the service,  yet we all come here fairly often.  The rice pudding is great,  but again sometimes it's a hit or a miss. I wish it was more consistent and had more servers who cared, not all the same.  Siiiigh."}
{"text":"I love Pita Jungle always fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. The pita's are the best! I always get the Cilantro Hummus. Best hummus EVER! (point blank) I have also tried the garlic grilled mushrooms and they are also very delicious. I've never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Rachel is the best server Ive had in a long time! Food was great as always. Good music too."}
{"text":"This is a place for average food and odd decor. While I don't regret the food I get here, I don't necessarily seek this place out for the food. Food never is truly consistent and I've had warm meals more than I should have."}
{"text":"Was in town on Friday 3/20 for the weekend to see an A's game and stumbled upon this great place!  I got the falafel salad and sis got the flatbread pizza with kalamata, tomato, etc.. She said her pizza was PERFECT- flavors were great, cooked perfectly. My salad was good. The falafel was a tad overcooked and came out crumbly and dry...  BUT- the greens were fresh as were all the veggies in the salad! The tahini dressing was great- got a bit extra on the side. The salad also came with 2 large, warm pita breads, so I made little sandwiches with all my greens and falafel. The falafel had a goood flavor, but it was a bit hard to cut in half as it just broke apart.  The jalapeno cilantro humms was WOW- could have used a bit more jalapeno, but we totally understand that they have to please a wide range of people...  Our server was adorable. Kinda tall guy, blondish hair, very sweet- made suggestions, helped.. water filled... great guy!  He was so sweet we left him a huge tip.. probably a working student- so we wanted tohelp with tuition!!!  :-D  Anyway, wish I lived closer, I'd try other things on the wonderful, diverse menu!"}
{"text":"This Pita Jungle was good. We went for the reverse happy hour. Well, what happened was we didn't know about the reverse happy hour until we got there. It starts at 9 and we got there at a little after 8. So we went for a walk around the neighborhood first to burn off some of those calories we were about to tack on and to kill some time. The walk was fun. The neighborhood is awesome. It doesn't feel like Phoenix at all. We even saw a big boat.  After the walk, we perused back over to the joint. I don't know if they had drink specials, we didn't drink that night. I had an iced tea and homemade lemonade. I think it's homemade. It tasted like it. I was impressed. I LOVE my Arnold Palmers. I would consider going there just for a big drink to go. I had the felafel, my husband had the chicken shwarma. The pita bread was a little hard and the felafel was a little dry. I don't know if maybe it was because it was the end of the night? We also had the hummus trio and the garlic dip. Both were delicious. But again, the pita bread was kind of dry. We couldn't decide which hummus we liked best. I think my vote is for the original. My husband was all over the tomato.  The service was pretty good, although she only came back to our table once. But again, that's probably because it was the end of the night, I think she was doing her side work. Luckily we didn't need anything. It was pretty busy for 9 oclock, I was surprised. We were no where near the last ones out of there. I don't know if we'll ever go back to Pita Jungle. I'd like another drink, but other than that, it didn't leave me craving more."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst gyro I have ever had in my life. It was super salty and very greasy. I have tried to eat here on 3 different occasions and have been disappointed each time. Never going again."}
{"text":"I am a takeout regular--even though I should eat here more often. The interior is beautiful! I can't live without the Mediterranean chicken salad, cilantro hummus, chicken shawarma pita, the spicy chicken wrap, and the chicken pasta salad."}
{"text":"Excellent all around! Salads are delicious and huge. I recommend a platter for sharing because you get to try all of the spreads (hummus, etc) for like $10. We shared it between 5 hungry people and barely finished it! I had the mediterranean chicken salad which was delicious and giant. Everything is fresh and colorful, and I wish we had something like this in NY!"}
{"text":"Such a great place with outdoor seating. They have the best tapas happy hour menu and a nice wine selection.  So many great vegetarian and vegan options."}
{"text":"Yum yum yum!! Been here 4 times in the last couple of months. Twice for the Saturday & Sunday Brunch - which from my understanding is a rarity and we are lucky to have such a nice full menu at our Tukee Ray Rd location, and 2 other times for lunch. Brunch has some really wonderful options, and who am I kidding - the $2 mimosas that's what I really love!! Also, my Mom brings her dog and we sit outside, so overall it is a really nice weekend spot. For lunch have been enjoying some of the incredible salads, and happened to stop in on half price Wine Wednesdays, got a lovely bottle of Estancia Chardonnay for only 13 bucks. TIA and JOE have been our servers lately, and they are both incredible. The host is also extremely welcoming. Looking forward to our next visit!!!"}
{"text":"Very good food options, many are healthy. hummus and spicy chicken wrap are the best.  Mango shrimp is good. Service is MUCH better than it was years ago. Moving in the right direction."}
{"text":"I have to give a shout out to an employee named Madelyn. She was working the to-gos & bar. She was working her ass off with phone calls & always greeting people with a smile no matter how hectic it got. She ran back & forth from the kitchen & worked as quick & efficiently as possible. I'm so impressed with her attitude & work ethic. It was a super busy thurs night, all the employees were rushed but seemed to stay positive. Besides the awesome service the food is always amazing & healthy. I'd definitely recommend coming!  (If it's a busy fri/sat night expect to wait for a lil. ) -also a lot of people seem to call in for pick up orders- be patient! If you saw how many people order within minutes you'd understand!!!"}
{"text":"My expierence was bad but happy to see there are some people who are giving 4 or 5 stars. There is hope.  Got seated at a dirty table.  When they cleaned table with a wet rag.....in front of my date and myself as we are seated at the table, the wet rag left a nasty mold smell. Obiviously they didnt switch rags or water. We moved to a different table.  When I ran out of water, I put my empty glass on the edge of the table for the waiter to at least get the hint I needed a refill. When my beef Pita got to my table at a reasonable time. I ate my dish without my glass of water being filled once by our waiter. The only water I got after my first glass was water from my ice melting.  My date was smart and lightly drank her glass of soda throughout the entire sit.  Food was great but, service sucked and only would be getting take outs from this particular location."}
{"text":"I know this is in a mall or whatever, but when I got my pita, it was cold and full of everything I asked them not to include. Of course it worked out that I couldn't check my to-go order until I was far away. Just unsatisfied and still awfully hungry right now.   tl;dr: check your order after you receive it."}
{"text":"Had the chance to enjoy this location last night with a good friend.  They have catered previously for a lunch at my company and the food was excellent, so I was excited to be able to actually visit their physical location.  The venue did not disappoint.  Very modern in it's decor and appearance.  The front desk hostess was extremely nice (and wearing an adorable Star Wars shirt - jealous).    I had the One Thousand Beans Pita, my fiance had the Gyro and our friend had the Chicken and Hummus.  Everything was well prepared and tasted amazing.  The only down sides were the lack of waiting room in the front portion - there was only a five minute wait to be seated, but there was a bit of a crowd waiting to be seated, so it was a touch uncomfortable.  The other thing was the amount of time it took to get our food seemed a bit lengthy and they forgot the steamed veggies our friend ordered to accompany her hummus.    However, on the up-side the waitress acknowledged the wait, apologized and immediately rectified the missing veggies!  It was a very busy location also, so waiting for freshly prepared food isn't really a bad thing - just more something to keep in mind.  Go for happy hour, get a drink and have a nice chat while you wait for the food.    Overall: A  Recommendations: Go for happy hour (until 6 p.m. and late night happy hour from 9 p.m. to close).  Go with friends and order a variety of foods and share - everything sounds delish but you can't order it all!  Or can you...."}
{"text":"Headed here for lunch on a weekday since it's close to my job.  We went a little earlier than normal lunch hours, since places in Scottsdale fill up quickly around noon.  We were greeted and seated right away and the hostess was very welcoming.    After a couple of minutes our waiter came over and grabbed our drinks.  We both opted for the gyro with roasted potatoes (a little extra to add on the potatoes). Both meals were cooked perfectly and the roasted potatoes were very tasty with a good seasoning on them.   The parking lot can be a little tough to navigate during busy hours, so just be aware that if you go at noon, it will most likely take longer to get in and out.  Overall: A Good lunch stop (from parking to paying - 45 minutes).  You can order ahead and grab-and-go if needed. Servers were nice, food was tasty."}
{"text":"Amazing Food and the Arnold Palmers are out of this world!  Fresh Lemonade can not be beat!"}
{"text":"The food is great and the staff is always so nice. I love this place. It can be dinner with my kids or drinks with my friends...it works."}
{"text":"This is only my second time here since I live on the other side of town, but I have to say that this is actually my favorite Pita Jungle. We got the same server as last time (Kacie) and she is so sweet and quick. My bestie got the Mediterranean chicken salad and ordered grilled mushrooms. It was so big that she is taking half of it home. I have the chicken combo platter and it is literally 2 meals in one. I highly recommend eating here."}
{"text":"I love Pita Jungle! The menu is big enough so you'll never get sick of any one thing but it seems like everyone has their favorites. Tikka masala, hummus and chicken, chipotle chicken pizza, or Mediterranean chicken salad, all delicious. This particular location has amazing service during their always busy lunch hour. The servers are always happy to serve you quickly since everyone seems to be on a short lunch break. This location is the best!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite location out of any we've been to. We dine in and take out frequently and Justin is the best when we get take out. I highly recommend Dana Park, the food consistency, great service, and cleanliness is above many other locations we've visited. You won't have to chase anyone down to get the things you need like napkins, refills or your bill. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"The food here is great! Highly recommend the gyros and all the hummus'. Would've rated this place a 5 star but our waitress wasn't great. We asked for silverware and napkins and only received a napkin. So we had to wait and ask for more napkins. She obviously sees me feeding my baby boy. Most of the time she was just standing and chatting over in the bar area not attending her tables. One chick brought out our food and we said thank you and she just sat our food down and didn't even acknowledge our kind gesture. Then I get a straw in my sangria?! I didn't know how to react to that."}
{"text":"I am delighted there is a new Pita Jungle here - on the corner of 7th St and Missouri right next to Spinatos. The best pro: lots of parking!  Hubby and I were hungry but wanted something light so we headed over. The restaurant was big, bright and open with lots of fresh air! It was such a beautiful day and we took advantage of it!  Our waitress, Kelly, was sweet and attentive. We ordered the Green Tropical ice tea, the Jalape√±o and Cilantro hummus with Ahi Tuna and the Shawarma Pita. Both were fabulous and enough for two! We had nothing on our plate to bring home. Total of our bill: $23.75"}
{"text":"Interesting place.  Very Mediterranean, I selected the salmon over spinach and smashed potatoes.  It was excellent, had a little of a char taste in a good way on the salmon.  The table ordered hummus in the form of three different flavor along with fresh pita break and this cucumber yogurt dip which I was trying to figure out how else I could eat it.  All in all I could eat here again if my wife wanted to eat here but it wouldn't be my first choice not because it wasn't good but it simply wasn't my thing.  It is good to try new things so come and see this for yourself."}
{"text":"I am always a fan of Pita Jungle because they consistently offer good healthy food at inexpensive prices. The problem is that it is always packed and there was a wait for a table. We ordered the cilantro jalape√±o hummus and the philly steak pita. Everything was what I expected - good and inexpensive."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch yesterday around noon and was surprised when I was able to find parking spaces, a table was available when we got there, and the service was prompt. I originally tried to order the kiwi strawberry green iced tea from their menu, but the waitress said the menu needs to be updated because they do not have that tea. They did have the blackberry (something) green tea and it was pretty good.  Their menu is pretty extensive but I decided to order from their special menu and get the chicken avocado pita tostada salad. The portions are generous, prices are reasonable, and I enjoyed my meal. My meal came to less than $15. Overall, not a bad place to stop for lunch if you are in the area."}
{"text":"I love the food at Pita Jungle. The only thing I dislike is that it is EXTREMELY noisy and I am hearing impaired. Eating outside is great as long as it's not too hot."}
{"text":"I lived in AZ for over a year (moved there for a relationship that went south...) but Pita Jungle was right by my apartments and got me through - I almost always ordered the chicken with hummus appetizer, and it was plenty for two dinners.    The service there was great, and there was a little bar there that I would have wine at here and there.  It was one of my happy places in AZ.  We have one here in CA that is about 20 miles from me, but I still go on the weekends - it is truly that good!"}
{"text":"First time eating food from Pita Jungle.  I've heard so much about this place, I couldn't wait.  I was at a client meeting in Downtown Phoenix and since the meeting went over the lunch hour, they asked if we wanted to grab something to eat and someone mentioned Pita Jungle....awesome.  I ordered the Falafel Pita.  It was pretty good.  The Falafel was cooked just right with a hard outer shell and moist and tasty center.  The Pita and Veggies were good too.  Overall, it was a very satisfying meal and we were able to power through our meeting.  I want to come back and try different menu items.  Return Factor - 80%"}
{"text":"Love this place! The falafel and hummus is delicious here! Be sure to ask for the whole wheat pita, it's healthier and tastes way better. They also used to have an item called a \"medchilada\" same concept as an enchilada  but way tastier, the portion is pretty large (I eat a lot so when I say it's huge, believe me) so I would suggest sharing it with someone. I always get it with tofu, tried it with meat but it just wasn't the same.   Now although this is no longer on the menu, you can still order it. All you have to do is ask :)"}
{"text":"I went to Pita Jungle for a few reasons. First, I like Mediterranean food,  a lot! Second, they have a happy hour that includes $2 margaritas and tapas. We got pitas, olives, shrimp, and some sauces. We also got margaritas,  of course.  Everything was delicious and pretty reasonably priced. Nothing outstanding about them though. I wouldn't go out of my way to go back, but it was good enough."}
{"text":"I LOVE Pita Jungle - LOVE it! And, super bummed with this location not allowing for someone who wants to eat a smaller portion, to order from the kids' menu. Ok, that's all. Just a request to let grown people order the food size that let's them eat a smaller portion AND not waste food. Thanks!"}
{"text":"We LOVE Pita Jungle!  It is always an amazing experience with great food and a wonderful atmosphere.  I highly recommend an order of Pita Chips as an appetizer.  The portions are generally massive, so sharing may be an option.  Fruit and Cheese Fantasia or Caribbean Salad with the Peanut Butter Shake is to die for."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in the valley, I frequent many of their location. I am always met with a smile and given great service no matter the location.  Even with all the wonderful choices on the menu, I get the chicken and hummus most often. They have three flavors of hummus, the plain is my favorite. Their tropical black tea is awesome and they always offer a tea to go, which is very welcomed in this hot desert we reside in.   The one disappoint I have had at Pita Jungle was their margarita. It is by far the worst one I have ever tasted. Hope they fix that, especially when offered at happy hour."}
{"text":"I liked this place well enough.  More so than anything else, the fact that four of us spent only $60 for a filling meal will lead me to come here again.  However, in thinking about what to write, nothing about this place really came to mind, which is why I'm inclined to give it 3 stars rather than 4.  And, the fact that our server seemed to be annoyed by my 11-month old nephew's presence at the table will lead me to keep looking for other restaurants.    So, if I find a better pita/middle eastern place in Tempe, then I will likely go to that other place, but in the interim I'm happy to go to pita jungle to get decent middle-eastern food.  No big complaints, but really nothing memorable.  (I will update this post if/when I go back and try more dishes.  Two of the other three persons I dined with greatly enjoyed their food and would likely rate the place higher than I do, but, well, this is just *my* two cents.)"}
{"text":"So I used to live in Phoenix and regularly visited this location as loved the food and service for at least 6 years. We went to have dinner this weekend and although the wait staff was fantastic and on it, the food had definitely changed and not for the better. What happened to the fresh chicken combo plate. It used to Include garlic green beans and chicken breast cut Into strips. Now garlic green beans are no longer available and the chicken is now served as a whole breast looking suspiciously of frozen quality.   The hummus had also changed and now tastes as if it is of commissary quality made using a mass production method. Thinking this may have been a one off we decided to try a new location on 7th street. Found it all to be the same. So it's clear that the corporate desire to franchise the brand has come at the cost of quality and taste."}
{"text":"My favorite go-to place!! Food is delicious and there are so many options. The cilantro jalape√±o hummus is my favorite for an appetizer! Service is great too."}
{"text":"Pita Jungle is great. I always get the chicken and hummus appetizer! It is enough for a meal."}
{"text":"Pita jungle rocks!! The service is great. The food rocks. And I don't yelp unless I am impressed. Yummy!"}
{"text":"The five stars is within the context of easy, affordable, healthy, casual dining. This is my default restaurant when I want a pleasant and delicious place to take my family. They have a great selection of flavorful food, lots of vegetarian options, hummus and the like, but also nicely spiced meat dishes, and very healthy wine pours with a good by the glass selection.   The G Spot is right next door for gelato dessert. Yum."}
{"text":"Love pita jungle! Love the food, the philly cheesesteak is my fav, the service could be a little better, sometimes I feel like they just don't want to be working, but the food is a+"}
{"text":"Terrible service. Online ordering system not working. My coworker and I both called to try and put in a carry-out order and both were put on hold for more than five minutes before we both hung up"}
{"text":"Rocking.. Good food.. Nice ambience.. Tried wraps and salads.. Really nice.. Very spacious"}
{"text":"I've been going here for decades, have tried most every dish, and love them all. A bit crowded, and not my favorite cozy atmosphere but great for a healthy lunch."}
{"text":"I just love Pita Jungle. Been eating here for over a decade and have had most items on the menu. All are great, but I usually go back to the hummus with chicken appetizer."}
{"text":"Visiting my sister in Phoenix we went here after 13 hours of sitting in a car and we couldn't have asked for a better decompression meal.        Started with some app's.  Falafel on a big bed of fresh butter lettuce, onions, pickles, olives and tomato.  Tasty, but the falafel's were i little small for the size of the bed of lettuce.  Baba Ghanoush was excellent.  Pure eggplant flavor with a dash of spice for a perfect dish.  But the best was the Spanakopita! Perfect layers of delicately sauteed spinach, crumbled feta and crispy crunchy filo.  The burst of herbaceous flavor and creamy decadent cheese was balanced and delicious.  For entrees, I had the Sirloin and Humus.  Decadent diced pieces of sirloin steak pan seared and tossed with pine nut's over humus. DELICIOUS!  The steak was cooked and rested perfectly and was complemented nicely by the earthy tones of the pine nut's and the slightly tangy woody notes of the humus.  My wife had the Broiled Chicken Salad.  Tender juicy chunks of chicken over a huge bed of lettuce, tomatoes and cumbers topped with zesty refreshing lemon vinaigrette.  Everything was fresh, crisp and delicious.  As for the personality of the restaurant, our server ( I believe her name was Lauren) was very nice, not pushy but helpful and was really on top her game.  No glasses were ever more than 1/3 empty and used dishes were whisked away within minutes of being placed aside.  The restaurant was a little loud and the tables were a little close, but even those things were vastly overshadowed by the rest of the experience.   A great treat and one we hope we'll get to try again."}
{"text":"My friends and I were pretty excited when we heard about a Pita Jungle popping up on the West side.  I had been to the Tempe location a couple of times and had yet to find something on the menu that I really loved.  However, the experience at this location was the most positive I've had thus far.  The service was excellent- everyone working was super friendly and accommodating.  As referenced in a previous review, there was a bit of standing around but they were on their game when we needed them to be, and I find it to be a normal thing for servers to socialize during down times.  The decor isn't as wonderful as the Tempe location, but I do appreciate that they also have local art displayed and for sale.  We had the large hummus plate- splint into cilantro jalapeno, red pepper and garlic dip.  It was way too large for the three of us, but we all seemed to enjoy the warmed pita bread.  An extra pita only cost $.35 and is totally worth it.  My dining companion was very excited about the small price you have to pay for an extra piece of the delicious and perfectly warm pita bread.    I had the Philly Chicken Pita and was pleased.  It is a large portion and was done well.  My companion had the Million bean plate (something to that effect) and was very excited about her left-overs!    I'm glad that the phenomenon that is Pita Jungle decided to give Glendale some love with this location.  Us Westsiders need more of this kind of love!"}
{"text":"This will likely be my shortest review ever because people have already said everything I would need to say, so just three things:  1.  There is something to be said about the original Pita Jungle- it feels a bit more authentic and organic to the vision set out by the creators of this venture.  Now that PJ is all over the Valley, I find myself drawn to this location for that reason exactly.  2.  No beer on draft (which I'm spoiled by at the Peoria PJ location) here which bothers me.    3.  No booze on the \"patio\" so just sit inside."}
{"text":"This place is ok. The food isn't as healthy as I would like however there is not a lot around to choose from."}
{"text":"The food here was pretty good. But when we visited the place was PACKED, and the waiting staff seemed to be in a huge hurry to get us out the door. We had our check given to us WAY before we were even close to finishing our meal, which seemed like a very subtle way of saying \"get out.\""}
{"text":"Love their happy hour cuz you can try bits and bobs of their offerings.  The hummus trio, chicken, scallops, marianated mushrooms are all delish.  Want more?  Their wraps are tasty.  Great stuff when you're looking for a different taste."}
{"text":"Great 1st time!  We are from Metro Detroit where middle eastern food is common.  We started with a local beer-nice list.  We then ordered a large original hummus.  Delicious and huge. I do wish they added more veggies to this appetizer. I added the hot chili sauce they brought to the table.  Chicken was seasoned well in the lavosh and the Greek salad still has my mouth watering.  We will be back.  Service was good too.  Sweet girl.  Only negative was good came out quickly and the tables are small.  Need to bring entrees after the appetizer is finished."}
{"text":"They make a delicious falafel sandwich. Definitely the best in the downtown Tempe area."}
{"text":"Regularly pick up food at the convenient \"to go window\" and the service is quick and friendly.  Every variety of hummus is delicious especially the hummus with chicken.  The shwarma, wraps, salads are also yummy.  The tikka masala entree is amazing and enough food for two meals.  Pita Jungle makes it easy to eat healthy.  Even the saut√©ed vegetables are memorable.  Love this place!"}
{"text":"Ordered a chicken pita through door dash, was the worst pita I've ever had. Chicken was dry and cold, whatever sauce was put on it was smeared along the pita only rather than given to me in a side container so I can add it ONTOP of the gyro. The chicken ratio compared to anything else in my pita was a bit much, yes I ordered chicken but this thing was overflowing with barely any additional toppings. Just lettuce falling out of it. This will be the last time I order anything from Pita Jungle, if you can't get a chicken pita right, then there is no point in trying the rest of your menu."}
{"text":"Like the atmosphere here. The food is great, especially if you want good food, great taste, and watching what you eat. I rather enjoyed the vegetarian dishes and especially enjoy the hummus. Try the trio hummus plate. Yummy!"}
{"text":"My favorite thing to get here is the Mediterranean Chicken Salad. It's HUGE btw. The hummus is the best I've ever had, the small is a good size for 3-4 people as a starter cause the actual meals you order are huge. I usually order extra pita with it. They have a bar as well, smaller than most, but still nice to have a beer or glass of wine with dinner/lunch."}
{"text":"An excellent experience! The waitress was so attentive & super nice. Food took a while but worth the wait. Gave me time to catch up with an old friend. They also have an incredible beautiful large mirror on the wall, paintings that are reminiscent of water colors. Food was great. Thanks!"}
{"text":"I've loved everything I've ordered at this location. The salmon salad, gyros, baba ganoush, and baklava are amazing. The staff are odd characters but kind."}
{"text":"I have visited this location and others and was shocked to learn that I was unable to order off the kids menu. I am a bariatric patient and can not consume much. Most all restaurants are able to make this accommodation. I couldn't even look at the kids menu because the owner of this location \"doesn't allow it\" I've ordered off the kids menu at the chandler location with ease. Disappointed in this last visit."}
{"text":"I am a huge Pita Jungle fan, I think the food is delicious!  I have been to multiple locations across the valley and always been satisfied.  It seems every time I have been to this location the service is always so slow.  I understand that during busy times you have to be flexible but with my most recent visit here (on a Sunday night) it was not overly crowded or busy.  Everything regarding our meal seem to take extra time (from ordering drinks to waiting for our check).  I will definitely be visiting Pita Jungle in the future, just not this location."}
{"text":"Really love the lake in the back! After lunch my kids fed the ducks and we walked around for a bit. It was great :)  I'm SO sad they don't have the yellow fin tuna wrap anymore :'( Omg please bring that back!"}
{"text":"This is the first time I came here. Good and service was good but my goodness, invest in some shades like your neighboring restaurants or run over to Fry's and buy a few umbrellas.  It's miserable sitting on the patio with zero shade. And when the server even mentions management is aware of the issue but does nothing to improve the comfort of their customers it not good for business. Next time I'll go to the nice shaded Sushi place next door."}
{"text":"I love Pita Jungle- the food is great. The 2 stars is for this location. The service is horrible. I am a very patient person so for me to actually walk away from the counter in a quiet rage was unusual. Rude, rude, rude. It won't keep me away from other PJ's- just this location."}
{"text":"The original humus was great and salad that I got along with it was good as well. The reason I'm giving g 3 stars is for the noise, we went there at 2 pm and it was very loud in there. Also I ordered the hummus that came with a pita and salad but was disappointed about seeing the salad on top of the hummus :-/ I thought the hummus was going to be in a side dish and eat it as a dip. I would come back but it would be at a different time of the day for sure."}
{"text":"Just heard the name \"Pita Jungle\" tossed around a few times and finally this Saturday got a chance to try it. I love mediteranean, hummus, grape leaves, feta etc...reminds me so much of those good meals we had in Jordan and Israel which I visited a few times.  Tried the mediterannean platter and it was huge! A little disapointed their shwarma was chicken? Usually it's lamb or beef in those countries. Next time I will try their gyro I shouldn't have ordered the extra sidedish of hummus  It seemed like the whole neighborhood decided to show up and the wait was rather long and the staff very rushed.  I asked for some olive oil to pour over my hummus and he quickly brought some and after slathering it all over, I only realized it was rancid! Probably from sitting in those table bottles for too long.  So that was a bit unnerving, nonetheless the wines were great and they had my favorite, Pinot Grigio,  The outdoor seating and atmosphere was nice too had it not been so busy and the buskers were a little out of touch with the atmosphere so I am glad we didn't sit outside."}
{"text":"My dear Pita Jungle:  You always make me so happy when I eat here! I leave so stuffed, but I can't get enough of your food.  If it weren't for your falafel, I would have given you 5 stars. I really don't like it, because it is too crusty for my tastes.   However, your hummus is some of the best around and I really love your broiled chicken pita/broiled chicken salad. My sister always enjoys your cheesecake after her meal, as well.  It makes me smile to see that the servers can wear virtually anything they want. Besides that, I've never once had bad service."}
{"text":"I love pita jungle. I'm pretty sure I've reviewed other locations. But anyway. There are so many options. And options for people like me who don't eat meat.   There are so many things on this menu that I have enjoyed on numerous occasions. I really like the wood fired veggie lavash wrap. It's delicious, but so filling. I can't ever finish the whole thing.  The portablla burger is amazing as well. I love getting the garlic new potatoes as my side.  I do eat fish, so I've tried the salmon burger a few times and I've always enjoyed that. The salmon burger is super filling as well.  I could literally go on and on and on.   There are so many options and I am always a fan of the fact that all pita jungles are decorated differently and display local artists work on their walls."}
{"text":"This place has the best tapas in town. We had the cauliflower, comes with this amazing sauce. It was truly an exceptional combo.  The atmosphere is inviting and the staff always friendly and attentive. The bar had quality beverages, including delicious tea combinations for those who prefer alcohol free beverages I had a vege wrap for the main course. Delicious with plenty to take home. Still had a fresh and satisfying taste.  If you're looking for a great place to entertain friends or family, try this spot. Sit outside and enjoy a beautiful sunset or just take in fresh air."}
{"text":"i love this pita jungle. great staff, great food, great attention to detail. i love the modern feel. i love that my food always comes out right and that my server checks back a few times after we get our food to make sure all is still good. i love the concept of the community table (but i feel too awkward to actually eat there myself). i wish the waiting area wasn't so cramped. i wish i knew how to make hummus this good. i wish i could eat here every day."}
{"text":"this really isn't the best pita jungle out there. the food is great, but i rarely get my food the way i order it. servers are kind, but seem overwhelmed during lunch - often we get our food and don't see a server again until we're ready for our check. i can't give them less than 3 stars because i really, really like the food, but i wish it would come to me the way i order it more often."}
{"text":"Food as always is great. Not happy about managements decision to not give out wifi.  Especially when it is listed as \"public\" wifi."}
{"text":"Hit or miss.  My gyro was really good although I had to seriously hunt for the tzsiki sauce but my guest's pasta & grilled chicken salad, although large, fresh and good looking had absolutely no flavor. Maybe they forgot to put the dressing on the pasta??"}
{"text":"I ordered take-out: Gyro with an extra side of tzatziki sauce and it was so amazing.  It was really full of meat, the pita part was really soft , the flavors were on point and I can't wait till I can go again and I will try something new. It was so frickin good !"}
{"text":"The hosts were total sloths. It took 2 people about 8 minutes to figure out how to seat us. That was because they just talked about their weekend and would not take us to an available table. They waited until another wait person went over pointed to the table. Is that really the best you can do? I won't be back."}
{"text":"Loooooove the Mediterranean chicken salad!! I usually get it with honey sesame ginger dressing because the lemon vinaigrette is so sour."}
{"text":"I am so obsessed with their cilantro-jalapeno hummus! I always substitute the regular pita or their pita chips; they are AMAZING. I've had a few other items on their menu, but I always come back for more hummus. I typically go before the lunch crowd or call in my order for pick up.  Today was the first time I've been in during their busy lunch hour and it was swarming with people.  It took a long time for me to get rang up and obtain my food, but the guy behind the counter was doing about 10 jobs at once, so I understood why there was a slower process to get me rang up.  I wouldn't hold that against them though, all their staff was moving as fast as they could.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"If you come here and don't get the Cilantro Jalepeno Hummus...you've possibly made the biggest mistake of your life and you should not be allowed to make grown-up decisions anymore.  Even if you don't like hummus, this is a must have.  It's like the first time you heard the Beatles.  Trust in Pita Jungle."}
{"text":"I was in town on a small commercial shoot and got lunch catered by these guys for 15 people cast/crew. Food was great, presentation was amazing, service was great when I came in to pickup.  When I came to pickup the place was packed, and people at the counter were great at trying to get me in and out as they were dealing with lunch rush. Everything was displayed great, in very nice containers. The quality of food was great, falafel, hummus, salad, all were fresh & the cast loved it. I only placed the order a few hours before picking up.  Only hassle, was i tried to order online and it was a pain to do catering order + they wanted you to sign up or something which is annoying. Just call the guy and place your order.  Great for groups/catering, would definitely do it again."}
{"text":"My family and I have dined at this Pita Jungle probably more than at any other restaurant in the Phoenix area, so I am overdue in writing a review.  As always the food was terrific.  We especially like the new summer menu items.  The curry soup is terrific and very filling.  Last night I had the salad with quinoa and cilantro hummus, my daughter had the turkey burger and my husband had a dish with shrimp, rice and mango (sorry that I can't remember the menu names).  Everything was great. My husband and daughter split the chocolate baklava with vanilla ice cream dessert.  They said it was very yummy. Pita Jungle's menu has a great variety with something appealing for everyone in your group.  I really must give high praise to our waiter Joshua Berk.  He is the most attentive, knowledgeable waiter in the restaurant.  (I am not a relative.)  As mentioned, we have eaten at PJ many times often with friends and he has always been a terrific waiter.  He can rattle off the ingredients in any of the specials or other menu items and offers combos/substitutions without missing a beat or reading from a list.  I thought he must be a manager because he is so adept at his job.  (Again, our party did not include one relative or friend of his).  It's just good to acknowledge one someone does a great job, because people mostly give negative feedback or in the case of the restaurant industry, people just stop showing up.    While I noted that the restaurant is loud, the noise level is just fine on the patio, which I recommend when the misters are working or it is not July or August in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Great Place,good service and portions are huge and you can taste the freshness. You have to try there Jalopeno Hummus and Lavosh pita crisp. Very good!!"}
{"text":"This place could be so much better if they listened. Onions are extremely strong. If someone hates them and you continuously keep forgetting to leave them out of their food , that is a quick way to lose a customer. Everytime I go there and ask for no onions I still get onions! When I complain, instead of making me a new salad , they just pick the onions off leaving the taste of them behind. I think this place has a great concept going with the fresh food and I love greek but I would rather go to greek pita across the street next to Coldstone where they never mess up my order and I enjoy my food vs gagging on an onion!"}
{"text":"Love, love, love this restaurant!  So many healthy options (although, to keep the calories low, and avoid temptation, ask to have half of your meal boxed up right away).  My absolute favorites are the Mediterranean Chicken Salad and the Coconut Curry Soup, but I haven't tried anything I didn't love."}
{"text":"Loved this place!  Not only was the food delicious, and cheap, but a few of the waitresses were pretty hot.  Sorry ladies, but I'm a guy and sometimes I can't help but notice.  Will be back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"The best vegetarian Greek/ Mediterranean ever!!!!!! its too bad i live in San Diego i crave Pita jungle almost all the time , They have a greatttttt!!! Cilantro hommos!! its like i died and went to heaven.  i definitely cant wait to see my sisters in AZ because all we are going to do is go to Pita jungle every fucking day!!!!!!!!!!!!! OMFGG!!!!!"}
{"text":"i have always enjoyed pita jungle.  i love that the product is about as consistent as it gets in all of the locations i've been to.  However their portions have always been too big for me to take little-man unless we share something and honestly, i don't feel like shelling out $8 for him to have his own entree unless i decide it's leftover-worthy.   but now they have a kids menu and it's FANTASTIC!  it has become one of his favorite spots.  the only downside is that if you go when they are really busy it can be a bit loud and hard to hear, but i'm here for the food."}
{"text":"Traveled to my company's Phoenix office for work, and this place was right down the street.  It's hard to eat healthy while traveling, and I was pleased to stumble across Pita Jungle.  I went with the spicy chicken wrap, and was not disappointed.  The portion was HUGE, which was great because I had a flight that evening and figured I wouldn't be eating for the next 6 hours or so.  The wrap itself was so fresh and flavorful.  I also loved the fact that I could eat lunch outside in 68 degree weather, which most of my Phoenix co-workers thought was \"too cold\".  Of course, I had just left 20 degrees, so 68 is pretty awesome, and worthy of eating outside.   Service was top-notch, and they had us in and out quickly.  When I come back to the Phoenix office for work, I'm definitely coming back to Pita Jungle."}
{"text":"Pita Jungle has really great hummus,  it is expensive but worth it. I recommend getting the triple hummus as an appetizer."}
{"text":"I'll admit; I have been ignoring Pita Jungle for a while, mostly because I LOVE Greek food, and my favorite Greek joints are little hole-in-the-walls. I didn't want to ruin my love of Gyros and Dolmades by eating them at a chain restaurant.  All of that aside, the food here is fabulous. Incredibly fresh, flavorful and huge portions! We ordered the plain hummus as an appetizer, and there was nothing plain about it at all! Garlicky, creamy goodness alongside a warm, fluffy pita. Definitely in my top 3 for hummus.   I tried the Lovash Chicken Shawarma Wrap - and it's hands down one of the best wraps I've ever eaten. I drank some kind of kiwi tea, and that was yummy, too!   Unfortunately, I had to deduct a star because it was SO loud in the restaurant. I feel like the tables could have been placed better, or maybe some dividers could have been put up. I just felt like I was in one huge room with way too many people.  Service was excellent and efficient. I will be back (probably for takeout!)."}
{"text":"PROS:  5 star salads that are HUGE, menu diversity, speed of service during lunch hour.  I hear alot of great stuff about their wraps, but I'm personally not a wrap kind of guy.  Middle of the road:  Entrees are predictable and tend to fulfill expectations, but nothing more.  Hummus offerings are clever and satisfying, but they can be beat in taste and texture even by prepackaged ones from places like AJ's.  CONS:   The negatives are mostly non-food related.  Can be bonkers-crowded during weekday lunch hours, cars and parking lot are right in your face whether you are inside or outside, staff is speedy and businesslike but rather aloof, and, unfortunately, layout and overall design of the place is average-to-unappealing, and a bit uncomfortable.  I may be too hard on this place, as Mediterranean fare and fusion ranks fairly low on my list, so even when it is done spectacularly well, it still doesn't stir my spirit too much.  That said, I can't say that they really do anything spectacularly well here EXCEPT for those huge, amazing salads.  If you're a salad kind of guy or gal, order with confidence."}
{"text":"I am really liking this place the more I visit.  I tell myself every time I go that I'm going to order something different.  That of course never happens.  I am partial to a certain salad ordered the way I want it.  Last visit however, I found a chunk of foil in my salad halfway through eating.  Not cool!  I brought it up to our server and she sort of shrugged it off with a \"sorry about that\"...I'm sorry I had to pay for it!"}
{"text":"I like the place in general. The atmosphere is funky, the food has many healthy choices (love the wood-fired salmon salad and the wraps), the wine list is okay. However, the service is very spotty and hit and miss. Last night, we were delighted with our server. But when we mentioned that the extremely loud noise from the vacuum was bothering us (to the point where a dinner conversation was not possible), he sent the kitchen manager over who was extremely rude. \"Do you have a problem?\", the kitchen manager asked, and when we kindly requested the noise be stopped, he flat out refused, acting as if our request was somehow outlandish.  If that's how Pita Jungle values its customers, I don't think I want to come here anymore. Actually, I was considering it for a party of 10 out-of-town guests tonight and will be going elsewhere. Can't risk vacuums next to my dinner table."}
{"text":"Would give it 5 stars except I hate the parking lot.   We ended up walking over (again, because of the parking lot and it's a good family walk before and after dinner from where we live). The staff was very helpful; we had a baby stroller and our dog with us. The girl got us a table on the patio closest to where we could tie up the dog and leave the stroller outside off their grounds so we could stay closeby.  May I say, I intended to try the hummos but have had bad hummos experiences nearby, so I just got the small. mmmmmmmmm it was WONDERFUL. We ended up ordering another hummos--large, this time, and she split the large 1/2 and 1/2--1/2 regular, 1/2 cilantro jalapeno (based on other Yelp reviews, we wanted to try it). We ate every bite. The pita bread came out warm (not like some places where you apparently have to ask for warm pita bread).  The pita chips weren't that good, so we ended up chucking them out to our dog, who gladly ate them all :)  The chicken portion on the salad was HUGE, as was the salad. Another reivewer mentioned that the chef didn't know how to cut the lettuce into normal pieces, and I agree. I shouldn't have to shove a huge partial-romaine leaf into my mouth or wonder how to cut it or should I rip it with my hands first, kind of an ordeal.  We ended up sharing my salad, as the gyro was big enough for 1 person, but my hubby works outdoors so he always can eat his and part of mine if need be.  Normal people would probably ended up having a doggie bag to take home.  If it's nice enough to sit outside, do so; it's right by the Lake at Andersen Springs and a lovely atmosphere."}
{"text":"My food (take out) was sloppily put together and sloppily wrapped. The staff was busy ignoring me while I stood there waiting for someone to ask what I'd like. They were very busy admiring each other. The food was average to not so good. I purchase catering for my company. And I'm always looking for a new place to get food for 100 or more for meetings. Pita Jungle is NOT on my list."}
{"text":"I love the cilantro hummus and blue corn nachos.  Great fresh food and chill vibe.  Also like the lavosh pizzas and salad, and they have great teas.  And for dessert the turtle cheesecake seriously gives Cheesecake Factory a run for its money.  Wish they had never removed their blueberry smoothie off the menu as it was a favorite of mine.  Please bring it back!  Also the fruit fantasia is delicious with generous servings of fresh fruit."}
{"text":"Eh....   This Pita Jungle is in my hood so my husband and I used to go here a lot.  Lately we've avoided the place because the service is sub-par.    Allow me to get on my soap box for a minute.  I'm a water-drinking kind of girl and I'm not going to apologize for that.  Just because I'm drinking the free water doesn't mean I don't want my glass refilled as fast as my dinner companion who may be drinking the ice tea.  You refill the ice tea - you refill the water. It's simple. So why do I have to remind the staff to refill my glass? Every. Time. Here in endeth my rant.   Seriously though if you're a vegetarian (like me) or you like Mediterranean food (also me) this is a good place.  Not great but good.  (I really don't think chain restaurants can be great but the familiarity is comforting.)   However the baklava is great!! If I was just rating the baklava that would get 5 stars. And the bartender Celia is very nice and chatty which we appreciate in a bartender.    Mostly we come here for the happy hour when money is tight.  You can stuff yourself on tapas and get a huge beer and the bill is only like $20!! (For two people)   If the service improves I will consider changing this review to 4 Stars."}
{"text":"I was served some dry , and over cooked chicken. I asked for it to be remade.  shortly after , they brought me some chicken that was chopped extremely too fine. It seemed to be a joke , because I could not pick it up with the fork , nor a spoon for that matter . I remember making eye contact with the cook on the line, and he seemed to be throwing a fit / temper tantrum of some sort , over selling me reheated chicken . This is my second experience here , since I've let my girlfriend introduce me to this , and we will not be returning , not only because of the disrespectful cook, but also because of the menu not being specific, about serving smaller than bite-size \"wood-fired,\" chicken ."}
{"text":"Came to lunch at Pita Jungle with 2 of my co-workers and I was a bit skeptical since I'm the only vegan but I was presently surprised to find lots of veggie options. I opted for the red quinoa with jalape√±o hummus with blue corn chips.  The dish was delicious and the serving was hefty. I had to take half to go which I ate for dinner. For $8, this was a steal."}
{"text":"I love everything here! I've tried the glazed chicken lavosh pizza, the chicken shwarma lavosh wrap, broiled chicken pita, chicken shwarma pita and possibly my new favorite the spicy chicken wrap. The wrap is huge and easily worked out to two meals. Prices are reasonable and wait times after ordering are always quick. We try to make this a weekly visit!"}
{"text":"Service was horrible. Waitress argued with us about menu items. Pita bread came out cold. Manager was nice and took off half our bill but it is safe to say we will not be coming back to this location"}
{"text":"Do you know where you are? You're in the jungle baby.  You're gonna die.  But at least you won't die hungry or unhappy.  The food here is awesome.  Really delicious stuff.  I can't say enough good things about it.  Except for the fact that Cafe Istanbul is across the effin street.  And I wouldn't say I choose one exclusively over the other, but more times than not, It's Istanbul, not Constantinople.  People rave about their hummus.  Which is raveworthy.  But I'm all about the Babaganoush.  I think eggplant puree is good clean fun.  But the name sounds like slang for some big booty.  And I think I've just found a new euphemism.  Go me."}
{"text":"MR C & I hit the jungle on our way home from our little staycation.  He had never been to PJ before, but I have.. the Tempe & Scottsdale locations. Im a fan of this place. I didnt realize there was one on the westside.. and then there it was.  What a charming place. I love the shabby chic vibe, and Mr C didnt care. He was surprised at how busy it was, and I was just thrilled to be there.  We had sandwiches and they were delish. Service just great.  Mr C was impressed and I was stuffed. :) We will be back and love the fact they ventured on to the West Side!! Yay! I am a fan indeed."}
{"text":"Great food, service was a little scattered though. I had the black bean veggie burger and the caramelized cauliflower, very yummy. But they messed up one of our dishes and seemed to have forgotten another so the food came out in waves. It all turned out alright in the end though and I won't hesitate to return."}
{"text":"I was so excited to have a good pita tonight at my first visit to Pita Jungle. I was so impressed by all the healthy ingredients on the menu and delicious-sounding dishes. The hummus with a mild kick and tzatziki sauce were wonderful although the pitas disappointed until my husband's gyro came--I realized I should have ordered all Greek pitas, which are thick and soft opposed to dry and tortilla-like. The falafel in my falafel pita was slightly over-cooked, and I needed a side of tzatziki to add to it to make it moister.  One edge of my pita was rock hard, and I had to tear it  off. The fresh made lemonade did not taste like it had any lemons in it - - it tasted more like a sweet mango Agua Fresca. My husband said his pita was perfect. I think I will enjoy coming back again if I order slightly differently than I did this time."}
{"text":"I've gone to different pjs throughout the state and always have a good experience.  I find that the food is consistent across the board which is great.  This was my third visit to this location and the only qualm I have is in regard to the staff.  I went by myself to do some happy hour yesterday before going to a dbacks game.  I sat at an empty bar and received service that was just okay nothing to write home about.  What I am writing home about is how four employees stood directly in front of the tv I was watching and continued to conversate about ex boyfriends and how one of the servers dated someone seventeen years older than them.  Maybe it was because I was alone at the bar and there were no other patrons talking to drown them out, but still.  How bout I don't want to hear your personal conversation while having my beer and tapas.  My beer was good and cold, my sauteed mushrooms and hummus trio were good, pita bread was dry almost as if it were a day or two old.  I'll definitely be back as I am a pita jungle fan and I love their food, but the service leaves something to be desired."}
{"text":"The food at Pita Jungle never disappoints. Everything is made with high-quality, fresh ingredients. Four and a half stars for food.  I have a problem with the inconsistency in service. One and a half star for service.   I've called ahead and placed to-go orders several times. I've never had a problem--everything comes out in generous portions and in a speedy manner.   Tonight we decided to dine in (well, on the patio). Big mistake. Not only were we neglected for most of the meal, but \"something happened to our ticket\" at the kitchen. Thirty five minutes after we finished our jalape√±o hummus and veggies we were brought some hastily-prepared food. Portions were considerably less than what I've received in my take-away orders.    Our server approached us as if he was a random customer. I didn't realize he was a server until he told us about the specials. He was sparse throughout the meal too. Didn't even apologize for the delay until he brought us the bill.   Maybe dining at home is the best way to enjoy Pita Jungle, which is a shame because this place has so much potential."}
{"text":"I love pita jungle!!! It's fast and fresh and healthy!!! They have the best hummus. We like the cilantro one. Even our daughter likes it!!! The salads are HUMONGOUS! But sooooo good I love the curry one. Also spicy chicken wrap is good. I want to try everything on the menu that's how good it all looks and sounds. They do take out too which is awesome"}
{"text":"Great happy hour and really good healthy food! The California wrap is my favorite. Try the trio of hummus and mini tapas during happy hour."}
{"text":"I love Pita Jungle and go often.  However, the location on Tatum has had extremely slow service the last two times I was there.  Today 4 of us went to lunch and it was an hour and a half!"}
{"text":"You know where you are,You're in the jungle baby,You gonna die!  In the jungle ,Welcome to the jungle Watch it bring you to your shun, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, knees, knees!  Because You just might Puke after what I'm about to tell you.  I Went to Pita Jungle for my first time, I order a diet coke, I took a couple of sips and then noticed that whole inside of the cup was covered in a thick grimy film. I though that maybe it was just scratched plastic, I scraped it with my fingernail and it came off... uuuugggggghhhhhh!!!  How incredibly nasty!!!!    I'm not talking a little bit of residue here folks I'm talking Scum Build Up from Hell!!   I wish I hadn't ordered already.  I take my glass up to the counter and ask to get a new soda in a  To-Go cup.  Once I sit back down I start looking around at other peoples cups and notice the same Funk caked up inside them as well and they are greedily sipping along without even using a straw..EEEEEEWWWWW So this was not an isolated incident.  How do you not notice that, Please tell me, How do you not feel it touch your lips......(shudders)....  As I sit waiting for my food, Dear God, I can only imaging what kind of filth lies behind the counter where no-one can see if this(cup grime) is the kind of stuff they are serving up right under our noses.  I begin to look around and notice that the cups are not the only thing with the foul gunk build up......the tables too.....Oh God I'm watching a woman let her baby eat right off of the filthy thing!  My Food arrives, The glazed Chicken pizza (see pics) ......do I eat.....it looks good.....smells good....... Well It actually tasted Delicious, Unfortunately I could not eat anymore than a couple bites as I was so disgusted with the filth of this place.  I had to rush right home and shower!  1 star because of the Scuzz factor  Are all Pita Jungles this repulsive?  if not please tell me which one is CLEAN!   I will never return to this location"}
{"text":"I recently discovered this place and it is right around the corner from my office.  I love the jalapeno cilantro hummus.  What combination!  I don't love that they charge you for extra pita.  It feels like a bad commercial (remember the got milk commercials where the guy thinks he's in heaven and is stuffing his face with cookies only to find out there is no milk?) but I guess it's a jungle out there trying to get pita.  Maybe my expectation is too high and shouldn't assume you can have another piece of pita bread for your hummus.  At any rate, I've been here a few times now and would recommend the place.  They have a guava lemonade that really is refreshing and I have to give a least for stars for that.  They gyros are also great."}
{"text":"Despite really knowing their stuff when it comes to Mediterranean food (killer falafel and baba ganoush), I now also think of them for great thin crust pizza.  The atmosphere is super cool too - try sitting outside at night."}
{"text":"I probably first started going to this Pita Jungle in 2001 or 2002. For the longest time there were only two Pita Jungle restaurants in The Valley. The other location was in Tempe on Apache Rd. Since 2005, they've just boomed all over the place.  I love Mediterranean food. It's healthy, delicious and exotic. The Pita Jungle introduced me to it and I will forever be greatful. One dish that this particular Pita Jungle serves that I haven't seen in their other locations is a lamb shank dish. Now I haven't been to this particular location for a year or two so I'm not sure if they actually still serve it. Lamb is a pricey dish so I don't always get to enjoy it. Whenever I get a chance to visit this location, I never fail to order it. It's tender, tasty and the meat easily pulls from the bone.   Another great feature at this location is the lake located at the back of the restaurant. It makes for a great view while you either sit by the window or in the patio. Whenever you finish your meal, you can walk it off on the paved trail surrounding the man-made lake or visit the other stores and restaurants that do business next to it."}
{"text":"The Pita Jungle first opened in Tempe in 1994. I don't remember when exactly I first visited this location, but it was probably that same year or in 1995. Since then I have probably visited this particular location somewhere between 50 to 100 times.   I'm really a big fan of this place because they were the first to introduce me to Mediterranean food. Beforehand, I was not familiar with words such as hummus, baba ganoosh, taboule or tsatziki. Ever since, I've been a big fan of Mediterranean food because of it's distinct flavors and healthy options.  The Pita Jungle in Tempe has evolved physically from the restaurant I remember when I was younger. It use to be only half as big as it is today. Right around 2005, they purchased the store next door and demolished the wall that divided them; thus, increasing their space to accomodate their large patronage. The parking lot they share with the small plaza they occupy, however, has not grown. Beware, the limited parking available during lunch hours on weekdays. Pita Jungle can get really packed.  The interior of the restaurant is decorated with various pieces of artwork from local artists on the walls which changes every so often. The ceiling is decked with exposed ducts, which give the location a kind of industrial feel to it. Also, the servers pretty much wear everyday clothing. In all, I kinda  get a California, somewhat Bohemian-feel for the environment. Although, it's probably lost some of that in the past couple of years every since it's grown.  I've tried all sorts of dishes at Pita Jungle, but my all-time favorite at this location is the Glazed Chicken Lavosh Pizza, When I use to work in Tempe, I frequently chose this dish. I really like all the other dishes I've tried at Pita Jungle. I guess it's just a matter of what you're in the mood for. My other recommendations if you are eating in are the Wood-fired Fresh Salmon, Spicy Mango Shrimp and Chicken Del Sol. I might point out that the Chicken Del Sol is a protein-rich dish containing chicken and beans. It's a pretty healthy serving for the low price of 6 to 8 bucks.   I don't frequent this particular location like I use to. Furthermore, I've only had one bad experience at this location, but why let one bad experience put a damper on my overall long patronage. I'm kinda tempted to give it 4 stars because my tastes have differed over the years, but I don't really have anything critically negative to say about this Pita Jungle so I would be willing to give it 5 stars."}
{"text":"This place is very cool. I love going here to eat on the weekends. There is just something about their One-Thousnd Bean dish that makes me order it every time. They also have the best Green Tea I have ever had."}
{"text":"Service is sometimes too slow and unattentive.  But food is always good and happy hour beers go well with the happy hour hummus trio tapas."}
{"text":"Food and drinks were good, they could use some more staff, service was slow, but expected since the bartender was tending to bar, and the whole restaurant. Common sense would be to have two bartenders. She gets 5 stars for the way she handled things."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to go for a slightly more upscale, but still pretty authentic Mediterranean dinner. Of all my favorite pita places in Tempe, of which there are many, Pita Jungle has one of the best pitas around. Their Phillie chicken pita is to die for, but everything I have had here is quite good. They have daily specials that are usually very delicious and often quite popular.   I love this place for the atmosphere perhaps most of all. It is a cool little hipster joint that I can enjoy sitting and talking with friends with over happy hour, taking a date for dinner, or just enjoying the patio on a nice afternoon. If you are ever in the neighborhood and looking for a good lunch with a great atmosphere at a pretty cheap cost, you have to check it out."}
{"text":"Incredible service!! Very friendly and educational. In and out within 15 minutes in a rather complicated order for two. Ethan (the bartender), although we weren't drinking made this visit an experience. Can't wait to come back!!"}
{"text":"Great food. Great prices!!! Fast service!!!! Friday night and very busy, but still very quick seating and service. Middle eastern food with american twists."}
{"text":"I had heard so many good things about this place. But I'll admit, I wasn't very impressed.     I ordered the gyro and the meat looked like lunch meat slices. It was pretty good though. But I did add a lot of tzatziki sauce. My side was rice. Just rice. No seasoning or anything. Just a lukewarm clump of unseasoned rice.     My mother in law ordered the sampler appetizer dish. The hummus was nice, the baba ganoush was pretty tasty, the dolmas were good, but the tabbouleh  was mostly coarsely chopped parsley.    I ordered the baklava for dessert. I have a serious baklava addiction. This baklava.... it was weird. The pastry itself had very little honey in the nut mixture. So it was super dry. Instead of a drizzle of honey over the top, it appeared they poured a bunch of corn syrup instead.      Our service was decent. The restaurant was clean, but it just felt as though it was trying too hard to be trendy.    Will I go back? I don't know. I can get better Greek food at some of the hole in the wall places I've tried."}
{"text":"Tasty food, best hummus ever, great service, modern deco (but a bit loud of an atmosphere) and great value!   Hubby and I ordered: Steak and hummus trio (u can pick any three off the menu) - I really like the plain hummus (had a yummy smokey flavor) and roasted bell pepper.  Kafta pizza - thin crust and generous w the meat topping Shawarma pita - most popularly ordered item. Juicy chicken breast!  Bill came out to $28 and we had leftovers due to the large portions!"}
{"text":"Ordered food to go - got the broiled fish sandwich with garlic new potatoes, we ordered the blue corn nachos, and lastly got the hummus trio with seared ahi.  Broiled fish sandwich: really? The fish was actually only about 50% of the size of the sourdough bread it was placed on. If you were to eat this as a sandwich you could take around 2-3 bites on each side without ever biting in to fish. Pics to follow. The potatoes were great and it was appreciated that the aioli type sauce was in a separate container for me to use at my own discretion. The fish flavor was fantastic, however, when I order any type of sandwich I expect proportional sizes of the bread to ingredients making up the sandwich itself.  Blue corn nachos: was appreciated that the corn chips were separated out from the goop that makes up the nacho topping - flavor was good, not over the top but definitely an item worth another order.   Seared ahi with hummus trio: normally we order the grilled chicken with hummus trio but wanted a different protein- the flavor was good as usual, however, the number of seared ahi pieces seemed about in half of what has been received at other locations in Tempe (both the old location and new). Flavor was good but seeing the lack of ahi was a bit frustrating. No pita was provided with the meal either.   Why is this a 2 star rating?  Had I not eaten at pita jungle dozens of times over the last 9 years at this location and others around the valley it would have likely received more stars. Coming from past experience where I know there is never a skimping on portions or on the quality of the food provided this was a giant let down.   I have eaten a few times at this location for lunch and even at the peak of the lunch rush the attention to the detail of food is far higher than it was tonight.   Hoping this isn't a permanent problem for this location, however, it has left me questioning whether pita jungle will get further business from me if the inconsistency becomes a habitual problem."}
{"text":"One of the best places for hippie food in the Phoenix area.  Its not 100% authentic Mediterranean but its still good.  The prices are less than fine dining but the experience and food feels like a fine dining place.  However they give generous portions and I could have easily given them 5 stars if Haji Baba's Chicken Swarma wasn't twice as good as Pita Jungle's :)  This place seems to be constantly improving their menu and is a must go to for a date or just to try it out with some friends."}
{"text":"We ate at Pita Jungle for the last time last night. Which was disappointing because I was craving some good hummus, warm pitas, and a healthy kids meal for my son. The quality of food has seemed to have gone down immensely in the last couple of years. The chicken was dry and cut into little crumbs, the fruit was not fresh, and the pitas were stale.  My son's potatoes were burnt black and I'm shocked that a restaurant  that offers such healthy choices serves kraft mac N cheese from a box as a side for kids. The servers are always friendly but the food is less than par."}
{"text":"Great fresh food. We ordered the Mediterranean Platter. Highly recommend sharing, lots of tasty Mediterranean tapas. Our bill was incorrect. Our waitress billed us for one too many drinks. Probably innocent."}
{"text":"We had a lovely dinner on the patio on a busy Saturday evening. Our server Allen was clearly in the weeds, but maintained a kind friendly demeanor. I really appreciated that even with as busy as he and the kitchen were ,all the food came out specific to my gluten allergy. And it was delicious, we had roasted cauliflower, garlic mushrooms, and shared Mediterranean salad(no tabule). Staff did a great job at accommodating us. Great job, thank you we will be back."}
{"text":"If you want a regular restaurant to eat at for lunch or dinner or happy hour, this is your new home!  I've never had a bad meal here and always trying new dishes.   The dishes are huge and I recommend sharing.  The hummus trio is great to split.  The salads are all amazing.  And of course, you have to get some kind of entree or gyro!"}
{"text":"A very lively place! The place was packed, so you know the place has a solid reputation. I had the spicy chicken wrap...HUGE portions! A delicious pita, nice amount of heat to the \"spice.\"  Would have given 5 stars but for the slow service. Not a knock on our server...she was working HARD. But she had like 6 or 7 tables; WAY understaffed. I felt bad for her, and for the other servers who was hustling so hard. It wasn't a dealbreaker for me though; I would come back most definitely!"}
{"text":"The plain hummus now comes with grilled corn on top. It was ok. Bring a jacket or a cardigan I always freeze here!"}
{"text":"Stop into Pita Jungle afyer leaving MIM. Ordered the curry chicken salas and a kiwi strawberry green tea. The salad was delicious seasoned just right and uou get plenty. I had to get a carryout. There is such a variety to choose from. It can get noisy because everything is open...  but food was delicious.very healthy...thats what i love the most."}
{"text":"My favorite Pita Jungle and the least pretentious. Minus one star for food inconsistency, hopefully this issue gets ironed out with time."}
{"text":"Good eats and good service! It's pretty much Greek food with a lot of vegetarian options. Not as good as authentic Greek food I've had, but a nice substitute."}
{"text":"This place is great. The portions can last you for a couple of days and our waitress was wonderful. I ordered the grilled veggie salad, absolutely delicious. I ate about 1/3 and was full. My husband had one of the wraps and it was also very good. I don't think you can order a bad thing on the menu. I wish they had patio seating but other than that, fantastic."}
{"text":"I've been going to Pita Jungle since it was a twee, one-room hovel on Apache, back when we had to walk uphill in the snow with no shoes for eight miles and shit. Seriously, I'm a long-time devotee. Back when I worked at that Planned Parenthood next door, it was 1000 Beans for lunch... every day. (Many apologies to my former co-workers and patients.)  So I've watched the gradual growth of PJ with some interest. Who doesn't want to see a locally-owned business thrive? When I saw the latest installment of the Great PJ Takeover occur in the form of a food court presence at Fashion Square, however, I have to admit I was somewhat befuddled. The dirty dreadlock crowd, attempting to permeate the premium-gas-only-SUV Louis Vuitton crowd? Doesn't this shit only happen in the movies?  I've been to this location twice now, both times out of desperation - staunch refusal to eat excrement from Panda Express versus inability to maintain attention span long enough to wait in line at Paradise. I had a falafel salad that was just covered in the most rank and odiferous onions known to mankind. My second visit, I wised up and got the falafel sandwich-no-onions, which was wrapped in a half-reheated and totally dried out pita and covered in said devil onions. Now, mind you, lunch and a pop there will easily put you out $10. That's too much money to leave unsatisfied, with roaring heartburn and breath that would singe Satan's chest hair off.  Plus, the people taking orders are impatient and a little snotty. Sorry if you've run out of patience trying to explain falafel to Middle America. Please don't take it out on everyone else.  Three times may be a charm, but I don't think I'll be back to this location..."}
{"text":"Tried it for a first time new location. I asked about a spicy magnotini the bartender said it was disgusting. She had a sore attitude then when she came back she was overly nice. Like fake nice.   I had ordered a trio platter of hummus. I do love their cilantro one. So I was a little curious why it was taking over twenty mins to slap some hummus on a plate with some pita chips.   My boyfriend asked if it was coming up and the bartender immediately said that she forgot about it and didn't remember UNTIL her said something.   That just solidified her presence as a person for me. Did t really feel like eating after experiencing that."}
{"text":"This was a totally different experience than what I had at another pita jungle. Loved the atmosphere here as well as the bartender. I think her name was Layla super sweet woman who really knew the menu  The sangria and Greek salad with chicken was a perfect pairing although it would be great if they carried a certain sauv blanc the crossings. It's a perfect white wine for any afternoon."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places in Scottsdale for a quick, inexpensive but good, semi-healthy meal. The pita de Sol style is terrific. I've had quite a few items on the menu. My favorites are the philly steak pita, spicy chicken wrap, chicken del sol, and the chipotle chicken lavosh pizza. The offer take out, so you an call in and your order will be waiting for you (as always, be sure to check your order for correctness before you leave). The place is never empty, it seems to be quite popular.  When you first enter, there is a bar. You can eat at the bar, or just relax with a glass of wine. The servers have always been friendly. Sometimes service can be slow when they are crowded, but that's to be expected.  All in all, a great choice for a casual meal."}
{"text":"Food's great here. Service not so much. Last time I went there for lunch with my 6 of my coworkers we waited for one hour, (even after we called and told them a big group was coming for a birthday). We didn't get our drinks refilled and barely got our food 5 min before we had to leave to go back to work and one of our orders got lost/was forgotten (most of us only get a 60 min break for lunch so no time to get lunch sonewhere else). The manager was nice enough to not charge us for our food. I didn't wanna go back during lunch because of what happened to us last time but five of us went back today (again, food here's delicious! ) and we had the same issue again. We waited for 50 min, other tables were served before we got our food (and some of them arrived after we did) and 5 min before leaving, our food arrived. We even sat outside just so we didn't have to wait extra time for a table inside the restaurant.   I understand lunch time's a busy time in the kitchen ans the restaurant was packed but this is a recurrent issue every time we've been there. It's unfortunate because their food is very good. My gyro was yummy and very tender. The garlic potatoes weren't all that great today.   All in all, I don't think I'm coming back. I understand this isn't a fast food chain and it takes time to prepare your order but more servers/cooks during lunch time may be a good investment for this restaurant. I work Downtown and I can get yummy food close by without having to drive/wait for over 45 min to end up either eating super fast before I have to go and not enjoying my food (which is the main reason to get out of the office) or taking my food to go and eating it on my desk, which is what I want to avoid when I go out to eat."}
{"text":"My first experience with Pita Jungle was very disappointing. The server that took my to-go order was awesome, very polite; it was just the food that was absolutely dreadful. I've had gyros from fast food chains that blew this one out of the water. I don't understand having pickles on a gyro to begin with, and this thing was covered in pickles, there were literally pickles in every bite. Instead of the black olives I'd requested, they used kalamata, which I had to pick out all of those, along with the pickles. That I could have dealt with, but what I could not handle was the fermented flavor of the overly ripened tomato slices, or the fact that the only lettuce used were nothing but the pieces with large ribs. So...after picking my way to a little over a quarter of the way through I found loads & loads of red onions, like they'd grabbed a whole handful and thrown them in one place. I just gave up at that point and threw it in the garbage. I honestly don't know anyone who could have stomached that thing."}
{"text":"No matter what you're craving, Pita Jungle can not only fulfill it, but it won't make you feel like crap after you eat it! I've eaten here once and the ambiance is really great! It's usually crowded but not too loud. Everyone that works here are incredibly friendly, as well. Most of the time, I just get to-go orders. They have salads that are to-die for.   Lately I've been eating Paleo so food choices are limited, if not impossible, when I'm going out to eat. Not here! They have something for everyone no matter your diet (gluten-free, vegetarian, paleo, etc.)    To sum it up, you can't go wrong with the Jungle."}
{"text":"Great service. Great food. The triple hummus was great. The chicken in our dishes was fresh and tasty. Definitely recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"love the range of mediteranean and american food here."}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't tried a Pita Jungle sooner and I can't wait to go back!  The atmosphere was fantastic. Sprinkled with local art on the wall, the place was bright and welcoming. The restaurant was clean, neatly laid out, and fresh.  The food was AMAZING! Is there another word for amazing? Because that doesn't do it justice. Unbelievable, hit the spot, fresh, super, fantastic. I ordered the honey glazed chicken pizza and will never think of another pizza the same way.  The value was great. For $22, we had an excellent meal with great service in a wonderful location.  GO TO PITA JUNGLE! You won't regret it."}
{"text":"I'm pregnant and DYING for the amazing hummus and grilled chicken. My husband has been craving his usual mahi mahi dish. Please open a restaurant  in Dallas!! :)"}
{"text":"Eating vegetarian there is just not that exciting to me...I've eaten enough hummus in my life that it's no longer exotic or unique to get a plate of plain hummus with some pita. Maybe for others hummus is still exciting?  I had their blueberry shake a few years ago and thought it was wonderful but got heartburn afterwards, so I've never tried it again. I would recommend it though. It's made from yogurt and blueberries (I can no longer tolerate cow yogurt). I like their tofu scrambles too.  I would have given it three stars if not for the last experience I had here at the indian school location. I got the salad, on special and thought it was too acidic and needed some protein to mellow it out...like nuts. About halfway through (because I'm distracted by feeding my child), I remember that the menu said it came with pine nuts. I stop eating and try to flag down the server. About five minutes later (not kidding...poor service) when I'm about to just walk to the kitchen window myself, the server sees me. I explain it to him and he goes to the kitchen with my plate. They say they did put nuts on it. I said, no they didn't. And then they say they did and they're sorry, but they can't give me more. ???  Yes, now you all know that either I have short-term memory loss or I like to lie to get lots of pine nuts because I have a pine nut addiction and I just HAVE to have them and will go so far as to lie to my waiter to get them. Wtf.  I didn't eat anymore of the salad. I lose my appetite when people falsely accuse me of lying (especially about pine nuts). I don't need to go back to Pita Jungle. The hummus was overrated anyway! I can just go to the Mediterranean deli on 16th st!"}
{"text":"i do so love pita jungle! i usually get the mediterranean platter, which is enough to share and has a bit of everything on it. a few times i've gone they've been out of falafel but are more than happy to subsitute. the chicken lavosh pizza is also amazing. this location doesn't have the usual servers named \"starflower\" or \"rainforest\" and i like that. the leftovers are always good as well- a definite plus in my book!"}
{"text":"I thought this place was small and drive through, but I was way wrong. It's a super huge sit down restaurant with happy people working. I loved the dolmas, I ate the whole order when I wasn't supposed to. And the chicken was really good too. I won't hesitate next time."}
{"text":"The tapas at Pita Jungle are sooo underrated.  The fact that, at $1 -$2 a piece, they are incredibly economical is almost beside the point. With so many healthy and delicious options that allow a \"late nighter\" like myself, that is also not a big eater, an opportunity to have a quick, easy, nutritious meal makes Pita Jungle stand out among the late night options.  The staff is eminently professional, sincere as well as inviting. Not once have I felt \"out of sorts\" while being served.  They rotate the art on the wall every month or so giving local artists a chance to present, which is cool.  Not being into art myself I can't really speak to that other than to say, having watched the ritual \"changing of the paintings\" gives the sense of investment in the local community as well as, well, a ritual that makes it seem the place isn't stagnant but a perpetual state of reinvention.  Come alone, bring a friend, or the family.  You won't be dissapointed by the tapas hour.  - John"}
{"text":"Oh, Pita Jungle. I'm so glad I moved to this part of town where you're just down the street from me!  My first visit was last weekend, when I was meeting a friend for lunch and suggested Pita Jungle. I'd never been before, but I had heard very good things -- I had high hopes and they were about 99% satisfied. I assumed the place was a counter service-type restaurant, but I was pleased to find out that it was a bit classier than that, having full table service. The original Tempe location on Apache and Dorsey is very open and bright, though still cozy and inviting. My friend and I showed up shortly after noon on a Saturday and the place was moderately crowded, though we were seated right away. We split the plain hummus as an app, and it was some of the best hummus I'd ever had! Very smooth and creamy, which I prefer over some restaurant versions which retain some of their chunky/grainy texture. The flavor was excellent, not overpowered by either the lemon, garlic, or the tahini. The small order of hummus came with one pita, which we split, but we still had quite a bit of hummus left over. We each ordered the iced tea to drink, and were served a passion fruit-flavored tea that I thought was very good, but beware if you're a fan of regular, plain iced tea and think that's what you're ordering (Adam Carolla would have been pissed). For my main dish, I had the Turkey Pesto Lavosh Wrap, and my friend had one of the daily specials, which was 4 mini pita bread tacos (Pacos!). I know one variety had chicken, onion, a pineapple-mango relish, and cilantro, and I think the others had steak and pickled red onions, among other things. The service was rather quick, though I think our server left a little to be desired. He seemed as if he'd just woken up from a nap and seemed a bit confused at times, though his demeanor improved steadily through the course of our meal. My wrap was absolutely gigantic, and it came with a side Greek salad which was great. Beware of the kalamata olives, they're not pitted, so don't break a tooth! The wrap was very tasty, with crispy grilled lavosh bread and lots of good veggies. I took half to go as I was quite full from the first half and the salad, and the hummus to boot. We split the check and I think my total bill came out to $16 and change before tip, which might seem a bit pricey, but I did take home a sizeable portion of leftovers -- the half of my wrap, and the rest of my friend's Garlic New Potatoes that she got on the side and did not finish.  I went again later in the same week and got the same wrap, to go. It was just as tasty as I remembered, though the lavosh bread was not quite as grilled as the first time I ordered it. Still good though!  I got an order to-go again today, and decided to go with the California Beach Club, subbing grilled chicken for the usual turkey, an order of the potatoes, and an iced chai latte. VERY fast service, which was almost startlingly fast, though super friendly. I made a good choice with this meal, the wrap was very fresh and had lots of tender seasoned chicken and fresh, crisp veggies. The potatoes were once again excellent, and the pita club was just as large as the lavosh wrap. I saved half of each of the wrap and the potatoes, so even though my order total was $17 and change, I will get another full meal out of it! The pita wrap came with a side of tzatziki sauce which was very good, though I think it could've used a little more garlic. I also asked for a small side cup of hummus, and they even threw in a warm pita to go with it even though I didn't request it. Nice touch :)  I'm already daydreaming about my next trip to Pita Jungle. I'm glad there's a place in my neighborhood that has such fresh, tasty, healthy food choices!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love pita jungle itself. This location was awful. We ordered hummus as an appetizer and requested the kids food to come out ASAP. Not only did she not bring the kids food out first but waiting to bring everything including the appetizer together. We asked for different pita chips since they were now cold and we saw them sitting there forever to which another waitress just wanted to argue about how pita chips are always cold, multiple times. I do not care that your location serves them cold, just bring out warm ones. Will not be visiting this location again."}
{"text":"I had only been to Pita Jungle once before and I was pleasantly surprised to experience it once again.  I ordered the spicy chicken pita wrap and it is absolutely delish! Loaded with vegetables (huge plus), packed with chicken and mixed beans (hello protein!) and lovely seasonings for just the write amount of punch! Best part- no cheese!!! (I don't like to intake dairy too often). We sat at the bar and got great customer service from the bartender. She was blonde and super friendly (forgetting her name- sorry!) They had outdoor seating and are walking distance from a lot of cool spots downtown. Paid under $15 for my meal including tip. And this pita was large enough to have lunch leftovers next day. Winning!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for over a year.  Never had an issue or complaint. Especially like the rotating taps and the fact I can switch out meat products for tofu. The staff are first rate. Whoever conducted the hiring interviews knew what they were doing. Superb team."}
{"text":"LOVE everything about it. Especially that they have one in Pasadena so i can get my fix when im back in school!"}
{"text":"I have been to almost every Pita Jungle in the Valley and this location is top 3. I always like to sit at the bar and Ashley far outweighs all the other bar experiences. She is knowledgable, friendly and knows her stuff. Ashley knows my order every time and makes me feel welcome and at home! Try their Buccaneer Wrap!"}
{"text":"Star ratting is based on SERVICE!!  Service is unreliable.  Sometimes you get ok service, but a majority of the time its HORRIBLE service.  I've had waitresses make a fuss when we wanted to change tables cause she seated us at a dirty table.  My potatoes arrived burnt and i got attitude when I asked for new ones (they were literally black).  On another occasion I was served a chicken wrap (I am vegan, and ordered veggie).  I didn't know it was a chicken wrap until I bit into the wrap.  Had a discussion with the manager about that.  On a separate occasion, I received a dirty cup, so I asked for a different glass.  The waitress was too busy or couldn't be bothered to help us so a \"runner\" brought out a new glass.  This glass was ALSO dirty (there were black marks on the glass)...the runner had an attitude and suggested he bring me a disposable cup, finally he brought me a clean glass.  The food is just as unreliable, but I'd say more often than not it is good, just not worth the service.  If it was not so hard to eat vegan in the valley I probably would never come here.  The hummus is ALWAYS yum yum yum."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick dinner. Sat at their small but cute bar. One of the male wait staff took a look at us and responded with a strange and unpleasant reaction. Not a pleasant greeting at all. We ordered our dinner from the female that asked to take our order. She wasn't very pleasant either. Our food came. The same male waiter came out with a load of silverware and put it down infront of us on the bar and started wrapping them in napkins. It felt very odd, like of all the places to do your work,  why stand facing us within 2 feet and do this.  Still no pleasantries from him.  Then another young man came out to join him. He had a strange smirk on his face as though there was an internal joke going on. They were  standing at our small eating area to do this work.  The food ended up not being very good. It's disappointing because I had not been in a pita jungle in a couple years. I recalled that their food was always good and pleasant people to interact with.  I left with a strange feeling that this male waiter decided he didn't like us from the moment we walked in and the joke was that he did something to our food. I will NEVER eat at this location again!"}
{"text":"One word HORRIBLE!  $45 for two falafel salads. They forgot to include the pitas and utensils in the bag . Falafel was cold and gross. I want my money back!"}
{"text":"I love this place. It's in a little corner on Apache but big in heart.   The food isn't just for vegetarians or \"green\" people. There is chicken, fish, etc. The fruit fantasia platter is delicious for breakfast. My favorite dinner meal is the mahi mahi with humus. The service is always really attentive and polite.   This location is decorated with original artwork that really compliments the atmosphere. It's just a great, cozy place to chat with people with delicious foods."}
{"text":"Another one of my favorite places, especially this location!!! It's right along the lake, so I definitely recommend sitting outside before AZ's summer heat catches up with us! The food is always delicious, and the service is excellent! They come and check on you frequently and your food comes out pretty quickly. For hummus, my recently new favorite is the Jalapeno-Cilantro (not spicy). For entrees I recommend the Chicken Pasta Salad, the Ginger stir fry, or the Broiled Chicken Pita. Honestly though I haven't had anything here that wasn't good."}
{"text":"We discovered Pita Jungle when our daughter gave us a newspaper article that discussed the best places for vegan/vegetarian dining in the Phoenix area.  Pita Jungle was on the list and since it was near our hotel, we decided to give it a try.  It's not strictly a vegan/vegetarian restaurant---it does serve entrees with meat, chicken and fish.  Upon first entering, we noticed that the decor was nothing to write home about.  However, we feel that doesn't matter if the food is good.  We were greeted by our server who told us to pick a table and she would bring us some menus.  She was very friendly and helpful.  In fact, she talked us through the menu---even making some suggestions.  Surprisingly, despite the restaurant's name, she suggested not ordering a pita sandwich because---as she put it---you can get pita sandwiches in many other places.  She also warned us that their entree portions were huge.  We decided to go with two of her recommendations.  I ordered the Lavosh Sharwarma Wrap and my husband ordered the Lentil Fatoosh Salad.  About the Lavosh Sharwarma Wrap---Lavosh is sometimes called Armenian cracker bread and comes in a crisp or soft version.  This wrap had the soft version which still had a cracker like consistency.  It was very tasty---the chicken was moist and flavorful, the grilled vegetables (tomatoes and onions) were well prepared and complimented the chicken quite well.  However, the garlic sauce which had a mayonnaise look and consistency was on the bland side.   This sandwich comes with a Greek salad.  I asked the waitress if I could get the salad without Feta Cheese since I'm not a fan.  She said that was OK.  The salad had lettuce, tomatoes, red onions, cucumbers and Kalamata olives that had pits in them.  The dressing was a lemon vinaigrette.  All in all a great meal.  And, yes, it was quite filling.  I ended up bringing half the sandwich to our daughter!  About the Lentil Fatoosh Salad.  This consists of lentils and rice with carmelized onions over mixed greens, tomatoes, cucumbers, red onions, pita chips and lemon vinaigrette.  My husband---much to his suprise---really enjoyed it.  I tasted it and agreed with him.   The flavors melded very well together.  Again, he also couldn't eat it all and our daughter got some of that!  When we asked our waitress for boxes, she said, basically, \"See?  I told you it was a lot of food!\"  To drink, I had their freshly made lemonade and it was very refreshing---not too tart yet not too sweet---and refills were free!  My husband had an orange flavored Pellegrino water.  He was quite surprised to see that on the beverage menu!  It's too bad we're not planning any more Arizona trips as our daughter is moving or we certainly would return to this Pita Jungle!"}
{"text":"Food is really good and server was outstanding.  Extremely loud inside, tables very close together and menus were FILTHY!!"}
{"text":"Love pita jungle!  This location has the fastest service of the all the locations that I've ever been to. Their roasted bell pepper hummus is the best. Get that with chicken, and you're set. Their chipotle pizza is great as well. Almost equally as good!   Perfect service, great staff. Will be back here!"}
{"text":"I have been living only 6 minutes away from this place. I love pita jungle, it's always been that way. This location is right off the 10, so it's super convenient. Their hummus is the best around. Everything about the entire menu is great. Awesome variety to order from. Staff always super friendly! I will forever come here until I'm tired of it."}
{"text":"Customer service, very poor. Sat next to a homeless guy that kept bugging me and my wife. We got very concerned and uncomfortable so we left. He decided to drink our drinks after we left. The staff let him stay after they saw him go up to our table. Very unprofessional. Do not recommend if you want to go for a nice meal. (Ps waited 32 mins to order before they came to our table!)"}
{"text":"The food is amazing and healthy! Love the Portabella Mushroom burger, it is top-notch and has such great flavors. Be sure to start out with the Roasted Red Pepper Humus, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Mmmm I LOVE Pita Jungle. The honey pasta salad is my favorite and they have amazing humus. Pretty much everything on the menu (that I've tried) is fantastic and they have a decent wine selection. Great place for a date, or dinner with friends - also has a decent brunch/lunch selection."}
{"text":"For years I harbored under the mis-apprehension that this was a fast food Pita place.  Must've been confused w/Pita Pit because when I finally tried the one in Flagstaff, discovered they had an immensely attractive, healthy and varied menu and a FULL BAR!  What more could you ask for?  When I returned to bake in the VOS, I tried this location and have the same opinion."}
{"text":"This a nice place to meet for quick bite to eat with family and friend.  They have greay healthy options.  I love the kids menu.  The staff is great at adjusting anything on the menu per your dietary needs.  Love the salads and appetizers.  Great happy hour as well."}
{"text":"Not bad......kind of a small location and the outdoor patio floor needs a sweeping up! Food was ok.......my biggest gripe with ALL PITA JUNGLES IS ........... 3.00 soft drinks and i wish the hot sandwiches  ( gyro& philly) came with something...anything.  That always kills me ...l. 6 bucks for 2  drinks? So 2 sandwiches no sides and 2 cokes is 25.00 with tip. Pita jungles have good tastey food overall."}
{"text":"First time there, sat outside love that ! Ordered Mediterranean salad with chicken , a hummus combo & the swarmma sandwich, the pita bread was warm and yummy, good service quick."}
{"text":"This place has been my go-to for quite awhile.  I haven't gotten around to writing a review on Pita but after the laudable service i received from a server named Tennessee (Brittany) this week, i felt i have to give her extra praise in a review.  She was affable, solicitous, and meticulous in her service.   Definitely ask for her."}
{"text":"I was seated and served quickly. I had the chipotle black bean burger which was delicious. The back patio seating was great!"}
{"text":"Food  was  great!   Lots of selections.  Went during lunch so the  only downside was that our  waitress was  really busy."}
{"text":"This place is perfect for lunch or dinner. We have had a few company lunches here and I have also gone here with friends.  They give you lots of food and it is always fresh!  The hummus is amazing and be sure to go for happy hour in the evenings as it is great prices on all their appetizers.  Their salads are large as well and will fill you up so be careful :)"}
{"text":"Stars as follows:  1.) They have a great happy hour which allows me to sample new foods/foods. Drinks are standard but good price.  2.) Staff is nice 3.) ordered the fruit Fantasia and it was beautiful and delicious.   Stars taken off as follows:  1.) Ordered a Falafel pita which contained 4 pieces of falafel that were very bitter and not fresh at all. It was gross. They put more lettuce in the pita than anything. It was a lettuce pita.  2.) My bf ordered the chicken tikka masala which did not taste like that dish at all. The coconut was waaaay to over powering.  P.S- if you don't eat the pita quick enough it gets very hard and stays hard."}
{"text":"We ordered take out here yesterday and the person that took our order was Gabby. She was very rude and impatient. Once we got home, my mom was half way through her burger and she bit into a plastic stick that had no business doing there to begin with. After that she just through it away. I am very disappointed on last nights experience because pita jungle is one of my favorite places to eat."}
{"text":"I love this place! I wish they had them in California.  I go here very time I'm in AZ at least 2-3 times.  The food is always great, the place is clean and the staff is awesome and kind."}
{"text":"Always good! I love the Chicken Pasta Salad especially when you don't want something too hot or heavy when it's over 100¬∞s out. The lemon vinaigrette they put on it  is my favorite. Happy Hour is a great deal and the service is always consistent. I reccomend the hummus trio for sure!"}
{"text":"I'm always a fan of the garlic chicken and hummus; it's an appetizer but I get it for my meal!  Also, if you happen to be a peanut butter banana (best smoothie combination IMHO) smoothie person like me, try Pita Jungle's!  It's so thick and creamy!  Yum!"}
{"text":"Pita Jungle is pretty consistent and has never let me down.  This was my first visit to this location.  It was clean and the food was fresh.  My party was 10+ people so service was a bit slow for the second half of the group (we arrived separately and ordered at different times, but I was in the first half and my order came out quickly and correctly)  I had the Tomato Carpaccio Salad which was really good -  it was a special on the chalkboard, so I'm not sure if it will be around forever. My only complaint was that the restroom had a strong sewer odor, but I would still visit again if I was in the Mesa area!"}
{"text":"We LOVE the gyro, the hummus, lavosh, and the lentil fetoush salad is to die for! You can't go wrong at pita jungle! Yummy food, great healthy options and friendly staff!"}
{"text":"We came here simply because it was right next to a frozen yogurt place next door. My fianc√© had the shawarma pita and I had the red quinoa jalape√±o hummus dish. His was good, but the chicken was quite dry. Mine was amazing!! Red quinoa with arugula and kale, tomato, cucumber, red onion, feta, EVOO, lemon over jalape√±o hummus with corn chips. Mmmm mmm delicious."}
{"text":"Always good food and good service. The menu is varied enough for many people to find a great selection."}
{"text":"I've always enjoyed Pita Jungles food but the service I received on my last visit was most impressive. Mark in the bar made my experience even better. He seemed to know every person that he had at the bar and even most of the Togo customers as well...  The Chicken Avocado special came with high recommendation and rightfully so. I hope it makes the \"big\" menu in the future... Thanks Pita!"}
{"text":"Mmmm...chipotle black bean burger...GET IN MY BELLY.  Pita Jungle is one of those places that you just feel cool eating at. It has a hipster, artsy vibe to it and everyone is over the top nice.   As stated so slyly above, my fav is the chipotle black bean burger. I get mine with no bun, because I am not about to let bread fill me up when there's a tasty little dish like this one on the table (they have cranberries inside of the burger!!!). It comes with a side of chipotle hummus and garlic new potatoes, which are so flavorful and good.  Second fav is the falafel pita. What's a falafel you ask? Well, it;s heaven in a round crispy garbanzo bean package. If you have never had one, just try it. You will like it."}
{"text":"Awesome as always. Everything I've tried is amazeballs. I keep bringing friends Lol.  The cilantro jalape√±o hummus is forever awesome, at every location. The chipotle chicken flat bread pizza is bomb.com, but I usually sub tofu instead of the chicken and it's surprisingly WAYYYYYY better than the chicken!!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered food to go my FAVORITE spanakopita....burnt! I honestly am shocked that they would even let it go out the door like that....this was really bad not just a burnt spot, the whole dish, it wasn't even edible: and living a good 30 minutes away makes It difficult to just bring it back in. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Josh was our server and he is amazing! Top notch food recommendations with ways to customize it that were delicious. He is funny and charming."}
{"text":"I headed over to this Pita Jungle for the first time last night for my birthday diner. It was delicious as always. The service was better than I have had at the Mesa and Tempe locations. The fact that this place is so close to my house could be dangerous. We ordered a Chicken Pasta Salad, and the chicken was grilled awesome. I have always loved this dish, but tonight it was spectacular. My boyfriend tried the Mediterranean Chicken Salad and fell in love. Easily one of his favorite dishes. He loved the flavor that the white raisins brought to the dish. We also started with a small humus with all three flavors, and an extra pita. My only complaint for the evening was that the pita bread was harder than I prefer, I assume from over warming, but that didn't stop me from eating the entire thing. I also love that they have a covered patio that over looks water. I'll be back soon. Oh, and beware that parking in this plaza is frequently full."}
{"text":"We love going to pita jungle. The food is always fresh, the restaurant is tidy , and the staff pleasant.  Its a family favorite! We appreciate them giving back to the community!  :-)"}
{"text":"This was not my first meal at Pita Jungle and I am already a fan. It was however my first time at this location in the Gold Spot. The building and space are great, and certainly outshine the other strip mall locations around town. We started with Happy Hour Tapas and wine that are priced just right. The tapas portions are SMALL but they only cost $1.50 to $3.00 and a great way to taste a few diferent things. We both had the same entre of roasted chicken on spinach with smashed potatoes and tomato garlic broth. It was tasty although the Chicken lacked any kind of roasted qualities, it almost looked poached. none the less it's something I might order again. We had great service as expected from our server, she was very attentive.  Lots of good stuff above but now for the bad,  FLYS & BUGS! and LOTS OF THEM, not all the creatures buzzing around the table were standard flies, Im not sure what they were but the unwelcomed dining companions never left with a constant dive bombing and ear buzzing. Owners and managers cant ignor this and need to figure out how to get rid of them. For this reason alone, I probably wont rush back. The flies were the sole reason I didnt rate with 5 stars because they were that bad!"}
{"text":"I'm a \"90-10\" vegetarian, and I gotta say...I LOVE THIS PLACE! Healthy, delicious, Mediterranean-style food cooked to perfection and my favorite veg restaurant to go to.  Service is always fantastic. Even the less healthy dishes, such as hummus and the cheese crisp, are cooked to lighter, healthier perfection without sacrificing flavor. Warning: this place LOVES to put onions on dang-near everything, so be cautious of that. Kinda hipstery, but nonetheless a lovely place to go and chat."}
{"text":"First time eating at a PJ and this one was pretty good. It was lunchtime (1:00) on a Friday, so they were busy and inside was loud, but we wanted to sit outside near the water anyway. There was a short wait, just a few minutes, and when we were seated the server was very helpful answering questions. I got the Ahi Tuna with hummus starter, and i was able to get fresh veggies instead of pita bread, and my boyfriend had a chipotle chicken pizza. He's a pizza nut and said it was really very good. The tuna was spicier than i expected, hotter than the cilantro jalapeno hummus it was on top of, but all delicious nonetheless. We were both full by the time we got done, and I took home my extra hummus, along with a couple of large to-go cups of lemonade and soda. Will probably be back in the future, just at a time when they're not so packed."}
{"text":"Pita. Jungle is my favorite they have fantastic happy hour tapas and their Greek salad is to die for. I love the people at the Indian school one and also downtown too ....real friendly staff and really cool ...,can't say enough good things about the pita jungle"}
{"text":"I have eaten at a bunch of other Pita Jungle restaurants and I typically enjoy their fare. My Pita was literally just meat, it looked like a ground beef taco. It was soaked in grease and soggy. My girlfriends pizza looked okay I suppose but I was very disappointed in my meal.   Pretty surprised at the lack of vegetables in my food compares to the other Pita Jungles I have eaten at. There was literally like 3 slivers of onion and 3 small chunks of bell pepper throughout the whole pita. The meat was also dry overcooked.  I gave this place 2 stars because I like OTHER Pita Jungle locations..."}
{"text":"I don't think I have ever been to another restaurant that is as hit or miss as this one. I have been here a couple of times and had a pleasant experience with good food, then the next couple of times, the service is awful and the food is dry. It is truly a wonder how food we took as carry out was better than eating in the restaurant. Also, really bad cocktails. Don't know how those get messed up as badly as they do... but definitely don't count on their drinks! It really varies with the staff, and lately they have had too many misses that makes me think I won't be going back."}
{"text":"I go here fairly often and can say the food and service are consistently good. The wait staff is friendly and the bartenders are great too. I really enjoy the Yellowfin tuna salad, and of course the the Gyros. The Fruit & Cheese Fantasia or Garlic Dip are great appetizers. They have a large outdoor patio and a full bar as well. Not too far of a walk from the Central/Roosevelt light rail stop."}
{"text":"PJ is always good. Their hummus is so smooth and delicious, add a side of cukes and build perfect bites with pita. I usually pick between the spinach pasta salad and the chicken shawarma pita. The falafel was good and so was the black bean burger, but I've found my favorites. Fresh lemonade is usually really delicious too."}
{"text":"My friends have been raving about Pita Jungle forever. I don't know how it's taken me so long to get here! We went for happy hour recently and ordered quite the spread...how can you not when everything is less than $3?!  The hummus trio ($1) was much less than expected but nonetheless, really good. It was basically a teaspoon of each hummus; even our server agreed it was very little and brought us a second. The jalapeno was my favorite. The baba ganoosh ($1) was soooo good- and there was plenty of that to go around- although I may have eaten most of it myself! We enjoyed the dolmades (2 for $2), and the falafel (2 for $1 were delicious). I ordered the garlic lemon chicken ($2) for myself, and had to shoo away random forks that kept landing it in- it was a very generous portion, so I was nice enough to share a few pieces. Other than the happy hour dishes we ordered, we got a cup of the cocunut curry soup (?) which did not disappoint- in fact, it was so good, we got a second cup!  The restaurant itself is quite large inside, but opted to sit outside. The patio is also a nice size and is shaded, which was perfect on this unusually hot winter day.  Happy hour is definitely worth the trip, and I can't wait to come back and try some of the amazing looking salads and pitas I saw!"}
{"text":"Found this place with Yelp reviews and it did not disappoint!  All 3 of us loved our food. Fresh, yummy, and great service and price!"}
{"text":"This is my third timei had a phenomenal experience at the val vista pita jungle location in Dana park! They even catered to my gluten free diet restrictions. The best part of the restaurant (even more than the delicious food) was our waitress Desaree!!!! She is extremely professional, friendly angives great customer service!"}
{"text":"I'm impressed! I came back to give this Pita Jungle location a second and third try... On both occasions the service was vastly improved! Jocelyn and Melissa were our servers and both were extremely friendly and upbeat. They did table touches, refilled drinks, and generally made it a place that I would be happy to continue visiting! Lindsey was our hostess both nights and made us feel welcomed right from the start as well as running our food as soon as it was up so we didn't wait at all! Definitely recommend giving it a try if you are in the area. The atmosphere is much better and all of the employees seemed happy to be there and not so down. Also, the staff was dressed in appropriate attire for the setting."}
{"text":"Admittedly, I've only been to the Pita Jungle in North Scottsdale. It's nicer than your average Pita Jungle - feels more like a restaurant/bar (I think they have a full bar!) than a fast food place but offers the amenities of both.   I use Pita Jungle a lot for large office orders and they never disappoint. Orders are always right, service is solid, restaurant is clean. They're quick and great for a healthy lunch bite. The only reason they don't get 5 full stars from me is because they're just not *quite* as yummy as some of the other Pita places in the area, but overall a solid spot for lunch or a quick dinner. I recommend the falafel salad - less calories because there's no Pita - but their Pita is good so dealers choice."}
{"text":"this isn't like your fast food place in the mall. This is sit-down dining with a full bar. We had a great meal and uber fantastic service to boot. Nice outdoor area to eat in, but keep in mind this is in a shopping center -- not scenic views.  I had the salmon, which was perfectly done. Lots of very healthy meal options here. Definitely will be coming back!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite lunch places to go to, and it turns out they have a great happy hour as well! $2 small plates to try samples of some of their popular menu items (tomatoes and mozzarella, falafel, hummus, for example). The serving size is small but adequate for the price. They also have $3 wine and beer, which is great!  The only drawback is their sangria is not included in the happy hour. In addition, my mom and I ordered a carafe of sangria, which was $7.99 (compared to $3.99 an individual glass). It ended up being two glasses anyway, so no savings there.  The food is always good. Not mind blowing, in my opinion, but good. And very healthy with lots of vegetarian options.  My favorite dish so far has been the tomatoes and mozzarella appetizer, but my boyfriend liked the regular gyro and my family enjoyed the chicken shawarma. It turns out they have a special seasonal menu, which my waiter was kind enough to suggest during a moment of indecisiveness.   The inside decor is nice but I felt a little cramped sittings at our table with four people. It also felt a little industrial rather than homey or relaxing. The patio, however, is awesome. People sit out there even in the summer, thanks to their giant mister system and fans. And it faces east to avoid the sun.  A great place to meet friends for happy hour, or take out of turn family for lunch. I'm so glad it exists in desert ridge!"}
{"text":"I love Pita Jungle! I frequent the one on Indian School and 40th street, but make it around to the one in Peoria and the one on Shea. Regardless which one I go to the service is great, the food is fantastic and the crowd and atmosphere has wonderfully warm energy.  The only thing that I have not enjoyed greatly was the Broiled Chicken Pita. It was a little bland. I have tried so many other dishes and they are all wonderful.  Love you guys!!!"}
{"text":"Nice.  My man talks about this place all the time when he visits the area and I tried it today for the first time.  I'm a big fan of Mediterranean food, and this didn't disappoint.  Was it the most authentic and spot on falafel, dolmades or tzatziki I've ever had?  Nah.  But it was solid.  And the wraps we got were tasty as all get out.  I'm officially a fan, and if I lived here, I'd be a regular."}
{"text":"I am big fan of Pita Jungle. I have been eating their hummus and sucking down pitchers of their amazing lemonade there for years now.   The food is always amazing. The hummus is my favorite appetizer. Especially the jalape√±o cilantro hummus. Very legit. I love the spicy chicken wrap, the mix of veggies and chicken is perfect..FYI on this dish it is huge! Could feed two and still be stuffed.  I can write books on the lemonade and ice tea.. The tea and lemonade together, talk about deadly combo..   Each pita jungle is consistent with how good the food quota is as well and taste. Whether you're in the good court or one of their nice sit down locations.   They has a good wine and local beer selection. Good chill atmosphere and art as well. In and outdoor seating.  Basically ONLY reason this is 3 stars is because I just got take out. I got home and there is no pita bread for my hummus and that was just a major bummer."}
{"text":"I've been to this Pita Jungle a few times, about 3-4 and ordered carry-out once. Every single time my experience was great. Great service, great food, and great atmosphere. I've ate at the patio once during a rare cold winter night, and the waiter, without us even asking, put a heater right next to us. It was really nice and kept us warm while we ate our food. At times it gets busy, but the wait has never been too long and annoying. This place is great, and compared to other Pita Jungle's I've been to (the one on Shea, Tempe, and Downtown Phoenix) this Pita Jungle has to be the best. The ambiance is nice, and the decor is very welcoming. A big open room for the dinning space works well."}
{"text":"Awesome hummus plates.... Especially the hummus with cilantro!!  Awesome cauliflower app... I don't even like cauliflower but that app was amazing.  My wrap was just ok."}
{"text":"First off resturant was extremely noisy so do not come here if want a conversation.  Next food was tasteless.  Had no flavor and it took forever.  Service was horrible also we ordered appetizers and two entrees and everything came at once.  We complained about it and was told \"now get try everything at once!!!\".  Really????  Needless say never going back.  Do not understand how its so busy, people must have horrible taste in food!"}
{"text":"I went to Pita Jungle for the first time last night. Even though I just got my dinner to go, I still got wonderful customer service. The young lady at the door greeted me very nicely and the young man at the front register even helped me choose my dinner. As I waited for my food, I felt that the environment was very lively and positive. They finished my order quickly and it was incredibly DELICIOUS! Next time my vegan sister and her boyfriend come to visit, I am taking them to Pita Jungle."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere.  Lovely lake to look at.  The food was very tasty and our server was very friendly."}
{"text":"Yum, yum, yum!!! I love right around the corner from Pita Jungle, and because it's fresh and healthier, I end up there at least twice a week!! My go-to is always a chai tea latte and a hummus trio with grilled chicken! The chicken there is SO tasty! They have a regular garlic hummus, red pepper hummus and jalepeno lime hummus, all of which are so so so good; hence why I get the trio that includes all 3. It's garnishes with spices, cilantro and my favorite pine nuts!   The chai tea late is probably from a plastic container that's pre-made, BUT it's soooo good! They garnish the cup with an orange with is a delightful addition to the tea too. Probably one of the better chai teas I've ever had.   I also got the chicken combo platter last night for the first time and it was really good. I substituted the rice for grilled veggies, and it was enough for two to share. The chicken has a great crispy outside and a really juicy inside, which is perfection. The veggies were really good, with a side of great mixed beans, with a garlic potato mash sauce which is SO good on everything. It's garnishes with onions and pickles which I usually dump all over my chicken and veggies. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Very nice staff, waiter was wonderful, happy hour menu was affordable and varied. Definitely will go back."}
{"text":"I've eaten here several times and have always enjoyed a good meal and solid service.  They have a large patio that's lovely when the cooler temps arrive and a large inside dining room.  The food is very consistent and flavorful.  I love the gyro's and the hummus plates.  They also have great salads.  My wife is gluten free and is always able to find something good on the menu."}
{"text":"Was really impressed with the customer service at this location. Every single person was in a great mood and was happy to chat and be personable.   As at every Pits Jungle, the food was great. I tried the gyro prepared as a platter (served over brown rice instead of wrapped in the pita). Great decision! And I still got a pita on the side :)"}
{"text":"I wish we had one of these in Utah. I love their lentil salad. The hummus is really good too."}
{"text":"On my many travels I look for places which are trying to make a difference. This place hands down beats many restaurants in food quality, type and service that i have been too. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I go here often and I love their gyro. Usually, it is very fast-food type and pefect place for quick lunch. The decoration inside is very modern and casual."}
{"text":"I went here with my mom for lunch the other day. The atmosphere was terrible The waitress was lackadaisical and on top of that I found a critter in my salad. Shame because the other locations are very good, yet this one is horrid. Defiantly needs improvement and I don't recommend going to this location under any circumstance."}
{"text":"Hands down best Jalapeno hummus around; have them top it with their grilled seasoned chicken and some pita bread and a side salad you're set! They have an endless menu of amazing food, for every person.  'Nuff said."}
{"text":"The Cilantro Jalape√±o hummus = heaven in my mouth. No seriously- the hummus and the grilled chicken on top is so tasty and surprisingly healthy. I was definitely a lil brought back that Pita Jungle came to the food court of the mall but I can say it hasn't lessened the taste or value of the food at all; just made it that more convenient to pick up some of their amazing food. Anything I've had off the menu, ranging from their salads (both leaf and fruit), the hummus and the pita plates, it's all great food."}
{"text":"I love the location but the service last few times I've been there has been really slow and for lack of better words is really poor. There's two specific girls that are always behind the bar that take to go orders and they just don't look happy to be there and have been some what rude when I placed my order. Will I continue to come here, yes because I love the food but always get my food to go. No reason to dine in there if the customer service is going to continue to be the same"}
{"text":"We've never had a bad time here. The food and the service have always been good. I like this location the best.. it has a more local, hipster vibe. They have art for sale by local artists decorating the walls. Even a few I would buy if they were in my price range.   This is one of our go-to places for a quick, delicious, healthy meal. Sometimes we forget about it and we're debating about where to go.. Then one of us will remember Pita Jungle and the other one is like.. OOOOO, Pita Juuuunngle!\""}
{"text":"At the mall, where should one go to eat? Pita Jungle! Was so glad to see this in the mall because to be honest there is nowhere good to eat nearby. The prices are great and the portions are huge. Grabbed a soup for only 2 bucks. This place is a gem"}
{"text":"I have to start out by saying that the service is so much better here then it was 4 years ago.  I met my BFF for lunch here the other day, and even w/ school still out, it was packed. We werte, however, quickly seated. Our waitress was prompt, nice, and attentive. The food was good, as always. I had the California pita, she had the taboule (sp?).  My only real complaint about this visit is about where we were seated: a little 2 top right inside the door. Which, dont get me wrong, was fine. Im not one of those people that usually complains about being seated near the kitchen or the door, except that everyone that came in after us packed inside to get out of the heat. And my fellow patrons were RUDE. Im sorry, i understand not wanting to wait outside, but DO NOT push up against someone who is seated at a table, block said person in their seat, and proceed to have a very loud, VERY inappropriate conversation over them. Im just thankful these guys werent spitters, cuz I'd have gotten a shower. /rant  I digress. Food- good and too much, as always. If theres one thing to be said about PJ its that you definitely get your moneys worth. Service- great, it really has improved over the years and Im glad. Ill definitely go here again, and hopefully will no have to elbow some people away from my seat."}
{"text":"Although this joint is by far one of the best restaurants NOT kept secret - I wanted to share my delicious experience with their temporary summer menu, inserted in their regular menu.  We ordered the \"fried cauliflower\" - it has now become a  pregger-status craving (anyone can have these cravings - sans baby!!) they are cooked, creamed with a yogurty sauce and mixed with fried sweet onions and dusted with curry powder, and at $3.99 you have no commitment. Just try it!  We also ordered a chopped chicken salad - I have no idea what the name was but it had a great flavor - and the addition of grapes and celery just made you want to take your clothes off and run through the sprinklers. THAT good.   Also, I wasn't aware that P. Jungle had a Happy Hour - let alone a REVERSE Happy Hour - which I would probably be more inclined to go to. I think they have $2 beer and $3 house wines - but the HH ends at 530 - a little early. Reverse HH starts at 9pm and offers a ridiculous array of cheap apps - $1 hummus, etc.   I O.D.'d on pita jungle awhile back - but I'm back baby!!!!"}
{"text":"So glad that Pita Jungle has come to downtown finally!   We have been big fans of this local chain, but have to say our favorite one is the Arcadia location.   The food is just as good at this location, but the service is the issue.  Whenever I order takeout from this location I have asked a few times for them to walk out the food to my car so I don't have to bring in my 2 toddlers, and each time they act like they are so busy and just wont have time to bring it out.  They have also done it but make comments on how they have gone the extra mile for me.  It's not like the location is that packed..  When I have dined in the dining room the service is also a bit lacking.  For food -  The glazed chicken lavosh and then cilantro hummus is amazing.  I also love the chicken and hummus plate."}
{"text":"Last year, my friend took me to all her favorite places in Phoenix and the surrounding area. One of her favorites is Pita Jungle.  I had this gigantic \"burrito\" called the Medchilada which was more like a burrito wrapped in lavash and covered with cheese and tomato slices. While the cheese and tomatoes were fine, I realized belatedly I don't enjoy lavash. After a while, I was excavating the thing for chicken. I like black beans better than pinto but they were serving the medchilada with pinto beans.   The side of brown rice was over cooked and flavorless. I have to say they did make pretty good humus! I liked the roasted red pepper one and the jalepeno one topped with pico de gallo. The regular hummus needed some more olive oil and perhaps flavor (it was better two days later after the flavors had melded together).  Service was pretty slow but we weren't in a big rush."}
{"text":"Just normal Mediterranean food that didn't leave a huge impression on me. Wasn't horrible but wasn't amazing. I wasn't really hungry when I was there so a soup and sharing some appetizers was all I needed."}
{"text":"Let me preface this with a simple statement: I absolutely LOVE the food from Pita Jungle!  That being said, there are a few things that irk me about Pita Jungle.  First, the music is very loud. I'm noticing this is a common theme with the new wave of restaurants that are opening. I have asked a couple of times if the music can be turned down, but the reply I hear over and over (at multiple locations, mind you) is that the music is at \"company standard\" and that I can sit outside. This is rude, considering it is the middle of the summer in Phoenix.  Second (and this is a personal problem), I really, really wish there were french fries. I know this sounds silly, but they really do taste amazing with hummus. Oh well, the personal battle ensues.  Third, most of the people that are hired are pretty snobby and incompetent. This sounds rude, but I was in the customer service industry for a long time. I know I have high standards, but I minimally expect people to do their jobs.  Anyway, I eat here all the time. I just get the food To-Go :)"}
{"text":"This used to be one of my favorite restaurants, however, tonight we have had the worst service, food took over an hour to come out. They brought hummus, no pita. Then we asked for the pita and the waitress acted clueless. The manager came out to apologize for the wait and offer some free additional hummus to tide us over. So, she offered, and that took another 20 mins to come out! Seriously?? 20 mins?? The worst part of it all is that they're not busy! 3 other tables are seated in the whole place, this place used to be packed on a Friday night! Pretty sad considering they have excellent food and could really stand the test of time, if they could get their stuff together!"}
{"text":"Food is delicious & the staff is great! They are very friendly and helpful. Special thank you to Selina & Jon."}
{"text":"I used to live across the way so i ate there a lot.  I'm basing my review on the fact its mixed of all the times I've eaten there... I only had one meal which was very lemony and very salty and ... it was during happy hour, and the waitress brought new and also didn't charge me.   GET THE ROASTED VEGETABLES.  AMAZING.  I beg for the dressing recipe everytime I go.  They also have a salad with corn in it which will last for three days its so big.   my girlfriend gets salmon everytime and says its the best in the valley.  Shes well traveled. LOVE THIS PLACE, it gets hoppin on fridays and especially on first friday."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of Pita Jungle,  this is the location closest to my house so I'm there all the time.  I highly recommend it.  The food is always excellent,  the happy hour is incredible,  service is always friendly.  The only thing is that it's always freezing so I would definitely recommend you bring a sweater."}
{"text":"I can do Pita Jungle anytime.    The lentil salad is actually really good if your looking for something light, or if your hungry the chicken shawarma is always good.  I took my mom to the one in Tempe, where I used to go all the time, I guess I forgot how crowded and loud it gets in there, but she liked it.  They usually have a flavored iced tea which is good.  Like I said, I've been doing the jungle for years and have never had any problems with the food.  I hope I didn't just jinx myself.  **Update:  Went to Pita Jungle in Chandler today and sat on the patio.  They are on a little man made lake there and have a slight problem with ducks.  Don't get me wrong, I like these cute little guys.  But when I'm eating my lunch and there are five of them at my feet fighting over a pita, then a gust of wind comes and blows around duck feathers, that grosses me out.  Then I look down on the metal grated table and see some sort of bird poo in-between the grates that my silverware was just sitting on, ick.  We moved inside.  Maybe some tablecloths would help?  Oh and also the tables on the patio are packed in so tightly you have to squeeze to get through, and the next table is like 5 inches away, not cool.    I think I'm going to reluctantly have to downgrade my 4star to 3 star."}
{"text":"Besides the great food the manager Mike does a great job getting people sat as quickly as he can with limited seating. The Mediterranean Chicken salad is the best. My wife and I share it all the time and the kiddos love the garlic dip. Can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"I love going to this place, has a good vibe and food is always good. They have the best hummus and i love there ahi tuna..it is a must go"}
{"text":"Quick stop for lunch with the family! This place had something to accommodate all 5 members of the family.  I had the Gyro pita which was very good.  My wife had the Caesar salad which she said was fantastic.  The service was solid! The kids meals offered plenty of food!  Definitely a good quick lunch stop for the family!"}
{"text":"Pita is amazing.  It is one of those places that you discover and are slightly upset that it took you so long to find it.  Now i feel the need to eat here as much as possible just to catch up!  Food amazing! All of it. Hummus(s), Tzatziki, Gyro, Quesadilla, salads and all of the above.   There service is always spot on the last time I was there Macie was our server and she was fantastic.  Very efficient, checked on us, kept our glasses full but overall was just very pleasant and kind.    The atmosphere here is great.  They have great outdoor seating.  They stay fairly busy so it can be a bit loud at time.  Nothing that bothers me but people more sensitive to sound for sure.    I will be back many many many more times.  Learn from my lesson, don't waste time not eating here."}
{"text":"A few of my friends are obsessed with the Jungle and eat there at least twice a week, sometimes four times a week. I expected to fall in love immediately, but instead the relationship has been platonic at best.   Having been dragged along by my friends on multiple occasions I've been able to try many of the menu items. So here's the good, the bad and the ugly of Pita Jungle...  The Good: ---------------- Lentil Fatoosh Salad - This lentil, rice and crispy onion and pita topped salad is one of my favorites. It's served warm and when fresh has a really great balance of textures and flavors. It's no good leftover (as with most salads)  so share with a friend or bring a hefty appetite.   Blue Corn Nachos- My favorite appetizer item. A huge plate of blue corn tortilla chips is topped with numerous types of beans and more cheese than I've ever seen on a plate of nachos. It's accompanied by a side of tsatziki and pico de gallo. I recently shared just this with a friend and couldn't even eat half of it.   The Bad -------------- Medchilada- This gigantic burrito, which makes a Chipotle burrito look tiny by comparison, is rather disappointing. In this case, size DOESN'T matter. From the bland chicken and beans inside to the boring side of brown rice and pico, this dish is dull from beginning to end.   Pesto Pizza- This doesn't taste bad persay, but I've had a microwave Healthy Choice pizza that tasted better. It's small, made on a pita and just isn't very satisfying. It pales in comparison to the glazed chicken lavosh pizza which is rather tasty.   The Ugly --------------- Store bought pitas from a restaurant who prides itself on using fresh and healthy ingredients. I understand that homemade pitas might be a lot to ask, but do the store bought ones have to be stale? Half the time I've ordered hummus, my pitas haven't tasted fresh.   The waitstaff- Their website claims to have \"fun and creative\" people, but they are far from that. I've heard fans of this location defend the waitstaff as just being \"laid back\" and \"nonchalant\", but I can't help but feel they are just unfriendly and inattentive. They will bring you fresh drinks in to-go cups with no questions asked, but it'll take 10 minutes to get them.   --------- Maybe I'm being harsh, but for a restaurant with such hype, I had high expectations which have never been met. I do like that I can sit for hours and never feel pressured to leave. That and the few dishes I enjoy are enough to keep my coming back, even if I have to spend half the time wondering where my waiter has disappeared to!"}
{"text":"I love the Philly Cheese Steak Gyro!!! YUUUUMMMY!!!!! Only reason I give 4/5 is I hate how expensive it is. I would go more often if the prices were more reasonable."}
{"text":"This is a staple. The food is always fantastic and fresh. We eat at PIta Jungle at least once a week. It is very affordable, very fresh and fast. Unfortunately, I'm a creature of habit and rotate between three things; chicken and hummus, chipotle chicken flatbread and ahi tuna salad. The humus is amazing, they have multiple options and you can divide them anyway you would like. We generally do half cilantro, half roasted red pepper with spicy chicken on top. Even though it's listed an appetizer, it's a hearty meal. The tuna salad is served rare with a refreshing citrus vinegarette. There are pj's all over the valley, I highly recommend stopping in at lunch time."}
{"text":"Come here for lunch at least once a week. Food is great service is awesome. Wait time can grow if you come during Lunch. The patio is awesome during this time of year as well. Love the hummus and chicken."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places. I have never had a dish that I haven't liked. It's great to have a place that you don't have to change so many items just to make it healthy. Wonderful food great staff."}
{"text":"Ugh. I love it here. So. Much. One of my favorite locations is this one! Their Mediterranean chicken salad is to die and recommend ordering an extra, delicious dressing! Their wraps are great as well as their hummus trio. The jalape√±o cilantro hummus is by far the best. Honestly, I love everything here and you'll never go wrong with anything on their menu! So, go here and order one of everything !"}
{"text":"Great quality food, great service from staff, nice decor, and has an outside covered eating area. Price is absolutely reasonable. Tried the lavosh and a hummus plate. Delicious flavors and all the ingredients tasted fresh. Staff accommodated our large party who trickled in and switched seats. Happened to stumble across this place unexpectedly--glad we went."}
{"text":"Amazing! Amazing! As I walked in the staff were  inviting and kind. i sat at the bar and the bartender was very educated on what they served, which is helpful when you want to try something different. The food was made quick, big shout out to the cooks. Point is, I'd definitely recommend this place and I'll be coming here often."}
{"text":"Good food ... But servers were very slow to provide additional sauce and pitas. Almost like they figure if the customer waits long enough, they will say it's never mind too late. However, my companions waited them out!"}
{"text":"My experiences with pita jungle and all their locations have been nothing but pleasant. I grew up with this kind of food, being of Armenian and Iraqi background the food is delicious. Yeah a few tweaks here and there to attract the American consumer but all done with great taste. This is not my first time at this location as my work peeps like to come here, last time we were there at lunch rush hour and boy it was busy, and our table was over 10 people. This time It was with a smaller group and I got the grilled vegetable salad and added 5 pieces of falafel and it was one amazing combination. The grilled eggplants and zucchini were tasty with the mix of the leafy greens and tahini drizzle a vegan, and tasty dish for sure. Our server was very friendly and attentive, and gave us refills to go on our drinks. We also went when it was slow but I can tell you even if you go to this location on a busy day at a busy time, they will take good care of you. Keep doing the great job you do there guys."}
{"text":"Pita Jungle is a local favorite! It is now one of my favorite places to go as well. We went on a Sunday for lunch, it was moderately busy. We were seated and our waitress was by a short time later to get our drink orders.  The menu is filled with a ton of Greek/Mediterranean goodness.  They have salads, wraps, pitas, pizzas. I chose the roasted chicken Mediterranean pita. It was very good.  Our food was out in a timely manner, and just as visually appealing as the taste.  This location is located in a strip mall, offers outdoor seating, and is tastefully decorated. They offer take out, and there is a separate entrance for the take out orders. I think this is a great idea as it reduces the clutter in the lobby. This will definitely be a place I will frequent!"}
{"text":"My wife, son and I went to Pita for the first time on Father's Day.  What a great experience we had.  Amazing food and our server (Cristal) was amazing.  I would ask for her seating area, but I am sure ALL the wait staff there is amazing.  My wife and I were surprised how yummy the food was.  Totally didn't expect that.  We will be back there again, that's for sure.  Thank you Cristal for making our first time there a great one at that!!"}
{"text":"I like Pita Jungle, and when I've been eating like a pig for a while I like coming here to get a nice salad or a healthy pita, but for me, inconsistency is the rub.     I typically like the kinds of things I get here, but sometimes my blue corn nachos come out fresh and delicious, and sometimes they come out with hard beans and a few stale chips. And my spicy chicken wrap may come out juicy and hot or luke warm and dry. Now look, it doesn't stop me from coming here, but it keeps ME from being the one to suggest coming here. And the salads are always on point, try the caribbean, it has more delicious fruit on it than I want to list, or the mediterranean chicken salad, it has pine nuts, and pine nuts are great.  If you haven't tried Pita Jungle you should, it's a Tempe hot spot, the Tempe experience isn't quite complete if you haven't been here, just know they aren't always at their best."}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere at Pita Jungle, especially this one.  The prices are very reasonable and the service has been great the past times I have gone.  The cilantro jalapeno hummus is so good!  Ask for the greek pita when you order it.   It is different than the pita that they usually give you.  It is extra soft and goes great with the hummus.   The shawarma is delicious as well.  I am not a fan of pickles so I asked to get it without and it was really yummy.  Portions are pretty big/decent size as well.  Another plus is that we didn't have to wait very long for our food.    I am rating it 4 stars because the happy hour is from 3-530 on the weekdays.  Not the best time frame.  Most people get off around 5 so I don't see how many could be able to go."}
{"text":"Been missing out my whole life. Good fresh reasonably priced healthy food that still has flavor. Can't beat that"}
{"text":"This place is kinda badass.  I've been to two dif locations and like them both (consistent).  What I like about medit. food is that you can eat relatively healthy low-fat food and it tastes great 'cause all the spices used in preparation.  I've gotten the platter a few times and its great."}
{"text":"An imaginative menu of healthy items make PJ a nice addition to the concentration of restaurants along N 7th St.  Service issues from a recent visit were promptly addressed by management after they were made aware of them, and I am hoping this location is able to establish a strong foothold among its neighboring restaurants"}
{"text":"Great food and fair prices but wow...talk about bad attitudes.  I feel like they are doing me a great favor when I go in.  There is absolutely no need for rudeness and this has been the case in every location I have been to."}
{"text":"I went there yesterday and first of all, this is a very popular place, there were quite a few people in there for a MOnday evening. I had Tabouli Salad and Portobello Burger. Way more food thgan I could eat . The service was excellent. My kind of place!"}
{"text":"Well all right, all right, all right...You guys are alllll right in my book! Every time I dine at either this location or one of your others, I have an overall great dining experience.  BTW, it is ALWAYS packed whenever I eat here - which I think is a great sign.   Lots of menu options also for the extreme vegan, vegetarian or straight-up carnivore, like myself. Can't go wrong w/their delightful Gyro.   Service is always helpful and attentive. Servers are always smiling and have a \"pep in their step\".  I don't know about you, but I thoroughly enjoy my meal AND am satisfied, but yet walk away with the \"healthy and light\" fullness that you don't get w/eating junk food. Very nice."}
{"text":"When I first moved to Arizona I used to obsessed with this place.  The hummus was amazing and they had some delicious entrees.  Now that 5 years have passed, the novelty of Pita Jungle has worn off.  Now it seems like everything is oversized portions with bland flavors."}
{"text":"This restaurant is incredible! To start, my friend and I shared a large order of the cilantro jalape√±o hummus. The large order was maybe too much for 2 people but it was delicious and we took the rest home (it was still great the next day). I had the Caribbean salad, which was amazing but I was hoping for more lettuce in it- it was pretty much just a fruit salad with a couple leaves at the bottom. Either way, it was incredible and a very generous serving of \"seasonal fruits\" (strawberry, apple, banana, grapes, grapefruit, orange, cantaloupe, watermelon and honeydew) for a very reasonable price. My friend got the blue corn nachos with chicken and she was very satisfied with them. Nice fast paced atmosphere and I really appreciate their concept of healthy and natural eating."}
{"text":"Since working in Scottsdale Fashion Square I have stopped at this location many times. The service is usually pretty good and whoever takes my order usually has a smile and a friendly greeting. I enjoy the vegetarian chili and occasionally the philly chicken pita. The reason I am only scoring this location a 3 star is because my coworker has found a fly in her falaffel pita not once but twice in the last two months. The only reason she found this was because she eats her pita open faced rather than folded. The manager of course took care of the situation and profusely apologized and we have since given Pita Jungle another chance but I'm not sure how many chances a restaurant that serves bugs should get. Just be wary that while the food generally tastes good the kitchen quality may not be the best. I am very cautious every time I eat here."}
{"text":"Had lunch here with my husband The carnivore and the vegetarian seldom agree when it comes to restaurants  I ordered the roasted cauliflower and tahini with lentils and brown rice My husband , the philly steak pita no onions no cheese  Great lunch for well under $20.00 Fast and efficient service  Customers are treated well"}
{"text":"I have never been let down, not at this location at least... The food is always very tasty and consistent.  I always sit at the bar and the service is awesome too!"}
{"text":"I've decided to boycott this location. Every time I dine in or take out, the food is very different.  Different portions, different tastes, always different... I frequent the Desert Ridge location, so not all is lost :-)"}
{"text":"Ahhh just got my order (via post mates) and it looks so good!!! Then I ate it and it was good. Just as suspected. I gotta always have the garlic potatoes with my order. And don't forget the extra pitas!"}
{"text":"This isn't a pita jungle we usually go to. So their menu was different. We ordered something for take out and when we got home we didn't like it. There was nothing wrong with the food. But we took out the cheese and think we ruined the food. So we called and said we didn't like it. The management was amazing. He was so sweet and helped us find something we would like better after we described what we wanted. We took the food back and got the new recommendation and it was much better. We're really thankful and grateful for such great customer service. We felt so bad about not liking what we ordered when they didn't even mess it up."}
{"text":"When the middle east hits the west. I tell you it gets no better than this location. I have dined here since this location first opened its doors and the food/service is always consistent. Even though I dine here mostly for lunch when I get an opportunity to do happy hour they have some amazing tapas. Perfect to go with a happy hour special drink.   If you're looking for a healthier option with flavor and flare this Pita Jungle location is the place to be. Food for all dietary restrictions and kid's meals for the little ones.   My favorites and recommendations are: Sizzling Salad-Broiled Chicken Cold-Greek Salad Pita-Broiled Chicken  Wraps-Spicy Chicken Wrap Tapas-Garlic Chicken Lemon and Pine Nuts (YUMMY) Sides- Garlic New Potatoes and Pita Chips"}
{"text":"My wife and I have been married for 22 years now and we generally find picking a great restaurant that we can both agree on a bit challenging.   Pita Jungle is the first place we've ever come back to 3 times within 24 hours!!!  The food here is delicious - pretty healthy - and features a great blend of flavor combinations. My wife loves the salads and I'm into the Pitas, wraps and pizza. Sure wish we had this place in Austin!!!"}
{"text":"The service is good. The food is very good. The price is below market. When we cant think of a place to go on a busy night, we end up at  the Pita Jungle. Never a wait, never a disappointment."}
{"text":"I love pita jungle. I came here at 8:30pm on a Friday night. There was a small wait but they just ask for your cellphone number and they text message you when your table is ready.   This place has such a wide variety of healthy dishes that all taste amazing. I highly recommend the cilantro jalapeno hummus. I ordered the Mediterranean chicken salad for my entree and that thing was gigantic and absolutely delish. They don't drown the salad in dressing so you can actually take it home and eat it the next day!  I highly recommend this place if you are looking for a healthy meal!"}
{"text":"The food is excellent and the service is always wonderful!  A great place for people with all kinds of dietary needs that has never let us down"}
{"text":"This Pita Jungle is awesome Great staff and managers  And they fix an incredible Salmon salad Keep up the great work  I go to this Pita 3 times a week"}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times. Location is a bit bohemian for lack of a better description, but that is not a bad thing. It has its charm. Service is generally good and what can be expected from this type of restaurant. Last week we had small hummus as an appetizer, which was a nice little starter to our lunch. I had the falafel pita and a side of beans. My lunch partner had the vegetarian burger with garlic roasted potatoes. The pita was good, although I don't like the added pickles (i forgot to ask to not include them) and had to ask for the tahini sauce, which normally comes with it. The beans were very good. Nice flavor, vegetarian, more of a stew really. My partner enjoyed the burger, but commented that it was a tad bit too spicy for him, and he loves hot Indian food. Overall a nice alternative to fast food and decent service."}
{"text":"I love the food. I was in one evening and it was hectic and busy. My table was overlooked and when the waiter realized what happened, he couldn't have been more attentive and nice. Everyone makes mistakes--especially when it is crazy busy. For me, it's how they make up for it and that they at least make the effort. I appreciate that."}
{"text":"I love this place. Our server was kind, quick, and friendly. Helpful with questions and made sure we were happy but not annoying. The food is without a doubt delicious. I am a vegetarian and you have options after options here of all flavorful delicious food. My boyfriend and son get the pita wraps and love them. My boyfriend has to stay gluten free and there are many options for him to eat as well as dessert! That never happens. We will be back per the usual we had a great night here at pita..."}
{"text":"I just love pita jungle.  It's one of those places you can count on.  The atmosphere is cool, the food is good (and everyone can find something they can eat - vegetarian, etc.), and they have really good green tea arnold palmers :)  I try to order something new every time I go to Pita Jungle, you can never go wrong with any of their items.  The falafel, the lentil and rice salad (i forget the name), the hot chicken pita, the fruit salad, the black bean burger...they're all so good!  Oh! And make sure to order the red pepper hummus as a starter with sliced cucumbers for dipping, along with the pita bread.  The forever changing art on the walls from different local artists adds character along with the tattooed staff (love it!).  The only thing I can think to change is the quality of the outdoor seating and the crappy strip mall location, but I guess that makes it a literal diamond in the rough!  See you soon pita jungle ;)"}
{"text":"Eh sadly disappointed in this location, we just moved from the Gilbert area as this is one of my favorite places to eat I was excited to order it today. My wife and I decided to go with Pita Jungle today for lunch, and when we received our food we were very disappointed in the quality of the food. Ranging from undercooked veggies in our Philly pita to missing food items, we now know that quality is based on location and it's not vertically integrated."}
{"text":"We enjoy both this Pita Jungle and the Pita Jungle near Arrowhead.  They almost always have a craft beer or two that I want to try, and we are big fans of the cilantro hummus. My daughter loves the fruit plate and it always comes with a whole produce section worth of fresh fruit. (I am not sure how they predict the demand for this as it is always fresh, but all the better). I am a fan of the chicken chipotle lavash pizza, though it is enough food for two. With three of us, we leave stuffed from the hummus, the lavash pizza, and stealing fruit from our daughter's plate. Even then we take food home.  I enjoy the setting of this Pita Jungle and the rotating art work is fun."}
{"text":"I love this place for nostalgia's sake. I always seem to end up disappointed by the time I walk out.   My last two visits have been for brunch, perhaps that was my downfall. They really do not do brunch well.  First off, when someone asks for egg whites, \"we have tofu\" is not an answer. If you are using eggs, egg whites are part of them. If you claim to not have them, it makes me wonder if you are using some sort of egg premix that cannot be separated.  Furthermore, there is no sausage or bacon on the menu. I can totally wrap my head around there being little meat on the menu, and that there is a possibility of a religious exclusion of pork. Whatever, welcome to the 21st century! Chicken sausages are awesome! Turkey bacon and other fowl meats work beautifully!   I like some meat with breakfast, grilled chicken just doesn't cut it (to be fair, I haven't had the grilled chicken, doesn't sound appetizing).  Get the damn protesters off your street too! They suck ass!"}
{"text":"I drive all the way to this specific pita jungle (40 min) because of their option to build your own bowl! For $8 I can get pasta, grilled chicken, red pepper hummus, bean medley, cheese and more! I tried to order a something similar at a regular pita jungle and it came out to ~16 with the add-ins. Hefty amount of food at a quality price!"}
{"text":"This is by far the best restaurant in the Desert Ridge area for healthy eaters (or really anyone who can tolerate a meal not consisting of red meat smothered in cheese). The atmosphere, music and food are all hip, casual and fun. Prices are slightly below average for a restaurant in this class."}
{"text":"Great food, fun decor, sub-par service.  Each time we come out to AZ, we stop here. They have a medium sized menu, but have something for everyone...burgers, sandwiches, salads, and other entrees.  I had the hummus bowl with seasoned grilled chicken and pita. I chose the roasted red pepper hummus, but the cilantro jalape√±o hummus is also top-notch (if you like cilantro). My husband tried the Philly cheesesteak pita, which was also good and had a ton of complex flavor.  We went pretty close to closing, around 8pm. I'm assuming they had started to cut down on staff, because it took us several minutes to get menus, and near the end of the meal, we had to go up and pay ourselves because our waitress was too busy.   Overall, a fun place for a quick, yummy bite to eat, but it would be nice if they worked on their staffing."}
{"text":"This is the best Pita Jungle I've been to in the Valley. These places can attract some insufferable hipsters, service staff and customers both. This one is much more laidback and pleasant."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a great restaurant/bar to watch a game, grab a drink and eat something healthy, look no further.  This Greek influenced menu is infested with not only healthy options, but very tasty options for everyone in your family or dining party.  You can't go wrong with the Cilantro Jalape√±o Hummus, Jerk Chicken Wrap or Gyro...  Great atmosphere, ambiance, bar, service and food."}
{"text":"A great, new and healthy place to grab tasty pita wraps, hummus or wood stove pizza.  Overall (1-5):  5* Food (1-5):  5* Service (1-5):  5* Atmosphere (1-5):  4* Ambiance (1-5):  4*"}
{"text":"I love Pita Jungle and I am so happy there is one near me. It is pretty packed most nights and especially weekends. It is a great place for a fresh dinner that's not fried in grease!  The service is sometimes great, sometimes average. Last time our waitress showed us the wine specials, then suggested one of the only wines that wasn't on special. We didn't notice until we got our bill, it wasn't a huge price difference but felt kind of shady of her to not mention it."}
{"text":"I am absolutely in love with this place. The menu is diverse and I can't wait to try more of it. I have been back about 5 times since I first ventured in a few months ago. I love the chicken shawarma pita, the hummus topped with chicken, and the tzatziki. The only thing I did not care for was their dolmades. The prices here are fantastic for the amount of food you get. I almost always have leftovers. I really love the atmosphere too, with the constantly changing wall art and live music. I love taking out of town guests here for a relatively healthy meal. Love sitting on the patio too when it's nice out. Definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"I've written reviews for various other Pita Jungle locations and my opinion of this one mostly echoes those that came before it. Good food, big portions, good prices. I finally got around to checking out this location and it has now replaced the Apache location as my PJ of choice. I like the setup here, and the staff is a bit more friendly and laid back. One thing that people don't talk about much is PJ's happy hour, which has awful hours, but is a total STEAL. Check out my pics for some examples from the small plates / tapas menu.  Happy Hour goes from 3pm-5:30pm during the week (perfect excuse to ditch work early!) and then Reverse Happy Hour is every night from 9-10pm. Everything is $3 and under. The hummus trio for only a buck is a sure bet. It's a good amount for the price. All the other dips are $1 too, including baba ganoosh, tzatziki, and garlic dip. You get a half a pita bread with each. It's not really enough pita for the amount of dip, but I never miss it since I am busy devouring the other items like the falafel. For $2 you get 2 good sized falafel and if you are like me you can scoop up the rest of your hummus with the falafel pieces for some hardcore chickpea on chickpea action.  The scallops ($3 for 2) are another winner for me. Served in a creamy  curry sauce, I could easily down 2 or 3 orders of them alone. Other seafood selections include shrimp and mussels. The sole meat choice on the menu is the Garlic Lemon Chicken with pine nuts. It's not my favorite. The portion is small and I find it overseasoned, though they are generous with the pine nuts.  One minor disappointment for me is the lack of vegetable dishes on the tapas menu. There is the mozzarella with tomato, but it's only one slice of each. Then the mushrooms which of course are not really a veggie. I'd like to see maybe a roasted peppers & eggplant dish, or something along those lines.  Beers are $2-$3 a bottle during happy hour, and house cabernet or chardonnay will run you $3 a glass. So bring a group and get one of everything on the tapas menu, it will only run you $25! Then drink, and be merry :)"}
{"text":"Yelp is telling me to review this location because I checked in here recently. Very weird because I thought I wrote one long, long ago since PJ is my favorite place for light, healthy (sometimes) food. I've been to pretty much all PJ locations but this is my most visited since it's in my hood. I regularly get take out and frequently dine in. My favorites are the broiled chicken salad, shawarma pita, falafel pita, glazed chicken lavosh pizza, all of the hummus but especially the cilantro jalapeno, tzatziki and pita chips, fruit and cheese \"fantasia\", and probably more I can't remember at the moment. Happy hour rocks, the prices are great for the portion sizes. I love that they now have most of their nutrition information on their web site (you might not want to look....some of it is scary!)"}
{"text":"After driving in from Fullerton, California to see the Doyers...what a delightful and delicious lunch we found at the Pita Jungle.  Quality food and service, even birds chirping while i enjoyed my delicious Gyro. Modestly priced and all the ambiance you could mustard up on a sidewalk cafe in a strip mall. I highly recommend it and only wished I had room for dessert!"}
{"text":"This is the closest Pita Jungle to my office. I love the food and often call ahead and just pick up because this parking lot is a damn nightmare during the lunch rush. If you are dining in though, things do move very quickly. I appreciate the staff at this location not being the usual apathetic hipster PJ is known for. The manager guy here, don't know his name, really knows what he is doing. My favorite to-go dish is the chicken shwarma wrap. It has PICKLES like all wraps with chicken should :)  I also love the glazed chicken pizza...omg caramelized onion-y goodness with chunky feta, how can you go wrong. And it's huge so you get two meals. Other faves: hummus with chicken, black bean burger, cilantro jalapeno hummus with pita chips, tzatziki, broiled chicken salad for when I want something really light."}
{"text":"If you truly care about your taste buds, you will not think twice about ordering the Mediterranean Chicken Salad.  The medley of flavors and textures is awesome!  I'm vegetarian so I order it with tofu instead of chicken and it rocks my world!"}
{"text":"Deceive your diet! Indulge in any of the appetizers and entrees knowing your feeding your body with something that's not only nutritious but tastes delicious! Sure bets are the Caprese salad, Chicken Shawarma, and Pesto Lavosh Turkey Wrap. Prices are under $15 and portions are generous."}
{"text":"Soooo excited to have a Pita Jungle closer to me!!!   The new location is beyond beautiful! Love it! Same great food and services as the other locations"}
{"text":"I am sooooo glad there is now a PJ much closer to my work! It is all of 7 minutes away.   I had a reallllllllllly bad craving for some Jalapeno Cilantro Hummus so I called in an order to go and added a side order of lentils and rice.   My total bill was $11. That's why its only get 4 stars. The prices seem to keep going up as each new location opens.   Though, for that $11 I got a large order of the most tastiest hummus ever. AND the side order of lentils and rice is so ridiculously large that I have been eating it for 3 days now. I was expecting a cup sized amount, instead it looks to have been at least 4-5 cups worth!   I've gone in to dine here a few times as well and haven't had any issues. Keep it up PJ!"}
{"text":"Glad to finally go to a PJ where all the girls are actually CLOTHED! I love me some PJ but always hate going in and having to be subjected to the waitresses in barely there clothing, the girls here are tastefully dressed.   This is for sure the most upscale looking of all the PJ's.   The food was all just as good as it is at the other locations. My only complaint is that I ordered the nachos and they gave me a HUGE portion of chips and almost no cheese or other toppings. Usually the nachos are smothered in toppings so this was disappointing.   I will go back here againl"}
{"text":"Went to meet up with some family on the East side of town this weekend. I told them I had some diet restrictions and they suggested Pita Jungle, which I was stoked on as I love me some PJ! I didn't know they had expanded that far east!   It was a Friday night and the place was hopping! We were seated pretty quickly and our waiter was on point all night!   The food came out a tad slow, but it was all great and everyone enjoyed their meals."}
{"text":"Pita Jungle can do NO WRONG in my eyes!   The food has always been amazing! I have been going here for 10 years or so and have never left displeased.  Also they are a home spun local business, which always makes me happy!   Yes, they do have hipper then thou hipster working there, but those hipsters can sure make a mean hummus!   I have many favorites which is starting to make it hard when I go there, because I want them all! Pita Jungles portions are always so generous that I have never even finished what I ordered.   My new fav is the Lentil Fetoosh Salad, the mix of the lentils and rice with the caramelized onions over the fresh mixed greens with that lemon vinaigrette is WHOA! Its incredibly filling, split it with 2 or 4 friends, seriously!   Another fav is off the starters section, but its so much food that I never finish! The lavosh pita crisp! Its like a fancy spicy supped up cheese crisp!   Thank You Pita Jungle for bringing bomb diggity food to the valley!"}
{"text":"Well I was thinking to myself last night that I would be giving this location a 3.   HOWEVER, that just went down the drain. Last night the hubs and I ate dinner here. I am currently on this strict vegan diet, so I asked the waiter if the black bean burger was vegan. He said he wasn't sure but that he would check. A minute later he comes back and says yes it is. SCORE! I eat half of it and boxed up the rest for lunch, which I will no longer be able to eat BECAUSE THE DAMN BURGER IS NOT VEGAN! I went on PJ's website this morning to find out calories and what not, because I track that stuff, they had a whole section listing what is vegan and what is not,and sure as shit, the black bean burger was listed on their site as NOT being vegan...why the staff doesn't have access to this info I do not know.   So anyway.....Our actual experience was ok. This time around all the employees were actually dressed and no goods were hanging out. Our waiter sucked. He never checked on us once the food came, never came to give us refills, our plates were cleared away by someone else, a box was brought to me by someone else, we had our credit card sitting on the table for a good ten minutes waiting for the bill. They did get a wee bit busy, but they seriously had about 6 people working that night for that very small location.   I'm not sure what is up with this location. It has always been like pulling teeth to get decent service there. The food is always good but the service is lacking."}
{"text":"This is Pita Jungle's first day open at the new Ahwatukee location. I stopped by for takeout, and despite the fact that this place was brand-new, service was great and the Lavosh Shawarma Wrap was wonderful! Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Thousand bean pita-  I was reluctant to try this place but my boss had a meeting nearby and I was starving so I thought what the heck, let's do it. I showed up on a wed at 3, service was quick, waiter johnathan was very pleasant and kind.   The pita-  It was pretty good. Nothing too spectacular about it but if you're hungry, not in the mood for meat but want something filling, this is the way to go. Be a bean/rice lover & this will be your jam!"}
{"text":"I used to love, love, love Pita Jungle. I went to ASU and it got me through college. After college, its the place I could eat a nice meal when on a diet. I always liked the food and casual friendly atmosphere.   My last visit there left me feeling decidedly \"meh\". The service was so casual that we barely saw our waitress once after ordering: to bring the bill. There were 3 of us - we ordered 3 apps and 3 dinners.  Dinner was \"fine\", though I remember it tasting \"fresher\" but what'ev. I wasn't expecting 5-star anything. It was a casual dinner with friends.   Also, you should know that if you want extra pitas with your apps, you can expect them to arrive with the bill.   So, if you go: be patient and order extra pitas when you order your iced tea."}
{"text":"I am so completely blown away at the lack of quality at this location!  I have eaten at and loved Pita Jungle for over 15 years.  I understand this is the mall but they didn't even bother to warm up the pitas.  It was such a disappointment because I have never been let down by their food.  Lesson learned.  I would recommend to not come to this location if you are a fan."}
{"text":"Food is very tasty and plentiful. High noise level. Seems to be always busy.  The owners should spend some of their profits and replace the tables which are showing their age with lots of chips and wear. Just my opinion."}
{"text":"I usually don't write reviews, especially negative reviews but I had a negative experience this afternoon, I ordered a curry salad with tofu but they ran out of my beloved tofu and they told me this after I had paid, so I got he pasta salad with mozzarella. The salad was fine, but after waiting there for a while I ordered an iced tea they said they were going to comp the order but when the manager came he cancelled the first order and charged me for literally everything and didn't even take care of of me AT ALL and the counter girl said sorry but I didn't even get what I wanted and I had to pay for all of it. I used to be a restaurant manager and I would have done what I can to get this person to come back, I'm not sure if I'm going to come back."}
{"text":"Great food with lots of healthy options. Good portion sizes and decently priced. The spicy chicken pita is chock full of vegetables. The service was very friendly but the food took a little while to arrive, albeit was extremely fresh and hot off the grill when it did!"}
{"text":"This is a pretty good place to go eat. It's very convenient because it's basically across the street from where I live. They have a good happy hour menu both early and late so that makes for good snacking. The amount of food you get for the money provides value so I'll leave here. That is a very big sticking point for me. One of the reasons I did not get five stars is because it is very loud in there and I honestly think some sound panels would work."}
{"text":"This place is SO good!!! I would hardly even call myself a huge fan of Greek/Mediterranean food, but the food here was delicious. I ordered a wrap that came with a fairly large Greek salad on the side. The portions were large and the food was delicious. In addition, we were very happy with the service that we received while dining here. I would definitely come back and recommend to others!"}
{"text":"Best Beef Gyro I've ever had. The entire staff are very friendly and attentive. This is by far my favorite place. Even when my mom comes into town from Texas she always askes me to take her to lunch here. The prices are very reasonable; and the portions are appropriate.  Everything is made fresh. I also love love love the salmon dish and sautee spinach."}
{"text":"A great place for a vegetarian/vegan or anyone open-minded about trying new foods. There are some options for meat eaters. The service has always been fast."}
{"text":"Pita Jungle used to be my favorite place to eat until they started changing the menu and serving less portions ... Wish they would go back to how they use to be."}
{"text":"Most over-rated restaurant ever. I have gone their twice- both times the service was AWFUL and food inedible. We called a day ahead and told them a party of 14 were coming. They told us they usually don't take reservations but they would set something up for us and they are very slow around lunch so no problem. We arrived and the hostess was rude and had no idea we were coming. There wasn't anyone there so they set up a table for us. We asked if we could have our checks split and the rude waitress said absolutely not. I have worked in restaurants for many years and if someone is paying for a service and asks ahead of time for split checks I think it is awful to say no way. We will never return there as a group and we do group lunches often at my job. We waited an HOUR (63 minutes to be exact) for our food to hit the table after we ordered. The waitress was terrible- I never got a refill and arte my lunch thirsty. She added 18% grat to our check and made us figure out how to split it. The first time I went there I said I would NEVER return and I gave them one more shot because people claim its amazing and now I am sure I will never go back."}
{"text":"Love the pita jungle!!!  My fave is the chicken and hummus appetizer.  Definitely enough for a meal and super cheap too.  Also love the chicken swarma sandwich and the chicken pizza.  You can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"Always love the food at pita jungle.  All the staff is awesome too and pretty much know us by name now."}
{"text":"Ok, here it is my updated review of this Pita Jungle. I love this place. Other than their rocky start they have done a great job. The food here is great, service is great and I never have to wait too long for my order.   I have been to this location so many times I think they are getting sick of me. Ha, I love this place, the spicy chicken wrap, the Philly chicken pita are awesome and addicting.   I love that they take the time to learn my name since they see me so often and make conversation and make sure I always am taken care of. Great service and food!"}
{"text":"On a recent visit to the area my work team suggested Pita Jungle for lunch!  When we arrived I was pleased to see a very cool restaurant that was very large. The decoration is very Hippy Sheek! The waiter got our drinks and took our orders quickly. The hummus assortment appetizer was amazing! It comes with chunks of Ahi Tuna that I was a big fan of! I ordered the Ahi Tuna salad for lunch as well. First it was beautiful, colorful topped with huge chunks of mango, strawberries and other fruits. Second it tasted great and had a lot of tuna on top! It was just what I needed to get some veggies and protein in my day in a very tasty fashion! I would definitely return to Pita Jungle on future visits to Tempe. the staff was great! Very attentive with out being over bearing and the prices are fair!"}
{"text":"Since I am a vegetarian, Pita Jungle is a great restaurant for me! While I can get vegetarian plates at other restaurants, usually my options are pretty limited. Here, I have tons of options. All of the Pita Jungles are kind of funky with cool art and paintings on the walls which makes it cute. Their jalapeno cilantro hummus is one of my favorite things ever! Even to split though, the small is more than enough. Portions here in general are pretty huge. I've never ordered anything from here I didn't like. They also have really good red sangria that tastes cinnamony. My favorite things are the black bean burger and the spicy chicken wrap (I sub the chicken for tofu). I would suggest splitting something with whoever you are with, but if you don't you will have another meal! Healthy, vegetarian friendly, good atmosphere, and reasonably priced. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"My friend and I decided to stop by and get something to eat after we got done shopping. I usually eat at the actual resturant instead of inside the mall. I ordered the garlic dip and a side of seasoned chicken, my friend ordered the chicken del sol. All these are my favorites everytime I dine at Pita. I don't know if its just because its located in the mall and they don't have everything that the actual menu does at the resturant. The seasoned chicken had way too much seasoning on it. The chicken del sol looked different and tasted way different, they did not put the chipotle sauce on the cheese pita."}
{"text":"Chicken del sol is delicious and chicken pasta salad are my favorite!"}
{"text":"Very good food, nice atmosphere, AMAZING hummus.  Very nice lake-side dining.  The one time I did sit outside,the service could have been better.  They were kind of busy that evening though.  Would recommend and will go back in the future."}
{"text":"Pita Jungle is a restaurant that offers a variety of food options. The food is quite good. I tried their house red wine and it wasn't bad. Has a smooth taste. Our server Katie provided excellent customer service. The atmosphere is laid back. The staff members work quite hard! Keep up the hard work!"}
{"text":"There is nothing I would change about this location. The staff tends to lean to the younger set, but don't let that scare you. The attention to the customer, service, respect and courtesy is #1. Our server, Kyle was attentive without hovering, enjoyable to speak with and very good at knowing the menu and making suggestions. Having three different flavored teas to choose from was a bonus. The hummus selection is fantastic. Any special request are met with a smile and the food is consistently good. I ordered the Mediterranean Chicken and substituted gyro meat. It is absolutely my go-to favorite salad in the entire world and it's enough for two meals. Everything is fresh and healthy.  In the mood for tapas and beer? My BFF and I have consistently had a great time, super service and great food and drink at the bar. Nothing bad about this place whether it's a casual date, bar by yourself to watch a game or drinks with a friend."}
{"text":"This restaurant is fun to go to if you want some healthy alternatives or some Mediterranean Food. I had the spinach mozzarella quesadilla the first time there and it was tasty.  The next time I went, I had the black bean burger, which was freaking delicious, it was so filling, I didn't even notice I wasn't having meat and believe me, I love my beef.  My only issue with this restaurant is that the service staff all wear regular street clothes, so sometimes it is hard to flag down a waiter because they look like customers."}
{"text":"Four stars is a very high rating for me....Pita Jungle, one of my all time favorites. Why? First, the food is fresh, always...Second, it is wonderful Mediterranean cuisine, middle eastern, and more....Third, it is healthy and very tasty, hard to get together, finally it is casual, relaxed....No it isn't a place to take your mother on her birthday, unless she is an aging hippie, no it isn't a Las Vegas, Beverly Hills chain migrating East to Phx, and no, there is no valet parking,  it won't cost you a week's paycheck, and you don't have to buy a special outfit to go there. It is food for everyday eating...I love the hummous, baba ganosh (eggplant like hummous), shrimp appetizers, all the wraps, the fruit salad is monstrous, fresh and yummy. The fish entrees are terrific...Matter of fact,  I have never had a mediocre dish at this place. Try it, you will like it."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying I usually LOVE Pita Jungle; I go there about once  a month and usually have great service and great food.  However, on my visit yesterday, only the service was great. I ordered the Mahi Mahi with Pita Chips and this was the first time I had received something that was inedible - I actually couldn't cut through my fish because it was so overcooked the bottom had turned to a black piece of inedible char. The fish I could cut through was so overcooked it had no flavor and was bone dry. Again, this is my favorite dish and I get it all the time, however this time it was so completely beyond edible, I was immensely disappointed.   So, I feel I have to give Pita Jungle 2 stars (which is the lowest rating I've ever given) because I couldn't eat the food that was put in front of me.   Again, the service was great - our waitress was really sweet and timely with our drinks and orders."}
{"text":"Delicious, great price and attentive staff. . We had seven different types of tapas... Babaganoosh, garlic dip hummus, falafel, saut√© scallops-- all fantastic.  I also had the kafta burger from the specials menu,  delicious."}
{"text":"I'm really surprised that so many people love this place, especially when there is better middle eastern food all over this town.  First off, I didn't really know who worked here, and who didn't, and thought it was especially rude of the gangsta busboy to cut me off and flirt with our hostess while she was seating us. Classy.   The decor is uninspired, and the service was decent. Our drinks were kept full, but I felt that our plates were thrown at us.   Onto the food. We first started with the Cilantro Jalapeno Hummus, which was a pretty decent hummus, not as spicy as I would have liked. It was smooth  My wife had the Spicy Black Bean Burger, and I had the Falafel Pita.  Presentation was nothing special, the idea of putting my foil wrapped pita on a plate seemed ridiculous, it would have made better sense to put it in a basket, or just handed it to me. As for flavor, nothing was exciting, minus the pickles, which were crisp and sour. The falafel tasted like a mix, the pita was dry and incredibly flat, the tahini was non-existent, and the way my veggies were arranged showed the general lack of care/love of food in the kitchen.  The black bean burger was much better, and is what earned the 2 stars in this review. The patty was flavorful, spicy, and great. The rest of the burger was uninspired. Vegetarian food can be absolutely amazing, and the rest of burger was a miss.   She enjoyed the included blue corn chips, but I thought they were nothing special, the salsa was salty, and the potatoes were not spiced, burnt, and really had no place or reason to be included with the meal.   I certainly won't be going back, but if I could purchase just those black bean burger patties, I would."}
{"text":"I ate here with my husband about a month ago. I have eaten at Pita Jungle once before, but have avoided it for a long time. I am kind of a picky eater and nothing on the menu ever seems that appealing to me. I decided to go because my husband loves it. He told me, you have to try the chicken pasta salad. So we split it and got an extra chicken breast on the side. I didn't care for it. The sauce they put on it was too lemony-flavored. I'm glad we got the extra plain chicken breast because that was really yummy. I'm willing to come back and give it another shot. The service was good too."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a healthy (Mediterranean) meal Pita Jungle is a great option. Whether take-out or dine in, you won't be disappointed! I live and work close to this location and they know me here. I am a regular diner with them and I highly recommend Pita Jungle!"}
{"text":"Great food and service always! Manager Dave is always on point. Not sure about the new look, although it will probably grow on me."}
{"text":"What an awesome place !!! Cool atmosphere  Great service Healthy options Fast and fresh."}
{"text":"Have eaten here many times, not only at this location in Gilbert but others as well. Everything was great accept...I called in my order for pick up and Maddilyn said food will be ready in 10 minutes. I waited about 25 or so. Got there to pick up my food and it wasn't ready, on top of that there was hardly anyone in the place. Safe to say she forgot my order since I had to wait another 15 minutes?!?! At least my food was good and hott! :)"}
{"text":"I love this Pita Jungle. Sometimes there is a wait, but they are always fast. I find their food superior to the other locations. Their take-out is always ready in less than 10 minutes. They have great service. My favorite:  macro platter. The tofu is delicious!"}
{"text":"So I was starting to feel like I was the last person on the planet to try Pita Jungle and the waalaaa! One pops up conveniently in Glendale. Since the opening I have been there twice and impressed both times.   The first time I had the shwarma wrap- HUGE! I couldn't even eat half that sucker and I'm a big girl. The next time I went I had the chicken Philly pita and it was divine. The portions are huge and the hummus is delicious. We had no problems with service, everyone seemed to be on their toes.  We will definitely be going back...in fact Pita Jungle has moved into the \"craving\" category."}
{"text":"Pretty tasty, HUGE portions. Boyfriend and I split a Lavosh Pita Crisp for an app, and I had the chicken combo platter, the boy had some special with \"sun pita chips\"? or something along those lines.   We both had tons of food arrive and we both ended up taking food home (including our leftovers from the appetizer)  The wait staff was really nice, the hostess opened the door for us and sat us promptly. I would go back. :)"}
{"text":"After a horrible experience attempting to place a catering order at the downtown location, I called this location hoping to have a better experience. From the minute they answered the phone, the experience was 1000 times better! Scott took my order and was fast, friendly and reassured me that the experience I had previously had was not how they do business. When I came to pick up my order, it had never been rang through however the staff was eager to help and went out of their way to make up for the mistake. LOVE this location! Best staff and AMAZING customer service!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy the food here great service and are even really fast at making the orders when I call in for a pick up. I suggest the Firewood Chicken if you're pretty much a spinach and tomato fan like me lol and the pasta is really good as well!"}
{"text":"I have always been a fan of Pita Jungle. Their food has never let me down, especially their hot pitas! My top pick is the Mediterranean Roasted Chicken (Shawarma). You can get the roasted potatoes for an extra .99 cents. They're not bad, but not my favorite.  The staff is very hipsteresque, but extremely friendly. You always get a warm welcome when you come here. They have a lot of art on their walls that's for sale supporting local artists. This place has a great bar with some great beers on draft. Great place for a nice meal!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in the valley, ever.  This location in particular is my fave.  Years ago I'd go there when I was taking classes at MCC.. I came so often that a waitress remembered my order when I went back recently.  It's very laid back, but I think one thing that separates this location from the others is that the servers are super nice and chill, not hipster and weird.  Sorry.. I just felt so judged when I went to other places haha.  :)    Food-wise.. the hummus is a MUST.  I can't decide if I like the cilantro/jalapeno or the roasted bell pepper better.  When in doubt, they will give you both.  I always order the chicken pasta salad for my meal, which is huge and can be split into two meals.  It's pretty basic, pasta with grilled chicken and a super delish lemon vinaigrette.  They have great green tea too!  Definitely a great place to visit.. especially if you're looking to avoid a super heavy, fattening meal.  It's hard to leave this place and feel guilty."}
{"text":"Loved the hummus. And who would have thought hummus and beer wre such good friends? Happy hour with hummus. Great attention at the bar, good drinks. They have different flavors hummus, that's when it gets tricky. I have tried several and they are all good. My friend goes on and on about their chicken wrap thing. I went for the gyro."}
{"text":"Never been here before, though I had been invited. Everything was good. Got this crazy mixed gyro meat wrap that was pretty dang good. If you screw up your mix of items that's your bad. My friend got the swarma wrap and I liked that too. Look at the pics, order carefully. Then enjoy."}
{"text":"Pros: Healthy options, yummy hummus, great tea selections and sriracha sauce (ok, not unique to Pita Jungle, but they will bring you the whole bottle if you ask for some). I usually get the mahi mahi, which is very good, but I haven't ever had anything here that I didn't like.  Cons: Or really just \"con\" is the service. Like other yelpers have said, there is something off about the service. The servers are usually fast and attentive, but I don't think I have ever had one actually smile at me. It's not that they are unfriendly, I guess unaffected would be the word to describe their demeanor. Pretty sure the place could catch on fire and the servers would just shrug.    Overall, the food is tasty and the service is good enough for me to keep going back."}
{"text":"I come here often. It is a bit commercialized, they churn out the same several decent entrees, but they are all pretty good. I am a fan of the gyro, but I wish they would not put sweet pickles on them. (Listen chefs). Tpoo may pickles throw off the flavors and really don't belong on there. Tried the cheese steak, the Masala. All tasty. Nice, quick lunch option for ASU people. Hummus is yummy, too. Plus they have a full bar. Yay!!"}
{"text":"Came here at 9:30 and got the nastiest look by the hostess. She quickly hurried me to place a to-go order without offering us a menu. Soon as I got the menu, she told me the kitchen was closing and I had to make an immediate decision. This would be cool if there was no one else there and they were really closing, but there were at least 7 other tables waiting for their food. Needless to say, this place is filled with jerks."}
{"text":"recently had a late night dinner after a movie at Pita Jungle with a friend.   i must say the food was good as always but the service was beyond expectation.  Our Server Stephen was professional, courteous, friendly, quick, reactive, and personable.  He truly raised the experience quit a bit.  I recommended my friends go check it out and they had the same experience.   Great job Stephen, thank you for making a nice dinner, memorable and fun."}
{"text":"The best time to go to this Pita Jungle is happy hour (3-6).  Their happy hour menu was larger than I have seen at other locations.  A small plate of three different hummus? $1.  Two falafel balls?  $1.  Garlic chicken? $2.  Streamed mussels? $2.  Plus tons of other options...you could easily eat an entire meal there for just a couple of bucks.  The service was fine when we went - not even the slightest delay - but it was also in between meal times and not crowded.  However, the strip mall itself was packed.  It is always packed.  The parking lot stresses me out.  So, go at your own risk, and don't bother trying to park close."}
{"text":"The husband and I went to Pita Jungle last night at approximately 6:30. I was very hungry, perhaps on the verge of hangry (a dramatic form of hunger) and so we promptly ordered an appetizer ( large hummus trio, to be specific). In my amazement, the large platter was set before me only seconds after I ordered. It was like magic. It was brilliant. It was faster than any fast food service I have ever received. The platter was visually appealing with a green hummus (cilantro), a red hummus (red pepper) and yellow (normal hummus).  I also ordered steam vegetables - partly to be healthy, and also partly for additional dipping options. I've never been to a place the supplied a good pita bread to hummus ratio - you always need an extra pita.  But, the carrots especially made a good hummus-to-mouth shoveling vehicle.   That is the only problem I have with Pita Jungle though, I always have to order an appetizer in order to get full. And, it's not that the serving sizes are too small because the serving plates are large and completely utilized. So, I don't know, it's like how my kitchen spoons always go missing - I don't have an explanation. It's not like they ever leave the house.  Giving 5 stars for such a good service.  I've been eating at Pita Jungle for years and the food is always good, although I would probably give 4 stars if just on taste alone. But service in seconds? It's hard to beat that.  Friendly staff, outdoor seating, and wine help seal the deal."}
{"text":"I've been eating here for years and never had a bad meal, that being said you should go. Its excellent food and hands down the best in chandler."}
{"text":"I stopped at Pita Jungle after I left my heart doctors office and he said you have to eat better your cholesterol is high. So I drove over to Pita Jungle because fuck it one last philly steak and cheese isn't going to kill me. The food there is excellent and the people god-damn rock whom work there. They are always nice and tell me what is good and what has changed or been added to the menu. The pita jungle garlic dip is the thing of dreams and my body loves it."}
{"text":"These new salads and craft bowls are amazing. Tried three so far and love each one! I've been a customer since the 90s on Apache in Tempe, what progress and attention to health and flavor!! Yummmy!"}
{"text":"I like this place, good location, good service, they had a yummy seasonal shake-pumpkin spice I think- it was amazing! Just a great place to go and in the summer I love eating on the patio."}
{"text":"How can I tell I am enjoying myself? When an avid carnivore such as myself comes out happy after  picking on the  beans and vegetables on this planet.   The portions , for such a thin clientele, are large.  Someone mentioned the attractiveness of the staff and that would be a fair statement. ( Then again anyone with purple anything and Flogging Molly shirt had me at hello to begin with:)    Quick service, drinks filled quickly.   I had the black bean burger   with roasted red bell pepper, mixed greens, tomatoes, cucumbers and onions on a 12-grain bread, served with blue corn chips, pico de gallo and garlic new potatoes.    Really good bread, didn't get soggy or fall to bits prior to finishing it off and the price was  close to  what you end up paying subway for their \" high end\" sandwiches   The appetizer  isn't really rated since  dolmas  have such a wide range of  ingredients , like pakora,  you often don't know what you're going to get. It's not that these are bad, they just have  a consistency that's  too close to a couple of foods I really hate.   The tsatziki and pita though I can happily recommend  as being really good for the former and good enough on the latter.   Decor,  great apart from the ceiling which would appear to be the surplus left over from the diners.  It's just odd to have such a well put together floor and sides , add in a great big mirror above a waiting area with fireplace and then reflect this gaudy embossed carbunkle back at us as if we hadn't had enough:). ( didnt' affect rating but I'm convinced it's not helping the relative noise level of the place at  lunch time)"}
{"text":"There is a level of rudeness that we encountered here at Friday lunchtime that takes the biscuit, cake and pita bread.   I was with a party from work which had checked in with  No idea what was going through her mind but to openly question if your Q Jumping, go back in to check, then have  my friend go back in to show his licence  just for the privilege of buying   lunch  here? Hey Soup Nazi was a  fictional character not a training video!   Hard to enjoy food after such BS.  That being said the server was great, the food came out fast. The food was as good as the Pita Jungle I frequent in Arrowhead  ( with the nice staff :P )  and would easily have made it to 3.5 or 4 stars."}
{"text":"holy crap.  try the side order of garlic mushrooms.  they are little pieces of heaven that are such a delight to pop in your mouth.  also, on the special menu right now there's a salad called the mediteranian chicken salad, which really truly may be the most incredible salad i've ever eaten in my life.  i wish i could drink the dressing that topped the impressive mix of greens, corn, roasted red peppers, cilantro, raisins, pine nuts, red onions, parsley, well-seasoned chicken, and i can't remember the rest.  omg.  beautiful.  service was fine, not exceptional, but the staff was friendly enough. i'm so HAPPY i found this place.  go there."}
{"text":"Food is always good (love the Philly).  Happy hour is 3-6 daily (despite what the website says!) and they have a bunch of tapas for a couple of bucks during that time."}
{"text":"Story of a Wood Fired Chicken  Once upon a warm, sunny March day, two ravenous monkeys entered the Jungle of Pita. The two monkeys were under the impression that this jungle only offered pita dishes, a notion that quickly proved to be a myth as each monkey ordered a wrap of sorts. As the two monkeys chowed down on their mediocre wraps, each caught a glimpse of a most uplifting . . . chicken. Yes, a chicken. A wonderfully massive Wood Fired Chicken, mounted upon a bed of mashed potatoes, floating by to another monkey's tree. Mouths sputtering water, the monkeys finished their meal and agreed to help themselves to this chicken next time.  Once upon another warm, sunny March day, the same two ravenous monkeys entered the Jungle of Pita and each ordered a fine-looking Wood Fired Chicken. Anticipation knocked on their trees as they waited. Finally, the chicken arrived. The monkeys ravaged each bite of their outstanding meal, which contained a blend of seasoned spinach, mashed potatoes, and juicy chicken - all soaked in a citrusy tomato sauce. Oh glorious day, that day they reveled in the glorious Wood Fired Chicken. Even though the portion was huge, each monkey licked their plate clean and swore they would return again for the Wood Fired Chicken, because that's where it's at in the Jungle of Pita."}
{"text":"The food at Pita Jungle is usually as good as food gets, but this location fell a little short. In all fairness, they were pretty busy with a Friday late lunch crowd. The waiter took our order pretty quickly, but we were almost done with the hummus (which is my favorite!) appetizer before he ever came with our drinks. We had to ask him again to bring them.  I ordered the Greek salad with chicken and short of being overloaded with dressing, it was good. I will get the dressing on the side next time. My friends ordered the mahi mahi  on hummus and the chicken wrap. There was plenty of food, which they enjoyed with enough leftover to take home. Even with very slow service, I would try this location again, because like I said, this is really good food."}
{"text":"The service at Pita Jungle was quick and very helpful.  This was my first time at a Pita Jungle and I was thrilled to see that it was so healthy.  This was also the closest that I have gotten to the authentic Arabic food that I knew and loved when I leaved in Dearborn, Michigan.  I had the chicken shawarma and gobbled it down. Yummy!  The best part about Pita Jungle??  The kids' menu!  WOW!  This is the healthiest menu that I have seen since I have started nannying.  Everywhere else seems to only have pizza, corn dogs, and macaroni.  Thank you Pita Jungle for teaching great habits with using the MyPlate model and having very healthy choices for each portion."}
{"text":"Fawk I wish I was in AZ at this moment. Pita is sooooo good! I enjoyed there Humans, they have several variations and all are good. This is a kick ass place to grab a great salad as well. Overall I enjoyed it to the max."}
{"text":"Amazing, start to finish! We were greeted by the friendliest hostess and seated immediately. Our server was incredibly quick, yet never made us feel rushed. We got there early enough for happy hour and enjoyed a drink and a couple of delicious appetizers (garlic chicken with lemon, tabouli, and the hummus trio - so good!).   Our entrees were top notch. Chicken shawarma, lentil salad, and chicken pasta salad - all fresh and delicious.   We're only here for a weekend, but we'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"DISGUSTING FOOD! I'm not one to complain that often, I like to find the good in things. But let me tell you, there's nothing good about Pita Jungle. Everything here is like bird food. Small portions and the most random things put together. Bread and beans? Like what? And it's not even good! You can't pay me to eat here ever again"}
{"text":"I LOVE pita jungle! I don't care what any ones says about it being fake middle eastern food. They have created an amazing menu with a great twist. I have had pretty much everything on the menu but I always seem to go back for pesto flat bread, trio hummus with chicken and the mediterranean salad. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Healthy. Delicious. Semi-non-chain-like. ;-)  I came here with a friend from SF tonight, after seeing another friend (Gene X.'s) stellar review of this place.   At first I was a bit reluctant since it was in a strip mall, but after learning that \"everything in Phoenix is in a strip mall\" from my local friend, I settled in fine. We shared the cilantro jalapeno hummus and each got the Ahi Sesame something salad with pineapple, mangoes & strawberries in it - very yummy. I definitely liked this place, and it was a refreshing find for Phoenix - a city full of chain restaurants and strip malls, but with a few gems such as this one. :)"}
{"text":"I am a HUGE Pita Jungle fan and was patiently (or impatiently if you ask my husband) waiting for this location to open. Lucky for me, it's super convenient. It is across the street from my work and since I live less than 10 minutes away from work, it's really close to my home as well. That is a huge plus in my book since I can go for lunch or dinner.   When it opened, my husband and I went for happy hour. (Happy Hour is between 3-6pm and then a reverse happy hour from 9pm-till close.) When we arrived, the place was packed. Tons of folks waiting at the Hostess station, which is also the To-Go station (since then, the layout has changed slightly so that the hostess is further back as to not crowd the entrance). We put our name on a waiting list and while there was some confusion around who was there first and who was or wasn't on the list, we were seated within 15 minutes. We sat at a bar style table, directly next to the kitchen (we could watch them prep food) and across from the bar. Our waiter was the actual bartender, so he was really busy running back and forth from our table to the bar. This delayed our food and drinks. However, the happy hour pricing is great and I would highly recommend it. The food is also delicious and compared to the other Pita Jungle's around, it tastes the same.   Since our first encounter, we have been back three more times. Of these three times, two experiences have been relatively good (really nice waitresses, food/drinks arrived quickly, etc) but one of the experiences was soured with extremely slow service. (Folks seated after us received their drinks/entrees before us. No apologies or real comment on the matter from the wait staff. Must have been an off night?)  Overall, I love the food and happy hour. The service is hit or miss. I know they are relatively new, but the location has been open almost 3 months now and I hope they get it together."}
{"text":"Service is shaky but the food is always great! It's hard to find a restaraunt that takes nutrition into consideration when creating a menu and Pita Jungle does just that."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating at a pita jungle. The food was good but the server thought very highly of herself. We ordered 2 rounds of drinks along with hummus, side of cucumbers, and some kind of hot dish. We were one cucumber slice away from finishing everything and my girl noticed a hair.   We brought it to the waitresses attention. In short management offered to comp one round of drinks and the side of cucumbers . I thought it was a joke. I didn't have the energy to teach management how to treat customers that experienced a dirty dining experience. Rude wait staff, a manger without logic, and a hair in my food. I won't recommend or be returning."}
{"text":"Love Pita Jungle but hate how restrictive the bowl ingredients are at this location. Charge more and make it unlimited. And, it's super slow when busy. To clarify, just charge one price (with exceptions if necessary) and be able to put whatever you want in your Bowl."}
{"text":"I eat here everyday I love pita jungle so much, I like this one a lot because of the atmosphere, it's really open and super artsy! The staff is always great and portions really nice here!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch today and we (myself and a co-worker) were seated promptly in the very back corner. It took about 10 minutes for us to received any type of service. By that point we had already decided what we were going to eat as well as drink. There were 3 other tables seated after us, all of which received their food before ours. We ordered a gyro and spanakopita, and 2 waters. our waitress finally came back to us and said that they burned the spanakopita therefore they had to remake it. She then came back a second time and said that there were onions and tomatoes in my gyro (which I had asked to please leave off due to an allergy), so they had to remake that. We FINALLY received our meals and my gyro meat was burned. It was burned so badly that it just shattered into crumbles when I was trying to pick those parts off. I was sadly disappointed but didn't have the time to send it back. So I ate what I could.   Needless to say, it's not our waitress' fault but I couldn't eat half my gyro because I couldn't chew it and the time to get everything was terrible. I won't be heading back to this Pita Jungle though for lunch - no sense of urgency nor a sense of how to cook gyro meat."}
{"text":"This is the wife and I's favorite date spot for a quick, healthy, and enjoyable meal at a good price point. My favorite dish here is the spicy chicken pita and I can't seem to get away from it because It's SOOO Good. My wife usually gets the chicken schwarma or the beef gyro and they both are also very good ( snuck some bites). The service has always been top notch and the orders have always been spot on. While sometimes we have to wait 15 minutes to grab a seat the food has always been worth the wait. The bathrooms are clean for the most part and the decor fits my style. The only downside is the parking situation because there are not a ton of spots.   One last tip - The green tea is unique and awesome"}
{"text":"I was excited to check out pita Jungle. How ever I wasn't that big of a fan. Overpriced for not that great of food. A side of chips and hummus was over $5. The service took way to long. We put in our order and then 30 min later they came back and told me they were out of the black bean burger that I ordered. I overall was not impressed."}
{"text":"Delicious food, fun atmosphere, great service. Third time eating here while visiting ASU from California. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Personally hate this place. You can add their crappy service to one of the few things you can expect in life like death and taxes. It's consistently bad so I have no idea why I've gone back a few times. The food is ok but the table staff is run by high schoolers, or at least those that provie service like one, with no customer service skills anfd a huge lack of attentiveness (the bar is the worst). You could be waiting forever for them to come back. Take out service is even worse. The last issue I had was a catering order I had which was to be delivered next door. I prepaid and they never showed up! I called 3x and 30 minutes later some 14 year old is wandering in the parking lot with my order. Although they ended up comping the bill, the manager never called me back after I complained! Typical."}
{"text":"Great spot for lunch.  Spicy Chicken Pita is big enough for two!  Always busy, but they still manage to get you seated pretty quick."}
{"text":"I am so happy Pita Jungle opened in Norterra Shops!  The menu is the same at this location as the rest.  I LOVE the decor at this location.  The art is great and there is a nice area to eat outside.  The service is usually good and the food is always fresh.    I come here for Happy Hour with my teacher friends after work.  The specials on small plates and drinks are perfect!  We usually get the hummus, shrimp, garlic chicken, and possibly the scallops.  I love everything, but the scallops.  They seem to have a weird taste to them.    I recommend Pita Jungle  for anyone who wants to have fresh healthy food.  :-)"}
{"text":"Awesome service! Awesome atmosphere! Awesome food! Love the food!!!!! My kinda place! Healthy Mediterranean food! Yum!!! And great prices!!!! Loved it!!!!"}
{"text":"Disappointed with this supposedly veg friendly restaurant. I've been to many of their locations over the years and we go a couple of times a month because it's close and we meet family/friends there. The menu options for vegans are BORING. Plus the people who work there don't seem to understand why people would care if there is accidental cheese on their vegan food. The menus don't have vegan items clearly marked so you have to ask and the server has to check with the cook and the answer never seems confident enough for me. So we order the same things over and over and don't risk trying to substitute items. However, for example, if we wanted any of their sandwiches (portobello) it would have to be served without a bun because they don't have vegan buns. Their veggie patty/blackbean patty isn't vegan (at least at our closest location). The vegan menu/guide isn't up-to-date and having to cross reference it with the actual menu isn't convenient. The pita bread always needs to be substituted out for whole wheat (vegan), but unless you stress this for every menu item that comes with pita, the staff don't make the vegan connection (substitute it for you) so you will end up with whole wheat AND regular in your order (every time...it's comical). Side of hummus with whole wheat pita, falafel pita on whole wheat pita, pita chips that come with soup are not whole wheat please leave off order, etc. (We have been told that the pita chips are made with whole wheat pita, making them vegan, and we have been told that they are not vegan. Training or QA/QC?)   I am a little harder on them than other restaurants because they claim to be veg friendly. The last time we ate there, after stressing everything should be vegan and sending back regular pita, they brought whole wheat pita with cheese melted on part of it - accidental or are they just f'ing with us? Either way, the server's response was sarcastic and rude.  Over a year ago I made an online suggestion to corporate to update their menu with clearly labeled vegan options like other restaurants have, add a vegan bun for the portobello burger, and train staff to understand vegetarian versus vegan versus gluten free, etc. - this would be so easy to do! I selected my closest PJ location in the online form. Unfortunately, the manager of this location contacted me directly to tell me she is vegan too and that she enjoys restaurants that cater to vegans (implying that PJ cannot be expected to do that) and that the vegan guide is very helpful (she sent me a copy of it as if I hadn't already referenced it in my online feedback). She also told me that their staff are very well trained and accommodating when it comes to diet preferences. Wow, thanks so much for telling me my suggestions are unnecessary because your restaurant is perfect. So...since I consider my suggestions to have been completely ignored I submitted online suggestions to corporate AGAIN to update their menu with clearly labeled vegan options like other restaurants have, and add a vegan bun for the portobello burger and didn't identify my location or provide contact information. So far no changes.   The atmosphere is cool and other than a few clueless, and one or two rude, servers the customer service is usually very good. So if we are craving a pita full of beans, greasy chopped vegetables on salad or pita, soups, hummus or falafel (which is for sure vegan, but hit or miss taste/quality-wise), or the macro-platter (the most boring of the boring) I will only go here if I draw the short straw."}
{"text":"My visits to Pita Jungle consists of mostly hits with a few misses.   The pros- Happy hour is a bargain. $3 for any draft and they have good ones. Tapas are only a few bucks each. Keep in mind these are tapas. The portions are meant to be tiny. But they are perfect for leisurely nibbles. Our absolute favorite among the tapas are the mushrooms. Garlicky lemony mushrooms. Scrumptious. Our second favorite is the garlic dip. We actually prefer it over the hummus. The thyme pita is a good deal. $2 for a giant pita smothered in herbs, feta, and olives.  They have the best coconut curry soup. All their soups are good and usually vegetarian but this one is craveable.   My hubby likes their gyro and their fish dishes.  The cons- Their veggie wrap is not good. I have had it at the other locations and enjoyed it but not so much at this location. Too many carrots and too dry.  My husband didn't care for their chicken. He said it wasn't bad... it just wasn't anything special.  Service can be a bit apathetic. Servers do not look pleased to be there. We prefer the service at the bar. Bartenders are quick, efficient, and pleasant.   Bottom line- we stick to the bar, particularly for happy hour. Cheap booze, tasty nibbles, and a great view of whatever game happens to be on their TV."}
{"text":"Ok so I have been going here for a long time and just never got around to a review for some reason.  This is a great place to eat. The food is always hot and fresh. The staff is great and the atmosphere is casual and fun.  I highly recommend this place for lunch. Have the philly pita or the Schwarma   You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I walked in this afternoon CRAVING the (insert long name) Chicken Shawarma, walked by a table while we were being seated and I know I was probably gawking, but I wasn't drooling -yet.  Why in the world would Caramelized Cauliflower with Tahini cause such a reaction?!  I mean it's Cauliflower.  I have a thing for Cauliflower, so we ordered it.   This afternoon I decided to try something new and this was just a start.  My lunch choice is Beef Kafka. The starter was good.  I want the recipe or at least the basic instructions.  Nice touch with the Pine Nuts and Onions. The Beef Kafka is what I would call a Mediterranean version of a Tostada, or maybe Nachos.  Lavosh topped with cheese, beef, tomatoes, grilled onions, jalape√±os, green onion, Pine nuts, and a creamy sauce lightly across the length.   The flavors blended well.  If possible the flavors blended TOO well.  I enjoy being able to differentiate the flavors of the various items that come together to create a dish, this one wasn't giving me that.  May be one of the reasons I like Shawarma?   Don't get me wring, the Beef Kafka was good but I couldn't keep my gaze from wandering over to my sons meal.  What do you call that?  Oh yeah, Pesto Pizza on Lavosh for $1.50 more. Maybe I'll try that next time.  Our server was super sweet and darned efficient too.  We talked briefly before I ordered cuz my son had stepped away momentarily.  So yah, uh huh, she thought it was a date scenario  and didn't realize that I was the young mans mother.  Oh Jiminy and Jay Jose' Phat ().... Yep, Mom here.   So we giggled for a minute and it was back to business.  Pita Jungle is one of those places I like to go to occasionally cuz I don't want to get bored with the menu. The relaxed atmosphere appears naturally well lit which makes being able to see the menu a real possibility.  Art by local talent is promintly displayed, the nearby water feature provides a peaceful view, and the decor is eclectic (?), Bohemian (?), or simply a crazy mish mash of someone's personal style.  I'll be back again soon for the Jalape√±o and Cilantro Hummus and Chicken Shawarma. OH yeah, that Cauliflower dish I mentioned, I saw several more orders go out while we were there.  Must be a popular item.  And I almost forgot to mention something I didn't like. Soda/tea for almost $3.00. -I almost spit up. I guess that might be a way to discourage people from drinking soda, but tea?   Or maybe they're trying to encourage customers to order a beer or wine instead? Basically I just really dislike the idea of paying more than a buck fifty for soda. K, 'nuff from me."}
{"text":"I love Pita Jungle but I really prefer the Chandler location. It's just a personal preference ya know.  Same menu, great servers, chill atmosphere.  All the good stuff. I have popped in here twice for a to go order at the bar.  Good dark beer options and quality service too. I recommend the Jalapeno and Roasted Red Bell Pepper Hummus and the Chicken Shawarma.   Did I spell that right? My Man prefer the Philly Steak Pita.  You know, something familiar. Good stuff here.  Some say it's not as healthy as I think. Here's what I say.. What do they know?!"}
{"text":"This is in a great location and I am a little biased....as its within walking distance of a friends house.  It's great for a quick meal.  Always start with a humus plate....I adore the chicken wrap.  It's big enough to eat half there and take other half home.  Their drinks are reasonable as well.  Atmosphere is pretty chill and dress is casual."}
{"text":"I am not in love with Pita Jungle, but it def hits the spots depending on my mood. The place has a cool vibe and the food is pretty good as well. I would recommend this place for anyone who wants to eat a bit healthier than the average restaurant.  I usually get the turkey wrap but change it to chicken. It is pretty good and it always fills me up."}
{"text":"Simply put, this is our favorite place for a tasty, healthy meal."}
{"text":"When a quinoa salad is delivered to the table without quinoa, remake the salad immediately.  Don't drop a small plate of quinoa on the table and then give me an attitude when I ask for a spoon.    It doesn't take a rocket scientist for some basic customer service."}
{"text":"I had lunch today at the bar with a friend and found the service was the best we have ever had at any Pita Jungle in town.  I believer her name was Jennifer, she was attentive and engaging with all of her customers.  She could be a good trainer for all of their servers."}
{"text":"My favorite Pita Jungle yet!!!  Lunch on the patio on a Wednesday afternoon in January!  I am feeling very blessed."}
{"text":"I ordered take out and watched my food sit in the window ignored.  While people who arrived after me eat.   Hhhmmmm, this is not cool.  Kinda wish I could take my tip back."}
{"text":"One of the best spots to eat hands down.  I swear there is nothing bad on this menu.  Good for groups without the guilt on your waistline or your wallet.  No matter what I order, I have to set a side of the garlic potatoes...YUM!!"}
{"text":"Always a fan of PJ whether it's Arcadia, Desert Ridge or on 3rd Ave downtown .. I personally have not had a bad experience n I know it happens from time to time but they are quick to correct it if smthg happens. Great happy hour n the food is really good; tonight was no different. Tried take out for the 1st time .. From the phone order, to pick up/pay n them verifying the order all went perfect."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in Scottsdale - fresh ingredients, amazing Mediterranean dishes and efficient cool servers. The cilantro jalape√±o hummus is to die for, the coconut curry is amazingly good and don't get me started on the chicken tikka masala - rich earthy brown sauce over perfect whole grain rice - oh my! Josh and fellow servers are the best in the valley, friendly, memories like elephants and so kind. Don't miss Pita Jungle at Gold Dust and Shea. You will be back again and again."}
{"text":"I was happy to see a bit of food variety near the college campus. Often times, you have the same old -- same old. The prices seemed slightly higher for the food that you get and the service took a bit of time, but overall a decent place."}
{"text":"Been twice now to the new location. Food is delicious and the drinks are great. My side of potatoes (delicious nonetheless) came cold, and even after sending them back, they hit the table cold again. But my service was excellent! Great happy hour for anyone looking for a small bite and drinks."}
{"text":"This place is casual and has a large open patio for outdoor seating. Food is priced reasonably and tastes delicious. We ordered quinoa and tandoori chicken... Totally enjoyed our fish and chicken for the night. Service was good as well. In fact we ended going there twice in one week and we ordered gyros the second time... You will never be disappointed with any item on the menu... A must try if you are in the area..."}
{"text":"Normally pita jungle is so good but I got takeout tonight and the chicken looks like it's saturated in Taco Bell mild sauce and the veggies are burnt yet undercooked. I'm so irritated."}
{"text":"Amazing service.  5 star service, 5 star food, 5 star cleanliness, 5 star atmosphere, 5 star happy hour. Keep up the great work and good food! Tyler is always so helpful!"}
{"text":"I love Pita Jungle, it's fresh healthy food, service is always fantastic and you seriously can't beat their happy hour every day from 3-6pm! My fav item on the menu is their Wood-fired salmon salad served with mixed greens, roasted red bell peppers, tomatoes and cucumbers in a lemon vinaigrette. It's light, but filling and there is zero guilt after eating it!  Their Greek Gyro is pretty phenomenal as well. It has broiled beef & lamb marinated with spices and herbs, served in a Greek pita with mixed greens, tomatoes, onions, pickles and tzatziki.   If your looking for a delicious and healthy alternative then Pita Jungle is worth stopping by!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff and food is still ok but the new \"assembly line\" concept just doesn't work for their food. Was a big fan of several items on the old menu--without many substitutions--but now I have to try to recreate them on the fly and always forget something. Maybe there were a lot of customers with too many substitutions or complaint about ingredients so this new way makes some sense, but for customers like me I don't see how the new assembly line concept adds efficiency. Not to mention the meats come out cold. If maybe they took their 3-4 most popular items on the old menu and you could just order that (in addition to the assembly line) it might speed things up.  But I don't like the switch and don't see how it helps efficiency, while quality drops."}
{"text":"Update April 2013 - Love PJ!!! Had some new burger on the menu toda with real beef too!! It was this month's special I think...Anyhow, it was TASTY...and I was smothering it with more hummus and siracha...mmmm.....(cleaning up drool). So Rachel is the best server and this is mainly to give a shout out to her. She always remembers what we like to drink, that we get veggies with the hummus and not the pita, and the other sinful indulgences that we love to eat.  A good server knows their customer, is prompt with service, and has a smile on their face. She really does enjoy her job and that makes a huge difference.  I think this PJ has the best food and service out of the ones that I have eaten at. Rachel is a big reason that we keep coming back.  If you go, hopefully you get her :) and you should have a great experience. Just don't be a bitchy land-hag or douchebag because nobody likes those customers anyhow!!"}
{"text":"Place is delish!! First time there and I really enjoyed the food and atmosphere.   The jalape√±o cilantro hummus was amazing.  Food was healthy but didnt taste that way."}
{"text":"Good food and atmosphere. I'm not a huge fan of Greek/Mediterranean food, but I go here with friends who are, and they love it. The hummus trio is my favorite. Outdoor bar seating is nice when the weather is good."}
{"text":"You would think with a menu as varied and well executed as the one at Pita Jungle, they would be able to garner more than two stars. Unfortunately, the service here is so unbelievably horrible that I think I was generous in giving any. I'm fairly certain that Pita Jungle only hires ex-cons and starving artists, which I can totally get behind! As long as they're hard working people who are ready to serve. Because after all, you're servers. I'm not asking for extra attention here, just a plate or silverware, or, possibly a facial expression that doesn't make me feel like I'm bothering you when placing my order.    Our first visit resulted in 2 incorrect meals and one completely absent meal (after 3 reminders), but we were willing to overlook the terrible service assuming it was an unusually busy night and we came at a crazy time.   Tonight was take two, and while the restaurant was much less crowded this time around, the service was still surprisingly horrendous. I'm talking one appetizer arriving long before anything else...INCLUDING THE PLATES. We actually had to get up and ask for plates because our server was in the back with all the other servers comparing tats and hipster jeans rolls. I'm not sure who won because I didn't care about anything other than getting my damn plates. Or napkins. I'd take either one.  Total disappointment given that the food is really very good here. But unless you're a masochist looking for a little abuse during dinner (not judging, that's cool if that's what you're into), this is not your place. I'm not sure I'll ever go back, but I gave it a second chance. Maybe the other locations are a little better? The good news is that they can't be much worse."}
{"text":"On a street full of chains and fast foods, Pita Jungle brings a breath of fresh air that is the redundancy of Bell Ave.  Unfortunately, my expectations were too high upon my visit the other night. Had been looking forward to the cilantro jalepeno hummus, and was fairly disappointed. 5 bucks for a small dip is quite steep for something that tastes exactly like Trader Joe's jalapeno hummus dip ($2 and AMAZING!) My falafels tasted too burnt / salty and there was hardly any tzaziki, or any other sauce for that matter to compliment the pita.   Lots of other items to try on the menu that looked appetizing and will be on my hit list, but as for now, I think I'll pass on the falafels and will purchase my own delicious hummus right down the block at the local TJ's..."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant to go to when I'm on the North side of town. The dining area is actually pretty chic and they have a bar. The food is always great, I love chicken and hummus!"}
{"text":"Brieanna is such a wonderful staff member. I have had lunch here a few times and she is always so welcoming and accommodating. Truly great service no matter what. Thanks for making my break from work so enjoyable and easy"}
{"text":"Awesome! We're from la and this was a treat! Chicken del sol was awesome!  Go here there's something healthy and delecious for everyone!"}
{"text":"Great service, Nate was really attentive and kind. Awesome food! I recommend the curry soup...yum!!!"}
{"text":"I have always had a good meal at the Pita Jungle... But then again I always order that I know is good the Philly Chicken Pita (Saut√©ed marinated chicken breast, green bell peppers, sauteed onions, topped with Swiss cheese, and wood-fired in a Greek pita. Each time I come here it has been really good a must try if you make this stop."}
{"text":"I have not eaten at this place since they screwed me out of $20.  A friend and I both gave the waitress $20 bills for change and she brought my friend back his change.  I asked where my change was and she said she  was only given 1 $20 bill and that she had already brought the change for that.  She argued with me till I asked for a manager.  The manager, who I like to refer to as \"slim shady\", was not the manager at all, but was the COOK who was posing as a manager, because the real manager was not there.  He was wearing a wife beater and his pants were hanging around his knees.  He proceeded to say the waitress had worked with him for a long time and that he would vouch that she was a very honest person.  He also was dropping F*** bombs throughout our conversation.  In the end, they said  they would take my number and would call me if her tips were off at the end of the night.  RIGHT!  I never received a call and came to the conclusion that I had probably just bought them their nightly high...  Which leads me to my next gripe about this place.    The staff are a bunch of urban granola hippies. Dreds, tats, hairy pits, and piercings are all the norm.  Don't take your kids here because the odds of the waitresses wearing a bra are probably slim to none.  I would like to know where they get these people.  Enough already... I am wasting my time going any further.    DO NOT EAT HERE EVER!"}
{"text":"Their food is great but this restaurant is always hot, especially in the summer. I wouldn't not eat here if you're looking to cool off. It's miserable"}
{"text":"I am very disappointed and sad to say so. Me and my friend walked in, and it was obviously very busy. So we waited in line to put our names in the list but the host at the time kept leaving the host stand to do other things(I get it, you're busy but you have a job to do). We finally reached the front of the line when two ladies skipped everyone and put themselves on the list ahead of us. Calmly, I said, \"I just wanted to let you know that we have been here and they just cut in front of us\" and the host looked at us and said \"so you're mad about that? Get over it it's just a line.\" Mind you, we are just trying make sure he knew that those ladies were in the wrong and we weren't mad. A brief description of the host is rather short, dark hair probably in his 30's. We were extremely taken aback by this. It's disappointing because this is my regular location. As reaction like that is very unacceptable in food service. I get being very busy and stressed out, I work in a restaurant that gets much busier that what they were handling, in fact I host as well. But there is no excise for the reaction we got."}
{"text":"Terrible management. Condescending and down right rude. So much for customer service, management doesn't know the first thing about it. We will NEVER come back and will definitely spread the word! They've ABSOLUTELY left a bad taste in my mouth! I DO NOT RECOMMEND!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing here but I find at this particular location the service is always horrible. Even when I take out"}
{"text":"I come to this PJ location pretty regularly.  Big fan of the red pepper hummus, chicken philly pita, and the wood fired salmon salad!"}
{"text":"First rule of Brunch Club is that if you're going to be serving brunch, you have to be ready to serve brunch. The brunch crowd wants their food. They want eggs and pancakes and bacon and toast. Stat. At the very least they want coffee or a mimosa pronto.  Second rule of Brunch Club is to offer enjoyable breakfast items. I was sad to arrive here for Smunch one day and order something on the lunch side of brunch. For the first time. In my life. A chicken pita?  Don't get me wrong, the food was fantastic. Anything that sounds good usually is at Pita Jungle. They were also great with separate checks. I just think that brunch is a little lacking and could use some guidance. From true brunchers and breakfast enthusiasts."}
{"text":"i love this place.... my server Steve was so courteous & helpful he helped make our meal(which was great) even better"}
{"text":"I usually order Togo from this location at least once a week. Today my pita was okay. I wasn't very happy with the amount of lettuce over chicken. The parking at this location is awful!"}
{"text":"Been coming to Pita for years.   In general the food is great and the service is good.   I am however sick of their inability to change the really bad things.  Every wrap I've ever had here has tin foil in it. They wrap them in tinfoil and then cut through them with a serrated knife that causes little bits of tin foil to be in your food. Every time I have one, I tell the staff and their response is \"I know, I've told the cooks, but they just keep doing it.\"   I'm done going to Pita,  who knows what else the kitchen is doing to our food."}
{"text":"So glad Pita Jungle has more than one location - although truth be told, I'll probably come back to this location - 'cause it's right next to Gelato Spot!!  I had the chicken shawarma - perfect.  I always ask for extra garlic sauce - and theirs is outstanding.  My sons had the Kafka burger, and my husband had the Kafka pizza on special.  From the first bite, everyone was sighing with delight!  Fantastic service as well!"}
{"text":"Every time I'm back in Phoenix, I plan when and how often I'm going to Pita Jungle.  I've taken three separate groups of friends, and they have all become instant fans.   Love the outdoor seating area. My daughter has celiac disease, and she is always pleased with how many options she has and how tasty everything is.  I went to the E. Indian School Road location today and again was blissfully happy with everything.  Now, please let me preface this by saying I was there on a weekday early evening and the place wasn't busy.   My service was top notch and friendly.  I had the hummus trio and the garlic chicken from the tapas menu.  Both were super tasty and I know I'll try the garlic chicken off the main menu (appys) when I go next time.   I also had my regular, the chicken shawarma pita with extra garlic sauce. Perfect as usual. Of course, because I'd had the tapas, I took 2/3 home with me for lunch tomorrow.  Can't wait.  I almost forgot - how silly of me.  Of course I had a glass of their sangria.  My fav.  It was perfect as well.   Can I just say that I am pleasantly surprised by reading the responses from Pita Jungle to any negative reviews they see here on yelp.   I'll definitely be back and will be bringing more friends when I do!"}
{"text":"Good was great with quick and friendly service.  Really loud, too loud at lunchtime to have conversations. Will try and go at a later time."}
{"text":"We love Pita Jungle! I go to this location at least 3 times a week. The staff are nice and the food is always good, regardless if it's for dine-in or take-out. Our two favorite staff are Keith and Jen, their fun and actually engage in conversation:) Pita Jungle is A great option if you're looking for healthier food choices, especially for the kids."}
{"text":"Mmmmm... good food, great service, fair prices.  It is the whole package for us! Love going there for the fresh salads and yummy warm pita sandwiches."}
{"text":"PIta Jungle is one of my favorites. I think I may have tried almost ever item. From their pitas to their tasty appetizers to their smoothies - it's amazing. It's the restaurant I take any of my vegan and vegetarian friends too - same with gluten free. I just recently got into their entrees, and I love their wood-fired salmon with potatoes and sauteed spinach. It is so good. I get to-go here all the time, so tasty!  HOWEVER, I've usually had poor service at this location. They know their food is so good, it's like they don't have to be pleasant when you eat there. The food usually comes out promptly and it's always tasty - but my gripe has always been with a server who just didn't seem like they cared. BUT totally worth overlooking for this food. Really good for pretty cheap!"}
{"text":"Well,.... garlicky taters....chipotle chicken thingies..... a Philly steak pita.  Now I'm not what you call a small eater but damn....I had to try a few things for my first experience. My driver had the Portobello  Burger thing and really loved it. I tried a piece....well, I am not a vegetarian but it tasted ok to me! I like mushrooms just as much as any other.  I would say that overall deliciousness is 4 out of 5. Pricing is 3.5 out of 5. I will eat here more often...."}
{"text":"I'm sort of torn on this review because when I went to Pita Jungle a few weeks ago pats of it were really good, and other parts were really bad.  First off I guess I'll start with the bad. I went with my BF around 1:30, the lunch rush seemed basically over, there were a good amount of people in there though. When we walked in it took about 5 minutes for anyone to acknowledge us and to get seated. It looked like the manager was standing around chatting with employees. Another 5+ minutes went by and a girl came and took our drink orders, a different girl brought us our drinks then she said she would get our server. 10 more minutes went by and I was wondering what was taking so long since they weren't very busy and she came over and asked us for our drink order, once she saw we had our drinks she took our food order an that was basically the last we saw of her. Yet another girl brought us our food and no one came over for re-fills or anything which was disappointing. Our \"waitress\" did come back to give us the check and ask how everything was. We didn't tip very much since we had like 5 different girls help us..or something like that.  Now the good! The gyro was amazing, a great portion that I could barely finish. My BF got falafel that was also great. Loved the atmosphere and the \"feel\" of this place. I'll definitely go back and try to see if the service is any better. If the service wasn't so terrible this place would be a solid 4 stars! Worth a try for the yummy food...but still, so unimpressed with the professionalism here..or lack there of."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place 3 stars now because they did reply to my review and email me showing that they care. It's been 48hrs since I ate here and I'm starting to feel better. I'm thinking it might be the hummus. The kid didn't eat as much hummus and he had bad smelly farts. Friend and I ate lot more of it so maybe thats why we were so sick. Well I think we might be coming back because they do have good food, but it sure won't be for a long time.  Thank you!"}
{"text":"Hummus trio is awesome.  The servers have been slow in the past, and don't come back often enough to make sure you don't need anything else.  I love the openness of this location.  Their grilled chicken with garlic sauce pita/lavoshes, are so good."}
{"text":"Service is always friendly and prompt. I love the Tikka Masala.  The hummus combo is also a must have with chicken."}
{"text":"I had heard nothing but great things about Pita Jungle, so I was excited when one opened by me.    Maybe I'm spoiled because my boyfriend is middle-eastern and his family loves to cook, but I really don't think my expectations were THAT high.   I just felt very much that this place was all about the \"trend\" and very little about the \"food.\"    Hummus was decent, although we had to ask for olive oil. That should come standard.  And, the oil we were given was in an oil and vinegar tote clearly for salad dressing.   The absolute worst part of the whole experience for me was that we got one pita each for the hummus.  This plate of hummus was quite large, so you definitely needed more that one piece each.  Well, you gotta pay for more pita.  I know it's 50 cents or whatever, but it really aggrivated me....   I ordered the Mediterranean Roasted Chicken Pita.  It just wasn't good. The chicken was tender, but the mix of ingredients just wasn't flavorful.   And, I think they just smothered the whole thing in tahini thinking that would make it taste good.  My boyfriend had a gyro - the meat looked like it was frozen and re-heated.  Gross.   Good news is that they have Stella on tap.  But, I can get Stella anywhere...  I doubt I'll be returning to Pita Jungle.  I'd rather go to one of the many gyro shops around town that get waaay closer to authentic that this.   It's probably a great choice for vegetarians - I think back to when I was one and I think this place might have been a find based on everything else I saw on the menu."}
{"text":"The Bartender Rachel was incredibly nice and helped me picked out the Cilantro Jalape√±o Hummus with Chicken on top! The service was excellent and I was a priority while the food was decent. It wasn't much food for the $10.54 I spent without a drink but I will most likely revisit to try something else."}
{"text":"Went to  Pita Jungle last Friday for lunch. It was delicious. I had the gyro and added Feta cheese. I can not say enough? about how good it was. I would definitely recommend this place and hope to return soon."}
{"text":"Absolutely love the food and service. Always quality food and service. Best waiters and love the indoor decor. So good my wife and I had them cater our wedding. Try the Jalape√±o humus!"}
{"text":"This is absolutely one of our favorites. They have a great menu, friendly staff, short wait times, and the prices are very, very reasonable. You really can't go wrong by coming to this place :)"}
{"text":"Best happy hour in the area.  Wish the Desert Ridge location would lighten up on the staff and let them be-the vibe in Tempe is much more mellow.  Things to try:  Black Bean Burger and the Spinach pasta salad-must add chicken.  We always customize our app, by getting 1/2 red pepper hummus (ridiculously delish) and 1/2 tzaziki with a side of cucumbers.  This one is VERY kid-friendly and has the best service around.  We go once a week!"}
{"text":"Ive been living in Tempe for 3 years now and Pita Jungle has to be in my top 3 places to eat at any given time. The ambiance is awesome inside. The art work on the walls is always awesome, for sale, and gets turned every once in a while. The staff is always friendly and attentive. The food is great, fresh and healthy. Ive always ordered something different there and am never disappointed with whatever i get. Although not on the menu, i always order a side of sauteed broccoli which is the best broccoli you'll ever have. All and all, this is a great place for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"We venture to all types of restaurants and tonight we decided to eat here. I don't know if the restaurant was shorted handed, but our server seemed a little bit anxious. We started off with the Baba Ganoosh with extra pita. When the order came, no extra pita. I ordered the Wood Fired Chicken which was loaded with tomatoes, wish it looked more like the photograph on their website. Had to fight my way to the chicken which I believe was pre-cooked. Parts of the chicken was nice, but the outer edge was a bit overcooked. The spinach and smashed potatoes really added to the level of the dish. My wife had the Chicken Titaki Marsala which I had last time and she really loved it. She brought half of it home. If you want to eat healthy, this is the place."}
{"text":"We have a lot of restaurants to choose from but when you've had just about everything, it's time to dine at Pita Jungle. We should eat here more often 'cause the food is delicious. We started off with a small plate of Baba Ganoosh. Even tho' it's not mixed to a fine consisitency, it's still good. Instead of my usual, Chicken Schwarma, I decided to try something different, Chicken Tikka Masala. The flavor was amazing with a little hint of curry. The chicken was cooked perfectly, was moist, the pea sprouts added that crunch and the brown rice was not overwhelming. My wife ordered the Chicken Schwarma and when she tasted my dish, she said she is going to order that the next time. Her Mango Lemonade was refreshing. Our server was being trained and she did an amazing job, making sure we had our drink glasses full."}
{"text":"We've eaten here a long time ago and forgot how good the food was. We decided to eat outside since it was a beautiful afternoon and the sun was just coming down. All of the seats that were situated in the shade were taken but loving the sun we sat at a table near some palm trees. The trunk provided some relief, but lets get back to the food. We started off with a large half regular & Cilantro Jalapeno Hummus. The pita bread was much larger than I have seen and was enough to finish scraping the plate. My wife ordered the Roasted Garlic and Portabello pizza and I had the Mediterranean Roasted Chicken (shawarma). The pizza was thin and crispy which was really something delicious along with the roasted garlic and mushrooms on top.  My Shawarma was a handful. You needed both hands to hold this as you deiivered this wonderful morsel to your bite down on. I didn't think I could finish it.  Our server was wonderful and kept on checking on us and filling our water glasses. The outdoor area was clean and inviting. We were able to find parking in the 1 hour slots around 5:30 PM.  We'll definitely return."}
{"text":"In da jungle, Da Pita Jungle, The hummus rules the nite! Ah ooooooo.... in the jungle The pita jungle... Dolmades were also tight... heh heh! OOOOHhhh ahhhh ooooh weh dumm di di day...(repeat).  So I am singing about the Jungle because after a baptism there is nothing better than emersing your flavor buds into the BEST cilantro -lime- jalepeno hummus around!      Ok...Maybe one thing better might be having the thickest tzatziki west of Athens and yummy beef wraps.    Our group had things ranging from spicy chicken pizza, to chicken salads of various sorts ( by the way... loads of chicken on the salads!) and spanikopita.  I wanted to give full marks but I felt that the service was a bit of a miss.  We had a large party and even though we asked for more roomy accommodations which were available... we were ignored blatently as they shoved all our orders onto a small space and pretended not to hear our request to add a table twice!!    Other than that, I noted that the server paid attention to refills very well and the service was certainly prompt.  They are assertive with posting the gratuity as the actual price on the initial bill....so if you don't look closely, you will have paid the tip twice. A- weema wak, a-weema wak  on that!"}
{"text":"We love all the Pita Jungle locations but this one on Ray Road has become our favorite. the Chicken Del Sol is amazing, the wraps and salads are realllly good. the only thing better than the food is the amazing service.,"}
{"text":"A regular place for me.  This location has a really nice atmosphere.  Make sure to check out the wall-sized photo of Sky Harbor Airport during a dust storm.  They have a variety of hummus flavors that are fresh and yummy, as is true with most of what they offer.  I tend to get the Mahi tuna or a chicken shawarma.  Best I've had in AZ, so far."}
{"text":"Alright, I hate to do this because I absolutely love Pita Jungle, but it seems like the Tempe location is really slacking. I've been a loyal customer ever since the first Pita Jungle opened on Shea years ago. Since then I've been ordering the same thing maybe once every two weeks. I get the glazed chicken lavosh pizza, but instead of the regular onions on the pizza I replace them with the caramelized onions. Simple right? Wrong. I've ordered that pizza to go at this location three times where I've gotten home and they've just completely forgotten the onions. I know it can be confusing. Orders don't often come in with changes. Not trying to bust their brains.   But wait, it gets worse. About three weeks ago I actually decided to dine in. The pizza came out perfect. Exactly the way I wanted it. When I went to take my first bite I found a LONG hair was trapped inside the cheese. It had been cooked with my pizza. The person I was with didn't want me to make a scene and I agreed I didn't want to embarrass the server so I simply didn't eat that piece of the pizza. Looking back, I should have returned it.   The final straw was when I tried once again to order my pizza, the same way I always do a few days ago. When I got the pizza home I noticed there was a large bite taken out of one of the slices. Yes, a bite. It had teeth marks and the shape of the mouth. When I called, the manager made me feel stupid for even suggesting that that had happened and insisted the pizza was flakey. I told her I wanted a new pizza and that I'd show her when I came in. I mean, I've been getting this pizza for over two years and I know the difference between a flakey crust and a bite taken out of my pizza. PS. Who knew that melted cheese could be so flakey? I sure as hell didn't. Even after showing her the picture that at this point I had already shown all of my friends via text that all confirmed it was a bite she still insisted it was just the pizza. The manager made me feel bad about something that someone in her establishment did.   Pita Jungle if you care to see the pictures I have (which id think you would to) because someone who is working for you did this...instead of posting them on your yelp page I'd be more than glad to share.  Oh and whatever happened to the customers always right? I will probably never step foot in the Tempe location again."}
{"text":"In a word: yum.  Pita Jungle's menu is extensive, and it's food is delicious. It's impossible to leave this place hungry. My friends and coworkers all raved about this place, and everything they said was true. Several times I came by with larger groups, but the seating was always abundant and easily accommodated us. I only wish I hadn't moved from Arizona so I could go back!"}
{"text":"I tried the reverse happy hour.  Excellent value!  Draft Bud Light and Shock Top are only $2.  There are so many tapas to choose from, and at around $2 a piece, you can afford to try them all.  The service was adequate and the ambiance was good."}
{"text":"Definitely 5 stars for Pita Jungle - the food is always fresh, healthy and delicious.  Favorites? The cilantro jalape√±o hummus with chicken, the Mediterranean roasted chicken shawarma (I get it wrapped in lavosh bread instead), the caramelized cauliflower appetizer, the spanakopita, and the glazed chicken pizza. And the amazing summer special in my photo - some kind of avocado tostada goodness!  They do an amazing takeout business here and always have your order ready quickly. Though it does get a bit busy and crowded around the lunch hour! #thatjustmeansitsgood  Not to mention they are open LATE! So you don't have to eat crappy fast food if you are running late on eating dinner!  For those of you with a sweet tooth like me, get the iced chai to drink or peanut butter milkshake for dessert!"}
{"text":"Well food and service 2 star and hostess 4 stars.. poor girl alone in a freaking Friday night week before Christmas.. are you kidding me? Who in that restaurant is making the schedule? I am in the restaurant business... this is busy weekend.. staff full.. so you serve your guests well. Service sucks tonight. Half cooked rice and dry.. never got water refill from our female server with a tattoo on her right arm.. happy hour was never mentioned and got charge a little plate of humus for 5.99. That's does not matter. If you want business then create the atmosphere and staff up. Servers there if you want me to tip you real good( which I do 21%) then earn it. Don't expect if you do not deliver.. tonight was not what I expected. I have had better there.. something changed. Fix it. By the way where is management in that restaurant? They could get out from hiding and help their staff and earn some respect.."}
{"text":"I had lunch at this location and Carlos was the server.  It was a very busy time of day so I chose to eat on the patio.  Even though it was a busy time, Carlos was very fast and gave outstanding service.  Carlos was very friendly and knew the menu very well.  Pita Jungle always has great employees and Carlos stood out as an excellent, caring and dedicated  employee.  Being Vegan, I always ask a lot of questions and he was able to answer all of my questions and make recommendations.  Please say thanks to Carlos for the great service."}
{"text":"I wanted to thank another employee at this Pita Jungle.  Every time I go in, they are great.  This employee was Brittany on 11/15/2017 at 1230pm.  Brittany came to my table immediately and was so nice.  Every time my ice tea was down about half, she was there to fill it up.  My food came out really fast and when I paid, she was so fast at caring for the bill.  I don't believe anyone could be better at customer service.  She really stood out as someone that really knows how to make customers happy."}
{"text":"Woah! What the f*&^ happened to Pita Jungle?! When I first hit this new location I was worried, something is going to happen, and it's not going to be good. Service down the drain? Higher food prices? Different menu?   So far so good, although the decor has changed and the clientele is slightly different from other locations. You don't get that hippie, earthy, organic vibe at this new location. The decor is modern, they have a bar, it has high ceilings and lots of dining space - all these things are different from pretty much every other PJ location. I like it and I hate it at the same time, partly because lunchtime at this location its full of wannabe Scottsdale mommies \"eating healthy\" and drinking at noon(nothing again drinking at noon). It's really about the food though and that has not changed.  You still get large portions for a great price, the menu is the same. Service is quick, not that same hippiesque, brotherly friendly service at other locations but it's still not bad.  The Jalapeno-Cilantro hummus is still the best. The 1000 bean pita is huge and for less then $7 - you can't beat that. The hot veggie pita is great and on my last trip I had the macro platter which was excellent.   I hit this location because it is closer to my workplace now but I still like experiencing how PJ got started and hitting the original Tempe location or even the Shea/Scottsdale locale. The great thing is that all have consistently good food, portions and prices."}
{"text":"I'm worried that the business is down because of the economy and we might not see PJ around much longer. The parking is a nightmare, but the food is really good and healthy. Please patronize this place and keep it around. I used to go to the location in Tempe -I actually started going there when it first opened about 20 years ago. The portions are huge, and the flavors are distinct and fresh. I almost always get  the Mediterranean platter. It has these gross looking cold green beans (which taste fantastic), and a bunch of other Greek and med dipping hummus, tabbouleh, felafel, dolmades, etc. it's really good and comes with pitas. The pizzas are great, the fish superb, and the deserts are tops. The workers are eclectic, young, efficient, and nice. The prices are just right for what you get. If you are tired of the same old semi-fast food, and want something fresh, yummy, and healthy, go to Pita Jungle."}
{"text":"If you are a throw you're money anywhere because it's organic and also because on the flavor meter it's mediocre hippie or in common lingo puss then this is the place for you. 8 bucks for a gyro and nothing else to go with it? Fine I didn't pay for it but I felt bad for my friend who did. My gyro came with both beef and lamb wich really is 95% beef 5% lamb it was ok but 8 dollars for a single item with mediocre taste? Nah. My friends dad got a \"pizza\" which is according to him is \"a cracker with vegetables on top.\" Wasn't kidding I had a piece and that piece is proven to cause dehydration and consumption. My friends girlfriend asked how it was and I lied to her because she's such a sweet lady I told her it's good when really it's meh. I advise you the reader to heed my advice and have several glasses of water or whatever B.S. organic drink you have at hand otherwise it's gonna be desert storm."}
{"text":"We've eaten at this location many times, and always more or less had enjoyable experiences. However on the night of 9/5, we stopped in to get a bite, the mushroom burger and falafel bowl to be exact. The burger wasn't bad, but the beans on the side were cold, and the falafel bowl was made with cold and what felt and tasted like day old rice. It also lacked any sort of seasoning not even simple salt and pepper it was literally flavorless. There was also what looked like maybe one price of cold falafel chopped into bits mixed in. I really hope this location can improve."}
{"text":"Disappointed yet again. Had a bad experience last week with Pita Jungle. New staff being trained, bad energy, no greeting, just felt blah. The food was fine that visit, besides the pita bread being cold. Today was worse. Husband calls in an order for pickup, arrives only for a staff member to say they forgot to put it in and that they'll take 10% off of a $32.00 orderwhich would have been acceptable if upon returning home we had quality food to show for it. Wishful thinking. My macro platter was cold, husband's pita is lackluster, and my daughters fruit was covered in her mac and cheese portion. Giving two stars because our first two visits there were solid. We won't be back.   Update: I added two stars as our experience was taken into consideration by Kevin B. from customer service. He tried to rectify the situation by offering two free entrees and it was appreciated. About two weeks after our last trip, we decided to try again. While the food was slightly better, we just had to conclude it's in need of a bigger improvement. Best of luck for the future of the company because healthy food is important to us. Until next time PJ, in the far, far future."}
{"text":"Happy hour at night starts at 9PM. A Thone of selections in small portions for $1-$3."}
{"text":"It's back to being good! The servers are amazing and so nice! The gyros are great. I'm glad I can come back here again!"}
{"text":"Just awful! Zero consistency, constant errors, always something wrong w/the dish I order...always (epic rice fail tonight).  I had to give a star to continue  I'm done"}
{"text":"This location is crazy crowded on Friday and Saturday nights. Of all the locations I've visited this is my least favorite because of the waits. Minus one star. We usually arrive as a group of 6 after a movie night out with friends when we leave the AMC Ahwatukee. A 30-45 minute wait is common for us. As you'd expect from a Pita Jungle the food is great!"}
{"text":"I really like this place.  there food is delicious, with variety.  Love the gyro and would recommend the carmalized cauliflower.  really most things are very good.  love the atmosphere and the art."}
{"text":"The problem with PJ is the service. Seating was pretty quick, but once seated it is as if I disappeared. Everything seemed to be an effort. Service in general has gone down hill. I wish they were engaging and checked to see if our table needed anything. The staff is always looking down at the floor instead of scanning the tables to see what is needed. I am guessing this a management / training issue. I am pretty sure the staff have not been trained to be attentive. Now the food. I am sitting here for the happy hour and I have to say it is ok. I am in Phoenix, so it is pretty limiting on the Mediterranean food. so I guess this is as good as it gets here in Phoenix."}
{"text":"We entered and got seated right away, the server was great and the wait time to eat wasn't bad. I didn't have negatives here it was delicious and fresh tasting. I would go back it was amazing all around !!!"}
{"text":"Chicken tikka masala has the best flavor of any dish I've had in a while. Gf and I always get the jalape√±o cilantro hummus too!  Sit on the patio by the water if you can. It's beautiful and then you don't have to politely clap after each song by the indoor musicians. They had live music on a Thursday night which wasn't bad but we'd prefer to hear each other!"}
{"text":"How could you not like pita jungle, everything here is amazing I LOVE their garlic dig and their chicken combination plate, as well as their CHICKEN Philly, I stress the Chicken part the one time I had the steak one it tasted like chorizo and grossed me out I hate chorizo. But other then that I love this place, and I like how easy it is to pick up a call in order with the side to go window. :)"}
{"text":"I have to wonder why we bother coming back.   While the food is good, it's really not any better than some other places that are around. The service is hit or miss. You usually get seated quickly enough but that's often the only thing that's quick. It seems like a jumble and there seems to be no distinct organization to who is waiting on which tables.   If there's any plus, it's the back patio overlooking the lake."}
{"text":"Co-workers and I ordered from this Pita Jungle on 05/25/2018 via Grubhub. Our company will be taking our business elsewhere going forward.  To start this experience, the food was 20+ minutes late; which I can't fault Pita Jungle for. What I CAN an DO fault Pita Jungle for is the monstrosity of an experience we had and the horrific customer service from the people working in the establishment.  We ordered the Mediterranean chicken salad, full size red pepper hummus(NO pine nuts, co-worker has a nut allergy), grilled chicken and pita bread.  What we got was a warm half potion of Mediterranean salad, a small order or red pepper hummus WITH pine nuts, no chicken and a poorly wrapped rock hard portion of pita bread.  None of the food was edible and we had to order from somewhere else to salvage our lunch.   We contacted the Pita Jungle on 7th St. who refused to fully refund the order and had zero sympathy in regards to our situation. In the end, Grubhub refunded us and apologized for our experience at Pita Jungle.  We did contact Corporate Pita Jungle via email and were finally able to speak to someone that knew what customer service is."}
{"text":"We really had a great meal the last time we were at Pita Jungle. The wait staff was very nice and attentive (they sometimes can seem unmotivated). I had one of the specials, the spicy mango shrimp with ginger fried rice. It was soooo good! Sweet and spicy, and the shrimp were not over cooked. The ginger fried rice was surprising for how much flavor it had. There were bits of broccoli, cauliflower and carrot cut to about the same size as the brown rice, it was delicious.  My friend had another of my favorites, the mahi mahi on cilantro hummus. She said it was the best meal she had had in a long time. The fish was well cooked, and the cilantro hummus makes a great base/sauce for it. It's served with large crunchy pita chips. My son had the kid's meal, which is a really good deal. Kid's get a placemat that has a picture of a plate on it, and they can choose something from each quadrant, a starch, a protein, veggie and/or fruit. He picked a double order of mac n cheese, chicken and fruit.  We also enjoyed their all day happy hour prices for wine and beer! Well, the adults did, my son enjoyed the lemonade. ; )"}
{"text":"I had always heard great things about Pita Jungle, but it wasn't until a recent visit there that I became a believer. Really great food for a reasonable place!"}
{"text":"Great food. I always get the chicken pasta and it is great oh and the lemonade is the best. If you are in the area you should really check this place out.   The only down fall is the seating inside, it sort feels like a cafeteria, but other than that I think this place is great."}
{"text":"Great customer service and good food too!! Our group of 9 adults and 2 kids went here during the easter weekend. We ordered falafal platters and pitas. After 20 min they came and apologized for not having falafals and said that they can replace them with tofus. We insisted on falafals which they said would require 1/2 hr to prepare. We agreed. They brought the falafal dishes as promised and also gave a 30% disc coz of the wait. !!"}
{"text":"Love the food selections here. I almost always get the Mediterranean antipasto plater. It has a little bit of everything and is super delicious. Good atmosphere. Also got a dessert for the first time (carrot cake) and it was bomb."}
{"text":"A friend and I came here in between lunch and dinner last weekend. We usually go to the Pita Jungle on Roosevelt, but this one was closer. The decor is amazing. Absolutely beautiful. The food was typical PJ food, but the service was the worst I've ever had. We kept trying to leave reviews while there, but neither of us were getting any cell service. I had to ask for my appetizer after our dinner arrived. Then I had to ask for extra balsamic vinaigrette 3 times before actually getting it. My friend kept clinking her ice around in her empty glass after asking for a refill 3 times. I ended up taking half of my food home, and I had to order a tofu del sol for my husband. The portion size of their takeout is much smaller than if you had sat there and eaten it. We'll continue to go to the PJ on Roosevelt, but we'll never come back here again. We counted 6 people on the wait staff, 2 people hanging out at the hostess podium, and the restaurant was more than half empty. There was no reason service should have been this bad. At least the food was still good."}
{"text":"I love their hummus. It's like none other. They're not expensive for a sit-down restaurant. Pitas are HUGE... exceptional flavor, but typical combination of ingredients on most items.  The best part: it's right off of the light rail!!"}
{"text":"Deeeeeelicious! We have tried many different  things from the menu and are never disappointed.  Pita Jungle is my favorite place to go!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner with friends after a couple of drinks across the road at The Handlebar.. Always great to eat here - nice serving staff, quick service and fresh tasty food. We got a variety of things to eats (homes, baba ghanoush, lots of sharing dishes. Wine list is pretty basic but its not the place you go for an expensive meal essentially. We had a great time there and definitely visit again if in the area - there is a Pita Jungle closer to our place but they are all good.."}
{"text":"My girlfriend were in the mood for a quick bite of something other than fast food yet still a little different that our usual lunch date fare so we decided to give this a try. I'm grew up eating Mediterranean cuisine of all types so I had a good idea of what to expect. My girlfriend, on the other hand, is a native of mainland China so this was something fairly new for her.  We shared the Roasted Bell Pepper Hummus appetizer, Gyro Bowl with Brown Rice, and California Beach Lavosh Wrap The portion sizes were more than enough for the two of us and we were thoroughly satisfied.  Everything was as good as one could expect from Pita Jungle, although it would have been nice if the pita bread served with the hummus had been a bit fresher and warmer. My girlfriend mentioned that she thought the Gyro Bowl was a little \"heavy\" however I assured her that it was typical of this type of cuisine.  Courteous service, the prices were fairly reasonable, really nice location, and this is a decent  place to stop, especially for those if you who are familiar with this type of cuisine.

{"text":"Ate here after a long day at work in the hospital in Tuscon and decided we'd rather dine in Phoenix. Since it was late we decided at Pita Jungle. We were surprised the food was pretty good.   The waiter was great he brought us an array of appetizers hummus, pest hummus, falafel and cucumbers with Pita bread. The chicken tikka masala was actual decent and so was the shawarma wraps. It was perfect after a long day.   The waiter was great friendly and great at suggesting what we should have when we had questions. The menu was a blend of different cultures which was great cuz if you can't decide what to eat there are enough choices on the menu."}
{"text":"Pita Jungle is one of the best deals for food in town.  Very fresh ingredients and large portions for a great price.  I rarely if ever finish even half of my meal which gives me lunch for the next day.  I've had ever appetizer and they are all solid.  The nachos are a meal in itself.  They have tons of vegetarian options for those that don't eat meat or folks like me that want a break from it every once in a while.    We never pay more than $30 for 2 people and that includes two meals an appetizer and a couple of iced teas.  The place is very laid back and attracts a wide range of characters.  Someone forgot to tell them there is a recession, very busy during dinner time.  The food always comes out quick though.    Pita Jungle is in the weekly rotation for us due to the selection, affordability, and casual atmosphere."}
{"text":"Have been to pita jungle in Pasadena, CA before and stumbled upon this place while staying in Chandler, AZ. When we first walked in, we weren't really greeted and had to walk around before people noticed us. After we were seated, we ordered our drinks and food and began eating as it was our first meal after a long drive from Los Angeles, CA. After eating a bit, we noticed a long hair underneath our pita bread which wasn't too much of a problem as had it returned to the kitchen. The server brought out new pita bread which was hot, I guess it was fresh? Fresher than the cold pita bread we received before.   Service isn't very attentive but the food is good, so I can't complain too much. At least they're friendly. Overall, food quality is consistent to the Pasadena location which I have frequented many times. Good healthy lunch to start off our vacation. Location is pretty big, so maybe just have servers keep an eye out for guests walking in so they don't pile up at the door waiting."}
{"text":"The food at this Pita Jungle is as fantastic as any of the others. But there's a big difference between this one and others I've visited. The atmosphere.   Most Pita Jungles tend to have a more bohemian look. Very artsy, but not very chic. The Desert Ridge Pita Jungle instead goes for a very contemporary look. As my girlfriend puts it, this is the \"yuppy\" Pita Jungle. There's a bar with big screens above it playing sports in HD. The lights and decorations all look like they are at a chic new hot spot. But the food is just as wonderful, and gets to your table just as quickly as all the others.  And there's absolutely nothing wrong with that!"}
{"text":"It's a pretty good quick service version of the Valley's best Mediterranean restaurant. This Pita Jungle has a drastically reduced menu that is perfectly suited for Fashion Square's food court. It's also probably one of the healthiest food choices in the mall.   I was on a shopping mission that the mall after work and got pretty hungry, so I hit up the food court for a quick bite. I had the Philly Chicken Pita. The food was ready quick, was very reasonably priced for the portion size, and had an excellent flavor. It's not quite as tasty and fresh as what you'd expect from a regular Pita Jungle, but it's certainly better than most fast food. However, The pita was way too soft. The wrap was falling apart in my hand even with the aluminum foil still around it.   The set up is pretty good for a small food court spot.  You order on the left side of the counter, then move over to the right side to pick up your food when it's ready.  It's pretty much the same as the Paradise Bakery that's also in the food court, but somehow it doesn't feel as crammed.  Most of the menu has pictures of the food, the rest is written in a big enough font that's easy to read.  I don't find myself in the mall all too often, and I wouldn't head to this Pita Jungle as a destination. But if I'm at Fashion Square and feeling hungry, I'd happily stop by again."}
{"text":"Great Mediterranean!   I've been going to Pita Jungle for as long as I can remember, and I cannot get enough of the place. You must have the Hummus here. It's second to none.  Make sure you order a second pita.  All the food is great.  The staff is a young artsy crowd if you get my drift. You kind of have the feeling that you're eating at a place in the Village in New York. Infact, the atmosphere is feels pretty artsy, too. That's actually pretty odd considering this location is in a run down shopping center just off of ASU's campus."}
{"text":"We had Pita Jungle cater an office party for us this week.  The food was fantastic, they were right on time & the delivery guy Tim was great.  When he put the beverages down, I questioned it, I thought that I had ordered a gallon of Iced Tea & a gallon of Lemonade.  I may not have made myself clear when I placed the order though, because Tim delivered a gallon of Arnold Palmer (1/2 tea, 1/2 lemonade).  He said that he could go back & get the correct drinks.  I told him not to worry about it, we were fine, we had other beverages.  He thanked me & left.  Well, about 15 minutes later, he showed back up with a gallon of Ice Tea & a gallon of Lemonade.  He said that he couldn't accept a tip from us & not give us what we wanted.  Wow, you don't hear that very often anymore.  That is a great example of the customer service that I wish that I saw every day.  Tim, you are a Rock Star in our book.  I hope that we get you next time we order from Pita Jungle - and I definitely will be ordering from them again!"}
{"text":"Super disappointing ... came into this location yesterday for lunch . I gave them one star cuz our server was awesome . We ordered red bell pepper hummus to start and we realized the hummus tasted horrible and way off like someone threw a container of salt in it or maybe it was expired . I have never had this problem from other locations or this bad of food . We ordered the chicken salad pasta and a lamb burger . The lamb burger was way over cooked and my pasta tasted once again like salt was over added . My boyfriend later on was extremely sick from the food and we won't be into another pita jungle for a long time in fear of getting sick again . We won't ever come back to this location . Never seen my boyfriend sick from any food , he has the tummy of a rock ."}
{"text":"Had such a good lunch here! I walked in during lunch time and was able to sit at the bar and just grab a quick bite. The veggie wrap was pretty good and the service was fast and friendly, the waitress got me and ice tea to go after I paid my tab which was greatly appreciated."}
{"text":"Pita jungle may be everywhere and there is a reason. With vegan and vegetarian options it's great for everyone (if your kids aren't too adventurous and only like McD's than maybe not)... My favorite is the seared ahi tuna on hummus app. It's a meal in size and is so delicious!!!! The butternut squash soup is out of this world too!"}
{"text":"So much better then Amy's Baking Company Bakery Boutique & Bistro"}
{"text":"We had the most DELICIOUS dinner at Pita Jungle tonight. The wood fired salmon is superb and the wood fired chicken is equally as amazing. Rick, the manager is very welcoming and makes sure you had a fabulous dining experience. HIGHLY recommend!!!"}
{"text":"We met a friend here on a recent Saturday for lunch.  I was surprised how busy it was, since last time I was there, it wasn't quite a ghost town, but close.  Anywho, we had to wait about 10 minutes or so for our table to be prepared (party of 7), but it wasn't a big deal since we were a little bit early.    We got seated and after chatting for a bit, placed our orders.  I don't remember what everyone else got, but I got a gyro.  I do remember that my wife's food did not get brought out in a timely manner.  Either they forgot to make it, or mistakenly gave it to another table.  As a result, my gyro was less than hot, because we all waited until she had her food.  Another weird thing...I figured the gyro would come with a salad or rice or something on the side...it was just straight gyro.  But, it was still quite delicious.  And other than that snafu, the service was good.    I would return to Pita Jungle.  Thought about three stars b/c of the food delay, but both times I've been the food has been quite good, and my food this time still had good flavor.  More like 3.75 rounded up to 4."}
{"text":"Such a fun lunch place! Hubby ordered a pizza and I ordered a chicken curry salad. Both were amazing! The salad would feed three people. Loved the house Chardonnay! Our waiter was fantastic!"}
{"text":"Always fantastic service, very attentive employees, the food is consistently good, and they do a great job of keeping it together during their very busy lunch hours."}
{"text":"I've taken out from this Pita Jungle location several times, but my main experience with them is through corporate catering. The Scottsdale/Shea Pita Jungle caters my office of 100 about 1-2x a month. The food is always hot, fresh, and delicious. They make ordering and delivering easy and stress free. Best of all, the price point is incredibly fair and the value is great for the quantity and quality provided.  If catering is what you need, I definitely recommend this location."}
{"text":"Excellent service by Shelby we had a Middle East feast with all the traditional plates-tabulli plate fresh greens, tomatoes  I had the deliciously dry chicken schawerma plenty of veggies, chunks of well-seasoned chicken and side order of avocado all delicious  cuisine but NO Wifi  lost a star."}
{"text":"I went there for lunch with my wife and the food was amazing!  They have so many options and it is all fresh.  Not to mention the services was exceptional.  I had 14 family and friends in town to watch me complete in the Ironman and I took them all there the day before.  Everyone loved their food!  If this place was in Orange County I would go a few times a month.  Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"I've been going to this Pita Jungle since a long time ago.  I have never had a bad meal.  Service has always been fantastic.  I love how they are situated overlooking the lakeish area.  It's got lots of windows and lets light in and in the evening, it's not too dark.  We've never had bad food at any of the Pita Jungles, but the ambiance of each one is quite different.  When I was single, I would go with my sister to lunch here.  When I got married, I would go with my husband.  Now that we have children, we go with our children.  Because they have a good variety of foods even for those with allergies, it's a great place to meet up with my siblings and their families.  Love, love, love this place.  However, it's too far from where we live, so when we moved 5 yrs ago, this was just too far to drive and we've cut down on our eating out.  However, this is a great place to great really super delish food at reasonable costs with great service.  If only all restaurants were this good."}
{"text":"I think I like the Dobson one better, but this one is much closer to our home.  We've been here a couple times and the food is consistently good - so I give this a 5 star.  But, the restaurant is super dark, like it's hard to tell what you're eating or see people.  They could use just a little more light (not saying blaring, but a bit more).  I don't particularly care for the seating arrangement of this restaurant as we were seated so close to another party next to us that I could just reach and take their food to eat.  That's too close.  So, I give this a 3 star.  Also, the restaurant is incredibly loud.  I felt the noise level was way too loud and I don't know if the acoustics of the place was just kind of tinny or what, but everything seemed amplified, like way louder than a Chinese restaurant.  Though the other Pita Jungle we go to in Chandler is bit bigger, it seems like the sound diffuses better keeping the noise level down.  I give the noise level a 1 star at his Pita Jungle.  But, the food is incredibly good and you get nice portions without being HUGE nor too small.  Just right.    I only wish I could hear my thoughts when I'm in there, seeing the delicious food I'm eating, and not have to be so chummy with total strangers.  All the staff was nice, so great customer service.  Everyone upbeat and friendly."}
{"text":"On Friday nights when our kids have karate, my husband and I go out on a quick date together without children to nearby places to eat.  This week we tried Pita Jungle in the Dana Park plaza, which we've never been there.   I've been to the Pita Jungle in the Kohls shopping center on Val Vista & Williams Field  and the one on Dobson & Ray.  Those are good.    The service here is excellent!!!  Sorry, I can't remember our server's name, but she is a slender woman with brown hair and a super pleasant and accommodating attitude.  I ordered the Gyro Pita with Garlic Potatoes and my husband ordered a Grilled Chicken plate with rice & beans and a large pita.  It also have plenty of pickle spears and red onions with some garlic sauce.  Since the inside was packed and we were in a hurry, I said it would be fine if we sat outdoors.  They have three overhead long rectangular heaters overhead that was for the patio seated area.  We got seated right away at a table for 2 near a father & his little daughter on a date.  That was so sweet.  I think our food came within 10 minutes of ordering it.  Very quick.  While eating, our server checked on us a couple times, so not too often and just right.  During the course of our meal, I wanted some cucumber sauce for my gyro pita because I just love that sauce.  She brought me a side of this and did not charge extra for this.  The gyro was a little salty, but my taste buds recently have been in a not good state and I haven't had a huge appetite for food.  However, I did manage to eat all the whole big gyro, sharing the potatoes with my husband and down about 2/3rds of a Chamomile tea.  I think the Gryo Pita was $6.99 and the side of garlic potatoes were $1.29.   My husband's Chicken Combo Plate was $10.69.  Drinks were a little pricey at $2.89 each for a Coke and for the tea.  But, I guess for a sit down place, this is fine.  My husband was only able to eat half of his dish because it is a rather large plate of food.  We actually could have just shared this.  We had a good experience and it was rather romantic to sit outside with the lights on the palm trees down the Dana Park Plaza lit up.  It wasn't too noisy outside, which I loved and the heaters kept us reasonably warm as it was pretty nippy outside.  Will come back to again sometime."}
{"text":"This place is always so packed with people and with the smell of the food wafting outside as you walk by ..how could you not stop in and check it out. Those that read my reviews know how much I love my coffee and with Lola's right next door it was inevitable that I'd have to try this place out. When I walked in it took a bit to be seated because the host was running around. Great menu, and price wasn't too bad, but a little more pricey than I'd like to pay for lunch, but worth it for sure. I ordered a gyro and a side of rice. I was disappointed at first it didn't come with any type of other side, but when it came I'm so glad it didn't because this gyro was huge! I never would have been able to finish anymore food. Great taste and the rice was flavorful and perfect. Service was ok. It was kind of hard to get my water refilled, but again it was super busy and lunch time. Still a great experience."}
{"text":"This kind of place is not my first choice usually, but I loved it. The food was good, and even my super-picky little step-sister loved her food. I have two little ones, a 3-year old and a 10-month old, and it's super nice to have something on the menu besides grilled cheese and a corn dog. My 10-month old loved the hummus as much as I did. Pita Jungle Hummus was the first hummus I ever tried years ago and it has spoiled me, I have a hard time eating any other hummus. Perfect consistency and taste."}
{"text":"i am a vegetarian with vegan tendencies and i stopped here without knowing anything about it at the whim of a couple mates either to or from the hark a while back. i had been craving a burger, and so the pita jungle was a very lucky find. the burger was a bit dry, but i would eat here again due to how vegetarian-friendly the menu is; if you are vegan, you can find out what is vegan from their site (or just look up 'pita jungle vegan' via your search engine of choice).the hummus lasted for a while after i took it home (a week or two?). their hummus is tr√®s savoureux, and our waiter (?) was more than happy to give us a sampling of all three types- i recommend asking for extra pita."}
{"text":"Every time I am in Phoenix, I absolutely MUST stop in to have the Chicken Del Sol!   Paired with a glass of wine, the perfect dinner on a chilly day"}
{"text":"This is my go to place on Arcadia! Salmon and chicken pasta salad rock and steamed veggies and hummus."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I used to go to Pita Jungle at least a couple times a month.  Usually the one on Shea Blvd. and a few times at the other locations.  The Shea location was always our favorite.  The staff was always pretty good and the food was delicious.  We usually got the same thing every time.  Hummus and pita, portabello mushroom sandwich, greek salad with chicken.  We had not been to any of the Pita Jungles in a few months and today we went to the Shea Blvd. and it was not good at all.  Our waiter was very nice but the food was not good.  The hummus tasted different, the portabello mushroom sandwich had no flavor at all and they did not have the greek salad with chicken on the menu anymore.  My boyfriend got another chicken dish but he said it was just ok.  I think they changed the recipes of some of the dishes which are not good at all and removed some dishes that were pretty tasty.  It's really disappointing but I don't think we will be going back to any of the Pita Jungles :-("}
{"text":"The service was ok.  The servers bumped into us several times because the tables were so close together.  We had 1 person take our order, another bring our drinks and a third bring our meals.  The portions were small for the price.  I was disappointed in my chicken wrap.  It did have big chunks of grilled chicken but had no sauce or flavor.  The wrap/bread was too big and it came with no sides.  My husband and mother in law both had fish over some sort of hummus.  The fish was good but the hummus was lacking flavor.  And again, the only side these came with were about 6 pita chips.  For the price, head across the stree to The Greek Pita."}
{"text":"Went to Scottsdale from Omaha for a family golf trip.  I am newly vegan so this place gave me a good option due to my dietary restrictions.  It was fantastic.  Got two falafel wraps definitely recommend and totally vegan.  Got a side of rice and that was not the best.  But two of the wraps left me very full."}
{"text":"Have been to many Pita Jungles and one moved into my neighborhood.  I have had take out that someone has picked up for me but I has not been to this brand new location.  I was there for a business meeting and when I first walked in, I was impressed with the size of the location and how bright and large the space was.  Once I joined my party, I was quick to recognize that our female server was not engaged and the person I joined was visibly annoyed by her first 15 minutes before I arrived.  The service was sub-par!!!!.... attempted for sure...... but the waitress was quick to drop a refill and not to engage or understand our requests and needs.  The food was the standard fare and pretty good, however when we tried to flag down our waitress to get a spoon for our Hummus...................  she was less then excited to assist us.  The decor was less then interesting and has some odd paintings of swimmers and divers in the bathrooms and on the designated doors for \"Women and Men\"....  The dress code of the staff reminds me of what people in their 20's look like when they wake up from a drunken Friday night.  HORRIBLE.....  hard to determine who was our server but more importantly who had showered? Who has taste in dressing and who thinks spandex is a right and not a privilege!  Come on Franchise owners!!  Pull it together..... what brings us back?   There are five restaurant options within walking distance that have opened...  what is intended to be our draw to you?  OUR Waitress was disengaged, our tables wobbled so bad we had to put serviettes under a leg, NO Wi Fi to connect and  the vibe was lack luster....  Hummus only draws your patrons in so much!  GREAT Happy hour prices however very limited selection!  Who is picking your wine selection??  I will not be rushing back!"}
{"text":"possibly the best vegetarian friendly restaurant in phoenix.  love the pita crisp.  pretty good beer on tap,  and lots of menu choices.  we usually sit at the bar where they have several HD tv's and a full liquor selection.  great atmosphere too.  i've been to 2 other pita jungle locations and like this one the best."}
{"text":"Healthy and delicious! Red bell pepper hummus with chicken is my go to, but never disappointed when I venture to try something new. My kids and I have been loving this restaurant for years. Ask for Josh! He's not only an excellent server, but will make your dining an experience!"}
{"text":"Food good, service horrendous.  Sitting at the bar, by myself with servers and a bartender more interested in gossiping than any awareness of service.  I had to ask for, \"can I order\", \"refill\", \"pay\", etc., virtually ignored.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"I  eat at this location about once each month. I love the food and hate the service. I was there last night ( a Monday night) and it was not crowded. The soup I ordered was brought with my dinner while we waited at least 25 minutes. My main course was very good but my potatoes were cold and my husband's pizza was cold.  Why or why can't they work out the service issues?"}
{"text":"Pita Jungle (Chandler). Not much to say about the Pita jungle; the food speaks for itself.  Nice atmosphere, alright service, and great, great food; left something off the plate but, I still wish there was one back home.  Had some sort of great version of spanakopita as in traditional Greek food, but this was amazingly puffy and light.  I'm in NY and wouldnt think twice about coming here again; Enough said."}
{"text":"This is my favorite location of Pita Jungle in the valley, it was the first one I went to and has always been my go to when in the area. Light food, that doesn't make you feel terrible afterward. The kids options are awesome cuz it's healthier then most places. Jalape√±o hummus with chicken is way, on point. Also the pesto lavosh wrap with chicken instead of turkey, one of the servers recommended it and I couldn't have been happier. Gets alittle crowded cuz this is a smaller location then the others but that's not a bad thing! Really awesome environment, kid friendly, and the servers are always nice!"}
{"text":"The happy hour is the time to go to this place. There are great options and they're really cheap. They also have great sangria. I'll always be back!"}
{"text":"We absolutely LOVE PJ, but much to our dismay, have had nothing but issues with this location.  We order TO GO once or twice a week and have, finally, decided that enough is enough! Our orders are incorrect more often than correct and the portion sizes are not even comparable with other PJ's in the valley. We always order the large Greek salad with HNC Chicken and avocado. It ends up being close to a $15 salad and doesn't even fill the plastic box it comes in. Last night when we got our salads home, we truly couldn't believe how stingy they were with the chicken. Each salad had a half (or possibly less) of a chicken breast! Ridiculous. If I want PJ, I'll go to the desert ridge location, where the staff is competent and the portions are reasonable!"}
{"text":"We waited for at three or four minutes before we finally got welcomed by the waitress and taken to our table. The kitchen staff all saw us standing there waiting....FINALLY the waitress came from out of nowhere because she was told. I couldn't believe who was waitressing us! Well...I CAN now after such a terrible experience here. She was wearing a black tank top and you can see her purple bra from the top and the sides of her shirt!!! I don't know if I would trust being served by the way these folks dressed.  Anyhow, while we were waiting (before the waitress got us), we watched the guy in the cap pouring beer at the bar. It was funny to watch;  we thought maybe he was covering for someone because he obviously did not know how to pour the beer. It was foaming so much and when he was finally done, he had to wipe the glass all down.   So let's get to ordering...It was happy hour since it was 9pm so I ordered a sangria, salmon slider and gambas con ajo. There were five NOT JUMBO shrimp drenched in what tasted like Tabasco with no heat and full of diced tomatoes. The pesto and cheese pita was so soft and soggy. The shrimp was alright. The sangria was weak, and I'm not a fan of the taste of alcohol so I would know if there was much alcohol in there. I'm a huge foodie and not so much an alchy. Anyways, then came the salmon slider. Now folks, my nose would be the last to know there's a fire. I thought I was insane when I thought there was a weird smell but I made the man who was eating his burger smell my salmon slider. I LOVE LOVE LOVE seafood. I LOVE raw sushi and sashimi. BUT the smell was rancid like a sewer. I've walked by sewers enough time to know what that smells like. My partner asked for the manager and when he told the manager about the salmon slider, the manager's answer was to quickly clap his hands and say \"hey unfortunately though our salmon sliders are pre-made patties so I'm sorry for that....maybe we got a bad batch and thanks for letting us know. I'll look into that\". Guess who was the manager? The guy that couldn't pour beer.   We then waited for another 5 minutes not seeing anyone come by to pick up our check. So we started walking out with the book in our hand. The manager was at the bar and waved us off \"oh she's coming to get you\" and then waitress checked us out by the kitchen. While we waited, we noticed it was only 9:32pm, another half an hour before they close. Already all the kitchen staff were cleaning and scrubbing the floors. Now we wonder if they had been cleaning while making food or if they left the salmon sliders out.   I've been to the other location but I personally will never return to this location. I hope this review helped someone out there before they get sick or receive the same service we did. This experience definitely reminded me of Kitchen Nightmares!!!"}
{"text":"We always come here when family is in town because we have a mixture of vegans and non-vegan family members so Pita Jungle can usually accommodate all our needs. We love the hummus garlic dip, just a bummer when they only give you two pitas to share with 5 people or more. All in all, I am a happy returning customer anytime I am able to make it to the valley."}
{"text":"This was was my first time here. I was really excited to try this place out I have heard so many good things about it. Parking sucks... drove in circles then found a spot. The building itself lookes like it was closed but it was just the shades that made the windows look blackened.  I was seated immediately. The waitress was not much help when I asked a couple questions. So I just went and ordered what I was familiar with a gyro and side greek salad. I did order the cilantro hummus now that was very good. Tasty perfectly creamy and well seasoned. Glad that came out because I was starving. And it took forever to get my lunch. I kinda almost wanted to pay for my hummus and leave.  I couldn't though because as everyone else was getting served my taste buds and stomach told me not to. I kept seeing plate  after plate brought out to my neighbors. I wish my server offered me some of the other things that I was seeing. But oh well. When I received my Pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there. It was actually good. Now I have had gyros at a few places and I just kept thinking is this pita from frozen?  I have seen pita bread that has been frozen and thawed before and it looked exactly like this.  When I have had pita at other places it looks like the Greek dude in the back hand made that sucker. Just wondering.  Oh and another thing is if you are serving hummus please provide enough thawed out pita. I do have to admit the hummus was delicious. My gyro was huge and filling and the price was not bad for it. But this is just another joint for people to say OMG Hey lets hang at the pita jungle and be cool. I think its a nice place to come for a business meeting or meeting of something. And lighting does suck in there."}
{"text":"Pita Jungle is one of my most favorite restaurants. It is consistently good! I have recently ordered delivery through YELP and both times were exceptional. The food always arrives before the estimated arrival time! It's hot, fresh, and the boxes are packed with food!"}
{"text":"I really  like this place. I usually don't like chain restaurants but something about the service here that keeps me coming back. The food is good and I can't complain about the hummus (but come on charging for extra pita is a little lame). But our server was super sweet. I think her name was Rachel. I love that everyone is an individual here. You're never struggling to remember who your server is because everyone is in the same lame tshirt and black pants. The service was quick and the drinks were tasty. I got a Philly cheese steak pita and it was good. My boyfriend got the chicken pita (the garlic paste/sauce is yum)  This place is pretty good. No dinner or lunch specials but good friendly service and a unique environment."}
{"text":"This place was healthy, reasonably-priced & DELICIOUS.  My family was bone-tired after two baseball games in the heat, but we hadn't had a real meal all day, just constant snacking on junk.  We needed something healthy!  Pita Jungle was exactly right for us. I had chicken, black beans, corn & tomatoes and it was so good.  My husband had a mozzarella, tomato & basil salad which was super fresh. The kids meals were the best kids options I've ever seen - no grilled cheese or chix fingers here!  Kids had 4 choices, which covered protein ( hummus & tofu were options along w meat), grains, vegetables & fruit. All three of my kids ate every bite.  Our service was great as well. My only complaint is that we don't have a Pita Jungle in San Diego!"}
{"text":"I am a fan of the greek pizzas with chicken. It's a big serving for one person and nice to share with company. I come here pretty regularly. Service has always been quick and friendly."}
{"text":"In all the years I have been coming to Pita Jungle, I can honestly say that I have never once been let down! Fast, affordable, healthy comfort food... Who knew it could be done!? Pita Jungle is the perfect place for take-out, happy hour, family dinner, and the list just keeps going on. It's one of those restaurants where there is something for everyone, even the pickiest eaters!   Definitely start out with one of their small plates or appetizers. This may be the hardest decision you have to make all day, but rest assured, you can't go wrong with any of them! I typically go with the hummus trio and pita platter.  Also, for someone who is NOT a big salad fan- their Broiled Chicken Salad with house made lemon dressing changed my life. The chicken is seasoned to perfection, and the veggies that accompany it are always so fresh! Oh yeah, and I should probably warn you... Once you try this light, tangy dressing I speak of, you'll be hooked! It is THAT good.  No matter which Pita Jungle location you go to, the vibes may be completely different, but the food is always consistent! This is what makes these restaurants so unique and awesome! After years of great food and service, I don't think I could live somewhere that doesn't have a Pita Jungle nearby!"}
{"text":"The food is great but what makes this place 5 stars is servers like Derek! He is my favorite server of all time! He is so aware of his customers needs & we look forward to seeing him every time we visit."}
{"text":"This is an old review. I have not been there for years. Last time I was there I got food poisoning. Had to go the the emergence room at 11:00 at night. Besides that, we waited 45 mins for food. And the rice was half cooked. Will not go back for the rest of my life"}
{"text":"WONDERFUL Atmosphere!!! Best of all the Pita Jungles. I would definitely come here for a nice dinner (for a casual price). You have to get the Jalapeno Cilantro hummus and try the iced teas. Love this place"}
{"text":"I ventured out to give this location another try last night, and they've definitively stepped up their game. Executing dishes much more like normal pita standards- Juicy chicken, decent portions, fresh salad and veg, overall much more consistent. Keep it up, 7th St Pita."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. It's the best location in the east valley. The staff is great. They food is beyond amazing. My favorite dish is the seared ahi tuna salad. The vinaigrette is the best thing ever. Everything on the menu is excellent, except the nachos. Save your nachos for a Mexican place. Pitas, hummus, salads, burgers, are all fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"I love this place! Great food, good prices, and they have the best happy hour! During happy hour, you can easily fill up on a variety of tapas that are all only a few bucks each! I've honestly never had a bad experience here!"}
{"text":"6/5/15  Happy hour?  More like a peaceful hour at Pita Jungle on a Friday afternoon, but it's definitely more what I like, which is to enjoy food in peace.  No guys banging on the counter with their beer glasses, thank you very much!  Enjoyed a nice chit-chat with bartender Matt as I drank half a glass of the house cabernet and picked through the five $2 happy hour tapas plates (olives, feta, lemon chicken, hummus trio, and falafel), plus a side of caramelized cauliflower, I ordered that day.  Not a bad way to spend $10 on five tapas plates, although I probably wouldn't order the chicken, or the hummus trio again.  Surprise winner were the olives and feta combo-- they went well together, with the tang of the feta mellowing out the saltiness of the olives.  Nice to nibble on while having a glass of wine!  The cauliflower was a little of a letdown for me, as the tahini sauce that came with it wasn't enough, although the manager personally-delivered a nice bowl of freshly-made sauce on short order.  I was very impressed... thank you!  :)  The flavors weren't fully-expressed in that dish that afternoon, but after a couple of days marinating in the fridge, the florets I ate today at 3 am were d'lish!  This PJ location is small, yet intimate, with a nice semi-enclosed patio seating surrounded by a parking lot.  I hear lunch time here can get hectic!  UPDATE 6/10/15 The lemon chicken is actually quite tasty when it isn't being compared to all the other bites I had for hh.  Just finished the last of the leftovers with a little bit of pita a couple of minutes ago.  I even added a kalamata olive and a tiny chunk of feta into the mix- delicious!  May have to order the chicken again for hh another time.  Going to upgrade the rating to a four, since service was attentive and the leftover food still tasted great three days later!"}
{"text":"I've been eating here for years since moving to AZ in '03, although it's been at least a year since I've visited this PJ location.  The hummus served here is one of the three best I've tried in the area (the other two were Sabuddy's (RIP) and Persian Room (nothing close to the first two, though).  It's been awhile since I had hummus (*allergy), but I seem to recall liking Persian Garden's, as well.  But I digress...  Tried the smoked salmon wrap, and the mussels (a seafood special).  Also liked the hummus w/ chicken, w/c came with a couple of tomato wedges.  Would've liked a bit more!  Didn't like how they charge for extra pitas.  Curried chicken and potato lavosh is pretty tasty!  Liked their black bean burger, but it's been so long since I tried it that I cannot comment on whether it's house-made, or just a frozen patty from a major distributor.  All I can say that it was muy delicioso!  Spanakopita app was good, but portions were small.  Ooh, try the red bell pepper hummus... delicious!!  If you don't mind spicy, the jalapeno hummus isn't bad.    Desserts tend to be good, too.  Tried a raspberry cheesecake that was particularly flavorful and silky-smooth, and the vegan carob peanut butter shake (made w/ frozen yogurt), w/c, at the time, was only available at the Tempe location, was a treat on many levels!  I inquired if Chandler's were vegan, as well, but they're not (chocolate syrup), so I didn't try.  Jazz on Thursdays was cool, but the belly dancer I saw on a Saturday was very much a beginner...  She seemed very nervous.  I hope she continued with it and is now enjoying success."}
{"text":"06/16/11  2.5 stars.  Was hungry and decided to try the new addition (a few months, anyway) to Scottsdale's Fashion Square's food court.  Decided to see if the hummus http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pita-jungle-scottsdale-2?select=AxUkQfJnvEHNTadsybTnsw#AxUkQfJnvEHNTadsybTnsw was just as tasty as the ones at the restaurants across the valley.  Decided to round the meal with a salad, as well.  The presentation of the food wasn't very appetizing...** The prices of what you pay for here are about the same you'd pay at the stand-alone restaurants, so i'd suggest just dining at the restaurants to get the added ambience, rather than sit at the food court using styrofoam plates and plastic boxes and utensils.***  Atmosphere would be more relaxed, as well.  However, if looking for healthier options at Scottsdale Fashion Square's courtyard, then Pita Jungle is one of the very few.  **I tend not to return to places that use styrofoam cups and plates.  Sorry, but it's my way to help reduce the amounts of styrofoam that enter landfills.  ***Note to PJ: Please consider sourcing paper plates and biodegradeable utensils, instead.  Most people in your target demographic won't mind paying slightly higher prices for the switch!"}
{"text":"Classy, Organic, Healthy, delicous. Everything is supeb, and this is reflected in the HIGH prices. Great place to go if you have 40 dollars each for dinner. Best Organic restaurant I have ever been to! Highly recomend the fire grilled salmon, the palmagranite Lemonade, the Tapas, the Hummus, the salads. EVERYTHING IS GREAT"}
{"text":"Pretty good! I went here with my grandparents and as soon as we walked in we were seated, then the waitress got our drink order as soon as she seated us which, in my opinion is great. One semi negative part is that it was kinda noisey in there. It was clean and had a very Urban vibe. The food got to our table and was almost too hot, but it was very good. Also there was construction nearby. Overall:4.5 Service:4.5 Food:4 Area:5 Atmosphere:3.5 Price:3.5"}
{"text":"Great vegetarian options. Plenty of big booths and wood tables. Ok for kids- they have wood high chairs and a changing table in the bathroom & a patio.  I ordered the lentil soup & hummus with tabbouleh. Mom ordered the gazpacho. Baby gnawed on pita bread. Everyone was happy."}
{"text":"I LOVE PITA JUNGLE! I don't care if it is a chain...!! I almost always get the chicken schwarma pita or the salad version! Definitely love the hummus! All of their flavors are delicious! It's also reasonably priced for the amount of food you get! Definitely a favorite lunch and dinner spot!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in the valley. I usually go for the turkey wrap or one of their pizzas. On this day we went for happy hour, which is daily after 9pm and tried several tapas and a 4 peaks beer. Everything was really good."}
{"text":"okay night out. our server haley was a bit slow with our drinks and we were rushed to get to a movie and it didn't really seem like she rushed on getting our check to us. she told us the pizza my wife ordered was not too spicy and in reality it was super spicy. i've heard such great things about this place and was only mildy impressed."}
{"text":"I came into Pita Jungle for my mothers birthday and we all shared the blue corn nachos they are HUGE! I recommend adding chicken to the nachos SOO delicious. I'm a pretty easy eater and was debating between the spicy mango shrimp or the chicken avocado tostada. Our server was very helpful and said the spicy mango shrimp was the way to go and she was not wrong! Amazing!!!! Great service, great food!   We'll be back for Mother's day :)"}
{"text":"I had a poor experience a couple months ago and I went in with hesitation. Robin was awesome and had a great personality. She changed my views on this pita. Thanks Robin! Great customer service all the way around to make up for 1 poor visit."}
{"text":"Okay, since going to Pita Jungle the first time off of Tay Road near Ahwatukee... I had the chance to go back as the manager was nice enough to reach out and offer to give me another try.   I did go back but this time I went to the location out in Gilbert, I will say this, I got the California wrap and it was awesome it had great flow an awesome filling with the chicken olives and veggies and side salad, I was ready to jump to my pic and update my review in an instant.   The same weekend I went back to the Pita Jungle on Ray road and my opinion again Hit rock bottom.  We ordered the exact same dishes and the food was missing ingredients that were not in the wrap we had had at the Gilbert location.  Not only my food but my guests food as well was no where near what we had from the other Pita Jungle.   I don't know what it was or why but I know there are some Pita Jungles I will visit and others I will pass by.   Hence the three stars for this particular locations."}
{"text":"Always love Pita Jungle. This was the first time we ordered to go, it was still fresh but ready to go when we arrived. My son loves the kids meal, and it's always huge portions! I got the Mediterranean platter. I really suggest it to those who can decide on what they want and it's more than enough for 2 people to share!!"}
{"text":"So I am reviewing this place in hope that the business reads this and improves because they have delicious food and a lot of potential. The location is great it is very cool and inviting inside and overlooks a lake so thats always nice. They have a cool looking bar and interesting artwork. I tried 3 different plates so far and all were delicious they tasted fresh and were very flavorful. The only thing i recommend is not having their \"teas\". These are just water with some food coloring and absolutely no flavor!! (Very disappointing). The only reason this place is getting three stars is because the service was pretty bad. No one ever greets you here they just kind of look at you like they wish you were not there and then seat you like they are doing you a huge favor.  On my recent visit our server was very uninterested in serving. She seemed irritated when we were not ready to order and then retaliated by ignoring us for the next ten minutes or so. She kept walking by us and pretending not to see us so I finally called out to her and she just put her hand up and said \"give me a couple minutes!\" I do my very best not to piss off people who are handling my food so I just waited. She never apologized for taking so long and did not check up on us except to refill my nasty tea which she spilled and did not clean up :o  I think I might go again because the food is so good but it would be really great if I were welcomed by a friendly staff and treated as a customer not as though I'm asking for favors. Please train your staff to be polite and friendly or just get rid of the bad seeds and this restaurant will do so much better"}
{"text":"Pita Jungle used to be the spot, it was fresh on the scene and a great change of pace.  Something completely different and possibly good for you. It was always the place you could bring a date to or even for a business lunch.  It said \"Hey only fatties go to The Olive Garden. I am a sophisticate.  See my fine lady?  See where I have taken you?  This place is as original and hip as I am.\".   Now something has happened. Pita Jungle still has the hip artwork, the ultra-hip non-conformist waitstaff, the great music, the semi-eclectic food, and the possibility of a really good experience. For some strange reason, it just has lost a lot of it's cool. Oh wait, I know. Maybe it is the herd of Douchtards (Douchetards, a Yelper Favorite.) that are compelled to take their little kids out to dinner at a place that is kid unfriendly and lacks a Chernobyl sized rat as a mascot.  This place is so kid unfriendly that there is a lake within drowning distance.  But does that stop the breeders from turning loose their  herd in the restaurant?  Nope. \"Run free children. I will know you are safe because I will always be within ear shot of your constant screaming.\"  (I shudder.). This was not an anomaly either. There were three different families there with three kids each.  Wa-Wa-What?  I don't bring my dates to Chuckie Cheese, so keep your rats out of Pita Jungle. Alright maybe I am being harsh, but if your kids cannot act like respectable human beings, maybe they are not ready for a respectable restaurant.  And another thing,  I love the Grilled Vegetable Salad.  It is my favorite thing on the menu.  But alas, out of the last four times I have ordered it, only once has it lived up to it's delicious memory.  Maybe I should try something else, but when I know how perfect something can be it is hard for me to give up hope so easily.  So to recap: My favorite dish has been ruined. Kids have made a playground of it. Hipness has become tragically un-hip."}
{"text":"Love, Love Pita Jungle! I was first turned on by them from a client- Christina. She told me about her experience at the downtown location that usually would scare me off. She said she ordered her hummus for an appetizer and the pesto pizza for lunch. Some time later she asked the server if her lunch was coming and the server realized she forgot her order. The server got it for her to go. Christina continued on to tell me that next time she goes, she give herself more time in case they forget again.  (????) Wow, I figured I had to try this place....The Hummus and pesto pizza are my Favorites.  Their charming crew is always friendly and on the ball...Service is always Top notch even when its busy!"}
{"text":"Management handled my problem the way all management should handle any restaurant problem. They were quick to respond and it was very clear they want everyone to be happy. Thank you for redeeming yourself on this and I appreciate the extra time you took to email me a few times and learn what happened.  Other Pita Jungles and all restaurants should take note on handling these kinds of situations. Thank you!"}
{"text":"The food is always great! The atmosphere is the bomb! Mariya is always so accommodating and knowledgable about EVERYTHING on the menu, and a beacon of sunshine to all of her customers!"}
{"text":"Time to update my review and bump up my rating because frankly, they deserved it.  I'm quite fond of Pita Jungle as a franchise. I've never ordered a bad meal here and staff have always been cheery. The reason for the bump in the rating? The tapas special during the happy hour. You can order small portion plates from $1 to $2. You can get Mozzarella & Tomato plates to Hummus and tiny slices of Pizzas. Seriously, It's cheaper than chips!  What's not to love?    ."}
{"text":"I've had pretty good experience here and I've been to the other locations also.The dishes, the service and atmosphere seems to be consistent. The place is always clean and the walls are decorated with art by local artists. My favorites in the menu are the the falafel platter, lentil fattoush salad, grilled portabello mushroom burger and pepper hummus.  The veggie wraps and lavosh pizza are also good choices plus the portions are huge! I'm so glad they are opening a new location in downtown phoenix. (Next to Lola's Coffee house)  It's refreshing to have a healthy restaurant within walking distance to my humble abode. :)"}
{"text":"Ridiculously priced rabbit food, and rude waitresses. I was very disappointed because I heard good things about this place. Went once, and have never been back after my bad experience."}
{"text":"Enjoyed lunch on this busy day before Thanksgiving. Excellent and attentive service. Green tea was delicious. All of us enjoyed the chicken or turkey (your choice)pesto lavosh wrap with a Greek side salad. We will be back. The restaurant was busy. We could still carry on a conversation. The acoustics were great. Our server was attentive getting us drinks to go. We will be back."}
{"text":"An angel from heaven was sent to earth to open a restaurant named Pita Jungle.  Amazing Grace, how sweet the [ lental salad ], That saved a wretch like me.... I once was lost but now am found, Was blind, but now, I see.  Blasphemy?  You can't judge me!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch. Friendly and efficient staff. I had the chicken curry salad and a glass of wine - Awesome! They have an early and late happy hour. I'll definitely check it out."}
{"text":"First time to Pita Jungle with a group of 5 during mid-afternoon. There were only a few others there. The food was very tasty and the staff were pleasant. However, it literally took 30 minutes to get our food. Seriously?!?! Even the waitress was getting on the cooks about the slow service."}
{"text":"Having my favorite \"wood fired chicken\"  for my birthday lunch! Also my favorite tea, strawberry kiwi green tea. Great service from great employees and management. Fast & friendly."}
{"text":"This was the second Pita Jungle I've been to, but it is also the one I've visited most frequently since I used to live nearby. It always seems busy, but it doesn't get too loud inside. The service has always been great, and they always get us in quickly no matter how busy they are. I like the openness of the dining area, and the vibe is always nice. The food is always great, too! We've never had any problems here at all, and were always satisfied with our experiences at this Pita Jungle location :) Oh, and this was the location where I first tried PJ's Spanakopita... it is quite delicious! It almost reminded me of being back in Greece!"}
{"text":"I believe this is the first Pita Jungle I ever went to. A friend took us there after an event out in Mesa, and told us how good it was. If I had just visited this location and no other PJ restaurants, I would probably give this one at least 4 stars. However, after visiting at 2 other locations since then, I'd say that this Mesa PJ wasn't the best.  Our waitress was very nice. We ordered a Pita Pizza, with Glazed-Chicken Lavosh Pizza I believe. While ordering, our friend started a huge conversation with the waitress about how evil onions are, and how we would not like onions on our pizza at all. The waitress decided to join our impromptu anti-onion club and everything! However, once the pizza came... there were tons of onions all over. We don't have anything against onions, but our friend hates them. They took the pizza back and made us a new one, but we were a bit disappointed with the entire situation.   The rest of the food was good, although I don't really remember what we ordered. The pizza, once cooked to our specifications, was quite delicious! Overall, not a bad experience, but when compared to other locations I am now a bit disappointed."}
{"text":"Been back a few times since, and have had nothing but great experiences. Our last visit was awesome because it was later on Saturday night and wasn't very busy at all. Our waiter was really... chill? Lol! I don't really know what adjective to use for him. He was really quiet and reserved, but he was also one of the best waiters ever. Tons of refills, he was there when we needed him, and there was no forced small talk or unnecessary words. It's like he could see into our souls. Almost like he knew us better than we knew ourselves :O  I have no idea what his name was but yeah, he was pretty awesome. The passion fruit iced tea was pretty good, and he even offered iced teas to go before we even thought of asking for any. Yeah, I pretty much peed a lot that night... way too much tea! (If there is such a thing!)  That last experience really prompted me to bring this up to a 5 star rating. I love Pita Jungle, but other locations usually annoy me a bit. This one is just too awesome :)"}
{"text":"Took me awhile to try Pita jungle and I'm sooo glad I did!! The Antipasti platter is to die for , so huge you definitely have to share! The fruit & cheese appetizer is huge!! And so fresh !! Can't wait to try other items"}
{"text":"I love Pita Jungle.  Every time I go here, it's always so tasty.  I have tried only a handful of items but the go-to item is the Hummus with Seared Ahi but I have to have it with Cilantro Jalapeno Hummus.  If the wife wants to split it, we also order a Greek Salad.  Other items I have tried have been the super flavorful Spanakopita and the super cheesy Spinach Four Cheese Quesadilla.  If you like garlic, try the garlic dip and the Tzatziki is alright.  The kids love the cheese crisp and the different flavors of tea and lemonade.  The sad part of this is I haven't tried the other items but I cannot fathom going there without ordering the seared ahi.  The restaurant is clean and always packed.  Service is always awesome and the food is top notch.  Prices are decent and just knowing that we are eating a little healthier than normal is a bonus.  Do yourself a favor, go to PJ!!!  Doesn't matter the location, they are all great."}
{"text":"Staff is great, interior is awesome & food is consistent. Thank god they placed a bomb pita jungle here. Bartender w/ dreads is super rad too!"}
{"text":"I was excited to try Pita Jungle since I was new to the area just moved here. And very disappointed with my food and with what happened. I ordered a glass of red wine and started sipping on this wine while I was eating my very over Sultan gyro when I noticed that there was something all over the inside of the wine glass after I'd already drank a quarter of it. So disgusting my stomach has been upset ever since. Unfortunately I will not go back to this restaurant first time and the food was bad and the wine glass was dirty and no thank you. I have eaten at the Pita Jungle at Happy Valley and was pleasantly surprised by the food but this one obviously needs help. I've eaten Gyros many times and never had one this city before."}
{"text":"I love pita jungle but man-this location has rude and horrible service. We sat for 10 minutes before a waiter came by and 20 to get our check! We got fed up with waiting and walked inside to get a To-go box where the lady at the front said \"walk to the back and you can get it yourself\"  Are you serious??  At least the food was good...."}
{"text":"As someone who doesn't like to eat red meat, I usually get stuck with pasta or a salad when I go out to lunch or dinner.  Pita Jungle is great for vegetarians or anyone who wants to eat cleaner. There's tons of different options that are all delicious.  Every time I go I try something new, and I have yet to be disappointed.  A great place to go with friends for a great meal!"}
{"text":"First time here, was very pleased.  Very good pitas and gyros, cool location downtown as well."}
{"text":"Looking for a place to eat in the area? Look no further, Pita Jungle has many options to choose from. Every meal I've had is full of flavor and not to mention very inexpensive. The service is great. The servers remind me of the kids working at Dutch Brothers."}
{"text":"Great food, though I haven't tried much yet. I stick with the basics - hummus and pita."}
{"text":"To be honest, I never had any entr√©e's at Pita Jungle because I always end up getting the Hummus Trio with grilled chicken - ultimate combination. The grilled chicken is very tender and nicely seasoned, and the hummus is simply great - in fact you could just get the hummus with pita bread and be happy. The Hummus plate comes in three varieties - traditional, cilantro and bell-pepper - and all three are great - I personally like the cilantro. Some of my colleagues tried their other entr√©e's and they were not disappointed. All in all, Pita Jungle has a nice atmosphere, a decent bar and good food. Can't go wrong with this place."}
{"text":"Love It!  Great food, friendly servers, funky atmosphere, reasonable prices.  How could you not dig it?"}
{"text":"I'm not crazy about this place, and I probably wouldn't return if they didn't have the city's best rice pudding and hummus here. The seating is a little jarring and completely impossible to navigate in a rush. The service is annoying at best, and though prompt, the server's attitude should never be directed by their challenging hairstyle, accessories, etc.   You're edgy.   We get it.   Oh, and parking is a real son of a bitch. I would suggest parking by walgreen's, unless you really enjoy being gridlocked."}
{"text":"I honestly love Pita Jungle. We dine at one at least once every other week but at a location by our house mostly.       Our 10 year old grandson decided he wanted to have lunch here and we couldn't argue.      We went simple with 2 pizzas for my wife and I. They make theirs on Lahvosh bread making nice and thin. It makes for a great pizza with out all the bad calories from the dough. The toppings can't be picked normally but the combinations are outstanding. They might leaving something off you.      We also went with the the Watermelon smoothies. So refreshing.      Our grandson had a Pita with melted cheese. It disappeared like the wind and a second one was need and out to us in less than 5 minutes.      This location is wonderful. The decor is some of their best.       The staff was kind, friendly and competent. As in every Pita Jungle, you can't go wrong eating here.      I was also thrilled to see sound deadening panels hanging and on the walls and from above. It took me 3 weeks to convince the Southern Ave. location to put some up after their opening. The conversational noise was deafening.      I'll be back here when we want a change of Pita Jungle staff."}
{"text":"Best prices, healthy food, awesome happy hours...get the tapas!!!! Watch sports games and expect quality control in their food...place is great!"}
{"text":"gross if you're used to eating authentic Mediterranean food-the kind with flavorful meat and chickens, and fresh pita bread ... cheese wasnt melted-- and bread was still cold right out the bag- seemed rushed. wont have again"}
{"text":"I order out from this location on a regular basis and it never disappoints. The food is always fresh and prepped quickly. Also, if you're looking for a great HH spot, this is definitely a great spot for tapas and good beer. I do wish they had a wider selection of beers, but hey, I'll still come here on a regular basis."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in the Phoenix area! I've never had a bad meal here, the prices are very reasonable and the service is always great at all of the locations. Some of my favorite dishes are:  Hummus (get the trio so you can try all three!) Hummus with grilled chicken Broiled chicken salad Quinoa and cilantro jalapeno salad (on the specials) Chicken shawarma pita Philly steak/chicken pita Chipotle chicken lavosh pizza  They also have a great happy hour Monday thru Friday from 3-6pm. I would highly recommend this place for lunch, dinner, happy hour...whatever suits you!"}
{"text":"Really good food!  My friend and I shared an artichoke, bow tie pasta salad with other vegetables and aromatics in it, and a breast of chicken with spinach, tomatoes cooked with garlic, served over a pile of mashed potatoes.  Large portions, satisfactory service (would give it five stars if it was better), excellent baklava.  If I lived close to a Pita Jungle, I'd go back again and again."}
{"text":"Well my family and I decided to give this particular Pita Jungle a try again. I have to say that I am glad that we did. We actually had a wonderful experience!  It seemed like the staff was different this time which was nice because they were way more attentive. Our waitress Robyn was a doll. Super sweet and friendly and did a fantastic job with making sure we were taken care of. She always made sure our glasses were always full. Lona, the MOD was also great. She was very pleasant to talk with and funny!  The food was delicious! I tried one of their specials, the buccaneer chicken wrap and it was sooo good!!! I highly recommend! And the fruit and cheese plate is insane!! So huge and fresh! We all loved our meals.   Thank you for a great experience Robyn and Lona. We will be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"If I had to eat at the same restaurant every day, I would choose Pita Jungle.  I could have their babaghannoush and lavosh chicken shwarma day in and day out! Seriously I am never let down by their food and quality of the food as well.  After living overseas in the Middle East, I had looked everywhere to find that authentic flavor of hummus & baba; and I found it (to my surprise) at Pita Jungle! I will always come back here, and it just always \"sounds good.\""}
{"text":"Last night was my third time dining here, and it has never disappointed.    The servings were huge, hot, and absolutely delicious!  Our server, Brandon, was cool, calm, collected, and efficient, despite the fact that we were a group of more than 20!!!"}
{"text":"I love Pita Jungle!   The food is amazing-- for something spicy check out Chicken Del Sol or jalapeno cilantro hummus. My favorite is the Chicken pasta salad. It's served cold with a vinaigrette dressing and hot grilled chicken- absolutely delicious! I also love their greek and grilled vegetable salads. The food is fresh and according to the nutritional facts on their website, healthy. I never have regret about eating everything on my plate at Pita Jungle.  As locations go, this is one of the better Pita Jungle's. Parking seems to plague every location and this PJ is no exception. During the week it's always difficult to find a place to park but you get lucky later in the evening or on weekends. It's kind of tucked away between office buildings just north of the 101 on Tatum, but this location seems to be one of the bigger Pita Jungle's. They have a huge outdoor patio complete with heaters for winter and misters for summer.    Happy hour and reverse happy hour offer great deals, but they are small portions (hey for $1 order a couple). Otherwise the price is good for what you get."}
{"text":"I'm pretty obsessed with Pita Jungle. I've never had a single bad thing on the menu. In addition to good food that offers healthy and vegan offerings, their happy hour is awesome with small portions and cheap prices on food and drinks. The staff has always been friendly to me here- although can be a bit frazzled during lunch hour. I love the patio too!  A couple of tips:  - the Lavosh Chicken Schwarma, Chicken Pasta Salad, and Chicken del Sol are my go-to favorites. Add a little sriracha to the Lavosh Chicken Schwarma for a spicy kick!  - if you're planning to go during weekday lunch, go between 11-11:30 a.m. After 11:45 a.m. it's a mad house. - there's no getting around it: the parking sucks here. There are only a few spots available next to restaurant and in the parking garage before you have to find street parking. Carpool whenever possible."}
{"text":"Love Pita Jungle, especially this location! As long as its not too hot out, the patio is perfect for a healthier and delicious lunch or dinner. I always get one of the Philly pitas either chicken or steak with the garlic smashed potatoes. It's always delicious!"}
{"text":"I had the third best falafel of my life here... and that's saying a lot. Falafel is one of the staples of my diet when traveling on the road, and I've had so much variety that I've become quite picky about what I like. My buddy Shane from Mastodon Body Piercing brought me here when I was in town, and I was thoroughly impressed. The waiter was attentive despite the restaurant being packed, the food was scrumptious, and it wasn't outrageously priced. The decor was inviting. I look forward to eating here again in the future."}
{"text":"I HEART Pita Jungle so so much! Happy Hour is great! Hummus with chicken is fab! Chicken Shawarma is great- flavorful and filling! I've never had a bad meal here!!"}
{"text":"Always solid food. Fresh and made to order. I love the jalapeno cilantro hummus.  The best part of this restaurant is they will work with you if you have any diet restrictions."}
{"text":"great hummus jalepeno cilantro!! amazing!!!  great sandwiches!!! flavors are so fresh are great!!!  downside is very small dining room you are pretty much eating dinner with everyone else.    this means that your conversation is my conversation!!"}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE! Second time at Pita Jungle, first time at this location. The food is tasty, fresh, & inexpensive. The cilantro jalape√±o hummus is AMAZING! Get it with the pita chips! Yummy! I wish they had a PJ in Florida."}
{"text":"This is the 3rd location I've tried out. Pita Jungle does NOT disappoint! Everything about their food is consistent. The staff is friendly. I wish we had these restaurants in Florida. FIVE STARS!"}
{"text":"Just had the best Mediterranean salad ever at Pita Jungle Desert Ridge. All fresh ingredients and beautifully displayed. Our server,Jen Allen, was awesome. warm, friendly and efficient all at the same time. We will definitely be return customers"}
{"text":"Great service! My server gave me recommendations and they were delicious. I had the strawberry kiwi green tea and blue corn nachos.   The only change I would make is the dipping sauce is served in the same container as the Pico which blended awkwardly. I suggest you ask for the sauces to be served separately."}
{"text":"This is a perfect lunch spot. Prices are great, food is excellent and it's  healthy. Pita Jungle was a regular lunch spot for me when I was working in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I love everything about this place. The Mediterranean Chicken Salad and Artichoke Pasta Salad are Amazing. What makes this restaurant stand out for me is the Tapas Happy Hour specials. The first place I've found since moving out here that truly understands what tapas are all about; cheap plates of finger foods -olives, cheese, hummus, croquettes- that are meant to be shared. I've seen far too many \"tapas\" restaurants that charge $8 a plate and lose sight of the entire purpose of sharing food and mingling with friends."}
{"text":"This place is great in ambiance and food.  The outdoor patio adds a huge plus on those nice nights when it's not 110 outside!!  My favorite is the Putanesca..oh so rich in flavor and so good."}
{"text":"I love pita jungle!  But this location was such a disappointment.    First, it's located in a very busy shopping center, so good luck finding a parking spot. It took me a good 15 minutes of driving around. Not exaggerating.   Next, I was sat right away. Awsome! But it took 8 minutes to be acknowledged  by someone. Normally I wouldn't  really care,  but I was super hungry and pregnant, so it bothered me.   She finally comes back five minutes later with my water, but my the starter I ordered ended coming out with our entrees, which was a good 30 additional  minutes later.   My server already hade two other tables, and then got sat with us and another couple at once. She was nice, hence the two stars, but management should think about having the place better staffed to accommodate guest."}
{"text":"Not sure how to even start this review off because I'm so disappointed. I've been to this location 3 times. The first was memorable because our waiter not once checked on us to make sure we were doing okay, and we had to catch his attention when we were ready for our check. The second time was decent, but our waitress only checked on us once. The last time, today, is very memorable. I ordered some food online to pick up for a friend and myself. I walked into the door and waited next to the hostess area for 6 minutes (I timed it actually). Finally, a man came up to me and asks, \"can I help you with something?\". Okay. Yes I was there for a pick up but he didn't even ask if I wanted to be seated. I tell him, \"I'm here to pick up an order I placed online\", and he goes, \"oh go over to Lindsey she's in charge of to-go\"... Doesn't even point this woman out or anything, so I guess I was just supposed to automatically know who Lindsey was. I go up to a woman behind the cash register, hoping this is the woman I need to speak to. She hands me my food and she was the only pleasant person I encountered there. So I go to meet up with my friend and we sit down to eat the food. I ordered the spinach and cheese quesadilla, which I've had before. I take a few bites and it's decent. I go to take another bite and bite down on something extremely hard. The pain I felt was excruciating, so I had to spit out the bite to see what was so hard. I look to see what it was and find a small, metallic pebble type thing. I made sure it wasn't maybe a piece of a pit or anything, but this object shined like metal. I went to feel my tooth to make sure what exactly happened, only to find that my filling had been completely destroyed. Unfortunately I didn't keep the metallic pebble because I just wanted to get rid of the food as soon as possible, so I threw it away, which I now regret because I wish I would've kept it so I could've brought it back and shown them what I found in my food. Will never be returning to this location, and am still debating whether I'll be eating at Pita Jungle again, simply because of the experiences I've had. My family owns a restaurant and I even went to culinary school, so I know the proper etiquette and health standards, and I believe this location isn't passing either of them."}
{"text":"The food was good but the service was slooooow on a slow Thurs night(literally only 7 tables w/ guests). We sat and waited almost 10min to be offered a drink & ended having to ask the bartender for a to go box b/c the server was no where to be found. Server was sweet but I've have much better service at other locations."}
{"text":"First time here and I had a great experience with Ana at the bar. Ordered the trio of Hummas with sliced cucumbers and bell peppers as well as some fire roasted chicken with veggies. Everything tasted fresh and delicious. Also had a mango mixed drink that was fantastic!! Service was amazing, food was amazing and I have already started spreading the word to come check this place out! A big THANK YOU to Ana for making my experience unforgettable!!"}
{"text":"This is one of my first reviews after years of reading others, and I'm happy to say Pita Jungle was a great place to review!!  This menu was very unique even for a Mediterranean restaurant.  One of the suggestions to order was the Carmaelized Cauliflower with Tahin, it was THE BEST VEGETABLE I have ever tasted.  The food was all very flavorful as well as being very fresh tasting.  The service needed a little help as it took 5 minutes to get our forks to enjoy our amazing vegetable!!!  Thumbs up Pita Jungle!i"}
{"text":"This place is a huge hit whenever we take people here. Lots of options. Good kids menu. Good happy hour. My husband loves this place. Potatoes & saut√©ed broccoli are yummy."}
{"text":"Very bad experience.  Ordered spicy chicken wrap and it was so soggy that it just fell apart. I feel bad wasting food but this was not what I imagined at all. There was barely any chicken in this \"wrap\" and I found a piece of hair at the bottom :( The location is right by my school and I would have been regular but after this experience I will not be back. If you are looking for Mediterranean cusine I would not go here :("}
{"text":"Pita Jungle downtown Phoenix. What a cool place....exposed ceiling and brickwork, attentive young wait staff. This eatery would not be out of place downtown anywhere. Baba Ganoush to die for...roasted for ages for deep smokey flavor. Hummus good, grilled chicken breast a little dry but tasty. Also has salads, wood-fired pizzas and more. Corner of 3rd St and Roosevelt in downtown Phoenix. Bar area looks like a nice place to hang out too. I havent been to any other Pita Jungle so this is reviewed without comparing it to the others."}
{"text":"I stopped in on a Friday afternoon to grab a to-go lunch. The ambience was casual but there is an energy. Great outdoor seating options but don't be sad if you have to take an indoor table either. This staff couldn't have been friendlier or more accommodating. My food was served quickly and everything was delicious. We got chicken shawarma bowl on organic brown rice. The falafel side was good. Garlic potatoes...probably wouldn't get them again. They were seasoned great but chopped with no uniformity so the bigger chunks were barely cooked through. Kiwi-green tea is fantastic. I'll definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"My wife has been wanting to bring me here to check it out so we did today. She usually goes to the one in Chandler but she thought we'would check this one out instead as it was closer.   The ambiance of the place left a bit to be desired in my opinion. It didn't seem to have any central theme. Seriously, what's with the metal bull and matador in the men's room...hmmm. Anyhow, there are no booths which I hate - except a couple of half booth tables that were already taken. The music was too soft & low so you can hear people's conversations around you. So yea, I got a couple of eye ball daggers thrown at me. Some woman let her 2 kids run around the dining room like it was Chucky Cheese.   Food was actually rather good, even though it was difficult for me to come up with a good selection with the diet I'm on. We had an appetizer of humus that was artfully displayed on the plate with a dichotomous split  down the middle with jalape√±o cilantro humus on one side and red pepper humus on the other. My wife had the pita bread with it and ordered me some cucumber chips to dip - awesome stuff. You guys have that jalape√±o cilantro humus nailed.   My wife had a Caribbean salad which looked like it was plucked fresh off the Chiquita Banana Ladies hat. Good looking artfully designed plate. She liked it.   I had a grilled chicken salad and asked for feta cheese on top. Salad looked great but our Patrick Dempsey looking server bolted before I could ask him for additional dressing. I forget that places like this literally spritz a single mist of vinaigrette on the salad in fear of offending Suzy slender bones that she's fat.  Server McDempsey was no where to be found as I waited and waited painstakingly eating the dry salad. He got there eventually and I asked him for the dressing and he said, \"Sure man.\" Then he went to the busser station and talked with someone, got a drink, rang an order, bussed some plates, and then got my dressing - dude Dempsey WTF.   The place left a bit to be desired but the food was good. In my opinion you need good food, ambient atmosphere, and efficient service - 1 out of 3 in these economic times ain't bringing me back in.  Moreover, the management staff needs to have a refresher course in hygiene with its employees. Now I'm no clean freak what-so-ever, Christ I used to drink out of the friggin' garden hose when I was a kid - ah who am I kidden, I still do.  Anyhow, I'm looking over at a table with a woman who just sneezed all over the top of her drink - allergies I guess. Well she gets up and leaves and the petite bus girl comes up and bussed the tables and sticks her fingers inside of three glasses in order to carry them away to the bus station. She comes out with a clean rag to wipe the table and fresh silverware roll ups in the soiled hand - nice... Even worse I'm watching server McDempsey talk to another guy employee while he's running his fingers through his gelled hair, scratching his scalp and then rubs his nose with his thumb and index finger. He then goes and serves plates of food to the people next to us. Only good thing - the customer was the frigid woman who shot me the stink eye earlier. Here's to hair gel in your pita lady."}

{"text":"Amazing food, good atmosphere, very reasonably priced. Everything in the area here is on the Desert Ridge price plan, so it's nice to see a place that doesn't try and take advantage of it's customers. Ask for Ricky. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Awesome food! Awesome service! Only gripe I have is that the bar needs barstools w backs. The metal stools are horrible!!!! Overall super mucho good!!!! And a few TV's at the bar or outside as well."}
{"text":"Fairly busy on a Friday afternoon. Its quite large inside and they have a nice outdoor seating area as well. We tried the coconut curry soup (GREAT), chicken chipotle pizza (GREAT), Carmelized cauliflower w/ tahini (Amazing!) service was great and staff friendly. With a beer & late, our bill was under $38! What a deal! If your hungry and in the area, definitely check this spot out. They have items that I've never heard of or seen before and I've eaten out quite a bit across the county! A+"}
{"text":"Been to this location and the Scottsdale location many times. Great happy hour. Only problem, when at dinner one night my friend found a black bug in her water. Let the server know and she didn't act shocked at all. Makes me wonder why."}
{"text":"Best chicken and hummus Love the Arnold palmers  They know how to cook their chicken Favorites include: chicken and hummus, medchiladia, wood-fired salmon salad, glazed-chicken pizza, pesto pizza, spicy chicken pita (ask for it in a bowl instead), Greek salad, lentil soup, turkey pesto lavosh wrap ( substitute chicken instead of turkey), and grilled vegetable salad.  Tempe location has a great breakfast too."}
{"text":"Cute little place near ASU. Came here with a friend and we were super hungry so I'm glad that the portions are large. I ordered the mediterranean roasted chicken pita and it was SO good! The chicken was juicy and perfectly seasoned. I had to take out a few chunks of chicken because it was just too much food. The pickles added a great flavor. Not sure where their pickles come from but give me a jar! I wish the pita had more tahini sauce and less red onion. I wasn't all that impressed with their regular hummus. I thought it had too much garlic. The service was quick and friendly. It was a cool & casual place great for chilling with friends. They also have some cool art on the wall. The only down side is that they have a one stall bathroom but they have a lot of postcards and flyers on a shelf that you can read as you wait. If I lived near here I would definitely come here often!"}
{"text":"I love ALL the Pita Jungles. I have Never had a bad meal at any of the locations. They are very consistent throughout the chain. I usually have the hummus with grilled chicken, the hot pita sandwiches are all amazing and the roasted potatoes side is yummy. The glazed chicken lavish pizza, OMG! So good. Service can be spotty depending on how busy they are but its always worth waiting for."}
{"text":"Great food! I am definitely coming back! But best of all was the service! Jaclyn served us and she was awesome! Tipped her big and I plan to ask for her every time I come in."}
{"text":"If you like Greek food, this is the place to be.  About 2 days out of the week, my family heads to Pita Jungle in Gilbert.  I have been to all the locations in the Phoenix area and the Gilbert location is by far my favorite.  The service is always excellent.  There are several staffers there that have been there for a very long time.  They have more than just your typical restaurant's staff on hand.  Someone is always right there to make sure your food is delivered fresh to your table and if you empty a plate, it won't stay on your table very long.  In the past several years, I have never had an order come out wrong, cold or had to send anything back.  The menu is diverse enough that I can take my Gluten free family and friends and those that want a hearty meal..  It is one of those environments that you can have an intimate dinner or a family dinner.  The decor is ever changing with artwork from local artists.  Their wine selections are excellent and I often find that I come across my new favorites by trying them at Pita.... I highly recommend this restaurant.."}
{"text":"3.5 Service was okay. It was really busy so the server forgot a few things, but she always apologized.   We had ordered hummus with seared ahi tuna. Hummus was okay & the tuna (separately) was okay considering this type of restaurant, but the tuna & hummus was a weird combo. The portion is pretty large. The chipotle black bean burger was the other dish that was ordered, and it was good ($8)."}
{"text":"I love eating here.  Some of the best food anywhere and awesome service as well.  We frequent several of their locations and the food is always consistent along with the service.  Thanks for running a class act resturant.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Had food delivered from here. It was gross and sloppy. The falafel sandwich was breaking apart because the pita was soggy and the mediterranean chicken salad was dry. Not ordering from here again."}
{"text":"the perfect take-out spot between classes. the girls at the bar are always kind and helpful. there are comfy couches to lounge on while you wait for your order. the tuna pita pizza brings so much joy into my life. small enough to eat alone when hunger overcomes me, but i can usually spare a piece if someone else is nearby."}
{"text":"I love this place! They have my favorite salad here. My friend introduced me to their Curry Salad few weeks ago and I was definitely amazed with it. We ordered it with fish and it was very delicious. The salad is a yogurt based with curry, red onions, celery, carrots, golden raisins, red grapes and walnuts. It was placed on a bed of lettuce and brown rice, topped with lemon vinaigrette, pita crumbles, sumac and caramelized onions. Omg! It was in heaven! I also tried their mahi mahi with chips & hummus. The hummus were amazing, it's called cilantro-jalapeno hummus. I will come back for more!"}
{"text":"Oh dear, this one of those fusion restaurants, they want to be authentic Mediterranean but they need to be extra certain they are catering to their demographics. If ya know what i'm sayin'.  Anyways, this place is decent. The only issue I have is that the food is overpriced and really isn't very authentic. This fact combined with the fact that its not a lot of food for your money, aka bad value makes it lose a few points in my book.  The service is good, the staff is very friendly and its worth a visit, who knows you might like it? If you can't make it to Haji Baba in Tempe, or Baiz Market in Phoenix, then I suppose you can check this place out. Don't expect to be wowed too much. I pretty much never crave the food here, and the only reason it might be worth coming here is if you have a party of like 4 or more. Haji Baba and Baiz probably cannot realistically accommodate large parties."}
{"text":"Having been to previous Pita Jungles, I decided to pass on the Mediterranean-inspired items such as the falafel, since I can get better tasting food of this type at say, Haji-Baba or Sahara.   I went here for lunch and tried the fish sandwich (Around $10). It was a nicely cooked, large piece of mahi-mahi with the requisite burger veggies (Tomatoes, lettuce, onions), with aioli. It was served with some garlicky roasted potatoes. The sandwich was pretty good, and was a large portion for lunch. The potatoes were really tasty, but be sure to either chew a lot of gum, eat a lot of mints, or brush your teeth afterwards because that garlic packs a punch on your breath!  Service was decent, and the locale is picturesque since it overlooks the lake. It gets quite busy here at lunch, so coming early will help you get in, eat, and get out in a decent amount of time."}
{"text":"Meh.  Sorry to be a hater, but I've eaten here several times, always expecting the food here to wow me, and I always leave somewhat dissatisfied.  I like the concept of Pita Jungle- fresh, healthy, Middle-Eastern influenced.  But there's just something in the execution of their dishes that doesn't seem to jive with my palate.  I always leave wanting more flavor from the food, and to eat something a little more authentically Middle Eastern I guess.  The last time I ate here was for breakfast, and the omelet I had, while humongous, didn't really satisfy my taste buds, while the coffee that was served was super bitter, even after drowning it in cream and sugar."}
{"text":"Compared to the Pita Jungle in Tempe, the one here seems to have tastier food.  The hummus was decent, the iced tea very refreshing, and falafel pita great tasting and filling.  The mashed potatoes tasted very freshly made.  Our total with 1 appetizer, 1 side dish, 2 falafel sandwiches, and 1 iced tea was $25 including tax.  Not bad considering the amount of food we got and the fact that it's in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"This place has some amazing food. The price is pretty high for what you are actually getting. Seems like mainly hipsters go here to hang out so I always take my food to go. The music played in the background by the band is annoying and overpowering. I couldn't even have a conservation with girlfriend when we went out here. To go is the way to go."}
{"text":"I had a lunch date here today, and initially was not happy with her choice of restaurants. The first time I had Pita Jungle, I was not impressed and wondered why everyone raved about it. I ordered the sample platter and it was filled with things I didn't know and I was not pleased, especially when my friend's pizza looked so good.   Today's friend indicated she loved Pita Jungle and had been craving it,  so I followed her lead and ordered something more reasonable. We started with a cilantro-jalapeno hummus and it was very good! We each also ordered the glazed chicken lavosh pizza, which was huge! Really we could have shared one pizza, but the benefit was she could take some home to her son. The lavosh bread provided a nice crust different from traditional pizza. She tells me it reheats well - bonus!  The one thing that was a downer for me is something that happens to me constantly. As you can see from my pictures and reading prior reviews, I am not a small dude. Regardless of the restaurant or the person I am with they love to cram me in the smallest possible tables.  This was no exception. A small table for two, but with the hummus, the water, the plate for the bread - there was little room for two plates of pizza. I really disliked being cramped at the table. The place was busy, but had open seats - some of which would be more accommodating ."}
{"text":"AMAZING FOOD, LARGE PORTIONS, GOOD SERVICE, BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE, what more is there to ask for."}
{"text":"Good food + hip waiters/waitresses = Good times"}
{"text":"Decided to come here for lunch and it was wonderful as always. I've been a regular here for years and today we had a server named Tiffany , she is newer here at pita jungle but she was so amazing. She goes above and beyond to make the customers happy and she made my experience better than ever before. Thank you Tiffany for your hard work!! See you next time!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing service by Joshua.  In addition the food was impeccable.  He even added wood fired tomatoes to my Salmon entree.  Delicious! Everyone was happy and running around giving great service.  A great team! Thank you for such a great service after a horrible day."}
{"text":"This place has always been a long time fav. Especially when I was pregnant I craved the Broiled Chicken Salad with Lemon vinaigrette. The tangy goodness mixed with the broiled chicken and fresh greens was absolutely heavenly. In my opinion you'd be hard-pressed to find another salad this great in the Phoenix metro area. Amazing food !!  Love the kids meal with the proper portions of fruit, vegetables, a grain and meat (with the tofu option).... Even my picky toddlers are willing to eat it.  I'm not a big pita fan so I can't give u my personal feedback there, however I do know that everytime I go there with someone they comment on how good their pitas are!  Every time I've been there I find that the waitstaff is courteous, friendly and attentive to your needs."}
{"text":"They have a very unique lemonade, I inquired what it's made out of and they told me it's guava mixed with lemon and agave. I've tried to replicate it but I cannot. We always get the lemon pie nut chicken with the hummus sampler. It is very good. The mashed potatoes are red skinned and have a very nice texture and flavor. However, I'm not a fan of their fried potatoes or potato pieces that they do. Their gyros are also good, other people in my group have gotten burgers and they really enjoyed them. If you're in the mood for Mediterranean food and wanting something a bit healthy then this is a good place for it."}
{"text":"Reliably affordable, fairly healthy and seemingly good quality. Excellent service. I'm always down for a large Greek salad with gyro protein. Try the lentils and rice-amazingly simple and tasty. I don't make it through much of their menu because I always order the same thing. Great for takeout or delivery too"}
{"text":"Had never been to one of these before today when I decided a gyro would be good.  Well it wasn't.  The Dr. Scholl's shoe insert looking meat with the texture and shape of spam was disgusting.  Please tell me who puts pickles and lettuce on a gyro?  Yep!  This place.  The pita bread was good and the sauce was good  This is what happens when vegans think they can cook."}
{"text":"I've been going to this location for a couple years and it's by far my favorite.  Great wait staff and it's very comfortable if I'm there by myself or with a group.  There is something for everyone in my posse of eclectic foodie friends.  Vegan, vegetarian, dieters, and carnivores alike can find something to munch on.  It's our go-to place when we can't make a decision or visiting my sister-in-law who lives just next door.  She eats there pretty much every day too!  I enjoy the tapas plates that they have from 3-6pm daily even on the weekends.  There's also the pesto pizza that has become part of my top 10 items.  Ask for your drink in a to go cup that way you'll save the wash and you know you'll want it to go anyway!  My beverage of choice is an Arnold Palmer, it's really good here as it's NOT minute maid lemonade and lipton ice tea."}
{"text":"12:00pm, I call in my order for pick-up. The guy tells me that it would be ready in 10-15 minutes. WOAH! Not too bad for lunchtime. I was prepared to kick myself for not being able to make up my mind on where I wanted to go for lunch today. I was expecting to have to wait 30-45 minutes. So, I'm now enjoying the Mediterranean Roasted Chicken (Shawarma) Pita. Hold the Tahini and Garlic Dip/Sauce, add Tsatziki. Never a problem with customizing your order! I walk in and there is my order waiting for me! I am in and out the door in less than 3 minutes. Awesome!   My only gripe, and its not about the restaurant - parking. Oh and people not knowing how to drive in that flippin parking lot. Granted, I went during lunchtime and PJ is right next to another busy restaurant. Its a battle over parking spaces. And some resort to parking in firelanes. Okay, so I cant pull into this parking space, and it appears no one wants to attempt it due to some tard temporarily blocking half the lane. I am more precise backing my truck in the spot than pulling in anyway!    Tasty Mediterranean Roasted Chicken (Shawarma) Pita.  YUM!"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant and what they have to offer. I've been coming here for years and bring friends that haven't had the experience.   I enjoy the Wood-Fired Chicken quite a bit!  Try it!  One thing that always ruins a meal however is when you're forced to listen to the overhead music at the same time different music if coming out of the kitchen as was the case last night.   When we asked to move, our bartender/server said she only has this area and shrugged.  After she asked to have the music turned down, it was still and irritant and loud enough to be heard near the front doors as we exited.    No matter how good the food is, it's this kind of experience that would make me never return."}
{"text":"Great food, like always! Getting 3 starts because the dining room is extremely hot with only a few ceiling fans running, no A/C. It's arizona... a bit too hot to not have your A/C on."}
{"text":"The yelp description for three stars is totally accurate when it came to this place.  It was A-OK.  The location was decent.  The decor was decent, though the two-top tables were a bit small if you ordered anything more than what would come out on a small plate.  The service was fine.  The food was okay.  Some things were definitely better than others.  The babaganoush was pretty bland; but the hummus made up for that.  The falafel was a little dry; but the tabouleh was good.  The salads were HUGE.  The prices were pretty decent.  Overall, it was an alright Mediterranean jam."}
{"text":"I am on a gluten free vegan diet, and the servers here are always very accommodating.  They will bring me a plate of sliced cucumbers and tomatoes in place of pitas with my hummus plate.  The food is always very fresh & tasty and service is usually very pleasant and efficient.  I do wish they would offer more gluten free options."}
{"text":"the customer service today at pita jungle was horrible.. I like pita jungle's food and our waiter was fine.. but the HOSTESS and the manager KEVIN really need to learn some hospitality and concern for REGULAR customers... i frequent this place way to much with my hubby and girls and that is why i guess Im writing this now.. our table was becoming the hang out to 4-5 bees.. we asked to move inside because we literally could NOT SIT STILL but our food was being SERVED at that moment.. my 4 year old was freaking out.. i was freaking out that my 10 month old baby would be stung.. so moving inside was the best option. the waitress serving the food was like \"OMG, lets get you inside this is not good\" but as we came in, the hostess was PISSED about it and rolled her eyes and acted very young.... they had an open free table at the moment. so figuring that our food was out and getting cold they would  sit us at the open table asap.. but the manager came over to tell us we would have to wait in the waitlist line again to be sat because other people need to be sat too..... but we were already sat..so we basically pleaded and tried to convinced Kevin to please let us sit at the open table, our food is out of the kitchen already... all our hands are FULL.. we all have drinks in our hands..also a child in mine, Im in a back brace so it is not easy trying to juggle her and the drinks and whatever else was at our outside table.. he  said \"sorry but we CANNOT sit at the table..\" but will move us around to the bar when room opens.. my MIL said, \"no, we cant really do the high chair there, please can we just sit at the open table now so we can eat our food that is out\" he said.. \"no\"\"well wheres the bees even at?\" \"do you want me to stand outside at the table and fan them away while you eat your food..\" we all looked at each other. Nooo, thank you..we just want to sit inside away from the bees at that open table, so we can enjoy our food and get my kid to stop freaking out about the bees... and our food is getting cold now! my MIL says, \"i love bees, Im a gardener, we just literally cannot sit still and eat because they are swarming us, there are several of them out there.. KEVIN the manager says... \"yea..well i love Americanos and coffee and things like that\"....     (you should have seen my face).. WTF kind of comment is that in the first place.. NEVER HAVE EVER experienced such attitude and NO hospitality at this place.. We all know pita jungle likes to put off that super trendy ATTITUDE thing but this bothered me so bad im writing a review about it.. so KEVIN please work on respecting your costumers that may have issues with bees..and dont be D-BAG to someone else trying to get away from them.. i understand other people are waiting to sit and eat.. but we were already sitting with our food coming out of the kitchen being served at the exact time we were trying to move.. its not our fault about the bees. but its your fault the way you handled it and the responses you gave.. you literally could have said... \"Oh no let us help you out and get you sat inside ASAP,\" or \"It will be a few minutes, we will remake your food\" instead of the little snotty remarks like..sit and fan our table for us. sureeeeeee come sit and fan our table the entire time while we eat... thanks buddy.  and then he says to the hostess... UGH well i guess its happening!  all pissed off sounding.. i guess put them there at the table... and as we sat at the table in the moment right then,  3 OTHER tables opened right up for those people waiting on the wait list! please understand we were already sat, our food was out of the kitchen and we had babies being attacked by bees. and there was an open table inside regardless if the hostess was planning to put someone else there...  this place is one of my favorites so i was pretty sad about the way they came off..i was excited to show my MIL and brother in law.. but clearly they were not impressed and sadly only from the people working...."}
{"text":"Pretty good. The food isn't bad and portions are great!  It's very affordable for a sit down place. I   wasn't expecting much since I don't usually eat pita's.  Its a tasty option for anyone who wants something healthy.   The pictures people are taking here are pretty accurate.   they have items other than pita's, but they didn't like that great."}
{"text":"After 75 reviews there is not a lot to add, but I must add this try the fruit salad with the watermelon, it will change your life!  It's so amazing!  Service here is always great, it doesn't matter if it's slow or packed they are always friendly and quick."}
{"text":"Pita Jungle is what it is. It's a chain. It's average Mediterranean-style food. It's Americanized.  It's \"okay.\"   We started with the jalapeno cilantro hummus. Pretty good! The large size comes with two pitas. We ordered a third (.49 cents) to be on the safe side of bread-to-hummus ratio. That was a smart decision, as two was not enough.    I had the falafel pita for dinner. It didn't have enough tahini inside to make up for the dryness of the falafel, so I found myself dousing it in Cholula.  I added avocado to the pita ($1.49 upcharge) and it was saddest, smallest sliver of avocado my eyes have ever beheld.  I also had the peanut butter porter. Wasn't bad. I will admit, though, it was a poor drink choice for the style of food we were eating. Peanut butter + hummus = no bueno.    Our server was very friendly and accommodating. Probably the best part of the meal! If I'm near a Pita Jungle again, I would eat here, it just wouldn't be my go-to option."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch during a recent cycling day. Yes they have a convenient bike rack and do not mind the spandex crowd. We sat outside and the crevice could not have been better. The re Quinoa salad over hummus was very very good and their Gyros sandwich was the best Ive ever had. The house iced tea is also very good. When waling in they were doing a photo shoot for a new menu. They are going to serve breakfast and brunch and I have to say that the egg dishes that they were photographing looked amazing!! Cant wait to return!"}
{"text":"Best place I ate in all of Arizona. Good authentic Mediterranean food. The fish burger I had was amazing and the potatoes were perfect. The atmosphere is elegant yet casual, the crowd was mellow, and there's a bar."}
{"text":"The table service was great, but sadly the food was not. The chicken shawarma was really dry. We asked for tzaziki and garlic sauce to try to moisten it up, but alas..."}
{"text":"I would first like to say I do not write many reviews, this is probably my third one ever.  I have been in the fine dining restaurant industry for 8 years and my bf and I were just rolling thru the mall last night 2/13/17 and grabbing a quick bite at this location was so great!  We were greeted by Dwyatt (forgive me if I am spelling it wrong) and he was so welcoming, knowledgeable and had hospitality skills far exceeding what his job title was. It's so nice to have experiences like this and he definitely made our night."}
{"text":"First timer at Pita Jungle today. The atmosphere of this place is very inviting. Went for lunch and even though it seemed pretty busy, I was seated right away. The employees were extremely friendly and always asking if I needed anything extra. Wait time for the food was very short. The food was reeeaaallllly good! The portion sizes are HUGE! I couldn't even finish half of my wrap but that just makes it super awesome to be able to take it home for left overs!   All in all, this place is great for all types of ages! Very welcoming and the speedy service makes it great to bring children as well!   Will definitely be going back! Two thumbs up for Pita Jungle!"}
{"text":"Used to be my favorite happy hour spot but after arriving there this Sunday, anticipating delicious trusty drinks with my girlfriends, they took cocktails off of their menu! Still fabulous tapas and healthy, tasty, creative and great priced food but why on earth would you get rid of all those fabulous concoctions?"}
{"text":"Great place when your looking for healthy, delicious Mediterranean food! The Gyro and Falafels are to die for, great service and ambiance."}
{"text":"Note to mgmt Came for a quick takeout Paused out in front to look at menu and appalled Between the menu and the glass is a rotting dead bee and yony live bugs crawling all over menu Ugh!!!!! Revolting Consider looking at ot for urself!"}
{"text":"Food was decent, I'd eat it again. Portions were good size.  However service was not. It took about 45 mins for order to even come, and then the waitress did not get the order right. And she left my burger sitting at the counter for 5 mins before bringing it over so that it could get cold. The extra cheese & avocado on the burger was microscopic and could not taste either, that was a waste of $.  Because the food took so long to arrive, we ended up having to box a bunch of it as we were out of time.   Overall, meh. Probably won't opt to go back, but if friends wanted to meet there, I'd go."}
{"text":"I so love Pita Jungle - we have eaten at nearly every location over the years, have used their catering menu for parties and business functions by our calculations we have eaten at Pita Jungle more than 500 times since moving to the Valley 9 years ago.   Unfortunately this location does not live up to the quality we expect from the franchise.   As vegans we have limited options in dining out and Pita Jungle has built a strong reputation as a company that caters to vegans and vegetarians alike. But not at this location.   Back in the spring we ordered take out only to find pieces of chicken mixed in with our tofu - I talked with Christina the GM and she assured us it was an \"anomaly\" and couldn't happen again. Still we avoided this location for 6 months hoping the problem would get resolved over time. It didn't - we went back again last month and I ordered a veggie garden wrap only to once again find pieces of chicken mixed into this vegan dish.   This time I took pictures and sent them to Christina and the local manager Mary - they completely ignored my emails so I posted them to their facebook page. And once again they claim it is an anomaly. Reading other yelp reviews it seems like this recurring anomaly is now the norm at this location. So we avoid it like the plague."}
{"text":"We love the food, the happy hour is amazing not to mention wine Wednesday! We always have such a great experience at the Williams Field location! Keelie is the best"}
{"text":"Tasty food, a super cool environment, and its always busy. The service can be hit or miss, especially when it's busy, but the food is great and awesome for veggie eaters like me."}
{"text":"I love Pita Jungle! Such a refreshing menu for this area that's mostly filled with greasy Mexican food and fast food. The Mediterranean salad and the cilantro jalepeno hummus are amazing and so fresh tasting!   I do have a couple suggestions for Pita Jungle- offer food that is organic and Non GMO. And also with the order of hummus you should be able to choose if you would like pita bread or veggies to dip it with for those who do not tolerate grains. The one time I asked for veggies in place of pita I was brought a small plate of about 6 cucumbers that left me with lots of hummus and nothing to dip with and I was charged for them."}
{"text":"Let me just start by saying that I don't like this place, I Looooove it! Ahhh Pita Jungle were have you been all my life?! I had heard about this place for years and never went for two reasons.  1. The closest one was in Tempe at the time and I lived in N.Peoria 2. My husband(you know who you are) wouldn't take me because he didn't like it. Booo!  Anyway, they finally opened one up in Glendale! So hear I am in Pita heaven.  I've been a big fan of hummus, but until I tried the cilantro jalapeno hummus here, I had no idea! I could easily lick the plate and if I didn't have to share, I totally would! The pesto, spinach and tomato pizza is amazing and the Shwarma is equally delicious!   I just recently made a visit and tried the veggie burger, more like a sandwich only because they serve it on whole wheat slices of sandwich bread. My friend took a look at my plate and gave the look as if to say \" I could have made this at home.\" I took a great big bite outta that sad homemade looking thing and didn't stop til she had another look on her face like \"Where the hell did your food go?\" The patty was full of chunky vegetables and came with a spread(forgot to ask what it was) that complimented the sandwich quit well. I have also had the Thousand Bean burrito and it is the only thing that I would not recommend. If your hungry and you love beans, go for it! It's a large portion, they should call it the 7000 bean burrito! I am not that person.  The End"}
{"text":"Food was decent, but my problem were the short shorts the waitresses were wearing, not to mention the food that one hostess brought in from Paradise Bakery.  I was thinking to myself what a great way to support your job.  I guess the food at Pita Jungle was not good enough for her.  Our waitress was at the front as our food waited to be brought to us for about 5min before she brought it to us.  I am glad to see the staff can eat whatever and whenever they want.  I am sure that they didn't realize that as they were so diligently ate their food and attempted to work by rolling forks and knives in napkins.  They were eating in the dining room and still waiting on customers.  What great customer service.  I don't think I will be going back to a Pita Jungle anytime soon. They ask for wait service I would say it was nonexistent.  Keep up the inept service and the mediocre food."}
{"text":"holla atcha baba ganoush!  omfg, LOVE this place.  i hadn't been before one of the soldiers i work with said she wanted some hummus & chicken.    \"hummus?\" says i.  \"i shall venture out to retrieve this prize for you, if you will man my station for the duration of my investigation of this location.\"  anyway!  i went out to grab lunch for my co-workers in the lab.  as the reigning queen of indecision, i decided to get the mediterranean combo.  best decision of my LIFE...well...maybe weekend.  but STILL!  the baba ganoush is my new fave thing!  the hummus was AWEsome!  they gave me a whole pack o' pitas.  A PACK...they didn't even take them out of the bag.  HOLLA!  and i know this sounds weird, but the croquette things tasted like burritos i used to buy for like...a buck and microwave.  might sound gross, but in reality, i would eat those burritos everyday if they weren't disgustingly bad for me.  so BONUS!  i got hummus for another soldier, he LOVED it.  i heard that the gyro was to die for AND the hummus/chicken combo was DE-LI-CI-OUS.  gotta get it with the lime/cilantro hummus.  PLUS, i got all this for less than 40 bucks!  you'll see me here again, in a t-shirt that says \"baba ganoush is my homie\""}
{"text":"Love the jalapeno hummus.. Went with a suggestion on trying the Chipotle chicken pizza and man was it good.  There is so much food that I couldn't eat it all.  Kevin was my waiter and very attentive and friendly.  Took me a little bit to find the place but I did see a sign saying that they are moving."}
{"text":"I came here with some coworkers not exactly knowing what to expect. I had heard great things and their Yelp reviews looked promising.   We sat outside on a very nice patio and enjoyed the weather. Our waitress was very prompt and helpful. After reviewing the menu I decided to get the Wood Fired Chicken. The chicken was juicy and flavorful, the potatoes were delicious, and the sauce covering it was a nice touch. Oh, and it's a large portion so you get leftovers!  I'll definitely be coming back to this place!"}
{"text":"Pitas are always good. However at this location the water taste like they poured it from the toilet bowl. The server brought out lemonade that taste like something from Mars. Also he didn't bring out the food or do any refills. Not impressed with the service but pitas are always good. Good luck on the drinks because what we had sucked!!"}
{"text":"Today was my first visit to this location.  The location is big but tight.  The outside seating is nice if you are a people watcher!  Inside is decorated with bicycles hanging from the ceiling, colorful lampshades for the overhanging fixtures, painted canvas on the walls.  The bar is made from some sort of metal or tin painted with cartoonish figures and designs.  Seating is tight but comfortable.  The open kitchen and high ceilings bring much space to the restaurant.  All the employees were young and hip with beards and leather jackets and stylish scarves.  The energy was lively and there was music playing but I couldn't tell what.  The volume of the actual room was louder than the music. The hostess was prompt to seat us where we chose.  Our waitress was very pleasant and attentive and smiled often.    Smiles are contagious :)    We ordered the Falafel on a bed of greens , Black Bean Burger (that will make you fart for 3 seconds straight when you get home) with pita instead of bread/bun, Coconut Curry Soup, Caramelized Cauliflower with Tahini, and Brown Rice.  Oh yes, these items were fantastic.  It was my first experience with the cauliflower, and it was amazing.  Big chunks of steamed cauliflower drizzled in spicy tahini with caramelized onion strings in the middle.  I really really like it.  I'm going to make it at home now.  The falafel is something I have had here before and I always liked how Pita Jungle makes theirs.  Can't go wrong with the falafel.  The greens were fresh and abundant.  The black bean burger was good.  It had pieces of corn and cranberry in it so that was pretty rad.  Two of my favs.  The burger is just an average black bean burger though.  And if you are vegan you have to order it with the pita instead of bread/bun (according to the waitress).  The burger comes with garlic new potatoes, which are softened potatoes with garlic.  I like them, such a healthier alternative to crispy, deep fried french fries.  Brown Rice is just brown rice with parsley.  Coconut Curry soup was soooo delish.  My favorite out of everything today.  Creamy curry with chickpeas and peppers and cilantro.  Served with two crunchy pita chips on the side.  LOVED IT.  So good for not making it at home.  I gave this location of Pita Jungle 4 stars because the space was a bit tight and I didn't have like an epiphany or anything while eating my food.  I love the Pita Jungle concept of being trendy and hip but also serving fantastic, easy to create, HEALTHY alternatives to the other restaurants near by.  Pita Jungle doesn't break your wallet and you leave with a tummy full."}
{"text":"I really really really enjoy hummus with check and pita and this place does all those things so well!   Some locations also have great appetizers and happy hour specials.   Can't be beat!"}
{"text":"I love everything about this place! Its a very inviting and relaxed atmosphere. Everything that ive ordered is good. My favorite is the tomato basil soup!"}
{"text":"I'm pretty in love with everything on the menu, but, Kathleen, what's the point of rattling off my \"to go\" order if you aren't going to actually CHECK the food?  You didn't even ring it up right.  You read my order to me accurately, but I received exactly what was on the check, which you rung up incorrectly.  And while you say you're genuinely sorry, I wasn't going to drive back to the restaurant so you could make it right."}
{"text":"Love Pita Jungle, but went there for a \"to go\" order and specifically asked for TWO lavish pizzas with chicken.  And interestingly enough, the sweet girl who took my order made sure she had the correct item, as there's also a glazed-chicken lavish on the menu, and sometimes people confuse the two items.  I knew exactly what she was referring to, and we do not like the glazed, soI told her that I was always really careful about that.  She placed the order correctly (according to the receipt), but guess what we got?  Two glazed pizzas.  And those are much less expensive than the other ones, by 6.00!  Grrr.  Thanks, guys in the kitchen.  We totally did NOT enjoy our dinner this evening."}
{"text":"Always hear a loud ticking in the restaurant ...maybe because this place is DA BOMB (yikes)"}
{"text":"I ordered a meal and after waiting about 10-15, was approached by the server with him explaining that the last item had been given to another patron. I was mostly unbothered and ordered another entree, although it wasn't my first choice.   A few minutes later our order was brought to us by one of the managers and they comped our meal without us having to insist.   A+ for recognizing shortcomings and quickly resolving."}
{"text":"When I first became a vegetarian I ate here all of the time. The food is healthy and delicious. Relaxing atmosphere. Food tastes so much better when someone else makes it. The happy hour prices are amazing, lots of delicious food and unlimited tropical iced tea all under $10!"}
{"text":"Favorite restaurant in town! Always delicious, great service, and vibes! So many healthy options too!"}
{"text":"Desert Ridge Pita Jungle has always delivered on quality and flavor.  My go-to order is chicken with regular hummus appetizer for approx $11 - don't let 'appetizer' fool you- it can feed two. The chicken is seasoned incredibly. I order the plain hummus, but all 3 are delicious. The plate is delivered with 2 full pitas- I recommend also asked for cucumbers if you're looking for a healthier option. I love their falafel as well and ordered 2 ala carte tonight at $1.09 per piece. The happy hour here is just ok- definite room for improvement. But I love the outdoor seating and breadth of healthy and semi-indulgent choices on the menu! They seem to be consistent across location, so find the nearest to you!"}
{"text":"One of my all time favorites!  Everything here is excellent.  The best kept secret are their small plates on happy hour.   Delicious and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Since when did price gouging become a thing at pita jungle? I've been here multiple times before and the waitress we had charged us .20 more per every substitution and $1.25 for an extra small handful of chips. Which in the past no server at this Pita Jungle has ever done. I've always asked for substitutions on certain meals and they've never said anything costed extra nor have I been charged extra. I asked the waitress if this is a new thing and she said, \"We are suppose to charge extra and if someone else didn't do it that's their fault but I'm by the book so I'm going to charge you extra for substitutions.\" Ok fair enough if that's the Pita Jungle \"by the book policy\" and you need to charge extra, then charge extra but don't make it feel like you are nickel-ing and dime-ing your customers for every cent. No, it wasn't a huge difference in price of what I normally would have paid but it was the way the server approached the situation. And at that point it felt like all they wanted was my money nothing else. Which I have NEVER felt this way at this location or any other of the 5 Pita Jungle locations I've been too until today. It's a shame because the food was great but that \"experience\" wasn't worth coming back to this location."}
{"text":"When I lived closeby- this is where I went when I was feeling homesick for Portland food.   My personal favorites-   Cilantro Jalapeno Hummus= Perfect.  Lavosh Pizza= 2nd best thing anyone has ever done with Lavosh (RIP Pischke's).  Caramelized Cauliflower with Tahini= Duh  Lentil Fetoosh Salad= That LEMONY DRESSING!  Chicken Combination Platter= Perfect high protein lunch"}
{"text":"*UPDATE*  After I had my initial disappointing experience at this location I was told to contact the store manager and I decided to give them another try.  The new manager Mike was genuinely interested in the past experience I had and wanted to rectify the issue.  I appreciate the service that he showed my family and I.  The service was excellent and the food was fantastic.  Our server was also fantastic.  It seems like they have completely worked out any issues they had, which is to be expected in a new restaurant.  I would definitely recommend this location, top notch."}
{"text":"I would often times pass by this place heading to get a protein shake from One Stop Nutrition which is basically next door.  The food would always smell terrific, and the patio was always bumping.  The wife and I finally decided to check it out on a warm, beautiful Arizona night and thoroughly enjoyed our experience.  Our server was laid back and friendly, the food was healthier than most food  places and the quality was pleasant.  Prices are decent as long as you don't get wine like my wife and I did.  Was really impressed with this place and will be going back."}
{"text":"Last week a large group of us went to this location for my birthday dinner. Many of us had been to the other locations and thought we would try this location out and I have to say I was very pleased.  The same great food, however this location has a great open and urban feel about it.   I had the spicy chicken wrap and the thing was MASSIVE.  If you get this, you better be hungry.   It honestly could feed 2 people.   I've had other pita dishes there and those are typically better proportioned for a meal.  The service was pretty good, especially since we had such a large group.   I give this an enthusiastic 2 thumbs up!   Ambiance / Decor: A+ Drinks: A  (Had Pino Grigio and it was yummy!) Food: A Service: A Affordability: A"}
{"text":"Pita Jungle's food is always fresh and delicious! I love their salads and hummus. The gyro is good too! This is my go-to restaurant for healthy food."}
{"text":"Mmmm...Pita Jungle.   The food is fresh, affordable and tasty. I like the atmosphere a lot. Great for groups or a dinner date."}
{"text":"Good food but, this place is super loud to the point that it's deafening at times.    Order anything on the menu and you'll enjoy it.  I've been here a few times but, checked in once.  I've had falafel once and then a roasted veggie wrap another time.  Both were fresh and flavorful.    Before I go again, I have no choice but to sit outside in the heat or bring earplugs.  It's really tough to hold a conversation since everyone is trying to talk over each other socializing."}
{"text":"Good place but the lighting and atmosphere inside kind of feels like a cafeteria. But such a cool location! The food is a bit rich"}
{"text":"My server megan was great and her smile was warming. She suggested I got the chipotle chicken pizza. It was the best I've had of any pizza like it! Ask for megan as a waitress when you go in and try the pizza! Would go back again tomorrow !"}
{"text":"2nd time here! 2nd day in a row! Consecutively AMAZING!!  I tried the pesto pizza today, which came highly recommended by my server! She also very graciously made a few amendments for me....haha  ...lavosh crust, no cheese, add tofu...and it was AWESOME!!  She even brought me a HUGE side of EXTRA pesto without me requesting it!  I can't say enough good things about this place! The service is superb! And the food is fresh and delicious!   They make eating clean and vegan-ish so easy and tasty!!"}
{"text":"Decent fresh food. Try's a bit too hard to be different causing some dishes to not be so great or something different than what they are claiming to be, but, overall good and I appreciate the effort to be fresh and healthy."}
{"text":"I use to love coming here when we lived in Mesa. I don't know how many times I've been. Awesome food, awesome drinks, great atmosphere, and we've always had good service. I've hardly ever said that about a restaurant. No complaints here."}
{"text":"Gotta love this place. I just tried Falafel for the first time in my life at Pita Jungle and it is AMAZING! I had the Falafel Pita and my waitress suggested I pair it with their spicy Chipotle sauce to drizzle on top. Their garlic mushrooms are to die for, and the cilantro jalepeno hummus is surprisingly refreshing. Not terribly spicy like I suspected. We went on a Thursday night around 6:30, very busy, chill atmosphere with a live jazz band."}
{"text":"First time coming to this location and we enjoyed it more than the previous one we visited. Plus...kids eat free on Saturday and Sunday! Can't beat that. The gyro was good and the prices were great. Honestly I was most impressed by the kids meal, very complete and quality. We will be back!"}
{"text":"By simply hearing the name, one would think this place is some sort of Middle Eastern knockoff chain, but Pita Jungle is no such thing.  The fresh and flavorful food is a wonderful oasis in the desert of Arizona.  Pita J serves up large portions of vegan, vegetarian, and gluten free friendly fare without sacrificing any flavor.  My table ordered the hummus sampler (original, sun dried tomato, and jalape√±o) which was wonderful.  Though a much trendier take on hummus than it's authentic counterpart, the flavor profiles were all still there.  For my entree, I ordered the roasted vegetable salad with chicken shawarma.  The vegetables were grilled to perfection with the perfect amount of caramelization.  The chicken, however, was by no means shawarma, rather wonderfully seasoned chicken breast (which I did not mind).  The lemon vinaigrette topped off the salad with an excellent, tangy twist.   Though this place is not traditional Middle Eastern cuisine, my meal was still great.  Next time I visit ASU, I know I will be returning to Pita J."}
{"text":"I have been to quite a few eateries and can't think of anyplace that has better food and service than Pita Jungle. A group of us come almost every week after a class and really love this place.  I'm vegan and there ate plenty of food options for me.  The staff is just delightful and special orders don't even make them wince. They are the best. That's why we keep coming back week after week."}
{"text":"I had to write a review here, because I couldn't disagree more with what someone else said in their review, \"You can expect Consistency and Good Service when you dine at Pita Jungle.\"  I live within a 5-minute walk of this location, and I've been there countless times so far in 2013.  Consistent is the last adjective that comes to mind when I think of this particular Pita Jungle.  So, I'm not sure it's possible to write an effective review of this place.  The service has ranged from annoyingly attentive to so neglectful you feel invisible when you're sitting at the bar 2 feet away from someone working there.  The kitchen can sometimes have your meal in 5 minutes, sometimes 50 minutes later you wonder if they even put in the order.  Sometimes it's extremely silent, sometimes the kitchen and staff are so loud you can get a headache even when there are only like 3 customers in the whole place.  The food is totally inconsistent also, and the garlic new potatoes come to mind as a good example.  I've had the garlic new potatoes as the side to a meal at least half a dozen times.  They have been absolutely mouthwatering perfection with perfectly cooked caramelized seasoning at times.  So perfect I was tempted to order two sides of the potatoes for desert.  However, once they were scorched on the outside and still a bit raw inside.  And the majority of the time they are generally just barely \"cooked\" (meaning not raw), but browned even slightly and totally bland and tasteless.  I could go on about a few other dishes, and about other service experiences.  But the point here is that this place is a gamble.  I only go now when I'm ready to risk it, or feeling lucky.  Occasionally it's amazing, sometimes it's completely disappointing and horrible, and a lot of the time it's just a mild let-down.  But consistent?   I don't know how many times the people who are writing those reviews have actually been to this location, but if they got consistency, they were really lucky."}
{"text":"Very good, Chicken pita is flavorful & light,  perfect for a healthy meal. It is my first but not my last, my server Alisha is not only pleasant but attentive & helpful (for a rookie patron). There are many choices of healthy wraps/ pitas, the flavors are different then I'm use to enjoying but I like new flavors. Large chunks of fresh grill chicken with; lettuce,  onions,  pickles (wasn't sure about these), a garlic \"sauce\" & Tahini (no idea). All of this tasted great,  I cannot wait to return to try the Philly steak."}
{"text":"Dear Bettina L. of Pita Jungle:  The Downtown Pita Jungle is located as part of a live/work space in a high end dog friendly apartment complex. Our apartment complex is full of people who can both afford to live here and also eat out with some pretty fair regularity, and also who love their dogs. It may be to your benefit to apply to Maricopa County Environmental Services Department for a Dog Friendly Patio Permit Application if you have not already done so.  It is a fairly simple application and, from what I understand, nearly always approved.   As for my experience, it was four months ago. I wrote my yelp review while standing outside, across the street, astonished. Perhaps that gives you a timeline, but other than that, I can only tell you the server was a young male and that he was very, very rude.  Nearly all of the local businesses have dog friendly patios, good food and friendly staff. Pita Jungle was among my favorite but until my dog can come along, I won't be back.   Thank you for your time.   Holly"}
{"text":"You cannot go wrong at Pita Jungle. Awesome happy hour & reverse happy hour, the best iced tea, and I've never had food there I didn't like.  This location in particular is great with the patio overlooking the lake. Servers are friendly, food is fast, drinks are cheap. Its the best!"}
{"text":"I remember this place before it served alcohol.  I've had the shawarma pita many, many times here, but the last time it did not taste the same----I was trying to figure out what they did wrong (it was the first time I didn't finish it).  I like the cilantro/jalapeno hummus,,,,"}
{"text":"I used to love this place and eat here all the time. But over the past year this place has been consistently disappointing with the quality of food served. The amount of meat that they put in their salads and pitas  is now about half of what it used to be. Not eating here again."}
{"text":"Excellent food, lots of healthy choices, pleasant and low key atmosphere.   Well done, PJ!"}
{"text":"First visit to the new location near home.   I'd been to the Tempe location a few times when I worked in Tempe, knew they had great hummus and pita.   The 7th street location is very bright and airy inside, lots of windows w/ a great bar and patio.   The space is a lot larger inside than it appears from outside.   Had the Chicken Tikka Masala, which isn't a traditional CTM--it's made w/ a mild coconut curry and was quite tasty, the chicken tender and flavorful.   My friend had the salmon, she thought it was delicious, compared it favorably to the salmon at Culinary Dropout down the street.  The chocolate and walnut baklavas made for a great desert.  Good wine selection...recommended for lazy Sundays."}
{"text":"We get takeout here every once in a while. I like that they have a wide variety of foods so that my wife and I can both easily find something we want.  I got the spicy chicken wrap last time and it was awesome. My wife always gets the hummus and chicken and some fresh squeezed lemonade which was very good too.  I can't say much for the service here because we typically do take out.  Highly recommended restaurant to almost anyone."}
{"text":"OMG! Get the kafta pizza. I was like WTF, never heard of that one before, but wow...what a slick invention. SO freaking good. Super fast service, we were in a rush to get to the airport, we were in and out in 30min, our server was a hottie, friendly and efficient too. Their pita bread is amazing, we had the babaghanoush and it was DEE-LISH. I'm an Arab too, so I've got high standards when it comes to our food. This place ROCKS!"}
{"text":"I come here often and I usually get their Greek salad.  So delicious.  Could be a little more generous with the Feta but overall great service and great food.  Garlic potatoes are amazing.  And the outdoor seating is a great feature on a nice evening."}
{"text":"My favorite place by far in Tempe and I am so happy they are closer to my work on Mill ave. I picked up take out at thier back bar from Tia. She was very nice and attentive since I decided to stay and eat. The decor is a nice upgrade to thier original location as well. Like always I will be back!"}
{"text":"I've spent 8 years in the valley and last week was my first time dining at Pita Jungle. It was pretty busy when I walked in, but I was quickly seated and waited for my other to join me. I browsed the menu, which are old(er) and falling apart which was kind of a bummer considering how popular this place is. Our server was attentive at first, but there was a noticeable wait for delivering our drinks and returning to take our order. A lot of things looked great, but I decided on the med chicken schwarma and added the garlic potatoes. My bf had the broiled chicken pita and the beans. The food came out pretty quickly and we dug in. I enjoyed my pita - it was as expected and really filling. The potatoes were good also. My bf liked his meal, but noted that the mixed beans were cold, not sure if that was intentional or not. I'll definitely give them another try, especially since there is a location near my office."}
{"text":"Wow!!! Is all I can say....I really enjoyed the food and thought the service was great. But just placed a Togo order and came in to pick it up was acknowledged and sat at over 5mins staring at my bag of food while the manger stood in front of me speaking to another employee and once conversation was over walked into the kitchen and never came back. Poor service is all I have too say"}
{"text":"Love the Pita Jungle, close to home, great patio, and great food. Service is on point and when it's not they make it right. Great place for lunch or dinner and a fairly extensive menu."}
{"text":"Good place for lunch, very quick service and very tasty food. Ordered one of the shawarma's and it was very tasty, a little noisy though"}
{"text":"Yummy gyro and really fresh tasting  ingredients. Love their kids menu and takeout is fast and convenient!"}
{"text":"Loved this place! We went on Saturday at lunch time and we were blown away about the fact that there was a 25-30 min wait. However, we only waited for 10 minutes. They were really good at getting people seated as quickly as possible. Our waitress was supper nice and patient. She was very helpful with things on the menu. We ordered the hummus, vegetable salad, Greek salad and gyro. The food was phenomenal. Only thing I didn't like was the pickles in my gyro. Overall, great atmosphere, food and service. Definitely order the green tea!"}
{"text":"The manager Dave did a great job at taking care of us. He did exactly what he is supposed to do as a manager. Will go back here because of him."}
{"text":"Deliciousness - 3/5 Happiness 2.5/5  This is a bit of an odd place.  They mix a sit-down style restaurant with a fast-casual type menu. The food is all perfectly adequate, and reasonably-portioned (not giant-sized portions). That said, none of the dishes had much spice that you typically want in a Mediterranean restaurant, not even the dishes with \"spice\" in the name (like the special Moroccan-spiced chicken).   The best thing, by far, was the kids menu. You get a great meal - a generous serving of a protein (i.e., chicken, beef, turkey), a side (like mac and cheese, rice, or pita), drink, fruit, and veggies for $5.00. My 1-year old devoured the carrots, hummus, and pita and my 5-year old was happy to have both chicken and mac and cheese.  On the downside, the service was PAINFULLY slow. Our waitress never checked on us, and especially when you have kids, you want to be in and out ASAP. It took an hour and a half from seating to check (granted, the restaurant was relatively full). Just way too long for a family restaurant. And in that time, our water cups were re-filled just once."}
{"text":"So, not sure if was just what I ate but I didn't think it was great.  I had a lunch meeting and decided to try their falafel pita.  For $6 I thought it would have a side or something, but it was limpy lettuce, hardly any sauce, burnt falafel and a huge pita..it was ok but not great at all.  Others had the philly chicken pita and the garlic potatoes which looked really good but for what I had and paid, totally not worth it. Service was good and friendly and it only took about 10 minutes to be seated inside however, we had an annoying fly lingering around our table the entire time.   Since service was good, I will have to try the place again to see what people are really raving about!"}
{"text":"We always enjoy a good lunch at any Pita Jungle."}
{"text":"We always enjoy a good lunch at any Pita Jungle but we liked this one the best because of the lovely terrace and cleanliness of the place.  Some Pita Jungle restaurants are a bit run down but this one is in great shape.  Our waiter was very nice.  The salad with salmon was delicious!"}
{"text":"I dunno whether I like PJ or not. They bill hemaelves as \"healthy\" what's healthy? Is your water filtered and cleaned of contaminants FULLY including Fluoride? Do you fry your foods in canola oils? Is your produce organic and pesticide free? Just because you serve vegetables doesn't make you healthy and all the friend and doughy food they serve has me questioning."}
{"text":"What to expect when coming here? GREAT HEALTHY FOOD at fair prices. Had the chicken and hummus. It is FANTASTIC!!!!! My wife had the Greek salad and my son had a plain cheese pizza. My son 12 was not so impressed. My suggestion be to just add some pizza sauce to the kids menu pizza. My son thought it was too healthy, but NOT ME! We love this place and will be back..   Don't forget to add some sliced cucumber with the chicken & hummus it goes great together!"}
{"text":"I love the lavosh shwarma wrap, the garlicky sauce is awesome. And, the greek salad that comes on the side is splashed with lemon instead of an oily dressing like many places. It is not expensive either. Love it!"}
{"text":"I've been eating at Pita Jungle for something like 15-20 years if that's possible. I ate at the original on Apache Blvd. for years and then the Arcadia location for most of the past 6-7 years or so. What I started to notice there, and really notice at the 7th St. and Missouri location is how far the food quality has gone down. I'm not saying they're using subpar ingredients, but the menu items are as bland and not the least bit authentic (as was the case years ago). The babaganoush for example has this ratatouille thing in the center and the the eggplant is bland and not creamy at all. Seems there is a lack of seasoning, tahini, oil, etc. Just not good. The regular hummus has so little flavor and tang, everyone who tried it said it was the worst hummus they've ever had. That's bad, because we're Middle Eastern. The one thing on their menu that is outstanding is the Cauliflower Tahini with Carmelized Onions. Delicioius, but half the size portion as I remember. This location has failed me twice now and will not be back. It seems all the authenticity has been stripped away in favor of a bright, pleasant interior. I miss the old days."}
{"text":"Had the humus baboonish and chicken salad. They were great. Phillip our server was perfect. A yes we can do that attitude. Simply lived the g here. I'll be back. Oh the carrot cake was better than most"}
{"text":"Pita Jungle is our favorite restaurant in Phoenix! And it was confirmed again on Friday at the Pita Jungle in Mesa. Perfect night to sit outside. Best hummus in town!  My wife loved the soup with coconut milk and I was very impressed with the green lintel. It had a spiciness to it that was unexpected. Your chefs really know what they're doing. I also must mention how superb our waitress was. A joyful person with excellent service skills. I believe her name is Rachel. But back to the food. I love the mahi mahi. It's yummy yummy! We finished our meal with your scrumptious rice pudding and can't wait to return soon! See you for our next date night!"}
{"text":"VERY Small HH portions.   Only 4 tap beers, none local.   Attitude galore at this location, like other reviewers have said.  What a shame.  The one downtown is SO much better."}
{"text":"No wifi = zero stars.  HH menu items are microscopic.  No bar, only a bar rail at kitchen, which is hot.  No TVs.  Poor service."}
{"text":"NO WIFI???? A new restaurant??? Seriously?!  Poor/slow service. Bartender/server cares more about taking take-out orders than serving people trying to order in the bar.  Very small bar.  Shelf highlighting wine and bottled beers that's above the bar is no lit up at all - super dark. Can't see it."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots in AZ. I recently tried the Philly Cheesesteak pita on my last visit and absolutely loved it! I was even able to reheat the leftovers the next day and it was just as tasty.  I also shared an order of the roasted red pepper hummus with warm pita, a must for an appetizer!   We really enjoyed our sever and the atmosphere was great. Thanks Pita Jungle!"}
{"text":"Been going to Pita Jungle for YEARS! This is a great spot to go to if you are looking for something nicer than fast food and is still a casual atmosphere. The food is good and price is reasonable.    Love the cilantro jalepano hummus! I generally get the chicken pasta salad. The dressing for the salad is zesty and yummy! I also really like the chiptole chicken wood fired pizza. The nachos are yummy as well. I recently was able to go for their Happy Hour and was pretty happy with rhe outcome. The portions were small but for $1-$3 a plate  ...I won't complain! (See pictures)."}
{"text":"The chipotle black bean burger was DELICIOUS.  This restaurant has a nice atmosphere.   It was a great dinner experience! Very grateful."}
{"text":"I was first introduced to the Pita Jungle in the Scottsdale Fashion Square Mall by a friend. I got the gyro and it was delicious. It's not your typical gyro you would get at a Greek place. It's beef, not lamb, includes a pickle (kind of weird at first but I embrace it now), and not nearly as greasy/messy. It's a much healthier version (I think).   I didn't know they had a restaurant location and boy was it a pleasant surprise! The menu at the restaurant is a lot larger than what they offer at the mall. I have had multiple things on the menu. My go-tos are the gyro, roasted chicken pita, and the greek salad (which is huge). All of them are delicious and I could come here again and again. Oh, the hummus is good too but you'll want to order extra tomatoes or cucumbers (for a charge) because they never give you enough. However, with so many great places to try in the area, I'm trying to dine at a new place every time I eat out so I haven't been back in a long time. This might need to change though. Writing this review is making me want Pita Jungle really badly!   This location also has an outdoor patio to enjoy when it's not scorching hot. If you still have room for dessert there's Gelato Spot next door. The staff has always been attentive and friendly every time I have been there."}
{"text":"I love Pita Jungle. The Mediterranean Chicken Salad, Gyro Pita, and Chicken Shawarma Pita are my three go-tos, depending on what I'm in the mood for. I think there's something for everyone and a great spot for when I want something on the healthier side. I also like how they have all their food nutrition available online if you're counting your calories, macros, etc. Service is always friendly when I go and they're accommodating of large groups and splitting checks is never an issue."}
{"text":"Honestly, the service at this Pita Jungle is the worst. There's always something wrong. (And yet, we keep coming back). The first bad experience was when we asked to move tables because ours was dirty. The server audibly sighed and acted as if it was a huge hassle. The second bad experience was when they brought us the wrong food. Bringing chicken to my vegan friend never ends up well for him or for the wait staff who has to bear the brunt of his fury. The third bad experience happened on the last visit. Dirty cups. Gross.  The food is the same as other locations. Mostly delicious, but often the food is inconsistent. The potatoes are usually tasty, but always come out to varying degrees of doneness. Same with the lentil soup, sometimes it's thick, sometimes its thin. I like the Mediterannean Platter and they get kudos for allowing substitutes (since I don't like their baba ghanoush."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch or dinner!! Love the giant portions! Nice atmosphere and great service. Would totally eat here at least once a week!"}
{"text":"I think the food is great but I'm not a fan of the layout of the seating area, I feel I have no privacy and to close to the table next to me, wish they had booths for people like me. A little pricey for some of the dishes but I guess the quality of the food is why. Pitas are fire!"}
{"text":"I Love this Pita Jungle! The staff is friendly and food amazing. I often get it to go. My family occasionally eats at the restaurant as well. We have never had a negative experience."}
{"text":"The happiest happy hour in Phoenix.  They have a HUGE selection of DELICIOUS (and veg-friendly) happy hour food and great wine specials.  I think I got 2 apps and a glass of wine for under $10 one time.  Seriously.  Seriously.    Plus the patio is gorgeous!  I actually just convinced myself that I need to go here after work today.  I would give it more stars if I could. :)"}
{"text":"Ordered take out. Delivery was timely, and delivery person was great. We had the lavish turkey wrap, chicken shawarma and jalape√±o hummus. Wrap was good, wife passed on the chicken shawarma. Hummus was good."}
{"text":"Great food experience and variety .. no complaints great customer service and quality"}
{"text":"I've never had a bad meal at Pita Jungle.  It is always fresh and delicious. I have moved on from the Lavosh Schwarma and now in love with the Salmon burger.  The cilantro pinto beans they serve on the side are a meal on their own.   The ice tea is delicious and they do a great happy hour. What more can you ask for? The service is amazing and bartenders are friendly. I love this location!"}
{"text":"I have ate at this Pita Jugnle over 100 times. I love it, I loved it when it was a one room order at the counter spot and I love its expanded full blown restaurant. The food is great, my favorites.. Baba ganoush, hummos, lavash schwarma, caribbean salad and the glazed chicken pizza. The herbal (I think passion) ice tea is also great. I read through many of these reviews and I can honestly say I have never had bad service here, I even frequent the place during lunch when it is packed and still have good service."}
{"text":"Pita Jungle has always been a valley favorite for me. The  Lavosh Chicken Schwarma is one of the tastiest med fresh meals I've had for lunch. This location is ok, the staff is friendly if a little forgetful at times.   The happy hour is where it's at: From 3-6pm they do $1-5 tapas. Some of the menu items include hummus, baba, garlic dip, lemon chicken, mussels and shrimp. Also $1 off beer and wine.  A happy hour that starts at 3? Now that'smy kind of spot."}
{"text":"Pita Jungle has always been one of my favorite restaurants in Tempe. Yes they have them all over the valley now, but it was the OG location on Apache that started my love affair. Obviously the delicious lavosh schwarma wanted to be closer to my work so he moved to Mill and University so I could enjoy him daily. If I feel like changing it up the portabella burger is always delicious and let us not forget the best damn hummos I've ever tried (any of the multiple varieties).    The new location is beautiful -  it has a huge open dining room spray painted by what looks like your cooler older brother. It has a couple different bars for those in a rush and an area for take out. I didn't get to see the multiple patios (updates to follow) so I will have to come back and eat a falafel in the sunshine.  They happy hour starts at 3pm and includes tons of menu items starting at $3  The new urban hip Mill location just goes to show that some good things never change - food and service were exceptional as always. Lunch on Mill just got sooo much better!"}
{"text":"Mouth. Watering. That is what happens every time I come to PJ. I love everything on the menu. Well, everything I've had, anyway, Which is a lot. Let's see...the chicken shawarma, beef gyro, hummus and grilled chicken, lavosh pizza, dolmades, chicken pasta salad, pesto lavosh turkey wrap...yeah. Its all good. I could eat a bucket of their hummus every day. My company caters from them a lot and it is everyone's favorite place that we order from. If I could burrow myself into a beef gyro and sleep there, I probably would."}
{"text":"I love, love, love Pita Jungle. Always have. Was stoked when they opened their DR location, now this one. But....but. I feel like there's been a change since the first time I went to a Pita Jungle and when I went today. Same great menu, I think the food still tasted great, but I didn't feel the same sort of energy or enthusiasm or...something...that I have felt before when I've been to PJ. I came here during a busy lunch hour, and I truly felt like just another customer that they wanted to rush out the door. Our server was fine, but not great. The food was reliable, but there was no pizzazz like I have seen and felt before. Also, this location is very small and the tables were cramped. I could barely hear my table mate because it was so loud. The need to invest in some soundproof something, because it is way too noisy in there. I will come back because it is so close to work, but I just didn't \"feel\" that something special I have felt before."}
{"text":"Pita Jungle is possibly my favorite restaurant ever. Everrrrrrr. It's hard to get it wrong. The food is all just so delicious. This time I opted for the Mediterranean chicken salad. I normally go with the curry chicken salad which is my fave. My friend and I shared the cilantro jalape√±o hummus. They only brought out one pita, waaah! The salad was nice and big. Green tea always good and drink cup full. Service friendly. The seating could have been better, there just wasn't enough of it and the high top sat too many people. Very kid friendly which is appreciated."}
{"text":"I love Pita Jungle but am not a fan of this location. The server my girlfriends and I had was very pretentious. The hummus is one of my favorites and we ordered that with some veggies, and they charged extra for some cucumber slices? Wow. I also tried something new this time, which was the lavosh chicken wrap. The chicken was dry and overcooked. Maybe more garlic sauce would have helped a little? I sure do love that sauce. Almost ordered a side of tzatziki to make it taste better, but the server was no where to be found for about 15 minutes so I just finished my meal otherwise it would have gotten cold. ALSO! We got here at 5:30 for happy hour, but apparently their HH ends at 5:30, not 6:00 like I thought the website said. Each location's HH ends at a different time. Just a heads up."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible, got here they said it would be a 5 min wait I saw over 5 open tables, after 20 minutes of waiting I finally got seated then it took our waitress 5 min to ask us for or drink order and food order rushing us, got food in about 15 minutes, horrible food, got a chicken pita - over stuffed with lettuce and tomatoes, chicken was cold, and way too much sauce, told waitress she said it was because of the veggies! my girlfriend got a philly pita, not hot at all and no veggies in it! My daughter kids meal was probably the best but still not hot, this place can't get out hot and fresh if I could do 0 starts I would, this place needs new management and a new chef"}
{"text":"This was my first time eating at pita jungle. I went during the lunch hour and ordered the Mediterranean chicken pita. The atmosphere of the restaurant was upbeat and charming. The food was flavorful and the portions were large for the price of the dish and the service staff was attentive and gave off a very welcoming vibe  I would definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"I love Pita Jungle! The gyro is my favorite with hummus. The cauliflower is awesome too and any of the hummus on there own is great! They also have really nice and healthy choices for kids too, which is great. All too often healthy restauranta don't always appeal to kids. So great place lunch, dinner or take out! Yummy!"}
{"text":"My family is middle eastern, very familiar with this type of food.  First of all I ordered fish.... NO idea what kind of fish as it was tasteless (very small piece) under that was jalape√±o hummus ( also no taste other than a little bit of heat)....served with 4 pita chips that were under the hummus and soggy!!  That's it for $14!!!!  The Other meal was chicken, it was so dry you couldn't swallow it.... served with rice and beans mixed together, rice very soggy and beans under cooked, 1/4'd tomatoes that were NOT cut fresh, maybe a quarter of a red onion just tossed in.... & a piece of pita, cold and stale!! Which at least the bread should be fresh as it's called Pita Jungle for crying out loud!!  Will NOT EVER go back to this location ever again, if to ANY of them!!  The chicken dinner was $12!  NEITHER of these meals were worth buying, way over priced for the quality of food!! FREE would have been too much!!"}
{"text":"Have been to Pita Jungle twice before. Feel the wait staff do a good job. Always friendly and good service. Best hummus in town. For s dollar more get the bigger plate of hummus but ask for extra pitas (39 cents each) and some extra cucumbers and tomatoes (99 cents). Not a fancy place but certainly someplace you want to try out."}
{"text":"Wow, where do I start. I miss this place....   The Hummus is the best!  The pizza is great!  The Wraps are to die for!!!!!!  The ONLY thing here I do not enjoy here are the falafels.   I wish they had there out here in LA, maybe one day:)"}
{"text":"Everything on the menu is great - especially the salmon, garlic dip, chicken hummus, and walnut baklavah."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service, second time ordering take out from them and they need new employees. The 4 stars is for the food because its delicious!!!"}
{"text":"I've eaten at this Pita Jungle many times and never seemed to be completely satisfied.  The food is ok and there are so many other choices for Greek food that serve a better appetizing meal.  I'm confused about what the management's idea of having the front of the house staff wear just about anything they choose.  I like the idea of trying to be urban, hip, and trendy, but not sold on the abercrombie/skater look as a substitute.  Honestly most of the attire I've seen here seems to be more like what a young teenage slob would choose.  Otherwise this place isn't a horrible place to eat at.  Food is decent to good at best, decor is pretty cool, portions are large, and prices are about average.  For a chain this is a little better than most and the concept helps it stand out from others as well.  I'll be back, but I know I won't fall in love with Pita Jungle."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant! the food is super good and I ALWAYS get the BEST service!! Jordan is super helpful and nice!! I definitely recommend this place to anyone!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely disgusting! Ordered the chicken shawarma bowl and it came out Cold,Soggy and Bland literally 5 minutes after I ordered. They just threw in reheated chicken which wasn't even reheated properly. Even the brown rice wasn't warm, how difficult can that be to get right? Came with big expectations and was a severe let down."}
{"text":"Really loved this place..we'd go sit out on the patio for veg eats with our pup. However, they stopped allowing dogs on the patio. Dog lovers Beware: no longer welcome here :("}
{"text":"If you are a sweatpant wearing, wait a few days between hair washing, don't use a blow dryer or styling product type of person, you might feel out of place at this Pita Jungle. Most the people that work here are close to supermodel skinny, and decked out to the nines like they are working in Scottsdale at some hipster clothing store for celebrities. They also don't know how to smile often, and won't do anything unless you ask them to.   We tried the jalapeno hummus, it was flavored so strongly that the base was masked entirely. For what it was we enjoyed it. We also ordered the falafel and dolmades. Falafel was very nutty, almost flax tasting. Dolmades were meatless and served cold, they had good flavor but were very mushy.   I ordered the chicken pasta salad and I'm not exaggerating at all when I say almost half a pound of pasta was brought to me in a bowl with a few strips of grilled chicken on top. It mentioned that it was served with a lemon vinaigrette. All I tasted was bland pasta and chicken. I asked a passing waiter for an extra cup of this so called vinaigrette, and after I added some on my own it was finally a whole dish.   We asked for boxes to take our leftovers and our waitress brought them out along with the check. I was debating whether or not we should ask for a bag to put the boxes in, and figured if she offered we would take one, if not we'd go without. I won't say much about her except I think she may have missed her daily cup of joe.   The most positive experience we had all night was the lovely woman slash busser that came by our (VERY SMALL) table and offered to push the one next to us alongside ours to give us more top space. It was less than an hour to closing time so the place had emptied quite a bit. Then as we were leaving she asked if we wanted a bag for our leftovers, and also if we wanted a to go cup for our (expensive) lemonade. What a sweet heart! If she had been our waitress I'm sure this review would be 5 stars. But it was obvious she didn't have the \"looks\" or \"body\" required of servers at this establishment. We made sure to give her a $2 tip discreetly when she gave us our drink.   A part of me only wants to eat from Pita Jungle's menu again if we order take out and enjoy it at home."}
{"text":"I love pita jungle. They have great food! And good service too. This is a pretty big location with a bar and outdoor seating. They hummus, chicken and Greek pitas and delicious! I highly recommend the cilantro jalape√±o hummus with chicken."}
{"text":"I will start by saying that I normally LOVE Pita Jungle, so it disappoints me to only give this Downtown location 2 stars.  With 2 kids (under 3) in tow, I was meeting my best friend for a quick lunch downtown. We sat outside to enjoy the weather and keep my kids happy. It took almost 15 minutes for a server to even acknowledge me - despite my telling the hostess after 10 minutes, and trying the flag down the server who kept going out of his way to ignore me. Finally I was able to flag down another waitress, and give her our full order, so that it would arrive by the time my friend got off work.  The lunch rush was over, so I didn't expect our food  to take longer than 15 minutes. We ordered a fruit salad (the Carribean), a Lavosh Chicken Schwarma Wrap, and a kids meal. THIRTY minutes had passed and our food was still not out. My friend literally had 10  minutes to eat before she had to be back in court.  The only thing they were quick about was taking my friend's credit card.  The 2 stars was because the food was delicious as usual, but this was the worst experience I have ever had at a restaurant for lunch. So disappointed.  I really hope they step up their game. Next time I will go back to the Desert Ridge or Arrowhead location. Much better service/experience."}
{"text":"Went out with some friends, please be advise if you plan on sitting outside make sure you have a flashlight as there are no lights outside and it is had to see or even read the menu.  The outside sitting was packed, felt like a sardine.  too many tables way too close to others.  The food was just okay, nothing great - my chicken was way dry along with the pitas which had no taste.  The cucumber saw was good along with the salad.  Had to wait a while for our waitress, not good to go if the place is busy, service not good.  Just okay."}
{"text":"my fav place to eat. I go there every year for my Birthday with my mom, I take my bestie when she comes to visit, great atmosphere, food is delicious, I love the hummus and gyros, pitas are fantastic, wish i could find those exact pitas at the store! Their tea is my fav. The honey past with grilled veggies and chicken is to die for!! I can't say I have ever had a bad meal there. FABULOUS!!!"}
{"text":"I've eaten at this location twice. The first time I got a falafel to go. I thought the cilantro was a bit much for the falafel, it wasn't what I've been used to in the past. I like a milder basic falafel. Today I had a shawarma pita and it was really good. A little heavy on the red onions so next time I plan to ask for no onions! The price is great for the amount of good you get. My pita's are always loaded up."}
{"text":"Excellent!!!! I love their tahini cauliflower and their gyro with roasted potatoes. Their spanakopita is great too. They have coloring pages for kids. Plus it's loud enough that I'm not worried about my daughter being a little loud. The prices are fantastic."}
{"text":"First off, I LOVE Pita Jungle food and experience.  This location continues to slide in quality and service, however, to the point it's now on the \"no-go\" list.  :(  We went in about 3 months ago, and the service was dismissive and curt.  The food was lacking in the normally consistent high quality.  But, we took it as a bad day, and went back yesterday.  Again, we love the food.  :)  However, this day confirms the place is off the mark entirely.  We ordered the appetizer platter...food was good, however, the pita's were clearly microwaved, and therefore, got hard as a rock before you could finish it.  Fresh is no longer the rule here, apparently.  :(  We both had gyros, which were also lacking.  The meat was super salty - and BF agreed, which says a lot, since he favors food that is well-seasoned and isn't as salt-sensitive as I am.  My pita was also going stale by the time I was at the end of the wrap.  Lastly, the server totally mischarged my credit card.  She undercharged us $15 on a $30 lunch, and because I am honest to a fault, I brought it to her attention.  No apology, no great thanks, either.  She went off to recharge the card, muttering something about how she wanted to see what she did wrong.  I told her to just charge the card the remaining amount.  Instead, she brought me back a new slip for the actual total.  I asked her for the cancellation on the original slip, and she said it wasn't required.  Not sure why I have this niggling feeling I was double-charged.    Regardless, overall, a lousy experience,  We'll stick with the PJ at Fashion Square."}
{"text":"Usually love this restaurant. The service is always great but to my surprise there were very few options to modify for gluten free options.  The server was not very helpful in providing options so I sort of made my own meal and it did not taste the best. We had a lot of modifications on my friends order and warned the server to possibly write it down as she was doing the order from memory. Unfortunately the order came out completely wrong."}
{"text":"I've dined at Pita Jungle several times, and it seems as if they can do no wrong.  It had been quite a while since my last visit, and I've become far more diet conscious, which made my most recent visit an absolute delight.  Back in my carb whore days, I used to always order Pasta, which were always impressive, but on my recent visit, I went for the Mahi Mahi with Pita Chips.  INCREDIBLE.  I am fairly sure this was one of the best prepared examples of fish to ever cross my lips.  Flavor and texture were exquisite.  It was served over a ridiculously flavorful cilantro-jalepeno hummos, along with some pea sprouts, and pita chips on the side.  The presentation was also quite nice for such a moderately priced, casual restaurant, too. I guess my only slight annoyance was that the fish is served on TOP of the hummus.. since it's such a tender, flaky fillet, it did have the tendency to get lost in the hummus. A very minor, detail. The whole thing was absolutely delicious, the iced tea was delicious, server was *fantastic*, and I had an extremely enjoyable meal with my dining partner."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of Pita Jungle..... just not this location.  We went in after my son's surgery across the street not too long ago, and I was a little disappointed by the layout, chintzy/crafty bathroom and wall decor, and the surprisingly lame server we got.  Next time (hopefully there won't be one like this for me anytime soon), I'd prefer to drive a few miles to either the original location on Apache/Dorsey or to the one at Dobson/Ray if it's still there."}
{"text":"Here's another review that is far too late.  I've been a regular at Pita Jungle for well over 15 years, countless friends have worked there, and I've even gone to holiday parties at the home of one of the owners.  These guys are a Tempe mainstay, in my opinion -- particularly this location, which is the original.  I'm pretty sure the menu has changed very little in all the time I've gone to Pita Jungle (except for about 10 years ago when they opened the Chandler restaurant and got a beer/wine license -- had to add some more dinner appropriate fare), but this is okay with me.  Anymore, I'm almost always happy with the Mediterranean platter or the chicken schwarma platter.  Sometimes I'll change it up, but I always get the hummus.  Great hummus.  Seriously."}
{"text":"Had amazing cilantro jalape√±o humus with chicken and Greek pitas. The humus is fresh and the Greek pitas are soft and perfect (make sure you order Greek Pitas). Love this place!"}
{"text":"Big portions. Decent price. Taste is okay.  The happy hour is a rip off, however. It's very little and doesn't taste wonderful."}
{"text":"I really enjoy Pita Jungle.  This is another one of our go-to spots.  Food is always fresh and good.  Service is also good.  Food is reasonably priced and you can make it a longer casual dinner, or short and easy dinner--your preference.  Try the quesidilla, mediterranean salad, and the nachos.  Food: 4 Service: 4 Ambiance: 3"}
{"text":"Very Good! Went for lunch today, 1PM. The place was extremely busy with a 10 minute wait for a table, but the wait was worth it. Service was fast (once we were seated), and the ambiance on the lakeside patio was quite relaxing.  I had the Beef Gyro, while my wife had the burrito pita. We both enjoyed them immensely.   Looks to have a full bar & a menu that will satisfy carnivores or herbivores.  Healthy food, and good service. Worth a short wait for seating. Might have to add this to my weekly repertoire.  Other note: Parking lot is ALWAYS busy at lunch, you may have to park out a bit and hoof it."}
{"text":"I had to ask for silverware, my beer took 8 minutes to get to me with an empty bar, my kids chocolate milk took 12 minutes. Kid couldn't stomach the Mac & Cheese, his favorite. My food was great but my kids wasn't and the service was very lack luster."}
{"text":"Pita Jungle is my favorite restaurant on the west side.  I was really surprised when I went in for the first time and the restaurant was a comfortable sit-down place with local art hanging on the walls, a trendy staff, and large menu.  The service is really good and food comes out very quickly.  Not only is the food delicious but you can tell the ingredients are a higher grade than most restaurants.  For example the feta cheese is always fluffy and the veggies are crisp.  The portions are also very generous.  My favorite thing to get here is the Pesto Turkey Lavosh.  Its a big wrap and I usually save the second half for my next meal.  It comes with a classic greek salad.   Also, their garlic potatoes are awesome!"}
{"text":"Pita Jungle is legit. I spontaneously stopped in for a to-go dinner since I was too lazy to cook for myself during Finals Week. The hostess recommended I try the Spicy Chicken Wrap and some other items but I decided to go with the wrap. Oh man oh man oh man it was DELICIOUS. There were vegetables, rice, and chicken and the sauce on it was like crack! So good. I had been warned that it was a large wrap but I didn't think it would be as large as it was. It was probably the size of a ginormous burrito that you get from one of the hole-in-the-wall places. I'm pretty sure I got 3-4 meals out of that one wrap. So good and tasty.  I now want to go back and actually eat in the restaurant itself and try all of the other yummy things on the menu. The interior looks pretty cool and pretty fancy so I want to go back and get the full Pita Jungle experience. I at least need to go back and try all their hummus plates. I love hummus. Can't wait until my next visit!"}
{"text":"Love their mediterranean salad and the humus plates.  The place has been around a while so it is not as new, but the food is still delicious.  Staff are very friendly.  We like to come here for lunch or dinner at least once a week."}
{"text":"Let's be real here, shall we?  This is a place to come drink and girl watch.  The ladies that work here are good looking and the service is sufficient.  Otherwise ---   Bastardized Mediterranean food catering to indiscriminating taste buds.  The use of the word pita implies Mediterranean or Middle Eastern fare but the menu offers more...much more....and a lot of it tastes like crap that was made up on a whim.  Some of the dishes don't make sense to me, at least palate wise.  The ingredients are juxtaposed nonsensically.  Take the Gambas Con Ajo.  Served with pesto?  It simply doesn't work.   A waste of space on the menu.  My friend concurred that it wasn't good - at all.  When I queried the bartender---Kat Von D's doppelg√§nger--- if Pita Jungle was a hybrid restaurant, she looked at me as if I'd just dropped in from another planet.  Having lived on the highly cultured east coast for a number of years, this kind of food snobbery is permanently ingrained.  I am particular about the authenticity of my food, so if you have a hankering for Meditteranean, look elsewhere.  Probably somewhere very far outside of Phoenix, perhaps even a neighboring state (hint - Cali 4 Ni A).  In fact, to categorize Pita Jungle as Meditteranean is a misnomer.  Arizona was voted as one of the least educated states, second in line to Nevada.  Don't get me wrong as I love Arizona; however, we as a nation should do our best to help bring them out of their educational rut.  Chicken Tikka Masala?  Last time I checked, India is a part of the continent of Asia.  [Yes, I'm being an uptight jackass.  Sorry.]"}
{"text":"I love this place. I love the food. I love the service. My kids love the food, and my picky eater enjoys the kids plate with food she can pick herself!"}
{"text":"This place is definitely one of our favorite spots. The staple foods of this restaurant are definitely the gyro and hummus with pita bread but we've never had anything disappointing. The Gambas Con Ajo is amazing! The Mediterranean chicken salad and tabouli are also really tasty, fresh, healthy dishes. Actually, pretty much everything on the menu is fresh and healthy, which is one of the reasons we eat there so much.    The ambiance and customer service cannot be beat! They feature different artists' work and the rest of the d√©cor has a comfortable, artistic feel as well. They pull of a high-end feel without the atmosphere being uncomfortable. It's perfect for a dressy date night or casual lunch. They also have a really nice outdoor seating area that faces a small lake. The staff are all very personable and even when they are super busy (which is pretty much always because they're so awesome!) we get served in a timely manner and our drinks are always refilled."}
{"text":"This was a first for me, trying Mediterranean food.  I was game, but had no idea what to try.  It was suggested I try a Gyro (however you pronounce it, even the serve admitted there are multiple ways to say it so I still don't know lol).  The one I had was beef and lamb.  I don't think I have ever had lamb either ( hey we eat beef in Texas).  The meats were heavily seasoned.  No idea with what, it was almost overpowering, I sure couldn't get a taste of the meat.  I don't know if this is typical r not.  It wasn't bad and was even good, but just a bit over seasoned for me.  I belched whatever spice they used for the rest of the day.  Also the texture of the meat was something I have never seen before, I can't even describe it but it didn't look like beef or lamb.  As an appetizer we had the avocado hummus with blue corn chips.  Now this was great.  My only complaint was the amount of chips.  We had 5 men at the table and the chips amounted to about the size of the small bags you pack in your lunch for one person.  The taste was great I can't fault that at all and even wish I had some of that right now.  The avocado hummus was creamy and tangy and was perfectly complimented by the blue corn chips.    I would give this another try but I don't live here and there are none where I'm from."}
{"text":"Their food is soo good!! I had the spinach quesadilla and my friend had a dish with chicken and smashed potatoes. Servings are quite generous and our waiter came over multiple times to check on how we were doing and to refill our drinks. I had a great experience here and will come back again and again! :)"}
{"text":"This location is close to my house , we love PJ food , especially ahi tuna salad , but I have to agree with most of the people portions here are way smaller . Salad at Scottsdale location is probably 1-1/2 times larger. They have been stingy on cheese here with 4 cheese quesadillas, we always end up with side pieces barely covered in anything inside. Service has been good at this location."}
{"text":"This is probably a 3.5 star review.  From the outside it looks like a small strip mall restaurant. However, upon entering I was amazed by the amount of available seating, including the vast outdoor area.   I got the Hummus and Grilled Chicken starter plate. I opted for the Cilantro Jalape√±o hummus and was impressed with the taste. However, it could have used a bit more bite (I mean, it is Jalapeno). The amount of hummus was almost overwhelming. It was essentially a tub of hummus on the plate, there was so much. There was no way I could have eaten that much hummus in one sitting. The chicken was also spiced, but again, I found it a little bland.   It appeared that there were so many delicious choices, that I would give this place a number of chances (if I lived there)."}
{"text":"Finally tried this place and really enjoyed it. The chicken shawarma was cooked great. I went to wash my hands and when I returned from the restroom they had given my table away. It was kinda funny."}
{"text":"YUM YUM! Great for lunch and dinner. Chicken pita salad and hummus plate are both so good! Loved everything I have ever ordered from this place! Great gyro, comes with lots of veggies! Definite must-try!"}
{"text":"This meal was simply \"pretty good\". The cilantro hummus with chicken was great. The wood fried chicken was also nice but nothing special. Good experience. Large portions. Fast service"}
{"text":"This is the only restaurant that my work has used in the past 6 months that has gotten our order 100% correct every single time. Extremely reliable, friendly competent staff, and awesome food. You guys rock so hard! I love that they check every piece of food with the food ticket when doing take-out orders, you guys should teach classes on that! Keep it up, you have a loyal customer out of me."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places!!! Sometimes the service is lacking a bit (depending on who serves you) but the food and atmosphere make up for it. I've been to most of the Pita Jungle locations and love them all. Total A+. Only problem is now my standard for fresh, healthy food while dining out is making it hard to enjoy other restaurants!"}
{"text":"I love the cilantro hummus & pita chips here! Always a great snack. The rest of the menu is a little weird. You have to be open to trying new foods.  Most of the people here are friendly with great service. Jackie has been our waitress twice now and she is horrible. I would highly advise avoiding her section."}
{"text":"This is a staple in Arizona. The food is delicious, has lots of different options of types of cuisine and is healthy. They offer terrific small plates, wine, beer and desserts. This location is large and is a frequent meeting spot for business folk hitting a solid lunch spot for lunch or dinner"}
{"text":"Normally love Pita Jungle and have been to several locations but this location (ray & Dobson) was terrible.   Bad service (manager attributed to shift change around 5pm) , took a long time for our food , and food quality was not up to par with other locations .  For whatever reason, this location is lacking in all areas."}
{"text":"Awesome food awesome people awesome place easy going they have a good sense of humor they like to joke"}
{"text":"Had to revise my previous 4-star review and drop off a star today, unfortunately.   Why, you ask? Well, probably because I got a chicken pasta salad with multiple pieces of RAW chicken in it. I'm talking completely raw beneath the first millimeter of meat, not just undercooked and chewy, but physically raw.   I thought it was just this one small piece, which my astute server noticed me picking at (props for the good eye and asking if all was well) but that early warning got me into the habit of checking the other pieces before I bit into them. Thankfully that vigilance saved me from ingesting the other pieces that were completely, utterly raw inside!   The part that really gets me, which I pointed out to the management, is that the chicken was burned black on the outside too, so someone really, really botched what should have been one of the simplest things to cook -chicken breast. I'm no chef, but even I don't screw up chicken breast this badly. How does a trained, paid chef manage to churn out chicken that is burnt black on the outside and still raw on the inside? I would almost imagine you'd have to put a concerted effort into screwing up that badly. This is definitely a first for me. Just... wow.  The manager happily deducted it from our bill and appeared to go back into the kitchen and give someone grief over it, which is nice, but it was still kind of gross to think that, had I not been so careful, I would have ingested raw chicken. He even gave me his card in case I had issues later from eating the food. Not sure if I should be grateful for the card, or worried that this is standard procedure because perhaps it happens often enough. Let's hope the former, yikes!   I love this place, love their tomato soup and the service has seemingly improved in my recent visits, so I really hate to bag on them, but serving me raw on the inside, burnt on the outside chicken isn't something I can stomach (pun intended).   Hopefully things pan out better in the future and I can re-review with more stars, but for now I'm dropping a star and advising folks to take a close look at their chicken if they dine here for lunch."}
{"text":"The food at this location, without exception, has always been some of the best. I've been to a couple Pita Jungle's in and around Phoenix and this was the best.   Sadly, they also have some of the WORST service I have ever seen. Doesn't seem to matter if the place is packed or not, lunch or dinner crowd or just the in-between, you always seem to get slow service.   What's worse than that is the fact that there is no apology for it. My wife and I were regulars and had been going to this place, literally, for a couple of years on an almost weekly basis. More and more, the service began putting us off and recently we had two or three bad experiences in a row and decided to just stop going there altogether.   The servers in question just left our table hanging, despite working the table right next to us, right in front of us and right behind us without missing a beat. A lesser person who didn't always tip heavily would have thought it was deliberate, were it not for the fact that it happened multiple times with one seasoned and one brand new server.   I did bring this to the attention of the owner and he informed me that he only works the day shift now, which means he is never there in the evening when my wife and I used to frequent the place. I suggested he spend some more time on the night shift and get his wait staff in line, but I'm not going to spend any more of my time or money to give them a fourth or fifth chance, they have given me bad service for the last time."}
{"text":"I was pretty excited when this location opened in Norterra and, to be fair, things were great when my family and I first started going to this particular location. The service was good, the food was good and it was our favorite Pita Jungle (we also patronized the Arrowhead location for some time and work near the Desert Ridge location too).   Unfortunately when it comes time to write a review, I can't really say much good about Pita Jungle at Norterra anymore, and that's nothing short of a huge shame. This place had amazing potential and a great location and, despite what some say in other reviews, I actually liked the decor and the ambiance the most at this location. The sour spot for my family and I, unfortunately, has been the steady decline in the quality of both the service and the food itself, the former far more than the latter, which is unfortunate because I can stomach bad food but not bad service.   Where to begin? The servers at this location seem to be stretched not too thin, but too far apart in the tables they work. My family and I have never, never been able to figure out how/why our server also works the bar and a few tables outside and then other times just disappears. This happens regardless of where we sit or what server we have, they all seem to just cavort about and work random tables, rather than having a fixed section. This is funny to me because, on occasion, I've actually been told that there are 'sections' so I wonder what kind of crazy system they have going on. To the casual observer, you'd almost think it was some sort of complete free for all, which I know it's not, but come on. This has been a consistent theme and while it was worst for the tables nearest the bar, by the entrance, it seems to have recently grown to cover the entire floorspace. No matter where my family and I were seated, we always noticed this behavior.   The end result? Poor service. Drinks don't get refilled on time, nobody checks to see if the food is OK right after it comes out, you name it. It's a shame because the servers are always sprinting about from place to place, seemingly with a sense of urgency (which is otherwise desirable) but because there is no order to what they're doing, it's sort of wasted effort. You can run between a bunch of tables but if you can't keep track of which ones are yours, invariably people are left out to dry and that's precisely what happened to us, more times than I can count.   Another thing that irks me is the management at this location. I don't know when it changed, or if people rotate or what, but I think that has something to do with it. I've called to complain maybe 5% of the time I go there, which isn't too bad actually since I've been dozens of times, but the kicker is that nothing ever changed as a result, and that stings even more than the initial bad service itself, at least it does for me. To pretend you don't have a problem when long time customers repeatedly call, that's just asinine. Complaints are down, I am told. I wonder if that's because people got tired of going there and have nothing to complain about since they no longer patronize your establishment.   In any case, I gave this place plenty of second chances, but I have no tolerance for rude staff and zero accountability for poor performance after repeated complaints directly to management. You got more than your fair share of second chances, but you're not getting any fifth or sixth chances out of me. Never going back, even though the manager offered a free meal. There's not enough free food in the world to make me tolerate bad service and food runners who give lip to a customer that has already been wronged by shoddy service and a kitchen mistake. How low class can you get? Avoid this place unless you really want the answer to that question."}
{"text":"I ate here the other night and found everything to be satisfactory. We live fairly close and we were hungry and I had just gotten back from the gym so I didn't want anything too heavy. We sat down and our server greeted us promptly. We ordered a couple drinks, wine for my fianc√© and a beer for me. I originally ordered a purple haze which I was stoked for, but they were out so I settled for a shock top. Can't pass up a $4 draft. My fianc√© was starving and ordered a cup of soup right away, which was a coconut curry of some sort. It came out promptly. And for being a cup it was absolutely massive. Good start. He had a tiki chicken something or other, which our server, recommended. I had the gyro, which I always order. This time I added the garlic potatoes. Everything was really good. I ordered my gyro without pickles because they always put a zillion on, but it came out with pickles. Oh well. I'm not the type to throw a stink. I actually like the flavor of the pickles in there, there are just usually way too many. I just pulled them off and my pickle pile wasn't as big as it usually is there. The potatoes were good. I love garlic, which is a good thing because these are intense. We had the baklava bread pudding for dessert which I've had in the past and this was by far the best one I've had. It took a long time, but we were told it was being made fresh. I could tell for sure that it was fresh and it was absolutely worth the wait. Also. The price sure is right at Pita Jungle. Our bill was $48 all in for 2 alcoholic beverages, a cup of soup, 2 entrees, a big dessert and a 22% tip. So you really can't beat that on a Friday night in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"What Pita Jungle does, it does well. The food and service are consistent. What stands out for this location is how much more comfortable it is (both in the restaurant and in the parking lot) compared to locations on Ray, Shea, Apache Blvd, or Indian School. At this location you can be assured that: 1) you'll find a parking spot immediately 2) your server will pay attention to you (I'm talking to you, Ray location) 3) the next table of people won't be so close that you get elbowed  Pita Jungle has succumbed to the huge portion fad, so order carefully or you'll end up with far more food that you need. I have found that they are willing (especially at this location) to make smaller versions of the dishes, so if you want two pieces of dolma or a half of a fruit platter, just ask.  My favorite dishes are the babaganoush and the falafel. The platters are good but far too big for one person, so find someone to share. This is especially a problem with the fruit and cheese platter, which I refer to as the Matterhorn of fruit. I tried the Chicken Putanesca once; it was good, but too oily and the chicken was a bit dry. The Gambas con Ajo, on the other hand, was excellent, with its spicy marinara and perfectly cooked jumbo shrimp.  This location is always clean, including the bathrooms. There is also a pseudo-bar area (do they serve alcohol?) with a lot of seating, so if you happen to arrive while the restaurant is full, you'll have somewhere nicer than a parking lot to wait."}
{"text":"One of my favorite lunch places. The food is always fresh and healthy. The personal and friendly service is terrific."}
{"text":"Being gluten intolerant, I have found it hard to eat out. Thankfully, Pita Jungle is not only tasty, but the customer service rocks! I came here with a friend around 2pm, looking to split their chicken and hummus plate. Although the pita bread is to die for, I opted for extra veggies. No up-charge, and I was even given extra veggies to go with my left over hummus. Great good, great customer service, and gluten-free friendly is my kind of place."}
{"text":"Good, FAst, Cheap!  the production triangle. in my world your to pick only 2 of the 3....  Here you get it all...  had Chicken and Humus and Pita...delicious!...had to run to my yoga class only had 20min...there where blazing fast....serving was anapitizer but a big serving and under $10 ok so not taco bell cheap but a good value.. (at SAnta monica peir I once had a $25 taco bell bill for only two people! so location is every thing)   Decore- I was really impressed I was afriad i need reservations!  can't wait to go back  edit-the coke was 2.25!  the meal was only 6.75 not sure what i feel about that yet..."}
{"text":"Love Pita Jungle! They have the best grilled chicken breast ever and will not tell me what they marinade it in :O)... all I know is that it takes three days to marinade. I love their broiled chicken salad and hummus (original flavor) appetizer.  My girlfriend and I go there at least once a week! we're both obsessed. It is healthy and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"I love Pita Jungle and am very loyal but this is not the location for me. Too busy and no matter how hard they tried , there were too many people to allow for quality customer service. Food was excellent as always!"}
{"text":"Just got a simple take out.  Observed a busy lunch crowd.  Jalape√±o cilantro humus was outstanding!  Will dine in!  Check it out a lot of fun healthy options!"}
{"text":"Definitely have loved this place ever since I started coming here. They are lively and friendly. A bit more of the \"loud\" category, but if you like a positive healthy atmosphere; this is the place to be. It's a good restaurant to have in the repertoire of places to eat some decently healthy food with large portions. Overall a great place to be!"}
{"text":"Ok last time I came here both of us got sick from the food and it was a train wreck.  This time....  the service was fabulous but they were slow soo the service should have been fabulous.  Let's see if I get sick in a couple hours.  Here's the edit: I didn't get sick this time!  Yay!  It was a 1 off on last time."}
{"text":"Woah! This new location is quite impressive! I was actually extremely surprised when I walked in that I probably made an awkward impression to the hostess!   First off I go to pita about almost 3xs a week, but the one inside the Scottsdale fashion square.  So I didn't know pita jungle was a sit down type of place with a bar! I decided to stop by for a quick yummy bite plus I was craving their hummus trio with chicken on top since the one inside the mall is currently closed for due to renovations, which is taking TOO LONG!!   I was seated in the bar area which by the way I love the bar stools so modern 50s it's absolutely adorable! I ordered the Chicken tikka masala (on of my favorite dishes from there) with a cucumber cocktail, which by the way was super delicious and refreshing!   They have outdoor seating as well I am telling you guys this place is HUGE! The service was great and quick! Everyone was friendly and super happy in there it really creates a really positive atmosphere.   All In all impressed and pita jungle will forever have 5 stars in my book. Their food is just that goo"}
{"text":"I really hope this is the location inside the fashion square mall.   So I am a regular here because hey I work in the mall lol. I love pita jungle and when they closed down for their remodeling I was so sad yet excited to see the new place. What felt like an eternity it finally reopened! But there this HUGE but and I wish I was talking about a good butt. Hehe   Anyway, I really don't like the new concept here. It's so hard to steer away from my regular favorite dishes I used to order, it made me kind of sad when it opened and I saw a subway/chipotle concept. If you're a regular reader of my reviews you know by now I am the most indecisive person on Yelp. I can't even handle big menus yet alone a line up of food for me to build.   When I got in line I got greeted by one of the employees giving me information on the new line up concept. When I asked him if they still had the veggie chili and I hear no come out of his mouth I nearly died (no literally I felt my heart jump out of my body). Don't get me wrong I know they are trying a whole new concept to fit in the food court but as a regular pita jungle-ER I don't like it. It's just too overwhelming!   However I love pita so much I came up w like 3 meals I now switch around on they days I drop by for lunch. I am going to start experimenting a little more maybe I can recreate the veggie chili? Hmmmmm?   Four stars for the new pita because honestly I still love you! LOL (five stars for the old pita)"}
{"text":"I was skeptical at first but holy FLAVOR!!!! I loveeee coming in for the mahi-mahi on jalape√±o hummus. (Or chicken) and a fruit and cheese plate. DELISH! Also great service and sure easy pick up for calling in!"}
{"text":"Friendly and attractive staff, quick service and consistent quality. I would absolutely recommend this location of pita jungle. Try the tea lemonade and the seared ahi tuna and humus dish"}
{"text":"Like Arlin, I'm super happy to see another great place open at Norterra. We went here with another couple and their children. Great menu...and it's really very well appointed. We had some slow service, but I'm attributing this to it being new. They really seem to be trying to get things right. Took a while for our drinks to be refreshed and to place our order-and the seating process seemed to take longer than necessary. I'm sure within a couple of months things will be running smoothly. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Love me some Pita Jungle. The downtown location is nice, I prefer the outside seating. The outside seating is between two buildings so there is no direct sun unless it's lunch time. I've been here a few times now and usually get the combination plate with all the Mediterranean Snacks, the pita or Chicken Marsala.   They have a wonderful happy hour small bite menu too. If you like many flavors, go there for happy hour and order a few tapas."}
{"text":"For a while, I was upset with Pita Jungle because the food wasn't up to par, but recently I've gone back to try other dishes.   Wood-fired Veggie Lavash Wrap is my new favorite. Lavash reminds me of a giant saltine cracker. It's about a 12 inch wrap that's served toasted with a smear of delicious garlic and pesto on the inside and then packed with warm  flavorful eggplant, zucchini, bell peppers, tomatoes, onions.   Also comes with cheese, but - come on! - who needs animal fat in a sandwich like this?  It's yummy, yum yum (sans cheese please) and served with side salad. At a price point of $9.59 this is a definite must-have for eat in or take out.   If you have any left overs though, separate the lavash so that it'll stay crispy. When it's been sitting too long with the juicy vegetables, the inside gets soggy and peels away. The outside will be soft and start to taste the same as if you left crackers in your soup too long.  I always treat myself to extra and order a side of veggies for $4.39. Another good thing is the ratatouille for the same price - a bit oily, but not salty.   Recently, I tried the bak lava dessert for $4.39. Oh dear. No, no, no put that back. Nononono, no no no no nononono. That's a zero for me. Stop that PJ. Stick to your delicious cakes please."}
{"text":"I really wanted to give PJ a better rating, simply for the fact that they offer so many vegetable dishes.  It's a great space with outdoor seating on the corner of 3rd and Roosevelt and although I like the area, I can't take anymore of the low quality servings.    From what other reviewers have stated, maybe this location is bad.  I will try one of the others sometime in the future.  But for now I graded only three stars because:  1.  they put yogurt in the baba ghanouj.  Why?  Eggplant is one of my favorite foods and when made into baba ghanouj I'm expecting to have a vegan dish.  I don't want it thinned out with yogurt.  Yeah I know I'm a cry baby.  Waaahh waaaah waaah!  2.  the cooks use way too much cooking oil on the grilled veggies.  For every one of my veggie orders, I can only manage to eat the morsels sitting on top because the bottom ones are saturated with cooking oil.    I nearly threw up today when I bit into a slice of eggplant on the grilled vegetable salad.  It was a thick slice and cooking oil oozed out of it giving me a mouthful of sliminess. I used about five napkins trying to spit it all out.  The bed of greens on the salad had become translucent due to all the cooking oil settling to the bottom and I didn't even touch them.  Basically, half of my salad went to waste.   3.  they rarely get my order correct the first time.  4.  there are too many wait staffers standing around.  So there, I've said it.  I've bad mouthed the PJ."}
{"text":"I've been to this location a couple of times now and I have to say I really like this place. I like the menu options - there are a lot of choices for those of you that are looking for healthy options. And yes, there are pizzas on here, too (in case you want to go 'rogue'). Some of my favorites:  The Gyro: a better tasting gyro here than what I've experienced elsewhere. The marinated lamb/beef combo works well and it's my regular go-to.  Mediterranean Chicken Salad: this is one amazing salad. Order this one only if you have a large appetite. I can put down a lot of food, but the portion size of this one even challenges me. Grilled chicken, tomatoes, onions, roasted bell peppers, cilantro, pine nuts, cucumbers, corn, raisins and taboule over mixed greens with feta cheese and lemon vinaigrette. Yum.  Mahi Mahi w/Pita Chips: a recent favorite. Wood-fired Mahi Mahi served with cilantro-jalapeno hummus. Served with pea sprouts, pico de Gallo and pine nuts along with pita chips. Amazing flavors.  Service here has always been good. A shout out to our server Donna, who really stays on top of everything and always ensures we get \"to go\" ice tea's!"}
{"text":"They have anything from salads, pitas, wraps, burgers, and wood fired pizzas.  Although this isn't a 100% plant-based restaurant they pride themselves on having many vegan options.  Not only are there options, but upon visiting their site I found a table of what items are vegan, what aren't, and what makes them non-vegan (which is always nice to know). Great to have so many vegan options that are spelled out on their website.    We expected a counter-service experience but were pleasantly surprised when we entered to find it was an actual sit-down restaurant.  The vibe was a classy yet laid back, youthful feel.  Most of the servers were high school or college age and wore regular street clothes (think Urban Outfitters style).  I loved the laid back atmosphere of the servers even though it's a sit-down experience and really enjoyed the color scheme and tin plated ceiling.  The food was absolutely FANTASTIC.  Oh my. For an appetizer we selected the garlic dip with two pitas.  The garlic dip is a mix of olive oil, lemon juice, fresh garlic, and smashed potatoes.  If you love garlic, you'll love this.  My husband chose the Falafel Pita which was topped with cilantro and spices, mixed greens, tomatoes, onions, pickles and tahini.  He was very happy with his choice, although next time he'd ask for no onions.  I went with the Veggie Garden Wrap that included zucchini, broccoli, cauliflower, eggplant, yellow squash, carrots, onions, tomatoes, brown rice, mixed beans, ginger, herbs and garlic.  One thing we quickly found was that our entrees were HUGE.  This is not a complaint in anyway.  However, next go around we may share an entree.  Either way, this visit, we had leftovers to take home for lunch the next day.   Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Was really looking forward to eating here again. Unfortunately, after waiting seven minutes without being acknowledged by the staff I decided to leave.   Place wasn't busy as peak lunch hour had passed and it was well staffed.  If it were busy I'd say no big deal it happens but I can't sit at my table and watch 5 different servers pass my table without a greeting.   I'm in the minority but I'll pass.    After being contacted by management about my review I'm upgrading to 3 stars. I will return and hopefully I'll be able to give a proper review based on not only the service but also the food. It's nice to see that management cares and acted immediately. I don't like writing nasty reviews especially for restaurants and businesses. It was a disappointing visit today but credit to them for making it right. As a customer it really is all I can ask.  Thanks Pita Jungle"}
{"text":"Great food and great service! We visit here often. My favorite is the spicy chicken lavish pizza, Greek salad, or the Philly chicken pita"}
{"text":"I've always loved eating at Pita Jungle on Scottsdale and Shea.  As some other reviewers have already noted, this particular location doesn't have the same feel to it because of its \"Trying-too-hard-to-be-modern\" atmosphere.  I was shocked on how loud the hyper-paced music was, and how non-intimate the seating felt.  Since I like the food so much, I'll continue to patronize the Scottsdale location...even though I live so close to this Happy Valley one.  Also, the staff seemed far less \"mature\" with their mannerism.  Even the older waitresses dressed and talked like they were still in High school...very gross."}
{"text":"I placed a large order for a graduation party. It was assembled and ready at the appointed time. All of my guests enjoyed the falafel, tabouli, dolmades etc. The chocolate covered baklava was superb. Kudos for loading it all in my car.   Besides being a healthy choice their menu never disappoints.   BRAVO!!"}
{"text":"Consistently great food. Tabbouli, and hummus are excellent. Try the avocado hummus for a taste explosion. The wait staff is helpful explaining menu items, but be sure to try Mediterranean chicken salad."}
{"text":"Okay so Pita Jungle opened Jan. 18th and I've been twice in one week. The first time my husband and I went for lunch. The place was packed!! The decor is very nice and modern. I only have one issue regarding the decor. No one factored in where a lady would place her purse while dining. The chairs don't have a typical back where a purse can hang on the side and there are no wall hooks so I was forced to place my purse on the floor. Please fix this problem. Thank you:)  Husband and I each ordered a cup of coconut curry soup. While tasty it was warm not hot. We were disappointed with the soup. For my entree I went with the salmon burger. FANTASTIC!!! The patty was well seasoned, moist and delicious. It took quite a while for our food to arrive, to make up for the long wait they gave us a complimentary dessert. The carrot cake is so good. I've had it before and it never disappoints me.  Today's visit was again at lunch time. The Friday crowd is different from the Tuesday crowd. LOTS of mommies with babies and little kids. I'm not a kid person so I tend to notice things like that. I ordered the entree red quinoa salad with mixed greens and jalapeno cilantro hummus. The salad was delicious. Since it was listed under entrees I thought the portion would have been bigger. Also, since red quinoa is the name of the salad you would think there would be a lot of quinoa, not the case. Surprisingly little quinoa in this salad. My girlfriend ordered the same salad, but she got chicken with hers so her meal was more substantial then mine. I would get that salad again and soup to go with it so long as it's hot.  All in all a pleasant experience each time. There are some kinks that still need to be worked out with a new staff. I have no doubt in a short time they will be running like a well oiled machine. I have to give a special shout out to Kayla who was my waitress both times and both times she was outstanding. I love forward to returning."}
{"text":"I took two of my girlfriends for one of those \"lets grab a bite before the movie\" lunches and planned to order my usual hummus and grilled chicken. Instead the waiter started listing the specials which included a lot of terms like \"flavor profiles\" and \"siracha sauce\" The three of us were so mesmerized by his descriptions that we abandoned our menus and told him to bring us whatever he wanted. We proceeded to savor the most amazing flavors and gorgeous presentations imaginable and by the end of the meal we were all in a foodie daze. None of us even thought about getting popcorn at the movie! Not sure what is going on in the kitchen a PJ, these days, but I like it. If you keep this up, you may need to start using tablecloths..."}
{"text":"To think my boyfriend and I were so excited to come to pita jungle today....    The hostess sat us on the patio as we requested, but no one greeted us, so we had to move inside to get served.    As an appetizer, we had a plate of the cilantro jalepe√±o and the original hummus. I ordered a side of veggies for dipping- they were frozen, which made them a little painful to chew. Besides the veggies, our appetizer was great!   We asked our waitress for more tea, but since she forgot, our empty glasses sat at the edge of the table while she walked by multiple times.    As our entree, my boyfriend ordered the philly steak pita and I ordered the broiled chicken pita.   He received his philly steak pita, which tasted great and I received a chicken philly pita.    We told our waitress that I had ordered a different pita, and she said, \"Okay you can have this one for free while you wait for the new one.\" Before I could respond to tell her that we don't want the pita, she walked away   No apology.     My boyfriend finished his entire lunch before I received mine, and since we no longer had time to stay, we asked for a to go box as soon as we were handed the correct pita.   I would now have to eat my lunch alone at home.    Our waitress said, \"Do you want a to go box for the chicken philly too?\"   -I asked him if he wanted it, he said no- So I said, \"Neither of us like the chicken philly, so no thank you.\"  Not believing MY response, she then looked over at my boyfriend and said, \"Really? You're not going to eat that? It's almost the same thing that you ordered except with chicken!\"  I said, \"A chicken and a cow are completely different animals. He does not want the chicken.\"  She said, \"I guess that's true.\" And walked away   (What on earth just happened?!)  No apology.   She brought us our check with no discount.   Still no apology.   Never coming to this location again."}
{"text":"I had takeout so this is tricky based on food.. Poor. My falafel was over cooked and dry, some of my lettuce was bad and I had barely any sauce on my pita. My pita chips were just pita slices  drenched in grease. Won't go back"}
{"text":"I am a fan of Pita Jungle. Now that the weather is warming up I love sitting outside under the covered patio.Our server Elizabeth was very sweet and did a great job. All wait staff were helpful with a good attitude. Our order in fact arrived promptly. The Greek salad with feta that melts in your mouth was to die for...super fresh and perfectly seasoned."}
{"text":"I don't know where they get the pickles that go in the beef Gyro's but I cannot get enough.  So yummy, I always ask for more.  This place takes me out of the desert and puts me in a much more hip city.  I absolutely love the Tsatziki, full of garlic that you are protected from vampires but cannot kiss another human being until you do a thorough mouth clean up.  Still worth it.  Bad for first date.  Go here.  Eat here.  Your will be pleased.  If not, there might be something wrong with YOU!"}
{"text":"I used to love this place, but that's because I was a teenaged vegetarian without a car or the good sense to go into a restaurant that wasn't staffed by hipsters and next to a killer record store. The food is not bad, but it's so boring. They have seven ingredients, yet 45 dishes. The hummus is palatable, but by no means would it register as a \"good\" hummus.   I used to think the fetoush salad was enough for 3 portions, too, until I realized that fetoush does not keep. The \"fetoush\" part of it is the delicious croutons, if I'm not mistaken. If forced to eat here again, I'd try to get someone to split that with me, with maybe the salmon. If you are eating here because you are on a diet, get the waiter to bring you cucumbers and tomato slices with your inevitable hummus or baba ghanoush order. Don't waste time on the pita pizzas, they are glorified cheese crisps, which you can get (accompanied by a good, stiff margarita) at Fez. Ordering delivery from here feels like getting robbed by a grocer, the food is so simple. Good? Bad? Eh.  I do really love their stuffed grape leaves, but they are not the most popular dish (no one else I know likes them), so I would not try them unless you have a history of loving pickled/sour/savory things to your own painful detriment. Split tongue, etc."}
{"text":"Ahwatukee we scored!  Yes, a Pita Jungle in our own neighborhood!  Went tonight with husband and some friends, the food AMAZING, the service, EXCELLENT!  A special thank you to Tanisha our server!  She made some great recommendations and answered all our needs tonight!  Welcome to the neighborhood Pita Jungle!"}
{"text":"Pita Jungle is a great place to get inexpensive Mediterranean food (as long as you don't mind a bit of a wait).  The food usually gets served up really fast, but then your waiter leaves and -never comes back-.  I'm not ususally a stickler for outstanding wait service, but I do like to get my glass refilled and be given my check in a timely manner.  Never-the-less, the food is so good it makes up for any other flaws."}
{"text":"Does not compare to all the other Pita Jungles. This place consistently delivers on a low level. The \"fresh\" ingredients in their salads have been prepared days before it ever gets sold- the onions are translucent and soggy, the lettuce is brown and cracking- if not wet and rotting- The dressings are even older. Take a point, if you are going to make a dressing ahead of time, don't put the lemon juice in till the last minute. The dressing is borderline rancid. Gross. The service is terrible every time. The only nice person in the building is the girl with long blonde hair at the bar."}
{"text":"One of scottsdales best places to get a salad and cup of soup. Food is fresh and the salads are hand made to order."}
{"text":"Located in the food court on the lower level.. this place is always busy and the employees are fast!!  They offer the basics .. salads, bowls, wraps .. pick a protein, five fresh toppings (mushroom, cucumber, tomato, bell pepper,corn, etc) and a sauce..  They have three salads from the original menu and soup.. the soup and whatever special is listed on the chalk board.. today they have Ahi Poke bowls   The unsweetened ice teas are delicious and the large is 28oz ..   Not the cheapest place to eat in this food court but the food is yummy and fresh.."}
{"text":"I thoroughly enjoyed this place from start to finish. The food was great. The drinks average and the service was exceptionally friendly. The humus platter appetizer was fantastic. Highly recommend. The Gyro was also fantastic. Again, highly recommend. The cilantro jalape√±o humus was my favorite part. Will I go again? Yes! Can't wait!"}
{"text":"I really love Pita Jungle.  My first experience was at the one downtown, and now, I have to get my fix.  I found this location since it is close to my home, and wanted to check it out.  Upon entering, I was pleased with the location.  Well decorated, clean, good lighting, ample seating.  I was greated by the hostess, and sat at the bar.  The place was pretty busy, and I was by myself.  I was greeted in a quick manner by a nice server from behind the bar.  I took a moment to review my menu, and decided to skip a full meal and go for some lentil soup.  Now, here is where things get dicey.  I won't hold it against Pita Jungle, but I have to put this in the review.  First, after being seated, I noticed that it was a little toasty in there.  I think they could have turned up the A/C.  I am sure if I had been drinking, I probably would have broken a slight sweat, as it was warm in here.    Secondly, after I ordered my lentil soup, it took what seemed like forever to get it.  I did not time it with a stop watch, but it took a long time for just a bowl of soup.  Secondly, when I did get the lentil soup, I didn't care for it.  It looked kinda gross and didn't taste all that great.  And, in case you were wondering, NO, I didn't send it back or complain.  I was to tired and didn't feel like being a sourpuss.  The other problem that I experienced, was the server girl brought out my check WAY before I was ever served my food.  I hate that!  At least bring my bill with my food, not before!  Aside from that, I dig this place."}
{"text":"I really like having a pita jungle close to my house!  I ate here last night for dinner, and it was tasty as always.  I ordered my 'usual' pita, the gyro.  yummy!  Service was wonderful.  My server was kind, and recommended a few things to try that were made with gyro meat, after I told him that I don't think I mix it up enough sometimes.  They have a seperate bar area here, and its off to the side.  Seating is open, spacious, clean and looks like all the other pita jungles that I have been too.  Tasty as always!"}
{"text":"I had dinner last night for the first time at this place, and I have to say that I really really liked it a lot!  Upon entering the location, I was impressed with how it was set up.  Clean, nice, with lots of outdoor seating.    The decor gave me a \"fancy\" feeling of dining, yet without the menu sticker shock.  Clean nice marble looking tables, some booths, and  a big beautiful mirror hung from one of the walls.  Well decorated!  After sitting down to eat with Gabi, We were waited on almost immediately, and the server was attentive, and gave us time to think about our orders.  The menu has a wide variety of items to choose from, and from what I could tell, ALL the prices were relatively cheap!  I ended up eating the Gyro pita, and I must say, it was tasty, and the portion was quite ample and large.    I would put this on my list of places to return for the good eats since I was so happy the first time around.  I feel that you can't go wrong at this place, from my experience.  I would feel comfortable bringing my parents and dates here as I was impressed with the overall feel of the resturant, along with the excellent food, good sized portions, wide menu variety, and cheap prices."}
{"text":"Amazing food, which I don't get in the east coast. Pita bread pizza with Chipotle chicken and Mediterranean salad was delicious and healthy. Lemonade iced tea was yummy as well."}
{"text":"Food is always good and fresh. Happy hour is the best time to try out all the appetizers."}
{"text":"This was my third trip to Pita Jungle, my second to this very location.  They have not failed me yet!  Today as I was sitting outside, I could smell the pesto in the air.  It drew me to the pesto pizza with chicken.  Simply delicious!  love the combination of the cheese, pesto, vegetables and chicken.  There are few places that truly make chicken taste good, but this is definitely one of them!  On my first trip here I had the Caribbean Fruit Salad, also remarkable.  Lots of good fresh fruit and I loved the the coconut and raisins with it as well."}
{"text":"I love it here!! I've been to this location twice and Matthew was my server both times. He's super helpful and has a great mustache! The hummus plates and dolmas are always yummy. Spanakopita was slightly too salty, but I forgive em. I love the look and feel of this location too, lots of art to stare at and comment on, in case your date sucks. Mine doesn't but idk about yours."}
{"text":"I really love Pita Jungle and this is really convienent right inside the mall! They have great salads and sandwiches as well as hummus. I have tried several things now and I haven't had a bad item yet! While the chandler/gilbert location is 5 stars, this one the service just isn't what it is at the other location. The person taking orders this past Saturday just wasn't pleasant at all. The food is just as good as the regular restaurants though.   My favorite item here is the chicken philly pita. While it isn't the healthiest thing on the menu it is very tasty! It is worth the extra calories! This is probably the best meal you can get at the food court in a mall!"}
{"text":"I am a big fan of Pita Jungle and now there is one on my side of town! This is a great location. I came for lunch with my daughter and I got a salad. Their salads are delicious. They are really good size and have lots of great toppings. I also like their pita's and hummus as well. The service is always great and the new location is clean, bright, and has both indoor and outdoor seating which with this great weather we are having I will be taking advantage of. The place isn't really that big so I am sure it is going to be full a lot but worth the wait. The food at Pita Jungle is always fresh and really good. This location was no different!   I was at a party where there was dishes from this location as well. A hummus platter and some other things. Each item was nicely presented and the food was just as good as when you eat there. Good to know for gatherings and the holidays, the hummus platter was a big hit!"}
{"text":"I ordered something for pick up but when i got there to pick it up i decided that I wanted to eat there. The only thing was i brought my  dog with me for the ride. I asked if it was ok to have her with me on the patio. The obliged. This place gets better every time"}
{"text":"Pita jungle was a staple in my dieting a few years back. They have a great range of food from super healthy to greasy and tasty. I have clocked more hours here then I could easily estimate.  Recommendations:  Hummus: This is actually some of my favorite hummus in the valley. There are a few places that come close but there is just something about theirs that I love. Its very heavy in the citrus. Their pitas are always warn, soft and fresh.  Broiled Chicken Salad: The lemon vinaigrette is amazing. They use a very tasty variety of mixed greens for the salad. The chicken is amazingly tasty to that point hat I actually have cravings for it.  Chicken Combination: Broiled chicken, brown rice, mixed beans(super tasty), garlic dip. The garlic dip is the same sauce used in the swarma wraps. The mixed beans are great and contain at least 5 different types in a tomato based sauce.  Mediterranean Combo: Hummus, baba ganoosh, tsatziki, taboule, feta cheese, dolmades, falafel and green beans. This is a good way to sample a lot of items. The green beans are surprisingly good.. I wish the green beans i was forced to eat when I was a kid tasted like this. The falafel is always a little on the greasy side.  Pros: The wait staff is always nice and usually easy on the eyes :) Atmosphere is great. Nice and dark, cool faux walls, great local art displayed. Food quality is consistent  Cons: Hrmmm... not to many.. Parking can be a bit crazy at times Prices are on the high side"}
{"text":"We went there on a Saturday afternoon and wow the place was bustling, i just felt the energy  and the atmosphere was great, but yes it was loud. We ordered for appetizer Sapanakopita. it was nothing, just two tiny pieces laid over lettuce and a cube of cheese. I was disappointed. But anyways, ordered Falafel pita and a lavosh pizza, dont remember the details. Both the things were amazing... ordered lemonade that was not very good, Green Tea was good.  Overall good experience, when we got up, we didn't feel like we had stuffed ourselves and did not feel the weighing down effect of food. So i was glad. We have it in our loop of restaurants now."}
{"text":"This location is a lot nicer than the arrowhead one, decor and demographics wise.   Some of their plates are also bigger and you get more of what you are paying for. I saw the garlic potatoes and they looked so much better than the ones at the arrowhead location. The salads were the same but I think we may make this our primary location.   One tiny complaint: too much raisins in the Mediterranean chicken salad at this place."}
{"text":"Where has this place been all of my life!?   We were seated right away and greeted by our server. When given the menus, everything seemed so good! My friend wanted a salad and the server recommended the Mediterranean chicken salad. And I ended up getting the gyro with a side of garlic potatoes. As for drinks, we got their delicious tropical tea.  Our food arrived and the salad looked AMAZING!!! It was huge! And my gyro looked small but it was delicious and filling. I'm not a big fan of gyros because they tend to be so greasy which always makes me feel sick after eating it and then come the regrets, but this time it was perfect. No grease or mess and even though I finished everything, I was satisfied not sick. Along with finishing MY food I finished my friends salad. HOLY CRAP! That was the best salad I have ever had in my life and I am not even that big of a fan of salads.   The second time we went, the service wasn't as good as the first time."}
{"text":"I love this place. The happy hour deals are really good. What is even better, though, is the ahi tuna with jalape√±o cilantro hummus. It is def the best hummus I have ever had, and with ahi tuna and pita, it is a heavenly combo. I have not tried anything else from here other than a variety of happy hour specials, but their hummus is great and their LEMONADE is also rly good. I am not a huge lemonade fan but I drank like 64 ounces of theirs because something about it was really delicious. After going here, I was inspired to make my own lemonade and I made like 2 gallons of homemade lemonade. You should come here and get their hummus and lemonade."}
{"text":"Great food. Cool atmosphere. There's nothing on the menu that I haven't tried all of it is good. But I repeatedly come here because of their hummus. Try all three flavors they're all excellent. Pricings medium service is medium but it's still a cool atmosphere to hang out and with great food."}
{"text":"Love this place. This is my first choice when asked what I want for dinner. The Philly puta is delicious. I love the hummus trio. This place has a great wIt staff. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"I had lunch here today with my sister.  Been here before, actually why I returned.  Start off with the bad, the place was packed several months ago when I went with a small group.  Waited way too long for service and had things messed up.  Even went through 3 different servers.  Food was topnotch then and we received a gift card for future visit.  On to the real review:  Lunchtime and wasn't that hungry so I just ordered the hummus and grilled chicken.  Their hummus is wonderfully amazing.  Chicken was tasty, but a tad on the dry side.  Order came with two slabs of pita bread.  Previously it was warm and soft, thought it would be the same.  Nope, it was a little hard and dry.  At least it was warm coming out, but quickly cooled off.  My sister ordered a pesto pizza.  It looked tasty, but was too greasy for her to finish.  I probably would have eaten the whole thing, but was too full of hummus at the time.  Service was excellent, my iced tea never went below half.  That's really the key to service with me.  Billing time was a little confusing, gift card given by manager on previous visit did not run through.  I handed over the debit card, but my patience was rewarded with a complimentary meal in the end.  Thanks, that really swayed the vote on returning ever.  Their menu selections are decent, ranging from wraps, hummus, pizzas, burgers, and salads.  Atmosphere was pleasant for lunch, sat next to the large windows overlooking a pond.  Ducks walked past the windows several times, it was a calm place around noon and midweek."}
{"text":"Reasonable price. Large helpings. Good service."}
{"text":"I love Pita Jungle. Their food is great!  They have a lot of healthy options.  Their pita sandwich is plain awesome.  I LOOOOVE their roasted cauliflower with Tahini sause.  However, I must say that some of their dishes are not as consistent as I would like (thus 4 stars). All in all, great place to eat in Tempe."}
{"text":"I wish I could be writing a better review. I'm addicted to the cilantro jalape√±o hummus. I've been going to their various locations since the original Apache location first opened, so I know never to expect great service. My love of that hummus and the usual quality of their food makes up for it as long as I'm not in a hurry.   HOWEVER, this location, since it opened (and I was there the first week) has really not met the standards of food I expect. I have yet to order fish that didn't taste off. And they routinely charge me for both the food I sent back and the simple hummus I ask for to replace it. That would get them three stars...  Except, these bathroom signs. (Photo posted to yelp.) They're absolutely objectionable, not to mention just ugly. The whole place has a graffiti look. The equations and the solar system are so cool I immediately posted them on social media. But these signs are simply unacceptable, especially in a location so close to a university. I worry that the whole company is so totally out of touch. These bathroom signs are the definition of objectification of women, and encourage rape culture. This idea of how men and women are defined is so clearly marked on these bathroom doors that I know women who wouldn't even enter that door. As a sexual abuse survivor, the idea that I am defined as a silhouette with multiple breasts is disgusting. And defining men as lustful wolves harms not only women but men themselves. There's no reason for these doors. There are a million other graffiti choices that you could make that wouldn't enforce these toxic societal roles.   I was worried I was over reacting, but I posted this photo on my social media and everyone was in agreement. I won't be eating at any pita jungle until they are changed. I'll miss you, cilantro jalape√±o hummus."}
{"text":"Great food with a lot of unique options. We got the hummus sampler, (3) avocado toasts and the Mediterranean platter. I was not disappointed with any of the plates. They were delicious as well as the drinks and service. I would recommend for groups as it is large with a lot of menu options for all."}
{"text":"What's not awesome about this place?!   The food? AMAZING!!!  The atmosphere? HIP AND CHILL!!!  The service? INCREDIBLE!!!  The manager Brenda was super attentive and the bartender Nathan was top notch!  Don't skip this one!   PS...love the addition of free wi-fi!"}
{"text":"I went there for the first time a week ago. I ordered the Mediterranean Roasted Chicken (Shawarma) pita. It was a huge serving for only $6.50!  It was so big I had to knife and fork it! It was fresh and delicious. The chicken was tender and well seasoned. The veggies were crisp and the perfect combo..the sauce on it was amazing. I went at busy dinner time, the place was pretty packed. The service wasn't the best because it was so busy, but for having 14 people in our party, they didn't do too bad of a job keeping up. Overall, it was a great dining experience. I now see why a lot of the people I've talked to love the place!"}
{"text":"Great food, terrible service all 4 times. Be prepared to spend longer here than you'd like."}
{"text":"Pluses-  chicken and rice and pita and hummus were delicious. Decor was nice and relaxing. Excellent service! Minuses- potatoes were a bit dry and the only dressing option is a little too lemony for my taste. Overall a great dinner at a great price."}
{"text":"I come here all the time for takeout. They have great healthy choices and many of their dishes are gluten-free. Perfect menu for maintaining a healthy lifestyle.   Their Greek salads are delicious with chicken added!"}
{"text":"Industry standard exceeded!!! I had a dining issue at the Pita Jungle on Ray Road, an issue that could occur at most any of our valley eateries, it was service related. I won't spend time with the details, even though I was disappointed with this locations performance on that evening, it was really the recovery that was memorable. I did what most of us would do after a frustrating meal and service experience, I contacted the company through the corporate website and explained my discontent. What occurred next, was a series of  prompt, caring phone calls from the guest relations department, the restaurant general manager and  the Director of Purchasing George Strom. George and I had a frank discussion regarding the opportunities and solutions associated with them. George was genuinely concerned, not listening if the future, but in the present. After our discussion, George ended up refunding the cost of my meal and sent a gift card as well. As much as I appreciated that gesture, more importantly was the time George and his team spent listing to my concerns. George and PITA JUNGLE don't just say they care about the guest, they prove it in their actions which speaks to, and validates a phenomenal culture at PITA JUNGLE, well done and my family and I will again be regular guests at your wonderful establishment! WAY TO GO PITA JUNGLE!!! Signed, A Raving Fan Charles"}
{"text":"I order take out almost everyday and just love their food and service. When I go and dine in the restaurant the service is always outstanding. My favorite place to eat ."}
{"text":"3 1/2 Stars - I like the food here.  Let's just say I won't die if this place ever burns down - cause there's several more locations :)  I finally thought outside the pita wrap box and ordered me a pita pizza - yum!  Aside from the food, the decor is okay; half rustic art gallery, half fast food strip mall feel - wait it is in a strip mall!  Now the service, servers here make me feel like I'm shopping at the Buckle, and can you at least crack smile?  Just tad bit maybe; I might order a falafal without asking for extra hummus .... would that help little buddy?  Not saying it's bad but doesn't make me feel comfortable when you looked piss cause your GF is giving you hell today.  Look her in the eyes and tell her you're wrong - Bam! Done! - enjoy!"}
{"text":"I almost always pick pita jungle when it's my turn to pick. However, the last visit to this location will indeed be my last. The waiters here are always very friendly so service is not the issue. The BIG BLACK HAIRS, yes plural, were my issue. I ordered the gyro which I almost always do and to my surprise when I got halfway through I had something snag in my mouth...... Talk about disgusting. I looked and noticed NO ONE was wearing a hair net. Disgusting!!! So unless sanitary practices don't matter to you I would highly suggest avoiding this place."}
{"text":"Tried Pita Jungle for the 1st time today. Food was excellent, had the gyro and it was great. Server was friendly and was very attentive."}
{"text":"I come here often and I don't even live close. The food is good and the staff is phenomenal. I like the food, I love the service. Nice people who don't give you a speel or tons of upsells. My favorite server is Gino, I ask for him EVERY SINGLE TIME. If you go there, you should ask for him too!!!!! Looooooove Gino and Pita Jungle!"}
{"text":"I'm the kind of person that once I find something I like, I will always order the same thing.  I love the hummus here.  Perfectly smooth and light with the right amount of garlic and lemon.  I've searched high and low for a hummus as good, but never found it.  Order it with extra pitas because you'll need them!  But every time I browse the entrees, I'm at a loss. I keep trying new things, but haven't found one dish worth getting again.  I've tried the Veggie Garden Wrap. Blah, nothing special. The Honey Pasta Salad? Too sweet. The Veggie \"Burger\" on 12-grain bread fell apart, and the garlic new potatoes were dried out. The wood fired Pesto Pizza wasn't my idea of pizza at all.  Nothing was BAD, but nothing was OMG GOOD.  It was just, \"ok, I'll eat this.\"  I think next time I'm here I'll just stick with the hummus and a lemonade, and save myself some money!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!  Cool location, staff is friendly and helpful and the food and drink selections are excellent!!"}
{"text":"Using their Online Ordering system is a COMPLETE waste of time. Both times we used it we ended up waiting an additional 30 minutes for them to finish our food even though we ordered over an hour in advance.  Both times there have been problems with the orders even though everything is in written form in front of their faces.  Today, instead of individually wrapping our pitas, they gave us a bag of store bought pita bread. How tacky.  When you call to make a complaint about it taking an unreasonable amount of time, and when your orders are incorrect, they treat you with a horrible attitude as if YOU did something wrong. If you make a mistake, at very least own up to it.   And the food is overall pretty bland, just like all other Pita Jungle's.  We will not be ordering from Pita Jungle again."}
{"text":"Generally speaking I am not the hugest fan of Pita Jungle, but I really enjoy this particular location. It is large, has a great atmosphere, friendly staff, and an awesome patio.  My favorite thing about PJ is their INCREDIBLE happy hour. They do a huge selection of tapas for $1-2 each! You can get a few small plates and try multiple things and have your bill, with drink, come out under $10. Slammin!   Tapas items: Hummus Trio, Garlic Dip, Sauteed Mushrooms, Tomato and Mozzarella, Olives, Taziki, Some Lemon Chicken Dish, Olive Oil and Pita, and Falaffel. I'm sure I missed a few others. They also do $1 of cocktails and beers, and have $5 draft margaritas. HH ends at 6pm.   Generally I think the food is pretty bland, but I have also come to love the cilantro jalapeno hummus, the 1000 bean entree, and the Caribbean salad. I also enjoy their falaffel.   I'm not really sure what would make PJ a 5-star for me other than all around improvement on the flavor of the food. Maybe I am just picky."}
{"text":"I have been to Pita Jungle 5 or 6 times and although its tasty, I wouldnt say that it is amazing. The food is normally good, but never really filled with flavor, and I frequently find myself disappointed in their hummus.  I like being able to sit indoors or out.   No complaints but no raves, either."}
{"text":"the workers here are nothing like the brooding, hipster wanna-bees at other pita jungles--they are actually nice!  they let me order from the kids menu and i got a chicken pita, hummus and drink for 5 bucks plus tax!  i will be back!"}
{"text":"the hummus and chicken are good. service has improved in the last few months. good take-out option..."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I love pita jungle. This location however is by far the worst that I've been to (Tempe, Pasadena, Desert Ridge, Shea and Scottsdale fashion); I was held on hold for over 3 minutes, they got my order wrong (sub veggies for pitas), and to add insult to top it off there was am absolutely pathetic portion size on my large cilantro hummus (pic posted).  REALLY regretting that tip on take out..."}
{"text":"Really good hummus and garlic dip, with the real star being the babagonoush (and yes, part of the fun of ordering is saying babagonoush).  I've never eaten here, only at the Tempe location back when I was in school, but whenever I am in the mood for something different to munch on while watching the game or if I have to take a dip or something to a party this is where I stop off"}
{"text":"The food here has always been consistent, and consistently good! My go-to is the cilantro jalape√±o hummus to start, with cucumbers and Siracha! Everything I have had is awesome, and really really really big portions (fruit & cheese fantasia, nachos, chicken combo platter, wood-fired chicken, gyros, wraps, spinach pasta salad...YUM!) You can definitely share an entree with somebody else, or split a couple of apps. Or just order it all and feast :)  They almost lost me for a bit. I would come here right around either a shift-change, or just a slower time in the day (2 or 3 pm) and our servers would be MIA. Getting this or that took forever. The first time I thought I was crazy, then it happened multiple times, and a couple more after that. Solved part of that problem myself by just grabbing the check early if I know I have to get outta there. Not a big deal, but a little frustrating.  Came last Monday for dinner. I believe Phil was our server's name. He was the best! Polite, knew his favorites and preferences, refills, and very attentive."}
{"text":"Ordered my food online at 12:06 to pick up at 1:30. Got there at 1:50 and it wasn't even made because they didn't understand my order. Although my phone number was on the order, they didn't bother to call and clarify. They literally had almost 2 whole hours to take care of the confusion.The manager just made excuses as to why it wasn't made yet and suggested a different way to order. Completely unacceptable for a to go order. My point is, don't order from here if you're in a hurry, your food won't be made when you get there!"}
{"text":"YUM! I went here for lunch today with my roommate and everything was delicious. They have the best iced-teas in town. I always get the green tea with a little lemonade. My roommate got the berry iced tea which looked really good too. We shared everything today - we started with the jalapeno hummus. It's so good, they put a little pico de gallo in the center which gives it just the right kick. We split the small order and it was plenty! We also shared the classic greek salad - I love the lemon vinaigrette - so light and refreshing. Then we shared the pesto pizza. It normally comes on pita bread I think, but we got it on lavoush and it was huge! We definitely had left overs. I don't know why I don't come here more often but everything was delicious! I love it. I wanna try their breakfast too - the crepes sounded amazing."}
{"text":"I stopped in for a bowl of soup and a beer. From the start, I knew I wouldn't like this place...they layout is neat, it's clean, but it is loud and the staff are bordering on terrible.   The hostess seemed irritated when I just wanted to walk myself to the bar. The bartender took my order of a beer, but also seemed irritated when I just wanted a cup of soup and no real meal.  The soup came out a few minutes later with some attitude. The soup itself, coconut curry, wasn't very good, yet was seemingly quite overpriced for the size and quality.  From the staff and fellow customers, I feel like this place succeeds on its \"cool factor\". That is, it can convince people it's cool and charge subsequent prices with mediocre food as a result. However....I do highly recommend this place if you're looking for a quality douchebag in your life. Staff and customer base seem full of them!"}
{"text":"Love the Salmon, great and amount if food was just right. Pita chips and Tzatziki -  10 Coconut Curry Soup - 10 Grilled Salmon -10    Service from Jamie outstanding!!!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious and had nice serving sizes. Waitress was friendly and attentive. We went for lunch and the place was packed beyond belief.  I don't count that as a negative though because that tells me they are a great place to go."}
{"text":"Exceptional food reasonably priced. Located right off Bell in Arrowhead. Plenty of parking. zin mid-may we sat outside where the misting kept the \"patio\" pleasant and it was MUCH quieter than the inside which was hopping with many younger people. Cole gave us friendly and helpful service.  The Chicken Curry Salad was served on a bed of rice, and the presentation was very appealing. The many ingredients were well prepared and the seasoning superb. The onions were carmalized and the sliced carrots added color as well as crunch.  The remainder of the very generous serving came home.  The noontime special of a mahi (tuna) shrama pita was delicious. The fish were small (~1/2 \" cubes) that had been grilled or fried, so that the fish didn't fall out. Make sure to get extra napkins to mop up the extra tasty sauce.  More details are on their menu:   http://www.pitajungle.com/menu/pitas-hot/"}
{"text":"I have always loved PJ and was thrilled when the 7th street location opened.  But to my dismay (and consistent with what I have read in the other reviews) this location has been a disappointment. Servers are sweet but the food isn't the same.  I've had an issue each of the 4 times I've been here.  Today's chicken was so overdone dry I couldn't swallow it.  Hoping management rights the ship soon.  In the meantime, I'll head to the other locations."}
{"text":"You'd think it hard for a granola, earthy/crunchy place like this to provide a consistent experience across locations. But I've been to three in the Valley, and they've all be on par with another.  But this one is my \"home town\" PJ, so I'll review it. My wife is a veggie, so this has become a standard of ours. Plenty of grilled flesh for me and Firstborn, and lots of \"no-mom\" items for her.  Yes, it's busy. Yes, it's crowded. You'll have a hard time telling your wait staff from the patrons. But that's part of the atmosphere. The food has always been tasty. The service always fast enough. And the price isn't crazy."}
{"text":"Ordered through grub hub for delivery. Specifically asked on the notes in bold letters to not put chicken in the salad. We all know their food is good but super frustrating when you pay a delivery fee and your order is messed up. Ended up having to throw out the salad. I did call the restaurant and he did refund me the money for just the salad and not the delivery fee. He said I would have to place another order to have it delivered again along with the fee. So you mess up my food and I again have to pay 3.99 to send a driver out to deliver and wait another 30-45 min due to something the restaurant messed up . NO THANKS"}
{"text":"Their baba ganoush is out of this world. I ordered the veggie wrap. It was huge. Two people could have shared it. The place is a hipster heaven, so if that's not your thing, look elsewhere."}
{"text":"So far everything I have tasted here has been out of this world!  It seems to me that they must make their Hummus from scratch because I can find nothing like it anywhere else.  Especially since moving away from the area.  Top things to get:  1.)  Roasted Bell Pepper Hummus and/or Cilantro Jalapeno Hummus with their hot pita breads.  They used to have a hummus trio which was really good.  Although my favorite hummus is still the RBPH.  2.)  Mediterranean Roasted Chicken Pita!  Amazing in taste!  Probably because of the type of sauce they put in it.  Not as large in portion size as I'd like to see but decent.  3.)  Gyro!  What's not to love about the GYRO!  Items to consider:  1.)  Pesto Pizza and Chipotle Chicken Lavosh Pizza ask to add olives and mushrooms if you like.  Although they are fresh in ingredients, they still are missing some flavor in the sauce.  Or maybe it's the fact that there is little to no pizza sauce period.  Maybe ask for extra pizza sauce in regards to the type of pizza ordered?   2.)  Never have tried these items but always have wanted to:  the Wood-Fired Fresh Salmon, Grilled Vegetable Salad, and the Mahi Mahi with Pita Chips!  Looks good, sounds good!  Check out the pictures if you can.  3.)  And last but not least would love to try out the Pineapple Orange Guava Banana Smoothie!"}
{"text":"The only thing that I enjoyed was the hummus and pita chips.   The gyro was nasty, the chicken and sauce tasted like tai food. The rice was uncooked and nasty.   The food was cold. If you want real greek food go to PITA KITCHEN."}
{"text":"This is one of the many Pita Jungle restaurants in the area which you can consider as a type of warning. My fiance and I went there for an anniversary dinner on a Friday night. The place was pretty full and a live jazz band was playing. After 10 minute wait we were seated. The hostess got us drinks and after than we received zero service from any of the staff. We had two waitresses circling around and making sure to avoid any eye contact. People that came 10 minutes after us were getting their food orders in before anyone even spoke to us. After 15 minutes of that, we left. The hostess was nice enough to not accept our money for the drinks, consider that's where the 1 star comes from.  THE FOOD  No idea. Two waitresses circled around us for 15 minutes making sure to avoid any eye contact.   The menu is the same as any other one of these restaurants.  SETTING  Same setup as all the other Pita Jungle restaurants. Staff sucks, except for the hostess.  OVERALL: Will never be back to this location again and will not recommend anyone else to go there. Instead, I would recommend the Mesa location since it has a much better service, as in, they actually provide it."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Pita jungle location across the Valley. It's in a nice location in Chandler, with a beautiful view of the lake next to it. You could eat outside, take a romantic date here, or come by yourself to enjoy some of the best quality food that's healthy, and organic that PITA Jungle provides."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time today.  Love this place!  Fresh ingredients, good service.  I had the tuna w/pita bread.  Generous portions.  Took half home for dinner.  Pita Jungle rocks!"}
{"text":"Came for dinner tonight waited 15 minutes and no one came to our table. I love the food here but the last two times I've been here I've walked out because the service is horrible. Not impressed."}
{"text":"Five stars to Pita Jungle! Food is always excellent and awesome service! Big THANK YOU for always being a big supporter of Chaparral Football! Great place for lunch or dinner! They have a awesome happy hour."}
{"text":"Great food! Love that they do door dash. I'm Never disappointed in what I order. The fire grilled salmon is amazing. I love their roasted pepper hummus and grilled chicken. The chicken shawarma is tasty, I add taziki to it. Yum."}
{"text":"Due to our current health craze this was an awesome place that fit right in to our needs.  All their dishes are so refreshing and yummy. My favorite is their roasted pepper hummus.. omg amazing! I can't really comment on one dish because they are all really yummy.  Will update after I've gone a few more times"}
{"text":"I am definitely a fan of Pita Jungle,only...NOT THIS LOCATION!!!                                        In the past 4 years I've lived in Phoenix I've eaten at 3 locations.                                        I would not recommend this location for the following reason:                                                   Today I was quoted 10:40am that my food would be ready. I went to pick up exactly at 10:40am. I was then told it would be a couple minutes. A couple of minutes means 2-3 mins, correct?  I waited 13 minutes additionally on a 30 minute lunch hour.  It appeared that they were preparing for a catered order. Typically if a company caters you have to call in your order a few days in advanced. SO what I don't understand is knowing that you are preparing for a catered lunch today that you should quote a later time for pick up?!?! That wouldn't have been a problem for me...There apparently was no manager to help incentivize me on my wait time, being that my lunch is only 30 minutes long. On top of that I get back to the office to quickly eat some of my Chicken Pasta Salad and after my third bite, there is a little short black hair in the pasta! I thought my boiling point was waiting for 13 minutes, cutting into my lunch time. THIS TOOK IT TO A WHOLE NEW LEVEL. BEYOND FURIOUS. Now I'm not hungry and WILL NEVER ORDER FROM THIS LOCATION AGAIN!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       This was my 2nd and FINAL dining experience at THIS ARCADIA LOCATION.  This location has consistently failed."}
{"text":"My favorite place for happy hour (I am not a drinker). In the AZ heat, you can't beat the $1 baba ghanoush, hummus trio, pita with thyme and other healthy cold offerings. Prices for happy hour vary up to $5 I believe but what a bargain! The portions are big enough to share so bring a couple of friends and order a variety.  I am also a huge fan of their various seasonal gazpachos which you can add shrimp to.  I have been to several other PJs, this location is more upscale yet more intimate (smaller). Has a large patio in the Dana Park shopping area tucked in the north west corner. It is loud and busy but the food was fresh and came out in a timely manner."}
{"text":"the atmosphere is neat..the food is good..Nicely done."}
{"text":"Pita Jungle is usually a favorite of mine until my last experience. I came in on a Wed at 5pm and first thing after being asked \"how many\", if I'ld like to eat at the bar. I am a mature lady and told the gal that I wasn't much inclined to eating at a bar. When we entered the dining room there were all kinds of tables available. Usually the bar is offered when they are full and don't have any empty tables.  Sorry folks but first come, first served. The manager and his staff aught to realize this. Not try to accommodate a 2 top that hasn't even arrived!  Everything seemed rushed. My chicken Shrwarma bowl was delicious as always. However I was given my check after I'ld only had a few bites. Another signal to get moving. I don't blame my waitress as she was very sweet although I was never checked on to see if everything was fine. This attitude comes from management. Because I got a visit from him after my plate was empty. It wasn't genuine concern if I had a great experience and again felt like the bums rush outta there!  It seemed if your a lone dinner here you were not as valued as a larger party. The management needs to realize our dollars have just as much spending power as any other customer. Waitstaff...we usually tip better than most because we don't have the added expense of paying for a family.  I usually go to the Pita Jungle west of I10 on Ray Road and have never felt rushed to eat and leave. Perhaps because it's a much larger dining room.   I've also frequented PJ in Tempe and in Phoenix on Indian School Road. As mentioned before it's usually a favorite spot."}
{"text":"So good! The perfect dining when you don't want to spend too much money while on vacation. I got the Chicken Shawarma like the waiter recommended and it was great! Definitely a lot more Americanized than your typical Mediterranean restaurants, but I can't complain. The biggest reason why I can't complain? Because their garlic sauce is to die for! Reminds me of the same one I would get back home. That disgustingly stinky, sticks on you for a week, you could probably eat it with a spoon, kind of garlic sauce. Ughhh I could go for some right now. It really makes anything you eat here taste delicious."}
{"text":"Was very happy to see PJ in my neighborhood. Delicious and consistent as always. We were greeted properly by the hostess upon arrival then ushered to our table. The service was good and got the drinks right away. We will be back very soon."}
{"text":"Pretty underwhelming. Our waitress was fine, but the food was really disappointing.   1) happy hour at this location is Monday through Friday only, even though they brought the happy hour menu with our other menus ( this was so they could promote their daily reverse happy hour that begins at 9:00pm)  2) ordered dolmades. Received an order of 6, and I'm NOT exaggerating, 3 of them were 90% grape leaf only.  3) ordered a spinach pasta salad thinking it'll be a nice bed of spinach with \"some pasta\" and a good amount of the chopped veggies on top of that. What I got was a HUGE plate of rotini pasta with \"some\" spinach leaves and \"some\" chopped veggies. If I had wanted a plate of pasta with oil all over it and a few veggies sprinkled in for accent, I could have done that at home."}
{"text":"Beep, beep, beep.   No that sound isn't coming from a big truck backing up, it's from the wheelbarrow that they use to bring your food out on.  I swear, my portion was stupidly huge.    I had the Medchilada, ---Grilled chicken and mixed beans in lavosh bread, topped with cheddar and wood-fired. Served with brown rice, shredded lettuce, tomatoes, pico de gallo and sour cream.     It was hanging over the sides of the platter and easily was over 5000 calories and I couldn't eat a quarter of it.  I looked over at the diner next to me and saw the largest fruit salad ever created.  IMHO, it should have been served in a bucket.  I'm guessing there were 4 bananas, 2 pints of strawberries, 1 bunch of grapes and a full melon in it.   I really like the food at all the Pita Jungles, but damn some of their portions are way out of line."}
{"text":"As others have already said - great food, bad service...  The atmosphere is nice - work from local artists decorate the walls and seating is nice. Since they expanded into the neighbor space, it has gotten nicer I think.   The servers are all thin and hot and odd... they look like models in some sort of trance. I think they're in some sort of cult as well - it's apparently one of the tougher jobs to get since it's such a tight crew... and once you get it, you keep it for awhile. I've known a few people who worked there and they said the others were very tight and strange. I can imagine. When I was younger, I dreamed about dating one of the hot waitresses.  *sigh*  They are also somewhat spaced out and the service here is pretty bad more often than not. On the other hand - this place is often packed because it's so popular, so it's probably pretty difficult to be a server there since it's so busy. I tend to overlook the service being bad... it's not terrible. I mean, they aren't rude or anything and they're nice to look at.  Their tofu isn't always great and neither is their chicken, but most of the time everything is delicious. They carry a tasty selection of wines as well. I've eaten here hundreds of times over the past decade or so, and I doubt I'll stop eating there any time soon. It is among my top 10 places to eat in the valley for sure."}
{"text":"Pita jungle Gilbert has won my heart over. My daughter started working there and I have gotten to know the staff well. My son now works there as well and my husband and I go there quite often as a healthy food choice."}
{"text":"Great food, great service. Cool vibe inside. I got the pasta salad and it was much bigger than I expected but very good. My boyfriend got the chicken tikka masala and enjoyed it. And of course the gyros are always a hit."}
{"text":"I looked up specials prior to visiting on : http://www.pitajungle.com/menu/specials/  I asked my server at the location about the specials and was told \" we don't do those \" .I felt lied to & like I should be embarrassed for even asking.   So 1 star since they lack consistency from their website to their locations."}
{"text":"Good healthy food, but it a little expensive for a family. I really like the grilled vegetables and a must is the three hummus with chicken appetizer. BEWARE, don't get the hummus with chicken if anyone in your party is allergic to pine nuts. The interior is tres chic and modern, but because the the floors are concrete it is loud when the restaurant is full.   Friendly staff, but not all staff is created equal.  Some make sure to check on you and refill your glass while others stop by to check on you and then don't bring back what you requested."}
{"text":"Of all the locations I've been to, I find that this one has the best service and food overall. It's always clean and everyone I come in contact with is friendly and eager to help if needed. Parking is kind of a pain, but theres a huge parking lot right there if you can't find a close spot. I came in with a few friends last week, and as usual we were greeted right away by the hostess. It was lunch time and it was busy, but my friends and I were offered something to drink while we waited and were seated in the time we were told. Our server was attentive and because my friends had never been in before, suggested the hummus trio so they could try all of the different flavors. We got the mahi with pita chips, shwarma wrap and the gyro. Im impressed every time by the generous portions and presentation of the food. As we were finishing up, the manager came over and asked how everything was, which is an extra touch I appreciate being in the industry myself. We finished up eating and left feeling satisfied."}
{"text":"Great food... Super crappy service ! I ordered in person for carry out and let the cashier know I would wait out on the patio. I ordered lentil soup and hummus so that can't take long at 11 am before the lunch rush. Twenty minutes later I was wondering would could be taking so long. I went inside and found my food had been sitting on the counter for who knows how long. My soup was already cold!"}
{"text":"We eat here often because we live in the neighborhood. The service has always been very poor: slow, wrong food, uninterested, did I say sloooow? But lately, the food had taken a dive. In fact, the past three times it has been pretty bad, we may find somewhere else to go for awhile (plenty of spots in the area). Last night, both the Moroccan Gazpacho (which wass amazing 2 weeks ago) and the hummus with chicken were so drenched in lemon juice, I had to add sugar to make it edible (couldn't track down a server and I DID make it taste better by doing that). I love having tthem so close to us, but they really need to work on two important things: service and food!"}
{"text":"Ugh it pains me to even post this, but it has to be said. Every time I go here the service is terrible. I have went several times now whenever I go it's busy, so when we drove by and no one was there I thought it would be different. It started out great it was my friends first time going and she was super excited. We were greeted and told since it was here first time we got a free sample hummus! Great right. The waitress left came back brought that out and we still hadn't even ordered drinks so we did we ordered an additional pita which we didn't get. It's now 25 min in and no drinks and no order taken. We ordered asked for the extra pita again 15 min later food came out and my friends dish was wrong, still never got the pita. We had an hour and a half to eat and at this point we were past that and they said a new dish would be another 20 min so she just ate it. I love pita jungle the food is great once you get it, but the service is sub par! I appreciate the free sample but we never got The extra pita! I'll be back but maybe not this location this is the one that I always have the worst luck at. If you have time go visit another one!!!"}
{"text":"Good service, fun (loud) atmosphere, and fantastic food. The vegetarian options are great! Bring the whole family."}
{"text":"Enjoy great Med food, Pita Jungle is not known for its service but for the great food.  Also don't forget that just because you have been to one Pita Jungle does not mean there all the same/"}
{"text":"Consistent and Fresh, Its great to have a place that has high turnover and provides quality food that is cooked in a simple manor to make it a no brainer to return.  The Indian School location shows off how far Pita Jungle has made it.  The family has opened up locations all across the valley and producing a variety of success.  Yet, one thing remains the same, consistent food and a family restaurant feeling.   Oh yeah for you vegetarians this is your hot spot.  Keep growing Pita Jungle, can't wait to visit your restaurants  when I travel out of state (hint hint to you loyal Pita Jungle fans)."}
{"text":"The food is absolutely amazing! 5 stars for that! We had the garbanzo beans with cilantro and jalape√±os, which came with a couple of pitas. Then Hubby had the chicken special and I had the Chicken Tikka Masala but with tofu. To die for! Most delicious thing I have eaten in a while, and we eat out a lot.   Unfortunately after a good start, the service went downhill. Hence the 4 stars. Not sure where our server disappeared off to, but it took a while to get the bill and another while to pay it. It wasn't that busy and since there was no reason for slow service, it was reflected in his tip. I'm happy to give 20%+ when it's deserved.   Note to the owners, if you are going to serve lots of pitas, it would be nice if they were served fresh and warm. And don't skimp on the sauce. My meal was fantastic, but a bit more sauce would have been appreciated.  This is the second Pita Jungle we have visited and the food at the other one was amazing too, but the service was way better. We'll be back to this one, and hope the service is better next time."}
{"text":"This is probably the second time I've been to this place. I came here with all my co- workers for a team lunch. We had a big group of 12 people. So we had a reservation and we were sitting outside. It was really nice especially with about 6 ceiling fans going which was great. The inside was decorated very hip. I would say the inside was medium size with lots of tables and they were so busy at lunch. Very noisy with a lot of happy people enjoying their lunch.   I had the Philly Chicken Pita. It had grilled chicken with grilled peppers and onions over melted cheese. It was alright. Not great. The chicken had some taste but not a lot. It was a big pita and enough to fill you up but not stuff you. So I would say its a good size. You can also get sides with it but I didn't.   A lot of people I saw ordered their salads which were huge. It looked really good and I think next time I will try one of their salads.   So the service was exceptional especially with such a large group and the place being very busy with a waiting line. We were greeted right away after we were seated and got our drink order in. Drinks were at our table right away. They were always checking on our glasses and made sure our glasses were always filled. Very impressive with such a busy place. The food took a little longer especially since we had a pretty big party but they brought out the food in a decent amount of time.   Overall, service was great and comfortable with okay food. I'm thinking the food is okay because of what I ordered and will be smarter next time."}
{"text":"I'm sitting in a Garbanzos restaurant and it makes me want to give a Pita Jungle a great review. :-)  Nothing comes close to the Shawarma Pita. Nothing. Not the Gyro House and certainly not Garbanzos.  We have never been disappointed with Pita Jungle. And every time we try someplace new, we are disappointed. Enough said."}
{"text":"Yum....found our Mediterranean go to spot now. Really like this location and the service is always great. We typically do take out at this location and have tried a number of items from the hummus trios and grilled chicken to the gyros and everything is always fresh and flavorful."}
{"text":"This place is such an easy choice! It's super close to my house, the menu choices are plentiful, healthy, and delicious. The service is phenomenal. When Richa handles our table, she is always so friendly, the food comes out fast, and right the first time. She is very attentive, and always makes us want to come back. I have recommended this place and taken friends here, and they all love it."}
{"text":"We ordered the jalape√±o hummus and cauliflower appetizer. Both were to die for. Also ordered a gyro, which was pretty standard. Would definitely go back and try some of the other things!"}
{"text":"I won't be able to say enough about this place.  First off, the best happy hour deals in town. I mean, who doesn't love seeing a $1-$3 price margin on delicious greek food ?!  My friend and I \"splurged\" and shared like 6 items off the menu + 2 glasses of cabernet which was definitely NOT bad at all for $3. Everything was delicious so I don't think there's a need to go into detail about each one. The side plate of pita made everything that much better as well.   The interior is modern and lively. Nice patio for those who like enjoying the heat/arizona breeze in front of a nice man made lake =p  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This location seems to be going downhill. Came here to take my nieces out for lunch and was disappointed. Let's start with the hostess, she had zero people and or customer facing skills. Let's face the facts, she didn't want to be there.   Anyways, on to the food. It was o.k., seems like the quality control in the food department has gone downhill. Dirty appetizer plates makes you lose your appetite a bit. Huge up-charge on tiny little baby cucumbers that we requested with the hummus - server didn't know that we were going to be charged a couple bucks for that.   Walls by the kitchen are dirty....  It's a great location....management, you need a team meeting. When people go out to eat customer service should be on point."}
{"text":"Great service! I get the chipotle black bean burger all the time. Since i dont eat eggs, i get it without the bun."}
{"text":"Pita was thin and hard. Service was slow and sat with an empty drink while eating and didn't get a refill until after I was already done. Came to downtown location after an excellent meal at the Tempe location. Not impressed and I don't think ill return to this location again."}
{"text":"This place is alright, but I've gone twice and had inconsistent experiences.   The first time everything was fresh and tasty.  The second time, things weren't right and somethings were terrible.  I've tried several varieties of the hummus and they're all good. The mediterranean plate is very good, except for the falafel which resemble hockey pucks. The spicy chicken pita wrap was alright.  It wasn't very spicy.  It was enormous and couldn't be eaten by picking it up (structural integrity problems). The chicken was all on one half of the pita wrap.   The fish was terrible, definitely not a recommend.  The spicy chicken hummus plate was good. The black bean burger was great. The kafta burger was great.  The chipotle black bean burger was not good -- mushy and the cranberries were weird.  I would normally give this a 2 star rating, but because it is one of the best fresh and healthy restaurants in the Phoenix area, I'll bump it up to a 3 star."}
{"text":"Service impeccable, food delicious.  Would go here any day for lunch or dinner.  Excellent variety in the menu.  Too bad it is usually so busy - but I know why."}
{"text":"Appreciate all of the options as a vegetarian, but also happy that my carnivore friends can find something to enjoy.  never disappointed when I visit."}
{"text":"I liked their food, its very delicious, I had tried the Scottsdale and Shea location prior. The service was kind of slow, I waited for my soup almost 20 min it  was Sunday and they were not too busy. otherwise the food was delicious."}
{"text":"What a great place for lunch. Food is excellent very tasty portions are big. Prices are in the middle not cheap nor expensive."}
{"text":"Excellent artichoke pasta salad and green lentil soup, service is always great!  Please open a store in Casa Grande!"}
{"text":"Came during the lunch rush. Agreed to sit on the patio. My party and another party were the only ones on the patio. The server came to check on the other party but after 15 minutes we weren't even offered drinks. We ended up leaving."}
{"text":"Been here a few times--no complaints whatsoever. Get some hummus as an appetizer, then a gyro. very satisfying. Avoid Thursday nights if you can though, the bands can be a bit oppressive in that size of a building."}
{"text":"Great healthy food. Portions are generous and servers are no nonsense and get your food to you quickly. Great bang for the buck! One of my favorite places. Always feel good when I eat here! Go to spot!"}
{"text":"Oh what a night. Table for 9 with separate checks. Yes. The food here is amazing!!! I had the most amazing Greek Salad with a lemon zest dressing!!! I had an oven roasted chicken entree!!! The vegetables were crisp and fresh. I could cut the the chicken with a fork. The tomatoes and greens... off the chain. No one in our group had a complaint about the food. We are stuffed. Thank goodness we walked to and from the hotel."}
{"text":"If you order to go.. give then a half hour. Slow . Chicken curry salad is the bomb. Everything else... eh.. but really your taste buds... think it's too Americanized. Have to remember it is a chain."}
{"text":"Would love it if this was more authentic. Way overrated in my opinion. Only thing I will ever get it the salmon salad and the curry chicken salad. It just depends on your taste for food.  Some obviously love it.   A bit slow to get food, order is not always accurate, people always friendly. I have been placed on hold for too long and hung up."}
{"text":"Great food great service,  ellie was awesome! I really like the atmosphere here very comfy,  was able to get in and out quickly before seeing a movie"}
{"text":"I got dinner here last night with my buddy from the area, who apparently takes everyone from out of town here.I found it  funny how the sign outside flickered, enticing me in. She insisted that the falafel was the staple and I ordered a side of their garlic sauce. It was very very good, but for a 6' 2\" , 200 pounder, that didn't hit the spot. I ordered this chicken shawarma too. This was very good, and that had me satisfied. I thought there was wayy too much romaine lettuce ( not native to a shawarma or a falafel sandwich). But other than that the food was interesting, and I just felt good eating it. She got the honey pasta, which was a little sweet for my liking, with chunky cuts of veggies.  The servers are dressed in casuals, and you wouldn't know they were a server, until they asked you what you wanted to drink. A very interesting atmosphere with good good food. A must stop by for lunch atleast."}
{"text":"Great value.  The hummus and chicken are decent.  The beans are extremely bland.  The service was very good and the space was not as cramped as the Tempe location."}
{"text":"I used to think it was better than it actually is.  However, you will not find better quality Mediterranean food in the immediate area.  And by immediate, I mean within 2 square miles."}
{"text":"This is the best Pita Jungle and it's not just because they have a full bar. The waitstaff seems to care more about your experience much more than the other valley locations.  I recommend the Lentil Fetoosh Salad and the Lavosh Pizza (?--may have the name wrong, but it's not to be confused with the Lavosh Pita, which isn't nearly as good).  Even the cheap House Margaritas are good."}
{"text":"Consistent and healthy food, which actually doesn't taste like healthy food. The kids' meals are a great alternative to the typical \"cheeseburger and fries\" meals."}
{"text":"I had to draft a review for the guy who helped us.. Rob! Thank you! We are from Cali and you totally hooked it up! Thanks for being kind to us at the end of our crazy night!"}
{"text":"Had the cilantro jalape√±o hummus. It was amazing!  The amount of hummus was too much for the two warm pieces of pita bread, which means I get leftovers!  I have enjoyed my experience every time I have been to Pita Jungle. I don't live close, but I will probably go back."}
{"text":"I usually eat at the dive Greek mom & pop restaurants, but I noticed that Pita Jungle is ALWAYS busy, so I thought I'd try it. This isn't really authentic Greek food, maybe like the Olive Garden of Greek Mediterranean.  The chicken pita was fine, but the flimsy pickle spears in the pita was odd, maybe this is a fancy version in lieu of cucumber slices? I'm open to trying a different version. There were a plentiful amount of fresh baby greens in the pita. This cubed chicken was broiled. Overall, the price was reasonable as well as the portion.  The service was fine. The hostess was friendly. Why was this place was SO loud? Is it from everyone in the entire place having conversations all at once? I couldn't even hear what my friend was saying from across the table.  Overall, it wasn't a bad experience and the food wasn't bad, it just wasn't for me. I'm glad I tried Pita Jungle."}
{"text":"I had to find out what all the hype was about Pita Jungle...  The service was friendly.  I tried the Broiled Chicken Salad $8.99 {Tender chicken breast in a garlic marinade, broiled to perfection, served on a bed of mixed greens, tomatoes, cucumbers, and onions in lemon vinaigrette.}  The chicken portion was generous, the dressing was light and flavorful, plentiful mixed greens (not crappy iceberg), but $8.99 for a salad in the Food Court was a bit pricey....hmm? I guess food court food is expensive anyways....  Overall, it was ok, I guess I'm spoiled on the Feta Chicken Salad at Crazy Jim's. Next time, I'll try their pita...maybe that's their specialty??"}
{"text":"I gave this place a star for the patio. Everything else is out of control. It's like the inmates are running the jail. Place always smells like a toilet. Feels dirty. Never get orders correct. Too bad. The other locations are great!"}
{"text":"This place is always consistent. For the most part the service is always good and the food always comes out quickly. I love the red bell pepper hummus with steak, it comes with pine nuts, which Pita Jungle has made me a huge fan of.   My go-to item on the menu is the Philly chicken pita. Always the same, always satisfying. I have gone to different locations in the valley a bunch of times and never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Well I've been at this Greek food thing for a little while now and I can say with certainty that this is one of the better places I've eaten. I have not been to any other Pita Jungle location, because this was my first time eating there... but I've had many a chicken schwarma. I was a little put off by the lack of description on the menu of what their items actually had in them. For someone that had no experience with Greek food, my mom was overwhelmed trying to figure out what to eat on the menu. I was kind of annoyed also that they didn't call their food what it is traditionally called really at any other Greek place I've been to. Some of the names were the same, but saying Mediterranean Roasted Chicken Pita... one would think, WTF is that?  This place was REALLY loud when we went on a Sunday afternoon for lunch. I don't even want to know what this place is like Friday or Saturday night. Fortunately, there was no wait while I was in but that didn't stop us from being here for longer than I would have liked to. Our waiter wasn't all that attentive. Probably the best part of dining at this location is being able to sit out on the patio by the water and see the ducks floating by. However, the tables and chairs on the patio are rather uncomfortable and you'd think for a place that is doing so well they'd be able to put out a better patio scene. Anyways, I would probably go back if I lived in the area. I've paid less for better."}
{"text":"Really good food but they need to learn how to cook falafel well they are almost always undercooked my I order then! But the hummus and all other food is on point!"}
{"text":"You guys really step up your game in the last 2 weeks quick fast service. Also ALLEN is a awesome waiter so knowledgeable about you brand.  Thanks for making the improvement."}
{"text":"So had this for the first time.  Never again! Food was salty!  For a \"healthy food\" being this salty should never be served.  Pita was old, cold and hard.  Hummus oh goodness the hummus.  It was like a whole container of salt was poured into it. The lentil soup  OMGggggggg  like wthell!  Looked the diarrhea!!!  Falafal was awful!  Salty salty and oh yup.. salty.  Sorry for those who like this \"trend place\"  but you need to all branch out to the real mediterranean/greek/perssion/Iraqi etc restaurants.   This was just salty blah food."}
{"text":"I come to AZ about 3 times a year for work and always make a stop at Pita Jungle and it's absolutely amazing!  It's even better if you're vegetarian as they have so many vegetarian options.  They literally have everything and everything is always fresh, tasty and presented very well.  They have lots of hummus and other dips, soups, sandwiches, wraps, burgers, salads both cold and grilled options, main plated dishes...literally everything!   They also have a full bar with a great HH starting at 3pm with drink specials and lots of small tapas ranging $1-$3.   In the past I've had several salads, hummus and soups.  This week I landed in PHX at 6pm, worked the next day til 2 and of course I made a stop on my way to the airport.  Yesterday I had the seared ahi tuna and hummus starter.  I wasn't expected the tuna to be merged into the hummus but it tasted great!  I also had the caramelized cauliflower with tahini, I only had a few bites of this as I didn't realize it was fried.  I enjoyed a nice cold Diet Pepsi and my server Dargen was nice enough to give me one for the road as well!  I'll be back in AZ in a few months and will definitely be back here or to one of the other locations they have throughout the city!"}
{"text":"Yum this place is delicious! Very fresh, tons of healthy options and great for vegetarians and vegans!  I came here a year ago when I was in town after a coworker told me I'd love it and he was right, I did!  Of course when I was in the area for work last week I planned my day around having lunch here and once again it hit the spot.  I actually got the same thing I had last year, the grilled vegetable salad but this time I added salmon which was delicious.    It's definitely not a 5 star restaurant but it's definitely 5 stars for what is it, a casual spot for lunch or a place to go for dinner with kids or to get take out from.  Everything is fresh, there's so many delicious breads, dips, sandwiches, salads and hot entrees to choose from.  They also have beer and wine in addition to several sodas and juices.  The staff is friendly and the place is clean, just an all around great go to spot!  Nate was my server last week and he was great, was able to accommodate me adding salmon to my salad, gave me 2 different dressings on the side and he gave me a diet coke to go!  I also needed to pick up some cookies for my customer I was going to visit after lunch and not being from the area, he was kind enough to direct me to the closet grocery store.  I'll be back in town in a few months and you can definitely guess that I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Ahh how I love Pita Jungle so much!  I don't live in AZ so a month ago when I booked to go there for work, I knew that Pita Jungle would be on the list.  I went twice to the Tucson location last week and before leaving the state, had to stop in the Tempe location for one last delicious meal!  I really liked the vibe at the Tempe location, it's different than the others.  I think that with it being on campus, it's got more of a trendy and hip vibe.  The bar area is neat and there's a younger crowd vs the other locations that I've been to.  Of course the food was delicious.  I went for one of my favorite dishes, seared ahi Tuna over 2 dips.  This time around I went for baba ganoush and the red pepper hummus.  Instead of plain Pita bread, I had it with cucumbers and Pita chips.  Those pita chips are to die for!  The service at Pita Jungle is always exceptional and everyone seems very happy to work there!  This past Friday, Stephen was my server at the bar and he was great!  He recommended dips for my dish, was very pleasant and best of all, he gave me a refill on my Diet Coke in a to go cup.  Not being used to the AZ hot, I definitely appreciated being able to take a cold drink with me!  Everything at Pita Jungle is fabulous, I've never come across anything that I didn't like.  I'll be back at the end of May and I'll definitely be back here!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to this location for several years now. The last 2 times I've been in, I've noticed all the servers were wearing black. I asked my server \"why is everyone wearing black?\" He responded and said \"these are our uniforms now.\"  One MAJOR reason I appreciate Pita Jungle is for the individuality of its staff. As a customer, it makes me feel like I can be myself with my own individuality, and fit right in. I'll be honest, I was very bummed to see everyone wearing black. Not to mention the fact that they HAD to wear it. I understand a sense of \"uniform\" BUT believe it or not, black is not black. There are different shades and it actually didn't look very uniform. IF it's a sense of uniform this location is going for, how about actually INVESTING into your staff, and purchasing a nice team shirt for everyone. Otherwise, it just looks cheap and almost controlling of the management to make their team wear a \"uniform\" that isn't provided for them.   With that being said, staff is fantastic, food is wonderful."}
{"text":"Great food awful service! 20 min to get acknowledged constantly asking for service that should be provided. No refills, no silverware waitress dropped food on our table yet never came back to pick it up  and if we asked for the service that should have been provided she was plain rude about it. Worst dinning experience I have ever had. This location is plain awful!. Im not the type to write a bad review but the service was so horrible I felt this location really needs to do something about the servers they hire. I understand that a lot of circumstances can lead to bad service thats why Im usually not the type of person to complain I usually try to put myself in the servers shoes and understand that it might be a bad or busy day. I didn't go at a busy time it was this past Sunday around 4 and we sat at the patio. There weren't many people there yet the wait staff had no time to wait on our table or acknowledge us we constantly had to ask for service and still deal with them constantly forgetting to help us. Steer clear of this location. I have been to the other Pita Jungle locations and have had a great dinning experience. Beware!"}
{"text":"Good food! Great hummus and fast service.  Very professional wait staff.  We went with a diverse group from NJ, DC, WI, WV, NH, IL, & AZ with equally diverse food preferences and were all satisfied and had a great time.  The price for a glass of wine is reasonable.  We ended up going back the next day for lunch."}
{"text":"I love Pita Jungle chains, which are located throughout the city! The food is sooo good (hummus, tzatziki, baba ganoo, gambos con ajo, garlic dip, mussels, etc, etc) & they have bomb happy - reverse happy - hour specials! They have good margaritas $2 & you can try just about all the starters between $2-$3.   The food was good but my drink...I didn't like the fact that I ordered a pitamosa & my waitress brought it to me w. a bug in it. & I didn't like I had to sit there for like 10 mins for her to come back & me have to tell her to take it back.   Also, I noticed the bartender sitting there just talking before bringing \"my\" drink to another table & walking to the kitchen to sit it down & wait for my waitress to bring it to me.?. They were like confused in there & need to step their game up becos other Pita's I have been to have been a lil' bit better in experience.   But, the chefs, I love! They have flavor! Bomb spot for Vegan & Mediterranean lovers. Would love some WIFI, would be nice to add there."}
{"text":"I love this Pita the chef is very humble & speaks every time I see him and the other cooks. The tapas are sooooooo good, fresh, taste bomb & never leaves my stomach upset. Prices are sooo good too during happy hour including really good margaritas. Love this spot, wish it to remain the same! :) Across from the light rail & they also feature local artist paintings for sale on display."}
{"text":"I freaking love Pita Jungle. The only reason I give this a 4 is because it took a really long time for the waitress to get over to our table to even get our drink order. I can't stay away from the jalape√±o cilantro hummus. I order a side of cucumbers and tomatoes to go along with it instead of extra pitas (cause you can never eat all that hummus with the pita they give you alone). They have great freshly brewed iced teas too. Light, refreshing, and fulfilling."}
{"text":"MY HUSBAND AND I LOVE THIS PLACE!!! and now my father in law does also. We took him here for his Birthday and it was great at how good our customer service was! We showed up a little late totally not meaning to, since we were trying to surprise my father in law. This was his first time here and we were trying to get him there without telling him, but at the last minute we just spilled the beans so he can come home. We then rushed there and we were still allowed in. There was still one table with 2 ladies besides ours. We felt bad for being there late, but after planning and waiting all day for this we couldn't give up. The service was GREAT and our food was served fast. Thank you so much Pita Jungle for making that Birthday possible and for satisfying my pregnant cravings at that time!!!"}
{"text":"I've been to the place on Shea a few times and have always been impressed by the food and service. I just moved to central Phoenix and was excited to find  P.J. right down the road.  Same good food, different crappy service.   I ordered for take-out, and didn't realize until I got home that they had not given me my soup. So I called to ask them to credit my card, and was told they \"don't do that.\" Wha...? It's a FACT that you can return things to a credit card the same day of purchase, I do it at my place of business frequently. Instead, they gave me a number to use for \"store credit\" next time I order there.   Sneaky way to skimp on service and keep the change.  Of course I'll be going back, because now I have this credit I have to use up...but it's fast being added to my list of restaurants I love to hate: Oregano's, Houston's, and now Pita Jungle!"}
{"text":"If I could eat their chicken pasta salad every single day, I would. Holy cow, it's so amazing!!! Their hummus is really good too, I always get the original and red bell pepper. So yummy :) plus the environment is right up my alley!!"}
{"text":"Love love love this place! I always get their chicken pasta salad and it's is so amazingly tasty. The chicken is always so perfectly tender and seasoned, and the vinaigrette is to die for!!! I love their hummus too! My favorites are the original and the red bell pepper :) I always look forward to coming here :)"}
{"text":"Are you hungry? Do you like standing in line in a half full restaurant to be ignored? If so, then run to this Pita Jungle and prepare for your jaw to hit the floor as you witness their lack of customer service skills.  Took them 10 minutes to seat the two people in line ahead of me and for the next 5 minutes I was passed by at least 4 other servers before the lady behind the bar (who was swamped with phone orders) came up for air and said she would try to help me in a few.  I'm assuming that meant hours because I continued to wait (stubbornly at this point) and be ignored by the same servers still passing back and forth in front of me.  Don't waste your time here."}
{"text":"Love both the Apache Rd in Tempe and Chandler locations. Great food. I need to go more often!!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch today. Was craving the chipotle black bean burger. I recommend it, especially trying to move towards a more plant based diet. I know I won't go completely vegetarian but meals like this burger definitely gives you options. The portion was big too. I was only able to eat half. I also tried the lemon cilantro mixed beans on the side and it was very good as well. Yum!  The staff were super friendly and very quick to help. I appreciate their service."}
{"text":"The five stars is for the happy hour only.  We got a pizza one time, and it was kind of gross.  The price and quality of the happy hour is awesome."}
{"text":"Lunch to dinner, I still feel that the service is consistent. This place has a nice patio with a great view. The food is never bad. I sometimes feel the need for cholula hot sauce on some non-spicy dishes. If I could recommend, this place needs it's own pepper or sauce to satiate. Although Tabasco and siracha are available on request.  The online website is vegan friendly as well as the menu itself. Though it's just natural that this place is healthier than most other places."}
{"text":"My wife and I generally eat here a couple times per month. Our last visit was pretty disappointing compared to prior visits. We always get the large hummus trio with an extra pita and have become accustomed to the tomato and cucumber slices as well as a couple Greek olives. Our two year old loves snacking on them before he receives his meal. During our last visit we ordered the trio as usual but this time they tossed three chickpeas on top with none of the other items. I'm hoping this was an anomaly but also noticed the menus had changed and prices had gone up. Does anyone know if this is the new standard?  Kids meals are huge and definitely worth every penny. We'll keep going back but I hope they aren't cutting items and raising prices just to increase profits."}
{"text":"Was looking for a meal that was relatively light, yet filling then remembered Pita Jungle!  I've had them during luncheons and love their pita, hummus and chicken and figured I'd make a conscious effort to dine here. I sat on the patio since it was a lovely day outside, but the interior had plenty of seating, high ceiling and natural light.  I ordered the Carmelized Cauliflower with Tahini and a Gyro. The Cauliflower was cooked well and tossed in a Tahini- chipotle sauce and carmelized onions, so delicious and rich! The Gyro was okay, but I am in love with the pita here it's fluffy, soft and substantial. Though the gyro was good, I was not a fan of the gyro meat since it didn't seem that freshly cut and was a bit lacking in flavor. The vegetables and tzatziki sauce were fresh and complete the gyro, The portion is a bit large and was able to take the second half home. I finished with ordering the Baklava here and would say to pass on it, it's not your typically layered Baklava and are of the rolled kind. I found them to be more on the dry side, probably due to the lack of syrup in between the layers. It was also difficultly hard to eat since it was dry and cold in temperature.  Service here was great, staff did well to do frequent check ups on me despite being one of the only people sitting on the patio and refilled water in a timely manner. Price point here is decent for the food. I would say go for the hummus, chicken and side dishes and pass on the gyros and baklava."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been to a couple of the Pita Jungles and we love it! Healthy menu especially right after a good workout! The ambience at this location is very cool. The employees were friendly and fun! I like to get the sampler platter so I can have a taste of everything! We like to go on Saturday afternoons and catch whatever game is playing on the tube. I could see how they would get crowded and loud at night! First visit, go early so you can get educated on the menu and take in the atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Always a healthy, fresh meal. One of my favorites is the hummus and grilled chicken appetizer(which is gynormous) and I have them add in some tabbouleh, then cucumbers on the side. Perfection. All the pitas, and the seasonal specials are always super good. Wine is also inexpensive if the mood strikes. Otherwise, great casual lunch and dinner spot that is extremely reasonable in price for the quality of food you are getting. There is something for everyone here, veggies, kids, etc. If I ever moved from AZ, this is the first place I would come visit upon my return. Parking can get hairy at the Arcadia location, and one time someone actually backed into my car when I was legally parked along a curb but that is hardly Pita Jungle's fault. The douche didn't even leave a note - but I digress and karma is real and nothing would keep me from coming back to Pita!"}
{"text":"Other than the really great happy hour prices, its hit or miss with this place. More often a miss. :(  The food is less than average, the drinks NOT strong ( at least they are inexpensive) , but the service is truly hit or miss.  I'll pass."}
{"text":"This is close to school and our preferred spot for a quick bite in between class.   The jalapeno cilantro hummus is delicious, as is the roasted red pepper hummus and the regular hummus.   I have had both the falafel and spicy chicken wraps, and they both certainly delivered. Beware- They are HUGE! I took the other half home for dinner both times.  The staff is always friendly, always accommodating our large groups and splitting our checks for us without a moan and groan.   BTW- they have options for vegans, vegetarians and carnivores. This place is good for all!"}
{"text":"I LOVE Pita Jungle. I've never had a dish that I didn't like although my go-to favorites are the Lavash Schwarma Wrap, Glazed Chicken Flatbread Pizza and the Mediterranean Chicken Salad. I have been to many locations throughout Phoenix, the food and service is always consistent. I'm never disappointed."}
{"text":"I've been to pita jungle a good amount of times, it's just taken me a while to review this place. I will say I always do enjoy the food here. If you're a vegetarian the choices and options at this place are endless. Happy hour is 3-6 and that is by far the best time you can come here. You can get pita, hummus, cheese and cucumbers for like a $1 each. So smart to come here if you're rly hungry and want to get filled up. Yesterday I went here on a little double date and the four of us got very filling meals for abt $45. I got the spinach and pesto mushroom pizza on lavash. Soooo good! I will say the water that they serve here is not good at all...unless you like arrowhead maybe... Also my service here is never all that great, as the servers don't put much effort in I feel like, so that's why it's rated 4 stars. But over all I love all the Mediterranean vegetarian options here."}
{"text":"I have consistently been disappointed with the service and food.  They have some dishes that are consistent but for the most part I leave wishing I had chosen to eat somewhere else. Last night will be the their last chance in my book. The service was bad. The waiter did not want to wait to take our order put promised our food would be timed but with one bite of appetizer here came the food. The Jumbo grilled shrimp were neither jumbo or grilled. The light tomato sauce sent you fishing for the shrimp. My beans never arrived and my gyro could be purchased from any fast food gyro shop.  Bettina, perhaps if the shrimp had been jumbo and the meal up to par I would bother to give you the servers identity.  But this was an overall disappointment ...not just an inept server."}
{"text":"Analeesa suggested the Mediterranean salad and she was right it was delicious. Thank you for the great service and the delicious food!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has good food but is very loud because there is no carpet on the floor. I thing the menu pricing is high also but again the food is good."}
{"text":"If I ever get stuck in the jungle with only one meal, I want it to be a wrap from Pita Jungle! Not only was my meal tasty good, but it took me FOREVER to try and finish, and I didn't even come close!   I went with the spicy chicken wrap; spicy marinated and grilled chicken, brown rice, mixed beans, tomatoes, squash, zucchini, cauliflower, broccoli, bell peppers and onions. It was a bit late to be eating dinner, so I decided to sub out the pita and asked them to wrap it in lavash instead. What a creation?! The chicken was perfectly seasoned, the veggies were cooked but not mushy, the beans and rice added depth and gave the whole thing texture, and the lavash was crisped to perfection but not burnt. The thing had me swinging on a vine!  With a huge menu of choices, everything from burgers to pizza, salads and starters, the place is out of this jungle. Check out the nutritional facts online if you'd like to go and make a healthy decision (which is pretty easy to do there). Tons of options, good for you food and reasonable prices-Tarzan would be proud."}
{"text":"I love you Pita Jungle, but on this particular occasion, you weren't firing on all cylinders.   Having only been one other time I decided to order my usual, it's probably not \"usual\" if I only had it once, huh? Well, I decided to order what I had last time, how about that? Spicy chicken, beans, rice, a slew of veggies all wrapped up in some wheat pita, figured I'd enjoy it as much as I did last time, but not so much. It was a little off. Unlike last time when the veggies were crisp and I could differentiate between them, this was a pita full of mush, and I could barely get through half before I chucked it. It had good flavor and in PJs defense I took it to go, so maybe something is lost during carryout? In any case, It was good enough that I'll be back, and maybe next time I'll make sure to eat in.  Know Before You Go:  If you're taking it to go, call in your order. It was a zoo when I was there and I had to wait close to twenty minutes."}
{"text":"I've always been kind of anti Pita Jungle. I had it once about 8 years ago and was so underwhelmed, I never had a desire to go back. So when we decided to go here for a work lunch yesterday, I was kind of bummed. But I am now happy to say I am definitely a Pita Jungle fan!  We started with the cilantro jalapeno hummus, which might be the best hummus I've ever had in my life. For my entree, I ordered the seared ahi tuna salad. I will be coming back for this! The ahi was perfectly cooked, and there was plenty of it. The salad is also topped with strawberries, pineapple, and a delicious Asian-style dressing. While it was super light and fresh tasting, it was also really filling. I ended up taking part of it with me for a snack later.  I am so happy I gave Pita Jungle another chance!"}
{"text":"Got our food to go and was my hubby's first time eating from here and lucky for me he LOVED it ! He got a double meat order of the philly steak, and I got the gyro and a small side of my favorite Jalapeno cilantro hummus !! was all perfect !!"}
{"text":"Service is great. Food is filling, delicious and good for you! Definitely some things are on the pricey side but worth the dollar if you ask me. Favorite is spinach pasta salad, add in avocado, grilled shrimp (4 or 2), and fresh mozzarella. 10/10 recommend. Also got the blue (purple) corn chips w the dip, and had lots of left overs and my girl friends loved emmm"}
{"text":"I work in an office directly across the street. This is the second time we have ordered Pita Jungle for a catered office lunch.   The value of PJ is not there for me.  The quality of the food is ok (the chicken is usually dry). It is the value that is lacking. A platter of hummus is 18\"x18\". It has a smear of hummus on the platter, about 1/4 inches deep. The cost is $33.  There is a huge pile of what is supposed to be tabbouli on top. It was mostly parsley. Maybe it is only supposed to be parsley. We also ordered chicken with the brown rice and mixed beans. The beans were interesting, but again, hardly any chicken. We did get enough pickles, onions and pita to last for the rest of the year.  EDIT: I got some backstory to fill in details. Pita Jungle did provide additional items to the people who ordered and picked up the food. Their management also wants customers to be satisfied."}
{"text":"Seriously one of my favorite places to eat at any one of the locations around the valley. I think I would eat here weekly if I could. They have awesome food, hummus and tabbouleh never cease to satisfy. I love their salads and the chicken schwarma rocks. The service is always good and the atmosphere is always fun with changing art pieces. The newest tapas/ happy hour is awesome and worth taking advantage of. Simply delicious!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to Pita jungle at Desert Ridge for about a year and every time we have dinner here we request Jen Allan as our server. She is amazing with kids, great customer service. She remembers everything what you like and what you don't like highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Pita Jungle has been making changes! New Happy Hour menu and Reverse Happy Hour Menu with lots of yummy offerings, including scallops, shrimp, hummus, baba ganoush and quite a few more. And don't forget the drinks are on special too!  Happy hour is 3-5:30 and then 9 to close. Pita Jungle also seems to be sprucing up the menu, with quite a few new offerings, rotating specials menu, and even an Earth Day menu! I had the mahi mahi on ciabatta and it was very tasty, though a little too much bread. I also branched out and tried the red lentil soup - I needed a re-fill it was so good!   And my date loved his tomato basil soup.   I find the food at Pita Jungle to always be healthy, consistent and flavorful. I love the lentil fetoosh salad - if you've never tried it, get it! And my next favorite is the pita burrito - who new that mixed beans could be so good?  I love that they are playing with the menu, and working to make Pita Jungle even more great than it already is.   The location in Tempe has a good location near ASU. They always have rotating art work for sale, and the space itself is very open and decorated very earthy and hip. The servers are very trendy and hipster-ish, and always very friendly. I do complain that the service is very slow, especially during this last visit. It may have been compounded by the fact that I was starving and it was 9pm, but the food took forever to arrive! But if you are with a fun group (they will cater larger parties - no reservations, but call ahead), the wait can be part of the experience.    Pita Jungle is definitely a regular stop for me when I'm craving something light, healthy, and delicious."}
{"text":"When I first moved here this was my go to place! I loved the hummus and pita plus a fun, unique, atmosphere! I still take visitors here but I never know what to expect when visiting pita. Sometimes they have delicious food and sometimes it's very dry and over cooked - I wish it was more consistent! I recommend the hummus trio with chicken - add a pita and I get the chicken philly pita!"}
{"text":"I love this location! I frequently order pick-up during my lunch breaks. Michael is always so friendly and enthusiastic. I think that's his name...He often works the bar area and takes the phone orders and handles the pick-ups! Anyways, he's the epitome of customer service and is sure to put a smile on anyways face. Grey at multi-tasking, as well. Keep up the great work, Michael (I hope that's your name)."}
{"text":"Took my family to PJ today. Wonderful fresh food. Try the roasted cauliflower.....wow! Fantastic!!!!"}
{"text":"Great service, sat at bar(dining solo)... Great food and the only place I've eaten so far that I will def come back to! Yumm yumm"}
{"text":"This is my FAVORITE place to eat in the Phoenix area! The food is delicious and easy to call ahead and make an Oder for carry out or to go. I mostly do a bunch of the apps (hummus, tabouli, tzatziki) as well as the gyros.... basically this is what I get every single time and could eat it every day."}
{"text":"My three stars are for the food only.  The food was good.  Service, on the other hand, was not so hot.  We were seated promptly and then no one came to even take a drink order for almost 10 minutes.  My daughter sat happily coloring.  One thing about this location that I noticed.....the tables seem to be right on top of one another.  The women sitting next to us looked irrated that a child was now sharing her seat.  The guys on the other side of us were using bad language in their conversation. I don't mind being seated close to others but others mind when you bring a child into the mix.  In my opinion we should have been seated at a table that was not so close to others or close to the other children that were there.  After 10 minutes our server finally showed and apologized for the wait.  He took our order and the food arrived fairly quickly.    My daughter loves the pasta here and I had the Chicken Del Sol.  This is like a southwest chicken stew and it was very good.  Flavorful and filling.  Again the ice tea here is the best!  I could drink a gallon of it.   And our server was kind enough to give me a to go cup with a refill and he refilled my daughter lemonade as well.    This location could use some work, in my opinon.  The front doors look very worn and the interior here needs some sprucing up.  And maybe some reaargement of the tables too."}
{"text":"I'm bumping up a star.  This location has a really nice atmosphere and the customer service has been very good!  I think the kids menu is one of the best around.  My daughter loves all the choices.  It's a great idea!  The Red Pepper Hummus is delish!!  There are so many different things to choose from and it's all really healthy.  I love Pita Jungle!"}
{"text":"I love going to this place. I usually go with my sister to catch up with great conversation and great, healthy food. I had thought in the past that it was a fast greek chain like pita pit, but it's actually a sit down restaurant. We ALWAYS start with the Fruit & Cheese Fantasia. It is SO good, and it's gigantic. The fruit and the cheese are such good quality its hard to stop eating. I would order the mediterranean chicken pita, sometimes we would be so full from the fruit and cheese we would share one or take home half. The service is good, they are polite and timely with your order. I would recommend pita jungle."}
{"text":"First day open and Pita jungle on University and mill is killing it! The salmon entr√©e I had was cooked perfectly and it was delicious. The staff was great and the place looks awesome."}
{"text":"I am a Pita Jungle lover - so it is with a bit of frustration that I write this review.  I have wanted to try their Happy Hour tapas for years now.  I always stare at the $2 and $3 menu thinking a lot of things I love are on there and it would be great to get a meal of a ton of small plates.  So, I finally made it yesterday and what a disappointment.  I ordered the Lemon chicken and hummus (best two things), olives, feta, mussels, dolmades and falafel.    My first major problem with this visit was the amount of time it took to order everything.  I ordered in 3 rounds and it took a full 15-20 mins to get 2-3 tapas in each case.  That's a bit too long for the tapas I ordered.  Nothing should have taken more than 5 minutes to cook maximum.  And I was only one of 4 tables that were seated.    The olives, feta, dolmades and falafel were bland but ok.  Then comes the mussels, that were forced open so their shells were cracked when they were served.  So, now I waited 15 minutes for my feta (just lumps of cold feta cheese with a small garnish of tomato, cucumber and onion) and my inedible mussels (3-4 mins cooking time) in the empty restaurant.  When the server came back by 5 minutes later I explained to her what was wrong with the mussels and said I don't want these, and she confirmed \"Oh yeah, that's bad\" and walked away with them.  I mentioned after her, unknowing if she was going to put in another order which I would now no longer trust from there, I don't want a replacement order, and she said, \"Yeah, I got it\".  Never an apology, or any remorse in her voice, actually just the opposite - a little attitude.  Never an offer of a menu back to order something else - I was still hungry.  Oh well, it must have been a bad day because I have had this server before and she is generally lovely and on top of things.    Anyway, I will be back as usual, ordering my mediterranean chicken salad, but it will be to go as usual and I will not be trying the tapas again any time soon."}
{"text":"I eat at this place a lot. LOVE their food, and normally service is really good. Bad experience today. We ordered our usual, one my wife and I split all the time. A side as an appetizer and a main dish. We normally leave full, once in a while we will split the rice pudding as well. TODAY they had a NEW COOK. That was only part of the issue. The portions were at least one third less than normal. I said something when the food was dropped off because it had happened to both dishes. The girl shrugged it off, but she was not our waiter. Our waiter came by at the end, I told him about it and how she shrugged it off. I then saw him talk to the manager. They did nothing except hopefully next time it will be better. We actually left hungry today and need to stop somewhere else. I then called the manager when I got home, who basically shrugged it off even more and I told him we were regulars who order the same thing all the time. He then said our next meal would be on the house, but that all depends if I risk it again. Disappointing when a place keeps upping the price on a dish and then begins scaling back the portions after raising the prices - and then acts stupid when someone notices it.  After talking with someone further we went back to try them out again. Back to their usual good food. BUT BEWARE - these healthy options are loaded with fats, good fats, but fats. High calories as well. The caramelized cauliflower is actually deep fried, so do not think it is oven roasted! Check on ingredients for many  of their things."}
{"text":"Portion sizes were good and almost a little too big. Good thing we were VERY hungry and it was hot outside.   The atmosphere was nice; earthy colors to the walls and a tree with lights. Not overly bright or artificial.   I got the jalapeno cilantro hummus that came with pitas and my boyfriend got the chicken wrap. He couldn't finish his and brought it to go.   I will have to say the food is a bit pricey all around though for what you get."}
{"text":"I have to finally say something about this particular location. I have been going to PJ all over the valley for 10 years and I am a huge fan of the food.   My wife will refuse to go back and when I convince her to try again something always happens. As an overall experience we have had cold food, 2 orders wrong, I had to go to the bar and get our own water since the waiter never wanted too. My biggest issue is that the food is not consistent, since I used to go so much I know exactly what I want and how it tastes, and at this location you never know what you are going to get. Seems like no one really cares what is going on here.   I will go back to PJ just not at this location and not with my wife."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place but it wasn't very good..I ordered the Philly steak and the meat was just bla no flavor, mushy and  plain...the cheese was not melted. I don't think I'll be back"}
{"text":"Here's the thing, I think Pita Jungle is good, but not as fantastic as so many other people seem to think.  I'm a vegetarian and honestly, I don't think their veggie friendly options are that great.  I've had the veggie burger and I thought it was bland. I've had the falafel and thought that My Big Fat Greek Restaurant can do it better. However, their lavosh pizza with the kalamata olives is reallly good and their hummus ain't so bad either. My bird eating friend really enjoys their chicken pasta salad type dish and thinks it's the best thing since sliced bread. I think Pita Jungle gets an extra star from me just because it's next to the Gelato Spot and if you've read my review, you know how I feel about that place."}
{"text":"Spinach and Pesto Pizza is bomb dot com!  They have great service, too. We came on a business lunch and our leftovers were prepared in boxes for us and they gave us to-go drinks! Gotta try their iced teas, by the way.   Only complaint is parking which is no fault of Pita Jungle. It's almost impossible to find a good spot like....at any point in the week. Ugh."}
{"text":"Melissa our server rocks the house. Don't miss the cilantro jalape√±o hummus . Loved the broiled chicken pita - be sure to request feta and garlic sauce. Saut√©ed veggies were off the chain! Coming back! Who needs ham for Easter?"}
{"text":"Food is great! Staff is awesome. Cool story... So I called in an order for a Lavash wrap. When I arrived I told the host my order. Well... she rang it in again.  The Manager then came over to delete the 2nd order out of the system, and  I shouted \"It was my fault, not hers. I wasn't very clear on me picking up a to-go order.\" He looks at me and says \"Hey... wanna another one?\" So I got a 2 for 1 lavash wrap that day. I was hungry af too"}
{"text":"Had the worst experience at this location ordering take out. I normally love Pita Jungle but last night we ordered Green Soup and it was like a bunch of peas smashed in water with some salt. The black bean burger was not even cooked and the potatoes were completely cold. This is after only 5 minutes of leaving the restaurant. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"I recently went vegetarian after being a vegan for a quite awhile. Normally, the only option I have out to eat is French fries and nothing that has flavor for sure. The Red Quinoa with Cilantro Jalapeno Hummus was the best dish I have ever tasted and the service was AMAZING!!! I'll be back for sure with everyone I know!"}
{"text":"Great quality food reasonable prices. Low ambience waiters dress very casual ??? Very crowded around lunch and dinner It is a definate must"}
{"text":"I love Pita Jungle. I am so glad a location has opened near me. Everyone always has a wonderful sense of humor and tolerates my sarcasm well. They have decent prices and everything I have eaten there has been really tasty."}
{"text":"I tried Pita Jungle for the first time and I am deeply disappointed that I was not greeted with:   \"Welcome to the jungle.\"  What a missed opportunity! Seriously!  I found the food to be pretty OK, not outstanding.  I had the chicken schwarma (aka Mediterranean chicken wrap on the menu) and it was no schwarma from Al Hana at Biaz Market, my friend.  The chicken was plentiful, and cubed. The lettuce was fresh and plentiful.  The sauce was some kind of garlicky-tahini-hummus tasting concoction that was fine.  The portion was just fair for the nearly 8 dollar price tag.  My server Valerie was a real treat so I would rate the service as 4 star even though that doesn't seem to jive with other reviews."}
{"text":"The lentil soup here are the best in  town and I come just for that . M sure the food here is good and healthy cuz it's always crowded when I come over . Great place for healthy eating !"}
{"text":"Just went back into Pita Jungle since the original Tempe location. I worked at that location for many years and I can say that over the years many things have changed.. I like the ambiance and the menu is altogether the same...  However when I go to any Pita Jungle there are 3 things I can always count on:  1) The Hummus w/ Chic is always going to be delicious  2) They will always have the best Iced Tea (I prefer the berry and passion fruit)  3) The music will always be good...  If it's your first time I'd recommend a Humus Trio and a Barney Palmer (1/2 Passport Tea 1/2 Pita Jungle fresh squeezed lemonade)"}
{"text":"I have never seen Pita Jungles before cuz I live in Northern California, but having tried them during a recent trip to Phoenix for Spring Training, all I can say is: CAN SOMEONE PLEASE OPEN A PITA JUNGLE FRANCHISE IN NO CALI??  I had the broiled chicken salad and my date had a chicken pita, and we shared a roasted pepper hummus appetizer.  The hummus was wonderful, and since my date had never had hummus before, it was a great introduction.  Our entrees were massive.  I think mine had two full chicken breasts worth of sliced meat on it, and the veggies in the salad very fresh.  A light dressing completed it to perfection.  I took my leftover chicken home and the next day wrapped it in a pita for a nice lunch.  Service was great, food terrific, and prices reasonable.  I really really hope these start catching on in California so we have some up here.  I'm certain they'd do great business!"}
{"text":"We love eating here.  The food is excellent and our order is always ready in a timely manor. Not to mention the staff has been very friendly!"}
{"text":"you cant really go wrong with pita jungle. There food is always fresh and good no matter what location you are going to. There are very different vibes based on the location though. tempe location is pretty hipster while the gilbert one is great to bring your kids too. I mean that makes sense right. The chandler location is on a lake which is nice for dates. So lets get to the food, and lets start with the hummus. All flavors are delicious. The jalepano cliantro is the best. For lunch sometimes I get the hummus with chicken its a great lunch! There portions are huge any pasta and salad your going to end up taking home. lentil fatoosh salad is AMAZING. I was actually nicknamed \"the fatoosh\" for a while because it was all I ate for a summer. anywaysssss after that the pasta salad is great! the 1000 beans is good. the lavash wraps are great I mean they are all pretty good. If you can get there for their happy hour its a great deal. small plates or tapas for around $2 a piece and they are great for the after work munchies. Beer selection is not that great though. hope you enjoy this place as much as I do!"}
{"text":"my boyfriend and i LOVE this restaurant! we try to go to a pita jungle at least once a week. I love the pasta n chicken with the lemon dressing! and the HUMMUS is to die for! the very best i have ever eaten.. the bread is warm and soft... SO much for not eating alot!  i highly recommend any and all pita jungles~!"}
{"text":"I love Pita Jungle. Their macroplatter with jalapeno hummus is my absolute favorite. You would never know their food is healthy because it tastes so good. I wish there was a location in Litchfield Park or Goodyear, but might be better for my wallet that there isn't one. Their variety of ice teas is also one of my favorite things. Overall a very nice place to pick up lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"I love the Cilantro Jalapeno hummus from Pita Jungle, it is crave worthy! So yesterday I was near this location & stoped in. I have to tell all of you that this location has the best staff ever. I rarely rave about service, but here you feel like a regular even on your first visit! The manager stopped by to chat, even carried off used plates for us! Ryan was our server & he was awesome - next time I crave hummus I will drive back across town to eat here."}
{"text":"I've been dining at Pita Jungle for the past 13 years and this location is the worst! Food is good but that's a Pita Jungle guarantee. Service average but again common to all Pita Jungles. It's the seating arrangement and the extreme volume. EVERYTHING ECHOS!! Hurts my ears, it's positively headache inducing. Eat at Pita Jungle but pick another location."}
{"text":"I love Pita Jungle. All locations have delicious and fresh foods. They will let you order off menu, if it's in the kitchen they will do it for you. The food and selection at Pita J are 5-stars!   However, the Shea/74th St location has a few drawbacks. There is almost always a wait as seating is limited. The staff aren't super friendly or attentive and service can be a bit slow.  But the real drawback to this location is the parking situation. They share a lot with a busy movie theater and several other businesses. This makes finding parking near impossible. I have twice parked my car across Shea next to the car wash due to the lack of parking. Don't let parking deter you but do keep it in mind when coming to this location."}
{"text":"Had a great lunch here today. The servers were busy yet attentive. They had mother's day  specials (free dessert!) And a fun atmosphere.   I love their humus and chicken plate... so good! My friend tried the coconut curry special and was satisfied.    Their green tea is awesome too!"}
{"text":"How can you do better than this for fresh food at a great value in a bohemian asmosphere?  You can't.  The hummus is smooth (and great with chicken), the gyros are stuffed with flavor, and the signature dish is the chicken del sol... Get it in you."}
{"text":"I had an outrageously delish lentil fetoush salad here the other night with only 15 minutes to eat. Oops, I was late.  What a contrast between this location and the one in Arcadia. It was a Wednesday night. ASU must have been between sessions and it was nearly empty. The decor is what? modern rustic? Is that a theme? It was also a bit dark, possibly a bit dirtier. The gentleman who brought our dishes had a bandaged hand/wrist - how sanitary is that?  I imagine if I came a different time, it would have a much different vibe and the food would be just as great. I love pita jungle. They have great choices and great tasting food, the staff is nice and service is quick."}
{"text":"I love their food - but I am torn, I can't give them four stars because there service REALLY needs to improve!  I just go there to practice being Zen-like!  No matter how bad the service is I just smile!  In addition, I only sit outside because it is really loud inside which is far from enjoyable."}
{"text":"As I had wrote in my previous review, I have always LOVED the food at Pita Jungle. However, now I am blown away by the service and attention to customer satisfaction.  The current manager, Kevin, cared so much about retaining us as customers and responded to our post from almost two years ago.  I am very happy to see this change in direction from the management and see no reason not to become a regular at Pita Jungle once again."}
{"text":"Love Pita Jungle!   Quick fix for Mediterranean and middle eastern food with a relaxing environment and very accommodating and friendly service. Have any special requests or concerns about ingredients? No problem! The servers know their food and the chefs are able to make adjustments as needed. The owners are usually there, and the food and service never fall short.  There is always something on the menu to try, and their daily specials offer new experiences that keep you coming back for more.  Hummus is just right (try the cilantro-jalepeno hummus), baba ganoosh is my favorite dip, and they do falafel crispy, light, and full of spice.  Salmon, Mahi Mahi, Chicken combo, Chicken Del Sol... they're all great! The side of beans is warm and comforting, and the light and fluffy garlic dip goes great with the chicken. We always get the tabouli (taboule), and usually always get more to-go.  Mediterranean Platter serves great as an appetizer to split. Lavosh Pizza is light, crisp, and is packed with flavor. Whether you want a salad, a wrap, a healthy burger,  a larger entree, or all of the above, Pita Jungle is the right place to try authentic and healthy food.  Frequently used for carry-out, Pita Jungle serves large portions at great prices.  This location has outdoor seating and also has a live band play at some point during the week. Artwork on the wall is for sale to support your community, and a full bar is available for those special occasions."}
{"text":"Love Pita Jungle! This is location we come to most often; the staff is super friendly and the atmosphere is a little more relaxed than some of the other locations we have tried.

The only thing we don't like about coming to Pita Jungle is we nearly always end up getting the same thing! The food that we get is so good, but we try to force ourselves to sample the big variety on the menu. Their daily specials offer new experiences that keep you coming back for more.

The Lavosh Pizza is light, super crisp, and is packed with flavor.  If you're looking for a good sampler, try the Mediterranean Platter. It serves great as an appetizer.  This is the place to stop for an extremely casual and friendly lunch or dinner. Healthy food, good portions, and a community-driven environment make it a restaurant that stands out from the rest."}
{"text":"Just came from a visit at this location. Very friendly service, we had James as our waiter and we was humorous and accommodating of our group.  We were informed we came during happy hour (really cheap and very small portions of appetizers, and cheap bottles of beer). They had two special menu cards, which other Pita Jungle locations don't often have. We tried a few of the happy hour tapas, and a few different chicken dishes throughout our visit. Nothing was extraordinary, but the environment of Pita Jungle is always uplifting.  Great place for a casual meal or a date, the art on the wall is for sale (support your local artists), and the service is really nice. There is outdoor seating available, and the menu is vast enough to keep you coming back for more. Take-out service has been fast in my experience with other locations, and the pricing is just right."}
{"text":"I was visiting my cousin and as soon as she picked me up she suggested this place.  I'd never heard of it before, but she highly recommended it, and she didn't let me down!  We both ordered the falafel pita (I was going to get mine on the rice instead, but changed my mind and the last minute, and I'm glad I did!).  The flavors were light and refreshing and all blended well together.  It was a little messy to eat, but that's what a good pita is!  We also had the roasted cauliflower with tahini, which was well-cooked and delicious too.  Service was good, we sat around chatting for a while so our server was good about checking in without hovering.  They have a nice outdoor patio, which we took advantage of (it's well shaded so still enjoyable even in the heat)."}
{"text":"Now I realize Pita Jungle is a Phoenix-area institution, but seriously, it really isn't that good.  I just don't think there are many places here that serve good mediterranean style food for people to compare.  And on the flip side, people I know who love good pitas/shwarma avoid PJ like the plague.  Considering my review won't dent their rating one bit amidst all of the \"rave\" reviews this place gets, I'm only going to highlight a few thoughts I have.  Hummus isn't hard to make, and while theirs is good, it's not absolutely amazing.  Plus, the amount of tahini they put in it makes it very tasty.  But also really high in fat and calories, and unnecessary to put that much in.    Their pitas are borderline unacceptable.  Perhaps people eating here have never had good fresh pita, but theirs is dry, almost stale tasting, and cold.  Their shwarma (chicken) is not shwarma.  It's just grilled chicken.  How is this shwarma? Because it's in a pita?  It is also completely absent of any flavor whatsoever.  Don't get me wrong, I'm not expecting the most authentic mediterranean food.  But this is so far from the real thing they should strongly reconsider naming it \"Pita-like Jungle\".  Or Pita-esque.  Pseudo-pita?  The possibilities are endless.  One of these days (maybe, but who knows until how long) a real mediterranean restaurant will open that serves real mediterranean food.  Until that happens though, I guess PJ will still be around jacking people for cash and laughing in the back room about it."}
{"text":"I don't know why on earth I let my coworkers talk me in to going to PJ.  After going to a couple locations in the past and having mediocre meals, I said \"what the hey\" and decided to give it another chance.  It's like I have annual amnesia.  With that being said, I came in impartial and gave it a whirl.  First off, it really cheeses me off that the first thing I see on the menu was the statement \"art of eating healthy\".  While I generally would say that you can eat healthy there, as I looked around the restaurant, few people were eating healthy, and in fact many of the menu options are pretty unhealthy as well.  I ordered a yellowfin tuna \"burger\" on whole-wheat with a side of potatoes.  It came out looking like a sad piece of tuna on a bun.  The tuna was seasoned with salt and pepper, and it was somewhat room temp. and dry.  It was cooked properly inside (seared rare), but the quality of the tuna was poor or it wasn't prepared properly - it had a tough skin that was somewhat stringy.  Almost akin to silverskin on beef.  I ate it anyways because I was hungry.  It was served with an orange colored sauce of some sort - I thought it was yogurt but couldn't tell.  It was absolutely flavorless.  On a positive note, the potatoes were good.  The service was lousy.  Look, I get the food here is probably healthier than many other mediterranean options in Phoenix.  But seriously, why does it have to be so bland?  I'm convinced you can make more flavorful food just as healthy.  Not more fat, but how about some seasoning?  Exotic spices?  A well marinated chicken breast perhaps?  A nice harissa?  Ground turkey kebab (kefta)?  Sumac anyone?  I guess I'll just have to try PJ next year when I return for another meal."}
{"text":"Nonchalant, attentive but not in a bothersome way. Food was good, and our waitress was cool. I had a good experience!"}
{"text":"Healthy, a lot of food, and I got the chicken philly cheese steak on lavish bread. Great place for lunch"}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday night, it was still fairly busy for two hours past the normal dinner hours. We started with the hummus and pita. Most places don't get the pita to hummus ratio right, it's always way too much hummus to way too little pita. They were happy to oblige with additional pita though. 3/4 of us got the falafel dish. I personally had the falafel bowl. It was exactly what I wanted! It could've used some romaine, but the pickles gave it a nice crunch. I would definitely come back here for lunch. Would love to try their veggie burger. Gold star for the service as well!"}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed! I've gotten the cilantro jalape√±o hummus several times and it was amazing. However, this time it was flavorless, watery and we got the large size which barely covered the bottom of the container we got it in. We were BEYOND disappointed. We called to voice our concern and were met with excuses and the grand old option to come back in at another time and get another large portion for the price of a small. Can you tell me why I could pay even a cent for crap food again?"}
{"text":"I met a friend for lunch. The meet-up time was noon. When I arrived at 12:03pm, it was already packed. The misters were misting away which considering it was 95 degrees outside was perfect. I stepped inside and the entryway was blocked with other patrons waiting either to place a \"to-go\" order or waiting to be seated. An employee stopped and asked several patrons if they were there waiting to meet someone, to which they stated no. I was not asked. I briefly scanned the room to see if I saw my friend and as I was about to turn and walk out the door to wait outside, I saw my friend walking towards me and waving as he had already secured us a table.   Ken and I sat and chatted comfortably for at least 20 minutes before we placed our order. We weren't made to feel as though we had to rush and clear our table which was appreciated. I wanted a Chinese chicken salad which they don't carry but our server was kind enough to make several suggestion. I tried their Mediterranean  Chicken salad and Ken chose their Curry Chicken wrap. The portions were more than enough and amply enough for both if us to take leftovers home. We shared a slice of the homemade carrot cake. It was perfect.    This location had a nice, clean, vibrant atmosphere. It turns out it was Ken's first time ever being to a Pita Jungle. I'm glad that I picked a great spot to meet up with an old acquaintance."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. LOVE the downtown location. Walked in, there were about 10 open tables. We were told it would be a 5 minute wait. 2 people walked in right after us and were seated right away, as we were still waiting to be seated. After we were finally at our table it took about 10 minutes for anyone to take our drink order. I ordered lemonade. I received a mango flavored drink. They can't get anything right. I will not be returning to this location."}
{"text":"The food was fresh and the server we had was very attentive. Thanks \"Ace\" for giving us the best service that we have ever had at Pita Jungle. We will be back again for sure!"}
{"text":"This place has great food and customer service. The humus with the chicken is very good. And the fruit is fresh and delicious the spicy humus is my favorite."}
{"text":"My family and I enjoy dining at Pita Jungle for their reverse happy hour (from 9pm to close). We especially like the grilled lemon chicken, hummus, and tomato and mozzarella platter. Last week we stopped in for a late dinner and it took any single server about 15 minutes to come greet us. Many staff members looked at us, and saw that we had not been helped (we did not even have menus) but keep walking. My family loves this location because it is very convenient and the food is always on point (my favorite dish is the macro platter). We are both shocked and upset at the lack of customer service we received during our last visit."}
{"text":"I haven't shared the poor service experiences other Yelpers have expressed; I've been to Pita Jungle a few times now and it has always been excellent food and reasonable -- perhaps not exceptional, but quite reasonable -- service by tatooed and pierced waitstaff.  The Mediterranean platter is especially excellent, under ten dollars generously apportioned to fill a take-home box for at least one additional meal.  This is food that just makes you feel good.  Pita Jungle features local art for sale on the walls.  It's often fun to see what they have new in."}
{"text":"Service was quick and efficient. I ordered a beed gyro and 2 extra pitas. The beef was cold but had good flavor. I got the feeling my gyro was pre-made because 1) it came out really fast and 2) the pita was falling apart like it had been sitting with the filling in it for a while. It was a fairly large portion.  I had their home made lemonade to drink and it had a kind of funny taste to it. Probably would not order it again."}
{"text":"Today was my first time eating here and our waitress Alex was the best! She was really patience with us and answered our questions about the menu.... She really made our first experince memorable!  Last but def not least... The food was really fresh and the portions were big! We got the sharwarma I think thats how u spell ... So delish ! Can't wait to try out more things on the menu... Excited for happy hour!"}
{"text":"I love pita jungle and this location, since it seems to be bigger than the others. Awesome hummus and great Shwarma Chicken. Go check it out. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I love this Pita Jungle better than the one in Tempe for one reason. It's a little more open between tables and it's not so noisy.  Plus only being 5 minutes from my house makes it that much more convenient. Other than that the food is excellent (Stir fried vegetables with noodles and tofu is full of WIN.)  I will definitely eat there as long as it's open there."}
{"text":"From wraps to entrees, salads to sandwiches, this wholesome and exotic menu is as artistic as it is edible.  I like to order the carmelized cauliflower, which is one of the side dishes, as an appetizer.  It sates your immediate hunger without filling you up, so the meal can be enjoyed.  There was one year span when I only ordered the turkey pesto wrap--  It took me about a year before I was ready to move on to the other items on the menu.  Since then I have had many of the salads and dishes.  I can't say I have ever been disappointed.  The atmosphere is very relaxed, in an uber hip somewhat pretentious way, but it is tolerable.  The quality of the food makes up for all the foolios with ironic tattoos.  The wait staff is surprisingly attentive, however the service has been hit or miss in the past.  Nothing unforgivable though.  Again, the food quality makes up for any minor issues.  I have been to some of the other locations too, and they are equally good, but the original on Apache is still my favorite.  Menu Highlights:  All Wraps (all kinds-o-wraps)  Lavosh pizzas (individual sized flatbread pizzas)  All salads (I get the Lentil Fetoosh)  --  This is just one of those places where your personal taste will dictate what you order.  Order something outside your comfort zone, and I'm sure you'll find a new favorite."}
{"text":"This restaurant serves good, thoughtful Mediterranean food.  They have many healthy, gluten free dishes as well as tasty Greek style hummus, falafel, light southwest inspired entrees with an odd sprinkling of curry ones too.  They also offer salads, salmon, chicken options, pita sandwiches (which a very filling) and pizzas.   The reason why this location doesn't get such high marks is the service and atmosphere don't live up to the quality of the food.  We find the greeters are usually disinterested, don't bother to check you are behind them as they walk off to assign you to a table.  The layout is like a long train carriage which open up at the back a bit.  But you do get bumped from time to time by someone serving the table beside or opposite yours which is irritating.  Once your order is taken there is a longer than necessary wait for cold apps (3 types of hummus and a plate of tzatziki - 15 minutes) and the restaurant doesn't have that many tables to warrant that amount of time.  The other thing that irritates us at this particular branch is once served the servers have a knack of ignoring any attempt to catch their attention to remedy any problem or add something new to the order, they also don't check back in until at least 10 minutes into your entree to check everything is ok, so the need to have more water or your drink refilled is voided because you are basically finished your meal.  This not a place to linger, but it does have good food and even better they do take out.  Enjoy."}
{"text":"I want to give Kevin credit for being responsive on Father's Day. I don't want to be unfair. That said, there will be no further positive comments on this update.  Per his request, I emailed Kevin my phone number and he quickly called me. The conversation wasn't exactly satisfying. I was told that the on site manager didn't realize how unhappy I was because \"I seemed fine\" - I explained that I wasn't going to lose my cool in front of my wife, my aunt, and my six month old. I was told I should have given the on site manager the chance to fully make things right - I explained that I didn't trust him at all once he acknowledged he saw us being neglected but didn't intervene until we complained. We discussed the expired coupons. I pointed out that it's cool they'd be willing to honor them, but it's halfway through 2018 (they've had time to print new ones) AND he missed multiple times that there was no reason for me to go back to that Pita Jungle because it's halfway across town. He told me multiple times that the on site manager was a good manager - glad he defends his employees, but that wasn't my experience, unfortunately. He then explained the corporate structure, and why I wasn't going to be getting anything other than I'd already gotten - which made me question why we got onto the phone together to begin with. He ended the call by saying he would see what else he could do.  He emailed me shortly later asking for my address, and saying he'd have non-location-specific gift cards mailed to me. It's been two weeks, and I haven't seen them. How long do I have to wait?"}
{"text":"This Pita Jungle had some blemishes... the pita bread was hard and my garlic potatos were different than other locations."}
{"text":"This food was so delicious! I love The tabouli, grape leaves, and falafel. Very tasty!"}
{"text":"I definitely have to say this one of my cheap favorite restaurant around.  I can spent $6 (including tip) and get a decent size plate of DELICIOUS hummus and a pita.  I would have to say this beats going to some fatty hamburger joint.  So all those people that are sick of eating MD's try this joint. Pita jungle is a relaxed restaurant atmosphere to come chill with your friends.  The employees are friendly, food is great, and several cute waitresses =)."}
{"text":"I come here all the time. Over all it is good. The  wait staff could be a little nicer, but the food is great.   The outside sitting is too crowded."}
{"text":"I loved just about everything I experienced  about this place!  Wonderful service st the bar ion a Saturday aroma be 12:30 pm.  Really fresh ingredients in my roasted veggie salad.  Loved the dressing and spices.  Bloody Mary was small but tasty.  Prices seem a little high but you get fresh and super tasty food.  Sangria was alright.  Hummus was great!"}
{"text":"new location, same horrible service!! they just can't get it right!!! Food was sub par because it took so long to get quality service. They go hand in hand. I had to politely remind the staff that there were 4 tables sitting outside still waiting to get greeted. After the poor service & messed up meals, I told the manager the problems and he worked to correct them & was grateful that I said something to him, but u would think it would get better... Nadda even worse! Disappointing experience for myself & son (who is 3). At one point, my son asked to go next door to RA as he was just bored sitting and waiting for juice, ketchup, & his dessert."}
{"text":"Pita Jungle is awesome.   I could stop there, but I won't.    The atmosphere is casual, yet professional.  The staff is laid back and friendly, the kind of people you could just kick back and hang out with.    The food is good, and you get what you pay for.  I love the chicken pasta salad, it tastes great, and there's always some left over for lunch the next day.    I have been impressed at PJ's steady growth, it seems like every time I come back, there's another store opening.  I'd say they're worth a try."}
{"text":"Great food.  Very unique atmosphere for a Mediterranean restaurant.  Will defenatly stop by again when in the area."}
{"text":"So how many different ways can you serve a pita? Well this place challenges all the laws of physics of the pita. Yes, it is good, and yes, it has a great menu. However, what I liked most was the diverse staff in the dead center of  DNA molecularly cloned Dolly-esque Scottsdale. They had to bus these people in from Phoenix, or Tempe. Like a diverse, artsy,  school equality program. They traded fake blondes, and muscularly tanned, ex-football jocks, who use way too much product in their hair, for artsy, unique, individuals. I wonder where the Scottsdale exchange workers went to? Anyway, if you want a cool lunch place, to kick back, talk to friends, or are just tired of cliched Scottsdale life, check this place out. (disclaimer: I do not reside in Scottsdale, but unfortuntely have to work in Scottsdale) I just pretend it's a Desert-ificated Norman Rockwell painting as  I drive by row after row of perfectly manicured landscapes. If Normal Rockwell lived in Scottsdale he would have changed his name to N. Roc Wells His friends call him \"Roc\""}
{"text":"Excellent food and reasonable prices. I had curry chicken salad which was fabulous and huge. The waitress was excellent. During the week for dinner be there before 5:30 otherwise it gets packed, especially when it's too hot to sit outside."}
{"text":"I always get the mediterranean platter here and it is always tasty.  Good, healthy, reasonably priced food with okay service."}
{"text":"The Shawarma was great but was a little short on the hummus. There were several tables open when we arrived and it took quite a while (30 minutes) for us to get seated."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Went there last night after an OChem lab with a friend.  We ate good.  Hummus, Pita Wrap, Couscous salad.   The hummus was amazing, I have to admit it was my first hummus experience but it was great.  Everything was super fresh and light, which was great.  The pita wrap was amazing, again you could taste the freshness. Everything was cooked perfectly.  The service was great, food was fast, everything was perfect."}
{"text":"Late review: Called in an order for pickup a couple weeks ago, they said would be ready in 20 minutes, I go to get it and end up waiting an additional  20 minutes and 4-5 other people got their orders before mine. Some of these people had even larger orders too, mine was about 3 things on the menu. Don't know if the order wasn't put in, it wasn't explained other than the kitchen was backed up, but it was frustrating because I was late back to work. Manager offered a free drink which was nice, but honestly for that long of a wait I would've comped part of the meal. First time I've been let down by Pita :("}
{"text":"Love Pita Jungle!! Absolutely request Samantha..she is an amazing server!!"}
{"text":"Happy hour is a good time to go. Prices are good, bartender seemed kinda stoned which was fine.  Tapas sound soooo goood, and overall they ARE soo good. Just be warned the portions are teensie weenie on them. I also ordered the Gyro which came on a plate all by it's lonesome. I felt sorry that I was going to eat it without any extra accompaniments.  Everything tasted really amazing. It had nothing to do with the two $2 Stella's that I drank in record time (it was cold out come on!)  The tapas I ordered were:  3 Hummus - I would say it was A-ok Dolmas - 2 dolmas cut into 4 were very good Pita - A bit chewy and dry but still edible  The mother and daughter sitting at the bar bitching to one another about men ordered what looked to be far better than what I got... they got some sort of plate of hummus with meat on top (?) and some sort of mashed potato looking item.  They kept looking at me as if they wanted to share, but I was too busy chugging down my drinks and laughing at the stoned bartender.  I will go back for sure."}
{"text":"Let me first say \"I love Pita Jungle\". I love the food, atmosphere and the locations are convenient for me. They have an amazing happy hour too.   My last visit was not my normal experience with them. They were busy and there were about 10 of us however, the server was quite rude. There was one girl in our group that didn't eat because the server gave her attitude and she decided she didn't want anything that the server was going to bring her.    The server also refused to split checks for us even though we told her at the begining we were on seperate tabs. When the bill came most of us were paying with debit cards so it was a little nightmare.   Like I said earlier, I have always liked this place, but this visit was not a good one. I'll be back again and hopefully we will never get that same server again."}
{"text":"One of our favorite places. I can honestly say I have never had a bad meal here and both the servers and the managers are excellent. The forward is more than healthy and appears to be quite clean."}
{"text":"The atmosphere here was awesome! The drinks were awesome and the food was delish.  I had heard wonderful things about this place and it did not disappoint at all. In fact I am already planning my next trip here. Their menu is so extensive that it's going to take me a few trips to get through it all. But I'm up for the challenge. So if you have never been to Pita Jungle, put it on your bucket restaurant list. You'll thank me!"}
{"text":"What? Nothing with grease?   My wife and I drove by the Mesa Pita Jungle today and decided to stop by. This is not a place I would normally visit. I like meat, pizza and all of the other unhealthy things you can think of. But we were in the mood for Mediterranean food, and had little time to drive around.   Last time I was in Pita Jungle was back in the 1990's. So, for me, this was almost like my first visit, and for my wife it was really her first visit. I'm so glad we stopped here.   The focus here, of course, is on healthy Mediterranean cuisine.So, there are a few key items missing from the typical Mediterranean menu. But what Pita Jungle does it does very well indeed.   I had the chicken shawarma pita, the closest thing to my normal unhealthy diet I could find. My wife had the Mediterranean plate. We shared both.   Lots stood out here. The baba ganoush was, perhaps, the best I have ever had--certainly right up there. The falafel was also outstanding. My chicken shawama was also very, very good. Everything was good, but those three really stood out as superb.   Service was also outstanding. We were seated outside and not neglected in the least. Food was on the table in minutes. Just great.  I started to give Pita Jungle four stars because I don't want people to think I'm an easy grader. But the food was great, service was great, the atmosphere was even nice, though we were outside next to the parking lot. I have to go with five."}
{"text":"I can understand some of the reviews. Had lunch here today with my wife and in-laws. The worse service ever. We ordered appetizers and never got them.  We also waited 15 min for our refills. My wife loves the one in Tempe. This one can take some hints from it.  2-stars cause the food was at least good when we did get it!"}
{"text":"I always love visiting this Pita Jungle location. The food is always great, and the service is generally great. This location is pretty busy, so there have been some times when servers aren't as attentive - this is my only complaint. But, that won't keep me away. My food has always been served promptly and accurately."}
{"text":"Healthy food, delicious tea, but crowded on weekends  FOOD I am usually not a fan of hummus- but this was the first place I've gone and liked the hummus. It was delicious! Every dish around us that was brought out to other tables looked delicious. (I only ordered a pita and hummus) The menu had a great mix of lite meals and heavy entrees. Great if you need a snack or a full blown meal.  AMBIANCE The decor is unique- there are paintings (that are for sale) on the walls. The kitchen is open and you can view it from the dining area.  It's noisy and usually busy. There's not a lot of room when you enter the main door. If one or more parties are waiting you may need to step outside to have any room.   OTHER When I asked for an extra pita at the end of the meal I expected to a $2.00 + charge. They only charged us .30 for the pita :) It was great!  Try the Iced Tea- it's delicious too!"}
{"text":"Tastes fresh and delicious. Plus they have huge portions. It is a win win. I recommend their falafel sandwiches."}
{"text":"I have heard the Pita Jungle radio commercials for months now and have been wanting to try it. Today I finally did and it really was great. I went in during their lunch rush, OMG it was packed but the \"to go\" waiter was fast and knew exactly what to recommend.  I had the Mediterranean Roasted Chicken (Shawarma) it was really tasty. The price was not bad so I will definitely return. This is now one of my new favorite lunch spots."}
{"text":"The office I work for uses Pita Jungle for our staff lunches. We order from lots of locations and the hummus always seems to come packaged in this large flat platter. It sloshes and spills and makes a horrible mess every dang time.  I thought maybe you serve it like that so everyone at the table can dip... maybe you should ask if customers want the platter or a bowl when they order this much hummus?"}
{"text":"Well now. This the first time I've been to Pita Jungle and not have a server visit the table before we finished our meal to see if we needed anything or ask how the meal was or ask if we needed any thing else, etc. it prompted me to get writing. The food was good as usual but the service? Not what we're accustom to at the Pita Jungle. I usually have desert but I'll pass tonight. I try someplace else for that."}
{"text":"Great meal. See picture. Forgot to take a pick of the cheesecake. It got smashed as in in was very good and plated to please the eye. Anyway nice location and great food. Check it out! Peace."}
{"text":"Walls decked out in really cool photography, artsy and very friendly wait staff, healthful menu, low prices, large portions and fast service. We need one of these in Miami!  Loved the hummus platter. The plate was wiped completely clean after we were done with it, that's how good it was.  The falafel salad was great. I love the variety of vegetarian options. I chose the macro platter: brown rice, steamed veggies, sauteed tofu and baked beans. The baked beans were awesome but the rice and veggies were bland. A little liquid amino's would have gone a long way.  The only reason Pita Jungle doesn't get 5 stars is the fact they don't serve whole wheat pita bread. That should be a no brainer."}
{"text":"My biggest complaint about Pita Jungle is its name, which makes the place sound more like a fast-food Mediterranean joint like Extreme Pita than an upscale, healthy restaurant. In fact, even though I've worked nearby for over three months now and driven by countless times, I've avoided going there because I didn't know it was the kind of place it is. Of course, I know now, but I think the name was a poor choice for communicating what the restaurant's all about.   Anyway, that little naming issue aside, Pita Jungle is a great choice for a time when you'd like to have a sit-down lunch or dinner but pay reasonable prices that are more reflective of a faster dining option. Additionally, the portions are very large for the price. I went with a co-worker, and our two dishes and two sodas came out to less than $20 total. While none of the menu choices seemed mind-blowingly creative to me, my co-workers swears by the black bean burger and I thought my falafel pita was light and flavorful (and a steal at only $5.25!).   Now that I know that Pita Jungle is a restaurant serving fresh and healthy food, I have a feeling I'll be back pretty often."}
{"text":"As usual, the hummus was tasty.  Tried the artichoke pasta salad which was decent and perfect for a hot day in PHX."}
{"text":"HEALTHY, FRESH, DELICIOUS, & INEXPENSIVE Fresh hummus, fresh pitas, fresh chicken, fresh produce....literally I cannot say FRESH enough. I have been to this location probably at least if not more than 10 times and EVERY time the food is spot on. If I am in a rush, I inform the server and they get me in and out no problem (even if it is during a busy lunch rush). Very accommodating and I have never not one time had an issue here. The server usually always asks me if I want a to-go drink.   I think I maybe had ONE less than desirable experience and that was when the server was too busy flirting with the women at a table for 10minutes. I literally had to get up & say Hi, I need my check. Then he stood there and talked for 5 minutes more which irritated me to all hell. But it has not kept me form going back. If I got him again as a server, I would just ask to be sat at another section."}
{"text":"I'll fully admit that I am a regular of this Pita Jungle location. I come here an average of times a week. Usually I meet friends for their awesome Happy Hour and come on the weekend for dinner with my Husband or Family. The servers area always really attentive and helpful. They are great with substitutions and picky orders.    When at Happy Hour, I don't really drink the alcoholic beverages, but prefer their Decaf Berry Iced Tea which is delicious.   Happy Hour is CHEAP and served Tapas style (I believe it is from 3-5:30 and then Reverse from 9-close). For $6 I can get a full meal. I usually get an array of the following:  -Falafel with Tahni (This is always delicous, just the right seasoning and texture) -Hummus Trio (I love their Hummus, flavorful, smooth and just the right consistency. You get about two-three tablespoons per order) -Feta (They give you a block of feta cheese, drizzled with olive oil and topped with chopped cucumbers, onion and tomato, zataar as well. It's delicious) -Baba Ghanoush (REALLY nice and creamy. I don't love egglplant, but I love the subtle smokiness of this dip) -Pita with Thyme and Olive Oil (This is basically a small pizza with olive oil, thyme, tomatoes, feta and kalamata olives. It's perfectlly cooked and always yummy) -Olives (They would probably be a little bit better if they were heated, but they have a great variety). The dips are served with Pita and it is always the perfect consistency. Just soft enough but still with a little chew.  All of these items run $1 or $2. It's incredible. I'm a vegetarian, but I know that my friends enjoy the Chicken and Shrimp options. They also have a very fresh looking caprese tapa.  For dinners, I've tried a variety of Items, I really like the Mediterranean Platter but it's just too much food for me. I love their cold garlic and tomato green beans that come on this dish but you can also get them as a side dish.  I often get an order of Lentils and Rice, Feta Cheese, Small side of hummus, and 2 falafel balls (which come with their rich and awesome Tahini). I mix them all together and made a Mediterranean Burrito Bowl. It's awesome, and I always appreciate that the wait staff is accommodating.  Also, their Red Lentil soup is a notable starter. It's really perfectly balanced and flavorful.  My husband is easier than me. He enjoys the Chicken Tikka Masala or Chicken Shwarma. He also likes the Mediterranean Chicken Salad. We come with large groups and people always seem to enjoy their meals and order a variety of menu items.  They have a great patio which we enjoy sitting on for nice days/nights. For large groups- as far as I know they don't take reservation and sometimes there's a 30-40 minute wait for groups bigger than 4 on a Saturday night. We never really mind waiting though.  I love Pita Jungle."}
{"text":"So here's my deal. I eat at PJ once maybe twice a week. I go to this location and the one and Desert Ridge all the time. This one every time has runny humus and their tuna is always over cooked but they do fix it. Where the D ridge is always perfect and I mean always. I don't get it....same owners.....I know different cooks, but they need to get on the same page. Also portions are totally different at this location sometimes normal but most of the time smaller than the D Ridge location. Love the food but not consistent what so ever at this location. I now drive the extra couple miles for D Ridge location until this one figures it out."}
{"text":"Good Mediterranean style vegetarian menu. I am very pleased to have two such restaurants to choose from, and Pita Jungle is fantastic because it has a very well rounded vegetarian menu. Plenty of options for whatever you are craving."}
{"text":"Eight of my classmates and I (including our visiting Professor) came to eat here. Since our visiting professor is from the San Francisco (Ultimate Foodie City) we wanted to make sure we picked something delicious.   We were recommended to come here by 2 of our classmates and absolutely loved the dishes!  During happy hour we chose a couple tapas: falafel ($1), shrimp, scallops, cheese, hummus (DELISH), and a few things. Such a great price!  I shared the spicy chicken wrap and the chicken shawarma with a friend. It was sooo goood! Very flavorful (especially on my sick taste buds)."}
{"text":"I love how they recently changed the food court pita jungle to a fast casual \"chipotle style\" concept. In fact I like it more than the regular Pita Jungle. So many options and at a great price. It makes eating healthy tasty and affordable. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Been going to PJ for quite a number of years (usually Chandler/Dobson & Ray) ... so glad to have found this PJ today when I was shopping in this area.  Great ambiance - sat at the bar and the service was friendly ... food was great and warm out of the kitchen.  Grilled chicken with plain and cilantro/jalapeno hummus - and iced tea (always love the tropical tea at PJ).  I look forward to returning to this location when I'm on the north side of Phx.  5 stars!"}
{"text":"Oh Pita Jungle, how do I love there?   Today, I left a review for seasons 52 and true foods. In both of them I whined a little bit about how the food is so healthy that it leaves me feeling dissatisfied. Funny thing is, with Pita Jungle, I never feel that way.   Their food is healthy, but it is also immensely flavorful and well prepared. I have been coming to Pita jungle's for at least 15 years and I never get tired of the hummus, lentil fatoosh salad, veggie wrap, or chicken schwarma pita.    The environment is very casual but the food is amazing and I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I went to the Dana Park Pita and order the chicken wrap and chicken salad to go on 1/21/ at 1:20 p.m. The chicken tasted like fish and the lettuce in the salad was 95% brown all over the edges.  The pita wrap had brown lettuce also 30%.  I threw it away and called today for a refund.  It was so bad I didn't want to return.  In the past I have frequent tempe location and it has always been really fresh.  Such a shame that organic places can keep up appearances."}
{"text":"Yikes! Would you like a nice long hair embedded in your Seared Ahi Tuna Hummus plate?! We didn't either but that's what we got! The pita bread served with it was cold and stale! Yuck!   I must say the waiter was the reason my review got revived to two stars instead of one. He was very friendly, apologetic, and prompt to fix the errors. He didn't charge us for the hairy entree, whew! Thank goodness!  My partner ordered from there today at work and let me know that the pita bread was growing mold this time!   The dine-in experience is awfully tempting because of the beautiful lake view but the quality of their food is questionable, to say the least. I think I'll just opt for a homemade picnic by the lake instead of taking my chances again here!   Sorry!"}
{"text":"Love the food at this Pita Jungle. It's consistently good, every time!   It's strange how different locations vary in terms of quality.. I really don't care for the Pita Jungle closest to my house, for various reasons, but this one I will keep coming back for.   My favorite dish is the Lentil Fatoosh salad and it is very delicious! It's quite a hearty salad, piled high with lentils, rice, cucumbers, tomatoes, and caramelized onions (my fave!), and did I mention the fried pita bread on the side!? (It's really the best part of the salad, IMO!) It's the type of salad that leaves you full, but wanting more bites of it! Not many salads have that effect on me! ;)   Service is always really great too! I don't think I've ever had one bad experience here."}
{"text":"I'm from Tucson and recently discovered Pita Jungle after they opened a location there. I was visiting family in Tempe and was happy to discover there was a Pita Jungle close by.  I cannot visit PJ without ordering the Cilantro-Jalape√±o Hummus, either as an appetizer or, sometimes, as a meal. It never disappoints.  Their Kafta burger has always intrigued me, but PJ's food is supposed to be healthy, right? And burgers are not healthy, right? Yes, it's a burger, but it still felt semi-healthy as there was basically a salad inside the burger, which was dressed in a tasty, lemony vinaigrette. Alongside the burger were some of those heady garlic new potatoes.  My mom ordered the Gyro and I watched in amazement as my five foot nothing, whisper of a mom ate the whole humongous thing.  I am a big fan of Pita Jungle. It's an Arizona treasure."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a great Philly Chicken Pita.  Filed pita with chicken, bell peppers and onions topped with Swiss.  Plenty of parking, easy entrance into lot.  Very clean restaurant, local artist display their paintings.  Plea to of tables, some booths to enjoy lunch or dinner.  Glad I decided to have lunch, will be back again to enjoy something else next time, but this sandwich was outstanding."}
{"text":"Horrible service and inedible food came here Friday afternoon for a late lunch my server was same he took my drink order I ordered a Stella after that I never saw him again well after waiting15 min in a slow restaurant I had to go hunt him down he was on his cell phone when he brought me my drink I quickly ordered a tuna salad  the salad came out pretty quick but it was supposed to be warm it was ice cold and smelled of not good I flagged down Sam when I told him he gave me a weird look and returned with my bill by this point I gave up left a 20 which covered my bill and left I was going to be late for the movies  thank god for arbys near buy I was starving I used to love pita jungle but because of this experience I will never return"}
{"text":"I enjoy the juicy, succulent taste of murder, but I've also got friends that would skin me if I took them to a steak house. To avoid compromising the values of my veggie friends by forcing them to make me man meat, it's always best to choose a place with plenty of greens on the menu. Pita Jungle is the perfect harmony between flesh renders and herbivores. And it doesn't just have the \"hold the chicken\" type vegg friendly option on the menu, it's got lentils and shit.  Now, since we've already established that I live under rocks, you can just go ahead and assume I've never been to Pita Jungle. What can I say, the grub hunting was good. But after my first visit you can bet your skinny little vegan ass I'll be noshing right next to you on a regular basis.   The restaurant has apparently expanded twice since it's been open and it was still hoppin' last night, with an open, airy feel and interesting artwork decorating the walls. We hovered over the seating section booth thingy and were told to go ahead and steal any open seat we liked. Some may find this annoying and unorganized, but I really like it when they let me do that part of their job for them, so we snagged a table for two right next to the window so I could watch some dog TV, which was showing a tig old biddy sorority girl special based on the number of perky young freshman coming and going in the parking lot. (Side note: Big old windows are like big screen dog TVs because dogs don't watch human TV, they keep track of the cats trotting through their territory and bark at the mailman and monitor the comings and goings of the neighborhood through windows. At least in my experience. I'll be sitting there glued to the tube and the dogs will be sitting there glued to the window. End tangent. Thanks for your patience.)  Others have complained about the poor service at this location, but surprise (sarcasm) Mr. Man ends up knowing the waiter assigned to our section, so we were promptly rewarded with menus and drinks. Not that I would have even noticed the wait since I was agape, trying to take in everything offered on a menu that just wouldn't quit. Eventually I grabbed hold of my indecision and narrowed it down to three options, the black bean burger, the lavosh shawarma wrap, or the Caribbean salad. We agreed that not having hummus simply wasn't an option so I went with the shawarma so I could pep it up with some left over hummus, and I really dig lavosh because it reminds me of saltines, which I don't really like that much, but are scrumptious in flatbread form. Mr. Man decided upon the grilled vegetable salad, because if you've ever met him, he really needs to watch his boyish figure (again, sarcasm).  We ordered an extra pita for the hummus, which was overkill and we didn't even end up touching it because the \"small hummus\" ended up being freakin' huge and the pita was sized to match. It was smooth and creamy, and garnished with two of my favorite vegetables (or whatever an olive technically is), cucumbers and kalamata olives! My one gripe about the entire meal was that my chicken was overly dry and a smidgen bland, but the hummus more than made up for that lack in flavor. The side Greek salad that came with my wrap was also stupendous, with a hefty amount of feta and a delicious, light vinaigrette to counter that richness. Mr. Man's grilled vegetable salad was also very well done, with crisp veggies, lots of garlic and an awesome dressing.   And this delish bounty of fresh, healthy food came to 20 bucks between the two of us and left us with enough leftovers for lunch tomorrow. I'll definitely be coming here again, and frequently, so I can get my daily dose of granola crunching hippies, sorority sisters, cooler than thou hipsters and SUV driving yuppies with their childrens all in one place. Unheard of!"}
{"text":"I just don't see the greatness in Pita Jungle. Sure they have O.K. food. They aren't as cheap as I would price them based on their food(it isn't that good). The resturant is realtively unpleant because it smells funny, and it is awkwardly designed. It is quite vegetarian friendly however."}
{"text":"I'll be honest. I don't like this place at all. its not that good if you ask me. And not that cheap either. I know there are plenty who like this place, but I think one can do plenty better. When I went in the hosts/hostesses were occupying the entirety of the bar allowing only seating at the tables.  If you could manage to pull one of the twits out of the circle you can get waited on, depending on what your standards of waited on are."}
{"text":"Pita Jungle is always great!  I've been to 3 different locations in Phoenix and it is great across the board!  I am a huge fan of the gyro.  I know my friends love all the salads, even the men are a fan of the broiled chicken salad!    Happy hour is a nice treat for some cheap tapas... The staff is friendly, but the restaurant can get busy and sometimes there is a wait..."}
{"text":"Always a good experience with Pita Jungle no matter what location I go to. I was looking forward to visiting again to eat here after I moved away... everytime I come back to visit I enjoy a nice healthy meal here. Always 5 stars, thanks Pita Jungle:))"}
{"text":"When I don't feel like cooking I come here and taste a real homemade Mediterranean dish. Just like mom used to make!"}
{"text":"Went back to pita jungle and it was great. Thank you so much to Jacinda to restore the faith in excellent service. She made sure the food came out perfect, and it was exceptional. Many visits to pita jungle in my future :)"}
{"text":"Consistently good food and top notch service.  I love the vibe in this place and the local artwork featured.  I have been coming here for many years and have always enjoyed this place.  The servers are always friendly, upbeat and helpful with choosing menu items.  They offer so many different food options to appeal to all different tastes."}
{"text":"We loved this place until one day we ordered falafels and new garlic potatoes only to find out a piece of meat in the potatoes...Being a pure vegetarian it is just impossible for my wife to visit the place...Super disappointed"}
{"text":"Worst service ever! Don't waste your time at this location it sucks and the servers act like they are too cool and emo to serve with any sort of personality.. Food is always good but it's not even worth it , just go to a different location"}
{"text":"I was so disappointed with the changes to the menu at the Pita Jungle at the mall.  I can understand adding the option to build your own because people like that, but they made a huge mistake taking away all of the delicious menus items that they had before.  Usually the line is super long during weekday lunch hours, but yesterday it was not and I can certainly understand why.  I ended up getting a protein on my greek salad because basically I was going to get charged for it anyway, which was also not the case in the past.  Also the quality was not the same.  I literally got 4 olives on my salad and it was not good at all. Super bummed out!!!"}
{"text":"I think Pita Jungle has great food.  There are choices to satisfy just about any craving.  This location is pretty busy so try to go just when they open or during off hours.  I try to branch out and order new things but my favorite is actually an appetizer: the Hummus with Grilled Chicken.  There is more than enough here for a meal and you will probably end up taking some home.    Other favorites include the Blue Corn Nachos and Lavosh Pizza.  I can't comment on dessert because I never make it.  See above.  They also have a patio area overlooking a really sad \"lake\", but hey it's nice in December!  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Love Pita Jungle but this location is lacking. Customer service isn't great. Im always waiting for my to go order while the servers socialize. The quality of the food keeps going down each time we order. The chicken is usually dry. They never give us enough pita chips with our hummus. We order a large and always have SO much hummus left over. I constantly have to ask for more pita chips when we pick up our order and there's simply not enough. Not sure we will continue to spend money here. Close to the house for us but a big disappointment."}
{"text":"Yummy! Love the hummus and the gyros. Big portions. Flavorful and fresh. Being able to enjoy a beer or wine is always a good thing while eating at a restaurant."}
{"text":"A couple weeks ago, I came to this location on a \"first date\" type thing. I'm definitely going back. Although I didn't really eat, I tried some type of cilantro dip with pita bread, which is already an awesome combo. I ordered an alcoholic drink, and it was really good, I could tell they didn't dilute the alcohol at all either. My dates grub (chicken pita) looked soooo good as well, has saut√©ed mushrooms. BIG WIN all around from me. The only reason why I didn't put 5 stars was because the waitress was not very friendly with me at all. At first I thought it was just me being too sensitive, but my date quickly noticed her behavior towards me as well. We even joked that she might have a crush on him and doesn't like me, or maybe she's seen him there before with family and thought he had another girlfriend and that I was the side chick.. XD either way, it was still a nice place. Pretty fancy compared to what I originally thought it was. Probably don't want to take your kids here if they are kind of rowdy. I know I won't be taking my son here til he's older."}
{"text":"The Mediterranean Chicken Salad is to die for...no, really I almost ran over someone to get to Pita Jungle.   Just jokin'...the salad is great though!!! :)"}
{"text":"food was OK, service was sub par  not super GF friendly, for those it matters"}
{"text":"This was a unique place, as we don't have such a diverse hummus place in the Bay Area in California. Loved the difference varieties, and the chicken and salmon were amazing! Ambiance is casual, wait staff is friendly enough. Seating could be better, as the tables were too small to accommodate appetizers plus meals and drinks."}
{"text":"I quite like Pita Jungle and have been to three of their locations. The downtown location is not only a welcome addition to the neighborhood, but it's also their most beautiful and usable restaurant. The space is very large and features a full bar and a patio. This is something I was aggravated by at the Tempe location is they have no bar, and the Indian School location has no patio. They also did a teriffic job of keeping the integrity of the old Gold Spot Market that they are located inside.   The service here is impeccible just as normal with Pita Jungle. Friendly servers, cute waitresses, prompt delivery from the kitchen, and efficient seating. The food is high quality, tasty, and inexpensive. The black bean burger is probably my favorite dish here. A beautiful balance of spicy, smokey, and salty.   Pita Jungle yum."}
{"text":"This was my first time to eat at Pita Jungle and not my last time.  I had thought it was a fast-food place and was surprised to find it's a sit-down restaurant.  The food was very good.  I ordered the chicken that comes on a bed of mashed potatoes and spinach.  My wife had a gyro.  Both very good.  The service was also very good."}
{"text":"This place serves two of my favorite things, the pesto lavosh turkey wrap and jalapeno cilantro hummus. I can't remember the last time I ordered anything else. I've never experienced bad service, but I tend to go at off times....much less these days now that Stinkweeds has moved, since that used to be half the allure of eating at Pita.   The food is reliable, I like their beer and wine selection so that gets three stars, and it gets one more because you can take your dog if you sit outside. The only downside is that they can't serve alcohol if you're seated out there."}
{"text":"The food is almost always outstanding!  Very few of the items on the menu can you go wrong with.  Although, if you don't like onions, like me, then be wary of some dishes and make sure you order with no onions.  The service is the only thing lacking at our most regular haunt."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this restaurant for quite a long time. Normally I eat in house. Just grabbed a Pita cheesesteak that was a quarter of the size that they normally serve. Make sure you check your food on take out.  Feeling ripped off. Do not order late night."}
{"text":"Ah, trusty ol' Pita Jungle. I've been here on several dates and with friends and with my dog. At all times I felt like the place had a little hipster vibe. I love the fact that they seemed to be dog-tolerant. I don't dare say dog friendly, as I've hardly seen that in Phoenix, but dog tolerant is enough to impress me in this city. Thanks for always providing a good experience, PJ."}
{"text":"Great food. Had chicken hummus appetizer and the quesadilla and added chicken. Both were delicious. Service was prompt and very nice. Even saw the server right a forgotten order by comping and making it for them to go. Good business"}
{"text":"My favorite!! This place is great. Awesome healthy food, well priced, along with a great staff. What more could a girl want?"}
{"text":"Just had an amazing experience at Pita Jungle. First time here. Wife is vegetarian I am not. Was able to find things on the menu that both of us liked. Best part was their system was down and so they could not issue checks or take payment so the meal was free. Highly impressed that they continue to stay open and serve free meals instead of closing their doors when their system was down. Service was excellent!"}
{"text":"I was so happy no longer needing to drive to Tempe for the great food here! The hummus is amazing...which one you ask well all of it. Try the sampler plate trust me its amazing."}
{"text":"Same tasty food, but SO much less pretentious than the Arcadia Pita Jungle.  This location seems to be staffed by happy, young hipsters that do not ooze judgement when you order a dish containing meat or when they see you roll up in anything but a Prius.  Even at this welcoming location, there are still some things that make things less-than-perfect.  I love Pita Jungle's hummus but always have to order extra pita to go with it (really, just one measly piece?).  I'm guessing that's the case for most people, unless they're eating the remaining hummus with a spoon.  Why so stingy?  After all, \"pita\" is in your name, shouldn't it be a'plenty?  Another thing that vexes me is that they haven't jumped on the glass bottle, cane sugar soda train.  If they have a fountain, there must be call for soda in general, so why not align it with the rest of your menu and make it a little more natural (or as natural as soda can get)?"}
{"text":"Service is quick, food is good. Price is low. Similar to going to a Panda Express for chinese. They do have a Bar. Restaurant in semi-industrial business complex. Noisy on inside. Nothing great here, but nothing bad. Fine for an inexpensive date night."}
{"text":"Wow, haven't been here in a while and I know why. We were a table of 3. Waitress didn't greet, smile or talk, except to ask what was wanted for drinks. She brought those quickly. Then we asked for an order of dolmades , and she immediately took off and put them in the computer before we could order the remaining appetizers (in a rush maybe?) Appetizers arrived fast. About 8 mins later another couple was seated, we waited and waited to place our food order. I observed her go back to the table with the couple,  take their order and not come back to us. I stopped another employee and placed my order with him. She finally came back around and by that time I was already irritated. I observed other wait staff interacting with their customers, talking, and even smiling...this experience was terrible. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Even though this place is a vegetarian's dream palace with many, many delicious options to choose from, I cannot give it the five stars I want to. Every time I go, which is often, I enjoy 80 percent of my meal. Especially, the cilantro-jalapeno hummus, which I just can't get enough of., and the mixed beans - in or out of a pita. This location is pleasant, too - on a faux-lake and not too crammed like the Tempe location. All that being said - there is WAY too much onion action in most of the dishes I've tried. Big chunks of breath-saturating onion. Most of the time, I can navigate around them, but sometimes I can't. Thus, four stars instead of five."}
{"text":"Not that they even need another 5 start review, this place is great!!!  Great place to take your kids for a healthy meal!"}
{"text":"Great spot. Very allergy friendly and our server had great recommendations! Only downside is it's pretty crammed and loud but I think thats only because it's so popular!"}
{"text":"Everyone who's lived in the Valley knows Pita Jungle is good, fresh food.  The Gilbert location is large and open with great atmosphere.    The food is the same as other locations with an emphasis on healthy and fresh.  I recommend the jalapeno cilantro hummus, the chicken lavosh pizza and anything with the falafel in it.  The broiled chicken salad is also tasty and light.  I think the drinks are overpriced and the wait staff seems indifferent.  The wait staff dresses like they are competing for the strangest emo outfit."}
{"text":"About as good as a mall food court is going to get. Almost as good as a stand alone Pita Jungle location. Great Gyro's and Hummus. Plus, really fast service."}
{"text":"I've always loved Pita Jungle. I was so excited to discover they opened a new one by me in front of Arrowhead Towne Center (even though I still have not been there yet...) We always start with the cilantro and jalapeno hummus. Just a tip: the small is a big serving. Usually perfect for 3-4 people. Just order extra pita or veggies. I have loved everything I ever tried there. This time I had the Seafood Provencal. It was so good I wanted to lick the bowl clean. I've tried many things here and it seems Pita Jungle can do no wrong. This needs to become a new staple for me."}
{"text":"Please see the captions for my pics!  This place is great for a light lunch, early dinner, or even snacks!   Freshly prepared, high quality food that was served with a smile by Ellie.  Hubby and I stopped here for a light lunch and were pleasantly surprised.  Too many wonderful choices for our first visit.  Prices seemed reasonable for the portion sizes and quality.  Will have to come back again to try some of our Mediterranean favorites- like the gyros and wraps."}
{"text":"I have tried the other one on shea, but this is close to home and work. I love the enviornment, the clientle, the healthy food, outstanding service and very reasonable prices. The waitstaff is great, the food always comes out quick and tastes amazing. Get anything with chicken as it is delicious and if you like hummus try it here. Also, they have great ice tea. This place is one of my favorites and well worth a try."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite spots in Scottsdale. It is quick and easy in a comfortable environment . I almost always get the hummus trio with chicken and some pita bread on the side. The chicken is seasoned perfectly ever time. If you love hummus and chicken this is the place for you as it is in almost every dish. They also have vegetarian options and make awesome fresh lemonade."}
{"text":"Always a great change from the typical sandwich. Thing is, there are so many other things that I could eat here. Went with my girlfriend who had the Mahi Mahi. Looked like a meal you would get at a high end restaurant. My fav: the Jalapeno Cilantro Hummus. So good! I could eat tubs of this stuff. Oh wait, I did!  Always leave this place stuffed, but never have that \"I can't believe I just ate that\" feeling. Okay, I will confess I had a Bosa Donut on the way home. Hey, It's 113 out what else do you do in Phoenix."}
{"text":"How can healthy taste so good.  We stopped here for lunch last week and thoroughly enjoyed it.  Granted the acoustics are not good - it's hard to hear yourself read the menu, but, the food more than made up for it, plus our waitress was fantastic -knowledgeable, friendly, happy - I'd love to have her again.    It may be unusual to start with the ice tea, but that was some of the best ice tea I've ever had.  It was a big glass and I was happy to get a refill.  I ordered the Lavosh Shawarma Wrap which was yummy.  Grilled chicken, tomato, and onion in a light garlic sauce wrapped in Lavosh Bread and then wood fired made for a great sandwich.  The chicken was moist and seasoned to a t and the veggies were grilled to just the right degree - not mushy and not too firm.  This was a huge portion in itself but came with a greek salad which was also good good.    I do have to mention that I went back here a few days ago and while I still thought the food was amazing, this is not the place to go if you have a group that you want to converse with.  The acoustics are bad and it was really hard to do all that lip reading.  Will I go back?  You bettcha!"}
{"text":"Why do amazing restaurants like this only exist on the left coast?!? Visiting my parents from the Midwest and was blown away by this great fast casual restaurant. Had the ahi tuna appetizer with the cilantro jalape√±o hummus. Amazing. My son and mom had chicken pitas and raved. The only mediocre item was the side of rice and beans which was just eh. Still can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Food is great, as is the service. I love their black bean open pita. The Philly cheese steak pita sandwich is pretty damn good, too. They had a vegetarian chili that was awesome. From speaking to the servers, they discontinued it which is disappointing."}
{"text":"Great food, location and staff. My favorite item here would have to be the mixed bean pita. It's a vegetarian dish as it has no meat. The pita sandwiches are great, too."}
{"text":"Let me first start by saying, I am hyper critical of PJ as I am a former server/assistant manager from another location. So, having been through corporate training and knowing the ins and outs of the restaurant concept makes me hard to please. This location is close to my office and my co-workers and I have lunch here a couple times a month. It's always a pleasant experience at this location - from servers to management, they do it right here. Today, we picked up our lunch. The to-go server, Chris took my order over the phone and was very professional and pleasant. When we arrived to pick up our order and asked for checks to be split, he was very accommodating. I know how hard it can be at the to-go station during a busy lunch and he handled it with ease. He was also our server the last time we sat in the restaurant, and I can say that even on the floor he shines as an all-star server. Usually you are sick of the food once you work in a restaurant, but I will never grow tired of Pita and look forward to many more great experiences at this and the other locations. Thank you, Chris and the Pita Jungle - Uptown crew...lunch was fantastic, see you soon!"}
{"text":"Came to eat after the movies with the kiddos and my fiance waited for 15 minutes and still no service.  Waiters walked by us and served people after us. Told the manager my frustrations he offered a gift card but at this point the damage was done."}
{"text":"This was my first trip to a Pita Jungle . . . and though I had heard great things . . . I was not really impressed.  The restaurant was about half full and it still took about 10 minutes for our server to stop and get our order . . . I guess four businessmen just weren't as good looking as the four ladies next to us in there heels and skirts . . . it was a nice view though, I will have to omit.  I was expecting much more from the food . . . especially when it took another 15 minutes to arrive.  I ordered the Gyro Pita . . . it was suppose to be warm . . . the Pita it self was hot and soft . . . the lamb was cold and leathery.  Will I give Pita Jungle another try . . . probably some day . . . but it definitely will not be my first choice."}
{"text":"You gotta try the glazed chicken pizza with caramelized onions and feta cheese on lavosh bread - it's so tasty as is the grilled chicken houmus.   The live music is an added bonus.  You can get the wrong impression of this place if you hit a bad night but I would say in general this place is a definite winner!  If you're hungry, and don't want to spend a lot of money, this fills the bill."}
{"text":"I love Pita Jungle and have catered several large events at my home in the past. It's always been reasonably priced, healthy, and well received. Sadly I had a terrible experience at the Arcadia location last night. I ordered food from pita jungle for my 10 person book club, and have never been more disappointed. I requested the price for the food I was ordering on the phone and the employee simply said that it would take too long to retrieve that information so I went with it and figured it wouldn't be an absurd amount. I picked up my half order of Greek salad, half order of tzatziki sauce, and the makings for 10 chicken pitas. I was charged almost $180, $43, YES DOLLARS for the salad, $38 for the tzatziki sauce, and $79.00 for the pitas.  Thankfully they refunded the salad & sauce when I asked them to take it back, but when I got home with the chicken, the topping were very sad. The onions were limp and the tomatoes were obviously old and not okay to serve. They were completely mushy.  In a friendly way, I called to let the manager know, so things could be addressed and sadly he was non empathetic and rushed me off the phone. I am very disappointed with my service and how I was treated, and will not be coming back anytime soon."}
{"text":"The hummus was amazing! Our server Jen was very professional and fulfilled all of our needs. Quick service, great food and great people. I will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"I ordered the spicy chicken wrap because when I saw a photo posted on this yelp page (it's been removed) it looked appetizing. It was picked up with a bunch of orders placed with coworkers in my office. What I got instead was this open-faced pita that clearly was not wrapped. There was also a swirl of sriracha sauce on top of the aluminum foil it was wrapped in which wasn't wrapped nicely either. I called and was explained that the kitchen \"makes it that way\" because it's \"big\". I get it, but they decorate aluminum foil with sriracha sauce, really? I asked for the manager but they had to call me back because they were busy. They waited so long I couldn't answer anyway since I was off of my lunch hour. Thank goodness I was starving since I had no time to return this ugly mess they call a \"wrap\". Here are a few photos from what they advertise on their menu online vs. What I was given. This was a disservice to pita jungle and I wasn't happy at all with either my food or the person who answered the phone that tried explaining that slop."}
{"text":"I had a disappointing dinner at this location.Cobb Salad had dry chicken and lacked freshness  in addition and  especially concerning besides my food order was the behavior of a young lady working the bar. She constantly had her cell phone in hand at all times and even delayed service to her customers while she took and made  personal calls. Very unprofessional and found it unbelieveable that the management allowed it. I and my wife were there on a Thursday for an early dinner between 4:30-5:30pm. The dining area did not protect you from the blinding Sun since there were no shades. We had to move to another table in the corner of restaurant."}
{"text":"My review for THIS Pita Jungle was in error. It was meant for the Pita Jungle on 50th St.. in Ahwatukee. I apologize to this Pita Jungle location. PLEASE ignore my comments since it applies to the Pita Jungle on 50th st in Ahwatukee."}
{"text":"This location has disappointed me yet again... I ordered a large hummus with 3 wheat pitas to go. I barely got any hummus, it looks like they took a small hummus and put it in a large container, I didn't get the extra pita I paid for and the pitas I did get were white not wheat and ice cold. What a rip off! I definitely won't be back to this location again."}
{"text":"just returned from the Jungle.  Solid as always.  Busy too.    Today I started with a cup of the Turkish Lentil soup.  It was OK.  A bit bland, but hey, it is lentil soup.  The main dish was the cilantro and jalapeno hummus with Taboule salad.  The hummus was great, and the Taboule salad was soooo much better than what I got a Sprouts last week.  The only real knock was how long my food took.  It had to have been about 15 minutes to get the main dish.  The people next to me seemed to get theirs in about 5.  But, it was worth waiting for and Cristina the server was very nice.  I'll see you soon Pita Jungle."}
{"text":"Two words are all that is needed: garlic dip. I have my friend Alice to thank for turning me onto this amazing treat. I tried it with a bit of skepticism because of the explanation that it was mashed potatoes.  In fact, I am one that usually reads every word on the menu description but in this case I just took her word for it because I wanted to try it with an open mind. Anyway, skepticism and hesitancy, be gone! I have never really been that partial to PJ but I will be returning over and over again just for the dip. In fact I'm working really hard at home today and if I complete my projects, guess where I am headed...you got it! As far as PJ itself, I can't really give a fair review because I was so enamored with the dip!  I vaguely recall average service. I had the large greek salad with gyro meat and a pita which brought that to well over 10 bucks....will have to ponder that next time however I did get two meals out of that serving.   Again, two words: garlic dip."}
{"text":"I usually LOVE coming here.... *Suggestion* trust NO ONE lol.... If you're getting takeout, check your order before you leave. Nothing worse than driving 30 minutes one direction to find out you got a box of rotini pasta with lemon sauce... NOT what I ordered- at all. I threw in a more than generous tip BEFORE my food was even prepared, please treat people well who treat you well..."}
{"text":"Great food and healthy for you. I had the kale salad special with red quinoa, hummus, and I added chicken. Wow, what a great lunch. I will be back"}
{"text":"Wine Wednesday's are where it's at! Went here with my mom right before I had to get my wisdom tooth out, haha! They weren't going to give me any pain medication so when I saw bottles of wine are all half priced on Wednesday's I figured wine could be a substitution for the pain killers. Had the soup, super yummy and I like that you can order proteins sides like a filet of salmon or a chicken breast. The only negative was that the table was not wiped off properly and it was sticky in some spots. Get nicer tables and chairs for the patio as well!"}
{"text":"Didn't try food here (only eaten at Tempe location) but the service at the door was so bad.  I stood there in an empty restaurant while the too cool to be bothered chatted among themselves instead of doing their job. When the hostess/server finally approached she demonstrated her lack of clairvoyance by asking me if I was there to pick up an order.  Apparently someone eating alone must be getting take out. After informing her I was there to eat food at a table she took me to a table with an attitude.  Seriously people, grow up!  You'r not impressive to anyone but yourselves and that's a very very tiny universe you live in."}
{"text":"Enjoy this place everytime. Food is great, especially the humus. Service is pretty promt and the atmosphere great. Price is decent compared to their quality."}
{"text":"They're food is always great! I order out mostly and they never forget any detail wether it's an extra sauce or don't use a certain ingredient there is never a mistake with my order. Food is always delicious and service is great!"}
{"text":"I've been a loyal customer for over  8 +years!    They always have great customer service and the amazing food!"}
{"text":"Wonderful food..Fantastic customer service..Gorgeous staff..  Consistent consistent consistent"}
{"text":"I enjoy Pita Jungle menu but the decour at  this site is too 'industrial' making it noisy and uncomfortable. To make matters worse, they play terrible music and the sound system is horrible. The staff yell and through plates around without regard for dinners. Too bad."}
{"text":"Love the food here but service is really lacking. Waited 10min to pay for my takeout order because the bar waitress (who handles the take out orders) was working (very hard) to fill drink orders, answer the phone, and help customers at the bar, all while multiple service staffers and what appeared to be management stood around chatting (the restaurant was 1/4 full at the time). Unacceptable."}
{"text":"We have been to Pita Jungle probably 10 - 15 times since we moved to Phoenix. We have even tried a couple of other locations and the Roosevelt spot is defiantly the best. First of all, we love the patio. It really is a great place to chill on a weekend afternoon. Our favorites include the hummus, the gyro (they put a pickle in it!), salads and the Sharwarma wrap. We visited on New Years Day for lunch and it was great as usually. We tried the Lentil Soup (for good luck), and it definitely impressed.   If I was going to give Pita Jungle a knock, I would bring up the service. The servers all seem like college kids and don't seem very experienced. When they get busy, the service usually starts to fall apart. We have had a few mediocre experiences here, but for the most part it has been great.  I definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"What on earth happened to this place. Besides the welcoming hostess it was a terrible time. Our server looked ready to quit on the spot. Didn't check on us and even surrounding tables had to ask other servers to bring their check. The hummus tasted and looked literally watered down. No flavor and the same said for my chicken pita. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"I am so disappointed. I never have any problems with this location as far as service and the quality of my food, but today, my experience was less than stellar. I usually order the lentil fatoosh salad, but today I decided to order the wood fired salmon, and boy was that a mistake. First of all, my food took forever to come, I waited 40 minutes. Once my food arrived, my salmon was not well done as requested, and the portion size was super small considering the price of $15.99. It was literally maybe 2 big tablespoons of mashed potatoes and a sprinkle of spinach. The food was Uber bland, and it wasn't made with love. Whoever is cooking in the kitchen must really hate their job because it shows in the food.  The server \"tried\" to fix the situation by bringing us a complementary desert and she brought us baklava after I cleared mentioned a gluten sensitivity at the beginning of our order. What in the world?!! She was kind enough to give us $10 off the next meal. I am so disappointed and I won't be back. Ever."}
{"text":"Omg there happy hour is amazing. I ordered the shrimp, a beef slider and tomatoes with mozzarella and balsamic vinegar all were very tasty.  I was very sad they they no longer have the mussels or scallops. I also ordered the Philly cheese steak Gyros with gluten-free pita. It was really good."}
{"text":"I've eaten here numerous times with coworkers and I'm very disappointed in the food we got. My coworker and I ordered the chicken and hummus and when we returned back to the office, we were very upset to find there was hardly any hummus, it looked like someone scooped and slatted a small amount of hummus, and forgot the pine nuts, tomato and our chicken was cold. I wish I could rely on them for a quick healthy lunch but I will not be returning for the price and quality of food rendered."}
{"text":"My office placed a big order for our staff meeting. I personally ordered red quinoa with jalapeno hummus with mahi. They forgot my mahi. I do not understand how you forget to put a whole piece of fish on an entree that's the main part of it. I was extremely dissatisfied. Luckily one of my co-workers ordered your wrap and was kind enough to share one of the half with me. A few people ordered the he does and they all enjoyed those. There was also a few pizzas and those were phenomenal as well."}
{"text":"I have been four times and I will not stop.  I have been to three locations and they all rocked.  I'm gonna paste this same review to all three.  These are clean restaurants with fun menus.  You can eat healthy.  They serve vegetables and fruit.  They plate well.  The food is attractive.  I have tried 8 menu items and they were all fantastic.  Good signs."}

{"text":"I'm so mad. I pride myself on being a vegan and being committed to a plant based diet for so many years and every now and then after a day of shopping my mom and I would go in for a late lunch. The staff always reassured me that the portobello burger was vegan. My mom and I went tonight and I just happened to browse on the Pita Jungle website on my phone and looks like the portobello burger is NOT vegan b/c the bun has dairy. When our waitress approached us to take our order (who BTW was not friendly) I asked her if the portobello burger was vegan and she said that is was, when I told her on their website that it said it wasn't she went to check the ingredients on the bun and comes back to tell me that it's not vegan. The staff obviously needs education!!!! I cannot believe I have been eating something that is against my beliefs all this time due to lack of knowledge of the Pita Jungle staff. The waitress then tells me that I can always substitute my bun for a 12 grain bread BUT according to their website the 12 grain bread isn't vegan either. Such a shame! I am so, so, SO disappointed!!!!!!"}
{"text":"A while ago I had a bad experience w/ Pita Jungle at Arrowhead and after that experience I decided to lay off of Pita Jungle for a while until I discovered the downtown location. I figured, a new location for me will do. Today was my third time visiting with my girlfriends and I ordered my usual, a falafel wrap. Three bites into it, it was good, as usual. Before I can continue eating, I removed the foil wrap and there was piece of chicken on the side of my pita bread. I totally lost my appetite since I haven't had meat in 10+ years. I made the waitress aware and she offered to bring out another one. I had already lost my appetite so I did not want it. She brought out the bill to me and said that the manager wouldn't charge me for my meal, well, I hope not since I didn't get to eat it. I was paying for my friends because we were celebrating a birthday so when I paid I informed the waitress that there should be a bigger discount because it's not just about me loosing my appetite it's about the fact that I sat there while my friends ate and at one point they didn't feel comfortable either and felt bad. She informed me she would ask her manager. She came back, dropped off my copy of the receipt, and walked away. Not saying anything at all. I opened the bill and the manager didn't take any additional discount or anything. What a shame. This is the second bad experience and after this I DEFINITELY won't be giving Pita Jungle a THIRD try!"}
{"text":"Chicken Pasta Salad with extra chicken and extra dressing please! Can not forget the Jalapeno Cilantro Hummas on the side! That's usually lunch for two days or something me and my partner share with a glass of white wine. Every now and then I'll alternate with the Spinach Pasta Salad and just add the grilled chicken. Mmm...  Try the Spanakopita!! Everything on the menu is lovely and the cheese they use just makes everything mouth watering.   Please never go away!"}
{"text":"I had not realized that my new friend was vegetarian, so I had to scramble to find a good place to bring a vegetarian.  Yelp to the rescue!  Pita Jungle was a great choice. Hummus sampler was totally tasty, but you really do need extra pitas. Our waitress, Dominica, was great. Upbeat and attentive without being invasive, her smile made us feel welcome. We were slow to choose from the menu, being first timers and being as interested in chatting as we were in eating, but Dominica was patient with us, and was quick to point out popular options and personal favorites. My glass never really went empty (yay) and the black tea with juuuust a splash of lemonade was perfect.  My dining companion had the black bean burger which was tasty, but didn't hold together very well and smooshed over the sides of the bun, making it messier than it originally appeared.  I had the Lavosh Shawarma Wrap which I read good things about, and it didn't disappoint. Boxes were necessary for leftovers, but were brought quickly for us.  Great experience and I plan on going back for more! Thanks Dominica!"}
{"text":"Went to lunch here with a few friends who want to eat healthy.  I found it weird that this place allows its employees to look like customers, where you are not sure who works there or not until they come to your table and wait on you.  Their pita & hummus are what they're known for so that is excellent.  Their food portions are a good size for two meals which of course are tasty."}
{"text":"Had the delicious, grilled vegetable salad for lunch today (added chicken). This location is consistently good. If you're there for happy hour, try the purple haze beer... you won't regret it! ****4 Stars."}
{"text":"Walked in to the sight of the hostess and all the wait staff texting on their phones. Bartender said we could seat ourselves. Waited for about 15 minutes- didn't even get waters. There was more staff on hand than patrons, so there was no reason for any kind of wait. Poor service, total lack of professionalism... Went to the Mexican grill next door and had drinks in less than 3 minutes. I suggest going there instead!"}
{"text":"Have you ever experienced above and beyond (and completely unexpected) service? That's what we experienced at Pita Jungle on Sunday. Hillary our waitress was probably the most knowledgeable waitress I have ever, EVER been served by. This girl knew the ENTIRE menu top to bottom.   We ordered drinks- she had a better suggestion (\"do you like IPAs? let me give you a sample of something local we just got in\").   We ordered the mussels- she mentioned the shrimp and the scallops as her favorites.   Hillary guided us through a wonderful and unexpected dining experience.   We will be back just to sit in her section!"}
{"text":"Every time I eat here, I have the Mediterranean Chicken Salad. The lemon vinaigrette is amazing! I can't get enough of this salad. I tried to re-create it at home, but it just wasn't the same.  If I'm feeling extra hungry, I'll order the cilantro jalapeno hummus and pita, which I also cannot seem to recreate.  I have never had better hummus. I don't have to feel guilty after eating at Pita Jungle because they serve tasty healthy food that I actually want to eat."}
{"text":"I have visited all of the east valley locations of Pita Jungle in my many years here in Tempe. I am super impressed with the management of this location. The staff is super friendly (which is typical of all the locations), they look hip (of course) but the best part is they are on top of it! I have not had to wait long here. There always seems to be enough employees, even when it is super busy.  The actual restaurant is artful and visually pleasing, full of fun and whimsy. The bikes on the ceiling are fun and the colorful wall above the kitchen are my favorites. There is a lot of room which is helpful since I have small children.   I enjoy the menu, which is consistent with all locations. The hummus cannot be beat anywhere. It truly is the best available I have ever had.  The kids meals are so nice. I love the options for the kiddos. It helps kids feel like they have a say in what they eat but all of the options are healthful. I don't have to lie and omit options from their choices. It's great! The most touching thing about this location is the management went above and beyond to consider the families with kids and had a small basket of toys the kids could pick from with their meal. It actually was a \"happy meal\" for all. Just such a treat.   Thank you for providing a wonderful dining experience!"}
{"text":"This is one of my local and regular go to's for lunch! I get takeout for lunch approximately one time per week however in the last month or two I've had some rather disappointing experiences. The last two times I ordered chicken with my dish it was dry, over cooked,  and thin/flat. The same is said for when I recently ordered the woodfired salmon. It tasted dry and overcooked not fresh and nothing like the quality of my favorite Greek restaurant just up the road. The last time I ordered the lentil fetoosh salad to go, I got home to find that those delicious seasoned triangular shape pita wedges were missing.  The following week when I ordered to go again I asked over the phone if I could get those delicious chips as a side since they were omitted from my order the previous week. Sadly I did not learn my lesson and check my order before I left. I  got home to find just a bunch of dry bland and unseasoned pita chips in a takeout container. Me thinks something is slipping in quality as of late."}
{"text":"Very modern and hip. Service is awesome and food is really yummy. Best bell pepper hummus I've ever had by far. Different off the beaten path."}
{"text":"Amazing food, amazing atmosphere, and usually good service.  I have been to three different locations and they all are great.  I would definitely recommend going in.  All of the meals are delicious.  The Jalapeno and Cilantro Hummus and the Mediterranean Chicken Salad are favorites!"}
{"text":"Food was fresh and delivery was prompt delivery. We were not totally impressed with the flavors by not being as savory as we like. We probably won't order again but this decision is based on our taste not the quality of their food."}
{"text":"While I loooooove Greek food, I have to say the few times I've been to this Pita Jungle recently, I wasn't impressed.  A few weeks ago I ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala, usually a full-bodied flavorful meal and it was downright bland!  I came back a week later and ordered the falafel wraps only to find out they gave me one tomato slice (the tiny end piece) and what could be called a \"drop\" of sauce.  Again....bland!   Not to mention the service was slow.  My mom had to get up twice to remind them of our drink order.  While I know that Pita Jungle has a great reputation and while I will say I have had good food there in the past....recent developments are leading me to believe the contrary."}
{"text":"I want to thank Joe for going above and beyond today! I have celiac disease and he made absolutely sure everything I ordered was prepared correctly. I love great customer service and he definitely deserves a mention! Thanks again!!!"}
{"text":"Had an incredible meal last night with some friends who were from out of town and wanted to take them to our local hang out.    We used to head up to Scottsdale & Shea but recently moved closer to the Arcadia area and boy were we surprised to be welcomed by some familiar faces from the old store. Kelly the GM has always been gracious and Elizabeth took wonderful care of us.    The food at this location has always seemed incredibly consistent and flavorful. We began with the trio hummus (sub the Greek pitas) and add fresh cut cucumbers followed by the spicy mango shrimp, chicken pasta salad with added feta, lentil fetoosh with grilled salmon and the lavosh shawarma wrap.    People were giving the new teas a bad wrap via Yelp (or from what I've read) but I liked them and so did our friends.    Thank you again Kelly and Elizabeth for always caring, you truly add to the experience. See Arcadia soon.   PS our Omaha friends say head out east :)"}
{"text":"Recently took a group of 34 female collegiate athletes to the Tempe area to do a winter camp.    The team has gone to the same place in Arizona for the past 5 or 6 years, and always get a catering order of Pita Jungle for at least one or two of their dinners.  We did the same thing this year and copied last years order.  The salads, lentils salad, hummus, and fruit were fantastic. The team would finish each tray, often scraping the bottom.    We were a little disappointed with a few of the pitas we ordered, some commented that they had been better the year before and were a little soggy.  I'm sure that was the result of timing the pick up of the order.  Overall, we were please with the service, food quality and options.  We also loved that the entire order was reasonably priced.  We plan to return again next year."}
{"text":"Nothing but good things to say about this location. Placed an order for about 10 lunches via email. Had a strict time schedule to stick to and Pita Jungle was happy to accommodate.   Only minor drawback was my original email ended up in their spam folder. I would recommend calling in to verify the order was received to anyone doing orders via email.   I will definitely order here again!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Pita Jungle. The waiter was great very attentive. Cool neighborhood. The chicken chipotle pizza was extraordinary! One bite and I said yum! Out loud! I highly recommend"}
{"text":"I'm a regular at this food shop, It seems every time we go we just want to keep coming back, the food is fresh, delicious, the place is clean, staff is friendly, and service good, and they fill your wine glass to the brim to boot!"}
{"text":"The food is good, I get the gyro pita every time. The only knock is for the difficulty finding parking, especially during lunchtime."}
{"text":"I stopped into Pita Jungle on a Sunday afternoon to grab a gyro to go for my drive back to San Diego.  The gyro isn't what I would call \"authentic\"...the flavor seemed off a bit, but I did like that they grilled the pita bread so it was a little crispy.    The inside of Pita Jungle is very unique...very hip and very un-Greek.  Most everyone working was white including the amazingly cute blonde hostess at the front.  Wow.  Five stars...but deduct one for the lack of fries.  I tried the garlic potatoes and though they were okay I'd rather have fries or wedges.  I'd come back for sure for the well, scenery, and maybe even some food."}
{"text":"I love this place. I could do without all the hipster servers, sometimes I don't even know who works there and who's just a customer. I love the space and the food is always consistently tasty and fresh. This pita jungle I think is the best scenery than any others around, love the art, huge eclectic mirror and outdoor patio. I only wish they delivered. You won't be disappointed if you like fresh and healthy choices. I highly recommend the macro platter, jalapeno hummus, Mediterranean salad and the ahi tuna in hummus."}
{"text":"This Pita Jungle has Amazing food. I have been inside twice and ordered out once. The service is  great and the people are so accommodating.  I have been to other Pita Jungles and they are not half as good. When I say that, I mean presentation."}
{"text":"I drove to Plato's Closet which is next door to Pita Jungle to sell some clothes and they told me there would be a 45 minute wait. So, I decided to head over to Pita Jungle. I asked if they had a happy hour and to my delight,  the bartender said yes! Their house wines are $3 and the glass is pretty big amd they definitely fill it up. I ordered the hummus trio (oh, did I mention it's only $1!!??!?!?) off their happy hour menu and it was delicious!! I also got an order of their garlic lemon chicken (for $2!!!) which was also yum yum yummmayy!! I highly recommend pita jungle! ESPECIALLY this location because of TYLER, MY AWESOMEEE SEVER/BARTENDER/AWESOME PERSON, LAUREN and DANI !! Awesome service and awesome personalities!!! Oh and awesome food!! ;)"}
{"text":"I had high hopes coming here, but I just have never left feeling satisfied. Not a terrible place to eat, but nothing memorable. Kind of bland."}
{"text":"You get back into town and all you want is some PJ. They don't have PJ where you live so it's all you can taste during the long drive.   10:30 is here and the excitement starts shortly after parking the car. You enter the restaurant and all see is someone mopping the floors while the three cooks are waiting to throw your food on the grill.  Nicely, you ask the waitress if they are open, assuming 10:30 means 10:30.  She explains how she will need an additional 10 mins to mop the floor because the floor was just tiled. She kindly offered me a drink, which i declined.   I decided to test this situation and throw one more thing at her... I stated, \"I'll just go somewhere else, no big deal\". How's she going to handle this one? Is she really going to let me leave? It's a mop for God's sake.  Her response... \"I'm sorry\". ??  Clearly she isn't the owner and has never owned a restaurant. You can't let anyone walk away when your profits margins run 17-20%. Please coach this person in basic business mgmt.   I will be back as you have a monopoly on amazing food."}
{"text":"We love Pita Jungle!!!! Stephanie is the best bartender we have ever had.. So good that we actually eat dinner at the bar to sit under her service!"}
{"text":"Servers are always rushed, scowling, understaffed, and in a bad mood... with only one good server out of the five times we've been to this Pita. The food is comparable to the other locations but the food is slow to arrive even when they aren't busy."}
{"text":"This is one of the better branches of this chain. Service is always amazing. They have a great happy hour and reverse happy hour. And the vegan/vegetarian options are really good."}
{"text":"Great choice for lunch or dinner. Appreciate the side window to accommodate phone/to go orders. As the other Pita Jungles, food is always great. However, I took away a star because of the somewhat inattentive staff when servicing the window. After I was handed my meal, I waited for a couple minutes and had to flag someone down to receive a copy of the itemized receipt so I can expense my work meal. They seem to have enough coverage on the floor and bar area to be too busy to see what else I needed. Hope they can improve on the service for the to go window!"}
{"text":"Always love me some Pita Jungle when I'm in the area. This is a great place for groups, as the menu caters to Vegans, Vegetarians, Carnivores, those that are health conscious, and others who don't count the calories. Although they do not take reservations for large parties, there is plenty of space to easily accommodate everyone. Meals are priced within reason, service is great, and the food is appetizing. Hipster/ eclectic decor with bohemian looking staff that are welcoming."}
{"text":"Healthy food at a mall food court?!? You got it.  This is the same Pita Jungle that you know and love, just with a reduced menu. Mostly the soups/salads and pita sandwiches... and a few appetizers. You know, stuff you can eat at the mall.  Food was served quickly and at the proper temperature, even during the busy lunch rush."}
{"text":"Any location.  Any time.  Any item on the menu... Amazing!  This is one of my fave spots.  Cute, fresh and consistent."}
{"text":"The jungle is the best.  My wife and I can get dinner and a bottle of wine for less than forty bucks.   And half their meals are to big to eat in one sitting."}
{"text":"Had a few dishes from Pita Jungle, but my favorite thing is the Blue Chip Nachos. It's perfect for finishing up some work at your desk and eat."}
{"text":"We LOVE this place and the servers! Come for the tapas during happy hour. Billiam and the servers will take great care of you!"}
{"text":"Always a good meal at Pita Jungle. I do enjoy their humus. They have a great fire roasted chicken with spinach. The only think I haven't cared for is their wraps here. Laid back, cultured ambiance and they have a good happy hour. Always good for a healthier bite to eat."}
{"text":"The food is always good here. bit of a hipster/Mediterranean/local ambiance. Their hummus is fresh and awesome. Mahi Mahi and Chips platter is very good. My favorite and regular dish is the Seared Ahi Tuna with Hummus. Jalapeno cilantro hummas is my favorite."}
{"text":"Mahi Mahi with cilantro jalape√±o hummus!!!!  There are no words!  The place was packed, everyone was smiling, it's a hit!"}
{"text":"Leaving for Chicago and I am going to miss Pita Jungle!! Our server Paulina was the absolute best. This place is so friendly and food is amazing. The manager even asked how our meal was and I couldn't wait to tell him it was great! This place is a must try."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and really like the food. The hummus is delicious and so is the veggie wrap. I liked the seasonal quinoa chili probably too much :) they have a veggie burger as well which is very good. The ice tea is good. It all is. The kids menu is very healthy and full of nutritional value. Love this place."}
{"text":"Not great service.   Got the large hummus. Ordered the spanakopita. The server never brought me silverware! I had to go and get it myself. The extra pita I ordered took forever to arrive only after I asked for it. Food was bland. Server not good at all . Won't be back. Also had same experience as another person. When I first walked in nobody there to greet and ask how many etc... Stood for a good 5 mins before hostess came up. Not a good first impression."}
{"text":"As a vegetarian this is a place I frequent...In fact since there was only one in Tempe!!!  Tonight I had the most awesome experience with Donna our server!  The food is ALWAYS GOOD and I am never disappointing.  BUT today I had a long busy day at work and i was STARVING....my sister and I both hadn't eaten all day and we were so ready to scarf.  Our order came as expected, our drinks were never empty and Donna had the greatest energy and smile.  I really appreciated her extra attention as well as the to go cup full of tea as she handed us our bill!!!!  WOW we never asked but she knew we were thirsty obviously!  Thank you so much for not only paying attention to our needs and the special to go drinks!  YOU ROCK!!!"}
{"text":"Great, healthy place to grab a bite. Amazing service, Steve killed it! I can't rant enough about this place. We need one in Seattle!"}
{"text":"Ordered for a Bunco party and they went above and beyond to take care of me! Even gave me a free Greek salad that they made that someone didn't want! Awesome service and awesome food!"}
{"text":"I go for lunch and the service is always kind and accommodating. Great food, and supportive of diet restrictions. Quick and delicious"}
{"text":"Dear Pita Jungle Shea location, Why do you continue to leave off my accompaniments?  Every other location remembers a slice of tomato, cucumber, and olives w/the Hummus & Chicken.   It is simple, but it makes the dish so much more special.  Please step up your game. - thanks."}
{"text":"This has been a fave of mine since they were a teeny, rectangular spot on Apache.  I have been so happy to see how much they have grown and the success they have enjoyed and that they STILL make awesome, healthy - so YUMMY food!  The hummus & taboulleh combo is killer - the chicken schwarma is super good - I love the Mediterranean platter... and the fatoosh salad is way too yummy to be that healthy!"}
{"text":"My family eats here at least once a week. The food is delicious and the service is outstanding. Tabor, the bartender, is always on top of things. Servers Joe and Dennis are great too! All of them are kind to our kids-this is our kids favorite restaurant (and they are picky!). The manager, Mike, is always doing a great job making sure the restaurant is running smoothly.   The kids meals are a great option! For just $5 you get a huge, healthy meal and a drink.   My favorite appetizers are the hummus and falafel. I also really like the baba ghanoush. They have various types of pita too-I prefer the Greek pita. If you are into veggie burgers, you will not be disappointed with theirs. For a great side dish-try the carmelized cauliflower-it is amazing!  If you aren't sure about what to order just ask your server. I haven't had a meal here that I didn't like. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I have been coming to The Original Pita Jungle in Tempe on Apache for 21 years, yep hard to believe.  I mostly order the hummus dishes, wood fired roasted chicken shawarma, wood fired pizza's especially the lavosh and glazed-chicken lavosh pizzas.  I have tried many items, but always savor the taste of the most comforting food in my top 5 go-to eatery's so close to home.     I can write more about the great tasting food at PJ's but if you have not tried it yet, you'll have to keep reading what mostly everyone has stated on their reviews until you do."}
{"text":"Had dinner here last night. We used to go once a week and have dropped back a bit because of the service. PJ knows that the food is good and the price is right. They pack the house even though the servers treat you more like a nuisance than a valued customer, which is why they don't improve (and the only reason I knocked off 2 stars). I know they are all super-emo-cool but come on, there are lots of places to eat and the economy is bad! Treat me like you're happy to see me spending money in your restaurant! I have high hopes for the soon to open Desert Ridge location.  The chicken and hummus and lavosh shawarma were right on, as usual. You might be aggravated with the staff but you won't be disappointed with the food. Carry out anyone?"}
{"text":"Heavy, flavorful Greek food. Portions are more than ample for the average person and lots of fresh ingredients.  Went at lunch and staff was harried but friendly. Pretty busy with lots of hustle-bustle but they got our party of 6 in surprisingly quickly."}
{"text":"YOU GOTTA GO!!  I have been there several times - each experience has been wonderful - friendly staff, great food, great price!! This last time, our waiter SAM was funny and professional and AKHIL... what can I say about AKHIL.. he noticed that we ordered hummas and didnt have any \"green stuff\" (cilantro jalapeno hummus) and asked if we wanted to try it.. brought us a sample... YUM!!!! (now my very favorite - the hummus and AKHIL - lol) he also made a kind remark when he noticed that the \"green stuff\" came on my mahi mahi plate (something to the effect of \"nice choice - I hope you like it\")... it goes without saying that I LOVE this place, the people are all so friendly and fun!! KUDOS to you all for making my experience something other than good food at a good price.. which is the case.. and if that weren't enough, in addition -  the people, the fun, and the service are EXCELLENT!!!  FAVORITES: Cilantro Jalapeno Hummus, Mahi Mahi Plate, Tropical Fruit Salad"}
{"text":"I have to start by saying that I really love Pita Jungle and dine frequently at their various restaurants throughout Phx metro area.  I enjoy their variety of healthy and delicious food  options.  However, my last two experiences at the 7th and Missouri store have fallen short due to poor service.  I placed an order for takeout at the bar last Friday and waited more than a half hour, which I wouldn't mind if other people at the bar hadn't placed similar orders and been served immediately.  Plus, after I finished my glass of wine, I was never asked if I'd like another - just sat there waiting. The shortfall on the previous occasion was after we were served, the wait staff pretty much disappeared - we had to seek them out even for the check. It may just be because this is one of the newer stores, but there are many new restaurant options in this area and customers don't need to tokerate poor service.  I was impressed by Bettina's quick follow up and have sent the requested info by email."}
{"text":"I'm so glad I finally got to try this place out! I'd never heard of the chain until I moved out to Phoenix and had thought it was nothing more than something similar to a Pita Pit...Not the case!   While their menu did have some pita options, it offered many other diverse mediterranean dishes...everything ranging from Mahi Mahi to Chicken Masala, to pesto spinach salad dishes. Wow!  The group went with the hummus trio app (jalapeno cilantro, original, and red pepper) and the tzatziki sauce with fresh pita bread and pita chips - so fresh and flavorful, especially the jalapeno cilantro - a must try!   My spinach pasta dish was  delicious and filling (the portions are pretty big!).. pesto pasta abed spinach with a lemon vinaigrette.   While the service was a bit spotty (we had a group of 10 during the lunch rush), I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My life is now complete that I have tried the jalapeno cilantro hummus here. Best hummus of my life. Came here twice during my trip and both times the hummus was fantastic and fresh. Tried a wrap and it was good but the second visit my entree was not what I expected at it tasted very similar to Indian  food."}
{"text":"On the way from home (San Francisco) from Tuscon (by way of Disneyland), I wanted to meet up with a friend that lives in Phoenix. He suggested Pita Jungle for a late lunch.   Service was good, the a nice mix of attentive and patient. My friend actually lives in Scottsdale, so it took him longer to make it there than it took us, so the waiter was chill about us sitting at the table drinking iced tea for half an hour before my friend arrived. I wouldn't go as far as to call it excellent, but a solid \"good\".  The menu offered several yummy sounding options, but having eaten Lucky Wishbone one last time a few hours before when we left Tuscon, I really just wanted a light snack while visiting with my friend. So lucky for us, we were there during \"happy hour\" which offered plenty of very inexpensive snack options ($1 hummus trio, $2 fallafel, etc.) We were able to get a nice sampling of tastes on the cheap, and satisfy the snack level hunger while catching up with my friend... i couldn't really ask for more..   The iced tea was also very tasty! If I lived in Phoenix, I would certainly go back :)"}
{"text":"I was so surprised how many vegan choices there were on the menu! We decided to try the Falafel salad, Veggie wrap, and the cilantro jalapeno hummus. YUM! The salad was very good, and the hummus was delicious. But the warm veggie wrap was incredible! I don't know if we just got lucky today, but I wouldn't change a single thing about our visit. We'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"I recently wrote a review about Pita Jungle's take out service.  I was contacted withing a couple of days and asked about my review and they also graciously thanked me for my review and information.  I have been in contact with them and they are working to correct the problem.   They did make things right with me and I do thank them very much.  As I informed them, that incident would not stop me from going there just cautious about the take out.  I am very confident that Pita Jungle will correct any problems with take out orders and gladly give then a \"I'm a fan\" recommendation and will suggest them to others as well.   Thank you for taking care of the problem."}
{"text":"Pretty good place! Friends who live nearby asked me to meet them there and I was literally expecting a place like the Pita Pit. Who knew I would find a full-service restaurant and bar that had a great atmosphere! Really was an awesome time! I enjoyed the chicken platter that had a good piece of chicken on top of hummus with veggies. It was really tasty! I liked how this place was able to mix up dishes and come up with some creative recipes. Friends had kids and the waitress kept them busy with crayons, thankfully. Would definitely try again!"}
{"text":"The food here is eclectic and delicious. And the decor has really changed for the better over the years.  It is so tiny and intimate.   I have always secretly wanted to have a loud and awkward break-up fight here."}
{"text":"My family and I went to the restaurant on he 1st of April. My 9 year old daughter ordered a kids plate with chicken. She ate the chicken and commented how she thought the chicken tasted funny. I tried it and spit it out. We informed the waitress who blew it off. 5 Hours in the emergency room as my daughter got food poisoning! The hospital told us to inform the restaurant and I spoke to a manager who said he will send us a gift card right away to retry the restaurant. I said I will give the gift card to charity. Now the 12th and gift card still not here either. Terrible service and terrible management. *****STAY AWAY******"}
{"text":"I am a vegetarian and there is a ton of great stuff at Pita Jungle. I just had the hummus trio, babaganoush, dolmas, mozzarella, and feta for appetizers tonight. Fantastic happy hour on the apps and delicious. Took BLACK BEAN BURGER to go. SOOOO good! Also, servers are super nice and prompt. YAY!"}
{"text":"Always love coming here. It's always packed and the outdoor patio looks out over a nice lake. Service is always decent, nothing special. It's a healthy alternative to anything else, I think."}
{"text":"My wife and I really enjoy this place. Great food, prices and service. Their Spicy Chicken wrap is wonderful and HUGE! You can just eat that and be very content. Their garlic potatoes are also really great! Of course you can't go wrong with their hummus either. Great place overall and food!"}
{"text":"A crunchy vegans dream restaurant!  When I became a vegetarian Pita Jungle shot up high onto my list of go-to restaurants due to their focus on freshness and health, and their plentiful amounts of vegetarian centered menu.  Don't get me wrong, they have a variety of meat and fish dishes, and of course feta cheese!  But so much of their menu can easily be turned veggie or vegan in just a snap of the fingers.    It irked me when I would visit a restaurant and have to order the same, vaguely vegetarian menu item, usually smothered with cheese.  A few months back I took the leap from vegetarian to vegan and therefore that narrowed my menu selections even further, and eliminating nearly every chain restaurant.  In replace for those restaurants I welcomed Pita Jungle with open arms and it is my new favorite ever since!    Talk about delicious fresh food, hearty portions, and wonderful customer service!  Everything my family and I have ever ordered has been completely satisfying, it is apparent each dish is made with attention to detail and is typically brought to the table by someone with a beaming smile.  Wonderful place filled with wonderful food & people!"}
{"text":"Awesome food and service.  Menu has lots to offer and many options for all picky diners.  Fresh food and healthy options."}
{"text":"You got to come by and see Katie best waitress I've had Mues food was delicious and the company was even better"}
{"text":"Four Stars simply due to the Cilantro Jalapeno Hummus. The sentiment has already been expressed and I will back it up. Best thing on the menu, hands down!"}
{"text":"First time at Pita Jungle and I fell inlove with it! Always a favorite place to have dinner on a random weekday or buy brunch for to go on a weekend. Service is excellent, the place or theme isn't something I like but it's decent and clean enough to enjoy a dine in.   Always a favorite appetizer is their humus and pita bread, the server recommended half of the humus dip with silantro and now it's one of the things we'll surely go back for.  I ordered their Chicken Tikimasala, i love how the chicken is cooked with the coconut sauce, I couldnt finish one order so I always have something to bring home. My husband got their new dishes the spicy shrimp and mango and it is tasty! The price is def worth it for the serving size!   I love Pita Jungle and will surely visit again next month!"}
{"text":"Women seem to really appreciate this place/menu.  Me, not so much - however I do appreciate any local place that displays and sells local artwork - so thumbs up there.  I've been solo, with friends/family and in groups.  I've shared several different appetizers (nothing memorable).  In near every case Iv'e ordered the gyro which I will state is fresh, it's just not real flavorful.  On one occasion during a packed house I got a gyro in 6 minutes - the waitress knew I didn't want to wait (This was my 3rd stop by during that week hoping to be seated quickly, the first 2 times I waited a few minutes at the desk and no one was there and i walked).  So this will get me to come back on my own again in the future.  Service seems to a bit of a roller coaster."}
{"text":"Oh Pita Jungle, I've returned...and my commitment to you is still intact.  It's hard to please everyone in a group of 8 when deciding where to head out for dinner but I somehow managed to convince everyone to head over to Pita Jungle while on vacation one night.  I went back to old trusty when I ordered the Cilantro/Jalepeno hummus for the table. EVERYONE enjoyed this. There was even talks of \"Ohhhh, I want to learn how to make this\" (since we sadly don't have a PJ here in Chicago). Everyone seemed to enjoy their meals and the $3 glasses of sangria can't be beat. I had a chicken shawarma pita and it was just as excellent as I remembered! Fast forward 2 days later, and I'm back at it again. Of course we had the Cilantro/Jalepeno hummus and $3 sangrias. This time for my main course I had the Wood-Fired Chicken which is Wood-fired marinated chicken breast on a bed of wilted spinach and garlic herb smashed potatoes with a light garlic tomato sauce. The tomato sauce is amazing! The chicken breast was plump and juicy.  I wish I would have tried this entr√©e sooner, it was amazing. Eating here proves that if you want delicious and healthy options, you can go out to a restaurant to get it.   The staff couldn't be friendlier. Our food was taking longer than they expected (honestly, we didn't think it was taking a long time...we're used to waiting a lot longer for things here in Chi-City) and our server, the manager, and even the chef apologized to us and offered up another appetizer for us to enjoy. We were all blown away by how friendly and awesome the service is.   Pita Jungle will forever be one of my most favorite places. It's just so perfect."}
{"text":"The food was better than ever tonight and that is saying a lot!!  The spinach pasta salad w/ chicken was amazing as was the Quinoa salad.  My son loved his chicken, broccoli, cheese crisp & fruit.  I have been to the one on Shea 2x & have been disappointed both times. For us, Pita Jungle only exists here and at Desert Ridge.  Thanks Lauren (our waitress) for being exceptional."}
{"text":"2nt time here, and went before the FC Arizona game.. Place was half full, but waiter kept complaining about how PACKED they were and even ran out of beer Glasses/stein/pints or whatever.. oh well,,,   We tried their spicy mango shrimp dish,, somethign new.. was pretty good, the rice was almost fully cooked, but close enough,, seasoned perfectly, the only downer was the Ginger chunks were pretty big and when u locked into one, it was a little overboard.. but, If they calmed down on the size of ginger pieces n let the rice cook about 2 more minutes, it would be really good !!  Will try again for sure.."}
{"text":"I was expecting more of a fast food joint. But I was pleasantly surprised. I had the mahi mahi with pita chips and all though the food was well prepared , I think the fish could have been more fresh, it wasn't bad but I definitely had fresher fish around here."}
{"text":"BEST PLACE EVER!!!!!!!!!!!! I love the chicken med salad and the chicken hummus. so good!!"}
{"text":"Worst customer service, no one looks like they want to be there. The guy walked away before finishing my order started to wipe down then he skipped me twice. Didn't get what I wanted it either so I'm not going back."}
{"text":"This pita jungle is not as good as the other locations.  For example, their hummus was runny and had too much lemon juice.  Their tabouli salad was also weird because they did not chop the parsley fine enough and there were huge leaves and stems left in it.  Just drive to the tempe location and use the campus coupon book to get a free side (cauliflower and tahini...mmmm)."}
{"text":"Love it, love it, love it! I have been eating at various Pita Jungles around the Valley since I moved to AZ over 6 years ago and I have yet to have anything that I didn't love. My favorites include the Black Bean Burger, Lentil Fetoosh Salad, all three hummus types, dolmas, and gazpacho, but everything is delicious, so you really can't go wrong! The Tempe location also has breakfast, which is amazing!   Each location is fairly small, so luch and dinner may require a short wait, but its worth it. The prices are fair and the portions are huge! Don't be afraid to split a dish with a loved one."}
{"text":"This is a very common place I go to with co-workers. I personally am not a fan of humus so I get the same thing every time, which is one of the very yummy salads. Even going during the lunch rush the service is quick and the food is good. I will continue to recommend this place even during lunch."}
{"text":"The cilantro and jalape√±o hummus was killer; it will blow your F-ING face off!!! The chicken shwarma wrap was awesome as well."}
{"text":"I have eaten here several times and have enjoyed it every time. This place gets pretty crowded during lunch, which is when I come, so obviously I'm not the only one who enjoys dining here.   Pros: Fun atmosphere, the decor changes from time to time Service is fast, friendly and knowledgeable Great selection of fresh, healthy food for vegetarians and carnivores Reasonably priced Indoor and outdoor seating Very clean  Cons: I miss the original Mediterranean Platter with the green bean salad!  Tip: Definitely try the Lentil Fatoosh and ask for Sriracha sauce. I found out about this dish from my doctor, of all people."}
{"text":"very kind customer service, and I love their humus trio or Mediterranean salad."}
{"text":"I went last night with a small group of friends. The food was good. My friends loved their spankopita, i loved the hummus it was smooth and creamy, like you have never seen hummus this smooth before.    I had the baklava but on they call it baklawa, dont ask me why. It was hard to get my fork to cut me a piece, but still edible and tasted like baklava should. I just wish it was a little softer.  loved the atomsphere and the decor,  felt so laid back and hipster-ish.. canvas painting on the walls and cool looking people :)..  Our waitress was supernice and caring. she let us stay at the table after we were done and we stayed until 10pm (we were there at 6!) on a Tuesday night.. it wasnt too crowded but it was a good crowd for the middle of the week- on thanksgiving week.  i'm definitely coming back!!! for the gyros and hummus and ill try new stuff during happy hour because the HH prices are cheap!"}
{"text":"Tapas are good for HH - the chicken, shrimp and babaganoush are our go-to's...  Great space, parking is a little tricky, staff is mostly attentive.  Our group seemed to like the lavosh entrees and decent selection of beer for HH."}
{"text":"I love this location! The three times I've been here the service and food is both always amazing! The location is very easy to find, super clean inside and I have yet to have a problem here. The food is always amazing and Mercedes is super friendly the two times I've seen her here with my friend!"}
{"text":"This place does get very cold so I recommend either sitting outside or bringing something with you to cover up for your time being in here. Service is very fast and speedy but sometimes can be slow, but that just depends on what you happen to order. The place is quite loud which is somewhat annoying but I can tolerate it because of the amazing food that they have. The hummus and chicken trio is what I get every time and it is amazing! I definitely recommend it if you are going here for your first time! The grilled vegetables are also super good probably because of the seasoning that they put on it. Prices are good but could be cheaper on some items on the menu."}
{"text":"Love this place. Food is always amazing and I get the hummus which everyone should get if you ever go here because it is so good! All of the portions are huge which leave you very full and you definitely get your money's worth here. The place can be pretty loud though because of the super high ceilings and the concrete floors but that's fine with me and you can always sit outside where they have a bunch of fans and umbrellas for hot days. Employees are always nice smiling and asking if everything is good or if you need anything else."}
{"text":"Was seated quickly when we got there. Our server was a great server. It took a while to make up my mind what I wanted and he was patient with me while I decided. He came back every so often to see if I had made up my mind. We ordered our food and it did not take long for it to come. The portions are a great size. They do not want you leaving hungry. My food was good, a Mediterranean Tuna Pita salad thing. Prices are reasonable. Two meals for about $24.00 and two drinks. It is an inviting atmosphere. I would plan on going back here for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"My friends love this place more than any other in Phoenix.  This time we went and ate a sampler platter, falafel, and iced tea (they have several flavors-excellent!).  We didn't order an actual entree, but the platter was filling and tasty.  Pita Jungle still isn't my favorite place in town, but if I stick to the basics they'll be satisfying."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times.  The food is pretty good and the staff is friendly and attentive.  The gyro bowl is my favorite."}
{"text":"A staple in our dining rotation. Never disappointed and always on the list to take the out of towners.   Happy hour is top notch and the newly added brunch is a must try.  Service is always top notch for me and the atmosphere is relaxed and welcoming.   Try the cilantro hummus and the chicken curry salad. I think the salmon burger is a sleeper menu item that is amazingly delicious.   I LOVE PITA JUNGLE!"}
{"text":"Be sure to check your credit card statements when you use a credit card here. My card was used to pay two other peoples bills. I called the manager and brought it to her attention. She did remove the charges and was going to get back to me as to why they were on there. Called back again and spoke to the general manager Scott who said he was the one who did it because they couldn't figure out whose credit card belonged to whose bill so he figured since the bills were only an $8 difference it wouldn't matter whose card he charged it to. Proceeded to tell me that he has no idea why the next day my card was used again for another charge. Unbelievable that they think it is okay to carelessly charge peoples cards without knowing if it is actually their bill. I won't go to Pita Jungle again because of this."}
{"text":"Great variety on the menu.Service was awesome. I did not care for the chicken shawarma wrap but got it switfly changed to something else. They get really busy at lunch time. Our server Annie was very friendly and efficient. My only gripe about the space is it gets very loud. Other than that, I am a fan!"}
{"text":"Ericka, the bartender, is amazing! The food is great and so is the service. They have an awesome cute patio in the back! Highly recommend and make sure to ask for Ericka!"}
{"text":"I just don't get the Pita Jungle craze. What am I missing? I feel so left out!   I've been to Pita Jungle at least 10-15 times because of friends who just *love* it. I've tried dish after dish and nothing has really resonated with me. Everything has been okay, but never spectacular."}
{"text":"This is one of their more chill locations and the staff are good people.  I'm always treated with a lot of respect and when it's not over crowded, fast service.    It's an intensely popular location, which is probably why so many people get upset with delays in orders.  I've walked out several times because I was either forgotten or my food took over 30 minutes.  I've seen people get really upset over their food taking so long but the cooks are to blame for that, not their waiters.     All in all, it's a great place to eat but extremely popular.  Anyone going there should realize this before hand.  If your food takes to long, tell the manager and he'll likely give you the meal for free ( reasonably long ), they've done it for me.    The management is professional and reasonable and the only reason I put up with the traffic."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. I frequently come here sometime multiple times a week for lunch or dinner. The staff is always very friendly and the service is always exceptional with amazing food. I have tried a majority of the menu option ,and I have yet to be disappointed."}
{"text":"Came during the lunch rush, so the service wasn't the best. But that's kind of what you expect with this place.   Tried a variety of items. The Kraft burger was delicious. Nice level of spice to it. The salad it came with had an amazing dressing.   Philly steak pita was just like a Philly sandwich only in a pita. The pita was the perfect level of softness for it.   The hummus and pita was pretty good. Loved the hummus but I wished the pita was more like the pita they use for the pita \"sandwiches.\"  It was a little hard for my liking.   The chipotle chicken pizza was delicious. One of our friends in the group thought it was too spicy. I barely thought it had any spice to it. Very crispy pita crust.   The $5 kids meals are really a great deal. Delicious seasoned chicken (or whatever protein you chose) along with a fruit, veggie and I think a grain (mine got a pita). And a kids drink too."}
{"text":"I've wanted to try this place for some time and was not disappointed.   The place was busy when I walked in and was greeted and offered seating immediately.  I'll keep this short and relevant.   I had a hard time choosing from the menu.  I can't wait to come back and try a number of items, especially after observing neighboring diner's dishes.  Wow.  This place offers healthy, creative dining options that are absolutely impressive.  Service was oustanding and I can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"what is there to say? This place is amazing. The food is great, the service is awesome, and its as casual as casual gets. This is a great place for a date, hang out, or any occasion."}
{"text":"Pita Jungle is located within Norterra next to the Movie Theatre.  Service is always speedy and friendly.  My favorite is the Trio Hummus with Chicken and baked Pita Chips - its perfect to share."}
{"text":"Great spot for lunch.  Quick and easy sit down, slightly loud but enjoyable atmosphere.  I had the chicken avocado pita tostada, which was amazing.  The menu is expansive and typically leans healthy.  Lots of options."}
{"text":"Love this Pita Jungle. It's a lot less loud than the one off 75th and Bell, even when it's busy. Good service and delicious food. Great happy hour!"}
{"text":"Noisy, but nice.   I met a girlfriend here for a lunch so we could catch up. The restaurant is very noisy; just one big room with an open kitchen. Most of the tables are so close together, you can hear other people's conversations. Although, I will say that the couple next to us were having a fascinating conversation about Sarah Palin and the whole \"I've got you in my cross-hairs thing\" and I was tempted to join in.   That said the food is good, healthy, fresh, and plentiful. My friend enjoyed the gyros, big and bursting with meat and crisp vegetables. I had the glazed-chicken lavosh pizza; delicious with honey mustard glazed chicken, cheese, and onions. Just as important, the lavosh pizza was artfully presented and people around me asked me what I'd ordered.   Prices are fair and the wait staff is friendly. As I was paying the bill, I asked for a drink refill and the server brought it to me in a to-go cup, nice."}
{"text":"Good, fresh food at a good price.  If I lived in Phoenix still I would eat here regularly.  Extensive menu and friendly service.  Their falafel is awesome, as is the hummus!  My only complaint is that the wraps are nearly impossible to eat as-is.  I have to cut 'em up with a knife and a fork because they are so huge."}
{"text":"I'm visiting from Chicago which has some of the best Mediterranean food and this place really impressed me. The Caramelized cauliflower was to die for as well as the cilantro jalape√±o humus. I legitimately yelled oh my God agreed taking a bite of the chocolate covered baklava. It was that good!"}
{"text":"First time at Pita Jungle today! Nicest pita establishment I've been in, has a great atmosphere!  I had the falafel pita and it was pretty good, my man had the avocado chicken tostado and that was delicious. Nice healthy choice for a hot day."}
{"text":"So far, I've been to two of their locations, and I absolutely love this place.  The atmosphere, decor, the food - all of it amazing."}
{"text":"As always, love the Pita Jungle food. The atmosphere is lacking. Very cold, sterile, and I'm not one to enjoy cold metal seating."}
{"text":"updating my review to 3.5. i noticed an improvement in customer service and genuine friendliness.  my favorites are the garlic potatoes, the lavosh shawarma wrap and hummus after working out. i prefer to order my food to go. fridays and saturdays gets crazy busy like a jungle."}
{"text":"This is a regular spot for me and my friends. The service is always friendly and great. The food is never bad, and they are willing to do special requests.  The red pepper hummus is bomb!   Just wish they had breakfast like the Tempe location!"}
{"text":"Helpful staff, wonderful food. Love the breakfast here. Staff is plesant. Parking is OK. Friday nights typically have good eye candy too!"}
{"text":"Great, fresh food and great service every time. The hummus trio is great and the Tika Masala is one of our favorites."}
{"text":"This has to be the worst location I've ever been to, which is a bummer because this is right in my neighborhood and happy hour is unbeatable. That being said I am a huge Pita Jungle fan and I always will be. The reason for my disappointment is service related...I've never been treated well here. Our garlic dip appetizer came right out and our server disappeared. Like to the point where we tried to flag someone down for 15 minutes to no avail, brought the plate inside ourselves to get a to go box and had to close up at the bar because of our MIA server. Unfortunately I won't be dining in anytime soon, I'll just get my food to go and enjoy elsewhere."}
{"text":"I have been a loyal customer at the old location since they opened in 1994. I was excited to go to the new location, and it had been awhile since my last visit to the Tempe location. Well... what a disappointment for several reasons: 1) Parking is joke 2) Food quality has gone down hill. My Tikka Masala was horribly overcooked as was my daughter's Chicken with Hummus. 3)The waiter spills half a pitcher of water & ice on our table that lands on top of my daughter's iphone, chicken and pita, and never offers to take it off the bill or replace it. 4)The restaurant smelled like it might have sewage backup when I went to the restroom. \"Why do all good things come to an end?\""}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with pita jungle! I've been to the Tempe as well as the Mesa locations! Both locations are really nice, but I like this one (on Apache) because it does look artsy/funky and has awesome vibes!   So let's talk food!!! I sincerely have enjoyed every meal at this place, whether it was an appetizer, a salad, a sandwich/wrap, pizza or a pasta/rice dish! I even enjoyed their desserts (once, I got rice pudding).  What dishes do I like a lot? 1) Their chicken-hummus appetizer 2) Their seasonal kafta burger with an amazing salad and a side of potatoes  3) Their coconut curry soup! 4) Falafel sandwich  What do they all have in common? They are very flavorful, and better yet, they don't feel heavy/fatty at all! The best thing actually is that the Mediterranean food really tastes authentic (I am strictly talking about the hummus, baba ghanouj, falafel and chicken shawarma).  They close everyday at 10pm (I think)!  Also, they have reverse happy hour that starts at 9pm, where they serve awesome tapas ranging from $1 to $3 for the most part! Yumm.  The service is typically very prompt! I barely have anything to complain about when it comes to service! The staff seems to be really cool and excited about what they do!    All in all, I am glad this place exists in my life :)"}
{"text":"Not all pita jungles are created equal. We've tried 4 or more around the valley because we love their menu, but this one didn't pass muster. To credit where it's due, the manager & waitress did resolve the problem & took my meal off of the bill. The problem was with the chef. My \"steamed\" vegetables came out raw. Their idea of Zucchini rice was microscopic flakes of blackened zucchini & the toasted zucchini wasn't present at all. Also pine nuts were missing. And the food came out so fast as if it had been sitting under a heat lamp and it was also only lukewarm. The berry tea was bitter instead of sweet. All in all it was very disappointing."}
{"text":"Always order salad when I come here. But hummus trio is by far my fav. With cucumbers!"}
{"text":"Went to the pita jungle  today food was ok he'd huge gristle in my pizza  a bit expensive  but.  Service was good .... I also had lipstick  and food stuck to my glass of lemonade  and didn't notice till my son and myself  drank some yuck don't think we will go back.even tho they compinsated with free food"}
{"text":"Place is great they have stuff for everyone. I almost always get the gyro but my whole family besides me is vegan and going out to eat w them is a pain in the ass, but this place makes it easy and less of a headache for me. Kudos!"}
{"text":"Absolutely in love with Pita Jungle now! Nice relaxing low key place to get a bite to eat. Walked it and picked out wherever we wanted to sit. Nice selection of gyros, salads, pizza's etc. Service was great. My sister whp is picky as hell ordered a salad that did ended up not being what she thought it was and they exchanged it for something else she wanted without any problems. I was willing to pay for both, but they were awesome about it and exchanged it with no charge! Sometimes you might get a waiter/waitress who would act bitchy about this and given the fact they were so cool about it, def earned them extra brownie points. Everyone enjoyed their food and the pesto pizza is fan.tas.tic. Non greasy food that you actually feel good about eating.   Glad i checked this place out..great prices, good food and service."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong here for dinner! I think my to go to dish here is the jalape√±o hummus and the black bean burger!!! TWO THUMBS UP.  service was great. Quick in and out really. :)"}
{"text":"i love me some pita jungle!! love that there is also a location downtown by my place of lovely employment :)  you will find everything you would at all the other locations, the jalapeno hummus is awesome !  just a tip *** if you are ordering and you only have an hr for lunch i HIGHLY suggest calling in and ordering for pick up. this location being downtown is always hectic!  p.s met the Mayor of Phoenix here on a lunch time run.. good to know he enjoys a good plate of hummus ;)"}
{"text":"I always order the wood fired chicken! It has mashed potatoes, Spinach and tomatoes.. its so yummy."}
{"text":"Ordered the turkey lavosh wrap to go last minute.   The guy who took the order was okay but the customer service when I walked in the door was great. The two hostess were very friendly and prompt in getting me my food, running my credit card and making sure my food was all in the bag.  I was very impressed.   Once I took a bit into the wrap it was sooooo good!"}
{"text":"There are so many things to like about this restaurant; admittedly a few shortcomings, but not enough to deduct a star.  As best I can determine there are over 3000 restaurants in the Phoenix metropolitan area, some 2000 of which have some form of liquor license, and there are hundreds that close each year and hundreds that open.  Based on these numbers that means one could eat (and drink) in a different restaurant every day for six years, and at the end of that time there would be two years of new establishments to try.  [That I should live so long :)]  To me the characteristics that have made Pita Jungle thrive in this \"jungle\" are three: people, quality food, and consistency.    People:  Bartenders and servers are the \"first responders\" in a dining/drinking establishment; those at Pita Jungle are top shelf.  Nichol, Melissa, and Rachel behind the bar not only do an awesome job in a fast paced environment, but have the ability to connect faces with names and the memory to remember the favorite drinks of those faces/names.  Kristi, Lisa, Mattie, Helen, Jen, Sabrina, Ashley, Kyle, and Eddie all do a fantastic job as servers seemingly performing akin to a ballet as they dance around tables and patrons with a smile, a kind word for all, and fulfill all requests.  Although I am not personally acquainted with the kitchen staff, the incredible food and consistent quality of that food speaks volumes as to their abilities.  Food: Up front; there are no bargains on food here; that said, you get what you pay for.  The portion of most items are extremely large and fairly priced, with an excellent presentation.  To this day, I still find myself looking at what my neighbors have ordered and asking \"what's that\".  My favorite starters are any of the three hummus offerings - plain, roasted bell pepper, and cilantro jalape√±o (they offer a combo of all three), the baba ganoosh, and the tzatziki.  The wood fired salmon salad, seasoned with Za'atar, is a memorable lunch; with the salmon also available as an entree and a side dish (I enjoy all three - especially with a side order of spinach).  I notice that many \"healthy eaters\" seem to enjoy the 'macro platter' and the 'chicken combo platter'.  If you have not yet enjoyed lavash pizza, delay no longer.  My absolute fav is the roasted garlic and portobello mushroom; however if your day or evening requires that you cannot reek of the \"stinking rose\", the chipotle chicken is also a great choice.  As regards desserts, I have eaten both the regular baklava and the chocolate dipped baklava, as well as the carrot cake; and although okay, I would suspect that all are the standard issue of outside purveyors.   Drink:  if Pita Jungle has a weakness it is in their wine list - over priced both by the glass and the bottle.  It is generally a given that restaurant prices approach 2 - 2 1/2 times the retail bottle price; Pita Jungle abuses this theory with their glass prices closely approximating the retail price of a bottle.  This is a universal criticism I have heard of the restaurant. On Mondays they offer their wine list at half price by the bottle and I can usually be found at the bar enjoying a glass or two, with the remainder being resealed and going home in doggie bag (not in the passenger compartment of a vehicle!)    Random thoughts:  Eye candy - male and female, servers and patrons, is a definite benefit!  Great patio now that the weather is changing. No wi-fi for patrons - as they say on ESPN \"c'mon man\" (this is 2017!)  Lose the hideous giant silver colored plastic centerpiece that servers are constantly moving from table to table.  I had lunch here recently with an acquaintance who is opening new high end bar and grill at the end of this month; his question to me, \" you seem to know many of these people, how many can I poach\".  My answer; \"none, I hope; I enjoy this spot as is.\"  Happy Hour apps are a great value; drinks/wine not so much.  I have never ordered takeout or catering; given the volume I see being done, it must duplicate the quality and consistency served in the restaurant. If you have any issues at this restaurant ask for Jeff, a manager who seems to be here every hour they are open; or in his absence, Nichol who often pulls double duty as both a bartender and manager.  Enjoy - worth the trip."}
{"text":"Delicious, reasonably priced.  It can get very busy during lunch, so be prepared to wait a little while for your order.  However, the food was great, and the staff friendly.  The Macro Platter was everything I needed.  Tofu, brown rice, a bean medley and veggies.  It's so easy to eat healthy here.  I'll definitely be back whenever I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Our waiter was very nice, everything was clean.  That is it for the good stuff.  There was nowhere to stand while we waited for a table.  It took me a couple of minutes to get one of the bartender girls to get us some menus to look at.   My husband ordered the \"wood-fired chicken\" off of the specials menu.  It was covered in a lot of cilantro (not in the description) and he hates cilantro.   i also ordered from the specials menus and got the \"ginger stir-fry\".  It was so salty that i couldn't eat it.  Since it was for a birthday, i just tried to pick out the vegetables that weren't as bad.   My father-in-law got a side of the \"garlic new potatoes\".  He didn't complain, but half of them were burnt, and the rest looked okay; like divided down the middle.  And the water tasted like tap water.  Couldn't even wash the the salty noodles down with a drink.  While the open kitchen seemed like it would make it feel like all the cooking was fresh, it was piled with enormous stacks of plastic to-go containers, just like the hostess station.  weird."}
{"text":"Food is always good, takeout needs improving. They always put you on hold for a long period of time. Once I was on hold for so long that I decided to drive there while on hold to order in person. I was still on hold when I got there and mentioned it to them and they shrugged their shoulders like oh well.   3 takeout orders have now been a disappointment. First mistake, side potatoes were so over cooked they were like potato croutons. 2nd mistake, ordered chicken shawarma as a bowl and received a salad."}
{"text":"The food is always delicious at Pita Jungle and never disappoints! However, service is always lacking and I never feel like any Pita Jungle I go to has a professional staff. I went here with a friend to grab dinner and we and another group of people were the only customers there when we were first seated. It took our waitress no joke, 15 minutes to take our drink order! While four other employees stood behind the bar/take out area and were talking to each other not doing anything. There were two waitresses waiting tables and four people behind a bar/take out area that had no people at it. After we FINALLY got our WATER we waited another ten minutes for the waitress to take our food order. Food came out, it was great! I needed a refill on my water halfway through my meal and where was our waitress? Standing with the other four employees talking. I couldn't believe my eyes.   Pita Jungle, your food is great, but you need to have better training and better managers on site because this isn't the only location that has issues. I hesitate ever coming to Pita Jungle because I know my service is going to be poor."}
{"text":"The only reason why I'm not giving this 5 stars is the demeanor of the personnel.  I understand that this is a fast food place (at the Fashion Square Mall in Scottsdale), but still, the personnel must be friendlier in order to get a top rating.  Most other places in the food court were empty while Pita Jungle was bustling.  We had the Mediterranean Chicken Salad, which was absolutely delicious and a very generous portion too with plenty of chicken."}
{"text":"The food tasted good. Served pretty quick. The reason for a 5 star is because of our server. Alexis was phenomenal. On top of it, she warned me about an item that I was about to order had a small portion size, making sure I understand that I may not be full afterwards. I was pretty hungry and would have been disappointed.  I asked her about another item and she assured me that I would be happy with the amount of food given and I was. She smiled every time, filled our ice teas when needed and cleared our table when finished."}
{"text":"For people who want smaller meals but don't really want to take leftovers home, Pita Jungle's happy hour is for you.  I have gone there three days in a row and just might make tomorrow my fourth!  Their happy hours are 3-6 and after 9 seven days a week.  Tonight I had their black bean slider as well as the garlic lemon chicken with pine nuts.  Every tapas item I have tried has delivered excellent taste."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE this restaurant.  The staff is always super friendly and always have had great service there.  The food is amazing, and their homemade lemonade is now something I crave all the time!  Fresh food at a great price!"}
{"text":"Pita Jungle is a fresh change from the fried food scenery. When I'm in the mood for something healthy and unique, I like to go to lunch at Pita Jungle. Getting there is not the hard part, it's deciding what to order! I love so many things on the menu including the chicken pita and tzatziki with hummus or a delicious salad. Also, the new potatoes are amazing!!!  I like how the staff is free to be themselves at work and don't have to dress in a uniform. The servers seem to be happy and able to walk around in their own stylish, comfortable clothes.   One downside, they don't have much in the way of a bar. I ordered a sangria and it was meh. So I'll stick to a nice tea or lemonade next time."}
{"text":"Delicious and healthy - I love to eat here for any reason! Recently, my coworkers and I have been to Pita Jungle for a slew of work-related celebrations. Everyone can find something that suits them on the menu and they even have yummy cocktails and a bar at this location. Hummus anyone? Yes, please! I'm a big fan of the tzatziki, the Philly Chicken Pita and Mahi Mahi with Pita Chips.    Tip - if you are dining in for lunch either get there early to avoid the lunch rush or opt for a later lunch. This place gets slammed and sometimes you have to wait for a table. No complaints from me though, I enjoy walking around admiring their local artists work on display."}
{"text":"I was hopeful walking into Pita Jungle tonight.  I figured it would be a great stop for a delicious vegetarian dinner.  I got a falafel pita and it wasnt great.  It was dry and bland.  There was absolutely NO cilantro in it, which was one of the reasons I ordered it, and there we're certainly no spices either.  It was slapped together, ingredients was missing and it was soooooooo unbelievably dry because there was barely any tahini. I had to put mustard and cayenne all over it to give it  some flavor.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"LOVE the cilantro jalapeno hummus dip with cuke slices.  One of my all-time faves, especially when wanting to eat light.  First time at this address and we sat outside with the cool wind and rain.."}
{"text":"Food is great and can't beat the price!! Make sure to check your order if you do take out. We always do takeout and ever time the order is wrong. After the 3rd time in a row of this happening we always check to make sure order is correct. Good thing we checked, was wrong again."}
{"text":"I like the healthy options Pita Jungle offers but this location is so poorly managed.  I ordered the Chicken Mediterranean Salad for dinner and received a salad with chunks of salmon.  I saw that salad sit on the counter a good 30 minutes before they brought it to me.  I also ordered the pepper hummus and it never came. I felt the need to sit outside because the the restaurant smelled like sewage.  I don't know if it was actual sewage or maybe just a dirty grease trap that hadn't been cleaned in a while.  It's unfortunate because the servers are quite friendly but the kitchen appears to be run by staff that pays no attention to food quality or customer care. When leaving the restaurant one of the kitchen staff was outside at the door on his cell phone, smoking.  I don't see myself returning to this location. It was a horrible disappointment."}
{"text":"Heard lots of rave reviews and finally had a chance to check it out. The name is deceptive. I figured it was a counter service wrap place. It is not.  It's a very nice, casual sit down place with a wide variety of choices ranging from fresh salads to pasta and flat bread pizzas to all variety of stuff inside pita.  I had the chicken shawarma pita with a side of falafel.  The pita was excellent.  I give the falafel 7/10 -- a little dry and salty.  But the overall vibe of the place was nice.  I would go back...next time for a delicious looking salad and flat bread pizza."}
{"text":"Love Pita Jungle.   This location is MUCH more relaxed then the Tempe location. We arrived at 12:30 on a Monday and got seated right away.   Ordered Seared Ahi Tuna salad -strawberry, pineapple, mango with sesame dressing YUM!!  It was amazing.  Girlfriend ordered black bean burger - Not my thing but she was happy.   Nice chill Pita Jungle -- Awesome."}
{"text":"I have to admit that I was very pleasantly surprised. I didn't expect to like the place let alone be happily handing them 4 stars.   Perhaps I am mis-informed, but - going in to this - my impression of Pita Jungle was that it was one of \"those\" health food type places. Nothing against the concept. Maybe shame on me, but I'm not going to gleefully decide to go to a place because it's healthy. Yeah, yeah, I know, the body is a temple and the fuel we put in it must respect that. Har! Just give me tasty food that fills the belly and doesn't drain the wallet and I'll be a happy man.  The meals were yummy. It was a business lunch, so no booze. The person I was with had the yellow fin tuna salad. HUGE portion of the most excellently prepared tuna atop \"healthy\" greens. I had the portobello mushroom burger. Excellently prepared to order. Great taste. And, oh, I guess it, too, was \"healthy\" because the menu said it was. Also HUGE.  Don't let your fear of \"healthy\" keep you away. And, in all fairness, while not inexpensive, it was fairly priced because the portions were ridiculously large."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant on Mill. The servers are great, and the menu is perfect with lots of healthy meal options. I definitely recommend this place to both salad and pita lovers."}
{"text":"Ordered a chicken lavash wrap with \"roasted tomato and onion\".  Onion was raw tomato was stale salad tomatoes barely lukewarm, and chicken was Not trimmed and had gobs of fat on it.  I'm still trying to get taste of raw onion from my mouth.  Cooking was lazy and sloppy.  Menu reads like some crazed millennial hipster rummaged through the dumpster of an ethnic foods store and randomly tossed things on a plate.   This is not \"Mediterranean food\" it's a \"fusion\" abomination.  Literally everything has raw onion on it.  Who the hell puts mashed GD potatoes in garlic sauce?  The quesadilla on the app menu literally made me laugh out loud reading the ingredients.  Also why the H would you put pico de gallo on hummus?  I know it's cilantro jalape√±o hummus, but some fusions weren't meant to be and this one certainly isn't.  Makes decent hummus watery and taste like raw onion.    Blech. Disgusting.  Terrible.  Will NEVER eat here again and will warn off friends and family to make sure they don't have to steam clean the taste of raw onion from their mouths."}
{"text":"The new location looks great! It was nice to see all the seasonal specials on their regular menu (which is HUGE compared to the other locations). They were super busy-looks like this will probably be a very busy location during the lunch rush. Staff was all very friendly and knowledgeable :) Off to a good start!"}
{"text":"I love Pita Jungle, and one mess up wouldn't ever affect me coming back. However, I was really disappointed after driving all the way back to the office to find out that my \"chicken curry salad - sub tofu\" was covered in chicken, and also missing my favorite part-the rice. :( The cashier took my order correctly-the ticket showed \"sub tofu\"... but either the cooks mixed up my order, or they just weren't paying attention. So after pushing the chicken aside (I don't eat meat), I was left with an $11 sad looking pile of lettuce carrots.... I worked at a different Pita Jungle for years, so I get that mistakes happen during the lunch rush, but I wish someone had noticed the error before they tied up the bag.. guess I should take a peek inside before I leave next time.  On another note, this location is usually super quick and delicious and the servers/cashiers are always friendly."}
{"text":"I have always enjoyed the food here in the past but this weekend they really dropped the ball.  Our parties food was brought out at different times. By the time the last person got their meal the first person was served. I also ordered the salmon special and they forgot half of the order. By the time brought the order everything was cold."}
{"text":"Yesterday, my girlfriend and I had a late lunch after going to the movies. Joshua, was our server. He was so attentive and friendly. We are regulars at pita jungle, and the food is always fresh and so flavorful. Joshua said at the shea location, they sometimes use as a \" test kitchen. He offered us some interesting fish dishes. I ate salmon with spinach, mushrooms and tomatoes, it was TO DIE FOR..keep up the good work, Joshua. Thank you, Pita Jungle."}
{"text":"I'm moved to write a limerick instead of a haiku...this time:)          We stopped at the Jungle at lunchtime,       The Hummus and Schwarma were both fine,       The food is all scrumptious,       The service is bumptious,       All in all, though, we had a good time:)  I just noticed that I wrote an entire limerick without a single reference to Nantucket...a first for me:)  A solid 4 stars:)"}
{"text":"I have never been disapppointed with anything I have gotten here. My favorite is the hummus trio with chicken. I ask for cucumbers instead of pita. Yum."}
{"text":"This Pita Jungle is close to my house, and I am very happy!  No more long drives to the east valley for my fix of cilantro jalapeno hummus.    The Glendale location is good sized and comfortable.  It doesn't have that artsy/indie feel of the Tempe location, but as long as my hummus tastes good I don't care.    Cilantro jalapeno hummus was excellent.  The Honey Pasta salad was the best I've ever had it.    My only concern was the service.  There seemed to be a lot of standing around, and it took my server a while to notice I was sitting there even though they weren't that busy when I got there.  She finally saw that I was not being helped and came over with an \"oh crap I totally ignored this customer\" look.   Oh well as long as the hummus is good.  I'm happy!"}
{"text":"The Ahwatukee location is much larger and louder at lunch.  Service was great.  I love the art on the walls.  I enjoyed my cilantro jalapeno hummus and grilled vegetables.  Always been a fan since I went to ASU and went to the Tempe location."}
{"text":"Every plate is designed to feed one Ork or three humans. Remember this as you enjoy your Americanized joke of a Middle Eastern dish."}
{"text":"Let me start off by stating that I love fresh food. The people here are, hmmm...unique? Nice, but weird in the \"I'm trying to be a hipster\" kinda way(I dunno). I like the happy hour food menu because I love eating a bunch of different foods in one sitting and the tapas are fairly priced and just enough. Now, if you're starving order whatever but if you're ordering something other than a wrap be prepared to eat enough to feed 4! Not the cheapest yet not overly priced either."}
{"text":"Not at all like the other locations. Pita was actually stale.  The chicken in the lavish was really bland.  Not like the other locations.   How can u call yourself Pita Jungle and serve stale pitas.  The location on Frank Lloyd Wright is much better .  Overall Meh."}
{"text":"This a great place to go if you like to eat healthy but need a family friendly environment with quick service at moderate prices. The kids meal is only 6 bucks and you get a veggie, carb, protein and some fruit. Perfectly balanced meal at appropriate serving sizes. This is also a fantastic choice for wine and tapas. Thier food tends to have a greek/mediteranian flare so it's not the best choice if you're a meat and potato type who really loves southern cooking. This is a great choice for those who like to eat light or want a hearty but healthy dish with some ethnic flare."}
{"text":"[4 stars for Ambiance 3ish for the food.]  While I am a big fan of the location and the ambiance I don't know that I was terribly impressed by the food. Of course not knowing what to choose I went for a combination they offered with Baba Ghanoush, tzatziki, tabbouleh, hummus, marinated green bean salad, falaffel and a couple of dolmas. Yeah a lot of food is what I was expecting and I received.   The plate was served with about 3-4 whole pitas. They were a bit dry and stiff. Maybe Al Hana has me spoiled. The baba was a bit bland and I was unimpressed but I did really enjoy the falaffel, tzatziki, and the hummus. The green beans were good and I also prefer my tabbouleh with a better balanced parsley to Bulgar ratio. This was about 85%+ parsley.   I took about half of what I was served home. I can see myself coming back here but now I am wiser about what I would order or not order again. I did enjoy the ambiance and the location is hard to beat when I am out looking for quick bite to eat."}
{"text":"Service is average at best. Seems like the place is always understaffed. Third time I've called in to place an order to go & I've been put on hold for 5+ minutes or there is no response."}
{"text":"Pita Jungle is a great spot! Dress-up, dress-down, come straight from a workout... no need to worry at Pita Jungle. The servers are laid back and the vibe is always good. The food is fantastic. You can try something new every time and won't be disappointed - there's something for everyone. Don't be scared by the \"healthy\" look to this place. Some of the best things are the Blue Nachos and the Four Cheese Quesidilla - yum! Plus the Mediterranean Salad is to die for. Portions are big enough to share so get a couple things and branch out."}
{"text":"Always so good, so fresh and great service. I have tried many menu items and they are always incredible. The Mediterranean Roasted Chicken Pita, Garlic Potatoes, Garlic Mushrooms and Caramelized Cauliflower with Tahini are my favorites. Plus, the art here is great, constantly changing and I'm pretty certain it is for sale. The furniture is so cute, the couch in the front adds to the welcoming atmosphere and not only is their staff good, but it seems like they are genuinely happy to work there. Plus, you can eat until you are full and feel good when you walk out ... even if you do indulge in the Carrot Cake. One of our favorites after our first 6 months in the city."}
{"text":"The garlic dip is really good. So is the lentil salad. They also have excellent non alcohol drinks. Angie was our or waitress/bartender. She is freindly and does a great job."}
{"text":"The food is good and the ambience is unique but the overall experience usually leaves me wondering why they just can't pull it all together. The staff is friendly but lax, which usually means that you'll have a great server who just isn't that attentive. Drinks go unfilled and if you ask for a side you may be done with your meal before it comes. If your not in a hurry and go to spend time sitting and chatting with friends you'll probably really enjoy yourself. The food selection is a bit limited for my liking but comes out well prepared and tasty."}
{"text":"Just about all the food on the menu is super tasty and seemingly healthy when compared to other dinner options. Sometimes service is a bit slow even when the restaurant is a very full but the staff is always friendly. Another big plus, they almost always let you substitute items on the menu and mix-and-match sides. Atmosphere is quaint and the rotating local artwork is always fun to look at."}
{"text":"I have been a HUGE fan of Pita Jungle since moving to Arizona 7 years ago.  Everything I have tried has been tasty, fresh, and reasonably priced.  Their hummus is incredible, especially the red bell pepper.  My husband likes the cilantro hummus better, and while it's also great, it's not red bell pepper hummus ;).  Every location we have been to has had great, attentive service, a laid back setting, and flavorful, affordable food.  However, I really want to give a special shout out to this location, particularly to Brenda, the general/event manager.  My husband and I got married this past March, and we looked in to several places around the Tempe area to hold our rehearsal dinner.  Several places want a ridiculous amount of money as a down payment, and don't offer a customizable menu that is set by the couple.  We called Pita Jungle and inquired to if they offer rehearsal dinner accommodations, and were told to set up a meeting with Brenda.  We are SO glad that we met with Brenda.  She was willing to work with us on whatever we wanted for our dinner.  We got to pick the entrees we wanted to offer our guests, what types of beverages (both alcoholic and non-alcoholic), appetizers, desserts - the works.  When we asked her about a down payment, she simply smiled and said that wasn't necessary.  WOW.  We immediately booked our reservation - for 45 guests.  When we arrived the day of the rehearsal dinner, not only was a part of the restaurant sectioned off for us, but Brenda and her staff had gone out of their way to decorate the tables with flowers and menus in our weddings colors, and they offered complimentary champagne to all of my of-age guests.  The service was top notch, food was amazing (all of our guests complimented it, and several of them were from out of town and had never been to Pita Jungle), and when we got our bill, we could not believe how cheap it was.  We were sure to tip well :)!  If you are looking for great food and great people, I cannot recommend Pita Jungle enough.  If I could give 10 stars, I would!"}
{"text":"Love Pita Jungle. The hummus with grilled chicken is excellent as a light meal to share or appetizer for the table. Never disappoints. Service is good depending on who you get. Some can't be bothered."}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant. I love mediterranean food. The only catch is parking. There are many food places in this plaza and I usually end up parking on a side street but it's worth it for the food. I take my clients here when they are in town."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS. This place is always so busy which is a good thing! My best friend and I always order the Med Chicken Salad. The lemon vinegrette is so refreshing! And of course the half off bottles of wine on Tuesday are enjoyable too ;)"}
{"text":"I was brought here while on a business trip by a coworker who highly recommended this place for lunch. I ordered the wood fired chicken entree along with an order of pita chips as an appetizer.   The chips were good. The large crunchy/chewy chips were good and I enjoyed them (3.5). The chicken dish arrived about 15 minutes after ordering. It was a large portion of food with diced tomatoes on top and wilted spinach and garlic mashed potatoes beneath the chicken and was very good (4). It was a full meal and I wouldn't hesitate to order it again.   Table service was good (3.5). Parking was available for no cost in the adjacent parking garage."}
{"text":"I'll give the food a 4 star but their service is HORRIBLE !!! They have messed Up my delivery 5 times !!! The staff are super snotty and unprofessional!!! It's way too busy and not enough to parking!"}
{"text":"Chicken pasta salad is amazing ! Everything is so delicious def recommend the chipotle chicken pizza"}
{"text":"After seeing a fellow Yelper's Caramelized Cauliflower dish, I was super anxious to try it.  I asked for extra tahini sauce and was given a large side order of it at no extra charge.  The cauliflower was very tasty, but I agree that it tastes even better when re-heated in my toaster oven the next day.  Yes, there's enough to either share or save 1/2 for another day. The seasoning and the tahini sauce make this dish awesome. I have returned for this dish, and it was even better the second time around.  Yum!  I've only ordered take-out thus far, so I'll update once I have a dine-in experience."}
{"text":"Food was the same quality I expect but this location needs cleaning bad! Seats were sticky and greasy...everywhere. The walls to the bathroom had food and smear on them. The ladies room was grosse. Again smear on the walls and yuckie sinks. Server was sub-par and served a broken glass to a customer next to us. And stared into space while we sat with our piled up dishes. Wont be back to this location."}
{"text":"Hello Pita Jungle, I was there today around 1351 hours. As I entered the facility a girl with long black short hair greeted me with a smile. Then I popped a squat at my table. As I looked around in the facility I noticed a lot of smiles. There was one in particular that I LOVED... I think his name was. The meal that I received from this facility was called the Chicken of the sun. The soup was a bit much. I almost passed away....... but overall the experience was smashing :) Anywhoo toodles."}
{"text":"So I'm under the wire a day before a road show event. I called pita jungle in chandler for an event in Gilbert and they hooked it up! Half a sandwich, Greek salad, mac&cheese, and a FRESH fruit salad for 40 or so people. This was they're first time doing a box lunch and they were so awesome and friendly the entire time. Thank you Pita Jungle my merchants loved the spread, we will def be using you in the Fall!"}
{"text":"Love this place, I live for their cauliflower with tahini dressing!!!  Also my kids love the food too, not just another restaurant with junk for a kids menu"}
{"text":"I love the food but consistently disapointed by the service. I go here when I want to be left alone....bc I know I will be.  Food is always yummy!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite healthy eating place. Staff is friendly, laid back, the food is delicious and the iced teas are refreshing."}
{"text":"Simple. Black bean burger. Yes. Jalape√±o hummus. Absolutely Beer. I'm there. Good prices. Done and done!"}
{"text":"Whoever came up with these recipes should *not* be working anyplace called Pita Jungle.  In Cincinnati, this chef could be competing with Jean-Robert Pigall, who owns & chefs the best restaurants in town.  That name filled me with visions of cafeteria lines and make-it-yourself salad bars with a few piles of thin pita, maybe some stuffed tigers & pythons & fake vines hanging down.  And it didn't help that this location is in a strip mall.    On the inside, Pita Jungle looks better than it sounds.  It's a pleasant, high-ceilinged, box-shaped space, lit for dates (at least in the evening).  The art on the walls was daring and interesting, and apparently changes regularly.    The first surprise was the wine.  They had Sauv Blanc from Marlborough and other hard-to-find gems.  (\"Pita Jungle?\")  We ordered the Mediterranean platter as an appetizer, with a side of some garlic cilantro hummus.  When it arrived, I tasted it & a few of us agreed that the chef must specialize in Mediterranean food. It was the best falafel & the yummiest dolmate I had ever had!    Then the rest of the food (Italian mostly) arrived, at which point we became confused.  The chef didn't *just* do Mediterranean.  Why was Pita Jungle's food so amazing?  Nobody wanted to share entrees.  We did, however, share an enormous plate of pistachio ice cream-covered baklava, by which time we were laughing at our own astonishment.  The ice cream tasted like real, roasted pistachios.  It was even a tiny bit salty!  And it was topped with fresh cut strawberries that drew out a totally different taste.    Amazingly, this place is *priced* like something called \"Pita Jungle!!\"  You *could* take the kids!  But don't -- it's a great date place."}
{"text":"I love the food but the service was not the best. I thought it would be, as they seated us right away and brought us drinks. Then the server took quite some time to take our order. It wasn't really busy as the lunch crowd had left, but he never checked back with us for drinks or anything else. I had to hunt him down for a box to go. The food was as good as expected. My favorite here is always the broiled chicken salad. It's always light and fresh with awesome chicken. Guava. Lemonade is always great although this one was a little strong. Hummus great as always!"}
{"text":"Great place for a weekday lunch...  large portions will almost always give you a take home meal for dinner or for someone you love!!"}
{"text":"As soon as the sign went up for a Pita Jungle in the neighborhood I started to salivate.  The new place is nicely designed and very comfortable inside.  They've assembled a friendly, efficient staff and the food, as always for Pita Jungle is yummy and affordably priced.  They have my favorite hummus in town.  And now that I have Pita Jungle within walking distance I know it'll be a new regular spot for lunch and dinner!  And they make it so easy to place a to go order!  Tia at the register was working her tail off and smiling and providing awesome service to what seemed like a never ending line of customers - but that line moved so fast!! 5 stars for food.  5 Stars for service!!"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times.  While I do enjoy it for a few select items, I can't give it a higher rating.    Let me start by saying I really like their hummus, baba ganoosh, and dolmades.  My favorite main dish by far is the philly steak pita.  I haven't had the chicken version, but if it is done the same way it's probably good.  I also have a friend who loves the Mediterranean roasted chicken.  I have had no problems with service, and the place is always clean and bright.  Also, baby-friendly.  I have an under-one year old and there is plenty of room to park a stroller if you bring one.  This is a big plus for me.  On the down side, I have not liked any pita I've had other than the philly steak pita so far.  The falafel was sandpaper-dry, the Mediterranean tuna was also very dry and mostly tasteless though it was a very large serving. The gyro...you guessed it...also very dry!  I'm not sure what they're doing to their food to make it all so dry, but I wish they'd stop.  Their iced chai also tasted like milk, which was very disappointing since I love chai.  I will continue to go back because their starters are very good, and I know there is at least one regular item that I like.  I'll have to try the chicken dishes soon."}
{"text":"I am a fan of the food ( especially the nachos!) I enjoy the fresh tasting food BUT know that the customer service at this place is definitely not up to par- the waiters & waitresses (I've had both) are not friendly nor personable...  Great portions and fair prices - I go for the tasty food but not the service...it's  sad, but the poor service is almost expected (from experience) at this point."}
{"text":"Not good for takeout ... so disappointed ! I'm normally a fan of this place when we go ( mainly the Ray and Dobson location ) but today I ordered takeout and was soo disappointed .  My chicken shawarma wrap was cold ( you can tell it was never even heated ( just thrown together like slop .... I would've appreciated if they would have at least microwaved the \"hot wrap -- mainly the unfresh chicken ).  I also ordered a kids Mac and cheese and received A tiny handful of Mac and cheese - over cooked , soggy, and old br√≥coli - And dry chicken ...even my kids refused to eat it !   My advice would be to make sure dine in so that your able to at least view your food - I wouldn't recommend this place for take out . Maybe other locations at best"}
{"text":"I love the food at the Pita Jungle. My favorite is the Ahi Tuna and Hummus appetizer. I agree with another review that the waitress seemed overly anxious and stressed. She kept forgetting us a little too often as well. But overall good food and ok service. The pitas were stale. It seems hit or miss with their pitas. But when they are not stale, they are amazing! The patio is very enjoyable but I think there were a few non-service dogs on it."}
{"text":"This is the most surreal experience I've ever had at a restaurant. I don't mean that in a good way, but in an \"is this really that bad?\" Twilight Zone kind of way. When we got there, we were considering going to Valle Luna which was next door, and we should have. We didn't make the right decision, and our noses were rubbed in that poor decision for approximately two hours.  We had a party of 6; three adults and 3 kids ranging from age 9 to 16. Four ordered sodas, but ended up with water because the soda machine was an enigma to the staff, and they could not figure out how to switch out empty to full. We ordered our food- 30 mins later I looked around the restaurant and NO ONE had food. It was bizarre. We decided to just try to pay for our drinks then go to the Mexican place next door, but the manager said that our stuff was almost done.  Everyone else there got their food at the same time and of course ours was last. My friend ordered a salmon burger- they were out of salmon burgers. She ended up ordering the salmon over potatoes or rice or something and she said it was good. My kids ordered the kids meals which they were not happy with due to being terribly bland, and the 16 year old got a pita that she liked. My husband got a Philly cheesesteak pita and he always gets the same thing, so no complaint there. I ordered the gyro bowl,(no pita), and it was good, except the extra avocado never made it to the plate but I was charged for it. When I first got it, it was cold, and I sent it back. It was then brought out on a hot plate but the food was still cold, and the hot plate was stacked on top of the original plate lol. At this point the experience was just unreal so I stopped expecting it to get better. It was like people who really didn't care about anything worked there or something. At one point my husband got sick of waiting for the Sriracha that he asked for so he went and got it himself. In the end, we were comped two desserts, which were very delicious, the soda machines were enabled again, and the kids got their sodas. They also gave us a couple of $10 gift cards which we used. I'm glad they realized how super crappy the whole time was. Two stars for that. We were there for a very long time and I felt like the old woman on the titanic when she says \"it's been 80 years...\" because that's how long it took for this place to get it together and get us our food tonight. I think that I don't ever feel like going back to pita jungle again, I have an aversion to it now. Kinda like that time I got super drunk on Absolute Citron when I was 18 and couldn't stand the smell of lemony things for about 15 years."}
{"text":"First time here and I already want to go back! Delicious hummus and loved all the starters. The vibe is really fun and they have chalk artwork all around the restaurant. Great service and want to try all the hummus on the menu!"}
{"text":"I always get take out from here when I am working.  Sometimes they are a bit slow with my order, but I figure it is because there are a lot of orders at lunch time.  Friendly staff and good healthy food.  I enjoy this place at least once a week."}
{"text":"Outstanding service and the food is always delicious. Mike the general manager is absolutely the best and knows how to take care of his clientele."}
{"text":"Wonderful little find while venturing out and exploring! Delicious food, wonderful service and great prices!"}
{"text":"I ordered to go. The girl behind the bar was fast and friendly to help me out. I ordered, went next door for an ice cream, and it was waiting for me when I got back. The food was great and I'd like to come back to dine in next time. They have a pretty good looking menu for the basic healthy or unhealthy meal choices. Hopefully the service is just as good next time too."}
{"text":"My favorite dish is the pesto pizza! The customer service is friendly and the food comes out in a reasonable time. I love the vibe at this restaurant!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love pita jungle the service is always pleasant and the waiters are so helpful and educated on the food and menu. The food is amazing! Always fresh and tasty. Iv been to three different locations and I'd say I'm very happy with all iv been to. If your coming for lunch I'd suggest getting here a bit before noon or call for take away because they get busy! Also prices can run a little high but definitely worth the treat :)"}
{"text":"Came here once after a grad school interview and the food was excellent! Same can be said about the service.   Their happy hours are awesomely cheap with $2 margaritas, and $2-3 snacks like hummus and pita, stuffed grape leaves, etc. Being a so-cal resident, I am definitely not used to these prices!  I got the philly cheese steak pita, bf got the gyro, and our friend got the steak on a bed of hummus dish (can't remember what it was called but he really liked it). Everything tasted great and they have a large menu to choose from.   I was really digging the vibe of this place, had a lot of energy and diverse crowd (students, families, businessmen) and waitresses were nice. It gets packed fast though, sounds like there is a wait most nights.   If you're ever in the area, check this place out!"}
{"text":"I went on a Sunday night with my wife and daughter.  We were seated immediately and we're promptly served our drinks.  Shortly after our order was taken and food delivered.  I had the macro platter which was delucious.  My wife had the f√™toosh salad which she really enjoyed.  My daughter had the chicken schawarma wrap which was a little dry.  The waiter promptly brought some yougurt sauce which made the wrap better.  The seating was a little cramped on one side and there was a cold blast that came through our table when the door was opened.  Overall the food and service was very good."}
{"text":"I went here a few weeks ago on a Friday night with my boyfriend.  It was pretty packed.  I am almost 27 and I seemed to be on the younger side of the crowd, unless people just dress more mature than I was.  For an appetizer we got these amazing nachos that were enough for like 5-6 people.  For my meal I kept it simple and got the falafel pita.  It was very good, but I didn't like the kind of pickles used.  My boyfriend got one of the grilled chicken pitas and he loved it.  It was a little overwhelming with all of the lettuce in the pita.  I didn't get lettuce in mine.  The prices were very reasonable, but the wine was more expensive than what we ate.  It was hard to find a glass of wine that sounded yum under $7/glass.  I would definitely go back, but would probably get a beer instead."}
{"text":"Can't give it 5 stars because I've had a couple poor service experiences here (of 100+ times dining), but PJ is one of my very favorite local restaurants. Can be crowded, at which point the level of service will go down...as with pretty much all awesome, affordable restaurants? Don't know why people would put \"crowded\" as such a downside. Other people want to eat here too. Call in your order, you goons.  Super casual atmosphere compared with a lot of Arcadia-area business lunch type places, but the food is absolutely top notch.  The quality of the meals here is almost unparalleled for the price. My favorites are mahi-mahi with pita chips, hummus trio with chicken, lentil fetoosh salad, and the lavosh shwarma wrap. I substitute veggies on some of these and they always get it right.  Also possibly the best iced tea in town. And they always give me a to-go cup."}
{"text":"It's been a few years since I've eaten at a Pita Jungle.  I use to love this place and now I'm at a loss.  This new location has lost the charm of the other spots.  The decor is so all over the place.  The food came out so fast and was bland.  I had the shwarma with a bowl of beans.  The beans had no seasoning and the pita was mushy.  Very disappointed.  It's sad when the best part of the meal was the iced green tea."}
{"text":"Now that I can only have Pita Jungle when I visit AZ my appreciation has heightened. Favorites cilantro jalape√±o hummus and wood fire vegetable salad. They have a n amazing food and beverage happy hour during the week."}
{"text":"I am reviewing this Arcadia Pita Jungle while anticipating the newest location opening downtown at 3rd and Roosevelt by Lola Coffee sometime very soon I hear.  But also b/c I just ate at PJ today for lunch and realized I have never yelped it, how odd.  I like it, I don't LOOOOVE it like some people do and that's okay--- considering, I have only had salads here it's hard to really fall in love with a place when all you've had are salads.  The wraps and other items on the menus look delish, I really need to branch out more.  Today's menu was the salmon salad, it was really good and really big, glad I ordered it b/c I was hungry.   My only complaint is that it took really long for the bill to get to our table which normally doesn't bother me but when you need to hurry back to work, it can be annoying.  The staff are friendly, I was thrown back by our server though b/c she was dressed like heading out to a brunch with her gal pals and was wearing a fedora so when she walked up to our table and asked what we wanted to drink,  I was hesitant to tell her b/c I thought she was just a nosy diner.  haha.  All in all, I'm a fan.   Seating is a bit tight, but not to worry if you go before noon.  The minute we sat down at 11:55, there was a line forming out the door for a table."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today. Service was quick, my gyro tasted great, and my server Ann Marie rocked! Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"This is the Pita Jungle closest to me, so I go to this location above all others. This place had me at the cool vibe when you walk in the door. LOVE the artwork as well. I like going there for dinner, the low lighting is nice. Hell, I'd go there any time of the day really.  I usually try something new every time I go. I'm not a fan of hummus, which I know is blasphemy to someone who loves that places like this.. yadda yadda whatever.   I love the woodfire pizzas, the pita crisps, and the spanokapita!! Be warned, I dont think their pizzas are meant for only 1 person. Every time I order it I end up taking half home with me.  Its a nice, laid back place to eat inexpensively and healthy!"}
{"text":"So amazing !! We love to go for the tapas menu ! We got Garlic dip ( highly recommended ) chicken with pine nuts mushrooms and pita bread! Everything is only 1-2$ !"}
{"text":"I love Pita Jungle and this is my preferred location. It's a place where you can eat relatively healthy; although, if you're really into nutrition like me, you'll find a lot of their messaging misleading.   They recently added the Lavosh Veggie Wrap onto the menu, rather than an occasional special. This is the best thing.   The Jalape√±o Cilantro Hummus is amazing, and the best of that flavoring I've ever had outside of making it myself. Add some ahi and make it a meal. (Farmed fish, though)   If you are wanting to indulge a little more, the Four-Cheese Spinach Quesadilla (also lavosh, yum!) is absolutely delicious.   Staff are always friendly. Sit outside when the weather is nice.   Great happy hour options, as well."}
{"text":"My husband and I have regularly visited Pita Jungle for the past ten years. When we moved to this area we weren't sure about this location. The first few times the service was underwhelming and we weren't crazy about the new menu changes.   Lately service has stepped it up and the to go staff is awesome. I love the new chicken avocado tostada. Fruit and cheese fantasia is always a staple. My husband was happy they could still make a medchilada even though it was on the old menu.   Note: they have one of the best happy hours!!! I easily make a meal out of their tapas selection."}
{"text":"Ive been to this Pital Jungle many times. Each time, I get great GREAT service. I eat  a little fish, but mostly vegetables. I can't think of another group of restaurants that cater so greatly to that demographic.   But, if I were to be honest, EVERYthing on the menu isn't great.  My husband.. who is stricktly meat and potatoes, isn't a fan of PJ. It's like the meat options lack something for him.   For a year, I only ordered the Mahi Mahi special. I think that dish, is amazing. That Jalapeno hummus is like crack! I love every moment of eating it. Couple that with some decently cooked grilled fish.. and pita chips... and SALSA.. well I am in heaven. lol   A couple of weeks ago I decided to get the black bean burger. It's good. But, I think I ordered it twice because it really does have the potential to be outstanding!  Here's the problem: 1) It's messy .. BUT most things delicious are, so you look past that  because it's on a  fantastic bun... with hummus.. except 2) it's kind of dry. Like the hummus and the bean burger makes it dryer than it should be.. it's missing a good BBQ or some sort of sauce and 3) some grilled veggies on top like mushrooms or something would have been nice.  But the potatoes  that come on the side area also friggin amazing.. so knowing me.. I will order the burger again and doctor it up a bit.   Like I said, its a greatly made (and large) veggie burger.. it's just missing the extra to make it outstanding.  Other than that one must seriously try:   The Jalapeno Hummus The Ahi Tuna and Hummus.. lol   Oh .. and did I mention there is crack in the hummus??"}
{"text":"Went here today. It's very clean and the server was very friendly. However, I noticed the portions are smaller than other Pita Jungle's I have been to. Food was still great, but I will probably be sticking with my local one!"}
{"text":"I've been to this Pita Jungle several times; however, this time was different. When I got there, the host seemed to leave his post and everyone looked at me, but no one came over to greet me. I finally was, and the wait only took about five minutes. When our waitress got to us, she seemed very inexperienced. She didn't know any of the draft beers or wines or much about the food. We ordered the cilantro jalape√±o hummus and avocado hummus for appetizer--as always, delicious! We ordered a lot of different food, and the food quality, as always, was exceptional. This location in particular does great on portion sizes--much larger than other Pita Jungle locations. During dinner, our waitress never came by to ask how our food was or to refill our drinks. We had to ask another waiter for drink refills. I left feeling disappointed. Overall, the restaurant is very clean and the food is delicious. Unfortunately, the customer service seems to be lacking here."}
{"text":"Flew in from New York with 3 hr time zone difference - just needed something simple and lite to eat as everyone was exhausted. Pita jungle happy hour from 4-6 was perfect fit...appetizers and samples from $1-$5. $1 end was versions dips to $$3 sliders and $5 four slice personal pizza ( the spinach pesto was awesome). Others dined off full menu and everything being served was highly fresh ingredients and large portions. Plenty of seats so no wait. Little disappointed it was in an unattractive shopping plaza but the inside had nice decor of local art. Try the chicken sided, feta cheese dish and spinal chicken pesto pizza...won't disappoint."}
{"text":"Flew in from NY with 3 hr time zone difference; just needed something healthy to then address the exhaustion. Found extensive happy hour menu and convenience of being 1 mile from Marriott. Amazing restaurant, not that the art was satisfying the hunger but nice atmosphere with local artistry. Menu had extensive list with prices ALL from $1.00 to $5.00 - was perfect to order tapas and sample dinner menu. Enjoyed everything we ate - entire bill for 4 people came to $50! No surprise the place was jam packed"}
{"text":"We will never go here again. It was our first time going and we couldn't tell who worked there and who didnt. The workers were all standing around as if they were at a college kick back. The guys were wearing basketball shorts and had hickies on their necks and were on their phones.  The food was nothing to brag about at all! It is completely overpriced and not worth the money you pay for what you get. We will never return."}
{"text":"Let's get the ugly part out of the way first: The staff simply creeped me out with their questionable ways (includes demeanor, attire, and attitude).  Besides that, I loved it. I ate here three times, drunk all three times. It was a business trip; give me a break. The food is authentic and reasonably priced. Worth mentioning is the side dish of choice, garlic mashed potatoes. They even have some relatively obscure beers, which makes me happy. It was clearly worth my repeated patronage."}
{"text":"Love love love Pita Jungle and was waiting a long time for this one to open up (very close to the house). Food is awesome (like in the other locations) and it has all of the regular Pita Jungle menu items. Love the decor and how it is arranged. Even though we expected some hiccups with them being new, the service and food were flawless."}
{"text":"The manager stopped by to talk to us and make recommendations and was overall a very pleasant individual.  Our waitress Olivia was great as well - we didn't wait to have refills and our food was prompt.  Now for the food: I had the curry soup and it was amazing!  My only sadness is that I got a cup and not a bowl.  The hummus and gyros we had were amazing.  This place definitely earns it's 5 stars.  Keep it up!"}
{"text":"I am a meat lover, but I had their portobello mushroom sandwich and it was wonderful! We've been to this place several times but it's really best when you go during their happy hour and try the great small tapas they offer for only 2 or 3 bucks."}
{"text":"I didn't think this place was that great, but probably because I have such great Greek places in San Diego that I'm used to so that I wasn't impressed with this place. The food was pretty expensive for what you get but I guess that's what you would expect from a mall food court. I got the Mediterranean chicken salad without the raisins (ew yuck raisins in salad) and didn't really think much of it. It wasn't really that flavorful so I guess the dressing could do some work. The salad was really big though and I couldn't finish it all. It had tomatoes, onions, corn, parsley, cheese, and chicken. I really think that the salad could do without the parsley and would probably taste a lot better with cilantro, but that may just be my bias love of cilantro :P. Since the flavor wasn't doing much for me I got some of the hot sauce they had and mixed it in with the salad and after that then it actually tasted a lot better. Even after the hot sauce I wasn't able to finish the salad so I brought it home to eat later. Usually I don't think it's a good idea to bring home salad because it usually gets all soggy and gross, but for some reason this salad was oh kay when I ate it later that night. I actually thought it was better when I ate it later that night for some reason. Maybe the salad absorbed more of the dressing? Or maybe because there was less parsley in it? But either way, I finished it later that night and it did taste better. Overall though if I had to chose a place to eat I wouldn't chose this place again."}
{"text":"Got here while the band on a Thursday Night was still playing, got seated, placed order for an ice tea and......  Game Over? Waitress never came back? WTF? I guess my 6'-2\" 208# frame just got lost in all the excitement this evening. Or maybe my waitress just sucked. Either way, a bad experience which is a shame because usually the PJ is better than that. I placed my order via the phone and decided to take out instead. No apologizes offered. Won't be coming back to this one anytime soon."}
{"text":"I've never written a review before (like most people) but I felt I needed to in this case. I've been a Pita Jungle fan for a long, long time, but I have to admit that this location in Gilbert tops the other locations in the valley by a factor or 10^10 power.   Other locations come off rather stiff or snobbish, but the good folks at Gilbert are doing their very best in these very trying economical times to make you feel welcomed.  The owners and staff are having FUN at their jobs and you can really feel that excitement as you enter their fine establishment.  Monday nights are Piano Night and more music is planned for in the future.   It's about the food, service and smiles that I rate this place the highest possible.  Closing time is usually a busy time for them, but they ALWAYS handle those last minute stragglers with respect and compassion.  This facility is certainly feeding off the energy of their owners/managers and everyone there shares that same drive and compassion.  After a while, you feel like family there.   And yes, they even know my name when I come in on any late night raid.   Try this place people! You won't be disappointed!   Rant Out!"}
{"text":"This is the first time I've done a review prior to my food being served but the service here is just awful, and 1/4 of the tables are sitting here dirty. I see 3 waitresses buzzing around but they don't appear to be doing anything. Several people have had to get up to give their bill to someone so they could pay. I sure hope the food is worth it."}
{"text":"Ordered gyros to go on a Monday at 1045am and place was quite and gearing up for lunch. Took 10 min to get gyros...not very fast and not super slow.  Got no extra tzatziki which most places throw in for free and didn't have any napkins...so check your orders!  It was a salty gyros. Meat was OVER salted the veggies were fresh enough. The guros isn't that great of a monetary deal. No lunch special for gyros which was surprising and disappointing! So has far as the Gyro goes you can get better tasting and better lunch deals at other nearby locations. Sorry PJ not goig back."}
{"text":"I went during their happy hour time and got to try a lot of cool new items! Although the sizes are a lot smaller, they are totally worth it for the prices! I loved the hummus platter, with three hummus options. Definitely worth trying out!"}
{"text":"The hummus is soo delish, I am loving the cilantro jalape√±o flavor lately the most but they are all great !! everything is always so fresh"}
{"text":"Decided to check out the new location, since we are regulars at the other one in Mesa. So glad we did! Great service, and the food came out quickly. It seemed there was more of a team atmosphere between the service staff than at the other ones, which was nice. Food came out quickly and exactly as we ordered it! It is a little smaller than some of their other locations, but has a great patio for outdoor seating! We will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Location is set at the back end of the parking lot - west on Tatum. They have the best iced tea by far!   It is always fresh tasting! I inquired as to what type of tea it was- and they do purchase it locally - it's called Passport Coffee and Tea located in Scottsdale.  I had the chicken and hummus with extra cucumbers on the side which is always a good pick. Service is always consistently good."}
{"text":"I decided to try Pita Jungle for dinner with a friend one evening. I was initially really unsure because it's not anything close to my normal cuisine, but I figured, why not try something new?   I'm really glad I gave it a shot! My salmon was great and the pineapple margarita was definitely worth going back for. I also tried their jalapeno hummus and have nothing but good things to say about it. I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Love their iced teas and salads! Hummus and pita are great too. Healthy and reasonably priced. They have several tasty choices of unsweetened iced tea"}
{"text":"I really appreciate that this place posts their nutrition information on their website. That being said, some of their \"healthy\" items like salads have way too many calories for food that aims at being healthier. Still, it's tasty and their iced teas are the best. Just be careful if you're watching calories. Some of the items are deceiving."}
{"text":"This place is always packed.  Even though it's kind of hidden and not close to Desert Ridge, it will be packed.  The food is sort of hit or miss. It's mostly healthy, which is good.  But sometimes it can be kind of dry and plain.  The hummus is definitely tasty but some of the pitas lack in flavor compared to say, King Gyro.  Service is usually good and the prices are reasonable.  I would say if you are on  a diet or just in the mood for some healthy eating- this is definitely a good place to go."}
{"text":"Pita Jungle is delish and this location is no exception. I came here with a large party (10+) and they accommodated us well and gave us great service. I had the chicken tikka masala, which was unlike the typical version of this dish, but absolutely delicious topped with pea shoots. The portion was giant, I took a big container of it home. I also got to try one of the flatbreads, which was spicy and fresh tasting, a variety of tasty hummuses (hummi?), and the dolmades. Everything was good. Definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"I went to this location the other day for a quick (and cheap) late ish night dinner. The food was delicious.... the service was terrible! I ordered the grilled chicken with hummus appetizer and got it was the garlic dip and the cilantro and jalapeno hummus. This is so wonderful... I love the different kinds of dip and the chicken is really flavorful, plus they give you a ton of food, so I took half home for another day. The BF got the beef gyro.... it was a little weird. The beef is all thin sliced and kind of looks like Steakums or something. The flavor wasn't great.... they really should use chunks of beef or something. Anyway, the flavor was ok, not great but not bad. The real problem was the service. We were seated and then sat there with no service for about 10 minutes. Finally, someone came around to take our drink and food order. He was friendly enough, but he didn't give us any silverware or napkins and he didn't come around and fill our waters at all. I thought this really put a damper on the experience. Of course, I will come back because this place is close, cheap, and tasty... but next time I will get it to go."}
{"text":"I went here yesterday with some friends and we all liked it. We all shared an order of half garlic spread and half roasted red pepper hummus. Both were really good, although now I feel like I can't wash the garlic smell off of my skin, but worth it I guess. I got the chicken pita and it was flavorful. I don't think this place is any better or worse than other places like it, but It's convenient to me and it was pretty good. I'd go again."}
{"text":"I didn't realize there was a Pita Jungle in Fashion Square... I was so happy when I saw it! The BF and I really just wanted a snack, so we to the garlic dip. The girl behind the counter was miserable and looked really mad that she was working. So not such good service, but the garlic dip, like usual, was delicious! I think they should probably give you at least 2 pitas with the dip.... but whatever. Also, the pita at this location didn't taste the same as what I remembered having at the sit down location."}
{"text":"You can never go wrong with Pita Jungle! These restaurants offer a wide variety of quality and delicious foods for reasonable prices. Some of my favorite items are the chicken pasta salad, gyro, falafel, and the baklava for desert. But seriously, anything is good from this place."}
{"text":"I can't believe I lived right near this Pita Jungle for so long and never went. This location is large, much larger than it looks from the outside. The decor is modern. The food is the same delicious pita jungle food that you can get at other locations including that ridiculously yummy jalapeno cilantro hummus. The one thing that was better at this location than others was the service. Usually, the workers of pita jungle are not the friendliest of people, but not so at this location! Definitely a plus. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Brace yourself the location is like a Olive & Ivy wannabe less hotter version. Sam Fox designs, let's just pretend doesn't really exist.   So in my mind I'm already annoyed the cool, chill, neighborhood vibe is being strayed from. No TV's? What idiot decided to strip revenue from a centrally located restaurant by not having TV's? Or maybe funds are low. So many times I've begged friends to go and they resisted due to the lack of TV's.  So...with that said I started going for lunch at the bar area by myself. A guy named Rob works the bar area. I was skeptical of this new location. However, Rob and his style of service reminds me of the other locations and the vibe I'm used to. Friendly, helpful and eager to make sure you have what you need. I can't lie. I come in often to eat lunch here, however, if Rob isn't working. No thank you. Give this location a try preferably when Rob works."}
{"text":"Man I wish I was cool enough to work at Pita Jungle. Here we go....really good food, service...needs serious help. I have been to 3 Pita Jungle locations, and every location, same story. They hire only one type of person. The art school drop out that thinks they are so cool they shouldn't have to get you drinks. It's such a shame. The food is really good and semi healthy, however the staff is such a buzz kill.  My last visit, my waiter was either stoned or drunk, i couldn't tell. He looked annoyed he even had to say hi let alone attempt to get our order right. After F* up our order twice, he sat in the corner gabbing with another server about how hungover he was and couldn't wait to be off.  My girlfriend spent several minutes trying to flag someone down for our check, but no one could be bothered. I guess when you have drinking stories to share--who cares about getting paid? If they would hire new staff and adopt the mantra \"care about our customers\" then maybe I would go back..."}
{"text":"I came in for lunch today (8/31) and had great service! The waitress was very attentive and the manager was very sweet.  The manager came over to see how everything was and made my children feel apart of our conversation. She asked them about their food and you could see how great that made them feel. It's nice to see a manger stop by and check in with all of the tables. I think this location should be very happy they have such a sweet manager who makes sure your customers are happy."}
{"text":"This is Jacque Wright and I eat at Arcadia Pita Jungle all the time.  I certainly want to commend the staff and the food.  I also want to point out that this location as well as other store locations also offer art to view on the walls from our various artists in the art community.  This work is performed by Jason Savaglio, the art curator for all the Pita Jungles.  He does a great job of artist selections, placement, and displays on a monthly basis for all the stores.  I have met him and he is actually a school art teacher too.  I give kudos to Jason Savaglio for doing such a fine service and adding to our joy of art - you can view it and buy it too!  If you want to talk to Jason, ask for him at the Arcadia Pita Jungle and I'm sure they can get a message to him.  He is the greatest!! GOOD WORK AND JOB WELL DONE Award from me!"}
{"text":"Their carrot cake was much better than I was expecting. I love the cilantro jalape√±o hummus and pita. It's refreshing and fills ya up:) Stephanie was our waitress and was on top of it with everything. Our food came out literally within 5 minutes of us ordering. This place has great service and a nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Awesome food, reasonable prices. Take out is simple and quick. If you're trying to eat healthy this is the place to go."}
{"text":"UPDATED REVIEW:  The same day as my visit to Pita Jungle, I received a response from Kevin. He asked that I contact him and give him more information. He did indicate to me that lunch is absolutely served at this location at LUNCH time and that he would take some time to educate his employee on how brunch works. Kevin was very kind and considerate, and also promptly sent a free entree card, which I did use, right before my cross country move. When we walked in, we asked for lunch menus and I received my broiled chicken salad. Service was great.     With my current diet, I am limited on my food options, but Pita Jungle has always been a go to for me with their broiled chicken salad. Showed up and sat down, at 12:00, mind you, and noticed that we were only given brunch menus. After waiting for our waiter for a good five minutes, he shows up and we ask for lunch menus. He proceeds to tell us that they do not serve lunch until 2:30. Well... I like to eat lunch at a normal time. Not at dinner time. We decided to leave and the guy acted as if we had offended him by doing so. Shame because their lunch was spot on. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time with my husband and little girl!  The atmosphere was great! All the staff were really nice and attentive !  Food was 4 stars it's definitely not what you would get at your middle eastern moms house but the taste was good and yummy! I would def go back!"}
{"text":"I had the mahi mahi dinner with the hummus and spicy pita chips. The green hummus was very good, best part of the meal, but the mahi was meh, just ok. It didn't taste fresh, was a bit fishy. The pita chips have a weird red seasoning powder on them, which makes them gross. I asked for a plain pita and it was better. All in all, not a great meal for $12"}
{"text":"The reason for the two stars is the following: I ordered the grilled chicken with cilantro jalape√±o hummus. When I got there to pick up my order, someone came out of the kitchen and said they forgot to put salt in my hummus..I couldn't wait so I told them I would add salt to it. Next, the chicken was extremely dry, meh! The pitas were cold and not soft at all. Very disappointing lunch for $12. Can you put utensils in the to go bags, please? I may try it again, but not sure"}
{"text":"Easily the best experience I've had at Pita Jungle since they aggressively expanded. The space is open, inviting and tasteful, there are separate bar and dining rooms, and window seats make for a surprisingly romantic setting. I don't usually equate Pita Jungle with romance.   (Only layout criticism: The bathrooms are cozy, and not in a good way.)  The food was reliable as per usual (although the bread was a little stiff, which tends to be the case later in the day) but what set the Roosevelt location apart from PJs on 44th/Indian School and Scottsdale was the service. This girl had worked a long day (she recounted 15 and 20-top services she'd administered over the dinner rush) but her attitude was meadow fresh. (Sometimes I get a sense that PJ servers are allowed to be rough around the edges in an attempt to earn hipster cred but thankfully not here.)   I could eat the chicken and hummus plate with extra cucumber all day long and when I do I'll do it from this Roosevelt spot."}
{"text":"Just ate the spicy chicken wrap, which was hot, packed with veggies, and perfectly seasoned. The portion was huge, probably 20 percent bigger than a Chipotle burrito, and two meals for $7.99 is a tremendous value, especially given how comparitively healthy Pita Jungle's entrees are. Also, the take-out order was ready exactly when it was promised.  One harsh bit of criticism: Don't be cheap with the pocket bread; one piece rolled up in foil is totally insufficient for a 7-10 oz. tub of hummus. If you're ordering you have to request additional bread or you're going to have some lonely leftover hummus.  I haven't eaten in yet, but the atmosphere seems fun and diverse--everyone from shaggy haired hipsters to the Dockers-wearing crowd. And there's a bar, which is always helpful."}
{"text":"Great, healthy food.  Service is always good.  I always get the chicken plate with a side of hummus.  Add an IPA and it is super good."}
{"text":"One of the most consistent lunch spots in Chandler. I am literally obsessed by their hummus and chicken appetizer!!!"}
{"text":"This place is on the corner of 2 major streets down from the university campus.  There's zero parking so we had to find a parking lot and pay for parking.  There's an outside eating place and lots of room inside.  Went for lunch, got seated by the kitchen and waitstaff area so we could hear staff talking and laughing etc. Not so fun. They weren't that busy so there were other tables open.  Immediately our waiter came over with water and menus.  Lots of vegan and gluten-free items.  Chose the carmelized cauliflower to start and it was pretty good. For lunch I ordered the wood smoked salmon salad. Generous portion of salmon on a bed of fresh mixed greens and balsamic dressing.  So delicious!  Refills for our iced tea came before we had to ask so wait staff was pretty observant.  We didn't feel rushed and it was a pretty good experience."}
{"text":"Really nice menu and service!  Lots of veggie options, and gluten-free choices, too.  It can be crowded at lunch hour, but that's for a good reason--people like it!  Try after, say, 2:00pm and there won't be a wait.  Service is quick, and they change the wall art often enough to keep it interesting.  This will quickly become one of your favs.  MK"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite lunch choices on the healthy side but I think I'm going to have to refrain and find some new dishes. Holy inconsistent!!! I have mentioned this a few times  to the host and manager in front and placed extra instructions on a salad. It's just a salad! I will order with and get sometimes 4 maybe pieces of lettuce next time it will be full of lettuce no toppings another time all tubule no lettuce this time no lettuce and no dressings I can't keep up with the inconsistency I have tried and ordered it as simple and still can't figure it out it's clear it's not taught the same with all the cooks. Uber eats it again today had to drive back there to even get dressing and some lettuce manager on staff was not understanding met me with a very defensive manner and said that no one there is allowed to take ownership for a inconsistent meal they are directed to reach managers who clearly also don't care it was disappointing but I guess that's just the way a business is ran these days."}
{"text":"Great, vegetarian-friendly restaurant with lots of healthy options and great prices. I especially like the lentil fetoosh salad and the veggie garden wrap. Also, if you are in the mood to splurge, their nachos are out of this world.  All of their starters (hummus, etc) are delicious.  This is a great place to go with groups or on a low-key date.  Their service is always very friendly too!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious. Always good service and excellent food. Trevor is an awesome employee and cook."}
{"text":"Since this place is located in a strip mall I mistakenly assumed it was one of those places where you ordered at the counter and then grabbed a table.  I was a little bit surprised when I arrived and discovered it was more of a sit down casual restaurant.  I ended up getting take out so it didn't really matter in any case.  I ordered their hummus and tabbouleh pita. When they handed me my to-go bag I thought they had given me enough food to feed a small army...it seriously weighed several pounds.  I think I ended up making three meals out of it...and all three meals were delicious.  If I lived in Phoenix I would come here all the time."}
{"text":"I had good experiences at pita jungle before, but this last one was very upsetting and I will not be returning. I go into this location on happy hour and I select an item from the happy hour menu to order. I then ask about a second item with 3 hummuses and chicken in the center. The waitress says it is the \"Hummus Trio\" with chicken. Note I was looking at the happy hour menu with her and looked at the \"Hummus Trio\" listed for $1.50. I assume that it will be this price with an additional charge for the chicken....when I get my bill, the hummus plate was over $10. I ask for clarification, and the waitress apologizes saying that she thought I was talking about another dish. I tell her if i would have known it would cost $10+ for hummus, I would have ordered a wrap or an entree instead. She leaves with the bill and returns saying that the manager cannot do anything. This got me very upset but I needer to rush to work and didnt want to waste any more time. What upset me most was that the manager(s) did not even talk to me to try to resolve the problem. It was the waitress's mistake for misunderstanding my order. At the very least, the manager could have given me a gift card for another time, or something I can take home. This place shows NO CARE for customers. Will never go back"}
{"text":"I've been loving this restaurant for a hot minute now. Delicious vegetarians options. I absolutely adore the Coconut Curry soup! Recently discovered their incredible happy hour from 3-6p. Great drink specials and Tapas menu! Extra satisfied with that find.   For cocktails, I've tried the Mediterranean Mule and the Fuzzy Lemon. Both were well balanced, the mule was interesting with the almond flavor but surprisingly, I could've gone for a second. The Fuzzy Lemon was good too, a little sweeter than how I normally drink, but not bad for $6 on HH.   The non-alcoholic selection is great too with a couple of teas to choose from, including hibiscus tea. A variety of tea options is key for me at any restaurant  Tapas were simply perfect. Really can't go wrong with any option. I had a drink plus 3 tapas and soup for $22, definitely had leftovers. The soup here is my favorite, I can eat a bowl and ask for seconds.   The ambience and service at every location I've gone to has always been on point, even during busy  hours, the staff is always friendly! I've never had a bad time here!"}
{"text":"4 stars for the food, but they need to bring the strawberry kiwi tea back - the passion is not good."}
{"text":"I went to this Pita J and sat at the bar.  I liked watching all of the cooks bust their butts to get the food out.  But the waiters...yelling at the cooks and not saying please and thank you!  Putting their fingers and hands in and on top of the food that they are going to serve to customers... The money tip goes to the hard working cooks and not the waiters.  Wont be going to this Pita J again...maybe one of the other Pita J's will have a better attitude towards their cooks."}
{"text":"Finally made an account to write this. Went here with my boyfriend about two months ago and the waiter stole my debit card (or conveniently lost it within a 15 foot walk). Not sure how he thought that would work. I gave him my card and 2 minutes later he came back with an empty black booklet where the receipts and cards are kept. We looked everywhere. Called the manager over and she offered no help other than \"they'll call if they find it.\" No security tape look over. The waiter was blonde with glasses."}
{"text":"Pita Jungle is a go-to in the area for fast, fresh, delicous options for lunch. I know they have dinner too but I love the lunches here -they get you in, fed, and out the door in under an hour without fail.   Never had a bad meal, did the Falafel salad today and it was divine. They serve it with pita bread too so if you were craving a pita wrap, you can make one from your salad plate! The sandwiches are great, the salmon was wonderful the last time I was here.   All in all, this place cant be beat. The location is a little hard to get to being on the light rail route, but its worth it to get your fix. I always leave full and happy, but not too light in the wallet :)"}
{"text":"Another great experience at pita jungle! This was my first time at this particular location but the decor and vibes were consistent with all the other locations. I had the falafel salad which was just ok. Their falafel is amazing but the salad had pickles in it which was kind of odd. They have an amazing iced green tea and will even give you a big cup to go when you leave for your drink. The service was great and our waitress was fantastic. Will be back again since this location is just down the street!"}
{"text":"We came here for lunch on a Sunday. Located in the corner of Dana Park mall, this quaint little store has a trendy ambiance. There are plenty of tables set up for outside dining. This is good until the weather gets hot. We chose to eat inside. The grill area is open so you can actually watch your food being prepared. The seating is limited to several booths and about a dozen tables.  Our experience was pleasant. Our waitress was friendly and the service was prompt. Pita is what this place is all about. You get pitas with your salads or used as wraps in sandwiches. I ordered a pizza which was on, you guessed it, a pita. I was a little disappointed at the selection of burgers. they were \"healthy burgers\". All were veggie burgers of one kind or another. That's good for the vegetarian, but carnivores will be left wanting that juicy medium grilled 80/20 ground beef burger.  I will say that the pizza I ordered was surprisingly tasty. I got the roasted garlic portabella pizza. This was made on an ultra thin pita like crust, which made it very crispy once it's baked. This is my favorite style of crust. There was a modest amount of sauce and cheese, which was ok by me. After all for me it's about the toppings anyway. The toppings, roasted garlic, basil, Portabella mushrooms, and thinly sliced tomatoes. I enjoyed every bite, and it was under 10 bucks. You can't beat that at most places.   Now that I'm spoiled on this pita-pizza, I may not be able to get past that on the menu. I will try other items, but I want to experience the other pizzas first."}
{"text":"Love this place! The curry chicken salad is so yummy flavorful. It's a huge portion, Enough food for 2 meals! They generally don't prepare take out orders correctly, so make sure you check your food before you leave. Other than that, their food is consistently delicious!"}
{"text":"Been going to pita jungle for 20 years since on apache in Tempe. That said, seems growth is spreading themselves thin. Virtually every to go has had an issue, something forgotten or not done right but this last time, yesterday night was extra special.  Got chicken and hummus around 8pm to go, starting around 5 am I've been throwing up and well, use your imagination, outa both ends. Can't keep water in me. It's now 1 pm. I had food poisoning once before, seafood restaurant. I know the flu is going around but this is all stomach. Brutal.  I worked in restaurants for years at the director level. When someone calls experiencing food born illness there are generally a good amount of questions asked and follow up. All I got when calling was a \"thanks for letting us know\". I'm not looking for anything from them. Took me years to eat mussels again after last time. I'll be taking a long hiatus from pita jungle as well.  If anyone else was sick after eating on 7st on 12/22/17, you're not the only one."}
{"text":"Good food and cool looking location, however the service was underwhelming. My biggest complaint was that the restaurant was dirty, tables had food and trash under them like they hadn't been swept in days. The table tops were sticky and the salt and pepper shakers were covered in gunk. Not very appetizing."}
{"text":"Food was unique in bold variety of flavors. It was light, healthy, fresh, refreshing, and so delucious. My first time, won't be my last."}
{"text":"My order was SHAWARMA chicken!!! It's says PITA SHAWARMA CHICKEN but what I got was chicken in a an Arabic bread W.T.H If you don't know the different between Arabic bread and pita bread there is big big different  This was my second time there first one I thought maybe they are out of pita !! Big deal BUT now WHAT disappointed!!!!"}
{"text":"I'm a bit honest but here are my expectations. Arrive to restaurant, greeting by hostess, wait for table, arrive at table, be served, eat, pay, leave. Pita Jungle got the first parts right but we waited oh about 5-8 minutes for any of the 12 hipster servers to acknowledge that we hadn't been served yet, once we received a server he was hit and miss the rest of the way, had to ask for utensils, ask for refills and generally felt as we were breaking up their conversations. We eat out a lot and from all different levels of establishments, 10 table 20 table & chain so we expect what we deserve. The food was usual pita jungle,  not impressive. Date of service 8-22-15"}
{"text":"Eaten at multiple locations and always a great meal."}
{"text":"Me and my husband love this place. We recently move to AZ from NJ and we were told and actually seen on our own the lack of really good restaurants in AZ ( actually I should say lack of variety). And even though chains aren't my \" thing\" this restaurant is the exception. Their food is very fresh and healthy. I do must say that the  Gilbert location ( which is the only one I've visited) lacks good staff after 3pm, for some reason if we decide to grab a bite after that time we usually leave dissapointed. I don't know why but it has happen to us in several occasions. Otherwise I really like their food and prices are very fair"}
{"text":"We love coming here we especially love the nachos and their lemonade. What can I say we've become regulars here. I definitely recommend this place. The service is friendly and fast. You can always try something new each time you come."}
{"text":"Came to pick up some food today. Immediately the guy had some attitude. I kindly ask for extra napkins and was told that there's already napkins with the utensils. You know, that one small napkin that comes in those small packets with forks and knives. Anyway, the guy starts serving other guests behind me, handing food to them across my face. Very unprofessional. I wasn't even done signing the check. Handed about three  people their food across my face as I was getting my food and signing the check. Food will be cold from this place because hot and cold items are kept in the same plastic containers."}
{"text":"PITA JUNGLE!!!! This is the Chicken Curry Salad I know and LOVE! My and my hubby's all time favorite dish. It usually comes on a bed of lettuce but I always get without.  It comes with amazing deep fried pita strips, just enough to keep it healthy and also add fabulous flavor and texture. The crispy caramelized onions, grapes, raisins, and walnuts are all perfectly seasoned with curry powder. Anyone who has not tried this dish needs to!!!"}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of their hummus!  The best anywhere!  However, I always have to ask for extra pitas...  I always get the greek salad with chicken.  It's delicious!  And when they add the extra chicken, it's almost too much!  I guess I would rather there be too much chicken than not enough.  Service here has always been good.  I like the inside of this Pita Jungle a lot more than the other locations.  This one is much nicer inside with a nice bar area too."}
{"text":"I love Pita Jungle. I could eat here everyday, if it was possible. I love their pizzas and salads, but I am all about the cilantro-jalepeno hummus! I am obsessed. Whenever I am in AZ visiting, I make a point to stop by. Bonus: most of their food is healthy!"}
{"text":"Not sure what to expect, I was pleasantly surprised by the location, the food and good service. Sat on the back patio overlooking the waterfront.   Our appetizer Cilantro Jalapeno Hummus was absolutely delicious. I look forward to enjoying it again. Two friends ordered the Spicy Chicken Wrap.....it was HUGE....and very very spicy. I ordered the Lavosh Shawarma Wrap - it was ok, I added the hummus to the sandwich and enjoyed it more. Delicious greek salad.   So many other things on the menu that I'd love to try - Hummus w/Seared Ahi Tuna Roasted Red Pepper Hummus Falafel Platter Chicken Del Sol Yellowfin Tuna Honey Sesame Salad Black Bean Burger Glazed Chicken Lavosh Pizza"}
{"text":"I decided to have lunch today at Pita Jungle, since it has been quite some time since I have been here! As always I love the atmosphere of the place... very casual, all the staff is friendly and polite and the food is GREAT!!!   For some reason I have been craving Greek a lot lately so I took a chance on the Beef Gryo and it was pretty delicious but probly not the best thing on the menu. I am definitely excited to go back and try more new things."}
{"text":"WOW.  This places is incredible.  I can honestly say that everything on the menu is wonderful.  It's the perfect date place, since you can order booze to cure the date jitters.  Also, you can satisfy your dieting girlfriend and still order a big plate of \"man food\".  The best part about their menu is the fact that it is SO TASTY with being HEALTHY.  The extra care in picking ingredients, grilling/cooking with little fats, and unique spice combinations truly makes PJ stand out.  The decor's nod to local artists also helps make the dining room an enjoyable place to be.  For a perfect healthy and satisfying vegetarian lunch I recommend the following:  A small Greek salad with an order of the jalape√±o or roasted red pepper hummus (PS:  they'll let you order the hummus half and half!)"}

{"text":"Food was pretty good, service was HORRIBLE. I went to the Scottsdale location. There really isn't a space set aside for pick up and/or ordering. There's just an island with the servers' computers, and a bunch of patrons standing around confused. A disorganized MESS."}
{"text":"Pita Jungle is back to complete food perfection!  Try the passion fruit iced tea.  YUM!"}
{"text":"I have been a fan of Pita Jungle for 10 years. I keep going on a regular basis simply because it's good food. Their home made ice tea and lemonade make a great Arnold Palmer.  Their Moroccan Gazpacho is a seasonal item that I always get when it's on their special menu. It's just so refreshing and full of goodness."}
{"text":"Had lunch there today. Was looking for something Mediterranean...sorted by most reviewed and PJ was at the top. I was there shortly after Noon and they were busy but there was no wait. I sat at the bar and was promptly greeted and my drink request taken. I was on a mission for the yellow fin salad but switched to the Mahi Mahi with pita chips because it came with jalapeno & cilantro hummus. It was a great dish! I saw lots of healthy eating going on, lots of veggies and salads. The one thing that I noticed was the floor of the open kitchen was a disaster....they were busy and the kitchen was jamming so I can understand it to a degree. If you have an open kitchen I think alittle more effort to keep it presentable should be taken.  I'll go back to this or one of the other locations to get my Mediterranean fix."}
{"text":"I go here when I feel like eating something healthy. Yesterday I had the falafel salad which was very good and filling. It came with two pita's that I barely touched and didn't quite finish the salad either. The atmosphere is bright and clean. The aromas are mouth watering. I prefer this location to the other Ray Road one because its newer and cleaner."}
{"text":"Went to Pita Jungle for lunch.  Ordered a falafel sandwich.  The food was okay, but there are so many other wonderful Middle Eastern restaurants in the vicinity.  I would rather have gone somewhere else.  The food was not impressive for me, and I happen to enjoy Middle East/Lebanese style food.  If I was not there meeting someone, I would have gone to some other other Middle Eastern restaurant in Tempe located nearby."}
{"text":"Pita Jungle always has consistently good food.  It's healthy and fresh and the portion sizes are generous.  They are absolutely fabulous when it comes to customizing orders and making substitutions - something not many restaurants can boast!  I've never had anything there that I didn't like, and my favorites are the Chicken del Sol, the Grilled Chicken with Hummus, and the Chicken Combo Platter.  My only warning is to make sure you check your take out orders.  Twice when this location has been really busy my order has been incorrect.  Just sneak a peak at everything before you leave with it."}
{"text":"Pita Jungle is the best! They have delicious, healthy options. I love their veggie burger and hummus. It's a super restaurant with wonderful service!"}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant. My family and I came in for a light bite and it was perfect. Their happy hour is so perfect. They have delicious tapas for amazing deals. I had the hummus trio and 2 chipotle black bean sliders. My parents shared the Mediterranean Chicken Salad. It was made properly, with their specific modifications.  The food was fresh and healthy. Our server, Lisa, was very attentive and kind. We'll certainly be back. :)"}
{"text":"My entire family loves Pita Jungle. My parents enjoy the Mediterranean Chicken Salad and chicken hummus plates. On the other hand, the are many vegan options for me! The chipotle back bean burger is delicious and so it the macro platter. We usually get the food To-go and the service is always speedy. Highly recommend PJ!"}
{"text":"I was ecstatic that they open this location.  It is close to my work, since the other locations are a bit far from home.  I love, love, love Pita Jungle.  I can eat here every night.  I have not had one bad dish."}
{"text":"Ordered a few happy hour options, like the hummus trio for $2.00 and the mozzarella tomato for $3.00 (definitely not worth the price).  You literally got a tomato slice on top of a mozzarella slice, not worth $3.00.  Our food was good; as expected from Pita Jungle.  However, the restrooms--well the ladies room smelled horrid.  I chose to only wash my hands and hold the need to use the bathroom, I could not stand it in there.  It wasn't dirty, it just had a horrible sewer smell.  Our waiter was pretty unattentive.  He would talk to the other waiters and it would seem like he was looking right at us but would not acknowledge us as we waived our hands to get his attention.  We finally had to ask another waitress to help. I am a fan of Pita Jungle for the food, but the experience at this location was not a good one."}
{"text":"I suppose I should sit back and relax a bit before I write this, but what the heck, right?  Went to this location for dinner tonight.  The food?  About what we expect when we go to Pita Jungle (and we've been many times) except we USUALLY go to the location on Shea.  I kinda wish we had.  First, this location has a funky setup that I don't like - it's just a big box with some tables in it.  Second, I had heard a rumor that the staff at this location were a bit unfriendly.  I figured it was just a rumor.  Based on our waitress, it's more fact than rumor.  We are fans of tabbouleh, but tonight there seemed to be an abundance of parsley in the dish...  We commented to our waitress and she said \"What you're eating is Tabbouleh, a parsley salad\"...  Yeah, thanks.  Um.  Usually it's not so parsley-y.  \"It's always like that\"...  Well, we get it a lot, and... \"I've been working here for years, and that's how it's always been\"...  OK.  Nevermind.  Enjoy your 10%.  I've always enjoyed Pita Jungle, and will continue to enjoy it, just not at this location.    PS - My falafel pita was just sort of meh, but you sure were prompt on filling iced teas!"}
{"text":"The service was amazing. The food was equally amazing. I had the Lentil Fetoosh salad and a cup of the Mayan chili. I love the casual and laid back atmosphere. It's also refreshing to the staff in comfortable day to day clothes as opposed to mundane uniforms. Thank you for an awesome experience."}
{"text":"Not only do I love the reasonably priced delicious food but I adore the staff! Did you ever meet an utterly charming and excellent server who made you feel like royalty? Well, please go over to PJ and make the acquaintance of Tia! You will be as taken with her as I was. I was so bummed - the parking lot was a mess because they were doing the blacktop. I was so annoyed.  But then, Tia smiled and got me a drink. I honestly thought we were friends but she treats everyone with great care and courtesy. My blood pressure returned to normal in a blink of an eye. The Mediterranean salad eas split between me and my friend and then to the movie to see The One I Love. The one I love is Tia. Thank you!! YOU HAVE THE GIFT!"}
{"text":"Love the Pita Jungles. A huge menu and unlike most places with big menus, their food is really good. Good food at great prices and the portions are ridiculously huge. They are single-handedly contributing to American obesity ;) The cilantro-Jalapeno hummus if incredible, as is the gazpacho. Actually, I have never had anything here I did not like.   Everything is fresh and the ambiance is cool and hip. what else can you ask for..."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite restaurant in Arizona. I can't get enough of this place. I have tried many different items on the menu and my favorites would have to be the glazed chicken lavosh pizza, Philly Chicken Pita, hummus trio with chicken and something that is not on the menu anymore but they will still make is the Honey Chicken Pasta salad. It's basically the chicken pasta salad but with a warm, delicious honey dressing.  The service is usually great and the atmosphere is always nice. They change the decor in the restaurant pretty frequently which makes it nice to visit.  Give it a shot, good clean healthy food!"}
{"text":"Can't express how much we love this place. The service is extremely fast and good vibes everywhere. We came here for lunch a couple times a week. Definitely recommend paying them a visit"}
{"text":"So I try to be positive when doing these but I just went by myself to PJ and it took a solid hour to have some salmon. Besides that it took almost 10 min just for me to get a menu and a glass of water. So after waiting 30 min to get the salmon my side salad came out last instead of first which would make sense. So I've been to this location about 6 times but this time it wouldn't let me write you a message separately so unfortunately I had to write a review on here.  So I've tried to email you Kevin and your mailbox is full."}
{"text":"Fresh tastes - great variety. Loved the mediterranean platter. Lunch time gets busy so get there early or do a late lunch. Great service too."}
{"text":"Great food - like all of the PJ's. This one is tough during the week for lunch - call ahead and get it to-go otherwise you'll be waiting. If you can get there by 11:30 you'll be ok. Friendly service each time I've been there."}
{"text":"\"This is the goodest best restaurant ever!\"   As stated by a 5 year old. This location is amazing. Food get here on time and is delicious"}
{"text":"I've always been a fan of Pita Jungle, but this location takes the cake for service! I call before I leave the office to get an order to go.  They tell me 15 minutes.  When I arrive 15 minutes later, my order is ready!   The service here is always friendly and they know my name.  The place is clean, too. The back patio is huge and they have free wifi.  There's even a small bar outside, looking in.  I've never seen it completely empty.  So glad we finally have a Pita Jungle in CenPho!!!"}
{"text":"NOTE:  I only had take-out, and it was brought to me by my boss.  She rules! She got me a hummus/grilled/marinated chicken combo.  It has 3 different hummus...es...es (HA!): roasted red pepper, jalapeno and plain ole' hummus.  They are sectioned off in the big plastic container, which rules for my OCD, as I don't like my food touching.  In the center is a PILE (a total monton!) of grilled chicken.  It's got some sort or spicy rub on it, but not too much kick.  It had been marinated, too.  And tender....I think this is the most tender chicken I have ever had.  It made my own tender spots as juicy as the chicken was! I'm not big on pita, so instead she got me a side of cukes.   This thing weighs a ton and I've been eating it for 2 hours.  I have made a mess in my \"Make me Yelp\" boyshorts."}
{"text":"Surprised I haven't written a review for this place earlier since Pita Jungle is only a few blocks away. This place is Vegetarian, Non-Vegetarian, and Vegan friendly so really you can find something for everyone at this place. In addition, there is outdoor sitting by the lake, which is just perfect when the weather cools down.  Just don't mind the ducks. ;)  The food here is really good and fresh. This evening I'm having the Couscous salad with a Passion Fruit iced tea, but I've also had many of the other menu items throughout my several visits to this spot. I can usually never finish the salads since they are so huge, but they taste just as good the next day. The Hummus is a must, and any kind will do they're all really good. If you're watching carbs, you can order it with cucumber slices instead of a pita which is fantastic and very refreshing on a warm day.   All in all, I really like this place and the service is great. Not too slow, but not too rushed either. This is one of my go-to places when I really crave something super healthy."}
{"text":"Food was decent but the service was sooooooo terrible that it made it so I will never go again. The restaurant was mostly empty and the server rarely ever came by. When my date found a hair in her food it was 20 minutes before we saw the server again to the point where we just didn't say anything paid and left. I don't want anything for free nor do I ever expect anything to get comped for a hair in it, I just expect it to be replaced and yes it was also most certainly not her hair. Thanks pita jungle for being a buzz kill on what should of been an awesome third date, luckily I am charming and witty and could recover after the terrible experience at your crap hole of a restaurant."}
{"text":"Every pita jungle gets 5 stars from me! My favorite restaurant, so maybe a little biased ;) Nonetheless, the consistency is always there with every location. Thanks PJ for always fulfilling my roasted red pepper and hummus with chicken fix...plus the garlic dip! :)"}
{"text":"Roasted red pepper hummus with chicken. That's all you need to know!!! Oh and their smoothies are a lovely surprise as well!! LOVE PJ!!!! Been going for 10 years now. LOYAL CUSTOMER FOR LIFE!! :) :) Hands down my favorite restaurant, EVER!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! It's like a diner menu for middle eastern food. Very smart operation. Very innovative kid's menu and activity book. My chicken curry salad was surprisingly good."}
{"text":"Happy Hour is very nice. $2 off wine, $1 off beer, (could use more draught selections). We had a variety of tapas, very good and inexpensive, glazed chicken pizza, baba ganoush, mozzarella and tomatoes, lemon garlic chicken with pine nuts, etc. The Val Vista location has roomy booths on one wall, bar seating, and small tables for two that can be moved together for more people. The table section could have more ambience,  maybe different tables, since tapas take up some space and the tables are small. Good for a quick bite, though. This was our first visit and we will be back with friends for happy hour. Thank you, Nicole, for turning a crummy day into date nite. :-)"}
{"text":"love the food, the service is always good too.  my grandsons actually requested to go there for their 7th & 8th birthdays!  Even our 18 month old grandson loves it.  we'd probably go more often if it were A) closer B) less expensive"}
{"text":"One common thread that seems to run through the Pita Jungle restaurants is POOR SERVICE. Waited 50 minutes for food and then had to deal with a sour, condescending bartender. Oh joy. That was truly my last foray into Pita Jungle."}
{"text":"Delicious food, hideous service. We were a party of 8 and waited patiently for 45 minutes for a table. In our party was a 9 month old baby, 2 four year olds and my 75 year old mother. After our extensive wait, a party of 7 walked in and began eyeing a table that was clearly about to finish up. As the table got up, one of the individual's from the other group went up to the hostess, told her that they would take that table and our group could have another table (that was still seated and eating dessert). What?? We immediately protested but the hostess had already acquiesced. We sat around for another ten minutes, kind of shell shocked and trying to decide what to do (hungry little ones and A Lot of time invested). The manager offered nothing other than lukewarm apologies. I finally was so disgusted that I left. No excuse for seating the other table in front of us. Too bad the service is so poor because I do like, or should I say, liked, the food."}
{"text":"Get the general part out of the way first. The food was good, the service was good. My wife and I both got the Gyro and sides of the garlic new potatoes, they were excellent. The different part of the night was the \"entertainment\". This is apparently a hang out of choice for the 20-something crowd. Ahead of us were a couple of girls in there that were drinking while one was already drunk, and when their guy friends left, the drama starts with bouts of crying, then giggling, then crying again etc etc. On our right was another couple of girls who had another drama ridden discussion, with juicy details of how she is a biter in bed and got a little over zealous on a recent \"adventure\". I'm not sure if every night is like this, but it sure made for good dinner theater."}
{"text":"First time here and I ordered a pita I always judge a pita by the quality of the pita bread and if it stays intact this one did not it fell apart which made it messy to eat and I did like like the substitution of pickles for fresh cucumber in it the red bell pepper humus was pretty good but the pita chips it was served with were not the kids meals where not good at all they get to put together their own meals but the choices are strange not that great won't be backs"}
{"text":"Awesome Happy Hour..maybe best in town.  Tyler at the bar was great..awesome staff..really goid food.  A must!!!"}
{"text":"Service was amazing! Chris was so nice and patient with us because it was our first time there, he recommended great dishes! If this review was only for service, they'd get a 5/5 :)  I had the gyro and it was SO good! However, my mom had the roasted shawarma and said it was on the dry side but the flavor was still there. We also got the hummus trio and garlic hummus from the happy hour menu ($1.50 each), very yummy as well!   We will definitely be returning for gryos and hummus!"}
{"text":"Co-workers rave about this place, so I gave it a try.  Tabouleh salad was tasty and hearty.  Iced tea was not good and staff seemed a little too busy for me to ever get a chance to exchange it.  Everyone was very friendly, though, and they accommodated us as a large party.  It seemed OK, but not a place I'm dying to return to."}
{"text":"One star from me. Ordered Caramelized cauliflower and it was burnt. Second try was half cooked, third try I gave up. Ordered pasta salad arrived with raw chicken and cold to boot. Called over manager who is also owner who really should have cared; but didn't. Told me it wasn't raw and the cold pasta made the chicken cold in hummmm 25 seconds. So we gave that back, he did not charge us for lunch, good thing we didn't eat anything! The one star was for the cure little waitress who was far more attentive than the owner \ manager and was embarrassed by the entire ordeal. Not coming back here or would recommend that you go here for any reason. Pitiful Pita Jungle. I could starve to death going here, owner\manager very disappointing."}
{"text":"I like this place. It's good, simple and usually pretty quick. The happy hour here is actually worth checking out. The food portions are large for the prices."}
{"text":"This is my second review for this location. I can't stress enough that this place is amazing..the only complaint I have is there are too many excellent selections on the menu, so I find it hard to decide what to eat :)  Kilt Lifter beer for $3.75 a glass at Happy Hour, you can't beat it! and add to that $1 and $2 appetizers and I'm in my glory...."}
{"text":"My family and I have been going eating at Tempe Pita Jungle for last 14 years. always great service, great food and we decided to visit Ahwatukee location, with 12 family members, to be surprised how rude and lousy customer service is at this location.  It may not be fair to say that everyone was rude, but two out of three waiters, managers, have been very rude.  Surprisingly rude in suggesting that we sit outside in 103F weather with small kids, after being asked to accommodate us reasonably with better seating.  Customer service is art, it is a backbone of every service oriented business, so my suggestion is that Pita Jungle management seriously examines their expansion and what they want to become.    We left, 12 of us and took our business elsewhere, and I hope that others will not tolerate low standards at this location."}
{"text":"First time here. Loved it.  We only had 30 minutes for lunch as we were going to the movies, and our wait person was very accomodating.  We had a very fresh Greek salad and gyro pita. Will definitelyreturn to try other options."}
{"text":"Thankfully, the yelp hours of operation was wrong.  They are open on Sundays.    We were seated and greeted by our server promptly. They easily accommodated the changes to my order and our food was brought out before we knew it.  As always, the food was plentiful and delicious. Our server did a great job keeping our drinks full and offered to-go cups.    Get the hummus! It's so smooth and flavorful, you will crave it."}
{"text":"Great Chicken Pasta with lemon dressing this time around.  Berry tea so good it almost makes you forget there is not any good beer available. Atmosphere is always comfortble, food is consistently good, service is mostly just ok.  I'm a regular here and plan on keeping it that way!  GOOD STUFF!"}
{"text":"This place is Sublime. No other words to describe it. I recommend the wood fried veggie lavash wrap. And the Myan quinola Chile. Excellent, has a Cajun twist and tastes like it has meat in it.  This is not the first time I've been here. Ethan and Joe are some of up their best servers here. Always a pleasure to come here. Chad is super friendly and super on top of it too. I just found this place and I've been coming here often. Watch it it is addictive. No seriously if that's good.!"}
{"text":"Simply amazing amazing!    ...No other words to describe it.  Service was friendly, suggestive and excellent.  Food... well there's just no way to describe it you have to try it!  Thanks Mathew for the excellent service and great suggestions"}
{"text":"Very good service, food was good. Good service. Pita is fresh and humus was very tasty. Salads have fresh fruit, nice touch."}
{"text":"Eating out at a Pita Jungle is always a pleasant experience.  The food is fresh, interesting, and plentiful.  COME HUNGRY!!  The portions are huge!  The \"must have\" dish for me is the Nachos.  Yum!  I've been to the Mesa location several times, and I have always enjoyed friendly, attentive service there."}
{"text":"When we do the hummus trio with chicken the chicken amount is so dang skimpy that it hardly seems worth the trouble and price.  The flavors are 9 of 10 times good, but if you want to leave out the carbs, you end up paying a lot for just hummus and some protein."}
{"text":"Awesome food and super healthy.  I recommend the chicken and hummus appetizer, the cilantro hummus is to die for! Have a margarita too it's delicious"}
{"text":"The food is always great, but sometimes the service leaves a sour aftertaste. I will say that this location is great for happy hour and dinner for sure. But I've had some less than stellar weekday lunches here. It seems to depend on the server, but the experience can either be wonderful, or you could feel like you are annoying your server with common requests like \"extra napkins\" or \"please bring the bill.\" This has happened one time in particular, but it was enough to make me think twice about trying to grab a quick bite during the lunch hour.   Side note: the happy hour specials here are the best of any location. They offer HH drinks and food 7 days a week instead of just M-F like the Shea location. The house red and white wines are perfectly decent, and every pour is very generous (at least 6 oz). As for the tapas, everything is good, and only the seafood options seem rather small. Chicken, mushrooms, and all of the dip/pita combos are great!"}
{"text":"This location is smaller than some of the newer locations, but has great service and the same delicious food! Solid choice for any meal!"}
{"text":"Got the Mahi-Mahi sandwich to go; good portion and take out service but kinda disappointed in the bread (used white bread) and fish was too bland, no spices. I would recommend make it more spicy flavor and maybe better quality bread. If counting fish, health factor is good but white bread, hmmm not sure. Sides were patatoes and some green"}
{"text":"While one of the healthier choices in Arizona, I wasn't impressed with their food, nor their service. I've only been to the one in Chandler.  While the fare isn't terrible, I just don't find it overly flavorful. I've had the hummus, and the lavosh salmon wrap. The wrap was pretty disappointing for me.  I'll probably go again just to see if something else on the menu will wow me. And if my opinion changes, I will come back & update."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Manager was very unprofessional when we asked for help. This must be under new ownership."}
{"text":"This is the second time I've been to this location and I'll be honest the first time I came it seemed so much was going on and it looked disorganized I questioned quality of food and cleanliness. I am pretty observant and over the last two visits I've been super impressed with the food and the workers are always moving , cleaning , serving. The place is just so busy. And a big bonus for me personally is they serve Pepsi products. Which is awesome."}
{"text":"Favorite neighborhood place. Good, healthy food. Great wait staff...especially Selene!  My favorite is the Turkey Pesto Lavosh Wrap. It comes with a Greek salad but I get potatoes! Very yummy at a great price."}
{"text":"I used to go here a lot as a young teenager. Since then I have moved out of town but I ALWAYS make it a point to come back here and eat something. I most always order the Mediterranean Chicken (Shwarma) Pita. Which has never let me down. This time I took a chance and tried the spicy chicken pita. Omg there was enough tasty veggies, beans and chicken inside to feed a small country! The pita if you unfold it is the size of a large plate and they are very generous! It was not too spicy (for me) but all those veggies are what really did it for me. It just burst with flavor!! Make sure you come starving or be prepared to take at least 1/2 home! Love this place, I will continue to keep coming here when I am home. Very proud of their success and its well deserved!"}
{"text":"Pretty cool spot. The philly cheese steak with garlic potatoes is awesome. Would go again."}
{"text":"I go here a lot and always get great food. I usually get the chicken shawarma or the beef gyro and iced tea. The food is fantastic and the servers are usually prompt. I would recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Living in Scottsdale for years, I was used to Pita Jungle being a 'casual, run in and grab a veggie pita' type of place so I wasn't prepared for this one to be a bit more upscale. Went on a weekday, was packed. Sat at bar and ordered lunch as I was dying for a falafel wrap. WORST falafel I have ever had. It came out half burnt, dry and so bad, I didn't even eat half of the wrap. I was nice about it and they ended up comping my meal. It takes a lot for me to complain, but it was THAT bad. I wonder if they should have stuck with the causal fare, but either way, I will always like the concept and the menu, just stick to quality. It felt forced and like the kitchen was just throwing out food for the sake of."}
{"text":"No online ordering for this location which is why I take away a star. Called in my order and the hostess was extremely pleasant. I picked up my order and it was ready, food was excellent, no complaints. I would like to come back for a sit down meal as the wine selection looked good."}
{"text":"Went for lunch this week and did not even eat...dozens of flies caused us to leave...place was full with people who didn't mind flies landing on their food so it must be good..."}
{"text":"Was here at the beginning of February, and tried one of their breakfasts. It was ok, some sort of omelet. I can't remember what it was! It was very potato-heavy. I also feel really bad for them always having the pro-life crowd picketing all around the little strip mall. I think I'll stick to lunches."}
{"text":"I love their hummus platter and their California Club pita! It's quite the hip place, and always busy. I'd rather do take out than stay in, because it's just busy and loud. And I\"m a grumpy old lady. Busy means slower service too. But the food is good."}
{"text":"so annoying to eat here during lunch! I will not be back again during lunch time. I had to take TWO hours from work today just because service was SO SLOW and parking is terrible. we ordered our food at 12:15 and it didn't arrive until 12:45. (note: none of us ordered anything that took long to cook, we ordered the broiled chicken salad and the veggie burger).  we scarfed our meal down and paid our bill, but then had to wait around another 10 minutes because our server had forgotten to bring my friend a to-go box. eventually I ended up just walking up to the food prep line and asking for a to-go box.  I'm not sure if they need to hire more staff or what, but they need to do something about the awful and slow lunchtime service."}
{"text":"I like the new location, it looks great inside and has lots of space!  Also some nice patio space.  But the lack of parking is a real pain in my rear.  If they have any parking, it's hard to find because I didn't see a parking lot or any parking spaces.  We had to park in the metered parking about a block away.  Not a huge inconvenience, but enough to make it less appealing than other restaurants.  The food was great, as usual.  I ordered my usual broiled chicken salad.  My dining companion got the spicy chicken wrap, which was a LOT larger than he was expecting.  One thing that has always annoyed me is that when you order their hummus appetizers you basically HAVE to order an extra pita, or you won't be able to eat all the hummus.  Why can't they just give you enough pita in the first place and factor that into the price of the appetizer... I just hate that feeling of being nickel and dimed."}
{"text":"Pretty good food. I had the Philly steak pita and the Greek salad.   The only reason I give 3 stars is because the takeout food is not the same quality and the Greek salad was so small for $7."}
{"text":"Pita Jungle is one of the freshest spots around when it comes to custom orders, fresh vegetables and courteous friendly staff. Their red pepper hummus and roasted vegetables make a great light lunch and with their generous portions, even that is too filling!"}
{"text":"Service was slow and the waitress never checked back with us. It took 45 minutes to get our food from the time we sat down."}
{"text":"Always good food and Service can sometimes be a bit sketchy.  We don't mind as the food is generally very good and the atmosphere is very laid back.  This location has a full bar and a bicycle theme with large bikes hanging from the ceiling and light pendants attached. As always local artist show there work and it's available for sale.  The large patio is very nice as well and offer great heaters to stay warm in Arizona's cooler months.    Today I enjoyed the caramelized cauliflower appetizer which was very good.  Definitely going to get that again.  It was light and crunchy, almost like a popcorn consistency in a nice sauce.  I also had the Kafta pizza.  Even though I enjoyed it, next time I will add some jalape√±os to the mix and make it a tad more flavorful.  For gluten free seekers, at an up charge you can get gluten free on any pizza."}
{"text":"I wasn't too hungry today so I decided to get one appetizer (small humus) to share with my family and a side dish as my entree. I wanted to be healthy so I picked cauliflower with tahini sauce. It was so yummy I was already dreaming about next time I would have it. I would consider having this everyday if I could. On my return home, I decided to check the nutritional info. I was so bummed when I did. Little did I know, my side order as an entree lunch had total of 920 calories...far more than the main entrees others at my table had. Needless to say, it was yummy but I would never order it again.  Well, maybe tahini sauce on the side would cut the calories by half because it was smothered in it...sigh...I need to go burn that small lunch off now :(."}
{"text":"This is smaller than other Pita Jungle locations I've been to. However, it wasn't too crowded on a Wednesday night and we were seated right away. Our waiter was very friendly and efficient. We didn't have to wait too long for our food. I ordered my usual, grilled vegetable salad. It's a huge pile of healthy deliciousness. This location gave me lots of carrots along with the standard broccoli, cauliflower, zucchini, eggplant, and mushrooms on a bed of romain lettuce. Enough veggies for the week.  My hubby ordered the poke bowl. Its different than what you'd expect but it was still delicious. It has lots of mangoes if you are mango lover.  I also ordered a philly steak pita Togo. It was loaded with beef; definitely more than other locations. It was yummy as well. I have to say they have huge portions. All the dishes including appetizers are big enough to be shared. Overall, we had nice experience. The dining room was clean and there were ample patio seating as well."}
{"text":"One of the slower Pita jungles I've ever been to. But same good food and service with a great happy hour daily from 3-6. All the items are $2 except for the shrimp and scallops are $3. see photo"}
{"text":"I have been coming here for many years and the food is consistently good made to order and fresh. they have grown tremendously over the years and now they have franchise locations all over the valley. If you're looking for good Mediterranean and vegetarian style food this is your place. They also do a happy hour daily from 3 to 6 & 9 to close."}
{"text":"Food is always good. I like the carryout window. When the weather permits, it is nice to be able to pick up to go orders without having to deal with the crowd inside."}
{"text":"Service was phenomenal. The food was pretty great, had the falafel pita and jalape√±o humus.   It could use a little more flavor in the humus but the service was prompt and extremely nice that it made everything taste that much better.   Great little outdoor area too."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for lunch today. We love Pita Jungle and I'm glad there is one at Arrowhead. The only downfall is that the parking lot is so packed at lunch time, you have to either park far away or drive around until someone leaves  The food is always great every time we go. My husband got the glazed chicken lavosh pizza which I love and I got the broiled chicken salad. I love how the chicken is always juicy and never dry. We shared a small plate of the red pepper hummus, which of course always tastes great.  This is definitely a great place to go for a healthy lunch. The prices are on the higher side, but I'm wiling to pay for the food I get."}
{"text":"Pita Jungle is always on point! The food is energizing and delicious! The falafel bowl is one of our favorites along with the quesadilla. The outside atmosphere is so awesome we haven't even eaten inside! Lol. We are always greeted nicely and allowed to sit wherever we want. The food comes out quick too! You can't beat some good Pita Jungle!"}
{"text":"I have been told by several Arizonians that I must try Pita Jungle! And it is simply amazing! I have been to a lot of mediterranean restaurants and this truly tops my experiences of them all. The food is awesome! Absolutely everything on the menu sounds delicious! The cilantro jalapeno hummus I had is outstanding! You must order this when you go. Simply amazing. Every ingredient is so flavorful and the food just melts in your mouth. You must GO!"}
{"text":"Quite possibly my favorite restaurant in the area.  SO glad they opened up a new one closer to my house!  The restaurant is a really beautiful space -- moody overhead lighting, cool art on the walls, and unique furniture spread around for a loungy kind of feel.  The servers are all young hipster types, very nice and attentive.  Literally everything I've tried from their menu is good!    Favorites include: the coconut curry soup, hummus trio, spinach four cheese quesadilla, lavosh pizza, garlic new potatoes, caramelized cauliflower with tahini, guava lemonade, and their amazing rice pudding for dessert.  All of the smoothies I've tried are good too.  I really don't think you can go wrong here!  Highly recommend.  Great place for flavorful, healthy, fresh food!"}
{"text":"I have yet to meet a dish I didn't like at Pita Jungle.  And I am deeply in love with their jalape√±o cilantro hummus, but honestly all three varieties of hummus are stellar.  I always lean toward the schwarma pita because it is simple but delicious but they have many other great dishes as well as really good seasonal choices.  With a Mediterranean theme complemented by their own unique twists, I will always say yes to this place.  The service has been great at every location I have visited, and if you like tart, fresh lemonade I highly recommend theirs.  Enjoy!  I always do."}
{"text":"Seems more like a bar & restaurant rather than a quick stop for a bite. I was surprised when I walked in. The first thing I saw was the bar which were occupied by rather well dressed good looking people. Bar has 4 flat screen tv's playing sports and nicely stocked with various liquors, wine and beer. They also have a cheap happy hour menu. Food is also reasonably priced with a good portion. Had a great meal and would definitely go back. I'm still pleasantly surprised at how nice it is inside. Enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"I love everything about Pita Jungle.  They have huge portions, a big menu, and delicious fresh food.  I've been a loyal Pita Jungle junkie for a while now and I have never once left being unsatisfied.  I can't say what is my favorite dish [they're all delicious!] but I will say that they have a Raspberry Mango Cheesecake and the Glazed-Chicken Lavosh Pizza are amazing.  You need to try it!  The atmosphere of this place during the nighttime is great for a date, the staff is super friendly, and everything about this place screams ARTSY! Great ambience and good food... love this place!"}
{"text":"This location has an awesome upscale environment. The food taste is consistent with the other Pita Jungle locations I've been to. The only flaw I saw here was the person who runs the food to the tables. She brought my husband and I the wrong food twice, before we finally got our order! So that's why I had to give 4 stars instead of 5."}
{"text":"This was my first trip to any Pita Jungle and I am intrigued. I will probably go back again and may either bump this up one or be satisfied with a 3.  The great:  Coconut curry soup. Flavorful, creamy, and just overall tasty. Good enough that I went home and made a pot of coconut curry and chic pea soup.  The good: The shwarma wrap. I enjoyed the toasted wrap. That said, my dad is Lebanese so I get a bit picky. The wrap that comes with the salad does not have pickles, tahini or garlic sauce. It is probably a decision because of the cooking method but without at least 2 of those 3 it was missing something for me. That said, the pita tasted great and had a nice crunch.  The less good: The pesto pizza. My wife ordered the pesto pizza. It was $7.49. It was a pita that was the size of a small plate with pesto, a bit of melted cheese, and 4 slices of tomato. She said it tasted good but the size was a bit underwhelming for the price. I have made enough pesto to realize that it is an expensive sauce, especially if they are using pine nuts. But the size made her think appetizer. She was looking for a meal.  Overall, the food was good. My complaints are mostly nit-picky. I would like to see that pesto pizza labeled as an app rather than a main dish or come with a little something else (the wife is not a bit eater and if she is calling something small, that is saying something!) on the side. I plan to go back, try something different, and hope that I can get something else as good as that soup next time. If so, I'll happily increase this review!"}
{"text":"Had a wonderful dinner at this restaurant tonight. Elizabeth was my server and she took VERY good care of my party and I. Cocktails were on point and my food was very flavorful! Good quality, healthy food choices without breaking the bank! I've come during happy hour as well and love the deals they have. The grilled chicken and cilantro hummus is my favorite. Also, the dolmas and roasted cauliflower are pretty good options. The happy hour margarita is always a good choice."}
{"text":"love this place im visiting from california and I love this place every one is soo nice and fast with serving the food I reccomend everthing and the hummus yummy makes me want to move here lol the food is so fresh and they explain what everything is"}
{"text":"One of my favorite Mediterranean spots in the Phoenix area. Came during the weekend and didn't have to wait in line plus my food came out in a timely manner. The staff was friendly and my server was very attentive.  There's no way you can leave unsatisfied if you order the right things on the menu. I always get the saut√©ed cauliflower and order from the happy hour menu (3-6) : grilled chicken for 2$, feta cheese for 1$, pita bread, and hummus for $1. My combination of what they call happy hour \"tapas\" is affordable and has such an exquisite Mediterranean taste."}
{"text":"i absolutely love the caramelized cauliflower!!!! great food. good service"}
{"text":"Great service and some of the best food I have ever had. I still remember the first pita jungle in Tempe. To this day one of my top 5 restaurants!"}
{"text":"Great service and great food!! Everyone I eat here I feel satisfied and full! Unlike off her restraints this food doesn't leave you feeling bloated it just feels fresh!   I had the coconut curry soup and it was a great meal! I would also recommend the ahi and hummus! A great place if you have diet restrictions!"}
{"text":"I love pita jungle. They are a great change if you are looking for a healthy lunch. They have amazing portions and we are always taking food home. Their coconut curry soup is a must try! *Some locations may not have it. They are also masters of lemonade! We always get the Jalape√±o cilantro hummus with cucumbers, it is the perfect combination."}
{"text":"Don't let the category tag of vegetarian make you meat lovers run away. I promise there is something on this menu for everyone at a very reasonable price. So close to home but somehow I manage to forget about this Pita Jungle tucked behind the 4 Sons gas station at 44th and Indian School. Plenty of gyro type options ranging from Schwarma to philly steak. Generous portions,very flavorful and can have a decent meal around $10. Ive had a variety of    the pita wraps and tried the pizza a few times. Ive never had antyhing I didnt enjoy eating and have always left full.  I end up getting some kind of hummus and finish lunch off with baklava so more than $10 at that point but a nice treat regardless. This location is always clean nice with a slight hipster health nut vibe but par for the course. They have four or five beers on tap a wall worth of wine selection and some happy hour drink specials as well. If you've never been before try to get there for happy hour. I just noticed tapas type options on that list while I was ordering a to go meal. Good way to try a little bit of everything to see what you would like."}
{"text":"My first visit to Pita Jungle. Met a friend for lunch and she recommended this place. Some typical offerings you would expect from a restaurant with \"pita\" in the name. (By the way, in this instance, \"pita\" does not stand for \"pain in the ass\").  The Philly Cheese Steak pita was really, really good. An a little messy. The soups really caught my attention; however I did not order any. Tomato-based soup and the white shirt I was wearing are natural enemies. (No, I didn't get any cheese steak on me).  I know they had desserts on the menu, but didn't try any.   While I don't know if I would race back here again, I will consider it as a good place to go."}
{"text":"We had a great meal at Pita Jungle one night - so many fresh takes on Mediterranean flavors. We sat outside on the back patio, very nice, but a little hard to wave a staff member down.   We had a sampler appetizer platter, with hummus, babaganoush, taboule, grape leaves and the like - it was a great preview to the menu.   I had a Mediterranean pizza with kefta on top - spicy, fresh, and delicious. Things like pomegranate seeds and cheese really make the pizza unique. My wife chose a chicken salad that was just a heap of tasty ingredients - so much flavor.   To close, a rice pudding with strawberries and raisins - not too heavy, light and fresh."}
{"text":"I was looking for a healthy meal after being on the road for four days and They didn't disappoint !! Quickly greeted and set down . It was a Friday night and the place was packed. The wait was usual and our waiter was very pleasant and punctual . I opted to try their famous caramelized broccoli . I didn't care for it but it wasn't bad at all. My sister loved it. We had their $5 all day Margaritas ,which were delicious . :) For my entree I had the Mediterranean chicken salad, yummy!! It was packed with everything delicious .  I even tried  the glazed chicken pizza ! Another great dish. Next visit , I'll have to try a pita!"}
{"text":"You know it's good when you don't have to use the dressing!!   The Mediterranean chicken salad is the way to go!! Everything is always fresh!   Ps this was a to-go-order!"}
{"text":"Happy Hope (auto corrected hour but it fits)!   Rolled in at 9pm on a Thursday.   Great tapas deals to be had, including great prices on wine and beer."}
{"text":"I've been back to this Pita Jungle quite a few times. Service has gotten considerably better and for that, I'm thankful. However, they still fail when it comes to putting out consistent food. I don't understand why this keeps happening. It's unfortunate because Pita Jungle is SO GOOD when it's consistent, and I really want to go here all the time, but when food comes out different every time I can't spend my money here.  I thought I had a good thing going when I went on a Friday and Saturday evening. The service was excellent & the food was totally fantastic - 5 stars. Alas, these experiences tricked me into believing they had improved so I came back on a weekday during a non peak time. I ordered the same thing I did over the weekend- a chicken shwarma wrap. This time it was perfect too! I thought to myself, \"Thank god, now I can start coming back here regularly.\" So I came back on another weekday, same time, and the chicken shwarma was all wrong.   Here's what was wrong:  Not enough lettuce Not enough vegetables Not enough garlic sauce Not enough tahini  The wrap was this little measly thing with about half the amount of dressings and veggies as when I got it the last few times. Wtf? I seriously thought I was going crazy so I came back the following week and ordered the same thing, thinking maybe it was just an off day. Nope. The same thing happened- except this time it has even less tahini and sauce.   Seriously, these shwarma's don't taste half as good without a fair amount of garlic sauce and tahini. When I got it the first few times, every bite had sauce. This time, I could barely even taste it. So at this point, I asked my waiter for extra sauces and when I got the bill I found out he charged me! The thing that sucked is I didn't look at the receipt until after he swiped my card. Otherwise I would have mentioned it.  I guess I should have complained to him straight up that the pita wrap tasted like crap, then maybe he wouldn't have charged me. It was still really annoying. Both those things were $0.75 each! I was not happy!  I'm giving this place an extra star because the servers have finally become attentive and now I know never to come on a weekday and only on the weekends!"}
{"text":"I returned to Pita Jungle at their suggestion given my prior review, and had a better experience than my prior two visits, and for the first time I actually enjoyed my food.  I didn't bother to try items that I didn't like the last times I had them there.   This time I had the Chicken Combo Platter, which was apparently a better choice than on my prior visits.  The chicken was moist and delicious, I really liked the mixed beans, and the dish overall was nicely balanced.   Service was as great as ever, and this remains a good place to stop in for a healthy meal at a good price."}
{"text":"This place has gone way downhill. We ordered the hummus trio  which used to come with cucumbers and tomatoes and pita but when we asked for cucumbers, our server (long hair guy with a black Sabbath shirt) charged us and brought out Persian tiny cukes. He also gave us about a 4 oz pour on our wine. When we asked why the table next to us had full glasses, Lindsey (she ended up getting our check and helping us with the wine issue), she said they were out of the wine we ordered and asked if we wanted something else. So basically, our server just shared a glass and charged us both for a full glass of wine. Nice. We got the roasted vegetable salad. It used to be huge....no more. I don't remember it having lettuce either. Cauliflower in tahini  was SWIMMING in sauce but was really good. Sad, that was the best thing we had. Cauliflower. We tried the chicken del sol which never came with a spoon. We literally had to go up to the line and ask a cook for a spoon. It was ok, just lukewarm though. When we asked why these things were different, we were just told that maybe because this one is corporate...blah blah blah. I used to love it here but with so many choices in this area, I really don't see myself going back."}
{"text":"Love this place! Everything on the menu is amazing! The service is super polite, and speedy!"}
{"text":"the food is excellent but the waiters and waittresses need to get fired. some standouts on the menu are the hummus app, the greek platter (hummus, pita, and all that other stuff everyone knows but can't pronounce), the chicken wrap thing and the gigantor fruit salad. make sure you don't go on a friday night with a group of  8, otherwise you'll have to wait 45 minutes only to be sqozen into a table for 4."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying, this isn't a 5 star place to eat. But, I give it a mighty big round up. Why? Read on.   The food - 3.5 star worthy. You won't sink your teeth into the best gyro you've ever had, but both the beef and Mediterranean chicken gyros are good. Not great, but good. Portions are generous if you order a wrap. You'll probably need a box for 1/2 your wrap, unless you just have an ungodly appetite. Salads are big, too, and come with plenty of tomatoes and cucumber slices. Now, the hummus, that's good. Try their jalapeno hummus. Quite tasty.   Service - 3.5 stars. You won't fall over backwards with surprise, but you shouldn't have any real complaints either. Even during peak hours, like lunchtime, wait time is short, even if you arrive with a hungry group of 7. Splitting up of the check was painless, too. The waitstaff doesn't seem to have much personality, but at least they get to wear whatever they'd like, which can be interesting when you try and figure out who works there (and who doesn't). They're also attentive to your beverage, so refills are no problemo - which is a good thing when you're chowing on Greek grub.   Atmosphere - 4 stars. It's welcoming, laid back and clean. You can peek into the kitchen while they prep the food. Even for it being cramped, Pita Jungle still manages to appear more open than you'd expect. You don't feel crowded here, nor do you drown in the conversations of others, even during high traffic times. Also, there's art on the wall, which is usually great eye candy.   Artistic Support - 5 stars. This is the clincher. You see, I think it's really awesome that Pita Jungle supports local artists. Don't believe me? Go in the month of December and get a glimpse of the World of Rynaga. The entire concept - books, prints, Web site, etc. - belongs to a local artist. (http://www.rynaga.com/)   Let's recap. While the food is really good (not great) and the atmosphere is inviting and friendly, I give Pita Jungle 5 stars for being a super cool restaurant that lends a hand to help expose local artists by displaying their art on their walls for all their hungry patrons to see."}
{"text":"I go to Pita jungle frequently. I love that they have excellent vegan options!   4 stars (not 5) because there are no vegan deserts at this time!   Come on, Pita Jungle- vegan deserts are easy!  When are you going to add some to the menu?"}
{"text":"Pita jungle - we've seen the quality of your fruit go downhill the last couple of visits and hope you can correct it. We had the yellowtail tuna salad but the fruit was not good - mango was dry and rubbery, orange was sour and tart and strawberries were not at all ripe. Please fix this as we're about ready to go elsewhere."}
{"text":"I have been going to Pita Jungle since their original location opened which is located on Apache Boulevard. I have never, ever had a bad meal there. Their servings are generous, the prices are very decent for the quality of the food and the freshness of it, and if you have not been there for happy hour which is incredibly inexpensive, you really should try. Almost all the plates are between 1 and $3 and three or four will be very filling. I go there at least once a month, and I cannot recommend the chicken shawarma pita sandwich enough. Staff is friendly and very attentive, and while the location is not perfect because you look at a parking lot or Southern Avenue if you're sitting outside, at least they do have comfortable outside seating with sprinklers in the summer and heaters in the winter. Overall, if you go there and have a bad meal, I would be incredibly surprised. The Ray Road location has an outside seating area which looks at the lake, and the inside is very pleasant as are all the staff. The only thing I am not crazy about with the Southern Avenue location is that it is quite noisy in there and the acoustics are not good, although they have placed soundproof boards around the walls to dampen the noise."}
{"text":"Everything is great and I especially love the broiled chicken salad and the roasted salmon salad. You have to try to the hummus trio and you can add chicken to it! My brothers favorite is the chicken lavash pizza and the chicken philly pita. The Mediterranean salad is also a great option. They have a chicken dish with wilted spinach and mashed potatoes which is a great dinner entree . Wait time is short for food but they do get very busy at this location, especially during lunch time so getting table may cause a small wait time."}
{"text":"Good food, nothing really that special. Good tzatziki.  This location doesn't serve gyros because of some \"deal\" with the Tasty Kabob restaurant in the same shopping center. I guess they're trying not to steal business from them."}
{"text":"One of my favorite happy hours in this area.  Delicious hummus and pizzas! I'm always impressed with the service and look forward to going back soon."}
{"text":"I love Pita Jungle but have always gone to the one at Desert Ridge so I didn't realize a different location wouldn't be as good... I ordered the Mediterranean chicken salad and it was mostly parsley and barely any greens which is gross because it's supposed to be a garnish not the base of a salad. At least my breath smells good?  Also the hummus didn't taste quite as good. I think I'll stick to the other location."}
{"text":"I'll agree that this is a great meet up place in the city. Nice neighborhood, adequate parking in the structure behind, and a greta atmosphere with great service. The menu is interesting and I'd come back to try more but here's what our first visit was like.  As a Starter we had the Spinach Quesadilla made with Lavosh and it was great. I mean really great and enough as a meal for two. For that alone I'd go back.  My better half had the Falafel Pita and thought it was OK.  I had the Gyros Pita and got luncheon meat. I'm talking precisely sliced, straight from the fridge but thrown on the grill to warm-up luncheon meat. If you go online to see the menu, it's one of the items you can click for a nutrition chart. Here's what it reads for the \"meat\" Gyro Beef [Beef, Lamb, Water, Bread Crumbs (Bleached Wheat Flour, Water, Dextrose,Salt and Yeast may contain soy bean oil, Calcium Propionate), Soy Protein Concentrate, Less thean 2% Salt, Garlic and Onion Powder, Monosodium Glutamate, ];  So, the takeaway here is stay away from the Gyro.   But, Hey!  Gyro IS a pita. I expected a reasonable execution. Heck, make a Gyro meatloaf and slice it up at least.   Yes, I'm bitter."}
{"text":"Fresh digs and it rocks. We are regulars to several locations in the Phoenix Arizona area and in Newport Beach. Tonight was take out. Food perfect and they threw in an extra something just because."}
{"text":"Great food and reasonable price for quality.  Bartenders at this location weaker than others but food still great."}
{"text":"Good food, descent service.  It wasn't that packed I just had to ask for the silverware,   which is just always kind of Wierd....but what do you do.this ones a nice location.  One thing that is a definite side dish to order is the cauliflower fried dish with tahini. .just good."}
{"text":"Pita jungle flavor has gone down over the years and I'm not sure why. Every time I get potatoes here it tastes like they were microwaved. I really hope they take a step back and take pride in what they do instead of being concerned of looking like a place hipsters like to go. Make good fresh food and all types of people will come."}
{"text":"A vegan dream come true. So many delicious options, portions are large, service was fast and friendly! Customizable, real-food bowls are my favorite 'fast food'! This place did not disappoint."}
{"text":"This is a staple and I come here at least twice a week. They would get 5 stars except they always seem to be understaffed. I get to-go orders which is pretty quick, but eating in drives me crazy every time.  The food is always excellent and consistent. Very healthy options and probably the best hummus in town. The service is poor, so as long as you're patient it's ok. I'm not sure if the management team even notices or cares because I've been coming here for a long time, and it has never changed."}
{"text":"Since I've been eating at various Pita Jungle locations for over 8 years now, it's probably time I show some love!  If I could only eat at a couple places for the rest of my life, I would be totally fine as long as that included this place! It's just quick, tasty, affordable and generally fresh food. I have never had a bad meal and the service has always been good. If you don't like something, they are happy to replace it swiftly.   My staples - seasonal soups (gazpacho in the summer, coconut curry in the winter and always order it with a cheese crisp), baba ganoush!!!!, gyro, spinach & cheese quesadilla, and the tzatziki.   Pita Jungle caters to everyone and really seems to provide tasty, healthy options even for kids."}
{"text":"Great Falafel, nice location, just a real chill restaurant to dine with family and friends."}
{"text":"I only give the restaurant 3 stars based on service.   My adult son and I were seated promptly.   The server was not informed on how the sides are prepared.  I asked how the beans were prepared and all she could answer was with lemon and cilantro, she didn't even know the type of beans used or how they were prepared.   My son and I eat at very different speeds.  I finished first and the waitress asked if she could take my plate, my son was only about half done ( he obviously did the most talking).  After my plate was removed she placed the bill on the table, again, my son was only half done with his food.   This happens to be a pet peeve of mine and I wasn't asked if we would like anything g else. Bills should not be presented unless asked for.   The food would receive 5 stars and I will go back, but as a result of the service which can make or break the experience."}
{"text":"I was in the area for business. So glad I ate here. I wish the concept came east! I had the Mediterranean sampler platter. That was some of the best Baba Ganoosh I ever had!"}
{"text":"Why isn't there a Pita Jungle in every city in America? I've been hearing about this place for a while now from all my Arizona peeps. So when I finally made plans to visit the dry heat desert of Scottsdale, Pita Jungle was at the top of my list of places to go.  I browsed through some of the reviews here and have come to the conclusion that Yelpers in Arizona either have the highest (maybe even unattainable) standards or they are just a bunch of Negative Nancies.  My experience was perfect. My server, Delaney, was knowledgeable and witty. Having never been there before she directed me to get some great dishes which included the Cilantro Jalapeno Hummus which tasted like a fresh creamy treat from heaven. I also had the Chicken Tikka Masala which infused coconut with the most wonderful masala sauce I've had in my life.  One of two things now has to happen. Pita Jungle becomes the next Chipotle and starts popping up all over the country or I'm considering moving to the Scottsdale area and buying a place within walking distance of Pita Jungle."}
{"text":"Good choice for healthy eats. Love the art featured by local artists.   Best thing on the menu? Coconut curry soup! (It's vegan.) I get it with added chicken. I wish they offered gluten-free buns or pitas, though.  The kids meals are healthy & fun since children can pick one item each: protein, vegetable & grains/carbs. (All kid meals come with fruit.) Beware, however, the kids grilled chicken comes coated with herbs & spices that picky eaters may not appreciate.   Service is hit or miss with hipster staff - some of whom are too cool for school. I had to change my rating from 4 to 3 stars after bad service last time. The management must be wonky here because most of the servers have terrible attitudes. Nice waitress today, though!"}
{"text":"Pita Jungle is home to some of the tastiest hummus that has ever passed through my lips! The original version is delicious but the cilantro jalape√±o? Out of this world!! It's especially good with the homemade pita chips they serve.   Talk about tantalizing the taste buds!  I'm also a big fan of their falafel and that amazing four cheese quesadilla which they make with lavosh bread. Really, really yummy!  My absolute fave though is the Mahi Mahi. It's always cooked & seasoned to perfection and pairing it with the cilantro jalape√±o hummus & pita chips is a combo that can't be beat!"}
{"text":"I rarely find a place that fills me up for lunch...and this place did.  I ordered the Spicy Chicken flatbread/pita...it was really good.   the atmosphere is great.  The service is great.  The food is great.  It has a \"hipster\" vibe to it...so if your not hipster make sure to borrow a pair of thick dark rimmed glasses and maybe some skinny jeans before you go.  You will fit right in.  Unless your really overweight...then pass on the skinny jeans.  Maybe a pair of old Levi 501's would work.  But don't wear camouflage...they might think your the plumber."}
{"text":"Always great food and I really like the atmosphere.  Last night I had special appetizer Seared Ahi Tuna with Hummus.  The tuna was really tasty, with a slight hint of spice in the marinade. And I also had a bowl of their very consistent and delicious gazpacho soup.  I think it's only there in the summer, but I can't remember.  It is so yummy.  And a side of cucumbers which was worth the 99 cents for the amount they give.  Waitress lady was great, she and the waiter guy kept my iced tea full throughout, and I was really thirsty, so it was nice not having to ask for a refill.  Pita Jungle is always good, and it seems really healthy. :o)"}
{"text":"great place for vegetarian and vegan options and prices are very reasonable. Every time we go we have had very good service as well. This is a local chain that is expanding outside of the Phoenix area. Definitely worth a try when you are hungry for some Mediterranean-American food.  The only downside of this location is that it can get quite loud when it is busy."}
{"text":"Lots of healthy options with some unique Mediterranean flavors. The macro platter is a healthy choice and contains seared tofu, steamed vegetables. Beans, and rice. This local chain is worth trying"}
{"text":"Everytime I order here or stop in and eat it's been great food. The only thing is the service there is really hit and miss so ill give a 4 overall. 5 on food and 3 on service"}
{"text":"Great food and great prices. Sometimes service isn't the best, but can't complain too much."}
{"text":"I've been to this location twice now.  I have to say I'm impressed.  Having not been to a Pita Jungle before, this one made a great first and second impression.  The tables were clean, the food came out quickly and was delicious.  My server on both occasions was very pleasant and attentive.  Thanks, folks."}
{"text":"It's trendy and fun, decently priced, great location. I'd recommend it to anyone in the area."}
{"text":"Generous, tasty portions of rather healthy cuisine are just what this part of the Valley needs.  A nice assortment of hummus flavors are available (cilantro is a real treat), along with numerous Mediterranean favorites.  I'm rather simple so I went for the falafel and it didn't disappoint.  Nachos and other entrees go a little too far on the bean count, but otherwise everything is quite good.  Clean, luminous contemporary feel to the atmosphere.  Parking and wait times have never been a problem for me."}
{"text":"Hummus & pita, yellowfin tuna salad. SO DELICIOUS! Come here quite often as we live down the street. Great atmosphere and good service."}
{"text":"There are many reasons to totally love Pita Jungle:  great food, cheap food, fresh food, and for those that go the Tempe location, hot girls.  First, the food.  Everything here is super fresh and there is a wide variety of things to try.  I've had just about everything on the menu, and so far I highly recommend the pizzas, the black bean burger, and the Philly chicken pita.  The hummus here is also very good and I get it every time I come here.  Some of my friends say it is a bit \"yogurty,\" but I've always found it very tasty.  And this may just be a little thing that I like, but the iced tea here is that passion fruit kind, which really makes me a happy boy.  And for those of you that enjoy some \"scenery\" while you are dining, the Tempe location is full over hot coeds there for a quick, cheap, healthy bite to eat.  I have not found any variation in the food quality at all the different locations, so stop on by any one of them for a great healthy meal.  Great for take-out as well."}
{"text":"It pains me to write a negative review of PJ, but I just have to ...  I was so excited for the new location to open because my husband and I go to the Indian School location any time we're down that way, and this is way closer to home. We were impressed by all the room up there! Not cramped like the other locations. Unfortunately, the food was not nearly as good! Both of our meals were not nearly as good as we've had before (at the other locations).  Also, our service was terrible. We asked another server if ours was new, but nope: She'd bee there since it opened a couple months ago. She forgot jalapeno our hummus appetizer (to their credit, they brought it out after our meal and gave it to us for free, but it was bland and not that good). She charged me for a side of tahini, even though it was supposed to come with my veggie burger, and she never refilled our drinks.  Overall, this was a very disappointing PJ experience. I'll try again one more time, but if it doesn't improve, I won't be going back to this North Valley location. :("}
{"text":"Terrible service. I placed an order for pick up, but once I made it to the restaurant to pick up my lunch, I ended up waiting another ten minutes. The worst part of it was that when I got home, I realized that they forgot to give me my pita bread. I haven't been back since."}
{"text":"Not a fan. After eating at some great Middle Eastern-Mediterranean restaurants lately my thoughts turn to the mediocre experience I had at The Pita Jungle here in Phoenix. I was excited to try them since they have branches all over the valley - in spite of some of the reviews here on Yelp.  While the service was good and the ambiance casual and attractive the food sucked. Total disappointment with their pita. Now, I wasn't expecting the rapture, but I was hoping that it would be one of the best ever. It was, actually, one of the worst. Cold, hard and tasteless. I have had wonderful, warn, fluffy and soft pitas here in the valley- but not here. You're the Pita Jungle. Hello ?  Very sad when you screw with a fat man's food.  While the portions were generous and well presented, all were just mediocre.  I had the Mediterranean Platter. I grade it a C. Now in all honesty, they have an extensive menu and maybe some of the other items are great. Hell, they look fabulous. Maybe so I should maybe give them another chance ? I want to like this place.  Again, the  service was good- and it was the lunch rush. Maybe the cook was in a bad mood. Sorry Mr. Pita Jungle."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I stopped in today because we were in the mood for something healthy. I ordered the broiled fish sandwich because I wanted to try something new. Should've stuck with my usual fare because the sandwich is the worst thing I've ever ordered from there. The fish was only cooked and crispy on one side and the other side actually had a fishy smell which I've never encountered with cooked fish before. There really wasn't a lot of seasoning on the fish and was totally overpowered by the dry wheat bun that it was served in. The potatoes didn't have a lot of seasoning and were very bland. My girlfriend had a better experience with the falafel salad and really liked it. If and when we go back, I certainly will not be ordering that sandwich again, nor anything that's paired with the mahi mahi. Our waitress was excellent and very accommodating. The downtown location is always more consistent in regards to excellent service."}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful experience last night  It was a bit later on so there was no wait and had GREAT service.  Terrific hummus!"}
{"text":"The food, service and ambiance here is always solid.  Today I had the special Rib Eye Pacos special - phenomenal.  We will always make our lunch dates here."}
{"text":"Pretty much all the food I have had here is amazing. Their recipes are simple, clean and delicious! This is definitely one of the places I am going to miss after I move."}
{"text":"I love Pita Jungle's Tempe location.  They make consistently great food!  Esp. the Lavosh pizza in Tempe is amazing and must be tried!!!  But unfornately, this Chandler location does not live up to the same quality standards as the Tempe location!  A Lavosh pizza here is simply disappointing in comparison.  In fact, almost everything here is disappointing and many times served cold.  My first experience was so bad, I almost didn't want to try the Tempe location but I am glad I did.  It is really sad because this is a more convenient location for my wife and I but we will never come here because it is not good.  Do yourself a favor and go to their Tempe location on Apache and you'll see exactly what we mean.  They are not even the same restaurant in terms of food quality, consistency, and service!  Anyone who comes here and says the food is good has surely not been to the Tempe location!"}
{"text":"Service was prompt, food was Delish, ambiance was perfect for two. I would definitely go back. We ordered the red pepper hummus, chicken puttanesca & the philly steak pita. Everything was very fresh and full of flavor. Next time I'll make sure to order the puttanesca without capers as I don't care for the flavor that much. The waitress was very attentive and overall our experience was wonderful. Adding this to the list of date night spots."}
{"text":"Doesn't really matter which location you go to.  Nothing fancy as far as decor but the food is good healthy, and not overpriced.  The one in Tucson just as good.  If you like pizza but find that Pizza Hut fast food to  have too much fat & grease, this is the place to get a healthy good tasting pizza instead."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to eat!  I haven't found a single thing that I haven't liked here.  The lemon chicken pasta salad is the best and I am completely addicted to it.  The blue corn nachos are also really good and the chicken shwarma is really tasty.  If you have enough room at the end try the raspberry mango cheesecake."}
{"text":"I've been going to Pita Jungle for years. Back when they only had one location in tempe. Great food and \"okay service.\" You must try the lemon chicken pasta salad and banana smoothie."}
{"text":"Yesterday, I dined at the Pita Jungle.  I was thinking the place would have decor similar to Rainforest Cafe with a jungle type scene, but that was not the case.  It was a well maintained sit-down restaurant, but with more of a chill atmosphere.  I got the white meat chicken pita sandwich that came with onions, tomato, and cucumber sauce.  It was a great portion and just for $6.50!  I was very impressed, and I will have to come back and try something new!"}
{"text":"Pita Jungle is great. The waiters are always willing to make food just to your liking, even if something you want has been removed from the menu.   When I go here, I normally just get the plain ol Mediterranean Roasted Chicken (Shawarma). Delicious. The sauces they put on it make it full of flavor and tangy. They marinade the chicken in a seasoning that brings flavor to the entire pita. This is my staple. I have also ordered the spinach quesadilla (DELICIOUS) I even added chicken on this and there was well over half that I needed to take back home with me. My boyfriend often times orders the Philly Steak Pita which he is quite fond of. Loaded with meat and onion/pepper goodness.. If you want something huge, go for one of their wraps. The wraps are bigger than any burrito you have seen at Chipotle. They use lavosh bread, so you can imagine the size of these things. I actually ate one for 2 days. It has to clock in at well over 3lbs of food. The Del Sole plate they have seasonally is also one to order. Highly suggested. It's almost like a bowl of heart chili and mexican food mated and made sweet love on your plate. Served with cheese pita crisps triangles around the plate, that are also seasoned with chili powder.  As for starters, def go for the cilantro hummus. I normally request cucumbers on the side instead of the pita. Great for dipping. Also great for dipping your quesadilla into.  PS: If you get a take out order, they package your food so well so it doesn't get all nasty and soggy. Good ish!"}
{"text":"Well I was so excited when I seen a new restaurants was popping up the block from me... yay food! But honestly for me the food looks better than it taste. I love the idea but didn't care for the food. I may swing in again for their sangria it awesome, but the food not for me."}
{"text":"Pita Jungle is always consistently good. We have been there quite a few times now, and every time we leave with our bellies full and satisfied. We are big fans of the pita crisp and the quesadilla. The service is usually fast and efficient, and the wait staff is young and funky, which gives the place a hip, local vibe. I would recommend this place most for lunch or a quick dinner on a weeknight, when you want something healthier than the usual fast food type places, but you don't want to go to a 'sit-down' type of place either, (even though pita jungle is sit downish too). Well, hopefully that made sense, but all in all a great place to grub on some good food!"}
{"text":"Wow, I love other locations in Phoenix, but took 20 min to get drinks 20 more for food; the place is empty. Servers are standing around talking to each other. Never was asked if everything was ok, never could order another beer. Really horrible service... But the food was great. Won't be back to this location."}
{"text":"Pita jungle, I have been a loyal fan for what seems like 10 years (you may have not been open that long) but I have been to most of your locations. I started at your Arcadia location as I lived there and have moved out to your not so central locations. I still love you but what has happened to your side salads with your wraps. I counted this time and I got a slice of cucumber, tomato, 3 stripes of onion and olive and 15 shreds of lettuce...... :-0 Crazy! Please add more as I know that lettuce is not a big expense for you guys. Share the love a bit."}
{"text":"Start with the tri-color hummus and go from there! Best atmosphere in this shopping center."}
{"text":"This Mediterranean chain was a pleasant surprise after a long search for a dinner spot.  HUGE portions.. excellent babaganoush  and hummus with of course, pita bread :)  Everything was just so healthy... the chicken kebobs, gyros and lamb dishes were tasty.  If I lived in this area, I would be a regular. Reasonably priced and each meal can easily serve 2.. or just plenty of left-overs for lunch the next day.  BUT, patience is a MUST here..  Minus 2 stars for service............... waiting 20 mins for a soda? Come on.. you serve great food, you have to do better."}
{"text":"The food was awesome! I had the Mediterranean Roasted Chicken (Shawarma)and and the Red Bell Pepper Hummus which was terrific. We will definitely be back. The reason for 4 stars and the only negative is that it's really loud when it's busy!"}
{"text":"Always loved that place . We would go here once , maybe twice every week . But so many servers have changed lately and the customer service is now lacking . We came here today at 7 pm , which was a mistake at first ( too busy !) but anyway . It's been a several times now that we had to stand and wait for someone to give us a table and at least get a menus , which lately we are not getting them right away either .  They didn't have any available tables inside , but as we know that they have heaters on the patio we went there . Came with a 9 month old baby , had to wait outside for about 25 minutes , it was freezing and no one appeared to ask why are we even standing there ? My husband is now going to ask for a waitress , they don't know how to turn on the heater , one ends up not working , and to turn on another one they need a manager . Now the baby is crying , we cannot find a manager , not to mention THEY RAN OUT OF HIGH CHAIRS. Guys , I see lots of families coming to your restaurant and you can't even provide that . Such a mess . I love the food , I loved the waitresses that you had before but now you hiring those students who just don't care . We couldn't wait any longer and left ."}
{"text":"The food is always great! My absolute favorite is the Chicken Philly Pita. The prices are reasonable and the portions are huge.   Sometimes the service isn't as friendly as it could be, but it fits along with the low low key and artsy vibe."}
{"text":"Always such a good experience, staff it's totally chill and there's always something eclectic to eyeball on the walls.  My favorite is the chicken tikka Marsala and coconut curry soup. Being a highly picky eater I love that they are highly familiar with allergy and ingredient contents. Love that I can eat In peace.  My only reason for a 4 and not 5 is that if you catch a server on a bad day it can kinda tarnish their image, turns out a PhD  is not an employment requirement, which becomes apparent if you order Togo..   Otherwise IM a card toting member to the pita pack."}
{"text":"Some people might remember the disastrous marketing fiasco that Coca-Cola created when they changed the formula for Coke without telling their customers. Pita appears to have made the same incredible mistake in changing its iced tea brand/ formula. I have eaten at this Pita many times as you can see from the number check ins, nearly 200, (this number probably only represents  1/3 of the number of times we have eaten there with friends and family). When I ate lunch there today my woodfired chicken was absolutely superb but the Iced tea was absolutely very subpar and barely met the fast food quality. I had the berry tea, it was watery, lacked flavor and provided me an bad aftertaste. I have always considered Pita a great restaurant with the analogy of a three legged stool, good service, good food and good ice tea. The one leg of the stool has just been knocked off and the stool toppled and I am going to miss Pita because I don't believe I'll be going back anytime soon until they change the iced tea back to the Passport brand which has made Pita a solid winner. There's a Fox concept restaurant opening up across the street from this Pita and they serve the Passport iced tea so I will look forward to trying that restaurant out and certainly getting my iced tea there. Pita, let me know when you decide to change back to the tea brand that has made you such a good restaurant and I will be back then.   Kevin, thank you for taking the time to comment on this. I'm not interested in all of your reasons, I don't need to go online find good iced tea. You had it and now you don't, please fix the stool and get back to me. Please remove my name from your comment immediately you have no right to do this. Yelp I believe is exactly the platform for customers to report good or bad food and drink!"}
{"text":"I can't believe I have not written a review for Pita!! I love Pita Jungle, I have tried several different items off their menu, and have NEVER been disappointed.  I prefer this location rather than the one in Ahwatukee because I like the smaller feel of this location.  The staff is always friendly, and the service is always pretty quick.  I also like this location because you can sit on the patio by the little late which is nice for 'Date Night\" :)   I would definitely get hummus while you're there.  I love their wraps, my boyfriend just had their Kafta burger the other night which was awesome, you can't go wrong with a salad, and I have had a chicken dish from their and also a mahi mahi burger before which was bomb.   Definitely try the caramelized cauliflower while you're there too, because it is fantastic.  I can only have a couple of pieces, so I recommend sharing with your table as an appetizer.  Their green tea is to die for as well.   All in all I recommend pita to anyone! I am on a strict diet, but still find myself at Pita every now and then :)"}
{"text":"We visited Pita Jungle two consecutive nights while travelling in AZ. The first night, fantastic. Good service, waiter knowledgable of vegan items on their menu, great food. I had their hummous/tabbouleh plate and it was *enormous*. Normally, I make it my mission to finish my food (waste is my TOP peeve), but I just could not do it. So much delicious hommous...perfectly smooth, though not too thin, not too much garlic nor oil. And the fresh tabbouleh...yum. Nice and parsley-y. Easy on the mint (I detest too much mint in food). The pita, however, was a dissapointment. Too chewy. I could not eat that either. -Which is not good for a place called PITA Jungle.  Mum loved her pesto pizza (on a pita). Though, it was a bit heavy on the cheese, the pita crust remained crisp. We shared a yummy eel river ale and table water (which def. needed some lemon).  The next night, we tried to order another ale, but as it was friday night and they are in a lot with a cinema, they were quite busy, and had run out of glasses. Not just chilled glasses, all glasses. Never a good sign.   Then, we ordered a cup of lentil soup for my nephew. It came out after a time, but not in a cup -a HUGE salad bowl. \"Er, is this your cup of soup?\" \"We ran out of cups.\" And, apparently, they were running out of soup...because it seemed like the dregs and was ice cold.   Luckily, the clean glass and beer arrived. Followed shortly by our other food, another pita pizza for my mum and the Falafel plate for me and my nephew. Thankfully, these items redeemed the night. Mum liked the Pita Pizza even more than the other (perfectly prepped mushrooms, and a bit less cheese), and again, the falafel plate was such a generous portion that there was plenty for my wee nephew and I to share (since he had no soup). The falafel were delicious, hot, crisp outside, soft within, not too salty, nor oily. The baby loved them. Came with lettuce, tomato, cucumber, and pickles! -which are not mentioned on the menu, so do NOT order extra, as I did, and risk the stink eye from your waitress and an abundance of pickles (albeit tasty ones).  We ended up enjoying ourselves yet again, but we had to wait quite a time for our bill, and then had to remind the waitress to remove the lentil soup. So, great food, huge portions, great prices, but woo... they need to be ready for friday nights."}
{"text":"After waiting for a good half hour, my husband came home with dinner.  I ordered the Mahi Mahi with hummus and It was disappointing. There were only three small pieces of fish and barely enough hummus to eat the soggy pita chips. Not the dinner I had planned or expected on Mother's Day.  I think it is always best to eat in at Pita Jungle."}
{"text":"I went to pita jungle on Saturday for the first time ever. I'm in town visiting my family and we wanted to try out some Mediterranean food. The food was amazing, and the service was wonderful. Our server Liz suggested I try the jerk chicken wrap and it was delicious. We had the hummus trio as an appetizer - sooooo gooood! My mom had the Mediterranean chicken salad which she loved. Also being on a special diet, my dad has many food restrictions, but Liz was extremely patient and got him a dish he really enjoyed. All in all, our experience at pita jungle was awesome. Everyone was so friendly, and we look forward to eating there again soon!"}
{"text":"Let's be honest. Their food is always good. Just really good. But last night the service was markedly below what I've come to expect from Pita Jungle in any of their locations. Our waiter was uninformed as to the menu, the happy hour items, and the beverages. Our orders (all three of them) were a bit mussed up. We were missing tomato/mozzarella sides but then he told us they were on top of our pizza???!! Didn't want them on top of the pizza! My grilled veggie salad (which is delicious!) was missing a few bits here and there and the dressing was non-existent. I know we'll be back because we do love this place but jeez. Step up the service please! Oh, and clean your restrooms too."}
{"text":"I got the curry coconut soup. It was different, but good. Worth trying if you are interested in trying a more exotic soup flavor.  We tried the appetizer trio with the roasted bell pepper hummus, cilantro jalapeno hummus, and the plain hummus. They pita chips are seasoned and flavorful on their own. The combination of the pita chips + any one of the hummus flavors is really fantastic.   The service was alright, a bit slow. Granted, I came with a large party."}
{"text":"I really don't understand why anyone would put pickles in shawarma. Maybe that is the authentic way to do it and I am just not aware, but to me the flavors just don't really belong together. My most recent experience here my chicken shawarma was like half pickles. As in there was an equal ratio of pickles to chicken. It was really weird. This Pita Jungle right next to the AMC is nice looking and convenient but somehow the food and service never quite measures up to the other locations."}
{"text":"I hadn't been to this place in quite a while and I recently met up with a friend for lunch and had the most amazing pasta salad. It is on their menu under \"cold salads\" and it is called the Spinach Pasta Salad. It was seriously one of the most delicious meals I have ever eaten in my life. There was no meat in it but it was still very filling. There were equal parts baby spinach and pasta and plenty of other goodness as well (tomatoes, mushrooms, bell peppers). The best part was the dressing. I am pretty picky about salad dressings but Pita Jungle is great because they made theirs fresh in house and they have one that is just simple lemon juice and olive oil which is what I do at home. This salad had a little of that dressing plus some wonderful pesto sauce which is out of this world. The result was amazing flavor and freshness that just blew me away.  Go try the spinach pasta salad right now and you'll thank me later."}
{"text":"Pita Jungle can go either way at any time as far as I am concerned.  There are times that I get great service, good food, and an overall enjoyable experience.  That is where the problem arises for me, I dislike inconsistency and feel if I am paying for a meal at a restaurant then I should always know what to expect.  That is not the case with Pita Jungle as a whole and the Gilbert location specifically.  I would say the food is the most consistent part of the Pita Jungle experience.  It is almost always very fresh, well presented, and as stated on the menu.  There are times when things are missing and the food is not always hot (personal preference).  That being said it is quality food that you pay a quality price for.  The service is much more of a coin toss.  You will usually be seated quickly by someone but they are not always friendly and often just walk away after leading you to your table.  I have waited as long as 10 mins before being approached for drinks.  Rarely is anyone friendly; at best they are just \"fine\".  They seem to take the \"hipster\" vibe of this company a little far as if they are fighting \"the man\" when they are actually working for \"the man\".  I could use less pretension but I expect it when I go here so I am prepared for it and not overwhelmed.    All things considered, your choices are few and far between for the \"healthyish\" food that is served PJ.  Odds are your experience will be fine and your food will suit your needs.    As a note the take out service is awesome.  The people who answer the phone and take care of my transaction when I arrive are great.  This is my preferred method of enjoying PJ."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in Gilbert. (Tied with Joe's Farm Grill) :) I'm vegetarian and could eat at this place literally every day. The cilantro hummus is everyone's favorite, but I also highly recommend their cauliflower w/tahini, kids meals (my son LOVES mixing it up with the proteins, veggies, and starched choices), their seasonal coconut curry soup (I died and went to taste bud heaven), and their green iced tea. Honestly, EVERYTHING is delicious here. They also always have local art for sale displayed on the wall, everyone is friendly, and it's a great place to just go and chill."}
{"text":"I love Pita Jungle, and I'm pretty certain it loves me, too.  This location is one of the best with their big patio, and with very necessary misters in the summer months.  The selection is expansive, the service very friendly and efficient, and the food is always outstanding.  I like the hummus (like a lot) and falafel, but I most often get the Chicken Combo Platter, or the Broiled Chicken Salad.  They have a phenomenal happy hour, M-F 3pm-530pm.  About a dozen items $1-$2.  But perhaps the best thing about this location?  Heading next store afterwards for an ice cream...mmmm mmmmm."}
{"text":"EXCELLENT every time..... fresh and clean mark the two words from each experience visiting any of the locations.  Beautiful people eating healthful food is the result.  Make sure and try the chicken curry salad!!!!"}
{"text":"So good, so healthy and the hummus selection is outstanding.  As well the chicken is juicy as can be.  Thanks to our waiter we got a very good pour on our wine."}
{"text":"I'm sort of split on this, because I freaking LOVE Pita Jungle.. When its good.  Everytime I go, I pretty much get the same thing at this point. A broiled chicken pita, no pickles, add feta. And sometimes, I'm dying because its SO GOOD. Other times, it is OBVIOUSLY rushed, the pita is stale, the chicken is cold, and I KNOW I said ADD FETA!  My friends and I joke that we should find out who the chef is when its great, and only sit down and eat if he/she is working. But maybe it shouldn't be a joke.   Also, there's nothing really vegan here. The falafel pita is pretty much it, besides hummus. Go to Green for good vegan food. But all the meat here is awesome, juicy and delicious.   Obviously they're doing something right, because I keep going back.  Dear genie, I wish for consistency!!"}
{"text":"My husband convinced me to just try this place out, and wow Am I happy I did! Being on a cross country road trip has its downs when sick in the middle of nowhere and eating greasy, unhealthy food. Well, let me just say that Pita Jungle had amazing options of healthy food that actually tasted great too!  For example, I got something off of their seasonal menu which was basically a Chili with quinoa. My husband despises quinoa, but when he tried my dish, he wanted to eat all of it! Haha, it was really good, and for less than 6 bucks, I'd go here everyday if I could.   The outdoor seating was really nice with ambient lighting. It's a relaxed setting. I will say that service was a bit slow, it looked like some of the servers were doing their closing side work. We didn't have any napkins the entire time.   Besides the service tho, I'd definitely go here again if I am to stop by Phoenix"}
{"text":"Inconsistent everything. This location gives the original owners a horrible name. The pitas are cold and hard, the service is the worst I've experienced and the floors and flatware are dirty. Totally overwhelmed by the number of staff who stand at the counter when you walk in. Of the 5+ times we've been in here, they've never greeted us. The whole place has a bad vibe. I hate to write a review like this, but we gave this location several opportunities. If they at least changed the way the front is set up to be more welcome and inviting it would certainly help. Majority of staff has little personality. Chandler & Scottsdale locations have not lost the greatness that so many long time lovers of \"the pita jungle\" have come to love...."}
{"text":"My daughter and I have been going to Pita Jungle for 8+ years and have loved every single item we've ordered. The service (lack of) has changed over the years as they've grown and become more popular. We often feel rushed or forgotten and have waited as long as 30 minutes to get served on several occasions. BUT, the food is simply great and worth waiting for. Some of our favorites: Chicken Shawarma, grilled chicken pasta salad, grilled vegetable salad, garlic hummus, veggie burger & smoothies. You cannot go wrong."}
{"text":"I really love this local chain!  For years I lamented the absence of a place that sold falafel.  When we lived in Boulder there were falafel stands everywhere and it was always a nice little lunch on the hoof.  We moved home to Phoenix and I was surprised there weren't places here in the 9 years I was away.  My daughthen told me about and took us to a Pita Jungle out by ASU Poly.  Loved it.  Then they opened the Roosevelt location which was nice but this new midtown location is perfect for us in N. Central Phoenix.  I love not only the falafel pita and the hummus plates but the Carribean Fruit Salad is to die for!  A salad way bigger than my head which rocks!  The iced tea is fantastic and the service is always wonderful.  The d√©cor in the midtown location is visually stunning too."}
{"text":"The chicken pasta salad and chicken shawarma can't be beat, and the prices are very reasonable. Fruit & cheese plate is good, too. I miss this place and its Euro charm. XO, Pita Jungle."}
{"text":"Delicious. Awesome location. Beautiful patio. A bit pricy, as always.  Still, grateful it's here!"}
{"text":"I love this pita jungle location.  Has nice patio overlooking the lake.  The customer service is excellent and the menu options are innovative fresh and healthy. Im Def a true fan."}
{"text":"Hard to beat pita jungle if you like fast healthy food the chicken pasta salad is excellent - good service - quick healthy good food - good ambiance - good energy - well worth the trip - hummus in a wide variety of dishes - great lunch and drink under $10"}
{"text":"Sit on the patio if you can. Great view! As for the food my two favorite menu items: 1) Hummus with Grilled Chicken if you don't want something too heavy; 2) Pesto Lavosh Turkey Wrap is a great option if you have a big appetite or want leftovers. Hands down my favorite place to either sit down or pick up to-go by my work in Chandler."}
{"text":"Great food!  Great prices! Worth a little wait to get in!  Falafal is bomb!"}
{"text":"Well this place was a true disappointment.  Most of the food was just ok, but certain portions were some of the worst things I've had.  I got the veggie burger with potatoes and my wife got the Mediterranean platter. This was the first time that I'd ever had a veggie burger.  The actual patty itself was pretty good (tasted more like a chicken patty then a burger but whatever).  I didn't really like that fact that it was served on just two pieces of bread.  The worst part of mine plate was the pickles that came along with it.  They were by far the most horrible pickles I've ever had.    The Mediterranean platter looked pretty tasty.  My wife said most everything was ok (that seemed to be the trend, just ok food) but one of the sides was a green bean dishes.  They were horrible as well.  They were extremely mushy and tasted bland and not good at all.  Bar far the biggest disappointed about this place was the noise and the waitress.  It was really loud and really busy.  We went in at 7 on a Thursday night.  It was loud enough that I wouldn't even be going back had the food been great.    All and all I won't ever be returning to a Pita Jungle."}
{"text":"Tried Pita Jungle while visiting Arizona from New Jersey, totally impressed! The best way I can describe it is like a Chipotle for Mediterranean food! You can choose your sauce, protein and five toppings to go into a pita, bowl, or salad. GET THE CURRY YOGURT SAUCE ON THE SIDE. you will not regret it. I ordered the guava lemonade but had to water it down several times because it was WAY too sweet and sour to bear. BUT you do get one free refill per order so that's a plus!"}
{"text":"Every time I order take out from Pita Jungle I never need to worry that my order is correct because it always is perfect. Today was the first time I ordered PJ from Grub Hub, my order was on time & food was delicous."}
{"text":"My wife loves Pita Jungle, specifically the cilantro and jalape√±o hummus and the chipotle chicken lavosh flatbread. Also, my wife is 39 weeks pregnant.  I was wrapping up my last day of work before the baby will be born and my wife texted me that she needed these two items. Naturally I obliged and she called in the order for pick up. I arrived at this Pita Jungle since it's on my way home to pick up the order (she threw in a falafel pita for me). $32 later and I was on my way to delivering happiness to my very pregnant wife and looking forward to enjoying a night out seeing Christmas lights with my kids and our friends.  What I was not expecting was the hormonal outburst that occurred when I got home and discovered that the hummus was not cilantro jalape√±o, but normal hummus. Anyone who knows pregnant women knows that when a craving occurs, it must be fulfilled. Unfortunately we live about 15 minutes from this location and had plans we couldn't cancel.   It was a huge disappointment caused by the carelessness of the food prep here (my falafel pita had only two very over cooked patties in it - it should be 3 based on other locations). Needless to say, we'll probably not use this location again, and can't recommend it unless the quality of order fulfillment improves."}
{"text":"All i can say is that no matter what you get .. it's not just good, it's great.  I've never been disappointed and love the atmosphere and fresh ingredients.  The best part about eating here is that i don't feel bogged down and tired after I eat here like I do in other restaurants which i really appreciate."}
{"text":"This place is right around the corner from my work and the chipotle chicken lavash pizza is as good as it gets.  If you plan ahead, you've got lunch and dinner out of one order.  Tremendous value in the Arcadia area.  Great service and atmosphere even though the tables feel a little close together at times -- for lunch, it's workable.  Parking can be tricky, so maybe don't get there right at Noon.  Once they build that parking garage (not holding my breath), I'll bump it up to a 5, but right now it's like a 4.5.  I would have stopped there, but other yelpers seem to be all worked up about the recent change in the iced tea.  Are you high?  It's never been better.  It's the only time ... the only time ... I've not had to use sweetener in my tea.  And somehow the tea's not cloudy like it used to be.  I remember the old tea, and I used to just ask for soda instead.  No amount of sweetener could fix it.  So I don't know if you guys switched from Lipton and now Mr. Lipton and his buddies are all upset it, but please keep the new tea."}
{"text":"I've been a fan of Pita Jungle since before they started expanding locations. This one is much closer to me than the original. The one in Tempe has always had weird spacey hot chicks working there... I always sort of wondered if it was a cult of some sort. It has since become I guess the ideal dream job for a hot college/high-school hipster. Every location I've been to is the same in this respect.   It's also the same experience in terms of great food. The menus vary slightly from location to location, but the comestibles are always outstanding. If you like hummus, you should like this. It's light and creamy and flavorful. Not gritty or bland at all. I'd say in the last few years they've even improved on their food in terms of quality if that was possible. Their chicken has been more reliable and everything is just more consistent. Everything else... veggies, salads, pasta, pitas, etc... all great. Most of it healthy as well as tasty.   I love that you can see the kitchen while you wait for your food. It's so clean. After watching Kitchen Nightmares for the past few years, I'm paranoid about dirty kitchens. This one is immaculate - cleaner than my own. I also dig the decor. Every location is aesthetically pleasant.   Another great thing about this place is that it's not terribly expensive. Three of us ate for 42 bucks. Not too bad. I like this location more for lunch and the Tempe location for dinner. Don't know why, but I'd rather drink wine at the Tempe location.   I can't really complain too much - had less than perfect service once or twice across all locations... had imperfect food a few times. I'm not a fan of the outdoor seating - metal table/chairs - it's not a big deal though. So tough trying to find fault here.   Not only is Pita Jungle one of the best restaurants in the Valley, it's an AZ original (afaik) that we can be proud of. I wish I thought of it more often - particularly when I have out of town guests.   Pita Jungle is full of win."}
{"text":"Vibe is good and it's clean, people are nice.  However both mine and my husbands food lacked flavor. The gyro meat tasted boiled and salty not fresh. For 30$ we left with carryout with one small bag. The same order at our previous spot in NV would have given us lots of extras. Even another nearby spot would have given much more on portions. Just disappointed because I love Greek food"}
{"text":"So I came to pita jungle for the first time with a bunch of friends from California visiting. We were all not impressed. Well I mean w the service. We came all the way from north phoenix and we were all extremely hung over so it kind of made the experience kind of worst. But no that's not why it was a bad experience. We had to wait about 15 mins for our drinks, I had no cuttery so I had to steal my roommates,  she was just slow. I don't know if she was new or not but the restaurant was like empty. I'm a server and I'm sorry if your service is that slow when the place is practically empty then you shouldnt be a server.   Despite the horrible service, the food was good, I had the blackbean burger and it was so good. Everything was good because everyone got something different and they all were satisfied. The restaurant was cool it was totally my style. The staff seemed super chill and friendly. Oh and I totally want thay awesome wine rack they have when you first walk in.  But I will totally be back maybe not to this location but one closer"}
{"text":"This is only my 2nd time here.  Both times I have ordered take out.  First time the two ladies in lobby were beyond weeded.  While one was on phone, the other stood around between sitting customers.  Once I ordered the pita came out about 15 min later.  I ordered the Philly chicken pita....what I got was a mix of steak and chicken.  I was already home and too hungry to return and deal with the chaos.  This 2nd time, today Wednesday 01, June, for lunch, @ 12:30 hostess made quick eye contact before flying off to the back. No big deal I thought, I'll just go to bar.  Two patrons at bar. Two staff members behind her.  One was training.  You would think the trainer would at least great the incoming customer, right?   She just stood there.   The other, after finishing her conversation with other person, reverted to the trainee.  I finally had to say out loud \"Hi there!\"  It was then that the trainer acknowledged me there.    I'm in the service industry too.  First things first: acknowledge the customer as soon as possible.  If you are busy simply letting them know you will be right with them will be enough to avoid a bad impression or bad experience.    Let's see if my Philly chicken wrap has chicken only when I get home."}
{"text":"I have been to the Pita Jungle in Chandler many times and loved it.  I love the Lentil Fetoosh Salad.  Tried the one in Gilbert and have to say was disappointed some.  Got the cheese and fruit platter and was served with molded cheese which makes me wonder about the quality at this location.  Server picked off the molded cheese and said is that good.  Also had the quesadilla which was excellent.  Service was good although the plentiful staff just sat around and watched you eat.  I am not sure I would go back to this location based on the mold but I will go back to other locations."}
{"text":"Mediterranean like food is served here.  My big problem with the place was the big creepy (hat, tats, t shirt) guy standing by the bar staring across the restaurant through our whole meal.  As it turned out the creeper happened to be the owner.  Dialing down the creeper factor when you're at work (even if you own the place) is probably a good idea."}
{"text":"Not my favorite. Nothing wrong here just not for me. More along the line of a vegetarian spot. Not my cup of tea."}
{"text":"My husband took me here for the first time (he has eaten here before) and oh my gosh it was so delish!!! I got the chicken cheesesteak pita and the Pitas are so yummy!! Hubby got the Mediterranean pita and he loved it as well!!"}
{"text":"Over the past couple of months I have been working on adopting a healthier lifestyle when it comes to food. Pita Jungle was a great find for this. A lot of what they have there is very fresh and nutritious. The food tastes great and the service is good. It's near ASU so it can get busy at times. However, I've come here for one hour lunch breaks and was able to make it back to class without any issues.   I would say that if I had to catagorize Pita Jungle I would call it a Mediterranean leaning restaurant. While they do have some traditional items, a lot of it is not traditional. There are some great twists to some of the more traditional items. Most of the stuff that I've tried here has been great. There have been one or two things that were hit or miss. Hence the 4 stars."}
{"text":"just returned from a horrible visit @ Pita Jungle on Roosevelt & 3rd :(   Walked in the door about 5:45, 15 minutes left of \"happy hour\"... stood by a sign that stated, \"wait for hostess to seat you\"... so I waited for about 6 minutes as I watched staff in the cooking area joke and talk with one another.  Finally, a young man walked over and said, \"go ahead and seat where ever you want\".  So I sat for another 7 or so minutes.... a female server plopped down 2 menus and said she would be back to give me water... I asked if it was still happy hour and she said, \"yes, until 6:00\".... she never returned.  I waved my arms around just before 6:00 and asked for service.  Another person took my order.  Another 15 minutes went by and another person delivered the order.  After a while, I waved my arms around again to get the attention of someone to get napkins and more water.  My guest joined me around 6:30... the original server took her order which was received about 30 minutes later :( I was getting quite an arm workout waving my arms to receive attention.  It got close to 8:00 and the final arm waving was to request a check.  Another server brought it over. Never have had such poor service... ever.   The food is great but I will never return to this establishment."}
{"text":"Of all the Pita Jungle locations, this one is my favorite.  There is always cool art on the walls, and it's never over-crowder or noisy like the Scottsdale one.  I love their tsatziki and their mushroom burgers!  Their Mediterranean platter is probably my favorite for variety and value (it's also DELICIOUS).  The platter inclues hummus, baba ganoosh, tsatziki, taboule, feta cheese, dolmades, falafel and green beans with two pitas...and it always fills my tummy with happiness :D"}
{"text":"I came here a few times I always ordered burgers this time I decided to order Greek salad, however I was very disappointed to find lettuce in a Greek Salad, please google real Greek salad and see if it has lettuce Staff were nice, clean place and nice crowed. They also charged 39 cent for an extra pita. I think it's a little \"cheap\" not the price but as an attitude.  Overall I was happy with others food than mine. Still, I would go back!"}
{"text":"I meet my son here for dinner occasionally.  I have yet to be disappointed.  Two problems, though:  too noisy inside, and too little parking. ."}
{"text":"This place is always good but always packed - at least at this location.  The gyro definitely has  a lot of meat packed into it, and I always order an extra side of tskiti (sp) sauce.  The trio hummus with pita bread is soooo delicious."}
{"text":"I love PJ. The Cilantro Jalapeno Hummus is to die for. The Lentil Salad is wonderful. Actually anything I have ever eaten here is delish."}
{"text":"Had lunch here today and it was exactly what the tum tum ordered. Pita Jungle has been in my regular rotation for years now and I would recommend it to all.   My usual - Cilantro Jalapeno Hummus and grilled chicken.                   - Greek Salad                           Or                   - Lavosh Shawarma Wrap. Served with a side Greek salad.                           Or                   - The Caribbean Salad is a delicious change up!!!!!    I always wash it down with a Green Tea! They use a local company and I am always for localness.  :)  I have yet to run into a Pita Jungle hater. They have a ton of yummy items on the menu....something for everyone. The service is steller and the price is always right."}
{"text":"Not a good as it looked. I'm vegan so my options are slim elsewhere. I choose a salad that was plated with hummus. Way to much hummus. In every bite. The hummus was not that good. I couldn't eat it. But they were very accommodating and offered me another dish.  Much appreciated. Great service. But food needs a bit more flavor kinda bland. And pricey. I spent 40.00 for 3 people. No one had a drink all waters. Maybe it was an off day. It happens. But consistency is key. I won't go back. Don't mind paying for good food. But it wasn't good."}
{"text":"Their Happy Hour is sooooo cheap.  $2-$3 appetizers....say whaaat??  3-4 appetizers is definitely enough food for a girl.  I ordered 4 appetizers, only spent around $10, and even ended up taking home leftovers."}
{"text":"Pita Jungle is one of my all time favorite places to eat so needless to say, I am a regular at this particular location. I am a creature of habit so I tend to order the same thing a lot (delicious babaganoosh, lavosh pesto turkey wrap, grilled veggies, chicken..etc) but I must say that I have never been disappointed in anything I've eaten at Pita Jungle. The food is very fresh and they have plenty of healthy choices which is important to me.  The portions are large so I can split a meal or bring home left overs. The prices are fantastic for the amount and quality of food that you get.  The atmosphere at this Pita Jungle is fantastic.  I am a huge fan of sitting on the porch by the lake! In addition to that, I love the fact that the employees are encouraged to truly be unique individuals in how they dress and express themselves. I appreciate the diversity and ability to feel totally comfortable with my surroundings. There is one server in particular (Bo) that I have really been impressed with.  He (and the manager) have ensured that I have a positive experience with every visit. The service has always been outstanding as the employees and manager clearly care about customer service and make it their top priority.  I cannot recommend Pita Jungle enough...you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I have enjoyed going to Pita Jungle on a regular basis for a couple years but the last several times, I've gone to the new Ahwatukee location and have been more than pleased. It has a great ambiance, very friendly staff and fair prices. The servers are hard working and always tentative to your needs. If we have ever had an order come out wrong (which is VERY rare), the manager RC and GM Christine have been awesome in making sure we are taken care of and our experience is positive. We actually went yesterday with the kids and had Devon as a server...she did an excellent job! No matter what we order on the menu, it's always delicious. Some of our all time favorites are: baba ganoosh, hummus, mediterranean chicken salad, veggie & portobello mushroom burgers and the pesto lavosh turkey wrap!  I would highly recommend eating at Pita Jungle...specifically at this location."}
{"text":"*Mold Alert* It truly pains me to have such a bad first impression of this place, A. Because it's walking distance from my apartment and B. Because the menu looked so awesome I was looking forward to making it a regular place to come grub, however I am heart broken to report that we received moldy pita bread with hummus (photo attached) followed by defensive service... I would have been willing to add a star to this review but only one out of three employees was actually apologetic about the situation. One bearded man in an apron actually tried to insinuate that I couldn't tell the difference between mold spots and oven char, and then a waiter with a quirky mustache was a bit over dramatic in offering either a new piece of PITA (untoasted) as if somehow it would prove that mold didn't exist on the first piece. Look guys- mistakes happen and restaurants are hard to run, (I know first-hand about this as I have helped run one!) but the number one rule after inspecting food and cleanliness is to try not to insult the intelligence of your customer. The hummus, chicken schwarma and falafel were mediocre at best, and again,  I'm just sad, but it happened... I also recommend you guys clean your decor better because dust hanging over head is just as unappetizing as much as moldy bread. Thank you to the waiter who reminded me of Neal Patrick Harris for seeming genuine in his apology and stating \"omg, that's disgusting and completely unacceptable\" because it was. Double check your food folks. Adios!"}
{"text":"I go to Pita Jungle because everyone can usually find something they like or will eat.  I am not a fan as they have a very limited protein selection without a lot of high carbs added in. I guess this is supposed to be healthy.  The place is what I would call trendy. large open eating area that has lots of noise so it is hard to talk to anyone in your group.  The staff most of the time are very friendly but not always. At times they can be snooty and I feel as if I am not the type of cliental they want.  Yes I will be eating there anytime people in the group want to eat there."}
{"text":"Typically I really like Pita Jungle, but I guess that's b/c I stick w/ the tuna pita or hummus (great!).  However, on this trip I got the Chicken Tikka Masala, and is really bad.  Very little taste, dry and not at all like a real Indian Tikka Masala."}
{"text":"This location of Pita Jungle is by far my favorite.  Perhaps it is because I have been coming here for about 15 years.   Perhaps it is because the waitstaff is incredible.   Perhaps it is because their Happy Hour AND regular menu portions are larger than at the other locations I have been to.   Perhaps it is because they just have things figured out.  Perhaps it is due to all of that, and more.  The first thing I ever ordered at Pita Jungle was the Broiled Chicken Salad.  This was when the restaurant was 1/3 its size and you had to order from a counter in the back.  I used to tell all my friends in the Bay Area about this particular salad.  It is probably my second-most-often-ordered menu item today.  It is still THAT good.  These days, I most often come in for the Mediterranean Roasted Chicken (Shawarma) Pita.  It is quick, fast and filling.  And, have I mentioned, delicious?  Of course, I can go on and on about the food at Pita Jungle but... you've all been there... right?!    For those of you with kids, the kids meals are very generous and you can choose the protein, vegetable and side.  They also come with a drink.  For $5, you cannot beat it for a pretty healthy meal out!  I love the original Pita Jungle and even though I will probably not visit for awhile now that Ahwatukee finally has a location of its own... I will still cherish it."}
{"text":"I love Pita Jungle.  There's no denying that. If you read nothing else in this review, read this: Do NOT go to PJ on a Saturday for another couple months.  It is CHAOS.  Now that is out of the way, on with the review.  SERVICE: My server, Ahkil (pronounced like Shaquille, as he pointed out), was friendly, on top of things and as patient with the kitchen as humanly possible.  KITCHEN: The kitchen was so far behind that our order of two Mediterranean Roasted Chicken Pitas, which take no more than 10 minutes at every other PJ, took more than 50 minutes to get to us.  FIFTY.  That is FIVE TIMES the normal amount of time (for you math-challenged Yelpers).  BACK TO SERVICE: When we were seated, Ahkil stopped by immediately and said \"I will be right back.  I have to check on some food for the starving kids at the table behind you.\"  A-OK in my book.  Hungry kids = cranky kids.  I know this for a fact.    Later, when DH and I were starting to become the cranky kids, Ahkil asked the kitchen to make us ANYTHING (we found this out later).  I saw that the table next to us got a free order of hummus for waiting so long.  When one of the servers stopped by our table and asked if we wanted complimentary hummus and chicken while we waited for our food (at about 35 minutes in), I practically KISSED her.   DESIGN: I love the new dining room.  Above the kitchen there is an art piece that is reminiscent of the rolled magazine vase on the host stand.  Very cool.  The bar has what appears to be a \"color me in\" wall.  There are a lot of different lampshades hanging from the ceiling in the dining room.  The ducts are exposed and painted white.    FOOD: Typical PJ food, which is to say... AWESOME.  Of course, for some reason the chicken in my pita was cold.  I can't figure that out since it took so long to make it that I thought someone was actually PLUCKING the chicken.  Still, it was yummy and I ate everything except for the appetizer (which was redundant since we got the free \"please don't walk out\" app from the kitchen.  Let me reiterate: Let this place have a few months to slow down so they can figure out how to accommodate all those orders.  In the meantime, I will get my PJ fix at the Tempe location.  The first is really always the best anyway.  ;)"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that Pita Jungle is my favorite casual restaurant in the Phoenix area.  I go to Pita Jungle SEVERAL times a month.  That said, this location is seriously lacking in SO many areas.  I actually lived on the same block as this Pita Jungle for awhile.  I waited patiently for it to open, which seemed to take forever since I passed by it daily with its \"OPENING SOON\" sign mocking me.  I have eaten at this location about fifteen times, conservatively.  So, this review is a compilation of the last several visits.  First - don't order take out from this location.  Whereas the other locations in the Valley seem to replicate the dishes you see in the restaurant in your takeout container, this location skimps and gives you much less food.  I usually have to box up about half of my dish when dining in, but I can usually eat everything when I get it to go from this location.  Plus they tend to just throw everything into the box, making it look incredibly messy and unattractive.    Second - the wait staff routinely disappears on you... especially during happy hour.  Whereas in other PJs the waitstaff makes it a point to check in on you to make sure you can get your last orders in for happy hour, this PJ seems to want to avoid you at all costs.  I understand they make less tip money on the items; However, the quicker people get their food, the more food they will likely order.    Third -  when you're sitting on the patio in the Summer, you get forgotten (even though the host seats you).  This has happened to me on MULTIPLE occasions.  I understand it is hot outside.  If I choose to sit outside on a day when it is above 100 degrees, I should not be punished by having to sit outside longer than necessary.  When it is hot, I need more water, more frequently.  If you cannot make it outside, can you leave extra water?  Can I expect a waiter to actually come take my order within twenty minutes of me being seated?  If not, you need to close your patio in the Summer.  Fourth - they do not have a firm grasp on how to prepare the kids' menu items.  Not only are the portions MUCH smaller here than at ALL the other Valley PJs, but they are not the same.  Sometimes the chicken is the broiled chicken.  Sometimes it is some kind of chicken with a red hue.  Sometimes the mac and cheese is so runny it sloshes on the plate.  Sometimes it is a globby mess.  When DD orders broccoli at the other PJs, she gets a portion the size of an average man's fist.  At this PJ, she always get about three small twigs of broccoli.    Fifth - I know it is downtown, but your waiters should not have attitude.  There are plenty of more chic, more hip, more cool, more \"it\" restaurants all around town for those kind of servers to work at.    Most Recent Visit - We recently had a server who was really sweet and cute from North Dakota.  Of course, he forgot to take our order (he didn't see us out on the patio, but saw every other table) and then got my order wrong when he did take it.  We were also served 15-20 minutes after every other table on the patio (who were ALL seated after us).  We were dining with a 4 year old who was starving, sweating and at her limit by the time her food finally arrived (some forty minutes after ordering it... and it came after all the other entrees were served).    Overall, I do not recommend this location of Pita Jungle.  It is such a shame, too.  It is in a prime location and I have a lot of friends and business in the area."}
{"text":"Fresh tasty and healthy!   Have been here a couple of times and it was good both times.   *Seared ahi tuna salad with mixed greens, pineapple, strawberrys &  sesame seeds was delicious and the vinaigrette perfect for the salad.   *Hummus 3 ways with warm pita. These come \"regular\", jalepeno and red bell peppers and are soooooo good. Order it and thank me later!   *Gyros (pita filled with lambmeat, lettuce and tzatsiki). Also very good with tender well seasoned meat and nice sauce.   Prices are ok and the service level high. Popular spot so be prepared to wait for a table if you arrive on the busy hours."}
{"text":"Sorry I can only give this place two stars.  Not sure what's going on over there but the last several times I've been there they always seem to forget something on the plate.  For example tonight we got the Mediterranean platter and they didn't put any feta cheese on it like they were supposed to.  Last time we were there and had the platter they forgot to put the domaldes on.  When brought to the waitress' attention we were first told they ran out only to see other people who ordered after us get domaldes.  Also tonight i ordered the lavish shawarma wrap.  First time ordering it so when I got what they brought i didn't realize it was a chicken shawarma pita.  The chicken was dry and there was hardly any sauce that was supposed to be on there.  We. Had also askew that the platter be brought out first as an app only for them to bring out the shawarma a minute later so by the time we got to it it was cold. My last gripe is that they don't bring out the pita wrapped in tinfoil.  Not sure when this changed but they need to bring it back because the pita wee more like a cracker then what its supposed to be."}
{"text":"I really liked the place itself and the people working there, but I'm gonna have to say that the food is just ok.   I like the jalape√±o hummus appetizer, but everything else was just ok nothing spectacular."}
{"text":"Always love this place, great decor high energy and in crowd.   Great alternative to burgers and pizza and healthy on top of that. My personal favorite is the Philly Cheese Steak Pita, never can go wrong. Good size portion and juicy prime rib meat with all the toppings.  Service is always quick and friendly with reasonable prices and fresh high quality food.  Not the easiest location to find, but when you have a great concept, people will seek you out and come to find it.  Plenty of parking   Will certainly come back again"}
{"text":"Pita Jungle at Scottsdale Fashion Square Mall is a quick and healthy alternative to burgers and pizza.  I always get the Philly Cheese Steak Pita which is my favorite. The pita holds up very well with all the sliced steak, peppers, cheese etc. This quite a meal in itself and often turns into a second meal.  My daughter likes the hummus that is offered.  The mall location is busy there is plenty of seating and they are fairly quick.  Will be back here for more"}
{"text":"Love the Philly Cheesesteak Pita which is always a winner! Thinly sliced Ribeye Marinated with onions and peppers inside the Pita which is a great combination. Once you have had that it is difficult to eat there again and not order the same thing over and over.  We generally order the hummus and Shawarma which are both very good. It is difficult to share these items but maybe just take a bite so you could have a taste of different items.  The staff is very attentive and also there to fill your drink.  The restaurant offers a wide variety of healthy items including pizza.   Will be back again and recommend to others."}
{"text":"What's not amazing about this place? The food is amazing, drinks, and servers are usually great. Had a less than pleasing server 1 of the 5,000 times we've been there so can't take off for that. They have alternatives for your less than adventurous friends. Try the Med. Chicken Pita-- one of my favorite dishes!"}
{"text":"I really hate this branch of Pita Jungle.  I think this is due to the college-age hippie stoner slackers that dominate the staff.  I eat at the Pita Jungle in Scottsdale often and love it - worthy of at least 4 stars.  The Tempe branch - yikes.  Bad bad sloooooooooooooooooooow service. Maybe I am being overly harsh but my last experience here was so bad I actually walked out of the restaurant without eating my meal or paying.  After sitting there for over an hour, they managed to serve me the same cold plate of food twice (it was supposed to be hot).  And it wasn't  even that fact that I got served cold food twice that really ticked me off.  It was that no one there - not even the manager - seemed to give a shit.  Unacceptable."}
{"text":"Let me jump on the bandwagon and add my praise for Pita Jungle.  I love their new location and not just because it is in my 'hood.  It's open, clean and so far, there have been no service issues.  The food is relatively cheap and the portions are big.  I like the macro platter and the chicken wrap."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. We come here several times a month, and can't get enough. Like all Pita Jungles, their menu is excellent with delicious food that fresh and healthy, while not lacking one bit in the flavor department. They have a seasonal 'specials' menu that seems to get shaken up every few weeks, which is great and often some of the tastiest dishes are found on there.  This location has an awesome patio that is great most times of the year (the covering and misters make it almost bearable during the hotter months). I've never had bad service at this location. They are often extremely busy, and there can be a moderate wait time both to be seated and served at peak hours, but given the size of the crowd, it's understandable and hasn't been a big enough issue to bother me yet."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a lite lunch and some wine. A very good house Cab.and generous pour. The food and service was great, and even a little complimentary baklava and strawberries for the road. Always a great choice. You always feel like you really had something healthy rather than just something to fill the void."}
{"text":"$11.00 for a lettuce and couple of slices of tomato and cucumber salad???, are they kidding?. They gave us today a   very simple salad no pitta, no nice lettuce or greens, portion very small. Service was no great at all. Never again, next door in Sauce Pizza place is much better and less expensive."}
{"text":"Always a delicious, kinda healthy meal option. Very friendly to the vegan/vegetarian population.  I have enjoyed many different things at PJ.  My favorite has to be the falafel.  I enjoy adding their spicy chicken to salads.  Their pita bread is always light delicious and very fresh.  I'm truly a fan.  I to to the various Pita Jungles across the valley several times a year."}
{"text":"I always have had great service and absolutely love the food! Fresh, well prepared, and loaded with great flavors. Hummus and chicken is so yummy. Good wine list and beer too."}
{"text":"Why don't I eat here more? Awesome food and Gina was my server and she was awesome.  Had the hummus trio with pita chips and could have eaten them for a week. Atmosphere is meh but great food and great service."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in PHX and one of my overall favorites too. Healthy. Cool people. Eclectic atmosphere. Incredible food. Several entrees and sides are crave-worthy. Saut√©ed cauliflower I had with a special...simple as it sounds was insanely great. My go to is the Medchilada a Mediterranean/ Mexican burrito type thing that's huge! I normally plan to eat half and save the rest in the hotel fridge...and end up pigging out on the whole thing b/c it's so good!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this restaurant!  GREAT hummus selections.  Fun staff.  Very reasonable prices.  You'll definitely get enough to eat!  There's cool are inside and lots of great seating outside.  I love that everything is SO healthy and that it's like a little hippy haven in the middle of posh Scottsdale.  Location is great!  It's a great place for lunch or dinner, especially if you want to eat before hitting up Harkins!  EAT HERE!"}
{"text":"I bit into my falafel and felt something hard in the back of my mouth. IT WAS A METAL WIRE! WTF!?   Needless to say I wasn't interested in eating anymore of their food, told them that and that I wouldn't be paying and left. I'm not going to ever come back to redeem their token free entree gift card gesture either.  The little bit of the falafel pita that I had before that nice hard and metallic tasting wire was pretty awful too.  AWFUL PLACE."}
{"text":"Off the hook!!  Unbelievably good food, very reasonably priced, tons of variety, clever atmosphere, good service.  Really, just awesome.  Wish I lived in PHX as I'd be here 3x week, no doubt!"}
{"text":"Love the environment, the menu, and the service has always been great.  Nice sized portions and good appetizer options.  Our family enjoys eating here about once a week.  We enjoy the jalepeno hummus, dolmades, and most any other thing on the menu.  The food is fresh and tasty."}
{"text":"I eat at pita jungle at least once a week and at most about 3.  The Indian School spot is conveniently located between my apt and my work - a 10 mins drive from either.  My typical lunch there is the beef gyro ($6) with passion fruit ice tea which hits right on the money with my lunch budget - $10bucks. Sometimes i get a multiberry smoothie to go, which I highly recommend.  Its this lovely purple color, tastes of fresh berries, and its not too sweet - a healthy and refreshing alternative to desert.  I experience sudden inexplicable cravings for their beef gyro at times.  The meat is delicious, the pickle and tzatzikii compliment it so well... I'm getting cravings just thinking about it.  If you decide to get some hummus as a starter, I recommend the small order with 2 pitas (comes with 1) instead of the large order which seems better suited for 3+ people.  I had the seafood provencal from their seasonal menu yesterday, and it was so very delicious i was literally making yummy sounds (mmmm..!) after every bite.   Their lunch crowd has gone down in size recently, maybe because its so hot out.  The parking in that strip mall is hell during lunch time too.  There are various different lunch establishments and drivers can get pretty aggressive when they see a car pulling out.  The 2 seater tables they have inside are a little cramped.  I prefer more space between me fellow diners and myself and some of my heavier friends find it a little difficult to wedge between tables without interrupting seated diners. Also, forget about having a private conversation if there is a table seated next to yours. The tabletop is at capacity with 2 plates and 2 drinks.  The inside of this location has a huge mirror hanging that make it feel way bigger than it is.  It also brings in tons of light and lets you check out the crowd, or more notably, the hot hipster wait staff. That being said, I've never, not even during any super busy lunch rush visits, had bad or unsatisfactory service.  They run lunch rush like a well oiled machine.    One last thing, I am a very thirsty individual, and I love me some good iced tea, on a couple occasions I've been offered refills for my tea in to-go cups. I know its a small thing but, for me it goes a long way."}
{"text":"Great spot for a healthy lunch. Glad they had patio seating as the inside had a very high noise level.   Had the cold tuna pita. For me it needed a dipping sauce so I ordered a side of taziki and that was perfect! The chocolate covered baklava for dessert was excellent.   My spouse had the grilled vegetable salad and whole food vegans will appreciate it. It would be nice if they offered whole wheat pitas as an option. Also would like to see calorie count listed by menu items.   Enjoyed the good friendly service."}
{"text":"I am very disappointed after having lunch at Pita Jungle today. I met my two friends there at noon with my two small children for a quick 1-hour lunch as one of my friends needed to get back to work shortly. The three of us have been meeting at Pita Jungle for years. We all live/work close to the old Apache Blvd. location and followed them when they moved because we love their food. The new parking situation has been inconvenient, but we have never had a problem getting in and out within the hour to get back to our vehicles in time before receiving a parking violation. Today, I paid for parking adjacent to Jack in the Box at 12:07 after we were seated we ordered drinks right away and when our server, Laura, quickly returned with them we were still reading the menu. We chose our lunches shortly after and waited over 20 minutes for someone to come back. We went to the host desk to ask for our server to please come and take our order because we needed to leave soon. We had been there for approximately 30 minutes before our lunches were ordered. My two children did receive their meals very quickly and ours came out not long after. But we were in such a huge hurry to eat, pay and take our food to go that we got to the parking lot 5 minutes late and were being ticketed. I called to ask the manager if they could help me, after waiting so long to place our lunch orders. I spoke with the assistant manager (I forget her name) she was empathetic and put me on hold. She got back on the line and said her manager, Michael, said they can give me an entr√©e on our next visit. I was surprised that the response to our experience of waiting 30 minutes to order, having a limited amount of time to receive an entr√©e, eat it, pay and put remaining food in to go boxes to be 5 minutes late for parking and receive a $44 parking ticket was offering a meal that was worth at most $15. I told the assistant manager that I am a very loyal long time customer who eats there regularly and that my experience today couldn't be made up with a comped meal. She asked if I wanted to speak with the manager and I said that I was rushing to an appointment but she could take my name and number for reference and that I'd call back.  Later, I spoke with my friend who said she called and spoke to Michael and that he said, he \"looked at video footage of us coming in and leaving,\" that we \"sent our server away when she came to take our order\" and that we \"left within an hour of being seated\" and that he \"doesn't care if we take our business elsewhere\".  This is what my friend told me so maybe she will post with her words of what their conversation was. But this is basically calling us liars and telling us not to come back.   I do feel like I could have taken more responsibility when I received my food, I should have thought to ask for my check and to go boxes right away in order to get out faster. I also feel like I had expressed we were in a rush by that point and that my needs could've been anticipated. This is my first complaint EVER after eating at Pita Jungle regularly since I moved to Tempe in 2004. I just wanted someone to understand that today I had an extremely horrible experience, one that ended up being very expensive. I'm sad that Michael stated \"I don't care if you take your business elsewhere\", now I feel like I have no choice but to never eat there again. I can ultimately take responsibility being 5 minutes late and receiving a parking ticket. I am deeply upset about the lack of caring regarding this experience after I have been enjoying meals there for 12 years."}
