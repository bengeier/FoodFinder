{"text":"Went on Saturday night for a family dinner - 2 adults and 2 kids.  We were greeted and say promptly. Our server was very friendly.  The issues started with the food orders. One of the kids ordered a burger well done. It came out rare. The other ordered chicken fingers which were done correctly.  My wife ordered a salad with celery seed dressing.  The salad came out with rotten lettuce and a blue cheese celery dressing. Attempts to find any server for drink refills or to discuss food issues were non-existent. No one came to ask how the food was or if there were any issues. Food overall was a huge disappointment. When leaving, we told the hostess of our issues. She quickly tried to blame the server which was just part of the issue.  No attempt was made to correct the issues or bring it to a manager's attention. This is a place that should be skipped when looking for dining options in Westlake."}
{"text":"I wish I had read the reviews before trying this place. Like many others I landed here due to the long wait at the neighboring chains. What a god-awful experience. Anna was our server and after our experience, the least trustworthy server I have ever dealt with. My best advice ... stay away, stay far, far away.
Steak with gristle that clearly was not the strip steak it was reported to be, drowned in a commercial barbecue sauce that tasted more like KC Masterpiece than the house-made sauce I led to expect. And apparently they don't expect patrons to know the difference between \"espresso encrusted\" and dredged in coffee grounds. The mashed potatoes that accompanied the dish were gray and pasty, certainly not fresh.
My biggest disappointment was being lied to about the Cesar salad dressing being made fresh to order. Clearly not only was the dressing not made to order, but it was commercial as well. Apparently the server doesn't expect diners to know the difference between something that is properly emulsified and something that is thickened and held together with xanthan gum. The mistake of not including the croutons before the salad was served was equally grievous and lamely explained away with, \"Oh they don't it that way here.\"
I can not conceive of a reason why I would return to this establishment."}
{"text":"I went to this place on a whim. I had high expectations when I saw the menu. Unfortunately, that lasted as long as it took to get our food. I ordered the hot in Cleveland sandwich. It came dry and tasteless. My girlfriend got the chicken parm sandwich. The chicken was over cooked and the cheese wasn't all the way melted. How is that possible?

We talked to the sous chef who was the acting manager. He told me this place is owned by the people that own the boneyard. That place was a disaster and now I understand why this place was so bad. STAY AWAY. YOU'RE BETTER OFF GOING TO GET A BIG MAC. 

These owners do not care about their restaurants. Maybe after this one fails they can put another failure in the boneyard building."}
{"text":"To start....I have NEVER written a bad review in my life. I've worked in restaurants so I now things don't always run perfectly. My boyfriend and I were excited that a non chain restaurant that popped up and went there at 7pm on a Saturday night (yesterday).

1. Didn't have the wine I ordered ....ok no big deal

2. Didn't have the pretzel crusted chicken I ordered, was told that they HAD to take it off the menu because of some kitchen reason (scary) 

3. Boyfriend ordered the surf and turf with a baked potato 
     a. didn't have any baked potatoes
     b. Lobster was ice cold with some strange lobster part that should have been      removed before serving.
     c. Menu said it came with a filet and it came instead with some other cut of steak with fat all through it and around it.

3. I ordered the banana peppers, so cold that the shaved parm cheese on top wasn't even slightly melted.

The ONLY positive part of the experience was our server MIchelle, she was very nice and prompt. We actually gave her a very nice tip obviously because of her service but also because we felt horrible for her that she seemed embarrassed every time she had to deliver us bad news. 

P.S. If I had known the owners of The Boneyard owned this, I would NEVER had stepped foot in that place."}
{"text":"Have to go with one star, as this restaurant is CLEARLY a work in progress. We have been mourning the loss of yet another restaurant that we liked at this location (I think the Taverne is the 4th tenant in the 7 years we've lived in the area) and were glad to see something go in that didn't appear to be like everything else nearby. We gave the place a solid 6 weeks or so to get some of the bugs worked out before we gave it a try. Apparently we should have waited longer...

The place seems to have potential. Between the menu and the specials the night my wife and I were there, the Taverne offers a good number of options to suit most any taste. Unfortunately a review of the food will need to wait for our next attempt. 

So what were the issues? First, the wine selection is fairly pitiful. They offer one chardonnay, a sauv blanc, a riesling (guaranteed to not be dry-ugh!), and some type of blend that my wife said taste like the syrup that comes in canned fruit cocktail (she did not plan to sample it, but more on that later). I was in the mood for beer so I didn't really look at the reds, but the options looked similarly limited. I ordered a Stella Artois (a fairly ubiquitous brew these days). My wife ordered a glass of the (only) pedestrian-looking chardonnay. Before the server walked away to get the drinks my wife asked what the soup du jour was. The server said she didn't know and said she'd find out after she placed our drink order at the bar. 

The server returned a couple minutes later, empty-handed. Turns out they were out of BOTH the Stella and the chardonnay. I ordered a different brew and my wife's face turned red. She really only likes chardonnay (certainly given the lack of variety of choices) but asked if she could sample the SB and the white blend, which by the way were both more expensive per glass than the chardonnay. She liked neither, particularly the blend (see tasting note above). 

We grabbed our coats and left, returning to one of our \"regular\" go-to spots..."}
{"text":"Read all the reviews and was a little wary of visiting last night for dinner. While not perfect, it was a s pretty good experience. After  some initial confusion about our reservation, we were seated in the bar at high top  tables. The waitress was very  good, food was OK, plentiful and promptly served. My fresh Lake Erie sand was huge and flavorful.. Wine list was OK and fairly priced. Seven beers on tap in addition to a good selection of bottled beer."}
{"text":"Whenever I am in town, this is my first place to stop in for drinks or a bite to eat.  The food and drinks are vast and always good.  The bartenders are friendly and this feels like a home like environment.  I would recommend this place to anyone

I don't understand the crazy, negative responses that I am reading as I haven't had that experience at all.  I say, give it a shot, you won't be disappointed.  9 beers on tap, an array of wines and the bartenders mix up whatever I'm feeling at the moment!!"}
{"text":"They lost a reservation for 12, no problem, no other customers in the place. The crab cakes were cold inside, cold like the microwave wasn't working properly. The waitress didn't know an IPA from root beer. She came back and checked our orders, individually, at the beginning the middle and the end of the meal. Even then she couldn't get the bill completed properly. The manager was useless.  This was just pub food, how do you screw that up? It was possibly the worst restaurant I've eaten in in 20 yrs."}
{"text":"The apps and food is good here. Try the peanut butter burger; it's heavy, so go hungry!  It's also nice to sit outside when there's a nice breeze; such as last evening!"}
{"text":"I wish I didn't have to give this restaurant any stars at all!!  Please don't waste your time or money going to this place!!  The service was horrible and the food was worse!   
We went with no specific expectations.  We knew it was a new restaurant, but they were way understaffed, and there was no manager present.  For a new restaurant, I was very surprised at this!  
It took over 45 mins to get our food and we didn't get the salad we ordered.  The waitress never came back to ask if our food was okay or if we needed anything at all... However she did have time to chat with one of the other waitresses!!   
When we asked to have the salad taken off I did tell the waitress how displeased we were with the food and service so she sent the head waitress
to discuss it with us.   She was no help at all and she didn't even get our change right after taking the salad off our bill.  I guess she did not know how to operate the register??  
I have not been this upset after going to a restaurant in my life! They are clueless and know nothing about customer service. This place will not be open long!!!"}
{"text":"Taverne? More like cavern, with a few draft beers and a couple bottled. Don't come for beer. No, as a matter of fact do come for beer, because you shouldn't come here for food. Ribs? Burnt. Items on menu? Unavailable. $8 banana peppers? Two small ones. Sauce was good though. Not one supervisor or manager checked on our meal, even after sending back the ribs for something that was not much better. The waitress was great. The Long Island was \"different\". The salads were decent. Won't be open long. If I just opened a new place I would be checking with EVERY SINGLE PATRON. Finding out what needs work or isn't working, especially when customers are expressing unsatisfactory food. Can't see these guys open when next summer comes. Give me the investors phone numbers so I can get free money. RIP Manarros!"}
{"text":"This place sucks.  They are not professional. They have no idea in running a restaurant.  the bar sucks. the tv, s are not even set up right.  They have second rate games and jukebox.  The food sucks."}
{"text":"I never hate restaurants, this place is literally awful. It's way over priced and the food isn't good. The menu is all over the place and doesn't match the vibe in the place."}
{"text":"We've been there a few times and have ordered different food each time (haven't tried the perch yet, though). Everything has been either excellent, or very good. Pasta dishes, sandwiches, fish... love the extra dirty martinis with blue cheese stuffed olives. The staff is attentive and very friendly. The prices are comfortable also."}
{"text":"Grate service and food! Home made perogies and hamburger egg rolls are amazing! Everyone else at my table loved their meals as well."}
