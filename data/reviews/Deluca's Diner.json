{"text":"It's ok. I went on a week day at the end of breakfast, so it wasn't too busy. Still, service was scattered and the kitchen slow. 

I had a veggie breakfast burrito, the man had a more traditional breakfast. The burrito was .  . . edible. It was enormous, big enough to feed me for a day and still have leftovers. Inside a soggy tortilla I had mounds of scrambled eggs and about 2 pounds of vegetables - onions, peppers, avocado, tomato, hashbrowns, and then some. Most of the vegetables tasted very, very steamed, and then doused in grease. There wasn't much taste to them at all, and I love my vegetables. It makes me sad someone discovered a way to make them taste so uninteresting. On top of the whole affair was their spanish sauce (tomato paste?) and an unmelted square of orange cheese-like product. All in all, it didn't taste bad, but that's not high praise for restaurant food.

His breakfast was easily as big, and looked much better than mine tasted. The waitress got the order close, but not quite right, and he didn't have the interest to send it back. It was good, but too greasy for him to eat very much of it.

If it were cheaper I would say it was a good value. As it stands, I would go if someone really wanted to go there, but if its left to me there are many other places I'd go for breakfast first."}
{"text":"Under omelets, it said \"frittata\". So... is it a frittata or an omelet?

It's an omelet with lots of vegetables in it. So good with breakfast potatoes. 

There is a line to get in but it moves fast. It helps if you buy snacky stuff out on the street beforehand. We sat way back at the counter and it was perfect. Nice and quiet.

I f'n loved Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"This is the real deal. Long lines outside but be patient. Super busy, friendly service, and a great diner breakfast. The hot sausage is particularly good."}
{"text":"Unbelievably bad service to the point where it can't taste good enough to be worth it. Also coffee is literally hot water- just nasty and all decaf."}
{"text":"Passing by this morning I stepped through the crowd and went to the bar as per usual. Done this at least 5 times before presuming that people are waiting for a table which they usually are.  After five minutes of sitting there I was informed that I must go to the back of the line outside. So go and wait outside for a good 30 minutes for one seat at the bar?  At the time there were at least 10 empty seats at the bar.
I strolled on to Kelly's which is where I was originally going in the first place. Walked in, sat at the bar, had breakfast. It doesn't seem that complicated but times have changed apparently."}
{"text":"No trip to the Strip/Pittsburgh is complete without a pit stop at DeLuca's for breakfast!

First things first, you're going to have to wait in line to get seated, there's usually no way around it, but TRUST ME it's well worth the wait! DeLuca's advertises \"Best Breakfast in town\" and they strongly back up that statement with their food!

For people who live the fitness lifestyle like myself not eating what you want can be torturous! DeLuca's does however offer up some meals to suit fitness conscience people with offering their \"BodyBuilders Breakfast\". But you better believe that when I'm in DeLuca's it's time for a cheat meal! I usually go with a Hot Sausage, Egg and cheese breakfast sandwich on Manci's Italian Bread. Then I dive into an order on their amazing hot cakes! Usually the Rece's cup or Cinnamon Bun. 

Overall take it from a Yinzer and try this place out"}
{"text":"Great service, great food.
Perfect diner for those who want to take them time with breakfast."}
{"text":"I am not a fan of diners, but this place was great.  They don't win people over with high quality ingredients, but who cares when it tastes this good!  Service was great, seated right away.  Cash only.  Great breakfast burritos and sweet breakfast options."}
{"text":"Decided to give Deluca's a try one Sunday for lunch because we were on the strip and I was in the mood for breakfast/brunch food.  Overall, I'd have to say that I left thinking it was nothing special and, later, feeling like it was very overhyped, when I found out Deluca's is somewhat of a Pittsburgh Icon.

Food was ok, but I did find HAIR IN MY FRENCH TOAST.  Which of course, made things rather unappealing, even after a new order was brought to me.

Service was average to poor.  The server didn't seemed to be too shocked or sorry about the fact that there was hair in my food."}
{"text":"classic pittsburgh, i think. amazing crepes and fresh squeezed oj. crazy busy, so that's a good sign!"}
{"text":"Amazing. Best breakfast I have had in pgh. Awesome atmosphere and staff. Greek eggs Benedict is absolutely the best Benedict I have ever had. The only downfall is if you go after 10 on weekends you will have a 40 minute wait - well worth it."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I have been here and it seems to be pretty average overall.  The food was ok, but nothing spectacular.  I think it falls a little short of the hype.  Breakfast is a cherished event and we just expected a little more from the food and service.  Both were good, but definitely not anything excellent.  Chorizo was not that good.  Pancakes might be a better bet."}
{"text":"You just beat the food  here for breakfest.  The environment is also a treat if you have never been here.  The choices are more than ample and the servings are generous.  Give it a try and you won't be sorry."}
{"text":"After walking past the long Saturday lines numerous times, I brought the kids here on a week day.  Great idea.  No wait, and no hurry.  The pancakes were excellent..light, fluffy, and perfect.  The omelet with Chorizo?  Horrid, but I blame myself.   What was I thinking?  Like ordering oysters in Iowa.  

Good cup of diner coffee, and counter service was great.  Kids want to know when we're coming back...soon!"}
{"text":"Such a great place for food that is like making it from scratch! U won't be disappointed going here! Go early it gets busy cause it's that good."}
{"text":"DON'T BELIEVE THE OTHER REVIEWS OR HYPE!!! Came here while on a trip, and waited in line for about an hour. Finally, got seated in a dirty little booth near the back, where I had a constant view of a ridiculous ceiling fan (a box fan hanging from the ceiling). I'll tolerate a hole in the wall for good food, but this didn't even come close to delivering. The food was simply not good. I ordered a breakfast burrito that was looked as bad as it tasted, including the kraft singles artistically placed on top. 

Our service was nothing short of bizarre, I suspect drugs and I'm not kidding. The order came out wrong and the interaction was manic."}
{"text":"Last year began the tradition of going to DeLuca's every time my family visits from Minneapolis. The hotel we stay at (Homewood Suites) recommended it and they offer a free shuttle to and from it. 

The service is always welcoming and friendly. Our server, Nicole, was super sweet, personable and attentive. 

Last year I had an amazing omelet that spanned the edges of the plate. This time I had an egg and cheese sandwich on Mancini's Italian bread (the BEST bread in the world!) with their crispy home fries. My sister had pancakes that were bigger than her hand. They were perfectly  fluffy and slightly crispy on the edges. 

Best of all, the prices are very reasonable and all proceeds of any DeLuca's gift purchase (coffee mug, shirt, etc.) goes to non-profit animal rescues! (The menu includes a very important reminder to spay or neuter your pets : )"}
{"text":"They aren't kiddin when they say this is the best breakfast in Pittsburgh. This was my second trip and it just may become a tradition on every visit. This time I got the dessert pancakes that consisted of strawberry ice cream, chocolate chip pancakes, chocolate fudge and caramel sauce. It was amazing but almost too sweet (if that's even a real thing). It was tough to take down before the ice cream melted but I had fun trying! I highly recommend this place. Be prepared to wait a while to get in though. The lines are long but for good reasons."}
{"text":"Great local Pittsburghesque Diner.  I had delicious pumpkin pancakes with eggs and \"kielbasy\".  Very good, the kielbasy was not like any I had before, I suppose all kielbasa has it's own local flavor.

Interesting people watching, from the locals, tourists, tattooed staff and Pittsburgh's finest.   Everything is cooked behind a low counter - you can see all the activity - looks crazy back there.  The booths are not very comfortable, straight backed and Formica topped (adds to the charm?)  There is a strange mural on the wall, Greek mythology themed with Pan and others, labeled as a prop from the movie \"Passed Away\".

Really enjoyed it, would go back and recommend to others.  Fun and funky area to shop too."}
{"text":"Truthfully I don't understand what the whole hubbub is about this place. It's yummy for sure...some of the better eggs benedict and coffee I've had around these parts but an hour wait? Really? I went to Deluca's a few times (truthfully out of the urgings of a nytimes article) and was pretty disappointed each visit. It's just ok food, ok atmosphere, and bad service. 

Come to jersey I'll show you a good breakfast."}
{"text":"The breakfast burrito and Belgian waffle sundae were great.  The service was quick and the coffee was tasty and plentiful.  My only regret is that I didn't eat more.  If you get a chance it's worth a shot, the menu is very diverse."}
{"text":"I had really hopes for this place. We waited in line for about 20 minutes. A couple behind us told us it would be well worth it. Interesting enough, the wait has nothing to do with my rating. The food was disgusting. I had the chicken and waffle, which was simply not good.  When asked if I was enjoying my meal, I gave my honest feedback. The waitress was accommodating with replacing my meal with something else.  This time I chose French toast...playing it safe.  It was horrible...the worse French toast I've ever had.  The flavor was really bad and it was undercooked.  I had my husband taste it too and the look on his face was classic.  I can't even explain the taste other than BAD.  

Yesterday, we went to Pamela's which is around the corner.  It was delicious!!!! Considering people seem to compare the two, I thought De Luca's would be comparable.  NOT AT ALL."}
{"text":"I came here on a weekday for a quick after-work breakfast. I worked overnight and was starving. The place was pretty empty and we got our food quickly but it was pretty underwhelming. I got a Greek omelette that was mostly egg with one tomato slice, two leaves of spinach, and some bland chicken thrown in for good measure. I don't eat a lot of salt but had to add a ton. The salt shaker holes were crusted shut so I actually had to open it up and dump salt on the food. Next time I'll just make one at home. I would have been more disappointed if I had stood in line for hours"}
{"text":"Stumbled on the gem while at a convention in Pittsburgh. My group wound up eating there every day of the trip. The breakfast is the best I've ever had. You have to try the Mancinis raisin bread!"}
{"text":"came here after seeing Man v Food, and it was definitely a great place.  good hometown atmosphere with quality food. the 30 minute wait in the cold was worth it."}
{"text":"If you travel to Pittsburgh, you cannot leave without having Breakfast at Deluca's. This is a piece of Pittsburgh history, and the food/environment is truly wonderful! They are still running this place the way they did 50-years ago. Family run diner that is worth your time, and the small penny that it will cost for a large meal. I highly recommend going early on Saturday morning, grabbing breakfast from Deluca's and then exploring the Strip District."}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast location in Pittsburgh. Very friendly staff. The breakfast special which is served until 9 am is a great deal."}
{"text":"Love this place. Went in the morning and it was packed. Expect to wait 5 minutes or so when busy. The surprising part if your wait seemed forever, you get your food real fast!  I loved the Greek Benedict !"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place for breakfast in Pittsburgh. You can't go wrong with their pancakes or waffles! If you're going here on the weekend, you can anticipate that the line will be out the door. They are excellent about getting you seated as quickly as possible, so don't let it intimidate you too much!"}
{"text":"It was man v. Food that drew us to deluca's the first time, but it was the food that drew us back. We went for brunch, and the peanut butter hotcakes were the star of the show, while the rest of our party had the above average huevos rancheros and the somewhat disappointing French toast. Overall, we hope to come back soon."}
{"text":"There was a very long wait time on a Saturday morning. Took us like an hour before we were seated.

The Italian veggie frittata omelette tasted average. It was very greasy and lack of flavour. However, the MOAB burrito and apple cinnamon pancake were amazingly delicious.  The MOAB burrito has lots of flavours with many filling inside the soft tortilla. The apple cinnamon pancake was very fluffy and soft. 

The server was unfriendly with a poor attitude and she took a long time to re-fills the coffee.

Overall, I think this place is over hyped. But we did enjoy the food except for their poor service level."}
{"text":"Came on a Friday around 1130, not too long of a wait. Our server was very nice and the food was good! No complaints from anyone in my group. I'd love to try the pancake sundaes next time!!"}
{"text":"Surprised they didn't open earlier in a Sunday but it was worth the wait to get in. 

Always want to try something new but couldn't pass up on the eggs Benedict.  The sauce is consistently the same and the Mancini bread has something to do with the experience I think. 

Sometimes the eggs get overdone but one of the most consistent places for Benedict."}
{"text":"Great food! Really good coffee. For the price you get an incredible amount of food. I wish I was in town longer to go again."}
{"text":"Greasy spoon is defined by a trip to Deluca's After several visits i realized I needed to be hungover to enjoy it. Sorry, but the P&G diner around the corner puts it to shame."}
{"text":"At first glance, it looks like any other typical grungy little diner.  Until you try the food - absolute heaven.

Had the cinnamon french toast with scrambled eggs - the french toast was hot and chewy and sweet, but the eggs... OMG, the eggs.   Best I've ever had.  Seems silly, but very few know how to make them well.

All the dishes looked great - smelled yummy and were HUGE.

Long wait in line, and cash only - but definitely will be back"}
{"text":"While the severs themselves have gotten noticeably better, the kitchen staff is still lacking. On 2 different occasions my MOAB breakfast burrito has been served without meat. The meals have been coming out cold and staggered, whereas some of your party will be half way done before everyone gets their food."}
{"text":"Having been raised in Pittsburgh, I went to this establishment for breakfast with my father. There were flies everywhere (I actually swatted one with my menu).  Two flies were mating on our table... After a very long wait, I picked up my fork, which was covered in crusted food remnants, which lead me to a request for another.  Then, I cut into my scrambled eggs to find a plastic liner from a new ketchup bottle inside of my eggs!!!  I pushed the food to the side and watched as my father ate his food.  I will never be back."}
{"text":"Waited 30 mins for a table, which is apparently normal, was seated in a booth. Ordered the danish cakes with lingonberry preserves, companion had cinnamon bun pancakes with a side of eggs for both. Total cost including tax + tip was around $20. Great place, fun decorations/pictures!"}
{"text":"I used to think Pamela's was the best breakfast in town, until I came to this place.  Amazing."}
{"text":"Nothing special at all!!!
 When my husband and I walked in, the waitress was serving coffee to a customer. .she shouted, \" be with you guys in a minute\"  she then gave us 2 menus and pointed and said, \" sit at that table\"     What hell?!!!
Crazy rude and loud! I also saw a server at the register handling money and then go prep toast without washing her hands!  Yuk"}
{"text":"After years of living in Pittsburgh I finally came here with a camp-anion before she left town as she had never eaten here either.  We showed up to the door and we waited, and waited.... and waited.

The line was out the door and up the sidewalk, mostly people out of town.

We finally get in and to be honest I was ready for a let down another over hyped place that relied on its name rather than its food.  Thankfully I was wrong!

Menu is quite large there are alot of breakfast staples and some new twists on classics so there is something for everyone.  People are packed in a bit tight but I guess it beats waiting in line longer.

I got a eggs bacon and pancakes and my companion got the California omelette and a milkshake.  Food came out pretty quick and was really good and the portions were generous.  

Definitely lived up to the hype and was high quality diner food.

Only let down was it being cash only.  I know its Pittsburgh and some places that still dont accept credit cards but for a place that is pretty centrally located and has people flock to from out of town I think they need to get with the times and fork over that 2% to the credit card companies."}
{"text":"Nice little greasy spoon with a line of people waiting to be seated. French Toast and Eggs Benedict were good, as were the potatoes. But bring cash since they don't take debit/credit cards."}
{"text":"Love the pumpkin pancakes here! They are the best pancakes I ever had. My husband got the breakfast burrito and raved about it. There is a bit of a wait because it's so popular, but this place is a classic and not to be missed!!!"}
{"text":"Had the Italian Veggie, Border of South omelette, and Mediterranean Wrap. 

Sorry, in conclusion, I won't be back. 
Food was OK, the South omelette was pretty good, but not  something to wait for over 30 min after ordering and pay $10 each. I was so embarrassed taking my parents who were visiting me from a country over 6500 miles away.

Place was packed but didn't have a long waiting line outside on a Sunday 8AM right before Memorial Day.
The couple seated after us were half done with their meal when we asked what happened to our order, and not even a \"thanks for waiting\" or \"sorry to keep you waiting\" look? And no bag to put the box in for left overs when another table gets one? Not a kind of service I would go back for.

Giving two stars simply for the one good omelette. If not, one star for this business."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed our trip to Steeler town and eating at this diner.   Don't expect to lose weight after this outing but that goes without saying when you visit a diner.  Try the seafood eggs benedict or any of the other items as I do not think you will be unhappy.  Another nice aspect of eating here is the ability to burn some of the calories you consumed by visiting the many shops and businesses nearby- they go on for blocks

Vibe:  It is a diner!  Check out the pics on Yelp
Service:  No complaints- cooked as requested
Food:  Not gourmet, but very good!"}
{"text":"Had sea food omelette and it was really good. Portion size was humongous. All of us loved it. Probably not the healthiest thing to eat but if you are in a mood to just go hog.. this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Older diner in the Strip District. Pretty busy on Sunday (game day), prepare to wait a while. Food was good, service was good. I had Steel City Breakfast of Champs, plenty of food for most. Bacon had a great smokey flavor to it! Try the fried chicken with the breakfast."}
{"text":"Stopped in this morning waiting for Ikea to open. There was a very short wait and we were seated very quickly.

I had the seafood omelet with egg white, home fries and wheat toast. The omelet was packed full with seafood and topped with fresh slices of avocado. Very tasty.

I would definitely return to this location."}
{"text":"I'm not saying Delucas is McCormick & Schmick's.  I'm just saying if you want a great diner breakfast without the frills you will not do any better than Delucas.  Somehow, every time we head back to the 'burgh to visit, we end up having breakfast here.  There's a reason for that long line down the sidewalk on Saturday mornings.  (Don't worry the line moves fast and it is worth waiting for.)  What am I doing here?  Wait.  Can I change my review and say the place stinks?  That way I can keep it all to myself  (-:   

(Too late.)"}
{"text":"Awwww yeah, the best breakfast burrito on the planet.  The rest of the breakfast is great and all, but this badboy literally weighs in at about 2 pounds of bacon, eggs, hashbrowns, cheese, sausage, and onions.  It's all topped off with cheapo enchelada sauce from a can, adding to the white trash ambiance.  It's remarkable."}
{"text":"Awesome food. 

I mean....awesome. 

I would totally give this place five stars, but ...
a.) I had to wait in line outside in the freezing cold for an hour to even get a table. 
b.) the service was pretty terrible

I would normally take off two stars for that, but the food was THAT good. 

I ordered the Huevos Rancheros and Lobster Bisque Soup. mmmm."}
{"text":"One of the best breakfast joints in Pittsburgh is now open in Robinson (across the street from IKEA). Awesome service,  incredible food and huge portions round out my favorite new breakfast spot. Pancakes are massive and HOMEMADE (not a store bought mix, like most places). Bacon is nice and crispy and is great on your breakfast plate or your BLT! The huge menu can't be beat, so if you can't find something to fit your fancy here... check your pulse. Huge thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Lucky find of the week.  We stumbled onto this gem just by fate.  We were hungry and did not know where to go, so we followed a couple of kids into this place and I am sure glad we did.  There was no line or wait we got in and out increadibly quick.  The server was very nice and the Breakfast Burrito had this delicious sause covering it.   My girl got an omlette with fetta cheese and spinach.  We watched the cook make it using fresh spinach and fetta."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat breakfast, hearty portions and just plain good food. Their omelettes are huge and delicious, been there over a dozen times haven't had a less than great meal yet!"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I loved the food and the service. It it definitely a great place to go if your an out of towner and what to get a feel for the Pittsburgh culture. They give you more than your money's worth. The pancakes are delicious."}
{"text":"Do you like hot garbage and rude service? If you do then come here to eat. Food is not cooked properly. If you ask for anything cooked more, they become very upset.  I have never had such a bad experience. If I were to describe it in one
 word it would be DISGUSTING!!"}
{"text":"Deluca's isn't a IHOP you pull up park and stroll in. The Strip District has parking, but you'll pay to park and walk to get to Deluca's. I saw people standing in line waiting to eat while jackhammers were chipping up the sidewalk a few feet away. That kind of devotion says it all!

The food was good, the service was great. The food isn't greasy or nasty. The menu choices are unique. I would eat there again. I would recommend eating there on weekdays to avoid the crowds. 

Pittsburgh's Strip District has some great places to shop and wonderful foods to purchase. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this popular breakfast spot.  While the long line did move fast, you feel pressured to get in and out and therefore are not able to relax and chat with your party after finishing your meal.  Portions are way too big.  Food is not bad, but not good.  I would not go here again by choice."}
{"text":"Deluca's is your typical hole-in-the-wall.  It can get a tad smoky, not the cleanest, the line is always long- out the door and down the sidewalk, and I've never personally had the greatest service BUT they do deliver when it comes to the food.  We always leave satisfied and have yet to be disappointed!

Love the mixed grill along with a side of pancakes......"}
{"text":"I came here for a Saturday brunch. The line wasn't too long, but we still waited for about 20 minutes. 

The menu is huge, so it was hard for me decide what to get. I ordered South Of The Border while my friend had french toast with scrambled eggs and bacon. The black tea and lemon he had was good, though it was probably because I never had tried them together before. His toast was good, but he wasn't so happy with the food overall.  Not because they're bad, but you expect getting better food than what you can cook at home. I was happy with my omelette and their home fries. The chorizo really spiced it up. I don't like the salsa or ketchup on it though. 

The service was quick once we were seated. It took a while to get our food. Would I come back again? Yes if I don't need to wait."}
{"text":"Awesome diner experience! The line was out the door, so I expected a great meal. We waited about 15 min on a Saturday morning before we were seated at the counter. We received coffee and water quickly. The coffee was good and our cups were full the entire meal, thanks to great service. 

I got the mixed plate with poached eggs. Definitely lived up to its hype on Man vs Food. Perfectly grilled veggies, crispy potatoes and the runny yolk. Each bite was great. Definitely filled me up! Also had a few bites of hubby's French toast. It was soooo good! Thick, custardy and chewy. Loved it! 
 
We had a great Pittsburgh experience here!"}
{"text":"I've gone to Deluca's multiple times in the past few years and every time it's delicious! There are an extensive number of breakfast options that are really great, depending on what you are in the mood for. They have stacks of specialty pancakes with extravagant toppings and tons of other, more savory options. Watch out and plan early to come, cause the line is always out the door!"}
{"text":"Been there several times and I keep going back. They have a great selection of breakfast entrees and they are all good. Wait in the line that extends outside it is well worth it."}
{"text":"We brought in friend's from out of town after talking about how wonderful this place was....never again will we come. We are still sitting here an hour later and have had to request...TEN...yes TEN forgotten ordered items at least three times. As we were paying our bill our waitress, Mary, brought over the eggs and bacon that she already charged us for...:-("}
{"text":"Our server was incredibly attentive and polite. I accidentally ordered eggs that had ham in them (  vegetarian) and our server traded it out at no charge. My dining partner and I assured him that we would pay for the extra dish because it was our mistake--and said dining partner even ATE the offending eggs to prove it. Still, no charge. We left a sizeable tip to compensate the place, which was our meager compromise with ourselves. 

Still, the food was only so-so. My omelet was overly greasy, as were the potatoes. Great service, fun atmosphere, but my experience with the actual food was nothing spectacular."}
{"text":"Ten stars (if I could). I was surprised by the line at the door, but super curious to see what the fuss was all about! I had the waffle combo, and ordered a side of peanut butter (as I always do). Our server, Kim, was unbelievably helpful and personable...even surprising me by bringing lingonberry for me to try with my waffle (so good!). DELICIOUS COFFEE!! 10/10 would come here again- even on a game day. Worth the wait! Yumm."}
{"text":"This will be the last time we visit.   The service was slow and not welcoming.  It took too long for us to order and even refill our coffee.  Waitresses had attitudes that you can see with each other just sitting at the bench area. Totally dis functional.   Once the food finally came, we had burnt but yet undercooked potatoes and burnt with undercooked bacon.   How is that possible ? Not evenly cooked at all!!!  While watching the waitresses, they would take orders touch everything then go and put bread on the toaster!! No hand washing!!!!  Needless to say we didn't eat our toast once arrived.  Once we are done it took 5 mins standings at the register for someone to check us out since they seem to not help each other.   Sorry delucas but we will not be back. For 30 dollar breakfast I expected a lot more."}
{"text":"Who complains when they have a belly full of Deluca's Pancakes??
This place rocks!! 
On a recent trip back east, I was able to try this restaurant. We love trying and going to small diners that provide great food, large portions and a manageable prices.
I had the warm apple pancakes....OMG....so so good.
Try anything on the menu.....its all good!!
Def new fav in the Strip District!"}
{"text":"I really did not get what all the hype was about.  The food is ok.  I had eggs, sausage home fries it was fair nothing spectacular.  

The inside looks like it has been cared for since the place opened."}
{"text":"Visiting Pittsburgh and came across this gem. Breakfast is my favorite meal of the day and I am hard to plead. But this was the best breakfast that I have ever had. Whenever I come in town for a game, I will enjoy breakfast here."}
{"text":"Deluca's is becoming a regular haunt for us.  Why? you ask.  Well because the food is amazing!!! Huge sevings.  Friendly service.  My only pet peeve, and the reason for 4 stars, is I have yet to have an entire order come to the table at the same time.  It's always staggered and someone (whether a party of 2 or 5) has to wait for their food.

But the food is so worth the wait!!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome food, great environment for a weekend breakfast diner. Service is good, with friendly people.  Every item on this menu is fantastic.  I love their breakfast burrito, they have a great Western omelette, chocolate chip pancakes are light and fluffy topped with powder sugar, some loose chocolate chips, and just the right amount of chocolate melted inside that theyre not too sweet, but syrup unnecessary.  They have great coffee, which for coffee snobs like me and my girlfriend, a good breakfast place has to have.  We have been down to the one in the Pittsburgh's Strip District which is the original, however with the seating a little small, and the line usually wrapping down the sidewalk on weekends, we decided to try the Robinson one which is located in the Robinson Town Centre in the Plaza across from the IKEA and next to the IKEA pickup center.  This location seems to be setup better seating wise, and with the added ability to check -in and then wait in your car or the benches they have out front, much more comfortable than the strip district location. If you're headed out to the Robinson Town Centre to do some shopping and find yourself looking for a place to have breakfast, forget IHOP or Eat'nPark check out DeLucas!"}
{"text":"I had a breakfast burrito here. 

It hit my stomach like a bomb.

Avoid the breakfast burrito.

Regardless, I really loved the ambiance here. It's greasy, it feels like it's 1972 and the servers are awesome."}
{"text":"The pancakes, oh sweet calorie-laden goodness! Probably the best I've had in my life - and this is not an overstatement. We had a lunch plate (turkey triple decker) and a breakfast plate (short stack special). Both were excellent. This place is cash only and can have a line, but walked up at 1:45 and there was no line (there had been a good line at noon). The other reviews said the wait was worth it and though I didn't wait, I completely agree. If you're in the strip, eat here."}
{"text":"Eaten there several times. Always excellent service and food. Clean bathrooms.  Priced right, more food than I can eat."}
{"text":"This place is a very good choice for breakfast. The food was delicious and very filling. As far as I could tell the service was ok but it was memorial weekend during the middle of a large race with a very large group of people. In conclusion, this restaurant is a very good choice for a family breakfast."}
{"text":"Well... this is the famous Deluca' s with big portions and old school 50's diner feel. They're right. Very old and run down but the service is good and the food is too. Large portions and huge menu selections. Cash only so if you're using cards on your trip and you want to come to Deluca 's get cash."}
{"text":"Used to be regulars.  Decided to try again yesterday and the place has gone down hill.  They would not accommodate a special menu request to sub turkey sausage for hot sausage.  Also potatoes came out burned to a crisp.  Not even edible.  Won't be going back there any time soon.  Guess I'll have to find the \"best breakfast in the burgh\" elsewhere."}
{"text":"We usually love this place, been to Deluca's four times.  But the service today was terrible.  Our waitress took forever to take our order, and then in the middle of taking it, she left to go deliver other customers food.  Took her 10 minutes to get back to us to finish taking our order.  In the meantime, all of our drinks were empty and she didn't even notice.  We had to ask for refills.   All in all, even though the food is good, we may never be coming back.  The service is just unacceptable."}
{"text":"Honestly I don't understand where these great reviews are coming from. This restaurant is filthy, our food was dripping in grease (how can a turkey sandwich be greasy?) and I found a hair in my salad. We got lunch food so maybe the breakfast food is better but it can't make up for the filth!"}
{"text":"So far the best breakfast place in Pittsburgh! Try their egg Benedict"}
{"text":"I was told you must visit Deluca's, we had to do take out because of the long line and and time constraints. I had the blast blt with the Cajun fries. I was not disappointed, very good food! Can't say to much else because of doing take out, but just from seeing the line to get in, plan accordingly."}
{"text":"The staff is nice but the food doesn't match the price. I had the veggie burrito and the people with me had another of their breakfast burritos and pancakes. None of us really enjoyed our food. The door signs say it's the best breakfast, but I would give this place a pass and check out Pamela's or Coca Cafe for the best breakfast in Pittsburgh"}
{"text":"Went for breakfast and wasn't impressed at all.  The people who work at DeLucas are not friendly and have a you should be happy I am serving you attitude.  If you are not a morning person then you shouldn't serve breakfast.  A smile and a good morning goes a long way.

The food was mediocre, greasy and lacking flavor. I ordered the California Omelette and it was something I could make at home with better flavor.  The chicken in the omelette had no taste and it was overlooked.

Overall, I don't get the hype.  This is similar to a greasy diner.  Pamela's is the place for breakfast."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good for a diner, but definitely not worth the wait... the service was terrible (somewhat rude, but more disorganized than anything)

After waiting in line for 40 minutes, we sat down and were told that the cook needed to catch up on orders... 30 minutes later we saw a waitress behind the counter taking orders from people who just sat down. when we asked if we could place our orders, we got a pretty rude/sassy lecture along the lines of  \"didnt we already tell you that the cook was catching up on orders\"  *(yeah, you told us that THIRTY MINUTES AGO... for real...how longs it take to make eggs?)..  when we pointed out that people that just sat down were having orders taken, our waitress asked the cooks and apparently it was ok.... after 30 additional minutes... average pancakes and eggs came out.

again... 1 hour and 40 minutes for so-so pancakes/eggs with a side rude waiters that had no idea what they were doing. 

Save yourself a few hours and go to Ritters"}
{"text":"I am committed to my all or nothing reviews so unfortunately Deluca's gets the short end of the stick because if they were in a different neighborhood they may have gotten 5 stars, but not in the strip.  I liked Deluca's food and selection, but their booths are the most uncomfortable seating I have had in years.  Deluca's is one block away from Pamela's in the strip.  Comparing the two: Pamela's food is better, their prices are lower and the seating is much more comfortable, Deluca's menu is larger, both have long waits on weekends.  If you are in the strip, there is no reason to go to Deluca's, go to Pamela's."}
{"text":"I went with the egg, cheese, and ham sandwhich with the lobster bisque soup. Since it was early afternoon I wanted more of the brunch feel. The sandwhich bread was well buttered but small compared to the large portion of egg, ham and cheese. The ham slab was overwelming so I removed at least half. Next time I will stick with just the egg and cheese sandwhich. 
Cash only policy was a totally let down but the prices were good since its a dinner."}
{"text":"Filling, fried breakfasts don't get any better than Deluca's. I was tempted to go here by the Pittsburgh episode of Man v. Food. My wife, her friend, and I got there early, around 8:00 on a Saturday morning, which was a bit painful on the weekend, but I am very glad we came when we did. Although we were seated immediately upon our arrival, by the time we left, an hour later, the line to get in was half way around the block!  Our waitress was extremely friendly, which was reassuring, because I think that waitstaff in popular, crowded establishments can be off-putting at times. However, ours was prompt and helpful. The coffee and water refills kept on coming.

I ordered the grilled vegetable platter with chorizo, which was absolutely humongous! The chorizo was in patty form, nicely browned, and just a bit spicy. I got some hot sauce and poured it on. The vegetables were amazingly not greasy, but steamed on the griddle. It was mostly onions and peppers, as far as I can recall. I thought, \"My God. This is ridiculous.\" However, a few minutes later, I had thoroughly disgusted myself by eating 
the entire thing! I may have loosened by belt by the time I was done.

My recommendation: Go early. Go big. There is a \"healthy options\" portion in the very extensive menu, but why do this to yourself? It would be like ordering a hot dog in a seafood restaurant. This is Deluca's. It's busy, legendary, and unique. Live it up!"}
{"text":"Got a breakfast burrito. It was one of the better breakfast burritos I've had but the sauce that they put on it was disgusting. The menu called it Spanish style but it was more like watered down ketchup. Next time I'm definitely asking them to hold the sauce. Service was quick although I wouldn't necessarily call my waitress friendly. She was a bit snippy and seemed angry that we needed more time to look at the menu. We were there on a weekday morning and the place was fairly empty so I'm not sure why she was upset that we weren't ready to order the second we sat down. The woman who cashed us out when we went up to pay was nice and gave us a coupon for $1 off our next visit when I donated to the charity bucket at the register. Good food, adequate if slightly surly service, plenty of options for brunch? We'll be back someday. Not good enough to be worth fighting weekend crowds bit this might be our new weekday breakfast place."}
{"text":"Great spot!  If you're thinking big,greasy breakfast...this hits the nail on the head.  Get there early otherwise expect to line up outside.  Service was good, food was awesome.

Try the MOAB for something different, the egg, chili, hash brown, avocado, banana peppers, onions make a great combination of flavor.  2.5lbs of tasty goodness.

Next time in Pittsburgh will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Recently visited a friend in pittsburgh and she decided to bring me here. We got there around 1 on a Sunday afternoon aka Peak brunch time. So we had to wait in line for a little bit but wasnt more than 10 minutes. When you walk in they have a sign  stating \"best breakfast in town' and yeaa it prob is. 

the food- yumm. I ordered an egg white veggie and cheese omelette. Came with a side of toast and homefries. And a banana choc chip pancake. Soo good. I'm not a fan of homefries but I Finished everything else all by myself haha. 
My friends ordered pancakes, scrambled eggs, homefries and loved their food as well! Plus can't complain about the unlimited coffee. 

Portions are big, service is good, and food is yumm. If i were in pittsburgh again, I'd def go back!"}
{"text":"Amazing!   We were a party of two. Probably could've been seated sooner as no one seemed to want to sit at the counter in the back, (definitely check with host to see if available).  We loved it as we could watch the cooks in action!  I had the seafood omelette with hollandaise and avocado on top, ask for it without the roasted red pepper.  My waiter came up with the recipe, minus the pepper.  They added it for some reason, but I feel took away from the taste sensation.  Had the Italian toast and ordered a side of the lingonberry preserves to share.  It was incredible!!!  Highly recommend this fun experience!"}
{"text":"The best place to get breakfast in Pittsburgh! Food is always nice and hot and made to order. The only accept cash payments no cards. They are extremely busy on weekends so if you do go then prepare to wait."}
{"text":"Unfortunately I cannot even comment on the food since I never got to see the menu or sit at a table. The front service was HORRIBLE. Slow, slow, slow. At least 5 families were waiting with 3 tables cleared. And when I say cleared, I mean wiped down with the same rag without being washed out. Everyone waiting was complaining about the wait and incompetence of the two people taking names and cleaning the tables. If you are looking for a diner experience that has some pep in their step to seat you, this is not the place to go."}
{"text":"This was my first visit. I've always heard amazing things about Deluca's, so we were excited to dine there. After my friend ordered a coffee, we noticed that they kept the dairy creamer on the table. In fact, they were on all the tables. Although this was unsanitary, I could honestly look past it if they're being changed often. Well, when he opened the container, we noticed mold on the inside of it. When my friend asked our server, Jess, for more cream, she took it, filled up the SAME container & brought it back. She clearly didn't pay attention to it.

Our server, Jess, was not personable and barely stuck around to see if we had everything we needed. They really weren't busy, this was post lunch rush. I ordered a breakfast meal... Jess brought our food and my pancakes were still going to take a minute, which is absolutely fine. However, I watched my pancakes come up in the window and sit there for 8-10 min while Jess sat at a table and talked to 2 men. She even went back to the window while the pancakes were sitting there and ran other food. She totally forgot about them. When she finally did bring them to the table, they were luke warm. Needless to say, I was very unsatisfied. The rest of the food was decent, though.

What Jess didn't realize is that she was waiting on 2 people in the food industry (my friend is a manager & I'm a server). I could have forgiven all of the mishaps if I felt like Jess honestly cared about our visit. No one is perfect & mistakes happen, but she showed no remorse and consideration for us. I will not be returning to this location."}
{"text":"I've been to Delucas a couple times before and it's always been good. I tried going this morning and was seated by an unwelcoming host/server. A guy came over and asked what we would like for drink. When he brought the drinks, he just sat them down and walked away.. No straws! (I can't stand that.) After waiting 10 minutes for him to come back, we just left. Not sure what the hype about this place is."}
{"text":"While my mixed grill was OK, it was nothing I couldn't make at home.  I was expecting bigger flavor.  
The 2 stars come from the HORRIBLE service.  I get it - greasy spoon, yinzers, etc.  But c'mon....45 minutes to make some eggs?  the dumb waitress said \"they're a little backed up\".  Well, yeah, but c'mon.  We were there WAY too long.  It kind of ruined the rest of our day. 

This isn't the best breakfast in PGH by any stretch of the imagination.  It was fine for what it was, but the terrible service = not returning.  I have better things to do during my trips to Pittsburgh then wait around for breakfast."}
{"text":"Deluca's dinner had great food at least for my non vegetarian friends... They didn't have a great vegetarian selection but they had some great and really soft pancakes ... The quantity was massive and I wasn't able to finish... The building had a nice ambience and an old restaurant vibe and the waiters are really polite and helpful..( In case you can't finish they'll give you a box so you can take the food back home ).."}
{"text":"Service was slow and there was a long wait because it was a Sunday. The food was outstanding. There was a fantastic selection and I had Greek Eggs Benedict which were incredible."}
{"text":"Why is this only a 3?  This place is a gem. You are greeted like family and the staff is fun to watch. The choices are fantabulous, the portions will require a nap afterwards. If you are hungry, they have 6 egg omelettes...4 egg is the NORM. Hand cut steaks. 
Making my choice was the hardest time. Your coffee/water never empty. 

Glad I tried this local venue. Home run"}
{"text":"This place is what you call a legendary spot! The line was out the door and around the corner when we arrived. I never seen a place with a line that long in my city. It was worth every second of the wait! The  omelettes are packed with flavor and a generous amount of toppings! Loved every bite love the service and the entire atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Nice food but really oversold.  It has everything you can try but really not up to the par everyone raves about.  I'm vegetarian so options might be limited but not that impressed.  Home fries are good but really unhygienic when you see these guys making it.  No reservations so have to stand outside."}
{"text":"The waitresses were more interested in talking to each other than waiting on tables. Once they took our order the food came fast and was good."}
{"text":"I understand that sometimes when a restaurant becomes an establishment, it's more about the experience than the food. But I still don't see why Deluca's is so popular. I got a breakfast burrito that was filling but pretty underwhelming and a sauce that was too sweet for my tastes. The rest of my party had things like corned beef hash and pancakes that didn't stand out from any number of other diners I've been to. If I had their meals I might go with three stars, but even then I would expect more for the popularity."}
{"text":"Stopped by with our children our waitress I believe her name was Jamie, regardless the blond short waitress. What a disaster had to continuously send our food back because of it being wrong, when we told JAMIE we got nothing but eye rolls,arguments, and attitude. Last I checked I am the customer and could care less about your petty excuses for my order being wrong. If JAMIE would ha e handled the situation better than maybe I would have considered giving you another shot. Not to mention everytime JAMIE walked away from our table she muttered bitch, cunt, asshole etc. To any waitress that would listen as they stared us down and she slammed plates around. The way JAMIE acted was horrendous not only in a business environment but in front of our children nonetheless. DISPICABLE"}
{"text":"Great breakfast food! Good coffee. Service is quick and the breakfast/lunch food is SO MUCH BETTER than Pamela's. 

The location is perfect so that you can go grocery shopping afterwards (in the Strip District)."}
{"text":"My family and I couldn't decide where to have breakfast while shopping in the strip. It was between here and Pamela's, and I'm glad we tried Deluca's.

There's almost always a line out the door. We did have to wait a while, but it didn't seem long at all. I ordered an ordinary breakfast with over medium eggs, bacon, and toast. It was good and satisfied my appetite. My mom ordered the mixed grill. It's not the most pretty thing, but it sure is yummy. My aunt, however, ordered their cinnamon French toast, and I had to try a few bites. It was delicious. That's for sure what I'm going to order the next time I'm there.

The only thing that sort of bothered me is how packed the restaurant gets, and I was feeling a bit claustrophobic. That's not such a big deal when their food is good though, and I forgot all about it when I was eating. I also hardly saw anyone on staff smile other than the cooks who seem to be the only people who were happy.

All in all, its a great breakfast and lunch spot. While the experience didn't wow me, there's plenty of items on the menu for everyone to find something they'll enjoy."}
{"text":"Great dinner and excellent food quality.  Went at 12 and had zero wait.  Staff was friendly and moved quickly.  Quick, delicious and large.  Value for the dollar was great. Remember to bring cash, no credit cards."}
{"text":"Great breakfast with the family. Busy but we got a seat for 8 in about 15 minutes. Wish they had some black t-shirts!"}
{"text":"Best diner I've ever been to. Visited with my aunt who moved away about from Pittsburgh about twenty years ago. She said it is still just as good as she remembers. Real, authentic experience with awesome food that doesn't cost an arm and a leg. One thing is it is CASH ONLY! Not a big problem, but can catch you off guard if you're not a regular. Great staff and great experience. Hopefully I can come back soon!"}
{"text":"Best Breakfast in the 'burgh! Quick service even with a wait."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try Deluca's for such a long time. The first time I wanted to go there there was quite a few people waiting in front of us, so we decided to try it another day. I went just this past Friday....and I absolutely love it there!! We didn't have to wait at all at the time we went around 11..I was so surprised it wasn't busier, but I think it just all depends on the times and day it is. First off, I do want to mention the staff is not very friendly at all there! They almost seemed bothered that there are people eating at this place. That's the only negative thing I have to say. The atmosphere is cute, typical diner, I love how it looks like an old fashioned diner. We sat at the booth where Tom Cruise sat at during a scene filmed at Deluca's for Jack Reacher. I think that adds a cool touch to the place! Their menu has to be the biggest menu I have ever seen! There are so many options, it's a little overwhelming to be honest. They don't just have breakfast items, they have lunch and dessert items. There food is absolutely delicious!! I can not wait to go back!"}
{"text":"After sitting at the table the hostess directed us to, we got up after 10 minutes of no menus or anyone acknowledging us. Oh, but the hostess did come over to see if there was money on the table after the last group left. She even had the gall to say \"Have a good day\" as we left. Won't be back to DeLucas. Luckily, Pamela's is around the corner."}
{"text":"I think I died and went to heaven here. I went for breakfast after a night of drinking (it was Friday, so the wait wasn't very long). And omg, the eggs benedict I got was some of the best I have ever had. I am getting hungry right now just thinking about it. They put it on some sort of French bread instead of a biscuit, and it didn't get soggy fast, which made all the difference. The avocado on it was fresh on the eggs - and the sauce on top was perfect. Our waitress was also super helpful and nice. She did a fantastic job. The only downside is that they are cash only. Oh well - small price to pay for being so delicious! I can't wait until I am in the city again to eat there."}
{"text":"This place is sort of a local legend, and rightly so, as any place that serves ice cream as a breakfast food (on waffles!) is a place you should go to at least once. Having said that--We just went again and the service was terrible. It was a slow day, and there were a ton of staff on, and we still waited 10-15 minutes to have our order taken. My food didn't come as described in the menu, and the mashed potatoes came in a gigantic flavorless mound. If you want a ton of mediocre food, in a fun, old-school diner atmosphere, this is your spot. If you want something truly delicious, look elsewhere."}
{"text":"I had no idea what to expect when I did a Yelp search, but I was pleasantly surprised by this local establishment.   The menu was huge and the prices were super reasonable.   I went on a saturday morning, so it was insane, but well worth the wait.   Just what I was looking for - except next time I'll come earlier so I don't have to wait in the freezing cold."}
{"text":"This place is one of the best whole in the wall breakfast spots i've been to, ever, I put down the chocolate chip ice cream pancakes and the vegetable egg chorizo scramble combo buisness (forget the exact name)...the waitress stopped me half way through ordering and disclaimered how much food that would be, I said i know, and yes i did finish it all :)"}
{"text":"I got the French toast and my brother got the Philly cheesesteak. With all due respect for the reputation and the long waiting line in front of this place (that made me curious to give this place a try), i must say the food was nothing impressive. They should find a way to deal with the smoke from the kitchen. My glasses got so foggy the moment i stepped inside this place. My coat smells like steak for hours afterward. The only good thing is the service. People are friendly there. Also, they only take cash."}
{"text":"Took a quick trip to Pittsburgh with the wife and kids, before we went to Pittsburgh we planned on stopping at a popular restaurant or diner. We went online to see if any food Network shows had been to the area. It just happens that Delucas had been featured on man VS food. We stopped in to check it out. It's a very family friendly place. The hostess and waitresses were older, which was very welcoming. The interior definitely has an older look to it which is refreshing. And the kitchen is open to watch.

But about the food, we ordered our sons cheeseburger sliders and their chicken fingers. Now these chicken fingers were HUGE. Full hand breaded cutlets and they were pretty tasty. My wife also ordered a chicken finger basket. But for me I still desired breakfast so I ordered the M.O.A.B. (Mother of all burritos) my goodness this thing was mammoth. Chorizo, eggs, potatoes, cheese and more cheese with banana peppers stuffed in a flour tortilla. I gotta say it was pretty good, I didn't finish it, and with good reason. This thing is huge. But the potatoes inside were amazing. The eggs were fluffy and my goodness the chorizo. If anyone is ever in the Pittsburgh area, please stop here. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"I had brunch there, I went for the ham steak! It was okay, nothing special.
I guess the characteristic of the place is huge plates, which is not really my type, but if some one wants to pay 13$ and eat like 3 people's breakfast, this place is a good one! 

One thing I don't like was I asked for substitute for my home fries to fruit cup, but they brought me both and charge me for both! The lady was so nice, so I did not say anything! We were +5 so we were able to reserve the place, otherwise there is a long long long line for it!"}
{"text":"Great space with fun decor friendly staff and  interesting menu.  Will return next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Nothing fancy here. Looks like a tiny, run-down kitchen, but the long line of people waiting outside in the cold weather sort of makes you curious.

This breakfast joint serves delicious pancakes & the incredibly attentive waitstaff (despite the chaotic morning hours) kept re-filling my coffee mug without even having to be asked. They serve big portions and it is definitely not the place to go if you are diet-conscious. Otherwise, go here if you want a hearty yet inexpensive breakfast. This is not your regular IHOP."}
{"text":"Great customer service! I got the Hotcake Special with hot sausage and bacon on the side. I always order my eggs runny soft and usually they come out scrambled to hard, but here the cool made them perfectly which is rare! 
This place really has that homey small town diner look that makes you feel at home. Whenever I come back to Pittsburgh, I plan on indulging in a good breakfast around the lovely people of Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"This is the best greasy spoon you can find and it is awesome.  I had the veggie mix grill.  The prices are perfect the atmosphere is classic dinner / hole in the wall / grandmas kitchen and it is packed every inch full of hungry customers.  One of the best breakfast places in town.  Get there early and I mean early the line may be down the street but the wait is worth it."}
{"text":"This place is crazy good. We had to wait around 20 minutes to get in (the line goes out the door and down the street when it's busy), but the move people through pretty quickly. Their pancakes are so good. I had the Apple Pie pancakes that came with whip cream and ice cream. Oh my gosh sooooooo amazing! Really rich and super filling, but somehow I managed. I loved that place!"}
{"text":"Man versus food. Food won on my visit!

Had the Breakfast of Champions. My eyes nearly popped out of my head when it came out on Not 1 or 2, but 3 PLATES!

Food: Lot of carbs that fill you up quickly - toast, pancake, hash, eggs. Bacon was crispy but flavorful and definitely enjoyed that. Love the chocolate chip pancake where they add them into the pancake instead of just pouring some chips on top after the pancake is done. Toast was bland - if deciding what to skip in carbs, this would be it. Hash and eggs were basic cooked items without much flavor so add your own condiments to make it work.

Service: Ok, don't come here for service cuz you'll hate yourself. Similar to other popular breakfast places I've visited, you only see servers for beverage order, food order, food delivery, check.

FYI: Cash Only! Get here before 10am on weekends to limit wait times cuz there will definitely be a line. I got here at 9am and there was about 5 min wait."}
{"text":"Food, and lots of it. The best breakfast in Pittsburgh ! Great service and very busy. If you want to lose weight and you like to eat, don't go here. The platter of food I ordered arrived quickly and hot. The corned beef hash is crispy on the outside and warm and tender on the inside. The meat and eggs were cooked to perfection and the cost is reasonable for the amount of great food you get. Other family members ordered pancakes that covered the platters, not plates. The toppings looked great, but they would not share. If you are in the City of Champions, this IS the place for breakfast !"}
{"text":"Had breakfast here during a weekend trip for a game.
Finally got to try the Strawberry Fields heavenly hotcakes! ( I had vanilla ice cream instead of strawberry)
Ok, perfect name! Because i was definitely in breakfast Heaven!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is one I always make a point to visit when in the area. Coming in on the redeye from the west coast we weren't served food so the hunger level was high. I have visited on weekdays and weekends. The former is always better. Lines are short to non-existent on those day's. Weekends always has lines out the door that provides wait times of up to 30 minutes. On this Tuesday morning I walked right in and was seated straight away. Drinks were quickly served; no coffee for me but some of the orange juice. It was good but I prefer fresh squeezed. So I decided on a short stack of buttermilk pancakes, 2 eggs and some bacon. Everything was tasty, as always and served quickly. The service was great and everyone was super friendly. I have visited a handful of times in each of my prior visits and will make it a point to continue that tradition as long as they are around when I am in the 'burgh. Prices are always fair and comparable to fast-food and chain style restaurants. Parking is on the street and can be limited, especially on the weekends."}
{"text":"Although not from the Burgh, my cousins brought me to my inaugural visit at DeLuca's  years  ago  (before Man vs Food showed up).  Sleezy diners with delicious breakfast & lunch have a special place in my heart.  DeLucas nailed it for me.  From omelettes to sandwiches & salads, the food was always consistently good.  

After a 7 year hiatus, I visited P'burgh last weekend and had to hit up DeLuca's.  Seemed like something had slipped during that time period.  It took 15 minutes for the servers to decide which one of them was going to be assigned to us.  Not a good beginning.  No one even  offered coffee or a beverage to start.  

My omelette was dry and overcooked.  Veggie and meat filling wasn't warm, cheese not melted.  Soggy hash browns and barely toasted bread only added insult to injury.  Bear in mind, I'm not expecting an uber-brunch here.....its a diner, OK?   Maybe an off day, maybe not. I were  Adam Richman, Anthony Bourdain or Guy Fieri , my sorry excuse for an omelette with cold filling would have never hit the table!   (Just sayin')  Next time I'm in town, I might brave the lines at  P&G's Pamela's Diner."}
{"text":"A Strip institution!  Try the specialty pancakes and you won't be sorry.  If you go on a weekend, be prepared to stand in line (even in the winter) for a while.  The best times to visit DeLuca's is during the week to avoid the tourists."}
{"text":"If this is the best breakfast Pittsburgh has to offer, y'all need to get some better breakfast joints. I've been here twice and it was fine both times but nothing special. Coffee is average. Really don't understand what the fuss is about."}
{"text":"Contrary to Kenneth h.'s review, I would say there is great coffee. There is no expresso machine but its a cheaper dive place. I will say I've had cheaper breakfast in Bloomfield. But this place is worth the wait in line."}
{"text":"Descriptive phrase: Greasy-spoon Diner.

DeLuca's wins the breakfast battle between here and Pamela's in my opinion.

It's located directly on the main drag of the Strip, which earns it a nod. It actually looks and feels like an old-school diner, and you can tell not much has changed inside since it opened decades ago.

We were seated promptly around brunchtime but almost as soon we we sat there was a line behind us 30 people deep. On a Monday, mind you. Our waiter was rushed the whole time but the bus-boys walking around were helpful as well. It's loud, but in a neighborhood-feel kind of way. There are a bunch of people manning the long grill behind the counter, and they seem like they're enjoying themselves more than you'd think.

The menu is absolutely ginormous. I start with a chocolate milk ($1.79) and order the Califronia Benedict ($7.99) to follow. What a delicious mess of avocado, tomatoes, spinach, cheddar, all on top of poached eggs with hollandaise sauce. Absolutely fantastic. There was just much of the dense food that it was hard to get it all down in one sitting. It came with potatoes as well.

It's cash only, which seems to be a theme in Pittsburgh. Maybe I was just feeling nostalgic and DeLuca's reminds me a lot of Mickey's in Madison, WI, but I really enjoyed this place. I think you will too."}
{"text":"Try the Turkey sandwich. It is so good. The gravy is the best in town. 
You don't open this sandwich with your hands. It's a fork sandwich. 
Excellent service. 

Bring back the Italian Sandwich!!!!"}
{"text":"If you are a fan of breakfast food, you will be a fan of Deluca's Restaurant. That is really all that needs to be said about this iconic Pittsburgh breakfast spot. If you are reading this however, I am sure you would probably like a little bit more information on what is actually happening here.

Located in the Strip District, and featured on Man v. Food, Deluca's Restaurant is the top choice for those looking for some grub to start their day off. During our visit, we arrived later in the morning and were greeted with a line that went out of the building and extended onto the cold sidewalk outside. However, the line moved very fast, and the employees did everything they could to get people in and out in the most productive way possible.

After being seated, and looking over the menu, I decided to get the Steel City breakfast, which is basically a little bit of everything on the menu. In fact, I felt a little glutenous when they brought out my three plates of food, but hey, I needed to get my foodie on. From the eggs, to the french toast, everything I ate was absolutely delicious. Greasy, and delicious. It was one of those meals that is just so delicious, that you don't even take the time to make conversation with your fellow diners because you are too busy stuffing your face.

I wish that Deluca's was here in Cincinnati. I would go to this wonderful restaurant every morning if I could. If you live in Pittsburgh, don't take this gift for granted. To do so, would be a great dishonor."}
{"text":"My last meal in Pittsburgh was at this place. It had a lot of reviews and some locals had told me just how great it was. I had actually gone on Sunday but saw the line was out the door so ended up going somewhere else. On a Monday at 11 am I didn't think it be so bad. My friends and I were seated quickly. There was a lot of options, I couldn't decide between the pancakes or the breakfast of champions. Went with the breakfast of champions and couldn't believe how much food it was. I imagined a short stack of pancakes would be small. It was two huge pancakes that I barely finished it. As I write this it is still my only meal of the day, still full haha. My friends loved the place and I'm so glad I saved the best for last. Please come to this place if you visit Pittsburgh or if you live in Pitt and have never visited. Oh and I think its cash only but not too sure. If you are a fan of pancakes as much as I am then this won't matter at all :)"}
{"text":"They only take cash :( We saw the reviews and the hype and decided to come. I'm glad we went but I wouldn't be dying to come back. I got the MOAB and it was one of the less enjoyable breakfast burritos I've had with a really sweet salsa on it We also got a nutella pancake which was delicious but just about anything with nutella is delicious. If you're looking for OK food and ok service  with something for everyone for a reasonable price this is your place. Bring cash."}
{"text":"De Luca's is The Strip District breakfast place. I refuse to go anywhere else. Half the time, you'll be lined up outside the door, but it's heavenly."}
{"text":"My experience eating at this place resembles Manny T's. I only give it a 2nd star because it was open on a day when everything else was closed. The fact that some Yelpers give this restaurant 5 stars, and it has an overall rating of 4 stars, really diminishes Yelp's credibility in my mind. 'Disgusting' is a big word, but this place comes close."}
{"text":"Having grown up in a typical Philly neighborhood I felt right at home at Deluca's. The street and the restaurant transported me back to my childhood. The food line, the counter stools, the friendly wait staff all made the experience special. My wife and I stuck with the usual breakfast fare.  French toast, eggs and bacon, hash browns, toast and coffee. Everything fresh and familiar. Living close to Baltimore it is a pity they could not save some of the old close-in shopping areas to create a draw such as the Strip."}
{"text":"A must stop when shopping in the Strip District. This looks like a traditional Pittsburgh diner but once you enter you will see how amazing the menu is and will get a diner experience unlike no other.  They have dessert pancakes which are awesome but only for those with a big sweet tooth. In the fall I ordered the pumpkin pancakes which were tasty. This past visit my date ordered the apple cinnamon pancakes complete with whipped cream with caramel drizzle, ice cream and hot baked applies. It was to die for!!  I ordered the bacon, egg and cheese sandwich.  For a true breakfast sandwich I had them hold the tomatoes, lettuce and mayo.  It was on fresh baked bread from the local bread company, Manconi, with cheddar cheese, scrambled egg and tasty bacon delicious!  The service is quick and they only take cash (PNC mac machine right outside).  There is always a line around the block on weekends so expect to wait although the line does usually move quickly."}
{"text":"Amazing place for breakfast.  We came here on the last morning when visiting Pittsburgh.  So good!!! Everything on the menu is solid.  You really can't go wrong.  We kept hearing about this place and we even walked by it one of the days while exploring.  I'm so glad we got a chance to eat here before leaving.  If you are visiting Pittsburgh this is a must.  Check it out!"}
{"text":"I was strolling through the Strip District and really had no intention on eating here. It had a huge line outside. Unfortunately my girlfriend was quite hungry and the line cleared out shortly there after so we decided to stop in.

If you love a greasy breakfast, this might just be the place to go. The portion sizes are pretty decent, I had a 6 egg omelet with a lot of meat in it. It tasted good enough, and filled me up. Like most diner food, I felt pretty queasy later on in the day from all of the grease. 

There were 2 huge negatives to this place. First was the price. It wasn't out of this world expensive, but just not worth what they charge. It came to about 25 dollars for 2 people. We only drank water and there were no add on sides. 

The second was, some nasty waiter walking around putting his fingers on everything. I saw this guy working at some desk, rummaging through drawers then back to serving the food. He was touching a lot of peoples foods with his bare hands, not washing or sanitizing. It seemed very needless to touch them the way he was.

They do not have the best breakfast in Pittsburgh, nor would I go here again."}
{"text":"I recommend the pancake here! It's very good! For omelets, they are pretty delicious, but too greasy for me. The home fries (potato) are must-try food. Also the size is so large, so it's suitable for hungry people! Really awesome!

If you can come here on weekdays, the restaurant is very good for you to have breakfast or brunch. If you are only available on weekend, come here as early as possible (maybe before 7:00am), because I don't think it's worth to wait for more than 30 mins even though I give it 4 stars."}
{"text":"This place is always busy! But that shows that it is soooo good! The last time I went there, I had the fish sandwich and it was so yummy! They bread the fish there and you can definitely tell. It tasted very fresh. It also came with coleslaw and fries. The fries were, ehhhhh ok. Nothing really special about them. The coleslaw was pretty good though! Next time I go, I definitely think I will try something from their breakfast menu. The other people I was with got breakfast items and really enjoyed them!"}
{"text":"A Must-Visit restaurant if you ever visit the Pitt. This place gets super crowded, but it is well worth the wait. I had the pancake breakfast. Pancakes 1-5=4. Bacon 1-5=5. Eggs 1-5=3. Toast 1-5=3. Syrup 1-5=4."}
{"text":"When I think of Big Manly Breakfasts ... the kind that John Wayne, Jimmy Hoffa, and Batman would all eat I think of the King of all Pittsburgh Greasy Spoons, Deluca's.

Don't trick yourself into thinking you are getting anything beyond the best greasy spoon breakfast you've ever had.  Your waitress may be rude and there may be odd sticky substances on your table.  Don't like it?  Fuck you, that is ambiance here!

The place is, almost always, packed to the rafters (especially at breakfast time).  You will wait for a table.  The wait staff is typically old and cantankerous.  You will hear the query \"whatta ya want, honey\".  But the food is plentiful and out of this world.  Where else can you score a pepperoni omelette at any time of the day?  Pour some ketchup on that bad boy, order up a coke and I'm in heaven!"}
{"text":"Probably my favorite diner. I will admit that I have never been to the original location in The Strip District, but I imagine the menus are pretty much the same.

Huge Omelettes! Great Lobster Bisque and sandwiches. This place is good for Breakfast or Lunch.  Be prepared to wait, as this is a popular place on the weekends for Breakfast.

There are too many things that I have had and liked here to list them all, but you can't go wrong with an Omelette or Pancakes for Breakfast. They have some Pancake and Waffle dishes that are covered in Whipped Cream and Syrup, they might as well be deserts. Good lunch options are the Burgers or various sandwiches. I enjoy the Club myself with a bowl of the Bisque and a side of Onion Rings.

Something for everyone, you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"If your turned off by shabby furnishings and the whole dive vibe this place is not for you. If you could care less about your surroundings as long as the food is fantastic and plentiful the come to Delucas. My wife and 3 boys (11, 13 and 15) are breakfast junkies, seriously, we could ready breakfast 3 times a day 7 days a week. So we had to try Delucas while in Pittsburgh for a holiday. We saw it on Man Vs Food and DDD. It is a dive no doubt about it. But the food is awesome. We ate breakfast at around 930a and didn't eat again until 10p.....the portions are huge. Staff was friendly and prices where reasonable. What else could you ask for."}
{"text":"Despite all the hoopla, I can't say I was thrilled. Pros: they had a very friendly staff, the healthier option of buckwheat pancakes/waffles, and the French toast was on point. Cons: frozen strawberries, fake whipped cream, sub-par hash, and the absolute worst was the sausage. I'm 99% sure it was ground beef mixed with sausage at a respective 90:10 ratio. My friends and I will be sticking to Pamela's."}
{"text":"We were in the area and found this quaint diner. It's not that far from the airport and the menu offers breakfast food and lunches. Our party ordered a hot turkey sandwich, eggs Benedict with ham, and MOAB which is a breakfast burrito. Being from Texas we thought things were big but the servings here were BIG!!!  Our food was delicious and our server,Barry, was friendly and helpful. Our coffee cups were kept full and food was fresh and hot!  If you're in town we suggest you have at least one meal here!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast in town. If you're not there at the crack of dawn, expect to wait in line. Worth it."}
{"text":"Went here based on recommendations from coworkers.  This area was pretty cool (strip district).  Alot of tourists though I have to say, granted we were there on a weekend.  The line was out the door for this place and smelled so good!  We decided to wait, and glad we did.  I ordered the mixed grill with sausage and my husband ordered some omelette (the one with chicken and spinach and some kind of cheese).  Both dishes were great!  I wish I had tried a pancake but I was trying to be healthy.  Oh well.  For healthy food, our dishes sure were satisfying and didn't taste all that healthy :)"}
{"text":"The food was definitely not as GOOD AS USUAL... 

I was better off staying at home making my own breakfast .... french toast was hard and not hot..! 

The potatoes  had no flavor none WHATSOEVER...+ the potatoes  were hard. 

Overall I was not please with my meal. 

Trump is in the White House  now, so maybe the cooks are having a hard time readjusting from yesterday inauguration... 

Rating Deluca's 3 on pass experience....?"}
{"text":"Okay, who needs a 100 year old grill to make awesome food and tasty memories?! Not me! Don't bite me! I get it. The one in downtown was the first and blah, blah. Listen, that's all fine and dandy but new is sometimes better. As soon as you walk in, the smell of non 100 year old establishment is refreshing and the place has a cozy friendly feel to it with very eye catching decor. You won't feel crowded. There's still wide open spaces. They have the BEST WAITRESS IN THE WORLD! Her name is Jamie and she's an absolute doll! All of our breakfast items were delicious! I ordered the pumpkin pancakes with a side of home fries and my hubby ordered the fried chicken and biscuits. EVERYTHING was yummy! The home fries were crispy. The chicken was juicy on the inside and crispy on the outside. The pumpkin pancakes were so fluffy and moist and perfect texture. The bathrooms are in the same level. You don't have to walk down a flight of slimy old stairs to get to them. Alright, enough said. Just stop by and experience it for yourself."}
{"text":"First time here entire family's meals were outstanding.  I had gourmet bacon club and it was unbelievable.  My daughter ordered a cheeseburger and it was the size of a football.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"There is a always a long line out the door (literally) for a reason. That reason is amazing diner food. The fact that it's cash only doesn't deter anyone from coming here. I've only been here once but I'm already sold. 

My husband and I ordered a few random things on the rather large menu and everything was pretty darn good. He tried the Reuben Melt with Lobster Bisque soup and I got the Country Fried Chicken, Eggs and Biscuits. The Lobster Bisque was surprisingly creamy and full of flavor for a diner soup. I'll admit, the Country Fried Chicken was a bit heavy for brunch but it was so amazing; every bite was worth the gazillion calories that I consumed. The chicken was well seasoned and moist, the batter was crispy and the creamy gravy made it all the more comforting. I could tell the biscuits were homemade or made very well bc they were so moist and great alongside everything else. 

If I could, I would come here every weekend but the line and wait can be discouraging (and I would gain so much weight). Awesome location, delicious diner food, but always crowded. Come prepared to wait."}
{"text":"Not feeling like contending with all the dahn-tahn Burgh traffic that inexplicably seems terrified of the tunnel monster, we decided to go to the Robinson location. What a brilliant choice that turned out to be. Breakfast was AMAZING! It was literally a ton of food and I ate all of it. Ok, almost all of it. I had the Steel City Breakfast of Champs with a waffle instead of pancakes. I just wanted to taste everything. As always though, my eyes were bigger than my stomach. I mean this thing had eggs, bacon, a giant, tender piece of ham steak, home fries, toast and a humungous waffle with strawberries and whipped cream. Everything was delicious, cooked to order, and the service was fantastic. Our server was awesome. My boyfriend had a 4 egg meat-o-rama omelette with home fries and toast. The huge smile on his face said it all. The place was super busy, and this was on a Friday afternoon. I can only imagine how busy it is on the weekend. So keep that in mind. However, it's well worth the wait. If you haven't been there yet, definitely check it aht!!!"}
{"text":"People love this place, and for good reason. The food is good and there is a lot of it. My boyfriend thought everything was really good (he got the Steel City Breakfast of champs, which is a little bit of everything, and I got the MOAB burrrito). I thought that the burrito was perfectly \"ok\" and I would not order it again. All I could taste was tomato paste and a hint of taco seasoning. But it's just a matter of preference, I suppose. I will definitely be back and trying something different. I'll follow up on this review then."}
{"text":"Terrible service, food not worth the price. 

We waited for 20 minutes before the server took our order, and then another half hour for a salad. The whole place is filthy, but the service is absolutely abhorrent."}
{"text":"As with any place in the Strip there is a wait on the weekends. However, whether coming here for breakfast or lunch it is worth the wait. Delicious Diner food and fast service."}
{"text":"Trip to Pittsburgh....

Wasn't very welcoming.... no hi, hello or how are you? when entering. Dirty tables, empty jelly containers under the table and staff checked on at the end of the meal. ooooohhh and the flies.... 

As for the food.....
I ordered pancakes,  philly cheesesteak omelette and home fries.

Pancakes-Nothing special 
Omelette- Pretty good no complaints 
Home fries- Bland and mushy"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch, had a steak and cheese sub, it was unqiue because they used thick slices of steak in the sub. But the experience was kinda so so. I'll have to try the breakfest, since I love breakfest and their supposed to be good at that. We'll see !"}
{"text":"What a great place to go for the best pancakes ever ....... There was a line outside of the restaurant, don't be intimidated it moves fast , the restaurant is a lot bigger then it looks !   Bring CASH , no credit cards taken !  Ice cream on pancakes is a huge hit at least with my kids !!!!"}
{"text":"Oh my Lord, y'all. This place is all around fantastic. There's a reason famous people come here to eat. AMAZING food, INCREDIBLE service, and that small time diner feel with food that surpassed expectations. Before I talk about food, I have to mention the management. My dad grew up here, and when we came to eat here in November (we were visiting from Texas) they were already closed. Well the owner was outside and she heard we had friends that liked this place, she let us in and fed us a HUGE meal for a perfect price. We were the only ones in the diner but she made us feel so welcome. She was so nice and easy to talk to. It was really cool. The portions here are huge so come in hungry! Their French Toast and I believe other bread items on the menu are from Mancini's bread shop next door, which is the best Italian bread ever, so the French Toast was literally THE BEST French Toast I've ever had. That's saying a lot because I love french toast and try it at every breakfast place I go to. I still have dreams about it.  I can't wait to visit The Strip again and come to Deluca's for a huge meal at a great price surrounded by friendly, caring people. Great experience all around."}
{"text":"I was very excited when I saw Delucas was opening in Robinson as I am always anxious for a delicious non-chain venue.  Two weeks ago my family went to DeLucas for breakfast.  We arrived at 830 am and beat the crowd.  Service was awful!  We waited 15 minutes before we asked what we wanted to drink.  We finally order and the food comes out staggered.  My two sons get their meals (pancakes) and my wife and I wait a few more minutes for ours.  Most of her meal comes (no bread which was needed for the eggs), and my pancakes were no where to be found.  The remainder of our food finally comes to our table.

Bottom line service was awful.  Food was ok.  I will not rush back and will go out of my way to get to Pamela's for breakfast!"}
{"text":"Crowded...old school vibe...good food and value"}
{"text":"I think this place is just hyped up way too much. The food was average, or even below average greasy diner food. We were seated under the air conditioner so were freezing the entire time we were there. I don't mind a kind of grungy diner, but this place seems sticky and gross.

Our server was very pleasant, and the woman she was training was helpful and kept up with coffee re-fills.

In all honesty, I don't know why people line-up to get breakfast from this joint. Nothing spectacular on the menu in m y opinion.... 

Second story (from my husband so I know its true).... he went there door-busting Sunday morning, after a long night out. Although they were the first people waiting at the door, and were there about 20 minutes before they opened, another group of people strolled up in front of them right at opening and were seated first. These people were then served first, and it took almost 45 minutes for my husband and his group of friends to get their food. They are guessing the group that cavalierly cut in front of them was a group of regulars. One of the people in my husbands group complained to management and they were given a gift certificate, but it almost made one of the group members late miss their flight out of town.... 

So glad we went during the week when it wasn't that crowded."}
{"text":"This place is amazing for breakfast! I came here with a party of five, there's a line out the door but it is well worth the wait! We were greeted and seated by a waitress who could not have been friendlier! She was sassy, energetic and fun to engage with. 

We ordered an assortment of pancakes, waffles, eggs, and more by let me leave you the highlights; Italian toast, waffle sundae, hash browns, and chocolate milkshake. These items were all to die for. 

It's a bit crowded inside, and fairly loud, but you will not regret making his your breakfast destination."}
{"text":"I know everyone loves DeLuca's, but the food isn't super great, and the wait is always too long. Also, the  time I have been there bathrooms almost never have soap, and if the bathrooms don't have soap, the servers and cooks aren't washing their hands. Just consider that."}
{"text":"Omg!! Adam Richman was right!! This place is delicious!!
Bring cash (they don't take check or card) and prepare to wait.  But the wait is sooooooo worth it!!

Since I was on a diet, I got the Bodybuilders breakfast--oatmeal(creamiest, tastiest oats I have ever eaten), fruit cup, turkey sausages (6 links), 6 scrambled egg whites, and tomato slices.  

My hubby got the New Yorker omelet which had cheese, salami, capicola (deliciously spicy) and ham.

Father in law got the Seafood omelet (lobster, crab, and shrimp topped with a savory sauce and avocado) His breakfast was the best at the table!!  Hands Down!! We were all jealous.  

To round out the meal, we absolutely had to get a pancake sundae!  We opted for the Reece.  It had chocolate chip pancakes, chocolate peanut butter ice cream, chocolate sauce, caramel sauce , whipped cream and a cherry.  Heavenly!!

I will need to return soon!"}
{"text":"Heard about it as a staple of Pittsburgh

Got the South of the border omelette, wasn't bad, decent flavor but nothing amazing, chorizo was nice and large potions, home fries were weak, not much seasoning

We also got the seafood Benedict, not bad, good hollandaise but again nothing amazing

Overall, good service, good portions, good price, worth exploring and it was on man vs food haha, but basically your solid diner situation"}
{"text":"Just, yum.  I pride myself on having eaten breakfast at most hole-in-the-wall spots in Pittsburgh (Pamela's, Square cafe, Coca cafe, Randall's, and quite a few places that I can't even remember the names of), but this place is my favorite.  I got the eggs bene, which was bomb, and the service was fast and it was all really cheap.  Good coffee, too.  

It's definitely divey, and if you're the type of person who typically brunches in Shadyside, it's probably not for you."}
{"text":"Awesome food. Awesome service. 
Just had the Country Fried Chicken & Eggs. Very good!"}
{"text":"My friend and decided to eat at Roland's in the Strip District and thought why not go for their \"famous lobster rolls\" I was surprised how much YUMMY lobster was in the sandwich!   it's a definite must stop!"}
{"text":"Went here because a friend who lives in Pittsburg said that this is a very popular place for breakfast. 

Had the pierogi breakfast with eggs--very ordinary. I wouldn't order this again. Can't understand why people would line up to dine here. 

After we left the restaurant, my friend and I smelled like a kitchen. Definitely I would not return. The smell was really strong. Had to change my clothes before continuing my day."}
{"text":"We are here on Sunday of Memorial Day weekend after reading positive reviews. There was a 20 minute wait, but it was certainly well worth it. I got the ham steak, eggs and potatoes. The ham steak was huge with a wonderful flavor and the potatoes were outstanding. It was one of the best breakfasts I've had in a long time. The others in my party were equally happy with their choices. Due to the large serving sizes, I'm sure we'll be good until supper time. Highly, highly recommend this Pittsburgh jewel."}
{"text":"Worst breakfast experience of my life.  we waited 30 minutes for a table while other tables and seats at the bar were empty.  upon asking about the empty tables the hostess gave us attitude and said they aren't ready.  when we finally sat down and ordered it took 30 more minutes to get our food.  halfway through my typical greasy diner omelet i realized our orders had been mixed up and i had been given my friends chorizo omelet in lieu of my veggie fritatta (which was really a veggie omelet).  when informing our server she told us it was our fault that we couldn't tell and its not her job to know which food goes where.  then proceeded to tell us not to come back.  when we asked for the manager we were given more attitude and eventually resulting in a yelling match with the server and manager.

worst customer service i have EVER EVER experienced.  and really the food isn't special at all."}
{"text":"Huge portions. That's the first thing that comes to my mind. They have a huge variety of food as well which is great for someone who's not that big into standard breakfast fare. The quality and taste of the food is not as good as it should be for the amount of time you will spend standing in line waiting for a table on a Saturday or Sunday at breakfast/brunch time. It's cool to watch the line cooks make your food, but it's almost stressful to watch the servers and cooks running around, yelling orders, and wiping sweat off their brows. Don't sit at the bar during a breakfast rush if you expect to have a relaxing meal."}
{"text":"There's always a line for this place, no matter what day of the week. I came here on a Friday morning for brunch, and there was a good 15-minute wait before we were seated. I must say they did a great job with getting people in and out pretty quickly. The menu was a bit messy though. They tried to make it look more fun, but I thought it was just confusing. 

After orienting myself to the menu, I decided to settle for the Californian omelet with chipotle pesto chicken, asiago cheese, spinach and avocado. The omelet came with two slices of toast. The omelet was just ok. I didn't think it was anything special. They were pretty stingy on the avocado. There wasn't enough sauce and the chicken was dried. Honestly, I didn't think the omelet was worth $12. The side of homemade fries was super plain. The Lyonnais potato at Pamela's is so much more flavorful. My dinning companion ordered the apple cinnamon bun pancake sundae. It looked delicious when it came out with a huge scoop of ice cream on top. The ice cream melted fast and left a giant puddle on the pancakes. The pancakes were delicious, but the sogginess from the melted ice cream really ruined it. It was good the first few bites, but not something I can finish. 

Overall, I had a good dinning experience at Deluca's, but I did not think this place is worth all the hype. Though, I'm willing to come back and try something else on the menu, hoping maybe I ordered all the wrong stuff the first time."}
{"text":"I had a mixed grill (was feeling particularly carnivorous that day) and it was good.  Loads of meat, served with grilled veggies and potatoes.  I couldn't finish it, and ended up taking some home, and it proceeded to be my breakfast for two days after that.  

The breakfast meats are pretty good, and the prices are good too.  Standard diner fare, with a little more of a busy atmosphere."}
{"text":"I personally think that this place is pretty overrated.  I've gone a several times, and I'm never satisfied.  Maybe I'm just not a fan of super greasy and unoriginal breakfasts?  Not my top pick in the city by any means.  Also, it's ridiculous how busy this place gets for what they offer.  And it feels dirty.  So I'll go elsewhere."}
{"text":"I went there last weekend with one of my Bestfriends and it was truly amazing!!! I have been craving it all week.. Everything from the delicious chocolate chip pancakes to the coffee!! My biggest pet peeves is having terrible \"fake\" breakfast food but this did not dissapoint. The eggs were real, not the mediocre egg beaters and the crispy bacon wasn't too greasy or fatty. I cannot wait to go back! Truly great food and great service"}
{"text":"Our server Norma was excellent. They also have an extensive menu which can be good if you have perfected it all. We ordered the chicken and waffles had a side of bacon and a side of avocado. The coffee and orange juice were delicious and we enjoyed the free coffee refills. The food was expected of diner food but not of one that is a famous location. The chicken and waffles were too pricey for the taste and size. We are glad we can say we went there but will not go back again."}
{"text":"Deluca's just gets me. I am not fancy and always hungry. Deluca's is not fancy and always gives me enough food for the next 3 days.

Deluca's is located right in the middle of the strip district in Pittsburgh. They perfectly embody the Steel City with the older and interior and hearty offerings. I've never had a bad meal here. I'm not a big sweets person, but I have taken large bites of my sister's chocolate chip pancakes. They're absolutely delicious, and enough to feed the whole family. However, I am a savory omelette type of morning gal. I've had both the Super Bowl and the Seafood omelettes, and they're amazing. I especially love the seafood omelette because for $13.99, you receive an omelette the size of a newborn child and it is STUFFED with seafood. It is such a good deal! Besides the omelettes, my favorite item is the seafood Benedict. Their hollandaise sauce is incredible and of course, you have a solid 3-4 meals out of it.

Ugh, I'm sad I won't get my Deluca's fix until next month. If you're in Pittsburgh and have some cash (no cards!), definitely stop by. It's worth the hype."}
{"text":"We were walking to another restaurant for breakfast on Saturday morning when we happened upon this place and the large line out front.  It's located in the heart of the Strip District, so there was a ton going on the day we ate here. The food is very good and the portions are huge. I'd recommend going early to avoid the long waits. And note that they only accept cash, no credit cards."}
{"text":"Loved Deluca's!  We came here for breakfast after spending the night in PGH for a Pirates game.  I've given up on finding a diner in Youngstown so it was nice to visit one here!  Our waitress greeted us as we came in the door and we had coffee in front of us within second of our butts hitting our seats!  Omelettes were made with freshly cracked eggs and were huge!  I had the Western and the hubby had a Greek with chicken.  Both were very good as were the home fries.  They have several different egg benedict choices that all looked great as did a huge pancake special that the person sitting next to us had.

Makes me want to drive down from Youngstown on Saturday for breakfast!  The hour drive each way would be well worth it!"}
{"text":"The chicken and waffle is awesome ! Delicious breaded fried chicken breast on top of a fluffy waffle.  The fried chicken is salty and savory along with the sweet waffle powdered sugar sprinkled on top.  Pour on some sweet syrup and a little hot sauce supplied on the table already.  It was great really hit the spot.  It also came with 2 eggs whatever style you want - I got sunny side up and dipped my chicken and waffle in the egg yolk :-) FYI the place is cash only"}
{"text":"Great place great food if you don't mind waiting a little bit outside until some room clears out to be a seated its a small place but some of the greatest breakfast food in town the service is very very quick. We went on NYE and it was 10 degrees but it was worth the wait for cheap great food! The breakfast is the best I highly recommend The chicken and biscuits! Big portions of food The staff is very nice felt very welcomed! So if you're in the strip district I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Wow... wow... one of the best breakfasts I've had in a while. There's a good amount of parking around, especially if you get there early.... and you'll want to get there early, because there's a FREAKING LINE OUT THE DOOR TO GET SEATED!! So worth it, though. Everything is yummy."}
{"text":"Love Delucas! I got the Nutella french toast, which was basically just slabs of Nutella spread on regular french toast....meets the requirements but for all the hype surrounding Delucas I was expecting a bit more on that end. It was pretty tasty, though I prefer the french toast at Micro Diner in Mt Washington. The waiter was very friendly, and the place is adorable. I'll definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"I wanted to come here since I had good experiences at the one in the strip but omg. Not the same. It was packed so my mom and I sat at the bar. I ordered the chicken finger basket. When I got my food, the chicken fingers were burnt and the fries were undercooked. They forgot to put my moms order in so she had to watch me eat until she finally got hers. Our waitress was MIA so someone else had to cash us out. Other waitresses were overheard loudly complaining and cussing. Horrible dining experience."}
{"text":"Everything was delicious! Had the breakfast burrito and the wife had the hot roast beef sandwich with mounds of mashed potatoes.  Soo much food!"}
{"text":"Went this morning with my girlfriend and we got almost the same thing. The home fries where just a little under cooked but everything else we had was great. The pancakes where amazing and the food came out lightning fast."}
{"text":"I thought it was good food for sure but it was slightly over priced. I think you can get the same quality food for a cheaper price and half the wait time. I think its over hyped but still worth a visit once in your life."}
{"text":"Quick, rough, greasy, cash only and not bad. An old school greasy diner with a truck stop mentality. Whatever image that conjures in your mind is probably what you can expect.

Food's alright. I liked it and I'd eat here again. It does get crowded, but I wouldn't wait outside for a seat to eat here."}
{"text":"Found this on yelp and it was worth the visit.  Super fast friendly service.  The food is fantastic!   I had the eggs Benedict and the hollandaise was perfect .  Hubby had the corned beef hash and was equally happy with his meal. Highly recommend for breakfast!"}
{"text":"Awful service... food is just ok.
Not worth standing in line... Plus they only take cash..."}
{"text":"Both times I've eaten breakfast here, I was extremely, extremely pleased. However, I think the food was better my first visit compared to the second, and I'm not one to branch out at breakfast places, so this is a fair comparison of the exact same sandwich, service, and company. 

Each visit we waited in line outside of Deluca's for a table. It was raining, but the line moved quickly and we were under cover anyways. The service is prompt and friendly. 

It's definitely a great place to recommend to out of towners for a good local breakfast stop. The bread is all Mancini's...delicious. Local flavor, great location. Will return."}
{"text":"Whoa! This place takes breakfast and goes to town with it. Awesome old school diner in Pittsburgh's Strip District. You walk inside and its like stepping back into the 1950s. Personable waitresses abound there to greet you. You can sit at the old fashioned counter or grab a booth. They have a pretty elaborate menu that offers breakfast and lunch but the breakfast is what you're here for. I ordered the Bionic Omelette not really realizing what I was getting myself into. This thing was mammoth and has practically everything in it you would eat for breakfast. Bacon, fresh sausage, onions, hash browns and more! After this meal I ate nothing else for the whole day. I was eating off of this thing for three days and believe me when I say I have a big appetite so that tells you how big it is. The coolest thing about eating here was watching the guy behind the counter cook the meal on the big fryer like someone cooking a homemade breakfast at home in their kitchen. Food comes out pretty fast and prices are okay. The bionic omelette was $13 and like I said it fed me for a few days. You can't miss this place if you're looking for it because its the place with the giant rooster on the roof. Also, theres a booth here marked where Tom Cruise sat during filming the movie Jack Reacher."}
{"text":"Came here today for breakfast. Definitely a bit of a wait to get a table but the food was good. Large portions good food- I got the Reese's Cup hot cakes and they were good until the end when the pancakes soaked up all of the ice cream and got a little too rich. Other than that I was a fan of them.

The apple crepes looked really good as well and are something I would go back to get.

I liked it and would return for sure but at the same time I would put it at just under 5 stars"}
{"text":"I'm always looking for local hole-in-the-walls places that have a feel for the city, people, and culture. Places where the atmosphere is full of history and of course the food is good! This place was both. Nothing glamorous at all but that's why I liked it. I took my family for breakfast and it was a quick and great meal. My daughter and I had the biscuits and gravy and my wife has the veggie breakfast. We all agreed that the food was great! If I had any negatives at all it would be that the temperature was hot inside and the booths are very small, which in my opinion is worth it for the experience. The waitress was pleasant, quick, and helpful. If you are in Pittsburgh and looking for a great breakfast and experience, go here!"}
{"text":"Came here with a group of 6, plus a toddler, midmorning on a Thursday. No wait! The service was EXCELLENT. Quick, friendly, efficient. They anticipated our every need. The inside was larger than you would think as mentioned in several reviews here. Overall I had a great experience. We had probably every breakfast item you could think of at our table (crepes, french toast, pancakes, danish pancakes, eggs, mixed grill, sides of meat) as we went a little crazy with our order, but in particular, I ordered the nutella banana crepe and it was DELICIOUS. It had a whole banana inside! While that was definitely a decadent dish, my fiance ordered the mixed grill which was very healthy and fresh tasting. I would go back!"}
{"text":"Another Pittsburgh legend . Always voted \"best breakfast in the burgh  \" and I have to agree . I like the unusual breakfast combinations . Who can't refuse ice cream on your pancakes in the middle of a hot July ???"}
{"text":"Love Deluca's Eggs Benedict! Crazy busy place, but if you're willing to sit at the counter in the back, you can get seated pretty quickly.  Cash only."}
{"text":"This place is one of the Pittsburgh classic breakfast spots, located in the strip district area, there are often lines out the door on the weekends, much of the hype on this place inevitably leads to this, so unless your up early and out and about, expect to wait if you have a group of people. Also, it should be noted, it's kinda touristsy , by that I mean actual tourists, and weekend tourists in from the suburban cultural wastelands for a authentic Pittsburgh breakfast, like their parents ate, or some such nonsense, so that also means it's pricey for the straight off the Sysco truck food that it is. 
I'm giving this place 5 stars based solely on the absolute ticket slayers that are on open display on the short order line set up they have there, these men are a joy to watch, and the speed at which they got the orders out was honestly pretty impressive, hats off to these cooks!   Total bad asses!!!! That, and the waitress was really nice too!"}
{"text":"Whenever I visit a city that I haven't been to before, I insist on eating at a place that is true to the character of that city.  After my visit to Deluca's, I have no hesitation in claiming that this restaurant is Pittsburgh at its finest.  This efficient and popular greasy-spoon joint serves up hearty meals at a decent price.  

They claim to offer the \"best breakfast in town,\" and I wouldn't argue with that statement...nor would the millions of other people who waited 30+ minutes to even get into the restaurant on the cold, wet, and snowy Saturday morning I went.  I ordered the seasonal pumpkin pancake special, and I was pleasantly surprised that they gave me the option of ordering kielbasa as the side meat instead of just the usual ham or breakfast sausage.

I almost feel bad giving this place just 4 stars because I really liked it.  But alas, it just wasn't my favorite type of food, and as much as the long wait and cash-only policy is characteristic of this diner-style restaurant, it wasn't exactly pleasant.  Beware that if you come during a busy time with a large group (5+ people), expect to wait a bit longer than smaller groups."}
{"text":"We're in the Pittsburgh area visiting from out of town and spotted this place in a sea of chain restaurants and decided to give it a go. Despite our high hopes, the food really fell flat. We were in for lunch and none of us left pleased with our meal, but I will say their breakfast menu looked great - maybe we should have ordered that."}
{"text":"I was seated at the counter immediately. Coffee arrived quickly and my order was taken as soon as I put the menu down . Omelet was large and tasty. Home fries were plentiful. Sever kept my coffee cup full.  Did notice a person at the counter for five minutes that never received attention. He got up and left as I would have."}
{"text":"quick service even when really busy. Huge proportions. Good prices. Lots of menu items and variety to pick from- not just breakfast. the Superbowl omelette is really great and highly recommend it. Friendly staff too."}
{"text":"Califonia Benedict was probably the best breakfast I've ever had.  They place is clean and the service is good. My coffee was never empty."}
{"text":"Picture it: Sicily.  1924.  A young peasant girl with some lire and a dream takes her place in line at a humble trattoria run by fellow paisan, signore DeLuca.

Wait, wait.  I got \"Golden Girls\" mixed up with Yelp.

Picture it: Pittsburgh.  2013.  A [ahem] young couple with some cash and a dream take their place in line at a humble diner run by........someone.  Probably no longer related to the original DeLuca.  At any rate, they were prepared for a long wait; had just hunkered down to weather the blowhard frat type behind them bellowing into his iPhone about the difference between a wine and beer hangover and repeatedly declaring his determination to see what waiting in line for breakfast was all about; when the angel of breakfast mercy, a rotund little bespectacled woman, called out for two people willing to sit at the counter.

Counter, you say?  This particular couple *loves* counter-sitting at greasy spoons, watching short order cooks literally sling hash, fry eggs and flip flapjacks with deft precision and enviable speed.  And so the counter is exactly where they landed this Saturday morning, entranced by the choreography behind it, ignoring the sticky Linoleum floors.  He had Chicken and Waffles -- buckwheat waffle, to be exact -- she the Cinnamon Bun Pancakes.  And, oh.  They were both so happy.  Crisped, crunchy white meat chicken atop a flavorful and toothsome waffle, dusted with powdered sugar and drizzled with syrup; cinnamon-studded hotcakes with swirls of icing and swaths of maple syrup.  Washed down by the requisite *okay* drip coffee.  Served by a manager with his finger on the pulse of every server, line cook and bus boy in the joint.

Cash only, dear reader.

{"text":"There is a line at the door on Saturday mornings, but it moves quickly.  If possible, sit at the counter to watch the frenetic activity at the grill.

The portions are huge and the quality very good.  We enjoyed the ranchero omelet and the French toast with blueberries."}
{"text":"Fun spot to people watch activities on the strip and people watch people inside the diner. Great greasy spoon right on the strip. The french toast made with Mancini's raisin bread was really good. DH had omelette with chorizo and reports that it was pretty spicy. Homefries, which we requested to be extra crispy, were perfect."}
{"text":"The flavors are bursting, and the home fries are truly well made. Pancakes r crispy on the inside and battery, yummy on the inside. I got the California Benedict- ontop of Italian toast, topped with avocado, tomato, spinach, and Asiago cheese. The veggies were extremely fresh and tasted local (maybe it's in my mind) and the hollandaise sauce blended well with the home fries on the side. Ketchup not even needed. Extremely fast and efficient service. The man knew what he was doing.. Didn't let our coffees go empty. You will leave feeling sedated by the heat of the cooking indoors and a happy full belly. Lots to walk around outdoors to walk it off. We will be returning!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  I need to get my pictures of my food on here.  I love it and I will wait however long to sit here and enjoy their delicious breakfast (which is the only thing I have ever had).  Love it."}
{"text":"After stopping in Pittsburgh during a road trip, I was starving for some grub. I searched my trusty yelp app and discovered Deluca's. I remembered the name and place from an episode of Diners, Drive-Ins & Dives and jumped at the chance to try some food because Guy Fieri knows his ISH!

SO its in a strip mall, weird i know. Its kind of hidden, not a huge sign to say Delucas but nevertheless we got there.

Its a diner true and true. Red bar stools, black and white checkered floors, all the retro diner decor. I loved it!

So my husband got the MOAB or \"Mother of all burritos\"...PACKED to the brim with onions, eggs, sausage, bacon chorizo breakfast potatoes, you name it. It was the size of his head im not even exaggerating. It was so flavorful. for $9?! SCORE!!!!

I got a chicken fingers basket because i was craving fries. I was kind of upset because they serve shoestring fries and i didnt get what i wanted out of it. The chicken fingers were hand breaded and you can definetly tell the difference. They arent frozen and are steaming hot and fresh!!

I give this place 3 stars because the service was HORRIBLE. Our waitress was like 80, you could tell she didnt want to be bothered  let alone do her job. She moped around, got us our drinks took our order and never came back. The she just handed the receipt to us without even asking if we wanted dessert or anything else. Like shoo'ing us away."}
{"text":"The lobster bisque was amazing.  The Super Bowl omelet was different but a definite touchdown.  I would have never thought mashed potatoes would work so well in an omelet. i Would have given 5 stars if they used a list like Pamela's instead of standing in line."}
{"text":"I finally visited this place.  I, however, did not order the famous breakfast pancakes with ice cream and whipped topping.  Instead, I got a fish sandwich and fries.  My friends ordered breakfast and they said it was delicious.  The fish sandwich was good.  It was what I expected.  The water tasted terrible.

The restaurant was extremely busy.  It took us at least a half hour or more to get in the door.  Every employee was running around like crazy and the kitchen floor was covered in food.  It was so busy that there was no time for them to clean.  

The seating is cramped and there really is no ambiance.  I recommend ordering the pancakes featured on Man vs. Food to experience what the place is famous for.  

The low score is due to the wait-time, cramped feeling when entering and sitting down at a table, and the overall craziness all around you while eating.

I don't really have the urge to return unless there is no line to get in."}
{"text":"I always enjoy my visits to pittsburgh. I was especially excited to visit after finding out there was a great place for breakfast that was on the travel network (man vs. food). I am a true food lover and Food Network and Travel Channel must really love pittsburgh. They are always on man vs food and diners, drive ins and dives. 
I found out the hard way that just because you are showcased on a dandy show doesn't mean your food is up to par. 
Just to make it very clear I am a southerner. I did however go to delucas with my girlfriend who was born and raised in pittsburgh and surrounding suburbs. So I was able to look past the brash attitude of the person at the register yelling at my girlfriend instead of seating us. She however was pretty turned off by it. 
There wasn't a wait. We got seated pretty quickly after my girlfriend had to let the lady know we were there well before the ambush of people that poured in after we arrived. (that's when my girlfriend got yelled at) 
After being seated I was really excited about the food. The place was hoppin and the coffee was really good. The menu had a huge list of things to choose from. I thought it was going to be a great place. I had really high hopes.
The server we had was ok. Not very friendly but efficient. She was the shorter of the two I saw. We kind of wished we had the tall girl. She seemed a lot more friendly. 
We didn't wait too long to get our food but when we got it you would have thought it would have taken a couple hours. I got the biscuits and gravy (one of my favorite breakfast foods) and potatoes. They were both stone cold. The gravy on the biscuits was more like a soup and the potatoes were well cold. I really couldn't get passed the fact that my food was cold. 
My girlfriend got the california omelette with potatos and fruit with the Italian toast. She like the fruit and toast but that was it. I almost choked on my sausage gravy when I saw her omelette. It was practically black. I know sometimes people over cook eggs. It's not cool but it happens. How do you even send eggs out that are practically black. I guess at least it was hot. Her potatoes needless to say were also cold.
I was really looking forward to eating at a delicious breakfast place in pittsburgh. I was disappointed."}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast dish would be anything with poached eggs and some kind of sauce on it. I continue to visit Delucas because they have been able to perfectly poach every single egg I've ever had there. EVERY. SINGLE. EGG. They are seriously never overdone and are perfect. PERFECT. 

I've only had eggs Benedict type breakfast plates and shakes there, but I've been with others who have tried different options. Everything else was described as \"good, typical breakfast food.\"

Sometimes there is a wait (especially on weekends), but service is usually pretty quick and generally pretty good. They aren't the nicest or friendliest servers. They're not rude, and they are good at their jobs. They typically won't sit at your table and chat, but they are quick and usually don't mess anything up. 

If you like a lot of different options for breakfast food, Delucas is the place to go."}
{"text":"It is what it is. The original Pittsburgh greasy spoon. No frills here just good old fashioned GRUB. you cannot go wrong with anything. Coffee quickly served. Staff always friendly. Always a crowd. Be patient, take it all in, every walk of Pittsburgh life eats here."}
{"text":"Well, I finally caved.  After years of resisting that persistent, daunting line that has become a rite of Pittsburgh passage, I finally braved the wait and went to Deluca's.

Perhaps it was due to good company (or the first signs of sun this spring), but the 30+ minute wait that we endured seemed to go relatively quick.  After finally making it to the doorway, we were asked to come in by the hostess, only to be left inside the doorway with no real inclination of whether we should proceed to one of the several open tables or wait.  When we finally tracked down the hostess again, she said we needed us to wait to sit down as to, \"not upset the chef.\"

Fast forward, and we've finally sat down (in the seat Tom Cruise filmed Jack Reacher nonetheless).  After attempting the scan the entirely too complex menu (do you really need multiple versions of what is essentially the same dish?), we settled on the breakfast burrito, the seafood benedict, the seafood omelette (same as the seafood benedict, just with the bread on the side instead of under) and the apple pancake sundae (figured go big or go home).

Within about fifteen minutes, the burrito, benedict and omelette were brought out.   By this point, out entire party was starving and I told everyone to go ahead and get started (the server said my pancakes would be another minute).  Overall, each were about the most stereo-typically bland diner food you could ever get.  But, fast forward twenty minutes...  still no pancakes (and everyone else has finished).

Once the server finally made it back around, she mentioned something in passing about the apples on the pancake and left again (we had no idea what she said).  After another five minutes or so, my pancakes finally came out, and by this point, ready to leave, I succumbed to hunger and dove in.

Bland... bland... bland... and an associated stomach ache from the pure sugar rush.  After chewing through about half the plate, I gave up on it (I almost never leave food on the plate).  Ready to go, we asked for the check, with the one saving grace that redeemed Deluca's from one star being the server proactively taking the pancakes off of our tab.

Check this off the list as a one and done."}
{"text":"Love this place omg! Just wish it wasn't always so crowded. The prices are cheap and you get PLENTY of food for the price. Waiters are usually friendly when I come in so that's not an issue, only issue is parking. The strip district is always busy. It's worth the parking hassle!! :)"}
{"text":"This is a classic diner: a little dingy, the service was kind of rushed, and the food is alright. The prices are decent for what you get. I'm not sure we'd come back here."}
{"text":"We stayed in downtown Pittsburgh to get the full city experience. This place was supposed to have the best breakfast, but I didn't find anything special about it. I got the Italian Vegetarian Fritatta. Some of the veggies were cooked okay, but the onions were not. They ruined the dish by the bitter flavor (which I have found are usually reflective of 'old' onions). Others had the full stack of pancakes, blueberry french toast, raspberry crepes, and kid's chocolate chip pancakes.nothing really amazing there either. Nobody finished their food. That is either because they gave us a lot (in most cases) or the person did not like it enough to over stuff themselves to finish it. We ended up leaving with lots of leftovers, and my son who wasn't with us when we went enjoyed eating them. But he also is a very hungry teenager with a large appetite :).

Also only takes cash. No checks or credit."}
{"text":"Great place for local flavor! This is a wonderful place if you are looking for a great taste of Pittsburgh. You will stand in line to get a table but it is well worth the wait. 


Don't miss the chicken and waffles!"}
{"text":"I believe we got there after their rush because the floor was totally trashed.  Although the employees were great about clearing off the tables, they certainly could have taken a broom to the floor; especially since at this point there were only several tables ever occupied while we were there.

Anyhow, I had an omelet with avocado & Asiago.  While the taste was good, I personally prefer a fluffy omelet, whereas theirs are overcooked a bit with a slight brown \"burn\" to it.  It makes it a bit dry.  Hubby had eggs, ham & pancakes.  He told me how good their ham is and he was right!  Absolutely delicious.  Of course I tried his pancake, too.  Nothing out out of the ordinary, but still good.

Prices are kind of high if you ask me.  Better rating if you would learn to keep the establishment alot cleaner."}
{"text":"The best french toast in the city. Small, french bread slices soaked in egg, and hit with just the right amount of butter.

Deluca's inside is filthy. They know it, and they love it. The hours are weird, though they're open into the mid-afternoon. I liked Deluca's UNTIL I discovered JoJo's, which is nearby, but closes at noon. Now, Deluca's feels second rate, because I'm an eggs, meat, and potatoes person more than a griddle dude.

If it was the other way around, Deluca's might be my favorite."}
{"text":"Food was great. Service was quick. Very, very busy place. We waiting in line outside for about 20 mins before we could get a seat. It moved pretty fast and they get tables turned quickly. We both had eggs and bacon with homefries. I also had pancakes. All the food was good for diner food."}
{"text":"This is my go-to breakfast joint in Pittsburgh, especially since it's open super early so I can stop by after getting off night shift. Their menu is huge. Whatever you're craving, they have it! I usually go for one of their eggs benedict dishes or an omelette. Prices are low and portions are huge! It is a really popular place so there's almost always a wait, but once you sit down and order your food comes out unbelievably quickly. Parking can be tough sometimes."}
{"text":"Love this greasy-spoon spot in its original instantiation down in the strip, and I love it out in Robinson. Friendly service, short-order food (we had four of us, including two kids, out). They didn't charge extra for hot chocolate refills, and that's a winner in my book. I ate fried eggs, sausage, pancakes, and had coffee, and I loved it all - but diner food is sorta my thing. I love it as long as it ain't bad, and this was good.

There was a mistake on one of the ordered meals, and the server took the plate away (for good) saying she'd adjust the tab, but then she took off maybe $2 rather than the cost of the meal we didn't eat or take with us. I wasn't the one paying the bill, and this fact was confusing to the point at which I didn't understand that's what she did until it wasn't worth going back to address. (If you take someone's mostly-full plate without offering a replacement, you gotta take that whole order off the tab...).

Apart from that oddity and some wet silverware, the meal was priced reasonably and the food was good - I'd surely go back."}
{"text":"Delucas,

the iconic Pittsburgh breakfast spot in the strip. People rave about this place and Pamelas, and to both i wonder why? 

I see lines of people waiting outside of Deluca's and I wonder how many of these are returning customers or people just inspired by the novelty.

This is not to say its bad, but it IS overrated.

My better half and I both arrived with starving appetites, and the portions were very generous. I give them kudos for prompt service in the malestrom of customers. The menu options are diverse and unique. Perhaps if I try more I could revamp my opinion.

I ordered a concoction of fried chicken, gravy, home fries and scrambled eggs. It was greasy and tasty, but maybe my expectations were too high? Perhaps I have also been spoiled by similar food elsewhere in Pittsburgh that remains off the beaten path and for half the price. Thanks Delucas, it was fun, but its me...not you. We can still be friends right?"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my breakfast at Deluca's!  I was visiting a good friend in Pittsburgh about two weeks ago, and she insisted that we go to Deluca's before hitting an arts festival and Pride.

First of all, our waitress was fantastic.  She was patient with me being overwhelmed by the extensive menu, and she was on top of everything when it came to keeping us good and caffeinated.

I ordered the Huevos Rancheros, while my friend got the Breakfast of Champs with chocolate chip pancakes.  The Huevos Rancheros were great, the Spanish sauce was kinda sweet and very unique.  It was fantastic!  My friend's breakfast was HUGE, and those pancakes were perfect.

Loved the spot, the diner was super charming, and the service was wonderful.  I'd definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"No Stiller's tickets this past Sunday so waited till near game time to visit.  Shortest line I have ever seen.  Food and atmosphere are pure Pittsburgh.   Our group had Steel City breakfast, waffles, pancakes, and french toast.  Huge portions and delicious on top of that.  The \"Baltimore Blows\" shirts worn by many wait staff were perfect."}
{"text":"Great breakfast place in the city.  It's best to try to get here early on the weekends or come on the weekdays due to all of the regulars and tourists on the weekends. They have huge portions for a reasonable price.  It is your typical \"no frills\" diner but that is the beauty of it.  I really enjoy the California benedict."}
{"text":"Waiter was excellent
Coffee was terrible, pancakes were just ok
Specialty breakfast was ok as well"}
{"text":"I feel like my experiences here have been a miss but other customers have had hits. I'm not sure whether I just have bad luck or if my expectations for food and service are high, but I don't think I'm asking too much when all I'm looking for is quality food and attentive waiters.

The first time I came to Deluca's I ordered one of their extravagant sweet pancakes. I was so excited for it, but was incredibly disappointed when I was instead served a burnt pancake that was barely edible... I'm not sure why you would even think it's okay to serve burnt pancakes, but needless to say, I was not impressed with Deluca's since then. 

Fast forward to 2013 when I decided to give the place another try since there's always so much hype about this place. This time around, I tried the california eggs benedict. Was it hands down the most delicious eggs benedict I've ever had? Definitely not, but it was decent enough. I also ordered a strawberry banana milkshake, which was a great disappointment. I thought it tasted watery and expensive for the quality of the drink--I'm never getting that again.

There's always been a small line on Saturday mornings and they're cash only, so by no means am I itching to come back anytime soon. Also, they're always so busy that the service is subpar. Waiters are only there to grab your orders and have no interest in showing any appreciation for their customers. The wait for our check took forever as well because our server was inattentive. 

Deluca's will do the trick if you need a breakfast place to go to but I've placed it dead last on my list. I've had much better experiences and great food in other places like Pamela's and the Original Pancake House."}
{"text":"Went back and forth on my rating decision here. The food is certainly a five, the service a three (only somewhat fast, not particularly friendly, and expect to have to ask for refills on anything). The overall experience is in the middle as you are dealing with a ton of tasty options, a comfortable environment, a nice location for a Saturday brunch (outside of the wait and the parking challenges) and solid classic diner experience. 

The price also is only decent, and though it's a single dollar sign option many of the menu items will push closer to the upper end. I had the breakfast burrito with their special sauce and yes that sauce was special, absolutely delicious. Couldn't find the breakfast menu anywhere online, so giving that as a personal recommendation.

Worth a stop if you happen to be in the Strip."}
{"text":"We have only been coming here for 25 years. I had to shout out because it's been five or so since my last visit. Some things are just worth coming back to. 
Benedict on Mancinis? Absolutely!!!
Priced right and worth the wait. 
Don't forget to bring CASH."}
{"text":"I like!  Here's my take:

PROS:
- Food is great. Is there a better traditional breakfast in Pittsburgh?  I doubt it!
- The breakfast sandwich is my fave. Eggs, spicy sausage, and cheese on Mancini's bread. Just do it. 
- Service is very quick and efficient. Try to run out of coffee. You can't!
- The menu is huge, lots of good stuff to try. 

CONS:
- Its CASH ONLY, and it's now year 2018...  And that's all I can offer on the negative side. 

If you've had this on your list but still haven't tried it, DO IT NOW!  Then write a Yelp review!!!"}
{"text":"I always made fun of all the people standing in line on the weekend mornings waiting to have breakfast at DeLuca's that was until I found myself waiting in that same line. I happened to be in Pittsburgh for the weekend visiting friends when it was suggested to try the place out. There had to be 30 or so people in line waiting to get into the place on a Saturday morning. It probably took 30 to 45 minutes to get to the front but the plus side is there is a coffee shop a few doors down to get something warm to drink. When we finally got it we were seated at the counter which was a fine place to sit considering you can watch all the cooks running around like crazy turning out food by the minute. There are lots of things that look good but I settled on an omelet with a bunch of vegetables and covered in three kinds of cheese that was downright awesome. My friend also had some combination of eggs and veggies which he proceeded to polish off something I could not do. We were also witness to a few people tackling the pancakes with the sundae on top. Good luck with that on early morning. I am not sure it is the best breakfast in town but it is certainly worth the wait especially if it's not too cold outside. I will be back."}
{"text":"No two ways about it, this is a classic old style diner.  It has been in existance since 1951.  I went on a Fri morning and they were crowded but I was able to get a seat at the counter.  I was told that it would have been much busier on a sat or sun.

There was some disagreement between two waitresses as who would take my order.  A few sharp words were spoken between them.

First thing, the menu is a novel.  It takes too long to read it.  Places that concentrate on making a few items generally do a better job at it.  

I didn't have to wait too long for my breakfast.  I ordered eggs benedict with a side of corned beef hash browns.  The eggs were cooked perfectly but the sauce was not a hollandaise and had no lemon flavor at all.  That detracted from the flavor.  

One thing to know ahead of time is that they only take cash.  No credit cards.  Apparently this is somewhat common in the Strip from what I was told."}
{"text":"I took my husband and kids here.  The food was ok.  My husband was disappointed and said the potatoes were gross and didn't eat them! But honestly if you go here you are going to get a good diner meal! The menu is big.  I suggest getting your standard breakfast!"}
{"text":"Yes, Deluca's is the iconic breakfast spot in Pittsburgh and one of the few places I will wait in line for breakfast on a weekend.  In the snow.  Why?  Do you really need reasons?  Well, for one, the breakfast burrito that barely fits on the plate.  For another, the Steel City Breakfast of Champions that includes all the breakfast food staples.  Need more?  The Bionic Omelet made of 6 eggs and as many fillings.  I've taken on all of these challenges (not at once) and triumphed 2 of the 3 times.  (The Bionic Omelet's onions got the better of me and I just couldn't finish.)  And I just have to love any place that serves Mancini's Italian toast.

This place can get busy, but it runs like a machine.  Sit at the counter by the grill on a Saturday or Sunday morning and just watch in amazement at how quickly and efficiently orders are filled when there's a line out the door.  Sometimes the wait service can be a little slow.  And it is still a cash only establishment.  But it is still my go-to breakfast spot in the Strip.  The prices I sometimes feel can be a little steep, but then I see the portion size and it makes sense.  Deluca's is always, in a word, dependable."}
{"text":"A great breakfast place!  The place can use a make over, but I thought it was charming and you went back in time with the red and white checkered floors, and what looked liked original counter and green worn leather stools.  The staff was nice and friendly too.  I stayed at the Westin Hotel and it was about a 10 block walk (1 mile).  My husband and I shared the Steeler breakfast plate and it was one of the best breakfests we had.  It was a good thing we shared bc it came with 2 toasts, 2 (8\") pancakes, 1 (5\") sweet sausage, 2 slices bacon, home fries, 2 eggs.  Every item was cooked perfect and the pancakes were the best I had at a restaurant, a bit crispy and fluffy inside.   Too bad we were so full and couldn't finish the pancakes and toast.  Everything else we finished with a smile.  The portions are large.  We had 2 cups of very good coffee and the Steeler special and our bill was $12.  A bargain for all we had.  

If I ever come back to Pittsburgh, I would go there again and try more of the resturants on the Strip District."}
{"text":"Friendly Service and amazing food.  Great for breakfast with friends or family. Be prepared to wait if you go on a weekend.  We done on Friday at 10:30am and waited approximately 10 minutes, much quicker than the weekend.  CASH ONLY, so you know it's legit!"}
{"text":"In town for the 3-day weekend, I wanted to try some of the more popular spots in Pittsburgh.

Since Deluca's is popular -- hey, it has been on TV! -- I expected to be disappointed.  Nope.  The menu was gigantic -- as big as the portions.

The cinnamon bun hotcakes with the warm, gooey, sweet apples, glazed pecans, and gratuitous whipped cream and vanilla ice cream?  Surprisingly great -- just a great balance of flavors and textures.

The only misfire was on the cheesesteak omelet -- it was supposed to come with a sauce.  When I mentioned it to the waiter, he thought it needed one, too -- but didn't know that it did.  Not a big deal that he didn't know -- just that it did need something.  Eh, I had the hotcakes to share anyway; there was plenty of food on the table.

I'm glad I don't live in Pittsburgh.  I'd be 50 pounds heavier.

FYI cash only."}
{"text":"After reading some positive reviews, we decided to venture over to the Strip District to round up some brunch at Deluca's. It seemed like the rest of the city had the same idea, but I was committed to visiting here and leaving satisfied. Done.

Yes, you'll wait for a table (and probably even wait outside), but the cooks, servers and bus boys moved very efficiently, knocking out orders for all the small booths and tables. Once we were seated, one menu item called out to me: Texas Cinnamon French Toast with eggs and bacon. Oh, and coffee, of course.

In no time at all, it was all sitting in front of me and in no time at all, it was all gone. The scrambled eggs were pretty standard, the bacon was perfectly cooked (not fatty and not burnt to a crisp) and the French toast was sweet and delicious, even without adding any syrup.

As already mentioned, the service was prompt and the prices were reasonable. However, this is a \"Cash Only\" spot, so keep the plastic in your wallet."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews about the line and wait, we got here at about 8:00 on a Saturday morning and were seated right away. The menu is extensive and I was having a hard time choosing what to get. After some thought, I went with the strawberry pancakes and scrambled eggs. Breakfast sausage came with it but that went to my husband. He ordered a breakfast sandwich, after seeing the amazing bread it came on. One thing I liked was that they were really accommodating with making things just the way you want. My husband wanted scrambled eggs on his breakfast sandwich and that wasn't a problem! Service was quick and our food arrived shortly.

My pancakes were delicious, however I was disappointed with the strawberries-they were FROZEN! Well, thawed out but a mushy, pre-frozen strawberry mess! I understand this is a diner, but I guess in June I was just expecting some fresh strawberries. The eggs were good, nothing spectacular. My husband enjoyed his breakfast sandwich but said the sausage that came with mine was tough and he didn't eat much of it. We were in and out in less than 30 minutes.

Overall, it was a decent breakfast, but I would definitely order something different if I were to return. The service was fast and friendly, but I would have been disappointed if we had waited awhile for that breakfast."}
{"text":"Deluca's is a great diner in the strip district! I love their eggs benedict and pancakes both are amazing! It is really fun to sit at the counter and watch them cook while you eat!! You won't be disappointed but make sure you get there early on Saturdays!"}
{"text":"First time here and I loved it! I left planning my next visit.
The wait seemed long, but it only took about 20 minutes. Don't come here to dine and catch up with friends because the food comes out very quickly and they are constantly having people in and out. I expected that and that was exactly what I wanted. I think I was there for 20 to 30 minutes. 
I expect that everything there is amazing and can't wait to try french toast. 

Definitely go here if you are looking for GOOD, cheap food and quick service!"}
{"text":"A very long line for lunch. Waited about 30 mins for a table. The food was good as other diners I been at. The pancakes were a bit flat then what I'm use to. The south of the border omelette was more of a egg scramble than omelette. The service was fast and the prices were good, but the line is long."}
{"text":"We came to Deluccas after a concert, (hangover was in full force) we heard it was a local spot and had to check it out. I'm not a huge breakfast person but my omelet was DELICIOUS. I tried to eat all of it!! When I'm back in Pittsburgh I will definitely be coming back. Our waitress was great! Speedy and funny!  Only downside was the cash only!"}
{"text":"I love Deluca's, they are proud of their traditional breakfast and the do it well. The ingredients are always fresh, the service is excellent and the menu gives you lots of options.

Here are some things you should know:

The Strip District location is cash only, but there is a newer Robinson location that takes credit cards. There are several ATM's close by ion the Strip in case you forget.

You can make reservations 24 hours in advance for parties of 6 or more. It's a great idea, especially given the lines that often go outside the door.

Deluca's is not for everybody, it's classic diner with a great reputation and they are reluctant to change. But the food is good and it's a perennial favorite and a source of pride for many Pittsburghers.

There is a hustle and bustle to Deluca's.  It's people on their way to a game, or on their way to shop in the Strip. There's a kind of excitement here which you may not find relaxing, but it's part of Pittsburgh tradition and worth experiencing.

There some unusual ethnic dishes which are quite good, for example, a Greek omelet with Feta cheese and Spinach. Pierogies. 

I like their traditional breakfast, especially because their potatoes are always served perfect. The buckwheat pancakes are something unique as well.

Deluca's is a must for anyone who wants to fully experience Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Come here for a good hearty breakfast of absurd proportions, but be prepared to wait.  if food were my only concern, I would not hesitate to say DeLuca's is one of the best breakfast joints in the 'burgh.  Alas, they have terrible coffee, and for me, that's a deal-breaker."}
{"text":"I genuinely do not understand the hype about this place. I'm all for waiting in line for 30-45 minutes if the place is \"worth the wait\", but sadly this is not the case. 

My family of 5 was split into two tables, we were told they were not allowed to seat 5 people in a booth, even though we voiced our preference was to be together. That's fine, everyone has rules. Their entire back section was reserved for a party of 20, which was expected to show up about 10 minutes after our arrival. This party of 20 never showed up and the diner staff never offered that we be moved to those tables where we would've been able to sit altogether. Minor detail, but it would've been greatly appreciated. 

When I ordered my breakfast, I paused waiting for the waitress to ask me how I like my eggs, bacon or sausage, etc. When I paused, she snapped back and said, \"You have to tell me how you want your eggs.\" It was so short & so rude. 

The food was subpar, it was at least cheap but so was the quality. 

These instances are small in nature, but they were not countered with any redeeming qualities. All in all, this place was not worth it: the line was long, the service was horrific, and the food was terrible. After years working in hospitality, I tend to be pretty lenient and understanding of the different struggles that go into a restaurant. This place does not deserve leniency or your time."}
{"text":"Had the seafood omelette, it was great. Sat at the diner and the waitress was very friendly & nice. Refilled my coffee promptly. I would definitely return for breakfast again."}
{"text":"The crepes and the omelette are simply delicious. I tried the newyorker omelette and pecan banana crepe and they both are awesome. Large portion size and extremely satisfying. The service is very prompt and the place is buzzing!!!!!!. Coffee is a little below par, but the bread from local bakery is very fresh. The reason I docked one point was for the wait time and they only accept cash."}
{"text":"My dad and I went to deluca's for breakfast while we were in Pittsburgh. We had heard that deluca's was very good, we also heard that it was always hard to get a seat. When we got there the line was just coming outside the door a little so we didn't expect much of a wait, but when we got there their was no wait. We were seated almost immediately at the front counter. I got the banana split hot cakes while my dad had the Pittsburg slam. My food was delicious, my dad also enjoyed his meal. The only thing that I could see as a problem is that a party of 3 or more would have to wait a while for seating."}
{"text":"Ok, I'll admit that I came here because I hear it's the official breakfast spot for the Obamas.  It was just after I grabbed a spot at the counter that I realized it wasn't.  It's fine, I was a bit hungover from a wild Friday night so a diner breakfast was just what the doctor ordered.

Service was fine, but the food wasn't particularly memorable.  I would never spend 20+ minutes in line waiting for a spot.  Ordered a omelette, which was massive, but I prefer diced veggies, and theirs were sliced and overly sautéed.

I also think the prices are a bit high for the quality.  $14 for omelet and OJ is what it costs for my favorite diner in SF."}
{"text":"Food is good. The place is very clean. However, customer service is lacking. I was trying to pay my bill and the lady told me it will be a second. She finished cashing out someone and then walked away and started getting people coffee etc. Very rude."}
{"text":"Have been Pittsburgh for almost 4 years now and have passed here many times, impressed with the line on the weekend. Finally went and I'm clueless as to why the line is so long, aside from the many options on the menu. I got an omelette and my dining partner got some eggs with bacon and potatoes. Both dishes were ok, but they're nothing that I can't make at home with groceries from the Strip. Service was efficient and payment is cash only (PNC location within like 100 ft of the restaurant)."}
{"text":"So before visiting Pittsburgh, I asked friends from the area where I needed to go for food. And DeLuca's Diner on the Strip was recommended. Naturally since Sunday was nicer out than on Saturday, that area was not favorable for parking. So we saw that a second location was open about 20+minutes out. Sweet, so we made our was to this location under the thought that we'd have no problems. I wish I had a crystal ball, hell I would've settled for a magic 8 ball. 

We go inside and there are two other couples waiting. Cool no problem. The wait was barely five minutes. Get seated in a booth. Great! Look over the menu. Order a Large orange juice. The server comes back we place our order. I order the California Benedict, and then the other order was the Omelette Special. Alright, Simple enough!

Then I start observing. The booth next to us, a party of five, seemed to get there orders, but not at the same time, and the timing between their orders being delivered was staggered at best. This seemed troubling, but I kept observing. At one point one of the bidders was sweeping near us and made some loud comment about how he \"needed to get paid.\" Um awkward. Oh look another plate came for the party of five, still three more to go. Needless to say it took awhile for them to get their orders. This continued to be unsettling. Then I overhear the booth behind me, their server apologized, and told them that she'd give them a discount for the inconvenient wait time. Wow, that's cool. The whole time we waited, we never once were visited by our server, given an update on the order. No offer of coffee. Almost 45min goes by and we get our food. 45 minutes, and it was close to closing time. 

Food arrives. And presentation was .......lacking at best. My home fries looked different from those on the other plate. My overall plate just wasn't great. The omelette was burnt. Like making an omelette should be apart of Breakfast 101. Cooking multiple orders shouldn't be rocket science, contrary to the outer space mural on the wall. 

When it came time to pay. We asked if we could leave the tip with the cashier. She said to just leave it on the table, well the table was already being bussed, and after the busser made that comment, we weren't exactly jumping to drop it on the table. 

Maybe it's a locals favorite, maybe the original spot is better. But I wouldn't waste the time going here again if I'm back in Pittsburgh. Service is key, even if thevwait is horrendous."}
{"text":"My friend took me here, after months of us meaning to try it. 

The location is in a plaza (near IKEA), but the old timey diner makes you feel like you've stepped back into time. The dining furniture was worn, but clean. Very vintage.

The waitress was annoyed we didn't know what we wanted to eat within 2 minutes. She gave us coffee and warm cream, but never asked if we wanted a refill. Our food came our fast and the order was accurate. My eggs were very oily/buttery so I only ate one yolk (over easy), it was cold. My pancakes looked great, but were flavorless. It was the first time I thought \"did I just order lumpy, mushy flour for food?\". I ate most of the topping, but was underwhelmed. My friend enjoyed her meal, so I pretended that I had eaten earlier. The waitress didn't ask how my food was, so I didn't say anything. 

Afterward, I grabbed something from Starbucks since I was still hungry."}
{"text":"Make reservations to avoid the line. But even with a line, they turn tables quick. My 20 minute wait was worth it. 

Ambience: First this is your classic greasy spoon diner and dive kind of place. It is not fancy. It is classic. 

Service: nice, courteous, and efficient. I watched them systematically clean up, re-seat, and keep it moving. Their hustle and bustle is an art in itself.  But for them to be as attentive, letting us know the status of the table, just kept sort of checking up with us as we stood there, it was pretty impressive... Then our Waitress was smiling thru my kids changing their minds and all their city slicker requests for this and that on the side. Appreciated her patience... She checked up during meal at the right times. And she had a quick chat with us before she handed the check over. She was just real nice.... Some of the best restaurants in the world could learn from this pretty humble easygoing waitstaff. 

Food: it was everything you expected, wanted and more. Everything was pretty much perfect for a diner. Waffles were fluffy and perfectly cooked. Home fries were delicious. And their version of eggs Benedict was amazing. 

Verdict: 5 stars for it's perfectly classic meal and for its reasonable prices."}
{"text":"We had been wanting to try Deluca's since they opened. Today we got our chance. It was a complete disappointment. We ordered the mixed grill, vegetables were steamed and tasteless.  We also ordered a breakfast burrito with chorizo sausage. It was overcooked and almost inedible. We also got the chicken fried chicken, eggs, and biscuits which was the only saving grace to the meal. I believe our first time at Deluca's will be our last. There are too many other better choices in Robinson to waste money there again. What a disappointment."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast and it did not disappoint. Had to wait about 20 minutes for a table on a Sunday morning. The food portions were generous. I had a Nutella/banana crepe, which had a full banana stuffed inside it. Everything I saw come out to nearby tables looked delicious. Reasonable prices and friendly service."}
{"text":"My dad & I walked from downtown Pittsburgh because we heard Deluca's had the best breakfast in Pittsburgh. When we got there, the line was out the door. After 20 minutes, we got a table. It was a small little diner, but the food was very good. I got French toast & bacon. My dad got a ham & cheese omelet. We were both pleased with our meals & left full. We will definitely be going back when we return to Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"DeLuca's is a real Pittsburgh gem. Expect a line if you come here on the weekends, unless you are a very early riser! Last time I came was on a Friday around 9:00 am. By 10:00 am, there was a line out the door and that is pretty typical for this place.

DeLuca's walls are covered in Pittsburgh history, making wait for your breakfast not so bad! The diner is also a lot bigger than expected, it goes back pretty far. Do not expect servers that want to chat with you- this is a BUSY breakfast spot! Never the less, the service has always been great when I have visited. 

My boyfriend and I love this place and have been here so many times, but my parents have never been until I brought them here last month! They were SO impressed by the huge portions they received and loved everything. My dad had the Steel City Breakfast Of Champs, which consisted of a Short stack of pancakes, 2 eggs, 2 pcs of bacon, sausage, homefries & toast (mancini's toast to be exact). He loved everything and was really impressed with the pancakes! They were perfectly fluffy and just delicious. I had the hotcake special and loved every minute of it. They made my egg whites perfectly and the bacon was super good! My mom had an omelette and loved it as well! I've also had their specialty pumpkin pancakes and they are insanely good as well!

If you have never been to DeLuca's, you need to right now. Genuine Pittsburgh breakfast and you will leave full and VERY happy!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best breakfast place in the Burgh!  You will wait in line and you will not regret the wait.  Try the eggs benedict!"}
{"text":"Pamela's gets way too much credit in this town.  Deluca's, located in the heart of the strip district, is a daytime only diner with no frills, just the freshest, most delicious breakfast you can get in the city.  It's on my list of places I miss in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Breakfast is by far my favorite meal of the day. Some days I like it so much that I eat it twice (not at the same time, well mostly). So please understand that my rating is serious! as a serious breakfast connoisseur. Deluca's gets hype because it's awesome. It's not fancy. but it is some serious down to earth good breakfast foods. no pomp, no circumstance. just food. and a good amount of it also. I can often be found here eating eggs benedict, with reckless abandon, a big grin on my face, and a side of bacon well done. 

Favorite foods:
Greek Eggs benedict! steak tomato and feta? INSANE.
Seafood benedict! equally insane
Any of their pancakes (I don't even like pancakes, but I like theirs)

There is some times a wait, but they really do their best to keep it moving, and the staff are all super nice and speedy at getting you your future food coma. I'm not a fan of their coffee (read my reviews about my coffee snobbery elsewhere) but it will get the job done, eyes bright and alert! - their proximity to 21st street coffee as well as all of the other wonderful places in the strip makes a visit here a great start to all days that end in Y. 

They are cash only but there is a PNC ATM 2-3 doors down. I'm a repeat customer, a fan, and I'm sure you will be too."}
{"text":"I love good breakfast, authentic eateries, and a wild environment; and, Deluca's has it all. It's no surprise that one can wait up to an hour in a line snaking down the block for a table on Saturday or Sunday morning.

While my friend Chris and Callen were waiting in line for Pens tickets, I decided to hit up the Strip District and check out this breakfast institution. It's been featured on the Travel and Food networks, and I knew I was in store for something special. There was a huge line of people waiting in freezing weather. Since I was alone, I decided to try and skip the huge line and nab a seat at the bar, which was a stellar idea.

The service here was great. Although everyone working here was buzzing around at incredible speeds, they still regularly checked in on me. After I ordered my food, it came out quickly and I had my refills of coffee. The atmosphere here is my favorite part. A long, counter bar runs the length of the establishment. Behind it are cooks hard at work on equipment that must be at least fifty years old. It it's not broken, don't fix it! I was also in the back, in full veiw of a wipeboard that helps employees keep track of everything. They needed to order five box of coffee and also didn't want employees to forget the holiday bowling party.  Simply put: this place is fun.

The coffee is whatever, not bad, not great. For the food, I knew as soon as my eyes set on it: MOAB, or mother of all burritos. This was a huge soft tortilla filled with chorizo, scrambled eggs, hot banana peppers, tomatoes, onions, avocado and homefries. It's topped with salsa, cheddar and sour cream. Overall, delicious. There's a lot of flavors going on, but I really enjoyed this, and it was certainly filling enough to keep me going until dinner. Deluca's doesn't use the best ingredients, and it wasn't the most delicious breakfast, but I really enjoyed my visit. I'd go again.

Bottom Line: Enjoy the show by sitting at the bar. Marvel at the staff, and soak up the atmosphere. The food's not bad either. Cash only."}
{"text":"You can overlook a lot of things when the food is good however the food was terrible. Our waiter was under the influence of something  and high. The place is kind of dirty. They have a box fan hanging from the ceiling as a \"ceiling fan\". We are from our of town and travel often (on average 12days a month) and use Yelp as a guide to great food. Unfortunately this is not it. Oh and there was a 30-45 min line outside that we waited in just to have terrible service and mediocre at best food."}
{"text":"This has been the worst customer service I've ever encountered! I don't care if you're busy, you can still be nice to your paying customers! Not worth the wait."}
{"text":"Came here for Sunday brunch with a large group if friends. Our wait was somewhere between 30-45 min and we were hungry!! Only made me that more excited to try this place as we were from out of town. My boyfriend ordered the country fried steak and I ordered the French toast. We both really enjoyed our meals and this concluded our weekend trip to Pittsburgh beautifully. I would definitely return next time I'm in the Pittsburgh area."}
{"text":"Giant portions. Fast and furious service. Good value.  A really fun diner experience."}
{"text":"You'd have a better breakfast at Pamela's or Kelly O's. It is definitely not worth the wait in line. The employees are very miserable, except for the young boy at the register. Food is decent, if you don't mind employees poking their fingers in your food without gloves. They just can't seem to get the orders right. Walk the extra block or two, for a better breakfast all around."}
{"text":"This is what I consider the quintessential American diner. 4 stars for the food and 1 star for the authentic experience. 

- Capital D diner food: Lots of butter, bacon, and carbs
- Great old-school booths and counter to sit on
- Breakfast hits it out of the park in classic diner fashion
- Food comes out quick
- Free coffee refills

Easy beats Pamela's. On the food front there about toe-to-toe, but this place wins on the experience. If you're in town for just a few days, this is definitely one of the places to check out."}
{"text":"its hard to screw up breakfast they did it.... when ya tote a sign that says Pittsburgh's best breakfast back it up... thats why it got 1 star.

i dont understand the hype the lines the waiting when there are a ton of other places in town that blow this place out of the water.... ritters, pamelas etc etc. the bacon was soggy  euuugh. the coffee was luke warm potatoes/homefries bland.service poor at best.

dont waste your time or money on this place."}
{"text":"I stopped by DeLuca's yesterday with CM for brunch at around 11am.  Initially, I tried to call and make a reservation, but they told me that they only accept reservations for parties of at least 5.  However, they also told me that business was a bit slower than usual yesterday.  I believe CM and I waited about 20-30 min. to be seated.  Neither of us had been before, despite having lived in PGH for 3.5 and 1.5 years, respectively.

For my entree, I debated between the fancy french toast and a heavenly pancake sundae, but I ultimately decided on the latter, due to the recommendations of other Yelpers and its Man vs. Food fame.  Despite not being someone who's super into apple pie, I decided to get the apple cinnamon roll pancakes, again due to others' recommendations.  When it came out, it looked impressive, and when I dug in, I was quite pleased with it.  The warmth of the canned apples complimented the cool creaminess of the ice cream perfectly, with the zest of the cinnamon taking it to another level.  Despite being an apple pie naysayer, this dish was delicious!  Obviously, it was very sweet, so if you're not into sweet breakfast foods, you may want to order something else.  CM was less adventurous than me and went with the short stack of pancakes with bacon.  I tried a bite of the bacon, and it was very crispy and minimally greasy, and was bursting with the smoked savoriness of well-made bacon.  This was certainly basic diner breakfast fare, perfected.

What impresses me about DeLuca's is the breadth and interesting options of the menu.  Although they have all of the usual breakfast standbys, they also have a variety of creative options for the more adventurously-minded, such as the heavenly pancake sundaes and the fancy french toast.  They also have some interesting options on the savory side, too, such as the bionic omelette.  Speaking of which, I love the sci fi-themed names that they give the items (out-of-this-world omelettes, sonic sides, etc.).  My only caveat is that if you're trying to eat on the healthier side, there aren't many options in that vein here.  (I'd recommend the Square Cafe in Regent Square for a more health-conscious breakfast.)

Despite the slight annoyances of the wait and the cash only policy, I'd recommend DeLuca's over Pamela's for a quintessential Pittsburgh breakfast--though I do enjoy Pamela's crepes.  Needless to say, it's a strong contender for one of the best traditional breakfasts in PGH.  Do your visiting friends a favor and be sure to take them here for a hearty meal before browsing the Strip or visiting Heinz History Center!"}
{"text":"Great omelets. Huge serving sizes. A real classic. But bring cash! No cards accepted."}
{"text":"Passed through Pittsburg today, I really wanted to go to the original in the strip district, however, traveling with a 4 year old and new born, and with the parking issues in the strip district we opted for their other location near the mall in park manor.  My son and, I split the banana praline pancakes topped with ice cream and whip cream.  First of all the pancakes by themselves tasted like a doughnut or a cake.  Than you add the pralines and bananas along with some kind of rum, and you get a masterpiece.  The pancakes reminded a little bit of a banana foster.  We ordered a side of eggs and bacon and both were a cut above the rest, not your typical bacon and eggs.

My wife and mother and law ordered the seafood paradise crepe, and the seafood omelette.  Both came with a cheesy hollandaise that was absolutely delicious.  Both came with langostino's, shrimp, and lump crab meat.  Everyone absolutely loved their meal.  Would absolutely come back here if, I lived here and, I cannot say that about too many breakfast places."}
{"text":"We stopped here before heading to Pittsburgh International Airport. I had a veggie wrap with chipotle pesto. It was really good.

Also, I approached the waitress with a special request and even though she mentioned that they usually do not do special things she was able to surprise us all with something special for my fiance's birthday.

All the staff we saw here was very friendly and helpful. The prices were relatively fair and food was delicious. I will make sure to stop at some of their other locations when I go back to Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Breakfast is great. If you arrived on weekday before 8:00 am there are not much people, and no wait time. I know a lot of people went on weekend, and the waiting time is worth it. Service is excellent with great portion and greta price. I will come back to try other menu."}
{"text":"We went during brunch hours on a Saturday so there was a bit of a line but the street was vibrant and we got to people watch. Once we got in, the service was prompt and friendly, and sooooooo good!  This was my first trip to Pittsburgh and this restaurant is a must!! I had the Nutella French Toast w/ bacon and eggs. Delish!! The others in my party loved their food too! I even had the lid of the ketchup bottle fly off and get everywhere (whoops!) and the nice dude brought me a wet towel to wipe off with (THANK YOU!). This place is awesome and I really want everyone to know!! SUPER IMPORTANT: CASH ONLY!! (ATM is right outside if you need one )"}
{"text":"Long wait to get in, but WELL worth it!  The food is fantastic, with large portions, so bring your appetite.  I came with a party of 8, and everyone thoroughly enjoyed their meal. Our server, Rhonda, was excellent and quick to get us everything, despite being slammed with tables. Truly an excellent experience!"}
{"text":"Went to Pittsburgh on a whim (from Cleveland). I've been there several times before and I actually enjoyed it more this time around. Looked up on my phone for the best eats on the strip and Deluca's came up as a must. Most, if not all reviews on Yelp are positive. There was a line out the door at about 1PM on a Saturday, but we only waited about 30 mins. I ordered the Mixed Grill breakfast (supposedly Bruce Willis' favorite) with steak. I expected it to be greasy, and it was. No problem there. However, the steak was dry, overcooked, and the whole meal was bland. I still finished it, but I was expecting better. Maybe I should've tried something else???

Anyone have a suggestion of the next dish to try the next time I go back?"}
{"text":"This has to be one of my favorite go-to breakfast spots here in the Burgh! If you haven't been here, you're truly missing out! There's another location in Robinson but I haven't gotten a chance to try it yet. If you're here for the first time, just a heads up - the menu can be very overwhelming to look at. It had so many different options - from the pancakes and french toasts to your traditional omelets or steak & eggs. My boyfriend always order their T-bone steak and egg along with their home fries. It comes out perfect every single time. My go-to breakfast is eggs, turkey sausages & home fries. Yes it sounds so little & simple but trust me... it WILL fill you up! :) Overall I love this breakfast joint. But be ready to stand in a long line if you come here on the weekend (extra long if there's a Steelers or Pirates game)!

{"text":"Highly over-rated.  The service wasn't great.  Saw a waitress drop a knife on the floor and she picked it up and wiped it on her apron.  A waiter wiped the milkshake mixer (the part that goes into the stuff you drink) with a dirty rag.  Food was also a disappointment.  The lobster bisque (which was their special) tasted like flour.  And our funky monkey pancakes had grilled onions in them.  Giving them 2 stars, only because the hostess and our waitress was friendly."}
{"text":"Super greasy, dive inspired diner located in the strip district.  The choices are vast, but everything mostly tastes like low quality fat soaked all purpose man feed.  Yea, so there is some culture/history/tradition of greasy spoon diners of Pittsburgh, of which Deluca's may be the best, but in my opinion it is still not worth it.  Visit the spot, buy a t-shirt, take a picture, then go get some food somewhere else.  I went with some sort of sloppy breakfast option, with biscuits that came out rock hard and tasted like stale Bisquik.  The eggs were runny (not in the good way) and the cheese was plastic-esq American that had somehow managed to not melt, but instead quickly congeal into one stringy mass on top of my potatoes.   The coffee (while refilled many a time, my mug never saw the bottom) was watery and quite bitter.  
So you may be thinking why the 2nd star, well the upsides of Delucas are the massive amount of food on the plate (quantity over quality should be the tagline), and the service was efficient and prompt, if not overly friendly.
So this place is famous for something, I am not quite sure what, but it certainly isn't because they have good food.  If you manage to find out what makes Deluca's famous please let me know, until then I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Very good: gravy (possibly the best gravy you can find in Pittsburgh), fried chicken 
Good: burrito (massive in size), Egg Benedict 
Tip:  Cash only. 
The store closes at 3. 
(I came around 2pm with a group of 5, but it was quick to get the seats. )"}
{"text":"Pittsburgh institution in the strip district. Always a line out the door. Really good breakfast, huge portions, service was excellent. The busboys work real hard at this place, it's spotless. We ordered the eggs benedict with ham on toast and swiss cheese with a hollandaise on the side, not a fan of the hollandaise. The winner here is the spicy hot sausage patty excellent. The Man vs Food meat lovers breakfast lived up to its reputation tons of food split between three people!"}
{"text":"It's true what everyone says. The breakfast here is first rate and fun. Our server treated us like old friends and regulars (it was our first visit) and the biscuits and gravy was about as good as it gets."}
{"text":"This place totally sucks. We started off with a 45-minute wait after being told it'd be 25. Then we practically had to beg for everything from silverware to coffee to creamer to water. It became clear why the wait was so long. Nobody in there hustles at all. It takes at least 20 minutes to get anything you ask for - and we're not talking about food yet.

I got a bacon and cheese omelet. I was lucky. I actually got my food. When confronted with all the missing parts and pieces of my dining companions' orders, the waitress looked at each of them as if it was the first time she was hearing their requests.

The bacon in my omelet was not in pieces, but whole strips which wouldn't have been so bad had it been cooked. It came out of the omelet like the birth scene from alien - long, fatty, wiggly strips of greasy, rubbery, grey fat. Disgusting and inedible.

Breakfast took almost two hours in total and everybody was disappointed in their food. There are too many other good places to go. Won't waste our time (or money) again."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a late breakfast--midweek.  There were plenty of seats so the wait was not an issue. Service was prompt and friendly.  Quite frankly the food was average.  I would go to Pamela's before here anytime."}
{"text":"This place really should be a 5, but since its in Pittsburgh its a 4. Not bad, just not the best in the area in my opinion. There are some good home cooked meals, but man Pittsburgh has some GREAT home cooked meals, and DeLucas doesn't quite fall under that. Not that is bad, just that its ok, and not quite a 5. I will come back here depending on my mod and what I want, but I cant say that  its my favorite or my go to. Definitely a good homecooked meal, but its just good. I do say that the atmosphere is very cool though. Very \"Pittsburghish\". Enjoy all ya Yinzers."}
{"text":"Awesome diner with great hours.  Our plan was to come here at 6:00am on Saturday after a night out and eat before we went to bed, but that failed.  So we came later in the afternoon after walking around the Strip District.

As I was already full from our previous meal before coming here, my boyfriend was still hungry and decided to go for the bionic omelet.  He's not a small guy, but this omelet completely put him in a food coma. It was so big and filling, he was only able to finish about a third of it before throwing in the white flag.

Services is what you would expect at a diner.  We got there around 2:00pm and closing time was at 3. So it was pretty quiet in there.

Bathrooms were downstairs.  There were 3 stalls in the ladies room, but tell me why the bathroom door was open???

Prices were great. Would love to be back with an appetite and try out other items on the menu.

Cash only and you pay at the register on your way out."}
{"text":"Deluca's is definitely up there on list of favorite breakfast spots. The portions are huge but still tasty and service is friendly! 

Most recently, my boyfriend and I stopped in while doing some shopping in the Strip. We got there a little after 1, so it seemed like the breakfast/brunch crowd was done - in the mornings, the line can go out the door & down the block quite a bit! The menu is large and they have a selection of savory and sweet options, as well as breakfast & lunch items. For sweet, I like to get a short stack of pancakes with a fun topping (apples & cream = amazing!). Otherwise, omelettes are always a solid choice for a savory option. Never had a bad meal here! 

Other info: cash only, ample seating inside, very pittsburgh-y decor!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit.  Very impressive menu.  I tried the Swedish pancakes with Lingenberry.  I could not eat more than half because the fake whipped cream was icky sweet and the lingenberries weren't so great either.  The crepe was OK, but I couldn't eat it with all that junk on it.  Original Pancake house on Greentree road has an excellent Swedish pancake with lingenberry.  DeLuca's came no where near it. 
I expected to be offered something else, but I was not offered anything.  My friend shared his butter milk pancake which was not bad.  
I don't plan to return."}
{"text":"Love the waffle sundae and anything with the seafood filling. Hands down my fav brunch spot in the burgh!"}
{"text":"This place is gross and needs to be visited by the health department.  I spent the whole meal killing fruit flies that were flying everywhere throughout the restaurant and into my food. This would be fine if the weather wasn't 4 degrees outside,  GROSS"}
{"text":"This place is definitely worth the hype. It was poppin when I came in, hungover and ravenous. I was ready to eat my body weight in carbs and just chill for a bit before my boyfriend and I hit the road back home to Ohio. 

Service was very, very fast. Like, you sneezed and your food was placed before you. Typical diner food, but it packed a flavorful punch. 

Our waitress so funny and kind, and I really wish I remembered her name so I could rave about her. Lol"}
{"text":"Pancakes topped with ice cream, fruit and whipped cream for breakfast?? Hell yes!!! Sounds more like dessert, but every bit delicious on an empty stomach on a Saturday morning. My fiance brought me here one day during the summer when I went with him to PGH to visit his family. We heard about the rave reviews on Man vs. Food so we decided we had to hit up all of Adam Richman's picks in PGH during our trip. We waited in line in the warm sun for about 20-30 minutes to be seated, but it was well worth it! My fiance had the mixed grill - loaded with grilled veggies, potatoes, and spicy sausage. We kept switching plates back and forth because we just couldnt decide who got the best meal. Both the pancakes and the mixed grill were HUGE! We could barely finish both. Inexpensive and good service. We'll defintely be back when we visit PGH again!"}
{"text":"Great local diner. Not much more to say but if you are hungry and looking for a hearty breakfast this is the place. Great prices large servings friendly staff."}
{"text":"Always worth the wait! Be warned though--the line gets out the door easily and can get quite long! Food is amazing and breakfast options are phenomenal. I've never had a bad meal here and could always justify traveling down from Shadyside/Oakland to eat here. Just remember that Strip location is cash only!"}
{"text":"The food is 5 star, the restaurant is super cute, the portions are huge, and the prices are right in the effect spot. The reason why I won't give them 5 stars is for the atmosphere on the day of my visit. For the entirety of my visit the manager was sitting at the counter doing paperwork and loudly arguing with one of the cooks. She berated him over his ex girlfriends calling the store, him requesting a day off in January ect.. This went on for about 40 minutes, they continuously went back and forth loudly yelling at each other. Whether they were kidding or not; my extremely hungover brain couldn't handle the shrill yelling."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had been looking forward to eating at DeLuca's for months, but every time we passed on a Saturday morning, we figured it was not worth the wait. We were right!

Luckily, we both had a Thursday off, and we're able to visit during a slow day. This might have actually been the biggest mistake we could've made. 

DeLuca's obviously does not staff their Allstar waitresses on weekdays, and because of that, we paid the price. Upon walking in, we were promptly seated, but it then took over 5 minutes for our waitress to take our orders. My boyfriend ordered the mixed grill with bacon and sourdough toast, and I ordered the huevos rancheros.  It took an exorbitantly long time for our food to reach our table, and when it did, we were brought the wrong meal (as were two other groups sitting in our area). 

When we finally got our meals, they were... Not good. The salsa on the huevos was so sweet that it tasted like barbecue sauce, and the refried beans on the side were like glue in my mouth. My boyfriend said the mixed grill was okay, but our waitress brought him white toast instead of sourdough, even though he asked her TWICE for sourdough (when we got the check, we saw that she wrote \"white toast\" on it).

If the food were decent, it might have made up for the poor service, but alas, that wasn't the case. Only a masochist would wait in line for DeLuca's. Go to Pamela's instead."}
{"text":"As I get older I become much pickier than ever before... I don't like the way anyone does anything.... I won't even eat if it's displayed wrong....

So I'm not a fan... iv have experienced better... 

Would you believe a gray bearded short fat guy with a big smile on his face? 

came in the back door & notice a good portion of staff at the deluca's diner ...There's a bunch of diners who make you wonder what so good about this particular diner... the service was great...but the food was just mediocre ...i ordered an omelet...to be more specific a Philly cheese steak omelet and it was probably the worst omelet i ever had... the omelet was served with a side of homemade hash and and fresh Italian bread... the hash was dry an tasteless... the only thing i liked was the bread...which they purchases form another restaurant...so after that disappointing meal i decide to purchase a crepe....meh... i shouldn't have done that...."}
{"text":"My family ended up in this area and since I had seen a rave review for Deluca's on Man vs Food, we decided to hit it up. Let me preface this by stating that I'm a breakfast man. It is my favorite meal of the day so I get excited when I find a place that does it right.... unfortunately, I wasn't that impressed. 

But, to be fair, I wasn't terribly disappointed either. I ordered chocolate chip and strawberry pancakes with whipped cream on them, scrambled eggs, and sweet sausage. My wife got that massive veggie and egg plate that they showed on MvF (I can't recall what it was). Both were acceptable, but underwhelming. My wife makes better pancakes and eggs, and the plate she ordered tasted under-seasoned. 

It wasn't terribly expensive so I didn't feel that it was a total waste, but surely didn't think it was worthy of its claim of \"Best Breakfast in Pittsburg\". I also felt that the inconvenience of cash-only would make it not worth a return visit.

Also, the dining room is definitely not built for comfort. The tables were packed in so tight that we literally had to climb through another booth to get to our table and the benches were incredibly uncomfortable."}
{"text":"Two words: The Food!! This place is busy, often with a line out the door, so try to arrive before you're starving. The decor is cute-old-diner chic and the service is matter-of-fact.

I've been here several times, so I've only tried a few things, but the food has always been excellent! For example, the undeniable flavor of the seafood in my seafood eggs Benedict mixed flawlessly with the hollandaise, avocado, perfectly poached egg and Mancini's bread...I even failed when I tried not to eat all of the delicious potatoes (so good!!) - the Best seafood breakfast I've ever had!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! Super crowded but that's understandable because of how great the food is. I got the pumpkin pancakes and they were incredible. This is a must eat at in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"Classic greasy dinner food. Try Cafe on the Strip for better Italian french toast and shorter line."}
{"text":"BREAKFAST OF CHAMPYINZ is my favorite thing to order. Come hungry. The wait was roughly 25min for 3 people on a Saturday morning. The wait staff is very quick considering they try to turn over as many tables as possible but they get the job done. The eggs are pretty good but it's not like you're coming here for a gourmet breakfast. This is your quintessential diner experience but it's worthwhile."}
{"text":"This was a disappointment. We were driving by and saw that this place was pretty crowded. We go in and sit down and order our food, which took 45 minutes to come out. Strike one. Once the food finally came out, the sandwich I ordered was plain and tasteless and the fries tasted burnt. Strike two. My mother ordered French toast and it had foreign food all in it. Bacon, bits of eggs and home fries, and other unknowns bits of food. And the side order of home fries she ordered tasted burnt as well. Strike three. Then we go in the bathroom and there is no soap and it had an awful smell. It looked like it hasn't been cleaned in months. Do not even waste your money here."}
{"text":"Hubby loved Deluca's. Excellent customer service. Great food at reasonable prices.

We originally wanted to visit the historical Deluca's in The Strip district, but once we learned that there was one right around the corner from our hotel, we opted to avoid the crowds and parking situation. This Deluca's is very convenient for those staying in the same area. It's located in a suburbanite strip mall. 

The food portions were good. The prices were reasonable and breakfast tasted great. Our waitress was very attentive and helpful. I, too, thoroughly enjoyed this local gem and will certainly be returning again."}
{"text":"I visited here from out-of-state to check it out.  My first observation was that it was quite proud of itself for being \"the best breakfast in Pittsburgh\".  I got here right at 8 am on a Saturday, and so the lines weren't out the door and down the street by that time.  However, once I got seated - 8:10 am or so - the line by then had already gotten rather long.  Make sure you come here early.

Multiple food shows, most notably Man v. Food, have come here to check out their breakfast.  Their menu, for starters, is extremely long.  They have everything ranging from a 2-pound breakfast burrito to pancakes covered with whipped cream and strawberries to large omelettes.  However, I got the Mixed Grill, as it was what the server recommended.

The Mixed Grill was not good at all.  The eggs were good, but I didn't think the veggies tasted that fresh.  After a while, the taste of each bite got pretty predictable.  Unlike what Adam famously said on Man v. Food, the Mixed Grill was not at all healthy despite having tons of veggies.  This place is a greasy spoon, health nuts beware.

The service was always busy, and it seemed as if they didn't have enough staff available to tend to all our needs.  The layout is also fairly small, but the location prohibits it from expanding much.

While I also could have probably picked the wrong thing to order, Deluca's is not for the claustrophobic or the impatient."}
{"text":"Great food, great prices generous portions. A super breakfast just 10-15 minutes to the airport."}
{"text":"Came here while traveling for business with co-workers for breakfast.  It definitely has the diner feel and is located in a strip mall.  I wasn't sure what to expect given some of the reviews but I was pleasantly surprised so I'm happy I made my own opinion.

Service was good and prices were even better.  I got the seafood Benedict and loved it.  The hollandaise sauce was delicious. Portion sizes were huge!  Menu has pretty much anything you may want for breakfast so can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"The business blew me away, wow !  The food was decent, could be better.   Maybe it was just too busy of a morning, the line was out the door, fun place to have visited.  The pancakes were awesome, but couldn't eat more than one."}
{"text":"Stopped here on my way to a meeting this morning. Awesome place, great food quick service. I had to get a little bit of work done prior to my meeting and had a great environment to do this here.

I would recommend this place to anyone passing by who is looking for a quick bite.

I will be back!"}
{"text":"Best meal I had in Pittsburg was breakfast at this place. Located in the heart of the Strip District, we went at peak time and probably waited for about a half hour. I'm glad we did. Trying to be healthy, I ordered the Greek omelette and asked to make it with egg whites. For $11.99 (+$1 for egg whites), this delicious creation comes with spinach, tomato, feta and asiago cheese, and choice of steak or chicken; I went with the chicken. Wow, this thing was good! One of the best omelets I've had in a long time, and I don't usually do the egg white thing. The home fries, cooked to crispy perfection, were also excellent.  Service was top notch  and the old school diner ambiance is a fun experience. 5 stars for an excellent breakfast."}
{"text":"Worth the twenty minute wait for breakfast.  Huge menu, and many alternatives for breakfast meat and bread choices.  Good Greek omelet served with hash browns and sourdough bread.  Our friend's seafood omelet looked amazing.  Definitely a popular, affordable place."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the better diners in the area. I'm a big fan of breakfast food any time of day, so I've never had their lunches, but their breakfast is great!"}
{"text":"Very good breakfast food. If you like breakfast, Deluca's does a great job. I've never had lunch there, but I'm sure they do that well, too."}
{"text":"Looking to avoid the long lines at Deluca's, I did breakfast before class at 8:30 AM with some friends.  I had been wanting to try here for ages, and as someone who is unimpressed with Pamela's, I wasn't sure if Deluca's would be a big disappointment too.  I am happy to report that I really enjoyed this place, and it is significantly better than Pamela's.

Let me start with the decor.  It is so tacky and wonderful.  It is totally bizarre and gives this place a unique vibe, considering it is just a diner.  It fascinated the group throughout breakfast.

I ordered the Western Omelette ($10.29).  It came with toast and hash browns, but I don't eat potatoes so I just opted for toast.  The omelette was good and loaded up nicely.  They also threw in both red and green peppers which was a nice treat.  There are lots of toast options to choose from, and I enjoyed the sour dough.  The biscuits and gravy one of my friends ordered were yummy as well.  The price was a touch high, but the food was good.  After seeing the pancakes go by, though, I would have to try them next time.

Overall, it's not worth waiting in line for more than a few minutes, but this place is good."}
{"text":"one word...DELICIOUS!!! A must try when in town. I had the fancy pancakes with eggs, potatoes, and bacon. Really good food. Go early because it gets busy really fast."}
{"text":"I have been the the Strip District location several times in the past and always left satisfied, so I figured I would feel the same going to the Robinson location. 

We walked in and asked if we would be able to sit at the empty counter. Our server came over within a minute and we ordered coffee. The menu is quite extensive, so we asked for a few minutes to figure out what to order for our breakfasts. My husband got waffles, eggs and bacon. I opted for the banana prailenes & cream crepes with a side of scrambled eggs. It wasn't busy, so everything came out rather quickly. 

My food was really tasty and worth the $9 for the crepe. I was only able to finish half of it. My husband's meal was big in comparison to other places, but he wasn't full and said it definitely wasn't his favorite breakfast. 

The server was nice, but she wasn't very attentive once we got our food. Her and another server sat at the end of the counter and shot the breeze most of the time. I understand it was slow for them due to the cold weather, but I feel they should have been cleaning something or found something productive to do. That's IMO though.... 

Food was good overall, but it is really pricey, especially for breakfast. Give it a try if you want, but know there are other cheaper places if you're on a budget."}
{"text":"Owner is rude treats his staff horribly and only cares about making money. Food was adequate. I could've had same quality at a chain breakfast diner."}
{"text":"Yummy dirty breakfast!  That is a compliment for me... sometimes we just want a breakfast that does not cry out to be healthy and DeLuca's offered me just that on my day off this past Monday.  

Any time I have been in the Strip, I have wanted to go but the lines were too crazy and out of control.  So being down in the Strip when it was not nearly as busy finally allowed me the opportunity to finally have the Mixed Grill that I had been yearning for.  
This amazing home fries covered in grilled mixed veggies and then eggs with toast was scrumptious!  My coffee was always full, and my stomach left full so I was very much a happy camper.  

If you hate lines and waiting, come here during the week... it is a definite must have!"}
{"text":"One of those cool little hole in the wall places.  Place probably hasn't been updated in 40 years, but kinda the place that I like to look for food gems.  This place was featured on a episode of Man vs Food, and has been heavily reviewed up to this point, so no real big surprises here.  Overall the food was good.  We had their breakfast burrito, apple pancakes, and Denver omelette, all of which I tried and all good choices.  We got there early and although not very busy, the service was slow and a bit lackluster and probably the one thing that keeps me from giving 5 stars instead of 4."}
{"text":"There's always a line that's how you know it's good. It's definitely worth the wait! I had the country fried chicken and chicken and waffles and both were phenomenal! Every time friends come to visit from out of town we always take them here for a great breakfast"}
{"text":"To best explain this joint, it is one of the best places to grub out in Pittsburgh.  How can you not expect to eat to your heart's content when someone tells you that their pancakes come with ice cream and whipped cream, and look more like something out of Willy Wonka's factory then a griddle.  Everything on the menu reads simply: pancakes, burritos, waffles, shakes, etc.  Not too much flash, but the ensemble of food layered on top of food that is finally delivered to your table will knock out whatever hunger you brought in.

Depending on when you come, you are going to have to wait, but it is definitely worth it.  Try not to fumble around with menu once you get seated, best is the look at it in line, decide, and prepare.  Prepare mentally and physically for this meal.  Everything on the menu is good.  Trust me you will not leave without feeling like that was the best breakfast ever.  And please do try to tackle something interesting on the menu."}
{"text":"just look for the big chicken on top ...this is a real honest to goodness diner located in the strip district 
*cash only* 
there is a counter and booths
the Tv is on with the local news in the mornings
SO they do open really early as any legit diner should 
so depending if its a weekday you can head on in grab a table with vintage boomerang formica or sit at the counter
everyone there is very friendly and welcoming 
if you decide to go on a weekend be prepared for the line out the door but as their sign says the line will move so if you can only do a weekend its worth the wait
for me I like to go on a week day early
they have your usual breakfasts eggs bacon toast 
they also have Benedicts I have had their avocado veggie version and its so good!
then there are their pancakes
season featured my favorite pumpkin which comes in a few varieties even one with ice cream
its all so good
and their fish sammie a big piece of perfecty fried cod...that thing is huge on a nice fresh roll even their tartar sauce is good nice n creamy 
lots other sammie choices and burgers
they have shakes and sodas
their ice tea is surprisingly good I always have it 
a meal is about 10 bucks plus a drink or shake 
this is a great place 
ok so parking can be a hassle on a weekend just take a deep breath and remain calm a metered spot will open up or take the bus"}
{"text":"Call me crazy, but Deluca's doesn't really do it for me.  Based on the continuous long lines in front of the restaurant, I am clearly in the minority.  Don't get me wrong, the breakfast is tasty, the menu is extensive and the prices are reasonable but it just doesn't knock it out of the ballpark for me.

I always opt for the two eggs, meat, potatoes and toast breakfast, and I'm always ecstatic when a restaurant has a turkey sausage or turkey bacon option which they do.    Where I think they fall short is their breakfast potatoes.   They aren't crispy or flavorful enough.  Since this two egg meal choice is my breakfast staple, I can't help but compare it to the Kelly O's and Pamela's equivalent and it just doesn't compare. 

My husband likes that they have more options on the menu here (country fried chicken and biscuits, biscuits and gravy, etc.). They also have a ton of breakfasts that seem more like desserts (think waffle sundae).   It's certainly a local Strip destination that should be investigated, it's just not my spot of choice.  Also, if you are looking for a trendy or upscale place, you should walk on by because this is a classic, greasy spoon diner."}
{"text":"Breakfast on a Monday morning after a Steelers Sunday late afternoon home game. Maybe a 10 minute wait. I liked it better than Kelly O's , thought the food was again good not great. Traditional breakfast, eggs, bacon and potatoes, pricing was fair. Would go again"}
{"text":"I found this place accidentally one morning while strolling through the Strip District hungrier than anything. Wow, what a lucky day for me! It is the perfect breakfast joint--quirky, crowded, noisy, and the food is fantastic. It's like the breakfast equivalent of Primanti Brothers. A great little local joint with great food that's probably too popular for its own good but hasn't been ruined by success."}
{"text":"Came in just for a place to sit while feeding the baby her bottle and to have a milkshake.   Next time I'm in Pittsburgh I will definitely come back as I saw mountains of good-looking breakfast-type food and sandwiches coming off the griddle behind the counter.   And it must be good because I saw about 200 fresh eggs ready to go."}
{"text":"I'm so in between 4 & 5 stars. Maybe I'll decide by the end of this review. 

We stopped in after I've been patiently waiting to have breakfast here. There was a party in front of us, but we were fine sitting at the counter. 

We took a little while to look over the menu. It had so many options. Multiple choices for omelets, french toast, pancakes (AND crepes), breakfast sandwiches ect.  I even noticed a dessert-type of pancakes which had chocolate sauce for example and whip cream-- again multiple choices in that section as well. We took a little while to decide. Note: This is just the breakfast menu that I'm referring too ^^

I ordered the steel city breakfast of champions. It came with 2 eggs, 2 pieces of bacon, sausage patty, home fries, toast plus my choice of pancakes, waffle or french toast. I chose the french toast. My breakfast definitely satisfied me and filled me up! The french toast was extremely fluffy and had powdered sugar on it :D Loved the home fries by the way! It was fun to witness the cooks make them from the counter (if you're counting calories, don't watch them make the home fries, fyi!)

Bobby started ordering an omelet with whatever he wanted in it.. The kind server suggested the Bionic Omelet which has 5 eggs, sausage, bacon, ham, pepperoni, onions, cheddar & provolone. This omelet was huge (take a look at the picture I added) I'm not exaggerating. I should have shown my little hand compared to it. I wouldn't have guessed 5 eggs, it looked like maybe 8. He was only able to finish half the omelet. His words \"I need to finish this to feel like a man\" haha. 

We had a great time & I'm excited to head back. Next time we may try the Robinson location since he works up that way. I believe they have longer hours as well. 

okay, 5 stars :) I don't even care that I have to stop at the ATM before heading here (cash only)"}
{"text":"I enjoyed a late breakfast solo dolo today. Even though there are still 100+ things I could've tried, I decided on my usual.. the Steel City Breakfast of Champs. It comes with 2 eggs any style, bacon AND sausage, home fries, toast + two pancakes (can't believe you get so much food for about $10) 

I'm personally happy about the new restaurant in Robinson. Besides downtown where I work and Oakland where I live, Robinson is where I spend alot of my time. Mostly bc Bobby works out there and I head out that way to get away from my usual work and home routine.. 

But anyways, this location accepts cards unlike the strip district location. breakfast is all day.

If you've never been to Delucas, the menu is so large! So many options from breakfast platters to omelets, French toast, pancakes, crepes and sundae style pancakes.. SO. MANY. OPTIONS for each category... And this is just breakfast.

My breakfast was delish. The only thing is I could've sworn at the strip district I had the choice of pancakes or French toast. I definitely ordered French toast last time and remember there being a decision lol. For the combos like mine, you can upgrade to fancy pancakes or fancy French toast for $1-$2 extra. If I must add, the home fries today were extremely well done. Alot of the home fries were burnt, extra hard pieces of potato that could've seriously chipped a tooth if you want a proper description. That's not going to stop me from coming though bc everything else was great :)"}
{"text":"Tasks place is awesome. Though to be honest I don't think it's the best in Pittsburgh as it prides itself on; Pamela's diner, which is right around the corner to De Luca's, holds that title in my opinion. Still, I highly recommend this to anyone looking for an awesome breakfast place, right after Pamela's that is."}
{"text":"I am in love with this place. 

If you just want to get to the review about the food, skip this paragraph. If you enjoy the long, drawn out nostalgic reviews, read on:

Let me preface this by saying I have very mixed feelings on living in Pittsburgh. I find it hot or cold, and that goes for everything. The people, the night life, the restaurants, it's all a love/hate relationship for me. I rarely encounter anything where I'm just like, \"eh.\" There are things that make me love it here, there are things that make me hate it. I find people as nice as I found them back home in WV or absolutely the rudest EVER. The weather...ugh...don't get me started. So why am I telling you this? Because when I debate packing my things, selling my house, and moving away, I have a list of things I love (which are usually very simple things because that's the kind of person I am) that keep me here. They are things I know I'll never find anywhere else and things that make me love it here; the things I imagine give Pittsburgh it's awesome city rep, and this place is at the very top of that list. 

This wasn't my first visit. The boyfriend and I walked in around 8am. We had just been to Home Depot and had a long day of yard work ahead. The last thing I wanted was to cook breakfast. We hopped onto 2 seats at the bar, as usual, and I ordered my usual, the Banana Split Crepe with a side of well done sweet sausage, and a coffee, and a water with lemon. It was astounding, and it always is. I take 2 bites of the sausage and take it home, every time. It's sweet and as lean as sausage could be and cooked to perfection. The coffee is perfectly brewed. The crepe is golden and delicious. The fruit is perfectly warm, the cheese too, and the toppings abundant. It's my favorite breakfast. I want to go on about the atmosphere though, because if the food were stellar and everything else sucked, I probably wouldn't return. The flip side is, the food could be mediocre (it isn't) and the rest would probably still bring me back. 

We were greeted by a friendly tattooed waitress. We are tattooey too, and are always happy to patronize places that allow employees to look the way they choose (side note, that's why we Home Depot over Lowes, but that's another review).  Most of the staff here is sporting some ink, and black and white work side by side laughing and looking like they enjoy their job. I know Pittsburgh is known for it's diversity, so it may surprise you I mention that, but sometimes I find it to be quite the opposite. Not here. Not ever. Everyone smiles, everyone is friends, everyone is nice.

I was sitting next to a Jewish man, a table of young Asian students behind me, business men to my right, and old ladies dressed to the 9's across the way. Next to my boyfriend sat the waitress' well behaved young daughter, eating cut up banana and a milkshake. Cartoons were on, and I was cool with that. This is a place for everyone. I dig that the most. 

As I'm drinking my coffee, waiting on my crepe, the restaurant is noisy. The radio is on. Prince comes on, and employee wiping down tables walks over and cranks it up. He's wiping and dancing, a few waitresses are dancing, too. We are laughing and dancing in our seats. The cooks on the line are nodding their heads. 

Breakfast is delicious, the place has a pulse, and life is good. There isn't a face in the place without a smile on it. The boyfriend looks over and says \"this is the best f*cking omlette I have ever had.\" Our waitress laughs and tops off the coffee. 

This is the Pittsburgh I was told about, and this is the Pittsburgh I love."}
{"text":"After a bit of Christmas shopping we decided to stop here for a late lunch. A very nice hostess seated us in a comfortable booth. Having never visited DeLuca's for lunch, we ask the friendly waitress for some sandwich recommendations. We chose the first one she recommended--the Philly Steak & Cheese on a delicious Mancini's roll, with coleslaw and Cajun fries. We were NOT disappointed! The steak was delicious and perfectly cooked as we requested! Very tasty and filling!!! The coleslaw was fresh, cool, crisp--and delicious. The Cajun fries added extra zing to an already yummy meal. No complaints whatsoever! We were more than satisfied--and FULL!!! Considering it was near closing time, we weren't made to feel rushed at all. We are definitely looking forward to a return trip to this cool, friendly and clean diner in the near future!"}
{"text":"Our first visit won't be our last! Great seat at the bar to watch the action. The bacon was to die for and being from Iowa, we know bacon. Thick cut and fried to perfection! I highly recommend the French toast!Made with inch think cut of Mancini bread, the local favorite. Crisp outside. Chewy inside. Amazing! 
A tip: tried to come over a Steelers game weekend and the line was out the door. Came back on Monday morning, still a line but much shorter. CASH ONLY. 

So many choices we could eat here again and again. Until next time Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"It was completely worth the hour weight to get the Super Bowl omelet.  The waitress we had was amazing and was very attentive to the things we needed and made sure we were comfortable.  It is a must go if you are in Pittsburgh. I mean I would have never thought to put mashed potatoes on an omelet with kielbasa.  I will be back the next time I am in the area."}
{"text":"I came to this location in the hopes that it would be as good as the strip district location, but it wasn't. As a kid I can remember going to the strip and having breakfast at DeLucas, and getting the most amazing chocolate chip pancakes with a tower of whipped cream and it being the best thing ever! The chocolate chip cakes I had to say were pretty good, but not the same. Service was ok, nothing great. Our food came out super fast and the portions were HUGE. My son and I could have easily split the hot cake special I ordered. The food itself was fairly plain. I want a fan of the eggs or the sausage. The pancakes were good though. Everything was fairly priced in my opinion. Coffe, my breakfast and my sons breakfast with 2 substitutions was less then $20. The staff didn't seem like they really enjoyed their job very much. I understand diner mentality, and you wanna turn and burn tables quickly, but there were less then 10 tables and only 2 at the counter. A smile wouldn't hurt anyone. The one thing I was a little taken aback by was that when I was checking out, I used my checking card and when I was asked to enter a pin, I didn't want to, so I asked the girl checking me out which button to press so that I could sign for my purchase and she not only did she not know she was a little rude about whatever comes up is what you have to do. I will most likely not return for breakfast or any other meal at this location"}
{"text":"So overrated and pretty lousy food. Greasy spoon at its best. Better choices very close."}
{"text":"De Luca's was featured on Man V Food - Pittsburgh. I had been going to this place since my junior year at CMU and I find it to be the best breakfast place I have ever eaten at. Whenever I go back to Pittsburgh to visit friends or for Steelers games, I always try and hit up Pramanti Brothers, William Penn for the the Kitchen Sink Wings and De Luca's for their breakfast.

Well. There is always a line to this place. I've seen it go around the block sometimes but there are also times when you can be the first in line. It all depends on what the crowd is like. This place specializes in breakfast but you can also get lunch food as well. You have to pay cash and you will most likely not find street parking anywhere near there so look for a lot or try the streets around it. The place is ALWAYS crowded so if you see some seats open at the bar, grab them cuz those are first come first serve.

Onto breakfast, I've tried a lot of their options but I love their Steak Mixed Grill. This gets me a sliced medium rare steak, 2 eggs over easy, veggies, sweet roast peppers, tomatoes and home fries. This meal was one of the dishes that Adam Richmond ate when he went there for Man V Food. I'll usually get this with a strawberry milkshake (which is enormeous) and that will completely fill me up.

I've also had the eggs benedict which is really good, the famous breakfast burrito (best breakfast burrito I've ever eaten), the buttermilk pancakes (better than Pamela's short cakes) and a Greek Omelette.

However, I now that I only go back to Pittsburgh once or twice a year, I usually just get the steak mixed grill. De Luca's is so much better than Pamela's and Pamela's is a really good breakfast place too. I definitely love coming here."}
{"text":"Yum!  Tried the seafood crepe, had banana and peanut butter pancakes, and tried the chocolate and strawberry crepe.  The service was quick and friendly.  If you are in the strip district any time before they close at 2:30, you've got to try it."}
{"text":"This is a busy diner-like restaurant with great food. Expect to wait 20-30 minutes if you go for brunch on a Saturday or Sunday (line queues up out front and you just wait your turn).

If you dig the hustle and bustle of a tight diner atmosphere, then this is your place. Pass on by if you're looking for a quiet place to sip your cup of coffee.  They make great breakfast food and they make it fast; we waited less than 10 minutes for our order despite it being packed.

There's a huge menu like you'd expect at a diner but the food is above what I would call \"diner quality.\" I had the Granny's Apple Cinnamon Bun and my wife had the short stack with scrambled eggs. Both were very good; the cinnamon bun pancakes were especially flavorful. The service was attentive but no-nonsense like you'd expect in a super busy place.

Overall very satisfied.  Only thing is busy, cramped places like this stress me out when I'm just trying to enjoy my meal, but that's just a testament to how good the food is."}
{"text":"Another Pittsburgh classic diner experience. DeLuca's is absolutely fantastic all around. Food is great and the menu options are a wide range of classic breakfast and lunch. Service is friendly and the atmosphere rocks. Prefer sitting at the counter"}
{"text":"Worth going to once since it's a Pittsburgh institution.  It's an experience.  I had breakfast there this morning.

I was asked 4 times if I was ready to order while my while my face was planted in the menu, patently pondering the choices.  I had a difficult time getting water. I made eye contact with one employee who then just kept walking; I took it that he will only bus tables.  My coffee was burnt, though after a while a nice lady came around and when I explained this she said that \"yeah, the decaf is blacker\".  No, burnter.  But she did bring me a fresh cup of regular.

The food was pretty good, though not exactly what I ordered.  The turkey sausage was somehow watery; I marvel how they accomplished that.

Most of the staff was friendly and my dining guest thoroughly enjoyed his meal, so again I'd say it's worth at least one trip.  Maybe you'll enjoy it more."}
{"text":"This place was incredible and I now understand why it was featured on Man vs Food. I had a MOAB (mother of all burritos) and my friend got the bionic omelet (should be called \"freak of nature\"). We waited about 30 minutes outside before getting in and now understand why. It takes extra time to make your way out of the restaurant due to all the food you eat here, thus slowing down the line. We had a great time and will be headed back soon. I will try Pamela's (a rival breakfast shop) sometime and then compare them. This place is highly recommended.

Cash only."}
{"text":"I hate to give this review but I think I have to... We went there on the day Steelers are playing the Broncos. We were there around 9 and there was a long line.. My friends and I always thought the long lines mean good things.. Boy we were wrong.. Half of us ordered the steak and eggs and it was the most disgusting steak I had, Bland... Not cooked to what I asked... My eggs had all sorts of black residue.. The bread came after 10 minutes of giving us our meal... Customer service was okay...."}
{"text":"This place is Pittsburgh!  The breakfast here is legendary.  I came in on Monday for my second visit.  Had the breakfast burrito with turkey sausage and coffee.  The burrito was fantastic.  Filled with all kinds of goodness and topped with their wonderful salsaish sauce.  The place is very quaint and mom and pop dinerish.  I've seen the lines on weekends and they are crazy.  The waitress was very nice and had awesome ink.  Love this place!"}
{"text":"Deluca's is as good as it gets when it comes to diners.  The menu is classic diner-style, but what you get is far above average.  

Tuesday morning is a great time to head over.  There was a short wait but we were in and out in an hour.  The service is super fast and it seems like the food comes out even faster.  So delicious!

I got the seafood lover's omelette.  It's a really light option with lobster, shrimp, crab, red peppers and cheese.  I really liked the number of eggs that were used and they were truly cooked perfectly.  These cooks know what they're doing.

My boyfriend got a bacon egg and cheese sandwich.  It's served on Mancini's bread...also notably delicious!

With Deluca's there's everything to love."}
{"text":"CRAZINESS... so many options on their menu from eggs/omelette to pancake/crepe/french toast/waffle both sweet and savory to sandwiches. I was worried the table of 7 would take a long time, but a table had opened up in 10 minutes. It was fantastic! Great place to take friends with all sorts of food preferences.
I ordered the 2 eggs with homefries and bacon. BACON was so good. Thick enough and crispy. Wasn't a huge fan of the homefries, I would like them crunchier. The fried chicken was really good though. Super tender and savory.
We also shared the pumpkin filled crepes and sundae waffle with strawberries. OH MY... it was soooo loaded. I really like both desserts and we even finished the pumpkin crepe. Not overly sweet!"}
{"text":"While on a red bus tour, we heard about this breakfast place. We went in with high hopes.  There were three of us, and the line had about 15 people in front of us.  It didn't take long for us to get a table, maybe 15 minutes.  Our waitress came over shortly afterwards and took our order.  It then took about 15-20 minutes for her to bring our drinks.  The food was just mediocre.  I had a waffle that was undercooked.  Someone else had the oatmeal that was not very hot. The last person got eggs, bacon and hotcakes which was maybe the best choice.  The food came out pretty quick, considering how long it took for drinks.

It was just so-so, possibly even less than so-so.  I'd recommend Pamelas's over Delucas."}
{"text":"deluca's is the best restaurant in pittsburgh other than Quaker steak."}
{"text":"I totally have a mini-crush on Adam Richman (you know, the Man v Food host). Nothing gets a girl smitten more than eating your way through the US. Oh c'mon. Don't act surprised. You'll have been with me through many a buffet or sugar-induced coma. So anyway, when Adam chowed down at Deluca's - I knew I had to prove my worthiness... 

And conquer I did...
Survive the line at the door? No sweat. 20 min is nothing to me. I live in Asia now, people. It's the land of queues. Hell, people wait in line simply because there is one, even if they have no idea what it's for. 

Order the massive breakfast burrito? Of course. 
Was it bigger than my face? Check. 
Was it delicious? Double check. 
(Although, if I had one criticism, it would be put less potatoes inside and more egg. And that slice o' American cheese on top added nothing...)

Ice cream for breakfast? Yessssss! 
Cinnamon bun hotcakes offered a delicious sugar rush, with fluffy pancakes topped with ice cream, whipped cream and delicious gooey apples and pecans. I only wish there were more apples. And pecans... And pancakes. 2 was not enough. 

Okay, the breakfast was tasty but not as amazing as Adam made it seem. But maybe Adam makes everything look tastier...  (oh, you know you love him too!!!)"}
{"text":"Dirty diner that has one of the best breakfasts in Pittsburgh. I love to eat here, but I do not like how the toast is always given to me 5 minutes after my eggs. Other than that this place is 5 stars!"}
{"text":"What a wonder Pittsburgh breakfast experience! Super busy just adding to the charm. No glitz or glam, just great food! Went moth my stepmom, sister and best friend from out of town. Had to give her a Pittsburgh experience of the strip district. My sister got eggs Benedict, she loved it on the Mancini's toast. My friend got the man vs food special (can't recall the name) but everything was mixed together in a heavenly mix. Stepmom got a classic breakfast, raved about the bacon. I had the moad, pronounced moe ad. It was a breakfast burrito with Spanish style sauce and chorizo. We then shared a banana split crepe. Yes, we went all out! Everything was amazing!"}
{"text":"Came here and there was a line out the door. No biggie, we figured we'd have to wait. We weren't sure how it worked though - if you had to go in and or your name down or whatever - but the people in line ahead of us said you just wait in line until you get to the counter to be seated.

It turns out that there were only groups of 4 ahead of us (I was a party of 2) so the people said we could probably go in and grab the 2 empty seats at the counter..score! So we went In and asked a waitress if we could just sit at the counter and she said we had to wait our turn in line. We explained that there was no one waiting to sit at he counter but apparently it didn't matter.

So we waited another 15 mins to sit at a booth and then soon after we sat, a group that was literally right behind us sat at the counter. So that was annoying. Not sure why they wouldn't have a system to write your name down. The workers seemed annoyed that customers coming in kept asking if they need to just wait or put their name in.

The food was a generous portion, enough for a second breakfast! But after I left, I smelled SOOOO greasy all day. I couldn't get home to shower. So be prepared to smell like grease as soon as you walk in."}
{"text":"We never made it past the nasty lady hostess. My wife tried to check in when the line was out the door and the old hag yelled at her to get back in line. So loud i heard her from the street. I can't say anything about the food but if the service from the hostess and given her slovenly appearance I would go around the corner to Pamela's Diner which is what we did."}
{"text":"cold eggs and burnt French toast. we were not impressed by the food. we will not be going here again."}
{"text":"I waited a long time before wading into the whole Deluca's vs. Pamela's dispute, choosing to bring some friends to Deluca's because it was closest to our other errands.  I must also admit that the descriptions of Pamela's pancakes as \"crepes-like\" had some effect on my choosing to try Deluca's first.

Of course, since we come into the city from the boondocks, we arrived at the peak of Saturday morning rush, and waited about 45 minutes to get in the door, but it was a nice, crisp, sunny autumn morning and there were lots of interesting folks to look at and speak with--everyone in line was convivial, anticipating our pending feast.

Inside, the atmosphere was perfect--lots of worn formica, narrow aisles, cramped seats.  This was no showplace but a restaurant that works for a living, a diner.  The gorgeous hostess was efficient verging on brusque, and the waitstaff seemed predominantly hipster in appearnace, but once we were inside the service was swift and attentive, despite the crowds.  Not overly friendly, mind you, but I'm not here to make friends--the priority is eternally full cups of coffee and orders accurate and on time.  They rocked it.  

I did traditional: pancakes, bacon, and home fries.  The pancakes taste exactly how diner pancakes are supposed to taste, the bacon was crisp but not too crisp, and the home fries were decadent and delicious.  Others in our party had the blueberry pancakes, chocolate chip pancakes, the Moab, and the famous breakfast burrito.  I snuck my fork into just about all of it and found the Moab to be especially good.

Would I go back?  In a heartbeat.  I departed feeling full from the generous servings, but would gladly have gorged myself further--I'll probably get the Moab next time, Deluca's has a good thing going for it and they know it.  The prices are a little higher than similar places I've visited, but are by no means excessive--part of what you're paying for is the atmosphere in the strip as well as in the diner.  It's definitely worth the hype."}
{"text":"Always a fav standby - esp when I want breakfast for lunch. Pittsburgh and Strip institution; the food is always good and the service among the friendliest in town. Send your visitors here for a real Pittsburgh experience."}
{"text":"If you're looking for diner food, this is a good bet! I'm wavering between three and four stars, but rounding up for charm.

We were deciding between Pamela's and Deluca's. Deluca's advertised a shorter wait time, so we jumped in line anxious for some breakfast! It was Saturday morning and took about 45 minutes until we got seated. I don't mind waiting for food, but I'm not sure I would wait that long next time. 

The menu is extensive and covers your diner staples from omelettes and eggs benedict, to pancakes and crepes. Everyone at my table ordered something different. I went with the corned beef hash which was served with toast, eggs and home fries. We also got an order of the special pumpkin pancakes to share. The portions were HUGE. We all ate about half of what we got and were stuffed to the brim. The pancakes were better than I imagined they would be and I'd definitely recommend going the sweet and savory route. 

Service was pretty good and efficient. Our waitress spilt a full cup of coffee on the table, but they were quick to react and clean it up. While waiting for our food, we enjoyed looking at all the photos and memorabilia on the wall from local athletes to celebs (and Man vs. Food)! 

Like I said, it was some solid food and we were full for hours. Worth the wait? I'll let you decide that for yourself."}
{"text":"I think this place is over-rated.  I believe this place has a long line only because of its location and its history.  Maybe it was the best breakfast in 1950, not too sure about it in 2017.  There are certainly strong competitors nearby.

You cannot beat its location.  It's the middle of Strip District, and everyone comes to Strip District on the weekend.  

Coffee and breakfast were ok.  Nothing really stand-out.  I tried it once, and not going to wait another hour for it.  If you are here on a weekday / no line somehow, give it a try.  I bet 90% of that line is visitors from out-of-town."}
{"text":"I walked in at around 7:30 AM on a rainy Saturday, and I had a 15 minute wait. The restaurant was absolutely packed, and I enjoyed getting to people watch while I waited to be seated. 

Once I was seated at the counter, I was treated to friendly conversation with the people sitting next to me, while I made the grave mistake of ordering a Bionic Omelet because I thought it was a smaller meal. 

I've never been so happy to be wrong in my life. While the omelet wasn't the best looking once I received it, the taste more than made up for it. The ingredients used were quality, and the toast and hash browns were perfectly golden brown.

I ended up with breakfast for the rest of the weekend. Totally worth your time, if you can get there early enough to not have to wait."}
{"text":"Don't go here at lunch time.

Tried lunch once before and it was so-so.   Definitely not worth the price.

Tried to give it another chance today.    Hostess seated  us pretty quickly but no server to be found.   Ended up getting up and walking out."}
{"text":"The only good thing about DeLuca's is they could accomodate our party of 9.

Our orders were wrong. The omelette I had was overcooked. $3 for a glass of tomato juice? That's ridiculous! Far too expensive for what we received.

I'll never go back."}
{"text":"I don't quite understand the hype. I came here twice while living in Pittsburgh and the first time
The breakfast was okay. We came a second time and I asked for waffle. The waffle came out too crispy so they made it again...which didn't change much. I finally gave up and asked for a pancake.
I wish I took a picture but when I cut into the pancake batter just came pouring out. The waitress was so embarrassed. We finally just got up (the waitress was kind enough to refund us some of our money.. at least for my dish) and called it a morning. Management needs to talk to their cooks bc if you can't make a pancake or waffle at a breakfast place... you will have disappointed customers."}
{"text":"OK maybe I was overly optimistic about the hype of this place, but it wasn't that great.  There was a block long line outside on a Sunday morning to get a table for breakfast.  They were definitely efficient and had great service.  A lot of the breakfast menu items looked like they belonged on a dessert or ice cream parlor menu, rather than a diner. I had huevos rancheros.  The crumbled chorizo was salty enough to choke a horse and there was a lot of it, I wouldn't recommend it.  Another person with us had the breakfast burrito, which he said was overly filled with mismatched odds and ends.  He took the half he couldn't eat there and finished it later.  Our other companion had something else in a burrito and took half of that home also. In my opinion Deluca's needs to focus more on quality and less on quantity.  Maybe the pancakes and waffles are better, but we didn't have them."}
{"text":"Deluca's is the other famous breakfast diner in Pittsburgh.  Like Pamela's, its independently owned, but offers amazing breakfast/brunch/lunch foods.  On weekends they have Lobser Bisque!  Every time I went to Strip District I've always seen kajillion people outside waiting in line, so I decided that I want to try it.

Like Pamela's, they offer a variety of breakfast foods, although more.  The options range from omelets to pancakes to hot cakes and crepes and waffles, and then sandwiches and soups.  I ordered Nutella Chocolate Banana Crepe, and the Sheep ordered their special for today, Cheeseburger Omelets which came with homefries.

I really loved my crepe.  It was wrapped around creamy ricotta cheese, a banana, chocolate chips, and Nutella spread.  However, the crepe itself was thicker than I expected - I would say it was more like a hotcake.  However, they also have hotcakes and pancakes, so I'm assuming hotcakes are even thicker (or greasier, since the Pamela's ones are).  The thing that I loved about the meal was that it was not greasy.  Pamela's is too greasy for me; it makes me feel like I just chugged a bottle of oil by the time I finish the meal.  Also, the ricotta cheese inside the crepe was amazing.  It was creamy, and went really well to balance out the sweetness of Nutella and chocolate chips.  Overall, this is possibly the best crepe I have ever had.

The Sheep really liked the cheeseburger omelet too.  He said that it just tasted like hamburger meat and eggs at first, but as he ate closer to the center it became really cheesey, and he loved it.  The home fries were crispy and was good.  He really loved his meal too.

The only problem with this diner is that the wait was very long.  It took us probably 20 minutes to get in, which was around 9:30am.  By the time we left, probably 10:30 ish the line was still as long.  I would say it is very much worth the wait, even under the hot sun.  =)"}
{"text":"Definitely lives up to the Diner name. All sorts of breakfast standards and the pancake plate was great. Giving you a little taste of everything. Our waitress was wonderful and helped us narrow down that big diner menu. I would recommend the pancakes over the waffle and the breakfast potatoes are pretty much just a mushed up baked potato, so you might want to pass on those for some of the other delicious items. They had 3 types of sausage to choose from and waffle, pancakes or French toast were an option for every combo. Don't let the line outside deter you, it moves really fast."}
{"text":"Get here early or wait in line, especially on early Steeler's game days.  9 am and the line was already out the door on a Sunday, but the line moved fast.  This isn't the first time I've been here, and will definitely not be the last.  

Today I had cinnamon bun pancakes and a side of sweet sausage.  Both were absolutely perfect.  My husband got his usual - the breakfast buritto.  Delicious as always!  

I've never been disappointed by DeLuca's - the service is always friendly and very fast.  It amazes me how efficient they are to crank out breakfast and turnover tables as fast as they do.  They are a machine.  They are amazing.   

Cash only, but there are ATMs all over Penn Ave.  

They say they are the best breakfast in town, and I can't say I disagree."}
{"text":"Anyone who has been to Robinson, knows there's nothing but chain restaurants. DeLuca's Diner is the exception. I'm so mad at myself for waiting so long to finally try it. Went on a Saturday afternoon and the place was packed, so I knew it was a good sign. The sandwiches are the size of your head! Everything is homemade, down to the gravy. I will absolutely be back!!"}
{"text":"Portion sizes are huge here. Don't come here if you're on a diet. I love their benedicts. Their California benedict had lots of avocado, tomato, and spinach. I like that it comes with a large piece of buttered toast instead of English muffins. It also comes with a sizeable side of diced potatoes.  Also had their pumpkin pancakes and blueberry pecan pancakes. Pancakes are again very enormous. I'd say they were about 8\" in lengths. This place is cash only but prices are decently cheap and there's an ATM around the corner."}
{"text":"Food was very good. The portions were HUGE!  It was also a great atmosphere. This will be on my list of to dos for my next trip to Pittsburgh. I had the waffle and sausage gravy. However, next time I am getting a pancake sundae!  Saw a man with one on our way out and it looked amazing. My advice it to go early. We got there about 8a and by the time we left there was a line out the door."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch today. Good breakfast food and didn't have to wait. Fast and great service."}
{"text":"Great service, get food! Whether a local or visiting Pittsburgh this place is a must!!!! Thank you all for the service and food!"}
{"text":"Always good breakfast. My sister and I sat at the counter top and there was not one moment when we didn't have fresh hot coffee and or cups! Portions are extremely generous and very tasty! It is making me hungry for breakfast right now. They only take cash so be sure to take some dollars with you. I love taking Family and friends here when they come in town"}
{"text":"This is an easy five stars for an Pittsburgh institution that's kept itself relevant.

Service is great. Servers are super friendly and come by at the perfect frequency for coffee refills, etc.

Food is excellent. The menu is very prolific, pretty much every diner breakfast option you can imagine plus burritos, etc. There's a lot of veg on this menu and a lot of avocado which makes me very happy, indeed.

Prices are reasonable. Expect to pay $5 for a regular 2 eggs and toast type breakfast and $7-11 for anything else. Coffee is $2.

OH! The most important little secret about this place: They take reservations. I had a group of 10 friends come into town and we made reservations for saturday morning. It was a blast waltzing in with that many people and skipping past the line that was out the door."}
{"text":"Clog your arteries here! Line outside was to the business next door, but it only took us 20 minutes to get seated. Don't let that scare you away.  If it's a weekend, plenty of good people watching as they make their way around the vendors on the strip.  Place seems like it is always crammed (and that probably is in part due to all the tv coverage in recent year's). Omelets can't be beat, and the mixed grills are good as well (and totally customizable to your likes). Still cash only!   Huge menu full of choices, so if breakfast isn't your thing, you have options...and if unhealthy breakfast isn't your thing, they even have cereal and oatmeal.  Closes early (3PM)."}
{"text":"A Pittsburgh institution.  I recently went on Steeler Sunday around 10am -- the wait was less than 5 minutes and the service still adequate (constant coffee refills).  The sausage is delicious.  Try it on a fried egg sandwich but be prepared to take some to go.  It's dirty, greasy, and packed full of Pittsburgh nostalgia just like a greasy spoon should be!  (FYI - cash only)"}
{"text":"Be prepared to wait because it really was that good. Not only were the eggs perfect but the pancake was too and the bacon was -- and I mean this -- the best I have ever had. There's nothing like a good diner breakfast and this one has been the best one I've experienced to date. Highly recommend. I also heard the other location is even better and busier. Won't disappoint yuhs."}
{"text":"We came here for brunch on New Years Day. The wait was about half hour, but there is no indoor space in which to wait so it was cold standing there. The waiting process was also very awkward. There is no list; you just stand in line. Once inside, rather than coming to you, they just point and wave to go to your table. 

Our server was not pleasant in the least. I understand they were busy, but there isn't really an excuse. 

They also are cash only. Who does not accept credit cards in 2016???? 

I was fully prepared to give a 1 star rating given all the issues above. 

The food though was so delicious that it brought them back to 3 stars. The pancakes, eggs, bacon, omelets, home fries and sausage were some of the best I've had."}
{"text":"Great gem of Pittsburgh.  Half the reason we went was from reading other Yelp reviews so Kudos to all of you! Went for breakfast and got the breakfast burrito.  Let's just say that was the breakfast AND lunch burrito.  The portions were huge but great flavor combinations.  Would love to go back and try some more traditional options because everything that was walking by me looked delish!! Go hungry"}
{"text":"DeLuca's is a classic diner experience.  The portions are massive and the food is decent.  The scrambled eggs and pancakes stood out as best in class.  I ordered the MOAB which I was told is 2.5 lbs of food.  It was good but the chorizo was slightly burned which effected the overall flavor.   Service was attentive and really outstanding.   Set expectation to \"big\" and enjoy!!"}
{"text":"This place was awesome. We showed up here on the hottest day of the year and the AC was trying mightily but not quite succeeding. I felt bad for the waitstaff that had to stay there the entire day.

I had the Reese's pancakes sundae with no whipped cream. Good god. The only thing that could make pancakes better is ice cream, really. They were light and fluffy and so sweet I couldn't finish them. Fab.

T had a Greek wrap that was AWESOME. It was served hot with chicken fresh off the flat top. It was grilled before being served so the spinach was wilted and the feta was heated through. Really awesome. I had a tad of food envy. The wrap was served with onion rings that were also pretty good.

A great local spot in the Strip!"}
{"text":"What can I really say about DeLuca's that hasn't been said before by others (and more eloquently, at that)?  

We don't have a place like this in Baltimore, exactly.  Yes, there are great breakfast joints here, but ... I can't say that they serve up food quite like what we experienced at DeLuca's.  A pancake dish that looks suspiciously like a huge apple pie with mountains of whipped cream can't be bad in anyone's book - certainly not in mine.  I can hear my friends in Baltimore going, \"But-but-but... what about Blue Moon Cafe?  What about their Captain Crunch French toast?  But-but-but...\"

Nope.  Sorry.  DeLuca's blows the Captain away, sails and all.  This place is better.  A thousand times better.  

For one thing, DeLuca's has a menu that's about 100 times bigger than what Blue Moon offers.  The only things you come there for is the Sweet Baby Jesus and the Captain Crunch toast - and yeah, they're great for what they are.  But at DeLuca's?  A massive burrito the size of your forearm (aptly named the Mutha of All Burritos, or MOAB), the daily special cheeseburger omelet (which is what I ordered here), a pancake sundae (yes, SUNDAE - buckwheat pancakes with a huge scoop of vanilla ice cream, hot fudge drizzles, cherries, whipped cream in peaks the size of the Appalachians)... how can Blue Moon even begin to compare with this?  Answer?  It can't.  It simply can't.  

Massive respect for the staff here.  I can't even begin to describe the way they're flying around in this tiny-assed little kitchen, serving dish after dish after dish after dish of this insane goodness.  This place only seats 90 people at a time, folks - it's damn near as hard to get in here as it is Blue Moon, that's for sure.  There's always a line.  Be prepared to wait, and be prepared not to complain.  You're going to wait - simple as that - and it's going to be freaking worth every minute.  Grab a book, a lawn chair, play some Candy Crush or whatever, pass the time.  Dream of the huge Appalachian whipped cream mountains you're about to eat.  Really.  If you're willing to sit at the counter instead of a table, you're likely to get in here a lot faster.

Everything was on point, from the coffee to the food to the service.  

The only downside is that, like most places seem to be in the P'burgh, this joint is cash only.  I don't understand it, but hey, hit up the ATM.  This place is worth the hassle.

If you're going to stop for breakfast in Pittsburgh in only one place... this is it.  

We will be back.  That's not a maybe - that's a will.  We WILL be back."}
{"text":"Deluca's Diner has emerged as one of Pittsburgh's best diners and breakfast locations. With lines stretching out of the doors on most weekend mornings, is the food really worth all the commotion? Yes, no question. The menu is itself is something else. Some of the most unique, yet intriguing breakfast options can be found here. Ever seen a banana split crepe before? Neither have I until I ordered one here. The omelets? These things are barely omelets but are plain delicious. Pancakes? They don't get much better than what Deluca's is serving. 
OKAY we get it. The food is outstanding. I even might call it the best breakfast in burgh. Is it worth standing outside, waiting a half hour to get in? Yes. Would I do it in freezing rain? Probably, you can always order a hot chocolate, which is strangely very good. Deluca's for sure delivers on their reputation. You can't go wrong here. Nuff said."}
{"text":"Love this place! It's not the original in the strip but really isn't a whole lot different.

We got here at 9:00 and I thought it would be packed. It was busy but they had open tables. We walked in, got seated and ordered all under 3 minutes, unreal! Im so used to standing in line for 40 minutes at the one in the strip. 

My wife had the pumpkin pancakes (gross!) She said they were good and didn't overpower you with pumpkin flavor. I had corned beef hash, eggs, toast, and home fries. As usual everything was delicious. 

The food was out quick and the service was fast and friendly. What more could you want? Anytime we are in the Robinson area and it's breakfast time Delucas is the first choice."}
{"text":"Went here for a late lunch or even later breakfast with a friend. I had the Banana Peppers omelet with the hot sausage. I felt like something with a bit of a kick. There were tons of banana peppers but the amount of meat paled in comparison so I wasn't super happy about that. But it was good, just not good enough. 

While we were seated very quickly, the food took a while to come out or I imagined it to be longer than it was b/c I was ravenously hungry...who knows. But maybe that's normal for this place. 

I would like to check this place out again and try one of the pancake specialties. I saw folks around us getting what looked to be a pancake sundae - mmmm...sugar rush! 

They had a ton of options which made it hard to choose what I wanted. Also the menu is quite busy (with graphics and colors and nonsense) which made it even more difficult to focus. When presented with so many options, I just feel scattered and couple that with visual distractions and I feel ADD. 

While I may not opt for the omelet next time around I will be stopping by this place again to give it another try."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful breakfast here this morning! I got the sausage and cheddar omelette, and my girlfriend got the banana creme crepe with strawberries! Both were wonderful. The proportion size was great for the price! Our meals were delicious as well! The staff was friendly, and the atmosphere was great! They had so many great looking items on there menu it was tough to choose from! We will definitely be going back to try more of there food!"}
{"text":"I recently went to Pittsburgh for one week trip and this was my favorite breakfast spot in the city. My friend and I went here three times during my trip because I liked it so much. It's a true hometown diner with good food and great service. 

Even though there was a heavy amount of drinking going on during my trip we always managed to get up ridiculously early to brave the crowds at Deluca's. It was well worth it and you definitely can not beat the prices (anything is cheaper outside of NYC though!).

Everything was tasty from the pancakes to the breakfast burritos. A truly good greasy spoon!"}
{"text":"Can't go wrong when you hit up Deluca's. For the price point and the food, it's totally worth it. This is a little diner, it's a gem to me. Great place to get breakfast or brunch. I won't be able to review about their lunch and dinner as my fiancé stopped by to eat breakfast. I got the grilled mixed, amazing especially if you love veggies! I had fresh veggies with over easy egg with a slice of ham. I loved the atmosphere of the place. I was pretty jealous my fiancé got the country fried chicken.  I wanted to eat all of his food. The fried chicken was fried and seasoned to perfection!! The gravy tasted just like biscuits and gravy. This is an absolute place you have to check out in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Long on my list of places to try, I finally got to this long time Pittsburgh breakfast spot. Friend of Joe's, Kevin was in town for some R&R and called me on a cold Thursday morning for breakfast, I offered Deluca's as a choice since I've never been there and neither has he. After he accepted, I got to thinking how bad parking was in the strip. Low and behold a spot opened about a half block away. We walked in and immediately were seated in the same booth Adam Richman sat in filming a spot for Man Vs Food some years back. Once seated, a waitress zoomed in with menus, coffee cups and a hot pot of coffee, almost reading my mind. The coffee was okay, nothing special, think the same coffee at Eat N Park or Kings, a little disappointing. Looking over the menu it was loaded with Pittsburgh favorites and gluttonous offerings. I choose the thin, crepe like pancakes served with loganberry preserves. Kevin on the other hand chose the Steel City breakfast, 2 hot cakes, sausage, bacon, eggs, and toast made from Macinie's bread. It was huge amount of food. My crepe like pancakes were lite, airy and delicious. The loganberry preserves with the perfect compliment for them, adding a touch of sweetness, a perfect foil for the savory crepes. The bill came to under 16 bucks which isn't too bad, about the same as Eat N Park or King's. the only trouble is parking, and would derail me from making this one of my go to places."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in while we were in Pittsburgh for the Steelers/Browns game over NYE weekend. OMG is all I have to say. Probably the best breakfast I've ever eaten. It was rather busy, but we only waited a couple of minutes to be seated. Our waitress was practically at our table waiting to take our drink order when we were seated. She took our order and had our fiod back out to us within 10-15 minutes tops. We ended up ordering way too much food, but goodness was it amazing!

Our order:
-Philly Cheesesteak Omelet: Perfect. The eggs, meat, and veggies were perfectly cooked and seasoned.
-Sausage gravy and homemade biscuit: Probably the best I've ever eaten. I can't even begin to describe the buttery biscuit and thick, creamy gravy.
-Home fries, Corned beef hash, and eggs overeasy: The eggs were thoroughly cooked, the home fries were soft on the inside and crispy on the outside, and the corned beef hash was perfect. It was fried perfectly, not soggy or too crunchy, just right.
-Dolce da Choccolato: Words cannot describe or do it justice. It's a crepe filled with Nutella and strawberries topped with whipped cream and dusted with powdered sugar. I love crepes and ordered it thinking it would be like any other crepe. I was WRONG! This sucker was at least 12\" long, yes seriously a foot long. I have never seen strawberries that big before. It took both of us to eat it and we barely we able to finish it.

The term \"Best breakfast in town\" is a lie. It needs to be changed to \"Best breakfast on the planet!\""}
{"text":"Excellent food.  The French toast taste delicious and the chicken and waffles are pretty good too, not Roscoe's House of Chicken and Waffles, Maggianos, or Chicago's Home of Chicken and Waffles but for Pittsburgh they are probably at or near the top.  The pancake was good as the bacon eggs and potatoes.  They give you a sausage patty the size of a burger but all in all it was good.

The presentation leaves much to be desired so I can't give it 5 stars but the food is fantastic!"}
{"text":"DeLuca's is a Pittsburgh landmark with a great reputation... and I found it to be \"all that and a bag of chips.\"  

Get there early... as it gets packed on the weekends.  There is no wait list, so you need to get in line.  Once seated, I found the wait staff was very attentive.

The food was delicious and I will look to return here next time I'm in the Burgh.   Loved the Pittsburgh Slam with 2 eggs, potatoes, bacon, sausage and French Toast (Lingonberry Preserve & Lemon).

The Coffee is good and the menu has a lot of interesting dishes for both breakfast and lunch.  As I was here for breakfast, I hope to go back soon to explore some of the other dishes."}
{"text":"I was expecting more from this restaurant. I was enjoying my husbands efforts in putting this date together. The food was slightly disappointing.  I had biscuits and sausage gravy. I received biscuits and floury tasting gravy. The sausage was M.I.A. My husband had the lobster bisque soup. The same lobster M.I.A. The staff was kind to us but very busy. I had that experience but will I go back NO! I will however visit the strip over and over it is a blast of fun. Take plenty of money with you because you will spend it."}
{"text":"CASH ONLY!

When in PIT for business I was told that I had to go to Deluca's for breakfast.  Now, I am telling you the same.  This place is in the Strip and has been there for a very long time.  A nice variety of items on the menu.  This is old school dinner at it's very best.

CASH ONLY!
CASH ONLY!
CASH ONLY!"}
{"text":"I stopped by here today with my parents and sister for breakfast.  We were debating over a place to eat in the Strip District and I offered up DeLuca's as I have had decent experiences there before and there is always a line out the door waiting for seats.  We arrived at around 9:15 and walked right into the restaurant and were seated in the upstairs portion.  The inside of this place is nothing special and looks like many other diners.  They did have a t shirt from man v food (circa 2006) on the wall above us.

For my breakfast I decided to start off with a coffee which was poured within seconds of ordering and delivered to our table.  Then after a few minutes of deliberating over the huge menu I ended up going with the Huevos Rancheros for my breakfast.  After ordering our waitress disappeared and I am pretty sure that I never saw her again until we had to ask another waitress to get her for our check.  That meant that after about 10 minutes of waiting with an empty cup of coffee, I ended up helping myself to the pot that was sitting nearby.  I never did get a third cup which would have been nice.  Anyways, after a reasonable amount of time our food made it out to our table and my Huevos Rancheros looked pretty good.  The egg was sunny side up and whenever I cut through it, the yolk dripped nicely onto the tortilla, cheese, salsa and chorizo underneath it.  It tasted decently enough although I would have personally liked it quite a bit spicier.  After I was about half way through my my meal the avocado that was supposed to come on it materialized to our table.  It was maybe 1/4 of a total avocado cut into 4 very small slices which were quickly gone.  Whenever my family and I had finished our meals we proceeded to wait about 10 minutes for our waitress to come to our table.  Finally giving up on that we asked another waitress to ask our waitress for the bill.  She did and about 10 minutes later and after again asking our waitress for the bill, we were able to pay.  The sad thing is that we were trying to get out of there and there was a huge line of people outside waiting to get in.

The bottom line for me is that I would probably avoid coming here in the future.  While the food was decent tasting I found it to be overpriced and our service was just miserable."}
{"text":"The pancakes were amazing! I had a blueberry pancake and bacon and my husband had the French toast combo. Everything was amazing!"}
{"text":"People talk about the line the wait etc but it was fast getting in and getting served food was good and great price service real Pittsburghy and I loved it"}
{"text":"Ok, so up until this point, I would say Deluca's gets 4 stars. However, yesterday I had an experience to give them that extra star. I always get one of the eggs Benedict or something in the sandwich section or a regular breakfast with pancakes. 

But wait so back to yesterday, we had multiple servers come up and wait on us and try to fill our water or get us stuff. On top of that, my friend doesn't eat pork so he asked for all turkey sausage with his meal. Unfortunately it came out with bacon piled on it. However, the waitress immediately took it back once we said it wouldn't have been a big deal but he doesn't eat pork and they started making a whole new plate of everything. 

I decided to branch out and get the chicken and waffle. I'm picky about chicken and waffles no matter where I go because I've had some great ones and some ok ones. But let me tell you, this no frills chicken and waffle was amazing. It's nothing fancy, which is what I expected. But the chicken was soooo juicy and breaded and fried perfectly and the waffle had just enough sweetness to it to balance it out and was dense but fluffy at the same time. And the best part is it comes with a side of eggs. Usually when I get chicken and waffles I want eggs and get them as a side but this one it comes with it and I got them over easy and it was great. 

Honestly I can't wait to go get it again."}
{"text":"When a place has a line out the door on a cold January Sunday morning, it's a good sign about the food. We did end up waiting a while to be seated, but it was worth it to enjoy an old-school breakfast in this Pittsburg institution.  I got a veggie omelet which I thoroughly enjoyed; others in my party ordered diverse items from their extensive breakfast menu. From eggs to pancakes to the biggest ham slice any of us had ever seen, everything was well prepared and the service was great as well.  The atmosphere here is unique; the place is a bit (or a lot) of a time warp, which was fantastic in and of itself. This place knows what works, and has apparently just stuck with that, for decades.  Do check this place out- it's worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Came here because our Lyft driver recommended it.  Good food and lots of it.  This is a true old school diner, not fancy at all.  Expedient service, probably because of lots of people wanting to eat there. Large menu and abundant portions.  It's not exactly cheap but a good value for what you get.

My husband loved his Eggsceptional egg sandwich.  It was served on thick cut Italian toast and very delicious.  My spinach, tomato and feta omelet was good but a little overcooked.

Get there early to avoid a wait, but don't get discouraged if there is one.  The place is a lot bigger than it looks and they move people in and out quickly.

And remember -- Cash only."}
{"text":"Best breakfast in town! It's always busy on the weekends so you may have to wait for a table but it's worth it. Food is always fantastic and service is great!"}
{"text":"Please add more stars as an option because Deluca's deserves all the stars!
I came here with a large party for brunch on a snowy and very cold Saturday morning.  That didn't stop a line of people from standing outside to get in.  We, however, had reservations and walked right in much to chagrin of said folks waiting in the 5 degree weather.
A table was waiting with a reserved table tent on us and we were immediately approached by our friendly server.  Two people had bailed (due to weather) and a few of our friends were running behind (due to weather) but the server had no qualms about telling us not to worry and to keep the extra two seats for our purses.  
Once the entire crew arrived we ordered and received our dishes promptly.  I had the Super Bowl omelet which contained mashed potatoes, kielbasa and onions.  And that may seem a little odd to some but I tell you this was the most delicious breakfast I've ever eaten.  It came with a side of hot baked apples which I added to the omelet and it complimented it beautifully.  This also came with toast.  
So, so, so very good.  There was not one complaint at the table and we all pledged to come back again soon."}
{"text":"Hands down better than Pamelas.  Love the sci-fi space theme.  The line is manageable.  Try Tuesday morning at 9am, no one is there."}
{"text":"Amazing homemade food, good service, great breakfast spot in the Strip District!"}
{"text":"Quick, no frills, but very tasty establishment. Get your hash browns extra crispy!"}
{"text":"French Toast is amazing. Definitely worth the wait in line. However, I've had the same waiter the last two times who was less than inviting. He spoke so loud and uninterested it felt like he was yelling at us. Despite the relatively poor service (he didn't even come back to check on us) it's still the best breakfast ever! I keep going back for more."}
{"text":"Deluca's in the strip district def defines a trip to Pittsburgh - I ordered hot turkey sandwich with gravy and mash- with out a doubt good! Staff was friendly..."}
{"text":"Well done diner food.  Deluca's is pretty good for a greasy spoon.

The line moves surprisingly fast outside, so don't be daunted by a wait.  And once inside, staff is quick and friendly.

We had breakfast: traditional eggs, biscuits, meats, potatoes - all were very good.   The breakfast burritos are pretty big, too; best to share.  All the breakfast meats (sausages, bacon, and chiorzo) were fresh and flavorful."}
{"text":"Went in around 2:15 pm to get lunch. We didn't realize they closed at 3. They seated us and everyone was polite. The food was ok. Food was maybe 2-2.5 stars out of 5. The entire 35 minutes we were there the 8 or so workers sat 1 table over from us and spent the entire time trashing another coworker and other customers. They were so loud we could hardly hold our own conversation. It was awkward. They were counting the money, mopping all around us and sweeping huge piles of mess by our table as we ate. Such an awful experience and with the food not being that good, I probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Okay so we attempted to go to the strip district location but the line was so long we went to Pamela's instead which we loved! Check out my review of that place.

This place was in a shopping plaza so the wait was 15 mins at most. People say the food is the same as that on the strip but if that's the case I'm so happy we didn't wait in that line. We were underwhelmed. The food was average diner food. I love a good casual greasy spoon place but that place was absolutely nothing special. We wont be returning."}
{"text":"it is very difficult to get my 7 year old nephew to eat ANYTHING.  We go to dinner and he will eat a bite and say he is full.  Well, that is until we went to Delucas.  He got a full adult order of french toast and ate it!  Then asked if we could come there again when we come to Pittsburgh!  His approval alone is enough for a 4 star review but it didn't hurt that 6 more adults and 1 child also enjoyed their meals!  the fried fish sandwich was great and the homemade sausage they serve is a must if you are going with a breakfast entree!  

Thanks Deluca for getting my nephew to eat a whole meal!"}
{"text":"I came one Saturday morning for brunch and I must say it's worth the wait. The line moves surprisingly fast because the waiters and busboys are super efficient. Tried the feta spinach omelet and their chocolate banana hotcake special. I was very satisfied and even more satisfied with the staff. They were attentive, constantly pouring coffee, and always checking up on my friend and I. The atmosphere is warm and the customers all seem to be enjoying themselves."}
{"text":"I went today with my boyfriend around 10:30am. We were sat quickly at the counter despite the fact that they were busy. The food came out quickly, both were large portions, and our server was awesome! Definitely a must go to breakfast spot when visiting Pittsburgh! Be sure to stop at the ATM as it is cash only!"}
{"text":"Visiting Pittsburg for the weekend, we picked Deluca's solely based on the number of positive Yelp reviews, but I really thought it was just so-so. 
 
The staff was amazing and the whole place runs like a machine.  We got there ~9:15 and there were about six groups ahead of us, but we didn't wait long since they're exceptionally fast at getting tables cleared and ready for the next party.  An empty plate never sat longer than a few seconds and our coffee was always full.
 
I ordered way too much food, as usual:  Sausage gravy and biscuits with scrambled eggs and potatoes with an extra single \"fancy pancake\" with lingonberries.  My husband ordered some sort of breakfast burrito which I didn't try.  

The sausage gravy and biscuits came out first and they were AMAZING.  The side of eggs and potatoes and the pancake came out about five minutes later; not really a biggie, but I'm not really sure if they just forgot and threw it together when I asked where it was because the eggs almost seemed like somebody started to make fried eggs and then decided at the last second that they should be scrambled.  They were runny and yolky in spots and white and fried-eggy in other spots (pretty much exactly like you would expect a chopped-up fried egg to look).  Maybe this is the way that they always are, but it was really unappetizing.  The pancake was also off somehow.  I looked around at everybody else's pancakes and they were light and fluffy, but mine was deflated with an almost rubbery texture.  It's like they used crepe batter, but it was thicker than I would expect a crepe to be.  The potatoes were good, but nothing remarkable.  Maybe my expectations were just too high..."}
{"text":"Visited this Labor Day for breakfast. We actually intended to go to Pamela's, but they were closed today. There was a line at Deluca's, as usual, but it moved pretty quickly and we were seated in about 15 minutes. 

Service was brusque, no nonsense...not friendly but not outright unfriendly either I suppose. I had my usual breakfast burrito, good as always, and quite filling. I tried some of the hub's waffle with ice cream and whatnot on top...delish.

I noticed today that their booths along the side are rather uncomfortable...the seat feels too shallow so you feel like you are just about the fall off it the whole time and your butt starts to hurt. Really not that big a deal though.

All in all, still some good food."}
{"text":"Visiting from California to beautiful Pittsburg for the Steelers game.  Was told by all the locals that this is a must go to place for breakfast if we visiting in town.  Got there  and the wait was about 5 minutes (we got lucky) and all I can say is this place is one of the best breakfast places my wife and I have ever eaten at. I had the friend chicken and waffle with a side of potatoes and my wife had a waffle with some ham.  Simply amazing and the service was very good.  

If you visiting Pittsburg, this place is a must go to!!!!!!  We honestly liked it better than Pamela's."}
{"text":"Meh - Nothing special just a greasy spoon diner serving up decent but very average breakfast. Hollandaise sauce out of a mix, average potatoes, average pancakes, really nothing to the place except it is a Pittsburgh icon, much like Primanti brothers, it's legendary for what it once was not for what it is now.

I'm glad we didn't wait for breakfast and if I was going show off a breakfast spot in Pittsburgh I think Pamela's would be my first choice."}
{"text":"I like Deluca's.  I think the place has a good Pittsburgh atmosphere and the service is always great.  I really do enjoy coming here every once in a while when I'm down in the strip.  That said, the food doesn't generally blow me out of the water.  It's definitely good, but I have to say that I prefer the Dor-Stop in Dormont for breakfast.

We went over the weekend.  Our service was great, as usual, everyone is very friendly.  I got corned beef hash (something the Dor-Stop is lacking), and it was alright.  It's hard to find really amazing corned beef hash - if you're ever in the Cleveland area and that's your thing, check out Big Al's.  Best I've ever had.

My boyfriend got a breakfast burrito, which is his go-to most places.  He said it was good, but definitely preferred it elsewhere.

Overall, I think we would probably be a lot more excited about this place if we didn't have a place we liked better right near us."}
{"text":"i could probably count on one hand the number of times that i've waited in line to eat at a place with fluorescent lights.  this is one of them.

we waited in line outside next to the \"best breakfast in pittsburgh\" sign for about 30 minutes before being seated.  the wait was partly due to today being labor day, and partially due to our showing up at 11:30am.  was the wait worth it?  every minute of it.

+1 for a menu FULL of wonderful breakfast items.  most items are non-traditional.  deluca's has many non-standard items that are locally well-known.

+1 for friendly service amidst the demands of 100+ hungry people.

+1 for a great location.  strip district.

+1 for relatively quick service.

+1 for the best (and largest) omelet i've ever had, named the \"bionic omelet\".

+1 for the best overall breakfast i've ever had.

-1 for cash only.

highly recommended.  favorite of both locals and tourists.  i will likely return.  come early to avoid any lines."}
{"text":"After reading some of the negative  remarks I had to chime in.  First and foremost please realize this is a local, greasy spoon, neighborhood, breakfast like dinner with history, reputation and the Burg flare.  Is that a run-on sentence? Anyway, I doubt anyone from California will \"get it\".  Although I would expect those from the east coast or even the great lake cities to be able to identify with it.  This isn't a bad thing.  I appreciate trendy light food as much as the next Yelper, but don't go here looking for a fusion dinner with wi-fi and a coffee bar.

Yes, bring cash, be willing to wait in line, and it is a little dirty.   I am a coffee snob, so they could improve their coffee.

But, the staff is fun, the kitchen is quick and the portions are big.  The food is good hardy breakfast food.  My son particularly likes to get the waffles with ice cream.  Being an athlete who can't consumes enough calories in a day, I say go for it!  The other  kids like the pancakes while my wife and I like the omelets... 

Enjoy before heading out to the strip to buy some fresh food!  
Or, if its been a long night,  enjoy before heading home to bed...You decide."}
{"text":"I don't understand why people line up out the door and down the street for this place. It seems to be very overrated and overpriced. We went early Tuesday morning and there was no wait (thankfully).

I came in from out of town and was told by several people that I had to go to Deluca's. I got the country breakfast and I was less than wowed by what I got. My meal came out to me in portions as they were ready at separate times. The fried chicken is merely a chicken tender with gravy and shredded cheese poured on top (not enough to put any on my biscuit that came out halfway through). The homefries were good. 

Apparently, it is a seat yourself and grab your own menu kind of place. Another customer paying ended up handing us two menus before any staffers acknowledged our existence.

Our waitress was very nice, so I kept them at 3 stars."}
{"text":"Haven't been here in a long time and we looked forward to visiting this establishment today since we drove to Pittsburgh to visit family.  Very disappointed! Prices went up, cash only, owner/Manager very rude! Had to ask for coffee refill twice! Overall breakfast was good and plenty of it too! Hostess very friendly. We won't be visiting this establishment anytime soon! I rather revisit Door Stop in  Dormont or Bobs in Carnegie! Adios DeLucas!"}
{"text":"The food here is inexpensive and excellent.  I got the mixed grill, which was featured on man vs food. There are so many vegetables in it and the portions are huge... I could only eat half. Our table also split a banana split crepe. YUM. Would definitely recommend. Get here early on a weekend, we waited in line at 10am for about 30 minutes. The line moves quickly and food comes out fast. I'm only deducting a star because I could see the kitchen and toast is handled with bare hands.  Also, if you're getting toast, get the Italian bread. The Italian bread they serve here with toast and eggs Benedict is delicious, crusty and fresh. (Yes, I ate the toast even though someone touched it...germs build the immune system, right?!)"}
{"text":"We didn't really wait that long in line, maybe 10-15 minutes.
While we were seated pretty quickly, we didn't get served until after the couple next to us had been seated and waited on.  NOT COOL!
Food was good, I had Texas Cinnamon French Toast and Turkey Sausage.  Toast had a hint of onions and peppers which was off putting but overall good. Very good turkey sausage.  Husband had Eggs Benedict hash with chicken and avocado.  He said he didn't think there was any avocado on the plate.  
Overall good food, underwhelmed by the wait staff, maybe that's why there's always a line out the door."}

{"text":"We had 15 people in our party as we ended our stay in Pittsburgh for our family wedding. It took us two hours to get everyone together in the hotel lobby just to get ready to leave for this family style restaurant...and it was going on lunchtime, but this place served breakfast all day long. And WHAT a breakfast it was. Some 
In our group had lunch, but most, breakfast. Huge menu selection. My western style omelet was hot, full of veggies and ham, side of real home fries grilled and crispy!  The 12 inch plate was filled!  Cheese dripping off the side!  The waitress was not flustered at our large group and accommodated our party with a professional flair. All the food was hot and served us almost all at the same time!  Couldn't finish.  Wanted to. Delish!!! Recommend highly. Great food,flavor, service!  Small but adequate booths on the side... Tables down the middle, of which we commandeered three for our party."}
{"text":"The portions are big; the food is good; the kitchen is quick; and the prices are reasonable.  What more could you want in a greasy spoon?

I finally got around to trying this Pittsburgh landmark in the Strip District, and I was pleasantly surprised by what I found.  The pancakes were delicious (thick and rich), and everything else was acceptable or better--not to mention plentiful (with my meal I received a mountain of home fries, eggs, bacon, sausage and toast...not bad, especially given the prices).

The one strike against this place (aside from the waits if you come at peak times) was that the waiter acknowledged but then ignored all requests for drink refills, leaving me thirsty for more water and my companion rationing the smallest $2 cup of diner coffee anyone ever received.  If I find this issue persistent over multiple visits (and I'll certainly be back), that will probably cost them a star, but for now I'll overlook one server having one bad day and give this place a reasonably enthusiastic endorsement.

Deluca's is too good a value to not try again."}
{"text":"Breakfast was fantastic! I had a create your own omelette!! I was so fool from breakfast, I didn't have to eat lunch!!"}
{"text":"I gave it another shot- Great service- great food.  Must have just been a bad day the last time or they got rid of the bad people there.

love it once again.  I will be back."}
{"text":"When we first got there the line was very long,  but it was worth the wait for sure!!! My boyfriend and I both ordered the breakfast burritos. The burritos were so delicious!  Another thing that was pretty cool was we were seated in the booth right next to where Tom Cruise sat in a scene from \"Jack Reacher\"!!! I think we'll make it a tradition coming here on the weekends for breakfast! Definitely 5 stars!!"}
{"text":"HUGE portions of tasty food. Prompt service. Cash only. Preferred breakfast here over Pamela's. Got a cinnamon roll pancake, sweet Lord it was so delish I didn't even want to share a bite with my guy! The body builder egg white omelette with chicken, spinach, and Asiago was much better than anticipated. Omelette came with oatmeal, fresh fruit, and fresh Italian toast. Enough for two. Go here!"}
{"text":"Dinery diner you've ever dined at. Huge super filling menu, awesome staff, friendly faces and all the interaction or lack there of you want. Highly recommend the MOAB (that's pronounced moe-ahb NOT M-O-A-B)."}
{"text":"Place is a typical diner setting. Very friendly staff! (Thanks Mary)! Food was okay. Not the best ham I've tasted. Potatoes were a little burnt and eggs were over medium/hard."}
{"text":"Classic, no frills diner with fantastic food. The pancakes, mixed grill and omelets are my favorite things to order. It's fun to watch them cook at the grill too. The bacon is perfectly crisp and thick. Yes the lines can be long if you go on a weekend but it's well worth the wait. Even better is going during the week. Cash only, so be prepared :)"}
{"text":"A much-needed non-chain restaurant in Robinson township?!?!! They are too few and far between. While my heart lies with the original in the strip, my taste buds don't discriminate. The same awesome food is found here. One of these days, I will tear myself away from the omelets and mixed grill to try some of non-breakfast items that look fantastic coming out of the grill area. It's so nice to have a non-chain option in this area!!!  BONUS POINTS...my waitress offered me coffee to go! Great service AND food"}
{"text":"Super breakfast in a real institution.   Great cheese steak omelet, wife loved eggs Benedict,  kids loved the French toast.   Cash only.   Walking around the strip district is interesting as well.   Parked for $5 down the road in a gravel lot ( car full of luggage)."}
{"text":"This place is really quantity over quality. Sure, you can order a ridiculously large amount of food and snap an Instagram picture, but the quality ain't that much better than any other decent diner. I'm not saying it's bad. It's pretty good, but people standing in line for over an hour is really unnecessary. If you want to come here, get up the extra hour early and get here before 8."}
{"text":"Great pancakes and delicious eggs, but the diner felt a bit dingy and dirty. It could definitely use a facelift, and expect a wait."}
{"text":"The Strip on the weekend is always busy and the day of a parade busier still.  But if you get a brave soul (Dad) to wait in line in the cold it works out well.  I was able to hit Penn Mac and do some other shopping.   Think it was about a 30 minute wait but when it's 25 degrees giving a good coffee as a peace offering makes it better.

I had eggs over medium, bacon, etc. which was good for the price but my eggs were more on the over easy side.  Others had the special - French toast with strawberries and got fudge.  I was told it was wonderful.

A definite Pittsburgh dive - and a must try.  Just beware of the stairs to the restroom."}
{"text":"I went to this place for the first time today by myself while Christmas shopping because it looked nice and nostalgic inside with the 50s diner look.
Long story short while sitting at the counter for quick service, or so I thought,  the waitress who wasnt around was told by the cashier that I was waiting to order, mean while she just continued to joke around and laugh with the cook while I'm sitting there waiting to order. I finally got fed up waiting and just left. So I cannot comment on the food because I never got a chance to try it but I can comment that the service was terrible !!"}
{"text":"One of the best breakfast places in Pittsburgh. My first time here, and it was packed on a Saturday, but we were seated right away. We had attentive service, but we took a while to order due to how confusing the menu is to read. I got the Eggs Benedict and it was fantastic. Our food was delivered quickly, considering on how busy they were. Would recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"I know this place typically has a long wait but somehow I snuck in on a Saturday afternoon and sat at the bar for breakfast right away.  The service was amazingly fast.  I ordered the Huevos Rancheros and it literally came out in less than 30 seconds.  I was sitting next to the grill so I saw that they really made it and didn't just reheat something and their speed is impressive!  The food was pretty tasty but it had a bit too much chorizo (and I love meat).  Huge portion sizes and definitely a very Pittsburgh sort of place.  Don't go here if you are looking for something healthy ;)

I went back again later with a couple of friends and we all had a great experience.  The portions are HUGE and everything was delicious.  I think my friend's omelet had like 6 eggs and at least a pound of meat."}
{"text":"For breakfast, I had a cheese omellete with toast here, and it tasted delicious."}
{"text":"After seeing Deluca's on TV, my friend had to go during our trip. We've walked by in previous years and it had a huge line. 
     This year, we walked right into disappointment. We sort of expected something special but it was more like Alice's Diner. Old booths, old equipment and old grease mist floating in the air making it hard to breath.
     To be honest the food was good but average. Not worth all the TV excitement or driving more than a mile or two for. And not as good as other places near by.
     The service was good and pretty fast. 
     All in all it was an average meal, in an average diner. I will say that some of the lunch menu items sounded more interesting."}
{"text":"The signature breakfast burrito was a dud. A tortilla wrapped around some greasy bacon and home fries with some dry scrambled eggs served with a glop of canned refried beans.  The waffled sundae was good but too pricey.  This place is typical of what was once a quaint hole in the wall diner that served good food, but became popular and now just cranks out mediocre food.  Is crowded because of its rep not for the quality of its food."}
{"text":"Yes, Deluca's is very good .  Yes, they make a great breakfast.  However, is it worth waiting in line forever on Sunday morning? No.

Deluca's is an iconic place that people seem to swarm to and I appreciate that but I go early in the AM and enjoy their food without the really crazy waits others seem to love to endure.

Weightlifter breakfast is really tastey."}
{"text":"The highlights:
Good servers that keep checking in on you as necessary. Everyone we talked to was very nice.
Very good pancakes, whether they're plain or with syrup.
Great home fries. Very crispy and oily, just as i would hope for.
Good eggs
Good crispy bacon

The lowlights:
They don't offer pure maple syrup, even for an extra charge. I know it's expensive to give out, but I'd gladly pay for it.
Weak coffee / iced coffee. It's pretty terrible, actually. Also, their only sugar sub. is knockoff sweet n low. Our waitress was great and offered me acouple of Splenda from her own stash. It's a small thing.

Notes:
Milkshake was thin but tasty and service was fast. I'd come back here if i were in the city!"}
{"text":"Breakfast is always great here!!! Today an omelette with provolone,  kielbasa,  hot sausage. And onions!!! Sided with some fried potatoes and fresh Mancinis bread, a Pittsburgh staple for sure!!!"}
{"text":"Wow! First time in Pittsburg, first time to eat here. Everyone raves about it and I can see why. 

Service was similar to southern hospitality which I sound odd for a northern state. The real definition of an old school breakfast diner. CASH ONLY! 


We had the seafood Benedict, banana praline crepe, Reese's hot cake sundae, and coffee. 

The seafood Benedict was excellent! Perfect amount of seafood, avocado, and runny yolk to cover the toasted bread underneath. 

The coffee is bomb. The hot cake sundae is a perfect dessert to share for 2-3 people. And the banana praline crepe is decent (the banana is just cold wrapped in a hot crepe with a touch of sweet ricotta and yummy pralines. I would have liked it more with sliced cooked bananas)"}
{"text":"Long waits on the weekend . 
Omelet was okay. The coffee and service is good ,
and it is convenient to the shops I frequent on the strip.
Would recommend going early to beat the crowds ."}
{"text":"I give 5 stars sparingly and Deluca's is completely deserving. We waited outside in the sweltering heat, during prime brunch time, for almost 30 minutes but knew it was worth the wait. There is nothing fancy or classy about this place which is actually quite endearing. The menu? Basically anything you can imagine for brunch. Really happy we got to visit this Pittsburgh staple after almost a year of living here. Portions are insanely big but we love leftovers so it wasn't an issue."}
{"text":"My first visit to Pittsburgh. I love little greasy diners, and Deluca's was great. I ate the \"Pigs in a Blanket\" crepe and ordered a chocolate milkshake as well. Both were very delicious, and I would love to try some of the other items on their menu. I love breakfast, greasy diners and paying in cash (the last one is a lie). 

I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"First time here and it is absolutely amazing! I had the Steel City Breakfast of Champs. I got my eggs scrambled and they were perfectly cooked...not over cooked and a bit hard like most places do. The hot sausage is definitely hot! Steer clear if spicy is not your thing. Ordered bacon extra crispy and was cooked just right. Pancakes were so yummy! The outside rim was just a bit crunchy with a fluffy center. Very tasty!!! Great food for a great price! Bring your appetites because the portions are very generous!!!"}
{"text":"As other reviews state, there is a long wait. We waited for about 40 min.

The hubby got the famous breakfast burrito. He said it was good, but it was definitely missing something. Also, the flavor profile was only \"chorizo.\" we have had better.

I got the huevos rancheros. Good, but also lacking something.

We split a pumpkin pancake, and a cinnamon bun pancake. The pumpkin was great, but the cinnamon bun was still completely raw in the middle, like, oozing batter, which was gross.

Good overall, not great. We have had better.

Gonna try pamelas next..."}
{"text":"Don't really get the hype about this place.

PROS: huge portions

CONS: bad service (the waitress didn't get my order right, and ignored us for almost the entire meal), hard and uncomfortable benches, small (we were seated right next to the door, and cold air was blowing in the entire time we were eating), food just wasn't that good. Breakfast burrito was OK. Mixed grilled was bland."}
{"text":"Fast service and delicious food. Great prices. Cinnamon  sugar french toast was to die for. This was my first trip but there will definitely be more."}
{"text":"Awesome Breakfast.  Try any of the flavored pancakes.  My wife has had a few of the different flavors and they all have been outstanding.  Also try the Breakfast sandwich on homemade bread with Uncle Charlies Hot Sausage, it is by far the best Breakfast Sandwich I have ever had."}
{"text":"I've driven past Deluca's Diner for over a year now, each time with the intention of eating there. Because I usually visit the Strip on the weekends, however, there would always be a (long) line outside of Deluca's. After asking a few potential patrons how long they have been waiting, to which their responses would be between 30 and 45 minutes, I just walked away.

Sorry, while I consider myself a patient guy, I can only last so long before I hulk out from hanger.

This is why I make a point of avoiding diners on weekend mornings, unless I have a snack before surrendering myself to the dreaded line.

Anyway, I finally had the chance to come here on a Wednesday morning with a friend for brunch. We found street parking without needing to circle around the area for half an hour and fume silently over endless pedestrians crossing the streets. As expected, there was a line, but it was nowhere near as long as that on weekend mornings. The people in front of us said that they've been waiting for 5-10 minutes. Not bad.

Within 10 minutes, the hostess seated me and my friend at a table near the back of the diner. The wall to which our table stood adjacent proudly displayed their achievements of being recognized by former Steelers players, and of being featured in movies and on \"Man vs. Food.\" Miscellaneous posters pertaining to Pittsburgh and diner-esque themes covered the rest of the walls.

Our waiter promptly introduced himself, gave us our menus, and asked if we'd like anything to drink. My friend requested water; I requested water and coffee. Within a few minutes, we had some water and I had my steaming mug of coffee. I usually take my coffee black, and this coffee was pretty good. After perusing the menu and debating whether we should get omelettes, pancakes or waffles or French toast, or breakfast sandwiches for almost 10 minutes, we finally made our decision. By this time, a waiter would have checked up on us at least twice; our waiter hadn't come by. We waited a few more minutes and eventually he came and took our orders briskly.

Within 10 minutes, we got our food. I got the Italian Veggie Frittata, my friend got the \"Da Burgh\" Philly Cheesesteak omelette, and we got full stack of French toast with strawberries. Our omelettes were excellent. Both of ours came with homefries and biscuits. My omelette with stuffed with veggies and a good amount of cheese, while my friend's was stuffed with juicy, tender steak, onions, and peppers. The homefries were all right. I came across several pieces that were undercooked and several pieces that were charred. I thought the biscuits tasted great but my friend thought that it must have been made using Bisquick because of their texture and taste. I didn't care; I just slathered my strawberry jam on them and stuffed my face.

According to the menu, the French toast is made using bread from Mancini's bakery. The toast itself was good, but the \"fresh\" strawberries on top brought down the dish. Upon arriving at our table, the strawberries lacked their vibrant red color; instead, they looked wilted and gray-red. I tasted one and I immediately thought \"defrosted frozen strawberries.\" It was so mushy and lacked any taste. I then proceeded to slide the strawberries off my piece of French toast before finishing it.

I guess I was loving the coffee because by the end of our meal, I had downed almost four cups of coffee! Whew, I knew I was going to be jittery today (with an overactive bladder).

Overall, our meal was good, but nothing really impressed me. I found the quality of the food to be that of a typical diner. Even the breadth of the menu wasn't too impressive. I've been to several diners with similarly extensive, if not more, menus. Nevertheless, I suppose DeLuca's gets a lot of attention and praise because it is a historical venue and a staple of Pittsburgh, just like Pamela's Diner.

Anyway, as for any diner, I would come here again if I woke up in the late morning with a hangover after a night of heavy drinking and couldn't will myself to cook my own breakfast/brunch. Just remember to be prepared for a long line and a long wait if you decide to go on a weekend morning. Bring a snack or a sports drink (and a sleeping bag for those who partied a bit too hard the previous night) to tide you over during your wait."}
{"text":"A line long enough to spot miles away, in downtown Pittsburgh. Everyone comes here and lines up for the amazing food that Deluca's serves. 

We didn't want to wait for hours, so we called and got the food picked up. There was still a bit of wait, but nothing compared to standing in line. We got the food, and ate them in the car. 

I would always lower my expectations about half a Yelp star for take outs, simply because it takes away the whole \"display food on plate\" and \"serving it glamorously to the customers\" thing. And also, food in a box doesn't always taste amazing. Surprisingly, everything we ordered was bomb. The portions were massive, and they were simply satisfying, perfect brunch material food. Only thing that went wrong was, they messed up our order."}
{"text":"We stopped by around Sunday afternoon before the pirates game.We sat at the counter,and I had the cheeseburger omelette which was wasn't on the menu,but they still managed to cook it up.My friend had the 6 egg omelette with the works inside of it.I was visiting from NYC and this spot was on top of the list,and it lived up to the hyped."}
{"text":"Love Deluca's for a good weekend brunch spot!  Their menu is huge and there is definitely something for everyone, even if they want lunch.  Even though the restaurant is large, it is always packed and there is always a line.  The good news is, they get people in and out fast so the line moves pretty quickly.  The experience is always a bit hectic but the food makes it worth it. The portions at Deluca's are huge and so far everything I've tasted has been delicious.  My boyfriend makes sure to always order the cinnamon roll pancake which is a pancake with cinnamon and frosting glaze on it and it's amazingggg! I don't think you'll be disappointed with anything on the menu! Come for a fun and delicious breakfast in the strip district.  Also don't forget that it is CASH ONLY!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed this place a lot with a friend of mine. We are both visiting from out of state. We couldn't decide between this one and another restaurant around the corner but this had more unique selections.

It was a quit turn around, seated, served, eat, and out. They were vey efficient and obviously have been opened for a while. It was all cash only though so I hope they will get with the times soon. I would've ordered more food if I could've used my card but alas I only had $10. 

I ordered the apple cinnamon bun crepe. It was a good decision! So good. It had ricotta cheese melted in it and whipped cream on top. It was delicious and full of sugar so be warned. My friend got an omelet and she also loved it. The portions are big. Everything looked delicious around us too.

I enjoyed the venue, it was packed but not cramped. Old feeling but clean. It was a diner, so don't expect anything crazy. Will be back one day to try the other foods."}
{"text":"I have eaten at DeLuca's in the Strip District so I was anxious to try this location. I was meeting a friend for lunch. When I saw that they had Biscuits and Gravy on the menu I was totally psyched!!  When they arrived at the table the wind blew out of my sails. The \"sausage\" was pink. YUCK! It was room temperature. One of biscuits was hard as a rock.  I was completely disappointed. 
My friend ordered fried chicken tenders and fries. Her looked delicious and she enjoyed it.   
Since it's Deluca's I will give them a second chance but I will definitely order something different."}
{"text":"We stopped at Pittsburgh specifically to eat here on our way to NY.  And it's worth the detour! Love the food! It's ridiculously delicious! No wonder there were people on line waiting for a table. I got the country chicken with biscuits and gravy, eggs and home fries, and man oh man, they would make a killin' in NY! I also tasted the banana pancake. DeLuca did not disappoint, not one iota. Service is fast and courteous as well. A must for everyone!!!"}
{"text":"Five stars in MY book. First of all it is very hard to find a diner where I can sit and eat in downtown Pittsburgh. So the FACT that I walked thirty minutes away from my hotel to come here and they did not disappoint is mind blowing.
Now,  Let me take a moment to thank the other Yelpers that has viewed this place because of you guys I am fulfilled. 
Now back to this spot. It was a great experience. I was recognized immediately once I walked in nd everything my waitress offered was delicious. I orderd the Steel City Breakfast of Champs breakfast and it was soooooo good. Not to mention I got my money worth. I feel great and satisfied. They were very attentive with my order and I appreciated the conversation. Hey told m the history of the place as well as knowing this is cash only place.I really enjoyed myself. I recommend his place to anyone looking for More than coffee and McDonald's or burger king or bagels."}
{"text":"There are always disputes among fans of Deluca's, Pamela's, and the rest.  This is my favorite all around breakfast place based on my enjoyment of a working man's breakfast, the old greasy spoon, if you will.  I'm talking old school, blue color Pittsburgh style.  A place where one meal can get you through the day, with the help of some antacids of course.  Servings are large, hearty, and filling.  Always enjoyed hitting this place up on a Saturday morning following a late night with friends.  My favorites are the Eggs Benedict on that local Mancini's Italian, the Mixed Grill, and the Cherry Coke's flavored with their own syrup."}
{"text":"This is the best diner breakfast in Pittsburgh. It is always packed but they move people through relatively quickly - not to mention it's well worth the wait! Their omelettes are huge, the food always comes quickly and hot, and the service is always exceptional. 10/10 would recommend."}
{"text":"Just spent 60 bucks for breakfast and it was terrible! Won't never ever be back.... I guess I should have drank the free beer....."}
{"text":"Had to visit this diner on my first trip to Pittsburgh. We waited outside in the rain but it wasn't too long. Inside was so cute and cozy and everyone was so friendly. We were seated in the back away from the hustle and bustle and we were able to enjoy a huge greasy breakfast. Ordered: Western omelette, short stack of cinnamon bun pancakes, blackberry blintzes and a side of bacon. Everything was good, especially the blintzes. The blackberries on the blintzes were ginormous. When we commented on them, the server brought us some even bigger ones on the side. Coffee was excellent, not bitter at all. Liked this place a lot!"}
{"text":"Hometown favorite! Line out the door but table turnover was quick! In-season right now are pumpkin pancakes! Yum!"}
{"text":"Excellent breakfasts in a old fashioned dive atmosphere. Even had a healthier option: Had an excellent frittata with fresh vegetables and cheese. A long wait, but classic large-sized plates full of good food. Affordable to boot."}
{"text":"This is a must for breakfast in the Pittsburgh Strip District! I have never tried them, but they have many kinds of dessert pancakes. Lots of breakfast options. Can be busy - especially on the weekend. Great experiences there!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing! Take your time to read the menu. SO many crazy choices. The portions are huge. Man vs. Food plays on a constant loop on some of the TVs. It's clean. Colorful. Fast service.
The Superbowl is a creative omelet filled with keilbasa, onions, tomatoes, mashed potatoes and is served with a side of sauerkraut and hot apples. Wow!
We will definitely be back.
My only complaints were the wobbly tables (we moved twice) and the freezing cold breeze from an open door in the kitchen."}
{"text":"It was a fun experience. The food was good, hot, and fresh. The staff were somewhat friendly. We got in and out with no wait and our food came in a reasonable amount time. To sum it up, I would try it again."}
{"text":"I recommend arriving at Deluca's early. I came with a group of six at about 8:45, and we were very lucky to be seated within 25 minutes as two tables opened up beside each other. By the time our food arrived, the line extended past the beyond the field of view from inside.

This time I order peanut butter pancakes with scrambled eggs and kielbasa. The eggs were good, and the pancakes and kielbasa were great. I was expecting house pancakes smeared with peanut butter but received pancakes infused with peanut butter flavor; they were soft and fluffy yet concrete in flavor; thus, the pancakes sufficed all of the principles I seeks in pancakes. The kielbasa was crispy; it was well done but not overcooked.

Previously, I've had an omelette and home fries, and I can verify that these dishes are  tasty and generously portioned.

The service was great too. As I mentioned, our larger group was quickly accommodated, our orders were taken promptly, and the food was delivered warm. The staff even offered some witty banter to a member of our group who decided to make an interesting choice for his breakfast."}
{"text":"I love food! I think for the most part everyone on Yelp does. This is why I wake up in the morning, this is what we all have in common, and this is why I would wait on a line for 45 minutes, for good food. The local people outside waiting like us said this place is amazing. The couple being older told us about all the local spots, but insisted we picked the right one. They also mentioned Deluca's was featured in \"Jack Reacher\" and on \"Man vs. Food\". There are other famous people that dined here, but I don't have the time to name them all. When we finally got inside we had to wait to be seated. There were empty tables but the staff moved slow. I was surprised by that, but not everyone moves like a New Yorker. My brother asked if they could hurry up and seat us but the waitress was rude and kept walking. I didn't worry about it as we were seated next. When I walked to my seat I noticed a plaque which stated \"Tom Cruise\" sat here. Oh boy, now I felt like I was lucky. The rude waitress ended up being our  server, how's that for Irony. She was still rude but it was ok, I am here to eat! They had so much food already cooked the wait wasn't that bad. When my meal finally came I had to wait because the waitress forgot my bacon. But when it arrived I dug right in. I am running out of words to use to describe incredible food. This breakfast was by far the best meal I have ever eaten. Words can't be put together the right way to explain the full measure on how amazing this meal was. I have no negative other then the packaged butter being to hard. I am so annoyed with finding these gems and not having them in New York. If I come to Pittsburgh again this will be my number one breakfast stop. I just need to bring a bigger pair of jeans."}
{"text":"Service was very slow. Waitress was yelling across the restaurant to other employees drawing attention to a mishap that customers need not know anything about. It took nearly 45 minutes before we were seen again to place our order. I had the MOAB. The burrito had nearly half of an uncooked onion in it. Along with an entire steamed tomato. The kitchen was not busy as they are in plain view so that isn't a reason for this poor culinary mistake. My wife ordered a sandwich and was given a wrap. All in all I am disappointed in my experience at delucas because people always speak so highly of it. I don't recommend going to this location. Stick to the strip district delucas."}
{"text":"We were going to be down in the strip so we thought we would try this place since I have heard so much about it. Just in case you forgot, the parking in the strip is terrible to say the least. We got there about 9:00 am. Sunday morning. The line was out the door and down the street. It took us about 30 minutes to get a seat. The portions were large and if you wanted huge portions, they had those options on the menu too. The sausage biscuit and gravy was lacking the sausage. There was only two small crumbles of sausage. The lobster bisque was lacking substance too. The taste was really good except that the few  pieces of seafood that were in it, were smaller than a grain of rice. I expected more. Our silverware was sad looking. I had to straighten my fork so all the prongs were even. It just seems like they are so busy that they quit caring about the quality. I don't know how this restaurant has been here so long and is still this busy."}
{"text":"I'm never too impressed with this diner. It's okay, but really nothing special. I ordered this grilled veggie and egg breakfast, assuming it would be a breakfast bowl kind of thing. As it turned out, it was a giant plate of mushy, unseasoned vegetables (90% of that being onion) with a little pile of eggs on top. The eggs weren't even beaten before they were cooked because they were full of visible whites. Biscuits were ok. I've had regular eggs, potatoes & toast before which was a better experience, so maybe I'll avoid anything besides a classic breakfast from now on."}
{"text":"I frequently stop at DeLuca's for breakfast. This visit, I opted to try a lunch item. I was not disappointed!! I ordered this club sandwich- the bread was thick and there was plenty of turkey and bacon. F you're going during breakfast hours, especially on the weekend, be prepared to wait. The wait is definitely worth it. I highly recommend the Steel City Breakfast of Champs"}
{"text":"I was extremely excited to come to Deluca's for a morning breakfast.  After seeing it on Man vs Food and hearing that it is one of Pittsburgh's best places for breakfast, how can I not be excited.  However, leaving the bustling breakfast place, I found myself very disappointed.

I did my research before I came here.  My mother and I only had one more day together before I went back to school, and I wanted the meal to be great.  I knew what I wanted to order before I even opened the front door to the place: the Seafood Omelette.

I made this decision based mostly off of my love for seafood and avocado.  However, when I got the dish, I was saddened

To start off with, there were only 3 little slivers of avocado spaced on top of the massive omelette.  You would think for the $13 I would get a little more, but I let it go.  I then started eating the omelette.  My first bite was shrimp; then, my next bite was shrimp; then, my next bite was once again, you guessed it, shrimp.  After I was done eating, I recalled only tasted one bite of crab.  Never did my taste buds or my eyes even see any lobster.  Very Very disappointing for the most expensive omelette on the menu.

Also, the restaurant messed up my order and gave me hash browns when I wanted the tomatoes.  The hash browns were not good at all either.  My mother and I didn't even eat either side order (which is really rare that we don't eat something).  Finally, when the waitress set down my plate she said, \"Oh, I will be right back with your toast.\"  Well, she never came back.  When she did, she was apologetic, but my mother and I had already finished our meals.  


In the place's defense, the omelette was good, but it just was not what anyone should expect from one of the most expensive items on the menu; especially when there is suppose to be lobster and crab inside.  My mothers Eggs Benedict was also very good, so no complaints with her meal, except the bad hash browns.

Like I told my mom, the 3 star rating means that I would go back and eat, but I would defiantly try somewhere else in the area before I go back."}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast spot in the city! Get there early on weekends to beat the crowd. Even if there is a line, it usually moves pretty fast. Coffee is hot and food options are endless. We have tried it all from omelets to French toast to burgers to crepes to pancakes. Everything we have ever eaten there has been delicious! Prices are extremely fair too. This place runs like a well oiled machine...and we can't get enough!"}
{"text":"The hype is real. Yes the line is worth it. Get the chicken and waffles. It's a big, thin boneless breast of chicken perfectly cooked with plenty of delicious coating. Then it sits on top of a perfectly crisp waffle with a delicate sweet inside. The only chicken and waffles to surpass it is at Screen Door in Portland, Oregon."}
{"text":"Great food, great service and free beer! Seriously though, the best breakfast spot in Robinson!"}
{"text":"We got there early on Sunday morning,  7:15am.  Because the line for this hot spot is insane on the weekends. 

Rightly so. Because even its breakfast proper you're not  interested in eating again until the dinner bell. 

Atmosphere is diner loud. Employees are focused, happy and active participants regarding service and quality of experience. 

The crepes are fabulous, we the apple and the lingonberry. Both generous, sweet and flavorful. Side of bacon is FOUR slices. 

The men had ginormous combos. They raved over the pancakes. But there was also eggs, hash browns, toast and breakfast meat...  a LOT of food. 

If you haven't eaten here, do it.  That impossibly long line isn't for nothing. 

Great eats. Great service."}
{"text":"Unique vibe. Nice food with reasonable price. A lot of food options for brunch including toasts, omelettes, pancakes, waffles, burgers, and many more. If you are in the Strip District and want to try out a decent brunch place with Pittsburgh's unique vibe, this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Seems like a great place to go for a hangover, but I wasn't very impressed.  We went late morning on a Saturday, so naturally there was a huge line.  The atmosphere was fun, like your typical popular, greasy spoon.  The food was just average...spicy, greasy, make you run for the bathroom, gut-busting, giant menu, heart attack-inducing joint."}
{"text":"Came here probably too late on a Saturday morning, and had to stand in the line out the door for maybe 30-40 minutes? (I have no concept of time, but it was a while). The man inside had said the wait would be about 15 minutes which was pretty much BS but I am glad to say it was worth it! Service was quick but not personal (those servers had zero time to chitchat, all running around like chickens with their heads cut off). The coffee was great and refilled regularly, and my boyfriend and I split the Californian omelette and chocolate chip pancakes. We ate it all and loved it! It was all perfectly portioned and we left feeling full but not disgusting. The pancakes were really special, and for those who love to over-indulge, their menu has a ton of ridiculous pancake options. Loved the vintage diner vibe but did not get the movie reference throughout.

WOAAAH I almost forgot to mention the best part! The omelette came with probably the most AMAZING sauce in the world. My boyfriend really proved his worth when he asked if we could have more on the side, and were given an entire freaking bowl of this dream sauce. Amazing stuff, it really was all in the sauce."}
{"text":"this place was one of my favorite diners ever. really friendly wait staff was a highlight.  there was a line friday midday, but it moved pretty fast, scared to think how long the line is on sat or sun. I got the Texmex omlette which had just a great balance of spice and flavors and was super filling. pancakes looked real good also. great representation of great Pitt dining."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a late breakfast and to shop the Strip. Not to be disappointed. We sat at the counter, and our drinks were immediately served. I had an egg & cheese sandwich with lettuce, tomato and onion on lightly grilled Italian bread with a side of homefries. My guy ordered his usual softly scrambled eggs, bacon and homefries. 
My coffee was pleasantly filled by attentive employees. The homefries unfortunately were cold but the quickly rectified. The bathrooms?  OMG. Remodeled!  Nicely redone and that was truly a shockeroo. Very nice. Sae a little placard ib the counter indicating the Yankees may soon be updated too. Wowee

Our fav free parking spots are now fenced off so we used the on street parking kiosk. Not bad. $3 for two hours. 

Everyone knows that this is THE breakfast spot in the Burg. Keep going because it's always good."}
{"text":"Rocked the chocolate chip pancakes with chocolate ice cream on top and split the huevos rancheros. Delicious! Very good food and loved the coffee. 
Unfortunately, my concern wasn't for the food, but my self esteem, as the server was both intimidating and aggressive. She kept the coffee full, but my soul empty. In her eyes was a contempt that few humans truly possess and I must admit a weight was lifted from my shoulders when I left the place. Let the PSTD begin."}
{"text":"While waiting for a table I said \"This better be the best breakfast ever.\" The man in front of me said it was a very delicious breakfast. It definitely was! I had the calfornia eggs benedict, hubby had the original benedict, and THEN we ordered the strawberry fields. I know what you are thinking...

It was a LOT of food but we didn't finish it all. The eggs benedict were some of the best I've had. Spinach, tomatoes, cheese...yum. Potatoes were also great. Hubby really liked these.

The strawberry fields was OMG good. It was a lot of flavors for me but hubby loved it. I would have just been fine with a chocolate chip pancake and called it a day. lol. It had fudge, strawberry ice cream, chocolate chip pancake, and strawberries..oh and whipped cream. After that meal, we didn't eat for hours...

It was featured on man vs food for a reason!"}
{"text":"Took my third trip to Deluca's Restaurant in the Strip District (been to the new Robinson location several times).  Eating here never gets old!! 

Ate at the counter for the first time. It was fun to watch the kitchen work.  Really makes you appreciate the cooks and the food when you see how hard and fast they are working.  I ordered \"THE CALIFORNIA\" omelette, it is quickly becoming my favorite.  It's an omelette loaded with avocado, tomatoes, spinach, sweet roasted red peppers, pesto chicken, and swiss cheese.  The ingredients are very fresh and not as heavy since it's essentially meatless.

They move their customers in and out at a quick pace.  Don't be intimidated by the line. Service is fast and efficient!"}
{"text":"I've been here 3-4 times since it opened. I usually enjoy eating here more than the original in the Strip District. There's typically not a huge line or long wait at this location. Worth it to avoid touristy-nonsense and try the exact same food. They have always got me right in and right out. Food never disappoints! 

The Californian omelette is amazing! It's one of my favorites... with Chipotle Pesto Chicken, Asiago Cheese, Tomatoes, Avocado, Roasted Red Peppers & Spinach. Delicious. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"This place is beyond incredible. The environment, the coffee, the service, the pancakes, the amazing breakfast potatoes with bits of semi-burnt crispiness.

Go. Now."}
{"text":"Well worth the 20 minute wait!  I had the caramel apple crepes and a side of hot sausage (which, yes, is SMOKING HOT)....the service was about what you'd expect for a crazy-busy Saturday morning, but everything was on point.  Can't wait for my next trip!"}
{"text":"My PIC (Partner In Cuisine) and I went down to the Strip District one very warm Saturday morning on a whim.  We didn't know where or what we wanted to eat and down there, there are more than a few options to pick from.  Dizzy from all of the choices (and perhaps low blood sugar), we walked past Deluca's.  My PIC commented on the fact that he heard that place was \"good\" and it was featured on the Food Network.  He had me at \"good\" (granted, I don't watch Food Network).  Anywho, apparently we got there at just the right time between breakfast and lunch because we got seated immediately.  We were greeted by a detached if not surly waiter.  He was efficient in taking our orders and getting our food.  Unfortunately, we never saw him again after that (except to get our bill of course).  

Despite the mediocre service, the food iteself was excellent.  The true diner menu, with its seemingly hundreds of selections, had a breakfast highlight as all diners do.  My PIC and I happily obliged the menu and ordered two different breakfasts.  I got the biscuits and sausage gravy and he got a breakfast with gigantic pancakes.  The portions were huge and the food was tasty.  The people next to us had breakfast burritos that made our breakfasts look puny in comparison.  Or maybe it was me being star struck by the \"Tom Cruise's ass was here\" plaque.  We agreed that our next trip would include those (burritos, not Tom Cruise). 

Unfortunately, the last time my PIC and I tried to go to Deluca's, there was a line around the block.  We didn't feel like waiting, so we went elsewhere.  I do have to say though, that I wish we had waited in line for Deluca's instead of going \"elsewhere\".  That's a regret I will take to my grave.  Just wait in line at Deluca's.  It's worth it."}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast place in the Strip! The wait is long, the dinning room may not always look spotless, but the food has always been worth every penny.

The pecan pancakes come with a hearty amount of pecans, and the bacon medium thickness and full of juices! 

Tip, they take cash only, and the restrooms are not handicap assessable (down a flight of narrow stairs - olde building)."}
{"text":"Deluca's you little famous gem you, so coveted that your loyal patrons and out of towners wind around the door and and down street for breakfast. What is to say that cannot already be said....

I've eaten here a couple of times, I loved the bacon it was thicker cut, plenty of it they definitely do not do wimpy portions here. This is an arggh meat and potatoes and off to work the railroad or steel mill type joint. 

I do not love their home fries or has browns, whichever they are kind of flavorless, I also did not love their huevos rancheros idea ~ why put it on the menu if it doesn't have the right beans or any beans? There are other menu options which are ok but not much diversity on the menu. Seating is tight and tiny it gets very sweaty in the summer. 

Cash only.... so be ready with a fistful of green (naw you won't really need a fistful prices are actually pretty moderate here."}
{"text":"We wanted to go to the original Deluca's but this was on our way out of town. Kind of a cool retro diner with good food. We ended up splitting the seafood omelet which was plenty for the two of us. To be honest the omelet was solid but nothing amazing. 

I think if you're looking for a place to have a good breakfast this is as good as any. I think I might have to try some other items on the menu to bump up this original rating.. One more reason to head back to Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"About a 4.5 or so... I went to DeLuca's because I saw it on MvF and I was in the area for a baseball game. I wound up getting the 2 pound breakfast burrito with bacon - I must say, I highly recommend it. The bacon at DeLuca's is VERY good, and every bit of the burrito was great. $10 may seem pretty pricey, but you get two pounds of it, and it will certainly fill you up for awhile."}
{"text":"This review was brought to you by the letter P.  P is for patience and I hope you have some if you're choosing DeLuca's.

My friends alerted me to the fact that they've never been to the Pittsburgh staple, DeLuca's.  So after a rough previous day/night we decided we'd venture down to the Strip and get our fill on diner breakfast at noon on a Sunday.  The line out of the door didn't sway our choice.  We were in it for the long haul and what else can you expect, it was a beautiful Sunday and people were hungry.  The four of us waited probably 20 minutes to get in and by this time we were very hungry and in desperate need of caffeine.  

The first \"problem\" with DeLuca's is that their menu is too expansive.  Some would view this as a problem, myself included in that I have too much of a hard time deciding what I want to shove down my gullet.  The waitress, a nice enough lady, swung by after a few minutes to get our drink orders.  A round of water and coffee please.  The drinks arrived soon there after and we finally figured out what we'd have to eat.  The place was packed so expected to wait a bit for our food and we did probably another 20-30 minutes, which was fine.  However, after finishing our coffees we weren't pleased with having to wait and wait for fill ups.  As a former waiter this is a red x with me and coupled with the black grease encased around some of my homefries knocked this heavy weight in the Pittsburgh food scene down a peg.  

I enjoyed my meal though and it was definitely a huge portion as were all my buddy's.  The fried chicken and biscuits with gravy, homefries, and eggs was exactly what I needed after a long day of brew festing and staying up way later than I am used to.  The chicken was fried very well, moist on the inside, crispy exterior even with the gravy.  Eggs were over easy as I ordered.  The biscuits were warm and tasted homemade.  And aside from a few homefries swimming in black grease from the griddle were exactly what you want in a homefry.  Some crisp with that griddle fried skin and some mushy.  

DeLuca's doesn't need any help from Yelp and won't go out of business because of this review or any other review, it's a giant because of their portions, location, and history so go if you're patient and have a hunger for something greasy."}
{"text":"It's breakfast what is anyone really looking for from a greasy spoon? I had the omelette with bacon, cheese and veggies. It was great. Maybe too much cheese.  But whatever it's breakfast. I say wait in line and get your breakfast. And don't bitch about the service for God's sake it's breakfast not a gourmet meal."}
{"text":"We went there today and it was closed.  The posted hours state they are open until 9 but the manager told everyone who wanted to eat there (about 10 or 12 of us) that due to lack of business that they close at 3.  Maybe you should change your hours on here.  He wouldn't let us talk to the owner.  Lack of business?  People kept parking, walking in the door and being turned away.  We got there before 3."}
{"text":"Outstanding breakfast. There will probably be a line, it's very worthwhile though. It's in the \"strip district\" near downtown. A wonderful area to walk around and explore."}
{"text":"Always great service and amazing food. It's nice they take cards here. Sitting at the counter is always the easiest and quickest way to get a seat on a busy weekend morning"}
{"text":"I was in town for a wedding and did not get a chance to check out the food scene too much.  I did take the time to check out 2 restaurants that were on the Travel Channel.  This place was one of the 2 that I saw.

Food was great and so was the service.  I guess my only complaint would be the tight quarters.  I will definitely be back for their amazing breakfast!"}
{"text":"Only 2/5 because you can't just order a side of eggs and bacon. My waitress said you have to get the whole meal for ~$8.50.  I think it also comes with home fries and toast, but she was rattling things off so fast I'm not quite sure. They weren't even busy yet. Seems odd to me for a diner not to have separate sides. 

Aside from that I got the pumpkin pie crepe which was great!

Overall, it's too expensive. The bill was $21.00 for eggs, bacon, and a filled crepe.  I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"The spot for your morning fuel in the Strip! It ain't fancy and they don't care if you are! The food is always fresh and hot, coffee the same, and everything is yummy! Terrific and HUGE omelette - try the Spanish with salsa! Great stuff - there's a reason the place is usually packed, and a reason all the folks are smiling. Great chow! Get it here! (Oh...and take cash only!)"}
{"text":"We chose to do breakfast at DeLuca's because their website intrigued us.  Their decor was outer space themed and their menu was huge. Upon arrival we were greeted by friendly staff and were seated immediately. We all had a hard time deciding what to order because their menu was so large. I ordered the breakfast burrito and per my usual requested that certain items be omitted. This was the only time in my life I will admit that I shouldn't have done that!  I was envious as I saw everyone else's burrito come out because mine was plain and boring. Overall, my party agreed the food was good but nothing to write home about. The portions are enormous though so prepare yourself. When we left, the line waiting for a table was quite long. DeLuca's was a good, quick breakfast but not somewhere I'd go regularly."}
{"text":"Now for the conclusion of my Deluca's adventure...



                      Insomnia, Daylight Savings Time, The Devil, and I

\"Springing Forward,\" a lack of Kay around (she was visiting relatives out of town for the weekend), and a looming Monday morn cursed me with a fitful night of near-sleeplessness. There was however a brief, tortured dreamtime interlude in which I had a second encounter with The Adversary, he who caused me to gorge and involuntarily purge at Burgatory over 2 years ago...

              Delusions of Grandeur, The Great Beast, and Growling, Animate Grub

 From a ring of black smoke, The Adversary  introduced me to The MOAB, the MUTHA of all Burritos, and there is nothing maternal about it. The Fallen Angel and his emissary of stuffed tortilla belitted me, spat at me, and became intangible when I attempted to thrash them. \"You'll never finish it,\" The Adversary derisively shouted, his voice sounding like broken glass as the lumpen ogre that is the MOAB uttered gutteral, gutter epithets.

                                         Destroy My Digestive System At Dawn

My skin clammy, and my stomach somewhat queasy, I foolishly leapt from my bed, washed up, dressed and headed to The Strip to defeat a burrito. I arrived ten minutes early and waited patiently to enter. Once I did, however, MOAB and The Adversary decided to play mindgames with me, telling me that I could get my hands on either of them IF I bested both an omelet and a dessert pancake. It would be a handicap match with a stipulation too gratifying to resist. 

\"In this corner, weighing in at a combined weight of err...several pounds, and seconded by The Adversary and MUTHA of All Burritos, the team of Captain Drew's Seafood Omelet and The Funky Monkey Pancakes.\"

The crowd jeered, eagerly awaiting the arrival of the hero...

*Entrance music*

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uu4emT6btH4

\"Coming to the ring and weighing in at 210 pounds, he is Proletarian Steel, ladies and gentleman, Darren W!\" 

The crowd stands and collectively roar like a turbine. 10,000 feet meet the arena floor, making the sound of a marching army. The pancake dish is a tower of terror constructed from 3 chocolate-chip banana pancakes, whipped cream, hot fudge, and golden vanilla ice cream, and it attacked first, punishing me with carbohydrates, sludgy cocoa, cream, and frozen dairy products. As I was halfway finished with it, in came Captain Drew's Seafood Omelet to blindside me. Topped with avocado chunks, a buttery Hollandaise (one of the better Hollaindaise sauces I've had at area restaurants) and suffused with garlic sauteed Langostinos, lump crabmeat, phat-ass shrimp, and an Asiago/Swiss cheese blend, the newspaper-roll omelete threatened to engulf me in eggy, yellow oblivion, yet I munched and chomped my way to victory, hitting Captain Drew with a quick spear to get the pinfall while Funky Monkey was dumped outside of the ring via a fireman's carry. 

Those pancakes however...

Perhaps it was that I was running out of time or that the ice cream was heavy and rich enough on its own, but I was only able to eat 2/3 of it. Call it a non-contest after The Adversary and MOAB interfered and TV time expired, but not being able to fight them all off, I was quadruple-teamed, taking The Adversary's cane in the stomach along with several splashes. The Adversary and MOAB would then \"cut a promo\" promising to clog and crush my \"working-class chump heart\" as I was carried away by officials. 

\"You did good,\" said my spry, affable, and conscientous waitress (she reheated my sourdough toast when it had gotten cold). \"Most people would never be able to eat all that food.\" 

\"Eh, I wish I hadn't,\" I told her. \"It was real good, though.\"

But I'll be back. I've a vendetta on my shoulders."}
{"text":"Weeks ago, something deep in my subconscious told me to stop in this new DeLuca's restaurant to end an unfinished grudge while returning home from a doctor's appointment. 

As icy gales of illwill  ripped across Western Pennsylvania, The Adversary contemplated his next, ultimate assault, conferring with MOAB, The Mutha of All Burritos while reflecting on past encounters at two Burgatory satellites and the original Strip District DeLuca's. . .

\"In this new Robinson locale, I shall crush Proletarian Steel forever more! What say you, burrito?\" The Adversary asked his hulking, simple-minded, single-minded champion.

\"MOAB izzz constipation. MOAB izzz indigestion. MOAB izzz heartburn. MOAB izzz doooooommmm!!!\" The creature of chorizo, eggs, hot peppers, tomatoes, onions, avocado, cheddar, and homefries uttered, sounding like a trash compactor. A chile sauce of DeLuca's own making that was both saccharine and piquant bled a Satanic crimson all over MOAB's doughy, pale body as the Adversary cackled into the killing frost. Gazing into his magic mirror, The Adversary could see Kay and I en route to Pittsburgh from a doctor's visit in Chippewa. 

\"They're coming,\" The Adversary, clad in a coal-black suit, tie, and fedora, mentioned to MOAB. 

\"This Darren fellow, he barely lasted against the titanic tandem of Captain Drew's Seafood Omelet and the Funky Monkey Pancake stack. MOAB, you may be enough to finish him.\"

As Kay and I entered the 50's sci-fi themed diner, taking in the galactic, Atomic Age murals that adorned the interiors along with the silver and red motif of the furniture. 

The Adversary appeared without warning amidst a cloud of inky smoke. 

\"This shall be our final meeting, our last duel, a dance...to the death!!!\"

Kay was immediately subdued by hooded figures. 

\"Your love shall watch you perish,\" the funereal man warned. \"Ah, the rings of Saturn...they are so appropriate. This will be my hour of cosmic evil! Attack, my minion!!!\" 

MOAB charged. Howling and snorting like a gigantic prehistoric boar, it knocked me to the cruel floor. Patrons gasped, fleeing in panic! 

Once I regathered my strength and wits, I both blinded and suffocated the behemoth with packets of sour cream, taming its heat. When it hunched over, I leapt upon MOAB's back with gleaming utensils and plunged them into the beast's body as a matador would a bull. Proteins, starches, vegetables, dairy products, and grains would fly about the eatery turned gladiatorial arena. Within 15 minutes, MOAB was gone, and I belched in victory. 

\"What else ya got, Scratch?\" I asked. 

Stammering, the Adverary replied. \"An insurance policy...\"

The Funky Monkey Sundae arose from a trap door. 

\"Ha. Its big brother, the pancake stack, musta chickened out considering I pretty much whupped him.\" I said with a confident air. 

Cursing, The Adversary, ordered the sundae to charge me with the point of a clawed finger. A carnal chimera of chocolate ice cream, bananas, whipped cream, peanut butter, and caramel slithered forward to meet its destiny. Ice cream headaches nothwithstanding, the glass dish would be emptied, and the salty, sugary, creamy dessert would be overcome. 

Steam shooting from his nostrils, The Adversary telekinetically hurled planets at me with waves of his ghastly, skeletal hands. While I dodged the large constructs that had been thrown my way, Kay would use judo to toss both hooded henchmen into the Slim Onyx Count, ruining his concentration. An uppercut and a right cross would dispatch The Adversary's flunkies while a spinning backfist would put the magical mastermind onto his back. 

\"This had not ended!!!\" the Adversary screamed in a rage with a nose bleeding tar.

\"I've got an insurance policy of my own,\" I told my fiendish foe. 

\"No! NOOO!!!\"\"

From out of my back pocket I pulled a small seltzer bottle full of Sprite that had been blessed by a priest and sprayed its full contents directly onto The Adversary's accursed face. 

Soon, there was nothing left of him but an empty hat. His pair of lackeys would simply melt into pools of infernal, tacky goo. 

\"Whaddya think, Baby Doll?\" I asked Kay as I placed the fedora onto my bald head.

\"You rock that well, Sexyman. What a trophy!\" Kay answered.

\"Nah, YOU'RE my trophy, \" I said as I pulled Kay towards me and kissed her. 

The gray skies gave way to sun. Birds chirped. The winds died. The air warmed. Customers cheered.  A choir sang. 


                                  THE END


P.S. The food and service were exemplary on all fronts. Don't be a palooka. Hit up DeLucas!"}
{"text":"Great food that comes out quickly and in huge portions. Service is just okay, last visit I was charged for a couple things I ordered but never reached the table and they only take cash here."}
{"text":"Nice place in strip district. We had California and seafood Benedict, which are ok, but I was a little bit disappointed because I'm a big fun of egg Benedict and it is not as good as I expected. The onion rings are great."}
{"text":"Amazing food!!  The friendliest staff extremely fast service. If you are ever in Pittsburgh DeLucas is a must! The best food in the tristate area and then some. Super large portions for good prices. Cash only. Breakfast and lunch. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I came here with great expectations from all the recommendations, and I have to say I am impressed. The short Sunday morning wait was worth it. Ordered the championship breakfast come with eggs, bacon, sausage, potatoes, pancakes, and toast! I didn't touch the toast because everything else was too delicious. The potatoes were probably the best I've ever had. Crispy, yet delicate at the same time and most importantly not to greasy! The bacon was perfectly cooked, as was the sausage. Last but certainly not least, the PANCAKES! They were so amazing and fluffy and delicious. Next time I would be interested to try their specialty pancakes! For two people we got out of there for $24 with tip. Not bad. This place is cool, totally straight up diner! I will be going again!"}
{"text":"So for the past 15 years or so I've eaten the same exact breakfast almost every day.  It's simple and old school

2 eggs over medium
Side of bacon
Dry eye toast 


I travel all the time.  Over the years I've found favorite places to go to each time I'm in the area.  From Newark NJ and VA beach to Kansas City, Denver and everywhere in between. 

NOBODY COOKS A BETTER BREAKFAST THAN DELUCAS.  Nobody."}
{"text":"Stop by and try Deluca's #2.  Yes, Deluca's has opened a new diner in Robinson.  Nice new clean space.  The same delicious food.  We got there just before you had to wait and the place is pretty large, so it is popular.  The mixed grill was delicious..selected the hot sausage, over easy egg and the Mancini's bread that comes with is Oh So Good!

The have a Halloween special on pumpkin pancakes.
Our waitress was on the ball, always there for a refill when needed.

{"text":"Went here on a misty cold Saturday morning with my daughter and friend. We'd heard great things about this place and it lived up to them. Had to wait about 15 minutes for. Table for 3- not bad for a Saturday morning after 9. Coffee was Ok but the food was great. Service really good- kept the coffee full and other glasses as well. I had the MOAB burrito a delicious Blend  of chorizo, eggs, cheese, peppers and Spanish sauce wrapped in a nice warm tortilla . Took mire than half home for later meals!! Friends had californiA eggs Benedict - yummy eggs cheese pesto and guacamole on Italian bread. Blueberry pancakes tasty w whole blueberries not mushy. Will be here again!!'n"}
{"text":"Wife and I where there yesterday for late lunch.
Deluca's is right in the middle of the strip district.
I had the Da Burgh which is a Philly Cheesesteak and I also had fries.
The service was excellent and the waitress was very helpful and friendly.
It has been many years since I have had a really good philly cheesesteak.
This one was among the best I have ever had and the fries where good as well.
I would definitely recommend Deluca's for all your diner needs.
Can not wait too go here for breakfast."}
{"text":"We have been here on our last two stops in Pittsburgh and it is awesome.  The first time I was here was Easter morning and the line was out the door.  The staff was super friendly and fast.  My son had a breakfast burritto with Chicken and it was HUGE and a growing 14 year olds dream breakfast.

This past week end I visited with my daughter as part of our visit to Univeristy of Pitt.  She loved it too.  She had the apple crepe's and gave it a big thumbs up.  I ordered the Pumpkin Pancakes (seasonal offering)  with eggs and sausage and was so very happy.  

The service is amazing.  They are fast!  It's great to sit at the counter and watch the cooks.  Cracked eggs litter the floor.  The atmosphere is fun and has a great local flair.  Worth your time to walk the neighborhood and shop for meats, pasta, seasonings etc.  I will be back next time I am in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Friends and I came here after a good workout at the gym, so we were definitely hungry. We came on a Friday at 1:30pm, so there was no wait and lots of empty tables. You would think that since they weren't busy at all, we would get our water and be able to place our orders in quickly, but that was not the case. We sat there for at least 5 minutes before being asked what we wanted to drink. After we got our water, we had to wait another 10+ minutes for her to come back and take our orders. My friend asked for a diet coke which never came so he asked again and they brought him a regular coke. I ordered the California Benedict and thought overall the taste was good, but I wasn't really a fan of the home fries that came with it. It was more than enough to eat even after the gym, so I brought what I couldn't finish home. One friend ordered the chicken & waffle which he didn't like (thought it was undercooked) and therefore didn't finish and the other ordered eggs, bacon, and home fries, which she thought was okay. I was looking forward to this place, but it didn't live up to expectations so unfortunately I won't be coming back.

{"text":"Oh man...I miss this place. I haven't been here since high school. We used to stop here all the time on highschool field trips to places like the history museum, etc. The pancakes are SO GOOD. Peanut butter cup pancakes! Need I say more? Ahhhhhh!! I usually end up getting strawberry ones though because I think I'd die of diabetes if I ate peanut butter ones. xD"}
{"text":"Yinzers really get fired up for breakfast. Tasted like.... breakfast. The breakfast burrito was solid but the wait was absurd. Unless there's no line will not be back"}
{"text":"Holy huge breakfast batman! We went on a Saturday early afternoon and there was no wait at all. I will admit that the waiter was a little absent minded, forgetting my friend's strawberry jam, but I've worked in food service before and after a long Saturday shift stuff like that happens. To make up for it our food came out quickly...I got the mixed grill with turkey sausage and my lady got the strawberry fields pancakes. Very rarely do we leave food on our plates but there was a little breakfast graveyard at the end of this meal. Everything was superb and we wanted to eat every last bite but it was impossible. 3 of us ate for less than $30 which rocks my socks! I agree Deluca's is a Pittsburgh institution and there is nothing better than breakfast at a diner and walking through a slew of street vendors. Be warned--Cash Only! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Since Pamela's had a ridiculous wait, we came here, which just has a line rather than a system of putting your name down. Much shorter though, so we got breakfast here and it was just what we needed.

I got the corned beef hash, well done/crispy, and was super satisfied. It still looks like the canned hash rather than homemade, but cooked perfectly and there was plenty of food. I didn't even need my toast, which he actually brought much later.

My one negative point was he never checked on our water or coffee. I put my empty coffee cup at the edge of my table, and he walked by briskly a few times with coffee but only served the table he was getting orders from. He was so busy if I missed him while he ran by, I wouldn't see him for a while unless I only paid attention to him. I'd rather eat than stare at a waiter. In the end I didn't get more coffee because it was such a hassle. I guess you can't have everything! And they can't have five stars."}
{"text":"My favorite spot to get breakfast in the city. Line is usually out the door on the weekends resulting in a 15+ minute wait. However, the wait is ALWAYS worth it. Low frill diner food prepared with love. The California Benedict is an Eggs Benedict lover's dream. Really like a lot of the French toast and pancake options as well. Have yet to have something I didn't like."}
{"text":"This place is OK for taste and great for service and portion size. I think the perception is overrated and if folks had to do a blind taste test that this place would not come in as the best breakfast in Pittsburgh.
The menu items are creatively Pittsburgh. The kielbasa omelet is one item that sticks out in my head. I ended up ordering the spinach and feta omelet. It was huge and properly cooked. My wife ordered a corn beef sandwich which also came out as expected. Everything was good and I would definitely go back again, but not so good that I would wait 30 minutes for a table."}
{"text":"We have been going to strip for grocery shopping and notice that there was a line in front of it. We finally tried it today. Yeah, it is a greasy spoon. I don't know if it's very cheap but it's definitely a huge portion. I had a strawberry crepe and my husband had a huevos rancheros. We just moved from Phx to here and we had a better huevos rancheros that is not made out of the can. mine is better but it is very much a diner food."}
{"text":"The breakfast we had was pretty yummy. I had no complaints. The menu was large considering they are not open most of the day. Parking can be a pain. However, if you are in the Strip District, you will like this place. It has a great deal of history. Many people in the area have frequented that diner. Even famous celebrities have eaten at the joint while filming. You will find this to be a trip down memory lane. The place is sort of frozen in time. Somehow the ancient feel works for the space."}
{"text":"I grew up going to the Strip location so I was anxious to try this place out in my neighborhood! We went on Sunday morning and only had to wait about 20 minutes. 

The decor was cute and the inside was much bigger than I expected for being in a strip mall! The food was delicious, just as I would get in the Strip! I had Nutella French toast and my husband had a huge omelet which he was able to take half home! The kids menu was perfect for my son. This is a great family friendly restaurant! We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"great local spot to get a greasy dinner breakfast!"}
{"text":"Our breakfast choices sounded better than they actually tasted and our drinks had a weird odor. All in all, when it comes to breakfast in Pittsburgh, I'm still on the Pamela's side of the fence."}
{"text":"Been here every Sunday for years. Taken every one of my friends and family here and I've never had a complaint. Service and food are unbeatable! Every aspect of their menu is just what you want it too be. The lighter fare is very petite and refreshing. The heavy stick to your bones meals are amazing on a cold rainy day. Lastly, the breakfast pancakes and omelets are without a doubt the most amazing things I've ever eaten!"}
{"text":"Awesome service and awesome food! A line easily grows here on the weekends so the earlier you arrive, the better. We had the veggie grill and the veggie breakfast burrito. Both were fantastic! The veggie grill comes with a huge portion of grilled veggies - they hit the spot. I've heard the eggs Benedict options here are the best in the city. Cash only!"}
{"text":"It's hard to believe that I would get up early on a Saturday morning to stand in line for 45 minutes for the opportunity to have breakfast at a dive.  I mean in the Strip District.  Deluca's is a mighty Pittsburgh tradition.  I get that.  I can see that this place is definitely a Yinzer kind of place.

Service was really great.  I mean it.  I mean, here you are trying to shovel food to starving patrons with achy feet after their long wait.  Think about that, it can't be pleasant.

The menu covers a lot of territory.  But I already knew I was going to be having a Western Omelet.  BJ followed a coworker friends bad advice and got the corned beef hash.  We were expecting the real thing, but I am sure this stuff came straight from a can.  Although it was grilled up really nice.  The home fries were really good.  The wheat toast was the best.  The ham in my omelet was very good.

All in all an interesting experience.  Another surprise, I had to take another shower that day in an attempt to remove the smell of grease from my body.  It's something I will not soon forget.  Did I say that I am a fan?  You can't mess with tradition."}
{"text":"Friend and I came here for 12:45 brunch on a Monday...and the line went out the door. It is SO popular, and you can't make reservations in the morning. But the food was worth the wait. I had the lobster and shrimp eggs benedict and my friend and I split a short stack of the Apples and Cream pancakes. The eggs benedict was amazing - the texture and flavors worked so well together. Also, dipping the amazing bread into the sauce and egg yolks is DEFINITELY the move. Pancakes were out of this world too. Only thing is that the place is really hectic - not very organized, which probably contributes to the long lines. Also, it's cash only (no fear, there's an ATM right next door). Finally, it's like super greasy in there. Like they need better air ventilation or something. The fact that they have an open kitchen means that I left feeling like there was oil on my hair, face, and clothing, which is kind of gross."}
{"text":"Deluca's Diner had amazing food and service to match! I was with a group of 5 people, fresh off the plane from San Francisco, CA and we were hungry for some of Pittsburgh's finest food. Our breakfast was amazing and we were impressed with Pittsburgh's hospitality! Thank you, DeLuca's, see you soon!"}
{"text":"Oh boy- come hungry and leave happy-and full- but not full of diner grease.

Classic diner but serving legitimate food (such as proper thickly cut bacon, non rubbery scrambled eggs, fresh pesto, fluffy pancakes, etc).  Quality surprisingly is not compromised by the giant portions and volume of customers- instead you get creative, fresh options and plenty of variety.

Worth the wait!"}
{"text":"They're very busy, even in the Robinson location, but they have a large, efficient staff that is good at moving people through; you shouldn't have to wait too long.  

The menu is huge and busy, you might consider reading it online before you go,  and though their other food looked good, too, DeLuca's is famous for their breakfasts.  My girlfriend ate the short stack pancakes with a side of bacon, and left plenty for me to finish.  I had the Moab burrito.  My burrito was good, I asked for extra Spanish sauce, but the avocados were so far from ripe that the restaurant should have declined to serve them; they were like hard pieces of cardboard.  I told my server and the checkout girl, but neither seemed overly concerned about the food quality.  That was my only complaint though, and I would return to the restaurant, but next time I'll order pancakes and eggs."}
{"text":"Great portions, good flavor. So many choices on the menu, you could go 100 times and not eat the same thing twice. Cash only"}
{"text":"Yelp reviews sent me in this direction when we were looking for some diner food in the Burgh.  DeLuca's definitely has the diner feel.  It's a lot larger than it looks from the outside.  We got there around 10:30 a.m. on Sunday and were seated within about 15 minutes.  Not bad.  The menu was overwhelming.  So many omelettes! So many options!  I had no idea what to pick.  My friend saw Man v. Food and went for the mixed grill and I designed my own omelette.  The mixed grill was MASSIVE...pounds and pounds of veggies.  My omelette was pretty giant as well.  We ate and ate and barely made dents in our plates.  The food was decent for diner food.  I can't say it was the best I'd ever had but it's definitely a cool place to people watch and you can feel the history there.  The service was fast.  All in all a nice stop to try in the Burgh if you're super hungry."}
{"text":"Ohhhhhh Deluca's.

In my experience, there is a great divide in the city of Pittsburgh, similar to Montagues vs. Capulets.  This divide is Pamela's-lovers vs. Deluca's-lovers.  I am firmly in the latter camp, and I will be pleased to challenge Pamela's patrons to a duel, as long as I have been fueled by a breakfast burrito the size of my head and innumerable rounds of coffee.

Deluca's has quirks: It takes forever to get a table (because everyone's trying to eat there), the ambiance is old-school funky diner (weird mural, propensity for stickiness on the formica tabletop), and you should not expect to be pampered by the waitstaff (they do their job well, for the most part, but the restaurant is always busy, it's not a high-end place, and they aren't going to make enough in tip money off your $10 breakfast to put up with a snotty attitude from their customers).  Personally, I like this in a diner, and it is something I actively seek out.  I like to come here kind of hungover, devour a massive burrito and a huge orange juice and about three cups of coffee when the waitress has time to refill my cup.

My favorite diner is still that diner under the 16th street bridge, which I forget the name of it but it makes kick-ass biscuits and gravy."}
{"text":"This was some seriously good breakfast food. The place is crowded don't get me wrong (granted we only waited like 15 minutes or so to get seated). Those home fries with onions, peppers and cheese were absolutely killer. I got the Californian benedict (not sure if I'll order it again though - might have to go the traditional route next time). We were seated in the back booth, in front of people cooking and everything so it was fun to see all that (albeit a little hard to talk to the 3 people seated next to me). We also had waffles and the nutella crepes (delicious)!

I'll try to get back here soon and try some other stuff and update again."}
{"text":"Saturday morning last weekend we were in Pittsburgh for a Pens game the night before (yay they won!)  And my husband took me to Deluca's on the strip.  We were lucky since there was no line at 830 in the morning and we got a table right away.  Decluca's first impressions are not great.  Considering it as a \"hole in the wall\" joint, the place still needs some serious TLC.  The ceilings look terrible and the walls look like they didnt know what they wanted to do - fix it or otherwise.  I like dives and hole in the walls to eat at, but I still want a complete ceiling up top, not one that looks like its under construction or caving in on me. 

The service is decent.  A small place with lots of tables close to one another, you'll be able to get someone's attention for sure.  However, its the food and the reason why people are there right?  My husband had a Mexican omelet - or the like and I had a corned beef hash plate.  Even with my healthy appetite, I couldn't eat but a third of the food.  He didn't care much for his entree so he actually helped me eat mine.  Even so, there was leftover food.   

There were lots of pancakes and similar items on the menu that looked tempting.  But with portion sizes so big, there was no way for me to even suggest trying to get something in addition to our plates.   I would suggest going there with big appetites and possibly consider sharing!  It's ok and I would consider going back if I don't have to wait in line.  But nothing so amazing that I'd stand outside on a cold winter day to get inside."}
{"text":"Two stars might be generous. We came to DeLucas to get some of the lobster bisque that I love. Alas- this is only a weekend option. Fine.
My husband ordered a coffee, a sandwich, and a side of breakfast ham. He had to ask for the coffee 3x before it finally got there and the ham twice. 
I ordered the fish sandwich with onion rings. Sandwich comes and it's dry and over cooked with four pieces of cold cheese plopped on top. The onion rings came about 5 minutes later and they were squishy and under cooked.
SUPER disappointing, and the worst part is the server has this cocky, careless attitude the whole time. If you get this server, you will know what I'm talking about. I found myself becoming envious of another table that had a friendly and animated waitress.
We were never asked how the food was by our server, the manager who was milling about, or the lady who took our payment. I decided that if I WAS asked, I would have been honest and posted a favorable review if it was addressed. It was not.
You got it wrong, DeLucas. And while people wait for a LONG time for a table here- it wasn't even busy today. And they also seem to forget they have an open kitchen. So when we ask about the missing items and you say \"they're on their way\" but turn around and ask the staff to make them quickly, we hear you.
Two stars because I'll probably be back for the bisque- but for takeout ONLY!"}
{"text":"Still not sure how i feel about this place. While some say that the service is good, our waiter was hostile and scary at times. Yelled at us for not saying our order loud enough. In terms of food, i had an omelet which was good but a bit overcooked. I prefer fluffier eggs, like the ones in Pamela's."}
{"text":"Steelers game day-after brunch! Of course, that was the great idea for everyone in town. Long line in the cold, but for the best breakfast in town? Our group would make it work. We were in a party of 8, and were willing to split into two parties of 4. However, the hostess was able to get us all sitting together! Score!

The place is a pretty authentic diner. Cash only, several tables, booth and counter seating, and an open kitchen so you can smell the bacon and eggs that gets everyone in good spirits. It also has very tight and narrow spaces, so be careful going to your seat! The menu has many, many options, so I just stayed on the first page. I ordered the breakfast burrito with corned beef hash and home fries. And coffee. Coffee is always necessary. Others ordered crepes, benedicts, and the turkey club. The breakfast burrito was as large as my plate, and satisfied my hunger. 

Thankfully, the wait for our food was not as long as the wait outside. Service is efficient, and our coffee and water glasses were never empty.

I'd come here again if I was back in town! It's located in the Strip district with a parking lot close by!"}
{"text":"Good but not the waiting-outside-for-a-table good. Portions are large but very pricey for breakfast. I'm going back to Pamela's."}
{"text":"I like DeLuca's diner. They have a nice selection of food that ranges from breakfast to dinner type food. It's exactly what you'd expect for diner food and the service is pretty great as well."}
{"text":"After finding JoJo's Restaurant boarded up, we ventured over to Deluca's around 1:30pm. The place had certainly died down from the brunch craziness so we were able to be seated immediately. Huge menu = indecisive me however I ordered simple - eggs, meat (chorizo), homefries and toast along with one hotcake and some coffee. The breakfast was delicious with ample portions and for relatively affordable price about 7 bucks then 2 for the hotcake. Server was nice and checked in periodically - the wait staff that we interacted with were all friendly. While Deluca's is a diner and I expect some grease, I felt their floors were a little much as I had to make sure I wasn't sliding when walking out the door. I would come back to Deluca's though would go elsewhere if the line was long. Good but not an hour wait long good."}
{"text":"Never been to the original (it is always a super long line, which probably means  good food).  But, the food is fantastic!  I love the selections and the different choices (kielbasa and crepes).  The service unfortunately, was pretty terrible.  The server reeked of smoke and our food was cold.  We told him and he just kind of ignored us.  If I had to guess, it is a new restaurant and it may take some time to get the kinks out.  I would definitely go back because the food makes up for the poor service."}
{"text":"There's almost no way to give this less than 5 stars. The line is outrageous no matter how early you get here. There's a reason for that! That reason is because it's one of the best breakfast diners you'll ever have the privilege of sitting down at. The good far outweighs the bad, especially since you should already expect lines, and the fact that they only accept cash (which fits in perfectly with the old school diner ambience).

They. Have. The. Best. French. Toast. I. Have. Ever. Tasted. 

Please don't think I'm exaggerating. I try not to do that when it comes to recommendations. I know that it sets people up for huge let downs. But the french toast here is on another level, in my opinion. Maybe I don't get out enough but I've never had such amazing french toast. You have to try it at least once. If you don't agree then I respect that. I'm also a breakfast food lover. I can eat it at all times of day. Please trust me!

Everything I had on my plate was good. I don't have any complaints because I knew exactly what to expect. Service was fast and courteous. It's been far too long since I've been back."}
{"text":"Line at door moved quickly. Tea included two teabags and hot water refills. The Italian omelette was brimming with delicious veggies and meat. Home fries were perfectly crisp and salted. The cinnamon roll pancake topped this meal off for two. Booths were comfy. Service was great. Bathroom had no paper towels or toilet paper. Non working toilet in one of 2 stalls. Long wait for women."}
{"text":"Best breakfast I've had in years. I'm not a carb kind of guy for breakfast so I stuck with a meaty omelet. My family of 6 fell in love and we went here 2 times on our vacation in just 4 days. The coffee and their breakfast sausage was just amazing. We liked them so much we went next door a few stores down and bought the coffee, and a few blocks down we bought 5 pounds of sausage to bring home.

Service was excellent, staff was very pleasant."}
{"text":"DeLuca's is an excessive diner breakfast at its best.  Gigantic omelettes with homemade bulk hot Italian sausage in the perfect wrapping of Yinzer kitsch (seriously, go here on the morning before a Steelers game.  Or at any point during football season.)

I lived here for 5 years, haven't been back for 5, and this is the place I've been craving.  Do yourself a favor, eat here, and don't worry about planning lunch afterwards."}
{"text":"Favorite place for breakfast in the strip. The pancakes are great and you can taste the life of the grill in the food. A must go to place before you die!"}
{"text":"DeLuca's does a relatively expensive breakfast, much like Pamela's and Square Cafe.  The food is good, but, like Pamela's, they don't take credit cards.  If the food was inexpensive, like Ritter's, I could understand this.  But when breakfast rings in at $15?  Pretty much inexcusable not to take plastic."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to get breakfast in pittsburgh! I'm big on breakfast and have been to quite a few places in pittsburgh known for their breakfast and delucas is definitely my favorite! The meals are unique but at the same time have a traditional feel. I have been here a few times and have yet to be disappointed. The only negative is it tends to get very busy and there's not a lot of places to sit."}
{"text":"Best advice for de'lucas is to get there early if you want a weekend breakfast.  We got there at 8am on a Saturday and waited for about 5 minutes.  We did some shopping on the strip and we we passed again at 10 there was a huge line waiting to get in.  Our food was fresh and delicious.   All the toast and French toast is made from fresh Mancini bread.  Pancakes were awesome too.  Service is fast and friendly for how busy they are.  Get here early and make a nice little morning out of it like we did."}
{"text":"CASH ONLY! There's many options of breakfast and lunch. It's a great place for both with friendly staff. I got there famous breakfast burrito which was topped with their special Spanish sauce and a slice of what looked like a kraft single. I had to substitute my meat for chicken since there is a huge chicken on top of the restaurant. While the burrito was good, I wish I could have picked up the burrito to eat instead of having to cut it. Very filling portions!"}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast as always! My husband and I split the MOAB burrito.. The chorizo and Spanish sauce are to die for! Our friends both got the bionic omelet, one added chorizo. It was their first time here and they thoroughly enjoyed it. There was a line out the door when we arrived but it went fast and it was more than worth it. They were super busy, but that made the food fast and fresh :) our one friend feels that the home fries could use more spices, a little more flavor. Our home fries were in our burrito so it made them perfect, but I could see what he means when they're just on the side. My husband was drinking coffee and never had to flag someone down for a refill. The staff was attentive and courteous. We love coming here when we come in town!"}
{"text":"Great menu with plenty of options! There's something for everyone. Love the fact you can see the chefs make your meal.  The hash browns were just like my mom used to make. Looking forward to trying the crepes the next time I'm back"}
{"text":"I love DeLuca's. You know whatever you get will be big, filling, fresh, and delicious. The service is quick and very friendly. The prices are cheap!"}
{"text":"Authentic American breakfast, portions are big , prices are good. Tastes like at home. Would definitely recommend to friends especially for foreigners to try American food. 4.9 our of 5."}
{"text":"I heard rave reviews about this place and was so excited to eat here. We finally got in and the food was greasy and mediocre. I ended up getting me food poisoning and got very sick for the rest of the day afterwards. I will never go back here"}
{"text":"Love diner food! DeLucas steak salad was delicious. Real steak, melted asiago , roasted peppers, sautéed mushrooms and BEER BATTERED onion 
Rings, oh my!  Was so good I did not use the ranch dressing I ordered on it! 
Friendly staff and clean. Important, I am in the food industry also. First time, I will be back. The seafood crepe is calling my name!"}
{"text":"Holy sheet!  That was a phenomenal breakfast!

I had the Funky Monkey - chocolate chip banana hotcakes (i.e. for those less sophisticated people like me that means pancake), vanilla ice cream, and banana, all drizzled in hot fudge and caramel.  The inner fat kid in me will be smiling for months!  The steaming hot pancakes perfectly complimented the cold, creamy vanilla ice cream!

My girlfriend had the Seafood Benedict - lobster and lump crab meat over a thick toasted piece of bread, bathed in hollandaise sauce.  Oh.  My. God!  The second best breakfast dish I have ever had!

We shared a side of bacon - no description necessary other than to say that it was crispy delicious porky perfection!

The wait of 24 minutes from the time we got into line until we sat down at our table flew by.

Service was real good, but they did take a while to bring our bacon.  Seriously, please don't ever  make me wait for bacon... but I was so focused on the rest of the meal that I barely noticed.

Best breakfast in Pittsburgh, indeed!!"}
{"text":"Best place in Pittsburgh for brunch. I had the chicken fried steak with sausage gravy and it was the best sausage gravy I've had in a very long time."}
{"text":"More back-to-back reviews... but this is the dramatic conclusion to my Pittsburgh trip. 

Before heading back to Virginia, we asked the front desk where would be a good restaurant to go for brunch (or lunch, didn't matter). At first the receptionist said First Watch, which we both knew well, considering there's a few locations in Northern Virginia, but when she suggested DeLuca's, only 5 minutes away from the hotel, it was fairly hard to pass up, especially since it is a Pittsburgh only establishment; a nice way to wrap up the weekend festivities. 

When we pulled up to the restaurant, it was clear that this was a popular place, even on a Sunday. Throngs of people were coming and going, and we even had ourselves a 15 minute wait before anything got started. But once we got a table, things got interesting.

The menu has a plethora of everything you would expect for breakfast, brunch, and lunch (the joint closes at 3 pm). I was undecided between the pancakes, French toast, Eggs Benedict, and the Chicken and Waffles. My friend got pancakes and eggs. When it came to my order, I asked our server and she suggested the Chicken and Waffles (which is a PA staple). My meal also came with eggs, which I wanted over medium.

When the food arrived, it came in a lot of plates, and a lot of it on them. The pancakes were HUGE; my friend said they were fluffy and tasty. He liked his eggs. For my dish, the chicken was just okay, I was slightly disappointed, but the waffle was really good. Nice taste and a good complement to the chicken. My eggs were salty and buttery, and I felt it as soon as the meal ended. But I'm happy I got what I got. I can get French toast and pancakes anywhere. Chicken and Waffles are harder to find in Virginia (outside of the chain restaurants). 

The bill was fairly reasonable too. Tell you what, overall, the cost for food in this area is really cheap and reasonable. I can see why people want to move here, the overall cost of living is just fantastic. 

While the experience didn't blow me away (my friend like it), this meal concluded a Pittsburgh weekend I probably won't forget for a while."}
{"text":"Walked in here with my boyfriend and left after 2
Minutes. We were originally seated in the back by the kitchen, and then when I kindly asked if we could sit at another table, our waitress literally threw our menus on the table and walked away. Nobody came to get our drinks and it smelled like B.O. Never returning here again."}
{"text":"My wife had been here before, but it was my first visit. We visited the Robinson location before and wanted to try the original. Surprisingly enough, we only had to wait about 10 minutes on a late Sunday morning around 11:30. They were still busy inside though, but that didn't affect our service. The waitress was attentive and nice to answer all our menu questions (we like to make substitutions). 

We are big coffee drinkers, and once she noticed she couldn't keep up, she brought over a carafe. 

As for the food, the menu is huge. My wife got poached eggs (surprise), and they were cooked perfectly. She also got her raisin toast well done. She had to send it back to have it run through again. When it came back out, it was perfect. The waitress didn't mind, and she even warned her it might come out too dark and didn't want her to be upset. 

I ordered the Greek omelet with grilled chicken. It was pretty big, and had a lot of cheese in it. It tasted really good, my only minor change would be less grease. Something about a greasy omelet usually doesn't sit well with my stomach. But again, it was really good. 

We both got fruit cups instead of potatoes. The fruit wasn't that ripe, and our waitress warned us about that too, but it still wasn't bad. And a better option than the home fries would have been, because I didn't have an hour to go to the bathroom. 

DeLuca's is a Pittsburgh staple everyone has to try at least once.  It really is a perfect greasy diner experience if that's what you are looking for."}
{"text":"Even though the wait is outrageous, the food is delicious and definitely worth it! We sat at the counter to have a shorter wait which we didn't mind. We had the mixed grill, strawberry sundae pancakes and the breakfast burrito. The portions were all huge and very unique. We highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"I am sorry to leave such a sad review for Deluca's Diner but it has to be done.  Based on the reviews and the long line outside, I was expecting some pretty top notch food.  My friend told me that on Sundays the line is a block long outside.  I am not sure what all these people are waiting for, because I could have gone to any diner for the meal I was served.

Two of our meals came out in a timely fashion, but we waited for about 10 minutes (while our meals got cold) for the third entree to reach our table. 

The booth we sat in was very uncomfortable, and the table was too far away from the seats so I had to sit on the edge of my seat the entire time I ate my Huevos Rancheros.  Unfortunately my meal was on par with the seating accommodations.  The chorizo looked like Taco Bell style ground meat and was lacking the spiciness I have come to know from most chorizo I have had.  The rest of my meal looked like a pile of slop on top of the tortillas.  It was served with a side of re-fried beans that was definitely canned, and not fresh.

Sorry I stood in line for this.  I won't be returning."}
{"text":"We got lucky going here! No line. I asked the waitress, I wish I remembered her name, for her favorite meal on the menu. She suggested the fried chicken with sausage gravy. She did not disappoint one bit. Sometimes you eat a meal and say it was good and think it would be better if... not this time taste buds. Everything was spot on! I was so delighted to have zero complaints on such a fantastic meal. I even left my wallet on the table, totally forgot about it. When we were leaving she gave it to us. This was after I gave her a hug and thanked her for one of the best breakfast experiences I've ever had."}
{"text":"I'm not really sure what all the hype is about this place. We read all the raving reviews, watched the appearance of this place on Man vs. Food, and were pumped to go. Maybe our expectations were too high. We waited in line for 45 minutes and our waitress was less than welcoming. She finally came to get our drink order after almost 10 minutes of us being there. We were chatting and the menu is huge, so we didn't know what we wanted to order yet...if looks could kill!!! Our waitress was obviously not happy about that. Once we finally ordered, it took a good 30 minutes for our food and this is how it went: Waitress comes to table, drops off my fiance's food and doesn't say a single word. I sit there with no food, wondering where mine is with no waitress in sight. After 5 minutes, I tell my fiance I appreciate his kindness, but his food is getting cold, so he digs in. 5 more minutes, the waitress finally comes and drops my food off along with the check, never asking if we had everything or needed anything else. We eat our typical diner food (huge portions, though), pay our bill, and never looked back. 

My theory is that the line is so long because it really does take forever just to get any sort of basic service here.

I was also horrified to read the food inspection report, especially seeing that they failed like 3 times before they actually passed. The sad part is, after being there, I wasn't really surprised at all. So if anyone has any good recommendations for Pittsburgh's actual best breakfast at a place with better service that is clean, I would really appreciate that! This just wasn't it for me, but to each their own."}
{"text":"Super good. Worth the wait and excellent speedy service. Breakfast burritos were amazing and coffee stayed full. Bring cash! They are cash only."}
{"text":"Went in with a friend late on a Saturday morning. Coffee had that left on the burner too long, acidy taste. The food, standard breakfast items, was off. Scrambled eggs arrived more like an overdone omelette. Toast was cold. Almost $3 for my friend's glass of OJ was the final insult. So disappointed because I've enjoyed several good meals at deLuca's in the Strip District."}
{"text":"I just love this place ! I like the old styles of restaurants a ton  ! The french toast just melts in my mouth  ! I go here every Saturday and the workers are so friendly also ! Great atmosphere  ! Great breakfast  !"}
{"text":"Delicious breakfast !! We went during the week so we did`t have to wait in line but still very busy I don`t think there was an empty booth, there was a few spots at the counter bar. The staff is very fast and friendly. Had the biscuits and gravy with bacon very very good!!"}
{"text":"So this place was fun atmosphere wise. Fast paced, order, eat and go! 

I got the steak breakfast burrito. The portion size was nice 
but there was so much of the wrong cheese. Maybe some feta or queso 
with some lettuce inside? Just something besides what was on it would go miles.

Servers were fun and talkative which was nice, but some people seemed annoyed by it.

Next time I am in town I will have to try something more classic off the menu."}
{"text":"I cannot believe how many times I've been to this place without being in a food coma. Hands down one of the best brunch place in Pittsburgh. It is strange I waited that long to write them a review. I don't think I've ever gotten anything here I don't enjoy. I always order more than one item, I know I'm a fatty at heart. I always get a sweet stuff such as pancakes or waffles, and a savory entree. I usually got either omelette or egg Benedict. They have a huge selection on breakfast food, they also serve lunch food but I've never tried them before. The only reason I didn't give them a five stars is that they don't take credit cards, and also sometimes the servers are too busy to check on you as often as I wanted to. Other than that, de Lucas never fail to satisfy :) it is a great place to take your friends or out of town visitors. Oh, and it's worth the long wait ;)"}
{"text":"Second time here was excellent! I had another omelet and it completely made up for last time! My omelet last time was dry and not very flavorful. This time my omelet was moist and delicious! I had ham, cheese and tomato inside of it and the home fries were great too! My friend had the cinnamon bun pancakes and loved them! I can't decide if it's better than Pamela's, I think they're both great!"}
{"text":"I had breakfast here and enjoyed it. The large mural rocked. Don't get the burrito, it is weird tasting. I had the eggs Benedict served on fresh mancini's bread. It was great. I only wish that I had ordered 2 plates. The service was meh, but most places in town are that way. Give it a try."}
{"text":"Deluca's is the ideal delicious, greasy spoon breakfast establishment.  It is not quite a diner, but it has that kind of vibe to it.  It's busy and a bit worn, but the menu encompasses a wide variety of breakfast and lunch items that has quite a following in Pittsburgh.  The weekend I went, the line crept out the door just after 10:00 am and was extremely long once my coworker and I got settled into our seats at the counter.

Who even has a legitimate counter space anymore to serve people?

The kitchen separates the two sections of counter seating and this is the heart of Deluca's.  If you can grab a seat there, do it.  From what I have read, this place has been featured on both the Food and Travel Networks and the whole time in which I was eating there, I felt like there should be a show devoted to this place's operation.  It was totally intruiging.  Up above the fryer and griddles was a huge plate of bacon to plate and send out with orders.  Egg shells were discarded wherever was away from a cooking surface and pancakes were shot out with a little dispenser to get them to a big, even size for the griddle.  It was magical.  How this place keeps orders straight, I have no idea.  Papers with orders are all over, but my meal came out correctly and so did my coworker's.  If it ain't broke, don't fix it, right?

Service was extremely amiable even though they were swamped.  From the host to the counter girl, everyone was attentive and kind.  My coffee was literally bottomless--at no point was I sitting waiting for a fill up.  The coffee is not fantastic (a bit bitter) but it hits the spot and considering how many cups you can get in a sitting, it's the only flaw that I found of the place. 

I orderd a short stack (two) of specialty pancakes: pumpkin.  The flavor was ever present without being overwhelming.  I also ordered scrambled eggs and they were pretty good as well.  They were not perfect, a bit moist, and I prefer eggs to be cooked a bit drier.

My coworker had kielbasa and really enjoyed it.  The meat looked so juicy and I regretted not getting some as well since I love that Polish sausage ohsomuch,

Overall, service is prompt and food is delicious.  I'm still thinking about it and would be willing to also wait on that really long line should I ever need to again to get some of that delicious breakfast again.

Oh, and if you're into cramming as much food as possible into you for a low price for breakfast, get one of the breakfast burritos.  They are bigger than your arm and filled with all sorts of good things.  The guy next to me had one and it was unreal."}
{"text":"Very no frills place and exactly what we were looking for!

What we sampled: 
Steel City Breakfast (Eggs with american cheese (I don't even like eggs and these were stellar), Biscuits (yum), hash browns (under seasoned, but good), chocolate chip peanut butter pancakes (enough said ;) ). 
The MOAB (Mother of all burritos is right!  This thing was packed full and delicious!)

Overall the service was good and the food was hearty and reasonably priced.  Just remember to bring cash and an empty stomach!"}
{"text":"Been here twice in the last two months. Their california eggs benedict with chicken is amazing and comes with a large helping of home fries on the side. My friend got the regular french toast once and liked that. Their freshly squeezed OJ is also on point.

The ambience is stereotypically diner but it is endearing. The food came out quickly and the servers are attentive. Definitely a better alternative to Pamela's without being more expensive."}
{"text":"I really can't believe I've never made it here! And I went on the worst possible time too, during the holidays! But the wait wasn't too too bad, even if it was out in the cold for about 15 minutes. Totally worth it once you're warm inside and a hot plate of breakfast food is staring at you!

I'm going to do the thing you shouldn't do but everyone does, compare it to Pamela's. I mean, it's one of the most popular breakfast spots in Pittsburgh, how can I not!? And happily I'd say it was totally on par. Would I say it's better? Probably the same, but for different reasons. 

They looked to have a bigger menu than Pamela's, serving hotcakes (what Pamela's is famous for) and regular pancakes. Although I'm a huge pancake fan and most of the options looked amazing, I really wanted a regular down home eggs, homefires, sausage and toast breakfast.

And with an expanded menu they have so many choices beyond the menu! When I asked for sausage she was like, patty, turkey, hot, veggie... the list went on! I had to hear them twice! My homefries were good, I added onion and pepper to the mix, I just wish they would have been a tad crispier. 

The place really does have it's own identity, with the red vinyl booths and memorabilia on the walls. Service was friendly, but remember they are CASH ONLY!"}
{"text":"Good enough that I've been back 3 times in 4 days within the week I've been here in Pittsburgh. Tried something new each time and never left disappointed!"}
{"text":"This is the quintessential breakfast experience in Pittsburgh! I've been all over the world and eaten at some spectacular place and I can say that Deluca's ranks right up there with then. The service is a 10/10 with the staff that is fast, nice and very thorough. The food is fantastic diner food. I asked the waitress which omelette is the most ordered and the best tasting and without hesitation, she said the 'Deluca Omelette' which is a 4-egg omelette with all the fixin's inside it. WOW!! It was simply unbelievable. The coffee is awesome too!

From now on, this will be a staple for a family visit when we are in Pittsburgh next. Can not wait!"}
{"text":"The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is because there is always a line on the weekends. To their credit, the wait is shorter than you would think for a line that long. But ultimately, that just mean's it has good food. The breakfast is great and prices are very reasonable. I highly recommend it for a weekend brunch."}
{"text":"What can I say..got here and it was very hot outside.
 Thought it was gonna be a long wait but, as the sign said, our line moves fast.  Took 10 minutes to get inside.  Now we let's get to the food.  I had he Pancake Breakfast(includes homefries, eggs, sausage bacon)..daughter had the French Toast breakfast with the same sides..food was well worth the wait.  Service was excellent and I definitely will be going back here again when I go for a Steeler game.  If you are in Pittsburgh, make your way down to Deluca's and enjoy some good food at a very reasonable price).  Would be very wrong if I didn't include the fact that my son(who loves chicken tenders and fries) was very impressed with the quality of his meal as well.  It's the small things like that that makes a place like this excellent for families to eat at."}
{"text":"Wow!  I was impressed.  It was so much fun to have breakfast in this place.  Everything here is home made.  Staffs were friendly, excellent coffee, big pancakes, papas were good too.  We were just excited to find this place in Pittsburg.  Very busy on Monday morning.  I could imagine this place must be crazy during weekends!  It was recommended by a very nice gentleman who manages a parking lot right by the restaurant.  Check out the photos I am posting!  Yes definitely will come back!!!!"}
{"text":"How have I  never been here before, considering that I am a black and gold city yinzer?  Well, this oversight was revised this morning.  I got here about 10 am this morning and totally expected a long line.  We only had to wait about 5 minutes and got a great booth in the back.  If you're in a rush sit at the counter.  Service was friendly, quick and professional.  Place was packed with all types, classes and colors.  Everyone from family's after church to folks like me with disheveled hair wearing the same clothes from  the long night prior.  This offers a true snapshot of the folks of my fine city.  I ordered the corned beef hash and poached eggs with a side of sweet sausage and toast.  The corned beef hash was great charred perfectly and tons of flavor.  The eggs were about average and the sweet sausage was amazing.  They offer a ton of breakfast meat options, everything from chorizo to amish ham and sweet sausage.  My breakfast was a little above average, however my friend made a much better choice.  She ordered the breakfast sandwich, which was great.  It was served on fresh italian bread with mounds of cheese and crispy bacon.  I like Pamelas for pancakes, but for just true good diner breakfast food this is my new favorite."}
{"text":"Nothing to add that hasn't been mentioned by all the other five-star reviewers. My family and I enjoyed a perfect breakfast this morning. And I will add that the peanut butter-banana milkshake was quite possibly the greatest shake I've ever eaten."}
{"text":"The food here was delicious. I got a mushroom, spinach and cheese omelet with breakfast potatoes my fiancé got frenchtoast with bacon. The bacon was crisped to perfection. The service here was not impressive and satisfactory at best. The line was out the door and down the street for over an hour. When we finally got into the building I noticed many empty seats at clean tables and no one sitting people. if the line is that long, there should be someone dedicated to sitting people. The coffee here was okay, I can say I get better coffee from my keurig. We would go here again for the food, but expect poor service."}
{"text":"Breakfast Sat, 10/3/15, 9:30 am
30 minute wait.
Food, not so much.
Place packed.
Bacon rubbery...
If you want big pancake/waffle loaded with \"stuff\"...maybe for you.
But for good eggs/bacon or omelet...wait not worth the wait."}
{"text":"If you want to eat Sunday brunch before 10:00, DeLuca's is one of the few places that can make your dream a reality. Any later and you'll be playing the extended edition of the waiting game in a queue out the door and halfway down the block. What maybe lacks in quality, is made up in quantity with manly meals such as the oh-so-famous Mixed Grill + Toast (Thanks, Adam Richman!) or Steel City Breakfast of Champs to satisfy your sweet & savory soul and then some. The Breakfast Burrito is built for two, but you might be distracted by the half melted American cheese slice and quasi tomato sauce on top. But as a potato pro, their home fries are among the best in the 412. Seek this spot out for a bountiful breakfast and nothing more. Then, head to La Prima around the corner for a proper espresso and get on w/ your morning."}
{"text":"This place is quite overrated.  The food was rather bland, and I was wanting ketchup and hotsauce.  The coffee was pretty bad too.  If you are wanting a lot of food along the lines of an average diner or Denny's, then you might like this place.  Service was good.  For me, it was definitely not work the effort of traveling into the Strip."}
{"text":"The only reason I give Deluca's four and not five stars is because going to the Strip District--especially on a weekend is a nightmare. It is not the easiest place to get to via the bus and parking is near impossible on a Saturday or Sunday. So if it is at all a possibility, go to Deluca's during the week and you will eliminate this hassle from your experience. 

That out of the way this place is definitive of Pittsburgh through and through. It is a great greasy diner and the service is great! I have only ever had the breakfast burrito and the pancakes -- both of which are delicious. The only knock my friends have on the food is that it is so \"predictable.\" To that I say: IT IS A DINER PEOPLE! 

I don't know if people are expecting gourmet cuisine, but if that is what you are looking for do not go to Deluca's. Go to Deluca's if you want an awesome diner breakfast and do not want to be hungry for the remainder of the day."}
{"text":"Another really good breakfast place, but literally pamela's twice + jojo's would take precedence.

the wait is usually a little bit long, but it's probably worth it. again, very generous portions. the buckwheat waffle is delicious. i don't know what i was thinking ordering it \"on the side\".=p"}
{"text":"Huge line and not worth the wait. If you want a greasy breakfast than this is your place... I wasn't impressed."}
{"text":"Ah it was ok.  The hostess wasn't very friendly. She silently led us to our table. This was probably the cheapest dinner out we've had ever. Got the turkey club and it was tiny, but had a good, buttery top and bottom. My husband wanted the hot turkey sandwich which was on the menu, but was told it wasn't \"real\" turkey so the waitress advised against getting. He settled for the bacon cheeseburger.  The diner is small and sort of a dirty vibe, but the bathrooms were clean!"}
{"text":"Although I feel the food at Delucas is mediocre, I feel that the diner's atmosphere, coffee, and location make this spot worthy of a four star!"}
{"text":"oh my lanta. this place is delicious! This was our first time here even though we're in the strip quite a bit. We knew it had to be good because there is always a huge line. Turns out he wait is worth it! I got the special which was a pepperoni and mozzarella omelet and the hubs got the MOAB. Everything was so good that even when I was full I had to keep eating bc i didn't want to leave any behind. Keep in mind that the line seems to go pretty quick and it is cash only (there's a PNC atm right down the street) We can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"We normally come here for breakfast but chose lunch for today. I had the BLT that was stacked high. Plenty of bacon! My husband had the fish sandwich with cheese that he enjoyed. Great service and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Everything good.  Breakfast sandwich awesome.   Coffee never empty.  Welcome to Pittsburgh in the morning.   18 min walk from hotel."}
{"text":"People in line waiting are talking about how Delucas is the best breakfast in Pittsburgh. When I got a table, it took awhile for my grumbling waitress to take my order, but I had plenty of time to observe the cooks throwing food and plates around, food covering the floor, overwhelmed servers and the interesting mural on the wall. My pankakes were good. The bacon, sausage, potatoes and breakfast burrito was not good. There are much better diners in Pittsburgh that are much cleaner and have more satisfying food. Don't worry, there are places in town with a better breakfast, hands down."}
{"text":"My cousin took me here as one of the local places to go when in Pittsburgh. This is what I think dining is all about...localoclaocal! Glad they recommended it. My cousins are vegetarian and were able to find things on the menu that they liked. Rather than going for a sandwich, or breakfast, went for one of the their wraps. It was big, sloppy to eat, and very tasty. I had their Southwest Chicken melt..gooey cheese, chicken, avocado, and more. It hit the spot and provided plenty of energy for a whirlwind tour of Pittsburgh. Look forward to returning to share the place with my husband."}
{"text":"Great service and fantastic service. Stopped in on a Sunday and the place was very busy. Waited on right away and food arrived very fast. Stop in and have a great time!"}
{"text":"Stopped here on a Saturday for breakfast while spending a weekend in Pittsburgh based on the Yelp reviews. A great place to get a classic American breakfast. I got bacon and eggs, my wife got a veggie omelet, and the kids got chocolate chip pancakes, everyone enjoyed their food. Service was bit slow but I expected that given how packed the place was. I would certainly go their again and recommend it. Take note that it is a cash only restaurant."}
{"text":"Don't  see what the fuss is all about.  This place is not good. I ordered the biscuits n gravy with scrambled eggs n hash browns. I specified that the hash browns be extra crisp. What I got for my 8.79 was milk gravy that tasted like they scraped the griddle after making sausage patties and added them to the gravy and it was starting to congeal. The eggs were gone in 3 bites and the hash browns were mushy white paste on the plate.  My sister ordered eggs meat hash browns with a side of sourdough toast. Toast was 2.79 for 2 pieces of  toast so coldthat it wouldn't even melt her butter. The hash browns again, were white paste.  The only good part of this meal was the coffee.  So for 23 dollars and change, we will not be going back anytime soon!!!"}
