{"text":"While this little place can be easily missed, it's actually simple to access - in fact you can get into it from either side. On one end, you have a bakery, with plenty of Central American goodness, and on the other, you have something more akin to a restaurant.

Strangely, however, if you come in from the restaurant side, they don't really notice you. So you then have to walk through to the other side, at which point, the staff is fairly friendly, and service is good.

Food is decent, and you get a plateful for a good price. Definitely worth a stop - but it may be better to just stop in for their baked goods!"}
{"text":"Rating their pupusas as some of the very best in the Charlotte area. Be sure you ask for masa corn and NOT rice flour! The pork cheese are super stuffed, hot, yummy & flavorful.  Tacos are way too tiny, the mini street taco size, too difficult to eat & enjoy. Go for the pupusas, they are fantastic!"}
{"text":"I came here for some pupusas. Our waiter was super nice. Reasonable menu and prices. It all started going down hill when my little cousin ordered a pastry from the bakery and it was all stale. Possibly 3days old. We demanded they be thrown out and not to charge us for it. Thats just the beginning. Then we ordered 4 atoles de lotes to go and two of them fell because the cup holders broke. They were refusing to replace them for us after we paid but thats alright the point is they didn't have to treat us the way they did. Never coming here again unless you are craving a stale pastry."}
{"text":"Made my BF pick us up dinner since its on his way home. Staff speaks limited English, but they tried their best to accommodate him. I'm not exactly sure what pupusas are suppose to taste like, but I like them from here. Served with the pickled cabbage to put on top and I added diced onions on top. Yum. Tamales are pretty good too, just some hot sauce for me and I was good to go. Craving satisfied."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in Charlotte! Best Hispanic food. It's different than Mexican and Colombian. Everyone is very nice and looks happy to be at work. Most of the servers only speak Spanish. But there are definitely people there who are bilingual. It's not a super fancy place, it's an authentic place with a great vibe! I recommend desayuno numero seis!"}
