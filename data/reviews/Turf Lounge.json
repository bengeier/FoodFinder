{"text":"Went there for dinner with friend. Overall nothing really stood out don't get me wrong the good isn't bad but I would say its a just above average. For those of you that like to play the horses its a nice upscale experience compared to the track"}
{"text":"The best OTB I've ever seen. Beautiful old building with vaulted ceilings and ornate chandeliers. It is owned by Woodbine, so horse racing is shown throughout the space, with betting windows at the rear. Slightly high prices, but really not that bad for the bay street area. Plus you can win your money back! Really nice friendly staff. A winner!"}
{"text":"During the second week of Summerlicious, I had a lovely little lunch with a few work friends at Turf Lounge.   Our meal started with complimentary bread and butter, pretty standard. I didn't have any, I'm more of a bread and olive oil type of girl. As a group, we ordered all three possible appetizer options. My dining companions were excited by the Goat Cheese Puck Salad, with a generous portion of fried goats cheese sitting on a pile of greens. This reminds me of Guu Izakaya's Fried Brie, which is one of their most popular dishes. They polished their plates, so I'm going to go ahead and say it was good. I had the Tomato Consommé, it was tasty, and very filling for an appetizer.   For the main course, everyone got the Brisket Sandwich, except for me (aversion to red meat, you know). The Brisket Sandwich was described to be decadent and delicious. I was nibbling on my friend's frites, they were yummy. I had the Creole Tomato & Pepper Crusted Salmon. By \"Pepper Crusted\", they meant Pepper Crusted, a crust made seemingly with all ground pepper. The pepper crust overpowered the fish enveloped within. But the fish was cooked quite well, not over done at all. The best part of this dish was the cucumber slaw on top, refreshing and serving as a gentle reminder that it is summer time.  For more, please check out my blog, I have photos! ;)  http://simplygluttonous.blogspot.ca/2013/07/turf-lounge-summerlicious.html"}
{"text":"Went here with some work colleagues for Winterlicious.  Very disappointed.  The online menu said 'chicken and dumplings', the paper menu at our table 'chicken stew and dumplings'.  In the end the people who ordered received a soup with more broth than anything else.  The fish cake appetizer was really good, but my 'panini' was really only half a panini,only one triangle, I wanted to know where the other half of the sandwich went that was cut off.  A nice place, but it took nearly 40 minutes to bring us our water and take our orders.  Way too long for price fix menu."}
{"text":"I recently went to Turf Lounge for the first time and was pleasantly surprised, although  I was only there for drinks.  The drinks are expensive, but no more expensive than many of the other post-work financial district options, like Reds for example.    The space is really cool.  The bar has this spectacularly high ceiling and there are a number of other rooms more suited for sitting down to dinner that are all pretty cool looking.  You also watch horse races from all over the world and bet on them right in the bar/restaurant.  I have no idea how you do this but there was no shortage of people sitting there with a newspaper doing it.  So if it's raining at Santa Anita and you have a good lead on a horse whose mother was a mudder and whose father was a mudder you should check it out."}
{"text":"Great drinks and atmosphere here! Went here with coworkers and enjoyed an excellent variety of sliders and appetizers!"}
{"text":"Food is BAD.  (for Winterlicious 2013)  Both my friend and I agree.  Panini had a strange metal smokey taste. I had a bite and left it there. I usually finish food altho it was bad but I couldn't swallow it this time.  Ravioli was really salty, intolerably salty.  Nothing special about the dessert, maybe 3 stars. Only the fish cake for appetizer is good.  There was even a FLY on the bread spread.... Oh my...."}
{"text":"***3.5 stars***  I was at Turf Lounge last night for an event.  It definitely has the Bay streeter pub feel.  Turf Lounge is known for its horse betting, it is owned by Woodbine Racetracks.  You are able get your horse betting fix while still being in the city.  I was blown away by the service, our waiter was attentive and prompt with the drinks. They make a might good Cesar!  Unfortunately, the appetizers were mediocre bordering on sub par.  The little quiche pies they served were the memorable ones of the lot.  Turf Lounge is a cool after work hangout if you are in the Financial district area."}
{"text":"When I first read about Turf Lounge I thought it was it was a seafood surf and turf restaurant. Little did I know it's actually a restaurant/gambling lounge. The food was really good. I really liked the bread/dip. Repeat: yes  Food Appetizer Grilled Calamari with ham - 4/5 interesting combo Entree Winter root vegetables-4/5 I love root vegetables and was in root vegetables heaven. But I was quite surprised to see it as an entree. I usually think of vegetables as a side"}
{"text":"TRIPLE CROWN: TOM BRODI, BEAUTY AND THE BET  We have passed by the Turf Lounge thousands of times, unaware that inside is the Atrium Bar, one of the city's most architecturally beautiful places to meet for drinks. A spectacular facet was the re-purposing of the facade of the Savarin Tavern, the iconic Bay St. watering hole of the 1940s and 1950s. There is much to admire: 45-foot high cathedral ceilings, historic stone walls, and, anchoring the room, a 20-foot long natural wood bar.  TurfChef Within this suite of rooms is the kitchen with Chef Tom Brodi at the helm. A multi-credentialed thoroughbred, he has shown us his creative skill right out of the starting gate.  In Post Position, pulling from his Hungarian heritage, exotic radishes thinly sliced, form a necklace around a ramekin of herb butter, and there are Hungarian goat cheese and butter biscuits. Search for the meaning of comfort food, and this is it.  In a tasting menu that is proving to be full of surprises, we are swept away with crunchy avocado sections and luscious lobster fritters. Mill St. Brewery beer batter is the secret ingredient here.  Is Brodi showing off, or just flattering our gastronomic taste buds like crazy? Cool hamachi yellow fin tuna with taro root parfait opens the door to the hot appetizer. Hidden at the bottom of a mound of vanilla and crème fraiche-napped black beluga lentils is a surprise of velvety seared fois gras. Clever Tom Brodi.  Turfhamachi A palate cleanser is in order, and his Pimms sorbet is a brilliant choice.  Which is the favored entrée? Perfectly done Roasted Halibut or 60-day aged beef steaks. In our opinion, it's a Dead Heat. Both are partnered with an awesome sauté of exotic mushrooms including shiitake and the fluffy maitake mushrooms known in Japan as the \"Dancing\" mushroom and in the U.S. as \"Hen of the Woods\" because of its ruffled feathers appearance.  des Sticky toffee pudding with vanilla bean ice cream makes us want to run into the kitchen and give Tom Brodi a big hug. \"Are you loving your dessert?\" I ask the men at the table, knowing full well that what they would really like to do after the last spoon full has been devoured is lick the bowl.  Turf Lounge is a unique concept by Woodbine Entertainment Group. Throughout the lounge, in the vast dining room and adjoining rooms, TV monitors simulcast horse-racing from Canada's premier race tracks, Woodbine and Mohawk, as well as tracks all over the world, from Happy Valley in Hong Kong to the Dorset in Delaware. At every moment there is a horse race happening somewhere in the TurfMain world - and we are there. We place our bets electronically and watch the races, seated in chairs designed for comfort. Win some - lose some.  Across the Board, an evening at the Turf Lounge is the most fun you can have on Bay Street."}
{"text":"Great food, friendly service.  I came here for lunch and the crowd was distinctly Bay Street and expense account.  It's rather pricy, and the food can be incredible.  I had the Artichoke Tart with an olive pesto which was super delicious as well as Atlantic Lobster Carbonara - simply yum!  The portion sizes are small, but due to the richness of the dishes, I had no complaints at the end.  My fellow diners both had the special which was some sort of risotto with duck confit.  I love duck and I can't say that I was very impressed with the dish.  Overall, a very nice restaurant to impress clients, bosses and colleagues with but not an everyday place for a get together with friends!"}
{"text":"I went here after work last Monday for happy hour.  It was really quiet in here. I work up the street, so it was a short walk here. Met someone here and ordered the calamari and a salad.  The food was average. Nothing special.  Service was average.  Ambiance is zero. The place was full of stiff suits by the time I was walking out. It looks like a place to book for lunch and learns or a corporate meeting. The worst part was I think at some point our waitress leaves, and a bus boy comes to take the payment. Took my debit card and ran off somewhere, brought it back with it in a machine and old me to click \"ok\". . . I want to see what I am clicking \"ok\" to before I click okay you doorknob. Anyways further more, he said the card did not work and declined.  I was freaking out calling my bank. I went across the street after it worked fine. So clearly there is some sort of issue here. Called bank they said my card was not even read there when swiped/input into machine.  Back to the main point - the food was boring, the place is uneventful and it was filled with suits and not the hot ones you see at trump or blowfish, I am talking like retiree-back-as-consultant-because-wife-doesnt-want-him-home, type suits."}
{"text":"Press release:  TORONTO, August 24 - Woodbine Entertainment Group (WEG) today announced that it is closing its Turf Lounge operation in downtown Toronto, effective Saturday, September 5, 2015.

{"text":"I don't think many people actually know that Turf is owned by Woodbine Racetrack.  Woodbine is 5 minutes from the Toronto Airport, and home to the Queen's Plate - Canada's National Horse Race.  I went to this bar last fall for a birthday celebration, only to find out it's pretty much on \"off track\" betting bar. Instead of it being a coin operated counter video game type of bar along the freeway, this place actually resembles that of a high end Lounge. The restaurant boads sleek design elements, while the Lounge offers more of an intimate \"old mans library\" type feel. The main bar where we did most of our socializing has a towering 20ft screen to watch the Pony's in action.  The prices are Bay St - meaning $8 for a beer or mixed drink. We ordered a couple of appetizers that included wings, artichoke dip and deep fried calamari. They had a bit of eastern flair mixed in which made them a bit tastier than your average pub fare. The service was good, but got increasingly better as we drank half of the bar stock on hand - or so it seemed!  Now lets get to the betting! Did you know that can can bet on a race anywhere in North America from a bar in Toronto? I didnt, which increased all of our debts, but made for an interesting evening. Everyone has their theory's - mine are simple - bet the best odds and hope that you can make a couple of bucks. We all came home a little short of cash, but had an amazing experience. This bar is a great alternative to your everyday bar. Enjoy the track from the comfort of your barstool (it doesn't sound as good as home, but we had fun anyways!), and enjoy!  Giddy Up!"}
{"text":"We went here with a group on a Saturday night for dinner. Place was nearly deserted. But the service was friendly to us.   We had a group meal, so some of it may have been the group portions, but the dishes were just ok.  Not bad, but a little heavy on the salt (which is saying something). The chocolate desert was the most memorable part.  It was a pleasant experience and fun. And if you have a group, it'll be fine. But if you're in the area looking for something unique -- outside of betting, there are better choices."}
{"text":"went there for a company brunch, the food was mediocure....my steak was cold, however the wine was great..for the area, and type of place it is..its not worth it. ....the only good thing was the wine and dessert...."}
{"text":"I'm a fan...  We came here in a small group of six. for Summerlicious  We were greeted well and the wait staff were very friendly. The food was delicious.  I had the Kobe beef flank steak.  It was a small portion but in the end I was satisfied. The ambience was very pleasant and relaxed.  New decor and trendy.  I can imagine it's a nice hot spot at night... I guess I'll need to find out. :)"}
{"text":"I went today for Summerlicious lunch; in fact, I spontaneously organized a departmental lunch and after conferring with another colleague, we chose Turf. Good choice b/c everyone had fun and that's what matters.  Because we had a large group, they were very accommodating with my group's particular needs and put us in a separate room.  What I enjoyed about the experience was the fact that everyone enjoyed themselves, from the meal itself to the betting.  We had winnings!  The food was very delicious. I heard from everyone how they liked the food, No complaints.  When you walk in, it's important to mention how beautiful the bar area is.  It's a high end lounge with an off-track betting facility. I don't bet, but my table had fun, and to me, having my guests enjoy themselves and have fun, means it was a very successful outing!"}
{"text":"Came for a group luncheon.  Service was very good.  This was a business lunch so focus was on other attendees and our servers understood this. For a large group all the food came out together and hot.  Selection they provided was nice with good variety.  I enjoyed the meal I selected - mushroom soup and risotto.  Only complaint would be that risotto was under seasoned but easily corrected."}
{"text":"Our firm held a private luncheon function at Turf on Monday with 20 + senior investment executives to discuss key topics relevant to their business.   Anyhow we booked a private room for a 90 min lunch and we are blown over the moon with the not only amazing food and drinks but as well the 5 star service the entire Turf team provided.     They have a new Executive Chef and the food definitely representative of his skills.  The venue has also undergone an update and refresh to reduce the fact that you can also bet on the horses, which certainly has attracted more of a Bay street/upscale crowd for lunch which definitely delivers on the food and service side.  We will return in the near future"}
{"text":"This place discriminates you if you are non-white for sure.  I visit downtown Toronto once in awhile because my husband works at Deloitte. He takes me to the bar during lunch/horse betting sometimes and I don't have any problem with the dress code. I usually wear capri and a nice top since it is hot during summer here. FYI my husband is Caucasian. This time I have my cousin travel with me.  I decided to take her to the lounge and have a couple of drinks while waiting for my husband coming for lunch. The host didn't let us in. She said this place was for well dressed business people only.  Wow!!!!! I was totally shock and fear because of the way she looked at us and her voice like she disgust us for being Asian.  If she was a host who just wanted to follow the rule, I understood. But the way she handled it was totally unprofessional and uneducated."}
{"text":"I am quite sure this will be our last visit to Turf Lounge a spot I have been coming to at least once a year since it opened with great promise at least a decade ago. The prime location, splashy looks and very much above average food was for me a total surprise after enduring years mediocrity (or worse, more on that later) at the many Woodbine Entertainment Group facilities.  It is no longer such a restaurant. Reviews from the four of us ranged from Very Good fish to Okay risotto (me) to two, steak and calamari, in the Not Good At All range. The service, by the way, was worthy of a  4 star rating.  To finish my story hinted at above, this same group of friends visited a WEG facility every Monday night for years. One evening we turned the corner into the buffet alcove with the usual tepid anticipation to discover what had been prepared. What we found was a swarm of fruit flies so thick we were disgusted to approach. Our vociferous complaints brought a refund of the dinning room minimum and that was that, or so we thought.  We returned the next week (we are gluttons, in this case for punishment) to find their resolution was the installation of a number of standing fans to blow the little suckers away from their buffet meal. The damn flies were still in the building seven days later and we were supposed to be happy because only the strong few could fight the torrent.  Adios Weg."}
{"text":"I love this place!   I had a really good experience here. The service was great, and the food was amazing. It might also be because i was here in a private room with 20 other people for a seminar....and we also ate a 3 course meal.   Everything about the meal was perfect - the summer squash soup was amazing and very flavourful, and the chicken breast with quinoa and mushrooms were also very flavourful and delicious! Lastly, the dessert was creme brulee topped with raspberry, which was very delicious!!!  I have good memories of this place. They also gave us all a $2 complimentary ticket to bet on a race horse....it was the first for most of us to bet on a horse race - but we bet, and won!! Our horse came number 1 and we won $5 :) Not a lot but still a great experience overall."}
{"text":"I went to the Turf Lounge today.  The service was awesome and the appetizers were exquisite.  Heck I even broke even!  Now that's a good day at the \"track\"."}
{"text":"My husband and I happened upon Turf Lounge as we were walking down Bay Street from our hotel to another lounge that had been recommended.  We decided to go inside.  It was a Saturday night, but it was pretty dead.  We sat at the bar and the waitress told us that because the location is in the financial district, they are most busy during the lunch time hours during the week.  It was such a neat place though and the waitress was so helpful.  We learned how to bet on horses, which neither my hsuband or I had ever done before, and they even gave us 2 free $2 bets to get us started and some practice.  We ended up winning about $10 overall.  We had some great drinks and just hung out.  We would like to go back when its actually busy so that we can get the whole horse betting environment.  I do recommend it because it was an experience and not like any other bar we had ever been to."}
