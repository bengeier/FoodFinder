{"text":"tempe tavern has a pre-pay policy. you must pay cash or  credit card before being served. quite tacky when taking family or friends out. not only they not trust their customers its obvious they could care less. i called them and asked if this was regular policy, and the bartinder just went off on me. she would not let me talk at all and went off on what to me was a crack-head tangent. so sorry she is, and too bad for the business and heard working persons of the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Vanessa is the best bartender ever!!!!! 
She's not only attentive and thoughtful, but she's got a nice ass 
You won't be disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"After reading several glowing reviews on this site, I decided to sate my curiosity and check out this hidden gem.  

It's located on the northeast corner of McClintock and Apache, wedged between a gas station and an adult book store.  There is substantial parking in the back.  As of this writing, you can't reach the rear parking lot from McClintock, so you're best bet is to head west on Apache and use the parking lot entrance.  If you're going at night, be careful entering as the driveway is somewhat narrow.

The building is quite quaint and fun to admire.  The back page of their folded, paper menu tells the brief history of the architecture.  The bar is somewhat small and seats probably about 20 people.  There are numerous tables throughout and seating outside.  If you came to watch TV at the bar, there are few TVs that have a clear line of sight.  I usually sit at the south side of the bar and the TV over the bar is obscured by the keg draft handles.

Ambiance and location aside, the real reason to come here is for the drinks and food.  The food is ultra cheap and the drinks doubly so.  As of this writing, they have $2 specials on draft Coors and 1810 (Genesee Cream Ale).  If you're so inclined, they have PBR in the can for $2.  As of yesterday, the bartender (Cory) informed me that they have a happy hour, between 5PM and 8PM -- two for one well drinks and domestic drafts.

I've tried several things on their menu.  I'm not crazy about their wings; they're just not spicy enough.  They have some deep-fried jalapenos that they call \"bottlecaps\".  They give you a huge portion and they are pretty spicy, so keep that beer handy.  Their nachos are OK, especially considering the price of $4.  Their chicken strips are pretty good.  They do have some amazing hot dogs with lots of toppings.  I believe the most expensive item on their menu is $8.  Most items are somewhere around $6.  Keep in mind that they don't have the hot pretzel basket, even though it is listed on their menu and web-site.

The action picks up at night and the place can get crowded.  In the afternoons, the place is a cemetery...which is perfect if you're just looking to have a few drinks and some cheap food without any fuss.

Service-wise, I have no complaints.  I've rarely had to wait for a drink and the food comes out fast.  I had chicken strips earlier this week and they were so hot that I had to wait ten minutes to eat them.

Sometimes, they can get busy at unexpected times and you might have to wait a bit longer (especially if you're at a table), but that's to be expected.

Overall, I enjoy Tempe Tavern and have recommended it to several friends.  I think it's a great value and a cool setting."}
{"text":"I work down the street and I can remember when this was an empty building. It should have stayed empty.

Ive been a here a few times during the past couple of years. The first thing I noticed was the price of booze being hiked up at least twice while paying 4$ for a glass. As the night went on and people were getting more buzzed, it was 5$ then the price went up a few dollars to as much as 7$ for a beer. 

Dont bother getting a mixed drink as it will be watery or icy. Dont order an Adios MF as youll get more juice than booze.

When youre waiting at least 10 minutes or more for your next round, you can count on the bartenders to count their tips several times before being helped. When they do come around, they will help their friends first. If youre disgusted with their service, theyll hunt you down asking about the tip..\"was it bad service?\" Yes! That speaks for itself.

Bouncer is a cool guy. The owner is quick to kick anyone out or turn off the lights on patrons at 140am while they are are trying to get their last drinks in, finish their drinks or pay their tabs.

Groggys, Yucca Tap Room, Rogue and The Palo Verde are better. The convenience of the light rail does not do this place any justice.

Dont mention the shop next door either. Just go in and get your watered down drinks if you have nothing better to do."}
{"text":"Excellent little place. Servers all seemed a little young, but very cool. Good burger. Good beer/drinks. Good selection. Killer atmosphere. Will def be back"}
{"text":"Just a nice local bar and small music venue in one. 
Awesome menu with many burgers to choose from. I opted for the Juan Pablo. Super juicy burger topped with a grilled Poblano pepper. Side of Jalapeno Chips. 
They have a great beer selection that included inexpensive domestic cans all the way to craft beers. 
Back room is a stage setup with pretty good sound for such a small venue. We went here to see my wife's co-workers band play(DeadSpawn) and stayed for another as well. 
A place I'd go back to for some music, but a bit too far to just go for a beer. Stop by and check out their daily specials!"}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of the dive bar scene but this place is pretty cool. Found it in 2012 I wanna say when a friend of a friend was performing. They have live music during the weekends but I'm not too sure about the weekdays. I love how original the place is. Covered in art and graffiti and the bartenders are always nice and accommodating. I like to go on Fridays around 9. Not busy or crowded like some bars can be and It's located literally right by the light rail so you can go there to have a few drinks and hop on the light rail to wander around downtown Phoenix. The only con is that it's located by an adult arcade? Lol to each their own."}
{"text":"Still talking about the Tempe tavern beer and food specials long after visiting there.  The burger was huge and tasty.  We liked the fact that it was located along the light rail so we could have drinks and use public transit.  Would definitely go back next time we are in the Phoenix area as I hear they make a great grilled cheese sandwich and you can't beat the prices."}
{"text":"fantastic the tavern buger has got to be one of the best burgers in this city good selection of beer and a nice old fashion vibe to the place"}
{"text":"Great bar. I enjoy my pint while sitting in the patio area in the front of of the bar.  Due to it being a busy intersection in a college town, you never know what you will see.  Good selection beers and drinks. The building is historic and adds to the personality.

Food is \"meh\". They do house cut fries and just like most places that do house cut fries,  they are soggy and flaccid. Don't come for the food. Come for the environment."}
{"text":"Excellent dive bar. Wide selection of beer - tap and otherwise - and good food, inexpensive.

The bar is open early so an early lunch is possible. It has a friendly staff (especially the female day bartender and the male evening bartender), who actively engage all patrons not just the regulars (even though we've become regulars since discovering the place).

Cleanliness and an open floor plan make this a very inviting place. While I'm not an active fan of sports (unless it's baseball or hockey season), they do promote sports and have many TVs, all tuned to different games, so everyone is covered. Some nights there is live music - sometimes well-organized and other times more-or-less like an open-mic event - in a wide variety of styles.

The smoking areas in the front and back offers comfortable seating, although it is a bit cramped on Friday and Saturday with people trying to smoke and talk.

During non-football season, the bar offers drink specials like two-for-one etc that are pretty spectacular for an evening out. They also offer raffles,with decent packages, not just the usual bar swag items seen in many places, on some days if food is purchased.

This is a bar I frequent and highly recommend - casual, comfortable, and lively."}
{"text":"Good divey vibe. Good band playing. Shut their kitchen down an hour early, which sucks if you're like me - drunk and in need if food."}
{"text":"Surprised to discover this little gem with my buddy.  And loooong happy hour on Tuesday nights so that's great!  Love the Rogue Hazelnut Brown ale and the two for one \"1810\" cream ale is the bomb. Marsha was awesome and very helpful suggesting all the best drinks.  Love it"}
{"text":"Because of a horrific experience I had with the bartender in whom ordered me the hottest wings known to man, he refused to take them back, especially when I specifically asked for not hot. He got in my face and ordered me to eat them. Ever since that night with scum bag behind the bar I've never stepped foot in there since. This is the kind of place where the saying applies: you get what you pay for.  So far I've not been in that establishment and life couldn't be better"}
{"text":"Don't stop here unless you want to roll the dice.  Lousy food, lousy service.  The bartenders, specifically, Sarah, seem to think unprofessional behavior is acceptable. That's not where my money will go."}
{"text":"Stopped in after Black Sabbath concert. great selection of canned beers the beers were cold and served by a very efficient crew of bartenders. The live music on the night we were there was not usual for the place , I know this because at least 5 of the regulars told me so as I was obviously trying to figure out way there was Old rap music playing that seemed out of place for a bar in Tempe."}
{"text":"Burgers burgers burgers and slushy margaritas. Love it. Two for one burgers on a Monday. Oh and the fries are amazing."}
{"text":"As I sat and made small talk with a blonde waitress, the bartender took her order. He proceeded to make what I believe was a martini, a dirty martini. I only say a dirty  martini as I nerver had one but since he was adding olive juice by holding his bare hand over the olive  and fruit tray (BARE) just nasty.
Juice pouring through his fingers like an added boost of flavor.

Then I ordered a shot, and it was double the price of one in a  downtown Chicago night club. Makers Mark. A double in one  shot glass wtf. 

Waitress was rude, and I mean nasty. So  nasty I wrote as a tip, learn to be less rude.
This place is a dive. Or in better terms a dark Dungeness shit hole with bitter servers and bands that can't even play the wedding circuit. 

I swear the stench of drunk nasty is still on me from sitting on the stools. 

If you plan on going here, slam your  in a discount cab door first. Its as much fun and three times cheaper.
By the way this was my second time here. I always go twice"}
{"text":"Any place where I can get Old Chub in a can (for I think 3 bucks?) is a freakin gold mine in my book. Not sure why the bartenders get so much bad rap. They seemed fine to me. Maybe stick with beer and get your girlie drinks somewhere else. 
Tempe Tavern will forever hold a place in my heart for another reason as well- I proposed to my girlfriend here. Yeah, I'm pretty romantic. What can I say, you drink a few Old Chubs, get a little emotional, and decide that this is the right time and place to do this shit. 
We're getting married next month in Maui. I will probably get stuck drinking Mai Thai's with my toes in the sand as a young Hawaiian boy rubs oil on my calves, buuuut I'll get my Old Chub fix when we get back."}
{"text":"The worse customer service today...she wasn't very welcoming and didn't care of our requests which she made on the decision of other patrons."}
{"text":"Cheese fries!!! Get these for sure. The rest of the food is pretty good too. Friendly service, fun environment. It reminds me of my favorite dive bars from Minneapolis."}
{"text":"Love this place. Pretty solid beers on tap, and security at this place is legit.  I sit on the patio when I go and they ensure it stays classy.  This is the definition of a DIVE bar!!!  Thank you for some great nights!"}
{"text":"Never want to go back, no matter who's playing. 

First of all the stage is shitty and the room is so small my ears are ringing for what I can tell is gonna last for days.  

Food was poor and overpriced. 

Our waitress was nice but I spent $10 on a double whiskey something and didn't even feel a buzz.  That's saying a lot for the huge lightweight I am, and my drink was at least 24 ounces. 

Lastly there's barely any parking, and we got towed for parking in an adjacent parking spot where the towing sign was almost on the ground so we didn't see it when we first parked there."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and prices! Bottle caps are amazing I always add melted cheese on top! :)"}
{"text":"Great place and wonderful dive bar. Big beer selection and nice menu. Live music on a Wednesday! Comfortable seating and good wait service. We just had beer and chips - but had a great time.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Stopped in here on our way through town and were pleasantly surprised by the delicious burgers and sufficient helping of sides. Beer selection was great. Service was a bit slow but they were attentive to details."}
{"text":"Awesome food,great environment, cold beer, great place,  super friendly staff and the owner Rob is great! Highly recommended place to wet your whistle!"}
{"text":"I've been here a bunch of time, and the bartenders are plain bad. I've seen multiple drinks terribly messed up (bartender, you can't tell that a drink is wrong when it has coke in it and is still clear?) as well as bartenders try to force and guilt people into buying water. I organize a group event every month that comes here with about 20-30 people and we won't be coming back in the future."}
{"text":"For many months I watched and waited as Tempe Tavern came to be.  I wanted a good local watering hole that wasn't a sports bar or one of those Mill Ave joints that turns into a dance club at 10pm.  Tempe Tavern is neither.  It's a classic local watering hole.  The beer selection is impressive for a place it's size and they offer a good menu.  They serve some of the best hot wings I've had since moving to metro Phoenix.  Service is friendly and the beer is cheap.  On top of it all this is the only place I know of around here that serves Schlitz.  When you sit at the bar make sure to try the hot 'n' spicy peanuts in the carafe's.  

The place has never been too crowded either but I've heard they do have some busy shifts.  I assume these are Friday and Saturday nights.  I typically hit up Tempe Tavern on Sunday or Monday.

My only complaint is petty: there's not jukebox.  Maybe that will come along with time.   They do pump in music from somewhere.  Mostly alternative stuff.

There's a little stage for bands to perform and I have hopes of checking out some of the local music soon.

Tempe Tavern is a fantastic place.  If you're looking for a neighborhood bar and want to get away from the college kid hell that is Mill Ave then this is the place for you.  The crowd is still mostly college age but it's not the same cast of Jersey Shore casting call rejects that haunt Mill Ave."}
{"text":"Burgers are ridiculously good.. The bread is fresh and flaky, the fries and onion rings are both delicious. I also go for a salad on my occasion. I go almost every Monday. I have to order my burger with one pattie, since 2 is more than I can handle. All the burgers (except The Killa) has 1/2 lb of meat. They have a great selection of burgers. You like chilies? Go with the Juan Pablo.. It's Bomb! Monday is buy-one-get-one.. Love this place!"}
{"text":"I'd love it if the a/c was on. Great bar. What's up with a 100o day and no a/c. We Would've stayed and spent more & had food, but too hot. Bummer. Not cool."}
{"text":"Happy hour 4-7 with 2 for 1 drinks, cant beat that. The daytime bartenders are cool, the nightime bartenders are spoiled but somewhat cool. Why there are males working behind a bar is beyond me."}
{"text":"I have to say the customer service is flawless! From the minute I sat down to right now (which is probably an hour) service all day! I didn't have to ask or wave anybody down, the server WAS ON IT! She approached before I said anything with the biggest smile and I can tell she really appreciated my presence let alone business! 10 stars all day and don't get me started on the food (10 stars). Her name is maddy and ask for her, trust me you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"OMG. This is the Palo Verde lounge but clean!! I came here tonight and the gin and tonics were only $2.50 each and it's a Friday night!! They also have bar food which is decent ( we got the french fries,served with ketchup and mayonnaise). There's also a veggie burger. I didn't try it but I will the next time I come. When I first walked up they were playing Alanis Morissette. Nothing but 90s throughout the night. I also met a nice dog named Molly which should be the mascot for the bar.The only complaint I have is that there is only one stall in the ladies room. There needs to be at least 2 people come on.. I also just want to point out that they had bubblegum vodka. BUBBLEGUM. Enough said. The service was great and there so many seating options. I moved three times because I wanted to take advantage of every seat. There's no stupid college kids in town so it was really enjoyable. There's also Modern World next door so if you meet some guy for a one night stand, you can gear up next door to make sure it's a pleasurable night. The bar is DIRECTLY across the street from the lightrail so there's no excuse for you not to go.. Go now...What are you waiting for???"}
{"text":"I wanted to try out a new place when meeting up with friends and my choice became this oddly located place. This night they had an open mic night and anyone and everyone is welcome to take the mic - I find this pretty cool. As I wouldn't necessarily go here if I was a talent scout, I sure would if I wanted to show off my awesome banjo talent for peers and perhaps get a beer out of it. 

The prices are right. The service is right. The atmosphere is friendly (to my surprise, I expected a more institutionalized mentality where the grace only fall on the locals but I was wrong) and welcoming, both from patrons as from the staff.

There isn't much to this place - but I can't find one thing that I disliked with it. Well, the only thing (and I doubt this is a common sight) was that when I came in there was 5-6 kids under the age of 10 in there. I have no idea why they were there, nor did they stay.. but the patrons treated them with respect and they didn't bother anyone in return. As I said, if this is common I wouldn't like it, but if it's not - I couldn't care less."}
{"text":"Great prices and atmosphere here. 12 chicken wings, a shot and a gormet beer was less than $20! They played good, classic music, other than The (fucking) Cranberries and the wait staff (Sarah) was friendly. This is a cool spot for sure."}
{"text":"I love hole in the wall bars, and Tempe Tavern is a decent place.  Service is slow, but they have some pretty good drink specials.  There are lots of TVs if you want to watch a game.  I tried the Honey BBQ wings and ordered them grilled.  They were sticky and oh so good.  The menu is a typical bar menu.  

I left happy, but wasn't like, \"OMG I can't wait to come back here\".  I don't know what it was.  I'll try anything twice though so maybe if I do ever go again, I will like it more."}
{"text":"So it would get negative starts because I was cussed out flipped off by a red headed bartender on Monday night. 

It was the rudest occasion all involving an orissa car bomb. 

I'm 27 years and have had enough experience to know if whether or not I was in the wrong or if there was another way I could've approached the situation. 

Basically I asked for about an ounce more beer in my glass because it was poured about three fingers.  I mix drinks at my work so it was a simple fix or easy discussion to be done. 

Now I always love this place because of the atmosphere but this girl called me a fag got and told me to get the f out all because of asking for a little more beer. 

I don't understand why I got that response moreover after I asked she said \" what just because the way you look,  you believe you deserve free stuff? \". I thought it was a joke and I already paid for it so nothing was free but she kept repeating that and I replied\" no,  I just didn't think it was that big of an issue. \" 

I tell her I'm having a hard time I just broke up with my girlfriend and would appreciate it. Later she uses that against me and says sorry about you breaking up with your boyfriend calls me a pussy and a fag got and explains that the owner would have her back because he is a penny pincher and does not drink. 

I'm with a girl friend of mine telling her this place was cool and she was mortified and embarrassed through out and I had no idea this would happen,  so I try so hard to calm the situation and she asked after I mentioned I mix drinks,  she asked what would you do if someone asked you for free stuff.  I explained I paid for it and would do everything in my power to make my customer satisfied. She then called me a push over and that her boss would agree with her that's not how he would like it living in Brooklyn and a non dinner. 

She was terrible and hope something is done because I would never expect that in any bar or restaurant I owned or manged."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place and they have a great beer selection! They had multiple of my favorite beers!! Then buy one get one burger! Awesome atmosphere and even a stage! I'm excited to see what shows they have to offer!! Now one of my favorite new bars! Not to mention that my bartender was so fun and nice, Sherri was Awesome!!!! So they make everything fresh, dressings, beer battered onion rings!! No microwaves, no freezers!! This is my new go to spot!! I'm in love!!!!!

Edit: This place has ruined burgers for me everywhere else. I always compare to this place and so far I haven't had one as good!!! Curse your amazing burgers!!!"}
{"text":"Came here to see Dead Hot Workshop play their weekly casual happy hour gig one late afternoon/early evening on a Friday. Had a few beers - beers are cheap but don't expect too much variety on tap. Kind of a small stage with a pillar blocking the view right in the middle. Still, not a bad place to see a band crank it up and jam out. They also have one of those AMI Barlink jukeboxes - the kind most dives have as opposed to TouchTunes that the fancier bars have. Place is on the northeast corner of McClintock Drive and Apache boulevard. It's not exactly on the corner - one business away from it. Pretty much the only way to get into their parking lot is to be heading west on Apache and turn into the last driveway before the corner - where it says Modern World Bookstore. Yup. Place shares a parking lot with a bookstore. The kind that probably doesn't carry any Harry Potter or Dr. Seuss titles. Don't overshoot this entrance though because although there are other parking lots that are right next to this one, they are for other businesses and you might get towed depending on your luck that day. Good divey times - check out local bands and get drunk for cheap!!!"}
{"text":"Here is a copy of the email I sent the owner:

Rob,

I am taking a moment of my day to write to you to inform you of our experience last night in your bar which could be described as unethical and unimaginable.  We were in there until about 10:30 or 11:00pm last night and went home to get more money because I make it a practice not to bring my bank card to a bar.  We went home, had something to eat and walked back.  We live at the Tempe Travel Trailer Villa right down the street and have been coming to your establishment off and on since the end of last May which I am sure you could care less about.   There are reasons we are not more frequent which I may get to later.

We came back in at 11:42pm (you can check your bar cameras) and we were asked by the bouncer if we were next door.  It was late, we had some drinks in your bar earlier ($30 worth to be exact and we tipped the bartender about $10, so we're not scum) and were taken by surprise by this question and I said \"yes\" not realizing that he had meant Modern World.  My partner had asked him \"what do you mean next door?\"  Even though TTTV is not exactly next door it is less than a block from your \"bar\" and could be considered \"in the neighborhood\".  

We have patronized your bar to the tune of probably $500 regrettably since last May between us and friends that we had brought and while your bar could be considered a place to frequent on the way to something better we are close to it and don't have to drive.  After this question was asked and we had told him, after the confusion was eliminated, we went home and came back he had promptly said \"We don't allow that.\"  I said you don't allow what? I can't go home and get more money and come back?  He said \"NO, get out, we don't allow that.  You know what I am talking about?\"  What is this guy talking about?  

May I ask why patrons of Modern World are not allowed into your bar?  Let me remind you that you own or manage a bar which doesn't exactly attract Christian folks ready to preach the gospel.  You attract drunks, the homeless, broke college kids, and if your entertainment was any mark of what to expect it's no wonder why you're not busy.  Every time we have been in there it's been dead and we've been there ranging from happy hour to Friday and Saturday nights.  If someone is causing trouble in your bar, you boot them out.  The key word here is causing.  You don't assume that someone is going to start trouble ESPECIALLY when you don't know the facts and boot them out.  We were in there before and have been there before and to prove it, no one on your staff knows us by name which means we're not on their radar or they're not friendly and care not to know their customers. 

I was completely offended by that asshole assuming we came from Modern World which in my opinion is not a problem.  I didn't know you were in a position to be able to afford to kick folks out which happens every time we're in there.  At one time the bartender told  a guy last month he wasn't going to be served because he had already had some drinks.  She told him to come in sober and SHE would get him \"fucked up\" which to me means no difference.  If someone leaves your establishment and gets into trouble drunk it's not any different than someone coming in with some drinks under their belt and leaving.  People bar hop.  I have read reviews and have heard testimony from our neighbors at TTTV and they all say the same thing, you guys are quick to throw people out rather than accept the challenges that come with running a bar.  We are now going to Starters and they have better drink deals and food.

I'm an average guy with no title but \"customer\" and I expect to be treated like one when entering an establishment.  I am 38 years old and have NEVER been kicked out of a bar because I know how to behave even intoxicated.  Legally?  You're drunk after one drink.  Are you going to boot everyone after one drink?  I later established that they were wanting to go home and were closing up shop.  I think they were worried that we would stay until 2am (which I believe is posted, could be wrong) and we had no intention of it, especially after that.  I did NOT tip the bartender after she served us last night (the last round, we tipped her before we left) as I felt that she could have told the guy to cool it off since she is the one in charge.  He was so rude and after we told him we went home to get more money and we had cash in hand, he looked at us and rolled his eyes in the manner that we were lying.  Bar closed at midnight.

It would not let me cut the entire email because it was lengthy.  I don't expect to hear back.  I assume it's a prejudice bar and the staff really has a thing with who can come in and not.  They're never busy.  I wouldn't be so picky."}
{"text":"Nice little chill place! Went for an art showing, so that's pretty awesome. Happened to be 2 for 1 night, double awesome!  With tip, I got 4 beers for $8!  Tempe Tavern, our future looks bright!"}
{"text":"Food is amazing and pretty affordable. Happy hour drinks are a good deal. I like that it's located near a light rail stop. This helps to avoid drunk driving. The staff here has always been friendly. if you are sitting at a table, they do not have a waitress that comes to your table to serve you - you need to go up to the bar to order. They also have free wi-fi. They have large tables if you have a large group of people with you."}
{"text":"The bar tender was rude and was refusing to serve people. Plenty of places with better ambiance and better service nearby."}
{"text":"I was here for literally 3 minutes. Loud, jiving spot right next to the light rail. When we arrived they had a local band playing. There were also a lot of college-aged kids there, which is due to the fact that it's surrounded by apartments meant for university students. Definitely a dive bar, but seemed to have lots of character."}
{"text":"The Tempe Tavern has been nothing but an amazing experience, the enviroment and the bartender (Sarah) have made our time there amazing. The wait staff (Jess) took care of us and made us feel at home. Amazing location, great food, cheap drinks. 10 of 10 will come back for more."}
{"text":"Hi-Class dive bar, Is there such a thing? Well this is it, from more can beer brands than I can shake a stick at to good  burgers and cool building and old school decor. Plenty of TVs to find somthing to watch. Hit the happy hour, they had some two for one beers!"}
{"text":"The specials and food makes up for sketchy service. The BOGO Burger on monday nights is the best deal in town!  2 for 1 drafts and wells for happy hour everyday! Well drinks are pretty weak, so I stick to beers."}
{"text":"This place is just generally uncomfortable.   The atmosphere is dive bar, which we love, but it was a sketchy dive bar, Which we didn't like so much. (Tattoo's bikers heavy metal)

We sat at the bar for some food and Drinks. The taps were in the bartenders way, every time she served us I felt bad. She was too short to reach over it and it was painful watching her try to get us our drinks.

The food was pretty good for bar food. Fries were good the burgers were good. Nothing to write home about but great drunk munchies.

Aside from the servers obstructed view, she was pretty nice. Good service. (Except they double charged us and we had to call to get it removed) pain in the ass but whatever- mistakes happen. 

We came with the intention of eating dinner, drinking all night and listening to the band. We had our food had a couple drinks and left. Like I said, we were uncomfortable. Don't think we will be back."}
{"text":"Cool dive bar with food better then you would expect, cheap prices, lots of good priced craft and regular beer and cocktails too. They have punk bands play in the small stage in the pack and a metal caged patio in the pack since I guess this place used to be a barn. This place is probably my new go-to sleezy, cheap dive bar hang out- because sometimes you just need that vibe. Sometimes you just wanna wear a flannel and a beanie and order a bunch of cheap beers, watch the game and bullshit with another drunk at the bar- this is that place :D"}
{"text":"Chill, relaxing, cheap drinks kinda of time. It's cool if you're looking for a cheap night or somewhere to hang out with the guys at"}
{"text":"Had the wings today. They were $7 for a pound and they were good. Staff is always friendly and make u feel like a regular, even if your first time in. The staff are appreciative."}
{"text":"A dive bar with sticky tables, a seedy nightclubish decor, and a barely working air conditioner...and I can't wait to return.

There's something very welcoming about Tempe Tavern. You feel like a regular when you walk in the door--even for the very first time. The staff seemed friendly enough. They have great beers on tap, including Guinness and Four Peaks Hop Knot. And, on Mondays you can get buy-one-get-one on their burgers. Great deal too because their burgers are pretty tasty.

The actual burger patty was only \"pretty good.\" It's actually two thinner patties on top of each other. Tasty enough, and seasoned well. BUT, when you combine the patties with the other outstanding ingredients on the burger, including an awesome, locally-baked bun, well, now you have a little bit of magic. And, the fries!?! The fries are some of the best ones I've had in the entire state of Arizona...maybe the world. Not sure how they do it, but those fries are amazing.

Apparently they have music acts perform here too, but I left before all of the nightlife started. Still, judging by the food alone, I will definitely return."}
{"text":"This bar has 3 faces. Each very different.
The first is that of any bar, tvs, bar games and dim lights.
The second is of a hole in the wall bar with a stage. 
The third is a nice patio facing a park. 
One of the nice things here is they do have a few craft brews on tap, however this is not enough to hide the fact that this place is in the dive bar category."}
{"text":"Great milk stout!  Awesome food.  Perfect dive bar environment.  I tried their burger, fried zucchini, and some fries and all were surprisingly good.  Those not in the know may mistake this place for a seedy dive bar, and there are definite elements of that here.  But don't judge a book by its cover.  The Beer is cold, the food is good, and they are also known for their local music scene."}
{"text":"You know what I love most about this place? The music. It is most lively from Thursday through the weekend, in my opinion. The best part is I don't even have to go to the tavern to enjoy it, I can hear it from my apartment! It's the best when I've had a long day and they keep playing all night. So happy I live across the street from this place."}
{"text":"Their kitchen is much better than the place's format would suggest.     Whoever's back there,  good job! 

Comfortable atmosphere,  can get a little packed but that's probably because it's a kickass tavern in a young area.    UNF!!"}
{"text":"I got wasted, man, and I was well under my allotted budget for alcohol for the evening.  The drinks are made stiff and they're inexpensive so if you're looking to tie one on, this is really the place you should be going to.

Usually, when I'm tying one on at a bar and I find out that a band is going to start playing, that's like a death-sentence for my evening.  The band will play terrible music so loud that any attempt at conversation will be futile and we'll have to lean in and scream in each other's ears.  \"WHAT?!\" \"I SAID I HAVE TO TAKE A SHIT!\" \"WHAT?!\"  While we were here, a band played inside and, sitting outside, we could still hear the radio music piped out through the speakers.  It was perfect.  The band played and I still hung out and shot the shit with my buds.  I went inside for a bit and the band wasn't bad, either.  

This place, compared to other dives, is a class ACT.  There were no penises scrawled into the wall ejaculating onto a mangled vagina.  As much as I love my juvenile coital scribbles, it's kind of nice to drink without having a veiny cock penned somewhere within my field of vision.

Aaaand everyone was really nice here.  No one treated me like a dick.  I paid my tab and jumped onto the lightrail which is approximately fifty feet away."}
{"text":"This a great place to come before and after games.  Another option is come here and watch the game.  Fresh hot food.  Easy access from light rail and parking garage across the street."}
{"text":"Neat little dive bar, bartender was friendly, beer was cold."}
{"text":"My nice neighbor hood dive bar. Can always find T there and get lucky! Always great beer on tap and a,good supply of Jameson."}
{"text":"I heard heard HORRIBLE things about this place. I had head drinks were watered down, over priced and you got service with an attitude and the door guys were dicks, and that everything felt dirty there. AND YET.. i still went to see for myself.
They seem to have all male bartenders all the time, who kinda know what they are doing..waitresses on the other hand seem unfriendly and lay. I was actually asked to take a tray of drinks outside to my table cause the waitress had had a long day and was tired... no joke
 Either way- things did seem a little high priced.. like i asked for 5 of the cheapest shots and that totalled 29 bucks?.... 
I do like it tho- cute boys- dark inside.. ill be back"}
{"text":"Tempe Tavern is definitely a dive bar, but it also serves way better food than you'd expect from a spot that also serves Mike's Hard Lemonade on tap and looks more like a rock club than a restaurant.

My favorite thing to order there is the grilled cheese sandwich, a really simple sandwich (I get pepperjack cheese instead of American), with a side salad with ranch. The portion is large (the same is true for the fries if you order those), and the food is good - greasy, but good.

I'm a fan of Mike's Hard Lemonade, so I'm thrilled it's on tap here. There are also TVs throughout the bar that make it a great place to watch a game, while live music fans can enjoy concerts every night of the week after 9 p.m.

Tempe Tavern is located right across the street from a light rail stop (and next door to a sex shop.) The cheap prices and laid-back atmosphere make it a good spot for watching a game, or before heading to one on the light rail."}
{"text":"Found this little hidden gem completely by accident! Was walking to Mill Ave from my motel on Apache, and there it was shining like a beacon of Dive Bar Cheese!
It called to me with it Sirens Song, and I felt myself drawn in like a moth to a flame!
I entered and was immediately transported to Dive Bar Nirvana!
Hello you sexy beautiful bitch, daddy is home! What, you have Genesee on tap, oh you evil temptress! Plus an exceptional selection of craft beers at amazing prices, oh you are a wicked temptress!
My time here which was supposed to be just a quick beer and restroom stop turned into an all night affair!
Oh she is so evil! Great and cute BT whom I believed went by the Moniker of Sarah was outstanding!
Even the creepy dude who sat himself next to me just added to the appeal of this sweet little gem!
This is an absolute must stop if in Tempe! It was a BLAST!
And I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Why am I on Apache, enjoying a G&T, petting a bulldog, listening to Tori Amos and watching people trying to be nonchalant while they wait for the light rail?

I am enjoying the shit outta Tempe Tavern, that is what I am doin!

From the iconic sign on the side of the building, to the beautifully designed patio with rusted steel components, an actual Palo Verde tree planted inside the stone grounds with actually enjoyable to sit at high tables, the first impression is casual but surprisingly classy.

My friends were already cozied up along with 20 other people laughing and enjoying themselves in the front patio, and the security guy was extremely nice and told me there was even a patio in the front when I entered. I ordered my delicious and strong $2.50 G&T from Casey, a fantastic bartender. When back at the table, other people were laughing on the benches around us and we got to play with Molly, the rescued 80 pound bull dog and throw her crushed ice. 

When my 3rd G&T drained and singing along to all my high school 90s songs, I decided to try the food. I went for $4 fries with side of mayo and they were amazing- hand cut, def probz not veggie but my god. We had to order another round of fries (which I did with the bartender but you could opt for table service as well). They had veggie options for only $7 bucks.  Their other drink specials included 90 Shilling in the bottle for $2 bucks. 

The single stall womens bathroom was IMMACULATE. Let me stress this next statement: IT SMELLED AMAZING. Like a clean, fresh, vanilla scent with modern fixtures and a nice expensive metal trash can (when you have a snooping trash eating dog you notice these things, ok?).

A live band was playing to a packed back room and they were actually enjoyable- but you can still enjoy the throwback on the front patio.

The security guards were really diligent about any potential issues with passer-bys and the people watching was premium. The crowd was a true mix, actually diverse with an age range, genre bending, and everyone was relaxed and enjoying themselves.

I can't believe they have coffee??? I may have to come back in the morning just to get a cup o joe with the latest Barely Legal to relax on the patio before boarding the light rail!"}
{"text":"I went to a show here and the show was amazing, it made up for the gross drinks being served. I'll be back only for the entertainment. Hopefully the drinks improve."}
{"text":"I've been a handful of times honestly it's a dive Rick punk bar for local music it's a hit or miss as far as music I ordered 5 drinks last night the bill was awesome only 19.00 so that was great I don't know what the food is like so I can't say but it does pull a crowd in"}
{"text":"I like the place, in general. Very low-key, hole-in-the-wall-type place. When I went there was a cool art exhibit, but I gotta say...... the wait staff is horrible! The waitress acted like everything was on her time despite the fact that the bar was mostly empty. Ans who was she so busy gabbing with to bring our drinks? Why, the bartender of course. And even if we went to the bar to order, we had to wait just as long to get our next drink.
On a plus side, there's a sweet phone booth inside that's perfect for changing into your superhero outfit and round housing the bar staff."}
{"text":"Nice dark atmosphere with some very surprising beer choices. I've been delighted to find Rouge Hazelnut Nectar and  Oskar BluesTen Fidy to name a few."}
{"text":"When it comes to dive bars, a total gem. Good service tonight at the bar, but then, it is Monday. Great specials and happy hour. Drinks are not crappy, but pretty affordable. $2 pbrs or $5 for a tall whiskey with lime. It's got that divey feel, but it's not dicey. Plenty of good craft brews or middle of the shelf liquors. Also, it's clean."}
{"text":"this is the perfect dive bar. it's right off the light rail so if you've had too much you don't have to worry about driving. 

the service can be slow, but whenever i go it's with a bunch of friends so we're in no hurry anyway. the food is OK. it can be greasy. but honestly, i don't go there because of the food. it's a great location to hang with friends and have a great time. you never know what's going to happen while you're there. Something out of the ordinary always seems to happen. And it's next to an adult bookstore. what could be better? ;) 

as for parking, park across Apache in the parking structure underneath the apartments. make sure you park in the metro/light rail spaces. it's free."}
{"text":"I have been coming to Tempe Tavern at least weekly since I moved here a few months ago. They have great happy hour specials and if that isn't enough to bro g you back, the staff is. Most of the bartenders are genuinely cool people who can relate to their customers and take really good care of them. If you come often enough you get to see nights where they have to deal with some pretty crazy situations. Makes for a good laugh. Between Sarah dealing with a toothless cowboy who asked her to take her clothes off, and Fran slipping into a bucket and having to strip down to a tank-top (which looked like a sports bra) it's always a good time. A bar is just a place to drink, it's the people who work there that make it a great place to keep coming back to. The staff at Tempe Tavern are a pretty cool group who sometimes have to put up with a lot of BS, often as the only employee in the joint, so if you go and you have a bad experience don't be too quick to judge. The bartender on duty has probably been alone, stressed, and busy for close to 7 hours. Doesn't happen often, but it does happen. I guarantee that if you give this place a chance, you'll keep coming back."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Tonight I asked if I could try a beer and I was told no. I can sort of understand the policy but the bartender could have mentioned that she could pour me a taster for a dollar before being rude about the whole thing. The beer I did get had lipstick all over the rim of the glass. Disgusting. When my husband asked for a spoon for the guacamole the response was \"what for?\" and he wasn't given one. All this plus the problem with kicking out the transgender woman a couple years ago makes this a place to avoid."}
{"text":"I was really hoping to find a welcoming watering hole along the light rail route, so I gave this place a try.  Lots of tap handles and a few from the PacNW!  The place is old and dark with some tv's around, however, the length of the bar in front has so many tap handles that you cannot even see the bartender that you are ordering from.  Kind of odd, but oh well!  Didn't try the food, but what made me a 1 and done customer was the person in construction attire (maybe she is a flagger?).  Sitting in the corner playing a video game but in between swills on her drink or beer, she was drilling and drilling for buggers and placing them in various spots located to the corner where she was stationed.  Might be a regular, but this incessant \"nose picking\" continued non-stop during my one beer (or 12 minute stop)  I quickly checked to see if any \"gummies\" were attached to my pants or shirt and left!"}
{"text":"My new neighborhood bar.  Good beer, food (especially the Burgers), great service & live music."}
{"text":"Dive bar...I think not.

Bar that people have tended to forget...I think so.

20 years ago, this was the midpoint between my residence and ASU.  Back in the day, the drinks were strong, the food was from the restaurant on the corner or across the street at Arco.

Today, I walked in hoping to find football, food and beer.  I found a bartender and 2 other patrons.  11:15 AM, games are already on...and there are several posters touting cheap beer during games.  I ordered a PBR and asked about ordering food only to be told that the cook has not yet arrived nor called in.  

11:30 AM, I have finished my first beer and asked for a second.  Still no word about a cook.  

11:45 AM, I have finished my second beer and I am ready to pick up and go when someone breezes through the front door and announces they have arrived.  Looking quizically at the bartender, he says she's the cook.  She proceeds to take her coffee behind the bar, fix it with cream and sugar and chat with the bartender for a few minutes...then she's off to the kitchen where I presume she is getting everything turned on.

12 PM...the bartender returns and asks me if I need another beer.  Another $2 PBR is set in front of me.  The cook comes out and asks what I would like to order.  I let her know I want a pound of wings, as hot as she can make them.  She asks if I want the wings grilled and I reply that I don't care how they are cooked, as long as they are physically hot and spicy when they are put in front of me.

12:15 PM...I've polished off the latest PBR and wings have not been put in front of me.  I ask for another PBR and state that if the wings are not done before I am done with the beer, I am going to head out.  

12:24 PM...I am presented with wings.  I take a taste and ask for tabasco.  The cook asks if they are not spicy enough, and I reply that if they were, why would I ask for tabasco?  She scuttles back to the kitchen.

I've been careful to pay for each round and the wings when they are presented.  I've also been careful to tip exactly 10%, as this is not the service I would want and certainly not what I remember.

You want football, wings and beer?  You can do better than this."}
{"text":"2 stars because their food is good and beers are cold. But in the last two weeks me and a friend have tried to visit the tavern twice after 11 to take advantage of their \"kitchen open daily until 12\" which they proudly advertise everywhere. Both times the kitchen has been closed \"because they felt like it\". Waste of time."}
{"text":"The food is good but the day time rockabilly grandma bartender is horrible!! She is so rude and very inconsiderate!!  I will never go back there again!"}
{"text":"6/6/15 - Google it

They said I lied about having cancer, relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis, being on hormones and accused me of crossdressing & prostituting myself (two things I've never done) at the next door adult shop being kicked out 6 times in 2012 of which I had a goatee the entire year. That's me in the dual-pic getting treatment at Banner MD Anderson Cancer Center in March 2012, weeks after having 7 inches of my intestines removed on 1/25/12 diagnosed w/Stage 3 Carcinoid Cancer, days away from Stage 4. Two 'former' employees 'recognized' me on the news and contacted TT. Ironically, in Tempe's anti-LGBT discrimination law I made active, a merchant can claim prostitution was being conducted to get out of the complaint. Hmmm... makes one think. If I was kicked out for prostitution, where is the police record or surveillance video??? Where did those two 'witnesses' come from in just a few days??? What motivated them to contact TT and not the media or police??? Logic clearly dictates motive. I'll let you draw your own conclusions."}
{"text":"I went here on a Saturday night for the first time and had a blast.  The bar was moderately crowded and there was a live band playing.  There was an interesting mix of people and our server was very friendly.  The building is one a kind in Tempe and the menus have the story behind it.  The interior is new inside and the outdoor seating is nice as well.  I will be back as this place is fun, clean, reasonably priced, and in a great location."}
{"text":"Great little bar! I love the outdoor seating and the people watching. Great music and atmosphere."}
{"text":"I would highly suggest avoiding this place unless you enjoy being harassed and discriminated against. This place does not care about its patrons, especially the ones that are trans."}
{"text":"I am not a natzi, kkk, white supremacist but i am a trump supporter! 
Their poster on the wall said none of the above were not welcome so i left! 
Vote with your feet!"}
{"text":"Cool place! Very cozy and has an awesome vibe. Nice staff, live music a few feet away from the tables, reasonable prices. Guinness on tap."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed. Started off with a wonderful experience with our bartender 'cherie'... Whom introduced us to the honey hot wings, $3 bloody Mary's, $2beermosas and $5 margaritas. Our new waitress Frannie, who was more focused on bar backing than serving, came on the clock and decided to switch up the pour and pricing to $6 bloody Marys. My original bartender was still there and actually backed us and called out the new bartender on shift out and she insisted on fighting us about the pour and pour count. Sorry honey but I've grew up in this industry and I'm not ignorant. Frannie came over with the bottle and just poured alcohol on top of the drink to shut us up/make us happy but it was the principle. I'd been there for 5hrs just watching soccer and making conversation with our bartender and leisurely drinking on the $3 special blood Mary's they do on Saturdays. Sadly I will not be back. I have my thirtieth birthday next week and was planning on bringing a large crowd and making a huge function out of it after Cherie told me to contact the owner but I've got a sour taste in my mouth. Way to flip my my pov in a matter of minutes Frannie. I've never been so insulted by a bartender. Your co worker called you out and you insisted on fighting me and throwing my money back at me bc you didn't want to apologize or claim you were at fault. Smh. Shame on you."}
{"text":"Cool Tempe \"dive\" bar.

Good sound for a band, very cool decor.

My only complaint would be our waitress. She brought us the wrong drinks twice, from then on it was straight to the bar."}
{"text":"After a 6+ hour RV ride, we were ready to eat and drink some tasty beverages. Not busy and a live band was about ready to perform. We were seated and when the server came by to take our orders, she said that in order to open a tab we needed to surrender BOTH ID and credit card. Me thinks not. Deuces!"}
{"text":"Cold beer. Friends. Music. Its a dive bar, Literally. Get beer, hang with friends, do not judge. Because $3 beers taste better than $5 beers. They do. Nice specials. No bells and whistles. That is what this place is for. No Zagat posting in window. Just relaxed great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Tempe Tavern. What can I say?

Good: 
- I like the ambiance of the old building
- staff is incredibly nice
- they have great live and local music
- beer is cheap
- lots of TVs
- no cover
- directly across from a light rail stop
- great bar food, my patty melt was delicious

Bad: 
- smoky
- cramped
- sound isn't great
- parking lot is difficult to get into! You can only enter lot headed westbound on Apache."}
{"text":"Okay everyone, relative to this review realize I'm comparing this establishment against it's own kind, the often lauded and equally cursed, dive bar. In this specific category of bar/pubs, I found Tempe Tavern to stand out. First feature I liked, the building is the last of it's kind, built out of river stone and referred to as the White Dairy Barn, it was constructed in 1918, which means it will soon be a 100 years old, which is crazy cool! 2nd, along with cheap beer and hard liquor, often paid for with cash by what seemed like the regulars, it has an excellent selection of craft beer, both in the can and on tap and the lines are clean so you get the intended taste of the beer - places that are much nicer than this don't seem to take care of their beer lines as well as the Tempe Tavern and yes, it is served in a chilled beer glass. Next, the food, reasonably priced and OMG, it is good! I had the Juan burger with the green chili and the fresh made onion rings and it was delicious and by the way, locally made hamburger bun, not something one often sees in a dive bar. Finally, not something we appreciate as much in the summer, but this place is right off of a rail stop so you can eat, have a few drinks, and use mass transportation to get you where you need to go, even if that is a stop closer to your home where you can get an Uber ride home!  By the way, when you look at the Tempe historical site you can see that the building has been restored to its original look - at one time all the rocks were painted white so this is a renovated historical dive bar.

All kidding aside, beer selection is good, food is great and the service more than met my expectations. As with all dive bars, misunderstood within the larger bar category, I'm sure that many will have a mismatch of expectations but that is the lot of the dive bar, even when it shines within its category it will be misunderstood - for me though, I have a warm place in my heart for this establishment and oh yes, they have live music five nights a week - crazy cool!"}
{"text":"Yummy!!!! This dive bar is pretty cool! Very low key, good place to go to grab a bite or a beer. I enjoyed their Juan Pablo burger and onion rings. I couldn't believe how delicious the burger was, coming from this dive bar! I didn't expect much and was blown away! It was a 1/2 lb burger with pepper jack cheese, pablano pepper and chipotle mayo. The combination of all that together was awesomeness in my mouth! The onion rings, were not as crispy as I usually like them, but my friend downed them in about 5 seconds, so I think they were pretty tasty to him.

Cheap drinks, good food, laid back atmosphere...... fun place to go to!"}
{"text":"Typical bar happy hour food and drinks. Came with work group of about 20 and the waitress were a little overwhelmed.

This was a last minute change in venue because the group wanted to watch the World Series game. 

The food came out hot and fresh. I didn't drink this night since I didn't see a cocktail menu and wasn't feeling my vodka soda so I just had a coke.

It is a dive bar in an older building that looks like a house next to Modern World Adult Store and Arcade.  Can't miss the neighbor since the bar is on the corner and the parking lot hard to get into.

The area seems to be gentrifying with the light rail and new apartments across the street."}
{"text":"Always a highlight of our annual Light Rail Pub Crawl. This year Maddie was awesome, and even though she was the only one behind the bar and the waitress hadn't come in yet, as was constantly checking on us and keeping us well watered and fed. She went above and beyond. Now if they only brought back the 2-for-1 PBR specials..."}
{"text":"Best chicken strips and BBQ sauce around! I was quite impressed! Always the best drink prices around. I love grabbing a $5 Bloody Mary in the evening or on Sundays. And they are dog friendly which is a huge plus in my book! Tempe Tavern is a great neighborhood spot to frequent throughout the week and on the weekends."}
{"text":"I live directly across from Tempe Tavern. Do you ever watch How I Met Your Mother? Tempe Tavern is kind of like our \"McLaren's\". In fact, we call Tempe Tavern \"McLaren's\" because too many dive bars are called Tavern and it's getting way too played out.

The food quality has greatly improved and the service is decent. My 4 star rating is a bit inflated because they are dog friendly on the patio and that is HUGE plus for me. They even bring a doggy bucket of water for your pooch. Pretty badass getting drinks with your dog and then just walking back home. Just don't get hit by the light rail.

If these guys weren't dog friendly, I'd give them a solid 2.5 or maybe a 3 star because the waitstaff doesn't come to the patio very often to check up on you. Also, there are a lot of strange old people who hang out here during the day and talk about how this place was in the 80's. I guess it gives the place character.

Like the others say, the tables are kinda sticky and the place is pretty dark in general, but it's a pretty fun place to hang out especially because it's right on the light rail. I've never been to nearby Long Wong's, but I heard that they compete with Tempe Tavern."}
{"text":"Best Dive Bar in Tempe. 
2 for 1 Burgers on Mondays. 
All their food is fresh, never frozen and the bar staff is great. 
My go to."}
{"text":"Dim, gritty dive bar that ain't half bad for getting sloshed and catching a small live act. The space feels cramped, sandwiched between a difficult parking lot and the light rail. The back patio is oh-so tiny, with patrons crammed like sardines to have a smoke or take a break from loud music. PROTIP: There's seating out front. 

This tavern has an impressive beer selection...but it's all canned! Canned!? They seem to recycle them all which is super cool. On the negative, paying $4 a pop really justifies bottles of local brews like SanTan. 

So it's a decent little venue. It has a decent beer selection. The rockabilly atmosphere will make you feel cool. So while it doesn't exceed in acoustics or value, I wouldn't mind coming back to shotgun a cold one."}
{"text":"My expectation for a dive bar:
1) cheap drinks
2) those drinks staying full
3)people watching.

Tempe Tavern fits the bill.  I like the patio out front.  The bathroom is neato.  I never have trouble ordering another drink from the bar.

I have simple needs.  Tempe Tavern meets them."}
{"text":"Great little dive bar.  Food is pretty decent for bar food. Fun place to hang out while waiting for the light rail."}
{"text":"Great place for a dive bar! Bartenders are great and attentive. Good place to chill and have a good time."}
{"text":"Its awesome.  For so many reasons. Below is my attempt to adequately detail all these reasons...

There is tons of parking which doesn't totally matter to me because I can walk here and stumble home.  Its also right next to the Apache/McClintock lightrail station... and this is why Tempe Tavern is the start of my birthday lightrail pub crawl! Perfection.  

There is outside seating... in a particularly good locale for people watching.  The inside seating is really perfect too.  There is ample amounts for one thing and the entire place is just really comfortable. Makes you want to stay and hang out.  There is a stage... so apparently there must be music sometimes.  There is also a random and empty phone booth.  Rad. Not to mention the bathroom (only one stall but o well) was very clean.  

The bar itself is smack dab in the center of the place and has seating on THREE sides... it makes the bar itself feel like the most important part of the place rather than just a counter shoved against a wall... like most bars.  The bartender that night was wonderful. Really friendly and talkative (not in an annoying way at all) and suggested drinks/made up drinks for us... always something I love at bars.  

Drinks are crazy cheap.  2.50 wells I believe. This wasn't happy hour.  This is considered normal at Tempe Tavern.  They also have these really spicy hot peanuts out as bar food... pretty good.. especially with my cold cheap bottle of Stella

*I feel weird giving only four stars but I wish this place had a pool table or two*  central Tempe needs more places to play cheap pool and this place totally has the vibe for it."}
{"text":"pretty cool dive...good drinks,food and if the mood strikes a BJ next door at the bookstore..."}
{"text":"Great dive with cheap drinks and next to the light rail."}
{"text":"Tempe Tavern served me rotten lemons with my glass of water. I even sent the first lemons back and the waitress returned with more rotten lemons. Now i'm questioning my entire meal. is the meat rotten, does this bar sanitize anything? my trust in food safety for this restaurant  just went right out the door. food inspection definitely needed at this location. hopefully i dont wake up sick 2moro."}
{"text":"Came here last night for a concert. They have two areas basically with the bar in the middle. We sat on the side without the concert but could still here it just great. We had a patty melt with sweet potato fries and the BC burger which was basically a huge bacon cheeseburger with fries. Both were $9 and were a very large serving. The food was cooked great and tasted amazing. Definitely worth $9. They have several things on the menu from wings to burgers to salads. They do have a lot of misspelled things on it though like guacomole and  peper instead of pepper. But hey it's the food that counts. Service was great, and did not have any issues there."}
{"text":"The Bar is OK..the food looks better than it taste. I just want to warn anyone who goes to the T. Tavern not to make any jokes or comments about the Adult book store located just east of the establishment. 

I must have struck a nerve or something. I made, what I considered an innocent comment/joke about the bar being right next door to a Porn shop. The snotty, little, freak bartender went berserk !  She really got her panties in a bunch and probably disfigured the ugly-ass tattoo on her butt. She immediately had me escorted out. 

If you go there..Just watch what you say..I know at least one bartender there that has absolutely no sense of humor.. what-so-ever."}
{"text":"Staff is personable and welcoming, food is underrated, and their beer selection is surprisingly good. Cheers!"}
{"text":"I went here on Monday with a couple friends to use a deal I had bought. I thought this bar was just ok. When we entered we noticed it was really warm in the bar, like warmer than it was outside...which is pretty bad considering we live in Phoenix....We had a decent amount of money to spend, so we got a lot of food. The waitress (and bartender) was nice enough, but seemed a little upset that we were using a deal. Also, it was kind of strange because while we were there she spilled something on herself so her solution was to take her shirt off and walk around in her bra....and she kept talking about how naked she felt....it was pretty awkward. We tried: The hot chick, fried zuc, chicken fingers and fries, cheese crisp, and a grilled cheese. It was a lot of fried food. Anyway, the hot chick was recommended by the waitress, but in all of our opinions, it was straight up bad.... it had a really weird flavor that I can't explain. Also, I asked for mine with mayo on the side, but it was slathered all over it. All of the food was pretty meh, nothing special, especially considering they claim to use a lot of fresh and local ingredients. The cheese crisp was probably the best item of the night. I probably would not come back here to eat, but I might come back to drink! They had a lot of beers and their happy hour specials looked good."}
{"text":"Good little bar with Rogue - one of my favorite beers - on tap. Good bar food too. Check out the weekday specials and bring a friend because there's always a 2 for 1 special."}
{"text":"Great little dive bar! It has really good bar food. We tried the wings and fries and they were both good. It's a little too loud for my taste but I should have said something. Our waitress was so nice and drop dead gorgeous!"}
