{"text":"Bland food. Mongolian/stir fry is a flavorless joke! Meat looks likes been sitting there ALL DAY!  I pulled some of the frozen together beef from the bottom so I'd feel some form of safety in consuming it. No flavor and I added every sauce they offered.  Sad bar consisted of 6 dressings and half a head of lettuce.  We've been wanting to try this place since moving into the area. Wish we hadn't. It's so Gross!  Avoid this place, it's geared to much older folks that have no taste buds (no offense to the older generation)"}
{"text":"For a typical Chinese buffet, this place is pretty good compare to the price they charge. I went for lunch on a Saturday, adult price is $7.59, senior is $6.99. The selection is ok, combination of cooked food, some dimsum, Mongolian, and sushi. I didn't try the sushi, the cooked food and Mongolian filled me up. They have single serve ice cream (not soft serve). Again, for the price, I will definitely come back. You may want to try and see it for yourself."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that we are not food snobs, don't have the most sophisticated palates, and are pretty easy to please.   However, I'm not sure how there are so many 4 and 5 star reviews for this place. My wife and I went there for dinner tonight and were very disappointed.   First the good: the restaurant appeared clean, was attractively furnished, and the staff was friendly and attentive.   The bad: maybe we picked a bad time to go but almost everything was clearly old, soggy, stale, rubbery, dry, or whatever particular problem that item gets when it's been out on a steam table for hours.   The ugly: before we even left the restaurant, we BOTH had explosive diarrhea. Awful, horrible diarrhea. We compared notes and it turns out that there was nothing that we both ate there. We have pretty different tastes in Chinese food. We can only conclude that more than one of the dishes served this evening was tainted with something. Maybe this was a one time thing. We'll never know. We won't be back."}
{"text":"This place is ok. I have now been here twice. Both times the crab \"stuff\" they have looks decent in the pan/tray but when you start eating it you may find that it has the taste that its been sitting there for a while...hard parts where it should all be soft, etc. Some things are kind of bland. The soups, possibly for the lack of people going to them, have that filmy stuff that forms over soups when they haven't been touched (particularly the hot and sour soup).  Most of the food is just ok. Unfortunately, living out in east Mesa presents many issues when seeking some good but affordable east Asian food. Like in a Treehouse of Horror Episode from the Simpsons, the one where Homer accidentally creates a time machine from his toaster...when he finally thinks he's back home and see's his family eating with their lizards tounges, eh.....close enough."}
{"text":"Just ate there for lunch and we're very happy we did. Food is served in a pleasant,  quiet atmosphere.  Servers were attentive & efficient.  Price was surprisingly low for the quality & quantity of the meal.   We will certainly be back. :)"}
{"text":"Got there early and the food line was really pretty. Food tasted as good as it looked and the service was excellent. The young lady waiting tables was very attentive and made sure Our tea glasses were filled and old plates were removed promptly."}
{"text":"This is by far the best buffet in the east valley. The food is fantastic I will be eating here more often. I suggest you come in give it a try and see for yourself. A lot of the sauces that they have to put on the food is homemade. Definitely worth the trip."}
{"text":"Fuck this place no stars, food was fucking cold and I told her but she said it was a buffet. 71 dollars for fucking bullshit, left no tip and still don't regret it. Would not recommend to any family what so ever. Stick with panda!!!!!"}
{"text":"A food experience I don't plan to have again. However, the service was 4 star. Most everything tasted the same...flavorless. Smallest crab legs I have ever seen. We ate here a couple years back and everything was excellent! Must be a new chef."}
{"text":"Please hello my name is Maurice I went to eat dinner with my daughter and my son it was the worst dinner I've ever had in my life the sushi was hot the hot stuff was cold the service was ridiculous the crab legs the gentleman that brought out the crab legs put off six crabs leg and then he staring at everybody because we couldn't take more than one he wouldn't let us the place is awful it's dirty the food stinks the people are nasty and its not only overpriced but it should be close down I don't recommend it to anyone at all for any reason and good luck to whoever is there and comes out alive"}
{"text":"food selection was slim...of course the place was empty...sad for a saturday night about 5:30. most things that were out were dried out.  my friend went to use the ladies rest room & the stall was smeared with feces. when she told (who we later found to be) the \"manager\" he was very rude to her. she said it had obviously been there for quite some time so they don't check at all.  the bills comes & they not only charge $11.99 for our dinner but $6.99 for the crab legs!!! when i asked if they had them i was never told they were extra. as you can see on the picture of the sign...it's not on there at all. the \"manager\" said i should have asked!!!  i will be making some phone calls...starting with my bank on monday!!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is barely a so-so. The fried dumplings and Mongolian beef were the only foods I liked. We were one of 2 customers in the restaurant and still had to step over the same piece of fried chicken on the floor.  The two workers both looked confused when we asked if we pay before or after the meal.  Had it been $5 cheaper I would try it again, but I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Not the buffet I expected, food was sub standard and in desperate need of flavor. However, the place was clean and quite."}
{"text":"This is definitely one of my favorite Chinese buffets in the east valley. This is where my daughter and I go for our \"daddy/daughter dates\" and really, any other opportunity. The layout is very casual, but clean. The food options are fairly expansive when compared to other Asian buffets in the area. The food is well prepared and very tasty as well. The service isn't bad at all and the staff are always friendly. The only thing that I may ever complain about is that Sunday price hike, but I know that'll be found at any buffet around the valley. My favorite part about this place is that the provide sushi in their buffet and multiple choices of sushi at that! I recommend this location to anyone looking for a decent Asian eatery on a budget."}
{"text":"WARNING!!!!  Repeated ROACH issues!! People check Maricopa.gov restaurant ratings!!! You will run!!  We have come here for many years.  Twice in past few summers I felt things run over my feet in sandals at the booth. I tried to ignore. I shouldn't have. Hearing a chef hacking full of mucous upon several visits the past year we questioned if we should continue. Eww.  Service was declining, maybe the young folks felt guilty with knowing what our food may contain. The food changing, odd colors, fillers, we came less.  They had randomly closed for no reason the past couple of years, we didn't check on anything. We wished we had, but we had gone back 20x the past 2-3 yrs. Upon closing again for over a week in December 2017 and what is peak season across from leisure world, we looked them up on the county site. We knew something had to be going on. They were not closed for remodeling this time, nor any time the past 2 years from what we read they have had repeated findings of roaches in kitchen, on cooking surfaces alive and dead, many citations, reinspect ions and it keeps happening. Even if they change their name and reopen, we will never be back. Please be careful, some of us cannot risk eating diseased roaches."}
{"text":"Pretty much your standard buffet.   I asked for sweet tea as my drink and I'm not sure what I actually received.   It was brown and sugary but didn't taste much like ice tea.   But they quickly replaced it with diet soda which was fine.   As with most buffets, the food is kind of bland, but it wasn't bad.   The sushi was obviously old and not much of a selection.   I didn't try the hibachi but it looked like a good selection of chicken and beef available.  The hot and sour soup  was very thick like it had been there awhile but tasted OK.   All in all, the hot food was good but nothing to rave about.   They had a good selection of deserts and all of it was tasty.  The staff was friendly and helpful.   They were quick to remove your used plates and refill your drink.  The restaurant was nicely decorated and well lit."}
{"text":"None of the refrigeration units to keep salads, fruits, veggies cold out on the serbing floor seemed to be working. Everything we took from these areas was at room temperature or above. Don't feel safe eating here."}
{"text":"Loved sushi with cream cheese inside.  Good selections of food.  Fresh taste. Ennjiyed it."}
{"text":"Decided to give this place another try , it's been a few years since eating here... well we went at about 3:30 for lunch/dinner.... and.... it's worse than before So our bill came to $48, but when we asked what about a senior discount for our mom, so the dude said oh ok & brought over a $1 bill,  So for 3 adults, (1 a senior discount) & 2 kids, that price for the food quality was not worth it , so of course lesson learned ... we will not be back We were the only people in the restaurant & some food looked edible then others... coconut shrimp, butterfly shrimp, veggie spring rolls, veggie mei fun noodles, and cream cheese wontons were decent , but the sushi bar & the rest of their food looked old, dried & nasty The server dude was rude, didn't smile... just seemed like he was irritated to even be there"}
{"text":"I have been here previously for lunch which was average Chinese Buffet type food. Apparently they do a brisker lunch service and keep the fresh food coming. Last night 3/16/16 the food was terrible. Dried out from sitting to long. Tasteless or tasting old. I wanted to complain but my husband stopped me. After picking through for the freshest of the old food I sadly paid our 26.00 dollar bill. Next time oh wait there won't be a next time. Save your money and go somewhere else. I recommend Thai Plates by Albertsons on Broadway and Power. Small but deliciously prepared FRESH food."}
{"text":"The only thing that tasted ok was prepackaged ice cream. There were only a few customers, the place was all empty and the food tasted like old leftovers. The buffet looked empty. They put out one cluster of snow crab at a time. The seaweed salad tasted rotten. Their food is bland, old and dry from sitting for a long time. Worst buffet in the area. Will not be back and will not recommend."}
{"text":"Gross, all i can say is gross. We were in the area and I googled Chinese buffet and this place had 4 stars on google. I should have walked away when I saw that only 3 tables and customers sitting at them. Everything was either dry, cold, bland or greasy. I tried a little bit of everything and not one thing made go up for seconds. Do your self and your toilet a favor and stay far away."}
{"text":"Took my family out to eat. Food was ok. Restaurant needs cleaning especially the steam tables. Very reasonable price."}
{"text":"I give it a 5 star. They kept the Snow Crab fully stocked. The food is above average. My wife likes the buffet so we continue to return once a month. I have yet to find ANY one hot dish that is outstanding. The sushi is great.   It's always filled with crab now. Very good!!!"}
{"text":"I had a 15 percent off coupon and has seen some good reviews here on Yelp so I decided to give this place a shot. The snow shrimp, whatever that is, was delicious and some sort of wonton on steroids was wonderful. However,overall I was a bit disappointed. The broccoli and beef was tasteless and dry and the broccoli itself was mushy. I saw no hibachi at all and what they called sushi was an assortment of California rolls with 6 pieces of sashimi available. Overall I would have still enjoyed my visit had I not been visited by two live ants on my table during the middle of my meal. I called the waiter over and he killed one with his bare thumb on my table and did not wipe it up afterwards! He offered to move me and I thought it was probably just a freak thing so I stayed in the seat. Until I was visited by live ant number 2. Again the waiter came over and squashed it with his finger and did not wipe down the table. This time I asked to move to a different table. They were very polite and nice but it did not make up for the fact that there were ants on my dinner table. In the new booth I saw dead knats in the window seal which I also pointed out to the waiter. I told him I thought I was done and he brought me my check. I asked him if he wanted to do any sort of compensation for having bugs on my table and he offered me 15% off which I already had with the coupon I brought. So I asked to speak to the manager who went over and looked at the table and looked at the knats and apologized. He did not however, offer me any kind of discount. To my surprise this was totally acceptable. So I paid my tab even give a tip. My tip to you is expect unexpected bugs and expect to pay for it."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a good buffet, I think this fits the bill. It has decent variety - all the typical Asian buffet foods, as well as some stuff that isn't as common (as other reviewers have noted, the lemon chicken and snow shrimp are tasty). I was pleasantly surprised to find shell-on shrimp, which is a favorite of mine. The staff was friendly and attentive.   I have no major complaints, my biggest issue was the fried rice - not flavorful enough. Lunch buffet is around $8 so at the very least it's a good deal. I've gone twice and will come again."}
{"text":"The food was like left overs from other Chinese places and the staff was terrible. Won't b back"}
{"text":"I do not know how this place has a 5 star rating, only reason I went here, but clearly just friends of the owner doing reviews, first Chinese buffet where I didn't finish at least half of my 2 plates, sushi was horrible and everything else was either old or gross, best item was the rice, I'll stick to Panda Express where I've never been disappointed"}
{"text":"I have been a fan of the Pacific Seafood Buffet in Chandler for years and was excited to hear about a new competitor in Mesa!  My wife and I tried them out a few days ago, a good piece out in east Mesa.  It was a Friday evening about 6pm and I expected them to be very busy but they were almost empty.  They are located close to the local retirement community and mostly seniors were eating there.  It's clean and bright and service is attentive.  The staff regularly refreshed the food trays and someone was always sweeping the floor.  The food area was about half the size of Pacific Seafood and their sushi section was a lot smaller. We went there especially for the sushi and were a bit disappointed at the variety.  The sashimi was fresh and basically salmon and tuna, tasted very good but a lot of the sides we enjoy were lacking.  The rolls were nice, 3 different types.  No nigiri, no kimchi, no various Japanese salad items were to be found.  I thought the hot and sour soup didn't have much flavor or heat like that of PSB. The steamed salmon didn't have much taste.  The best hot seafood dish there was wonderful tiny \"Snow Shrimp\".  The sesame balls were dry and practically empty and the soft ice cream was rather icy. The lemon chicken was tart and dry.  I'm sorry to say I won't be back.  The food overall was rather mediocre.  At least it was several dollars less than my favorite PSB.  This kind of food becomes a very personal taste and I think you should give them a try, you just might like it like many have!!!"}
{"text":"This place is getting worse! The food is bland and is rarely full! The guy working today is rude , never smiles and isn't friendly! Refused to give my mom a senior discount  Beware !!!"}
{"text":"I can't believe this place has gotten good reviews. Everything I tried is old, dry, tasteless and cold. The \"sushi\" is rice and cream cheese. The soup is lukewarm. The service is horrible. Bonus to the cook in the kitchen LOUDLY hacking up a few lugeys. If we're lucky, they didn't go in to the food. I've had mediocre Asian buffet plenty of times, but this is just BAD. And BAD isn't a word that can do it justice. This place stands out glaringly as far and away the worst buffet of any kind that I have ever experienced. If you must eat here, go for the Mongolian bbq. It's the only way you'll get something hot and somewhat fresh."}
{"text":"Yum yum yum! Great food, fresh and tasty. Great staff and clean restaurant. The macaroons are to die for!"}
{"text":"If you love yourself, don't do it. If you don't love yourself than you better hope your insurance covers for major major diarrhea after eating here."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I stopped in last night.  Very good buffet!!  Every item we tasted (which was many) was perfectly cooked.  All hot items were kept hot.  There were so many things to choose from. The servers were amazing.  Got us our drinks and kept the coffee hot for my boyfriend.  Very friendly and on top of everything.  The restaurant is very clean.  We definitely recommend this restaurant and will be back."}
{"text":"I stopped in the Asian Star Buffet the other day to get a few items to take out. I got some green beans, broccoli in sauce, fried squash and a couple chicken teriyaki. I rarely eat meat and these looked ok at first, but apparently they were sitting all afternoon and I swear, I don't think this was chicken. Does anybody know if this could have been some other meat? I was afraid to eat it after one bite, so I gave it to my dogs and they liked it, lol.. The veggies were ok but they didn't have much of a taste. Then later on, I got sick, and I rarely get sick! And this was the only change in my routine. I noticed another review from someone who also got sick after eating here, so I strongly suspect it was the food. So don't go here! If you're looking for a buffet in Mesa, I recommend the Old Country Buffet."}
{"text":"So super gross. Seaweed salad was slimy. Every sushi roll was cucumber and cream cheese, each had an avacado or sesame seeds atop, but no fish. Nice staff, but would NEVER go back."}
{"text":"We went for a cheap Asian buffet.  It was 2pm when we arrived.  2 patrons in a booth. It otherwise empty.  That should have been our tip off.  Food bins were half full and had been sitting untouched.  There are several things to choose from but most everything seemed to lack flavor.  It is ok if you are really hungry especially the price.  I might go again at the height of a meal hour."}
{"text":"I'm all about rating based on expectation and my expectations when it comes to chinese buffets is not to have 5 star quality food in every category. However this place is decent to delicious in pretty much ever food I tasted. It's so nice to go to a buffet and have everything taste like it's supposed to taste. I don't live anywhere near here but will for sure check it out again!"}
{"text":"First of all, I am not a huge fan of the Chinese buffet. Any chinese buffet...any buffet, really. We happened to be driving by and J wanted to stop for lunch. We hadn't been here in a million years, so we stopped.  It was right at opening, and though we were seated, there was no food out. Ok, weird. One employee began running back and forth, putting out small trays of food. My first thought was that they must not get a weekend lunch crowd for the small amounts of food they put out. My second thought was that the sushi and other items that were plastic-wrapped must have been made yesterday.   I had an inari, a piece a sushi roll, rice noodles, two sesame red bean balls, some seaweed salad, and dumplings (one steamed, one pan fried). The inari was just ok, nothing to write home about, and the rice had no common rice vinegar sweet flavor. It also had seaweed salad on top, and no sesame. Different. The other piece of fake crab roll I had was awful. The rice was overcooked and super mushy, like paste. Both dumplings were rubbery, and the steamed one wasn't sealed. The filling was ok, for a mystery meat. The rice noodle had nothing in it. No onion, no veggies...no flavor. The one thing I can eat all day are those darned sesame balls. I do love me some sweet bean paste!  J took a risk and had an oyster. He's still with us, so it was ok, even if they were warm and not iced. He had some wonton soup, coconut shrimp, and bbq pork that he seemed to enjoy. Mushrooms weren't cooked, in the chicken with mushrooms.  They were missing some standard American Chinese stuff that I do like, such as egg foo yong. And there was no one present at the hibachi to stir fry. For dessert, I had a macaroon and some peaches and pineapples. All ok. J skipped dessert.   The young gal that brought us drinks was nice, amd fairly attentive. We didn't have a bill when we finished though, and went up front without one. I also forgot to add that when you walk in, it smells sour and stale/musty. Maybe the old carpet? Not sure, but we won't likely return to this buffet."}
{"text":"The ambience was like North Korea the food was like leftovers the staff was like some kind a North Korean prison I will NOT be back, my prediction is this place to be out of business by Christmas or before"}
{"text":"I kind of wonder what people expect when they go to a buffet. 5 star restaurant quality food? Get real. I have been coming to this buffet for about a year now and have been about 6 or 7 times, I'd say. Always at lunch, as my work is nearby. I've never once been disappointed. The food is always hot (almost too hot, I always burn my mouth on the miso soup), and it's surprisingly fresh for the time I come (between 2 and 3 PM). I mean come on people, first rule of buffets: don't expect fresh food if you show up at off-peak hours. But even then, this place does okay. As a pescetarian, they have lots of fish and veggie options to choose from. And yes, I eat all the weird fish dishes they offer, and no, I've never gotten sick. It's a buffet; the food is not extraordinary. You'd be foolish to expect it to be. But it's perfectly decent. This place is clean, quiet, and undoubtedly meets expectations. Service is typically prompt and attentive, and prices are low. No complaints from me."}
{"text":"Food was gross and cold, Both me and my boyfriend got sucks after eating here. Bathrooms were gross. And buffet area wasn't that's clean, with only one other table there you would think they'd be able to clean it up."}
{"text":"This place is brand new so the area is still really clean. Is it weird that I noticed that first? Anyway, we were seated quickly and the waitress was nice and spoke Chinese (we spoke Chinese back don't worry.. the point I'm making is that there is a high degree of authenticity here).  Food looked fresh and delicious and not like it had been sitting out for a long length of time. Everything was delicious but they get 5 stars for excellent sushi and oysters. There oysters are seriously good quality for the price. I'd expect o pay $10 for a half dozen.   So if you like fresh seafood, this is the place to go. Everything else here is just pretty good and standard buffet food but the seafood gives it 5 stars and makes it better than Pacific Buffet."}
{"text":"This place was disgusting. Ate here about a month ago after a movie. 7:00pm or so on a Wednesday. Should have noticed when there were 2 tables in the place but figured I'd give it a try. Selection was decent. The food on the other hand was inedible and after two bites I got up to pay and leave. Not 5 minutes into my visit, you would think the cashier/manager would have asked if everything was ok but instead sheepishly took my money. Might have tried again at a more busy time when the food was more fresh but 25 for two and neither my girlfriend nor I had but a couple bites with no concern as to why that was. I didn't think I had to voice my disdain but avoid this place at all costs. That was completely unacceptable. How can someone in their right mind take my money when it was obvious that I was extremely unhappy with my experience in their establishment?"}
{"text":"The place is clean and quiet and mostly empty. Server did not smile or give a greeting like \"welcome\". Not many choices and honestly the food is so so. The check was put on the table while I was still eating and that made me feel like I need to leave. After I finished and was paying the bill which was quickly snatched up and placed back without a \"thank you, come see us again\" or anything.  Next time i think I'll go to Taco Bell which is nearby and cheaper.  If you want your business to succeed, you need to be more courteous to your patrons."}
{"text":"This is the second time I have visited this buffet. It has been very good each time. Everything is always fresh and hot. The lemon chicken is sensational. The snow shrimp (coconut shrimp) is nicely flavored and the shrimp cooked perfectly.  The hot and sour soup is decent. Overall for the price a great deal."}
{"text":"Loved the quality fresh food. All delicious and a very nice staff! Will make this place my regular go'to restaurant. Really great price for all you have to choose from! It's so nice to have this new place in Mesa. A++"}
{"text":"The food is amazing as well the service. Im not a big fan of their mushrooms nor shrimp. Im not one to judge on fish because i find it disgusting. Very elegant and tasteful place. Great for the family or yourself!"}
{"text":"I'm new to the area and was looking for a new Chinese buffet. I stopped in here this afternoon and really enjoyed it. The staff was fairly friendly. The place was clean and simple. The food was hot and well stocked. They had a lot of options and several things i hadn't tried or wasn't used to seeing on a buffet. I really liked the sesame chicken and snow shrimp. The spring rolls and  lo mein were so-so. The fried was very bland and tasteless. Might as well has been plain rice. But all in all I was satisfied and will return."}
{"text":"Awsome! Best buffet yet! Very attutive staff, very clean booths,tables, bathrooms and walls. Staff is constantly bringing out fresh food even if the tray is not empty. Food quality is also great typical asian menu with better quality."}
{"text":"Three stars for take out everything was good but the did not have food items that stood out when I hit up Buffet's I always try to find something that the next does not have staff were nice over all their good"}
{"text":"Terrible. Just terrible.  No flavor. The only thing good was deep fried dough balls in sugar. The snow shrimp was good. Overall if I could give it 0 stars I would. Barf."}
{"text":"In my experience,all chinese buffets start out good and then deteriorate,like the previous occupants of this space.These folks are new and ,right now ,they are VERY GOOD. They were not busy ,and normally ,that being true ,I'd drive by,but I pulled in.Seated right away,staff seemed engaged.Priced moderately for lunch .Large Sushi display and Mongolian grill ,neither my thing so no comment .The rest was very good,all the standards ,the only fail being the egg foo young(flavorless,even with gravy) I like condiments and the hot mustard had more heat than the wasabi,strange but true.Staff clears away debris right away,and the carpet is still clean.I hope they get busy and stay good.Right now I'd return and recommend.BTW,even though the restaurant was lightly populated ,they had a steady stream of take out customers,so I'm not the only one that thinks they are doing good stuff right now ."}
