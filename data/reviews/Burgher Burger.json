{"text":"Let me start this review by saying that I'm spoiled; my goto burger place in Western Pa is Tessaros in Bloomfield.   With that being the case, I measure every burger restaurant against them.  This is not Tessaros, but it is probably the best burger place in the Irwin area and on top of that, they are open on Sunday night!   I had a good burger and what looks like home cut fries there and it did not disappoint.   I'll have to work my way thru the menu the next time I visit."}
{"text":"Great place!  If you like a burger that is both classic and creative, this is the spot."}
{"text":"This was the best burger I've had in a very long time.   This place had amazing food served by wonderful wait staff.   The Food was hot and delicious.   Recommend this little side street gem!"}
{"text":"Had high expectations after learning this would be the same ownership as my beloved do wood pizza. Unfortunately my experience was not a love at first bite as their pizza. Got the fries with cheese and bacon as an appetizer and they were really lacking. Not a big helping and the fries tasted burnt. Got a burger and it was not good, did not even finish it. Overall good service but won't be back."}
{"text":"The burgers here are huge and delicious! Every burger on the menu sounds awesome and I cant wait to try them all. Very reasonable prices also"}
{"text":"Come hungry! This is not your average burger place. Same ownership as D? Wood Fired Pizza. Also BYOB.   Each burger comes with two patties and a plethora of toppings! From the The Caruso Burger with Fresh Mozzarella, Pesto, Tomato and Balsamic drizzle to the Junkman burger - which has everything but the kitchen sink on it! We were here on Friday and came back on Sunday!  Amber was our waitress both times and always great service and a pleasure!"}
