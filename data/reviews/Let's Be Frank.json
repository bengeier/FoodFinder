{"text":"So I work around College and Spadina and there are a couple of good options around for food (read Clubhouse Sandwich Shop, Fancy Franks) but I'm not one to eat at the same place everyday. Fancy Franks is good but it's a bit far to walk in -20 plus wind chill kind of weather. I had recently noticed that Let's Be Frank had opened up and liking hot dogs, I checked out their menu by the door. It seemed okay but I wasn't overly impressed (I'm sure the rundown looking outside played a part.) So at least twice, I contemplated checking it out but didn't. 

Working late tonight, I needed a break and some liquid relaxation. I was on my way to Red Room and noticed that Let's Be Frank is licensed. In the dark of night, I was able to see inside and saw that the interior was completely renovated and looked quite inviting. I went in for a drink over some work and ended up ordering a hot dog (Katsu) and a mac & cheese (because the one the bartender / server was having looked good) . @&#$%* What had I been missing out on? This place's dogs are better than Fancy Frank's, without a doubt. 

A pint of Beau's Lug Tread and a kick ass dog? Sold!"}
{"text":"Have been there 3 times.  First 2 times where good with lots of food, or wouldn't of been back.
3rd time the veal tasted funny and was tough, and both of us came down sick after only eating half each of our veal sandwiches."}
{"text":"Ok first off, the staff is amazing.  Super attentive and also hilarious. 

Great beers on tap,  mostly beau's but lots of other locals I'm canvas add well. 

Finally,  the dogs are great and totally open to customization.  I got a corn dog,  which usually comes on a sick,  on a bun instead and added pulled pork and our was exactly what I wanted. I would marry this establishment.  

Be nice to the staff they rock"}
{"text":"I've been to this place twice now and have yet to have a bad experience. The cheese fries are killer and you get a huge portion for just $5! I'd definitely recommend this restaurant-bar to anyone looking for a delicious bite or a craft brew."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch before a meeting. The restaurant itself has a really cozy dive feeling to it--booths, a small bar, and vinyl playing over the speakers. Would be great for a laid-back first date, hanging with friends, or just grabbing a meal in a laid-back environment. 

I was the first one in for lunch (I arrived 10 minutes after they opened) and ordered a deep fried dog wrapped in bacon, and topped with cheese and hot peps, with a side of fries. 

The service was exceptionally quick and friendly. I chatted with my server (the owner, maybe?) about old tv shows and the diner/dive scene in the USA. Super friendly dude. 

My food came out a few minute later. The dog was perfectly cooked and tasted awesome. The only minor complaint I have about my visit is that though the fries are clearly home made and have great flavour, they aren't nearly crispy enough (needs hotter oil temp, or to be soaked in water first, perhaps?). 

Overall though, for the vibe, great service, and quality of the food--all for just ~$10--I can't recommend this place enough if you are near the university and want to grab a quick bite. Beats going to any of the chains nearby. 

Side note: I only had water, but it looked like they had a nice selection of beer from local breweries."}
{"text":"Best gourmet hot dogs!   I wanted to try different flavours so I got 4 sliders: katsu, Korean bbq, Mac daddy, and pulled pork.  They were all pretty good but Korean was by far my favourite...it came with kimchi, sriracha mayo, and a fried egg on top.  It was quite flavourful! I'm definitely returning to try the other hot dog options!"}
{"text":"I had a great time at Let's be Frank. I had the katsu dog and the Mac daddy - both were awesome! The service was also very good! Will def be back."}
{"text":"I ordered the mac n cheese which seemed to be noodles mixed with shredded cheese, no bacon. The two kids in the kitchen must've not been feeling like making my dinner properly? Not only that but they were rude when i came in to pick up my order."}
{"text":"Steamies, wings and fries... Absolutely Amazing! Montreal poolroom is my standard and though different, the steamie was so delicious! A top sliced bun would put it over the moon. Fries and wings were both super fantastic (esp homemade ranch)! I've never written a review before but this was really worth it!"}
{"text":"I'm not a big hot dog fan so I was a little sceptical of the hype for this place. Despite my assumptions it was actually really good. Miles ahead of those Fancy Frank's places that keep popping up. I had the po boy, which had some delish pulled pork on it. You can tell they make an effort here to do a good job with the food. I also thought the collection of vinyl they had in the front people could play was a nice touch.  Overall I was pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"Today I got the Kimchi hotdog. Best hotdog I've had. Great atmosphere, good food, relaxed servers. Lots of cool options. Quick service. My girlfriend got the Mac and cheese hot dog which I tasted and it was great as well. Would definitely go again."}
{"text":"Great veggie dog. Free fries with yelp offer. Fries with Lowrey's Seasoning Salt. Going there on Live Band with Heavy Metal at the entrance to the restaurant was a bit awkward."}
{"text":"Had the Mac and cheese dog w bacon. The dog was perfect, the Mac and cheese was alright. Fries were sweet with a special dry sauce. Great atmosphere inside."}
{"text":"Fresh buns, sandwich quality was good- had the veal sandwich , my wife had the eggplant. They don't come with any toppings at all though. Seriously, almost a buck for some onions on a sandwich??? That's pretty chintzy. Overall it's ok...about the same as San Francesco's or California's etc."}
{"text":"I wasn't expecting much when we walked in, we just wanted some food, after waiting at another restaurant for an hour and half for our food (never got it). I'm glad we walked in though. The Southern Fried Chicken Sandwich! TRY IT. My boyfriend had the pulled pork sandwich, which the enjoyed."}
{"text":"Went for lunch last week and I'm really glad that I did!

First off, they serve Nathan's Famous hot dogs here, which are pretty much the de facto standard for American hot dogs for the last 100 years.  It's not often that you see Nathan's in Canada, so this is nice to see.

Second, they steam their dogs, which only means that they are serious about sticking with hot dog tradition.

I ordered the Coney Island dog (chilli, onion, mustard) and it was amazing.  The chilli was so perfect, it was thick and meaty and did not make the bun soggy at all.

I will definitely be going back and I encourage others to try it, even if only to experience what serious hot dog connoisseurs would consider perfect execution."}
{"text":"Love this place. Best Pogo's and Mac and cheeses. My son loves it and so did I. Best music. All played on vinyl. Service was outstanding. Thanks Cassidy. Definitely be back."}
{"text":"Let's Be Frank is a super cool place to go for a decked-out hot dog. 

They have a hot dogs with all kinds of toppings and other foods if hot dogs don't tickle your fancy. 

When I first walked in, Folsom Prison Blues was playing and my initial thought was, \"what a spot on music playlist!\"

As it turns out, there is no 'playlist'. They have a whole shelf filled with record players and a turntable! You can pick your own vinyl and have it play while you down your dog. 

I shared the small chili cheese fries, a pound of chicken wings, Tiajuana Danger Dog and the Korean BBQ hot dog with my SO. 

We managed to finish all of it (I have NO idea how) because the portions were pretty generous. 

The Tiajuana Danger dog was wrapped in bacon, deep friend, and topped with guacamole and shredded cheese. It was good, but the real MVP was the Korean BBQ dog. 
It was topped with siryacha mayo, kimchi, scallions and a fried egg. May sound like an unlikely combo but it was sure good. The hotdogs were delicious, but if they had lightly toasted the bun, it would've taken it that one step further!

The chicken wings could have been better. At $11 they were steep compared to the the other items on the menu. You got the WHOLE wing. Drum, flat and tip. Since we got 3 whole wings each and you can't eat the tip, I didn't think it was much bang for your buck. Sure they came with ranch dip, celery and carrots but those wings were the weakest link. 

Last but not least the chilli cheese fries were...well MASSIVE! We ordered small and it was quite a large size, especially after all that food. 
The cheese sauce tasted quite sweet...the flavour was akin to coconut oil. Maybe that is why they were offsetting but I've had better chilli cheese fries elsewhere. They were still good, but just not the best. 

Our waitress was pretty awesome. She advised us to order the fried chicken but we decided against it last minute. There were two other couple with us in there but the food took long to come. 

If you decide to come here, stick with the hot dogs and try the fried chicken."}
{"text":"I took my dad here for his birthday lunch. We both had a corn dog and a piece of Nashville chicken. The batter on the corn dog was crisp and the hotdog was juicy and flavourful. As for the chicken it was nicely spiced and cooked perfectly. This place is definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"Amazing!!! I could eat at this place every day. Delicious and unique hot dog combinations!"}
{"text":"This is a REALLY hard one to rate.  

Cool laidback place, seems great to hangout (maybe too laidback?)  Everything had just gone wrong with our order!  We showed up on a day they had some special \"spaceballs club\" event.  

I've been to Nashville and I have tasted all the great temples of Hot Chicken there.  I was beyond excited to find a place that had it here.  We came in and asked for the owner to ask him about his recipe and which Hot Chicken place it most closely resembled and how the levels of heat compare to known places in Nashville.  Disappointingly, he was not there, AND his staff member had no idea what we were talking about it.  His only descriptive term was that \"it was really hot\".  He's never been to Nashville. Excitement meter went from 10 to 8.

We ordered a single piece of hot chicken to go to try.  No one told us the kitchen was backed up.  We checked at 35 min, they said it was coming out soon.  Excitement meter down to 6.  But, no one told us it would take OVER AN HOUR???  C'mon people I don't have an hour of my life to waste for this.  If you had been straight up with me I could have gone grocery shopping, watched half a movie, or even eaten a WHOLE sit down meal in the neighbourhood before coming back.  Excitement meter down to 5.

I open the box, when I get back.  Damn.  It was the wrong order.  Excitement meter down to ZERO.  It was a hot chicken sandwich. (4stars for flavor) It was a very tasty sandwich, but not what I ordered.   (Now it makes sense why it was so much more expensive than expected).  But, really to fry 2 boneless chicken strips took you guys an hour???  I really still want to try the Hot Chicken I had come there for, but once bitten twice shy?  No one likes being let down."}
{"text":"I was going to give them 4 stars, but then the bartender played a Fleetwood Mac record! Amazing!

We'll start with the best: hot dog sliders. We had the coney dog, super steamie, and Korean bbq dog. They were so damn delicious. Just getting hot dogs next time!

The fries were good, but we also got the fried chicken sandwich. It was just okay and a bit dry overall. Service was great too. It wasn't busy at all for a Friday night, which was surprising. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"The Nashville Hot Chicken was ok but the mild flavour touted as still way spicy was not really at all... It tasted like it was coated in grocery store chili powder. Nashville Hot Chicken should not taste of cumin. I also had a Mac Daddy dog which would have been good had it not arrived so hot that it burned the roof of my mouth.

The worst part of my visit was the restaurant space itself. Think grimy garage with no AC. Now imagine being there on a day with a 39 degree heat index.

This place needs to get its act together."}
{"text":"I came here with my sister for some jazzed up franks! 

We ordered the Doritos Taco dog and the large Mac & Cheese to split, she ordered a Korean BBQ slider dog, and I ordered the Katsu slider dog. She wanted to try the Mac Daddy dog, but I figured we just order the Mac & Cheese on it's own instead.

I have to say I was really excited about the Doritos one, but it didn't do anything for me. I did however really enjoy the Katsu dog and would definitely come back and order a bigger size of this one. The wasabi mayo was excellent and definitely shined! My sister didn't seem overly impressed with the Korean dog and wants to try the Katsu next time. I thought the Mac & Cheese was delicious and since I do love BBQ sauce, it really worked for my taste buds. 

I love the different size options so you can try different ones until you find your favourite or favourites. ;)"}
{"text":"Food: 
Ordered sliders of katsu dog, korean bbq dog, and the tijuana danger dog. Out of the three, our favorite was the korean bbq dog. The katsu dog was great, but the tijuana danger dog was just ok. 

We also ordered the hot dog gravy poutine and the mac & cheese. Being a poutine addict, I had high hopes for the poutine when I saw picture of it on Yelp. They actually used cheese curds, which is a big plus vs other place in toronto that use shredded cheese. No complaints about the fries, but the gravy was a little odd - it's extremely buttery and thin without a lot of flavor.  

The Mac and Cheese on the other hand was AMAZING!!! Big portion for the price. So creamy and combines perfectly with the bbq sauce and bacon bits. The bacon bits were unique and had a really nice smokey flavor. Usually I'm apprehensive about ordering mac and cheese but so worth it. 

Service:
The service started off great. The server greeted us promptly after arrival. However, once his shift ended and the next server took over, the restaurant got packed, and the service was non existent. The place was understaffed so I wouldn't blame it on the server. 

Price:  
The food is worth the price and towards the cheaper side of the spectrum. The mac and cheese, and poutine was huge for $5.

Ambience: 
It feels more like a bar than a cozy joint. Loud music and dim lighting. Overall fun atmosphere for a night out. And I loved the GIANT HOT DOG DRAWING on the wall!!!!

Parking: 
There were only a few parking spots on the street, we went earlier (around 7 p.m.), so it was easy to find a parking spot. But I'm sure there's a parking lot a few streets down by Kensington market."}
{"text":"We had the corn dog, po'boy and coney dog. I'm not impressed at all. The bun was a wonderbread-type of cheap hot dog bun  that would get supper soggy. The toppings were all subpar. Heck even the dirty street dogs are better than this.

Their fries were overly oily and soggy too.

I have yet to find a good hot dog in Toronto."}
{"text":"After reading the other stellar reviews on this place, I was not disappointed! Great atmosphere, and along with the cozy interior design and lighting, the warmth of listening to vinyl albums with their lull of 25 minutes or so of spike-free continuous analog vibes made it easy to sit there relaxing. (One side of a record is about that long!) And there's even room by the rekkid player to get up and dance, if the drinks and tunes move you to do so.
Drinks were perfect and served promptly, a nicely spiked caesar and a new release from Beau's went well together as always and the wings were good too.
I ordered the wings with Frank's hot sauce, nice and spicy good, and the wings still had the wing tips on them which made them seem home made instead of out of a freezer bag.
I didn't try a hot dog yet, but the best part was the deep-fried desserts, wow amazing!
The deep-fried Oreo cookies were fantastic! Worth checking out."}
{"text":"I like the new renovated space, much more spacious. my family and I really enjoyed the steak sandwich and the veal sandwiches there, too good! 

Although now they are starting to charge for each topping added, I really live coming to Frank's for food but at 35$ for 3 veal sandwiches plus 2 toppings each...it's kinda insane. I remembered before their renovations when the topping would be free. 

It is good but at the price I am find another spot to satisfy my Italian craving."}
{"text":"A-ok!  The hot dog was really tasty and juicy.  The toppings were a heaping mound of goodness!  I do have to admit it was a tad on the salty side but I'm pretty sensitive to sodium.  All of the hotdogs were freshly prepared to order."}
{"text":"Got the Chicken sandwich, my friend got the large mac and cheese and we shared some fries and onion rings. This place is all about comfort food, and man do they ever do a great job of it, the chicken sandwich was REALLY good, i thoroughly enjoyed it, the fried chicken sammy was perfectly seasoned and crispy, maybe slightly overdone, but i liked it that way. The mac and cheese was \"EXCELLENT\" so says my best friend,  the fries were fresh made and very crispy, and the onion rigs were dirty, greasy goodness as well, i mean who makes home made onion rings anymore?... soooooo good... 

Overall this place was surprisingly great, i will definitely eat there again. bring a defibrillator, you'll need it."}
{"text":"Their hot dogs are TO DIE FOR! Soooo very very good. I love their fries too. You gotta try the poutine...they make it with hotdog gravy! soo good! 

The environment is quite nice, plus they serve alcohol which is a nice bonus. :) You gotta eat here!"}
{"text":"First things first the chicken Parmesan Sandwich is amazing. They have great toppings to add to your sandwiches  and you should try the pasta as well. Not cheap but a great treat. They have recently been under renovations to expand and I can't wait until they reopen."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Fresh homemade selection with delicious tasting food. I've been here a few times and never disappointed. Popped in just now for an espresso and the owner didn't even charge me. That's customer appreciation.!"}
{"text":"If walking in and not being impressed enough to stay or even ask questions then this is a review. Sorry, not impressed. Seems like a limited selection of food and it didn't look appetizing to me. No one greeted me nor even smiled but did noticed that I had entered. Left and most likely will not return."}
{"text":"College and Spadina seems to have become land of the hot dog. Let me help you make your decision: CHOOSE LET'S BE FRANK! They're the best option! I had the Doritos Taco Hot Dog, large sized. It was amazing. I did takeout and it was the most enjoyable takeout of all time. The hot dog was so well put together and the taste, disgustingly delicious. Everything you ever wanted in a hot dog. They are often empty and that's brutal because this is going to be a go-to for me from now on. Yes, it is THAT GOOD."}
{"text":"Was looking to buy lunch on a Sunday afternoon to reward myself for completing a project. As I was browsing through the options in Yelp, I noticed that Let's Be Frank had an offer for free fries with every check in, and who could not resist free food?

So I went in to Let's Be Frank, and ordered a Mac n Cheese, Katsu dog and the free fries, obviously. There was only one server present, but the store wasn't busy at that time. She was really friendly and made me feel welcomed to the store. 

The food came in less than 10 minutes, which was quicker than what the server told me. Hence I can say that the service has been fantastic.

Now to the food , the Katsu dog was first off heavenly. The sauces and spices on it, combined with the panko covering of the hot dog, makes the taste of a simple hot dog be heavenly. Comfort food got elevated to a different level.

Next about the Mac and cheese, there was just a perfect amount of cheese on top of it and the bacon bits and spring onions added onto such a great flavour to the simple Mac and cheese dish.

The fries were alright, but overall Let's Be Frank has this amazing ability to elevate comfort food to a higher palette, and that too at an affordable price.

I would definitely recommend people to try out this place."}
{"text":"I was really sceptical about trying this place ... I mean, it's a hot dog right?

Nope. It's the best hot dog. I tried the one with mac & cheese on it. I originally ordered the slider (the mini version) but the waitress talked me into the regular size. It was piping hot, the mac & cheese was great, and the bbq sauce totally made the difference. (But for the record, the smaller size would have been fine.)

I also tried the poutine with hot dog gravy which was pretty good but I didn't love it. But the spice that they use on the fries is awesome."}
{"text":"Got the Tijuana Danger dog. For $10 I got a really salty, cold breaded, hot dog with minimal un-melted cheese.  It was pretty disappointing and I doubt I'll be going back. Save yourself the money an get some street meat."}
{"text":"The newly opened hot dog bar at College and Spadina, Let's Be Frank, serves up gourmet franks with bold flavours and ingredients. I was invited to sample their inventive hot dogs and after doing so, I don't think I can ever eat a regular hot dog with plain ketchup and mustard again. The humorously named menu items include The Dogfather, Tijuana Danger Dog and Mac Daddy, which are all unique and tasty. 

A gourmet hot dog bar is a rarity in Toronto and the owners have certainly found a welcomed niche with their menu offerings. Let's Be Frank's hot dog are sizzling hot! The meat lovers will enjoy the pulled pork po'boy, which is a hot dog topped with slow-cooked pulled pork, tangy coleslaw, zesty homemade barbeque sauce and hickory sticks. They hit it out of the park with their scrumptious katsu dog. The crispy panko crusted, deep fried hot dog with wasabi mayo, sesame barbeque sauce and green onions is inspired by Japanese flavours and is among my favourite. 

The classic corn dog is simple, yet fresh, chewy and evokes memories of my summertime childhood. Spicy bite-sized hot dog wings are a take on Buffalo style chicken wings that are accompanied with a tangy blue cheese sauce for dipping. The hot dog bites are breaded, fried, and tossed in Buffalo sauce.

Side dishes include creamy mac & cheese topped with bacon bits, Southern Blues BBQ sauce and hot dog gravy poutine. The seasoned fries are topped with gravy and fresh curds from Kensington Market's Cheese Magic store.

I sampled 3.5 inch sliders of each hot dog, and they also come in the 6 inch regular and 8 inch big dog sizes. Let's Be Frank uses Nathan's Famous beef hot dogs and Silverstein's buns. You can request to replace your hot dog bun with a bed of fries, which is quite enticing. If you're not ready to take a bite out of these novel hot dogs, you can opt for the Naked Dog, without any of the fancy fixings.

For dessert, I had the Ivana banana dog, which is a deep-fried banana with peanut butter, jelly & Nutella. I am told that this dessert dog is a very popular choice with kids. It is crispy, warm, melt-in-your-mouth goodness!

Let's Be Frank aims to be a fun destination, where you can bring your own vinyl on Tuesdays and listen to your favourite tunes while indulging in tasty treats with family and friends. With patio season just around the corner, Let's Be Frank will be opening both their front and back patios soon, which can accommodate 30 people each. If you think hot dogs are boring, think again. Visit Let's Be Frank, eat one of their hot dogs and let that myth be quickly dispelled!

{"text":"Popped in for a super late lunch and catch up with a friend. I got the 6\" Katsu Dog. My friend got the 8\" Corn Dog. Hers looked exactly like a corn dog from a fair/carnival. Mine was delicious, although my only complaint was I found it a bit too salty. We also shared a small Mac and Cheese bowl with the bacon on the side. It was topped with a BBQ sauce. I liked the mix, however, I wish the cheese part was less watery and more cheesy (less Kraft and more pizza like if that makes better sense haha).

Overall, the atmosphere is casual and fun. The food is good and the prices are even better. Neither of us had a drink that afternoon but the drink menu looked pretty decent. They also have a brunch menu... and it's making me salivate, so I think I will have to go check that out!"}
{"text":"Let's Be Frank is where all the cool kids hang out. Since I'm not really cool, I went at noon, when they were not exactly ready for customers and no one else was there. That's ok though, because it was such a relaxing atmosphere. It's almost like going to a friend's place and they're all like \"make yourself at home, I'll make you some hot dogs\". I love having friends like that. 

The food was fantastic and I love that there were three hot dog sizes so you can try a whole bunch of their specialty dogs without getting judged. My boyfriend and I ordered a mixture of four hot dog sliders: Katsu, Korean BBQ, Dogfather, and Coney. My favourite is definitely the Korean BBQ. It had sriracha mayo, kimchi, and an egg: a winning combination. We also got an order of small fries (free with a check-in!). They were fresh, hot, and delicious. 

Back to the point of us going a bit too early and them not being ready for customers. The food did take awhile to get to us. We were the first customers in so they were probably still setting up. Having said that, we really didn't mind the wait. When the food did get to us, it was fresh from the grill and steaming. The people here were also very friendly and helpful.  Being first, we were able to grab the comfy sofa seats facing the plasma TV. It was a great way to listen to some great music played from a record player that they were personally attending to. 

With great food and atmosphere, Let's Be Frank is a terrific place to just unwind. So grab a beer and a hot dog or two (or five). You're in the company of friends.

{"text":"I came here on a lark, because it is about as close to school as you can get.  Who is ever in the mood for hot dogs, you might ask?  I was skeptical too, but this place delivers the goods.  They're not just hot dogs, but fancy hot dogs.  The dogs themselves are delicious, and the toppings are varied and fantastic.  The fried chicken is fantastic (heed their warning about how spicy it is) also.  

I very much like how you can get a variety of sizes without paying much of a penalty, which encourages you to try many different types of hot dogs for about the same price as one large one.  

And finally, the ambience here is great.  They are always spinning super cool records."}
{"text":"I order their cheese fries religiously. Seriously, I order them at least once a week. They are hands down the best I have EVER had. Great mozza too. And when you go in store they let you play your own vinyl. Love it there."}
{"text":"Upon walking into Let's be Frank, I was so delighted by the casual atmosphere! It seemed like a spot where locals just chilled and caught up.

I had a Mac and cheese dog which was fantastic. My friend had one with wasabi mayo on. I'm terribly weak to spicy foods, but when i sampled some of her order, there was just the right amount of wasabi mayo on so that it wasn't spicy, but you could still taste it enough to compliment the rest of the hot dog. The meat sauce on the hot dogs were great. We also checked in with our yelp app and got a free basket of fries which were delicious.

They also served beer and had many other hot dog flavours. Hope to come by again and try them all!"}
{"text":"My second time here, also my last. In fairness the first time was good...I ordered a steak sandwich and large Greek Salad. They ran out of the bun they usually use (shit happens) and the sandwich proved to be unremarkable, boring. 
The salad, shame on Let's be Frank...old browning lettuce, too many onions not enough Feta, wrong dressing and get this NOT ONE OLIVE. 

Keep looking, this isn't the place for you"}
{"text":"The atmosphere of this place is very chill that you'd want to stay longer even after you have eaten your hot dog. I thought I got the place wrong because it was at the back. The front of the store was a vintage stand and dj.

The place is clean, friendly staff, and the seats were Retro lounges. I ordered the katsu dog and got a free order of fries courtesy of yelp check-in :D katsu dog was delicious. It has wasabi Mayo and it was just the right amount. The katsu dog was crispy. The bun is just a normal bun. Good thing that there's no trace of oil anywhere from the deep fry of the hot dog nor it's on the bun. One star down because its a bit pricey for a 3.5 inch hotdogs, it costs 4 bucks. I guess that's gourmet hotdog price. Anyhow, that doesn't stop me, I will definitely come back to this place and try the other dogs."}
{"text":"I wasn't overly excited when my roommate suggested Let's Be Frank for dinner. I wasn't in the mood for hot dogs (I actually wasn't in the mood for anything except beer). When I walked in I was pleasantly surprised. I thought this would be exactly like Fancy Franks (I'm not hating on them, I like them, I just wasn't in the mood for hot dogs).
Let's Be Frank had hot dogs, fried chicken, chicken burgers, mac and cheese, and BEER on draught.
They had booths which my roommates and I could all sit at. 
Our server was wonderful.
We got a pitcher to split between us.
I ordered the small mac and cheese (it's enough... trust me) for $5 and a regular hot and steamie which was $5.50.
The bun to meat ratio was on fleek.
The amount of sauces were also on fleek. 
I hate coleslaw but I didn't mind the coleslaw on my hot dog at all.
The mac and cheese was delicious. It came with barbeque sauce and bacon. Standard extra sauce on anything just warms my heart.
It was pretty darn good and the portion size was big, I wasn't able to finish it.
Also!!! They let you pick the records here! They have tons, I didn't get to look through them but my roommate put on Arctic Monkeys and I was very happy with that.
Way to go, Let's Be Frank! You've won me over, I can't wait to go here again!"}
{"text":"I guess this would be one of my first reviews where I kinda gotta do the bad news. I seriously was hoping that maybe the other reviews were maybe based on personal taste, but now I know better. The only positive I can say is that the prices were good, and the service was fast. But really.... it was borderline gross, and honestly I think due to the speed of his preparation of my food, it was also cold. AND I left without noticing he forgot my aroncini and had to rush out to catch me before I left in my car. I get home... everything is pretty gross.... I asked for a meat aroncini and I got a veg one (you cant tell until u crack into it)... sauce was not good, the herbs which maybe at first impression seems like fresh basil and nice sun dried tomatoes, were limp and not in that good cooked down way, more like they had been sitting around forever and just kinda chucked on there..... Don't bother with here unless you think maybe i'm just being harsh, but check out the other reviews. Though there aren't many, they ain't great ones, thank goodness I got a couple other proven \"Hot Table\" Italian eateries that I can rely on next time instead of getting adventurous...... Fail."}
{"text":"Good Italian hot table!  In its newly renovated space, Let's be Frank has a nice ambiance. 

Food quality is good. I had the Chicken Marsala with penne and an incredibly fresh bun. The chicken was tender and moist, and the mushrooms were top notch. The Marsala sauce was very mild in flavour and I had trouble sensing the flavour of Marsala. 

The penne was nicely al dente, with a fresh tasting marinara sauce. I would have liked fresh Parmesan instead of the pre-powdered stuff. 

Most of the entrees are $15, and the sandwiches are just under $8, and the servings are a good size. This price point puts Frank on the same competitive landscape as Levetto and The Italian Gourmet, both who cook to order.  

I need to compare to establish reference points, but you should go and try it anyway. I'm pretty sure you'll be satisfied. I plan to go back, and if other item menus are as good or better, there is another star to be awarded!"}
{"text":"few weeks ago another friend of mine went to this eatery for lunch and said that the quality of food is not like before. He also said that he wouldn't go there anymore."}
{"text":"Some friends ate here a few weeks ago, and liked the food, so yesterday I went over to get an early dinner before heading on for an evening of boardgames on Yonge street. I wanted food that would stimulate my gaming edge and the dressed up hot dogs did the job pretty well :-)

Pros: 
I instantly found my favorite spot inside which was this cozy area across from the television. As soon I plonked myself on the couch, I already felt at home and it was so relaxing to sit back and watch the games while waiting for my order.

I picked the two that stood out from the menu: the 6 inch Pulled Pork Po Boy + a fried egg, and the 6 inch Katsu Dog with extra wasabi mayo. 
the Po Boy had a filling amount of pulled pork and coleslaw on it. The katsu dog had a good crunch on the coating and the best part of it was the mayo and you couldn't go wrong with adding more if to go with the taste of the panko coating.
I'm glad that I took my time to eat both of them because I started to get full half-way through. Now that's a filling meal. I think the Po Boy alone with a side of fries would have been enough for a hungry person my size.

I don't really listen to blues or bluegrass in my own time but the music that was on was so catchy that I often found myself tapping my feet to the rhythm :-) and also at some point someone put on some electro urban beats which was just as catchy.

Con:
The only con about the interior was the black washed wall on the one side. It gave one half of the inside this dingy atmosphere and switching places over to the couch area made the ambiance more comfortable.

Other than that, I'm definitely a fan of the food here and there are still more delectable choices on the menu to try."}
{"text":"I wanted a late nite snack  so i browsed through yelp and this place came up .Best decision i ever made.finally and super chill place with good music and awsome food.i had the mac and cheese dog and my friend had the Tijuana . Both were amazing . That Tijuana had some bite to it i highly recommend it . As for the music there was a live band there playing some jazz at the time. Not my style but i liked it vibes.. Also there was a decent selection on vinyl that you could play.even bring your own if u like.i beleive Friday's is 80s nite . I ll be showing up then."}
{"text":"I had the mac n cheese hotdog with coleslaw. I loved it! Perfect amount of mac n cheese on top. The coleslaw wasn't as creamy as I like it, but it seemed a bit more rustic than regular coleslaw which I guess is nice. I haven't had a hotdog in years and this really hit the spot."}
{"text":"Nice vibe. Bartender who was also the server was friendly. Menu looked interesting but didn't try it yet.  Loved the record player as the main source of music! You can choose one to play and add to the queue (PG during the day of course since it's blastingthe dound outside onto the sidewalk )."}
{"text":"I ordered from Let's Be Frank through Just Eat, and the food was very good. The Coney dog was a bit spicier than I usually like it, and the chili cheese fries were a bit soggy, but I chalked that up to being in a delivery van for awhile. The corn dog though was to die for! Their customer service was also very good - Just Eat was running late on sending a driver, so the restaurant upgraded my chili cheese fries from small to large to compensate. I'm looking forward to trying more of their hot dogs in the future."}
{"text":"You won't find this at the hotdog carts. The skinless jumbo Nathan's hotdogs are tasty, but the Korean BBQ dog didn't have any additional bbq meat thrown on, just kimchi, fried egg, and a spicy mayo. Flavor-wise, it was interesting, but didn't blow me away. For close to $8, it's pricey, and that's before you add on the $3 to upgrade it to a combo w/ fries and drink. The fries are good tho. But for close to $24 for two hotdog combos, it's expensive for what you get.

The guys working there are friendly and will help guide you through their offerings. Now if they'd just stay open later, and offer corn dogs, I'd stray off my diet more."}
{"text":"Amazing food, excellent customer service. I had the Philly Steak Sandwich & my kids had Pizza, my daughter said its the best pizza ever! Sam was great to us; he gave my daughters free cupcakes :) we had a blast! Outside sitting area looks amazing. 
Thank you Sam."}
{"text":"This place has both the food and atmosphere going for it. The Northern Soul Pulled Pork Poutine is very tasty and they have a cool selection of records you can choose from. 

The guys that work the bar and kitchen are friendly and it feels like you're just at one of your mate's place hanging out, having a beer, some fries, and listening to a few tunes."}
{"text":"I walk pass this place everyday on my way to work not knowing what it is. Finally someone posted their menu on our office fridge so I took a look to see what they served - turns out they specialize in beef hotdogs. 

The one items that caught my eye was the katsu dog - hot dog coated with panko and deep fried, served with BBQ sauce. I was a bit skeptical at first like \"deep fried hot dog?! Kinda gross\" but I tried it anyways and it was delicious! Crunchy crust with a juicy interior yum! It's pricey for a hot dog but clubhouse costs the same price. I would definitely wanna come back to try their other hot dogs :)"}
{"text":"Hot dogs worth the hype and a drive down to Toronto. Service is slow and apathetic, but that didn't matter to us when the hot dogs knocked our socks off!

Located just south of the southwest corner of College and Spadina, this place isn't luxurious by any means and looks like a popular spot for students. It looks like it was converted from a garage to a restaurant (the front wall is a closed garage door). It definitely needs a sweep (the floors were marked with dirt that looked like it hadn't been cleaned in ages), and our server was very curt, abrupt, and not very welcoming.

All that aside, the food is absolutely and fabulously excellent. First, note that when you 'check in' on Yelp, you get some sort of promotion. We received a large basket of fries to go with our hot dogs (super crispy and perfect). 

Second, the actual hot dogs. You can order them regular sized or slider sized (mini versions). We opted for the slider sized since we only  intended to drop by for a snack. We ordered a slider Corn Dog ($3.49), Korean BBQ dog ($3.99), and the Mac Daddy (Mac & Cheese dog with bacon bits)($4.49). WOW. So blown away by how delicious it was - it felt and tasted SO fresh (none of that frozen stuff), carefully and intricately prepared, super crispy and full of authentic flavour. The food wait was long (around 35 minutes) but we loved all of it - once you have a taste, you'll realize you can't have just one. 

Their menu is also pretty extensive, so you won't have problems picking something that appeals to you.

For two people, with tax, and tip, we paid around $15.00. I definitely wouldn't mind coming back here for more!"}
{"text":"Oh man, this was a pleasant surprise. We were at Castle Board Game Café and needed a bite/beers after, and found this lovely place just beside it.

WHAT VALUE FOR GREAT GOOD/BEER

Beers were like 5$, and the hot dogs were delicious and cheap. They come in 1/2 sizes (price-proportional) so you can order a few different flavours.

I had a cheddar fried chicken sandwich, and enjoyed it greatly!

I will be back with friends, though this time as the main atteation!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed the \"gourmet\" hotdogs and the fried chicken! Also, Todd, our server at that time was very pleasant. We would definitely come back here to try their other stuff. Oh yea!"}
{"text":"The decor if this restaurant is pretty chilled so it's be a good place to hangout with friends or maybe a casual date (if you don't mind showing your eating face along with some sauce on your face) Tried their Mac Daddy which was a hotdog with Mac and cheese on top sprinkled with bacon bits. Tasty, but if the Mac and cheese was hotter then it would have made the hot dog better. 

If you check in on Yelp you get free fries! That was a nice surprise. The waitress was really nice and service speed was decent. 

My friend ordered the katsu dog (large you add 0.99) in total with tips came to about $22. 

Will come back when I'm craving for good quality Hotdogs."}
{"text":"I've been to various gourmet hotdog places, both in Toronto and elsewhere, and these are the best so far.  The mac and cheese, the katsu (I think that's what it was called...it had wasabi mayo), and the corn dog were all delicious.  The one with the tomato sauce and mozza cheese was forgettable and I wish I had tried something else instead of that one.  The customer service was also excellent.  I will definitely be back.  I can only imagine how out of this world delicious these hotdogs would be if I had been inebriated."}
{"text":"Our waitress was Alanna and she was amazing! They knew we weren't from around here and they made us feel welcomed!  She made an excellent suggestion for a choice of beer and was very attentive. My girl and I ordered the Katsu dog and Korean BBQ dog with a side of the southern (forgot what it was called but it has pulled pork) poutine!  It was amazing!  If you're in the area and want to try something new, definitely hit this place up. Excellent vibe, great choice of drinks and food and they let you bring in your own vinyls to play!"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Let's Be Frank! 

I work in the area so I'm always keeping my eyes peeled for new lunch options. My coworkers and I have been meaning to come out to Let's Be Frank and I'm so happy we finally made it!

The big selling points about this place (compared to other gourmet hotdog sellers in the area) are:

1. Atmosphere! It's such a cute little spot and it doesn't yet seem to be intensely busy. There are colouring pages if you want and you can choose what record goes on or even bring your own! 

2. Menu! Hello alcoholic milkshakes and SLIDER size hotdogs! This is absolute dream for trying multiple kinds - 2 slider sized dogs and I was stuffed. The menu is full of great options like the quarter pounder with cheese, corn dogs, Asian style hotdogs, Mac and cheese dog, the list goes on. 

3. Price! Compared to other hotdog joints I really felt this was quite reasonable, and as an added bonus they have a free fries Yelp check-in offer. So you can get two slider dogs and a fries for under $10!! 

I wouldn't hesitate to recommend let's be frank to any hotdog fan in the city - I have one or two more to try but this is currently my favourite spot!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the very first time last week. It has been open now for over a year, and I finally gave it a chance. If you are looking for healthy food items, you definitely wont find them here, but if you are looking for some fast eats at a very reasonable price you will be glad you stopped by.
I am not a fan of hotdogs (especially after seeing a Youtube video of how they are actually made) but I caved in and had the Katsu dog which definitely has a Japanese vibe to it. This dog was packed with flavour, and I was almost tempted order another one (because it went down so good).
Service is fast and friendly here, and don't let the location stop you from coming in (this part of Spadina is on the seedy side) The restaurant itself, is small and cozy, and as John S says, it does a have a dive feeling to it, but a nice cozy dive feeling to it. 
If you are in North Chinatown, and are craving something else than dim sum or fried rice, stop by and grab a snack."}
{"text":"Great treat on a saturday afternoon. Great toppings,  service, and atmosphere! Unfortunately i don't live here but hopefully I'll be back someday"}
{"text":"The food is amazing.  Some of these hot dogs can be only described as delicious abominations.  Like, if Frankenstein's monster were a really tasty meal, he'd be here.  Had one bad time when no one bothered to show up to take my order. But all is forgiven with Dorrito battered meat."}
{"text":"Great choice of draft beer! 

Let's be frank is a bar that acts like a bar. 

Their food (starring hot dogs) are creative, surprising, and amazing. The best feature is the existence of different sizes which range from finger food to full meal. 

Great veggie options. 

Place looks simple yet not plain. You get this punk/funky clandestine concert venue from the 80s with a special touch of friendliness. 

Crayolas are available."}
