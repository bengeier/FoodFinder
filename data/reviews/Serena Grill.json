{"text":"This place is a hidden gem that everyone should try! I have tried dozens of Pakistani/Indian restaurants all over the GTA and this one tops my choice for quality and freshness. I have eaten here 5 times and keep going back on a regular basis and really happy to have this place as an option in Durham region. I use to be a frequent client of the other indian restaurant in Whitby but stopped as every time I ate there it would make me feel gross after. This place doesn't do any of that and only leaves you satisfied and wanting to go back for more.  It's a small husband and wife shop who are very friendly. ...decent looking inside but looks more like a take out place as its not intimate especially the lighting.   Portions are good although I find you get more meat in the curries at the other place. I have had several  of their curries and pakoras and they were all yummy and fresh."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Palak paneer is one of my favourite foods and Serena Grill nails it.  Everything else we've tried has been great flavor and large portions, so plenty of leftovers.  A $30 order is usually enough for 2 dinners and lunch for myself and my partner."}
{"text":"Very impressed by this place. The samosa chaat was incredible, as was the butter chicken. It was very reasonably priced too at $14 those dishes with naan and a pop."}
