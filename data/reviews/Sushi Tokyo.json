{"text":"I go here to AYCE with work mates, the sushi is alright but I do find it way over priced for lunch.  $18.99 plus 10% added in gratuity is lame especially when they don't always bring you the ordered items or reduce the quantity."}
{"text":"As an all-you-can-eat sushi joint, Sushi Tokyo excels. It is not the same quality as places like Globefish and Kyoto 17, but if you are in the mood to binge on sushi, then this place is an excellent choice. Having sampled the all you can eat fare at other AYCE standards such as Sushi Ichiban and Sushi BBQ inn, I find that the quality here is the highest and the service prompt."}
{"text":"all you can eat is a joke you can only eat three times of their menu.. our friend stepped out and we took a turn not knowing this.. they also have a right to change prices to normal at any time during all you can eat. place is garbage, soup is cold, service is shit."}
{"text":"Was on a business trip at Calgary and wanted to have some good food, dropped by this place and was largely disappointed. The Sushi looks simply horribly and tastes even worse. The udon had some weird smell (felt like over-night) and the soap was a disaster, susi itself was tiny, cold and feel like was made by some high students.   Lastly, the price and the automatic 10% tip are insane, with almost $29 I am sure I expect something far, far, far better.   The reason I think it deserves 1 to 1.5 point is for its fine services.  If you ever consider getting susi, don't even look at this place, I would rather go subway or Wendy's."}
{"text":"Actually, the food is pretty good. However, when I got the bill, the waitress already charged 10% for tip. I asked if this is their police to charge everybody additional 10% for tips when people get the bills. One said yes. Another one said no. I asked to see the manager or owner. They said that he or she is not there.  I strongly felt that this a discrimination to charge me 10% in front.  Will never go back again.  I typically pay ~15% or more on tip. It simply because my wife waited on tables before and we understood what are tips mean for waiter / waitress."}
{"text":"I am a sushi lover, over the last couple years it has replaced pizza as my go to meal. Thus when I have a chance to have sushi I am always somewhat delighted. Sushi Tokyo was nothing but a pleasant experience, the Sushi was horrendous. The fish tasted old and the food lacked flavor. The quality of sushi at this establishment barley eclipses sushi one can buy at superstore, not a good thing for a sushi bar.  The one positive about the place was the staff, pretty friendly and responsive"}
{"text":"You know you're hooked on Yelp when you make a date with a friend just to earn a  badge. But that's exactly what I did with a fellow Yelper as we set out on a quest to earn the Sushi Sensei badge!   Not only did we want to earn the badge, but we also wanted to be able to compare the restaurants like for like. We decided that an order of California rolls would be our staple in every restaurant and we would supplement that with an order of the restaurant's feature rolls. Now, you're probably thinking \"that's a LOT of mayonnaise and fake crab\". Well reader, read on, because although we risked OD-ing on mayonnaise and getting mercury poisoning, we came out with some great tips for anyone seeking sushi in Calgary's downtown area!  Sushi Stop #2: Sushi Tokyo Our second stop on the sushi crawl was Sushi Tokyo. As it turns out, we arrived during an all you can eat night. I've never actually done all you can eat sushi, but it sounds like something that would require a stretcher to get me out!   We stuck to our plan and ordered an order of California rolls and an order of their baked scallop rolls.   As I've mentioned before, it is hard to get creative with a California roll, but the ones at Sushi Tokyo weren't quite as good as the ones we had at Sakana Grill. It was like there was extra mayonnaise in these ones. And although you don't eat the presentation of the rolls on the plate, the presentation was a little *cough* ... boring.   As for the baked scallop roll, now this was interesting. These were recommended to us by our server as one of their most popular items, so we decided to give them a go. The scallops were baked in a cream sauce and served on top of a mushroom slice on the top of the roll. It was certainly a unique flavour, and one I noticed changed considerably depending on whether you dipped it into the soya sauce. I am only a moderate scallop eater, so if this sounds like your type of flavour, I definitely recommend giving this a try. I probably wouldn't order it again, but I am happy we tried them out.   The ambiance in this restaurant was a lot more casual. It is located inside the Dragon City Mall, but the restaurant feels cool and a touch outdated. The service was average.   Overall... I wish I could give a + rating, because I think in fairness these guys deserve a 2.5 rating. Unfortunately, these guys fell lowest on the totem pole of all the sushi restaurants we visited on our quest for sushi sensei, so it has earned a 2 from me. So even if our experience at Sushi Tokyo was skewed by our experiences at other sushi restaurants that evening, looking back I don't plan on a repeat visit.    -- L  Sushi Stop #1 was Sakana Grill - read my review here: http://www.yelp.ca/biz/sakana-grill-calgary#hrid:LJusrjLfGGSYo3xN-sN0XQ"}
{"text":"I have been to Tokyo Sushi many times, usually on the 'all you can eat' and although the carpet is dirty and the service sometimes slow, I always enjoyed my meals. It may be price but all you can eat comes with a price. The bento box is a good option if you would like to go light and have something quicker. They really need to have that carpet changed, but the food and service are good."}
{"text":"I was visiting Calgary and was doing some shopping downtown with my wife and eventually got hungry.  So we unfortunately made the decision to try out this Sushi Tokyo spot.  The ambiance of the place was casual and bit outdated to me. Customer service was nothing to write home about.  Wife ordered the sushi and I ordered a ramen bowl for lunch.  After about 10 minutes the waitress came with our drinks followed shortly by a bowl of cold rice and luke warm miso soup which tasted terrible.  Sushi arrived for my wife and it didn't fresh at all. My wife said the sushi tasted like it was not cut fresh but like it was sitting in the fridge for a day or so.    Finally my ramen bowl came and just by appearance alone it looked awful and unauthentic to ramen. I tried not to judge by the look but once I slurped that first few pieces of ramen noodle my fears were confirmed.  The ramen was disgustingly overcooked for starters.  Secondly, my ramen had wood ear fungus in it which NO authentic Japanese ramen would ever have period.  Finally the soup was like drinking an overkill amount salt soy and miso combined together.  I was better off getting a cup of noodles from the grocery store and having that instead.   Do yourself a favor, save your money and stay away from this place.   P.S. I guess we were fortunate enough not to get food poisoning like other yelpers did."}
{"text":"Why can't I rate it zero stars? I waited for my lunch special bento box for 45 minutes while my friend tried to eat her meal very slowly in front of me.  They asked me numerous times what I ordered and twice brought me a meal that wasn't mine. No discount, just an apology when my food finally came and they still have the nerve to automatically charge a 10% gratuity on the bill. If I had my choice I certainly would not have left a tip and in any decent restaurant my meal should have been discounted or comped. Pathetic. I will never go back."}
{"text":"My wife accidentally went to Sushi Tokyo recently, maybe giving them (yet) another chance. They have now gone beyond simply serving bad sushi to ripping their customers off.   An automatic \"tip\" of 15% was added to her bill even though it was only a party of two, and they did not disclose that the \"tip\" was added to the price. Only giving her a total price on the receipt. Evidently they are hoping that people do not try to verify their calculation of the total price. And it doesn't stop there - when she paid by credit card their machine prompted her to pay another tip!   All of this happened even though there were bones in the fish and they didn't bother to get the orders right. Please do not go to Sushi Tokyo. If the word is spread hopefully this horrible restaurant will be put out of business and replaced by something decent."}
{"text":"I ate here yesterday at lunch, but I am just posting my review now as I have finally recovered from the food poisoning.  The food: It was not fresh; in fact, it seemed like the salmon was a day or two old. The calamari was way overcooked, and the miso soup was lukewarm. The tuna roll looked downright anemic, and tasted the same. They didn't bring all of the items that were ordered, which I suppose was a good thing, considering the poor quality.  The service: Ummm...what service? I had to repeatedly ask for a water refill, which was not forthcoming. In fact, I actually got up from my table and walked to the front to pour myself some water. Who knew Tokyo that was a desert?  I thought that the proverbial icing on the cake was the mandatory 10% gratuity that they add to your bill (likely because they wouldn't receive one otherwise), but the aforementioned food poisoning was really the star of the show!  I'll never darken their door again, and I suggest that you don't, either."}
{"text":"The hardest part about assigning a number of stars to this location is I cannot give it a negative number.   My buddy Ray has visited the toilet three times since returning from lunch...that is a bit much even for him.   Hands down the worst thing I have ever put into my mouth on purpose.   Never again!"}
{"text":"Rather expensive, and not very good.   I had the pork ramen and it was not very good. The egg was just a typical hard boiled egg, they put that weird fake fabricated pink thing in it, and even the pork was only barely so-so. The crucial miso base was crappy, seemingly made from a powered base. And, that all costs $13!"}
{"text":"As a sushi eater for more than a decade now I can tell you this place has had ups and downs. If you go when a good chef is on than the sushi is not bad but sometimes it's not worth more than Safeway quality. Of course I love sushi so much that sometimes I'll eat the Safeway stuff just to get a little of the flavor but I think you should at the very least get the quality that you have paid for. If you are downtown and want sushi there are other options but give it a try and decide for yourself."}
{"text":"Its fine, good for all you can eat. My friends I go with are sushi epic meal time kings, so its always fun to see what they can accomplish for $24 haha."}
{"text":"If I can rate this place a zero, I will. Visited Calgary 2 times now. And visited this establishment 2 times since it was the closest to the hotel. Sushi was ok, at the best. They have a limit of 8 sushi pieces  per person on an all you can eat buffet. The restaurant was dirty as evidenced by dishes still not put away when we arrived. Service was really slow considering there is only 4 customers. Food started coming 10 minutes after ordering (sushi) . Dishes in our table was piling up and the waitress placed the new plate dishes over the empty ones. She didnt even fill water without being asked. There is an automatic 10 percent gratituity on your bill."}
