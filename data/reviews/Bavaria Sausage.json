{"text":"I can't say that I've tried too many of the sausages here, but what we have had has been delicious.  They also have a fun selection of German foodstuffs.  Lots of candy, chocolate, kraut, assorted pickled stuff, coffee, mustard, cheese, summer sausages, etc.  Great place if you find yourself wanting to put together a German-themed gift basket. We've always had very friendly service."}
{"text":"Authentic German food,candy,spices etc... I could have easily spent $100's Cannot wait to bake some Br√∂tchen mit Mettwurst!!"}
{"text":"\"If you want a good, tasty, budget brat,\" says my bossman, \"go for the johnsonville smoked cheddar jalepeno\".    *cringe*  Two things here:  (1) what the heck is a \"budget brat\" and (2) BARF!    If you're going to eat meat in tube form.  Do yourself a favor:  spend the extra 20 cents per pound (yes I actually checked some brat prices), go down to Bavaria Sausage Kitchen, and get the real thing.  They've got your regular brats, your fresh brats, your smoked brats, your beer brats, your weiners, your weisswurst, your polish and a bunch of sausages you've probably never heard of, but are undoubtedly delicious.    I did a BBQ for about 70 people, which gave me the opportunity to load up on just about every tubed meat in the case.  Plus BSK has their more popular products packed in cases of 25, in the freezer, ready to go.  Service was nice and prompt, even with such a big order right near the end of business.  And, most importantly, my customers were happy.  I received lots of compliments on the quality, and there wasn't a single sausage left at the end of the day (although I did spy a few half-eaten greasy frozen burgers that had been abandoned).    So for the quality, the location, and the service....Bavaria Sausage Kitchen has earned their five stars.    A few minor details.  Thanks to Daniel K. for the recommendation.  The BSK website looks a little garish, but his comment got me over that.  Also, let me say, BSK has TONS of other products.  We talking cold cuts, salami, bacon, cured pork concoctions, cheeses, dry goods, and what appears to be the largest collection of imported Haribo (German original brand of gummi candy) anywhere outside of Germany.  I won't lie, I took a couple packs to snack on."}
{"text":"I've never had a bad experience at this place.  The German food selection is great and the frozen and refrigerated selection is always tasty (I recommend the sauerbraten).   Fridays when the weather is nice they grill out on the front lawn.  Stop by for a great selection of sausages cooked up fresh.  As a counter point to a one star review for this place...  It was written while Bavaria Sausage was closed for fire repairs, so who knows how accurate that review might be."}
{"text":"In all of the UNITED STATES, if you're looking for authentic German food, look no more!!  Having been to Germany several times before and having the authentic food there, Bavaria Sausage is exactly the same!  We order yearly and enjoy it very much!!  The owner of Bavaria is a wonderful women and knows her business well.  She will accommodate you in any way she can!!  I read the reviews and I can't believe that anyone would post anything negative about the owner or the customer service.  They do their very best to deliver quickly for the best shipping dollar amount.  It's a fair price and is weighed to exact weight and that's just how fair Judy is!!  It's a shame that others don't understand why some of the food can't be shipped via the post office and that's simply because certain items are perishable!!  I have to add that, I have not dealt with a more personable person who wants to make her customers happy!!  That's a real business women!!  Can't wait for our delivery this week!!  Yummy!!"}
{"text":"Great selection of cheeses and meats. I was blown away. I stopped in for some cheese curds because they sold out at the vendor booths at Epic XGM. The ladies working were so helpful and very knowledgeable. For about 1/2 lb bag of cheese curds it was $4. I bought garlic and dill and a cheddar mix. Looking forward to bringing them home to enjoy! They also import a lot of products and candy from other countries, great selection!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Fantastic cheese and fresh cut deli meat options. My favorite is the spicy salami (shaped like a petal flower). Delish. Cheese curds are always fresh and squeaky. Jams, snacks and endless fun items are always fun to peruse and sample. Next time I'm bringing a larger cooler to take more things home with me!"}
{"text":"I lived in Madison for a couple years. Now that I have moved away, there are a couple things that I sincerely miss. Sausages from Bavaria Sausage Inc are some of those things. This place is amazing. It is outside the main part of the city, but it isn't too far away. Do yourself a favor and purchase some delicious tubular meats from these guys.   The cheese is pretty tasty as well."}
{"text":"If you are in Madison you should really add this place to your list of places to stop in ! they have some amazing meats and cheese. I grabbed 4 different types of salami, some peppered all beef summer sausage, and a few brats. Great staff, very helpful and all the samples were super tasty !"}
{"text":"I just received a cheese and sausage package as a gift from a family member in Wisconsin from this company. I live in Arizona and have received other cheese and sausage gifts from other companies and never had any issues. The cheese and sausage was poorly packaged and everything arrived warm and melted. When I called to let them know how my package was received, I was told by the lady who answered the phone, that it's all fine and to just throw it in the refrigerator to cool. Umm...having meat and cheese sitting in a package for 2 days and arriving warm is not something I trust consuming! She said they don't guarantee their packages once they've been shipped. She was rude and acted like it was crazy I even called about melted cheese and warm sausage. She never apologized or offered to replace it. This is horrible customer service and I highly recommend finding another cheese and sausage company!"}
{"text":"We were in dire need of Haribo.  I did a little research before we headed to Madison and was directed to Bavaria Sausage Kitchen.  Sausage and Haribo - yes please!  The shop is small, but well stocked.  Plenty of German and a few Dutch delights.  Due to the fact that they're a pretty small shop, their prices definitely reflect that.  Their prices were a bit on the high side and much of the stuff could be ordered much cheaper online.  HOWEVER, it's always nice to browse in person,  We walked out of there with about $50 in Haribo alone - so obviously, they had a very nice selection!  Tried some sausage as well, the deli sliced Alps salami was ok and their summer sausage very good.  They're closed on Sundays, otherwise, we might have stocked up on a variety of their sausages and other freezer items on our way home.  Overall, nice little place and I imagine we'll be back the next time we're in Madison!"}
{"text":"I order online a couple times a year and they not only have a fantastic product but also great service to get it to me 600 miles away."}
{"text":"A Great German Deli and Sausage House  This little store has everything you would ever need that is German, and Sausages galore!  They make their own german style sausages in house and they are some of the best sausages you will ever have.  The store is wooden, and looks quaint, and the selection is varied.  Inside they have a German style deli with cold cuts and fresh sausage, and in the corner, they have a freezer where you can buy boxes and boxes of sausages.  From Brats, to White Sausage, to Weiners, there is nothing they don't have.  German Candy is found in the corner, and dried meats on the other side of the store... pickles are on the wall and ginger bread treats in the aisle.  Service is good, and the staff is so friendly."}
{"text":"I have done business with Bavaria Sausage for several years.  Their customer service is outstanding.  I had a little hiccup with an order and they took care of it right away. We all fall down occasionally and it is how you get up that makes the difference.  I look forward to many more years of great service and products.   Judy, congrats on the new kidlet!!!"}
{"text":"HOW HAS NO ONE REVIEWED THIS PLACE YET?!?  It's amazing! We need more places like this in America!  My boyfriends parents wanted a gift card from here for Christmas, so we made a stop while we were in town yesterday.  As mentioned previously, IT'S AMAZING.  I'm a vegetarian, so the meat has no appeal to me, but they had a ton of sausages, sliced meats, and even fish! Their selection of cheese was also quite impressive. What really was cool to me was the massive amounts of chocolate and European bakery mixes! I had a hard time picking out what I wanted, until I saw a box full of chocolate with a picture of kittens on it, and it was called Katzenzungen! Its so fun just to say! Although, I looked it up on the internet and the chocolates are supposed to look like cat tongues...which is kinda weird but still super awesome at the same time!  I will for sure stop in and visit Bavaria the next time I am in Madison!"}
{"text":"Some great food, some very old shelf food and some miserable people behind the counter. I can't recall a place that had more unfriendly people waiting on you.  They apparently hate working here.  I can't blame them.  They are cramped up inside this small space that looks like something out of Alfred Hitchcock's film Spellbound. I once accidentally asked for a certain number year cheddar and they about pulled a gun out from under the counter and shot me.  \"WHAT?!  THERE IS NO SUCH THING!\"  My mistake, I mean 7 year cheddar.  I  had accidentally used the price in place of the year. Never a thank you, never a friendly chit chat at check out.  Here ya go.  Ugghh.  I really hate this place but the cheese and sausage are good.  Apparently I wrote this when the place was closed for repairs.   Didn't mean to add insult to injury.   But my comments were on the staff not so much the food.   I am hopeful that all of the old shelf food went up in flames.   If I return I won't worry about what I buy from the shelf.   What I said about the staff is true.   I have never seen a smile in this place. ."}
{"text":"Holy Moly ! This place is Nirvana for German and European meats, cheeses, and charm. That along with fair prices and friendly knowledgeable customer service it hits on all cylinders. An update: Just enjoyed the best Easter Holiday Ham ever. Mail ordered from the website two weeks ago and if I had known it was going to be this incredibly good I would have had a dinner party around it. Amazing, and I have had some of the best of the best. Great Job !!!"}
{"text":"This place flies under the radar for many in the Greater Madison area and I have no clue why.  Solid German offerings.  Although some rave about their brats, I am more of a fan over their other meats (how many other places have multiple schinken options?.  For sure, their smoked ham is one of the best I've ever had.  No water added, smoked over real hardwood, it is O.G (or maybe it should be O.H.-original ham). Be sure to check them out"}
{"text":"Picked up 3 kinda of brats today: Weiss, red lager and Sheboygan. They are all top-notch. Also bought some of their homemade braunschweiger.   This place is much larger with a bigger selection than your typical sausage shop. They have a wide variety of deli meats that I'd love to try. There cheeses looked great too.   The service was prompt and friendly, and I thought the prices were very reasonable.   I just wish they were closer to where I lived now :-("}
{"text":"Jawohl! This place is the bee's knees, the brat's tots, er...it's zehr gut. Mr. G fired up a tasty smoked brat that we later added to red beans and rice. Dang. That is no budget brat! The ladies behind the counter were very helpful and, because we bought a huge amount for a party, they even threw in a free box of orange liqueur chocolates for us!  I inquired about a curious sign near the cash register that read \"Fresh Venison\". Basically, if you're a local hunter and bring your deer in here, they'll do all the necessary butchering for you. Sometimes they have leftovers for customers to purchase. Sounds a little wild, but next time I might be game!  Oh, and ditto on the Haribo gummy candy selection. It's huge."}
{"text":"I load up on Asbach every time I'm in Madison, and they have a TON.  Also, same cheese as Brennan's, and MUCH cheaper.  Plus they carry a couple cheese flavors that Brennan's used to carry, and doesn't anymore."}
{"text":"It's like walking back to my childhood when my Oma would send my mom items from Germany.    Friendly, helpful staff.  Great selection of meats & all sorts of great products on the shelves."}
{"text":"Oh yeah! I stumbled across this on my way from Epic training in Vernon (near Madison) WI and am so lucky I did! Meats galore! Cheese galore! European snacks galore! I needed to get back to Chicago to turn in my rental car and risked getting charged an extra day just to get some more meat sticks."}
{"text":"Excellent food--the weiss wurst is awesome--but the staff is snotty. The owner is fine but seems to be blind to rudeness among her staff. Their bacon is much better than the popular Neuske's, and hams are outstanding and good value. Can't find Black Forest schinken this good anywhere else in the country!"}
{"text":"I would like to start by saying I disagree with Allene and Genevieve.  I have been doing business with Bavaria for years.  I have not one bad thing to say about the products or the customer service.  Any time I have had any issue with a product or my order Judy would take care of it right away.  She was always pleasant to me and has even called to follow up to make sure I was satisfied with the fixes.  I would recommend Bavaria to anyone not only for the products but also the customer service.  I also would like to say their brats are outstanding and they have a wide selection of cheese.  If you want a out of the ordinary cheese look on the Bavaria website or if you're lucky enough to live close enough stop in and see Judy and the rest of the Bavaria staff.  I personally recommend the pepper jack cheese, the beer brats and spicy brats. The speciality mustards are great also.   Again,  if you want authentic German sausage and the best cheese ever let Judy take care of all your needs.  Keep up the good work Judy and Bavaria Sausage."}
