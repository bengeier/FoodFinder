{"text":"Alright option if you are looking for a snack or caffeine fix around the library. They serve local Kittel beans as well as some pastries, salad and sandwiches. They had 1 gluten free option but no vegan snacks. Also have booze available (if you're looking to party in the library?!). When I stopped by in the afternoon the service was a bit lackluster but not bad. Overall this place is about the convenient location when visiting the library."}
{"text":"The food here is so good. Their tables d'hôte at lunch time are really great price-quality wise and their coffee is awesome. They also serve Camélia teas which I love.   Great place to get a quality snack in the area and chill and do homework for a while."}
{"text":"Very good coffee with a few tables to sit around in the library (BAnQ). I ordered an Americano. It has nice a creama and a strong dark flavour. I'd definitely try other drinks and foods next time."}
{"text":"Le café est bon, les viennoiseries sont de chez Les co'pain d'abord. Miam!  Toutefois, le service laisse à désirer. Autant au niveau de l'accueil que dans la préparation des commandes"}
