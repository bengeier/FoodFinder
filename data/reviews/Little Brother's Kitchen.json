{"text":"Been here a few times.  Always great food.  I've had the 3 piece dinner, as well as the Chicken Club sandwich.  Both are excellent.  Fries are great too - they taste just like the Mary Brown's taters.  They don't charge extra for white meat, which is a plus.  Great food, friendly service, and an affordable price."}
{"text":"This is my all-time favourite chicken place. I've had their MBFC since long ago and continue to be a loyal customer with the new LBK. The majority of their menu items are prepared from scratch, most notable being their chicken items - so juicy! Their fillet sandwich is probably my favourite, with spicy mayo, pickle and lettuce, a whole chicken breast fillet yum! Their fries are made from scratch in the back with a crispy coating and hot and tender inside. Best with their hot gravy on the side. I tried their vanilla shake as well, cold, creamy and delicious, not too sweet. If you're in the area I'd highly recommend checking this family business out."}
{"text":"They used to say Mary Brown has The Best Legs In Town and after having Little Brothers greasy chicken thigh (ugh), I believe this still stands true. Besides lacking a crunchy coating and flavour, it was an unappealing light blonde colour. Who cooks FRIED chicken like that!!! The Poutine was pretty good but swimming in gravy, too much!!!
For this type of take out I'd rather go to KFC. Also this mini plaza has to be the hardest to get in and out of!
I suspect this joint is a by-product of Let's Be Frank's down the street as a subliminal ad pops up for Little Bros when viewing photos of Let's Be Frank's Yelp reviews. I don't appreciate manipulation but I suppose one could say it worked! Too bad it wasn't a good experience."}
{"text":"The best chicken in town... hands down and no premium for white meat... your whole order can be white.... no extra charge, unlike some other chicken restaurants. The fries are also good."}
{"text":"Very tasty! Had the chicken fillet club with fries for lunch. Added their special salt to the fries which was on the counter, delicious! Food was fresh, and it was nice, as an old Mary Browns customer, to see a familiar face behind the register! Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"I had the schnizel with garlic mash potatoes and it was not good. The potatoes tasted like cardboard and the schnizel was very bland. Needless to say, I won't be going back to this place again."}
{"text":"Excellent service and food is similar to Mary Brown's with more menu items and similar prices! Cooked fresh and hot"}
{"text":"I ordered the pulled pork dinner with fries and buttered bacon corn ($10.99) and it comes with a drink.

My friends got the two-piece meal with mash potato, corn, and macaroni. 

I really enjoyed me meal. The pulled pork was tender and sweet from the barbecue sauce. The fries were super crispy and had another coating on them. And the corn was juicy with bacon bits.

Next time I want to try to chicken since they are a chicken place. The service was fast and quick and there seems to be a lot of regular that frequent this place."}
{"text":"The best chicken in Newmarket...kids love it...it's constant... every time we been there food is great, I love it's a chicken place with a great limited menu ..they do what they do and it's don't well! Love the place!"}
{"text":"This restaurant specializes in fried chicken, with generous side dishes. The fried chicken pieces are juicy, with perfectly cooked inside and crispy flavourful breading on the outside. The chicken fillet sandwich is served on a steamed bun instead of toasted. The soft bun compliments the crispy fillet perfectly.

The sides are HUGE and equally as delicious. The thick cut fries are seasoned, breaded, and crispy. It's hard to describe just how unique the flavour is, but these fries compliment the chicken so, so well! Dipped in gravy, these fries are to die for.

Their steamed corn is lightly buttered mixed with bacon bits, also a tasty and unique combination. The garlic mash, macaroni salad, and coleslaw are the what you would expect, also great choices!"}
{"text":"Great fresh, plump, juicy chicken! Great prices and specials. Awesome thick cut hefty fries!"}
{"text":"So I'm not really a chicken guy but noticed there was a pork schnitzel sandwich on the menu so I figured I'd give it a shot. And damn, I'm so glad I did!   

Firstly, the sandwich was huge - pretty substantial in size. The breading had just the right amount of crisp on the outside and the meat itself was super tender. The baguette-style bread was toasted nicely and complimented the meat well. They gave two sauce options: a mushroom gravy and a creamy dill. The mushroom gravy was bomb and I'll probably try the dill next time. 

I ordered the sandwich in a combo that came with a side - chose the buttered bacon corn, which was pretty awesome. Not to mention, the portion size was nice and generous. The worst is when you're half-way through your main and run of out the side dish. -_- 

All in all, I really liked this place. The price was super reasonable and the quality of the food was superior compared to your everyday fast food joint. Newmarket needed a place a like this!   Will most definitely be coming back! :)"}
{"text":"Adios Mary Brown's, thanks for leaving a worthy replacement behind!  I watched people walking in, expecting to order Mary Brown's chicken, but being unsure until other diners would encourage them by saying \"this is better!\"  And better it is.  

Sure, MB was a standard fast food chicken joint, with all of the salt and all of the saturated fats one comes to expect in, well, fast food!  But Little Brother's kept enough of the favourites that the locals come to expect, and tossed in a few surprises.

For instance, the chicken is just as juicy, but less salty and less fatty.  The 'taters' have been replaced with a fresh cut jumbo french fry in a very similar coating.  But the wild card sides--garlic mashed, and the Buttered Bacon Corn is unusual, and a very welcome addition.  

You will also find pulled pork and schnitzel on the menu, either as a sandwich or in a dinner.  I tried the dinner, noting that this pulled pork was really flavourful and tender and went well with my Buttered Bacon Corn. Actually, everything goes well with the Buttered Bacon Corn!

Except maybe the Funnel cake or Deep Fried Mars Bar--yes, they are on the menu.  I have not seen those outside of the EX or off a food truck."}
{"text":"Awesome fried chicken, I had the poutine and added popcorn chicken. With the flavoured salt they season their fries with and cheese curds, gravy it was delicious! I did find it to be a little on the salty side but still yummy! 
Their bacon corn side is great, not usually a fan of corn but loved this! 

Not a huge fan of their garlic mashed potatoes, didn't really taste any garlic and they were kind of bland. 

But other than that I will be back. Decent prices for homemade comfort food!"}
{"text":"Wow!! The chicken sandwich is awesome!!! Hands down THE BEST THICK CUT FRIES EVER!!.
Great service and delicious flavour of chicken.
Way better then Popeyes chicken and KFC
Keep up the great food!"}
{"text":"First time trying and was really impressed with the fries ( 5 stars), chicken was good but dry."}
{"text":"Fried chicken is a funny thing. If you're one that generally avoids fast food, your options are limited. I stumbled on Little Brother's kitchen and hoped for the best. My expectations were exceeded by a long shot! The chicken is crispy and juicy, the chicken sandwich is perfectly constructed and the fries are thick and perfect. They have daily specials during the week for $4 which is a bonus. Definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Though not a big fan of fried chicken, I did tried their chicken schnitzel sandwich and popcorn chicken. Both were good and not too greasy. They have daily $4 specials on weekdays, such as pull pork sandwich, popcorn chicken and poutine. Serving size is decent. I will for sure go back and try their pull pork and poutine."}
{"text":"I never really was a fan of Mary Browns, so I must admit this was a lost plaza for me. However on Tuesday I ended up here because a friend of mine said that he had tried this place and it was soooo good. So we went and grabbed some chicken filets and fries to go. 

Like I said I never was a fan of Mary Browns, thus I couldn't really remember what it tasted like. So this to me was a more amazing version of the McChicken (yes from Mcdonalds) It didn't make me feel like instant regret after eating it. 

The filet was not dry, DEFINITELY juicy and flavourful. The regular chicken filet is just lettuce and mayo and to be honest that is all it needs! The fries are battered and seasoned. They are delicious, some might think it is over the top but I really enjoyed them. 

Im not going to lie I went back yesterday since it was on my way to the destination I was going. This time I got the spicy chicken filet (yes just spicy mayo) and THIS is my new favourite. The prices are not bad and they have specials everyday. This is in a far end of town for me, but worth the drive across."}
{"text":"This place is so much better than the Mary Browns that was previously here! I got the three piece with the 2 sides dinner for such a steal! The prices are so low but the food here is delicious. The fries are great, my kind of fries, would love them even more if they stayed in the fryer for a bit longer, they were seasoned great. Gravy tasted like actual real gravy. 

The chicken was also delicious. One piece with the two sides was already filling, makes great leftovers for chicken salad. The chicken was tender and so juicy. Less greasier than KYC and surprisingly the breast of the chicken was so juicy and not dry at all. 

Definitely try the bbq bacon corn as a side, it is so flavorful and delicious. 

Everything was less than 15.00 with a pop included. 

The only thing that I did not like was the service. There was two in the back making food and one girl taking orders, it really felt like they rather be somewhere else than to work. It was like the life was sucked out of them, that was it. Other than the amazing food, the employees was just part of the experience."}
