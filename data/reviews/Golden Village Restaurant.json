{"text":"They just changed new owner. Twice my dinner has had the BBQ pork fried noodle and ginger beef there . The food was excellent and tasty. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Though my husband says we've ordered Chinese from here it doesn't really stick out in my memory...but what does stick out is the wonderful Vietnamese subs and Bubble Tea they have here. I like that you can get some really interesting flavours like Pork Bulgogi and Butter Chicken. The buns and veg are fresh and the subs are reasonably priced for the huge size you get. 
Only downside? Don't go when you're in a rush as sometimes it's just the one guy there and it can take a while to get your order done.
This is a family run business along with the Subs 'n' Bubbles food truck and the pop up location in the Kingsland Farmer's Market. One super bonus...they are always friendly and take pride in what they do."}
{"text":"The food from here is usually pretty good. This time though we got really bad food poisoning and couldn't function for over 24 hours. They must use older meat. It was not fun"}
{"text":"I love their dinner b for two! You get at least four meals out of it for 30 dollars. Trying using lemon sauce instead of pineapple sauce on the pork so good ! Wor won ton soup is really good too."}
{"text":"My husband and I ordered again from here and something has changed drastically. It has gone done downhill. We do not know what has changed, but we will not order again. Overcooked and did not even have certain items when we tried to order. The flavours have changed drastically. Not recommended."}
{"text":"New owners + change in receipt box = same name? I don't think so that just bad math. Used to go all the time and loved. Went 2 times since it changed ownership and won't be going again. Sad to see the original Golden Village go, wish they would have taken the name with them."}
{"text":"Popped in here the other day for business and noticed they had gone from a completely Chinese restaurant to now offering Vietnamese subs and bubble tea. I was back in the area tonight and thought I would show some good will towards them. Boy was that the right choice. I had a butter chicken Thai sub with strawberry mango bubble tea. Not only did it come to just over $10 which is a steal, but the sub was awesome and the bubble tea is made using fresh fruit. It was easily the best Thai sub meal I've had in a very long time. Another plus is that seeing as they're located in Midnapore, I don't have to drive downtown to get my fix."}
