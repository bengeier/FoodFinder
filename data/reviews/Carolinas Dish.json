{"text":"Best fried chicken, Mac n cheese, candied yams, banana pudding and peach cobbler ever! We will be back!"}
{"text":"My family loves this restaurant and we have been eating here since day one!  The fried chicken is the best I have ever had, but the smothered chicken, baked chicken and meatloaf are also mighty good!  The veggies and sides are all fresh made and very delicious.  We love supporting small business and good people and that's what Carolina's Dish is all about!"}
{"text":"The most amazing fried chicken I've ever had.  We've only ordered takeout, so I can't speak about the dinning experience, but the food was amazing."}
{"text":"If you are craving some good old fashion southern cooking this is the place. Food was great."}
{"text":"Always great when I go! I've taken many friends here and they always love it. I'm a big fan of gravy and this place does an amazing job."}
{"text":"Had the fried chicken, after seeing some good reviews. It was really really good. We'll definitely go back and try other dishes as we live very close by. Rob the mgr/owner? was super nice and helpful."}
{"text":"Food was awesome! I got the fried pork chops, green beans and mac n cheese. My hubby went with the meatloaf, pinto beans and mac n cheese. Never had meatloaf with chili peppers in it but it was really good. Overall I was very satisfied with my meal and the portion size. Pecan pie was really good too. Not too sweet just right. Definitely plan on going back. It's the real deal southern food!"}
{"text":"Can't speak for everyone on here, but my experience with this new soul food restaurant has been nothing but delicious! The tilapia is a nice size and fried to perfection. The cabbage is seasoned just right and their banana pudding is mind blowing. Will def be back with my family & friends"}
{"text":"Tried Carolinas Dish for the first time today and I LOVE IT! The Mac&cheese is delicious. Just like my grandmother used to make. The croaker was fried to perfection and was seasoned extremely well. The large plate is truly A LARGE PLATE, and worth every dollar you pay for it. 

The woman behind the counter was very friendly and welcoming. She asked had I been there before and after hearing that I was a first timer, she went over the menu for me before taking my order. 

The interior is cozy and the large mural on the wall makes me think of my grandmother. It was quite warm in there so I wasn't able to eat in, but I will DEFINITELY be back. I told my parents about it as it is right up the street from them and they went the next day. It's worth giving a try."}
{"text":"First time here and I came hungry! I was not disappointed. I was warmly greeted and explained the selection of the day. I consider myself a mac n cheese expert and let me tell you, it was hot, fresh, and delicious! The prices are very reasonable and the portion sizes are what your momma would serve!! Hallelujah! The fried pork was perfectly seasoned. Wonderful warm environment. Ill definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Wow what a great experience! Thee service was great she explained the whole menu and even will let you sample the sides to make sure you like what you order! And the food was amazing so good that I actually ordered another complete meal to take home for later just wish this wasn't so far from where we live but will definitely be back when in that area."}
{"text":"Tried it once a couple of months ago and it was fantastic.
Sad to see it permanently closed when I came by today. 
Where else to go for a good soul food?"}
{"text":"I was in the mood for some Southern Comfort food and found Carolinas Dish on yelp.  My wife and I both thoroughly enjoyed our meals.  I got the Fried Chicken and my wife got the Smothered Chicken. My chicken was cooked to order and was succulent, delectable, crispy, and lightly seasoned. Her's was tender, and really tasty.  Additionally, our sides (Mac and Cheese, Collards) were really good too, I swear this is Charlotte's best kept secret for Soul Food."}
{"text":"Really great fresh home cooked food.  I went here while visiting from Chicago.   I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Found this place after going to a movie next door. So glad we stopped in. The owners were so friendly and amazing! They helped us pick out what we  might would enjoy, explaining all the different types of food they have. And oh my it was all soooo delicious!!! 
The ribs were out of this world the best I have had. And the baked chicken was moist and flavorful I was truly amazed.  And, you can't beat their service. 
So now when I go to a movie, this is the place I will be eating at."}
{"text":"I went to carolinas dish for the first time & I thought the food was good! The fried chicken was fresh & it was seasoned perfectly. The place is nice & clean & the people were super nice. I will definitely be going back"}
{"text":"I had takeout - meatloaf, greens, mac & cheese. The owner (?) was very nice & accommodating in helping me choose what to have. It was enough food that I had it for 2 meals. Definitely a place I will go again."}
{"text":"I should be what Ronda Rousey calls a \"do nothing b**ch\"; indolent, spoiled & unambitious. I live in a naturally stunning environment that continuously produces amenities & conveniences I heretofore had to exert great effort to obtain. Too much good fortune for one person.

Case in point, the arrival of a lovely soul food restaurant  walking distance from my house. Previously, I was forced to drive 20 min across town if I was jonesing for New York style soul food & wasn't already in North Charlotte.

Due for a sun break, I grabbed my ever-growing workload and ventured out mid-afternoon for a quiet lunch.

On arrival, 2 groups were completing their meals & 3 people were ordering takeout. Place was spotless, warm, and homely. Ordered & took a seat off in the corner, aiming to just disappear into my work while eating.

Food was splendid. I mostly avoid croaker, but this! Perfectly fried & seasoned. I even ate the tiny bones (calcium!). The mac & cheese was how I like it; thick, moist, with both blended & chunks of cheese throughout. (I detest the cheap kraft-y mac & cheese some soul food places embarrass themselves serving. I'll send it back quick. I'm serious about mine.) Peach cobbler was ecstacy. 

The owner is quite welcoming & gregarious, almost to a fault. His attitude is genuine and he provides A+ service. I say \"almost to a fault\" because the place is tiny, so if you are the only diner at the time, while you eat he'll likely make small talk with you to fill the silence. I imagine this is pleasant for most, yet if you set out to have a quiet solo lunch, either to retreat into your mental space, or get sh*t done, it is....well.....yeah. That. Again though, I appreciate that he clearly takes customer service serious. 

Great food, great hospitality. Close to home. Living it up :)."}
{"text":"Monday Dec, 28th we stopped in Carolinas dish for the first time. We were hungry and had to wait a while for our movie to start so we went in to have a bite.
It was clean, the owner was very nice and attentive. He said they had Been there for to years! So we went ahead and ordered. I had the two piece dark meal. And my husband had the fried whiting. 
My chicken was great..my collards were a little left to be desired. But overall it was OK.
My husbands side item the Mac n cheese didnt look appealing at all. It had a lot of pepper in it and cheese wasn't melted. It was reasonable in price, but I would like to finally get a soul food restaurant in Charlotte that will knock my socks off!! Overall I gave it a 2 I want to give a 2.5! Maybe it will last I like supporting small businesses..will I return..hmmm probably not. Sorry.."}
{"text":"This place is the bomb
The best fried chicken
Cornbread not over sweet
Collard greens are great
I will definitely be coming back"}
{"text":"Love the staff and the food. Best fried green tomatoes in town and that tomato soup! Yum. I love going there for lunch but be sure you are either there before noon or after the rush if you are in a hurry. It can get a bit crowded, with good reason."}
{"text":"Fantastic southern cooking.  I had the fried chicken, green beans, and rice with gravy.  So good!  Really nice folks that run this place!"}
{"text":"Comfort Food at its best!  I have passed it many times and never actually stopped.  Took the recommendation from a couple of friends and decided to give it a go.

First off, let me say that Rob the owner is super nice and extremely flexible.  I called at 8:04pm (they close at 8)....and he invited us to come on in any way ...especially since it would be our first visit.  He kept all food on the cook line heated and ready till we got there.  He even allowed us to dine in after closing.  He was very hospitable and fun to chat with.

On to the food!  Overall, the food was scrumptious!  They offered things like Meatloaf, Fried Chicken, fried fish, MacNChz, Collards, Cabbage, Corn, Whipped Red Potatoes, Potato Salad, Fried Okra, Corn Bread.....you name it...they had it.  I gotta say that while it was all super.....the Potato Salad was out of this world!  Everything was flavored to perfection.

They offered Small, Medium and Large plates that came with your protein and side(s).   I had a 4 vegetable plate.  My other half had Fried Chicken.  All food was served in healthy portions and piping hot.

In closing, I have been on the search for a decent soul food place since my favorite one closed back in 2005. After many restaurants attempting and not delivering......this joint does it right!  I can't wait to share this place with my clients and my friends.

Lastly,  2 people ate for under $20.  It's a great deal if you ask me!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff and good food! Can't beat that.  I had the baked chicken with gravy, mac and cheese, sweet potatoes and corn bread.  All of it was delicious. Fried foods are cooked to order,  so make sure to have time if that is what you want to order."}
{"text":"We stopped in to support them for dinner around 5 PM.  The place was clean and decorated well.  I ordered the fried chicken which I must say was steaming hot and deliciously tasty.  However, the vegetables left a lot to be desired.  I believe they may have sat all day without even a stir.  The sweet potatoes...no.  The steamed cabbage...salty.  The kids loved the chicken but the mac and cheese...they wouldn't touch it.  Way too much cheese that was not blended well.  When kids won't eat your mac and cheese, you've got problems.  I so much wanted this new restaurant to take off and be successful but I doubt, given the current state, this will happen. I am rating this new soul food restaurant 2.5 stars but cannot round it up to a 3."}
