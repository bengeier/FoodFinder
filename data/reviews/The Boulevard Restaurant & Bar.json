{"text":"I  enjoy their Dinner Specials, Burgers, Fries, Soups, & Monthly selection of  Soups to go), Draft beer selections are a great variety. I also enjoy their  no smoking in the bar. Execellent value for a neighborhood family restaurant. Service is always an A Plus!

{"text":"What a great place!  I had a birthday get together at The Boulevard for my husband last weekend.  The owners Mike and Megan were great to work with.  They made sure that there was Karaoke for us and set up the dinning area for all of our guests.  The food (pizza and wings) and drinks were great.  All of the staff made sure that everyone was well taken care of.  The karaoke DJ had a large selection of music and the regulars were a nice crowd.  The fact that it's non smoking is a total bonus.  We will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"$4.80 for a 16 Oz  Yuengling draft??? Are you kidding me? It's freaking Shaler Township! Good luck keeping the locals."}
{"text":"Fried pickles, get the fried pickles! Batter was light and flavorful. This place has a casual, cozy vibe with solid food and good prices. Went last night for the first time and I will definitely be going back. The staff was very nice too!"}
{"text":"Great food. Staff was very nice and attentive. Loved the big screen TVs so we could watch the golf tournament with lunch. Definitely recommend"}
{"text":"Their brunch was decent, the eggs were good, white bread for toast was great, thick and tasty. Spinach omlete was greasy, bacon was nearly burnt, sausage pattie was pretty good except the patty itself was thin.

In the end, 4 stars because even though the brunch food quality was a little below their standards, the overall price made it a great value."}
{"text":"not impressed. ..at all...it wasn't one thing.....   had heard great reviews on their food....but ..we'll not be going back..and totally will not recommend"}
{"text":"Service is ok
Waitress forgot my dinner rolls
Potato pancakes nothing special
They needed more onion and parsley 
Grated too fine also
Should be courser
Music is horrible"}
{"text":"I barely got in the door. The sign said dining room open until 9:00. Bar until midnight. We arrived at 8:45. Yes it was late   I know. The sign says you were still open! We were hungry we asked if we could sit in the dining room and were told no we thought we could sit in the bar and then were told that the kitchen was closed. Do you close at 8:45 or 9:00 or another time. Not a pleasant interaction."}
{"text":"Great Burger!  Great Bar!

I met the new owner of Rice's Roadhouse.    I sat on the left side (dining) where I had a really good burger after a 5 hour car ride.   The burger was juicy.   My Yuengling was cold.

I paid my bill and adventured to the bar side.   There was a nice lively crowd there.   The bartender kept my Jameson full and its mate Yuengling.

Price:  $10 for dinner
Atmosphere - Dining - clean, fun, friendly   Bar - Fun, Friendly
Service - Awesome on both sides

You should check this place out."}
{"text":"Really thought this place was turning itself around until last night. I ordered a steak salad to be cooked medium and when it came out it was severely under done. Then to top it all off I pulled a hair out of my salad as well. I understand that things like this happen and hairs do fall out, but this isn't the first time this has happened here. Also, their soups used to be amazing, sadly not anymore )-:"}
{"text":"This place is a great spot to grab a sandwich and a beer and also offer a good deal for their wing night. The service was extremely friendly and the food came out quickly. My wife and I split a turkey club, pulled pork nachos, and wings and everything was great. The turkey club was big with a ton of turkey and lettuce and tomato that came on it was very fresh. The nachos were also largely portioned and the bbq sauce they use is on the sweeter side which actually went well with the heat from the jalape√±os and the saltiness of the chips. The wings were also good and a great deal at 40 cents a piece as it was wing night when we visited. We will definitely comeback to try some of their other sandwiches and burgers."}
{"text":"Had lunch with friends today and 3 of us had never been there. Was pleasantly surprised of the quality of food for such a small place, the portions were large and presented very well. All of us liked what we ordered and waitress Amy was very personable and right there with our wants and needs, would recommend this quaint little place to anybody going to be in the area.."}
{"text":"When your car breaks down in North Park and you don't have AAA, you tow it to Courtney's Auto Shop in Shaler and have lunch at Rice's Roadhouse right down the street.

Rice's is a restaurant/bar, nicely divided by 2 doors to keep the smoky bar separate from the dining area.  The place is small, with about 10 tables and was half full on a Saturday afternoon.  We sat ourselves and were immediately greeted with waters and menus.  The lunch menu is hearty bar-fare, basic sandwiches and burgers and salads, and had 2 vegetarian options.

We got the sauteed mushrooms to start, which was a very generous portion for the 3 of us.  It came with awesome garlic bread which was a huge plus.  The veggie sandwich we ordered was huge, and with fries it was a steal at only $8.

I would definitely recommend Rice's for a nice lunch if you're in the area.  The service was great and the food was great."}
{"text":"After driving past this place multiple times a week we finally decided to try them for dinner.  My husband ordered a Millvale burger, which was good but very underwhelming in size and presentation.  His burger took up less than a third of the plate and the rest was filled with potato chips.  He asked for a different side other than fries and chose a salad which the menu led you to believe was an additional $1.50.  The bill stated it was a $3.00 upcharge.  I ordered spaghetti and meatballs which were fairly good but nothing i would bother to return for.  I did not want a salad for my side and chose clam bisque soup instead.  i was not told there was a $3.00 upcharge for this too.  My husband had pop and i had iced tea to drink.  This is the first time in 20+ years that i can remember being charged for refills at a restaurant.  With tip our bill was almost $40 for a little burger and a plateful of potato chips and a bowl of spaghetti.  We can now say we have been there and done that but we will not be returning.  There is parking in the back, which we should have used, because trying to get out onto Mt. Royal Boulevard was not easy.  Our waitress was very nice, but should have been more forthcoming regarding the upcharges."}
{"text":"I stopped in for lunch with my sister on a weekday. We each got a burger, and she ordered the mushroom soup. The food was excellent, and the server was very friendly!"}
{"text":"Great sandwiches/burgers and salads. Nothing fancy, just good food and friendly service. Portions are pretty huge- I haven't been able to finish a meal here yet!"}
{"text":"Honestly one of the best burgers I've ever had. We ate at the bar, and bartender was attentive and friendly. As a Shaler resident, I can't believe I've been missing out on this neighborhood gem."}
