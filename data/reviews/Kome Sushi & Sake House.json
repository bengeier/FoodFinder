{"text":"Well, I was very disappointed when I got there today and... it's not Kome anymore! I loved their lunch menu, and I really needed sushi today... What a surprise! It's still supposed to be a Sushi place, as its name is Sushi Sugar (try to say it three times fast)... but guess what's missing from the menu??? Sushi! They have 6 or 7 makis and a weird array of tapas.... YES, TAPAS!!!  And the new \"lunch\" menu is a selection of noodles... (???). 

Odd, hard to read menu, and, by the way, much more expensive than the old Kome. 

I must admit the new decor and music is a step up... their new patio is on the amazing side. Unfortunately, unless they add some sushi to their menu, I will not be stepping back in there... 

Ah, well, after a 25 dollar lunch for two, I still have to figure out what to eat for lunch, as I am starving!"}
{"text":"As i read about the previous reviews, where is this chris person? 
I just went there tonight and just in shock that i decided to read and write a review about this place. When we went to the restaurant, the server was on the phone, which is fine. And she waved me to sit at the back
Of th restaurant with no lights. Knowing there were other seats in the better place, i decided to move to the other table. That is about 20 minuites after i got there. Still no greeting, no tea, nonwater, no menu. 
My husband, who is VERY polite, almost walked out of there. 
And i finally see the waitress come by with a couple of plates and a couple of menus no even on a tray, comes by and gave them to the people next to us. And im thinking to myself, so they charge 14 dollars for a n udon and cant afford a tray?? 
If she had a tray, he could have easily brought four plates and four menus. 
Oh, byw, the people sitting next to us already had a menu with them. However, she left them with three menus and none with us and walke away. 
So i had to stop her and asked her for the extra menu because i wante to order at least for my three year old hungry boy. Anyway, horrible service, didnt even get water until after my husband asked her after we had been there for over half an hour and then she decided to suddenly offer us some tea when we were almost done the meal.
Not impressed and would never go back. And really didnt like how the waitress was wearing super short jeans and tank top. When im paying 40 dollar barely enough meal, at least i expact to see someone in nice black skirt or some dressier pants. 
Not to memtion her rolling eyes when i mentioned that she made a mistake on my food, i had to say its ok. No sorry, no nothing, she rolled her eyes and walked away.
Priceless."}
{"text":"Great sushi, a bit on the pricey side of things.  Not the best I've had, but it is higher quality than the usual sushi place.  A big plus is the salad is made of proper greens and not ice burg lettuce.  Great service too.

I would say it's a good safe bet."}
{"text":"Worst \"Food\" Ever. 35 minutes for takeout (and it was empty). The (tiny amount of) chicken teriyaki was so gristly that my dog wouldn't even eat it. I asked for extra teriyaki sauce and it came with almost none. The (dry/old) rice had foreign \"things\" in it. I had to throw most of it out because it was layered with an immense amount of past-due green peppers (to artificially increase the meal's volume). The miso \"soup\" was flavourless, sour and salty and obviously had turned. The cost was at least 35% higher that other Japanese restaurants. How is this restaurant still in business..."}
{"text":"I'm not even sure what this place is called anymore (is it Kome sushi? Sugar sushi?).. Anyway, I've been here a couple times and I have to say, it's quite good.

The owner is really nice and friendly, and he makes an effort to get to know his customers! The atmosphere is also quite nice, and the food is somewhat unique. Of course, as a vegetarian, I am not left with too many options though (as usual). I ordered the lunch combo both times I went, and I have to say that the sushi pizza is quite good (not greasy/soggy/covered in mayo like most), and the rolls are small but tasty. The individual sushi that came with lunch were quite different from any I've had before, and I found them to be interesting and yummy. I ordered another 6 pieces of maki because the combo wasn't quite enough, but overall it was satisfying. 

I find the price to be slightly high, but it's not too much higher than most sushi restaurants and I think it's worth it! While the rolls were not necessarily the best I've ever had, I definitely would like to return here even just for the service and unique taste!"}
{"text":"This place is really expensive for what you get. Very small portions. During our meal my son and I smelled cigarette smoke and noticed cigarettes and lighters piled up by the entrance to the kitchen. I was really disappointed in this place. It felt dirty. The service was nice, and friendly but way to expensive. It cost us $40 for an adult and child for lunch with nothing left to bring home."}
{"text":"Good food and friendly service. Dinner is a bit on the high side given the portions but the lunch menu looks very reasonable (although I've never been here for lunch).

Most of the cooked food tends to have a more pronounced sesame flavour which is good if you like it. if not it can be a bit over bearing.

If they bring back the sesame roasted quail I highly recommend trying it!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Service by Chris is almost too good. Food is fresh and delicious. Great casual atmosphere. Nice location in my neighborhood along the newly energized St. Clair West area. I'd recommend this place to all my friends. If you're looking for a casual, friendly, enjoyable sushi experience -  go here. Can't say enough good things."}
{"text":"Amazing food, if you where to get something like one of the ten dollar dishes from here in downtown you\"de be payin anywhere from 30$ to 60$

Great value"}
{"text":"Really nice sushi; really nice vibe. A great neighbourhood sushi joint with a laid back vibe, friendly service and reasonable prices. They even remembered us after just our first visit. The only negative is the crazy music they play. One night all Kenny G, the next night all classical music to scare your cat. I'd love to lend them a playlist or two; I just don't know how to break it to them that their music is just not fit for human consumption. Never mind the cats. Maybe they'll read this? Super sushi; super resto! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The food was very good, prices decent, however the customer service could've used some work.

M'lady and I went out a few weeks ago to Kome for some sushi. While we were there for dinner, we really liked their lunch menu and decided if we were ever in the area, that it'd be a very good place have lunch at.

The sushi was very fresh, and the meal that included lobster was also reasonably affordable.

The waitress forgot to get us soy sauce initially, but she got it after I asked her for it (for anyone not familiar with sushi, it's one of the things that you generally always eat sushi with). Also, when we were ready for our bill, I tried getting her attention a few times, and ended up getting it not less than 15 minutes from when we were ready, which felt like forever by the time she noticed that I was trying to get her attention, pealing her nose out of the newspaper she was reading.

So all-in-all, based on the price and quality of the food, I'd very likely return to Kome, even though the some-what minor issues with the waitessing :-)"}
{"text":"I thought the food was amazing and quite inventive for sushi, it's not just your typical fare.
The blossom rolls are really good ideas that I haven't encountered anywhere else. The roll prices seem a little expensive, but the rolls are actually quite a bit larger and have more fish than the vast majority of other sushi places I've been to.

I had a great experience solely because I enjoyed the food so thoroughly."}
{"text":"Food is well executed. They are child friendly. And the wait staff are attentive -- they overheard me mentioning that it was my wife's birthday and surprised us at the end of the meal with a green ice cream/banana desert with a candle. So considerate!"}
{"text":"I live just a tad too north for places on Bloor to deliver, and just a tad too far south for places on St. Clair, so I was ecstatic to find Kome, who WOULD deliver to me.

Food took about an hour to arrive because I'm two blocks outside their usual delivery zone, but it was still warm enough not to need reheating, and they get extra points for the holes in the containers that allow steam to escape (so what you get is still crispy instead of soggy).

The veggie gyoza - nice. Tangy. 
The veggie tempura - enh. Pretty much standard. Not spectacular, not awful. 
Butter fish ngiri and Hamachi maki were good. I'm a bit spoiled, used to eating Japanese food in San Francisco, so my standards of \"good\" are probably \"spectacular\" to most Torontonians.

Prices for all of that, plus rice and soda, and delivery, was $29, so pretty good. And enough food for lunch tomorrow. All in all - a win, and I'll be ordering from them again."}
{"text":"I really want to like Kome Sushi for it's good selections of Lunch Specials...

The most expensive item is my $10 Kome's Lunch with sushi, sashimi and a handroll does sound like a good deal.

Unfortunately, my sashimi were all wet... I almost want to use my napkins to soak up the droplets of water of top.... The fish on the sushi was the opposite.. they were all a little dry. 

The shrimp tempura handroll though was good... fresh and the shrimp has a great bite.

Those sashimi really turned me off... I don't think I want to come back to Kome for any raw fish......"}
