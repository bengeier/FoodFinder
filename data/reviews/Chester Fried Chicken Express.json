{"text":"Used to come here a lot in high school as it was right next door and was in walking distance..it was decently cheap for 6 wings and fries and/or wedges. If I can remember it was $6.50 to be exact. they usually had a lunch special for students/workers in the area. This location is located in the sketchy mall we call Crossways. There is limited seating so if you want to sit down and eat..better find somewhere else or come early.   I've recently had Chester;'s since and I'm not sure if their food quality has decreased immensely or if my body is just used to REAL chicken these days.  Do not come here.."}
{"text":"Never go here.... ever ever.  I ate there, and got so sick for the next few days it was not close to being funny.  I think their chicken is..... well, why speculate?  But it was not chicken as my body knows and loves it."}
{"text":"Friendly service and decent prices in a place that has very little to offer in terms of food. There's a Korean restaurant next door and a coffee shop a little further in but the nearest sit down place have pricing that isn't as reasonable.  Food here is pretty fresh, though the chicken is frozen (like any similar chain). The fried food does taste a little different though, it's possible they're using really old oil and it's definitely noticeable. Other Chester's are cleaner, and hopefully they can do better, these guys have great service."}
