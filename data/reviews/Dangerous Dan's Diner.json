{"text":"Seriously disappointing. Some major flaws. Fries came out unsalted. Cheese on the burger (cold and not melted) and burger under seasoned and over cooked. A dinner just can't afford to make such mistakes. Shakes are decent as is the beer selection. Wouldn't recommend."}
{"text":"Okay, so I admit that my first mistake was ordering a veggie burger at Double D --obviously not their forte, but hey it's on the menu so they could try to make it good.  The truth is, this place had been taunting me to enter for months, so late one night I finally took the plunge.

The veggie burger was, in short, gross.  It was really slimy and smelled like it had been fried in beef fat but aside from the rank of beef it was bland with an off-putting texture.  Even worse were the fries.  I think they may have come from frozen but either way they were cut way too thick so they just crumbled into dry, tasteless potato chunks upon tooth contact.  There are few things that annoy me more than diners that pride themselves on greasy food yet cannot make a decent french fry! Determined to make the most of my meal, I requested ketchup and was given a blank stare of indifference before I finally received a bottle fifteen minutes later.  I get it that the 'too cool for you' service is all part of the act but c'mon, give a girl some ketchup.  

If anything can redeem Dangerous Dan's, it has to be the milkshakes.  Get the Elvis, it is damn good."}
{"text":"First visit was okay , burger was a little burned tasting  but it was a half hour before close so really didn't wanna make a big fuss about it. Decided to try it a second time this past week . Ordered chicken slouvaki and the big kevorkian burger.. although tasted great myself and  daughter (we had the chicken ) have just been told we have food poisoning :(  hubby is fine he had the burger . Perhaps we should have left it at the first visit or atleast clued into the 12 minute wait time for a pick up order ....correct me if im wrong but maybe not long enough for proper cooking of poultry . I'm generally a pretty cool person n  wouldn't wanna ruin any body's reputation but I do think consumer beware should apply in this situation.  It feels quite \"shitty\"."}
{"text":"Any burger that is 16 oz, has egg, cheese and whatever else you want on it is a good burger and they have it. It also comes with poutine and a drink....price i think was like 15 bucks....maybe a bit more but sooo worth it. The beer on tap is really good, and the deep fried desserts would make any stoner happy ( or anyone with good taste) for that matter. Yes they have a bit of attitude but if you want to get treated like a princess go somewhere else or just loosen up a little bit. They re not mean by any-means. You will get teased for being a vegetarian, but just go with it they do make decent vegetarian food I hear.  Either way check it out, you will leave full and happy."}
{"text":"Burgers are good, but totally on the greasy side. Poutine has actual chunks of meat in their gravy. They're not kidding about clogging your arteries. Elvis milkshake was good for that extra dose of diabetes. Staff is friendly enough except for the owner. Guy's a real dick."}
{"text":"Wow! I am just APPALLED by the way this place is run!!! The owner is extremely rude and has that 'i don't give a shit' attitude...Not only was he rude to us, but he is rude to his servers and kitchen helpers! The owner kept yelling at this kitchen helper even though he was running/working around this 'dinky' place the whole time we were there..
And then the FOOD--Oh well! It was just a burger and fries joint..Nothing extraordinary about it. The burger meat was dry and did not taste that good. And the 'chicken wings' was okay. They don't even offer you a glass of water..
When we said thank you to the owner at the end, the owner did not even acknowledge that! I mean come on..Have some decency and show a lil bit of regard for someone who came in and spent all that money on your crappy food...
This place sure deserves a DOUBLE D grade as I personally won't even give it close to a C grade! 
It sure was a dinky, dirty, dungeon DAN..
SORRY, you lost a customer.."}
{"text":"There hasn't been a time that I've dined at Dangerous Dans wherein the service has been good - or, that the food has been worth the obnoxiously rude service. I know the owners and staff pride themselves on their surly demeanour, but I think it's just an excuse to be completely inflexible and discourteous."}
{"text":"This brings cheat day to a whole level. 
Just ate the Kevorkian burger (kudos to whoever named it) and have seldom been  so satisfied. It conquered every craving I could have possibly had prior to eating.  
I had an excellent conversation with the woman working and I thought the junkyard-like booths were very cool. 

If you go in there with this expectation of a gourmet burger with whole wheat buns and a selection of lean bison and turkey, please do not waste our time with a review. 
Go to dans and enjoy every bite! You deserve it."}
{"text":"Visiting Toronto from Vancouver. First stop for food was this burger joint, specifically for the The Elvis burger...a burger with peanut butter, fried bananas and bacon?! It's definitely not what you would expect for your typical burger. Don't let the odd combination deter you. It's seriously amazing. If you like all the ingredients you'll love this burger. I'm going to make my own version when I get home!"}
{"text":"Something about the minivan carseats at each table always gave me a cause for pause in front of Dangerous Dans.  And not in a good way.  The thought of butt-warmed velour upholstery didn't jive with the idea of a dribbling gut-busting carnivore fest, potentially smeared all over it.   TMI?

I finally got over my OCD qualms this weekend and went with Hobo G. for burgers.  I ordered the Kevorkian (because, how can you not) and Hobo G. ordered the mozzarella burger.  The burgers were definitely tasty and for that, I give you a solid 2 stars.  Sadly, my fried onions and mushrooms were barely touched by the griddle and I'm not a big fan of the almost raw toppings that just ended up falling to the wayside on my plate.  The onion rings were cold, although I\"m sure would have been excellent fresh out of the fryer.  Fries were just okay...kind of flabby, good if you like smothering them with ketchup.  Noticed the girl at the table beside me left an entire plate of poutine almost untouched...looked way too soggy. 

The service was gruff.  Avoid eye contact with the dude at the counter if possible.  He yelled at us when he thought we were heading towards a table before it was cleared and told us they wouldn't clean it if we sat down .  Whoa, dude.  I was just moving out of the way, so that the people coming in wouldn't have to stand out in the cold.   

Remain a purist and go for the burgers here, if you can get past the attitude."}
{"text":"If you want greasy food, like, THE BEST greasy food ever, this is the place.  Not sure why other reviewers want some sort of gastro pub burger, there's like three on Queen East.  

We ordered in poutine and burgers, and it was super amazing!  I kind of like that this place is as weird as the good is good! If you want to avoid the attitude, just order in, but the spicy burgers were great, and so were the milkshakes!  =D"}
{"text":"The decor and funny menu brought me in.  I had a vegetarian burger and was a little disappointed that it was not made in house... if burgers are your specialty and you offer a veg option, it should be special, you know?  The topping options were great - I had one with hot peppers and hot sauce.  The fries were all right.  I liked the service (I'm assuming it was Dan)... slightly brusque guy, but entertaining."}
{"text":"A disgusting experience on all counts. The food is bad, the place is not clean and they have a poster of a cow on the women's washroom instead of a sign (whereas the man's has a nice M on the door). 

We ordered 3 different burgers, all ranged between awful and bland. The buns are so bad they don't even deserve to be called buns. But what's even worse than the bad food and service is that cow sign on the washroom, which we discovered as we were about to leave, and the condescending and unapologetic attitude of the guy behind the counter when we confronted him. I've never posted a review here before but this place was truly repulsive. Do yourself a favor and stay away!"}
{"text":"Those 2 stars are all for the food. Don't get me wrong, the brisket burger I had was amazing!! Fries was meh.. but burger was to die for. The white guy with the big beard was a dick... It was my first time there and all I asked was if they have anything with avocado in it. He gave me a cold look and said \"we're not one of those places you're looking for\". I don't think avocado is pretentious when they have red horseradish aioli on the board. In conclusion, food is great! Customer service = none."}
{"text":"The car seats that Dangerous Dan's was known for are now long gone, wondering if the plywood seats are just temporary...I know it's silly but I worry about getting a splinter you know where ;) The burgers are still tasty, big and made to order, but the fries have always had that frozen kind of taste.  Plus they seem really dry, maybe it's because they're the super thick cut or just freezer burn?
Anyhow, I would return for a burger or to try their deep-fried mars bar."}
{"text":"Came here a year ago.

I don't remember the complete specifics but I believe I ordered the gut buster?

Anyways it one of the more larger burgers I've ever had it was ok in taste I think the guy making it may have been a little too sparing on the seasoning as I can only guess by seeing some of their kitchen staff working with beef that they make all their patties in house. I also ordered a deep fried mars bar which was decent but I personally feel its just one of those things you need to experience and whether or not you order it again depends on how you feel your health is at the moment. 

Given if I still did work around that area I may have opted to go here from time to time but not very often this is one of those places you go to when you are enabled cheat days in your diet."}
{"text":"The only reason this bed-bug central of a dump gets 1 star is because I can't possibly rate it any lower. As if being located across from Jilly's (where old strippers go to die) isn't bad enough, this place harbours a special kind of scumbag, who wouldn't know what service was even if it sat on his face. You know who you are, sir. 

Put it this way: if your friends say you're suffering from the case of \"first world problems\", or God forbid, you're feeling suicidal, by all means run to DDs because they will quickly give you a different perspective on life and leave you with lots to ponder. 

I tried entering the place with an open mind, as I always do. I really really did. I was also starving, to boot. I saw the menu, I knew what I was getting into and what sold me was the picture on the back of the menu: it was a frail old man, an alleged founder. How cute. 

Not quite. If Hell's Angels had pageants, the folks behind the counter would take home every award in the following categories:  Foul Mouth of The Year, Most Questionable Personal Hygiene and I Can't Believe These Morons Think I Can Cook. 

I'll skip the description of the interior because it looks like a scrap yard. Enough said. I ordered the chicken sandwich, which seemed like the safest thing to do as far as my coronary was concerned. Bear in mind, I entered the place with my usual sunny disposition that turned cloudily as soon as Mr. Charming behind the counter barked at me to hurry up and order while reaming out one of his employees for picking up Skippy peanut butter instead of a generic brand. Go, entrepreneurial spirit! 

My boyfriend ordered something from the artery-clogging department and I apprehensively agreed to plop on one of those car seat chairs. There was another person sitting across from us, so the fact our food took forever and a day to  be prepared would be surprising if not for the staff members' wandering back and forth, bickering. 

Finally, our food was ready. I couldn't wait to get out of there. The plan was to drive down to Polson Pier and enjoy our food by the water. Sadly, my sandwich didn't make it. No, I didn't devour it like a ferocious pig on my way to the parking lot, it simply fell apart in my hands once I opened the wrapper after a 5 minute drive. The bun basically disintegrated and I applaud myself for being brave enough to give that sordid mess a taste anyhow. First things first, it wasn't toasted. Secondly, the toppings were soggy, wilted or funky-smelling. As for my chicken.....I suspect it died of natural causes. I convinced myself that the chicken sandwich was the restaurant's inside joke of a punishment for those not brave enough for \"real danger\", so I laughed it off, tossed it and asked my date about his burger. Turns out, the entire menu is a big, gigantic joke that only those superstars seem to get. 

One would think I'd avoid this place like a plague but no. I returned there two years later, with my friends, assuming best intentions and hoping that perhaps tonight will be better. You know, the whole \"make every mistake twice, just to be sure\" kind of thing. Luckily for us, we didn't even make it through the front door. I won't repeat verbatim what was said, but the only thing missing from that scene was a gigantic confederate flag. The only regret I had at that point was the fact I was a 5'2 woman and not a 6'4\" beast of a man so I could pummel the ever-lasting snot out of that arrogant prick's face. The day they get the hell off Queen Street and perhaps move under the bridge around Don Jail will be the best thing to ever happen in that neighbourhood. They are the ultimate hork in the face of the food industry."}
{"text":"This review is for a chicken sandwich.  Just that, nothing else.

Completely obscene.  Spongy, unseasoned meat, mealy green tomatoes, flaccid strips of grey-coloured bacon, all topped off with a congealing snotball of processed mozzarella.  Unpleasant.  More prank than meal.  

Defenders will call it \"simple food\", \"diner food\", \"greasy eats\", and so on.  I wouldn't, because I like those things.  What we're discussing here is \"bad\" food.  These are bad versions of otherwise reputable classics.  Burgers can be great, grilled chicken on a bun can be great.  Just not when described as above.

I emphasize this point to disarm those who would goad that any criticism must be rooted in fat phobia.  Bullshit.  If you're going to \"clog your arteries\" (an exhausted cliché), do it with class.  Butter, duck confit, Greek yogurt.  To gain weight from a menu so mishandled would be wasted self-abuse.  

I suspect a lot of folks like to play up the \"danger\" in Dangerous Dan's because they want notoriety for eating so extreme.  In that case: why not chug a glass of melted lard?  Seriously.  If it's such a sport to you.  Why even bother with novelty?  Or bread?  Call up your buddy Craig and try to poison yourselves.  Swallow pig fat together.

I don't know.  It was just a chicken sandwich, didn't cost me much.  You'd be correct in pointing out I haven't tasted any competing items.  But I have certainly seen them, at other tables, and frankly felt no envy.  Same sad toppings, just crammed in with different meats.  Understand my mind was closed by this point.

But maybe it's all incredible, I don't know.  I'm doing two stars because the fries looked alright.  And the staff were nice, despite what they brought me.

It doesn't have to be this way.  Reading the card, there's plenty that sounds appetizing (however absurd).  Montreal's Au Pied De Cochon is similar in spirit, but the difference is that it's a good meal, not an experiment.

If I sound heartbroken, it's for obvious reasons: lost potential.  I like the decor, I like the gentle surliness.  I was simply expecting better food.  If I owned it, I'd change nothing but what's in the fridge.  I don't want my burger joint looking like a jewelery store.

Again, this is not about healthiness.  Be indulgent, be obese.  But why not be selective?  If you're gonna go up four sizes, might as well fill them with the coolest things.

Anyways."}
{"text":"Ok,i like pineapple inside  of the cheese burger.And trust me,even though those chefs look like gangsters ,they are kind! By how? One of the takeout customers was kinda disturbed by the psycho on the street.He did help.Well ,a bonus."}
{"text":"Went there this evening and a cockroach joined us on the table.  I was in shock and killed it with one of the menus then discreetly went to the cash to tell them.  They basically said, yup, they have an old building and what did I expect.  I'll NEVER eat there again."}
{"text":"I don't care, I'm bumping this place up to five-stars.

I'm still not a fan of their fries,and definitely not their mashed potatoes. But my addiction to the BOB and growing addiction to the slightly-healthier option 'The De Niro' means I happily frequent this joint far too often to give anything less than five stars.

I cannot praise that BOB sandwich enough. It's one of the best things I've ever tasted, (And, trust me, just as tasty at 5pm as it is at breakfast time. Last night proved that.)

On a more serious note, their service and general manner of the staff has much improved recently (in my experience, at least). Just because the staff here don't engage in the usual ''Hi, how are you'' ''Good, how are you?!'' ''Good!! What can I get you this lovely fine Saturday?!!! :) :) '' rubbish doesn't mean there's anything wrong with their attitude.

I can always count on this place for a cheap, delicious meal to either eat-in or take-out. No higher praise than that!"}
{"text":"I have been going here for a couple a years. Today was definetly my last. Burgers are huge but dry, tasteless and the buns crack after a bite or two.  The onion rings were mushy and greased even after I tried to pat dry with napkins.  If your looking for huge tasteless, poorly executed food this is your place, otherwise Five Guys, Burger priest or hero burger are WAY BETTER options.  If your lookin for the old fashioned burger joints try Golden Star at yonge and Steeles, or Johnnies at Vic park and sheppard, both great burgs! (order fries with gravy on the side, THE BEST!  Sorry DD but lousy dry burgs and greasy fries/rings just doesn't cut it anymore"}
{"text":"One thing comes to mind when i think about DD's.... truck stop!  Their food is simple.  Mostly burgers and fries... that can come in unbelievable portions... see the Quadruple C, ala the simpsons.   All their seats are taken from old cars, their walls are lined with photos of patrons through the years, and the staff has an attitude to match.

If you are looking for something different than the chique new burger joints that seem to sprout up daily in toronto go check it out..."}
{"text":"To me, Dangerous Dan's is kind of like Transformers: one of those critic-proof entities that everyone is going to go to, regardless of whether or not it's actually any good. 

So what can you say about a place like that? DD is not friendly, comfortable, or even a really good diner. But the sandwiches and burgers are decent, the fries and salads pretty solid. 

It's certainly a Toronto institution, and it's been called the most unhealthy restaurant in the city. So it's worth checking out if only to see what all the fuss is about -- just like Transformers. 

Mostly, what DD has going for it is that it's there. Sometimes, that's enough. In this case, it's enough for a three-star review."}
{"text":"I walked by Dan's this weekend and was drawn in by the promise of a $5, one pound burrito. To be honest, the place looked pretty dirty from the outside so I wasn't expecting much - I had never heard of Dangerous Dans but thought if the outside looked so crappy, the food had to be good.

Once I got inside, I was pretty wowed by the menu. There is a wide selection of burgers, sandwiches, etc all with various combination of heart stopping deep fried ingredients. I quickly got over my initial burrito lust and chose \"the kevorkian\" - a burger smothered with fried onions, pickles, mushrooms, cheese and some sort of mayo. It was pretty delicious. As someone else mentioned the burger was indeed a bit over done, but again, I wasn't expecting much.

I was pleasantly surprised by the staff here. The man who took our order kinda looked like he belonged in a bike gang but was very polite and pleasant to chat to.

They also have a variety of deserts including a deep fried mars bar. I have no desire to eat a deep fried mars bar, but if I did, I would definitely come here to try it.

They are also licensed!"}
{"text":"Amazing and unique burgers 

Grimey looking place but this small diner  serves up huge burgers and shakes

Some seats are actual car seats"}
{"text":"A great diner with massive burgers, piled-high sandwiches, etc.  A pretty extensive menu, though they're most known for their burgers.

I see in certain other reviews that some people are put off by the nature of the service.   My thought is, the Double D is an institution famous for it's sarcastic, gruff service, so you should know what you're in for.  Otherwise it's like complaining about loud music at a nightclub, or nudity at a strip joint.   And, I've been a few times and have only had good service.  If the dude working there shouts for somebody to close a door on a cold day, well, I'd rather have that than some hipster server who sighs, drags their feet, and acts disinterested.  Perhaps we all see different types of behaviour as \"rude.\"

It's good food that might give you a heart attack, but you didn't come here to watch your weight and be healthy did you?   And you get to sit in car seats while you eat, which appeals greatly to my inner 8-year-old boy."}
{"text":"While I'll admit that this review is not necessarily based on a recent visit to this diner but rather an account of accumulated visits. It still is in my opinion an accurate depiction of what to expect/appreciate about this long time establishment.

This place is a greasy spoon at it's finest.  This statement is beyond contestation.  The moment you walk in, your senses are drenched with a plethora of scents pertaining to oiliness, fries, and anything you can fathom that a greasy spoon diner would have so get ready. Keep this in mind because your clothes will also be absorb those smells.

Decor:
Greasy Spoon Diner...enough said...the room's walls are laced with different types of memorabilia / photos that make you feel nostalgic.  I believe they may have done a few interior modifications during the times I've visited but one thing I recalled was the usage of old car seats as the benches  for the larger tables (by large, I mean you could fit 4-6 at most).
The Kitchen is in full view (which is probably the reason why your sensory experience is overloaded with those smells I was talking about.)
As long as you know full well that this is a greasy spoon, your intention should really be coming for the food so decor shouldn't play a huge factor.  Bottom line, it was good enough for me.

Food:
This is what it's all about.  Over the course of my visits, I've made it an effort to try different dishes.  Let's clarify this though; I've only been to this place 3-4 times.  Anymore, I'd be having my own \"coronary\" (in reference to a burger they named)..*insert cheesy laughter*
I'm not sure what I was reading to discover this burger but it was the Coronary Burger that caught my eye.  I'm sure most of you know what this is by now if you've heard of Dangerous Dan's but for the uninformed, it's 2 8oz Patties, 4 Slices of Bacon, 2 Slices of Cheddar and a Fried Egg on top. And you get Fries and Gravy, Can of Pop and Mayo as a garnish. It's crazy I know but I loved willingness to really push the boundaries on food choices.  Health is important I know, but sometimes you need to live a little. 
So the first time I went, I ordered that...and shared it...because I'm not crazy.  I was also in training so this was already a cheat.
I won't say that it was an amazing burger, but because of it's creativity (or fattyness), I enjoyed every minute of it. 
On other occasions I've ordered the Bronto Beef Ribs that were quite huge. (almost the length of my forearm!) They have a lot of other unique sandwiches and burgers that will never be replicated anywhere else and for that level of creativity and novelty I give the rating.  Though it would have been higher if it wasn't for the service.

Service:
You can only expect a certain level of politeness at greasy spoons.  Most of the time people who go to these joints are regulars and they're all friends.  Sometimes when new comers come in, they feel a bit out of place.  It's kind of the culture that's been established in this restaurant typology in my opinion.
But one of the main things that really got to me were the comments made by the chef to me.  I know he was joking but he commented on how I wasn't a man for sharing that darned huge burger.  I also had just  finished a training run and was wearing a bit more tight fitting athletic apparel so he mocked that too.  See what I mean about feeling out of place as a newcomer?  If I had been a regular, those jokes would be permissible because I would have developed a relationship with the chef, but in this case, I was a bit caught off guard.  I know those snarky remarks were just being playful or fun but I'm a big boy and i also acknowledge the culture of these restaurants.
On a side note though, restaurants, no matter what class, should put service high on their priority list.  I hate restaurants that think they can treat customers any way they want because they're already established or famous enough that it doesn't matter.

Overall:
Despite everything, this is a great restaurant for fun times with friends and to try something new.  Just remember these things:
1)wear ghetto clothing
2)\"man\" up and order your own food (thou shalt not share)

I'd still go there again! 


P.S. Did you know there's an even COOLER (fatter) burger Dangerous Dan's has!?!?  Well for your viewing pleasure, one of my friends dared to eat it. Enjoy!

{"text":"Good Day:
Thank you for taking the time to read my review.  I have been a customer for a very long time.  The food quality has quickly declined.  After spending $60.00 for my food for my self and my guests, I certainly was expecting a lot more than what was delivered!  The three entrees were cold and very tasteless.  The coronary burger was so dry and cold that it stuck to the top of my mouth.  It could well step in if you needed to sand your floors, it tasted like sandpaper.  No need to go to Canadian Tire for your sandpaper to sand your floors, just order from Dangerous Dan's.  It will spare you your time and money and they deliver.  I suggest you do not order a milkshake, they forget it and re deliver the milkshake after thirty minutes and it was warm and not palatable.  Cold food and warm milkshakes, not a great combination.  Govern yourself accordingly and choose another restaurant .  Hot hamburgers and cold milkshakes would be expected and it certainly did not deliver.  McDonald's is a much better choice.  My two dogs were not interested in the \"attempt at food\" that was delivered and refused to eat any of it!"}
{"text":"How does this place honestly have such rave reviews? The guy at the front taking orders is an absolute dick(even if its an act, which its not, its not really very funny). The guy yells at his staff and rolls his eyes at you when you have questions. I went here with out of town family and it terrible. Food was below average although it was cheap. Poutine tasted like the fries had been sitting in the freezer for months and had absolutely no taste. Portion sizes are very good. Unfortunately where this place immediately falls short is right when you walk through the door and are \"greeted\" by a complete ass hole telling you that there obviously isn't table service. Im supposed to know that how?? Really disappointing meal and I ended up leaving very angry at the prick who treated me and my family like crap."}
{"text":"What's to say about Dangerous Dan's Diner? How about this place is better than McDonald's, and then some!

I always order take out from here (yes, they do deliver!), and when I do I order the basic burger with large onion rings. This place doesn't disappoint on the burger or the rings-both are big, and taste great. I don't care if they season the meat or not, it's a big burger, and that's enough for me. I haven't ordered any of the other stuff on the menu, but the next time, I think that I will order maybe the Greek Burger or any of the sandwiches, just for variety. The take out order guy is rude, but I've learned to live with it, as the food and the decor is great. Come here or order from here, and you'll never order pizza ever again-I know that I won't."}
{"text":"I had high expectations after seeing this restaurant on You Gotta Eat Here on the Food Network but this place is ridiculously dirty. My burger was gross! It was overflowing with mayo, which came with a piece of dark hair!  *eww* Disgusting! Old car seats used as seating, although unique, felt extremely dirty! Will never eat here again and without a doubt, warn all friends and family."}
{"text":"This place is eternally in purgatory.  It's hard to say whether you're going to go in and come out feeling disgusted, or like you've hit the spot.  It happens to me both ways.  The burgers are fine, I think they're awesome and there's a good variety of different ways of eating a burger.  I think for the most part, they do a good job from grill to topping.  However, their fried stuff is what's disgusting.  Their oil is very dirty and I've seen the unthinkable of deep frying chicken wings in the same fryer used to cook my fries minutes later.  Those fries were disgusting tasting like raw chicken and I was really mad that day 2 years ago where I still remember.  To be safe, I just eat the burgers and feel happy.  The service can be better, but I block it out.  Not many of the type burger joints in Lesliville at the moment.
2.5 stars"}
{"text":"This place has the absolute worst customer service I've ever experienced.  I've eaten here many times because my boyfriend likes the appeal of massive burgers (although he admits they don't even taste that great) but I wouldn't eat here otherwise.

One time I ordered delivery over the phone and the man actually yelled at me and huffed and puffed because I asked him a simple question (I think it was \"what comes on the burger?\"). I couldn't believe how rude he was. I've seen him yell at the cooks too. One time he screamed at a cook to go buy bananas across the street.  The delivery guys are very nice though.

As for the food, the burgers look appealing but really aren't that great. They're usually pretty dry. And the fries are probably the worst fries I've ever had. How can you mess up fries?!?

They do have good milkshakes though. And I did enjoy the deep fried cookie dough.  But until the owner becomes polite I'd rather not support that kind of behaviour."}
{"text":"We were visiting my wife's grandmother when I had this wonderful idea of going to find a nearby burger joint for dinner.  Naturally, I asked Siri!!  Dangerous Dan's was at the top of the list.

I had already heard about this (in)famous place and was more than willing to sample the fare.

Needless to say, food-wise, I was not disappointed.  We got there after what would normally be considered dinner-time, so the place was not packed; however, given the type of seating they have, I would not want to be there during their busy hours.

What makes the diner appealing also keeps it from getting 4-stars from me.  It's no-frills atmosphere, cheesy seating and wonderful window view of Jilly's \"Dance\" bar next door are memorable.  Unfortunately, these are what keep it from getting that 4th star from me.

I had the \"Coronary Burger Special\" which contained, as per their menu:2-8oz Patties, 4 Slices of Bacon, 2 Slices of Cheddar and a Fried Egg on top. Served w/ Fries and Gravy, Can of Pop and Mayo\"...all for $15.25.  Nuff said.  The scary thing is, this wasn't the biggest burger on the menu!!

All-in-all, it was an extremely satisfying burger.  You could tell that it was freshly made, and it was surprisingly not terribly greasy!!  

Yes, I finished everything.

I would recommend this place for those seeking an inexpensive and satisfyingly delicious meal at a place that is somewhat of a landmark in the area.  It may be a bit too cheesy for the Burger's Priest-loving crowd, but if you don't care about the decor and just want a good specialty burger that's not too expensive, you owe it to yourself to eat here."}
{"text":"I kept hearing about this place, so I finally went to check it out. I got the kahuna burger. It was massive. Definitely some solid artery clogging eats here, which isn't my usual jam so that's why I'm giving it a 3 star rating. The burger was good though, but I tapped out half way through. Got the onion rings too, good 'ol standard onion rings. I dig the atmosphere and they have well priced beer on their menu.

If you're into lots of meat and an old school burger with no frills, this is the place to go. They don't skimp on the meat.

Note: The women's bathroom has a cow on it. If you're a woman and need to wash your hands after eating a burger (and you will) enter the room with a cow on it."}
{"text":"I came here about a month ago, and the experience is still sticking with me. 

The lady at the front was nice and enthusiastic about the menu, which was great, but it was all downhill from there. 

Even with the low prices they are offering, and the prime location, they can and should do better. Bun was cold, beef patty was not seasoned, fake cheese not melted, tomato so thick, the burger falls over when it's set on the table. It didn't taste fresh at all. The onion rings were tasty, but was oily and very dark from using old oil. It was not a satisfying experience.

Bench car seats I thought were unique and fun through the window, but are really quite old and gross up close.

Two burgers, an order of onion rings and one bottle of water came to just under $20. What more do you want?"}
{"text":"I agree with other reviews - McDonald's is far superior is both quality and service.

Staff is incredibly rude and the burgers are unpalatable."}
{"text":"Great place,  big handmade burgers with lots of natural taste,  and impossible to leave unfulfilled.  
Yes,  the manager is a little gruff (but polite!) ,  but that is part of the diner experience. 
Far,  far,  far better than any fast food burger place,  and for basically the same price.  Highly recommended if you need a beef craving fulfilled."}
{"text":"Well, if you've ever asked yourself what would Elvis want on a burger,
at Dangerous Dan's for $5.99 an Elvis burger can be all yours.

A hunk of meat... with bacon, peanut butter and a Fried Banana!

If I'm feeling self destructive, there's always the option of overdosing on calories from the Big Kevorkian burger.  Onion ring, fried mushrooms, fried bacon, deep fried pickle and garlic mayo!

Lol, I still ask them to hold the mayo.

I've had way better burgers.
...But Dangerous Dan's does have it's unique dive charm.
* The cooks are rude and unpleasant.
* There is a faded Simpsons poster from the 80's.
* There have gross, beaten down old car seats for seating, probably from a nearby alley.
* It's directly across the street from Jilly's, so if you fancy a dirty-grungy lap-dance you can have an equally dirty-grungy meal.  =P

Also, the desserts are sort of deep fried fun!
The Cookie Cow Pie was a giant fried cookie with whip ($ 5.30).
And how can you not be curious about the Tasty Wang ($5.30).
Deep fried banana with 2 balls of ice cream.  
And it's pretty impressive!   Just get your fork in first so you don't have to settle for sloppy seconds."}
{"text":"I've been gone but now I'm back. Let's talk about  Dangerous Dan's. 

The only thing dangerous about Dans is the decor. The table seats are old seats from cars. It's kind of cool. The whole place seems a little unsanitary but that's alright I suppose... I suppose.....

The food itself was what can best be described as \"decent\". It was alright, I didn't mind it, but I didn't love it either. The quality was fine but the burger was cooked a little bit too much for my liking, not too juicy at all. Good, but not wonderful. It;s a long distance from me, if it were closer I'd have it again but it's just not worth it as it stands.

The service was alright. Friendly enough. The staff appeared to be a rough crew. They were friendly enough but still had that \"tough\" appearance.

Go if you live in the area, but don't go out of your way."}
{"text":"My fiancée and I have been huge fans of Dangerous Dan's for years now! Everything we have had has been nothing but awesome and they even went out of their way one time to drive out of their delivery zone for us, just because we loved their food and well ordered a lot of food. (However if they are packed on a Friday/Saturday Night, don't expect it to happen..) which is understandable! However, if you go here you need to get their deep fried mars bar!! It's delicious. By far the best we have ever had. It's not your cheap corn dog deep fry, it's legit light and crispy deliciousness!! It's very decadent but so worth every damn bite.. also their pulled pork is amazing same with their chicken sandwiches! Overall a great meal, excellent portions. Now go and grab that Deep Fried Mar's Bar, what are you waiting for!! =D"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I came here for lunch. She ordered a burger, and I went for the open face turkey sandwich. 

We obviously were not expecting anything gourmet, but we were severely disappointed. Not only did we wait for over 30 minutes (there was one other couple there besides us).. But once the food arrived, it was horrible. The turkey sandwich had mealy gravy and watery mashed potatoes. My girlfriends burger was dry and over cooked and came with lettuce that had dripped a massive puddle of water all over the plate. We also ordered feta and garlic fries that were so ridiculously garlicky that they burned our mouths. 

Never again!"}
{"text":"I first heard of Dangerous Dan's when I was in college, living in Etobicoke, and it was so far away that I would never think to check it out. Friends would tell me about the disgusting portions and grimy seating. I'd wanted to check it out, but not enough to travel. When I moved to the east end years later, I was surprised to find this place a block away, and had to give it a try. 

I've matured, I guess, since I was in college and was attracted to a restaurant that is grimy. Today, I'm not a fan of the decor. Don't mistake griminess for uncleanliness. The place is clean... I didn't feel like the place was dirty...  I just found the van seating to be terribly uncomfortable. I know this is all part of the appeal of the place for some people, but I'd love to be able to come here and sit on a real chair at a table made this century. 

I make a pretty good burger, so when I go out to eat, I want something better than I can make myself. I don't put anything but cheese on my burgers, and let the meat speak for itself. In that respect, Dan's burgers have a lot to say. You're getting good beef on your burger, and it's full of flavour. 

The staff is always friendly and chit-chatty.  The portions are very generous. If we're feeling lazy, my girlfriend and I will just pick up a small order of fries to go with whatever else we're making for dinner, and a small is large enough to split between two people. Their friendly staff and good portions are in perfect contrast to Burgershoppe down the street. 

I love this place. I just don't feel comfortable eating here. I only live a 5 minute walk away, so it's easy to grab take-out. Writing this review has made me hungry. Is that crazy? I might grab a burger here tonight."}
{"text":"Ah, Dangerous Dan's. The double-D is kind of a legend in it's own char-grilled mind, what with the ridiculously low-class interior, chairs made out of minivan bench seats and anti-vegetarian slogans scrawled on the walls.

I hit this place for the first time with a couple of friends on a rainy Sunday. We all needed a good burger and Dan's came through!

I had the Big Shroom Burger: a big, nicely falling-apart patty with a whack of saucy sauteed mushrooms (shiitake, button and oyster I think) on top.

Sides are extra here, but the order of fries I got was ample. Some of the fries were basically half a potato! They were solid, starchy, ketchup and vinegar catchers -- good if not anything mind blowing.

My friends enjoyed a mozzarella burger and a Philly cheese-steak, though I was too occupied with my burger to taste theirs. We also were lucky to have the undivided attention of the portly guy in overalls behind the counter (Dan, I am guessing?) who made crude jokes both at and with us. 

After we had cleaned our plates \"Dan\" surprised us by slapping down a deep fried battered banana with ice cream on our table. Free dessert! Ok, so he might have referred to it as his \"wang\" (maybe this not the place to take Grandma?) but hey, free food is free food. And the banana was actually really good!

Dangerous Dan's is a place that walks the talk from the posters on the wall (\"22% of Ontarians are Obese. . . We can do better!) to the crass, funny staff. It's a verite low-brow diner experience but a damn tasty one. If you're not trying to impress anyone, you're not on a diet and you don't want to blow more than $10, I would recommend this place in a heartbeat -- though it could be your last!"}
{"text":"This place is closing May 29, 2017. I have not been in a long time but will make a point to get over there before they shut down. Hefty fare with lots of taste. In the past service was efficient but not very friendly. When I lived in the area I would pick up take out food semi-regularly. With the news they are closing I will make a special trip for one last greasy, delicious meal."}
{"text":"I'm a vegetarian, so I can't review the meat burgers, aside from the fact that it's an old fashioned diner and the burgers are made on a grill behind the counter. The poutine is what I came here for. Of course, if you are going to Dangerous Dan's you have to go all the way.  Crunchy, cheesy and smothered in gravy- it's pretty much what you would expect. The Tree hugger burger is better than some, not as good as others. I felt like I was driving my old Plymouth Voyager captain chair as I ate."}
{"text":"Anytime I try to search for a Toronto best burger list, this place always comes up. The reviews were never high enough for me to actually make an effort to go so when I wandered into the area by accident, I just had to try it. My expectations were never really that high. 

When a place brags about being really unhealthy I expect awesome. It was not, at all! I tried the kevorkian and the big cheese, half of each of course. While the idea is there, the execution needs work. The burger had no char in it, the cheese could have been melted, the bread could have been toasted, etc instead, I got a sandwich that looked like it was assembled by someone at gunpoint who just had 30 seconds to do it. Let me note that only two tables were occupied at that time.

In summary, mediocre burgers not to mention the place was a pigsty. The only thing going for it is that the prices are pretty decent. 7$ a burger isn't bad."}
{"text":"LOVE this place!! Their burgers are amazing! And so are the people who work there. Only discovered it a few months ago and have gone three times already! So sad its closing soon!! :("}
{"text":"The burgers were deliciously with mushrooms onion and onion ring. The beef patty was HUGE. The guy at the cashier looks like the owner and he's got messages on the blackboard about millennials. He yells at his young staff every few minutes and I felt bad for them. How he retains workers is a mystery."}
{"text":"Maybe I expected more, but I was a bit disappointed. The 3-start \"A-OK\" rating applies here.

The burger was far too tall, the bun fell apart, and the burger itself was overcooked. The peanut butter shake tasted okay, but about halfway it became too foamy to drink via a straw, and I had to use a spoon. The fries with pulled pork on it? It was akin to mccain fries with a spoon of pulled pork throw on it (which I'll admit was good).

It's a diner, but I was still pretty underwhelmed."}
{"text":"Found this place truly by accident. I made the mistake of not factoring km's vs miles- doh, and set out walking to Home Depot from the hockey hall of fame and missed it was 5 km's not 5 mile maybe is was the new math or the fact I'm from California or the fact that my navi doesn't work here, thank Sprint!
Anyways I ordered the Big Pig big ass burger with peameal and bacon. I am sure i shortened my life by a few years but at 4.5 km's of our walk I thought we deserved it. My partner got the Big Kahuna- back bacon cheese and a pineapple slice. 2 fries and a couple pints steam whistle and flying monkey.
The burger was pretty damn good, big homemade and good taste. Maybe a little greasy but it went down well. The fries were not frozen as some else here said, big wedge kind. And the pints well what can I say cold and good.
The place was cool, I had no problem eating off of a sheet of plywood while sitting on old astrovan seats. The people were straight forward and no BS there.
I recommend it for a fun time and next time I will take cab to Gerrard square."}
{"text":"Gotta give dangerous ds that they know a good burger. some topping combos u question but it always works. Interior is totally Divey but u gotta love it! You get your money's worth at a great price. Location is right along queen line at broadview. Super convenient. Delicious. Cheap. Who can complain?"}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of their burger. Yes it's not the best atmosphere or service but what are you ? A king? No. You're here for good burgers. Stop being so whiny. Reviews on service are so pointless. You don't like it don't go out."}
{"text":"This place makes a great burger. Been here a few times i always get The Big Cheese - Feta, Mozzerella, Cheddar and Blue Cheese with Garlic Dressing and Onions $ 6.99. This burger is amazing. Just not a fan of the fries they taste like pure oil. But if you just want the burger dan's is the place to be. Dan's make a better burger then the priest."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a hip hangout where tendy people nosh on organic food while working on laptops and attractive waitresses fawn over you, don't eat here.
If you want a big, oozing burger and don't wanna pay extra for ambiance, then this might be the place for you.
The burgers rock. The staff are funny. The location is convenient to the Opera House. The prices are cheap for what you get. What more could a burgervore want in a diner?"}
{"text":"I had found memories of drinking $10 pitchers on the dirty Astro van seats at Dangerous Dan's before a concert at the Opera House. I returned last week, and it must be true that your memories are better than the reality. It looks like they've picked up some prime new seating from the scrap yard - it's no where near as dirty as I remembered. The food is still as cheap, gigantic, and heart attack inducing as ever. However, it's just not that good. I ordered the pig - a burger topped with cheese, four strips of bacon, and two pieces of peameal bacon. Everything was overcooked, the bacon even burnt, and completely dried out. The burger had such high potential... what a waste. Dangerous Dan's is a great place stop in for a cheap drink before a concert, but I won't be eating there again."}
{"text":"Very good burgers. Love the sayings and quotes posted up around the diner. It is what it is and makes no excuses to try and be anything else."}
{"text":"Awesome! Chilled vibe, wicked menu, fresh burgers. Perogie Poutine was really weird but but I enjoyed it. Lots of cheese curds and definately not stingy on the gravy. 
Burger was cooked perfectly and had great flavor. Upon ordering it was recommended not to add any other topping than what it came with as to enjoy the flavors of the cheeses and I'm glad I listened cuz it was amazeballs!! Will definately be back."}
{"text":"You can't go to DD and expect a 5 star restaurant, what you can expect is amazinggg food thats terrible for you but always hits the spot if you're in the mood for something that isn't healthy. I usually take out. My favourite thing there is the elvis milkshake, and I don't usually like milkshakes- so good."}
{"text":"I have never been inside Dangerous Dan's but my husband & I order delivery from them all the time. The food is amazing & the customer service is always really good. They tell you the truth when they are really busy & delivery will take over an hour. The drivers are always polite & carry change."}
{"text":"Local Micro Brew Beers, Excessive deserts and meals with tons of MEAT. If you dont like this place then I simply wish to never associate with you."}
{"text":"Went here after a walk wanted to see if it was better then the \"other\" burger place down the street. Well it wasn't, it's a big burger yes but even with all the topping bacon cheese onion rings mushrooms and more it still seems like it's missing something. The burger did fall apart into 6pieces after the first bite lol don't know how to feel about that."}
{"text":"I had been a customer here multiple times, but when I came in to use the bathroom the people working there rudely said I couldn't use the bathroom unless I was a customer. I replied politely that I had been a customer. Their response was that that didn't make me a customer today. I guess they'd rather lose business then let people use their washroom. They certainly lost me as a customer!"}
{"text":"This burger joint is not bad. For the price, it's just right.  What people fail to mention in their reviews is that the food is generally not expensive compared to other \"Specialty\" burger joints.

The burger was all right, but the meat patty fell apart easily and there were too many topping and condiments on it. The small fry was actually pretty huge, I could only finish half of it. I only tried this place out because co-workers said it was to die for. Unfortunately I disagree.

It feels kind of dirty inside. The seats in the place are old car seats and they are pretty dirty and worn out.  The floor is full of dirt and the place looks like it was built and decorated 50 years ago.

3.5 Stars because it was tasty, but too many knocks overall."}
{"text":"I've been coming here a couple of times a week since January.  I really wanted to try their burgers when I first came.  But I got hooked on the BBQ brisket and pulled pork instead.
They have amazing brisket.  Never dried out and a killer BBQ sauce!  I love it!!!
Today I took a walk on the wild side.  I finally ordered a burger with cedar and bacon.
Let start off with what amazes me.  All these chi chi, high end burger places in Toronto and they all use processed cheese.  Processed cheese isn't real cheese folks!
DD's uses real cheddar that tastes like cheese.  The bacon isn't burnt or over cooked.  The toppings are fresh.  The burger isn't over spiced.
It was fan bleepin' tactic!!!  Right to the last bite.
Now I'm old and set in my old school ways.  I usually like a smaller burger that is very juicy like I had in my childhood in the '60's.  But this was a big burger.  It was juicy and just the right size.
When I order the smaller hamburgers at other places I have to order 4 or 5.
Now I'm usually a picky cuss when it comes to customer service.  But the staff here makes you feel at home.  Everyone here feels comfortable enough to give you your space, but also to talk to you.
So all in all this place is a 5 out of 5 for me.  Now sure the decor is beat up and faded.  But that's the charm of it all.  But in spite of that, you know what?  It is spic and span clean.  The tables are promptly washed.  The floor is clean and the only thing I smelt was the odour of grilling meat."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery from these clowns and never have I experienced being treated so rude - I felt as if the man who was taking my order was genuinely hostile to me.

Simple questions to make sure my order was on spot was replied with a sarcastic and gruff tone.  If I wasn't ordering for the entire office, I'd cancel it right then and there and tell them not to bother.

ON TOP of all that, I was overcharged for the entire order, which I paid out of my own pocket because I didn't want to bother with the fuss of arguing with the a-hole on the phone again.  Despite their reputation and slogan being \"The Burgers are Bigger at the Double D\" - I'd go so far as saying that the \"Double D\" stands for \"D!ck and Douchebag\".

Makes me wonder how they survived this long with such a shitty attitude towards their customers.

Edit: I was being too generous with 2 stars."}
{"text":"I live across the street from this place, and it's become my \"joint\" in a sense.

Dan's has a reputation for being rude, but as long as you sit down first and come up to order when you're ready, I've never seen any problems. While this isn't necessarily clear, the staff almost always points it out before getting rude. If you show up a couple of times and follow their system, they become really friendly .and you gain some kind of \"regular\" status. 

The food is greasy, but that is advertised well in advance. These aren't health burgers and I wouldn't eat them too often, but I've never seen a place that mapped together \"greasy  burger\" and \"vegetarian burger\" as effectively as the \"Double D\". I think their highlights are their perogies, fries and onion rings, but their gravy is not vegetarian (in case you care about that) and they sometimes slop it on a little too generously for my liking.

Their beer selection, while small, isn't too bad. They serve coffee from Merchants of Green Earth, and they sell it for pretty cheap. It's too bad they aren't a coffee shop, because I actually enjoy their level of sass now that I've earned their good graces."}
{"text":"Not for the faint of heart (literally, don't go here if you're concerned about cardio issues), but if you're after a tasty burger at reasonable prices, the double D can't be beat. If you're feeling adventurous, they have a range of ridiculous burgers too (PB+bacon+cheeseburger anyone?). PS The dude is a bit of an asshole, don't let that put you off, I think it's just his shtick."}
{"text":"I think it was either the Garlicky flavour or what they use in the Burger Patty Seasoning that didn't make the Quadruple C Burger something I enjoyed. 

I fully understand that cooking such a massive Meatball makes it virtually impossible to get good char-marks on the Patty, therefore less savouriness ratio to internal bland ground meatiness.  At the same time, as a Cook, you have to think of the internal safe temperature of the Meat even at the expense of overcooking which does take some skill to perfect every single time without sending customers to the hospital night in night out.  (+0.5 *Star*) 

I'm thinking of it in terms of how anyone else would even attempt making such a Meatball Burger feat. Unless you put a few extra spoonfuls of each seasoning in the Patty, it's not possible. 2.5 *Star*

If you add that, the Quad C Burger would even be more DEADLY than what we had. One of the 4 of us would have been sent to the hospital on some kind of overdose. With this in mind, anyone asking for this specialty item is basically knowingly going in to review it sub-par before the Burger is even consumed, myself included.

In comparison though, I still have other Burgers I liked better therefore my reason for my rating. I didn't mind the Dodge Caravan seating that I actually had as a sofa seat in my home way back when, same dirty ghetto style, no joke. Didn't feel like home though, if you were wondering. 

Poutine was A-OK reminiscent of my High-school Fries + Gravy days. Decor a bit like Dutch Dreams with all those Cow settings. No waiter/waitress service, just go up and order&pay. Food does get dished out to your table."}
{"text":"My friend and I went there a few days ago, for the first time. I'm glad they have a website so I could check out the menu, although it's way out of date (missing so many items, with outdated prices) but it still gives you a general idea of what to expect.

Original review: 10/2013
\"The Big Pig\" and \"The Elvis\" (and Large Fries)

I got the Big Pig. It was delicious! The burger patty was moist and juicy. The bacon was awesome. The peameal bacon and cheese pair really well with it, and it had a ton of mayo. All the excess mayo was a bit messy, but when it poured out of my burger, I used it as a dip for my fries. Haha. I'd definitely get that again.

My friend got the Elvis. He said it was good, but commented that the peanut butter and fried banana were overpowering, which made it difficult to fully appreciate the meats. Our consensus: the idea of the Elvis is interesting, but the flavours aren't balanced, because you want to taste each ingredient in some way. Peanut butter is a very strong substance. Too strong, it seems.

We shared an order of large fries. I like their fries... thick cut and nice flavour. The portion was good and we were satisfied with them.

The atmosphere is weird with the car seating (which are fine if you're sitting back, but uncomfortable for a \"lean forward to eat' position) but it was an enjoyable experience overall. We paid $22 for the two burgers and fries, after tax.

It's way out in the middle of nowhere, but this is one place where I will tolerate the commute and the relatively high cost because it's tasty and offers some fun varieties.

I'd give it 5 stars:
- if the prices were about 15% cheaper
- if they didn't have those car seats
- if they dropped the 'we don't care' surly attitude they're known for
- if they updated their website***

***As another example, The Big Pig on their website says that it has 4 slices of regular bacon but their updated menu shows that it only comes with 2, and since the website has old pricing, it now costs more. Less food for more money? I'm disappointed, but that would have been avoided if they simply kept the site up to date.

Even with those small gripes, we'll still go back, but not too often. It's not cheap and it's not near anything.

Second Visit: 04/2014
\"The Big Cowboy\" and \"The Big Pig\"

We both wanted to try something new. I decided on the Big Cowboy. It had its ups and downs.

Pros: The beef + bacon + chipotle mayo complimented each other nicely. That mayo was messy, but really tasty. It wasn't spicy, which is good. It just had a nice chipotle flavour.
Cons: The egg didn't add much to it (if anything) and unfortunately the beans do NOT stay on it no matter what. They simply fell off the burger onto my plate, and I ended up eating maybe 80% of the baked beans with my fork afterwards. They tasted nice even then, but I can eat stand-alone baked beans any time. I wanted them on the burger, and this didn't deliver.

After seeing how good it looked, my friend had decided he'll try the Big Pig the next time. Overall, he said it was great, and way better than the Elvis since you could taste every ingredient nicely. He added mushrooms (+$1.15) and said they were grilled nicely and enhanced the flavour.

We're still likely to go back. I just wish they'd fix some of those small gripes I noted in my original review."}
{"text":"Second time visiting and ordering the gyro sandwich.  

Not exactly how I had remembered, but it had to have been at least a year since I visited last.  It was still yummy, decently portioned and the hot peppers just added to it.  Only complaint was that it was leaking.. But that's where the use of a plate comes in to play. 

But I digress...

The poutine we ordered had much left to be desired.  Wedge fries swimming in a pool of watery gravy.  And maybe 2 large chunks of cheese curd and some rather tiny. Nonexistent pieces swimming about.  Looked like end of package or 'bottom of the barrel' kinda deal.  

Decor is not my favourite, but I really can't complain because downtown is always made up of little placed with character.  Not exactly a place for a first date, but to grab some food before a metal show.. hell yes."}
{"text":"With the plethora of burger places in Toronto, I feel I can never eat the same burger back to back! Overall, Dangerous Dan's makes a decent burger, but it's way too greasy. No ones wants to feel like a nap right after a burger! Positives: kitchy cool atmosphere and decent beer on tap."}
{"text":"Nothing special going on here but good gimmicks. Everyone had heard about the coronary burger but honestly, their burgers are fairly bland. I usually judge a burger by the taste of the patty, not how much or what combination of crap they drown the patty in. Unfortunately, this place like the majority of places, is one that drowns bland meat in toppings.

Even though I like their disdain for millennial snobs, I find the trendy indifferent attitude of their staff just as bad because let's face it, it's the exact same thing.

I'll be sad to see this place go but only because I hate to see history in Toronto neighborhoods ruined...The food I can get anywhere."}
{"text":"Ugh!  I was a friend's place tonight and we decided to order delivery from Dangerous Dan's Diner...WTH were we thinking?  

First of all, we ordered 3 burgers, 2 small fries, one Greek salad and a side of gravy.  My friends live about 5 minutes' walk from this place and it took over an HOUR for our teeny tiny order to be delivered!  

When the food did finally arrived, it was greasy, the meat patty was HUGE and the cheese was disgusting.  We all ordered the same burger, the peameal and cheddar burger.  My bun was soggy and my fries were cold.  The gravy was so thick that the fries actually stood up in the gravy!  Blech!

Basically, service was super slow, prices were okay but the food was disgusting...however, it's a burger joint and it's called Dangerous Dan's for a reason.  You pays your money, you takes your chances baby!"}
{"text":"I just had my wisdom teeth out on December 16, so if you've ever had that, you know there isn't really much you can eat.  My boyfriend, who knew I was pretty much useless in the food department, bought himself dinner from the D, and got me a milkshake.  Seemed reasonable.  OH MY GOD.  I don't think anything has ever tasted so good to me.  The milkshake was more of a creamy delicious milk, not so much a milkshake, but I thought it was absolutely perfect.  A couple days later my parents were down, and I was told I should try to eat some \"hard\" food.  So, I suggested the D.  I was desperately craving the milkshake.  My mom got the Philly cheesesteak sandwhich, my dad got something yummy looking (completely forgot though) and I got fries with gravy, and of course, my milkshake.  I tried some of the philly cheesesteak, and it was absolutely delicious.  So messy it reminded me of a sloppy joe, but the onions were sauteed beautifully, the steak was nice and tender, and the sauce was to die for.  The fries were very obviously home-made and freshly cooked.  The gravy was something that was probably made with the drippings from the steak they cooked, and was also delicious.  No one had any complaints, and they would both go back.

Since then, I've returned numerous times, only ever ordering the Philly Cheesesteak sans mushrooms, fries with gravy, and a milkshake.  In all honesty, that milkshake is probably the number one reason I keep going back.

I would definitely suggest this to anyone, reasonable menu.  The prices seem a bit high, but all in all I guess worth the price for \"home-made\" food.  It's not like there's so much left over that it's good for two meals, but almost like a higher quality McDonalds I guess.
All in all, good restaurant, have only ordered delivery, so I've never actually been in the place before, but I have never ordered anything different in the 5+ times I've ordered from here.  Definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"portions were big but burger was a bit overcooked, over charred, the fries were big wedges but quite bland. probably won't be going again unless desperate and hungry"}
{"text":"Really disappointed with Dangerous Dan's Diner. Read mixed reviews but was expecting at least average burgers. I had the cornary burger which came with fries and a pop. The burger looked great. It was massive with tons of toppings including a fried egg and bacon. Unfortunately I found the burger and fries pretty crappy. 

The beef had little to no taste and the bun was way too thick. Also couldn't taste much  of the toppings. The fries were even more disappointing."}
{"text":"I really don't know what other reviewers are going on about in terms of the service and attitudes of the staff.. Came in here after the lunch rush on a Tuesday, was greeted at the door by the gentleman at the register (who later told me he was the grandson of Dan), and directed to grab a menu, pick a seat, and order at the register when ready.  He was friendly but not in that flamboyant, annoying, Jack Astors kind of way, which was refreshing.  I get tired of overly chipper staff at times and this was a breath of fresh air.  If you prefer over-animated clowns serving your food and interrupting you every 5 seconds, go elsewhere.  If you just want good food, at good prices, from decent people that let you be (but are there if you need something), come here.

Ordered the Big Kevorkian burger and dammmmn for $6.99 this is a great deal, and an awesome burger.  It's not as fru-fru like the expensive joints like Burger's Priest but it beats them in both greasiness and flavour.  Onions, mushrooms, bacon, garlic dressing, mayo, fried pickle - let's face it - you're not eating burgers as a health food, so a bit of greasy meat isn't a bad thing here and the whole thing came together into a perfect afternoon-coma-inducing caloric feast.

Decor was car seats which was different and interesting.  It works & it's comfortable, and definitely a novelty (these are real car seats, not those fake things like in Vaughan Mills' food court) - again don't come in here expecting fine dining.  But it was just plain old fricking good - I'll be back next time I'm in the area 100%."}
{"text":"Awesome place if you want to treat yourself to some very bad for you food.. Try the De Niro!"}
{"text":"Staff lives up to their surly and rude reputation. 

Burger's were all great concepts, but the execution was lacking. 
Walked in and sat down, other customers had to let us know where menu's were (tiny and hidden), and how the operation worked in general.
Person taking our order seemed exasperated with us for even ordering. 
Food was quick, but hamburger was bland."}
{"text":"When I was at another newer burger joint just up Queen, I eavesdropped in on a conversation between the owner and a patron. He was saying how it was just an honour to be included in the same article as Dangerous Dan's. Considering how good the burger I had there was, and how much respect he had for DD, I figured it must be incredible.

Sadly, it didn't live up to that hype. The burger I ordered was pretty good. I got the Greek burger. The beef itself had some pretty good flavor, even when it was falling apart back onto my plate. What wasn't as good was the way I felt the rest of the night.

It wasn't just me, but I can only speak for myself. I did not feel good. The burger did not warrant the way I felt the rest of the night. I do not have a weak stomach either. I can eat burritos and burgers by the truck load and laugh it off, but something didn't sit right with this burger.

It was decent and had I not felt sick afterward, I may have returned. I don't think that'll happen now."}
{"text":"Lived around the corner for years and always curious. Not impressed. Went for wings, which took for ever and were not spicy enough. Next time I want wings, will go to a pub, or make better ones at home."}
{"text":"Its kind of hard to write this because I liked the burger except for one thing, I chipped a tooth on something in it.  It may have been bone or gristle but I crunched down on it none the less.  I didn't even know how bad it was until I got home and had something cold to drink that didn't come through a straw.

The car seats are a cool idea but not comfortable and I don't think car fabric is the most sanitary thing to have in a restaurant.  

I would have given this place a higher review especially since I loved the Elvis shake but when a lunch requires me to see my dentist its an automatic fail."}
{"text":"I am writing this review based on an experience years ago that was enough of an turn-off for me to stop going here again and from recommending it to others, and a recent similar experience from a buddy reminded me once again of it. It's pathetic really, how I would like to tell friends Dangerous Dan's is the place to get the best greasy burger in the city when asked (because it's the only place that comes to my mind, even though it has that reputation anyways--it's the closest thing we have to Vegas' infamous Heart Attack Grill), but I cannot. 

These folks have been serving handmade patties long before gourmet burgers became a trend. The burgers here are big, cheap, decadent and shamelessly greasy. Not holy grail good, but satisfying enough to put your hunger to shame. Maybe a bit too greasy--by contrast their poutine is one of the worse and most tasteless I had, but damn they give you a lot. They show no shame in serving the infamous \"Quadruple C\" meal (the kind of extreme food worthy of a Man vs. Food episode), in taking pot shots at vegetarians and references to the munchies (is it 4:20 yet?), and in their grimy dive diner decor and iconic car seats (which I find to be hilarious and unique).

Apparently that entitled sense of don't-give-a-damn, it's-my-way-or-the-highway extends to the quality of service you get here, or lack thereof. I can tolerate being totally ignored except when requesting service, but I draw the line at \"would you like a dose of complacent bitchiness to go with your fries with that?\"

When you walk in to dine in, you are greeted with the grumpy voice of a thickly bearded man (who i believe is the owner, but could be wrong) who reminds you to place your order at front; they explicitly do not do table service. They expect your party to order before claiming a table, rather than claim a table before deciding what to get--impractical since there isn't a lot of space to maneuver at the entrance where the cashier's at.

The treatment I recall getting the last time I ever ate here was the guy rolling his eyes and being less than helpful when a friend asked about toppings, and exclaiming, \"C'mon guys, hurry it up, I don't have all day to take orders,\" when it came to my turn. Clearly their way of doing things isn't working. And oh, we got to hear the guy berate a staff for a mistake. This isn't Hell's Kitchen, is it?

Those who are regulars or have thick skin can probably get past this jerk customer service attitude problem, but I find it fucking off-putting--he is more of a jerk than even the rudest TTC driver I have encountered. Holy fuck, I'd prefer pretentious hipster attitude over these guys' brand of service. Now imagine if you were new--you might just feel like you and everyone else at the \"Double D\" is dumb and a damned burden for coming here. 

It's to say in summary, in terms of service, Dan's is hopelessly terminally fucked.

Yeah, I'm not gonna bloody bother frequenting businesses that displays that kind of dick attitude; I don't care how good the stuff is. Yet it amazes me this establishment continues to thrive to this day despite the well-documented rude-ass contemptuous reputation. Which I attribute to the business they get from burger aficionados and hipsters (many stumbling in hungry after a gig at the nearby Opera House, or perhaps drunkenly and stoned-to-oblivion mistaken Riverside for Parkdale), and some TV appearances (including on Burger Wars, which they didn't win). There's quite some complacency from what I gathered.

This local hipster-magnet \"burger institution\" is in my neighborhood, and every time I walk past it I see signs on the door expressing passive-aggressive disdain for non-customers using the toilet and people standing at the door (see attached image), which says a lot about the general misanthropic outlook of Dangerous Dan's. I suppose they see no reason to get their fucking act together. Why is it that the most highly raved about and highly recommended burger joints in Toronto are ones where I have been severely less than impressed?!

If you want to make a pilgrimage to the \"Double D\" and can get past the potentially off-putting service attitude, be my guest. Good thing they offer takeout and delivery around the area. May be a good idea to be sure your life insurance policy is up to date. 

{TTC: If you know how to get to Jilly's by streetcar, then therefore you know how to get to Dan's by streetcar! I don't all day to give you public transit instructions. }"}
{"text":"One of the best burgers in Toronto.
5 star for the taste but 1 Star for cleanliness of interior.
Overall good place for takeout"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with my lovely...We had the feta and tzatziki fries. I had the Big Pig which was packed with meat, bacon, cheese, tomatoes and all kinda yummy stuff! It wasn't the best, I was kind of disappointed with the meat - no flavor to it at all :( But all the piggie stuff was delish!! The fries were crispy and there was sooooo much feta

I love the layout, the car chairs are amazing and all the staff were friendly and easy going. It isn't the cleanest place on earth but meh, I don't really care unless i get food poisoning or something :D

Stoners' heaven for sure...it's 4:20 somewhere!"}
{"text":"No fancy settings, you are here just for the food.
Uncomfortable wood benches and real car bucket seats. But the staffs are nice there.
I ordered the The Big Cowboy -  Baked Beans, egg, Bacon, Chipotle mayo. Tasted really good with just the right amount of mayo. And the Elvis Shake (Chocolate, Peanut Butter & banana) is just devilish.
For $13.....will visit again."}
{"text":"Fantastic options of interesting burgers, with flavour combos you would never think to mix together, but put a surprising taste in your mouth!"}
{"text":"yep. your typical \"we don't take shit from anyone and you will like our deliciously fattening burger or get the eff out\". in fact, the huge dude at the grill overhead our convo and came out to the table (there's no table service, fyi) just to give my friend shit, telling him to not expect his food b4 the the pretty ladies' foods. LOL. it's like a dirtier version of the revered Vortex in Atlanta, GA. i'm a fan of the prices.
i had the Big Cheese with poutine - i'm a tiny girl, but i do eat a lot... this definitely put me in a happy food coma tho. hah. i'm not one to care about healthy eating when i step into a place like dangerous dan's, and you shouldn't be, either. in fact, the grease mixed with the ultimate dive-y vibe of the place simply put me right at home. i'm a little white-trash on the inside."}
{"text":"3.5 / 5

Dangerous Dan's is a bit of a mixed bag overall.  There are some solid positives and some bad negatives.

To begin with, the food is good, so if that's all your looking for then this place will be your thing.  I got the big shroom burger, which was an 8oz burger topped with 3 kinds of mushrooms and something that looked like spinach.  It was a really unique taste and it actually worked well for a burger.  I got a side of fries as well which was pretty huge in quantity but the taste wasn't all that great.  The fries were actually more like potato wedges than actual fries.  The price for this meal was around $14 or so with a drink, not too bad.

The negatives start kicking in when you consider the actual restaurant itself.  For starters, it's in an odd part of Toronto that I'm not too fond of (for example there's a strip club right across the street) and there's no free parking anywhere nearby, so parking fees are another expense that you have to add to your trip.  The interior of the restaurant itself needs some serious work.  It's pretty cool that they have car seats as the chairs for their booths/tables but overall the place has a bit of a dingy run down feel to it.  For some reason they also keep the door to the place open (lack of proper air conditioning maybe?) and while my friends and I were eating a bird flew in and scared some of the customers.  Luckily the service was pretty quick and the staff was pretty friendly as well so that somewhat made up for the lack of a proper atmosphere.

Overall Dangerous Dan's is pretty solid on the food front but needs to work on the presentation.  Go here if you don't care about location or decor and just care about getting a good burger."}
{"text":"Saw a TV show last week about the best burgers in Toronto and Dangerous Dan's was one of them. Dangerous Dan's won.

We plan on trying the top three.

Drove from Etobicoke to Queen and Broadview and eventually found a parking spot. $1.50 per hour. That was the best part of our trip.

Not sure what to order so I opted for a bacon and cheddar burger with Onion rings. Not too many toppings to choose so I got the mustard, relish, onions and hot peppers. You order at the counter and then sit down.

My wife had the rib sandwich and fries.

We sat in a booth and they brought us our meal.

Burger was average flavour but could use some spice to kick it up a notch.The onion rings were standard frozen fare. Tasted the batter more than the rings.

The rib sandwich was tasty and she would order it again if given the opportunity. The fries were just OK. I personally do not like the fat fries as they are too potatoey (is that a word?)

The milk shake was thick and very good, but they give you a skinny straw that makes you suck in your eyeballs. Makes more sense to give you a milkshake straw!

Would we go back? No, so off to the next one!

$30.00 for our meal!"}
{"text":"one time while walking by I heard

\"he didn't tip you? you should go back there and beat the shit out of him\"

that pretty much sums up the personality of this place, very easy going and very \"if you don't like it, leave\". 

I ate here a few times, Big kahuna burger every time. Don't expect any manners with your meal (I'm not complaining, that's how they are) but it should be a tasty massive greasy burger, that's what dangerous dans does and they don't try to hide anything, you have to respect that.

They aren't really my thing but wow, they make some crazy shit here."}
{"text":"An interesting idea / name, but one that stops at the door. Inside is greasy & dirty, Cheap plywood seats, car seats not bolted down that you can fall off of. Glaring compact fluorescent lamps. Worst burger I have ever had. Bland flavourless mash of long frozen beef. Cardboard would taste better. We ordered their special burger, on food arrival Waiter asked who is having the XX. Neither of us had ordered etc.. We said we had order the YY special on the board, it doesn't seem to be called that. Oh, was the response I'll guess we'll have to fix that. Best thing they could do is close & lock the doors, & start over again. We will never go back, and you should never go here either. Forget this spot. There are a lot better places to choose from in Toronto"}
{"text":"Good RAW and honest food and service. Tried one of the burgers and the beef ribs dinner. Taste and portion are great. No fancy decoration. No non-sense. To bad its closing this month."}
{"text":"Dangerous Dan's is a decidedly casual, no-frills, no-nonsense burger joint. The decor doesn't exist. The drinks don't come with a coaster or napkin wrapped around the can. The staff aren't brimming with over layered swaths of fake sentimentality, and there isn't a wall of brand new 50\" LED's to watch the game on. But there is one thing that DD's may share with the aforementioned martini lounges I've just been pantomiming, and it's that the staff DO all wear matching black uniform shirts: They're t-shirts, and they all say Dangerous Dan's on the front. Now you know where you are.

This is not a new place by any means, so I won't say it's following along the lines of the attempt some years ago to create a new restaurant type of food with 'tude. But the attitude does come free on the side with your burger order (albeit in a tongue in cheek manner). It's part of your dining experience at DD's as they like to call themselves (the menu also states \"the burgers are bigger at the DD. Very clever), and it's part of what makes the experience here so much fun. 

As soon as you walk through the doors you are greeted boisterously by the head cashier/owner (I assume) and informed that the bright yellow menus are in a holder at the front so that when you are ready, your order can be placed through them.

The menu continues with the burger humor giving suggestions for items that may be favorites for recreational cannabis users (there is a asterisk that leads to a qualifier that this is meant for humorous purposes only just in case any hard cases find that a bit too cutting edge), and the burgers are titled playfully as well with names such as The Big Kevorkian, The Big Kahuna and The Big Pig gracing the menu pages, just to name a few. In the land of Dangerous Dan's burgers, size DOES matter, and none of the customers have a problem with that. They're huge, flavor packed burgers that are as delicious as they are ostentatious. The fries are also noteworthy, as they are one of the rare establishments that still serves steak cut fries. Perfectly cooked to a golden brown color, it's worth adding to your meal even if the burger is enough to feed a small family and you don't need them. When eaton here, 'need' is automatically prequalified to most of what's on the menu.

Drink selection is also good. Soda's, flavored drinks like Iced Tea and of course Beer is also available. But no martinis. And that's just fine!

GO. NOW!"}
{"text":"Got the bacon and cheese burger. Was it the best burger I've ever had? Sadly, no, but it was good. What I wasn't crazy about was the bun - just a typical, run-of-the-mill white bun. A nice whole grain one, toasted, would improve the burger as those sugary white ones get soggy real fast. I ordered onion rings instead of fries as I read a few reviews slagging off the fries and they were a big disappointment. Could have been crisper and some flavor also would have been nice. They were so bland that I didn't finish them and for me, that speaks volumes. 

It was a bit of a let down as I've wanted to try their burgers for ages. The quest for that perfect burger continues on."}
{"text":"Outstanding burgers. I'm sure the 38 people before me have said all there is to know. We had the Kevorkian and the Big Pig. Truly brilliant. Perfect. Live the kitschy decor. The bucket seats with seatbelts were a treat. Two downsides - no Coke and the bathroom is pretty gross. Other than that if you like char roasted burgers, go! Now."}
{"text":"This place is all about the experience of getting a super big burger with all these different options in this no-frills joint. They have gotten rave reviews on tv and I do not know why. Seriously the burgers are not tasty at all and the bread wasn't soft. I would have been more satisfied eating at Harvey's! Like I said, go there for the DD experience of sitting on old car seats, getting burgers from tatted up owners/workers and looking over their menu of crazy burgers (like PB n banana burger or 24oz cornary burger) - but don't expect much in terms of taste!"}
{"text":"I wanted to love it so. But it was just \"Ok.\"

The atmosphere is eat, get out. The staff is direct, to the point (which works just fine. Gives you an immediate level of comfort, like being at mom's house for dinner). The ordering is easy: check out the yellow paper menu, tell the guy what you want, pay, then wait at a seat. 

I grabbed a cheese and bacon burger topped with fried egg (a popular choice as I heard many a diner order one while I was there) and a poutine, along with a Steam Whistle. It was about $20 + tip which was eventually approved on the circa-1998 debit machine. 

Got a window seat with a view of the busy intersection so I could people watch. My seat also provided a great view of daytime Jilly's and its hotel covered with photos of the \"talent\" (photos also circa-1999).

The burger was just another homemade burger. I mean, it was good and messy, the egg was a perfect compliment, as it always is. The bun was nothing exciting, not sure if there were other bun options. I wan't offered nor did I ask.

Thought the poutine would be better too. Frozen wedges says it all.

Overall, as you can tell from my tone, it was an ok experience."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this diner after a 5k run out to Leslieville to try out Descendants Pizza..only to find out they're not open for lunch on weekend! Booo-urns. 

Apparently, you're not allowed to block the entrance or ask for change or ask to use the washroom - the hand written signs say so! Curious to see what kind of food this had to offer so we tried the beef brisket sandwich special ($10.99 with fries and drink) and their bacon cheddar burger ($5.80?) 

This place is cheeeap. And in the good way! Humble, diner food at reasonable prices. The lady at the counter could have been more friendly, but she got my order quick and correct. Food took about 15 minutes to prepare for take-out.

The burger was huge and the patty was definitely homemade since it was crumbling out of my bun. You had to eat this burger with two hands. It could have used more seasoning and sauce but not bad for $5.00. 

The beef brisket sandwich was delicious. Melt in the mouth beef, smothered in homemade BBQ sauce. It was really good and to have a complete combo meal for only $10.99, I can dig it.

Pro-tip - they don't have mayonnaise. Sad burger :("}
{"text":"After hearing all the buzz about double D's, I finally made the trek east. 

We went around 4pm, so it wasn't busy at all. When you arrive, the lady behind the high counter shows us the paper menus and told us when we're ready, to go up to the front and order. 

We both order the Kevorkian burger and I got a small Strawberry milkshake. The total came to $13.10 + tip. 

It took a little longer than I thought, but when it arrived it looked good. Homemade, juicy and plump party with a huge bun holding it all together. 

With all the buzz of DD's being a greasy spoon diner, I was surprised the grease didn't roll down my hands while I bite into my burger. Overall, it was very a filling and satisfying burger! Props to DD.

So, If you don't mind the van bucket seats and old retro furnishing, it's definitely a  Toronto must!

Service is as it is, but it's nice. I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"This place was really good! Burgers are made monster big!!! They're closing late May so go soon!"}
{"text":"Worst food experience of my life! There was a massive chunk of plastic in my burger and I could have choked on it. It was literally the bunched top of clear plastic that someone in the kitchen had cut off to open something and it most likely fell into the burger patty meat and was forgotten."}
{"text":"I like the newer reviews from his friends to help bolster this guys ratings. You cant ignore the facts and saying he is better is like saying your abusive husband did not mean to beat you down. Simply put a bandage over the real problem.
Your opinion to reduce your standards since you seem to like abuse."}
{"text":"Can i just say I hate peanut butter in any type of food..except by itself. BUT my gosh..the Elvis milkshake is deliciousness in a cup! I tried to slurp up every drop in the cup! 

I ordered a plain burger which was yummy. I wish I had tried one of the fancier ones though. The fries...a bit on the big side, but nevertheless crispy and well 'friey'  I like this place..I like it a lot.  

The green P parking lot was full, so the guy in the restaurant let me park behind his restaurant near his car and actually had one of the guys at Dangerous dans deliver my order to my car. I think that was very nice of them."}
{"text":"I found this place a little on the spooky side to be quite honest, I did go late after a night of drinking but it had a really sureal feel to it when I entered.

First of all it is TINY just off broadview and Queen I believe across from good old Jilly's to set the tone for atmosphere, the parking is on the street or paid in a fairly dark and dingy lot located just behind the restaurant. Inside the seats are basically car seats I believe with tables and a clutter of postings, news clippings and random paraphenalia like a cow skull I believe I remember seeing adorning the walls and strewn about the place. The surroundings were all extremely dirty, prob the worst I have seen in a while with a sticky, film or residue to almost anything you touch then again most of the things you really don't need to touch and given the atmosphere of the place itself it is strangely acceptable.

The service I will say I found to be atrocious, I don't care if you've had \"bad\" experiences with customers in the past, regardless of the area your in which by the way you must have had some say in as you've opened a business there!!.. Regardless of all these things this is a customer service oriented industry and they need to consider that, being rude to every customer because some are cheap, bad or rude is ridiculous!!! Paying before you get your food is a little strange though I do realize why they do it, however what happens if your not satisfied with the food you get? Whatever, obviously this is geared to be more of a sit in fast food style restaurant but then you have to go up and order yourself... the only thing resembling a restaraunt is some miserable looking man will bring your order to you.

The food is the only thing that sets this place apart and i will agree with previous comments stating that the burgers are excellent but the sides can be iffy. The burgers here are one of a kind though... they offer things like; \"The Elvis\"  - Bacon, Peanut Butter and Fried Banana, \"The Big Kahuna\" - Pineapple Slice, Peameal Bacon, and Mozzarella.  Served with Mayonnaise, Lettuce and Tomato or how about the \"The Big Kevorkian\" - Fried onion, fried mushrooms, 2 slices fried bacon, deep fried pickle, garlic dressing and mayo! Crazy big portions as well give it a little more bang for your buck and I find the prices very competitive to begin with.

You'd think the venue and service would scare me away completely but the truth is once you  try the unique burgers you will likely be returning, just know what to expect when you get there and opt to Takeout ;)"}
{"text":"Everybody raves about the burgers at this place. I went on Tuesday Sept 8/15 for a lunch burger. I had the Big Cheese (love Blue Cheese) & it was good. I wouldn't say it blew me outta the water but it was good. I would have thought it would have been a bigger burger. I'd do it again in a pinch but I don't think it would be a destination burger."}
{"text":"Call me a princess, but Dangerous Dan's car seats make me feel really dirty... I know they're trying to go for a certain feel, but I just feel like I need to run home and take a shower.  The food was good, the portion was huge but it wasn't anything memorable... all I can think of was how dirty I felt sitting in this car seat pulled up awkwardly to a dining table.

I also ordered for delivery from Dangerous Dan's once and I hated it, the person who picked up the phone was really rude, I felt rushed and he didn't even bother to confirm the order.  I ordered 2 entrees and they completely missed one... and then added a pop to the order and charged me for it.  My coworker paid for it because I was busy so I didn't notice until after the delivery person left.

When I called them back, they refused to apologize or offer anything to rectify the situation.  They told me that was what I ordered, period, end of discussion.  I will never order delivery from them ever again.

2 stars, because I'm lenient and their food isn't bad.  I might give them a chance again if I was in the area - I'd do take-out though."}
{"text":"This place was on You Gotta Eat Here, and that's what put it on the map for me. The car seat decor was interesting, but I can't say I was a fan. The menu has a great selection of interesting burgers, and the burgers are HUGE. It's not on par with The Burger's Priest in terms of overall quality... but it was still a good burger, at a fair price. I don't regret going here, though I'm not sure if I'd be back as it's not my hood and there are so many other burger joints. But I recommend checking it out once."}
{"text":"These burgers aren't worth the attitude. Your schtick may beguile Guy Fieri, but surliness is pretty passé in 2014. There are chains who thrive off harassing customers with your eye rolling and dismissive order taking. Your actions are worth every personal attack in person and on here. You'll likely print this review out and post it in your business. It's not funny. It's schlock horror. You're attempting to be Roger Corman but turns out you're a freshman kid, film school hack who wants attention. 

\"May I have the cheddar burger please?\"

\"Want condiments?\" 

\"No, none please. Lettuce, tomato and onion only.\" 

\"So you *do* want condiments.\" 

\"Those aren't condiments.\" 

Eyes roll. 

\"Just give me everything but mayo and mustard.\" 

Look, if you're going to be an asshole, get your facts straight. Condiments are sauces or salt, pepper or anything ground. Others like lettuce, tomato and onions are toppings. 

Also, have the best burger I've ever had. It's not. Also, it's one thing to condescend and patronize customers like teenagers but when I see you treat your employees like trash, that's next level egregious ways. 

I'm giving you three stars based on the decency of the burger alone. And the delivery. We enjoyed the meal because we love breaking bread and burgers together no matter the situation. You leave a bad taste with me despite a decent burger, location, vibe and impressive employees working the burger grill. 

It's an unfortunate series of events that have lead you to believe that your negative energy is worth it all, but the price you pay of not being positive is strong as there are a fistful of burgers elsewhere that I recommend."}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't reviewed this place yet! Great place for burgers. I went here last summer after going to the CNE. Great choice of burgers. The \"Elvis\" shake is sooo good! There were four of us, we all enjoyed our burgers, you can see them in the pictures I posted!  Very casual, I love it. Not a lot of seating, but there wasn't really anyone there when we got there, so it was fine - we got a seat. I will definitely be going back here."}
{"text":"Ok. First of all. It's Dangerous Dan's...the place where ALL CANADIANS who want to be healthy digress. The place is nasty, the ambiance is gross (car seats and murky aroma), and the place can only hold so much people. 

So why the four stars? Why not give it a 3? Why not give it a 2? Heck, why not GIVE IT A 1? Because THEY SERVE THE EFFING QUAD C YOU WHORES!!!

Sadly, I made a pilgrimage here because me and my cousin were so tired of things to eat and we wanted to venture to something \"beyond\" (i guess) that was around oh so happy T-O. Low n Behold, he found this place. He also gave proof of videos plus articles to what this place serves. I had to come. A Burger that you can't even BITE INTO? Cmon, You've gotta take a stab at that!

It was a cold Wednesday I believe, and we took out our 30 or so dollars to purchase the QUAD C combo. Lets just get to the point...

The burger, is a gi-normus meatball with eggs (2 of them), bacon (1/2lb), Cheese (1/2lb), and other fixins. I might get my measurements wrong because this beast gave me the biggest food coma ever...

I just like to say that I tried it. I'm a fan yes. But I don't know if I'll ever see myself coming back here again. I just can't whip out that much money on something that I can't even finish.

So this place ain't no http://www.heartattackgrill.com/ that is found in Arizona. It probably mirrors it in some way, but I wouldn't know. The stuff that heart attack grill serves is just as bad as D D's. 

Anyways. If you ever order the burger, EAT it ASAP. That's when it tastes the best. It's something you GOTTA TRY even though its a F*****kin burger."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Found it by accident one evening while looking for a place to get some grub before a show at the Sound Academy. Went back again a couple months later before a show at The Koolhaus.

This is a true hole-in-the-wall, the food is unhealthy, but very tasty.  I had the chicken sandwich with BBQ sauce both times and a chocolate shake.  The chicken is pieces of meat rather than one whole breast; which makes it messy when you add the BBQ, but the smaller pieces allow it to have more flavor because of how much more surface area touching the grill.  The milkshakes are nice and thick, made with real ice cream, delicious.  I've had the fries, which are nice, thick steak fries, and the onion rings, which taste great.

I will not get a burger, but that is only because I do not like my burgers cooked anymore than medium, and in Canada you have to get it medium-well or well.  My friend did get a burger though, and he said it was great.  He has had the Elvis milk shake (choc, peanut butter, banana) and says it is awesome.

The staff was friendly both times I've been there, no issues. I read someones complaint about the staff, but I've not come across that at Dan's. 

The decor is hole-in-the-wall, it looks like the kind of place you get a greasy, unhealthy meal.  But even with the decor, I don't feel it is dirty at all. Love the use of old bucket seats from cars and the cool condiment holders.

If you're hanging out in TO and want to have a nice, greasy meal, this is a great place to go.  I will be back again for sure."}
{"text":"We opted to try Dangerous Dan's as Burger Priest was closed on Sunday and we needed to satisfy our burger fix.  The customer service at this joint is non existent.  Not sure if their intent is to make their customers feel like crap but they definitely don't put any effort into welcoming you to come back.  Aside from the service, the food was good.  Not amazing but much better than any fast food joint.  The patties are thick and juicy and for the price you definitely get your money's worth.  I got the big cheese with bacon... I couldnt finish it all but I didnt want to get yelled at by the staff for asking for a to go container so I just left it at that (we were asked if we were blind when we asked where the stools were - who knew that was such a sensitive question to ask? haha).
I wont be going back again but I'm glad I got the experience out of the way.  Would suggest people to go to try the food but be prepared for the service...."}
{"text":"Dangerous Dan's is one of those Toronto institutions that you just need to go to at least once to say that you've eaten there. It's on a part of Queen Street that hasn't quite been gentrified yet but, honestly, that's essential for your Dangerous Dan's experience. If I had to pick one word to describe \"The Double D\" it would have to be \"grimy\" but I honestly mean that in the most endearing way possible. The outside of the diner is weather-beaten and portions of the signage are almost unreadable. Inside, all of the seats are old van bench seats and captain's chairs, which I'd like to think are from the former daily drivers of the owner and staff, covered in slightly cleaner fabric. To dust off an old Rodney Dangerfield chestnut, the gimmick at Dangerous Dan's can be summed up as \"the food ain't great but the portions are terrific!\" The menu boasts hamburgers of increasingly obscene size with names like \"The Elvis\" (a burger with peanut butter, fried banana, and bacon) and \"The Collosal Colon Clogger\" (the ultimate in gluttony boasting a quarter pound of cheese, a quarter pound of bacon, and two fried eggs on a 24 oz patty). The first time I ate here I played it safe and ordered one of the more modestly-sized hamburgers. It was a thick patty on a fresh bun with intentionally thickly cut toppings. I'm not exaggerating when I say that I had half of a tomato on my burger. While the quantity of food was more than ample and reasonably priced, the hamburger itself was bland. I tasted no seasoning at all and was essentially eating a big pile of ground beef. The next time I went I had their chicken fingers on the advice of a friend. Despite their reputation for their burgers I have to say that their chicken fingers are a far superior meal. I couldn't tell if these had been made on site or cooked from frozen but they tasted fresh and were of non-uniform enough shape that I'd believe they were made to order. As I stated earlier, Dangerous Dan's is just one of those places you have to go to at least once. Between the food, the ambience, and the gruff demeanor of the staff it's a truly unique experience."}
{"text":"So I finally got a chance to check out this place. I guess from the overall flavour standpoint I was a little disappointed, but they deliverered in portion size. I don't know if I'll ever find myself there again but it was experience, that I don't regret."}
{"text":"If you've got a hangover and need greasy \"goodness\", then head over to the Double D's.  Also, if you're blunted, you will be comforted and guided by the recommendations on the menu indicated with a weed leaf (yes intended for humour only, but seriously, are we really kidding?)  The Tree Hugger with bacon and cheddar is my go to, but sometimes I feel compelled to order the Elvis.  And the onion rings are pretty good if you feel like splurging.

I always feel a little creepy after sitting in the seats there.  Couple that with a view of Jilly's and the New Broadview Hotel and the temptation to jump into a vat of Purell is overwhelming.  But somehow this is all part of the raw charm of the place.  I like the in-your-faceness captured perfectly by the posters displayed in their window, for example \"22% of Ontarians are obese.  We can do better.\"  The employees are always civil from what I've observed and if they do give attitude, one can easily forgive them considering what they have to deal with at that corner... no disrespect to Queen and Broadview; it's my hood.

Dangerous Dan's, in my humble opinion, is a rite of passage.  In a sea of gentrification, I do hope that it remains.  I cannot say the same about Jilly's, mind you ;  )"}
{"text":"Probably the most honest place in the city. They don't treat you very well and they serve you heart clogging, belly bursting food and don't deny this fact. In fact, they seem to relish in it. Place is run down and the food is not healthy for you, but it damn sure tastes good.  Love the burgers here."}
{"text":"Was a fun experience to try Dangerous Dan's. Their seats were those from an old van and the set up was simple. I had the big cheese after a long day of sailing with the boys. The burger was very greasy (in a good way)  but there isn't much flavour to it.  Would come back once every other year just for kicks. And on a cheat day."}
{"text":"Cheers to double Ds. 3.5 kind of spot. 

Service with a smile (or sarcasm depending on the time of/or day) and delivery in the area earns them the extra half star.

The sandwiches are massive and I don't know about you but I'll eat a fried egg on a burger any day. They also have halfway decent poutines, and a perogie poutine for those of you who wish to experiment. 

But sometimes the egg is overcooked and they don't exercise patience in taking your order. Add the no waiter service and dingy diner doldrums and I just can't quite give this place a fan stamp.

I RECOMMEND: the Coronary Burger special. Don't ask, just do.

EXTRA TIP: Order to go. Like I said, the diner itself is nothing to write home about. Nothing is appetizing with the view of a dilapidated strip club across the street."}
{"text":"Dangerous Dan's Diner for sure is an eating place out of my comfort zone.... Not only it serving meatlover's delight, it is in an area that I seldom frequent.

My friend kept eyeing Jilly's (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/jillys-toronto#query:adult%20dancing) across the street while waiting for our Quad C to arrive. Yes I read her mind - \"It is really what you think it is... you want me to set up an exotic crawl next week??\" (maybe more yelpers will come.....)

The Quad C is really a novelty item, good photo op but the meat is so dry and tasteless. It is a challenge to cook that thick a patty to make sure it is safe for consumption so we won't be all waiting in the ER at the end of our food crawl.

Been there! Done it! Took a Photo of that! Case Closed.

Back to my juicy, charcoal marked, human sizes burger.

Oh I hate the poutine, the gravy is so salty... and I barely can taste the potatoes... note: I do love french fries/sweet potato fries."}
{"text":"You feel like you are at a high school buddy's place. The food is greasy, big, and no holds barred. The price is right, the humor is welcoming, and you won't feel bad being there inebriated or hung over.. jusr check out the menu and you will kniw what I mean.

I had the Kevorkian burger, it was fantastic, but I think the bun could have used some work--be it toasted, a pretzel bun, or have options on the bun. 

I give it a 4/5: delicious, comfortable, little room for improvement. If it's ok with my heart and calorie levels, will visit again!"}
{"text":"They do a good burger at a reasonable price. Kitschy decor. Nice staff, even if they are a little gruff."}
{"text":"It's kitschy, and ridiculous, and the kind of place that you can imagine would be featured on a Food Network special (theme: places that use car seats for indoor seating?  Restos with amusingly gruff customer service?  Joints where the vast majority of things touch the fryer?  Spots honouring the noble cheese curd?).  Definitely worth a visit, but my time at Dangerous Dan's hasn't motivated me to seek out 'regular' status yet.

What Dangerous Dan's is famous for is their burgers.  They are massive, and very affordably priced, and walking up to order at the counter I always feel this false sense of bravado: like I *should* be ordering the Collosal Colon Clogger Combo (affectionately named the Quadruple C).  Instead, here's what I have had:

Veggie burger with peameal bacon 
Poutine (with extra cheese curds)
The Big Kevorkian burger, which comes complete with a deep fried pickle
and
Fried Mars bars

Heading home after happy hour?  This is a great bet for sopping up some of the stuff heading t'wards your liver.  The burger patties themselves aren't that memorable, but the whole quirky experience of excess (at a good price) makes Dangerous Dan's a place to visit.

Yelp note: DDD also does delivery around the immediate Queen/Broadview neighbourhood."}
{"text":"I was enjoying an evening at Rasputin when my friend said they were going to head to Dangerous Dan's for a burger and come back. I was super excited because I had been drinking and wanted something greasy to soak up some of the Vodka.. When we arrived there is was close to 11:30pm - Saturday night. I went up to order a Gyros and the man behind the counter said they were out of pita's so I then decided on a Burger with Mozzarella and Bacon.. The Burger by far was home style for sure..  very thick patty and lovely tasting..

The atmosphere was was very interesting, all the seats were old care seats, and the place was tiny.

The staff  man that served me seem irritable... I actually over heard him say \"We better close the doors on time cause I wanna get the F*** outta here.\" I don't really think that kinda of attitude should be displayed to customers made me feel like our group was a burden to walk in and order.

All in all a good late night place but wouldn't go out of my way to eat there.."}
{"text":"Classic burger joint in Toronto, Dangerous Dan's made a name for themselves thanks to their signature huge patty. My ex-wife was a firm believer of the saying \"the bigger the better\", guess she never had a burger at Dangerous Dan's."}
{"text":"This was one of my stops in search of the best burger in Toronto.  How this place ranked Top 10 on some lists is beyond me.  Overcooked, overdressed meat sloppily assembled - very disappointing.  For those that have seen \"Demolition Man\", eating at Dangerous Dan's reminded me of the scene where John Spartan, desperately deprived of meat, buys a rat burger in the underground world - the ambience is about the same and I can only assume that rat tastes like a Dangerous Dan burger patty.    

Dangerous Dan's does offer a variety of different types of burgers but I'm a simple man when its comes to how I like my burgers.  Just some fatty ground beef with a little salt and pepper with cheese is really all I need.  Some mushrooms and onions would be nice, but I don't think I would ever feel the need to toss a fried egg or banana on it.       

Este carne es de rata."}
{"text":"Triple D. Those are some big ass burgers. 

The man who greets you often upon entering is surly, sometimes rude, and sometimes audibly a dick to his staff. I presume this is Dan. A note to Dan: Most of the time I like your style and find you funny. Your bitchy signs are amusing, but rolling your eyes when customers are confused isn't cool. I've been here many times so I know the drill, but not everyone does, and don't you want them to return/say nice things about you? Even an institution like yours isn't immune to what a negative reputation can do to it in ever-changing Riverdale/Leslieville.  

The drill: Enter, order at the counter and pay up front, then go take a seat in one of the car-seat booths and wait for your order to be brought to you.

Some people find the car seats dingy, I disagree. It's some seriously cozy eating. 

The glorious diner food is the tops. If grading on food alone I'd give this joint five stars. It does what it does ruhl well. Cheese burgers piled high and greasy. Poutine on thick cut fries. Greek meat options. Perogies deep fried or poutine style. Want an egg on any of this? No. Problem. 

PEPPER POINTS: They deliver in the east end."}
{"text":"What can you say about Dangerous Dan's....

Situated across the street from Jilly's, the location is a little less desirable and the exterior looks a little shady. The food makes up for what the location lacks. The staff behind the counter are always friendly and they serve up burger's for everyone - from the humongous 24oz Homeburger (also served with chunky fries) to a regular 8oz burger or Tree Hugger Veggie burger topped to your liking. You are sure to find something that will please you."}
{"text":"some serious attitude is in this place, in not only the staff but in the food! 

I've been coming to this neighborhood for about 5-6 years and I'm very sad to say that I didn't make an effort to try this place until I heard it was closing, so I made my way down on my previous days off. right off the bat I was taken back by the smells and the sights of this diner, chalkboard was hanging from the ceiling with cute and funny notes all through the upper half of the restaurant *very weird description* saying anything and everything that just strikes the funny bone, also a very notable sight to this establishment is the seating, the booths look to be hand made out of rare materials and opposite to that is tables with car/van seats fastened to frames/blocks. almost as soon I walked in I was greater by one of the line chefs asking me if I had ever been there before, to which I had replied that no, I have no, I was promptly handed a menu and was graciously told, if I made a decision or had a question to let her know. I had a bit of a chuckle reading the menu as it was littered with printed pot leafs, next to menu items. I believe the description was, \"highly enjoyed by stoners\" beef pretty much dominates the menu, which I accidently ordered and paid for next day(food allergy) I didn't ask so I chalk that to completely my fault. the service was quick, prompt and friendly which was really good, even though I was trying to keep dry from the rain. two things that was really impressive once the food hit the table was the smell (fresh and delicious) and how hot the food was (poutine had a mountain of steam coming off of it.  I cannot stress this enough, for a diner that's closing, the food was absolutely delicious, from the burger standpoint they really nailed all of the toppings and marriage of sauces on the burger. the poutine was decent, I say decent because I feel like the burger stole the show for me. im very much attached to this diner, and sad to say the end is coming, I'm hoping before the end I can come back once or twice as this place rocks so much. 
if you have a chance before the end, come out and have some delicious food!

transit options are the 501 queen, 502 Kingston road, 503 downtowner, and 504 king. parking is a private lot that is just north of the restaurant"}
{"text":"Came here after an event at the Opera House last weekend. Some friends from my program raved about it and once I was in the area I realized where it was and we decided to give it a try for dinner.

Being the plain Jane that I am I just got the plain burger with pickles, lettuce and ketchup lol! But it was fantastic and only $5! Excuse et moi?? :P My boyfriend got the cowboy burger I think it was called, it had beans in it and some other fun things :S you couldn't pay me enough to eat something like that but he enjoyed it! We shared a poutine which was great, the fries were wedges and it was well put together.

They also served beer which I was happy about, I don't drink it but my boyfriend wanted a few and we were celebrating something for him that night so it was a nice addition. All that for $28 bucks! Cheap date eh? Can't go wrong.

The guys who worked there were nice and meant business. They were very strict about people not sitting down until they've ordered and paid which is a pretty good system I must say.

Our table was cool too, the seats were from a car! Definitely something different and I appreciated that.

I would definitely come back if I were back in the area and craving a good, affordable burger."}
