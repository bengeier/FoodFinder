{"text":"Ordered from this place tonight and the food is pretty good. If you are used to good Chinese food (not from Calgary) this place will surprise you. I really recommend ordering at this restaurant. I had the sweet & sour pork, chicken fried rice, and ginger chicken."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for 5+ years and I keep on loving it! They have the best sweet and sound pork and shrimp fried rice !! I can't go a month without coming here and the service it is the best , they are friendly and it's just overall a good place to get good food !"}
{"text":"Great quality, well priced, fast and friendly delivery.  Doesn't leave you feeling hungry an hour after eating like some Chinese food can.  Not greasy or bland, really tasty!"}
{"text":"We were visiting from out of town & we were badly craving canadian chinese food & boy this place did NOT disappoint!  It was awesome!!"}
{"text":"Okay I have been getting Chinese from here since I was 5-6 currently 26 so 20 years of experience. There Chinese food is amazing always hot always really tasty. It's all take out but the boxes are always stuffed full so value is great. I always get the wonton soup and the broth hits me right in the flavour feels. 
Pros
-lots of food for value
-taste amazing 
-girl on the phone/counter always sooooo nice and has worked there as long I have eaten there! 
Cons
-busy at meal times (cos sew gud)
-Americanize Chinese like take out style it's not bad but don't expect super authentic Chinese

So to sum it up order food from here you'll laugh you'll cry you'll fall in love"}
{"text":"Fast service, great food, affordable priced!! :) even their delivery is fast. They're usually really full on a Friday night but they still try their best."}
