{"text":"Had the best shwarma I had ever had at this new eatery last night. Right from the freshly made pita to their delicately and perfectly spiced sauces, the veges and succulent grilled chicken - it truly was delicious! My husband had the chicken kabab and it too was delicious with its assortment of sides like the hummus, veges and lentils and rice. Highly recommend this restaurant! The owner made us taste the baba ganoush on a pita and it was heavenly too. AMAZING cuisine!"}
{"text":"I tried this location when it first opened. The shawarma was pretty good, but kept falling apart the way it was filled. The dips are good, but not the sandwiches. There are no traditional fillings to add to the sandwiches. I don't know which owner the other posters met, but the one I met was rude with an attitude problem. I have been there 3x, but will never go back. There is a MUCH better Shawarma place at Markham Rd & 14th avenue. They make everything homemade & fresh."}
{"text":"We noticed this restaurant when we stopped in at Wild Wing a few days ago, but it was closed. We decided to go back today and we are thrilled that we did! It is clear that the the owner Jean loves what he does; his eyes just light up when you start talking about food and flavours. First thing Jean offered us some hummus on a pita, it was AMAZING; smooth and full of garlic. My husband and I both had the kofte sandwich which was stuffed full of delicious goodness and was very healthy. Jean told us all about how everything is fresh and a lot of their ingredients are imported from Lebanon. The place is very clean but small so it is more a take-out place than a sit-down restaurant. They also sell packaged lahmajun, spinach and feta pastries and walnut or pistachio filled cookies.  It is great that we now have a restaurant offering this type of cuisine in the area. We will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"As we driving back from groceries, I noticed this new sign above a small storefront in the strip plaza. It caught my eye as it said mediterrean food where most restaurants in Markham are chinese or fastfood. I popped inside and was pleasantly surprised with a gourmet smell of baked goods. So it turns out the place is half bakery and half takeout restaurant.  As the other reviewer mentioned, there are 2 tables that seat 6 each but we ended ordering the take-out.

Decor: Very modern and clean interior. Nice menu board and a set of wooden shelves carrying various baked goods.

Service: The owner is super friendly! We placed a very last minute order e.g they close at 8PM and we called in at 7:25 to order food. But the food still made fresh in 20  mins.

Food: So we ordered some of the combo dinners with several sides for 4 people. All dinners come with rice+lentils, salad, hummus and pickles.

Kofta kabob dinner - this was my favourite. Flavourful and juicy meat kabobs! Definitely will order again.

Chicken kabob dinner  - same as above - great taste

Chicken shwarma dinner - Often I find alot of shwarma places I find that the sliced chicken becomes dry and tough to chew. But not in this case - the chunks of chicken was soft and tender.

Tabbouleh - loved this as a side dish!

Kibbeh - small ground beef balls with cracked wheat. it goes great with the hot sauce! Crunchy the outside and juicy inside!

Falaffel - this was also our group favourite where it was freshly baked with a crunchy exterior and soft interior.There was a nice combo of parlsey and spices inside.

Hummus - again a group favourite. It had a very nutty flavour and creamy consistency.

Extras: As I mentioned, the owner was super nice to us and threw in a free large greek salad and 1/2 dozen olive+feta pies. I will definitely return to try the beef kabobs."}
