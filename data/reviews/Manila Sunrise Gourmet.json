{"text":"Disappointed with this restaurant. If you are hungry I suggest don't go to this place as it takes long time to serve  the food .  Poor service . We're waiting for our food for so long. Nice place and good food for Filipino stomach .  Reminder:  Make sure you come to this place before you hungry because you gonna die before your food arrive in your table"}
{"text":"I have eaten hear before and it was ok but I won't be coming back. Today in the paper under Restaurant Inspections they received 7 critical violations!! I wouldn't  be surprised if we end up seeing them on TV's Dirty Diner. UGH!!"}
{"text":"Authentic Filipino food!  Very flavorful and they have some of the best suman and flan I have ever had in my life!!"}
{"text":"I hate to give a 1 star but I had to. I'm Filipino and was really looking forward to trying this place out and was even rooting for their success but all they left me with is a bad 1st impression and an empty belly. I got there at 5:00 and they closed that day at 7:00, I tried ordering 3 different things and they were out of everything. Then the lady tried pawning off their BBQ for chicken adobo like as if I didn't know the difference. I guess they wanted me to pick from the 3 selections they had under the hot lamp that looked as if it had been there since noon. Ended up driving 30 min to Glendale and went to \"halo-halo\" which was pretty good! I will not be returning to manilla sunrise and will make the extra trip farther to halo halo. Consider yourself warned and you can't believe everything you read in the new times."}
{"text":"The  place  that  I can  order  2 item  and  rice  at  6.59 like  this  traditional Filipino food"}
{"text":"They have really good Filipino food.  Like most Filipino restaurants, it's all about the food.  Don't expect any scenery.  I come here for a desert called \"halo halo\".  Order one, mix it up, and enjoy it on a hot summer day."}
{"text":"My wife and I used to come here all the time because it's close to our house but we stopped coming here because their food is just way too inconsistent.  Also they let a lot of the food sit underneath a heat lamp all day.  I would usually order the diniguan or the lechon kawali.  Sometimes it was amazing and sometimes i would have nothing but a plate of fat with very little meat.  My wife is from the philippines (just moved to America last year) and she also was disappointed with the food more often than not.    Also, we never really felt welcomed there.  A lot of other people said in their reviews that they treated them like family.  That was never the case for us.  We would go there pretty often, like once a week, and nobody there would even greet us or even act like they were happy to see us."}
{"text":"I love their pinakbet (veggies sauteed in garlic and salted shrimp paste) and their pork BBQ (the meat is marinated in soy and garlic, skewered, then grilled). Sinigang (meat and veggies simmered in savory sour broth) and dinuguan (a sanguine pork stew) are normally not my first choices when offered a variety of Filipino dishes, but in this restaurant their preparations of those dishes have made them among my favorites. If cholesterol is not a concern of yours and you want a dynamite taste treat, get their crispy dinuguan - it's dinuguan mixed with lechon kawali (deep fried pork belly); totally awesome! A lot of us yelpers have been wishing that we could give ratings in half-star increments; if this were the case I would have given Manila Sunrise Gourmet 4 and 1/2 stars, as the very basic no-frills setting would not normally be characteristic of a 5-star etablishment. Since full stars are our only option, I'm going to round my rating UP to 5 stars because the food is so good and the prices so easy on the wallet!"}
{"text":"Food was good only issue is that I ordered takeout and forgot half my order. Ordered kawali and Bbq sticks and they forgot to give my friend the Bbq sticks.  They fixed the issue and gave me my order and serve a really good crispy pata. Brought memories back when I was a child."}
{"text":"The only reason they are getting a one star review is due to be disgustingly old cold and mostly gone looking food in the steam trays that had absolutely no steam coming out from underneath 90 percent of the food was gone I asked for for standard Filipino dishes of which they could deliver none the place does not look clean and I was looked at funny because I look more white than Filipino I highly suggest avoiding this place I will never be back I went out of my way to come here when I should have just gone to jeepney bistro or holy grill"}
{"text":"Unfortunately I have to give it a rating....  I don't really want to!!  Went there this afternoon hoping to grab some dinner and walked out with nothing. When I walked in there were only 2 tables being used with a total of 8 people, meaning they weren't that busy. The lady and the gentleman behind the counter saw me walk up to the counter and didn't bother to acknowledge me. I stood there for 5 minutes and nothing...  I come from the hospitality industry and this is one of the worse experiences I've had. Besides unfriendly staff, it's dirty looking and the food looked like it was sitting under the heating lamp the entire day in a pool of oil. Good thing I wasn't the Health Department!   Too bad the good pinoy restaurants are too far. I will never come back to this place. I would rather drive to Meckong Market and get some bbq from Wholly Grill. There even if the service is abit slow... The staff is great and friendly!!! Food is great too!!!"}
{"text":"Good little place for lunch.  Went there with three friends after seeing their sign on the sidewalk.  Most of the food was excellent.  The pork belly was good - some sort of BBQ riblet thing was even better.  The heatlamp food mentioned by another reviewer though was subpar and I'd stay away from it except for the riblet deals which seem to only get tastier under there.  Topped lunch off w/some halo halo for desert that was just fantastic.  If you've never tried it - it's a sort of ice cream plus condensed milk and ice and other goodness.  Wonderful stuff, looking forward to going back....just need to translate the menu first."}
{"text":"3 of us all ordered different items on the menu.  They were all terrible.  I think the only way this place is able to stay in business is that it is a front for something not quite legal in this state......"}
{"text":"Great food. Slooooow service though. I understand it's a mom and pop resto and theyre still nice so i don't mind anymore. The cooking time can be improved. Anyway breakfast is bomb here. With all the silogs u can choose from. And with 2 eggs and rice and good size of meat serving, 5 bucks is totes worth it. They even have c2. Man i haven' had that in ages. Last time I had it was when I was in Cali. Anyway some minor things here that can totally be improved but all in all yp 4 stars for me."}
{"text":"very tasty food and very affordable to say the least, on some nights you can get up and sing karaoke! what a fun place"}
{"text":"This is a gem of a find and I didn't even find it on yelp!  I was with my daughter picking up my grandson from his new Children's Center so I could see it, with a quick stop at the GoodWill next door in the same strip mall and we were leaving the parking lot to go to the Teriyaki Kitchen across the street when I saw this little place occupying the corner location as we were driving by,  I exclaimed \"There's another Filipino place!\". I had recently discovered Heavenly Bakery in Chandler on Yelp.  Over the next few days I tried researching it online for their hours of operation and info on what they carry and found the name \"Why Cook?\" associated with this address.  I tried calling the number three different times but got no answer the first time and fax screeching the next two.  Finally I asked my daughter yesterday if she would drive past it and call me with any info in their window.  She did and said they were open and read the phone number on the door which was different than the one I'd found online.  I called and was told they would be open till 7:30 or 8. I headed over as soon as I got ready.  The owners couldn't have been nicer, the aromas were delectable.  There were about six tables and the counter where you order.  There is a buffet selection with about 8 items to choose from at $4.50 for one including rice and $5.50 for two.  I was huuuungry and asked how much for three.  $1 more.  I chose some fried fish, a bowl of sinigang, and a vegetable mixture. Everything was served to me right away and it was all delicious.  The sinigang, one of my favorites since I first tasted it from the Lumpia House in Chandler back in 2007, was some of the best I'd ever had.  The fish was very crunchy and good.  I just picked it up with my fingers and chewed it off the bones.  There was about every kind of vegetable known to man in the veggie dish, green beans, okra, squash, carrots,  and several I couldn't identify.  When I went to pay I decided to splurge and get an order of Pancit, another favorite, to go for later or the next day.   It was closing time but the food was still coming out of the kitchen for late customers and it, too, smelled good.  Must. Come. Back.  Parking is no problem.  There is a huge lot.  And as of this writing, 11/16/12, their hours are 8am to 8pm seven days a week.  I asked and was told they had just opened up about a month ago.  They offer many more items besides the buffet choices including Lumpia, Pancit, and silog, which I understand is a breakfast type plate including fried rice with your choice of meat (beef, pork, chicken, fish) and a couple of sunny side up eggs, available all day.  Sounds good!"}
{"text":"It's okay but kinda pricey for a combo meal.  $30 for 4 no drinks.  Quality is mediocre and it's a Sunday lunch."}
{"text":"I accidentally found this little gem when I \"Yelped\" Filipino restaurants in the area.  I had recently visited \"Hey Joe! Filipino Street Food Truck\" & was craving more. To my surprise Manila Sunrise had just opened and in my area.  I went there with a Filipina friend and we both agreed the food reminded us of home! The sinigang was yummy as was the pancit palabok. On another visit, I had the diniguan which was easily 4 stars. I liked their food so much that I had them cater a New Years Day party for my American (aka- \"white\") in-laws....all 30+ of them! Needless to say they LOVED the food! Even the diniguan which I initially got for myself & my 2 sons...the Shanghai lumpia was crisp and not greasy as were the lumpia \"prito\" (veggie & meat egg rolls). I hear they have \"kari kari\" as a special on Saturdays....Yummm. This is now my new favorite \"gotta-go-to\" place."}
{"text":"The service and people were very nice. The restaurant didn't have AC so I was sweating as I was eating but some guy came in and I'm assuming they are fixing the AC.  The food, however was by far the WORST filipino food I've ever eaten. My boyfriend and I just came back from it and he (is filipino himself) said everything tasted like it was old and it didn't taste fresh whatsoever. He ordered the chicken tocino and I got the tap si log plate and in both dishes, the meats had a faint sour smell to it. Boyfriend said it could be the vinegar they put in but either way, I didn't like it. It was very unpleasant, I couldn't finish my food. The pancit was pretty good  but that's the only dish that tasted decent. I LOVE halo halo, so to wash down the terrible food, we ordered 1 halo halo. I was hoping the halo halo would be good but when we ordered it, I did not see any taro ice cream on top. I;m assuming that everyone makes halo halo differently. When I tried the halo halo, it was TERRIBLE. It tasted so watered down and not sweet whatsoever.  I would NOT recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"This place is pretty hit or miss. The past couple of months they have been good.  I went on monday 05/05/2014 and sadly the guy was looking for every piece of Chicken Adobo with bones... not one piece was all meat.  I got 3 huge bones and hardly any meat. I wouldnt complain but I actually watched him touch each piece to make sure it had a bone... sadly I will have to stop coming here as a result.  The food has been better than usual but just cuz im not Pinoy doesnt mean i shouldnt get chicken instead of bones..."}
{"text":"Depressing to only give ONE STAR, but it was terrible. I've been reading pretty good reviews about this place, so I took my parents for a quick bite to eat while running errands.   Manilla Sunrise Gourmet is tucked away in a shopping plaza in West Mesa. It's a small, but cute establishment. When we walked in it was a little crowded, so we were thinking the food must be good. After reviewing the menu we noticed they didn't have to much to choose from. The food under the hot lamp looked a little \"old.\" We ordered 4 different things; Picadillo (Giniling), BBQ Pork, Ribs and Shanghai Lumpia. All left us disappointed and still hungry!! =( The Giniling was oily and the ground beef tasted raw. As for the BBQ and Ribs, it seemed as if they just came straight from the grocery store freezer, no real flavor at all. Also the ribs seemed to have a coating of oil on them. I figured the Lumpia would be better. Who can really mess up lumpia, even if it was store bought?!! Well they managed to mess it up anyway and burned it. As for the rice, it was soggy. To top it off we happened to get some of the \"morning\" rice and new rice mixed together... Blahhhhh!!   I heard they have great dessert, Halo Halo and Turon but after my experience with the food we decided to just skip it. It seems there are NO GOOD FILIPINO places on this side of town!! I will continue to make the long journey to the west side to eat at Halo Halo!! (35th Ave and Dunlap) They are by far the best in AZ!!   As we were leaving we noticed all those people taking up the table and chairs, were either family or workers. Go figure!! LoL"}
{"text":"i was just expecting a filipino food fix...but this place really brought me home. authentic tastes and its not your usual cafeteria tasting dish. it is really tasty despite the grounded ambience of plastic spoon forks and plates. this must be the go to place for every filipino in az thats needing some manila glimpse. the moment you enter, you'll be treated like any other filipino. its awesome!  for awhile i really felt i was in the philippines."}
{"text":"Longanisa with vinegar dip, fried rice and egg is the bomb!"}
{"text":"I called for my brother to see if they had his favorite dish.  They said yes.  We traveled from Goodyear to Mesa.  Got there and they lie! Looked at the display of food they had and it looked like it had been sitting under the heat lamps for 3 days. I believe they offer buffet. So I was told.  I think regulars go here. I really dont think I will ever eat here.  So this is what led me to the Mekong Plaza. They may have good items here at Manila Sunrise. But I was turned off by the false information that was given over the phone.  For those of you that like this place sorry that I have to say these things but this was my experience.  Please enjoy what you like here. For those who have not been here give it a try. You may find something that brings you back."}
{"text":"It felt just like home. This is what Filipino tradition/culture is. Everyone treats you like you're a family. I called them Aunt (tita) or Uncle (tito) even though we're not related but as a sign of respect for the elders. Food is always great! This is my second time and my favorite is the Tapsilog, it comes with garlic fried rice, 2 sunny side up eggs, a slice of tomato and cucumber and then I dip it with spiced vinegar. Yummm!"}
{"text":"Manila Sunrise is no longer a restaurant and sells only grocery items now. It's small but carries a lot of Filipino goods such as sauces, snacks, mixes, and a tiny section of freezer/fridge items. We picked up some agar-agar, egg crackers, and spicy coconut vinegar. Check out was no problem. Be sure to check any bottled or canned goods for expiration dates. One coconut vinegar brand had expired last month but the brand I ended up buying was still good."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh, best Filipino Food in Arizona I've had so far! I've tried a number of Filipino restaurants from Mesa to Glendale and Manila Sunrise was hands down THE BEST. No offense Arizona but this is the first Filipino restaurant that was as good as California. First of all the service was amazing! I felt like the staff was my Tita's (auntie) house and she was taking care of us like we were her relatives. I didn't catch her name but she was so cute in her chef's hat and she was super sassy, I love it. The food, oh my god, the food was amazing. I have been craving Filipino food for a while now, so I decided to go all out for this particular lunch. I ordered us the crispy pata, which is a traditional dish that is basically the best ever invented. If you like lechon, which is the roasted pig, this is the way to go. It was cooked to perfection with the crispiest skin and most tender meat. This was the husband first time eating crispy pata and it had him (and me) tearing it apart for every last bit of meat. Since that took about 20 minutes to cook (so worth it) we decided to share a combo plate while we waited. We got the fish sinigang and kare kare- I must say both were extremely delicious, but I'd say the kare kare stood out over the sinigang. Sinigang is a tamarind based soup, so it's sour (in the best way) and kare kare is a special stew with a peanut based sauce that is to die for with some rice and bagaon (shrimp paste). Randomly, I ran into my brother and some of his friends here, so I expect to see some familiar Filipino faces everytime I come back. I can't wait! I love Manila Sunrise! Makes me feel like I'm home."}
{"text":"First place I tried for filipino food and fell in love. This place was quaint, staff was friendly and food was good. What else could you ask for? I got the longsilog and it was AWESOME. Just like back home, made me miss my mama :( lol.  You walk up to the counter tell em what you want, and there's your food. No waiting. You pay after you eat and are very satisfied. And they didn't charge me for an extra helping of rice, thank you very much. They take cash and card, tucked away though so you might miss it but totally worth it :)"}
