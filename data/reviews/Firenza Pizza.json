{"text":"Pizza was great, tasty crust. $7.99 to create to create your own.  Staff was friendly but a little slow."}
{"text":"I give 5 stars! Upon walkin in the staff was extremely friendly... my pizza was made fresh, efficiently, and quickly! On top of everything it is delicious! Thank you firenza, I enjoyed my experience!"}
{"text":"Incredibly slow. First and last time we come in. Had a horrible experience. They made our pizzas and then had to make again. We were there on Wednesday night, only one person in front of us, took at least 45 minutes before we left to eat at home."}
{"text":"The food is delicious!  I was in love with the pizza the first time my husband picked it up!  The next time we ordered, i had to pick up.  It was quite a disaster.  There are no signs indicating 'Pick Up' if you've placed an online order, so I wasn't sure to skip the long line or join it.  Then, once i got up to the register, there was no one attending!  The employees were all over the place, station to station.  The guy behind me ordered in store, and his food was ready before he even paid!  This place needs management big time."}
{"text":"First time visiting, had a wonderful experience. Restaurant was nice and clean. Excellent customer service, pizza and wings were amazing. Will visit again."}
{"text":"Went there the first time today.  Finally, a pizzeria at actually makes pizza that tastes like pizza in Charlotte.  Their 10\" Make your own is fresh, delicious, and just the right size.  Their spicy sauce is very good.  They offer fresh mozzarella! I would like to see them offer a cracker-thin crust version, but next time will ask they bake a little longer to see if that firms it up a little.  Staff is friendly, and the make while you wait ala Chipotle is a great take on  takeout."}
{"text":"Great service, very good pizza, quick easy and delicious. Many choices when creating your own pizza. Better than most pizza in north charlotte."}
{"text":"Great Pizza and the service was good too.  Newly Opened....  So many options for toppings, the workers were all over me asking if I needed anything"}
{"text":"I really wish there was a way to separate service from food. The food was great. But I gave it a one because the service is atrocious. The guy running the joint is a terrible human being. As I'm in line, I watched him treat his employees horrible. And then it was my turn. I have two little kids, 5 and 2. So when I go places, they don't drink soda, I get them a cup of water. And every single place gives you a tiny shot glass for free - which usually don't have lids that fit. So I normally ask for a larger cup because I've got kids, they need lids so they don't spill. And EVERY place typically understands this and obliges. Not this guy. I asked for larger cups and he gives me them and my bill seemed high so I asked why. He charged me full price for the cups. So I paid $12 for waters that day. I told him about it and he was like, \"We don't sell the drinks, we sell the cups. Too many people wanting stuff for free.\" Deciding that was the right moment to lecture a family.   It's totally about service. You've got a family standing in front of you... just bite the $.10 for the cup and make them happy. They'll come back and spend even more money. But now, because you charged me $12 for water cups, and then argued with me about it, I'll never come back. The food was good, but a guest will never forget shitty service. And this was the owner, mind you. Or the GM at least."}
{"text":"I thought the food was really good. A great selection of toppings and they are presented very well in front of you like a salad bar. I have food allergies and I was able to build a good pizza and not feel cheated or cheat too much."}
{"text":"Pizza is ok, service is alright, but they skimp on toppings. If your like me and like a lot of cheese, and toppings, try somewhere else. The pizza tastes good, but nothing hardly on it. Ordered pizza with cheddar cheese added , could hardly even tell there was cheddar cheese on it, but they sure still charged us for extra."}
{"text":"I ordered a food delivery order from here, the restaurant didn't send an order of meatballs or the cheesy bread. Pizza was soggy and not even warm, wings were tiny. Just not impressed, and way overpriced for the quality of food!!"}
{"text":"I'm from an area of the US where build your own pizza chains have been a thing for years, so I've tried a lot of them. Firenza is hands down the worst out of all I've been to. I went in midday on a Saturday and the place was nearly empty and no one was in line. I approached the counter and the worker seemed utterly disinterested in what he was doing and behind him the other employees were complaining to who I believe was the manager. I made my pizza and went to pay and several employees just looked at me until someone finally came to help. The pizza took 15 minutes to then receive which since it was the only one is kind of ridiculous.   And then there's the pizza itself. Bland. Holy cow so bland. The crust was bland, the tomato sauce as bland. There weren't enough toppings (I ordered a margherita so basil, tomatoes, and mozzarella, add mushrooms) to give it any flavour. The one redeeming quality was that the crust had a good crispiness to it.   Even for the price I expected a bit more, especially when the market has better options for less."}
{"text":"I live nearby and knew I'd eventually give this place a try.  I love pizza, so on 3/23/17 we decided to grab a pie for dinner.  I called in my order (a pizza and cheese sticks) & was told it'd be ready in 25 mins.  That was fine, I had shopping to do at Target.  When we arrived I went to the register, the cashier brought out my pizza and opened to box to show me the pie.  The pizza was so burnt. I told him, no - that wasn't going to work. He apologized and said they'd remake it.  Now when I say burnt, I mean black as the letters I'm typing, black as the Yelp logo at the top of this screen. I wish I'd taken a picture.  I wasn't happy but had to wait another 20 mins.  Mind you my cheese sticks are getting cold. There was no offer to remake those, knowing they'd be cold by the time the 2nd pizza was done. Fine, I have an oven.  When the pizza was brought out, I asked for parm cheese and the cashier said he'd get it.  I waited and waited and waited.  He helped other people, he did other tasks behind the register...umm hello?!!  Finally I asked if he planned on getting the Parmesan and finally got it.  I told the owner's daughter I wasn't happy and she apologized and was very nice.  She even offered a free pie the next time.  I told her I'd really have to consider there being a next time and left.  When I got home, I realized the pizza didn't have all the toppings I paid for.  My cheese sticks had to be completely reheated.  Needless to say they lost a customer.  After all the reviews I read, I was a bit surprised at the service.  I expected better."}
{"text":"Build your own pizza!!!   Tons of fresh toppings!  A 10\" pizza is only $7.99 with unlimited toppings. You can't beat that!  The owner is super nice!  Loves kids and has hired super excited local kids!  Everyone was very nice and respectful. By the way, the pizza is FANTASTIC!"}
{"text":"Delicious fresh ingredients to make your own pizza.  You order it as you go down the line.  Then into the oven it goes.  Yummy!  My seven year old gives it a thumbs up."}
{"text":"So... the BF told me that they make personalized Gluten Free pies... I'm all for gluten free after all, like they asked, is it an allergy or a preference? I said, who would want this as a preference?  Anyway, I loved my pizza. I made my own. Went a little crazy with toppings and even splurged for the garlic crust! It's kind of like a Moe's operation. At least I know my pizza isn't sitting there. I saw the guy making the dough, although they keep the GF personal pizza crusts separate.   Staff friendly. The GM, I assume, Complimented me on pronouncing ricotta the correct Italian way. Of course us Italian  New Yorkers know. He must have been told bc he wasn't even there when I ordered my pizza!   I recommend. I ate the whole thing. I think I'm good for dinner and breakfast tomorrow!   If you want a quick personal pizza. Go!   9/8/17 -- here's an update. I'm pretty disappointed in this place. My first experience was so great! 4 times after, I got sick. The last time was the work. It was the pure definition of \"getting glutened\". By the time I realized that they didn't change the gloves or the spoon for the sauce and said something it got so crowded that I was on a lunch hour that I figured \"how bad can it be\". Well, it was. Ruined my whole weekend. Celiac Disease sucks and it just proves that with a lot of these places that say \"gluten free\" really might be just they have gluten free items but how safe is it?   Maybe if they had a little more training. I don't know. All I know is, without the gory details, my head in the toil bowl became my friend for hours"}
{"text":"Had a great lunch with my coworker. Upbeat environment, great food, and overall great experience. I will recommend my friends in the Northlake area and I will be back. Ordered personal pizza and salad. Simple but delicious."}
{"text":"I honestly like the concept and fresh stone oven cooking. The issue I have is for the cost there should be better presentation with the pizza. The outcome was like an expensive Cici quality product. The food is truly hot and fresh but very skimpy of the toppings and overall presentation is not worth the money. What we did like were the wings as the seasoning was spot on and not overcooked.   Bottom line this is not a place that I would write home about and would not return on the simple fact  price not equal to quality served. I don't see the concept lasting more than a year."}
{"text":"This was my second visit to Firenza, and both times I've been pleased with the food and customer service. It's similar to other \"customize your own pizza\" spots like Mod Pizza or Blaze, and they have a decent section of toppings. They seem to be slightly more expensive, but they also have great promotions. For example, my husband and I received a free order of wings for buying 2 create your own pizzas and 2 drinks. Overall, I'm excited to have a place like this in the Northlake area, and I'm sure I'll be back!"}
{"text":"New pizza spot in the Northlake area and very convenient after shopping at nearby Target or for lunch after leaving Massage Envy.  The pizza is pretty good but the problem is some of the staff are slow and not familiar with what toppings go on their pizzas, so instead of moving quickly through the line, someone is constantly glancing at the menu to see what goes on the pizza, and I still had to stop them from attempting to put onions on a pizza that according to the menu should have red peppers instead(vegetariana).  This happened on both my visits so something clearly went wrong during training."}
{"text":"Walked in & was greeted by 3 young ladies  behind the counter: good. As I looked at the menu on the wall, I made my way to the counter. The 3 young ladies were deeply involved in their conversation to the far left. As one of them put on her gloves to (I assume help me) they continued with their conversation. The young lady stood in front of me & then continued to engage in their conversation. They didn't even noticed that I walked off until I got to the door, one of them yelled \"ma'am can I help you?\"  Clearly your conversation was more important than my order. Not a good first impression. Though I'd get some kind of service since I was the ONLY customer there. Disappointed that I didn't get to try the food."}
{"text":"Kinda small but friendly and very clean. Workers clothes are clean. Ingredients are fresh and pizza is GOOD!  Tasty. Excellent prices on pizza and salads!"}
{"text":"This is our go to fav for personal Pizza ( though it really big enough that I always save 1/2 for next day lunch) Everyone who works there is super nice and the ingredients are very fresh. You can get garlic crust as a free option. They let you pick out as many toppings as you want and bake it up in about 10 minutes. Its a thin crust pizza that is a nice balance between chewy and crispy ( but if you add a ton of veg- it can be on the wet side- but thats on you)   They also have gluten free options for those who need that option.  There is another chain across the street/ but we like this one better."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place since it opened. Today was the day. Well maybe I should've tried another day. I did the create your own pizza. The first girl shaping my dough definitely didn't know what she was doing. My crust was completely lumpy and uneven. I moved on to the toppings girl next. I couldn't hear her because they had Power 98 and Rap blasting. She didn't know which sauce was which and she put all my toppings in the middle of my pizza. Once I received my pizza I thought it tasted good, especially for the price.  The toppings were really fresh and quality.  The reason I'm only giving 2 stars is because of the loud rap playing, catering to the employees, the staff not having a clue what they are doing and because for such a new restaurant the cleanliness is not good."}
{"text":"Good pizza but the toppings were all kind of clumped together. The garlic was a bit much because of this. The staff was nice but clearly they are still learning. Good price for what you get. I will go back and try something without the garlic!"}
{"text":"Visited Firenza tonight.  I kept it simple for my first visit...i got the Monterey pizza, one of their five or six signature pizzas.  It was delicious.  But really on my diet cheat day I love all carbs.  The other reviews have covered the basics, it's fast casual made to order pizza.  I noticed they also had wings and salads.  The ingredients are fresh and higher quality.  The owner was chit chatting with me about it while I waited for my food.  All of the employees were cheerful, particularly the younger gals working the front.  It's nice to see service workers with pleasant attitudes these days.  The owner was chatty and clearly takes pride in his establishment and product.  There was a hiccup with my order, my first pizza was overdone and had to be remade.  I was offered a slice while I waited.    Bottom line:  great value, good people and good food.  If only I could eat carbs more often."}
{"text":"Eaten here twice pizza is great and 7.99 for a create your own 10\" is a hard to beat price  Make sure you get the Firenza crust!!!"}
{"text":"Fast casual pizza chain that allows you to personalize your pizza with as many toppings for one price. hmmm sound familiar? (Hint: yes and the answer is Blaze)  Firenza is North Charlotte's solution to South End's Blaze location. It's located in the Target shopping center that's near Northlake Mall. It's a bit on the smaller side, compared to Blaze's large, open feel.   I visited today during my lunch as well as last week when they were offering the $2 pizza promotion donation. NIGHT AND DAY between those two visits. Last week, the line was wrapped around the inside and the place was fully-staffed. Today's visit, there was nobody in line and about three or four employees behind the counter. The guy who prepared my pizza seemed to be a little out of it? I don't know, it was kind of hard to figure out his demeanor but he was well-meaning. He started off by spelling my name wrong even though I spelled it out three times and he seemed to still be learning the menu because I asked for a menu pizza (the Texas BBQ) and he had to keep referencing his guide throughout the pizza prep.  Both visits, the employees operated on the slower side. To me, fast-casual means fast prep to be enjoyed in a casual restaurant environment. They haven't caught on to the 'fast' part yet, so I'll chalk this up to the new-ness of the place.  Pretty much the same veggie and meat options are offered here as Blaze, however, Firenza does have broccoli as choice unlike Blaze. BIG plus for me because I love broccoli on pizza. They also offer milkshakes, a coca cola freestyle machine, and sweet tea drink options. My total for a 10\" pizza and regular drink came to $10.49.   I do enjoy Blaze's pizza crust better but I think the Firenza staff is still figuring out pizza prep because my crusts were different this week vs last week. Most likely, I will be visiting Firenza more frequently solely due to the convenience of its location to my job."}
{"text":"5/5/17: We revisited Firenza last evening and met the owner, Rob C., who was truly gracious and kind.  He mentioned he was away that weekend due to his father being ill - we are still wishing his family the best.  Everyone knew their role last night, and it was smooth and stream-lined, and extremely pleasant.  Two side salads and two personal pies...  I don't know how to post pics on this thing, but you can email me if you want to see pizza, it looked and tasted great, or message and show me how to post them.    Customer service is important to me.  Like I've said before, I'd go to a place with mediocre food and terrific wait staff, vs. a place with to die for food and sub-par wait staff.  Firenza Corp's and Rob's constant customer service communication fell just short of coming to my house for a sit-down!  :)  I appreciated that fully.  I'd gladly recommend Firenza Charlotte to any friends or family.    No one gets five stars unless Jesus himself refills my water.  -Kim  Late April: Since our visit to Firenza Northlake, I've communicated (via email) with Robert C., the owner, Stacey at their Corp.Office, and Dave B.  Homemade pizzas must be the new hot model out right now (remember frozen yogurt, then all the burger bars, well now it's gonna be pizza).  It seems that Firenza wants to keep open lines of communication with their customers, and ensure that the food and the service are top notch.    The owner was has asked us to come back, along with another nice perk, to give them another try.  I told him I would, but probably in a few months once the operation has reached and learned to operate near maximum efficiency during business hours.    I increased their rating to a 3, and hope to be able to give them five stars after our next visit.  All in all, I was impressed with their communication, and want to understand the issue, and resolve it.  Thank you to the Firenza Corp team, Dave B, Rob C.  -Kim S. Milligan"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! My family and I really enjoyed ourselves! We took advantage of the free 10' pizza with a $2 donation deal, and boy are we glad we did! We ordered the Margarita, the Buffalo Chicken, and the build your own, which included alfredo sauce, mozzarella, spinach, red onions, chicken and banana peppers. Delicious! They had a line, but it moved fast! They make your pizza right in front of you like a sub shop and bake it in a (I think its called a) brick oven. You give them your name after you order and they call you when its done. It only took about 5 minutes or less to receive our order. While eating, 2 of the employees, one seeming to be a manager, came over to see if we were enjoying our pizza & visit. Very pleasant experience. The free pizza special continues until Sat. 6/9. Don't forget to take $2 for each 10' pizza you plan on ordering. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I came in during a late afternoon one day and created a pizza. The $7.99 price wasn't bad, but when it was arrived not only was it cut completely wrong (a weird zig zag pattern), it was burnt on the bottom. Won't come back to this place, especially when there's so many other places in the area that serve a much better (and tastier!) pizza."}
{"text":"Definitely check this place out.  Pick a pizza off the menu or craft your own.  7.99 for unlimited toppings!  I got the gluten free crust (extra charge) and 3 toppings I picked.  This pizza was delicious!!!  It's also a big pie for an individual."}
{"text":"Stay away from this restaurant!! This was the worst customer experience I've ever had in a restaurant!!  We ordered and paid for a single small pizza upon arrival. We were told it would take 10 minutes. After 30 minutes we were told they were just starting the pizza. After 40 minutes we were told \"sorry, we are aren't sure what happened to your pizza\". After I spoke to the owner all I received was a \"sorry, I don't know what happened\".  Not once did the owner or an employee actually offer to fix the problem by actually making the pizza or offering a refund. After approximately 50 minutes we left without ever getting our food. We had to ask multiple times at the end for a refund. It was never offered to us.   This was the most awful and sorry example of customer service I've ever experienced at a restaurant.  Even the other guests were commenting how ridiculous this experience was. Don't waste your time or money patronizing a restaurant where an owner cares so little about his customers and their experience."}
{"text":"New pizza joint in Northlake area. Prices are okay for pizza. Bring an apron to wear as you eat the pizza as the burnt corn meal will be all over you. The dude behind the counter was rushing us to choose what to have on our pizzas. There was no one else in line. The burnt corn meal also overpowers any flavors of the pizza. Was hoping to have a great experience here. Drive the mile down the road and go to Tony's to get excellent pizza and customer service."}
{"text":"Ok! Firenza I absolutely love  your location here in University City. I walked in to a great welcome from your staff and the Topcat Cheerleaders!   Ordering my pizza was very simple and the dough was freshly hand tossed in front of you. The ingredients were clean and very fresh! I love the big red pizza oven where the pizzas are made. The two registers were a little confusing but i believe one was to provide you with the order number and the other was for payment.   After sitting down it took about 5-7 minutes for my pizza to come out. A gentleman politely came over and placed my pizza on the table and asked if I needed anything else. Then a few of the owners and social media came to introduce themselves also. I must say the music, I was surprisingly impressed with the music selection. They had the latest hip hop and r&b playing. I loved it, just listening to the beats of the music was great.   Totally recommend you swinging by here if you're free this week! They have activities happening all week long!"}
{"text":"Location is cool. It's across from Target next to the mall and right off the Interstate. The inside has plenty of seating and clean. Also a tv turner to sports channel. When you walk in someone from behind the counter screams welcome. I had a flashback to Welcome to CiCi's pizza. The menu is on the wall before you get to the counter where they make your food. They offer pizza and salads. I ordered a personal pizza. So here is where they lost stars..... why is the menu behind me and not in front of me so I can tell the people what I want. Soni had to keep turning my heading and trying to read the wall Behind me. Second I order the Signature Firenze pizza. Why doesn't your staff know the ingredients. This was the longest process every. I've never seen anyone add ingredients in Slow Motion!!! The staff should at least memorize the first few ingredients if not all. The offer a very small wine and beer selection. I had white wine price if typical price. The pizza was delivered to my table. It was piping hot and the toppings just slide off I had to eat it with a fork. They should put more cheese on top to keep the ingredients from falling off. This was my first time. Not impressed enough to come back any time soon. I think Pizza Hut thin crust pizza is better than this."}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times now. I won't include the first time in my judgement of this place, since it was the opening night.   Each of the two other times it has been slow service and burnt pizza. I went in tonight with only 1 couple in front of me and it took me 25 minutes from when I got there to when I walked out. There were at least 7 employees and I saw probably 4 of them standing around doing nothing. Then when I was finally helped, the service was slow and my pizza was burnt. Every time I've been the pizza has been burnt.   I really wanted to like this place, but I don't think I will be coming back.   The kids that work there should really learn what customer service is."}
{"text":"This place is one of the best pizza places ever. Make your own homemade pizza with whatever toppings you want. They make it and put it in a fire stone oven to cook. Love this place I've been here twice and make it a habit to come every time I'm in the area. I would say that the staff needs to be alittle more professional they're kids playing around in the back and that could a turn off to ppl. Management seems to be very focused and on point.  The space itself is clean and welcoming."}
{"text":"Absolute TERRIBLE customer service. Waited over 45 minutes for an online order that we ordered ahead of time. When we complained they just shrugged and said sorry. They screwed up our order and multiple peoples orders as we were waiting. Will not return."}
{"text":"I come here a lot and the pizza is fantastic! Sometimes the staff is a little light in terms of numbers so it can be a longer wait but they're always friendly and courteous. I highly recommend Firenza!"}
{"text":"Great pizza place right next to Ikea! Staff was very welcoming with fast service. Wide selection of pizzas made to order right in front of you. Atmosphere is pleasant, organized and clean. Fresh ingredients even at 9pm! Pizza and antipasto salad were delicious. Our 3 year old wanted more olives and the staff happily gave her another at no charge. Bonus side note, the red tile oven is beautiful too! Found my new favorite pizza place! Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I was used to this concept with Mod Pizza. I believe Mod is a little better but this location was good. Staff was very friendly and quick. Nice, clean, inviting place. Again the food was pretty good and I truly love this concept, being able to see my food made and the freshness of it. Will definetly visit often."}
{"text":"I saw this place was opening at Northlake and decided to give it a try tonight with my roommate.  First of all - the wait.  We arrived a little after 7:00pm on a Friday night and we waited in line for over 40 minutes.  It's a quick-service restaurant similar to Chipotle, so I was wondering why the wait was so incredibly long - maybe they are working out kinks?  We finally get up the counter and like most build-your-pizza shops, we chose our crust, our sauce, our toppings, etc.  The service was extremely disappointing.  I don't know if it was just a bad night, but I soon found out why the line was so incredibly long.  The workers moved at a snail's pace - whether it was putting on sauce or toppings.  They were overly meticulous with everything and in a quick service restaurant, in my opinion, that's not needed.  Pizzas were backing up and the line became quickly jammed.  In total, it took us almost an hour and a half from the time we arrived to the time we left.  For a restaurant of this style, this is unacceptable.   The pizza itself was good, but nothing to write home about.  This place does have a Coke freestyle machine which is a plus.  I may visit again down the road (I'm not sure), but only to see if they've trained their employees better.  Speed and efficiency are key for a place like this."}
{"text":"It was one of the best pizzas I have ever had. The line was long, but it was because the pizza was only $2. So there was a ton of people. They were very personable. I would definitely eat there again. The cookies were a little hard. They have the coca-cola free style. The environment was welcoming and up-to-date."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza! Special order the way you want it! Everything tastes amazing...tomato sauce, garlic crusted pizza! If you love pizza, this is your place! Friendly service....they remembered our names!"}
{"text":"I usually am so spot on with my fellow yelpers.. so I'm shocked over the poor reviews!! I love a \"build your own pizza\"... and I love it even more when the toppings are fresh, gluten free crust is available and the pizza oven is real! I've been to a few of these types of places where the pizza literally cooks in an old Quiznos type oven! The crust here comes out bubbly, crispy and delicious!! I love the toppings and always opt for a build your own with spicy red sauce! The staff seems to finally be getting the swing of things (that's been a downfall of theirs) and hopefully soon the flow will work even better!"}
{"text":"I came here on a Sunday afternoon. The pizza is good, similar to Maddio's. You build your own pizza and wait while it's baked. Therefore, it will always be fresh and hot. The crust is on the thinner side. Sauce is traditional tomato, though there are other options.  Customer service left much to be desired. Everyone moved so slowly it was awkward. There was no long line. Think Tin Man before the oil, every movement was slow and painful to watch. It wasn't new business organizational kinks. It was individual sloth. They also weren't very peppy. Yes my pizza taste the same whether you smile or not, but my return visits won't be as frequent if you don't.  I'm glad to have another option for pizza in the neighborhood. Hopefully they'll get some Red Bulls for the staff. High traffic time here would be a nightmare."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza and excellent service! Super helpful service we enjoyed the salad too. Local beers are a nice touchy"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my create-your-own pizza I had for lunch today.  Service was good, but a little slow due to people in front of us not being able to make up their minds.  The staff was very accommodating and did their best to take care of everyone promptly, even with the changing demands at the last second.   I tried the garlic sauce recommendation on my crust and really enjoyed it.  The crust was nice and crunchy, the toppings very fresh. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Update: the pizza tastes a lot better. The process is still incredibly slow!    Not a fan. I came here mainly because I received a but one get one free coupon in the mail so me and the roomie went together.   There are so many kinks they need to figure out. The manager made our pizza. She took forever to make the dough to shape and add the sauce. There were 4 people in front of us and it probably took her about 8-10 minutes to get to us. The other employees appeared to be in the high school age range and appear to be learning what customer service is. Yelling from the dining room to the kitchen, serving dirty boxes, etc.   The taste of the pizza is mediocre at best. The crust is bland and adds no flavor. My pizza was with traditional sauce and it was also bland. I enjoy that I was able to add as many toppings as I wanted. I got black olives, kalamata olives, provolone and mozzarella cheese, bacon, and spinach. I ate the pizza but I wouldn't return.   $8 is too much for a mediocre 10-inch pizza for me added with the ridiculous wait time."}
{"text":"Pizza was - okay.  As first time customers and knowing this was a pretty new establishment, I expected the employees there to be a little more helpful while ordering.   Yes, it's straight forward, but they seemed impatient while we were trying to decide how we wanted to construct our personal pizzas.  They didn't ask us what kind of crust or what kind of cheese we wanted. Although there was no one behind us, they rushed us through everything.  Pizza was as just okay.  Nothing great. I would have much rather grabbed a slice at Tony's.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"So a bunch of these build your own pizza places are popping up all over and if you think they are all the same this is where you are wrong! Our whole experience at this place was rough. First finding it in the maze of stores set outside of the mall in itself was a challenge as they seem not to be listed on any of the signs. After finally arriving the service was awful and not because they were slammed but the staff truly were not trained on topping management we got so much of every topping the pizza was soggy and so much garlic was put on it not only was it inedible but my car is going to smell for weeks!  My suggestion go to Blaze where they know what they are doing!"}
{"text":"I really like the style of selecting the toppings for your pizza.  You think you know what you want then you see the selections and bam! you change it up.  The staff members were attentive and addressed me when I came in the door.  Once I saw the vast selections, I had to go back to the car to see what Mom wanted.  She stayed with the cheese pizza with regular sauce.  The price is pretty awesome at $7.50 (with tax).  I look forward to trying the spicy option when I return to order my own pizza.  While waiting for the pizza, I chatted with the manager.  He wanted to ensure I was satisfied with the service and then shared background on the fresh, higher level selection of cheeses they provide (not the commercial stuff).   It didn't take long for the pizza to cook in the oven (I watched).  Mom shared a slice with me and it was indeed pretty good.  We were both satisified.  I will definitely be back to try my own pizza.  No complaints here.  Whatever kinks were apparent when they opened have been corrected."}

{"text":"Had margherita pizza.  Sauce is too sweet and too little cheese.  A bunch of teenagers in there just running their mouths.  I actually had to wait for my pizza guy to stop his conversation with a co-worker about Snapchat, before he decided it was time to pay attention to taking my order.  Also, no please, thank you, nothing....I was left to fill out an iPad screen during check out while he stepped away and got back to his conversation.  Never. Again."}
