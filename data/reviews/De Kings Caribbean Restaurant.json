{"text":"This restaurant is a must visit and a true HIDDEN GEM!

Good Stuff: THE FOOD! the options are incredible! there are all the classic mains such as jerk chicken, chicken roti, oxtail, ackee and saltfish, as well as sides a plenty! Macaroni salad, macaroni and cheese, rice and beans, and Jamaican Patties! There are lunch specials at 6.99 and dinner specials I THINK at 8.99 (I took a picture but it came out too fuzzy), the portions are very sizeable. Great for sharing or a take home dinner for many! The flavour is perfect, not too spicy and well seasoned enough to make anyone fall in love with this place. The service is excellent, the staff there are kind and as the line reached the door the line progressed smoothly and quickly. Additionally they offer a membership card, where after a number of visits you get a free meal! The space is designed cafeteria style, and is bright and inviting. The seating includes tables and some seating against a wall, if you are planning to dine in during peak lunch hours make sure to come early to snag a seat!

Caution: The location is more driver friendly, but hey if you are taking the ttc from further away I can promise you it is worth it!

Overall impression: This place is wonderful! The food is delicious and the people are kind. This is a must visit!"}
{"text":"New fav Jerk place PERIOD!

Previous fav: Rasta Pasta down at Kensington but their portions are too little and their sides don't compete.

Everything about this place is pure checkmarks for me.

Generous portions?  check
affordable? check
quick service? check
simple sides with a lot of flavor? check
godly macaroni salad? check!!!!! a million

Previous reviews really hit the nail, flavor isnt too spicy (I like spicier but this is still good), and the chicken isnt dry. Everything cooked damn near perfect.

Stop reading on your bed or toilet, and just GO!"}
{"text":"FINALLY, a Caribbean restaurant next to me with delicious jerk chicken (this is all I've wanted in the neighborhood). Located right in the corner of the plaza at Dufferin and Steeles (North West corner), it is a convenient spot. There's plenty of parking!

When we went, it was a weekend afternoon. The restaurant was quite empty. They were advertising a lunch special for $6.99. To be honest, we went with the regular size and it was more worth it because although the price was higher, the portion was larger. You can choose from several different sides including salad or slaw (get the slaw!). The rice and beans were cooked perfectly. The chicken was delicious; full of flavour without being overly spicy. 

I would come again! Be sure to get their stamp card too!"}
{"text":"We went for lunch. There were lots of people sitting and eating in the restaurant. You stand in line order your meal and when you have it find a seat (that was a little tricky because by the time we got our meal all the tables were taken, we found seats at the bar near the door). The lineup was quick and we got our food in minutes. We ordered the chicken roti and the goat roti. The chicken roti was stuffed full and delicious. The goat was very tasty with a little heat, but if you're looking for quantity it's not as big as the chicken. We also each got a drink and the meal came to $23.  I'm definitely going back, next time I'm going to try the oxtail."}
{"text":"Ordered the following:

Large cup of-
oxtail ($14), and
curry goat ($13.50).

2 Tin-Nel's spicy beef patties at
$2 each.

Customer service was swift and accommodating at 8 pm.

Very good oxtail and curry goat; not loaded with fatty/cheap meat parts.

Worth its tag price.

Patty was served warm but not flaky.

Lunch specials start at $6."}
{"text":"Finally a good Caribbean Restaurant at Steels and Dufferin.  Open only the last 6 weeks or so. 

Had the lunch special for $6.99

Chicken with your choice of sides.  Rice, pasta, slaw, veg, and Caribbean Rice. 

Very friendly staff and the owner is working the line. 

The food is what you hope it would be.  Spicy, hot, and tasty.  

The place is very simple and is classic in the way they serve the food. 

I enjoyed coming here."}
{"text":"AWESOME!!! Soooo delicious! I am overjoyed to have this restaurant in my own neighborhood!  Taste & quality are absolutely the best! I'm sitting here making \"Mmmmm, Mmmmm, Mmmmm....\" noises all the way through my ox tail & curry goat combo!"}
{"text":"Brand new Caribbean restaurant in the NW corner of Dufferin and Steeles.

Place does mainly take-out food (common among these types of restaurants).

Walked in during lunch time, there was a line-up.. most people ordered jerk chicken and roti dishes..

I ordered my standard Ox Tail with Rice and Peas - large order costed $14+...

Ask for extra gravy on top for the rice.. didn't really get enough gravy...

The Ox Tail was really tender!!! Fall off da bone! Tasted pretty good... 

For a large order, I got about 8 small pieces of Ox Tail.. I think that's a bit under portioned for $12.75 plus tax.. 4 stars on the quality, 2 stars for the quantity..

The Rice and Peas were so-so.. I noticed they used some pretty large size beans.. so along the way when eating the rice, you will get a nice big explosive beans taste.. LIKE!! But the rice and peas was missing gravy..

Inspecting their menu a bit more, I would perhaps come back to try their jerk pork and maybe some sort of stew.. just because they push stews a lot and Ox Tail was really tender."}
{"text":"Bought takeout for lunch today and it was absolutely delicious! BBQ chicken was fall-off-the bone delicious and juicy, as was the jerk chicken. The rice and beans were seasoned well with just a little spicy kick. The ladies working behind the counter are extremely friendly! Great food and excellent customer service. Will come again for sure."}
