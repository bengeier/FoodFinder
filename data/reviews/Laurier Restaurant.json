{"text":"Staying at Best Western and just wanted to walk to find a neighborhood restaurant. Turned down 7th street and found Laurier. I has their special of cod, three shrimp, mashed potatoes and veggies. My dinner was excellent. My husband has a lobster ravioli and loved his dinner. Our creme brûlée was outstanding. The service by Milan (?) was of the most outstanding. We are going back."}
{"text":"Eclectic space. Ridiculously expensive.  Risotto was terrible.   Cocktail was good. I won't go back and do not recommend this place."}
{"text":"So so disappointed with the \" new Laurier Restaurant\"... we were excited to return after their months long renovation.  But they completely changed the menu concept!!  Think lots of quiche , eggs and galette . The food is no where near as good as the \" old Laurier\".  Makes me sad as we will never return.  I know sometimes change is good - but not this time ."}
{"text":"My husband and I celebrated our 8 year wedding anniversary here and it was wonderful. The server was incredibly attentive even noticing I was a bit cold (by the window) and offering me a blanket!! The food was fantastic! We did the fondue dinner for two and after every dish I was sad it was over and we already can't wait to go back! Thanks Laurier house for such a memorable experience!"}
{"text":"Went here with a group of people, and ended up having the patio to ourselves. So cozy with the glass encasing and fireplace! The service was amazing, very friendly and knowledgeable. We came for drinks, appies, and poutine. The bacon wrapped dates are to die for, and everyone LOVED the poutines. I personally found them to be a little too salty, but it wouldn't stop me from ordering it again. Just under five stars for this, and that my scallops were tiny and over cooked. Great time though!"}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven`t been here before, as I live right around the corner. But iI dropped by for a coworker for a light dinner this evening. My boudin blanc was a chicken and veal sausage, seasoned perfectly and topped with apples and mushrooms. His steak and frites was exactly what it sounds like. It too was well seasoned and perfectly done. To finish off, I had the maple cassoulet and he had an Irish coffee. The cassoulet is a self saucing pudding served warm with ice cream. Delicious. 

The service was very quick and friendly. Can one ask for moreÉ

My next visit won`t be three years in the making."}
{"text":"This is a cool little restaurant I always take people visiting from out of town to for brunch. It's an old small house that they converted into a restaurant so it has a lot of character, not your run of the mill breakfast spot. The service here is top notch and they make some of the best coffee in town. Home made crapes, croissants, fruit plate and eggs Bennie, yummmmmm.  I'd recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"I have an update on this place already, yes, I like it that much. 
This time around, I went for lighter fare, and chose something that's much easier to eat while trying to converse on a date. I had the pear salad, and my date the caeser salad. Let me start with my salad. The food presentation is something that sets the Laurier Lounge apart. My pear was poached, and serves in what looked like a star, to the left of my plate. It was drizzled with a  balsamic vinegar that complimented the sweetness of the pears. Then to the right, was a huge standard green salad. The caesar salad came as a large full lettuce head (romaine) that had been put on the bbq, it came with pancetta bacon bits and a light caesar dressing. A bit hard to cut, because bacon flew everywhere, but still tasty. Dessert was a molten lava cake with vanilla ice cream served beside in, on a spun sugar shell. A few bites did me in - but really yummy without being too heavy. 
The service was amazing as usual, and the food came out in a timely manner. Again, I'm going to need to hit up the brunch sometime soon, and in reality it'll probably be in the next month, so look for that update to come!"}
{"text":"Food quality is good, a pretty small menu but their appetizers/smaller plates are great.

The athmosphere is a little... weird. The disco ball and other strange eclectic decorations don't seem to be benefitting the restuaraunt. Though the location is fantastic, and if you get away from the disco ball and sit on the patio or in the sun room area it's a very nice place to be.

Prices are super cheap, especially for a nice place donwtown. If you're on a budget this would be an excellent place for a night out.

The bar is good, cocktail list has some cool and interesting things as well. 

The staff are all great, service is very friendly, professional and light-hearted."}
{"text":"The poutine is a must try, it's so sinfully good you know it's all worth it after your first bite. 

The other dishes were fresh and flavorful. 

Service there is wonderful!"}
{"text":"Nice ambiance, decent food, good service, and friendly staff."}
{"text":"They have the best Hamburger in the city ! Great service. Cozy patio. Well    
priced food, and great location. Well worth a visit."}
{"text":"we had the fondue dinner.. oh my it was fabulous. we had a group of 6 and ordered 2 fondue dinners with two other appetizers and we had to roll ourselves out of the restaurant. The service was excellent and this is one of my favourite dining experiences in Calgary so far."}
{"text":"Not just burgers anymore. This place has really stepped up their menu with the introduction of the award winning Master Chef Ryan O'Flynn. Happy they kept one of my old favorites the Smoked Salmon Bruschetta while the The Beef Bourguignon was phenomenal! Check out their Sunday Wine Enthusiast night. Five wines selected from their reserve list are 50% off regular price."}
{"text":"Finally made it to Laurier for brunch on a lovely Sunday morning.

Pros:
Delicious food - brunch plate was a nice mix with half an eggs bennie
Very nice service, food came in good time
Coffee filled on time
Reasonable prices
Nice patio
Inside decor was relaxed and subtle

Cons:
Hopefully a gluten free option will be available (like toast or buns)

I will definitely be back, I have yet to try this poutine everyone is talking about!"}
{"text":"So, my experience with the Laurier Lounge did not mirror any of the previous reviews at all.  Took up their offer of The Big Taste Calgary for lunch and wow, what a disappointment.  They served a Cream of Mussel soup whose broth was so watery and tasteless that it would make canned soup from Campbells seem delicious. The braised lamb shank was overdone, the mashed potatoes boring and the ratatouille was a little blah.  The restaurant (upstairs) was quite full and got very stuffy, very fast.  Also, their menus - look like they have been done by a 14 year old dungeons and dragons geek on his Pentium 4 PC.  The club soda was good, it had ice and lime.  

Boring wine list, boring desserts that are surprisingly expensive.  Perhaps dinner or lounging is a better experience but if you are considering it for lunch, rethink."}
{"text":"Tucked in an adorable little building, the Laurier Lounge has a huge advantage on any other brunch spot in the city - it's the one place you won't have to line up for an hour or two for a table for a party of 5 at 11am.

That said, although the setting is adorable, it's never that busy, and the food tastes great (their mushroom Eggs Benedict is DELICIOUS), they do have a few glitches that need ironing out.

The first time we went here, we had a server who both screwed up our orders, and when my sister knocked over a glass (which then broke all over her), took over 10 minutes to bring the  napkins, towels & a bin for the glass we asked for, which meant my sister had to pick up the pieces with her bare hands and had no way to dry off. 

This time was better, but our breakfasts & the coffee was all lukewarm. 

So, while I'll still keep going here (my family isn't as picky as I am), I'm still not ready to give them a great review until their service picks up."}
{"text":"I would give a four or five stars last month, but as my last week experience I will only give three stars. I went to there for their classic pontine last week, my friends and I were very disappointed! Their new chef changed the old pontine to a kind of thin tiny dry fries with salty and greasy gravy. Hopefully they will change back to the old pontine!"}
{"text":"Meh..Fondue quite pricey.  $112.00 for the couples fondue.  It was about $30.00 worth of seafood and $5.00 of veggies.  Our bill for fondue for two, two bottles of wine $250.00.  We are not cheap diners.  But for $250.00 of our hard-earned money at least put some effort into it.

The first floor is quaint, cozy.  The bar area was a comfortable, yummy morsel in itself.   The  bartender was friendly, prompt and full of smiles.  Not sure if I would go back for dinner....maybe for a drink in the bar or on the patio in the summer.

Overall dinner presentation was bland.  The baked potato completely soaked in butter like something you would get from Wendy's.  The house salad was nothing special.  Looked and tasted rubbery like it came from a bag.  No culinary expression attempted.

Table service completey scattered.  We had two to three servers for our table of eight.   No smiles, no conversation.   Forgotten drinks, forgotten plates of seafood for the fondue.  Fondue pots looked dirty.  One of the fondue pots caught on fire at the table.  A bottle of Coors Lite $7.00....really?!  If upcharging an astronomical amount for bottles of wine at least compromise on the beer.  

Overall...really nothing to write home about or refer someone to...."}
{"text":"Was in Canada for 5 days visiting and craved fondue. DO NOT EAT THE FONDUE!! The cheese course is unbelievably bland and vegetable stock may be more waist friendly but doesn't provide the same flavor as a good peanut oil. The dinner is also too expensive. If you want to try the best fondue in US, try Geja's in Chicago, Illinois."}
{"text":"Wow we loved this place. Beautiful atmosphere, great service, delicious food. The beef bourguignon was soooo tender, and the sauce it was in was perfect. The mashed potatoes were fluffy and perfect. we washed it down with a half litre of the house red, and finished the meal off with chocolate fondue and coffee. Both were on point! 
Looking forward to coming back here soon. The prices are so reasonable and we had a perfect date night."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed eating breakfast here this past Saturday. I arrived at about 10:30 a.m. and we waited a few minutes to be seated. This restaurant use to be a house.When you walk in, the kitchen is to the left and some of the dining area is to your right. We were escorted up the stairs, where they have 4 more little areas for eating (All former bedrooms),  We sat in the room to the right at the end of the hall. It's a very cozy environment, and we had the whole room to ourselves. Most of us ordered the Brunch plate, that has your choice of Eggs Benny 3 different ways. Pancetta, smoked salmon, and I can't remember the third one (sorry). it also comes with a strawberry crepe, and potatoes. It was indeed very tasty. In fact after I finished my plate, I was still craving another eggs benedict. We also had the strawberry crepes, which my son really enjoyed. The coffee that was ordered I hear was quite strong. It was good, just quite strong.
The service was friendly, and was good. I also noticed that a 20% gratuity was automatically added.

I will definitely come back to Laurier lounge, but next time for lunch."}
{"text":"Three times now I have gone to Laurier Lounge for fondue and it's been fantastic.  The atmosphere is quite unique, as it is in a historic building downtown, and there are many little private rooms for hosting birthday    dinners, stagette dinners, etc.  The mojitos are to die for (especially the blueberry ones, you can order them by the jug).  Another recent experience was for brunch.  A little pricey, but amazing, I tried a plate of Eggs benny (with fresh asparagus, mushrooms and brie), came with a crepe, homemade croissant with homemade berry compote, it was so delish.  I definitely recommend Laurier Lounge for a fun fondue night with friends or for an amazing bruch!"}
{"text":"Eclectic feel. Small lounge area. Maybe 15 seats, but not comfortably. The upstairs is well thought out with private rooms and nice comfortable banquette seating. I love restaurants in old house conversations as they always have a nice warm atmosphere. 
They have large selection of fondue which can get on the pricey side (but I hear it's worth it). Variety of poutines, which were delicious and nice wine list. We had the baked brie for an appetizer and it was great. 
I don't have really anything negative to say about this place and I thought haaarrrd.
:)"}
{"text":"Laurier Lounge can easily be missed if you aren't looking for it hard enough. Kind of tucked behind the Safeway it stands there on its own radiating an old school charm. Although I find it a little odd when you first walk to the steps to hear music that you would probably expect to hear at some Mexican festival be sure to keep  moving forward through the front door.

Small in size but large in coziness with a low lit intimate atmosphere that is great for first dates, second dates or just dates in general. Great for when you want to have a quiet gathering with your friends and family to celebrate whatever you feel like making up that day.

Our server was attentive and patient as we had never been there before so we were trying to figure out what to eat, mind you, changing our minds once or twice to make sure we are trying something we really want to have.

We came in a party of 20 something so I really don't remember what everyone had besides what my one friend who sat at the same table as I did and of course what I had as well.

I wasn't hugely hungry but I didn't not want to eat either so I settled for their lounge menu and ordered the Cajun Chicken Burger which Laurier Lounge claims as the second best burger in Calgary with a side of fries. The Cajun Chicken Burger consists of Spicy raspberry chutney, brie, garlic aioli, lettuce and tomato.

This burger was huge, I had to cut it into four pieces and devour it one corner at a time. Not to mention that it comes with a side of fries which are delicious and make you even more full than you previously were trying to munch down the burger.

My friend sitting across the table from me had the Warren Buffet Burger which has onion, emmentaler cheese, horse radish & aioli, lettuce and tomato. Again I think the size of the burger is huge (for me anyway). Beef itself was tasty and delicious. He also ordered poutine instead of friends and it really made me sad when I saw his poutine and even more sad when I tasted it - simply salivating (is that a real word??).

I would definitely come back here for another go at something different on the menu."}
{"text":"I find this place a bit pretentious and the service was quite rude.  The food I had here was very average, and the prices are a bit steep.  I have no desire of returning here."}
{"text":"The food is nice but well overpriced. Two starters/sharers $16 and $19, two 6oz glasses of wine (Californian and Argentinian) $10 each, side dish $6!!!! come on, that is just a rip off."}
{"text":"The menu and chef may have changed but Laurier Lounge remains a must visit. Sadly coquille st. jaques is off the menu but having bouillabaisse and cassoulet more than makes up for it. Staff are all very knowledgeable and attentive and the space is cozy and welcoming. Don't hesitate, make your reservation soon."}
{"text":"I love this place. The ambiance. The food. I've had dinner -- both entree style & the \"fondue experience\" -- as well as brunch. It's never been anything but great."}
{"text":"I'm surprised that this was my first check-in, as I go quite frequently. Such a great place!

And they do mostly gluten free! Yay! Love their patio, love sitting outside there. 
We took my mom for her birthday, my parents shared the fondue experience and loved it! 

I went the free range chicken breast with quinoa. Yum yum! Perfect size. 

They also do an epic brunch! Hard to get into, but worth it!"}
{"text":"This is what I call a hidden gem! The atmosphere is super adorable, from the outside it looks like a house and the inside is super romantic at night. I love the brunch specials they have on the weekend. The only con is the prices are a little on the higher side."}
{"text":"Me and wife went there cause we heard people yelping about this place.....
SERVICE : I give 4 out of 10
Cause our server was nice. But the service very slow. 
FOOD : I give 3 out of 10 
Cause my food had no flavour, very dull and greasy. I have had better risotto for less price. My boulabaise* came in very greasy and cold. Server did offer me to replace but I lost my appetite after I waited 5-8 min to get her attention. 
DRINKS : I give 9 out of 10
Cause my wife liked her wine and cocktail. On a good side I loved there still water.
CONCLUSION : 
 The restaurant business concept is very simple... I love any food Cold, Hot, Crapy but if ask for the right price. Dont raise the price cause you are in a trendy little nook. Ask for $$$ but in return give the flavours & quality.
PLEASE dont charge for water if you cant make the food right. I have been to wolf gang puck restaurants and they dont charge for water. I am not comparing here, I know there is difference but still!
 Look may be this place had a bad day today, but the problem is I will not be taking my credit card there again. Infact the two tables around us had complaints .. one with fondue and the other one with sea bass. Any way always remember 
\" first impresion is always the last impression \""}
{"text":"Great fondue and a unique ambiance in the historical house. A not bad patio/bar for the summer too."}
{"text":"Went for Sunday Brunch and was so impressed! It's a cute little place built in an older house. The menu is to die for! So good! I had the Laurier Brunch Plate which includes a single eggs Benny, a single strawberry crepe and some of their delicious breakfast potatoes. I had the smoked salmon eggs Benny which was not like any I've ever had; the salmon was prepared in a \"bruschetta\" with tomatoes and capers... So good! The hollandaise sauce was also perfectly silky and light!  They also had $3 mimosas which definitely go down easy!"}
{"text":"Great brunch place.
A bit of a hidden gem as we had just walked away from Monki that literally had a several hour wait at noon on a Saturday.
We both had the \"Brunch platter\" which comes with 1 benny (your choice of pancetta, smoked salmon or grilled mushrooms), delicious potatoes, bacon (I subbed for fruit), and TWO crepes with strawberries and whip for $14.99 all served in a charmingly old home (The upstairs is still divided as separate rooms).
A pretty delicious and unique breakfast platter I would say!"}
{"text":"Excellent French Bistro.  Had the Beef Bourguignon and the house wine - a lovely Portugese red.  The portion sizes are small which I really appreciate - there's nothing like trying to plow your way through a large serving of Beef Bourguignon.  Our server, Davi, was first rate.  All in all we had an excellent dinner with friends at a great value.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I have heard a lot of great things about the Laurier Lounge. While walking down around downtown one day looking for a place to lunch, I passed by a cute little house. And then realized I had stumbled upon this restaurant that is hailed among the tweeps I follow.

I decided to stop in and I ordered the steak croissant sandwich. That has Brie on it. And a delicious Dijon mustard. And Brie. I fell in love with that croissant-wich sitting on that patio while sipping a cold beer and enjoying the warm sunshine. PLUS they were playing French jazz. I can honestly state that I felt like i was on vacation outside of Calgary sitting on that patio that early afternoon. I did have that patio to myself so that could have swayed the vibe in my favour, but I will take it.

I do need to return to Laurier Lounge. Not just to nurture the relationship I have with my new favorite sandwich ever, but also to try the poutine that I have looked at with food envy on Instagram so many times."}
{"text":"Factasic lunch menu, amazing food- the Leek and Cauliflower soup is Devine.  The service is very prompt,  accurate and welcoming.  The ambiance is relaxing and very nice.  5*'s well deserved."}
{"text":"We went here for fondue and we were really impressed.   It's small and quant from the outside - I wouldn't expect to find a tiny little house in the middle of downtown.  The menu is very french and along with that is a lot of fat content so keep that in mind. 

The different rooms of the house have mostly been preserved so there are only a few tables around you but the decor is still very modern.   The food all came out with nice china and it was quite classy. 

The food itself was good although the presentation was plain.   I found the price of the fondue a bit pricey for what we got but It was still a very nice evening out. 

My sister loves the brunch here and has been trying to get us there fore it.  One of these days I'll give that a try."}
{"text":"Still Awesome. Try the mushroom ravioli, crab cakes and brie ... with a glass a wine - to die for. An awesome way to kick off a weekend. Still one of the best places in town. Fabulous."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a drink and a nosh before our Yelp Elite event tonight. First time I've been to Laurier but I had heard good things and I was not disappointed.  Only going 4 stars as we only did a glass of wine and appys so I'll want to try a full meal to give up the 5th star.  The service, awesome.  A lovely gentleman seated us upstairs in a cozy corner and our waitress was great.  Wonderful smile, nice suggestions on the wine and appys.  We each had a glass of Pinot Noir, a bottle of fizzy water (only 1.25 and they keep refilling for you) and the baked brie.  All were delish.  The room upstairs is really nice with a long banquet along the outside wall and easily set up tables for 2 or 4.  Price are in line for the size of appys and wine by the glass is reasonable with a good selection.  Definitely recommend and will be back."}
{"text":"Laurier Lounge is a quirky atmosphere. It's an old red house that's been turned into a a quaint french restaurant. It's front porch is great outdoor seating and it's located away on its own so it feels secluded and is probably great for dates. The food is all very yummy and they have good pricing and usually some great drink specials. Overall an affordable, yummy, and cute dinning experience."}
{"text":"What a hidden gem in the heart of town.
Go enjoy Laurier lounge but keep it a secret!

We enjoyed everything from the classic building & decoration to the charming ladies who greeted us with a French-English accent, to the menu and service.

Definitely going back."}
{"text":"Big Taste & weekly date night landed us at Laurier Lounge on Saturday. I had been here once before for a girlfriends birthday, we had a wonderful private room upstairs and the food was excellent. This time, I was eager to try the fondue since we usually venture up to Banff for that. We were seated upstairs again, which was lovely, however the lighting was so dim that I could NOT see the menu! The waitress must have noted my squinting (and my face about 2 inches from the menu) so she brought over another candle. It didn't help much, but I appreciated the gesture. The dim lighting made for a really romantic setting, so I couldn't complain too much. The ambiance was very warm and cozy, I liked that a lot.

Since we were set on the Big Taste menu, we knew what we were getting right away, which was the 3 course fondue meal. We ordered a bottle of wine to start off, which as usual in these types of restaurants was RIDICULOU$, but it was date night so why not. I could tell the server was busy so I didn't pay too much attention to our wait time, especially since I was in good company, but it seemed that the wine did take a while. She actually spilled a bit on my foot while pouring it - no biggie, just a waste of my wine! Haha. We debated ordering some appies along with our fondue, but our waitress simply stated that it would be \"too much food\". Now, we like to eat. A LOT. So I found it a little off putting, but we decided to share a soup anyway. Once that was out of the way, we received our first course which was the cheese & bread, and it was heavenly. The second was the meat (ball?) with a variety of sauces. I enjoyed the sauces a lot, but I wasn't a big fan of the broth cooking method as well as the cut of beef (so thin)...I really enjoy Grizzly House in Banff because there is a hot rock method that is much tastier/healthier and the pieces of meat are thick and flavorful. This was one thing that I found Laurier Lounge lacking in, but it's all about personal preference. Finally, we had the chocolate and fruit fondue which as always, was delicious. 

Thanks to the wine, our bill was a bit more than I expected, but it was a nice experience. I would like to return here for the poutine, because I've heard it's really tasty. However, the next time I am craving fondue, I will drive out to Banff for that."}
{"text":"I've been here for breakfast and dinner and I have to say this place is amazing. The breakfast is fantastic and the service is so quick, I swear I've been in and out in 20 minutes! Dinner is also great, lots of fantastic wine to chose from and the entrées are to die for! Chocolate fondue is what we opted for at dessert and I have to say it was pretty darn delicious. I love the fact that Laurier is in a small house, it adds a touch of authenticity. It has an eclectic feel that is trendy but still sort of French. It's kind of hard to explain but it's pretty fantastic. I would definitely recommend this place it's definitely an experience!"}
{"text":"The Laurier Lounge can be easy to miss if you don't know it's there. Hidden in behind Safeway, the old Stanley House (where George Stanley-from whom the design for the Canadian flag originated-grew up) is now home to a restaurant with a French accent and the Warren Buffett burger.

Having heard many great things over the years about a burger at the Laurier Lounge, this was my chance to finally try one. The lounge remains on the first floor, but up on the second floor, the original rooms of the house divvy up the space. Tables and chairs are arranged rather cozily. It's crowded on a busy day, but today, we had a room to ourselves.

Our server was friendly and attentive. Our food made fresh and without delay. I chose a side of soup with my burger. It was split pea and ham. \"It looks kind of gross because of the colour, but it tastes really good!\" the server promised as she took my order.

After a few bites, I understood why friends had been talking about the burger at the Laurier Lounge for so long. I savoured the last few bites and sat back, satisfied. I don't dare yet declare this the best burger I've had in Calgary, as I have many burgers left to try... but I do say, it's currently the front runner."}
{"text":"Had breakfast here after stumbling upon it by accident.
How could I have not been here before?!?!?!
I LOOOOOVE cute Frenchy cafe/bistro types.
Love that it's in an old house.
it was a lovely Saturday morning and we sat on the \"porch\"/\"patio with morning rays shining down... ahhh, I was in heaven.

I had the procuitto eggs benedict and it was yum, the potato/hash was super delicious too - crispy on the outside.. yumm!  accompanied with a mimosa, another happy day :)"}
{"text":"Dear Yelpers,
I'm letting you in on a little secret. Laurier Lounge does brunch and it's amazing. I'm not one to tell secrets without being able to back it up, so here's why:

Excellent coffee. Both espresso based drinks and the coffee press are the perfect pick-me-up on a weekend morning. 

Great eggs. The omelettes come open-faced, with a good meat/cheese/other toppings ratio.

Interesting potatoes. How often are you surprised by hash browns? Me either. I swear there is something sweet about these potatoes and I sometimes dream about them at night. 

Crepes and croissants - the sweet smell of home made baked goods hits you first. One look at the buttery croissant could possibly make a grown man cry...or at least a girl who can't eat wheat while everyone else at the table raves about how good they taste. 

A sunny, quiet patio. If you've been to the Laurier Lounge for dinner and sat out on the patio, you already know how perfect it is. Imagine that when the sun is shining.

Good staff, friendly owner, easy parking...lest you think I'm going on with nothing bad to say, I'm not a fan of their awkwardly placed bathroom, but I guess there isn't much choice given the location. 

I feel like everything at Laurier Lounge is well thought through. Hope you enjoy this gem as much as I do."}
{"text":"I was here last night for a private function on the 2nd floor and overall, nothing special stood out about this place.  It's nicely decorated for what it is but for the amount of people they try to fit into one room, it felt a bit cramped.  Service was friendly enough but it took about 15min for my drink to show up.  I ordered a beer.  Come on now.  

Out of the tapas I tried, the bacon wrapped dates were the best.  In fact, they were awesome and I could easily plow through one or two orders of that myself.  My main was a half order of the Real Deal Poutine which was more than enough.  It put me and others who ordered it as well into a food coma.  It's not the best poutine I've had in town, but it was average.  

I think I'd have to return for a date night or with a smaller group to get a better feel for the place before I could get excited about it."}
{"text":"This is a very nice patio/bar with a French flavour. Shrimp cocktail was very good, cheese plate abundant but no more than serviceable. My pasta was good, but no better (still, what do you expect when you order spaghetti with meat balls?). My friend's burger which is the self-proclaimed \"best burger in calgary\" looked very good but not up to its own billing. Interesting selection of beers. Good atmosphere. Harried servers who are nevertheless pleasant."}
{"text":"It's been so long since I've been here and I was surprised that the menu has changed. Although I do love change, I do miss my favorite dishes. Don't get me wrong, the food is not even remotely bad, I'm just nostalgic. The fondue will always be amazing though and same with pretty much any dessert you order! It would be impossible to cross Laurier off my list because it has awesome service and a great summer patio. It won't be long before I return again. To satisfy my craving for the past though, I'll have to either do the fondue experience again or opt for their awesome poutine."}
{"text":"The Laurier Lounge is a nice gem in the Beltline area of downtown.  It's a nice walking distance from our place so it's great for brunches.  Their eggs benedicts are very good.  The eggs are cooked perfectly every time.

Breakfast potatoes are excellent as well.  Staff is nice and friendly, and there's always a table available even on Sundays around 10~11am."}
{"text":"This place has a Good wine and good service... The cheese fondue was not bad... Even when is not very fancy or beautiful maybe I will go back...."}
{"text":"Waited months for the restaurant to reopen. Had dinner on Saturday before things got busy and it took 90 minutes for our entrees to arrive. I was served an over-salted flimsy steak for $38. I should have clued in as the table next to us commented to their server the same thing as well. Horrible value as it was one of those quick fry steaks you can get from the grocery store for $6. 

Really disappointed that our server did not acknowledge the delay nor offer an olive branch to rectify the situation. Only comment was 'trouble with the till' as a sneaky way to get us to confirm our entree when she clearly forgot to order our main dishes. I don't mind that she forgot - I mind that it still took an hour after that point for our entrees to come out.  Two appetizers, two entrees and a bottle of wine for $153. 

I was loyal to Laurier Lounge and truly hope Laurier Restaurant gets their act together. I will never be back as all aspects of charm from the previous restaurant have disappeared."}
{"text":"A friend's birthday always lines up with Big Taste so for the last three years we've been coming here for their Big Taste fondue special.

The fondue dinner starts with cheese fondue and bread. Don't be afraid to ask for more bread because I will judge you if there's any cheese left in the bowl.

Next is the broth fondue. You get a pinwheel of beef, a small baked potato, small salad, and some mushrooms and zucchini. The beef, mushrooms, and zucchini can all be cooked to perfection in the broth. I don't suggest putting your baked potato in there. You also get a few dips for your meat and veggies. They're all delicious.

Finally the best of all is the desert fondue. Melted chocolate (Toblerone?) with fruit and wafer cookies to dip.

Overall the restaurant is quaint. It has history (ask your server) and the entire place is broken up into little rooms with only a few tables in each area. Its a good spot for a first date when you need some conversation that doesn't involve yelling across the table to hear each other, eat some good food, and enjoy a signature cocktail or two."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is fantastic. Staff is professional and kind and fun. Cheese fondue is out of this world and smoked salmon tartare is amazing! Great wine list, great patio.... I could go on and on! One of my favourites in Calgary, been going for years :)"}
{"text":"Cute restaurant with good fondue and eggs benedict!  I love sitting in the solarium on a sunny day because it feels so bright and open. Keep in mind that the type of food is a lot more rich and heavy so either come with an appetite or enough people to share. For brunch, try the Laurier plate as it gives you a sample of everything (the salmon and the mushrooms eggs benny are definitely some of the better bennies in the city). It'd be nice if this plate had less fries and a bit more fruit or veggies.  However, I'm sure lots of people wouldn't mind the extra fries. The 3 dollar mimosa is also a good way to start your day :)"}
{"text":"We came here for the Big Taste YYC Festival because who doesn't love three courses of fondue?

The historic building was once the childhood home of our flag designer, George Stanley, it is relatively well-maintained and very unique setting for a dinner out.

We had our own private room upstairs and enjoyed the ambiance.   Our server was somewhat busy so things took rather long, but nothing too out of the ordinary for a Friday night downtown.

The first course was a cheese and bread fondue which was very tasty, but would have liked some other stuff besides bread to dip in like perhaps apple slices.

Second course was the beef fondue which I'd never had before and was rather interesting!   It came with a baked potato (totally delicious), some mushrooms and zucchini to dunk into the beef broth, as well as a salad.   The beef was very tender and also came with a few different dipping sauces.

The final and most exciting course (for me) was the chocolate fondue!   It came with bananas, pineapple, strawberries and banana bread to dunk into the chocolatey goodness :)

I wasn't drinking, but my friends all tried some of the cocktails and martinis and all said they were tasty.   

Overall, the experience was good, I'd definitely like to go back and try their brunch though.   The dinner was tasty but nothing outstanding, and the service was a bit slow and scattered.   I will definitely be back though to try more menu items."}
