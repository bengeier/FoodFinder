{"text":"I've been walkin' by this place for YEARS and it wasn't until I read Lindsay K's review that I decided to actually peak my head in.  First of all - the service here is EXCELLENT. A husband and wife duo run the place and thanks to the ambiance and the food, it truly feels like you're having lunch at a family member's place.  The food is EXCELLENT and Lindsay K's not kidding when she says that the ingredients are SUPER fresh. I had the veggie sandwich and it had everything in it from brocolli and cabbage, to fresh lettuce and tomatoes!  The prices are great. I got a HUGE sandwich and a HUGE soup for less than $7! That's unheard of for downtown Calgary!  The location is also ouber convenient. It's a block away from the 8th street stop and a block away from the 10th street stop! It's easy peasy to get to!  So let's recap:  - AMAZING food -EXCEPTIONAL service - Convenient location - Ridiculously reasonable pricing - And a super comfortable set-up  Are you on your way yet?"}

I ordered the namesake from the only guy behind the counter and he set to work. It took about two minutes from start to finish, and he made good foam. Cappucinos really shouldn't be dranken \"to go\" but since I had to go anyways, it was good. Tasty, caffeinated, awesome: these all describe my cappuccino. I approve. Not in the top 5 of Calgary coffee shops, but infinitely better than most of the chains hanging around."}
{"text":"Cappuccino Company is such a cute place to have a cup of coffee and a sandwich or pastry.  They have delicious sandwiches and make them in all different varieties with yummy, fresh ingredients.  All their food is made fresh everyday and right in front of you so you know what you're getting.  Their pastries are super delicious; not too sugary, not to doughy, just right.  They have reasonable prices for both their food and drinks.  I don't feel like I'm getting ripped off when I go in, so that's always a bonus.  I think you definitely pay for what you get here, and that's good service, top quality food and drinks.  The only problem with C.C. is that it's so out of the way for anyone in a vehicle... or even walking.  Since it's all the way at the end of the C-Train line, it's pretty inconvenient to get to, especially if you're driving.  Poor guys.  I think they'd get a lot more business in a better location."}
