{"text":"We are regulars but tonight we tried Korean short ribs which were amazing!  If you haven't tried this place the sushi and everything else is so good!"}
{"text":"Best sushi in Charlotte, hands down. Jimmy is the master of all things sushi!!! Its hard to pick a favorite but the Ahi Poke is always a winner. Love this place! Try it out!!"}
{"text":"The old Tony Roma's is now the Sky bar, and the remodelling done to the place seems stylish and classy. I've noticed the place, but never stopped in until now, because it seems more bar than restaurant from the outside. The food was really great, which is a nice surprise to me, being a fairly tough one to please when it comes to Oriental cuisine. I've been back several times and been well satisfied with both the sweet/sour chicken and the scallops. I'm NOT a sushi fan, so no rating there, but what troubles me now is that its such a bad location, the traffic is so reduced that I'm sure they must be rethinking the choice, and needing some business. I've scanned these reviews and it seems the opinions are either great or bad. I hope they can continue to build a following, and draw a crowd big enough to sustain themselves. This place is right on a level with P. F. Chang's if you ask me, and thats pretty upscale for Pineville;  it would be a shame to have location be the negative that they can't overcome. I live in Pineville and its nice to have a classy place like this so close by. Try it - you'll like it !"}
{"text":"I guess our mistake was not getting any sushi.  Unfortunately with the bad taste on our mouth from what we ordered I don't think we will be coming back to try the sushi.  Place was empty so not sure why the kitchen couldn't have tasted the food.  We had a calamari for appt and that was the only think that was ok, not impressive but ok.  Portion was kind of small for the price.  My tempura vegetables were terrible.  No salt no flavor and way too greasy.  My husband had the teriyaki chicken, again not good.  My son had a cheeseburger from the kids menu, it look like it was a frozen bread and frozen patty put together.  My other son had the beef lo main (it was supposed to be the kids size) but was given an adult portion.  It was very salty.  None of us finished our food.  ;(   Our server seemed to rush us even though the place was empty.  Maybe it was because they were setting up for some kind of party or buffet."}
{"text":"I got the spicy Thai red curry with chicken and was not impressed. The sauce was super watery and the vegetables overpowered the entire dish. I wouldn't recommend the Thai cuisine."}
{"text":"My husband and I eat out a lot therefore have developed very picky tastes - in food quality, atmosphere and service. Sky Bistro has it all - 5 stars in every category! We are loyal to Sky and only dine elsewhere when we finally need a break from Asian food. But we are always back! This is our favorite place to dine and the staff have become our friends - it will be difficult if we ever move out of state :s"}
{"text":"My husband and I have eaten here several times. We love the food and the friendly service! My favorite dish is the Walnut Shrimp--YUM! I even chose to eat here for my birthday this past Saturday. Recommend!"}
{"text":"Some friends and I went to to Sky for my girlfriends birthday. Now granted I am way cooler than these guys, and hang out with them mostly so I can be seen as charitable. Appearances are important as we all know.

We started with the vegetable tempura, and I must say it was pretty darn good, not the best I have had, but pretty, pretty good. I was able to order my dinner,despite being oggled by the entire staff , guests at other tables, even my friends. In the midst of, carrying the conversation and being completely fascinating, and  not to mention soul shatteringly attractive, I was able to order the sushi combination.

The sushi was insanely fresh! It honestly was more than I expected. Being an awesome boyfriend(probably the best ever) I agreed to eat some of my girlfriends dragon roll, it was awesome. Simply the best dragon roll, I have ever eaten. And let me tell you sister, I have eaten many a dragon roll.

The service was on par and the place was clean. The staff was very pleasant. My only beef was that the decor seemed a bit confused, but that is a minor issue when compared to the painfully delicious sushi I shoved into my stupid face that night,"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere.   Food is pretty good.  Tried LoMein and Pad Thai this time.  Will return to try other dishes."}
{"text":"I used to love this place when I came to Charlotte on business.

I went to dinner there last night and it was awful. The usual King Crab Sushi roll that I used to love was awful.

I also had the lo-mein noodles that were usually good. They were awful last night. 

I don't know if they were having an off night, but the meal was subpar, and I won't be returning.

The place did not have a crowd which means other people must have known something that I did not!"}
{"text":"I've gone here three times so far since they opened up so that's a good sign. I LOVE their general tso chicken. It's super crispy, well cook and have the right level of spice to it. My sister and daughter LOVES their walnut shrimp. We are Asian foodie and we know how hard it is to find delicious general tso chicken and walnut shrimp so this place has us wanting to come back for more! The sushi is not great, but its not bad also. I also LOVE the interior decor. They did a great job on this place. I use to go here when it was Tony Roma's and you could tell the big difference.

Now the Cons is that the outside exterior needs some rework! There's nothing exciting about how the place looks like from the outside and that might be what is not attracting a lot of service. They have ONE waiter that is working most of the time and he is not very friendly looking. He speaks broken English, seems rude most of the time and likes to rush you when ordering and eating. The bathroom also has this bad smell to it. (This was one of the reasons why I stop going to Tony Romas) and it seems that the smell has not gone away. You almost have to hold your breath when you are in the bathroom. I think there's something wrong with the sewage system. 

But overall this place is worth a try!!! Don't let the negative affect you, the positive is that the food is good! :)"}
{"text":"Really great food and friendly staff.  This is one of the best Americanized sushi restaurants in Charlotte. I really love the serving sizes. Order two rolls and you are stuffed! 

Update: the restaurant would not honor my living-social prepaid voucher. We were in a large group (paying individually) and apparently one of my coworkers also wanted to use a prepaid voucher as well. 

The manager strictly enforced the one prepaid voucher per table. They said if we had sat at the bar, this would not have been an issue, but since we were at a table, it was a different case altogether, and they would enforce the policy."}
{"text":"Sushi was good for the price... service was great, too and the restaurant is beautiful. Gotta love their Tuesday special too -- buy two rolls get one free!"}
{"text":"The food here is fantastic, especially the sushi, but the service is spotty. I've gone and gotten great service and I've gone and sat unwaited on for so long that the hostess noticed and came and took our order."}
{"text":"This place is just great!! The sushi chef can make virtually any sushi roll you can put your mind to, and make it very well. Definitely a hidden gem in Pineville."}
{"text":"This was one of the worst sushi restaurants I've ever eaten at. I hope the owners read this and take it to heart. Why do you think your restaurant is empty? The sushi is not fresh and the rolls were way to big and not good at all. Put some pride in your restaurant. Do you or your family eat here? I doubt it. Come on, redecorate your old worn out restaurant and hire a decent sushi chef and buy fresh fish etc. You are in a prime location but who would want to eat here?
Seriously disappointing.

{"text":"My gf and I frequent Sky Sushi when we're passing through. I've tried several of the sushi restaurants closer to our home in Fort Mill, but haven't found anything that we like better than Sky. Azn used to be a favorite of ours when we were in South Park, but without better options closer to home, Sky has sneaked its way into our default place for asian cuisine. 

Pros: Fat noodles in the lo mien. Don't know why, but many asian restaurants have started using skinny noodles. Not a fan. 

Broccoli was awesome. Some of the best I've had. 

The sushi tasted fresh and has been consistent each time we've eaten there. Today I had the Sky roll, which i'll probably get 9/10 times I return. 

Cons:
Hasn't established itself. Usually kind of empty. Rice in the sushi could be a little better."}
{"text":"Omg!!!! Love this place!!!! We go twice a week and the sushi is so fresh and good. The regular food is awesome also. The staff is very friendly also. I recommend this restaurant to everyone who has not eaten there."}
{"text":"Tonight was our first visit here and probably our last. The sushi was great but the service was terrible. Our server finally came to the table after 10-15 min of being seated and took our drink orders. We then waited so long for our drinks that two other servers finally came to check on us, and one mentioned there were no orders at the bar waiting. The rest of the experience pretty much followed suit for the next two hours--lots of waiting for food and refills; not only for us, but for many others in the same section. Again, the sushi was good, but overall it just wasn't a great experience."}
{"text":"This is the best Asian bistro I have ever ate at (or every day for the past week). Sushi tops any Japanese restaurant I have ever been to. All the other food is excellent also. Great and friendly staff. I could eat here every day for the rest of my life. Thank you Sky staff."}
{"text":"Terrible restaurant. It looks like it should be good from the outside and when you first step inside. But .. I ordered a sushi dish that revealed a string of hair underneath the sushi after I had already eaten a couple of bites. I sent it back. The waitress gave me a mealy, embarrassed apology. So against my better judgment I ordered a fried rice dish replacement but could not eat that because it was so smelly. The dish and the food smelled bad. 
On top of all that the waitress still billed me for the sushi dish. I left that place and went elsewhere for a decent meal.
This place does not take pride in food preparation and I was very concerned about food poisoning.  I would not recommend eating at this establishment at all.
If I could give 0 stars, I would."}
{"text":"Went on a Wed night and ordered way too much food!  Everything was great, Including the service!  Place is very clean and nice, will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"They have been consistently Great every single time we visit this place. 
From Decor, to the Ambiance, Food Taste and Customer Service, this place is Awesome! 
We love their Veggie Sushi Rolls, Lettuce Wrap and Spi Sa Cha with Tofu. I will surely recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Must visit must go back! I frequent this place just to enjoy a good deal, a good meal and most of all GREAT sushi. Very clean location and super friendly staff. Nice music is played, very upbeat. The bar is pretty and drinks are tasty. Saki is my favorite, prefer the apple flavors. I do not live near pineville but I def. travel those 20miles+ just to Indulge in some SKY!"}
{"text":"Wonderful!! Great food and beautiful decor! Sky Asian Bistro is a great place for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"For asian food in the south, this one is pretty good.  The restaurant is very modern, clean, nice staff.   I had Hot and Sour Soup and California Roll and they both were very good.  The appetizers - calamari and pot stickers were very good.  I was surprised that I liked it as much as I did."}
{"text":"Came on a weekday evening with family (2 small kids). The place was not busy at the prime dinner time. 

The restaurant was clean and welcoming. Really liked what they did to renovate from the Rib/BBQ place that was there prior.  As some have mentioned, the music was a little loud but the kids enjoyed the 80s hits. 

We had the Dragon/ Phoenix, Sha-sha Beef, and chicken hibachi stir-fry to split for the kids. Overall it was average at best. There are so many things that Sky could improve and they are on the verge of being a nice venue. I really hope that they make improvements with them. Some of those being overly corn-starched sauces that make them too thick and gummy. The sauces seem like they are out of a can or bottle and not truly chef prepared. Also educate the servers to navigate first timers through the menu. Again, they just need to tweak a few items to really highlight this place. 

On a side note, best thing we got was the side of Lo Main. Everyone loves the Lo Main!"}
{"text":"The rice in the sushi doesn't have good texture- almost like basmati instead of sushi rice, and the crunch ( crispy fried tempura pieces) is a little over used in rolls that shouldn't/ don't need it as an ingredient. I have tried this place twice and while the decor and service is great, I just am not a fan of the sushi rolls."}
{"text":"This has become our new favorite sushi place.  The food is delicious and the servers are friendly and accommodating."}
{"text":"Very tasty an nice folks.sushi was fresh and delicious.  We have been here many times and always very pleased."}
{"text":"I've ordered my food to-go here twice, and each time I fall more in love with the decor inside. It's very modern, dark and stylish. As far as food goes, I really enjoy the ala cart menu because I love small plates where I can have lots of variety without getting overly full... $2 for a nice portion of lo mein, $2 for a bowl of wonton soup and then a couple sushi rolls make me a very happy camper! The sushi is fresh and the rice is perfectly sweet and soft. I can't wait to dine in next time and try more items from the menu!"}
{"text":"Food was great. Large portions and friendly service. Very nice upscale atmosphere. Pricing is not bad at all. Definitely will comeback."}
{"text":"We live in Ballantyne, so there is plenty of sushi around us but I saw a Living Social deal and have tired of the same ole same ole cherry blossom role or Village Roll at Jade, or the Yum Yum at 18, and even the Tuna Maki 101 at Sushi 101. They are all good of course, but this new place was worth at least a try. It isn't IN Ballantyne, but nearby in Pineville, but I have to say, the short drive was worth it. I went with my sushi loving teenage daughter on a Saturday night around 8pm. The parking lot and the place was fairly empty, so I was worried at first, but it is down on the right across from the mall, with only a hotel there behind it, so as for location and visibility, this place needs to do some more serious marketing like they did for their grand opening when they had a billboard on I-485 and other advertising and stay consistent with it because its semi hidden location could become its downfall. Overall, the decor is nice, we sat at the sushi bar, there was only one other couple seated there. Service was good and the staff friendly. The sushi is fresh and professionally prepared by obviously experienced sushi chefs. One recommended the Tuna Cube, which had a limited description but we went ahead with it and it was awesome! It really isn't a \"cube\" but 6 pieces of bite size sushi (not rolled). We also ordered a Bombay Roll which is spicy crunchy tuna topped with eel, avocado & fish roe (excellent!), a Volcano Roll which is salmon, tuna & yellowtail fried, topped w/roe, scallions & special sauce (also excellent!) and finally, The Sky Roll, tuna, avocado, spicy mayo & crunchy topped w/shrimp, tuna & salmon. We found this roll to be a tad clunky, maybe because of the thick cut of the pieces, they had recommended the  EBTKS Roll that has tuna, salmon, eel, yellowtail, lobster salad, and tempura flakes with the chef's special dressing but we had ordered the Sky Roll instead. We will definitely go with the EBTKS Roll instead on our next trip. The owner and his partner spoke with us for a few minutes, they were very nice, and indicated the location was problematic. Apparently they have a Lake Norman restaurant together as well but it isn't name Sky I don't believe. I sure hope they figure out a solution for the location issue quickly, it is a good asian fusion place worthy of your time and $$!  Definitely go and eat there!"}
{"text":"This is the best sushi I've ever had, and one of the finest meals I've had in the Charlotte area. The salmon nigiri is so good I had to close my eyes when I ate it. Sushi chef Timmy does an excellent job recommending and preparing the finest cuts, from seafood to Kobe beef seared rare. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"We ate there on Friday for dinner, correctly thinking that being a new place it might not be crowded. Very nice decor, they've really changed it from the Tony Roma's that used to be there. Bang bang shrimp was excellent, fried pork pot stickers were very flavorful, although could have been cooked more.Lots of food on the entree dishes, I had Dragon and Phoenix, very nice (not exceptional), Deb was not impressed with her chicken dish. We don't do sushi, but the menu was extensive. A solid addition to the dining scene."}
{"text":"Honestly, it's the the bestest of the freshest but daaang, 5 stars for overall rating. I'll tell you why:

-superior decor, upon entering you'll quickly notice how cool this place looks. I like that!
-friendly service right off the bat. We walked in and promptly got fast and friendly service throughout our entire stay. Thumbs up!
-fantastic presentation of food. From the affordable appetizers to the large sashimi portions and moderate sized sushi rolls. super plus for not skimping on the sashimi slices. That's a big Nono! So they're a big yes yes! 
-food tasted great.. Not melt in your mouth great but when all of the above is good, it definitely melts on the way down when it passes by your heart :) that's close enough for me. I mean hey, if the world were perfect, we all wouldn't be helping now would we. 

My recommendation, try the sashimi and sushi combo for two, it was very satisfying for the 9 pieces of sashimi we got and the roll ( we got a rainbow roll that was good). We also ordered an extra fancy roll that was absolutely relish. For appetizers we got a seaweed salad and a spicy tuna ball. I can't ever see how anyone could go wrong with either of those selections!"}
{"text":"i love this place it's so nice and the people are friendly. Prices are kind of high but I guess it's worth it"}
{"text":"This place have a lot of great potential as in location but it's hidden in the back - service is great. I ordered the rainbow roll and two sake nigiri. The rice was dry and needed more rice vinegar. The fresh is not as fresh as most places. Overall, it's okay. I would go back and try their stir fry."}
{"text":"Our server was so nice went above and beyond food was good but nothing to special . The kids meals were cheap prob just Tyson frozen nuggets but my kids like that"}
{"text":"My husband and I always like trying different places to eat when we travel.  This restaurant was not the one we originally planned to go to, but it ended up as a second choice.  We had started out for a German restaurant that had been recommended for us to try.  We weren't familiar with the area and as we were driving to the directions given by GPS, we came upon a closed road due to bridge being out.  We had missed the detour signs and ended up at Sky instead.  

It wasn't crowded and we were hungry.  I ordered sesame chicken and hubby got a shrimp/ scallop dish.   The food was very good and freshly made.   I ordered a cocktail that sounded better than it was.  It was all right, but not worth the $8.99 cost.  Our server was attentive and friendly.  

The main thing that spoiled our experience was that we were seated next to a table of four teenage girls who lacked table manners and general courtesy.  We would have asked for a different table but none were available.  So we and other diners around us got to hear giggles, the  sharing of food being tossed in to each other's mouths, selfies, and of course, verses from various pop songs being sung louder than necessary.  I felt bad for the server as she was trying to keep everyone happy in spite of this squad of Taylor Swift wanna-bees.   The thing that dumbfounded me was learning the parent of one of the girls was at the restaurant, but she was seated clear across the room away from them.   Momma had her laptop open at a table and was supposedly working.  My husband said she was probably on Match.com.   Momma never came to their table or asked her daughter and friends to be a little more considerate of others.  Their behavior was \"acceptable.\"  Why would she? They weren't right beside her.   

My husband and I thought about asking management to do something, but it seemed they were familiar with this group.  Best to just eat fast and leave.  
So I doubt that we will return here on our next visit to the area."}

{"text":"Everything here is delicious!! Great variety in both bar and menu!   

Being from Las Vegas I get pretty spoiled and picky about Asian food....  but I would eat here again and again!!"}
{"text":"Every meal I have had here has been delicious and very fresh. The sushi is great and they are very willing to change ingredient(s) to fit your liking. I do love my sushi, however the Korean ribs are my absolute favorite. Impeccable flavor. The atmosphere is nice, very family-friendly and the service is also good. A couple times we had one certain waiter that was a little too nice, if that can count as a complaint, sitting down with us and chatting for longer than we woud've liked instead of paying attention to our drinks. But hey, if that's the only complaint, Sky Asian is doing an awesome job. Will continue to come here!"}
{"text":"I love the sushi here! It is fresh and never takes a long time to get to the table. 
It is also nice because they offer a full chinese menu in case you have friends who aren't fans of sushi. The atmosphere is very cool, yet still appropriate for families.

I will say however, that the service is slow. The servers don't talk very much and aren't the friendliest people in the world. However, my drinks always stay filled to the rim which I always find to be a major plus..

One time I went here for dinner with my fiancé, and my server disappeared for about 15 mins. Although the other girl came by to ask if everything was ok, I was disturbed when our server came back smelling like pure cigarette smoke. . which is very unappetizing and unprofessional in my opinion."}
{"text":"BEAUTIFUL restaurant, the food is excellent. They have 20.00 sushi all you can eat. Nice for travelers too."}
{"text":"The service was wonderful. We had a super sweet waitress and the host was very kind as well. The restaurant is very clean and beautiful decorated. The food is the only reason that I give this rating a 4. Most of my sushi rolls unraveled before getting it to my mouth. Pet peeve of mine I guess, other than that- no complaints. We will definitely go back the next time we are in town."}
{"text":"I had a wonderful meal yesterday. Everything was great and the service was excellent. I've passed that for about 2 years and who knew it was this good"}
{"text":"I love the all you can eat sushi and slider buffet. The sliders are delicious. Different varieties. Chicken and Kobe beef, yum. Nigiri is good fresh quality with thick slices of fish. Wish they had yellowtail jalapeño but this is definitely worth trying. A lot to choose from including appetizers. Sliders are pretty big so don't fill up on them if you want sushi. Would like to see more sushi options. I'm not a fan of crunch and yum yum sauce on my sushi rolls."}
{"text":"Service was lightning fast and the rolls (got a regular spicy salmon) were big and full of fish, not just all rice like some other places.  It was rather empty for a Saturday night, which was alarming at first, but the food was great and the service was fantastic and attentive.  Will be a regular place for us when we get our sushi cravings."}
{"text":"Nice hidden restaurant in Pineville. Always good sushi and never crazy busy inside. 
Good all you can eat price that includes good options."}
{"text":"All you can eat sushi - What a find!  It is GOOD sushi.  Also included is salad, seaweed salad, miso soup, sliders & more sides if you like.  We are very pleased & will be back!"}
{"text":"Had the crunchy salmon roll and excellent. Bar tender made a terrible lemon drop so I got a nice glass of wine and all was well. Great music and atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Honestly one of the very best Asian restaurants in Charlotte. We originally came just for the sushi but the entrees have brought us back many times! They have great specials during the week! The food and service are equally impressive and I know we will be back for more soon!!!"}
{"text":"I was really craving sashimi and decided to go even with inconsistent ratings.  It was great.  The fish was tasty and the portions were great.  The fish was a bit \"icy\" which was the reason the four star rating, but it was still very good.  The service was good and I would would go back.  My eyes were much bigger than my stomach, and I ate way too much, but it was a good deal the amt. of sashimi I got."}
{"text":"Saw a Groupon for this brand new sushi joint near Carolina Place mall. Seeing as I'm a sushi nut, I had to give it a try. It's a little off the road, but the sign on the building is noticeable.

It has the best atmosphere of any sushi place I've been to - classy, comfortable, spacious, not loud. Very unique. Our server was friendly and attentive but a little jumbled, but we could tell she was just new. It was pretty empty for a Friday night, but I figured that's probably because they haven't been open long.

On to the food. My partner and I ordered a Sky Roll and a Rainbow Roll. They came out pretty quickly. The fish on my Sky Roll was so fresh it literally melted in my mouth, and even the avocado was tasty. The fish on his Rainbow Roll didn't look as fresh, but he said it was still good. Beautiful presentation too (wish I had taken a picture). I got miso soup as a side - the tofu actually tasted like soy, which was refreshing, but the broth was a little too salty for my palate. Not bad though. The boyfriend got a side of steamed vegetables, which were honestly delicious and probably the freshest steamed veggies I've ever had at a restaurant. If they were frozen, coulda fooled me.

They also have a unique sake list (and hot house sake if you ask for it). I picked up some cold unfiltered TyKu coconut sake, and I TOTALLY recommend it. Like alcoholic coconut milk - yum!

Overall, cool, classy atmosphere and fresh, tasty food. Recommended for anyone looking to hit a new sushi spot. Don't let this one go out of business - it's a keeper!"}
{"text":"I liked the environment at this restaurant, even though it's a bit more of an \"American Pub\" or \"oven fired pizza\" kind of place than an Asian Bistro.  That said, it has good background music and a pleasant feel.

The service is very good.

The food was so-so.  I enjoyed the crab rangoon dip, but the calamari was more French fry-ish than I'm used to.  My kung pao shrimp was well flavored with just a bit of heat.  My boyfriend didn't particularly like his sushi.  

Big selling point - there were 3$ draft beers!"}
{"text":"Best sliders ever. \"El diablo\" that what they are call. Have to tried them. Fantastic. Great beacon and the dread was amazing. Definitely going back."}
{"text":"I love Sky bistro. We live in Pineville and it is close to home for us and offers an awesome variety of food.. I'd have to drive all over the city to get that kind of an awesome spread! The food is good. Always well prepared. There isn't a bad thing on the menu! It's never crowded, we always get seated promptly. It's ideal for a quick fix when you have competing palates."}
{"text":"All I can say while stuffing my face is omg !! Delicious ! Fresh sushi ! Bomb ass sliders !! Best AUCE place I've ever been to"}
{"text":"First time there with my wife.  Very pleasant decor, excellent service, very good selection of Asian Fusion.  We'll be back-"}
{"text":"Great calamari, lamb dish was excellent and I regularly go here for Sushi.  Jimmy the sushi chef will customize what you request and won't disappoint!  Be sure to top him he works hard!

As for the review by Luna seems to have the only negative review and it seems quite biased.  Perhaps works or owns a competing restaurant?"}
{"text":"Interesting menu concept. All you can eat sushi and sliders. With some restrictions but fair ones   Sushi was good. Sliders were tasty. 3 hot teas to choose from. Great service. Will return in future"}
{"text":"I was here last Sunday at 11:30 for lunch with my girlfriend. We were the first and only one there. Greeted and seated promptly. Our orders: 
Bang Bang Shrimps, seaweed salad, edamame, shrimp shumai (stream dumplings), and curry stir noodle with shrimp and chicken. 
My friend like her Bang Bang shrimps, she tries some of the shumai and liked it. I didn't.. It was just a big mush. Didn't taste like shrimp. Completely fall apart and very bland. The seaweed salad and the edamame are good and typical. My chicken and shrimp curry noodle is also bland. A giant big of noodles with very little shrimps, some chicken and some veggies. 
The lady waitress, barely stops by.. My water was left empty for a long time. Mind you the place is empty. When she brought the bill. It was $36 and some change. I gave her $40 and tell her to bring back the changes so I can at least tip her a little more. She never came back. Totally disappear to the back. So I'm like, guess she only want $3 in tip. Not a place I will come back again!"}
{"text":"Very good once again...We dined here n April and again in August. This restaurant continues to not disappoint. The food is consistently good and their cocktails are wonderful too. Great wait staff and all requests for things like no onions is complied with. The meals are good yet not as expensive as other local restaurants.

Everything we've eaten here has been good. Sushi is not our thing so can't speak on that topic.

The location is tucked away off Pineville-Mathews Road. The convenient proximity to our home makes it an even more attractive eatery for us..."}
{"text":"Any time the wife and I have some alone time this is where we dine.  The food is well balanced the atmosphere allows for quiet conversation.  We love this place!  If you are dining here for the first time I recommend the white tiger roll as an appetizer."}
{"text":"Tucked away in a location that if you weren't looking you wouldn't find it. Fresh, fast & great customer service.  W/a menu that appeals to both sushi & Chinese food lovers a like."}
{"text":"I've been eating here for years. But aside for the fact the menu has changed and all my favs are gone. I was forced to stand waiting today at the counter entirely too long and then when I was finally seated the waitress never even noticed she had a new patron. Unbelievable and unacceptable. Good bye."}
{"text":"A pleasant surprise using Groupon.
Hiding in plain sight. Had to figure out the order form for AYCE (all you can eat) option. 

Happy not to fight crowds at buffet line and enjoy a quiet,  unhurried dining experience.  

Food presentation was very elegant."}
{"text":"My wife had a date night and we chose to try something new. She has traditional sweet and sour chicken, which the portions was enough for two people, and it was delicious. I had the Pad thai noodles and it just didn't hit my palette well, I wasn't please with it at all, and didn't finish. The egg rolls were awesome, our waiter(Kyle) was awesome also. Affordable, fast service, and fresh food."}
{"text":"Placed the order online , was told it would be ready in 10 minutes. Got there and they said they didn't have an order , after giving them the order number and showing the screenshot of my order and that I paid they found the order. Was told it would be out in 10 minutes , there's wasn't an apology , of anything offered for the mistake. 40 minutes after I was told the food would be ready , it comes out of the kitchen. When I got back to the office , I discovered the Kung Pao chicken I ordered , actually wound up being sesame chicken. So if you're looking for your order on time or with any semblance of accuracy , I would check to make sure when you get it and to make sure they received the order before you leave to pick it up.  Atmosphere looked pretty nice and the menu and concept were cool , sucks this had to be the first and probably last experience."}
{"text":"We decided to go here for dinner since we had never been here and my wife had some sort of coupon for buy one roll get one half off. So we drove here at the height of rush hour traffic but easily found a parking space. We were quickly seated and I ordered a mess of sushi nigiri and two salmon based rolls. My wife is having pot stickers and sesame chicken.

The rolls that I chose weren't anything special and by that I mean that they were average tasting at best. No outstanding flavors. The sushi nigiri was average as well. The uni in particular looked dried out but still was moist and tasty. The salmon didn't have any flavor which was very odd. I think I had the salmon lovers roll and the Alaska roll. 

I think that to get the real low down on these rolls that I'll have to leave my wife at home. I really wanted to try the wagyu roll and the j bomb roll. Some of the other spicy rolls looked interesting but being limited to what a coupon could purchase was annoying. I'll need to get up with my sushi buddy and try again."}
{"text":"This is my second time eating here. Definitely not amazing- there are much better Japanese places in the area. But overall service is really good. Food is just ok- entrees are kind of watery but tasty. Sushi is mediocre. But for the price not really worth it. Decent drink specials are present even with the limited drink menu. I'll come back but I cant ever see being impressed."}
{"text":"This place has become a favorite of mine over the last few years - in town frequently for business and Sky is across the street from my usual hotel. I've explored the hot entrees (Spicy Mongolian gets a thumbs up), but always come back to sushi! Seared Yellowtail is a must have and so is the Bang Bang Shrimp starter. One of the specials today was a Fiesta Roll with tuna, cucumber, and fresh salsa topped with yellowtail and lime, so yummy! Service is always a touch slow, but I like to enjoy a cocktail and take my time so it doesn't bother me."}
{"text":"Came for some sushi and found clear plastic inside tuna bowl. The service was really bad today. I'll seen people get their own water from the counter. It's not busy at all. Very disappointed here."}
{"text":"My parents live near and we decided to have lunch here. The atmosphere is a 10, the service was very good, the food was good as well we ordered basic Chinese dishes and all were tasty. If you don't compare the lettuce wraps to PF C's then they were good as well.  The serving sizes were generous. 

I would return and be more adventurous with my choices as they have a lot of options."}
{"text":"For the past two days, I have been eating sushi from this location while on a business trip. What I truly enjoyed was the chicken Lettuce wraps, and veggie tempura as an appetizer.The sushi tasted fresh and was made with TLC."}
{"text":"This is hands down my new favorite Sushi spot. Aside from it being literally down the street from my house, the ambiance is amazing. The \"kick ass TJ Sushi was bomb as well as the shrimp fried rice. Also my Purple Haze Martini was superb...I only needed one which is shocking for me. I'm usually a two drink girl. A must return"}
{"text":"The sushi here was very good. Headed out after Black Friday and was surprised to find the restaurant rather empty. Prices are reasonable for the quality and the addition of more traditional Asian dishes makes it a nice gathering place for those who may not eat sushi. The wine list is lower quality but the food doesn't beckon a higher quality wine offering so it's reasonable. My main suggestion is that they replace the plastic menus as it seems to lower the overall experience. The sushi stack was excellent."}
{"text":"I honestly wanted to like this place, my friends come here all the time and they recommended the place. I went in with high hopes and expectations due to the recommendation from friends and the high rating on Yelp.

The ambience was decent and the restaurant is open enough to not feel cramped. But, the service was subpar and the food was terrible. My girlfriend and I order a sashimi combination and a Korean beef BBQ (the beef was part of the restaurant week special). It took over an hour to get our food. By the time the food came to our table, the Korean beef is not sizzling anymore and it wasn't as hot as I expected. Not to mention the beef was extra salty, it was unbearable.

The combination of slow service and terrible food combined with pricing of a high-end restaurant making a second visit not worthwhile. I also forgot to mention that during the whole time I was there, the place was not busy (maybe half of the restaurant is filled)."}
{"text":"Tried this place on a Groupon.  I was very excited to try it because it is literally 2 minutes from my place and I love Asian cuisine and welcome any new restaurant in my neighborhood!  The decor and atmosphere were great.  Sat at the sushi bar with my daughter and we ordered sushi along with an appetizer.  Had the Crab Rangoon Dip.  The dip was just warm and was just your typical cheesy dip.. I hated the sweet sauce drizzled on the chips..we were so hungry so we picked through the chips to get the driest ones.. The sushi was very mediocre.. It lacked in flavor.  The food I'm general was a little pricey for such mediocre food.  I was really disappointed.  I won't be dining there again unless I go to the bar and have a drink and maybe try another appetizer because the sushi was a let down."}
{"text":"Even though I live a mile from Sky, I didn't even know it had opened (and that Tony Roma's had closed) til I saw their Groupon and tried to figure out where they were.  The fella and I ventured in on a Wednesday night - the evening of the great blizzard of '14 - and there were only a few cars in the parking lot.  Hmmm.

The atmosphere is nice and still has a little Tony Roma's feel, but the service was fast and efficient, and the prices seemed pretty reasonable.  I also appreciated the '80s adult contemporary soundtrack - Christopher Cross, Peter Cetera, and Air Supply are alive and well at Sky, and I loved it.

We started with the bang bang shrimp ($7), and I thought it was much better than Wan Fu's and pretty close to Bonefish, which is my favorite.  For dinner, I got the sweet and sour chicken ($10), and the fella - Mr. Sushi Snob - went out on a limb and got the Sky Roll ($13) and the Salmon Lovers Roll ($13) at the recommendation of all y'all who commented on how good their sushi was.  I braced myself for the inevitable monologue about how hard it is to find good sushi, and what do the Yelpers know, blah blah blah, but he actually really liked it!  This is as rare an occurrence as snow in Charlotte.  The s&s chicken was solid, but my favorite part was that the sauce came on the side instead of smothering the chicken like most places do it.  

For our appetizer, two entrees, and two glasses of wine, it was $60, which was much more reasonable with the $25 Groupon.  I hope the light traffic tonight was because of the snow, and I hope Sky does really well here!"}
{"text":"Came in 6:15 on Saturday on memorial day weekend, was pretty dead.  Had a couple young kids with wife and I, they gave us a perfect booth.  The service was just unbelievable, as attentive as a 5 star steakhouse.  Details including using rubber bands and a piece of paper to modify chopsticks so my kindergartner could use them, fast  drink delivery, and he expedited the kids meals so they could start eating a little early.  They even boxed the meals for us at the end.  
The food was solid, we had a sampling of sushi, chinese and the singapore curry noodles.  Prices were reasonable for what you got and Kirin pint draft priced right as well.  We tried this because of a groupon but will be back.  Excellent service, good atmosphere, good food reasonable prices"}
{"text":"Visited this establishment on 1/5/18 due to running across \"unlimited sushi and sliders\" on Groupon. This caught my attention as I have a massive appetite. The gist, for $20 a person, or $20 for a date with the Groupon, you get to choose from a very tasty and fresh assortment of everyday as well as special rolls very well prepared as well as deliciously deceiving sliders. You can also choose other items like potstickers, crab salad, and bang bang shrimp. The atmosphere is relaxed, food is fresh, price is fair, & overall this is a great place for yourself, a date night, or family outing. Definitely a recommendation. Just make sure you eat all the buns for the sliders or ask they serve the sliders without buns as the establishment does not want food wasted & will make you pay for it, which is only fair considering food costs money. Thanks for the experience."}
{"text":"Been there several times. Last time I had worst experience ever.  Recommend it to several Friends.  We were group of 6 with 5 kids on a Sunday.  Very poor service.  Server drop allthe drinks over 3 year old kid.  Ice tees, lce water it was a mess.  The lady in charge change server with the excuse that this one is new and not experienced.  So the new server a girl messed the whole order.  Kids where waiting for food.  Me I never received one.  We were waiting on food around 1 hour.  So I decide to talk with manager on duty.  So guess what there was no manager on duty.  I was told\"don't worry for today service we messed up but when you come next time we will hey you best server and a $50 off the total bill.  But today we can't do much.  So that was last time I went there.  Hope toy will not have same experience.  Food is good but service sucks."}
{"text":"I went to the \"Sushi Smackdown\" last night, presented by Savi Productions.
It was amazing! Hosts, chefs, wait staff and chefs were fantastic!
Each dish was beautifully presented and the unique taste of each item was sheer perfection!
I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Really gorgeous, just like the other reviews said.  Gorgeous bar - with tv perfectly lined up for viewing pleasure (the football game was on during the end of Panthers season  so that was a nice touch!). Great service - very peppy waiter that really wanted us to choose the right thing.
Just overall a great experience and we will be back."}
{"text":"Heading there again tonight; about my twelfth visit. I strongly prefer locally owned/managed places like this with family, or long term employees who \"care\" on staff. This place's parking lot should ALWAYS be full based on food and friendly/family service. Unfortunately their Sushi is marginal, but all other dishes we have had are of good quality, consistently well prepared, and presented; even when there with several other people. Atmosphere is comfortable, casual, and family-friendly."}
{"text":"Well the reviews scared me but we just ate and it was awesome! Sushi was good, my girlfriend got sesame chicken and said it was awesome. Sat at the bar and Cindy waited on us and the food came out fast, and beers were cheap and cold!"}
{"text":"Absolutely a horrible experience. We ate at Sky on a Friday night and there were only 2 other tables. This should of been our sign. We sit down and order our drinks as well as appetizers at the same time. 15 minutes later our appetizers come out and still no drinks. At this point we are a bit annoyed. Next, the food comes out along with the salads and soups we ordered which should of came out prior to our entrees. When our meal was over our waiter asked to high five everyone at our table. Completely unprofessional and not wanted. Lastly one of the couples at our table had a coupon of which had to be scanned from her phone so the waiter took her phone to the computer to do so. He comes back 10 minutes later and forgets her phone. The service was the worst I have ever experienced. I will NEVER be back and I will tell everyone I know to not waste their time."}
{"text":"This place is awful - and its so bad it even feels staged. Are we on \"punked\"?

We went in for lunch - no one in the entire place. We waited for 20 minutes to be seated while the entire waitstaff stared at us through the back kitchen (it was 12 on a Tuesday - they were absolutley open).

Once we got seated our waiter (male) - came over and did not crack a smile or speak a word. It was almost humorous. I think he grunted to take our order. It is understandable if his english was bad - but he was speaking english to the other waiter when he was away from our table. It was strange.

On top of all of that the food was bad. No taste - bland - blah!

This place will be gone in no time - when your service and food is bad - there is no hope!"}
{"text":"Loved how quite this place is and empty. Definitely a good spot for a first date.  Not the very best sushi I've had in my life, does not beat Bond St in NYC, but close to it.  The bang bang shrimp is so good, definitely order it, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place has an interesting concept. They do all you can eat sushi and Asian appetizers plus gourmet sliders! All of the food that I have had there was really good. The miso soup is good. I really liked their seaweed salad too. All of the sushi was fresh and made to order. They even offer specialty rolls such as the volcano roll. The sliders are quite good as well. The only complaint I have about them is the buns are too big for the size of the meat patty. Be careful how much you order as you are expected to eat everything or they may charge you for it. I can appreciate that as I see people wasting way too much food at buffets. 

This place is very classy inside especially for an Asian restaurant. The bar is very unique as it has a skylight. The service is fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Never again! 
Very pricey, little foods, rude services. 
I came here because viet-thai noodle closed from 3-5pm. The waiter was RUDE! He so rushed, but there was only us and another couple in there. We ordered our drinks and they have so much powders at bottle the glass. my Thai tea was disgusting plain, i tried to ignore but the powder really hurted my throat. my husband could not drink 2/4 bottom of his glass because it full of powder. I wanted to change my drink, they took it and another same one came out. thai tea has milk, so it had the dried milk cover on top of the cup. My husband ordered asian steak and the waiter threw it out frizzle on our white shirts, the table and he left brought my dragon sushi out. The sushi taste good but not the steak. My husband was so angry, it ruined out date.I can eat sushi in other places. We never come again! $50 for both of us! Thats pricey!"}
{"text":"We had the sushi. We've eaten at a lot of different sushi restaurants and this holds up against any if them. The rolls are huge. Fairly priced"}
{"text":"Good food.
Great selection.
Close to shopping.
This is a favorite for the relaxed atmosphere and quality food.
A keeper!"}
{"text":"The experience was generally good. Service was a little slow for as few people that appeared to be there. Lettuce wraps were good. Drinks were good (Long Island ice tea). The sushi was good (California roll deluxe). Dessert was good (chocolate lava cake). The only thing would have changed would've been the chicken in the Phoenix. I prefer all white meat."}
{"text":"Celebrating the birthday of da boss: Part One.  This place use to be a Tony Romas (if you folks remember that chain!), but is now an asian fusion restaurant and has been open since November 2013.  This is our 2nd time here and both times have been good experiences. 
The restaurant interior is nice and the lighting makes it a bit dark (4/5).  The seating seems a bit odd as there is a table in the center and booths around which seems like you are being watched.  I normally prefer table than booths but opted for the booth because of this. 
The service was great (5/5) and the waitress could answer questions we had about the pad thai.
The food was very good (4/5), and we had the pad thai, general tso chicken,  eel roll and seaweed salad,  and seafood miso ramen soup. Portions are large as well.  Everyone enjoyed their meals."}
{"text":"I saw all the ratings on yelp and had to try. It a very relaxing restaurant. It was a little empty during the day but that was fine with me. I'm pretty sure it is busy at night. The food was banging. I had 2 sushi rolls and my Mom had a Thai chicken with vegetables. We shared them. The staff is excellent and caring. This place is on point!"}
{"text":"I haven't written a one star review in a while. The place is ok, it's off Pineville mall and it's nicely situated to have good traffic. 

Server couldn't (or wouldn't) give us any recommendations and the food was sub-standard for a four-star Yelp establishment. I haven't seen this sort of disconnect in a while :(

Maybe I'll try to go again sometime in the near future and give it another try, but this recommendation was a a little off in my book."}
{"text":"What a hidden gem! From the statue of Buddha in the front of the restaurant to the lovely artwork under the skylight to the exquisite chandelier; I was just pleasantly shocked during my experience. The service was impeccable with a genuine interest in our orders and patiently explaining how to order from the menu. The food was extremely FRESH and flavorful!!! I thoroughly enjoyed lunch with my Sister and brother-in-law that I can't wait to go back!! The little mini burgers were sooo cute (and tasty too!). The sushi and salad were quite delectable and satisfying. Upon departure, I took a picture of the lovely artwork above the skylight and the picture of the vibrant chandelier in the foyer!! I love Sky Asian Bistro!! I could feel the humility within the service. I could see the attention to detail by how clean the floors, tables and walls were in the environment. Our server provided a very high caliber of service and puts the \"customer\" back in customer service with her warm professional service!!! She has a genuine smile and seemed grateful to serve us!! WOW!!!!!!

{"text":"Our server was most attentive and efficient! The atmosphere was cozy and the food was amazing!!"}
{"text":"Decent sushi with a limited list. Water does not taste good but overall good food. Nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"after hearing so much about sky, i wanted to try it. It was empty inside. A few other tables but only one server. Server seemed like she was pushing us out of the restaurant. Sushi was nothing great. It was decent. However one of our pieces of sushi had some discolored fish. Nigiri was nice. Sliders were ok. Seaweed salad wasn't good. Bathrooms were nasty. Decor was cute. Wouldn't recommend. Mr tokyo would be a better option."}
{"text":"Great place !! amazing crab cakes, tasty Chinese beer.Spicy Asian food.
Every thing is delicious.Real good food!!!"}
{"text":"Great chinese food. Reasonable prices. Hip atmosphere. Sky has become a regular in our family dining out rotation."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant! They have the best sushi I've ever consumed and I eat a lot of sushi!"}
{"text":"The ambiance here is really beautiful and cozy. The prices for the food were decent as well. However, most of the food tasted really bland to me. The calamari tasted very doughy and was cut into strips (they looked like French fries in a way) so there was not a lot a meat vs the breading. For dinner, I ordered the pad Thai ($11) and it had NO spice at all and hardly any flavor. My husband got the royal dish ($14) which was to come in a \"spicy garlic sauce\" and we felt that was bland as well (def not spicy or garlicky).  The food here wasn't exactly terrible; it was wasn't very flavorful either.  I can say the lava cake for dessert was pretty amazing ($6)."}
{"text":"There should really be a Zero star option. Bizarre place. I really wanted to try this place out and like it. Little did I know this was going to be like a flea market. Granted it's valentines day, I wanted my food to go. Got there at 7:07pm, was told about 20 min wait. Ok fine - no problem, I understand it's a busy night. Fast forward - 7:55. No food. While I was waiting this is what I observed. Their iPad with reservations went dead. Now people are crawling in with and without reservations and have to wait the SAME time. It looked like an ant farm there. The hostess was hollering for names as if she was at the auction. Who needs loud speaker?! Her receipts where all over the place. She then decided to ask everyone for their name all over again. Wow that should be fun for the guests! At 815 I was no longer hungry, but irritated. When I came up to ask about the status of my order she asks: \"What did you have again?\" - and proceeds to take down my order all over again claiming that's just for her to put it together. Say what?!?! Another 10 min later I asked for a refund. And guess what?! My order magically arrived. I refused it politely. I mean how long has it been sitting there?! No thanks. (Scratching this spot off my list)"}
{"text":"Great food and service. Never really busy. They make great martinis here. Kind of funny. I never thought an Asian restaurant would make a good martini."}
{"text":"I'm still a fan.....I got a Living Social deal for $12 for $25 and went last evening with Sweetie.

Tuna Fire Ball is the most interesting roll out there in the Queen City!!! OMG YOU HAVE TO TRY IT!!! Trust me, I'm an expert.  We tend to stick with what we like so That's how we Roll, Salmon Levers and something else were all excellent.  

The place was pretty full, and I know they have a Groupon, Living Social and Amazon Local deal going so I hope it keeps up.  This place rocks.  

One thing though, our waiter was obviously a smoker and reeked of cigarette smoke.  So much so that our glasses when he placed them down on the table also smelled like smoke.  I smelled it as soon as he placed them on the table.  GROSS.  I asked for new glasses and told him the deal.  He obviously didn't get the hint that he needed to wash his freakin hands since the new glasses smelled also.  I am willing to overlook this since I love the food so much but that only flys for so long, you know?"}
{"text":"I am a regular patron of this restaurant and consider it to have very good Asian food. But unfortunately today was the exception, The service was good atmosphere was pleasant. The food was absolutely horrible. Hot and sour soup, one of my favorites, had hard stuff in it. 
Hibachi chicken, usually very good, what's the worse. The chicken was very chewy and sauce was thick.
The flower shrimp was also poor. Shrimp was overcooked  and sauce was thick 
The red Thai curry with tofu was also poor 
Tofu was very spongy and tasteless dish
I did inform the waitress and she apologize and will let the manager know tomorrow.
I'm assuming part of the problem could've been the local weather, it has snowed the day before and maybe the cook did not show up for work anyway I will avoid this place for the next few months."}
{"text":"I love thus place.  Love Sushi and this is the best in town.  The $19 all you can eat Sushi and Sliders is a great deal.  Service first rate and food fabulous. I don't write many reviews so you can trust me on this one."}
{"text":"This food is beyond sorry!! I ordered the the bang bang shrimp and the Kick a$$ TJ roll. The bang bang shrimp is heavy on the Mayo and the shrimp is damn near popcorn and you get about 7 for $7. I couldn't eat it because the flavor was lack luster at best! And as for the kick ass TJ roll, more like I want to kick TJ in the a$$ roll. Sushi was very mushy and you have no idea what is what in the roll. I'm disgusted, save your hard earned money on something else!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I stumbled about Sky Asian Bistro about six months ago and are so glad we did!  This has quickly become our \"go to\" sushi spot and in my opinion has some of the freshest sushi in Charlotte.  Our favorite night is Tuesday sushi night when you can buy two rolls and get a third for free - great deal!  

Overall the staff are very friendly, the décor is very nice, and service has been good.  However the sushi is definitely what keeps us coming back!"}
{"text":"Just another chinese restaurant. Nothing fancy. Ordered the crispy chicken in japanese curry and the order came wrong. They gave us a small portion and then halfway through, the waiter came out with another plate of the dish saying that the cook prepared the wrong portion. What's funny or not-so-funny, is that the peas and carrots on this dish were the frozen stuff you can find in the supermarket freezer. C'mon! I can understand the peas but the carrots? Jeez! And we had phoenix and dragon which is two dishes that is chicken in sa cha sauce (so sweet that you can get diabetic attack) and curry shrimp (5 pieces) which is not bad but not great either. Another odd thing was that our food weren't served at the same time and have to wait at least 3 more min for the next dish to be served. Oh well anyway. Ask me if i'm going back to that place? A big fat NO!!!! I'd rather go to a chinese buffet. But then again I won't either."}
{"text":"I typically come here for lunch as they have one of the best lunch specials in the area. I typically go for the 2 roll and soup/salad combo. The sushi is fresh and traditional and they still have great quality at lunch. I have noticed some sushi spots will skimp on quality and quantity but not Sky"}
{"text":"I was very impressed with their Bang Bang shrimp, the lettuces underneath was a little wilted...probably because the shrimp was HOT. Either way the Bang Bang Shrimp was great, This was my 3rd time visiting Sky Bistro, A Friend recommended that purchase the Groupon for $10....still need to purchase it! 

Sushi.....I lovve Spicy tuna rolls, super yummy!!! My go to...... Spicy Tuna & Tempura Roll with a side of spicy mayo....AAAAAmazing! There is a lunch special for $10 for 2 rolls which also comes with salad and or soup....I always get the Miso soup. The Lunch Crowd during the week is small, meaning your wait time is short, maybe a 10min wait or less. 

Also they have a private room for small gatherings which is nice. I would recommend having a fixed menu or buffet. I attended a Birthday party here, with 2 waiters....all of our checks were incorrect. 

Cocktails are amazing! Great wine selection....This is my go-to place in Pineville for sushi, considering I work nearby this is a healthy option instead of grabbing fast food or mall food UGH!!!!!

Looking forward to spending my lunch breaks often......."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful time, the food was great,,we had the bang bang shrimp,,kode beef, pork belly, and the royal dish..very pleased overall.."}
{"text":"My best friend and I stumbled across this place after leaving Carolina Place Mall. I was shocked. The outside does the atmosphere, service and staff no justice. Great food and drinks!! We had a great time as well. The server was very friendly and had some great recommendations as it was out first time there. I own a non-profit and they also offer a private meeting room, with plenty of amenities. The interior and decor is very nice, that atmosphere is very relaxed, clean, polished and contemporary. Others complain about how dark the parking lot is, it could be brighter, but I mean who is going to get you the Sushi Zombie? Smh this is a great place, go and try them out!!"}
{"text":"We had lunch for the first time at Sky Asian Bistro. Beware of the all you can eat menu. If you do not eat every bit of what you order you will have additional charges. We ordered sliders and did not finish the bun and we were charged for it. This was our first visit and we're not told about the extra charge and thought it was rediculous 
. I can understand about not wasting food but a bun"}
{"text":"Excellent sushi here. It rivals some of the fancier uptown sushi restaurants. Always great."}
{"text":"A little below average. Chicken texture was rubbery and hibachi sauce tasted like honey mustard. Neon Lights and rave music was a bit awkward?"}
{"text":"Great experience tonight at Sky. We tried the Bang Bang Shrimp and Calamari as appetizers, which were both very good. They calamari wasn't all breading and very flavorful, something other sushi places have trouble with. Our dinner companions ordered the Pad Thai and Kung Pao Chicken, which they were both immensely pleased with. My husband and I split two sushi rolls, the sky roll and the dynamite roll. Both were amazing and very flavorful with fresh ingredients. Even the small side of fried rice we ordered was memorable. I hope more people get turned on to this spot because it was relatively empty on a Sunday night. The ambiance and service was also very inviting and above average. Definitely check out this great new spot!"}
{"text":"A friend and I ate dinner at Sky tonight and left impressed! The decor is inviting and laid back with good ambient lighting. We started with the server recommended appetizer of King crab with avocado sushi rolls. I'm not a big fan of sushi yet, so this was perfect for me to build my taste for it. It had a spicy creamy sauce on top that added nice pop. The only drawback was the price. At $15 it was too much for an appetizer, but it did come with 10 large pieces. For the entree I had the spicy Thai Red Curry with chicken and white rice. The portion size was large for $11. Definitely will have a nice lunch tomorrow. Everything was fresh and presented well. It came out perfectly cooked and hot. I wasn't sure what to expect as most curry I've had is more of a stewy sauce. This was not like that at all. It was balanced with the chicken and vegetables. More of a glaze, mildly spicy and nuanced. Very good. My friend had the Sweet and Spicy Thai Mango. It looked so colorful on the plate and had a unique sweet flavor. Also very good with enough to take home for lunch. Overall a great new Asian place. Great for a chill night out with the girls or date night."}
{"text":"Great food.  Staff is friendly and close to home what else can I say.  For a quick fix of sushi or ramen this is the place."}
{"text":"New sushi All You Can Eat lunch menu.  Well worth it for $13.  Includes Standard plus some specialty rolls, sliders, appetizers.  Fresh fish, not a ton of rice.  Quick service.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I was looking at reviews on yelp of a place to eat close by and came across this restaurant. The inside looked really nice and welcoming. The sushi we got was really good. It was buy 2 get 1 free sushi on tuesdays so that was a plus. Would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"I'm the Groupon Queen these days and I happened to stumble upon a Groupon for Sky Asian Bistro.  Before purchasing, I checked out the Yelp reviews and since most of the reviews were positive and the negative ones were mostly about service (as opposed to quality of food, cleanliness, etc) I decided to give it a whirl!

My husband, my 15 yo son, and I went in for lunch on Saturday.  The decor is nice, the restaurant is very clean, and we were greeted at the door by a hostess with a big smile.

We sat at a booth and our server came right over to take our drink order and to tell us about the March lunch special.  

We ordered Chicken Lettuce Wraps and Crab Rangoon Dip for appetizers. I didn't try the chicken lettuce wraps, but the guys really liked it.  I did (overindulge on) the Crab Rangoon dip and it was CRAZY good! 

For our entrees, my son had the Sesame Chicken, my husband had Chicken Pad Thai, and I had the Sky Burrito (Shrimp Tempura and veggies wrapped in rice paper served with Bang Bang sauce). We loved everything!   My husband travels quite a bit for his job and always makes a point to have Thai food while he is away and he always has Chicken Pad Thai.   He said that Sky's Pad Thai was some of the tastiest that he has ever had.  I had a bit and have to agree!   It's different from most places so it's possible that it's not as authentic as some places (I could see that turning some people off), but it was absolutely delicious and I know that my husband will want to go back just for the Pad Thai.  My son also had a great first impressions of Sky.  He adores Asian food and for as many Asian restaurants that have been to in the area, he declared this his new favorite...and a great place to take a date (UT OH!).

I really want to go out of my way to comment on the service.  I know that there are always some servers that are better/more friendly than others in every restaurant.  However, we had at least 3 different servers come to our table throughout our meal and they were all very friendly!  We even asked for different sauces, had a bunch of drink refills, and needed our food boxed and we never felt that the staff felt 'put out' by our requests.  At one point my husband engaged in discussion with our main server and it turned into a discussion regarding a particular custom that the waiter experienced as a child.  We loved hearing about it and could have chatting with him all day!  So...I recommend that if anyone is hesitant to try Sky because of the less-than-stellar service reviews, please know that we didn't see any service issues at all!

We had a chance to look at the lunch and dinner menus and I would suggest going for the lunch because the prices are nearly 50% less than dinner and it was a ton of food (we all brought half of our food home, including the Crab Rangoon Dip)."}
{"text":"I purchased the Groupon in hopes of finding a new \"go-to\" for asian food.  The reviews were mixed, but mostly positive so I felt confident enough to try.  

We went on a Wednesday evening.  The first thing we both noticed was how dark the front parking lot is, and how uneasy that made us feel.  It's dark and foreboding and makes it seem much more like a nightclub than a restaurant.  It also sits behind other buildings and off the main road so lighting is very necessary yet noticeably absent.  

We walk in and it's lovely.  The interior is pretty, though not at all \"asian\".  It looks much more \"cajun\" or \"beachy\" with the big bar at the entrance and all the plank wood floors and crisp white shuttered windows.  The flow of the interior was odd; again no feng shui like you'd expect from an \"asian\" inspired establishment.  Over the bar is a huge well lit gilded framed mermaid.?.  It's an interesting piece- but how exactly does that tie in to the bar inside an asian restaurant.  It was clean and inviting, but nothing made any sense or flowed together as you'd expect.

There was 1 table full of ladies near the door and 4 or 5 people at the bar and us.  That was it.  There were more employees than customers and the employees were not in any hurry to do anything.  Some even sat in chairs and just watched tv.  Our waiter (Joey) was the typical snarky, petulant, little gay server guy.  The type that thinks it's humorous to say a quick \"no.\" whenever you ask for anything and then laugh as if he's so witty.  I don't find that witty at all.  I didn't enjoy that when I was in junior high school and I certainly don't enjoy paying for it as an adult.  Joey left a lot to be desired.  He was slow and prickly at best.  If he's the best Sky has to offer, then they're really in trouble.  

Ok- so finally to the food.  We ordered the Inside Out Wonton dip for $9.  The first thing Joey said was \"do you like cream cheese?\"  I thought that was a negative comment to make and made us feel like maybe we'd chosen poorly.  How exactly does a comment like that help anyone?  It doesn't help me the customer feel confident in spending my $9 and it doesn't help Sky make a sale.  When the appetizer arrives, it's in a bowl along side a basket of fried wonton strips with sweet and sour sauce drizzled over them.?.  It was little broken pieces of wet sticky cold fried wontons that I'm supposed to be able to dip into hot, thick lobster dip??  The dip was good, but we had no real way of transporting it to our mouths because the little broken wonton strips kept breaking in the thick dip.  We even asked for more strips that were big enough to use, but by the time Joey brought them the dip was cold and no longer appetizing so no- I would not at all recommend the Inside Out Wonton Dip for $9. 

We were trying to get a base idea of the food so we ordered basic dishes that should be a good representation of their skills.  I ordered the Sky Stir Fry with chicken for $12 and my fella ordered beef and broccoli for $12.  Both dishes looked beautiful when they arrived, but both dishes only tasted so-so.  They also don't bother to tell you that only the white rice is free and that you pay an additional $1 for fried or brown rice.  (I expect to be advised of upcharges either on the menu itself or by my server - neither of those happened)  Our sweet teas were $2 each, which I always think is too high for tea. 

So in conclusion:  the inside of the building was pretty.  The service was slow and annoying.  The food is alright, but not amazing.  It's simply over priced for the experience you're getting.  I seriously doubt we'll go back.  Pei Wei outdoes this place hands down for half of the price."}
{"text":"Great service and great price along with great food!
Also great atmosphere sky thank you!"}
{"text":"Disappointed that they don't have the seafood combos on the menu anymore, but food and service are still great. The stir fry is a must try and sushi is always a definite."}
{"text":"Sky is on a long list of regular lunch joints for my colleagues and I. Although I'd say it's near the top of the list. I would probably never come by for dinner here simply because I live far enough away and have plenty of options closer to me.

Lots of lunch dish choices and you can get most of them for less than $10. When you get anything fried (general Tso's, sesame chicken, etc.) the fried outside usually has a good crunch to it. It's not soggy like these dishes can end up being at many other Chinese places. The long-short of it though is this is otherwise just your basic Chinese food served on a nice plate in a nicer restaurant with good décor and trendy music.

At lunch time they're pretty empty and the service isn't bad as a result. The staff tend to disappear though and take some time to come back and check on you. It is at least a more relaxed experience because of there being less people in the restaurant. They could stand to update/repair/landscape the exterior of the building a bit. And it would be nice to maybe check them out for dinner sometime."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night and it wasn't crazy busy. I got the Royal Dish which had chicken, shrimp, beef and scallops with veggies in a spicy garlic sauce with rice and it was good. It came sizzling to my table. My fiancé ordered the philly roll and he loved it. He said it was really fresh. Also ordered a egg roll, side salad with ginger dressing and a side of lo mein noodles. Egg roll was hot and good. Boyfriend liked the side salad and ginger dressing. Side of lo mein noodles is only $2. It was tossed with veggies and it was delicious. Overall, the food was good and I would definitely go back. Went again and got the shumai. Flavorful and loved it steamed. I also had the combo Lo mein noodles and it was so yummy! Sauce was delicious and tasted so good!!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately this place is huge which makes it look empty but the experience is great, especially with our waiter leading the show. You could tell he likes to guide people to what is fresh and delicious and he did that on this trip. The menu has every type of Asian food choices and sushi. He asked if he could bring us some sushi to start to earn our trust. He brought out white tiger roll which wasn't on the menu. Exquisite with shrimp, mango and white seaweed with a pair of sauces. Delicious. We also had the calamari which had a light tempura fry on it with Thai chili sauce, spot on. The bang bang shrimp was good but after that we just trusted our server with sushi choices. Next he asked us if we liked eel and we declined so he brought us out the Eptks roll minus the E for eel. Another night choice, smooth and creamy roll just melted in your mouth. After that we had a lobster tempura roll which was great with mango and then he brought a variety plate with a eye catching glowing blue  presentation which had white tuna sashimi  (best of the night) with red snapper and rainbow roll. With what looked like a slow Saturday night, I hope people find this place so we can keep going back. Thought the value was good with the plates he brought out averaging $2 per piece."}
{"text":"First visit. Ordered sushi lunch with added avocado roll. Rice was a tad hard in places but presentation was attractive and - most importantly - flavor was quite good. Isabel, my server, was quite pleasant, attentive, and patient when I told her I wasn't in a hurry. I never felt rushed and was allowed to relax. Ambience / background music was also decent. It's nice to find a sushi place open all day...a rarity in Charlotte. The only complaint is small in context. Sushi lunch prices, including hot saki, were reasonable and competitive. The only exception was a tasty but overpriced avocado roll, at $5.00. They usually go for $3-3.50 locally. Overall, though, a very enjoyable first visit."}
{"text":"I have been here twice and both times my experiences have been excellent in addition to the great food. My first visit consisted of trying out the bang bang shrimp and the beef skewers, which were both delicious. The second visit I tried the shrimp tempura and chicken wings and was very pleased with both of them. I'm looking forward to being a regular customer going forward."}
{"text":"I think the only reason why this place has 4 stars is because of the ambiance. The food is awful. I had the pad Thai which tasted extremely fishy (old shrimp) and the tempura shrimp roll was probably the most bland I've ever had. Edamame was NOT fresh. Horrible horrible horrible!"}
{"text":"Honestly, any restaurant that remembers your face and where \"your booth\" is and you come in on rare occasion definitely gets 5 stars from me. 

Every employee is delightful to talk to. The ambiance is superb- quiet, spread out, relaxing, intimate. There are seriously not enough words to describe it.

The sushi is to die for. It's always fresh. The lemon drop roll has become my favorite next to the summer shrimp roll, and the inside out crab rangoon appetizer is perfect \"feel good\" food.

When we want to venture closer to home for date night, we go here, hands down, no questions asked."}
{"text":"Chinese take out quality at best, maybe even worse. Will not be back, do not think my chicken was actually chicken. Sushi appetizer was the best part and it was not very good at all."}
{"text":"Went there last yesterday for dinner... And wow, this place is amazing! Super clean, great wait staff. My dad ordered the Singapore noodles and I ordered the stir fry. Both were great!! Entrees are large enough to share. I will be back very soon!!"}
{"text":"I wasn't sure what to expect of Sky Asian Bistro because the past reviews have been so mixed. I actually really enjoyed the sushi that I ordered and would absolutely go back. I tried three rolls because of their Tuesday promotion of buy two rolls, get one free. Who doesn't love free?

I tried the crunchy salmon roll, a rainbow roll, and the crispy mango tuna roll. All three rolls were really good, but seriously, the mango tuna roll was outstanding. I was still thinking about it a day later. As its name implies, it had mango and tuna, but it also had spicy mayo and a slice of lime. So good! They also have a pretty decent bar list with several options for sake."}
{"text":"Food: their lo mein was 6/10, their dynamite roll was 9/10. I was very impressed by their sushi roll. Their miso soup was a 2/10. It's a hit and miss with their foods.

Drink: their Bloody Mary was horrible. You could only taste the tomato juice and not the vodka at all. It tasted like great value tomato soup.

Overall: I wouldn't really recommend this place. My first time and it wasn't that bad but not a place I would tell family or friends to try/go to."}
{"text":"Food is very good, nice trendy atmosphere! New restaurant location with meeting space. Min food charge required for using meeting space is unreasonable. We wanted to use it for an after church social (and likely would have hit their min) but we couldn't confirm that... so they missed out. They used the space for side work instead. There loss. Side work could be done elsewhere and until you build your clientele use the room for small groups."}
{"text":"Very nice ambience, lighting and perfect music. Staff is really sweet and continuously kept asking about the service. We are vegetarian and face difficulty finding food of our choice everywhere we go. But this place had a lot of options to offer. Loved the Miso soup, vegetarian sushi with wasabi sauce and spicy red Thai curry . All tasted great . This place has been there for a while but is not known to many people because of its offbeat location."}
{"text":"My weekly schedule usually consist of several lunch appointments. If I'm responsible for the details, this is my secret spot! Not many of my friends have hear of this place, so I enjoy exposing them to the Sky!  Great atmosphere with great food. Their Sushi is top notch. Tuesdays is their buy 2 rolls & get 1 free. I will be surprised if this place stays a secret long.  I strongly recommend the \"inside out\" wonton dip, General Tso and the Pacific Fried roll."}
{"text":"Thai Basil Tofu used to be our favorite here - was not the same on our latest visit. Did not like the way the tofu is coated and fried - the texture and flavor was off - hope they figure this out.

Even my kids, who fight for the tofu in their fried rice, picked the tofu out and did not eat it."}
{"text":"Alrighty folks.  I cme here because I heard they have what they call a lava bowl which is what I'm used to as a scorpion bowl from the northeast.  Not only was the drink spot on served for 2 of course but the food was exceptional!  I would recommend all folks not only peeps from the northeast to come here and have a lava bowl.  Aka scorpion bowl.  Works for me!!

{"text":"We went at 6:30 on a Wednesday and it was pretty dead.  That should have been the second warning sign.  The first warning sign should have been the menu, which includes crab cakes.  I have a rule that when an Asian places tries to do American dishes, neither are usually very good.  The third warning sign should have been that the servers were whiter than I am.  Another rule I have is to not eat at an Asian place without Asian servers.  It's almost never good.  Had I followed my rules, I wouldn't have experienced this place and would have been better off.

The starter was Inside Out Wonton dip which is essentially deconstructed Crab Rangoon.  It was good, and probably the best part of the meal.  My wife ordered a Thai Iced Tea and it was the worst I ever had.  There was a funny taste to it, maybe they used instant tea for it.

My wife had sweet sour chicken which again had a funny taste to it.  My wife doesn't like the sauce so she didn't try it.  It also came with some pineapple, carrot and bell pepper piled on top.  The pineapple was clearly canned, the peppers and carrots were not cooked properly and they were cut unevenly so the presentation was not great.

I had the walnut chicken, which was OK but certainly not worth 14 dollars.  It had a decent amount of shrimp and they were cooked properly.  There was a very small amount of walnuts, though.  

Possibly the worst part of the meal was the sushi.  It was a tuna roll with tuna on top.  The tuna and avocado in the roll were OK but the tuna on top seemed like canned tuna.  It had an awful flavor."}
{"text":"Hidden Gem! I've seen this place a few times and never thought to venture in. I'm glad I finally made the decision to do it as the service was great and the food was delicious. The atmosphere was great too. We had sushi and all of it was great. We will definitely be back to try some of their authentic ramen and more sushi!"}
{"text":"This a great place to go when you want a solid meal. There aren't many dishes they execute that are sub par. It's a safe bet to order what you want. I enjoyed the all you can eat sushi for 19$. My girlfriend had the Singapore noodles which she loves!! With my girlfriend having a gluten allergy. They are very accommodating when it comes to gluten allergy. 
The draw back however is that service can suffer from time to time. As you will end up waiting to put your order in or get a drink. From my observations it is possible that our server last night had one too many tables. Once our server was caught up...Service was great!"}
{"text":"One of the worse sushi spots I been to ordered calamari and it was the worse I have ever had there was nothing fresh about it let the waiter know how bad it was and me and my wife got up and left and went to our usual spot o-ku I do not recommend this place to any one"}
{"text":"First place I found that has Ahi Poke. It is delicious. Lots of choices, good flavors, not soupy or salty. We had egg rolls, Poke, soup, general Tso and fried rice. All great. Beautiful atmosphere and nice bar. Must try. Also had Pad Tai. Great!"}
{"text":"I bought a groupon for this place after a few friends recommended it.  I treated 3 of my coworkers to the discount for lunch one day.

The place is located in the old Tony Roma's spot in Pineville,  They have a full bar as well as a sushi bar and two seating areas on either side of the restaurant.  '

The staff was really friendly and helpful.  We asked for recommendations and all of us went for recommended dishes - 3 of us went for the Royal Dish and another for the Basil Thai.

The Royal dish came out sizzling...think something on the lines of fajitas and consisted of proteins galore...tender beef, chicken, huge shrimp, and scallops along with veggies in a garlic sauce.  The sauce was a little spicy but the whole dish was very good and was worth the $14 price.  The only downside is most of us were not impressed with the scallops.  Ok, you're allowed one flaw...but just one.

The service was good but they were not busy.  Honestly, I think this is a bad location for a restaurant.  I think it's the reason the last place closed.  Unless you are taking the back way to/from the Centrum shopping center, there's really no way you would see it from Highway 51.

But still, I am planning to come back here with the dinner group for dinner in May.  Hopefully they will be busier then."}
{"text":"Their ayce option is amazing.  You get maki rolls, sliders sashimi, and appetizers.  Very very tasty, will try again"}
{"text":"The inside is so beautiful! Very pretty and a great atmosphere. They have a big menu and a wide rang of sushi to chose from. I had the teriyaki chicken with white rice and a spring roll. It was very good and I will be back again."}
