{"text":"food is good but so overratted. spent 180$ on few dishes that weren't that good. My boyfriend only loved the lamb, and I only liked the shrimps, but nothing much."}
{"text":"Average food but nice decor 

Great place to chill and have a drink but the food is not that great and it's very $$$$ I don't mind paying more but the food quality must be higher as well."}
{"text":"Superbe bistro chinois offrant beaucoup de choix. Les plats sont vraiment bons et les drinks aussi. J'ai bien hâte d'y retourner ."}
{"text":"I've been to this PF Chang's for lunch probably 15 times now. Every time is excellent. Consistency is key! 

Most important is the food, of course. And it's excellent. Every time. I've tried (and loved) all of the following:
APPETIZERS
- lemongrass chicken lettuce wraps 
- orange ginger edamame
- dynamite shrimp 
- ahi tartare with avocado 
- salt & pepper calamari 

DIM SUM
- all the dumplings but the lemongrass chicken ones, pan fried, are the best

ENTREES
- kung pao chicken
- Mongolian beef (mmmmmm!!!! My fave!)
- wok-charred beef
- crispy honey chicken
- firecracker chicken (the least exciting, despite its name) 

The decor is really great too; modern and clean. Very nice place for a business meeting or a date, and equally for an everyday-lunch (my case). 

They have lunch options that are smaller portions, but I'm a piggy and go for the full-size share plates and don't share. Makes it more expensive ($16-21) but I want it all to myself!! :) 

Please PLEASE save room for dessert, and share the fried bananas with someone. They're unbelievable, and they come with a big ol' scoop of pineapple/coconut ice cream. It's soooo good!!!!"}
{"text":"I went to this location for my daughters birthday. I was pleased with our choice. The atmosphere is classy and upscale. Their was plenty of seating options either at the bar, booths or tables. 

There was so many wonderful menu options. My children and I opted
For an appetizer and a main course with two sides of steamed rice. 

We tried the chicken dumplings and peanut sauce which was amazing and tasty. They come in a 6 or 9 options. Either fried or baked. I tried the fried chicken. They had pork and beef as well. 

As well we used Changs Chicken and steamed rice. The portion sizes and tasty was to die for. And the total with drinks bottomless, water and food was $45. 

I've never had such amazing service. The waiter kept seeing if we needed more drinks, how the food was. He was at our table at least 6 times during the evening. 

As well they brought my daughter a huge 5 layer chocolate cake with raspberry sauce, and fruit for her birthday free. 

They also have happy hour specials. The menu changes so it's either wine for $5 a glass and cocktails. Or menu items half price. The happy hour runs from 3 to 6 pm. Check it out as it's amazing !"}
{"text":"After getting a gift card I decided to go back and see if I would another experience, hopefully better than the previous one. I have to say that this time I did get service in English what I didn't get the last time I was there. The food was also much warmer this time around so I was happy about that.
But I have to admit that they still didn't win me over and this will be my last visit. For the price of plates the portion is too small for my taste. Also I ordered a caesar and what I got was a very tasteless and water down tomato juice.  
The Mongolian beef was again very good so that didn't change.
Not a place I will suggesting people to go that is for sure and if you ask me they are much better in the US"}
{"text":"If you like to pay more for the same quality food you'd get at any Chinese buffet, this place is for you. It's over-hyped and over-priced. It's not that the food is bad, it's just ordinary. If I had my eyes closed, I could have been anywhere; Fu Lam; mall food ourt... There was nothing that stood-out (except the price).

If you haven't gotten your fix yet, i suggest you go because they won't be around for
much longer. There is no mercy for sub-par chains in this city- too many good restaurants around."}
{"text":"I frequent PF Chang's in the United States & this was a totally different experience!  The food was not as good, the waiters were not as quick or knowledgeable and the bill was double the price!!!  From looking forward to this chain coming here, I got turned off of it and now I don't visit it even when I travel to the States!"}
{"text":"The same fast food as in the United States, clearly heated and served with a little garnish to show some kind of human involvement. Better off eating at a local Asian fusion place"}
{"text":"They changed the menu over a month ago and it's a nice surprise, with a good variety and everything looks delicious...I ended up with one of the lunch options, the beef pepper and I didn't not regret it! My friend took the chicken wings which were on the hot side but very tasty."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed their terrace and plenty to choose from gluten free menu. We went with the supper for 2 which comes with 2 soups of your choice, an entree to share, a main dish a choice of desert. 

The terrace was really nice and cosy, loved the banquet. Service was friendly, smiley, polite and efficient. 

We really enjoyed everything we ate. The chicken lettuce wrap is a must try as well as the mongolian beef. Everything was very tasty and the portions were perfect.

If you are GF make sure you let your server know before ordering and they will make sure to get you GF sauces.

60$ for 2. Pretty good deal for such a great meal, will sure go back."}
{"text":"J'ai aimé les crevettes avec la noix caramélisé, exquise. Endroit tranquille avec bonne musique."}
{"text":"I just want to shout out to the PF Changs employee at corporate office for completely changing my mind about this place.

June 28, 2013, I was celebrating my birthday without even knowing it. My husband had planned a surprise party for me and I was...well shocked. I was shocked at how many people showed up and then further shocked by how horrible everything was. The service, the management, the food, just everything. 

We show up and our table was not ready, that is fine. That is partially our fault apparently. My husband had booked for 10 people and it ended up being 14. He called ahead to change the reservation and they told him no problem. Apparently, it was a problem.  So now we are waiting for our table and we are getting tired of standing around, the bar was full (keep in mind the place had been open exactly 18 days so everyone was flocking there). I was leaning on one of the tables in the front when a pink haired hostess asked me to stop leaning on it. I kindly (not so) told her I'd be glad to not lean on it when I was seated. She left me alone.

Finally we are led to a table that was probably intended for 8 people and we are now 14. The manager asked us if we'd be willing to split our party up to be seated more comfortably. Uh no. I don't think it makes sense that half of us would be sitting on one side of PF's while the rest were on the other. We asked if they could put an extra table at the end of our current table. We were told, \"It is what it is\" by the manager who walked away.

The waitress and waiter we had were inexperienced in their menu to say the least. We ended up with a pure francophone who didn't understand what we were ordering even when ordering it. The food kept coming to us wrong and it was super salty. 

By the end of the night the entire group had enough of the wrong dishes, bad service, rude comments by management and whatever else could have possibly gone wrong. We had all sworn off PF's. 

Next morning I get a call (okay my husand got the call and I answered his phone) from PF's telling us that one of our bills was partially unpaid. That money wasn't in the holder. BULLCRAP. Most of the people in our group either own their own resto or have been working at one for a long time and wouldn't do that. Unbelievable. I asked the waitress (she is the one who called) what would she have done had someone not paid that DIDN'T have a reservation? That was the only way they knew how to call us back. She indicated which person in our group it was and I scoffed. I asked to speak to a manager and was informed I'd be called back later.

Apparently later meant NEVER. I posted my dissatification on FB and I got a message back to send my phone number via email. I got a call from Tanya who listened to me and kept on apologizing for the mistakes made by the staff. She was so kind and caring and wanted to make things right.

She ended up giving me a gift certificate to try the location again whenever I wanted. I told her that I didn't want them to give me free stuff, I just wanted someone to apologize for the bad service and treatment. I had sworn off PF's and so did another 13 people. She mailed me the gift card anyway and I promised I'd wait until much later to try it. I didn't want to get stuck on a crowded night again.

A while before Christmas, on a random Tuesday, I took my mom and sister. We all thoroughly enjoyed the food, the service, and even the menu recommendation by the waiter. It was a complete turn around. I was shocked that everything went so smoothly given the last experience there and I was even more shocked my mom agreed to go out for Chinese. I had no idea she liked it until that Tuesday!

I even learned my lesson, don't try a restaurant on their first few days open and if you do, be prepared for some mishaps. I also hope that PF's learned a lesson in how NOT to manage a restaurant (I'm talking to you Laval manager) and how TO regain customer confidence (that's for you Tanya!). The customer isn't always right, but in this case we were!"}
{"text":"Was absolutely not impressed with the menu nor the food.

My husband and I went an evening and got their menu for 2. Food was ok, but not in great quantity. We would not have paid full price for anything we had. We can have chinese food of greater quality and better taste for less money in Ste-Thérèse, at the Jardin Lee on Turgeon."}
{"text":"Arrived at 5:50 on a Friday with an estimated wait time of close to an hour we were lucky to get a place at the bar. The bartender was great and seemed to know the menu but that's when things went downhill. Very expensive for Chinese. 

We ordered (I went for the Mongolian beef) an hour and fifteen minutes later, we still had no food after repeatedly asking. The couple next to us at the bar had also been waiting. They arrived 10 minutes after us and she had ordered the same dish as me. Guess what, her dish came out but we still had no food. Really?

Won't ever go back, If this had been a PF chang's in the States, the manager would be fired. We won't be going back."}
{"text":"Been looking forward to visiting this resto in the Laval location with several friends since it was announced.

Esthetically the place is very chic and warm.

Visited the resto during lunch on a Tuesday and we ordered our respective meals quickly and efficiently. Our server Daniel was great. Super friendly and had plenty of time to chit chat with us. I had their Mongolian beef and it was DELICIOUS. I recommend this meal to anyone. Not spicy at all but will provide you a party of flavor in your mouth.

Visited the site mere days later for a Saturday Night at 7 PM and it truly felt like I walked into a different resto. Firstly, their location makes parking a nightmare. I didn't opt for their valet parking which led me to look for parking for a quarter of an hour and a 10 minute walk. The next time, I'm definitely going to be taking their valet option for a few bucks.

We made reservations for 6 at 7. They called earlier in the day to confirm. All was swell. We get there at 6:50, we're all there only to be given a pager and informed that they will page us when our \"reservation\" is ready. 

Ridiculous.

Why accept and confirm reservations when you can't respect them?

The pager rang at 7:25. So with a reservation, all present, we needed to wait 30 minutes.

Great start!

Moving on...

We sit down and the service we got was definitely not Daniel quality of a few mere days earlier as we waited on our waitress for a duration of close of 3+ hours. 

Firstly, we didn't get a chance to place our orders as she completely forgot about us for nearly 40 minutes after being sat down.

We did eventually order and my friend and I shared some warm sake which was a delightful experience and the spring rolls were good. Not great, good.

I ordered the KUNG PAO chicken (marked spicy) and it was somewhat spicy. Tasty but no where close as good as the Mongolian beef. However, it was still well worth it.

But before I got to eat all of this, we had to wait another hour.

So let's recap this. 

Walked in at 6:50, sat down at 7:25. Ordered at 8:20, got our food at 9:15.

Did I mention we were STARVING?

They tried to make amends with us by providing the 6 of us a free plate of their cheapest appetizers. Of all the options we could have been provided we got the steamed green peas. MEH.

Once our dinner was done, we ordered their famous \"GREAT WALL OF CHINA\" cake. It was decent. Nothing 'great' however. :)

All in all, if my visit was limited to the Saturday night experience I'd have given a worse score to this resto. However, if I were to go back, it wouldn't be on a Friday or Saturday night and limited to the day where hopefully I'd get some level of service as the food in general was good. The mongolian beef resigning supreme.

Kindly note that the plates tend to be kind of pricy."}
{"text":"It was excellent. This is my second time eating there, The shrimp pad thai, the singapore noodles, the dynamite shrimps, the sushi. Everything was perfect, the wait time was a bit long and the waiter got mistaken when we ordered, she thought we ordered chicken padthai when we clearly stated shrimps but quickly changed it. Overall, I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Après avoir entendu que le PF ouvrait leurs portes à Montréal et Laval, j'avais tellement hâte de l'essayer. Quelle déception!!! Mon conjoint a choisi son incontournable, le général tao, et j'ai pris le poulet au caramel. Nous avons également partagé des entrés de calmars poivre et sel (beaucoup trop salés) et des dumpling aux arachides (très peu goûteux). Par rapport à la nourriture, tout était \"beuh\".... rien de spécial. Je m'attendais à tant. Je suis déçu du resto et je suis déçu d'être déçu. À moins d'y être obligé, plus jamais, tant de meilleur option à montréal et Laval. Une étoile pour l'effort d'avoir pénétré le marché montréalais et une étoile pour le décor."}
{"text":"Ohhh PF Chang's you try to be so cool yet I think you can find better asian food.  Came here with a group of work friends and I've had PF in the states but have never been a fan.  I'd rather visit an asian restaurant run by a small family not a corporation!  

Let me give you the lowdown:

Ambiance 4/5
Decor 4/5
Cleanliness 5/5 (it's not even 6 months old!)
Parking 4/5  (lots of spaces at Carrefour Laval!)

Dinner:

-  Chicken lettuce wraps 4/5 but dropping to a 3/5 as there was not enough lettuce provided.  
-  Calamari 1/5..... seriously I'm sure you can buy as good if not better calamari in the freezer section of Costco!  
- Won ton soup 0/5 okay seriously I'm biased as I had my Chinese grandmother pass down her won ton soup recipe to me.  Probably the worst I've ever had!!!
- Tuna Tataki- 3/5  5 sliver sliced pieces of ahi served with a salad!  You'd think you need a laser to cut tuna so thin! A huge peeve of mine of restaurants.
- Mixed lo mien 2/5  Looked so promising when it came out but Eeeeeeek was it ever S-A-L-T-Y!  Also you could sense that the shrimp tasted as it was just dethawed 5 min before!  

I do commend PF for having a gluten free menu.  Also there are many many menu choices so you can find something you may like.  

Not my cup of tea!"}
{"text":"Way too salty. Decor and service was excellent and is the only reason why they get a star because food was horrible. Considering the price, you have better options elsewhere."}
{"text":"Un très très bon restaurant asiatique. Les aliments sont soignés et de qualité. Cela se voit qu'un grand chef est derrière les fourneaux en cuisine. Le service est rapide et la décoration est digne d'un grand restaurant. La carte est très fournie (peut être un peu trop). J'ai pour ma part opté pour un bol (menu du midi) poulet au miel et riz blanc avec une entrée calamars frits et sauce citron. Le seul bémol fût le prix trop élevé à mon goût d'où mon 4 étoiles. J'y retournerais cependant car pour le moment, c'est le meilleur restaurant asiatique que j'ai pu essayer."}
{"text":"Bonne quantité pour le prix, très bonne nourriture. J'y ai fait plusieurs découverte. Je ne sais pas pour le avant, certains disent qu'avant il y à avait de plus grandes assiettes, un petit spectacle à la table et que c'est mieux dans ceux aux états unis. Je ne connais pas les autres mais pour moi, J'ai bien aimé et j'y retourne."}
