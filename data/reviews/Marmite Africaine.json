{"text":"C'est excellent ! Surtout le poulet (l'assaisonnement c'est très bien fait). Et les sauces sont faites avec la même saveur qu'au pays. Je vous recommande vivement si vous avez envie de sensations ouest africaines."}
{"text":"Really great food - good chicken, fresh veggies, delicious juicy rice! The service was also great, and this is definitely a spot to check out if you're in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Bien que la nourriture était bonne et le menu intéressant,  le service laissait grandement à desirer...  Somme toute une bien mauvaise expérience."}
{"text":"Not bad! My grandmother actually recommended this place to me and we went for dinner on a Wednesday night.   The menu is kinda small. No desserts or alcoholic drinks. It's really just the main meal and a side dish. Everything is cheap, nothing is more than 25$ a plate.   I decided to get the 1/4 chicken with fries and my grandmother got the chicken skewer with fries. We also added a side order of banana plantain for 5$.  My chicken was seasoned in a way that I didn't feel the burn coming until after I was done eating. It snuck up on me and my eyes wouldn't stop watering even after I had finished eating. It was still very good. I was really impressed with their fries surprisingly! They were really crisp and fresh. The banana plantain was also delicious. I wish I had had more room to eat them.  Portions are a bit big so if you're a light eater get a plate to share.   The food took a long time to arrive so make sure to plan accordingly. Don't show up ravenous expecting your meal to get there in 10 minutes. It took about 35-40 minutes to arrive. At the end of the meal the waitress told us that next time we should order in advance and they will call us when it's ready and we can show up. Not a horrible solution.   Service is nonexistent though. The waitress only came by twice. To take our order and then to serve us our order. When you're done you ring the bell at the cash register and they make you pay. At least she was nice.   The restaurant itself is small but not crowded. They are all medium high chairs which isn't the most comfortable but manageable. Next time we plan on picking a table with chairs that aren't high (there's only one). They don't play any music so it can get quite quiet. We were there with 3 other parties but halfway through the meal we were done to one party and us. You could really feel the emptiness. No one else came to eat so it was just us till the end.   It's worth a try if you're in the neighbourhood and feel like a little something different."}
