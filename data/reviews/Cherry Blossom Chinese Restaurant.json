{"text":"Second time I had there food because they're like the only ppl who deliver around here. WORST FOOD. The lo mein is good though"}
{"text":"WOOOOO! Snap'into'a'sparerib!   The newspaper clipping with a photo of the former and much younger Ric Flair posing for a pic with the owners of this shop on the wall gave us something to read while waiting for our takeout order.  They provide excellent reading light - it's damn bright in there.  We also spotted a board advertising they had received the award for top 100 Chinese restaurants, Um? Who judges these things? And then again what year?   They have a few tables inside the VERY small restaurant. Few=three. They also deliver.   While I am a sucker for a mom & pop shop which this one seems to be, I don't know bout this one.   I'll make this short and include photos. If the food taste half as good as the pictures look , we would have been pleased.   When the spare rib bag was torn open, we thought they looked delicious. Not so much. They were actually very, very dry and tough as if they had been reheated 100 times (hence my opening line).Same goes for the appetizer of roast pork. If you can believe, it was even more dry then those spare ribs.That appetizer hardly deserves to be mentioned but I have a photo, so I had to.   The fried dumplings also looked good. Little dough covering the (small amount) of pork filling. The dipping sauce had no flavor AT ALL. That sucks, that's the best part of those things, the sauce!   The shrimp fried rice looked pretty good with green peas and carrots thrown in. Poor little puny shrimp. Not only were they small, they were mushy. They never stood a chance. The photo shows the size of the shrimp compared to a cute little pea (they must have changed quality since their website photo was taken).   The lo mein was meh. I had the house special. Includes (sparingly) shrimp (poor baby's) and chicken and some fatty beef.   They do seem to have a number of tofu choices so if that's your thing you might have better luck.   My boyfriend and I both agree, nothing stood out enough for us to make a second visit.   NOPE. Not even the photo of Ric Flair. WOOOOO!"}
{"text":"I stopped by the Malaysian place a few shops down but they were closed. Disappointed and hit by a craving for Chinese food, I decided to give them a try by ordering a black pepper beef dish and twice cooked pork. HUGE MISTAKE.   The dishes had almost no meat at all. There were only bits of \"beef\" (the largest was about the size of a dime, no kidding) in the black pepper steak. Same story with the \"pork\". The sauces in both weren't even tasty and was just plain salty. I have never been so angry with myself for wasting $20 on a takeout dinner.   Should have checked out the consistent bad reviews about this place before even walking in. They are a disgrace to the other Chinese takeouts/restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"I've been looking for a decent Chinese restaurant since moving to Charlotte 6 months ago and I think I've found it!!! Good food, quick service & polite people!   I ordered the Mongolian beef lunch special not realizing it's spicy as it wasn't listed as such on the menu I saw, however, I brought this to their attention and the owner remade my order fresh without spice!! He was very polite and did not ask that I pay for what was ultimately a failure in communication. However, because of his service I will return!!   The food was fabulous and was made differently then I've seen before with mostly carrots & onions, but it was delicious!! I would strongly recommend this place for a quick authentic Chinese place!"}
{"text":"Unless you have the stomach of a two-year-old, you'll leave Cherry Blossom feeling even hungrier than before. Insultingly tiny portions, very poor quality, and high prices make this restaurant one to skip."}
{"text":"This place is soo good I eat the sesame chicken here all the time. They're so flavorful and delicious. Their customer satisfaction is amazing. They are so good"}
{"text":"The place is a hole....bad food and rude people.  I got the \"healthy\" string beans...they were covered in a globby sauce and were seriously overcooked.  Tasteless.   My husband got the Kun Bo chicken.  Exactly the same sauce and I don't think we every saw any chicken in it.  Go somewhere else."}
{"text":"We've gone the takeout route with Cherry Blossom a few times, but this most recent time will probably be the last time.  Small portions.  Overcooked won tons.  1 shrimp in my house combo lo-mein.  Rude service both on the phone and when I picked it up.  Egg drop soup and the entrees were OK, but not great.  When in the same part of town and you're craving Chinese takeout, try Chi Thai in the Arboretum Harris Teeter.  Fast, friendly, and overall a better value in the same shopping complex.  Disappointed."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since the late 90's early 2000! Amazing lunch special, fast, and great food. I LOVE their Hunan Chicken, I still crave even though there are million restaurants here in NYC!    The first place I goto in CLT for food is Cherry Blossom, THATS how awesome they are!"}
{"text":"Good chinese delivery. Quick, hot, lots of flavor. I'd recommend they use a bit less salt, as some of the dishes had a lot of it. Aside from that, good stuff."}
{"text":"Ordered Buddha's Delight and Hot Lovers Chicken. I get Buddha's Delight everywhere and this was nooooot delicious - too much sauce. Never tasted the Hot Lovers Chicken b/c we got Honey Chicken - ewwwww. Also ordered brown rice but it was really greasy."}
{"text":"This is a nice place to get Chinese food delivered from. I've had better and I've had worse, but the thing I like about this place is it's consistently good for a nice price."}
{"text":"The food was very bland and the chow mein was like wallpaper paste. This was more of a fast lunch place then a take out family meal place in my opinion. I gave it 2 stars as the service was prompt and so far I still have not found a Chinese Restaurant in Charlotte worth a repeat visit."}
{"text":"Sadly this may have been the worst Chinese food I have had. We recently moved to the area and have been missing out on some amazing Chinese. Ordered Cherry Blossom tonight, took about an hour and 15 minutes for delivery. Once it did arrive the food was bland, cold and all around not good. The white rice was hard and chewy. The $13 triple delight had little to no flavor. The beef was chewy and the shrimp tasted like nasty tap water. The sweet and sour chicken was soggy and cold. Teriyaki chicken was edible. I'll travel to Ming Fu from now on."}
{"text":"Won't be eating there again. Check out the restroom as a precursor to cleanliness, or the lack of. Needs a makeover."}
{"text":"This adds to the list of worst Chinese food in Charlotte. There is a serious lack of great Chinese food here. Not only that, the lady who answers the phone rushes you off the phone. I ordered chow mein expecting pan fried noodle ( oh, you know like any other Asian restaurant in the US) and they give me a sloppy blog  of cabbage mush.  When I called them about it they did not apologize or offer anything to make it up, all they told me was I get what I order and if I wanted noodles I should of asked for lo mein. Hmmmm. Lo mein is just a different TYPE of noodle.  ****I do not believe any 5stars here . especially those with their brand name picture! I suspect they use their family.members or friends to give them 5 stars! They lost a customer and I hope they change their customer service and menu***********"}
{"text":"CHERRY BLOSSOM IS BACK! I went to Cherry Blossom recently after a LONG hiatus (due to a few bad experiences as I think they were trying new cooks)...now they definitely have a solid kitchen again and are back in the normal swing of things. I tried the Orange Chicken, Chicken Lo Mein, and Kung Pao Chicken & Shrimp. Both delicious and in decent sized portions. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Took a long time for delivery.Food was poor at best.Called to let them know,maybe a bad night,. first time ordering from them. Was hung up on $.30.00 down the drain .I have been eating chinese for thirty years.so beware."}
{"text":"This was absolutely the WORST chinese food I have ever had!  We ordered the sesame chicken, bourbon chicken, terriaki chicken, and mongolian beef.  The sesame chicken was the only chicken that was decent - not delicious.  I was soooo disappointed with the bourbon chicken.  It was overcooked, dry and tasteless!  The rice was also over cooked - hard.  the broccoli was raw!  I've never had food this bad before, and definitely will not be giving them any more of my business."}
{"text":"I had the Black Pepper Chicken and a side of steamed dumplings this evening. SO GOOD. It's hard to beat dumplings but the chicken was excellent. Guy at the front was very friendly. We chatted for a bit about a trip I had just taken to Asheville. Would recommend going here."}
{"text":"Terrible. Food was flavorless and we had multiple dishes that we ordered to try. Worse than Chinese food at the mall. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"My go to for Chinesse.  I get the shrimp fried rice all of the time.  The sweet and sour chicken is great also.  The customer service isn't the best, but because I am a frequent customer I get treated a little better. The owners are a sweet couple, just have to get to know them."}
{"text":"I received a flier in the mail about this place and I did something unusual --I actually ordered from here instead of throwing the SPAM in the trash.  I ordered my typical benchmark, Kung-Pao-Chicken, and a couple of other entrees.  I was really surprised with what I got.  Instead of the typical American-Chinese, it was a bit different.  The Kung-Pao-Chicken was chicken (obviously), in a brown sauce, somewhat sweet, with mushrooms and a couple of peppers --and of course, peanuts.  Though it didn't look like the usual Kung-Pao dish, it was actually really good!  One thing I did find pretty amusing was with the rice!  Just like most places you get steamed rice with the meal.  While ordering on the phone I asked if I could get brown rice instead of white, and she replied \"yes, yes you can\".  Brown rice wasn't on the menu so I thought 'hmm, great --I just needed to ask!'.  Meanwhile, back at the ranch after picking up the Chinese food, we discovered the 'brown' rice!  The rice was simply steamed white rice fried up with some soy sauce...  --to their credit, the rice was brown :)  The restaurant/store was pretty tricky to find --in fact, if they hadn't have told me it was by the Pizza Hut when I ordered I probably would have spent 5 minutes trying to find it --though I never claimed I was able to find anything quickly so take that with a pinch of salt.  Inside was nice and clean, and workers pleasant and polite.  I felt the price was a bit on the high side being as it was just a typical Chinese joint.  The typical entree ranged from $9-$11 per entree.  Now I've exercised my benchmark; I'm looking forward to going back and trying other dishes."}
{"text":"Hot and sour soup was pretty much just broth, hardly any tofu or other ingredients.... Person taking phone order was rude."}
{"text":"Disappointed. I've been here a few times. I've eaten in and tried delivery. It's usually good or ok. I have never had a bad experience until today. I put in an order for delivery. I'm generally a very laid back and easygoing person, so I gave the driver a decent tip even after he arrived later the expected (and quoted) 45 mins. Hey, he was friendly. Anyhow, my lunch portion of chicken and cashew nuts was laughable. So much so, I decided to login to my Yelp account to write up a review...which is rare for me. At first glance, the meal didn't look too good so instead of digging in I decided to dissect it. There were 34 mushrooms in my lunch-sized meal, along with 5 pieces of chicken...and not the round chucks of chicken either. There were 5 slithers of chicken that were equilavent to or smaller than the cashew nuts. No joke. Maybe today was an off day for Cherry Blossom. Idk. But I'm being generous in saying that I received 5 pieces of chicken when they were more like chicken scraps. Unfortunately, I won't risk this happening again. Our relationship is over. Guess I'll find something else to eat after I eat a few bites of my mushrooms and rice."}
{"text":"Worst Chinese I've ever had. Lets be clear here, my girlfriend and I are both college students, Chinese food is our main food of choice. We both decided to go in and dine there yesterday and we regret it fully. We go in and order at the counter and get dine in. Shortly after as we are sitting there in the cheap decor, cheap tables, cheap uncomfortable seats the sever/possible owner brings our food out to us. I got the sesame chicken which looked weird and my girlfriend received the chicken and cashews dish which was made up of 90% mushrooms and the rest being very tiny pieces of chicken. Neither one of us likes mushrooms to any degree but from the image we were shown we would have never know that the dish was made up of that. To continue on as we were sitting there a woman called the place asking where her delivery was. This according to me overhearing the conversation was the 4th time that she has called wondering where her order was because it had been an hour since she placed the order. The women working in the restaurant (possible owner) then began getting angry that she had called again and canceled the order for her and continued on to yell at the customer. This all went down as I was trying to eat my food, I honestly wanted to tell her to shut up.   Yes there is more and it gets worse..... The bad looking food, which was brought out on cheap paper plates was HORRIBLE... DISGUSTING... NASTY... etc. There are not enough words in the world to describe how badly it tasted.  The only piece of this experience that I enjoyed was the orange Fanta I got (because it was a standard closed can, it would be hard to screw that up)  I will not return to eat there, I will never order from there, and I advise everyone to refuse to go here for any reason what so ever. There are dozens of other chinese places in charlotte, order from them instead."}
{"text":"Big Disappointment. Won ton soup was oddly orange, and tasted like plastic. When we asked why it's orange, the owner said \"I've owned the restaurant for 30 years\". Well she said it's just food coloring. Nasty since no other place does that. She Just was being defensive. Lo mein was just average. I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"We got beef and broccoli, bbq spare ribs, shrimp lo mien and sweet and sour chicken. I was very disappointed in the food for the cost of it. The meats were all soggy and they honestly didn't resemble meat. The only good item was the bbq spare ribs but the we not worth the cost. They also had tons of fat. Shrimp lo mien was the worst I've ever had. There were onions and peppers with the sweet and sour chicken which I have never seen in a takeout and it just made the chicken soggy. I would not recommend this place. I've been to cheaper Chinese takeout restaurants and have had much better quality food."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years and they are the best Chinese in Charlotte! I usually get chicken and broccoli, general tso's chicken, and chicken fried rice. I have yet to be disappointed by this restaurant. They are super fast and the food is amazing! Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Not my favorite Chinese restaurant , went here because the place we originally wanted to go to was closed. We decided to dine in and our food was served on paper plate products , really?!?  Anyways I gave this place 2 stars because  The food was okay nothing worth coming back for, the food did it's purpose and did fill us up.  Too expensive for what you get in my opinion."}
{"text":"Place sucks. I've never had a horrible tasting chinese food until I had their food. Bourbon chicken is so bland, chicken is so dry. Mongolian beef is not mongolian beef at all! There's no beef, just carrots and onion and it was sooo spicy. it taste so bad. Also forgot to give us 2 rice for 2 entrees order. Horrible place. Take your money elsewhere."}
{"text":"Ok, I do like some Chinese food but this place is really just an overpriced, average tasting, Chinese restaurant. I've had the Orange chicken, hot & sour soup, vegetable fried rice and egg rolls (those tasted like they were fried in old oil). My wife couldn't eat them. Problem is that it's convenient. I need to be on the lookout for a new place."}
{"text":"Shrimp few in shrimp low mein and was not very tasty. Disappointing."}
{"text":"I was visiting a friend nearby and decided to pick up Chinese for dinner on a weekday. There were three adults, so we ordered three dishes (Mu shu pork, Gen Tao Chicken, and House Special/everything lo mein). We also ordered three egg rolls.  It wasn't terrible, but it definitely was not good. I would not return and would not recommend this place. For what we ordered and some extra sauce, and since it was takeout, I opted not tip, it was nearly $40! Chinese is supposed to be cheap, and tasty - this was neither.  Now, I appreciated that the lo mein wasn't greasy, but it also had zero flavor. I know all the meats and shrimp were frozen, so they should at least season it. It was bland. The mu shu was odd - it was mostly cabbage which is fine, but tasted like it had been cooked for a while. It was kind of mushy. The sauce for it was absolutely bizarre! It was the consistency of soy sauce, and was not good. Until now, I thought hoisin sauce was one thing you couldn't screw up... I normally eat 3-4 of these, but ate one and was done. That bad.  Egg rolls were ok, they're frozen, dumped in a fryer... not much to expect. They didn't include duck sauce, glad I asked... The chicken dish was fine. Nothing special, but not bad. Good flavor, not too spicy, but left me with heartburn all night. It was fast and ready when I arrived, but very expensive for what we got. I think my exact bill was $38 and change... I felt ripped off.   Save your $40 and go elsewhere. It it set up like a fast food counter, isn't nice and they're not friendly."}
{"text":"I'll never forget how I ordered food here one night last year. They have both spring rolls and egg rolls on the menu. I ordered spring rolls because, traditionally and in every other Chinese restaurant, spring rolls are vegetable based. This place puts pork into theirs. I only figured that out when I bit into it, and I am not allowed to have any pork at all. I felt incredibly sick. The owner, when I inquired about this, was disrespectful, kept saying \"that's how it is at cherry blossom! The other places are not cherry blossom!\"  While I understand that I shouldn't have assumed that the spring rolls didn't have pork in them (even though this is the first time I've seen them made like that) I feel like the owner could've made more of a customer service effort.  My personal experience with this place was not pleasant."}
{"text":"Real good Chinese I love it but one big problem real small portions."}
{"text":"Apparently we are the exception to the rule as my family really likes Cherry Blossom. It might be because we always get the same things: Sesame Chicken, General Tso's Chicken and Egg Rolls. These are not exactly the hardest things to make but we love the sauce and the taste. We especially love the egg rolls - including the spicy-ness of the pepper. It is very quick, reasonably priced, and consistent. My kids literally complain anywhere else we go to get Sesame Chicken. But they love this sauce. Maybe low expectations but we enjoy the food and that it never changes."}
{"text":"I really don't know why some people have given this place such bad reviews. Picky eaters maybe? I have tried Chinese food in NY, NJ and most places in Charlotte and this is one of the top Chinese places in my book. Fast delivery, food is great. This is more of a takeout/delivery place so don't expect 5 star restaurant treatment when you go for dine in. You will get paper plates and plastic utensils. By the way, you have to order the general tsao's wings and they usually have a coupon online."}
{"text":"Very Good spot, fast, tasty and good for takeout! Authentic items. Usually get Gen. Tso's, very good,  Not expensive and large portions."}
{"text":"I really tried but I came in today and ordered general t lunch combo and I had a lot of rice and about three tiny pieces of chicken. And the egg roll? Ekk! It was filled with pepper as if someone accidentally dumped a whole bottle of pepper and forgot to throw it away. Shame. And it's so close to home. Save money and go to Best Wok on Monroe"}
