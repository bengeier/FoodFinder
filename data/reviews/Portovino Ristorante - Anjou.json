{"text":"I came to this Portovino with a relatively large group (approximately 10 people), where we had made reservations for.  I had heard many good reviews about this restaurant, so I had pretty high expectations of the restaurant.  When I arrived at the restaurant, I was greeted and shown to the tables they (the employees) had prepared for us (which happened to be next to the staff area, where utensils, dishes, sinks, and other such things were stored, and also where employees hung around a lot if there weren't any customers nearby). My group and I had brought wine bottles to the restaurant. The menus were already laying on the tables when we got there, so the waitress and waiter didnt even greet us (it was the seating hostess who had shown us to our tables). We had to wait approximately 20-30 minutes before a waitress came to our tables to explain to us the items on the menus and to explain what was the specials of the day. I think that was a relatively long time to wait for a service at a restaurant for. When the waitress finally came, she explained to us what the menu had and what type of meats there were on the menu. But immediately after she explained those items, she wanted to start taking down our orders and what we wanted to eat, without letting us absorb what she ha just explained. Despite this, everyone made a decision on what they wanted to eat and ordered. The waitress took down our orders, finally opened our bottles of wine (after we asked the seating hostess long ago to get someone to open our wine bottles) and the waitress left. We never saw the waitress again until about 45-60 minutes later, which was when she was bringing our food. We were all starving because we had had a long day and after waiting an initial long period of time to order and another long time for the food, we just wanted to eat. We expected to see the waitress sometime in-between ordering and being served our food, to refill our glasses of water or to open out other bottles of wine but she never came at all. Whenever the waitress DID come, she was somewhat standoff-ish and cold and was not particularly courteous, but maybe she was tired after a long day of working or maybe she was having a bad day. But the service was extremely slow and unwelcoming. When we finally got our food, the majority of our food was cold or luke warm, and some of the people in my group had received their food partially uncooked and raw. The ambience of the restaurant was all wrong too. The music was too loud, the light were extremely dim and made the mood very dark and ominous.             Frankly, all in all, I was extremely underwhelmed and unimpressed. I think the only good thing about the restaurant was that desserts were fantastic! My first visit to Portivino was at this location and I left with a bad taste in my mouth about the restaurant, assuming that all Portovinos were like this one. Little did I know, that after speaking with a friend of mine (who's sibling works as a chef at another Portovino) told me that this Anjou Portovini is the worst of all the ones in Montreal and this Anjou location is supposed to close down in a short period of time because of overwhelming amount of complaints, bad reputation and bad services that they offer. After learning this, I gladly tried Portovino again but this time in Carrefour Laval. And to be honest, if I had gone to that one first, Portovino would have met and surpassed all my expectations that I had of this restaurant.  But frankly, this Anjou one is terrible. I am glad that it will close down."}
{"text":"Une fausse \"Fine cuisine italienne\" avec une nourriture souvent fade et non travaillé, et une service souvent trop familier. Rien de vraiment positif pour cette succursale. Pourtant le resto de Laval passe le test."}
{"text":"Bon resto mais pas exceptionnel , bon service mais cher pour la qualité des plats. L'ambiance était bonne quand même mais je pense pas y retourner."}
{"text":"Expensive, small portions and awfully long wait to be served.  Really not worth going to ever again.   Would not recommend."}
