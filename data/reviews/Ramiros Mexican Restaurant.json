{"text":"This place is like Russian Roulette. I always get the new breakfast burrito and want the bacon well-done but it always comes out like rubber and raw. Don't know what's going on this place was good a long time ago but now it sucks and I will never go back"}
{"text":"Awesome food!!  I feed a family of five for under $25!!  Highly recommend....."}
{"text":"Great food, best grilled chicken I have ever had.  Reasonable prices.  The staff is friendly and the place is always clean and presentable."}
{"text":"When I'm in the mood for good Mexican food I usually go to Ramiro's.  It's very much like a Filibertos but, somehow better.  I like the fact they will make just about anything I want, like a beef fajita burrito (when I go to this other place they want to charge me extra to do this).  The staff is friendly and helpful.  I usually get it to go because it's not a very big place and it's usually a little warm inside.  Also, there are times the tables need attention. This place is way better than fast food (taco bell) and just as fast in the food prep.  Not the greatest place but, reasonable, quick, and the food tastes good."}
{"text":"Fast service, very nice girl, good food. My new place to go for a Mexican fix. I only get the chimichanga, so I can only vouch for that, but its great. Much better than Caminero's that's down the road (I ate there thrice and got diarrhea all three times, and that NEVER happens to me)."}
{"text":"EAT HERE!    If my mexican mommy went out of town, I would miss her but not her cooking.    I would go to Ramiro's.  FOOD,  absolutely mouth watering, everything is fresh, delicious, tender NEVER OVER OR UNDER COOKED.   PORTIONS. I am a big boy, my wife having lived in the southwest for over 25 years a mexican food connosieur and my 6 year old a \"picky pants\".  Everyone one of us devours our food and theres always enough left over for a second meal. RESTARAUNT. Absolutely spotless, even when they're busy. STAFF.  Remember when you were treated like your business mattered and you were a friend of the owner?  Come here...you will feel it. PRICE. REDICULOUS.  I would pay more.  We can't get a bad meal here and I am embarassed I can't tell you the owners name.  We have even stopped on our way back home at closing \"jonesing for Ramiro's.....    No problem...made our food ...perfect..told us don't worry..we appreciate your business."}
{"text":"This was the filthiest restaurant that I have ever been in. The salsa bar was caked in old product. There had been there had been an old salad type items that had been there overnight. When I complained that it was filthy, she said oh yeah I was just going to clean, But she just wiped around it and left the old food in the containers. I was horrified. In addition, the floor and tables and garbage containers were also filthy. We should've left but had ordered already"}
{"text":"Great carne asada at this place. I'm a big fan of the California burrito which apparently is the same as the Arizona burrito I have at other places. The tortillas are very good here too.  I would also recommend the super nachos. Again with the carne asada on them you can't go wrong"}
{"text":"Quite happy with this find. Have driven past the location many times but finally decided to stop and give it a try a couple weeks ago. With a number of visits now I have some favorites but haven't worked my way through the menu. The Mexican breakfast burrito is quite good and very filling. A large breakfast burrito with chorizo, potatoes, etc. The regular burritos that I've tried so far have not let me down. Again quite large & filling. I tried one of the plate meals for take out.  It was good but better eaten there. I also tried the nachos on another visit. The regular nachos at $3.49 was a lot of food and heavy on the toppings rather than the chips. Guacamole was generic and not homemade, but everything else was good. Staff are very friendly and I was already a recognized \"regular\" on my second visit.  I suppose you might compare this to a Frederico's, but my sense is that they are trying to be their own family place, and not a copycat of anyone else. From my perspective this is a small treasure that the NW valley, and especially Peoria, is fortunate to have."}
{"text":"Good goto spot for rolled tacos.  Only place that adds carne  asada with cheese and guac"}
{"text":"Good vegetarian burro for the right price . Not on the menu though , ask for it with papas inside ...."}
{"text":"Food was just ok. Mexican food in Arizona sucks. Way better back in Chicago. The one good thing was the big portions of food you get. I won't be going back here though"}
{"text":"Our favorite breakfast burrito spot! Always fresh and delish! Awesome tortillas and the red and green sauce has lots of flavor- not watery like so many of the other joints. Breakfast burritos from Ramiros are our weekend tradition."}
{"text":"This is my go to mexican breakfast place! The size of their breakfast burritos compared to the price is unbeatable. I would give it 5 stars, however sometimes their breakfast burrito is heavily in need of more cheese, and instead makes the burrito dry with all the eggs/potatoes. An easy fix is just to add sauce to every bite, but it shouldn't have to be an option as a customer. Also it can be a tad greasy as well, but hey it's fast food mexican food as they have a drive thru...which is convenient!"}
{"text":"In my opinion, this is the best of this type drive through Mexican restaurant. We go quite often when drinking beers with friends close by for a nice big breakfast burrito. Don't expect a nice atmosphere or fine dining, this is meant to be fast food. Nice prices and go great with beers."}
{"text":"They usually have pretty good food but I don't understand how every time I go the price of the carne asada burrito and also other items on the menu changes. I just went yesterday and payed almost $10 for ONE burrito.?? Wth..."}
{"text":"Have been coming here for years with coworkers, asked for a cup for water with my meal & they said I have to pay for it!  We ordered 3 meals and you can't give us a cup for water?? Well we will never be back here again. Your 50 cent charge just cost you hundreds of dollars."}
{"text":"I recently had their breakfast burrito and was it really good.  Egg, ham, cheese, pico de gallo.  The thing was a monster.  It was filling enough for me to still be full at lunch time.  Combine the breakfast burrito with their red sauce and you have one heck of a meal.  Definitely worth going back again."}
{"text":"Food is excellent, especially the carne asada fries! We frequent this restaurant at least once a week...we are never disappointed. The staff is always friendly and courteous."}
{"text":"I usually don't give bad reviews but I couldn't keep quiet about this one. The story actually starts a few weeks back. My brother and I went through there drive through and ordered 2 carne asada burritos. We asked the girl of we could have the meat made crispy. She said it was too busy at the time but if we call ahead next time they could do it. Cool, no problem. So a couple weeks later my brother calls ahead likes she told us to. A guy answered the phone and told my brother it was too busy to take phone orders and just hangs up on him. My brother was pretty PO'd but I thought maybe my brother was rude or something.     A couple days later I thought I'd give it a try. I tried to call on my order but the first time she hello waited for maybe a second or two and \"click\". She hung up the phone. OK no big deal so far. I call back and she answers \"hello\" with an attitude. I asked her if I could place a phone order she says \"yeah\". I was like OK let me have 2 carne asada burritos with meat made  crispy. She says that she doesn't think they can do that. I asked her if she could find out. She says she'll write it on the ticket but the cooks probably won't want to do it. I'm getting pretty upset by this point because not only is she being difficult she's talking with an attitude the whole time. Finally she tells me the total and that it'll be ready in ten minutes. Ok.   When arrived I dealt with a short heavier set girl. I don't say that as an insult but for identification since she didn't have a name tag to identify her. Her greeting was simply \"are the guy that ordered the burritos\"? I said yes. Keep in mind that the whole time I'm there she's having a personal conversation on her cell phone. I pay for the food and she grabs the bag and hands it to me. I'm looking in the bag to make sure everything is in there. No salsa. I asked her if I could have some. (And I've been really nice this entire time by the way) She's got a whole tray of pre made green and red salsa sitting right next her. She looks at me annoyed since I further interrupted her conversation and points to the \"salsa bar\" and says you can serve yourself there. I looked at her like \"are you serious right now\" and she just rolled her eyes and sat down in a chair the have next to register and kept talking about her friend from Sonora who's have family issues. She to continue \"con el chisme\" I was like forget it I'm outta here. I was really close to telling her off but there was a really nice older couple in the dining room and and I didn't want to make a scene and ruin their dinner. So I just left.   Well I get home and my burrito doesn't have crispy meat. It want that they were too busy because the place was dead when I arrived to pick up my order except for that couple that I mentioned. She just didn't want to do it. I know they can because there done it before.    As far as the food goes it's not terrible but but it's good enough to deal with bad customer service. It's too bad I won't be back as long as that girl works there. She gives that restaurant a bad image. They need to get rid of her ASAP. I own a business and if any of my employees treated one of my paying customers the way she did she be fired on the spot.   I'm giving 2 stars because the food is decent but bad employees give me a bad taste in mouth."}
{"text":"I'm a pretty picky eater so it took me a while to give this place a try after driving by it so often and I'm glad I did! I only really get one thing every time; the super nachos. I didn't like guacamole until I had theirs which I am nearly 100% sure they make it fresh due to finding huge chunks on an avocado a few times. When I was on a low carb diet they were very accommodating by allowing me to get it without chips."}
{"text":"Went to the drive-through no one answered continue to pull through didn't see anybody in the restaurant I guess this place is closed down"}
{"text":"Definitely not the BEST hole in the wall Mexican food I have ever had but definitely VERY good.   I would recommend their breakfast burritos--egg, cheese, bacon, and ham--DELISH!  Carne asada burros are also good.  If you like hole in the wall mex... you love this place."}
{"text":"I've been back a few times purely out of geographical desperation.  The food is pretty bad all around.  My last burrito I couldn't finish half of.  The tortilla was all chewy and the the ingredients were no bueno.    The big girl at the front has the customer service skills of a thimble.    If I was a smart man I would open a taco shop within a 3 mile radius of this place and charge the people nearby that love this place camineros and top shelf 10 bucks for 3 bomb tacos and put all these whack \"Mexican\" joints out of business."}
{"text":"The previous 2 stars review  is  too generous and is on target.   Go through drive thru for dozen rolled tacos, adobada plate, chips  and salsa.  Asked for 6 green and 2 red sauce.Get home, no cheese or guacamole on our rolled tacos.  Really? No red sauce and only 2 green sauce ans they are half the size soufle cups vs. inside the store.  The food containers are also melted from  microwaving chips.   Drive back to store and politely ask for a new, fresh order.  They take the returned tacos, dump them in the fryer throw, cheese lettuce tomato still no guacamole. Wow, such arrogance to treat your customers disgracefully.   No apologies for the bad 1st order and told the skinny girl order taker dont pick your nose in front of customers.  Check out the pictures, they dont lie."}
{"text":"Wow this place has some of -if not the best breakfast burritos iv ever had. I got the \"new breakfast burrito\" and it was so fresh and delicious it even had bacon in it and didn't have that overwhelming saltiness to it like most other places. Very very good and affordable as well, was only able to eat half and I'm stufft! If ur craving some good breakfast come here(:"}
{"text":"This is my initial review based on lonely one visit.    I first passed this local on Saturday, hoping to get a breakfast burrito.  Seeing boarded up windows I assumed they were now closed.  As I found out on Sunday, I had mistaken the boarded windows for the wrong business.  Ramiro Mexican Restaurant is definitely not closed.  This is good news for me as I love Mexican food and I love it even more when it is only 400 meters from my home.  I dropped in on Sunday and had a classic Mexican breakfast Burrito (eggs, potatoes, chorizo and cheese).  it was very good, hot, fresh and was served by a very friendly cashier.  it was so big, I would consider asking them to cut back on the potatoes next time.    A big plus for me was that there was a salsa bar.  It had two red sauces, a green chile sauce, limes, cucumbers and pickled carrots, garlic, onions and jalapenos.  This was a nice touch to spice up the burrito.  The green Chile salsa was good, the smoky red one (chipotle?) was so so.  The pickled veggies were very good.  The site is clean with plenty of parking and a drive through. I will be back to see if they are more than a one hit wonder.  Update 4/20 - had a wonderful green Chile carnitas burrito - fantastic, earning an upgraded review. Also, much better horchata than my first visit. I am a very happy neighbor!!!"}
{"text":"I come here any time I need a quick fix for fish burritos that is close to home. I have never been disappointed with this place!"}
{"text":"We have heard lots of good things about this restaurant and decided to try it. We ordered two cheese enchilada meals, with beans and rice, a beef taco, a bean tostada, and a plain quesadilla. The beans on the tostada and in the meals were burnt. The quesadilla was heated on the grill, and was burnt. Everything else was good. The burnt food was not edible. Also, we  did not get a receipt. We called them. First, they said we couldn't have been there because we didn't have a receipt. Then we were told they were looking at the beans and they were not burnt. My wife explained she grew up working in her family's Mexican restaurant and she knows when beans are burnt. They finally said we could bring the food back and they would replace it. We explained we didn't want more beans because they were burnt. Then the lady said she talked to the manager and they would replace the quesadilla, reimburse us for the beans, and do nothing for the tostada. We decided it wasn't worth going back for a couple of dollars and a quesadilla we don't want. We won't go back. There are too many other Mexican restaurants in the area that serve good food and takes care of the customers."}
{"text":"Let me preface my review that it is solely based on the customer service received.  I am from California but in Arizona often, and came here through the drive through this morning for breakfast burritos, chips, and salsa.  I had read and heard of how one employee's lack of service was but I still had my own doubts.  The breakfast burritos were very large, tasty, and salsa very flavorful.   The drive through attendant, chubby Latin girl, her voice on the speaker lacked a smile and friendliness almost curt.  At the window, she was very curt, unfriendly, and had no positive outlook to her customers.  We waited an extended time and when she returned, there wasn't even a small friendly apology.  This business must understand the lack of Mexican food restaurants does not give her a rationale for a lack of customer service.  In this economy, the priority should be in quality customer service."}
{"text":"Delicious, fast service. We always go in to eat so don't know about drive thru. Sad they don't have Taco Tuesday anymore but it won't stop us from coming in. I usually don't like these little mom and pop places but this one is delicious, good customer service, fair prices and very clean."}
{"text":"I had been looking forward to coming here since I moved from New Mexico.  I saw all the reviews & I just KNEW it would be like I was back home. I ordered the green chile chicken burrito enchilada style & guacamole & my husband ordered the eggs & chorizo plate.  The sauce was so vinegary tasting & was loaded with cilantro, very bitter, so I was just eating the meat out of the burrito which was VERY tasty! At this point I was pretty bummed since I could tell this wasn't green chile that was used at all, halfway through I'm cutting into the tortilla to get the chicken out & I found a hair inside of it. They were very sweet & refunded my money as well as offered to make me something else but at that point I had lost my appetite. I know things like this happen but it still doesn't make it any less icky for me. My husband loved his meal so he will probably be back, but I can't say that I will.  Update 4/11/14 So the refund that the girl behind the counter was supposed to do was never done & it's been almost a month. Yeah, I'm def not going to be visiting this establishment again."}
{"text":"I've eaten here about 20 times,  so obviously it's been pretty good before, but my last two visits have been terrible. We ate there this evening, food was cold, really cold. We ordered enchiladas and they weren't even hot enough to melt the cheese. The beans were so cold  I would've thought they weren't even on the warmer, had they been anything but beans it would've been a health hazard, which sucks because I think if they had been hot they would've been really good.  And to top it off they were out of Horchata.    Our previous trip was nothing better than mediocre, but probably would've gotten two stars last time.  Tonight barely deserved one star,  I feel like a blew 35 bucks in the process.  At least they got our to go order wrong on the way out."}
{"text":"Great food and nice people. Happy to find a place close to the house and open late.  Been here several times and always good."}
{"text":"After trying this place for the first time last year when I was in Phoenix and having a wonderful experience, I went back there today and was absolutely disgusted.  As we approached the front door a friend said he thought it looked closed, but it turned out it was open there just weren't any people inside.    The place smelled like a sewage plant on the inside, and we immediately turned around and went elsewhere for food.  Luckily my friend said a new Ramiros opened near his house, because I will definitely never go back to this location again."}
{"text":"Staff is always very nice and happy.  Portions are large.  I have not had anything on the menu that I wouldn't order again. Love the Super Nacho's!!"}
{"text":"Very good food and friendly service! Love that it has a drive thru also. Very clean environment everyone is so nice there"}
{"text":"Luz is always helpful and I would give her 5 stars! She always goes above and beyond to remember my order or remember that I like limes on the side. Those little things go along way with me. You have to remember you're not eating at a five star Michelin restaurant, this is a fast food Mexican place. I prefer Ramiro's over Filiberto's any day!"}
{"text":"Best bean and cheese burritos ever!!!! And the red salsa is yummy. Plus the customer service rocks!!!"}
{"text":"Worst service at a restaurant ive ever had. 25min just to get my food in drive thru. Then I realze my order is wrong. Took then another 5min to fix it but they screwed it up in another way. So 10 more min to fix it again. Drive thru and inside full of waiting people. Slowest crappiest service ever. Food not bad but not worth my lost time"}
{"text":"Cali Burrito is outstanding! We finally decided to try and were not disappointed. Great service as well!"}
{"text":"Went to drive through and ordered carne asada fries. Asked for no cheese and no sour cream (lactose intolerant) and at the window asked for 3 red and 3 green sauces.   Paid and got home to find cheese all over my fries and only 2 of each sauce. The fries were thickly cut and soggy. The carne asada was very salty.   WOULD NOT RECOMMEND"}
{"text":"The food here is very bland. My wife got the carne asada plate and I got the beef chimichanga. Neither of us finished our plates."}
{"text":"Surprised about how good this place was. Had the macho burrito which had carne asada, poblano chiles, refried beans and sour cream. It was awesome.......and the tortilla was really good too.   Also tried the cheese enchiladas and although they were pretty tasty, they were a bit too salty for my taste.   The little salsa bar was good and the green, tomatillo sauce was great. I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"*Hidden Gem*Best Mexican drive thru around this area. Great customer service. The beans taste like my Nana cooked them. The carne asada is delish. You can't go wrong here!"}
{"text":"Generous portions, simple menu, perfect for a quick meal.  Small, intimate setting so don't plan on a group meal.  The service was friendly but the front counter lady was a bit over tasked (between the take out window, the front counter and the phone) so she was a bit disorganized.  This did not stop me from enjoying my food or my experience."}
{"text":"Tasty mexican food. And great horchata.  The service is always fast and polite!"}
{"text":"We stop by Ramiro's once a week. The Shrimp burrito and fish tacos are amazing."}
{"text":"Been here a couple times now, both in the drive thru.  Quick and friendly service just like a drive thru should be.   This is not your Filiberto's, Eriberto's, or whatever chain and certainly not a Taco Bell!  No offense to those places but this is much better in my opinion!  I've had their tacos and just recently the chicken fajita combo...YUM!  Love the rice too!"}
{"text":"I love the food here, especially the burritos, carne asada and macho burritos are the best. Always happy at this location, others are not as good. You gotta try it."}
{"text":"Tried Super Nachos. Awesome snack for when your in the office and want something to munch on. Kicks taco bell's Mexican pizza in the rear! My food was cold by time I got it home though. Staff here is friendly."}
{"text":"Always good quality, the carne asada is excellent and the steak egg and cheese breakfast burritos are great. Chicken enchiladas are good as well as the surf and turf burrito."}
{"text":"Great food and great service! Generous portions and excellent salsa bar. Love their veggies and hubs loves the carne asada platter."}
{"text":"I've eaten here so many times and never once gotten cold or bad tasting food, so I am really stymied at some of the reviews. Regardless, I usually get their carne asada quesadilla which is superb--but so huge that I have them cut it into 4 parts.  I eat this over a couple days!  And it is tasty and wonderful, too. If you go inside you can find fresh veggies in brine, lemon slices and other condiments usually eaten with Mexican food, but I have been using the drive thru lately as I am always in a hurry to get home. Love this place!  It is my favorite Mexican drive-thru in Phoenix, and I have eaten at another on 43rd Ave. and Bell which was just as good.  And never had much of a wait either. Counter help is friendly and helpful always, too."}
{"text":"My kids love this place for all day, huge breakfast burritos. Great prices. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"This is definitely a hole in the wall type of Mexican restaurant. Their sauces are unique and I think quite enjoyable. Tuesday they have $.99 tacos chicken or shredded beef. Their beans are very good. Depending on the time of day you go there's typically a lot of Latin people enjoying their food. If you're in the area and looking for Mexican food I would give it a try."}
{"text":"I went there around lunch time and there were only a couple other customers which was nice. I ordered a machaca and egg burrito and they didn't have any problem making it for lunch which was great. My wife ordered the carne asada quesidilla. The food came out very quickly and we just had time to make our to go salsa cups from the salsa bar. My burrito was very tasty with a lot of meat and egg. I really liked the pico de gallo style with it. My wife really liked her quesidilla, she really liked the tortilla it was wrapped in. The reason we stopped by was because whenever we passed by on our way home the drive-thru was always busy even on Easter morning. We will be back to try different stuff, so far really good."}
{"text":"This place is never open in the mornings when they say they are. Been there twice now when they are supposedly open and no one is there.  Edit: 4 times now during business hours and it's not open. They've lost my business. Head over to Caminero down the street"}
{"text":"This is NOT one of those &/)@ertos places. We have only had the breakfast burritos so far but WOW! Very fresh and huge! Trust me two people can share one of these breakfast monsters! Very clean inside and very friendly staff. Great value for the money!"}
{"text":"Fast quick tasty well seasoned fresh large portion Mexican food...Grilled chicken was plenty enough for lunch & dinner"}
{"text":"This is not your typical drive through low quality place. I've had the nachos, enchiladas, tacos, among other things and all have been delicious! The ladies that work the counter are wonderfully friendly."}
{"text":"Chorizo burrito was great  especially with potatoes in it but Hunny said bacon one was just okay. I love green salsa and theirs is very good. Price is good for the size of burrito as they are somewhat large and are very filling.   Bonus is they are wrapped tight and right-you can eat them in the car as you head out to ride ATVs or go to lake on the weekend or  ... speed to work weekdays. ;)"}
{"text":"30 minute wait for 2 breakfast burritos in your drive through??? Get real and start staffing appropriately. I will not waste my time returning after this."}
{"text":"I was hoping for some great Mexican Food, but this was the worst food I have eaten. I ordered the Carne Asada Tacos and the meat tasted Freezer burnt. The Corn tortillas smelled funny and THE SODA MACHINE LOOKS LIKE IT HAS NEVER BEEN CLEANED....EVER!!! Completely grossed me out. I will never go back."}
{"text":"Best authentic Mexican food around. The carne asada is superb and the frijoles are as good as home made.  Great service too."}
{"text":"I'm going to be generous and give them 2 stars. It all starts with Ramiros Mexican Restaurant at this 83rd Avenue location offering a Restaurant.com deal as of a couple days ago. I called first to see if I can place an over the phone order. NOPE. No big deal! I fully understand! They stated that people order over the phone and never show up. I believe it, and I'm cool with their choice not to take over the phone orders.  So, I go through the drive thru. I place my order with my Restaurant.com deal in hand. I have never been there, or even noticed it before despite the fact that I am often in the area, in fact I drive by often!! I thought it would be awesome to try them out with my deal!! Well, I presented my deal and I was told my Restaurant.com deal was a \"FRAUD\" as if I'm trying to rip them off!! I was told the food was prepared and 'basically' I needed to pay up. I pulled out my phone and showed the gal that indeed Restaurant.com is a legit company and, YES, Ramiros obviously signed up! Someone FAILED to advise employees!  I decided to go inside to settle this dispute. It was busy (I did not realize it was 99 cent taco Tuesday at the time, which is likely why it was so busy). I had to wait and wait while orders were taken and processed. I explained that (out of guilt of wasting food) I would take the 3 meals that I ordered, but pass on the chips and the cheese crisp. I was given the meals, minus hot sauce and minus tortillas (I'm assuming the fajita meals should have included tortillas and hot sauce since I was asked if we wanted red or green hot sauce???).   So, I brought home 2 fajita meals that were far from appealing to the eyeballs! Where is the char common to a fajita meal?? We used our grocery store tortillas and Taco Bell hot sauce on our cubed chicken since neither were provided. Fajitas?? NOT. They were kind of boiled, not charred like a typical fajita plate would be. Super disappointing!!!  I ordered chicken for our kid. NOPE. He tasted it and said, \"I don't like this chicken.\" He did like the rice and luckily I got him a double portion of rice. He ate it up along with our store bought tortillas sitting in our fridge. Not exactly the healthy protein meal I had planned for him. I gave him strawberries and two vitamins to supplement.   Bottom line is, I probably would have been 'okay' with the food at a discount that SHOULD have been given to me. At full price, I would not return!!   I will say that the gal who took my order was pleasant despite the mix up / refusal to honor the Restaurant.com deal. They need to keep her happy (give her a raise) if they are going to offer deals that they DON'T HONOR!!!"}
{"text":"I have been eating at Filibertos for years, but this place beats the Filis on Union Hills in quality, price, and service. It's my new goto burrito shop in the NW valley."}
{"text":"Started off with a hair in the side of sour cream. Then a bean egg and cheese burrito that was for a vegetarian had a thin shmear of beans. So after asking for more beans, went to add them into the burrito, only to find large chunks of meat as though the eggs were cooked directly over leftovers completely disregarding that meat could not be included"}
{"text":"The food is great, but this place just can't get orders right. No matter how many times I come back to this place for the great food, they can never complete an order correctly. Worse yet they hardly ever have what you need when you need it. Sorry no more tacos. No tacos? Can I get salsa with that? Yes but Red only, no more green. What the heck? It will be sad when someday this place becomes a 'bertos location after closing because its bad service and I no longer can get my macho burrito. Also thanks for the extra burrito that I now realized I was charged for but didn't want."}
{"text":"Seriously, hands down the BEST breakfast burritos and green sauce around. I consider myself a burrito and green sauce connoisseur and have had many all over the valley. Ramiros is priced well and delicious. They even make delicious chimichangas."}
