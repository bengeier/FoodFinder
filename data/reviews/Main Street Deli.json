{"text":"I just love their salads! They are huge!  Staff is so friendly!  Great prices! It's so close to my work, I can call ahead & go pick it up."}
{"text":"Always fresh, I like the Reuben but it's sloppy. Then again, that's what napkins are for! My hubby loves the Italian and there must be a half pound of bacon on the BLT. I am sure that if you are a sandwich eater, you would like any of these fresh, made to order subs and sandwiches."}
{"text":"I used to love the Main Street Deli.  They were always pricey, but the extra cost was balanced with generous portions via the thickness of the sandwich. It was a good go to when you needed a quick lunch, or even a hurried dinner for the family.  Sadly over the course of the last year, things have taken a turn for the worse.  Menu prices have increased, and very clear cost saving measures have been put into practice. Sandwiches are thinner, a LOT thinner. Service is less friendly and more procedural... and don't get me started on delivery. If I want to eat on time, I'd better go pick it up.  Being a glutton for punishment, and a fool for the easy access, I continued order, hoping things would improve. The trend continued download, and I finally placed my final order when the last order came in stale bread.    Other local options do a much better job while providing just as good, if not better grinders."}
{"text":"I use to love this place. but since it was bought buy new owners it hasn't been the same. the sandwiches are small with meat and loaded with lettuce. I though i ordered a hoggie not a salad. Bread was brunt and the delivery took forever that i didn't even tip. Want a good packed meat hoggie go to max's and save your self the time and disappointment of main street"}
{"text":"Great service and great food. Been ordering from here ever since I moved to Munhall and I've never once had a problem. Staff is very kind and courteous as well!"}
{"text":"Haven't been here in a while and probably will not be trying again for a while...at least I would try something different. I had the chicken gyro 2 for $8.99 deal. At first , when I unwrapped one I thought luckily I got two because they are on the small side. Then I took one bite and thought...damn I have to eat two of these. They consist of unseasoned, boiled chicken, with lettuce, tomato, watery cucumber sauce, and non-grilled bland pita. BORING. My better half got a turkey sub which she liked, but she added ranch to it. The mac and cheese was alright."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches, high quality ingredients & excellent service.  The Main Street Deli uses all Boars Head meats & cheeses, crisp veggies and a wide variety of fresh baked bread- it puts their sandwiches a step above most.  I also have to give kudos to any restaurant in this area that boasts such tasty vegetarian choices- the portabella mushroom is delicious!  I also have enjoyed every soup that I have tried there (the minestrone was the best though).  The owner really pays attention to detail, and the service and food quality easily justify the slightly-steeper-than-fast-food prices (7.95 for a sandwich, chips, and a side or cup of soup).  This is definitely the place to break out of your lunchtime rut- plus they deliver in the downtown area!"}
{"text":"I eat here about once per month, always enjoyed it enough to come back. Today my dad and I ordered two 6\" hoagies , jalape√±o poppers and onion rings to eat in. Shouldn't take long at all! So we go back into their dining area to sit, and we waited, then waited, and waited some more. One of the workers even went to the bathroom during time and looked at us sitting back their alone saying nothing. After legit 32 min, pissed, I got up and went to ask what the deal was. The cashier looked at me and like a dipshit responded, \" oh that's been done, here.\" He said he thought it was delivery, even though there was no address to deliver it to, and there were clearly two guys in the back waiting. He also never apologized, which I was waiting for. After forcing down cold to the touch sandwhiches ( we both asked for toasted because we like them hot obviously) , I'm not coming back, and will let a few more people know that you are run by morons starting here and now."}
{"text":"Ok here's the thing. I like you guys and order from you a lot but there's just one thing- you have to stop it with the shredded iceberg. It's gross!!!!!! Please switch to romaine. I'm begging you."}
