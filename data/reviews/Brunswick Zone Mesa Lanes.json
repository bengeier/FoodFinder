{"text":"This was a lot of fun for our group of first timers.  There was a mix up with the scheduling of leagues and it looked like we were going to be unable to play. However, Jodi (manager) came to the rescue.  She went over the top to get us to lanes and held off the wax machine so we could get in a game and a half. So, the place was great and the employees are even better.  We will drive the longer distance to these lanes next time."}
{"text":"Bowling prices are fine but food is not good. Games are over priced and half of them don't work. The staff is not friendly the guy at the snack counter got upset with me because I ordered something right before he was going to clock out... Sooorrry..."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! They made everything so easy and had everything we needed. I went with a bunch of family, three groups of us and they were very accommodating. Plus they had a lot of deals!"}
{"text":"I went here for my daughters birthday with 9 children and 5 adults and it was ok when we didn't have to deal with staff. The girl who rang us up couldn't get our bill right so I asked to speak to the manager and she got it right but didn't correct her rude or unprofessional employee, this was the first and will be the last time I ever come to this location, and not to Mention the place was run down and old school, they need to update the location......."}
{"text":"The best place too go abd enjoy a nite out with family and or friends very friendly employees and very good food.jessica nicole junior melissa and shantel make thr nights awsome and fun all thr time.recommend this bowling alley over any in the"}
{"text":"Don't usually yelp, this will be my first.  I've come here a number of times and never had a problem. Today I came in, played two bowling games and they tried to charge us for three?"}
{"text":"Place was way understaffed. We made a reservation then checked in 30 mins before cosmic bowling started at 10. They still didn't have 2 Lanes available until 10:26. Perhaps they shouldn't let a high school student coordinate the lane logistics. Only one person running the bar so expect to wait 20 minutes for a drink. There were no table waitresses. Stars earned for good food and getting shoes was quick."}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend went to go spend our New Years Eve bowling because we are avid league bowlers thinking there would be some type of special going on for the Holiday. We were told that we cannot use our league discount because of the holiday and in order to bowl we had to either pay $42 for the special or $5 per game. This was extremely upsetting due to the fact that they have daily specials and did not honor those or give the league rate to play per game. There were about 10 lanes taken up so it was not busy at all. It is unfair that I would have to pay the same rate as anyone else when I am a league bowler and am suppose to have special perks. The lady at the front desk also admitted that there was no notice given or signs posted saying that league discount could not be used on the holiday and that she felt bad for us."}
{"text":"One of the nicer alleys in the valley.   It shows it's age on the outside but is clean and cool on the inside.   Nice staff.   Prices are typical, including the lounge and snack bar.   Be wise and call ahead as they do have \"cosmic bowl\", which draws the kids, teenagers and alike.  If you enjoy \"cosmic bowling\" -- go and enjoy.   Not my cup of tea.        If you are a serious bowler, their pro shop is one of the best.   Well staffed and they will take the time to listen.  They give good advice if you are willing to pay attention to their advice...  LOL"}
{"text":"A few months ago I joined a league at this alley, and have been bowling here weekly ever since. The employees are friendly and fun, whenever there's a problem with the lane they'll quickly fix it for you. I highly recommend bowling here."}
{"text":"Super fun! Very family oriented and the prices are not too bad. They also have a pretty good food selection and a bar if your over 21. Go at nighttime, it's more fun with the neon lights!"}
{"text":"Before going, consider that they have occasional explicit MTV music videos on big screens. When we went, they forgot to edit them after several requests (1 game, started at 8:30 pm)."}
{"text":"Bowling is by no means a huge passion of mine, but it is fantastically fun on occasion... especially accompanied with beer.    Fortunately, Brunswick Mesa Lanes has a full bar for those whose elitist beer tastes cannot be slaked with their draught offerings.    But it's not just a place for semi-alcoholics :)...the majority of people I've seen each time I was there has been either college students from nearby MCC or high schoolers forsaking any sense of a curfew.  /sigh/  Kids these days.    The lanes themselves are kept pretty clean, it's slicked in the right places, and not slick in the others.  The balls (at least 9 lb ones) are somewhat old, and some will show age through little cracks, but non-cracked alternatives are easily found.    Besides their league bowling times, and other open bowling times, they offer cosmic bowling on various nights, and also bowling specials such as 9.99 all you can bowls Wednesday night after 9:00 p.m.  I was there this past Wednesday, after 9:00 p.m., drinking Amberbock, watching teens push the limits of their curfew... and it was great."}
{"text":"We went to Brunswick Zone in Mesa for their breakfast & bowling special. For $10, I would say it was alright, nothing special about the bowling alley itself and the breakfast was about what you'd expect. There were three options to choose from for breakfast - pancakes with bacon, french toast with bacon, & eggs and toast with bacon. As a result of all the bacon that was being cooked in their kitchen, the whole place smelled like bacon. I'd be willing to come back to this place at another time."}
{"text":"Cheap drinks make me bowl better.  But man, is this place just as cheesy cool as Bonnie writes.  Oh how I love me some cheese.    With ASU close by it can be a fine lookin crowd, if you know what I mean.  I thought the song selection was lousy - no hip hop, just bad metal bands when I was there.  Call me old fashioned, but I wasn't a fan of the new-fangled 2006 scorekeeping graphic animation.  Every time I got a strike it showed some kind of homoerotic green hulk.  Are they trying to send me some kind of message?  Wtf..."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service. They said a tournament was going to happen at 9pm.. They made me wait 30 minutes and no tournament happened and she rang multiple people before me. I'm so pissed I waited 30 minutes, first one there at 9, then have people go in front of me already bowling. They need some organization and have more then one person work the front when it's busy. Will not come back."}
{"text":"Me and a friend came around 830 took the lady a minute to realize we was at the desk waiting gave us our shoes and told us we had to bowl with a crowed of other ppl that was already there asked if we could get the lane next to them rather than in the mix with them told us no so I didn't want to bowl any more then went to the bar where the guy was standing for him to tell us not only does the pool table not work or have a sign saying it doesn't that we had to come back to the front in order to order..... I was beyond ready to go then!! --------------------------------------------------------- After going back and being able to actually have a good time all of the staff were really nice and my company and I really had a good time and that's all I wanted to do.. Thank You!!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere was fun,  bar was spacious and service was good. People behind the desk were not helpful at all.."}
{"text":"Fun cool concept. They seem to be updating it frequently which some people could see that as a good thing or a bad thing. The bowling is a little over priced. A mean its bowling..."}
{"text":"Great family environment to go bowling and enjoy some good times together. Prices are good and easy to get a lane on a Friday or Saturday early afternoon. Food is good and a great pro shop as well not to mention the arcades."}
{"text":"Came here for our restaurant xmas party. They gave us an Xtra lane free towards the end of the evening huge plus! The bartender was fun, super personable, and even willing to take group photos of us on three separate phones! I'm a bartender and in all honesty I hate that! As we were leaving/ paying and returning our shoes the guy at the counter thanked us and told us we were great! No sir you guys are great!!! Do yourself a favor and have a fun night out here!"}
{"text":"Husband:  I'm not a bowler so had no expectations the night we went.  My mindset was friends, food, beer then bowl.  Friends we met get 5 stars!  Exceptional bunch.  Food- 3 stars.  It's a bowling alley so wasn't expecting a 5 star meal.  Beer- 2 stars!  Just took forever.  You have to order from check in desk and the lady running register was incredibly busy.  She had to run counter, then run and get our beer.  Bowling- 1 star.  The lanes were great, but I'm a terrible bowler.  2 games in I was thinking we'd have to put bumpers up so I could break 100.  So much harder than on the Nintendo Wii.  Could of been the oil pattern, ball selection or the addition of drinking.  Overall, place was packed.  Crowd was a mixture of family, teens and couples.  A little dark and chilly considering it was cold outside.  Felt like we had a fan blowing straight down on us.  Place was clean as were the bathrooms.  Definitely be going back.  Wife:  I had a wonderful time with our friends as mentioned by my handsome husband.  Always a great time when I whoop his a$$ in any game!!!  We will definitely be coming back for the entertainment but not so much for the food and drinks."}
{"text":"Great company and awesome prices to bowl. I love bowling, but this place could use a little fixing up. But it's in a great location so they have potential"}
{"text":"Expensive if your not a member. 2 med drinks 7.56 2 people 2 games with shoe rental 39.00.  45 min. Boooo!"}
{"text":"I don't do a lot of bowling. Maybe four times a year at the most. As my kids are getting a little bit older sitting at home during a holiday is a little boring. Christmas, Thanksgiving, Easter we usually like to go ahead and go bowling. It's always super fun and surprisingly, on the holidays it's busy. We must not be the only ones That don't like to sit at home and be bored. Staff is pretty friendly and efficient, bowling alley equipment is always working and the food is pretty good. Easter will be here in a few days and to the bowling ally we shall go."}
{"text":"Employees are very nice , food from the food bar is good and the help in this section is great! Their new special Summer Games is a great bargain which gives you 3 games daily for a reasonable cost."}
{"text":"What Whattt! Hip hop videos blaring as I get my strike on? Bowling specials after 9pm? Friendly staff? Cheap drink specials from the bar in plastic cups? ASU and working class stiffs co-existing one sweaty bowling shoe at a time? Teenagers making out at the arcarde section?  Loooveeee you, Brunswick!"}
{"text":"Your typical bowling alley.  Cocktails are about $3.50, glow bowling on saturday nights.  They have a package for 6 people for like 65 bucks.. Includes your shoe rental and 2 hours of bowling.. oh, and a pitcher of soda.  The shoes are clean.  The bar is clean, the lanes are clean, and even the bathroom was clean.  Do not underestimate how much money a bar tab can be... 2 different friends racked up over 100 dollar checks in about 3 hours.. maybe 3.5..  Anyway, I liked this place and will return for sure... but maybe because I bowled 168 woot woot!"}
{"text":"Terrible customer service!  We had a party of 7 and had 2 lanes, one lane constantly having problems. Guy at the desk is so rude and made smart remarks when I asked for help with our lane. Charged twice because he didn't know what he was doing but luckily it was fixed within a few days. Probably never coming back.   Heads up, $2 off coupon here they will not honor."}
{"text":"So, I called this location asking about bowling for a Thursday night a 9pm. The lady who answered didn't say anything other than its $7 a person, so we decided to head out to this location. 20 minutes away.   Parking is pretty big, but it was full. There was the first alarm, why was it packed so late? Well when we arrive we are told there's a tournament. That would've been wonderful information to have. Now we are waiting for 20 minutes to \"possibly\" get a lane. The management needs to start training better here. Not sure if they're aware, but college students talk. Word can spread pretty fast if a place has horrid customer service.   So to recap... Tell customers who aren't \"league\" players that there's a possibility it will be full. Fix your games because the dancing one is broken. Work on training staff to be a little more friendly."}
{"text":"Went here today with my boyfriend. Very nice atmosphere, music was very good! Only negative thing was our screen frozen several times and the ball took a long time to come up as if it was stuck so we spent most of our time waiting on the ball. Staff was very nice! Games were decent! Food was amazing! Prices are petty reasonable! Nice location we will return!"}
{"text":"Holy old people! This place was packed with senior citizens until about noon. We had one of the last lanes, along with another young family - us 10 were the only people there under 55. The guy at the front desk was a little out of it, but the guy at the food counter was charismatic & very helpful. I will definitely take the fam here in the future, just as soon as I get the hang of their heavily oiled lanes."}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday. We had 8 people in our group. Got an awesome rate. The place was clean and fun. The service was good even though it was packed. There were several other Families there. We had a great time bowling. The arcade was fun too!"}
{"text":"Compared to the AMC on the 60, this bowling lane rox my sox. The curb appeal is a little sketch, but the inside is really nice and clean. The guy at the front was helpful as well, informing our overwhelmed selves that there were $2 games until 9pm tonight. Sweet! This'll definitely be my go-to place for bowling in the future."}
{"text":"The lanes and equipment are all new which is great, and half the alley have wonderful couch seating instead of the typical plastic chairs. The only problem is that it gets very crowded, despite having 44 lanes!! Also, their weekend rates are pretty pricey - I can't blame them since the market bears the price, but three games can cost almost $20 per person with shoes, which means a family of four will walk out  spending almost $100 if you get some food and drinks. YIKES!"}
{"text":"I came multiple days before writing this review.  I will do my best to make this as much as a review and not a rant.    When they offer specials such as 2 hours of bowling for 10 bucks a bunch of people including myself take advantage of it. To my many visits here I have the impression that they are very under staffed in he front desk area. I do not want to give out names for privacy reasons but this woman would turn down potential customers by saying, \"I do not have any lanes open at this time. The lanes that are currently open are for league players. The wait period is roughly 30 minutes.\" I typically wait and come back, but every time I do she states that there is now a \"waiting list\". This is now completely unfair to the people she initially turned away. Of course there is now another \"30 minute waiting period.\"   As I bring this to her attention, all she does is apologize and tells me to come back in 40 minutes. Since she knew I was already waiting I should've been ahead of that waiting list. What I find most upsetting about Brunswick is that the manager and I make eye contact and she is just giggling. When employees fail to bring decent customers service its up to the manager to figure out a solution to make it right, but when a representative of the management fails so does the business.   I feel that this is a nice place to bowl just not at night. Typically when you're suppose to be working.  What I do suggest for Brunswick is if one of your employees started to turn away customers start a waiting list. Do not make it up as you go. That to me shows poor customers services."}
{"text":"I heard one of the greatest lines ever from Mr. Man this last Sunday, after arriving in the Brunswick Zone (say that in an over dramatic echoing voice for maximum appeal) and allowing our eyes to adjust to the black lit cosmic bowling atmosphere. A flicker of disdain crossed his eyes as he uttered...  \"This place is a fucking hatchery!\"  Best off the cuff remark ever. The place was crawling with little kids from no less than five birthday parties. Sundays and cosmic bowling must act as a beacon to small children. Anyone who knows me understands that there is no love lost between me and little kids. Thankfully, the shrill dog whistle of excitement they make when hopped up on pixie sticks and soda pop was drowned out by the sounds of bowling.  We were meeting a couple people here and wasted the time with four dollar bud bottles as we took in the mind boggling number of wee little munchkins tearing ass across the bowling alley and lobbing six pound balls down lanes with bumpers. Our party arrived and we proceeded to have a wicked amount of fun.   I don't know how you can possibly go bowling and NOT have fun. Between the shit talking and cheap pitchers, hilarity ensues. They eventually turned the lights on, the little kiddos filed out, and our crass, inappropriate humor was given free reign to shine.  I'm pretty sure everything there cost about four bucks. The beer. The shoe rental. The game. It's not the cheapest way to waste away an afternoon, but it's sure as hell a lot more fun than sitting on some sweltering bar patio or holed up inside watching a movie, with or without the ankle biters."}
{"text":"Nice bowling alley..decent prices.. only thing that was unpleasant was the little shithead working behind the counter who's summer job just got the best of him.. but besides him I am a fan of this bowling alley."}
{"text":"I went here with some friends last weekend to use a Groupon (4 people, shoe rental and 1 hour unlimited for 15$ woohoo!). I thought it was nicer than some other bowling alleys in Phoenix. The shoes were fairly new, which is always pleasant, the balls were organized by weight in a clear fashion, which was also nice. The only problem was the game froze a couple of times and the time kept ticking away, so we lost out on some time BUT at the end of our hour (of speed bowling) we only had a few frames left on our last game and the guys there gave us an extra 10 minutes for free to finish up, so that was very nice. I would come back here."}
{"text":"We held a work team event at this location.  We had reserved 4 lanes. Through their event program. When we arrived, we were greeted immediately by the Leadership, Jodi Edger and Nicole.  We were made to feel very special and welcome.  They checked in with us often to ensure all was well.  We grabbed food in the bar and played some pool as well.  The team in that area was also fantastic. Mini pizzas were yummy. We had a blast.  We had one lane with bumpers as well.  Not a problem.  I would definitely recommend this venue and the leadership service was top notch!  Cannot wait to do it again."}
{"text":"Fun place to go for a date night or for a short family trip with kids. We use our Pogo Passes and get in free twice a month for the year. If you haven't checked out Pogo Pass, check them out, and use promo code TAKE60OFF to get 60% off, and then you can get your games for free!"}
{"text":"I puchased a Groupon for my family it was for 6 people  for $49.00 for 2 hours of bowling with shoes included that was good until Friday 062218 at 10 pm. My family and I went to use the Groupon at 445 pm on Friday and was told by the manager that they would not honor the Groupon and they have been turning people away all day or making them pay the difference that was another 49.00 to bowl which we did due to us celebrating fathers day and family came together from out of state. This was terrible customer service and coupon fraud do not spend your money at this location there are many other bowling alleys around."}
