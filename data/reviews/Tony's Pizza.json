{"text":"Really enjoy this pizza parlor always seems to make it fit with which ever holiday it is. And the pizza is great."}
{"text":"Look....your in Charlotte and you ain't gonna get a slice that is just like what you ate in the Big Apple. It's the water at least that's my opinion. Here's what you CAN get at Tonys. Really huge, kick-ass, delicious pizza reminiscent of New Yowk pizza. I've eaten there for a year and never had bad pizza from there. Let's face it pizza is like sex..,...when its good it's good and when it's bad.........it's still pretty good.

{"text":"Oh yeah!!! This is some good pizza. I love how big the slices are one slice fills me up. My family can enjoy the rest and know one is left hungry. Well worth the money."}
{"text":"Tried pizza here once. That was enough. Everything about the pizza was not right. 
Crust was uneven in thickness and how it was cooked, chewy in some places and crisp like a cracker at other spots.
Sauce was unevenly spread and was a bit too sweet.
Pepperoni was ok, yet spaced out very unevenly on this extra large pizza.
Overall, IMHO they should rename themselves \"Just Don't Care Pizza\",
as that is the feeling we derived from this place."}
{"text":"Look, I get it, Charlotte is not the Pizza capital of the world.  However, Tony's does a very good job.  The slices are oversized but very tasty.  It's doesn't have the same...\"flop\" as what a lot of people think of NY pizza to have, but I almost prefer it that way.  

I haven't had it in years, but I agree with the previous review that I was not crazy about the style of sausage.  However it may have changed since then.  Now I just stick with what I know (green peppers FTW!).  

It is 100% worth a stop if you are in the mood for a slice and in the area."}
{"text":"Our office was sucked into the Papa John's franchised cheap pizza world. I had an epiphany and said let's try Tony's Pizza to change it up!!. We are all off the franchised pizza wagon and on to Tony's (they have a lot of locations now and they may be a chain or franchise, just not sure). The whole point is that this is one of the better pizza's I have had. I wish it were a little less oily, but it rocks on flavor and the pizza is so big that the price is comparable to the Papa john's and Pizza Huts.

We will definitely be ordering pizza from Tony's again."}
{"text":"We stopped by Tony's on our way from Vegas to Hoover Dam. It's in a small and quaint small town setting. Pizza (veggie) was excellent and staff was friendly. Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Fantastic place. Great, friendly staff and delicious pizza. The slices are huge, but thin enough for you to enjoy what's on top."}
{"text":"Finally!!!!!! True, northern style pizza in the charlotte area!!!  Perfect ratio of sauce to cheese, excellent thin & crispy crust. A little bit greasy, but that's what I expect and it's nothing a few napkins can't take care of. So happy to have tried Tony's!"}
{"text":"Best Garlic Knots!!  The Cheese Bread is very cheesy.  Which I consider a good thing.  Their sauce is delicious.  We had the Stuffed Shells w/Italian Sausage.  It was delicious."}
{"text":"The pizza is about $19 for a large with 1 topping but it is the best in the area. We are from NY and this tastes like the good NY pizza we are familiar with, not the garbage NY pizza that seems to be the only kind that can make it out of that area. You will not be disappointed when you eat here. You can tell it's good when you just from the outside because it doesn't have a cartoon character advertising it (Jets, Hungry Howies...) and you can see what the slices look like before you order.

I cant say what anything else tastes like here, this is a pizza place, if you order anything other than pizza you are taking chances."}
{"text":"I'm right around the corner, originally from NY, and this is like getting a slice of pizza back home. BUT Everything is good- if you're a wing person you must try the wings with a side of marinara or blue cheese. Spaghetti, chicken parmesan, everything it's good! Been eating here over ten years, never disappointed."}
{"text":"I like the pizza BUT how come the kitchen closes sooooooo early? And if you go pick up there are these STUPID kids who work the counter who don't know anything."}
{"text":"I recently moved from NYC to Charlotte for work. This is, in my opinion, the most authentic NY pizza around."}
{"text":"Great family place.  Decent food at a great price.  Also huge quantities so bring an apetitie or a box.  Seems like mostly a locals place, which is fine since I don't like the \"tourist\" destination.  Several said locals perched on bar stools and looked like they haven't moved for years.
Game was on the tv, but volume was reasonable."}
{"text":"Pizza is one of my favorite foods... and after spending time in NYC and having pizza there... I'm obsessed!  Tony's is one of the best if you are looking for true NYC style pizza... my apartment in Jersey City was a few blocks from Helen's Pizza... OMG so damn good... Tony must be Helen's brother lol..."}
{"text":"Best 'NY' style I've had since moving from PA ... I've been to all of their locations and the quality is consistent @ each one. HUGE slices ... Give it a shot. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Ate here today with my 8 year old.  Multiple staff members were hanging around in the dining room cursing within a few tables of where we were sitting.  I don't want to have to explain what the F word is over supper.  :(   Eggplant parm. sandwich super greasy.  Pizza is NY style, but sauce was bland.  First time eating here.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"On May 6, 2017 I placed an order online @ (http://tonysbigpizza.com ) an order totaling 68$ for me and my family. I've ordered from here since we moved to Matthews in 2005. I've taken my extended family here when they visit ,weve gone on weekdays when sports left us little time for home cooked meals and also on weekends with my kids and their friends. But never again. Ive never in my life ( nor have my close girlfriends , whom I've asked) have I experienced what I did tonight. When I arrived tonight and asked for my order I was tokd it had been cancelled. I asked if they were joking as I thought it was a joke.A behind the counter then stated that they called my number and had spoke with \"a guy\" who answered and replied \"it was ok\".  (My phone never rang and with me at all times. I checked. No calls. No VM.) Initially trying to decipher whether this was a joke or not a female employee nearby must of heard my confusion because she came over and further explained to me that my order had come in a few minutes before closing and therefore tgey cancelled it.I then asked about the money since my card had been ran and was told the transaction would not complete since my order had been cancelled. I will be waiting 3-7 days for it to fall off. I drove all the way there only to find out my order was cancelled even though it was placed before they closed.  As a former Pizza restaurant mg I am thoroughly confused and find this bad customer service to boot. As a customer I'm upset and hungry is my family!!!"}
{"text":"A slice of NYC in CLT.

Been coming here for years now and have yet to be disappointed with their pies. Large slices for a good price and the staff is great.  It's always busy so they're definitely doing something right.  Oh yea, they are very festive with their holiday decorations.  Recommended."}
{"text":"On my last visit to Tonys I was expecting the same old staff and the same great food.  The food has remained the same, but the staff has changed a little and this is the reason for the review. I took a friend last week for lunch since we work nearby. After ordering we sat down and the food came shortly afterward.  We were satisfied with everything until some guy comes from the back to wipe off the tables and he looked like the inspiration for the \"pants-on-the ground\" song.  Only this was the \"Italian\" version of pants-on-the-ground.  I was immediately disgusted and I am seriously considering not coming back."}
{"text":"It was sub par, honestly. Maybe the other locations were better, but this wasn't NY Style in my experience. For one, the crust was undercooked. There was no golden bottom, the crust on top wasn't golden. Disappointing. Two, there wasn't enough cheese. The sauce went to just near the edge, but the cheese did not follow. I also did not like the sauce -- it was far too tangy and didn't have much flavor; this could be personal preferences, but the sauce tasted like it came out of a can and nothing was done to fix it up. And they were really weak with the toppings. Like, Domino's weak. And they used canned mushrooms. You can tell because when they use real mushrooms they shrivel up a bit in the heat. These were still slightly slimy and that color that canned mushrooms have. My fried ravioli was way too chewy and the breading was bland."}
{"text":"Went to this place at 3pm on a Saturday afternoon -- met my husband and one of our friends for pizza and beer. It was not full.

3 reasons why I do not recommend this place.

1. Took the server 10 minutes to acknowledge I was there and bring me a beer even though they were not busy.

2. The pizza was flavorless and had a cardboard like consistency

3. They started setting up for a party right next to our table making us feel like we were in their way.

Bad service + bad food = a reason not to spend your money here."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza!  I'm so impressed after only the first time eating here.  Ordered a medium white pizza and it was ready in 15 minutes.  It was so delicious with fresh ingredients.  I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My husband and I tried this place for the first time recently after his dad suggested it over Marios. I have never been to NY but this is how i would picture NY pizza. its huge! you have to fold the slice in order to eat it, which is awesome. I got a spinach calzone and it was really big too and I couldn't finish it. it was still delicious the next day for lunch reheated. The pizza crust is thin, which is great and the sauce and cheese distribution is perfect as well. The atmosphere was what you would expect and fit what I believe they want to capture in a pizza place. You have to seat yourself and you wait till they call your name and as another reviewer noted, yes you must pick up your own trash and throw it away. But that is part of the experience. When in rome right!? We can no longer get pizza anywhere else. Pizza Hut, Papa Johns, Marios, all of them make us cringe and want to gag. this is the best pizza place in town! I do not eat pizza much (too many carbs) but my husband lives for pizza like he needs it to survive and he cannot think of going to another place again."}
{"text":"Tony's is a fairly small operation that seems to get most of it's business from the Wells Fargo center across the street and the apartment complex that it's attached to.  The pizza is New York style, so this means that the slices are abnormally large.  Typically, a slice of cheese and slice of pepperoni are enough for my dinner.  Pizza is sold by the slice as well as whole pies.  If I remember correctly, only cheese and pepperoni are available by the slice.  They also have cheese steaks, stromboli, calzones, and other Italian fare.

The location is clean and has a good atmosphere for dining in.  Extra cheese and red pepper is located behind the counter or near the fountain drink station.  The prices are fairly cheap, I don't believe there is anything other than a large pizza that is more than $20 on their menu.  Slices run around 2.50 - 3.25."}
{"text":"Great customer service amazing staff an great manager I love the atmosphere and how everything is very authentic if your looking for a great place to go this is it"}
{"text":"The pizza was good.   The salad was okay.   The fettuccine was okay,  but it had hair in it.   I didn't asked for my money back and they were still pissed about it (go figure) .  The service was kinda rude from the start.   Everything else around is busy but not the pizza place?   They should get somebody  to run it that's not grumpy."}
{"text":"Hands down the place to get pizza in the Charlotte/ Huntersville area."}
{"text":"I love this place. I absolutely love Boulder City and almost every time I go there I visit this place and have some pizza. The quality of their pizzas are amazing, if I could, I would definitely get my pizzas from here every time I wanted one. I love the decor of this little pizzeria and how friendly the people are. When I think of Boulder City this is one of the first places that come to mind. Such a fun, family friendly pizza place. I would give it more than five stars if I could."}
{"text":"I've tried the pizza (of course), traditional cheesesteak, and chick-o-philly.  All excellent.  Have visited about a dozen times over about a year and a half.  Can't go wrong."}
{"text":"When you get pizza there whether you eat it in or take they give you a dirty look when you don't put a tip on the receipt, Really you want a tip for what ?? No table service and over priced Mexican pizza
Please! I would rather have a frozen pizza."}
{"text":"Man! I was really looking forward to a nice pizza! But the slices are so much different tasting then when you order an actual size pizza. It was so dry and had no flavor whatsoever, no salt no sauce --- I was just overall disappointed"}
{"text":"This place is good overall accept for the fact I don't like that they don't use plastic gloves when making sandwiches or any food at that matter!"}
{"text":"The place has more tables than they can handle. We had to wait for an hour for our pizza and nobody even stopped by our table to give us an explanation why our order is taking so long.   Very poorly ran business!
Pizza was super greasy too.
Would not go back"}
{"text":"Best Pizza In Charlotte, Brooklyn South is a close second.  I do wish they had real buffalo wings but I have never had a bad experience."}
{"text":"Love it. It's always busy, which is a good indication that the food is good. New York style pizza that you have to food to eat. In the New York tradition, the slices are dripping with grease. It's delicious but probably not a good place if you're on a diet."}
{"text":"This is my go-to pizza place. My boyfriend is from Brooklyn and loves it. Prices are reasonable. The crust is a perfect combination of crunchy and soft. The toppings are very fresh. The service is always great and the employees are very friendly. The restaurant is clean and reminds me of a little pizzeria in NY. We usually order a large pizza and wings and have more than enough left over. The slices are HUGE and very filling. If you are looking for great NY-style pizza in the University area, this is your place!"}
{"text":"Ordered over the phone for pick up. Price $13. At pickup Bevis and Butthead told me $16. Wrong. Manager would not budge. OK. Goodbye. I tried the pizza before. Soggy, salty, expensive. Really sad if  Pizza Hut is better. This a locals bar where everybody is drooling over the bartender. The owner is in it for the bar not the pizza. Not the best place for kids or family especially during a games. As a local I felt like an outsider. I can only image how a tourist would feel."}
{"text":"I always find myself debating between Tony's and little Caesers. As you couldn't tell by blatant sarcasm, Tonys is incredible. The staff is extremely friendly and upbeat. The pizzas are huge and tasty. Their subs are devine and always full so that the meat is falling off as a sub should be!"}
{"text":"I'd tried their mediocre ny pizza before, but this time I tried the Sicilian. I wanted to support a small pizzeria instead of a chain. However, in the future I will go to a chain. The crust was awful, overcooked and tasteless. The pizza was huge but that just meant I have more to toss in the trash. I will not return to this pizzeria and would not recommend to anyone looking for good pizza."}
{"text":"One of my favorite pizza places in the Charlotte area!    The slices are HUGE, perfect to fold & eat.  I'm no NY pie expert but this is pretty good to me!  Whatever you do, make sure you leave room for a piece of tiramisu...absolutely delicious!!"}
{"text":"I've been going to Tony's since it opened in Ballantyne and always thought it to be the best in Charlotte. But since it was sold last year, it has gone downhill quickly.

The pizza has changed for the worst and one of my favorite menu items, Chicken Parm dinner tastes like a container of salt. Yes, it's not just one time but 3 times now the quality on this item is just too bad to eat and had to return it.

And when at the counter and a customer asked for a pie with fresh mushrooms, the person on duty stated the mushrooms come from a can. 

From now on, I'm sticking with Lorenzo's which IS the best pizza in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Lot's of Tony's around, this one is good food, but after many tries, I prefer other locations. Sad because this is very close to me. Seems there may have been a management change recently and this location has slipped a bit more."}
{"text":"Awesome food and friendly service. The people that work at Tony's are super nice and the pizza slices are huge!!! Definitely great bang for your buck. I always come to Tony's when I'm in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Pizza is not very flavorful at all.  Wait staff is less than helpful.  Also, they blast Christian music which is fantastic if you are a Christian music fan, I guess...  LOTS of better pizza places around and this place is not NY style pizza in my opinion.  Bummer really, considering the good prices and proximity to the Wal-Mart close by."}
{"text":"I was very impressed with the customer service. All employees were very friendly and welcoming. They offer a 10% discount when you pay with cash. I WILL BE BACK!!!"}
{"text":"Every time I go to Las Vegas I have to make a trip out to Boulder City to Tony's Pizza. Seriously. I always order their antipasto and at least the garlic knots - but I really love their pizza too. Did I mention that they have the coldest beer? Love this place! Love Boulder City for that matter."}
{"text":"Tonys pizza is fantastic, it is alot of food for your moey and true NY style pizza it is wonderful!"}
{"text":"Not the place it used to be.  They seem to be getting cheap.   No more Roma tomatoes on the subs, just that crunchy, unripe crap like Burger King.  The folks behind the counter are Spanish-speakers, I guess that's why the tv's were on a Mexican channel - but at least it had English subtitles."}
{"text":"Pure chaos and not worth the wait. Should've known by the angry crowd at the counter. The kitchen was astoundingly disorganized. Fortunately, I wasn't starving so the extensive wait for 1 slice of cheese pizza wasn't excruciating. I had lots of time to observe the  mass of kitchen workers giving each other dirty looks, but not  communicating otherwise. All kinds of backed up. To go orders consistently served plated, then slung in boxes upon complaint. Scrambling to complete incomplete orders. Piles of to go orders stacked up on top of the oven, but not being served to the angry mob waiting. It was entertaining for me, at least. $3.25 was a bargain for the 10\" slice, but it was just average. No real sign of sauce. The greasy cheese was somewhat authentic, but not tasty enough to warrant the artery clog. Decent thin crust, actually nice balance of sweet/salty."}
{"text":"This place is a joke. They get pissed if you order your pizza well done and they mess with you and make you wait twice as long as for a \"regular\" pizza. The staff is desperately unprofessional and the only reason I gave them 2 stars is because the pizza is decent. They are about 5 minutes from my house but I'll never come here again."}
{"text":"Pizza was ok. Not bad at all. Large slices. Not my favorite crust as far as flavor goes but tasty sauce and toppings. Thin crust NY style. I didn't have pizza in NY so I can't really judge on that. This side \"salad\" though is mostly cheese. I didn't eat it. I know there are better pizza places around I just haven't tried them yet. I would go back if I wanted a quick slice and was in the area."}
{"text":"I love Tony's! Best New York pizza I can find! Always get the simply pepperoni slice. It comes out large, hot, and gooey!"}
{"text":"Best pizza around!  Eggplant parm is also very good. When you talk to the staff you can tell this is a real Italian place!"}
{"text":"Tony's is the best REAL NY pizza in Charlotte, period. There's several wanna b's in town, however, this place gets all the ingredients just right, every time."}
{"text":"Tony's was the best place in Boulder for pizza now they're just as bad as vinnys must have lost there cook. No good place to get pizza now unless domino's or pizza Hut is good haven't tried them yet."}
{"text":"I was in eating a few days ago and have always really liked their pizza. While eating I could hear the sound of someone clipping their fingernails. I looked up and saw one of the guys that worked there standing behind the counter clipping his nails where my food was prepared.  Needless to say, I lost my appetite."}
{"text":"Such good, large, crispy wings. Good NY style pizza. Pretty decent spaghetti and meatballs... I wanna try just about everything on the menu, but haven't gotten around to it yet."}
{"text":"Pizza's good. Wings, great. Friendly customer service, but when's my lasagna gonna be ready?! Ordered it almost 25 minutes ago... Ok... Got my lasagna. So. Much. Sauce. Yas."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza. Plain and simple. Lasagna is wonderful too! Been multiple times (usually do take out) and it is consistently well cooked with quality ingredients and sauce. The sausage pizza is a favorite. Only dined in a couple times and it is fairly small. Great for taking kids though."}
{"text":"Great pizza at a reasonable price. Picked up take out pepperoni and cheese. Only down side to picking up the pizza was that there was not a separate line for pick up and people ordering slices/pies in the restaurant. However, once through the line they were very friendly and my pizza was fresh out of the oven into the box before my eyes! Delicious and cheap! Will be back."}
{"text":"The food is amazing but the pizza isn't the only thing that's NY style. The staff's attitude is straight out of the big apple. We were told that we couldn't have our pie for dine-in bc they closed in 30 minutes. We didn't have a problem taking it to go. But I'd rather take a pass on the abrasively poor customer service."}
{"text":"Have enjoyed the Galleria location since they opened, until last night.  Take out menu says the Stromboli comes with 3 toppings.  My wife called to order a Calzone and Stromboli, with sausage, onions and peppers.  Girl on the phone, said they usually are made with sausage, pepperoni and mushrooms but we can add the onions and peppers at no charge.  My wife said, \"Really, no charge?\".  Girl said yes.  I go to pick it up and, of course, get charged for two extra toppings.  I tell the guy the story but he doesn't believe me since he didn't take the order.  (As far as I could see, there was only one female working.)  Told him I would not return.
By the way, the TV's are usually turned to Spanish speaking networks.  Since all of the customers last night were English speaking and all of the employees are Spanish speaking, I wonder if the TVs are there for the customers or the employees?
Overall the food is always good but I don't like getting cheated or lied to."}
{"text":"NC sucks for pizza.  Growing up I always got to pick from Domino's and Pizza Hut.  It was a big deal when Papa John's came around, so I love it when there are other pizza places!  

Tony's is great!  I am not from NY, so I'm not going to say I know anything about NY pizza, but I really enjoy it.  It's not too greasy compared to others (but still greasy), and I really love it with jalapenos.  However, I love anything with jalapenos, so maybe don't count that.  But the pizza is great!  Thin and gooey crust and HUGE slices.  

They don't deliver which can be frustrating, but go for some good pizza instead of those chains next time and check out Tony's!"}
{"text":"REAL DEAL NEW YORK STYLE PIZZA !!! I loved the pizza. The slices were worth the price I paid. Two extra large slices filled me up. YUM :-) I will be back."}
{"text":"Good pizza. Service was good. Easy in and out. Bathrooms really needed attention. Otherwise I would have given 5 stars."}
{"text":"Always look forward to a visit to Tony's We order one large with pepperoni and half mushrooms and the other with pepperoni and anchovies They are generous with the toppings and the sauce is more than adequate The crust is thin and sometimes a little too thin for me but that is personal taste and by no means a criticism If your looking for a great pizza try Tony's You won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"By far the closest pizza to up north! I have been in Charlotte for 10 years now, and this is the first time anyones gotten close to how they make pizza up north. Huge pies for a descent price! highly recommended. : )"}
{"text":"Pizza is greasy but delicious and the hot wings are amazing. Defiantly don't judge the place by the looks. They even have lunch specials."}
{"text":"The pizza isn't bad. The service is. I like their pizza. [if you get it fresh (and not by the slice)] 

I've called a few times for a togo order. The first few times they were quick or they had it ready when I got there. [I'm within walking distance so I'm not the type that would be late to pick it up] The last time I went they had not even started to make the pizza. [2pm on a Saturday] I haven't been back since. 

Best features of this place: You get a really good value for your money. Typically their pizzas are larger than the size advertised. 

NEVER----EVER Get pasta here. I made this mistake with the lasagna. Its clear they don't know how to make it and they don't do it very frequently."}
{"text":"Try the garlic knots....yum! New York Pizza just like when I lived in Queens!!! Don't forget to try the desserts they are great."}
{"text":"Tonys pizza is the best place to go when we are craving really good NY pizza. They also have amazing sandwiches.  The workers are very friendly. Cleab environment to eat in and it's good for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"It's tonys pizza. How can you go wrong? This location is just as good as any other ones I've gone to. If your looking for a good NY pizza then this is the place to go. There calazones and stromboli are delicious. Fast cook times and a great price!"}
{"text":"from ny originally, have been looking for a good pizza place for the past couple months.  finally found it :) the price is really good as well."}
{"text":"I was hungry. My aunt was hungry. Those were the only two reasons I went to this place while out visiting Boulder City.

The pizza portions were ridiculously huge, but y'know, there was nothing special about this place other than its cheap prices. The cheese on my slice was overly greasy and no matter what you do, NEVER order their fries because they're out to make you fat."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service. Ordered the turkey sub which turned out to be SMOKED turkey (not posted as such) which tasted like ham (which I DO NOT like) 
When I brought it back and expressed my displeasure, NO attempt was made to correct the situation. Won't go there again"}
{"text":"This was a last minute pick after returning a rental to triple a!! The pizza was delicious, fresh, and quick service. The staff was so friendly. Got pizza, wings & salad. Will definitely be back when around!"}
{"text":"Good place to eat. I liked the pizza and the chicken wings! Good family meal deal. This is better quality then Papa Johns, Pizza Hut or Dominos"}
{"text":"This place is great for a family night. You can sit outside under the misters and enjoy the casual atmosphere. The garlic knots and mushroom pizza are delicious! I love Boulder City and I love Tony's pizza :-)"}
{"text":"There Pizza is solid.  The place is clean .  Their prices are reasonable.  NY/NJ people, they make zepoles.  Pretty dam good."}
{"text":"My favorite Pizza place in the area. A small here is like a large from other places. Wish they had the beef pepperoni like their Mooresville location."}
{"text":"Ordered cheese pizza, the sauce needs to be worked on as it didn't fit with the cheese that well and the dough needs to be worked on as well but not a bad pizza but needs improvements. Having tried many places I can say this isn't the best but still decent."}
{"text":"Just a quick update - I have been to Tony's several several several more times since I discovered it and I am never disappointed. Tried the garlic knots which are very garlicky and yummy. Mozzarella sticks are good too. I still stick to pizza for my 'main' dish. And if you ask for a small cup of marinara sauce to dip the crust in they will oblige. I've brought family from Philadelphia here for lunch when they've visited and they raved about it."}
{"text":"The guy that makes the pizza, literally coughed up a lung and spit it straight out into a trash that was right where he was kneading the dough.  When I exposed him he was so nonchalant as if he done nothing wrong.  I will never go there again!!!!!!!!  Never in life.  I requested my money back and walked out."}
{"text":"When Tony's first opened by my house, it was amazing!!! We had no thin crust, real New York style pizza place. The sauce is good and tangy, the slices are huge, there's just nothing special about the place. Lately (for the past few years) it seems like they're not baking the pizza all the way or something. The pepperoni are never crisp, the crust is kind of pasty and chewy, and the cheese doesn't really get golden brown anymore. It's a descent pie, I think they can do better. They do have pretty good sub sandwiches, fresh salads, and garlic knots that smell amazing when hot out the oven! The offer pizza by the slice but only cheese and pepperoni. I've never been sure of why they can't just throw a couple of toppings on top of an already baked pie and throw it in the oven. They can charge extra! When I order a slice, I usually have to take it home to warm it up or brown it to get the crust crisp. The wings they offer are tasty and spicy even though their just frozen wings, they're not bad. Tony's doesn't have any competition too close by (when I go it's for convience), they're lucky in that sense. And, they close very early on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday night. If it's after 10pm and you want pizza, don't call Tony's. They serve beer and wine, maybe they should add a tv or two where people can hang a little and enjoy the pizza. It can be quiet and your only option is to look out the window, if you go alone lol."}
{"text":"Tony's is always our go to for pizza night!  Their marinara sauce is the best around. And don't forget to order their garlic knots!  Our go to fav's is pizza, knots, spaghetti and even their wings!!! If you're looking for some good homemade pizza and pasta Tonys is the place to go!"}
{"text":"Tried them when they first opened, and we didn't care for it then.  But they seem to have gotten their act together and now they are a regular stop for us.  Very good New York style pizza ... large pizzas and good value for your $.  Taste is very good, crust ( VERY important) is nicely chewy.  We've also gotten some of their non-pizza dinners, and were impressed.  Definitely recommended for a try.  Can be tricky to find their parking space tucked behind Monroe road ..take the Galleria turn-off and it's on your left ( near 5-Guys)."}
{"text":"Listen Chicago pizza is the best hands down! With that in mind, this pizza is pretty good, and the chicken philly is really good!. Good prices and the place has a neighborhood feel not that Charlotte would anything about that. parking is tricky but definitely if in this area this a great place for a slice. They have other sister stores throughout Charlotte, I can only vouch for this one"}
{"text":"AWESOME PIZZA! Reminds me of growing up in East Orange, NJ. Delicious! Perfect sauce, perfect cheese and a perfectly crunchy outside, soft inside crust. I'd recommend Tony's all day. Either location is terrific."}
{"text":"I love this place for a good slice of pizza & salad. 

Pizza slice- cheese please. It's so big I have them slice it in half. 

Salad- iceberg lettuce and lots of mozzarella cheese.  I like the olive oil vinegar dressing. It's so good!"}
{"text":"This is some of the best pizza in charlotte. Slices are huge and prices are fair
I always stop for lunch here when I'm in the area"}
{"text":"worth the ride, worth the wait.  best pizza around similar to New York, can't get that too often around here."}
{"text":"Ordered 2 slices of cheese pizza, and apparently here that means you get an entire pizza. For $6 what more could you ask for?! Seriously these slices are massive! And boneless wings were delicious too!"}
{"text":"Just ok.
The LARGE pizza was pretty small and all the toppings slurpped down to the middle while cooking.

Taste was pretty good...the wings weren't too bad.."}
{"text":"Tasted so wonderful but I find it a little ridiculous I just paid $11 for a Philly steak and French fries. I'll return again but only if I'm in the area and not trying to budget myself for lunch"}
{"text":"We visited Tony's Pizza the other night for the first time.  You order at the counter and then seat yourself in their very large dining room and go pick up your order when it's ready.  Then you throw out your own trash and nobody cleans off the tables.  Why they have a tip jar and a spot for tips on their receipts is anyone's guess.  Seriously?  

Anyway, enough about my rant on thinking you deserve a tip for not doing any actual \"serving\" or \"bussing.\"  We ordered a large pizza (19\", I think?) for the kids, a stromboli, and a calzone.  What's the difference between a stromboli and a calzone, you ask?  A stromboli seems to be just like a pizza on the inside of a crusty pocket.  A calzone also comes in a crusty pocket, but doesn't have sauce inside (only on the side for dipping) and ricotta cheese.  

The pizza was humongous.  Each slice was this massive mini-pizza all by itself.   I sampled the pizza--it was pretty good.  Thin crust with some crisp on the bottom, and it also had just the right amount of cheese and sauce.  No skimping here.

The stromboli and calzone were huge, too, and both tasted fantastic.  They each made for two meals. They make good dough/crust at Tony's Pizza, and the fillings were amazing, too.  It's too bad they don't have more of a variety for strombolis and calzones.  There's one of each.  

We also tried the Fried Zucchini appetizer because I had heard from friends that they were good.  They were just okay.  A lot of batter and not much flavor/spices.  For the price and taste, I wouldn't get them again.

The atmosphere was very cafeteria-like, but since there's a LOT of seating, you can spread out throughout the dining room.

Would we return to Tony's?  You bet!  Great pizza and pizza-like products at great prices.  Just don't expect me to tip when you never leave your spot behind the counter."}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME. i love the calzones and the pie is excellent. The service is fast and friendly."}
{"text":"I love Pizza!!

Tonys has a great lunch special, A slice of pizza with a side salad or garlic knots and a drink for like $6.50 

The pizza is great! I have been just for a slice and also for a pie with the Fam! My dad used to get the sausage and peppers and really liked it. The salad is good with the mozzarella on top of it and the Italian dressing 

Its perfect for a quick bite or to pick up, I do suggest if you dine in and want a pie, to order everything beforehand and then get there and enjoy it without the wait!"}
{"text":"The best. The best pizza I've had in Charlotte. As a PA and CT transplant, I can say I know authentic east coast style Italian thin crust pie. This aces it. Slices have to be folded to fit them in the box. The sauce is the main thing that makes this the best. It's perfect. Just typing this makes me Jones for a slice!"}
{"text":"This is the best NY style pizza in the Charlotte region.  I've had NY style pizza from all over Charlotte and this is by far the best.  I just wished they delivered.  The staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"Ran into this spot since we wanted pizza and Dominos doesnt have an eat in spot. It worked out, it was yummy pizza. Feed family of 7 wirh 2 large one small. Great price too!"}
{"text":"One of the best pizza places in town. Get the Tony's special. If there's just two of you eating, get the small unless you want to take home a lot of leftovers. Great food!"}
{"text":"Huge slices and friendly service for you, mister!  Better bring your appetite because they won't let you leave hungry.  Excellent sandwiches too.  Stromboli takes a while to bake, so call ahead and have it hot and waiting for your arrival.  Seating can be limited during lunch, some come early and enjoy some great Italian food."}
{"text":"This place is the best in Charlotte!  I know it's a chain, but this tony's is awesome. The pizza is really good, and fresh. I've had almost everything on their menu from salads to wings to subs. Everything has been great, the staff is really friendly. A must if you like great pizza and huge slices!"}
{"text":"Came here with my wife on our mini vacation.  I am visiting from Phoenix where they don't have good pizza....this place was a breathe of fresh air!  Good old fashioned pizza paired with excellent customer service makes this small joint a place to keep in my pocket for my next visit to Boulder City.  If you are a pizza lover-this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been coming here for years.  We also bring family when they visit from out of town.  I love the quaint spot. The garlic knots are a definite favorite.  But, the sauce on the pizza is literally what i crave . We have always had great service and never too long of a wait.  Besides, it would definitely be worth waiting for.  We enjoy the area.  A nice Sunday lunch and stroll through the town is what's the best!"}
{"text":"I eat pizza every where I go visit. I have to say Tony's Pizza is one of the top places that delivers a tasteful delicious pizza! The price is good and the amount of fries you get in a basket is perfect.  I recommend anyone who is craving pizza to stop by."}
{"text":"Your best option for New York style pizza in the area period! Being originally from NYC I am always looking for good pizza and I found it here. They are also always very nice and you don't wait long regardless of how busy they are. Another plus is the rest of the menu is awesome too, especially the Cheese steak!!"}
{"text":"New favorite!! The large is HUMONGOUS and so yummy!! Friendly staff and clean environment"}
{"text":"Tonys is the best pizza around this area and the only authentic New York style pizza I have found here yet. The sauce is to die for and every pie is made fresh to order. I can't get enough of their pizza. Great lunch specials by the slice"}
{"text":"OMG Tonys! The pizza is amazing. It is authentic NY Style pizza. My dad was visiting and we got a large half pepperoni half cheese pizza from here. My dad almost ate the whole thing. He couldn't get over how authentic it was. It is such a good price too and they have great lunch specials. If I am ever craving pizza, this is the first place I go!! 5 stars and recommend to anyone that appreciates real pizza and not pizza hut style crap"}
{"text":"Best pizza in all of Huntersville/Davidson/Cornelius. Seriously. And if you just want to give it a try, they do $3 pizza by the slice and the slices are oh so very big! Delish"}
{"text":"What happened? Hoping it's just been a  bad few nights. Coming from NJ , when I moved here I was happy to find Tonys. But last few times I have gone it has not taste the same. Crust not cooked enough etc I hope this is not a trend."}
{"text":"This pie is a far cry from NYC. If this is best charlotte has to offer... Well thats sad. The crust is thin but is too chewy for my taste. I find an overwhelming oregano flavor to what i can only assume is the sauce. Overall - this pie is fair. Portions are great!!"}
{"text":"It's good. Friendly folks, pretty quick on the service and I happen to think the pizza is real good. Thin very large slice and tasty. Menu is extensive, restaurant is clean and always fresh."}
{"text":"Not bad ny style pizza but I'm a chicago style fan so. It's just ok"}
{"text":"Catching up on some reviews here.

This is a small/medium chain, not a small mom and pop shop. 

Being in NC, and advertising as many do 'True NY Pizza', they as every other in the area boasting true NY pizza are setting the bar high.

Bottom line is, as most know, your not going to get true NY Style Pizza/Bagles etc, without NY water.

Sounds crazy, that the key lies in water from NY, not water from the pristine south, but if you know food, you know this to be true.

With that said, Tony's has got a great Pizza. If you like NY style pizza, Tony's comes close, you wont be disappointed.

Large pies, large slices with the 19inch and they have a 25incher that would feed a large group (the 19 each will easily satisfy 3-5 hearty eaters easily), good stuff.

Have tried their lasagna, ziti, subs, calzones etc, and I would call them all average. Not bad, but not anything you will run home and tell your neighbors about.

With Tony's, the pizza is where its at. Their signature item, imo.

Folks at the galleria location are typically very friendly, whether slow or busy (normally they are pretty busy at peak lunch/dinner hours, but again, nice, friendly and courteous...call ahead, it'll be ready when you arrive)...

I normally go for the 19inch for my family, but if your on the go, wanting lunch, they have lunch specials normally 2 giant slices, drink and etc, with no wait time.

They also have a 10inch pie reasonably priced that will satisfy 2 hungry lunch goers...."}
{"text":"Thank goodness my husband and I ignored  the 2 star reviews. This pizza is the real deal. None of that frufru designer stuff. Run by hard working young men who served up  New York style pizza:  greasy, thin crust with lots of cheese and tomato sauce. You can even grab a beer from the sports bar next door to complete the meal.
Thanks Tonys."}
{"text":"Good food: quick and satisfying as we needed the carbo load for the basketball team. Timing was good and we took up the whole place between games. They even offered to be available if we needed an after game bite as well. Nice!"}
{"text":"Ok it's really disgusting here! If I could give 0 stars I would. I came here Friday for a couple slices with a co worker and he found a hair in his marinara sauce for his Mozzarella sticks. Can you imagine how many pizzas were made with that hairy sauce????? But what's worse is the HORRIBLE customer service. My coworker goes to tell the \"manager\" about the hair and he says \"Ok..? There's hair all over the place.\" I should have put a piece of my hair on his lip to see how happy he would be with that terrible answer. I love pizza but I will NEVER come here again."}
{"text":"Love this place... Pizza is always fresh, and hot, I know cause I burnt my mouth a few times lol... The garlic knots are amazing, sometimes I come in just for them (big garlic fan), I have also had the chicken parm sandwich and it is also good, best NY Style pizza I have found in NC! A regular customer."}
{"text":"Food was worth the wait!  20-30 mins. Stromboli and calzone was doey, cheesy, and meat was nicely cooked. Garlic knots were perfect and tasty!  Small kitchen but don't be fooled.  Place packs a good dinner!"}
{"text":"Tony's Pizza has ruined me for other pizza.  I've been to New York and Chicago many times and eaten the best pizza they've had to offer, but I still prefer Tony's.  I live all the way on the west side of Las Vegas, but whenever my husband and I want pizza, we make the 45 minute drive out to Boulder City just so we can have Tony's.  When they bring out the pizza the cheese is still bubbling!  It's so fresh and delicious, I won't bother eating pizza anywhere else!  If I could give them more stars I would!"}
{"text":"I cheated for that!!? Disgusting, dirty and I'm praying I do t end up sick. The fries tasted like old oil and the pizza was served hot but there was nothing fresh about it. The cook had the worst attitude and the owner was letting her friend walk in and out of the kitchen like SHE owned the place. They most know someone in the Health district because I can't understand how this place isn't shut down."}
{"text":"Everytime I go there I get a 24inch pizza. I have three boys that cannot Finnish this pizza so I always have some to take home. This is one of the best places I've been to in Charlotte. The staff are nice and the pizza is good quality! It's a little pricey but it's worth the money."}
{"text":"The pizza here is excellent, however the service is minimal and it's a shame they don't deliver. Would give five stars but they don't have a separate line for called in orders and in the busy times there might be 20 people in line to dine in. I keep coming back because the pizza is great but please consider making it worthwhile to call ahead!"}
{"text":"Overall a great experience...a friend and I stopped tonight and got 'fried ravioli' a new and very rewarding food experience as our appetizer.  For the main dish, we ordered a 19 inch pizza with several yummy toppings.  I really loved that the crust was hand made in front of us and it had a nice crunch to it (I hate flimsy pizza!).  My only complaint was that the pizza was just a tad greasy....but I suppose the grease is what gives it some of the yummy flavor.  I also thought the prices were very reasonable....our extra large pizza...two drinks, and two appetizers for 25 bucks.  If you are in the university area, are craving pizza, and are sick of papa johns or dominos, I'd definitely give Tony's a try!"}
{"text":"This pizza is delicious, and worth the price. The only reason I didn't give five stars is that we ate there, and it took over an hour to get our pizzas, which we felt was excessive. This isn't enough to keep us from going back, but we will call our order in ahead of time."}
{"text":"Man, the quality of the pizza has really gone down.

I went to high school in Boulder & back then, tons of kids would go down after class to get pizza and hang out. The pizza had a crispy, wood-fired crust with lots of big bubbles, meaning it was well aged....well, NOT ANYMORE. :{ 

Now the crust is thin, the cheese is cheap and the toppings on the supreme pizza are sparse and also seem pretty cheap. 

$15 for a medium supreme pizza isn't bad, but the quality is nothing at all like it used to be. I was really disappointed to find that out. 

You're probably better off getting a frozen pizza & a 6 pack for the same price."}
{"text":"It was my first time eating here and I must say I was impressed. The slices are huge. I got a 19' or as we say a large. The crust on the pizza is nothing like Pizza Hut or any other pizza place, it is much better. You can cut the slice in half and share with another person. It was so fresh and cheesy. It actually was a good price for what I received. I had some left over and it was even better the second time. I will definitely be going back again."}
{"text":"The food is always great here! Tony's is one of our family favorites!  Our favorites include their pizza, Italian sub - Tony's way, and especially the garden salad with oil and vinegar dressing!"}
{"text":"The food is not so good the pizzas are not the same thickness so they bubble up and your left with a slice that has no cheese.  The place is very dirty the owner rude and thinks he knows it all. And sometimes if you watch the people in the back you can see them chasing down rats, yes rats. But because this is a historic part of town they cant remodel and the health inspector only gets to see the front,  Not the back.
I am surprised they are still open, the only reason they get a two star rating instead of one from me is because the wings are pretty good."}
{"text":"Very good pizza! We usually get Pizza loaded with veggies or sometimes a pizza with some pepperoni. They also have some great other food choices 2. You can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"I thought the pizza was a novelty. Mega slices you fold in order to eat. My slice was reasonably priced, the crust was my favorite although I didn't care for the toppings as much.  I am partial to Chicago style and the drinks are expensive so the rating is just a 3 star, just average or a bit better - I'd give 3 1/2 stars if I could."}
{"text":"Got two cheese slices and a drink for 6 dollars. I loved the pizza. Thin crispy NY style crust, my favorite. Small dining area and covered patio dining outside, that's where I ate. Great people watching. Guy at counter was friendly. Good experience."}
{"text":"Pizza was tasty and a good value.  I felt I got a lot of food for my money.

There was a group of teenagers and moms in there and they seemed to also be enjoying their meal.  The restaurant is decorated in early modern tacky which is pretty cool.  This is not a fancy date night place by any means but is a great lunch pizza place."}
{"text":"My go-to spot for a Philly Cheesesteak! Call it in to get it faster, I need to try the pizza here, I've read great things!"}
{"text":"Best place to get a New York slice. Pies always come out hot. Reminds me of some of the Italian family shops in Philly.

Do yourself a favor and avoid papa johns or pizza hut. Go here"}
{"text":"Came here for their ginormous pizza's. My brother called ahead as we were about 20 minutes away. We stopped at Walmart for some items and then proceeded to Tony's. We got drinks and sat down and they called out our order for mozzarella sticks that were ready. The mozzarella sticks were pretty good, you can't go wrong with fried anything in life. We ordered a Sicilian veggie pizza and a 24\"inch cheese. Both pizzas were massive and more than enough to feed our tribe of 3 growing boys and 4 adults. The Sicilian pizza and cheese both were good but I felt like the sauce was just okay and whoever made the pizza had a heavy hand with the sauce. The veggie Sicilian had a lot of veggies which I definitely was happy about.It was almost 70.00 for two orders of mozzarella sticks and two massive pies which I felt was a bit steep but in Tony's defense we do still have a lot of pizza left over.  Better than papa johns but not better than authentic New York style pizza joints."}
{"text":"Best pizza I've had since moving to the area from New York..  slices are huge.  Reminds me of rosa's in Penn station"}
{"text":"I rarely do the review thing but I had to this time.  Super friendly staff and ohhh the food.  The garlic knots may be the best I've had in Charlotte... No joke they are baked perfectly.  The pizza is legit and on par or better than anything I've had in Charlotte.  Definitely coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"Took pizza back because crust was over cooked and had a bitter taste. Management had such an unprofessional attitude ... it was incredulous!
The manager loudly shouted at me ... \"other customers like the pizza the way it is...\" Those other customers stood by smiling. I said ... \"then let them eat your pizza.\" After going on and on about how the pizza was good etc.            I said that was his opinion and mine differed. I also said that I would not be back ... and the manager said \"Don't come back.\" On that we did agree.
Poor food ...and even worse customer service."}
{"text":"Small but mighty great pizza always fresh family run and they take care of your hungry with delicious pizza"}
{"text":"Pizza by the slice. I love this place. Very casual, order at the counter, people-watch on the patio in downtown BC. $2.55 for a slice of pepperoni. I've eaten here since '97. My favorite pizza in southern Nevada."}
{"text":"The service at Tony's is outstanding.  The gentleman at the front counter knows how to do his job and I absolutely loved it.  Customer Service is a dying art, but not for this guy.  The sandwiches at Tony's are really, really good.  We tried the Italian and the Meatball.  Both were fantastic.  We also had a pizza which was good too but not as good as the sandwiches.  Not the cleanest of places, but we were there at the end of the day and it appeared as if they were about to mop the floor so I'm sure it is not always like this."}
{"text":"The place looked clean. When I went it was crowded (Friday night) so it took a while for my pizza to be ready. The large pizza is huge bigger than the box and tasty. My hubby asked me if I got an extra large pizza lol. The slices are huge. One slice is like 2. I also ordered a salad and wings. The wings were good a little spicy. I didn't eat the salad yet because I ate everything else first. I would definitely go back and try other things."}
{"text":"More miss than hit, that's why i musta quit. I used to frequent this place a lot on my trips up to boulder, used to love the cheap prices and combo meals and specials. However service has dropped to an all time low. The older gal who works there is pretty nice it's the scmeckle heads in the kitchen that are iffy. The past few trips have been epic fails, ordered and received a burnt cheese steak well dopey mc dope fiend gives no apology or offer to take it back. The garlic knots are the saving grace for this restaurant. My last few times there left me  feeling a lil queasy so i decided that was divine intervention and haven't been back since."}
{"text":"This review is for take out.

Where can you find authentic NYC style pizza? Definitely, have to visit Tony's Pizza. On  a rainy day like today and gathering a friends to watch March Madness basketball game with NC vs. Harvard what do you do? Get a whole pizza pie and call it a night at the games.

Talk about a large pizza pie. The pizza overlaps to the edge of the box like it busting in the seams. Gotta love the crust! Thin pizza with gooey cheese of course don't forget the toppings- sausage on one half of the pie and spinach on the other half. Now, we got the meat and vegetable covered."}
{"text":"Second time here... 

Should have written a review from my first visit several years ago, it would have been better. 
We liked it so much the first time that we planned on eating there when we went down to Boulder City.

 We stopped in at dinner time and only a few people were seated outside. 
We ordered an antipasto salad, spaghetti & meatballs and a small cheese pizza. 

The salad came out first, it was some cold cuts and cheese sliced in strips on top of iceberg lettuce that had seen better days, tomatoes were mushy from being cut early that morning, lots of ripe olives, banana peppers and oregano. Not too appealing to the eye and I've had better. Silverware would also be nice instead of plastic forks, if you're paying almost 9 bucks for a salad, it would be better not to eat with plastic

The spaghetti came with one meatball. The meatball was very flavorful, wish there was more.. The sauce was also very flavorful and thick.

The pizza, although again not eye appealing the crust with the sauce did have great flavor.. If you like tomatoes, you're going to like the sauce. The cheese kept sliding off but it was good & chewy. 

Eating outside was nice, no atmosphere inside, and appeared that it needs a good cleaning. 

."}
{"text":"Good, tasty pizza slice with bottom nicely browned and chewy/crispy New York style crust. They use good quality cheese and their garlic knots are nice and garlicky! Indoor and outdoor seating in charming downtown Boulder City. So happy to find New York pizza in the desert!"}
{"text":"I'm from ni and I lived in Charlotte nc for a year and I finally found REAL PIZZA !! They have pizza that you would find walking on the boardwalk I seaside heights . We bough 3 pepperoni slices and a Stromboli and it came up to be 30 bucks , FOR ME it's a little pricey BUT so worth it !!!"}
{"text":"Before I used to eat at Papa Johns and Dominos whenever I wanted pizza. Since discovering this place, whenever I'm craving a pie I always come here now. Huge pizzas, not too greasy but still delicious and cheesy. We even had their cannoli's last time and they were delicious"}
{"text":"Love this place - pizza is delicious, reminds me of my NY Pizza.  I've never been disappointed at this location.  They are always busy which should give you a sense of how good they are."}
{"text":"Found Tony's while on vacation. The pizza is awesome and the customer service is also awesome. I got a 15\" pizza, it is 8 huge slices just so you know, with pepperoni and mushroom, they killed it with the toppings, not like those chain pizza places where they give you 3 pepperoni and two mushrooms, this pizza was covered perfectly!!!!! Great place!!!!"}
{"text":"Yes! Yes! Yes! This is the best pizza I've had in charlotte since Hawthorne's pizza. This is leaps and bounds above every other pizza place in university. 

When you walk in it reminds you of an early 90's fast food place but man does the food speak for its self. They sale pizza by the slice all day or you can get a whole pizza made fresh in front of you. 

The portion size is beyond copious and there are really good lunch specials.  You can tell that everything is made by hand because every time you order an item its liable to come out looking slightly different than the last. The salads are large and the pizza slice truly has to be folded over in order to eat it! I you get two slices you won't eat for a week. 

Some items like the garlic knots are a little inconsistent but, I can easily over look this because the pizza is so good."}
{"text":"Great pizza! They were super busy when we were there but the employees were very polite and kind about the wait! Good pizza!"}
{"text":"Well I don't know how to say this but I don't actually like pizza that much. That said I thought the pizza here was just decent. The decor is very bare and may be nonexistent, but it's just a quickie pizza joint so we'll let that slide.

Came for lunch and thank goodness my friends ordered for me before I got there because it looks like the service here takes forever. No bueno for the lunch hour rush crowd! I thought the pizza would be super awesome since I got to look at them making the pizza but it turned out to be just average, but then again I'm no pizza connoisseur.

Maybe not an every day eatery for me since it's fairly out of the way but it's not the worst option in the area and prices are fairly decent for the huge portion you get (I had trouble finishing half of my pizza slice)."}
{"text":"Best pizza i have had in a long time.  I had never tried NY style za before, but I am a big fan now.  Can't wait to try it again sometime soon!"}
{"text":"Friday night is usually pizza and ice cream night when I head to my sisters house.  More specifically it ends up being Tony's and Rita's night since they are in the same area.  She has 2 young boys and this satisfies them, and us at the same time.  

This week we switched it up and went last night.  She ordered 2 cheese pies and 2 salads to eat in and by the time we got there it was almost done.  For 5 adults and 2 kids we ended up eating all of it and everyone left full and happy.

I do think this is the most authentic NY style pizza place I've tried in Charlotte.  More often than not, the pizza comes out nice and thin with a great crispness to it, and a nice crust.  Last night it was perfect.  Other times it can be a bit soggy but luckily the ingredients taste good so its not a big deal.

Also, Friday nights and Sunday nights are like going to two different restaurants.  While Friday's are packed, Sunday had us and maybe 2 other tables."}
{"text":"This place is phenomenal.  Just grading the pizza and service here.  The large pizza is huge.  As others have noted, a few of the edges need folded just to fit it in the box.  Unmistakable oregano vibe to it. Thin, floppy and greasy, but not in a bad way.  The service was great as well. Friendly and clearly take their craft seriously.  Bravo, Tony's Pizza!"}
{"text":"I'm from Chicago, I take pizza SERIOUSLY. This is my favorite pizza in Charlotte, and I feel I've tried them all. It's a beautiful crust with flavorful sauce, not too much, and the right amount of cheese so it's not greasy dripping down your arm (I never understand why people find that a positive). I love this pizza, and I can't find better for REAL cheese pizza. There ya go!"}
{"text":"The best pizza I have had in the area and the slices are huge! I can't comment on the rest of the menu besides their calzones which are delicious. I always go in thinking I'll try something else and the smell of the pizza hits me and I'm sold.

Staff is extremely friendly and somehow always remember me which is odd since I don't make it up that way very often. I have driven all the way from SC a few times just to grab a few slices. Can't recommend them enough."}
{"text":"Great NY style pizza. Huge slices and friendly staff. The best pizza you can get in the area."}
{"text":"coming from a northerner who has moved to the south - you CANT find good New York pizza in charlotte UNLESS you come to Tonys! it NEVER disappoints and always satisfies my \"homesick\" cravings. their pies are gigantic and you really get a New York / New Jersey shore feel when you walk in the door. it's authentic pizza and absolutely delicious!! if you haven't tried it - do it NOW!"}
{"text":"Needing some NYC style pizza and this fits the bill!"}
{"text":"For what it is , a small non chain restaurant , the pizza is ok ...the best thing is sitting on the street watching the people show in Boulder City ! after your pizza or Italian food , stroll on down to Boulder brewing Co and have a pint and listen to live band !"}
{"text":"Pretty good pizza. Huuuge single slices for only 3$ and toppings are 50 cents extra. The wait was only 5 minutes too and service was good. Cute, small pizza shop with great prices & food. Nothing bad to comment on!"}
{"text":"Best family business ever.... awesome food great family vibes. I love this place because it reminds me of NYC pizza you can purchase by the slice love Tony's"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went to get pizza at the last minute one night at this place. Whenever we got back with the pizza at home, not only did I love the pizza but I fell in love with my boyfriend because he knew where to get this pizza. Never had a bad pizza here. Great thin NY style and the toppings never disappoint. Forever my go to for GREAT pizza."}
{"text":"This is a cute little place in a cute area. We had a salad that was DELICIOUS! We also had a BBQ chicken pizza that was delicious! We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"They give you a lot for the cost. However, the service suck. They talk to the guy in front me, and behind me. They only said  two sentences to me and that was my name and the cost. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"I live in Boulder City and wanted to take my grandson for pizza.  The help was not friendly and the pizza was mushy and undercooked.  We asked for it to be cooked a little longer and they acted put out.  Will not return.  Love Vinny's."}
{"text":"For almost 20 years, this was our go-to pizza place and I still like the pizza a lot but the service has gone so far downhill the last year or so that it's not worth it. If you call in a takeout order, it's rarely ready when they say it will be, and you have to wait in the same long line as all of the people placing new orders. Last time we tried to eat there in the restaurant, they lost our order and we finally got our money back and left. Too many other good choices for pizza to put up with this poor service."}
{"text":"Great NY style pizza, they have a few locations on the outskirts of Charlotte.my favorite are the huge pizza slices that you can build with toppings. This location is great for eat-in or take out."}
{"text":"Since some people rave about the Calzone I tried one with spinach and cheese. The spinach was frozen, meh. The cheese is bland, like always and this why you pour tomato or marinara on it.  The problem was the sauce that came with it was straight out of a can, tasteless  and I'm sure made from concentrate -not for me. 
All in all a boring, low rent Calzone. And the place is booming, the race to the bottom is on.

Tony's could have never gotten away serving this crap in the city, not in my days anyway."}
{"text":"On our way back to Vegas after visiting the dam. Wanted a small hometown place. This is it!  Pizza slice was great. So many toppings!  Garlic knots were great too. They were friendly and great food."}
{"text":"Nasty frozen mozzarella sticks sauce taste like it was mixed with salsa. Meatballs taste like blands balls of grey meat will not return!"}
{"text":"Pizza is good. Meatballs seem store bought. I wasn't impressed. Maybe because in not a newyorker. Wouldn't recommend going out of your way for a slice. Order delivery from elsewhere... Really it's not that great"}
{"text":"Ok so this is not fast pizza so if you need it in ten minutes and don't really care what it tastes like then this may not be your place.  If your kids want to see what it looks like to spin pizza dough in the air and then eat what they have just watched being made, try Tony's pizza.  This is outstanding thin crust pizza!  They do not skimp on toppings and their other offerings are just as good - spaghetti, calzone, wings, just awesome food and lots of it.  We always leave with extra."}
{"text":"Blah!  Get your grease bomb gut busters here! The most positive reviews are for what used to be Tony's Lounge, next door. The lounge is now called Jack's Place, and it's great for a beer and some decent food."}
{"text":"No more Tony's for me. Ordered through GrubHub. They extended the order by 1/2 hour, no big deal unless you're hungry and on a time table. Order delivered and 2/3 we're missing. Called and made to feel like I was lying and when the confirmed that they MADE the mistake because or this person and that person. So am I coming to get my missing food? No IT WAS DELIVERY! Well then call them. Not all customers are right. Most think they are. But when they are not wrong then offer at least the minimum of customer service."}
{"text":"This place is a great place to get NY style pizza. I myself am not a huge fan of thin pizza but my husband loves it. This place offers a pretty good menu selection. They have pasta dishes, cold sandwhiches as well as hot subs. Their chicken wings are not traditional in the sense they are battered, but they are huge and tasty.
They don't have a website so you can check out their menu, but this third party site has one for you to review if you are calling to do a take out order.

All and all for what you spend, it is a good value and the food is not bad."}
{"text":"The food was okay, but it came out cold which was weird because we waited 30 minutes for it. The price was a bit on the high side but not outrageous. For around the same price you can get Brixx or pizza from some of the other NY joints."}
{"text":"The Stromboli is my favorite. The Calzones are very good also. The pizza is good. The Philly steak and cheese is not their best offering."}
{"text":"Came here around 8:30pm and ordered two slices of pepperoni pizzas To go. 

The pizzas were pretty good i would say 4 stars! 

One negative, however, was that when I came in, they were mopping the whole restaurant. It made me feel not welcomed, like they were about to close which wasn't the case. It's also a slipping hazard. I would suggest they start mopping more towards the closing hour or once they lock the doors."}
{"text":"This is in the top 3 pizza places in the Charlotte, Lake Norman area. The others try but come up short."}
{"text":"Most of the time, I think this is the best pizza in Charlotte. I mean, I like different styles, so I do go other places, too. But if you want \"NY Style\" pizza, this is the place. 

Fresh ingredients, a chewy, hand tossed crust, and just right pizza sauce. Great stuff! 

One negative note. If you are going for slices, Tony's only allows Cheese or Pepperoni on \"slice\" orders. To get it just how you want it, you have to order a whole pie. 

Easy parking, open for lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"We drove past this place a million times, but actually seen it when we went to the ATM and I am so glad we did. Located right off of W.T. Harris blvd in worthington Shoppes. Friendly staff, authentic pizza and a nice dinning area. 
They really put thought into the pizza. From the first bite to the last the standard of quality is there. Delicious sauce to cheese ratio. Crust was nice and crunchy. Definitely a 5 star for experience and taste."}
{"text":"Great food good pizza. Walked all around the downtown area looking for something good to eat the aroma comingg out of this restaurant was amazing. A tomato basil pizza and a sausage pepperoni pizza, garlic balls
And fried chicken.
Everyone loved it"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best Steak Sandwich on planet Earth. I've been going here for 15 years and it is ALWAYS perfect."}
{"text":"This is okay pizza, not great, or NY style by any means. I have traveled to NY for work and eaten at Grimaldi's, Lombardi's, Paulie Gee's and other establishments there. Crust is crisp with a slight butter roasted taste, covered in a slightly spicy sauce where the herbs are not overpowering, covered with real mozzarella cheese, topped with delicious sweet sausages, kickin fresh pepperoni, or veggies. Each has it's own spin on their \"pies\" but always true to being great NY pizza you crave. Thin and never soggy sagging slices. 

*Sigh*"}
{"text":"Jose R. had it right:  the BEST NY-style pizza in the Charlotte area, and, dare I say it, the best outside of NYC!  Yeah, I dare say!
Not knowing what to expect, I ordered a couple slices and a drink.  Totaled less than $8.  It took them all of 4 minutes to call me up to get these things.  And I say \"things\" cuz the slices are about the size of babies!  Man alive!  I started regretting ordering that second slice until I tried the first slice.  It was love at first bite!  The crust is perfect, not doughy or inflated, but not cardboard either.  the amount of sauce must have been calculated by some of NASA's finest b/c it was right on the money.  It's tangy, sweet, and flavored oh-so-well!  The ingredients used on each slice is fresh, to include the delicious cheese blend they use.  On the tables, they have a Italian herb blend shaker, Parmesan, crushed red pepper flakes, salt/pepper, and yes, even garlic powder!  
It was rough taking down the second slice...but with so much flavor begging to be devoured, I had to man-up and conquer the beast!  I recommend getting each slice individually, as the service is quick enough, and by the time you finish the first, the second is getting close to the \"too cold\" mark. 
Noosh!"}
{"text":"This is the second location I've visited and the experience is quite the same!  Great food for a great price.  I still think Tony's Pizza has the most consistently genuine NY-style pizza in town!  Their ingredients are fresh, hot, and oh! so yummy!
Located along the busy streets of Research Park doesn't help matters, however.  Navigating into the area is a bit tricky.  Once you make it, however, you'll be glad you braved the wilderness!  
They serve pizza by the slice...and my Quick Tip from the other location stands:  Start with one, and order as you go!  These things are gigantic!  I've decided to start calling them the Pizzilla slices!  Anyway...
Noosh!"}
{"text":"Great authentic NY style pizza. Call ahead or be prepared to wait as there is always a line. Interior could use some renovations, but I usually get it to-go."}
{"text":"Huge! Delicious! Beef pepperoni! Love love love Tony's Pizza! Can't say too much about the customer service because my husband picked the pizza up. Will definitely go back in the future."}
{"text":"Great pizza at a small price. Tonys is one restraunt in boulder city that really has good value with a great product. Real pizza here. The slices are awesome also.."}
{"text":"Great little place with multiple locations which have slightly different menus. Best calzone's in Charlotte and the Huntersville location has the best manicotti. It's a little more expensive for an Italian dinner (than some of their other items- right around $10), but it comes with a huge amount (& is always better the next day), plus a salad which although medium sized-rocks! It's Italian style with olives and banana peppers, but also fresh shaved Parmesan cheese which makes it, and is surprisingly mostly goodies instead of lettuce. Dinners also come with fresh baked bread- can't beat it for the price, or the good service. The pizza is thin style crust (NY) but they're HUGE, one piece fills me up and is only $2 or $3 I think. It's self service once you get past the counter but both locales have a wonderful dining room with plenty of space for busy evenings to chill out and eat in. One of my regular favorites!!!"}
{"text":"If you like Sicilian pizza, this is the place.  The Sicilian here is great.  The regular pizza is alright.  People like the really big slices, I just think the dough is dry like cardboard.  I enjoy the veal parm here.  The calzone and stromboli dough is like the pizza dough.  I like calzone and stromboli to have soft flaky dough, not touch, dry, cardboard dough."}
{"text":"Great pizza. They are inexpensive too!! They will deliver. My only complaint is that they close early on some nights."}
{"text":"In Charlotte it seems there is quite the shortage of \"good pizza\" and I say that very loosely. Everyone has their own \"perfect\" pizza, its all very subjective. 
Tony's has some pretty damn good pizza. We usually stay very simple when ordering pizza, and they succeed in doing it well! 
One of my favorite things about Tony's is when you order a large (19'') pizza, it barely fits in the box, so I feel like I am getting my moneys worth. Have also had garlic cheese bread which is very good, and they offer pizza slices, which you can't get everywhere. 
Crust is nice and crisp most of the time, they don't drown the pie in a ton of sauce. Staff is always very friendly and personable, which is a big bonus, as the majority of people you end up dealing with throughout your day are completely apathetic. 
Good solid place to get a pizza, they have won me as a fairly regular customer!"}
{"text":"WONDERFUL NY style pizza! You most definitely get what you pay for, HUGE slices, awesome amount of toppings, great tasting crust. One of the best slices of pizza in Charlotte."}
{"text":"First time there, got plain cheese pizza, very good, great sauce not too sweet or too bitter, hit the spot. Mozzarella sticks were good. People were really nice, held the door for me when I left. Fair prices too-2 med pizza & motz sticks were less than $25. Will definitely go again."}
{"text":"After a evening of watching high school volleyball, we ordered 2 pizzas from Tony's.  We ordered a cheese pizza and a pepperoni/onion pizza.  Both pizzas were good."}
{"text":"Decent pizza with huge slices. You will definitely get your money's worth here. They have daily specials and discounts for the employees of neighboring businesses. Quick spot for lunch."}
{"text":"Excellent. Family ordered stromboli and the spaghetti & meatballs. Both were scrumptious!!!! Can't wait to go back and try the pizza!!!!"}
{"text":"My family and I came here for the first time and had a 24\" pizza (gigantic and lasted for 4 days) half sausage half supreme. Some of the best pizza I've had in my life and if I could I would eat here daily. The environment is friendly, the wait isn't long, and the smells are amazing. We also had cannoli and they were beyond delicious as well."}
{"text":"The best supreme pizza in Charlotte! And don't miss the steak and cheese sub Tony's way! It's a little pricey, so I don't eat here as often as I would like, but it is worth an occasional splurge!"}
{"text":"Use to be really good. The last year or so every time I go I've been very disappointed. The pizza just taste like cardboard now. The wings were really good (why im giving 3 stars instead of 2)but now that I don't eat meat that doesn't matter. It also always smells funny inside. Not to sure as to what it smells like just something a bit off."}
{"text":"Awesome place for Pizza.  Other than pizza, their pastas are not made on-site simply put together at the restaurant.   Most desserts are from a food service and not made there. 

Pizza is awesome if that's what your going for.   I've had their manicotti, egg plant parmesan, chicken Parmesan, and their spaghetti.... All 4 dishes taste relatively the exact same.  

The bread the meals come with is just a warmed tough roll.   They should start giving the option of garlic knots instead of French bread loaf."}
{"text":"Not the best pizza I have had but certainly not the worst. We got a medium and couldn't eat half. (2 people). Seemed a little pricey for nothing special. $35 for a medium pizza (3 toppings) a chef salad and 2 fountain drinks. Now it is hand tossed and fresh, but you order at the counter then go back and pick it up. There are no waiters. Overall, I would go back, we would just order a small and skip the salad."}
{"text":"By far my favorite restaurant in Charlotte and i have lived her for 14 years. The best part about this place is getting something off the menu that normally wouldn't be good at an Italian restaurant like wings or french fries, and then they taste AMAZING!!  Their wings are so good, their fries are too, the pizza is amazing and if you get a large it is enough to feed a family for two days, the salad is really good too they top it with fresh mozzarella cheese, but by far my favorite things at tony's are their subs. Their subs are the best in town and they destroy the subway right next door my personal favorite is the chicken parm. Sub but the meat ball and all of the others are good too. One last thing the environment is so welcoming and the staff is really nice. To sum it up you can get anything on the menu and it will be AMAZING!!!!"}
{"text":"First visit. Friendly phone order. Huge pizzas. Their small is like Dominoes large. Thin crust that is not too crispy but reheats well which is huge for me especially with the size of these pies. & is crispy with reheat. Either way it's good crust. Toppings are pretty fresh and ample. I also couldn't resist trying the tiramisu and I'm so glad. Yum!  I will definitely be returning to repeat pizza & tiramisu and look forward to trying other things."}
{"text":"Blech. After doing a full day of yard work we were  looking forward to someone else cooking. What a waste of money. Over cooked dried out chicken fingers. Boring ravioli in a bland red sauce. Overly salted meatball. Burned garlic bread. The four young men \"manning\" the counter were more interested in watching the world series than tending to their jobs. Never again. Jack's right next door or Milos are much better choices."}
{"text":"Great pizza! Reminds of NY asp steak sandwich was off the charts and the wings were super crispy and yummy"}
{"text":"Tony's is one of the last things I ate in the University area before moving to WS. Well WS, has a chain too called Mario's that is part of the Tony's family and we found it by accident so I've had the chain recently too! :)

Tony's is pretty good! I have had \"awesome\" pizza and this is pretty darn close to it. The crust is crispy yet limp enough so it doesn't cut the sides of your mouth and the cheese is gooey and the pepperonis have a hint of spicy. The portions are huge and a small pizza can feed AT LEAST 3 hungry people with left overs!! 

I think one of the things I like the most is the Chicken Parmesan dinner. It comes with a fantastic salad, bread, chicken parm and spaghetti. It takes forever getting it but it is worth it. My fiance and I always share and it is just enough where we don't take anything home but we are really full because we just stuffed our faces! 

However, in the days of extremely fast service, this is definitely not one of those places. If you know what you want and it isn't by the slice...I would CALL AHEAD!! Save yourself a good 15-20 minutes of waiting. Especially since you most likely drove through the heck that is Harris traffic during rush hour to get to the location.  (Dinner time!)

Overall, a good place for food! 

Oh and as a special side note, don't forget that some companies and students get a discount on special days! :)"}
{"text":"Tony's is a MUST anytime I make it to Charlotte!  

My sister lives less than a mile away so throughout the years we've ended up at Tony's on several occasions - lunch, dinner, snacks, celebrations.  And surprisingly it never disappoints!  Their giant pizza slices are definitely the way to go, as it only takes one to fill me up.  And their garlic knots are quite scrumptious - so plan on getting a couple orders if you're a carb addict like myself!"}
{"text":"Biggest pizza I've ever had. We ordered 3 XL pizzas for 10 people and we had way to much. Good flavor, no complaints. Pretty cool wow factor when you walk in with these huge pizzas!!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal New York Pizza! One if the best pizzas I have ever had in my life. Very delicious. The service was top notch here and very fast as well. It is very affordable pricing along with a cozy setting. :) Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This place probably packs them in later in the day, my friends and I had stopped in just before noon on a Tuesday and there was lots of foot traffic along this street.  And I'd say they bring in the people here for a few reasons.  1. is a great location along this main drag in Blouder, they have a covered sidewalk as well that sits along side other eat places that make for one large, festive eat area to relax in.  2. their pizza arrives good and hot and it's very tasty, and not too much crust to weight you down.  Cold beer along with a full bar!  And 3. a gal working the bar with a knock out body!!  I mean, bam!  I would say with the proximity to Vegas she could have been an ex-showgirl type...  Tall and CURVY!  Wow!

(calming down) Anyway, if I ever get back to Vegas I'd for sure venture up this way at night to check out the small town vibe and have some great eats here. ;o]"}
{"text":"Pizza is not all that, but it is better than the chains. The place could use a bit of a sprucing up and the bathrooms are a bit better than CBGB's. They have live music periodically and I am not sure if they are a Philly bar or a NYG bar....they have stuff from both. The late night menu stops at 8pm apparently, so if you expect to drink and nosh...you probably had better bring your own snacks"}
{"text":"Wonderful staff treat customers well. Always hot fresh food! Huge pizzas for a reasonable price. Clean as well!"}
{"text":"Food is great, but the system of ordering and picking up food sucks. I call ahead, arrive 10 mins before my food is ready, and wait in line for another 30 minutes trying to get my food. They really need to come up with a system to get food out quicker. The same person takes all orders, answers the phone, gets the food, and passes it out. If the person ordering is slow and doesn't know what they want, everything stops."}
{"text":"DO NOT ORDER FROM HERE!!! We ordered dinner at 5:30, and it said it would arrive by 6:55. We did not get our food until 8:55. Two hours late. When we called the store, they were extremely rude, and when the food arrived, it was disgusting and ice cold after sitting in a car for over two hours. My husband's meatball sub was completely inedible, and my baked ziti made me violently ill. We also never received the garlic knots that we ordered. I repeat, DO NOT ORDER FROM HERE!!!"}
{"text":"Great, NY Style Pizza.. I'll go across town for takeout!  But what I will never do is dine in there again!  The place was a mess...the tables hadn't been wiped down, used napkins were all over the floor.  The had a 96 sanitation grade & appeared to stay busy, by the no one is paying attention to their dining room.  They should take the time to sweep and wipe down all the tables on a regular, consistent basis!"}
{"text":"Time and time again this place never disappoints. It's all about the crust and their dough is amazing. Fresh ingredients and a friendly staff. Best NY pizza in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Pizza by the slice are VERY large. Great garlic knots! It's in the parking lot with food lion. Nice atmosphere inside and quick service. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Wow, great pizza at a great price.  The single slices are huge.  Garlic knots are very good as well.   Nice place for lunch."}
{"text":"This place easily has the best pizza in Charlotte or surrounding areas. Huge slices if you don't want your own pizza!"}
{"text":"The slices of pizza are good however the last time I went in there a while back the rating was low hopefully it came up by now"}
{"text":"Came in for lunch with my boyfriend and kid. We had pepperoni pizza, hot wings and garlic knots. Service was quick and they were really nice. 
The wings are really good. Probably my favorite thing. 
The garlic knots are pretty good too. We got them so quick we had to wait a few for them to cool down. 
The pizza was pretty greasy but tasty. Will be back."}
{"text":"I like their huge pizzas. I like more sauce on mine than they actually add. I always ask for extra sauce. Quality products are used. The staff are pretty cool. Clean."}
{"text":"Pizza by the slice is good, but don't get the Italian sausage sandwich.  They cut the sausage into coin-size slices!  Lame.

Service is super slow.  Try waiting 30 minutes for a sausage sandwich.

Just come here and get a slice or two of the pizza.  Then feel bad afterwards because of all the carbs you just ate."}
{"text":"It seems people fall into one of two camps w/Tony's and there isn't an in between. I fall in the 'No thanks' camp. The crust has no flavor and is like card board, no fabulous NY style cheweyness. Poor quality toppings served on cheap, flimsy paper plates w/cheap, flimsy paper towels. Use better products and spring for more ecofriendly & effective paper products with some of that profit you amass from your misguided yet loyal fans. ;)"}
{"text":"Awesome huge slices of New York style pizza.  Perfect amound of sauce and cheese on a chewy & crisp crust.  Pizza came out hot and fresh!  Staff was happy and accommodating.  Bing bang for your buck!"}
{"text":"Ate here last night and I enjoyed the best calzone I've ever had! The ham was so good and it was stuffed with delicious cheeses that tasted super fresh! My wife had the baked ravioli which she enjoyed and the garlic knots were tasty as well!"}
{"text":"Awesome pizza. A bit greasy, but in a tasty way."}
{"text":"We called and placed an order for pick up the pizza was really good, but we asked for deep crust and didn't receive it. Garlic knots were good. Wings were ok but they had a spice on there that was different and we didn't prefer, but my husband still ate them. Good customer service though."}
{"text":"This is the best NY pizza I have had. It beats most places in NYC! Staff is friendly. I usually get the beef pepperoni pizza, although their normal cheese is great too. My team at work orders the spinach calzones, and they are also a must try. They have two locations, so if you are in the area, they are must try!"}
{"text":"Now I remember why I rarely get pizza here - they are super expensive! The pizza is very good however! Authentic NY style (as authentic as you can be in NC). The toppings were $2 each. I didn't realize how expensive it was until I went to pick up 3 large pizzas with 2 toppings each - $64!!! The pizza was good tho!"}
{"text":"Been eating the pizza here for years! Still our favorite. The large is huge with big ol' floppy slices."}
{"text":"Best pizza I have had in Charlotte. They sell it by the slice too, so go try it. When I say slice I am talking the size of half a medium pizza a most places. I personally love their plain old cheese pizza. Their meatball sub is fantastic, great bread with cheese melted on top, cheese steaks are also good, not the best ever, but better than most, Pastrami sub gets a notable mention and I hear the chicken parmigiana sub is good but have not tried it.  Food quality is always consistent."}
{"text":"Pizza is better than average for a NY style pizza, the crust is a little soft for me, but I love that  they have beef pepperoni. Still, I have definitely tasted better in the city. But this is a solid pizza spot with a great menu and lots of options other than  pizza to choose from"}
{"text":"We went last Friday night and it was very busy.  It was our second visit after a long break since the first.  The place is nothing fancy but has a good following.  To begin with,  the restaurant could have been cleaner.  The floors and tables had not been cleaned for a while. We were there for at least an hour and I did nor see anyone go around and clean up. Secondly, it took a very long time to get our pizza and they got the order wrong.  They offered to fix the order and it took another long wait to get the additional slices.  We had a mushroom pizza and I noticed that the color of the mushrooms was different than you would usually expect. My astute 12 yr old son said they were probably from a can which may have been the case. Nevertheless, the pizza was pretty good.  They make a thin crust that I prefer.  The slices are big and a medium size is big enough for a family of 4. We will return soon but I will check on the mushrooms before ordering. They need to do periodic cleaning of the dining room during the night."}
{"text":"My favorite place to get pizza! The XL is gigantic!"}
{"text":"Give Tony's a try while in Boulder. It's a small mom and pop pizza place. It's a small establishment with big tasty pizza. 
We ordered a meat pizza and the garlic twists which we enjoyed while sitting outside. 

Prices, service, atmosphere and pizza was great. I will be back and get photos this time."}
{"text":"As a native New Yorker, good pizza is hard to come by in the QC, but Tonys really comes pretty close.... If you are into their oversized slices, or taking home a pie, the pizza is great.  The wings are really good too!"}
{"text":"I found this place on Yelp, and I decided to
give it a try! 
The pizza was delicious! Even though it took more than 30 minutes to get our pizza, it was worth it!
We were two and ordered the 16, and was huge!! We had to ask for a box to go!
We will come back for sure, but next time will be to go. 
We felt being kicked out... We arrived at 8:40 ordered immediately, but since we had to wait that long we were rushed to finish. (They close at 9:30). We just ordered a box and finish the pizza at home. 
We will call to order a pizza to take home next time because we loved it!"}
{"text":"We found the place to be a rather rare (for Nevada), pizza parlor clip-joint. They post one price but ring-up another. I would never patronize this place again."}
{"text":"Great lunch place,  Authentic NY style pizza.  Slices are huge, great garlic knots.  Lots of seating.  Staff very friendly.  A great find."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of Tony's.   The pizza is always fresh, the ingredients are large, and the pie is hot.   Out of 30 or so times of ordering pizza at this specific location, I have never been disappointed.  When my folks come down from VA they demand to go eat here for lunch, with or without me.

The service is not exceptionally good but I an overlook that for a few moments of folded pizza, greasy fingered goodness.  I highly recommend this spot for those that enjoy pizza."}
{"text":"Great little place over by the Galleria shopping center (near the Wal-mart and corner of Sardis Rd. North and Monroe intersect).

Went here for dinner and split a pizza with my buddy.  They make it fresh - always fun to watch your pizza crust being tossed in the air :)  It does take a little bit of time to make it fresh so don't go here if you are in a hurry!  We got a 15 incher and it was pretty huge.  Naturally, I ate my half with no problem - decided to go with mushrooms and sausage.  I would call it a winning combo.  My buddy was not eating meat at the time so he went with tomatoes and green peppers.... not as fun as the meat and mushrooms, but luckily they are able to split the pizza with toppings so there's no arguing for 30min over what topping should be on the pizza.

Crust was great and the ingredients tasted good too... be ready to fold your pizza over and scarf it down NY style!"}
{"text":"Thus place is awesome , it reminds me of the pizza slices in Washington, D.C. Adams Morgan."}
{"text":"The wings are the best in town!!!! I love the pizza, but only if it's served hot right out the oven...  We order take out most of the time, i prefer hot fresh pizza from tonys."}
{"text":"My favorite local spot to grab a pie. Pretty close to some good New York pizza. They also have the largest pizza I have ever seen here! Delicious!"}
{"text":"We had the slice of cheese pizza, salad and drink special. Pizza was made fresh. Crust was crispy and the pizza tasted great. Salad was OK too; but mine was a bit overdosed in Italian dressing. Portions were generous. Service was courteous and fairly prompt. Wish they would also sell pepperoni or sausage pizza by the slice. But would go back here again next time we're in Boulder City."}
{"text":"Usually a good experience until lately. Why did you start tossing your wings in sauce for to go orders? I typically wouldn't mind but you don't use a sealed container, just styrofoam...I know have wing sauce in my car upholstery.

Go back to not tossing wings for to go orders or put them in a sealed container"}
{"text":"Literally not only the best pizza, but their wings extra crispy are where it's at! They could update their decor because the dead tree in the middle kills the vibe! But the food it great!"}
{"text":"Horrible customer service!! Conflicting times on google 10pm and website/restaurant 9:30. Nevertheless my family and I got there at 9pm, which is plenty of time.  We couldn't even decide what we going to eat because the guy who took our order kept saying we close in a few and we needed to hurry up.  My husband ordered and the guy then said we'd have to get the food to go because again they closed in a few??? We left and won't be back. We choose to to give our business to Hawthorne's pizza down the road."}
{"text":"Service was good , price was good ordered sausage parm hero with extra cheese. 
 Wasn't thinking got half way thru found out they made me a chicken parm. 
 It was dry and I didn't say anything till I was going to leave it was late. 
 I just let them know I was not one of those type that would eat the whole thing then say I ordered something else and insist. These are good people here. 
 Rating is for not paying attention."}
{"text":"Being from Philly makes it hard to judge pizza outside of home or New York. This pizza had a good dough, crust flavor, and good sauce. Something about the cheese made it not like home, but i guess it was as close as you can get in Charlotte. Restaurant seems clean and to run smoothly. Service was fast and good. Took a pizza to go which was still warm when we got home. Cost was comparable to back home but not sure it fits the area it's in, may be too pricy for location."}
{"text":"Ordered a 19\" pepperoni, extra cheese, and extra sauce.  The pizza tasted great, this is our current favorite place to get pizza from.

The cheese tastes great and the crust is thin and light.  For me pizza is basically a piece of bread with a bunch of cheese on it, and the cheese is the most important part otherwise you are just eating a big hunk of bread.  This place has the cheese down.

My constructive criticism is that on the pictures of the different pizza sizes, from a personal all the way up to a 24\" pizza, they show them covered in pepperoni without any bald spots of cheese, but the actual pizza has about 1/2 the pepperoni you see in those pictures.  My pizza partner doesn't like pepperoni so she was happy about the lack of it, but I am the pepperoni craving partner and I wasn't happy that they depict a much more densely covered pizza than what you end up getting.

I would like them to update and change the picture or put as much pepperoni as pictured on the actual pie."}
{"text":"We're actually pretty fond of this place. The only thing is when you walk into a restaurant with this kind of atmosphere, the decor is usually pretty cheap. I've only eaten here a handful of times. The employees were always nice, but the food takes forever. Seating is also great.

I'm not a big fan of thin and greasy pizza. My thing is Papa John's. Thin and greasy pizza has never really had any flavor besides what I just listed. I do like their chicken, lettuce & mayo sandwich though. And their garlic rolls are good too. I would go back."}
{"text":"Not bad, but not great. Variety is good and the price is reasonable. However I've had better at new York pizza on south blvd."}
{"text":"Tony's Pizza is located in the heart of the Historic Business District off Nevada Way. Today when I attended the 54th Annual Art in the Park Festival, I paused here for a quick and inexpensive bite to eat. 

  The prices at Tony's Pizza in comparison with the food concessions at Art in the Park was reasonable. They offer specials including two slices with a large Coke for $6; or a slice of pizza with fries, and a large Coke for $6.50. I chose the two slice special. 

   In contrast to the neighboring Milo's Cellar, Coffee Cup, and Art in the Park ; Tony's Pizza was nearly empty. There was zero effort finding a table in the small restaurant. I chose the table closest to the Coke machine. If I had chosen a few tables down, I'd be overlooking historic Nevada Street. Regardless, a few minutes later I was overlooking two slices of pizza. 

  The two slices of pizza were decent. I wouldn't go out of my way for this pizza, but if it is in my way in the heart of Historic Boulder City while my appetite is acting like a monkey pounding on my back, I might return here."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Charlotte. Huge slices with excellent crust. The subs are excellent as well. I have been here over 20 times and have never had a bad experience. This is the best location of all the Tony's in the Charlotte area."}
{"text":"The pizza is the best in Charlotte IMHO.   Service is always fast and pleasant.  It can get very crowded with takeout customers on Friday nights and Saturday afternoons.  The pizza is terrific NY style thin crust and very large pies.   The subs are also very good as are the salads.  The hot entrees are very generous and tasty, my favorite is the lasagna or the steak and cheese \"all the way\" if not ordering pizza."}
{"text":"Tucked into a little strip center on one side of the Galleria shopping center (near Five Guys and Jimmy Johns), Tony's Pizza serves up some pizza and other Italian specialties.

I'll have to admit to not giving them too much of a chance here, as I was just in the area for a short while, and figured I'd see how it was for a slice, so that's all that I had.

One thing is for sure: Don't go if you're in a hurry at lunch, because they are packed!  It's actually pretty surprising, because you would only expect to see this sort of crowd if you were uptown or someplace, but this joint was really hopping.

The orders came out in good order, though, and overall the pie wasn't bad.  Nothing really special, but it was a decent lunchtime meal.  I'll probably stop in again when I have more time to sit down and enjoy it."}
{"text":"Solid pizza from a simple store front location - while you can likely eat your pie there, it's not a place you would want to hang out and linger for a long dinner.

If you go at lunch, they have a fairly standard slice and drink combo, but it's a bit on the pricey side for what you get, though you can likely make do with one slice and a drink and save the second slice for dinner, or even for breakfast the next day, so there is that."}
{"text":"I have passed by Tony's for a while now and the other night I finally decided to try it out. We ordered a large pepperoni & sausage pizza. Boy was it good! Share it was on the greasy side but I always expect that from NY style pizza. I really enjoyed the crust! If you don't finish your pizza just have the rest the next day! This style of pizza is always my favorite for leftovers! I will be back don't worry!"}
{"text":"Just moved to the area and looking for my new pizza joint.

Got the same order as always: small supreme pizza, pepperoni & black olive calzone, and extra crispy hot wings.

Pizza - the dough was good.  The amount of toppings was great and the cheese was good.  Big complaint - not enough sauce on the pizza.  Really was just dough and toppings

Calzone - again, the dough was good, but there was a large amount of crimped dough around the outside of the calzone that I just peeled off and threw away.  The toppings in the filling were great.  Big complaint again, no ricotta cheese.  HUGE mistake.  Must have ricotta in a good calzone.  Also got a side of sauce and the sauce was a great balance - not too sweet, not to acidic.  Would loved to have it more on the pizza.

Wings - the biggest disappointment by far.  These were breaded frozen wings before they fried them.  To their credit, they did fry them to extra crispy, but a breaded wing is not a good wing... They even had to put the sauce on the side in a dish because a sauced breaded wing falls apart to nothing. That is not what I was looking for at all.  I wanted a traditional, fresh, unbreaded wing fried til the skin was crisp with a buffalo sauce.  I would never order these again.

Overall, I know there are chains in the area where I could probably get a pizza I like more, a similar calzone, and these wings were just bad"}
{"text":"Soooo good.
Sooooo authentic.
Best NY style I've found in and around Charlotte. A simple cheese can bring tears of joy to my eyes and stomach!"}
{"text":"Pretty good pizza. Crust is thin but a little crunchy. Definitely the best pizza in this area"}
{"text":"I've eaten at all the pizzerias here in boulder and Tonys pizza tops them all . I can't tell you when I had better pizza. I always order the vegitarian pizza and it's amazing. Everyone should try Tonys you will never want any other pizza."}
{"text":"This place was ok. It was rather dirty and the pizza was unimpressive. Most definitely not the best place to go for pizza, but it can make for a fun night going to BCs Main Street and hanging out with friends."}
{"text":"Hit or miss with this place and lately mostly miss. When the older lady is managing the kitchen, the chicken wings are well sauced and crispy and the pizza is not too greasy. Like another poster mentioned, when Bevis and Butthead are running the kitchen the food is not good.  Also, the bathrooms are never clean and the bartender often stops for a cigarette, I like low tar with my beer but that is just me. Anyway, this establishment used to be my favorite but until the consistency returns and Mama Celeste is always in the kitchen then this place will be a miss. I gave this 2 stars for old times sake."}
{"text":"So glad we wondered into Tony's pizza! Love the home made pizza, garlic bread was alright not great. Prices are terrific! Will definitely be back! Paid $4.85 for the slice and two pieces of garlic bread. Not bad at all."}
{"text":"I was aware of the fact that they were really busy that day. I ordered a large pizza, two toppings to go. I was told it would be roughly 20 minutes.  I always figure it would take 30-35 because I have worked in a kitchen before and I know how hectic it can get.  That being said, I got my pizza after waiting 63 minutes. Sorry, that's insane.  The pizza was good, nothing special but had I known it would have taken that long, would have not placed my order."}
{"text":"This place is very straight forward. They make have a very limited menu of things that they make very well. And its very affordable

They are in a row of restaurants and know how to separate themselves from the other businesses. With great value and good product. It was busy because there was a spring festival going on.

My kids had the chicken fingers (as usual). It was a big portion and came with a mountain of tasty fries.

I had the pizza. The slice was pretty big like a New York pizza slice. The crust was good, so was the sauce.

Service is no nonsense, you order at the window and they bring it out to your table.I cant say anything unpleasant about it.

The people watching was great too! 

Overall, a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"Ok pizza..... nothing great. If you transplanted this place and put it in NY then it wouldnt stay open too long. The slices are quite large but the Ny style just isnt there. The closest pizza i have found to back home is Due Amichis."}
{"text":"Very good NY style pizza. Their pies are HUGE. Note yelp says they deliver but they do not (unfortunately)."}
{"text":"I tried Tony's for the first time tonight.  This is by far the best, most authentic New York style pizza in the Charlotte/Huntersville area.  I got a 15\" Tony's Special and it was delicious!  I wasn't quite sure if 15\" would be big enough for a few people, but it was more than enough food.  They are very generous with the toppings.  Called my order in on Friday evening and it was ready in about 20 minutes - no wait once I got there.  A little pricier than some other pizza places, but you're not going to find the same quality at many other places.  Would recommend!  I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"great pizza and huge portions this is some really good stuff. They are really friendly and this is a hell of a deal its the size of three slices at any chain and they taste amazing. The only thing that could be better are there sides but still this place is worth a shot for a pizza lover"}
{"text":"Stopped at Tony's pizza on the way back from Hoover Dam.
Small restaurant  (probably seats about 10 people.
Food was okay.  Nothing to brag about.
Pizza was greasy.
Would try another restaurant before heading back to Tony's."}
{"text":"I love love love Tonys pizza... Fresh, comforting, and great price... also fast service... I'm a regular and eat there 2-5 times a week!!!"}
{"text":"I always order a slice of pepperoni pizza and chicken wings! Comes out delicious every time! I love consistency and no matter what time or day I go, the food is always good! I've had the garlic knots before and they are yummy but I like to stick with the originals."}
{"text":"I guess I will have to give it another chance but pizza and knots were dry .. hopefully it will grow on me it's next door .. have had better in Charlotte, Luigi's Mellow Mushroom and others"}
{"text":"I have eaten here before and they were okay. I recently called for a delivery and they were very rude on the phone. They could've just nicely said that they don't deliver by me I'm literally an exit away from them - 5 miles away from me that is too long? I will not be visiting them again!"}
{"text":"If I was going to get pizza in the University area of Charlotte, I would probably go here.  Very good NY style pizza.  

I was surprised when I ordered the wings though.  I thought they were going to be hot wings.  When they came out they were plain breaded wings with a few packets of Texas Pete hot sauce.  I was pretty disappointed at first but after discovering how to fix them up, I was pleased.  The wings are plain but they are good and juicy.  What I did, is I poured the Texas Pete all over them and than covered the wings in Parmesan cheese.  Very Good!"}
{"text":"The Butcher gives this spot a razors edge above the rest. I myself a true New Yorker know GOOD,GREAT, PHENOMENAL, PIZZA! and Tony's is near perfection. they got the formula...big slices, thin crust, great sauce and real cheese.  i mean one slice is like 2 slices with extra still to go around! pound for pound best slice of pizza spot and good quality atmosphere."}
{"text":"We grabbed lunch at Tony's today and the food was just what we needed! The pizza was fantastic - I ordered the ultimate which has cream cheese on it and it was sooo good and unique. The wings were crispy (not rubbery like some places can be) and well sauced. The garlic knots were amazing, very crispy on the outside and soft on the inside with delicious marinara dipping sauce.  Our bill after ordering a ton of food was the icing on the cake... Very affordable! 

We sat outside and enjoyed the sunshine while also getting to enjoy the company of our dogs while going out to lunch. It all made for a perfect day!"}
{"text":"Was in town last week apartment shopping and stopped in to get a slice. Being from New York I have to admit that finding authentic NYC Tasting isn't easy down here. But Tony's is pretty good & the slices are huge."}
{"text":"OK pizza, good entrees, nice people.  I have been here a few times and have never had a negative experience.  The pizza slices are very large. I have had better pizza, but it does the trick if you are hungry.  The crust is too crunchy for my taste and the pieces too thin.  I also prefer more of a thick, marinara sauce instead of their thin, very tomato-y sauce.  A lot of people may prefer it Tony's way, though.

The service is good and there never is much of a wait.  They get through a crowd quickly, which is nice if you're in a hurry.  The prices are decent."}
{"text":"I came here for a quick lunch pick up one day.  The staff was there to greet me when I walked up to the counter and everyone was really nice.

The pizza was fresh and there was a great variety of different kinds to choose from.  There were an abundance of lunch specials with pasta as well. 

The store was clean and nicely organized.  The layout was great.  My order was taken care of very efficiently and quickly, which I appreciated since I was on my lunch hour.  

Will definitely try again!!"}
{"text":"Waited 30 minutes for three slices of pizza and an order of wings. The place was empty. So ridiculous."}
{"text":"Not sure what happened here but Tony's used to be pretty good but it's just not that great anymore.  It turned into a real hit or miss type of  place and the last few times have been all misses. We actually threw away the leftovers tonight & sorry to say I think we are writing this place off at this point.  Tony's is pretty convenient to our house but even that's no longer enough to keep us coming back."}
{"text":"We lucked out and ordered our food right before the line exploded to be 10+ people deep.  It still took 45 minutes to get our food, so I really felt bad for all the people behind us that likely waited much longer.  The pizza was tasty with a thin crust and a crunchy edge to it.  The large was huge, one slice could easily fill a light eater up.

The largest table seats 6 people and there are no chairs that aren't affixed to the ground to add to your table.  We had to sit in two of the large booths that back up to one another.  This restaurant would greatly benefit from expanding their space.  There were not enough tables for everyone waiting for food.  There also isn't really a waiting area, so people end up just standing around the tables of people eating. I really wish that during their peak times they would turn off the door chime.  In the 90 minutes that we were there it went off SOO many times. It was driving me crazy!"}
{"text":"This place is disgusting. I dont know why everyone is giving this place good stars as everything is filthy here. Tables and chairs were old and covered with a film of grease or sticky substance. There were tons of flies within the restaurant. Staff that were pretty rude in my opinion. Most establishments greet you when you come in but no one said welcome, hi or even the \" how can i help you?\". The person at the counter taking orders even said \" what do you want?\". Giving this business the benefit of the doubt and tried the speciality pizza was down right awful. Got a supreme and it wasnt even cook throughly. The dough was chewy and raw. Got fried zucchini which was ok but some of them were burnt. I took a picture of the air vents above the soda machine and it looked like it hasnt been changed for years. (Picture has been uploaded). The bathroom had no soap or paper towels. I will most likely email health department as there is no way they shouldve passed with such a filthy restaurant."}
{"text":"Love their pizza, brick oven baked.  Quick service and when I get the food delivered to work it's faster than other pizza places in town.  Family owned and operated as well"}
{"text":"Tony's pizza is the closest thing in Charlotte to the pizza I grew up with in Long Island NY. Excellent!"}
{"text":"Tony's is a tricky spot for me. I always pick up a pizza, I live 10 minutes away, and I like my pizza piping hot. This requires some strategy. 

First, I have to find a parking spot close to Tony's (it's a big parking lot). Second, I have to decide if I should leave the doors unlocked for when I return with the pizza in my hands (every second counts). 

On this night, I got the second spot closest to Tony's, left the doors unlocked, speed-walked back to the car with the pizza, and found a guy in the backseat of the car next to me smoking a blunt. He casually nodded to me as he exhaled a plume of smoke, then his eyes widened when he saw my pizza (you know how that goes). I needed to depart immediately, just in case he decided to make a move for my pie. 

In order to get home while the pizza was still relatively hot, I took a shortcut, which is Kearns Rd. The only problem is that Kearns Rd. is a single-lane road and I was stuck behind some guy in a small, black Toyota Camry. 

Those are cool cars, but this dude drove like he owned the road and wouldn't let me pass, then he didn't signal until he was in the middle of his turn. Freaking Guy. It got to the point where I wouldn't signal because I thought if he knew where I was going, he would purposely go the same way because he knew I had a hot pizza. 

When I got home, the pizza was still hot, but sometimes the hottest things aren't the tastiest. Tony's used to be The Joint, now it's just \"a pizza joint.\" Maybe they had an off night, but it tasted a lot plainer than in the past. 

Please don't get the wrong idea. It's still good NY pizza; this rating is based on Tony's standards, which leads me to an important life lesson....

If a pizza place is called \"NY Pizza\" or the name has anything with the word \"NY\" in it, it's going to let you down. The real NY pizza places have an Italian name: Tony's, DaVinci's, Vinny's, Dominic's, Malachi's (j/k). 

I still recommend Tony's because it's better than most pizza, but I'm not in a hurry to go back."}
{"text":"Best pizza I've had in Charlotte, and I'm from up North so I'm very precise with how my pizza taste...up North is known for great pizza. But I can truly say...this pizza is amazing! The people are nice, and the pizza is a good price and a great size ! Definitely my number 1 favorite pizza spot !"}
{"text":"The best pizza in southern NV , They use top quality cheese and make a perfect crust.  to find better you would need to go to NYC or Chicago."}
{"text":"Calzones are excellent!! Pizza is really good too. If you come on Friday or Saturday night expect to wait a little bit, or call in your order."}
{"text":"Huge.   Their pizza is so huge it won't even fit in the biggest box they have.  A lot of the time, this is a problem.  Making up for awful tasting pizza.  Not the case here.

FANTASTIC.  

I've had pizza from here a few times, as my sister lives relatively close and when I go visit, I try to talk them in to pizza from here.  

It's an interesting place and very authentic.  The prices are very reasonable.  I've not tried anything but pizza, but I freaking LOVE pizza, and I LOVE their pizza here.

Note: I always just get cheese pizza because the kids like it more, but it's great."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza, I prefer well done so it is crispy in the middle. The lines are ridiculous on Friday and Saturday evening, but that speaks to the awesome pizza. They are fast and nothing but business attitude. Even in a strip mall the place seems to have some Italian character."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best NY style pizza places in Charlotte.  The pizza sizes are great for the money.... 19\" cheese pie for $16?...have them double slice it and it will feed a bunch of hungry kids.  I usually get a pie from here once a month and have never been disappointed and the pizza is very tasty cold the next day as well and even reheated, so leftovers never go to waste.

As far as I'm concerned this is one of the 3 best places for pizza in Charlotte, with the other 2 being Luisa's near Park Rd. shopping center and Portifino's at the Arboretum.

The atmosphere here is okay, nothing to write home about, no romantic dates here, but the pizza makes up for that.  Give it a try if you are frustrated with Jet's pizza or some of the local duds on Yelp that get 3-4 stars."}
{"text":"We telephone-ordered a pizza and chicken wings for pick-up. The caveat for the wings was that \"THEY MUST BE VERY VERY WELL DONE.\" Probably the order was confused because the wings were rare and the pizza had burned spots including a two-inch black bubble on the crust. Upon opening the containers, we immediately called the store and told the person who answered that the wings were definitely not what we had distinctly specified. Expecting they might respond with an offer to (1) redo and deliver them (2) redo and have them ready for pickup (3) apologize, we got none of the above. We did get a non-committal, disinterested sounding \"OK,\" followed by ten seconds of silence and a hang-up. We put the wings in the oven broiler but the pizza was a waste of money, time and tomato sauce."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service and amazingly fresh toppings. I always get the 10\" veggie pizza (I sound greedy, right? I might be lol). I have never had a bad experience here, even on their busiest days!! I've had instances where several employees have gone above and beyond for me. I has also see them do it for other customers. And did I mention how AMAZING the pizza is? You will taste the difference here...from the manager/owner on down to the cooks and cashiers, the entire staff is very personable. I was impressed from the very first time I visited this location, and it was my first experience with Tony's Pizza; it has been almost a year now. There are two other restaurants within walking distance and this is the  ONLY one that infrequent regularly....hence the reason they know my order LOL...two thumbs up and a full belly"}
{"text":"Their pull is huge pizzas, so if you need to feed a army or want a pizza to impress at a party, go for it. (They have normal size pizzas too of course.) Apart from that, it was completely average - nothing special in flavor, and run of the mill topping options. It was ok, but unless I'm in need of a giant pizza, I'd probably look elsewhere if I'm going out for pizza. My idea of a five-star pizza place is one where you look at the options and say, \"Wow, I never would have thought of that combo, but that looks amazing.\" (Like Andouille sausage, candied jalapenos, dollops of cream cheese and honey. Or blueberry, arugala, chevre, and crispy prosciutto with fresh mozzarella - best pizza ever to date. If you're ever in Tallahassee, FL check out Midtown Pies!) Anyone can make pizza. To excel, you have to venture off the beaten path."}
{"text":"Way too expensive for pizza. It's not bad pizza, it's good, not the best in Charlotte but good. Just way too much. 

$10 for two slices and a drink? Get real"}
{"text":"This place is the best it gets in North Carolina.  Many pizza shops try to compare to that New York pizza style, but fall short in execution.  I'll drive the extra 10 minutes just to get a huge sausage and pepperoni pizza, too big for the box.  I really love it!"}
{"text":"After meeting John on a fishing trip in san diego,  ca I mentioned that I am in the general area after I visit my grandfather in St. George utah and he told me where the pizzeria was located. On my way back to san diego I dropped by and ordered the fettuccine alfredo which came with garlic bread and both were HOT, FRESH and tasted great. John also recommended driving by Lake Mead and I also had the opportunity to see Hoover Dam  for the first time. Service and food were great for the price being a cook myself. 10-8-10"}
{"text":"Greasy pizza.  Nothing special flavor wise and the crust is nondescript.  The service is abhorrent.  The garlic knots were good.  

It is relatively inexpensive however you still don't feel as though you get what you pay for.   

The place stays busy as a result of good location.  Tourists don't know better and the three bars next door provide an abundance of drinkers who don't care."}
{"text":"We went to a class tonight which left us looking for dinner at 8 pm, We went a little further up to Tony's Pizza by Northlake and it was SO GOOD. Like SO, SO GOOD. Super fresh ingredients, not greasy, HOT HOT HOT and pretty quick! Only about 15 minutes from our house so definitely could be a new pizza spot during the week! Plus a medium gave us leftovers for tomorrow too! The plain side was mine and it has to be something in the sauce because it was fantastic!"}
{"text":"To categorize Tony's as \"your average pizza joint\" is by far one of the biggest mistakes one can make. Growing up on this pizza since elementary school, Tony's has never let my family and I down; in fact, believe it or not, they know us by name! Whether it is an afternoon drop by to grab a quick slice to ordering garlic knots, a large pie and their most decadent cannolis, their quick service and quality product makes it so there are no competitors in the area."}
{"text":"For a pizza spot its a grade A. BIG ASS slices of pizza only do 1 unless your hungry hungry... Only bad thing they close to early"}
{"text":"I didn't like the pizza. It lacked flavor. I had the medium Tony's style pizza. The customer service was great. Everyone was nice. Bit if I spend $25 on a pizza it should be bursting with flavor. Especially when I get a pizza with various flavorful toppings.I was very disappointed in the pizza. I probably won't be back to waste any more money!"}
{"text":"These guys are not my favorite pizza place in Charlotte but I will say that Tony's pizza is really good. Along with their great customer service you will be please with what you get."}
{"text":"Love this place. Some of the best pizza you can get in clt that reminds me of up north. Always got it as take out for a stay in/movie night when I lived on this side of town."}
{"text":"I usually love this pizza but the poor choice of crispy chicken ruined this meal.  The chicken was over cooked, tough and salty.  I waited over 20 minutes for this order.  

The cannoli was perfection but small for the $2.49 cost.  

I was unable to separate the burnt pizza from the cheese, so into the trash it went.  What a $14 waste.  Their pizza is usually amazing, and the wait is rarely this long."}
{"text":"Food was actually pretty good. The place was hopping, however in my opinion the staff could have been a bit more friendlier. If you are looking for something a little better than the norm such as Pizza Hut, Papa Johns etc. this is a good option to consider. Being it's not the norm expect to pay just a tad bit more."}
{"text":"I've only been to Tony's twice but already love this place. The food is great but I really like it because the staff is super friendly and the chefs go out of their way to prepare your food the way you order it. They always seem to be in great moods and I'm always in a great mood after I eat there!"}
{"text":"Despite all the pizza options in Las Vegas, this is by far the best tasting pizza around. We don't even mind the drive to Boulder City because the food is always great. Although, don't expect bubbly, overly friendly customer service. I sent my parents here and they weren't impressed with the service quality. The service isn't bad by any means but they're quite straightforward and monotone when taking orders over the phone and it can be a real turnoff for some but honestly, I love it. No annoying, unnecessary banter. Pizza tastes amazing and that's all that really matters."}
{"text":"A hillbilly on my street saw me walk into my house with pizza tonight. He asked where it was from. I said Tony's. He replied, \"Oh, Tony's? Over there on State? That place used to be good\". I asked if he wanted to see if it still was. He did. I opened the box and let him grab a slice. He ate it with one of the few remaining teeth in his mouth. He said it still is good. Tony's is good pizza. I am trying a lot of randomly selected pizza shops in Parma. It has a soft crust. There is a strong garlic taste. The cheese and sauce are both ok. Tony was working and he seems like a really nice guy."}
{"text":"The pizza is really great, very very tasty.  And cheap.
However, they really need to get a high pressure hose and some soap in there and CLEAN the place.  Whenever I have been in this restaurant, the floors and the bathrooms are just yucky dirty."}
{"text":"I would do 3 1/2 stars if I could.  It depends on what you get here but for the most part it is pretty authentic and done well.  

I use my husband as my \"is-this-pizza-good\" meter.  He is from NY so we realize that it is very challenging to compare an apple to an orange but why wouldn't we at least try.  If you've had the best then that is what you want!  

Tony's makes a pretty good pizza.  There's not much to it but the tip is typically crispy which is essential.  The sauce is decent..not my favorite but not ragu so we're good.  The crust is a little slim so I wish it was slightly thicker and crispier but I'll let that slide.

The meatballs are done well.  They are fresh and they have good flavor.  They are soft/tender, not chewy.  Meatball parm is pretty yummy.

Overall this place is decent.  If you're in the neighborhood it is worth stopping in for a slice of pizza."}
{"text":"Best pizza in charlotte just like ny sytle, i order the 24 inch pie real big cheese only this place only makes cheese pizza good i never order toppings with my pizza at tonys."}
{"text":"I've lived next to this place for about 2 years now and never stopped by. It's always pretty busy. 

I chose to stop here because I needed a quick bite to eat. I will preface this by saying that I don't know what a true New York style pizza is, but if this is it, I didn't care too much for it. I ordered a slice of cheese. The cheese tasted fresh, as well as the sauce. I didn't care for the crust- it was bland to me. The slice was huge, though. Well worth the price.

The staff gave the impression of the classic New York stereotype- RUDE. But all in all, I didn't feel welcome. No greeting, no smile, no warmth... just what I feel to be poor service. 

I'll stick to heading to the NoDa area or Dominoes if I want pizza."}
{"text":"Closet Thing to NY/NJ style pizza I've had since I lived here! This is my go too when I want a good slice!
Love it just with the dough was a bit crunchier."}
{"text":"Pizza by the slice, yippee!

I finally found NY style pizza by the slice. I ordered a slice of pepperoni, which was huge & delicious. Warm, great amount of sauce & cheese, in my mind, and a great thin, but not too thin the crust. I also ordered a side salad, crisp and delicious. 
I cannot wait to get back!"}
{"text":"It's 'za, brah!

Good NY Style pizza is why you want to come to Tony's.  They've got the monster, triangle slices that beg you to fold them in half before crushing it like your last meal.  The mushrooms are grey (not black, bleh), and the meatballs are also noteworthy.  

The restaurant itself is a bit of a dive, but my guess is that 90% of patrons are there for take-out.  

The largest pizza is huge, be warned.  If you order it, it over-fills the box and folds up some of the crusts on the outside just to fit in.  I'm not complaining about having more of this 'za, however - it's gooood."}
{"text":"Amazing pizzas! The slices are huge and the flavor is phenomenal! I would recommend getting a medium for about 5-6 people because the pizza is huge !"}
{"text":"We used to love this place but today was a disaster. It's it a new owner? Ordered a Greek salad and it came with Ken's dressing, used to be fresh. Ordered a pizza with fresh tomatoes and came with sun dried, not the same. It may be a long time before we come back."}
{"text":"Best NY style pizza around. If I wasn't afraid to get fat, I would eat here every day. All the staff are all very lovely too."}
{"text":"Our entire family has enjoyed their food for years! The service is great, the people are friendly and the pizza, wings, and meatball subs are wonderful. If you are ever passing through Boulder City on the way to Las Vegas or to Hover Dam, come eat at Tony's Pizza. You will be glad you did. Sherrill Graff istmpnv @ aol.com"}
{"text":"Tony's Pizza has great cheese pizza.  It is always so hot that if I don't wait a while, I will burn the top of my mouth!  Even when I know I shouldn't be eating pizza, I savor each bite because it is so good."}
{"text":"Just older first time foods great reminds me of NYC where I'm from for what I paid got a lot of food so worth it will order again  try it out if u haven't yet best food I had (take out since I got here and been here for a month)"}
{"text":"Just started getting this pizza. Randomly stopped in about 3 months ago and got some pizza. Wow! Best  pizza I had in years! The staff is incredibly nice! The pizza is always great! I love the Home made style and not chain style. I'll drive 25 minutes to get it and drive back home and it's still
Hot and fresh."}
{"text":"Had a meatball sub for lunch today.  Very tasty.  But SCREAMING hot.  Burned my mouth on the first bite.  So be careful!  Otherwise a good, solid sandwich at a competitive price.  Freshly made with only a short wait to be served.  Worth a repeat."}
{"text":"I've tried take-out pizza all over Charlotte but I'll have to say this is my go-to favorite. Always consistent and when I phone it in if they say it'll be ready in 20 minutes you can count on it.

Besides getting a 'The Worx' pizza today I also tried their Italian sub sandwich served \"Tony's way\". Man that was a tasty sandwich! Can't wait to try something different again!"}
{"text":"You want pizza? This is good pizza. Was in town for a family thing and found this place close to our hotel. We were all super hungry after having made the drive up to Charlotte, and man did this do the trick. I had to stop myself from eating too much."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE the customer service here. These guys are amazing!
The place is always clean...the staff is super friendly..and these guys really know how to make a pizza. 
Best NY style pizza in Charlotte, in my opinion."}
{"text":"For some reason Charlotte, which is filled with amazing food, has a tough time figuring out pizza and wings. After some recommendations, we decided to try a pizza from Tony's. Unfortunately, they don't deliver, but the location wasn't too far from our house. 

Overall, the pizza was great. In terms of NY style pizza, this is the best we have had so far in Charlotte. The pizza is thin and flavorful, and the crust is chewy and crispy. 

The slices are MASSIVE, too. We ordered and XL pizza and it could barely fit in the backseat of our car. 

If you are looking for good NY style pizza, I would definitely recommend Tony's."}
{"text":"Well we took a ride one night out to Boulder City and wanted something different. We decided we would try the town pizza it seemed busy so we thought it was going to be really a great place.
When walking in no one tells you what to do, there is no servers so you have to order and pay first then you can sit down and wait till your order is done.
We did not find anyone to be overly friendly or helpful just wanted to ring you up and get the order in.
They had a special with a pizza , Garlic knots, Chicken wings and a 2 liter soda. And we would not have known unless we didn't ask if they had any specials.
We and tossed back into get them looking fresh again, were not impressed at all. The garlic knots were good with some of the sauce on them. The pizza was kinda greasy but it had a ok taste pretty generic nothing to brag about.  The wings were like pre cooked not fresh at all, small a little over cooked maybe from reheating them and nothing you would want to get on a regular basis.
Over all we sat wondering why the place was so busy.
The only thing we can think is most of the people were from out of town and wanted some in expensive food and a lot of people are Pizza fans. They have a prime spot in town easy to walk to or park near by.
Would we go back? Maybe if we wanted to give it a 2nd chance, not sure at this point since my favorite place is just up from here.
Would we recommend? If you have to have pizza you have no other choice because they are the  only place right in town."}
{"text":"Originally from NY and transplanted in Charlotte by way of a new job, I have been looking for a nearby, local pizza place to make my go-to. Tony's Pizza is a strong contender! 

My mom and I both agreed that while we have had pizzas in NY with better crust/bread, the toppings, sauce, and sheer quantity you get at Tony's is pretty freaking awesome. We got a medium Sicilian and a medium NY style pizza - yes, I fully embrace my gluttony but I was in no way expecting this much pizza. It may seem expensive, but I promise you you will be satisfied and definitely no longer hungry. I look forward to returning to Tony's...once I finish these two bad boys!

I ordered pick-up around 5pm on a Thursday and both the pick-up line and the dining area didn't seem too crowded for what its worth. Send reviews mentioned horrible wait times. I had my pizzas in hand and out the door 30min after placing my order over the phone."}
{"text":"Visited on a Saturday night. Before ordering, I went in to wash up in the bathroom which was gross.  I've seen cleaner ones in gas stations. Obviously, no employee had looked in there for many hours. If I was alone I would have left, but my two friends wanted pizza.  So we sat down.  Most of the chairs were wobbly and felt like they were ready to collapse at any moment.
The garlic bread was mushy and undercooked.  The pizza was just OK but a little undercooked.  The young crew behind the counter needs to smile and act like they want to be there!  Better than Dominos, but then so is a frozen pizza."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza and service. We were in Boulder City antique shopping and were looking for lunch. I know we can get pizza anywhere but Tony's was great. It was quiet compared to the sports bar and diner next door. Would definitely recommend them if you're in town!"}
{"text":"I can remember Tony's when it still had pinball machines and a small pizza was under a buck.
I spent summers in Parma living with my aunt and uncle during the glory years in Cleveland.
Everybody had a good job and everybody thought that things were only going to get better.
I think about their double cheese pepperoni pizza's with fond memories and eating them while watching Ghoulardi's Shock Theater on Friday nights.

Ah,nostalgia!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Tony's at the Galleria and it will be the last we go.  It took them at least 35 minutes to get a calzone, stromboli and salad.  The salad was $7.25 and should have been $2.00.  Iceberg lettuce, brown at that and some feta and olives thrown on.  Of course, we got no salad dressing.
Don't go!"}
{"text":"Recently came back here and yes, the pizza and concept is still good, just not the execution.  Yes, I did go during the lunch rush, but it just seemed like I had to wait forever for two slices of cheese (reheated at that).

The slices are still huge (NY Style) and definitely filling, but something is left to be desired.  Can't really put my finger on it, but it may just have been a \"perfect storm\" that day when I came in.  It is probably because someone else that came in behind me got served before I did - or they stole my order but it does leave a bad taste in  your mouth.  Yes- it is the customer's fault, but I think they should have a better system instead of calling out orders that may or may not have been duplicated by different customers."}
{"text":"Great pizza, great price! I've heard people talk of it for 20 (?) years and wish I had come sooner. Great food!"}
{"text":"I will literally drive to Boulder City (from Vegas) just for the pizza. I'm addicted. The slices are huge! It's also a thinner crust, which I love. I haven't  tried anything else on their menu, I'm sure one day I will."}
{"text":"You like pizza....Tony's is the place in Charlotte!  The XL slices are enormous and can feed 5 to 6 people.  Their cheese is very flavorful as with pizza it should be. I was very happy with the sauce cheese combination as well as the crust not being super thick and overpowering the pie.  The salad was also great! The portion was humongous and full of the trimmings that come along with the salad.  It was enough the share as well.  When choosing a pie now, Tony's has set the standards.  Everything was fresh and prepared upon order, so nothing sits under heat lamps or pre made in the fridge.  If pizza is what you want...Tony's is where to go."}
{"text":"Tasty take out. The ultimate and roasted red are delicious! 

No gluten free crust but hopefully they'll offer it in the future!"}
{"text":"What a great neighborhood Italian joint.

Yes, they have great pizza.

They also have excellent subs.
The Italian is my favorite.

You can always count on fresh and consistently good food here.

You can dine in or take out. A great place to call in and order za and subs and bring home to enjoy. Support your local business cause pizza hut and subway really don't need your $'s."}
{"text":"Time to update an old 2012 review. The good news is, 93 check-ins later, Tony's remains a 5 Star part of my/my family's regular rotation. In fact, I'm here with my youngest waiting on pizza for him and a turkey sub for me as I type this out. 

For me, the go to's are almost always the pizza and subs. The pies are classics NY thin crust and the subs are still served on bread imported from a bakery in NJ featuring a perfect blend of light crunch on the crust and a soft, chewy interior.

This is quality food served at a fair price and while this location is the one I frequent the most, I've had similarly good food at locations across the area."}
