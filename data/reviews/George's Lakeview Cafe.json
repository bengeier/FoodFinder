{"text":"My mom and I went to check out the walleye at 2 in the afternoon. There was no wait and it was nice and quiet.   I have not had a fish fry since I moved here from Wisconsin. It was fantastic! You get a cup of claim chowder. 3 peices of walleye with a choice of baked potato, mashed potatoes or fries. You also get Cole slaw which my mom reviewed as very good. 

We come on Sundays for breakfast once in a while.  The half stack of french toast is also very good. Service is always quick and friendly."}
{"text":"Worst meal EVER! Went tonight with two sisters. We were surprised the place was so quiet, and yet it took FOREVER to receive our food. We did finally see our food put up on the window to be delivered, but the one and only waitress didn't seem to be paying much attention. She spent a lot of time chatting with some friends before going to help seat new customers and then chatted with someone else before serving us. I ordered the French Toast - c'mon how can you mess up French Toast? It tasted HORRIBLE and was ice cold to boot! I tried two bites and pushed it away. Inedible. One sister ordered the Philly Cheese Steak. She got a HUGE ball of gristle in her 2nd bite. She gave up on it and ate just a few of the fries. We went tonight as the special was liver & onions. A real fave. of my other sister. It was so overcooked she said she didn't taste liver at all, she wasn't sure she wasn't eating a very skinny overcooked steak. It didn't smell like liver either. She was starving and ate 1/2 before giving up too. When the waitress came over with the bill she just started picking up the full plates and didn't even comment on the fact that two of us had left the food practically intact. We said that at least we can eat the free ice cream and asked for chocolate. She told us no chocolate, vanilla or strawberry only. REALLY! Well that just capped the evening, so we didn't even get dessert. We told her the food was inedible and she just kind of shrugged, picked it up and walked away. We went up to pay the bill and told the person there the same thing and she just said she would tell George. Almost $30 later and we all left hungry and really upset. Nobody cared. We'll spread the word. DO NOT EVEN THINK OF EATING AT GEORGE'S! UGH!"}
{"text":"I see a couple of reviews not giving George's Cafe a five star because they had to wait for a lane to bowl on!  What does waiting for a lane to bowl on have to to with the Cafe?  In the cafe, we have never encountered a problem with anything on the menu, service or prices.  Making a review on George's Cafe should be an entire different entity than anything about the bowling alley, as they are two different businesses entirely.  My hat is off to George's Cafe and their cooks and waitresses.  They do a superb job and I can hardly wait to go back for another walleye dinner!"}
{"text":"Three of us went with family who raved about it.  Ruben sandwiches were just ok, greasy fries, Caesar salad was nothing but iceberg lettuce.  Really nothing special at all about the place and one of our group got sick from what he ate.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"Ok, this restaurant is inside the bowling alley. BUT, it's not a bowling alley-type food joint! It is a full-service restaurant. I really like going to George's because of the very friendly atmosphere and the fact that everyone is really nice (employees and patrons). The food is not expensive, it's served at the proper temperature, and it's always very clean in the restaurant. If you're looking for a small-town feel with decent food and friendly service, this is a good place to go."}
{"text":"First let me say it was George's new Café at the Bell Rec Center. My friend and I order the burgers with fries. My burger was completely raw in the middle. I actually do prefer MR so for me to send it back you know it was raw! When I got it back the bite mark was still there. So that tells me they took the meat off the bun with the mayo and ketchup on it and put it back on the grill. Who does that?!?!?! When they brought it back it was still raw in the middle. So I ordered a French dip. The cook must have been mad at me sending both burgers back as the roast beef looked and tasted like it was very well boiled! It was tough with no flavor at all. This was my first experience at this new café. And no I wouldn't go there again! This is the same owner as the George's Lakeview Café so wonder if the cook is better at the old one. The cashier and server were very nice."}
{"text":"Decent food and decent prices! Good for the old crowd here in Sun City. I will come back here for lunch or dinner again!"}
{"text":"Got the walleye...best fish and chips I've ever had. Great service. It's in a bowling ally with limited hours. Had to hurry to get out by 8pm."}
{"text":"Been here 4 times now. Burgers and dinners all fantastic. ACE fish fry is the deal! 

Rueben and patty melt were just OK."}
{"text":"This a great place !! All servers are super super nice ..!!  Good is very good ..!! Atmospheric is the best the owners of café come around to the tables n chat with customers that's a plus customers feel very important.. great place !!!"}
{"text":"Despite its location in sun city this is a quaint dinner for all ages with wonderful classics and family/owner favorites! I highly recommend the chicken fried steak for breakfast. Excellent service and quality food make this a winner for me! Looking forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"The food was very good...good process.  It had been a long time since I had walleye and it was very good.  The only reason I'm giving this 4 stars is for the desert.  My wife and I both ordered a slice of pie to go.  We ate it a few hours later and it was nasty.  Besides being old it wasn't very good.  Other than that I would go back and when I do I'm going to let them know about there pie.  Hope this was useful to someone."}
{"text":"Good food and service. I will be there tomorrow for fish. Best coleslaw in the area."}

{"text":"When we first moved to the Phoenix area in July of 2011, we would drive around getting a feel for the valley; once while out and about, we saw the restaurant - we LOVE 'mom-and-pop'-type restaurants, it's like being back home, so we stopped in.  AMAZING!  Food and service were both on point!

We failed to note its location, and for YEARS we randomly drove around close to where we thought we may have been that day, trying to find it, I Googled bowling alleys trying to find it, to no avail.  Then, one day about 6 months ago, I was driving around and something seemed...familiar.  On my right is a parking lot with covered parking, although I couldn't place it; then I realized what I'd stumbled upon - I was BEYOND excited!  We were back for breakfast later that week.  We don't eat out much as a general rule, but we've been back 4 times since, and it's where the Monsters (read: kiddos) request we go!  

Service: Fantastic   Food: Delicious   Atmosphere: Like home"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the Spaghetti & Meatballs here. Sauce and meatballs taste made from scratch and the portion is large with 6 nice tasting smaller meatballs. Garlic bread is potent and fresh grilled as I like it. 

Ribs were pretty good. Tender fall off the bone and tasted baked or maybe boiled with bbq sauce added after cooking. Mixed veggies were average and probably canned or frozen. Nice baked potato with plenty of butter and sour cream provided.

Service was very attentive and friendly on both visits. I will go back and try their prime rib next visit."}
{"text":"I moved to Sun City from Northern Arizona in November and while my kitchen was being remodeled I had no way to cook so I looked for something close that I could get a sandwich or salad.  I was amazed at the wonderful specials that were offered everyday so I got more than just a sandwich.  Told my friend about it and she too was pleasantly surprised.  She then told her husband and so on and so on.  Now it has become a regular meeting place for several of us, several times a month.  The facility is always clean, the waitresses very friendly and the prices are great.  The amount of food is unbelievable so we usually go at lunch and always get a \"go box\" which we then have for dinner.  Every time we go we get something different and plan on going through the whole menu.

{"text":"Hunting for a new place to eat breakfast on Sunday mornings. Read reviews and George's looked promising. 
We entered through the bowling alley. There were tables set up for large parties in the area of the bowling alley. The place was fairly busy but we got a seat quickly. A party of 8 was not pleased we got seated before them but our table was a booth for 4. 
I ordered beacon and eggs and my wife got an egg and took my toast. The food was good the coffee was good. The service was friendly and good. 
So why a 3? For some it would be a 4 or 5 but I just did not fill like I belonged there. Nothing they did, just me. Was this their fault? No. and I will probably go again to see how the second visit goes.. If you are looking for a place, at least for breakfast, give them a try. It may be just the place you are looking for."}
