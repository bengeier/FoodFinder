{"text":"It helps the boys and girls club but that's about it. The switch to antiques was a bad move in my opinion. I liked the random stuff they had before. The food is affordable but lacks quality. Good idea. Just needs improvement."}
{"text":"Not sure how this place stays open. They only make hot dogs and the hot dogs are terrible. Why pay $7 for hot dog and chips when I can make a better tasting hot dog on my George Foreman grill?  It's nice that it supports the boys and girls club, but there is no way this place makes any money at all. They could probably make more money holding a bake sale a few times in the summer. Antiques are way overpriced. Would be better if the food was better. Turn this huge space into a bar/restaurant or appartments and money will be made for sure."}
{"text":"Though this place is a great idea (it supports the Boys and Girls clubs) it really doesn't work well. They have over priced \"antiques\" and, even though I can only speak for their vegetarian options, over priced food with very little variety. It's also heavily inconsistent.  There's a reason you never see anyone there. The facility itself is huge and very clean, but if you never have customers, keeping clean can't be too hard. I feel sad every time I go, and every time I leave."}
{"text":"If I wanted a gourmet hot dog I'd head down the street to Franktuary. But I came here for a quick meal and felt good about where my money went. The hot dog was a hot dog, nothing to complain about. The space is nice and I plan on going back for some ice cream or a Klondike bar."}
