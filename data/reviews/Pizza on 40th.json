{"text":"We ordered 2 18in cheese pizzas for delivery. They were there in about 30 mins and they were nice and hot. Maybe a little pricey but this is the best pizza I have had in the area so far. Crust is amazing, sauce is just right and cooked to perfection. Closest pizza pie to New York style that I've seen...even better than the ones claiming to be NY style pizza. The order came with plenty of little cups filled with parm cheese and red pepper flakes. This place will defiantly be my go to for pizza!!"}
{"text":"Always a Savior in a clutch!  Yummmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm...do my tummmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmy"}
{"text":"Still bomb Pizza like mama mia. Takes me back home to good old newyork. Makes me cry because it makes me miss home.
Great service outstanding food.
Great menu and specials even online.
You can't beat all the above , oh and the ranch is incredible super creamy 

  This is not sponsored"}
{"text":"Great NY style pizza at a great price. 2 slices and a drink for $3.50. There are a few seats inside and out but I'd suggest taking your order to-go. Pizza needs a little time to settle out of the oven so might as well drive home."}
{"text":"Best pizza in the city just about every time we go there. I'm not an easy pizza judge having read Rochester, NY's pizza blog guy pretty regularly in my time there. This stuff is up to East Coast's standards and not the sad, sad pizza realm that most of Phoenix inhabits. Crispy crust, good sauce, right amount of grease make a magical pie. Go try the 2 slices and a drink deal that runs all the time and tell me I'm wrong."}
{"text":"I too was bummed when Momma Mia's closed. But finding this gem, right by my new job, is freaking awesome! The pizza slices are pretty damn big and have the proto-typical flavor I always seek out when craving pizza.  (I can only speak for the plain cheese slices, haven't tried anything else. With as good as the cheese slice is, there's probably no reason to even bother trying anything else, but thats just me)

But then the kicker: Lunch Special: 2 Slices and a Drink for $3.50 (including tax)

Yea, thats right: $3.50, out-the-door/in-your-belly. I'm really lucky I don't live around it, because I'd probably have a 4 time-a-week habit pretty quickly."}
{"text":"wow great pizza great deals and open on some of the holidays when everyone else were close thank you guys"}
{"text":"Very good pizza, even when reheated. Loved the crust, and pretty much everything else. The service is great and the employees are all friendly. I ordered a pizza for pick up, but I saw may people walk in for the $3.50 2 slices and small soda special and I want to swing by for that sometime. It wasn't exactly a Brooklyn or Manhattan slice, but it' was pretty close... just writing this review is making my mouth water. I ordered a half supreme and half Hawaiian."}
{"text":"Great pizza, just as Mamma Mia's offered. Different management and company name change, but the most of the same employees and same tasty pizza."}
{"text":"Ahh the old Momma Mia's.. Still just as delicious.. Still epic portions (typically 2/3 meals from the one order!). Eggplant Parm is my go to, the hubby always gets the Alfredo pasta!"}
{"text":"Take it from this NYC girl, this is TRUE NYC pizza: thin, crispy but foldable crust with really flavorful sauce and bubbly-melty cheese and just a tad bit of pizza grease dripping on to your paper plate.  Actually it's been a while since I could get pizza this good (for this cheap!) even back home (NYC), because all the old pizza places I grew up on have been sold to a new generation of owners who don't make good pizza.  But anyway, I've been coming here since this was Mamma Mia's.  The pizza was awesome then, and it's just as great now.  Pizza On 40th is #1 of my list of pizza places in the ENTIRE valley."}
{"text":"OMG why do we patronize places like this?  Second time ordering, first was a pizza that resembled a sponge with mediocre toppings and then tonight...we went for Italian, yep wrong choice although we ordered ravioli and garlic bread.  Same sponge texture on the bread, I understand,  why leave it in the oven for two minutes more, it might get crispy.  We got delivery and sure go ahead and forget the large Caesar salad but feel free to charge me for it. Called the place and got the \"we're sorry\" but don't really give a damn attitude, pretty sure it will stay on the bill.  We also ordered chicken with fries for the little one, you guessed it...sponge fries, because why...it takes too long to cook something properly!  Better half just went to the bathroom in a hurry, I suspect I'll be there soon.  Make a better choice than we did!"}
{"text":"RUDE SERVICE,  DISGUSTING BUGS AND HAIRS.  After being yelled by a little man who looked like Super Mario that I didn't call my order in correctly (according to him), I came home to one dish with a large roach in the sauce and a long black wavy hair (which looked like his) in my salad.  I should have expected this when I saw how dirty the place looked when I picked up my order.  I give this one star only because the app requires a star rating,  and minus 5 stars wasn't an option."}
{"text":"Pizza is not as good as I remembered it being, but the pasta and salads are great.  I'm glad the old Mama Mia's is back in some form."}
{"text":"They are back, formally known as Mamma Mia's. I was ecstatic when I found out not only was it opening back up but most of the original workers were rehired by new management. Food is still awesome and if you want real NY Style pizza, come here.

This is how it is done!!!"}
{"text":"I've been waiting for 10 years for a great pizza joint in my neighborhood, and I've found it! Had a deluxe minus the pepperoni and it was one of the best pizzas ever!  Great crust, great flavor and not too much stuff to kill the pie!"}
{"text":"cold,  gross! then  I called back to let them know how the 1 piece  was cold she said oh no it wasn't!  oh ok!!!? that place sucks never will I ever go there!!!"}
{"text":"Favorite pizza place. Great pizza, salads, everything on the menu. Great service and they do delivery too. Good prices."}
{"text":"Great service and GREAT NY style pizza!  This is my favorite pizza in Phoenix... and we all know there are lots of options!  If you liked Mama Mia's... well, I see the same awesome pizza chef behind the counter so it is still great pizza just a new name and new owners... Give this pizza a try and it will be your new favorite!!"}
{"text":"3 stars right off the bat, as I paid extra for more ranch with my wings and it was forgotten about. They staple the bag shut so be sure to ask before leaving."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza! Stumbled across this place and very happy we did."}
{"text":"The sandwich was nearly exactly the same as it was several years ago when the place was called something else and the owner wasn't embezzling funds. It was another chicken parm sandwich, but in this version they cut the cutlet into strips and then put it into a bun. The real difference maker is that they let you add onions and peppers into the sandwich for about 79 cents. They have various lunch specials, but this sandwich wasn't included and cost about 8 bucks. Solid sandwich if your in the area."}
{"text":"They're Back and better than ever!  Seems like better management/ food is great & super clean & place was nicely renovated. The food is still AWESOME and I do love to have my cheat/ pizza meal @ #Pizzaon40th   Previous to the new ownership/ management-  I used to call no one would even answer the phone half the time, now people answer the phone- LOL
Everyone is smiling, good staff!  Nice come back guys :)"}
{"text":"A very worthy successor to the NY-style pizzeria that used to occupy this space. Prices are good, slices are huge and tasty, and they even offer gourmet toppings (sun-dried tomatoes, kalamata olives, etc.). They also have pies for people with special dietary needs: low-carb personal pie with one topping for $7.99 and gluten-free pie with one topping for $8.99; the gluten-free one is a good deal considering that  gluten-free personal pies (with one topping) at other pizzerias cost between $11 and $14. And don't be confused by their logo, which says \"Brick Oven Pizza on 40th\". The \"brick oven\"  is just for the name, just as you don't find a garden of olive trees in Olive Garden; the pizzas in 40th Street are baked in a regular commercial metal oven. Oh - and they have a really good meal deal: 2 slices and a small soda for only $3.50!"}
{"text":"It was Friday night and we were exhausted, so we decided to call it a movie night! A movie night isn't complete without pizza, of course! Our usual go-to pizza delivery place is Rosati's but we decided to switch it up a bit! Pizza on 40th recently took over the old local neighborhood spot, Mamma Mia, so we gave it a whirl.

We ordered a small pizza with mushrooms and artichoke hearts along with a Greek salad. The pizza was good, not the best that i've ever had but it did the trick. Their ranch gets 5 stars, for sure! The salad was GREAT!  It was loaded with veggies and feta. I also loved the dressing that it came with. 

For a small pizza and Greek salad, our bill was $36 including tip & delivery. I did think that was a little steep for the amount of food that we ordered, but hey, I guess you pay for being lazy? The delivery WAS speedy though, which was a plus! Since it is convenient and in the 'hood, i'm sure we'll order from here again."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood pizza spot. From the outside it doesn't look like much but they nail your classic New York style pizza with above average toppings. 

Definitely a top go to for my girlfriend and I."}
{"text":"Pizza was fulfilling and huge slices for a good price. Fell in love with their baked ziti!!!! So delicious and had the right about of cheese & sauce. Dining area is very small but there are also tables & chairs outside of building. Will be returning"}
{"text":"Very much enjoyed the pizza.  First time going and was very surprised by the size of the pizza and the high cost of the extra pep.  Good leftovers, though.  Gluten free pizza is also available."}
{"text":"Quality:  FAIL!
Service: FAIL!
wow. just plain rude. 

I was relaxing outside while our food was being made, all alone on a patio with four or five empty tables, reading my iphone when the pizza-making guy came out and chastised me:  \"Please take your feet off the table\".

I had put one leg over the corner of the steel table, my shoes never touching his table, so why in the heck would this foolish guy come and bother me?
I took my leg (calf) off the table. 

my attitude immediately went from comfortable & relaxing to angry. 
The only thing they should focus on is getting, and keeping customers. 

I'm not one to push people around, and I hate for people to push me around, so I put my legs up across the chair. There's no way this could possibly offend anyone.  Wrong. 

Out he came again!  Holy crap. Who is this little tyrant?  I think he hates customers, and probably his life. Bitterness showing on his face on his second little tirade -- \"Please take your feet off the chairs\", or something real close, he said --This time I defiantly left my legs comfortably across the chair and I politely replied,  \"What harm am I doing?\" I even smiled while I asked the next great question--

\"There's nobody else here, why are you giving me a hard time?  Why aren't you allowing me to simply relax?, I asked back.  I was upset. 

It was a very awkward exchange that should've never happened. I said, \"I'm not taking them down\". \"Then you can leave!\", he replied. 

He actually asked me to leave!
If anything, my clean jeans are dirtier, and his table and chairs are cleaner than before. 


if you enjoy looking at partially/cooked pizzas sitting on a rack, drying out, then this is your place. 

wouldn't it be better if they were made closer to order? Efficiency doesn't taste good, fresh does. 

I understand the need for speed when you are selling lots of slices, but if someone really cared about the quality, they would simply wait until customers pulled up and then, throw in a single pizza that would be dedicated for slices, just in case that's what the customer wanted...
Disgusting customer service. 

I don't ever want to go here again."}
{"text":"This place has delicious dough. There is something sweet and overall tasty in this bread. It's worth getting."}
{"text":"So , I was hanging out in Arcadia area ... and I was looking for a place to eat a good pizza , wow .... what a find !!!!!! Best mom and pops pizza place ever !!!!"}
{"text":"Looking for a quick spot to grab a slice or two..nice option...2 slices of thin crust new york style and a drink for less that $6..yeah it's worth it.."}
{"text":"OMG love love love this pizza! Very NYC style in flavor, crust, and price. For $3.50 you get two slices plus a soda. Nice little tables to sit outside and enjoy your slices. Friendly service, great specials, convenient location, what's not to love?"}
{"text":"Here's the deal.  The pizza is AMAZING.  Five stars for the pizza.  Don't try to eat here; there's no room.  The \"dining room\" barely fits three people.  This is a definite \"to go\" or delivery pizza place.

The wings, eh - they're fine.  The five stars is for the pizza.  Seriously, the pizza is top notch - nothing fancy, just delicious.  I haven't tried anything else on the menu, and I probably won't.  This place was awesome when it was Mama Mia's, and if anything, the pizza tastes even better now.

I do have an issue with it being called \"Brick Oven Pizza.\"  There is no brick oven; it's not Brick Oven Pizza, so why even put that on the menu or, even worse, on the sign outside of the business?  Another reviewer said it's like expecting a garden of olive trees at Olive Garden.  I disagree; it's like calling your restaurant Chet's Open Pit Barbeque, where there is no Chet and there is no open pit in a 15-mile radius.  I just don't get it.  Pizza clearly doesn't need to be cooked in a brick oven to be delicious; the proof is right here.  Brick oven pizza is cooked in a brick oven, and it has a distinct texture based on the unique method of cooking.  This is not brick oven pizza, and it doesn't even resemble brick oven pizza - not in cooking style, not in texture, and not in taste.  It's still delicious (five star delicious).  I don't understand where the \"brick oven\" came from unless there's some crazy story about how they were going to install a brick oven, but it broke as it was being shipped from Italy and the sign had already been ordered.  Unless there's some rational reason for having \"brick oven pizza\" on the sign, I would try to figure out a way to dodge the false advertising claim.  Just serve the awesome pizza, and ditch the \"brick oven\" moniker.  Let the pizza sell itself."}
{"text":"Best Pizza and Fries anywhere !! Have tried it twice and it is the best. The service was great and the staff was very friendly and helpful. I will always return here for Pizza."}
{"text":"I loved it when it was Mama Mia's and still love it today. Their pizza is my all time favorite. It's close to work so their lunch time 2 slice special is perfect. Service I always fast and cashier who takes your order is always friendly and probably knows me but how much I go in. I have yet to try their pasta dishes but everything sounds so good."}
{"text":"Pizza on 40th is a godsend.  It's the exact kind of pizza I've been looking to fill the void ever since Tessio's closed.  When I found them, tears welled in my eyes.

I've been having a rough time trying to find good pizza that isn't $30 for a basic-ass cheese pizza, or something disgusting like Little Caesars.  Pizza on 40th is... it's that middle ground pizza that I've been looking for, and it's just a little hole in the wall, not some obnoxious place without parking.  

And it's right next to a liquor store, so you can grab a six pack and make your Friday night a good one."}
{"text":"Our new go-to pizza place! Tasty, great service, unpretentious, amazing value. The wings are perfect - just what you'd want. Pizza is incredible - thin crust, good sauce, wide topping selection. But the best part? The freaking ranch. Honestly, one of the best ranch dressings I've ever had. If you're a fellow ranch head, you know he importance and plight of finding the right one. 

11/10 will be back again."}
{"text":"This place replaced Mama Mia's. I had the eggplant sandwich, which didn't even come close to the Mama Mia experience. The eggplant was just too soggy for me. That is all."}
{"text":"These guys are great. My regular go-to for a solid New York style pie. I'm a born and raised New Yorker and I take my Slice game seriously and most places that try to pull off the NY style are a downright disaster. This place is tier one for sure. The only thing I crave after a slice from these guys is #anotherone."}
{"text":"We LOVED this pizza place when we lived close. It was always our go-to! We've only tried their pizza and wing special but it's always been amazing, so I have no doubt their other items would be as well. They're also very considerate of their customers. The ONE time we had a problem with our order, they were quick to fix the problem and made up for it. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Went there today for take out dinner was sitting outside waiting for my order watched an employee come out and change the garbage he walked back into the restaurant immediately took the lid from the beverage machine I stood and watched him walk through the food prep area to the ice bin filled the bin with ice from the ice maker and put it into the beverage machine I alerted the cashier..she got nasty and defensive then told me I'm not the manager so I can do nothing he was allowed to fill the machine and I was basically looked at as a trouble maker..people die from food borne illnesses and asses like this guy are the reason!!!!"}
{"text":"To say I was pleasantly surprised by this place would be a understatement. After a day of unpacking & cleaning we decided on some easy carry out pizza. I noticed this place on my drive home the other day when the drive through liquor place next door caught my eye (yepppp).

We ordered a 14 inch pizza-half ham & green pepper & half ham & pineapple. It was so good! The cheese was perfectly melted & the crust was crisp without being overdone! The ranch was delicious (yes, I'm hoarding it to use on other stuff throughout the week). This place is less than a mile from us & was super quick, so we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great pizza, and friendly staff make this place a top notch spot to go, along with the 2 slices & a drink deal that runs all day long"}
{"text":"Really good NY style. Down to earth prices. Best lunch special in town. 2 slices and a drink for $3.50"}
{"text":"Worst experience ever. We ordered online, got a confirmation, money was taken from our account, yet when my wife showed up, the rude girl at the counter would not honor the order! Then, she would not even help my wife, and refused to even LOOK at the order on my wife's phone, or the online bank debit showing they STOLE our $22 bucks! She just ignored my wife! Really?? Some idiot from the kitchen even speculated it was my wife's fault somehow. HOW? Her fault that she GAVE them our money and got NOTHING for it?!? If I could, I would give them ZERO stars. DO NOT EVER GO HERE, even if the food's okay, it's made by people who have no basic human decency or integrity."}
{"text":"Don't know how the pizza tastes as their web site loses orders.   It will process your credit card, charge you and you'll receive an e-mail confirmation.  However, when you call the store, they'll tell you they don't have your order.  
When you mention you have proof of the order, they tell you to call back some other day and talk to Nick.  Only Nick can handle issues with orders placed through their web site.  They don't take messages for Nick or give you his e-mail address.  I just wanted to forward my e-mail confirmation to him, along with my credit card billing notification proving I paid.  But, This is the sort of thing you can only handle by talking directly to the mysterious Nick, that appears to only work two or three days a week.

Their website passes your order to togoorder.com, and I would assume some of the code is completely screwed, but, that shouldn't have cost me $104.24, and the hatred of a bunch of starving teammates.

Shop elsewhere or drive to the store and order and pick it up in person.  Being as this business can't afford to purchase their own online shopping cart, they should at least add a \"Hey, my order is missing\" form to their website."}
{"text":"Textbook definition of \"meh\".... food is priced appropriately low. the food is average. You get what you pay for at this place."}
{"text":"This is my favorite pizza place in Arcadia. They always have everything ready on time and their specials online help save some money too. I have never been disappointed with their classic pepperoni pizza."}
{"text":"So , we came on the bikes on a sat nite . We ordered pizza and wings combo. Pizza was ok . The wings were to dry no tender, and the sauce its just plain red crush pepper with no flavor."}
{"text":"Is pizza on 40th the best pizza in the world?  No.  Is it easy in a pinch, consistent, moderately priced, and a great neighborhood go-to spot for pick-up or delivery?  Absolutely!

My kids are a bit picky about their pizza and they eat pizza from this place quite often, so I consider that a huge win... In addition to the delicious pizza, this place does a great job with chicken and eggplant parm dishes.  The salads?  Not my favorite.

I recommend ordering delivery if you live in the neighborhood.  Pair up your order with some wine or beer and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Best thing I've put in my mouth today! Pizza on 40th does it every time... Great pizza and always a great staff!"}
{"text":"The pizza is really good but the prices are better. It's like 5 dollars for 3 huge slices and a drink. It's a small joint too so you never have to wait a long time. The lady at the front was also very nice."}
{"text":"Our go-to pasta spot in AZ. It took many years to find a place that does really good pasta around here, let alone take-out pasta, but it's really good.

The Penne vodka is awesome as is the spaghetti with meat sauce. The other pasta may be great too, but we haven't gone away from our regular order yet.

Additionally, the pizza is really good and the staff is excellent. We panicked when Mamma Mia shut down, but with a little break and a name change, it's back!"}
{"text":"Wow! I can't believe how huge these portions are! I ordered a \"side\" of fries and \"small\" salad. The fries and salad were enough for multiple people to eat. The gluten free pizza was good too. Thin crust and toppings were plenty. It could have been a little warmer when it arrived, but nonetheless, it was still good.  When you're new to a community or traveling from out of town, it's hard to find food that is good. This was a great pick"}
{"text":"Definitely a favorite of mine. Giving 4 stars because they are never on time but that won't stop me from indulging in their delicious pizza!!!"}
{"text":"After reading the other reviews, I really don't have much new to add. Momma Mia's was my go-to pizza place (as someone else already said). The same lady is working the counter. She even remembered me. I always ask for \"the usual\" which for me is the 2 slices of pizza and a drink special for $3.50. Good stuff, good price, fast service and large slices."}
{"text":"Good pizza but not great. Thin crust with decent amount of toppings, however if this place would invest literally $1 more at manufacture cost it would be one of the best pizzas around. Slightly light on toppings. Dough is on point. Wings are huge but not crispy enough. Don't get me wrong, they appear to buy the most premium wings. They are the size of small drumsticks and are awesome. Another 2-4 minutes in the fryer and they would probably be the best wings in Phx for quality of base material alone. Wing sauce is decent too. Could use a little more butter maybe? This is probably the reason for 4 stars instead of 5. Pizza got another deduction which is probably unjustified due to the wing experience. Pizza definitely has the potential to be top notch. All the fundamentals are there. Overall not terrible. I paid $50 for 2 large 1 topping pizzas and 20 wings. Probably will give them one more try, but after that unless they improved never again. Could get papa John's or Pizza hut or whatever for $20 less with promotion. If you are going to charge premium price your food needs to be amazing or your restaurant is never going to make it. 5-star potential for sure."}
{"text":"$41 total  wasted. So disappointed. Started with the delivery man who banged on the door like the police. Ordered a large pepperoni pizza. Very few pepperoni, may well have been just a cheese pizza. Costco is so much better and as always Spinatos is my favorite. Ordered wings extra crispy half buffalo and half bbq. Wings were not crispy. The buffalo was very mild, more sweet than anything. BBQ sauce thin, ranch was very thin as if water was added. Such a waste of money."}
{"text":"Had the cheese pizza and the meat lovers. It's rather pricy compared to other pizza places, but you do not get the typical cookie cutter pizza. It's a small place, so you may want to get it to go."}
{"text":"My son was wanting pizza and we didn't wanna do anymore driving since we just got in from a long road trip. Looked up the local pizzerias and this place had the best reviews. Yelp doesn't say they deliver but if you check out their website they do. Placed our order for delivery at our hotel for two slices of cheese pizza, spaghetti, and fries. The delivery was quick, and once we opened the brown bags the food came in we were a little overwhelmed by the amount of food. Wasn't expecting the slices to be so big ( I'd compare the size to Costco pizza sizes). We dug into the food and man was it delicious. Would definitely go back and recommended to anyone looking for good pizza and spaghetti."}
{"text":"I still remember the day I first fell in love with their pizza. It was January 2012 and I had just started training for my first job at the trampoline park next door. 

Since the beginning I've pretty much just ordered the Lunch Special. My order is always the same: 1 slice of cheese, 1 slice of bacon, ranch, and a drink and it comes out to about $4.50. 

I was devastated when they close. I know that may sound like I'm overreacting, but I'm serious. Anyone who knows me knows I love this place and I even had a few friends and family message me letting me know Mama Mia's had closed and when they announced the new opening as Pizza on 40th. I don't know if Pizza on 40th has a different owner, but I do know that a lot of the staff is the same. Most importantly the pizza has not changed one bit :D"}
{"text":"First time I ever ordered and even though the driver seemed very annoyed that he was lost trying to find our house, the food was amazing and still warm. The sauce that meatballs came in was perfect and this is coming from my New York Italian family. We all loved the sausage and the meatballs. The pizza had fresh mozzarella and the garlic and basil came with without having to ask to add! Great flavor and quality ingredients. Finally a local pizzeria with normal prices that delivers and has great sides to choose and the wings were also perfect!!"}
{"text":"What a great surprise! In front out of and need of some decent food asap! Ordered online and the food arrived hot, fresh and way better than I could have hoped for! So freaking good, friendly delivery person as well!"}
{"text":"Best new discovery for me this year! SO excited I found this place I had to write a review right away!   Wow, where do I begin....

So, I just got done hiking at South Mountain Park and was only a little hungry as I had my usual feast at Lee's sandwiches earlier today.  I was looking for a new simple slices joint on my way home. Opened my Yelp app typed 'pizza slices' and sort by rating. This place came so highly recommended I just had to try it.

A small place, easy to miss it unless you know it's there. When I walked up I saw the daily specials sign and was SHOCKED! I thought I went back in time 20 years (back then I went to pizza connection in this neighborhood ...man I miss that place) 2 slices and a drink for $3.50!? American $? Wow. Hook me up and I'll take a slice home...as I wasn't that hungry...that was the plan anyway ...

I was pleasantly surprised how light and thin the slices were. Pizza was so good I just had to eat the 2nd slice.  I always try plain slices when I go to a new place. These were phenomenal! No grease, easy folding NY style slices at unbelievable prices!

Any time I am nearby and want a slice I now have my new favorite Arcadia area pizza joint! Pics don't do justice, stop by and see what all the hubbub is about!"}
{"text":"I have found one of my new favorite pizza spots in town and awesome chicken parm sandwich! This is a pick up or delivery unless you are just grabbing a slice by yourself!"}
{"text":"wow was this bad, talk about bland and absolutely no flavor.. if you cant pass the cheese only pizza in ny style then fugetaboutit !!  everyone else in the party was throwing crap on there cheese pizza and saying how good it was, if it was so good you wouldnt have to add all crap to it."}
{"text":"OK, so I previously tried this place and thought it was just average. But we decided to try it again because we were still looking for a good pizza place. We ordered a margherita pizza and it was so great. The crust was crispy and the tomatoes were delicious! I think I found my new pizza place!"}
{"text":"The amount of food you get for a few bucks is in incredible. I have been going to this place since I was a kid, and they always treat you with respect. They also treat your hard earned dollars with respect too. Incredible food, incredible value, extremely affordable, doesn't get much better than that."}
{"text":"i'm from New Jersey and this is my favorite spot in town for the style of pie i grew up with. saw other people say they were heartbroken when Mamma Mia's closed and i can 100% understand- i was too. thankfully when it re-opened with this name everything was just as good and the lunch special is basically the best deal in town for east coast pizza"}
{"text":"OK - we were so sad and bummed when Momma Mias didn't come back. It was our go-to pizza place and it killed us! The we found out about this and were sooooo excited. Now normally, I think you would want places to be different or unique or doing their own thing, but I am so happy that these guys kept to the simple amazing pizza they had before! It was so good and so nice to have something close and back that we love! The wings were great too! Delivery was wicked fast! 

Guess we will be back to Sunday night pizza again :)"}
{"text":"Decided to try this place after a failed order with door dash, and I'm glad that I did! Their hot wings are really good, it's rare to find good hot wings nowadays. The cheesesteak with the ranch was really good as well, and I love their ranch"}
{"text":"Great hidden spot for pizza! Only took about 20 minutes for take-out at dinner time. Their large pizzas are big enough to feed 4-5 people, and it was delicious!"}
{"text":"Pizza on 40th has okay pizza. It had a fair amount of cheese and sauce which I like, but the crust was tough and chewy and the sauce was a little sweet.  
It came with a salad which was decent,  but no homemade dressing.
The tiramisu I ordered for dessert was bland, and tasteless."}
{"text":"Good pizza, got half veggie half pepperoni. Loved garlic bread with cheese,  jalapeño poppers were ok wish they would have been bite sized."}
{"text":"Okay so....this is a tough one to rate as of right now. We saw the great reviews and gave them a try on Friday night. The service was good; they were fast and friendly. We got a pizza, some buffalo wings and some soda. Everything tasted great plus they gave us plates and extra ranches at no additional cost (we looove ranch with pizza). However! In the middle of the night we both woke up nauseous with bubbly stomachs. But regardless of our not so great night sharing a bathroom, it was so tasty we want to give them another try. Risky, I know but when you're foodie you're willing to take another chance for some great tasting grub."}
{"text":"Super stoked to have just found this gem close to my house! My daughter and I stopped in for a slice and were impressed not only with how good the pizza was, but by how nice the service was! We will be back for sure!!!!!"}
{"text":"This is by far our fav pizza spot in the area. Great service and great pizza! Love the pizza and wing special"}
{"text":"The food is good, but the delivery service sucks. If you live in an apartment the delivery guy is too lazy to look for your unit. He calls and says the gate code is broken and asks for you to come down.
This is the second time he has done this. 2/3/18"}
{"text":"Waal, I thought fer sure I wrote a review about this place.  It's been a few different names over the years, and none of them were up to the hype, until now.  Pizza on 40th has become my go-to place for Survivor Night Pizza.  What's that, you ask?  

Many years ago, when Survivor (the reality show) started, we made it a weekly family night, ordering pizza and wings from one of the great neighborhood dives (Slice-sorry to see you go). and this went on throughout my kids childhood.  The girls grew up, Slice moved out of the neighborhood, and we were left in a pizza desert, so to speak.  Sure, there was LGO with their over-priced pie and a couple of new upstarts, and this place, which was named something else back then (Mama-mia?) - but was nondescript at best.

Anyway, years later, new owners, new attitude, same old recipes, but prepared with more expertise and Pizza on 40th is born.  We typically will get our standard order from over the years, a large pepperoni and black olive, and an order of wings as hot as you can make them.  

Slice never disappointed us with this order, and so we had high expectations for P/40.  I'm glad to say, they've lived up to those expectations.  The kids have moved on and our ordering has changed, indicating that they can do Calzones and Hot Eggplant Subs just as good as their pizza.  Their products are always delicious, prepared perfectly and ready when they say - that is unless you order delivery.

Ok, here comes the bad.  Their website for online ordering is buggy.  For example, they list about six add-in ingredients for Calzone with multi-select (check boxes) and it lets you select all of those items.  When you go to check out, the application stops and says you gotta correct something.  That something is the multi-select option for the Calzone.  You can only select one topping.  Okay, I think that is a bug.  You might say, \"well, they are Calzone purists, and that's how they make them\" and I would reply with \"Fine, but when you stand up for your purity, you lose the additional $2 revenue for each added topping\".  If you call them, they will stuff as many ingredients as you ask for in the Calzone, so I'm dubious about my \"purity\" argument.

My second \"bad\" is delivery.  Your order will get to you. eventually.  After ordering online, you get an email confirming your order and advising you of the delivery time.  Our order was delivered over 40 minutes past this time, which was already an hour later than when we ordered, i.e., we ordered at 5:30, was advised delivery would be 6:25 and it actually was delivered at 7:10.  Oh, and they charge $3 for delivery, and of course, you should tip the driver.  FYI P/40 driver, at 6:25, the cash tip was $5.  At 7:10, it was down to $2 and you almost didn't get that - when you turned to bolt out of my doorway, with nary a word spoken.

So, despite that negativity, I count it as lesson learned.  Don't order delivery, get off your ass and drive the mile down the road and pick up your order.  That's what I'll be doing in the future."}
{"text":"Service was nice, pizza wasn't flavorful at all. I ordered the Hawaiian pie, it tasted like plain sauce, layered with plain ham and lots of jalapeños, the pineapples were sparse. Good buy if you're starving, otherwise I would pass."}
{"text":"Pizza is always great! Staff was friendly and helpful in helping me choose which pizza to order."}
{"text":"Cold pizza and extremely rude delivery guy. I mean, rude to the point of yelling and ignoring me on the phone. Pizza would have been delicious if it were hot."}
{"text":"Pizza on 40th is the best. The atmosphere is a little hole in the wall pizza shop with the most dedicated, sweet employees working behind the counter. Not to mention the pizza is made with love and absolutely amazing! The lunch special is unbeatable and pizza on 40th is a fan favorite at my work."}
{"text":"Their pizza is delish and the girl who works the counter is the sweetest! I've had a slice there and have taken pizza home before the the crust stays nice and crispy! Super reasonably priced. For sure my new go to pizza place. 

Pizza is still the best I have ever. I kid you not- I ordered a delivery around 6 on Friday night and my pizza was sitting on my counter within 20 minutes. All of the staff is so kind and caring. If you haven't tried this place out, you are missing out."}
{"text":"First time ordering from this place and let me say I was completely surprised by the fast delivery and the food was good. The crust is gluten free and the pizza was huge. Total of 3 people eating and I ordered a large supreme pizza was enough to feed three people prob 4 depending on how hungry each person is in the party. Definitely will be ordering from this place again.. definitely recommend this place if your looking for good pizza you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Yum yum yum this is the closest to New York style pizza I have ever been able to find in Arizona"}
{"text":"Pizza arrived early. Hot and ready. Crust had great flavor. Plenty of cheese and toppings. Will definitely order again."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since I worked here, back when it was John Dough's Pizza in the early 90's.  Then Frank took over and changed it to Mamma Mia, which was a HUGE upgrade from what we had with JD's.  So happy to say that Pizza on 40th is continuing the tradition of excellent tasting, reasonably priced food.  I don't think I'll run into Alice Cooper here again anytime soon, but for all us \"commoners\", there are few pizza places in the valley that can compare!  Great job guys, keep it going."}
{"text":"AMAZING!!! Great wings and pizza. Also great customer service. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Just ordered 14\" pepperoni & garlic pizza for pickup. It was ready& hot when I got there. The counter people were SO friendly & helpful! Offered plates & napkins without my having to ask and they even opened the door for me when I left! The pizza was perfect from the thin crust to the tasty toppings & generous helping of yummy cheese!"}
{"text":"The wings were as I ordered them \"crisp,\" but beware when using the Eat24 App by Yelp ironically you may be charged for your side Ranch and not know until you receive an email of adjustment. Eat24 will contact the restaurant but most likely Pizza on 40th will not authorize a refund."}
{"text":"This is a good pie but it's very expensive and this is from somebody who is not nearly as cost conscious as they wish they were. They also nickel and dime you for a topping like garlic. It's minced garlic from a jar that they charge you full price for.

A 'three topping' (pepperoni, sausage and garlic) pizza and a two liter is $30 before tip. Includes a $3 delivery charge, which is hard to stomach when gas is $2.

Not recommended when other pizzerias are more affordable in the area with better product."}
{"text":"This pizza is pretty boss...and I'm a bit of a pizza snob. If you're GF, skip this pizza, you can get a better one at MOD, but everybody else should enjoy the regs. It's a little greasy but that's pizza baby!"}
{"text":"Been trying to find a great slice place here in central phx. Found this one here on yelp and decided to try on a perfect day: after a night of drinking. Nothing better than pizza for a hangover

Pizza was nothing special. Wasn't bad but also wasnt great. So so at its finest. Good price though"}
{"text":"I ordered a pizza with pepperoni, onion and black olives. I thought it was good, the crust was nice and crispy,  pizza was hot, the lady behind the counter was nice. My only issue is almost 2 dollars PER topping. My $12 pizza turned into a 20 dollar pizza and for that price, I'll head to the Nook for better quality ingredients."}
{"text":"I was very happy to see Mama Mia's reopen as Pizza on 40th. It is the same great pizza at the same great prices. I have been going to this location for years, and if you want slices of pizza, it is the best deal in town. The location is small and no frills, but the pizza and prices more than make up for it. The employees are very friendly too, especially Denise, who usually works the counter."}
{"text":"Quick Delivery late at night! Good crust, good amount of cheese and the pepperoni had lots of flavor. I will remember them every time I am back in Phoenix."}
