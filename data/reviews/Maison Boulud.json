{"text":"Maison  Boulud in the newly renovated Ritz Carlton is the creation of a Great Chef Daniel who has a passion for perfection. We dined there recently and at different times Brunch on Fathers Day in their what I call \"The Garden of Eden\" which included their famous burger with the most amazing fries, lunch included an appetizer the tropezienne salad a refreshing just right mix of greens with a vinaigrette that we need to have them share with us the recipe. Now dinner has a variety of amazing dishes starting with the duo salmon or the scallop which were served by an extremely professional staff and were to die for. Our main meals consisted of a pasta with clams with a mouthwatering creamy without the cream sauce. The cod was served with a touch of olive oil and was so fresh that it's a must try dish in Montreal.Our friends were so impressed with the decor and the setting sitting inside a glamorous but not overly done restaurant that has a garden as its setting. Was it expensive not more than any other first class restaurant in our beautiful city and yet the quality and service led by Cyril their manager was above and beyond what we were expecting. The to die for desserts were a masterpiece of perfection in taste and presentation especially the chocolat coulant. This restaurant has again established Montreal as the gourmet capital of Canada and for that we thank you Daniel. Bienvenue a Montreal !!!"}
{"text":"We decided to try Maison Boulud for their Menu Table d'HÃ´te, which is available as 2 or 3 courses during weekday lunch hours. The 2-course menu is $38, and 3-course menu $45. We reserved for a table of 2 at 1pm through Opentable.  Even before ordering, our waiter brought out house bread and warm butter to enjoy. There was classic French baguette and house focaccia that was really yummy.   As for our menu, we chose to have the 3-course (appetizer, main, dessert): Me - petit pea soup, trout, chocolate and salted caramel (I forgot the names of the dishes.. :() Hubby - salmon tartare, beef bourguignon, and raspberry mousse cake with pistachios. There are 3 options for each course you can choose from.  I actually only ordered the soup because I was cold from walking outside and because I didn't want to order the same salmon tartare as my hubby. The only other option was to get their salad which I wasn't really for.  The soup was rather large in portion, as it was served in a very deep soup bowl, and the colour of the soup was very pretty. It was refreshing to see the colour green, as I wasn't able to see much of it outside in Montreal yet! If you don't like peas, this won't be for you, as you can really taste the natural flavours of the peas very strongly. Inside the soup were small crouton? like bits that kept its crisp until the very last moment in where it entered my mouth. I was very surprised to see that they were not soggy at all while they swam around in my soup. Overall, the soup was well enjoyed and I wouldn't mind reordering it again.  Hubby's salmon tartare was also quite large in portion as well, which was quite surprising because we were more used to smaller portions of tartare. For what you pay ($38 or $45), the portions were generous. It made me wonder how their dinner portions are: are they similar? Or larger? The soft salmon was balanced out by the thin crisp on the top along with leafy greens, and the roasted beets brought out more of the chewing texture of the dish. Underneath the salmon tartare was the sauce that brought the appetizer all together; the savoury sauce had sharp tanginess to it that aimed to balance out the blandness of the salmon. Although the textures were well balanced, the flavours, on the other hand, weren't and the ingredients didn't come together in synchrony unless the hidden sauce was well mixed into the tartare; we were able to taste each ingredient on its own, individually, even though there were other factors eaten together.  My seafood dish looked very appealing at first glance, and I was delighted that they had seafood on their lunch menu. The main trout was cooked very well, not overdone, soft and delicate in texture. Underlying all the ingredients was the main sauce that was generally too overpowering.   For dessert, I chose the most chocolate-y one; I love salted caramel and vanilla bean anything, so this dessert was a must order for me. The dessert intrigued my fascination about chocolate; I had never tried chocolate that had texture like this before! It was more like soft fudge, but not too soft that it doesn't keep its shape or melt. If there was one thing that I didn't like about the dessert was that it was dark chocolate. Now, the dark chocolate went very well with salted caramel, and even my hubby, who doesn't like very sweet things, actually really enjoyed my dessert and preferred it over his!  Overall, our first visit to Maison Boulud was enjoyable. The service was great: all of our orders were correct, on time, and warm. Our waiter kept our glasses full, and he was polite and quick. The atmosphere of the restaurant divides into two, as you could be seated in the veranda or the main dining hall which is more formal. We sat in the veranda which was very nice because it had lots of natural sunlight coming in which I really liked. As many hotel restaurants are, the washrooms are not within the restaurant but in the hotel lobby. The food was okay, as there were dishes that we really liked, and some that we didn't as much. Generally, Maison Boulud is a place we would personally come with family for brunch, but I don't think we will be back anytime soon because it didn't really give us the WOW factor that we expect for a fine dining experience. Perhaps our lunch experience was an outlier, as Maison Boulud was picked #27 in Canada's Top 100 Best Restaurants! Maybe dinner is a better time to go."}
{"text":"Our family had the pleasure of dining there yesterday evening. It was our first time there after we heard great reviews and extremely good recommendations.  We chose to share dishes so we could try as many plates as possible.  My personal favorite was the charcuterie plate, and the ladies enjoyed the fantastic  desserts. The service was on point and the plates came out in perfect time. Overall a wonderful experience-Great job chef  Great wine and scotch selection with a helpful sommelier who wasn't pushy."}
{"text":"We had two wonderful dinners at this very fine restaurant. Exceptional food and outstanding friendly service. Every dish was beautifully prepared, the wine recommendations were perfect and the dessert Madeleines were just right with our coffee. We were thrilled to have the same waitress both nights! Genevieve (Gen B.D) helped with our choices and allowed me to practice my rusty French. It was just lovely and we will return!"}
{"text":"Very hard to find any complaint. Attention-to-detail in food and service was impeccable. Cocktails were on point and the wait staff was attentive and knowledgeable. From the humblest root vegetable to the glorious foie gras stuffed squab leg, everything was prepared with the greatest care and perfect technique. The dishes were creative and delicious. This was a great treat and a wonderful first meal in Montreal"}
{"text":"Had a poor service experience here. Came for breakfast, ordered French toast, server asks \"berries on the side?\" I respond yes. When food comes, it is served with a cup of berries as a side. I realize my mistake and anticipate a charge for the berries, but did not expect it to be the $16 it was. This place upsells and takes advantage of its patrons.  The food was satisfying, but it won't impress you."}
{"text":"Best meals we had in Montreal, hands down! We ate dinner here twice, and loved it both times. The razor clams were delightful. The foie gras was like candy. Their steak was done beautifully, a true medium rare. I'm a bit of a steak snob coming from Kansas City, and Maison Boloud got the temperature absolutely correct, a rarity at most restaurants, fine dining or not. I prefer less seasoning than more on my steak, but I very much enjoyed the miso marinade. The venison was lovely and tender. The halibut was perfection, probably the best cooked piece of fish I have had, rich yet delicate. The desserts were inventive and delicious, especially the pear (poire et sirope d'erable). Absolutely fantastic! The service was impeccable yet friendly. We will absolutely go back the next time we are in Montreal."}
{"text":"My husband and I took my daughter here for her 19th birthday. This is a beautiful restaurant and bar. We sat at the bar and each had a glass of champagne. My bad for not asking the price. It was 28 dollars a glass. I think the bartender should have mentioned this. We were shown to our table and offered water. It was easily 15 minutes before  someone came to take our orders. In the meantime someone else came by to let us smell the first white truffle of the season.  We kept waiting for someone to ask us about wine. It was never clear who our waiter was. It was at least 20 minutes and then our appetizers appeared! I suggested that perhaps we should talk to the sommelier first. They took the appetizers back. Another five minutes or so, and the sommelier arrived, as if everything was going according to plan. We explained what happened and she came back with wines to match our meals.  The appetizers reappeared and we had our first course. We sat for awhile and then another person came by to tell my husband that several people had returned the veal  due to toughness so he did not want my husband to order it. Strange as I had seen a post regarding their veal being tough back in 2012 as well. He changed his order. The sommelier arrived with wine selections for our main course. We waited at least 20 - 30 minutes for our mains to arrive. About half way through our meal, we were out of wine. We could not get anyone to stop to get another glass. Eventually someone came by, then, they had to find the sommelier who had to find the wine and pour it for us. We carried on as it was a special evening for our daughter. We each ordered dessert. The the sommelier arrived back to say she was giving us complimentary port due to the problems we experienced. Then two people arrived back with two more desserts telling us they were complimentary due to the troubles. No one thought to ask us if we wanted or liked port, or why 3 people who had already ordered desserts would want two more. The service was just bad. The front of house seemed to be confused about who does what. The bill was $550 before tip. We have dined at Bouley in NYC and the bill was higher than that for two people,but was worth every penny. This was not. I should say the food was quite good, but sadly the service really spoiled the experience."}
{"text":"I love to go there for Brunch. I always take the 3-course brunch because eating dessert is a must.  Their Pain Perdu is a must try, really delicious and the best in Montreal. The service is perfect.  Always ask to be seated in the Veranda whether in the summer or the winter, I think it's the best seating you can get there. If you are seated inside it's dark and would be nice for a romantic dinner.  I always book with open-table and ask to be seated in the Veranda!"}
{"text":"It has been awhile since I've been to an upscale resto...  Mainly, the reason was that the food was less than imaginative and bland, it was always pricey and sometimes just lacking in terms of portions.  What I liked about this place: it's easier to get a table than at Daniel in nyc, not suit and tie required as in Daniel.  What I had hoped this place would be: a less expensive Daniel, less austere experience while keeping the same style of cuisine... not what happened...   Maison Boulud is good food, but it lacks depth in the menu, three fish option, two beef options, no fowl or pork?? why? and foie gras doesn't count as fowl.  On to the food. We had butternut squash ravioli, seared foie gras, lamb shank rigatoni, and foie de veau grillÃ©. For dessert we ordered pumkin tart with maple ice cream, and got something weird with mostly chocolate... go figure.  The ravioli was exquisite, just as good as any top resto in MTL. The foie gras was also amazing, well balanced with balsamic vinegar and figs, tasted very good but not the most original presentation...  Lamb shank rigatoni, the rigatoni was a bit tough, it was a bit hard and not so chewy, I don't know if it was on purpose but It wasn't a texture I like in pasta. The lamb shank   and sauce that went with the rigatoni was a bit too salty, my friend couldn't finish her plate.   The foie de veau (veal liver) was under grilled to my taste, I understand it is sometimes left just rare so it doesn't taste too pasty but the thing was almost all red. I like it medium or cooked but I guess that's just personal preference. It came with caramelized onions and sauteed mushrooms, I liked the taste just wished my liver was cooked, I should have asked for it, I'm sure they would have done it...  The dessert was weird, we ordered some pumpkin tart with maple ice cream, instead got this thing loaded with chocolate, whit had very little pumpkin or ice cream in it, the description didn't even have any mention of chocolate. And it wasn't too good so It was disappointing.  Having eaten at Daniel in NYC, I was excited to have an NYC style french resto in MTL, alas maison Boulud resembles more the French fare in MTL than NYC."}
{"text":"Stayed here 3 nights in late July '13. Experienced breakfast, lunch and dinner, more that once. Service excellent, decor excellent, food - clearly worthy of their 3 Star Michelin status."}
{"text":"Food was amazing and service was good. Would come back again in the future. Unfortunately, they dont serve three course meals on weekend but the chef was willing to accommodate"}
{"text":"One of the best restaurant in Montreal. The food is amazing and loved the hospitality. Coming back again for sure."}
{"text":"Great place! Food is amazing. I had the porc scallop and I didn't expect it to be as good!"}
{"text":"Doesn't get much more perfect. The bar, the drinks, apps, food, mains, dinner, brunches, whatever.......the occasion doesn't matter. Food is always perfect. Service always friendly. Set-up is bar none.............just great."}
{"text":"We went here for a lunch on a beautiful sunny day and we had a good time overall. The atmosphere here is absolutely top notch, we were sitting close to the terrace and the view to the garden is gorgeous which we enjoy the most. The food we had are beef tartar, quails and Arctic char, nothing to complain about, just not as amazing as I would assume it would be. Maybe I'll return for a dinner to see if it's gonna be better."}
{"text":"I had dinner yesterday with my daughter for the first time at Maison Boulud and I can say it is a very good place in the Ritz Carlton in Montreal : the ambience is very warm and welcoming besides having an astonishing decoration very trendy and luxurious , the service excellent , the food is excellent we had the entrees one of cruditÃ©s and one of the cheese burrata which were very tasty and we had very well made drinks of martinis , then the main dishes one of gnocchi with lobster and mine was of fish Saint Pierre : I can say it was excellent made by a very good chef , I was really thrilled by the dinner and will sure come back ."}
{"text":"unique location (at the heart of downtown montreal, in the newly renovated ritz carlton), customer oriented staff, upscale decoration, and most importantely very nicely crafted food (i had lamb raviolis, delicious), and a great selection of wines (I had a rather delectable pinot noir)."}
{"text":"Love sitting at the bar. The food is good and the service was great. Had some sort of baked brie or camembert which was delicious. The bartender suggested an amazing brandy with a pear in the bottle ... Poire Williams I think. It was delicious."}
{"text":"Magnifique expÃ©rience! Nous sommes allÃ©s Ã  la Maison Boulud pour cÃ©lÃ©brer une occasion spÃ©ciale, et nous n'avons pas Ã©tÃ© dÃ©Ã§u!. L'ambiance Ã©tait chaleureuse, et le personnel accueillant. Nous Ã©tions assis dans les jardins du Ritz. La tempÃ©rature s'Ã©tant rafraÃ®chi en cette soirÃ©e printaniÃ¨re, il y avait des chaufferettes extÃ©rieures pour nous rÃ©chauffer et profiter ainsi du calme extÃ©rieur.   Nous avons optÃ© pour le menu dÃ©gustation. Il s'agissait d'un menu six services, avec une grande variÃ©tÃ© de plats et de saveurs. Ceviche, crabe des neiges, homard et gnocchi, flÃ©tan, mÃ©daillon de boeuf, et finalement un dessert chocolat et mandarine, agrÃ©mentÃ© de madeleines fraÃ®ches et de morceaux de chocolats variÃ©s.   Je recommande dÃ©finitivement ce restaurant a qui veut souligner une occasion spÃ©ciale, ou tout simplement vivre une expÃ©rience culinaire unique Ã  MontrÃ©al! Bravo!"}
{"text":"Meh. I have not been impressed here or at Daniel for dinner. Lots of places I would go to ahead of this"}
{"text":"For me the best restaurant in montreal. The service is always impeccable, any time we go there. Their menu is just excellent all throughout the year. This is my go-to restaurant for special occasions and I recommend it to anyone !"}
{"text":"We had lunch at a Maison Boulud this week. It was an exceptional experience in every sense of the word. The service was in a class by itself. We had the two course offering: green salad and breem fish. It was the most elegant meal we had on this visit. The ingredients were superb, the preparation was truly world class. The Chardonnay I paired with fish was superb. Again, the service was an stand out.   This restaurant offered us the most elegant dining experience, and the second best meal-for the-price value on this trip, the first being Notkins. But lets remember, they are different experiences."}
{"text":"I went there for lunch just because it was closed to the Fine art museum, which I was visiting. Their Launch menu was simple but fantastic. Their wines by the glass are also interesting!"}
{"text":"Awesome brunch! The orange juice taste like one of those that you can only get if you're living on a farm. I will definitely come back to try their dinner."}
{"text":"I stayed in the Ritz hotel which hosts this restaurant.   We did not eat a full meal here but came for cocktails two or three times during our stay and shared a burger at the bar.   The bartenders are friendly, knowledgeable and executed across the board on classics and contemporary cocktails alike.   The menu is not cheap but the care that goes into the cocktails justifies their costs."}
{"text":"Disapointed for breakfast. Pricey for the quality-there's much better breakfasts in this town.  THere were good things and bad things:  GOOD:  1. Very well executed eggs benedict, with spinach.  Very subtle and elegant. Potatoes were perfectly salty and nicely crispy.  2.  Pain perdu was wonderful with accompanying compote of cranberry which was not too sweet.  The creme fresche too.   3.  Great setting and decor. 4.  Friendly service, if a bit lazy. Manager did not seem warm and welcoming.  BAD:  1.   Green tea was badly executed.  Maybe 3-4 grams for 400ML.  Temperature about 190.  That is terrible, and tasted terrible.  It was prepared with a paper tea bag-most tea drinkers know that paper tea bags leave residual bad flavors, and this one did.  Green tea is supposed to be executed between 150-180.  3-4 grams should be about 120-180ml.  Waiter insisted that the second green tea was called \"crocetia\" a Japanese tea.  I told him that I didn't believe there was any such Japanese tea, and asked him to bring the bag over.  He refused at first, and insisted that it was indeed Crocetia.  He  later did bring the bag.  It was not crocetia but kokeicha.  I didn't know if it was \"formed\" tea or \"twig\" tea, so I decided not to order since I was getting a pretty typical Quebec \"I don't know and I'm not going ot find out experience\".  The genmai cha was week, tasted bad and smelled funny.  The manager had to be told to take it off the bill despite my telling him the tea was bad.  Also a typical Quebec experience.  2.  The smoked salmon was supposedly made by an artisinal smoked salmon maker.  They need to find a better one.  Lemeac has much better salmon with real character.  Lawrence as well.  Both make their own.  This is a high end place and this salmon tasted almost as though they were trying to replicate a salmon that people who frequent ordinary delicatessens in New York might like.  It's color and texture were disapointing.  there wasnt' the firm waxy smoothness or the smokiness of a good Scottish or Norwegian style salmon.  It tasted like cheap deli nova which in NY mostly comes from the same provider.  It is too soft, a strange color and lacks firmness, smokiness and good flavoring.  3.  Presentation-great except for a pooling of grease on our plate under the potatoes.  4.  Didn't offer additional coffee-had to ask for my wife who had said, \"maybe they charge for additional coffee\".   5.  No bread provided-perhaps you have to order it and pay for it.   6.  Prices were high and the product was not as good as other less pricey restaurants for breakfast. 7.  Manager had to be asked to take the tea off the bill-seemd a little testy about that.  Should have offered when I cgave him my comments.  Did not.  That is unacceptable in a restaurant like this.   8.  Bagel was hard and dry.  9.  Cream cheese was nothign special.  Tasted almost like store bought Philadelphia brand, though it was grainier.    I think maybe Daniel has too many restaurants.  Ramsay has the same problem. If you come to Montreal, you better make sure your staff is not carrying around a lot of Montreal service habits."}
{"text":"Daniel Boulud, where have you been all my life? How do you know when you are missing something that you have never been to, before? Simple... I want to go back for dinner tonight, tomorrow and the night after that.  The decor is elegant and beautiful. The seating was so comfortable that I don't know why others can't be so comfortable. The table setting was elegant and understated. The bread was divine. The food flavourful. The presentation was so beautiful that you wonder if you should eat the food or take it home and put it on the wall. Art, that's what it was, art.  Not since I have been in Paris in a Michelin starred restaurant have I had such beautiful and tasty food. And considering the service, the table, the comfort and the food, this is reasonably priced.  Daniel Boulud, you will be seeing me, soon."}
{"text":"Dang... I'm not sure they gave me the royal treatment because I booked thru my Amex but this restaurant Maison Boulud in Montreal was unreal with the service and food... 6 stars!"}
{"text":"The service is great and the ambience impeccable. The food was not as good as I expected. I got Three Course Prix-Fixe Menu for 39, I ordered Crispy Fried Egg Salad, it was only okay. POULET CHASSEUR which was a little bit too salty, chicken is not well done, a bit too raw for me inside, the potato was perfect. I got VERRINE AU CHOCOLAT for my dessert, which was too sweet for me."}
{"text":"If you are a Daniel Boulud fan this spot delivers the goods!!!!    Staying at the Ritz Carlton and spotted the restaurant when we left to go to the spot the concierge booked for us. We walked in and out of the first place and then circled back and did a walk in table for four at Maison Boulud. Spectacular service and food. Started with the fresh Canadian oysters and a beautiful whiteburgundy off a well thought out wine list. Moved into the egg yolk ricotta filled ravioli with the black truffle sauce and finished up with the rack of suckling pig..   Absolutely spectacular evening. This is not a inexpensive or moderate priced restaurant but if you are a foodie who pays up for the food and the experience its worth every cent. Was psyched to learn theRitz serves breakfast in the same restaurant. Amazing cheese and meat course to start. Two at our table had thescrambled eggs with a huge serving of beautiful salmon . My daughter had the waffle with chocolate sauce and whipped Creme and I enjoyed the to die for Eggs Benedict ..    I wouldn't stay. Anywhere else and I will absolutely be back to Maison Boulud again.....I highly recommend it!    Trust me on this, just go, bring your amex card and close your eyes and enjoy....."}
{"text":"Maison Boulud is one of the better fine dining establishments in Montreal. The price tag may be steep for some and lend itself to only special occasions for others, but the food, service, and atmosphere make up for any hesitations you may have concerning the price.  The quality of service I would put second to none as there were always people coming around to fill up glasses of water and just be in the vicinity to ensure you are taken care of without being over bearing so you can enjoy your special evening.   The food is amazing and lives up to the name and reputation of its chef's namesake. The dishes are creatively presented and put together to have that elegant and formal presentation, with the tastes being just as good. The seasonal menu is not large, but balanced with a few options in each category such as pastas, fish, meats, and specials. I started off with some oysters and a tomato salad appetizer that was delicious! The beef duo as the main course was amazing with 2 different cuts of meat that were both tender and cooked to perfection.   Lastly, the atmosphere is as classic as the Ritz within which the restaurant resides. I have never eaten inside but the setting looks intimate and classy as you walk past the fire and bar to the back covered patio, which is beside a duck pond and grassy area in the back courtyard. The furniture is simple and comfortable to create an atmosphere for a great evening.  The only thing holding back the 5 star rating is that amongst the great restaurants to chose from in Montreal, this one is among the top of the price range so I feel there are better values out there for great food. However, I still feel it is one of the better places to try for that special occasion or elegant date."}
{"text":"Went there during the grand prix weekend, the chef Daniel was there with a big crowd. Food was delicious and the cocktail with the ice ball with flowers inside was superb. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Love this place. Been her for Dinner, lunch, and breakfast. Outstanding quality, service, and food.  Go."}
{"text":"I think we came on an off-night because our experience was nothing like all the spectacular reviews written about this place! :(  Hubby decided to bring me here for my birthday dinner a couple nights ago, and we were super excited given all the great things written about this restaurant.   Upon arrival, our car was immediately taken to be parked ($16, not bad) and we were taken into the restaurant where our coats were put away and we were shown to our seats in the quieter area of the restaurant near the back terrace. The restaurant was clean, dimly lit, and well furnished. The main spectacle was the open kitchen where you could see Chef Boulud preparing all the meals (only saw this in passing since we were seated in a different section of the restaurant).  We initially wanted to order the degustation menu, but since they wouldn't tell us what dishes they were going to serve (surprise style), we decided against it as I'm a bit of a picky eater (ps. If you want the tasting menu, everyone on your table has to have it too.. Something I found a little strange). Anyways we ordered the following dishes: Appetizers: Cheese stuffed ravioli (was swimming in a soup kind of thing. Not very good.. Was missing something) and the cocoa marbled foie gras (ok but not as amazing as it sounds. It needed to be more..moist.. Also it wasn't too flavorful. Main dishes: Duo de boeuf (just ok. You can get better tasting meat at Gibbys...) and the Pot au feu (was so excited for this one... Came with several pieces of beef, one small cube of chicken with a crispy crust, and small pork stuffed raviolis. The beef was good, but again, better at Gibbys. The chicken was a little dry. The ravioli were undercooked so I didn't eat most of them). Side: wild mushrooms (hefty portion that we couldn't finish. Good but too salty) Dessert: Baba au Rum (so so disappointing) and the chocolate lava cake (finally something phenomenal).  All in all, the food wasn't really good...a 2/5..martinis were very strong and tasty so 5/5.. Service was impeccable so 5/5.. And prices are what you expect them to be so no comment haha. I'd give this restaurant an overall 3/5 for the great service and drinks but will definitely not be back....."}
{"text":"We (2 adults) walked in on a Sunday morning around 8:30 for breakfast before our flight home.  At first he hostess said they don't take any non hotel guests for breakfast.  The place only had maybe 5 tables occupied.  I said we had to be out in an hour anyways to get to the airport and they accommodated.  We sat on the nice back patio.  The scenery and seating was nice.  The garden is really pretty with 5 ducks swimming around.  We did a la carte.  I got the dejeuner fermier with scrambled eggs, a sausage, and a montreal bagel.  It was very filling and good.  My husband had the eggs bennie and he enjoyed it.  They could have filled my OJ a little more without me asking for a refill.  Nice for a quiet Sunday breakfast."}
{"text":"I really liked the atmosphere and the service. The tasting menu was fine..."}
{"text":"Fancy brunch spot - beautiful space and garden - grub is just ok.  If you order the buffet, you'll practically get everything on the menu - but it is not that spectacular and pastries did not seem fresh.  The 2 eggs special with bacon or sausage was fine.  The goat cheese n fig quiche was a winner for the buffet.  I was expecting more from a Boulud resto. The Mimosas made the experience divine. Service was swift and everyone very accommodating. If you're feeling fancy after you've checked out of the Ritz, Boulud might fit your bill. However, it would probably be better to take an Uber to one of the many little bistros that this beautiful city has to offer.  Would I come back for a $200 brunch for 3? Prolly not , but I definitely see myself drinking mimosas in their garden again! Merci for that!"}
{"text":"When I was about to enter Maison Boulud I'll be honest: I thought it would be a high-end restaurant in a high-end hotel and that because of this it was likely to be a dinner with average food at an exorbitant price.  I was wrong. I must say, I was quite impressed by this new Montreal restaurant. From start to finish it delivered on every level.   First impressions rarely lie and I knew I might be in for a pleasant surprise when we stepped in and the Maitre D', Cyril (formerly from Europea), welcomed us by our names without having heard us speak anything but a simple hello. This shows professionalism, commitment and dedication to one's work and these qualities were further displayed when, before our dinner day, emails to the restaurant were promptly replied to, even at 8:30 AM, a time where most are either sleeping or trying to get into a semi-functional state. My wife had been in touch with him as it was a surprise birthday dinner and she wanted to make sure the vegetarian was well taken care of!  It is important to note this. If the Maitre D is of this level it is very unlikely his staff will be any different and throughout the evening the staff proved this theory to be true. The service at Maison Boulud is excellent. The waiting staff strikes a perfect balance between high-end and casual. It is always very attentive without being stuffy. They are very friendly without trying to be your \"buddy\". They always make you feel like they are at your disposal without standing around like statues. They are constantly going around tables but you do not feel or notice their presence until you need them and magically here they are, just at the right time, and always willing to help in a way that doesn't make you feel like you're bothering them.  I've been to numerous high-end restaurants and the service at Maison Boulud would best or match the very best of the group.  Onto the food and as in all my reviews I will write about the vegetarian side of things. It offers a really interesting take on a restaurant as very often you will stretch the kitchen into dishes they don't normally make. The question usually is: will they copy paste something bland together or will they go out of their way to create dishes with creativity and flavor to it? This, in my admittedly biased opinion, really sets aside the best restaurants from the rest as it shows an extra level of dedication to their client base and, more importantly, that the kitchen has a wide array of skill sets and is willing to step out of its normal flavor and ingredient boundaries to create something special.  On this, Boulud performed very well. To keep it simple I will rate each part of the meal in chronological order. Forgive me for the lack of description but since our meal i have forgotten some details.  0 - Terrible 10 - Orgasmic  Cocktail (9): Jade Green - I don't recall the name exactly but it was a beautiful green cocktail with cucumber/citrus/basil flavors. Very nice balance of flavors and an eye-catching ice centerpiece that gradually melts flavor into the glass.  Bread (10): Yes I am rating bread but only for this review. The bread/butter at Maison Boulud is face-stuffing worthy. Simple fresh bread. I think we had 3 baskets. Small details like this once again separates the best from the rest. - 10   Beet Salad (8): Beautiful presentation. When I saw the dish and tasted is when I knew the dinner would might be special.  Butternut squash ravioli (9.5): Some of the best bites I've ever had. I would go back and eat 4 of those and call it a night. You just have to try it to understand, even my meat-eating wife was quite impressed!  Mushrooms w/egg, emulsion and lettuce (7.5): This one was just OK. It was good, just less than everything else. Mix of mushrooms with an egg you break on top of it and mix. I felt like this one lacked a little extra flavor.  Hazelnut potatoes w/vegetables (8.0): Never had hazelnut potatoes before but they were quite good. Perfectly fried. Crisp outside with a light golden color and soft as a pillow inside. A well done dish and I love seeing a generic ingredient like potato done differently.  Lemon tart with roasted pine nuts, figs and ice cream (7.75): The only reason why I rate this a 7.5 is because my wife's dessert was mind blowing and mine wasn't. And I was the birthday boy! Ok, mine was quite good but I just wanted to eat hers as it was one of the best tasting dessert i've ever had :)   And to finish the review, I'd also like to point out how beautiful the restaurant is. The decor is beautiful and just like the service, it retains the high-end feeling without making you feel like you should act differently. The colors and glass walls are especially beautiful and the fire \"pit\" in the middle is a great highlight.  In conclusion, Maison Boulud is a must go in Montreal and while the price point is above average, it is worth the money, even for vegetarians.  Vegetarian Food: 4.25 Service: 4.85 Value: 4.00"}
{"text":"Located in the newly renovated Ritz-Carlton Hotel, Maison Boulud has all the ingredients to be a staple on the Montreal restaurant scene. Daniel Bouluds (of Cafe Boulud Fame in NYC) new high-end restaurant has been opened for nearly three weeks and has started to create a buzz. While the lunch and dinner menus look fantastic, it was the brunch menu that piqued our interest. There are only a few options available on the high-end brunch (Renoir, Cafe Birks), so this was a welcome addition.  First, before getting to the food, lets discuss the restaurant itself. The space is quite large, but with relatively few tables and feels both busy and intimate at the same time. Expertly decorated, the centrepiece is the open kitchen, where Chef Boulud could be seen working the pans on a recent Sunday morning. Despite the renovations, the hotel decided to keep the inner garden, and the restaurant has a beautiful terrace overlooking the duck pond.   Now on to the food! The brunch menu consists of entrees and main courses, available a la carte or in a prix fixe style. Though more expensive than your regular scrambled eggs and bacon (36$) the meal comes together quite well. Numerous salty and sweet options are available.   For the main course, everything from french toast to home made gnocchi to the classic hangover beater steak and eggs are available. We opted for two classic dishes, the gravlax with latkes and the croque madame. While far from extravagant, the attention to detail raise these two dishes from regular brunch to four star level. Not to be overlooked are the fries accompanying the croque madame which may be some of the best in the city.  Our waiter seem to have no idea how to handle his completely packed section. Luckily, after long waits between arriving, receiving coffee and ordering, the very nice Maitre D' stepped in and took care of our service.  Final Verdict : We will be back, if only to spend a night on that beautiful terrace."}
{"text":"A great Boulud!!! Fantastic restaurant - food was amazing, staff friendly and knowledgeable, ambiance great Totally recommend!"}
{"text":"The Cosmo de l'Orient is the best cocktail you'll have in the city.   It's lovely to come in the summer and sit outside but the indoor atmosphere is still great. Other than that this restaurant doesn't meet the standard you'd expect. I've had pretty good meals and just OK ones. It would be nice if there was a bit more consistency."}
{"text":"Not perfect. Should be for the extravagant price. Pros: Nice atmosphere, good food, great cocktails. Cons; Woman's menu has prices, bill brought to table without asking, stingy on wine pours."}
{"text":"I originally made the booking because I wanted the 3 course set menu for $45 but the night we arrived it was no longer on the website.   So we went for the degustation.  It was more expensive at $95 per head but our view at that point was that it'd still be cheaper than any decent degustation in New York.   We really enjoyed the menu. The chef Riccardo came out for a meet and greet half way through our menu so that was nice.   To start I had an amaretto sour which was superb.   I would recommend but wouldn't necessarily return due to the price."}
{"text":"Upon reading the comments from other Yelpers, I feel I didn't make the best choice from the menu when I went to Maison Boulud. It was a convenient option for me while I was staying in Montreal (nice when the restaurant is in the hotel!). I ordered a rigatoni pasta with alfredo sauce. It was pretty good and I was told the pasta was made fresh which is always a highlight - but oddly I don't think it tasted much different from pre-made pasta. The sauce was quite good but really buttery (make no mistake - I love butter, but twenty minutes into eating my dish I felt the once liquidy sauce started to solidify and at that point it tasted almost exclusively of butter). I felt the dish was missing something - chicken, vegetables perchance? Something to elevate it from simply pasta with a sauce. What I am seeing from the rest of the reviews is that Boulud's protein dishes are divine - which makes me think that next time a burger or a steak if where I should venture. The pictures of the beautifully-presented desserts also look enticing. Given I had a decent experience the first time at Boulud, I'm open to giving it another chance. Until next time, Maison Boulud!"}
{"text":"Glorious wine selection and divine food inspired by a great chef! The variety of options to choose from will definitely satisfy whatever craving you may have. The service is beyond fantastic and your order will always be served with the utmost perfection in mind.  I'm a big fan of their Tropezienne Salad, Lamb Ravioli, and mouthwatering, perfectly cooked seafood (Salmon, Scallops, and Cod).  Elegant, classy, creative, passionate and unique are just a few words to describe this gem at the Ritz Carlton! They have a beautiful garden in the back, with ducks quacking around the pond and the most relaxing ambiance."}
{"text":"This very posh restaurant is located in the Ritz Carlton Montreal. The decor inside is contemporary, trendy, and elegant. There are walls of cut glass squares decorating the main rooms with a large fireplace in the center. My family and I were seated in a dining area that was private, we believe because Daniel in NYC catered my wedding 2 years ago and the recognized our name in their system.  It was a nice touch.   We had to wait 10-15 minutes to get any menus but after that the service was impeccable. Our bread was replaced the second we finished it, our water was constantly filled, if our wine was empty more was brought out.   There was a special menu for Christmas which had a pretty good variety of options. My husband and I settled on the raviolo for a starter. It was one very marge ravioli filled with cheese and spinach and a poached egg, topped with leeks and mushrooms, in a parmesan foam and pesto sauce. It was pretty flavorful and good but we both agreed we would have liked the sauce to be a bit thicker so we could have eaten it more easily with the raviolo. My fathered ordered the mushroom soap with foie gras and he loved it. My ordered the foie gras and also enjoyed it throughly.   There was not a vegetarian option on the menu for the entree but they gladly made me a mushroom, tomato, squash pasta with a mushroom cream sauce. It was quite good. My husband got a pasta with duck ragout. He basically inhaled it he loved it so much. My mom got a fish entree and raved Bout it all through dinner and after. My dad got the steak duo and really liked it but had trouble finishing it because it was just a lot of steak.   We all shared the four desserts. They were very delicious and incredibly interesting. The sorbets and ice creams were paired perfectly with the flavors of the desserts. This was a very nice meal.   The staff was accommodating and very attentive. They were also very knowledgable regarding wines and each dish on the menu. They were constantly seeing if everything was alright with our meal. At the end, we were given a small basket of madeleines which we ended up taking home with us."}
{"text":"I had the three course tasting menu on New Years Eve and it was amazing! Delicious food, portion sizes on point and excellent service and ambiance!"}
{"text":"Ok, Montreal is supposed to be a French town, so I had high expectation for our dinner at Maison Boulud. We had the prix fixe menu on Christmas Eve--there were hits and misses. But I can honestly say, I've had better French food in Chicago than there.   I liked my foie gras terrine, the sweetbread (crispy outside and well seasoned), and my husband's dessert (some blood orange sorbet). I didn't like my veal, and I REALLY didn't like my husband's steak--it's weird, they both looked well cooked, mine was medium and my husband's steak was medium rare--but both were really chewy. One of the worst meat course I've had.   Next time we are in town, we'd still stay at the same hotel, but probably won't eat at this restaurant again."}
{"text":"Been here for Mothers' day once and now trying dinner. Everything was delicious and surprisingly light for French cuisine. Was good not to roll out of French restaurant for once. There were eight of us for a Birthday meal and not one of us had a complaint about the meal. Just lots of ooohing and aaaaahing. And I hate fish and only realized after I was given my soup there were bits of crab in the soup. It was still delicious! :)"}
{"text":"Best restaurant I've ever been too, very friendly and fancy . The food was to die for . Would definitely come back for a special occasion !"}
{"text":"Finally a place with class and where manners count.  I've had enough of the Joe Beefs and Au-Pied-de-Cochons of this city.  Exquisite food, excellent service and impeccable details, down to the napkins."}
{"text":"Superbe terrasse. Service hors pair et nourriture sublime. Nous avons passÃ© une soirÃ©e mÃ©morable."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic experience all around. We went for our 20th anniversary. The service was impeccable (our server was so friendly and personable--and we're Americans!!!), the ambience and table beautiful, classy and comfortable (sat next to the open air garden), and the wine and food phenomenal. This is one of those rare places where you pause after every bite or sip and relish what just happened. Expensive, but so worth it."}
{"text":"Delicious dinner our first in town. The restaurant is gorgeous, too.   We had the burrata, lobster gnocchi, ravioli, and John Dory. All delicious, but especially the lobster gnocchi.   Then we had fresh, hot Madeleines. To die for. The other desert (apple something) did not impress as much."}
{"text":"Excellent food, great service. Very happy I tried it, but too formal for me. But if you want to try one of the best restaurants in Montreal, this is the place."}
{"text":"Pretty much what you would expect from a Boulud property - great service, elegant atmosphere and creative food.   Not as hardcore on the dress code as Daniel in NYC, which is great (but I suppose to be expected being that it's located in a hotel).  A couple unique items on the menu which is a breath of fresh air; so many restaurants seem to feature the same trendy items these days.  Overall a great night out. Some proper cocktails, well shucked oysters, a fantastic Barolo by the glass, and some creative, well conceived and well prepared food."}
{"text":"Thoroughly enjoyable. Excellent food. Served in a timely manner. Nice atmosphere. Mary Catherine, delightful and attentive waitress. First appetizer - flat bread pizza, then oysters Rockefeller and veal carpaccio, all good! He had the rack of lamb, she had the lobster gnocchetti. Excellent! Dessert was fantastic. Their warm \"Madelines\" to swab up the chocolate left on the plate after some kind of a \"choco-lava\" cake. Yum. Sommelier, Isabella was very friendly and knowledgable and made two great, different wine recommendations through the meal. Will return next time in Montreal."}
{"text":"I have not had a bad meal at Maison Boulud. I have been to Maison Boulud for brunch and dinner. The food was excellent. The service was attentive and friendly. The ambiance was chic and upscale with a touch of old Hollywood glamour. The decor was gorgeous and worthy of being in the Ritz. On a hot summer day, the patio in the garden is an oasis.   The food here is vibrant and innovative. The use of fresh ingredients and the playing of delicious flavours makes Maison Boulud a technical tour de force. One of the standout dishes was the sea urchin with a light foam. It was decadent.   The prices are reasonable given the quality of the dishes. The prices are in line with similar high end restaurants.   I would highly recommend Maison Boulud."}
{"text":"3.5 stars rounding up to 4 for brunch.  I am a little torn about this review. The food here deserves a solid 5 stars. Monsieur Boulud lives up to his reputation and I have yet to be disappointed by his food. (LOVE Daniel in NY) The presentation, taste and creativity of his food is amazing. We thoroughly enjoyed our food here. It was delicious!  What I found surprising was the service. We frequent the Ritz(s) back at home - San Francisco, Half Moon Bay, Marina Del Rey, Lake Tahoe and have gotten used to a standard of service that I didn't quite find here in Montreal. We, by no means, had terrible service, but we didn't have great service either. It was the little things...my mimosa was forgotten, my silverware was forgotten so I had to ask for a set after my food arrived, our waters weren't refilled...it was just not something I expected to happen here at the Ritz. On the other hand, the gentleman in the front who fetched our coats for us was great so we at least left on a happy note.  The Ritz is beautiful though. Next time, we'll have to come try the champagne bar and afternoon tea.  Food:  Crispy fried egg with ham and marinated mushrooms - perfectly balanced with the sweetness of the mushrooms and the saltiness of the ham and creaminess and crunchiness of the egg. Really tasty!  Greek yogurt and berries - berries were sweet and the yogurt was thick and creamy  Eggs Benedict - the man friend had no complaints. He doesn't usually like eggs benedict but loved this.  Skate wing - beautiful presentation and incredibly tasty. The skate wing was a little bit crispy outside and moist inside. Loved it!!  Mini Madeleines - these were sooo good...I couldn't stop eating them. They came out warm with powdered sugar on top. Light and fluffy with a little zing of lemon. Addicting!"}
{"text":"It was good, honestly. Really good even. But not worth the price (and I am all in for an expensive meal if it. Is worth the experience. Maybe my expectations were too high. I had the brunch, tasted the eggs with truffle, tasted the burger (the bread was amazing). Speaking of bread, their selection is good too. Overall a great experience. I'll definitely try the supper menu and update my comment at a later date"}
{"text":"Wow. Loved it. If Michelin were in Canada, I'd be supportive of assigning them with one star."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this restaurant while in Montreal and it didn't disappoint! I was able to get a reservation for 8 pm on a Saturday night. We were seated outdoors facing a court yard that had a pond with ducks and a really beautiful view. The service here is impeccable. The server, sommelier and other workers are all so helpful and really know the menu. We started with the bluefin tuna carpaccio and this other starter that had uni, fluke crudo, and avocado wrapped crab. They were both delicious. I loved the fluke, especially because it was marinated so well. They each came with a type of cracker or chip. One was made with squid ink and rice flour. For entrees, I ordered the John Dory fillet. It came with cauliflower and potato in a potato purÃ©e. They were these clear potato chips on top, that were really cool looking. The dish was amazing. I loved it. My boyfriend had a halibut fillet that was cooked in Singapore curry and served with shrimp and clams. He also loved the flavor and enjoyed it very much. The food was great and the service was amazing. We had such an amazing experience at Maison Boulud!"}
{"text":"I am reviewing the brunch experience. This is one of the classiest restaurants in Montreal and the garden in the summer is absolutely stunning.   For the brunch you basically get several courses that are beautifully plated. From eggs to fish to waffles I thought everything was very good but nothing stood out as a memorable signature brunch dish."}
{"text":"My family held a post-wedding brunch here, my first complain is that we were 30 people who wanted to be able to be seated close to each other but were all separated into 3 different groups, far from one another. The intention was for the two families to use this brunch to get to know one another and we were robbed of that opportunity due to the poor arrangement. In some areas the service was very slow, I asked for water with no ice and I did not receive it until after my appetizer was brought out. I ordered orange juice when the appetizer was served and did not receive it till almost the end of second course. In conclusion, this place has a nice ambiance but the food and service is mediocre for the price you pay."}
{"text":"My family decided to have brunch here on a Saturday. It was my first time at Maison Boulud so I was pretty stoked to try it.   Good : The service was exceptional. Honestly, the hospitality is above anything I've experienced, everything from the hostess to waiters is very polite. My glass was constantly refilled, unbelievable good service. The decor was beautiful, we were seated outdoors and the garden was gorgeous (until my mom pointed out 'Look at all those dirty looking buildings behind it!). For appetizers, I've ordered the veal carpaccio and it was delicious. I had the trout as my main, and it was hands down the best fish I've ever had. Basically, every dish I picked was a hit!  Bad : Everyone else's food.  My mom ordered a Croissant de Chez Hofkelsten Farci, which is a fancy name for soggy croissant with way too much cheese. My sister had the Ouefs Muerette, which translates to boring eggs benedict in English. My father ordered the DBGB Burger, which he never mentioned if it was good or not.   Bottom line: I've sampled their plates as well and concluded that is very subpar for the price. Location is nice, the decor is stunning, but I wasn't blown away by any other dish...except the trout."}
{"text":"I recently had the chance to try out this resto for breakfast located in the heart of our beautiful city! My expectations were exceeded! Loved, loved everything about this well reknowned resto and it deserves 5 star rating! Let's begin with the resto ambiance..as soon as you walk into this resto you are greeted by a super friendly hostess with a great big smile! The decor is absolutely stunning and glamourous creating a warm welcoming feeling. The moment you walk in , you get a sense of being transported away! At the end of the resto is the stupendous beautifully glass covered veranda overlooking the beautiful garden and pond. Nothing like having breakfast in a beautiful glass veranda creating a zen-like feeling. Onto the food, wow ...we tried the pain perdu and egg's benedict dishes as well as a side order of smoked home and basket of four warmly baked goodies croissant, chocolatine, raspberry tartelette ....every bite just melted in your mouth. Yes the prices for some of these breakfast dishes are quite expensive but they really worth it!!  This is a great place to celebrate an anniversary, wedding proposal, birthday milestone or a girls weekend outing! I recommend trying this out at least once in a lifetime! The resto is adjacent to the luxiourious Ritz Carlton hotel! You can walk into the lobby for a sneak peek! The egg's benedict were not like any egg's benedict...the hollandaise sauce was light and delicious! Yummy!  Reservations are a must!  Simply amazing foodie experience! Check out my pictures."}
{"text":"Great service and amazing terrace where you can have an excellent Sunday brunch. You can get a buffet service or a la Carte, what I normally take  If you love terraces, you definitely won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"You gotta eat here. Yes it's pricey, yes they will take their sweet time bringing out everything but you will have consumed one of the best meals of your life which will lead you into thinking about how to earn more money and eat every month here (I watched Narcos a few times). But even if you wanted to indulge that one special time then this place is perfect. Menu does change regularly from what I can see as others have posted here."}
{"text":"DÃ©finitivement une amÃ©lioration au \"Ritz\" que ce restaurant la \"Maison Boulud\". Le cuisine est moderne et variÃ© avec une carte raisonnable (au niveau budget) le midi en semaine.  L'ambiance est moderne avec un style qu'on retrouve dans les resto Ã  la mode un peu partout dans le monde. Ils ont une belle grande verriÃ¨re Ã  l'arriÃ¨re qui donne sur une terrasse ouverte l'Ã©tÃ©. Le service est profesionel et efficace."}
{"text":"Overall this is a nice restaurant. The wine was good that they introduce. The appetizer is a very small portion. The main course tastes very good. The service was very good. But it took hour and a half to get the main dish on the table. Price is ok for a restaurant like this."}
{"text":"I was staying at the Ritz and I arrived rather late so I decided to eat at the restaurant on the property. I got a seat at the bar and I must say, they were the most comfortable bar stools I have ever encountered. The atmosphere was intimate and luxe.   The bartender was very friendly and helped me pick out a wine to enjoy as I am not that familiar with European wines. I was not wanting anything particularly heavy before bed but apparently heavy food is all you'll get here. I sort of let this affect my overall rating but only because I felt that some items were a bit misleading.  I got the herb salad and the half order of the gnocchi. The herb salad was delicious but the entire bottom of the salad was thick, creamy cheese. It was good but there was more cheese than salad! There was also an egg of some sort, I am guessing quail. The gnocchi was delicious but the \"coral emulsion\" is a very heavy cream sauce. For just those two items and two glasses of wine, my total was over $100. I know people don't go to a restaurant like this to dine cheaply but I guess I just felt that what I ate wasn't that amazing. It was tasty but definitely not something I'd rave about."}
{"text":"Service is impeccable. They went out of their way to accommodate my pregnant wife, making her a new amuse bouche from scratch (it was a Valentine's Day meal). There are no flaws to speak of in the food, it's well executed with no missteps.  Would definitely recommend this restaurant for a special night"}
{"text":"I had been looking forward to the visit when I first made travel plans and reservations. The visit did not disappoint; it was an all-around great experience. We were seated in the sun room overlooking the back courtyard. Snow had fallen all day and continued to fall during the meal so the evening had a tranquil cast to it. The room was separated from the rest of the restaurant; comfortable wood chairs and large tables populated this room with a casualness that reminded me of a ski chalet.  As entrÃ©e, I had duck breast, a large portion, medium rare, served as large chunks with radicchio. The duck skin was crisp and crackled. It was perfect. Separately, we shared the potatoes (German Butterball) with truffles. Cooked to perfect consistency, the savory potatoes were garlicky well-seasoned, nutty, and delicious. We scraped ever last bit of the dish into our tummies. It was possibly the best potatoes I have ever had; the dish inspired me to improve my own version. I intend to purchase Chef Boulud's recently-released cookbook for other inspirations.  Dessert was a chocolate/hazelnut crunch and separately, limoncello sorbet. I loved the two flavors together and am glad that it was a departure from the chocolate/raspberry combination offered at most places. Structural sugar element added taste, dimension (and wow) to the meal.  Service was impeccable. Reminded me of the level of service received at Commander's Palace many, many moons ago. The waitstaff synchronized the delivery of the meal so that all the plates touched the table at the same time. It was like a waltz. I saw pride in their delivery; they knew that small details impress and make a lasting impression."}
{"text":"It doesn't matter what you choose from this seasonally changing menu. Everything is amazing. The fall menu had just arrived so there are more comfort food items to choose from as the weather cools.  As an entree I took the razor clam, dungeness crab and sea urchin plate. It was dabbled with dashi gelÃ©e and an avocado roll with shima aji. Wow! Light and fresh. Also tried the terrine de foie gras which was surprisingly light as well but still rich. Accompanied by a Pinot noir it went down very easy.  For the main meal I had the homemade pasta with lamb shoulder. This is comfort food at its finest. Braised vegetables and fall off the bone meat I was in heaven. My partner had the potato gnocchi with lobster. I found the lobster perfectly cooked but an odd contrast with gnocchi. The sauce that was poured on it was an elegant maitake mushroom,leek an coral emulsion that on its own would have been a soup I'd pay for. I spooned every last drop. So elegant and flavours you've never tasted married together before.  You can't resist desert at Maison Boulud... we tried the chocolate salted caramel lava cake that was so rich, I couldn't finish it. I tried! The other desert was a light strawberry pistachio limoncello baba with a scoop of basil sorbet that was to die for.   Obviously you can't eat here everyday unless you're super wealthy, but for a special occasion, you must try it. The bill for 2 is half a G, but I'm not complaining... I'm just sad I can't eat here once a week."}
{"text":"Incroyable expÃ©rience ! C'est dans le cadre de mon travail que je m'y suis rendue, reÃ§ue par le chef trois Ã©toiles Daniel Boulud dans son nouveau restaurant du Ritz Carlton.  Je n'y ai pas diner ou dÃ©jeuner mais simplement fait une dÃ©gustation de fromages, charcuteries et vins franÃ§ais. Raffinement et perfection ne sont mÃªmes pas de mots assez forts pour dÃ©finir ce restaurant. La charcuterie Ã©tait juste divine, le foie gras incroyable ! La qualitÃ© des fromages tous importÃ©s de France, splendide et les vins n'Ã©taient que des grands crus ! Le clou du spectacle: des petites madeleines citronÃ©es servies tiÃ¨des avec le cafÃ©.  La dÃ©coration est splendide, toute de baies vitrÃ©es et de boiseries! Le luxe Ã  l'Ã©tat pur !"}
{"text":"Great date night spot! The outdoor patio area was absolutely beautiful! Must great the  chocolate coolant for dessert! Great service as well!"}
{"text":"Located in the Ritz Carlton -- it's a very fancy place. The patio overlooks a very nicely landscaped garden. Food was good -- fresh ingredients, nice presentation, cooking brings out taste of ingredients rather than overwhelming palette with too much seasoning and herbs. Staff wasn't very friendly so gave 4 stars."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my prix fixe Valentine's Day dinner here.  My husband and I had tried to get a sort of last-minute table here for other special occasions and you really should reserve ahead.  Anyways it was one of the pricier tables.  After reviewing the menu we were not expecting a lot.  However, our meal was delicous and the sommelier does a wonderful job.  Very impressed on balance with our wine flight pairing.  I rarely get to say that.  Based on one visit, for me - this is as good as it gets in Montreal for the food alone.  The environment is a bit stale but perfect for a special occasion and romantic as we were seated by the fireplace and our server was just perfect and really made everything right.  I lived in the NYC area for 5-6 years and it has become my benchmark for fine dining world wide.  I have tried at least 80% of the top fine dining restaurants in Montreal.  Recently, Chasse et Peche which was our second though we've been to Le Filet their sister restaurant many times (another favorite of mine), Chez l'Epicier and Europea last month.  What I look for in a great restaurant experience is to be surprised for a 1 or more dishes.  So I also look at the ease of obtaining the ingredients (it it hard for me?), interesting flavor profiles/ pairings, superlative freshness of course and advanced techniques that either I'm not familiar with or I might be but it would just be too much effort to coordinate at home.  That having been said I did not think that the dishes were too busy or that some flavors were mentioned in the description but didn't really show up in the final plate.  Personally I would love to see more restaurants like Maison Boulud here in Montreal.  Boulud's flagship is in NYC where he operates 5 restaurants or so.  So happy to have found this place.  I'll be looking for consistency.  Looking forward to trying a cocktail!  We'll be back soon."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here because we were staying at the Ritz, and it was everything it should have been. My water was never empty, my wine glass was never empty, the servers and bussers were always nearby when I needed something, but not hovering. I liked the fireplace quite a lot.   I got the Hazelnut Crusted Sea Scallops. Oh my god, every bit as amazing as it sounded on paper. For desert we got the Coffee and Cardamom Dessert, Crispy Tuile, Shortbread Biscuit and Espresso Ice Cream. Seriously, amazing. Between dinner and the excellent wine we got, we racked up quite the bill, but for every once in a while, totally worth it."}
{"text":"We hadnt been to the bar at the ritz for 20 years and were not disappointed.  Vicki got a concoction of chambord and limoncello that was like a sweet tart version of raspberry lemonade.  I had the oriental cosmo which had a cool ice ball with orchid leaves in it.  Both were very solid cocktails."}
{"text":"I went there for brunch and supper.  As soon as you step into this restaurant, you feel like a VIP. One of the best service you'll get in the city. Super attentive service. I was more impressed by supper than brunch because I was hungry very shortly after brunch even though I ate a steak. Yes I know, who eats a steak for brunch? Well, me! It's on the menu so somebody has to eat it. I had a steak for supper, it was perfect so I went for more at brunch. Everything I had at this place was succulent. I like to eat in the garden, it's zen and beautiful.  I didn't have their tasting menu yet but hopefully I'll get to try it soon.  Obviously the place is pricey since its signed Boulud.  If you want to spoil a very special someone , it's the place to be."}
{"text":"Nous nous sommes prÃ©sentÃ©s un dimanche pour le brunch dans aucune rÃ©servation. Nous avons vraiment Ã©tÃ© chanceux d'avoir une place pour manger, mÃªme si c'Ã©tait au bar. L'ambiance est bien et mÃªme en Ã©tant au bar, c'est possible d'en profiter au maximum aussi. Le serveur Ã©tait trÃ¨s sympathique et a bien pris le temps d'expliquer les menus et de s'assurer que tout Ã©tait bien clair pour nous. Le service est trÃ¨s rapide aussi. Pour le brunch, il y a possibilitÃ© de faire des combos avec l'entrÃ©e / plat principal et le dessert. Tu peux prendre deux assiettes seulement (entrÃ©e/plat ou plat/dessert). Tu peux aussi y aller Ã  la carte. Les portions sont quand mÃªme gÃ©nÃ©reuses. J'ai pris l'entrÃ©e de saumon fumÃ© et c'Ã©tait un dÃ©lice. J'ai pris ensuite le burger qui semble Ãªtre un classique de la place. La prÃ©sentation est soignÃ©e pour un simple burger ce qui rend Ã§a encore plus appÃ©tissant. Par contre, mÃªme si les frites Ã©taient bonnes, je m'attendais Ã  un petit kick de plus. Une petite Ã©pice secrÃ¨te qui aurait fait la diffÃ©rence. J'ai pris comme dessert les sorbets, les choix sont variÃ©s et tout aussi dÃ©licieux un que l'autre! C'est frais et pas trop lourd aprÃ¨s un gros repas. Ã essayer au moins une fois!"}
{"text":"Good service, great ambiance. Had the thon bluefin carpaccio as a starter, it was a bit salty for me but the lobster gnocchi was reaaaaaaaaaaal good.  My favorite part was obviously the dessert Limoncello and Praline- YUM! We also got Madeleines on the house, it was super good. Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Had brunch here on New Year's Day. Absolutely fabulous food!  Artfully presented you feel bad even eating eat!  Brunch was a three course set menu.  It was a bit overwhelming at first as it seemed like a lot of food, but the courses were well balanced and of good proportion. They appeared and tastes rich but were not too filling."}
{"text":"excellent food, okay experience First I'll start with the bad: when we first arrived we were seated at a table at which the ceiling was dripping. No big deal, it was a rainy and humid day, and may have just been the AC unit. We were moved a table over, and this time the ceiling was dripping right onto my menu, where my food would later be. We were moved one last time, at which point we called the waitress over to ask for some salt and pepper, and she remarked \"still moving are we?\" which took us a little aback as it was a bit of a snide remark. We let it go, and were soon brought some salt and pepper, except that the salt shaker was empty. We then asked the waiter for a filled salt shaker to which she remarked \"aren't we lucky\" not \"I'm sorry\" or anything. In addition, the chair I was seated in seemed on the verge of breaking and was quite rickety, and a hair was found in our bread (none of our hairs as it was blonde and we are all brunettes). The manager did apologize for the reseating and offered us a free appetizer. The good: when the food did come out, it was amazing. I can't complain about the portion size, as it was very filling. I got the steak and it was cooked to perfection.  Overall, it was a good dining experience, although I don't foresee the waitress who served us lasting there long."}
{"text":"Maison Boulud is a ritzy place which is fitting given its location inside the Ritz Carlton Montreal.  This is your typical overpriced restaurant with tiny, pretentious portions which I can't say are highly memorable.  The food is top quality and well-executed, but there's something left to be desired.  The sockeye salmon is a very good dish as is the filet beuf, but aside from the meat on the dish, all the other trimmings on the plate are uninspiring and simply there for fluff.  You leave the restaurant still feeling hungry with a large dent in your wallet.  Overall conclusion:  the food is not commensurate with the prices."}
{"text":"Came to Montreal for the holidays.  Called ToquÃ© to get reservations but they were on Holiday Closure for the weeks I was in town.  They recommended MB.  I'm so happy they did.  It was at the end of the trip and after visiting several highly rated restaurants.   We were seated in the back room overlooking the garden that had holiday lights.  I thought I would have been happier in the main room, but I was wrong.  Our section was filled and full of life & laughter. I had the beef tenderloin and it was fantastic.  Our server recommended a great shared appetizer and a fantastic chocolate (extremely decadent & very rich on the chocolate side) dessert.  It was the perfect ending and the best meal experienced in town.  Will definitely go back and well worth the $$$."}
{"text":"Had Sunday brunch with friends. Ordered the 3 serving menu for fifty something bucks. It was worth every penny. I have to give it to French chefs, the experience at this restaurant is so unique that it makes prices irrelevant on the menu. Example, waiter takes order, another person serves basket of bread, another person serves water, dishes are served simultaneously without asking who ordered what, soiled cutlery is removed and new ones brought for every dish, bread basket and water replenished without asking, you basically feal like royalty eating here. I haven't even spoken about the presentation and care taken in preparing every single dish which are as savoury as pieces of art. Its an overwhelming and other wordly experience to eat at Maison Boulud, an experience that everyone must try at least once."}
{"text":"Beautiful ambiance. Service was excellent, our waiter was extremely friendly. We ordered the pan fried foie gras- melt in your mouth magic. Our entrees; bass, venison and squab. Everything was cooked to perfection, squab was my favorite. And then came desserts, the Madeleines were soooo good, the praline mousse... Mmm mmm good. Keep in mind this place is pricey but you are paying for Daniel Boulud \"experience\" so ambiance, service and high end French cuisine. Good spot for an anniversary dinner or a special occasion."}
{"text":"It was my first time eating at la maison boulud and i'm seriously in love. Nothing more needs to be said...  No. Seriously. It is probably the best restaurant in montreal. I'm not afraid to say it. The decor is simply spectacular and fancy. Even the chairs are massive and confortable. Service is personal, cordial, attentionate and perfectly executed. Standards are very high and impeccable.  My entrÃ©e was a plate of guinea hen filled cavatellini pasta that were so tasteful. The bouillon had so much flavor I wanted to drink it by itself forever. I have some decency in public so I took a bread to get the very last drops of it but it was that good.  Next was the beef tenderloin with potatoes, spinach, bone marrow and bordelaise sauce which seemed quite simple at first but it was the best, most tender and perfectly cooked tenderloin I have ever eaten. After talking with some of staff we were told that there was never any plate returned for unprecise cooking and I have no problem believing it. We were 14 people and every single dish was impeccable.  To finish on another good note. We had a plate of cheese with curÃ©-hÃ©bert and aged comtÃ©. I was full and ate the whole thing like my life depended on it.   I will wait with impatience and pleasure for the moment I can return to maison boulud."}
{"text":"This is one of the best restaurants I have dined at in Montreal  We cam here on a Weekend. We made reservations for a a Saturday night only 1 week in advance. The restaurant was busy, but not too packed. The staff was very nice and helpful.  We ordered the tasting menu. It is a 6 course meal that was wonderful. I do not remember all the details of the courses, but I will try my best to describe  1st course: Ceviche served with heart of palm,lemon and i think there were oranges in there as well. This was my favorite course. Very nice. Not your traditional ceviche, but a nice twist on it which was very tasty and a nice start  2nd course: Snow crab served with razor clam salad, avocado and wasabi cream, and Rice Vinegar Jelly. Very good also...   3rd course: Homemade potato Gnocchi with Lobster, Leeks, Mushrooms and Coral Emulsion. This was my wife's favorite dish... I also loved it... was a tie between this and the ceviche for me   4th course: Halibut dish... not sure of what else was in it.   5th course: Beef Daily Cut, Beets, Spinach, Horseradish and Rosemary.   6th course: Honey Madeleine.Coconut & Grapefruit, Coconut Mousse,   The madeleines were fantastic and a must. There were no disappointments. All the served dishes were excellent. Will definitely repeat  It is a little expensive, but definitely worth the extra money. A great place for special occasions"}
{"text":"What a great experience.  I have been there 2 or 3 times, and had an excellent meal and a great evening every time.  Exceptionally good staff, very knowledgeable, welcoming, polite and professional.  Excellent menu.  Very attractive decor."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service that lives up to expectations.  Ask for the tasking dinner for 115 Canadian (not on the menu).  Best dishes were the crab appetizer, foie gras, lamb entre and chocolate soufflÃ©."}
{"text":"I am sometimes disappointed by foodie restaurants...  If I'm going to pay this much for dinner, it better be amazing.  Maison Boulud did not disappoint.  We had the tasting menu (all at the table must partake) and they accommodated all of our food allergies so  at times, we had 3 different dishes for 4 people.    The service was excellent.  Our sommelier, Alex was very enthusiastic and knew his wine.   He recommended a very tasty Pinot Noir that went with most everything on our menu.    -cheese biscuit-like amuse bouche and creamy broth soup started our meal perfectly.  So much flavor in that soup - eat it slowly for full effect.    -baby chicken was cooked so tender and accompanied by tasty poached radishes.    -butternut ravioli with pancetta (?) and milk foam made me pause with my eyes  closed, \"mmmmm...\" I muttered as a reflex.   -my husband's venison was so tender and tasted like high end beef filet... I must admit I was nervous about venison but really liked trying some of the meat.   -short ribs with sweet bread... I was never a fan of sweet breat - the thought of thymus or pancreas was just too unappetizing and the flavor was never good enough to keep me from thinking, \"I'm eating thymus.\"  But Maison Bouloud has changed me into a sweetbread lover - perfectly seasoned and cooked that I actually ate the large piece on the plate and wanted more.    -My husband reported his sea urchin dish was okay - flavor was overpowering of fish so some people would probably really like this.    -dessert - beautiful creations of \"stained-glass\" candy on cream with tiny crisp meringues and fruit.  Not too heavy, which was perfect for a very filling foodie meal.  My husband was actually stuffed!  Beautiful contemporary ambiance in the Ritz Carlton."}
{"text":"What a lovely evening out with dinner with two friends from out of town. We were on the veranda in the back the only complaints I have are the weather because it rain so hard it was difficult to hear that but the other issue Ihad was the size and width of the table made it difficult for a conversation without speaking loudly to each other. The service was impeccable and the food was very goodbut because of the prior ratings I expected a bit more in terms of flavor from this restaurant. I had the Pea soup with the seared scallops and the best part of the meal were the madeleines with coffee."}
{"text":"JHC. If there was a way to give a place 6 out of 5 stars, this was it. Visiting Montreal an decided to give this place a try. Could not have made a better decision.   Fantastic ambiance, superb and attentive service.   Had the lobster gnocchi and lamb chops. While the lobster gnocchi was quite quite delicious. The lamb chop brought a tear to my eye. I put my fork and knife down, contemplated the meaning of life before deciding if I really wanted to continue eating and finish the food. It was excellence.   The dessert again, once they found out it was our anniversary, made a special plate with champagne for us. Extra points.   I'm a fan for life. An will def visit again."}
{"text":"Visited this restaurant for the first time and it lived up the the \"ritz\" expectations. You were immediately greeted by a hostess who took your coats as well as bringing you to your table. Ambiance was very nice and the fireplace was a very nice finishing touch. For my main I had the gnochetti which was fresh and tasty. (The bread is actually very good too haha!) I finished with the chocolate fleur de sel cake which was to die for. I could not stop eating it. The service was great as you would expect at the ritz as well and after seeing out interest about the chefs \"special\" but not ordering it, we got a plate for our table on the house which was very nice. Although it is pricey, you get your money's worth through quality food and service."}
{"text":"An exemplary experience.   My parents and I went here for Saturday brunch which turned out to be one of our best decisions of our trip to Montreal.   The service was sublime, waiter was kind, beaming with a smile and the servers were exceptionally well-trained so that our glasses were never empty for more than a brief moment. We were lucky enough to sit outside to enjoy the wonderful weather. You could tell the serving staff were aware of every thing happening at the table and they accomplished that without being overbearing.   The food was also superb. I had the head cheese - a dish I have never had before and I am thankful that this was my introduction to its unique deliciousness - then the Icelandic Cod, which was perfectly seared and lightly seasoned. For dessert the tarte tatin was an interesting and highly sucessful interpretation of the traditional dish. It was the perfect amount of food for brunch and I left without having to adjust my belt an extra notch.   Amazing experience and highly recommended."}
{"text":"3 appetizers + 3 main dishes + 2 desserts and one bottle of red (225$) = 725$ (tax + tips in) for 3 people. Was it worth it? Never. Was it good? Hell yeah! Would I recommend? Maybe. Am I being helpful? Maybe not. Why did I post this review? i honestly don't know."}
{"text":"I went for brunch on two separate occasions a saturday and a sunday. Both times I was incredibly happy with the quality of the food and the service. The lobster roll was one of the best I have ever had in my life. It is a little pricey so I would save this place for a special occasion."}
{"text":"Venue ici un midi avec belle-maman et mon mari. Nous avions rÃ©servÃ© une table Ã  l'intÃ©rieur, car il faisait une chaleur cuisante en cette fin juin.   Le restaurant est trÃ¨s bien dÃ©corÃ© et trÃ¨s chic, le cellier est bien mis en Ã©vidence et donne du cachet Ã  la salle. La verriÃ¨re est trÃ¨s attirante et bien ensoleillÃ©e, Ã  essayer un jour! La table d'hÃ´te n'est pas exhaustive (ni le menu Ã  la carte) mais le tout est bien exÃ©cutÃ©. Le service est excellent, la serveuse nous a aidÃ© Ã  choisir un vin rouge.   Nous avons commencÃ© par des cocktails aux framboises et au romarin. Le romarin Ã©tait trop discret, j'aurais aimÃ© un peu plus de punch dans mon verre. NÃ©anmoins, c'Ã©tait excellent. J'ai choisi la soupe du jour, qui Ã©tait savoureuse, une soupe de concombre froide au cari et au lait de coco. DÃ©cidÃ©ment, mon coup de coeur du repas! Ensuite, j'ai choisi un poisson, qui Ã©tait bien bon aussi. Et pour dessert, une mousse au chocolat noir, lÃ©gÃ¨re et crÃ©meuse, suivie d'une tisane.   Une bonne expÃ©rience dans l'ensemble. Bon endroit pour cÃ©lÃ©brer une fÃªte ou pour impressionner l'Ã©lu(e) de votre coeur!"}
{"text":"Of course this place is elegant and classy, and as one would expect, not inexpensive. We went for a large family breakfast and were seated in a private alcove as all the window seats were taken. Though the buffet and menu options were limited, the kitchen quite willingly accommodated our special requests.     The buffet option didn't seem worth it as the offerings were only fruit and sundries. We ordered a la carte and were pleased with our meal, though not blown away. The service was nothing short of the Ritz standard. The most stand out was the COFFE (I must have had at least 10 refills) and the French toast."}
{"text":"Who would have thought that food served in a hotel restaurant could be 'I still salivate as I dream about it' worthy? Well I guess if you're the Ritz Carlton you wouldn't settle for a restaurant that didn't make Canada's top 100 list. Let alone, anything below the nb 27th spot held by La Maison Boulud!  Namesake restaurant after Michelin star renowned chef Daniel Boulud, this place is probably the epitome of fine dining in Montreal... well at least from my experiences ;)  Every dish is a work of art in not only presentation but in complexity of flavour. There is not a single drop of sauce that goes unnoticed for the depth of flavour it adds to the dish as a whole. That little dot of brown sauce in the lobster bisque? It's actually a reduction of mushrooms that adds an earthy element to a seafood flavoured dish. That hint of yellow you get underneath the parmesan emulsion? Yes, there is indeed lemon zest that freshens everything up.  From the moment you walk in and get seated by the stunning model like hostess to the one where the waiter expertly recommends and paces your food to finally the one where you let that perfectly creamy burrata melt in your mouth ... you'll really feel like you've just experienced what Montreal and the historically luxurious Ritz had to offer in terms of the finer things in life.  Granted, with finer things do come along a more pricier tag, but from time to time it's worth the splurge and La Maison Boulud falls into that category :)"}
{"text":"Excellent food, top notch service.  Iberico jambon, guinea hen, fresh white Italian truffles which can be added to any dish you like.  Its truffle season so it made sense to throw some on the hen.  They also had a top shelf wine selection especially French wines.  Again, the service-- just extremely considerate, attentive and professional."}
{"text":"Since Daniel Boulud has his name on this restaurant, and it is located in the most expensive hotel in Montreal, you are not going to go wrong.  My friend and I had a great meal here.  It's not at all a stuffy, formal dining room, though it does possess about the most gorgeous, beautiful bar I have ever seen in any restaurant, anywhere.  I was all set to wear a suit and tie, but when I saw what my companion decided to wear and when I looked at the pictures of the space, I decided on just a nice shirt and slacks.  That was a good choice.  Most of the diners were dressed on the more casual side.  But, the food we had would have been right at home at the very formal Daniel in New York.  Our meal was simply exquisite.  Unknowingly ahead of time, my companion and I ordered the same courses: crudo de dorade, ravioli with sweet potato and primo sale cheese, and halibut.  Halibut is my favorite fish, and this is the best halibut course I've ever had in my life.  We finished with a blood orange dessert that had both of our mouths dropping to the floor.  It was the standout course in a meal of standouts.  Bread service was great.  Wine service was even greater, with a delightful sommelier who put up with my friend's somewhat finicky palate.  And we had negronis that were knockouts.  This place is not cheap, but it's worth every penny--if you want to indulge, this is the place to do it.  (Did I mention that the wines by the glass were spectacular?)  I absolutely loved this restaurant and our evening was made even more special by the wedding that was taking place in the garden, visible through the windows behind our seats.  I may not be able to afford a stay at the Ritz Carlton on my next visit, but at least I can eat here!  It really is a great place."}
{"text":"The hard product here is fine, the food is good enough and the atmosphere is very nice (especially the outside dining area in the back). What I found lacking was the service, which felt very cold and sterile. The food itself was not particularly memorable but was satisfactory if going for a casual business lunch.  Overall it was a very average dining experience and I feel would be best suited for a meal only if your in the area and out of options."}
{"text":"Hi! I am from Montreal, a total foodie and love to frequent the city's best restaurants. I booked Boulud for my partner and I's anniversary last Saturday evening. It was my third time frequenting Boulud. In the past I had very lovely dining experiences here.   This experience, however, left me completely perplexed and underwhelmed by the quality of service and ambiance.   First off, we were seated on their terrasse area - however because it is autumn, it was cold. We were seated in a corner, which was surrounded by a white nylon tarp/tent and awful bright LED strip lighting. This was very underwhelming setting for a restaurant of this caliber. It felt like high end food served in a hotel lobby, quite touristy.   Next was the service, which was questionable. The wait staff was snappy, rude and inconsistent. Not helpful.   The food was good but due to the overall vibe, we already had a bad taste in our mouths. It felt and looked like a cheap hotel lobby restaurant.   Good food does not justify poor ambiance and bad staff. I really wish I had a better experience this time!   There are MANY excellent restaurants in Montreal and for the quality of experience I received, I would unfortunately not return back to Boulud."}
{"text":"Ambience was great, classy, elegant and feels rich.  Service was professional and top notch from the reception to the server.  Not too intimidating, very knowledgable and professional overall.  Food was not  French as expected, a notable Italian dishes were found on the menu given Chef Daniel Boulud concept is more towards classic French. However the taste for all dishes were great, well executed. Food presentation was classic, simple, nice and precise.  Price wise it was on the expensive side, be ready to spend about $150 per person. It was worth it especially  for a special occasion.  This was my second visit and it did not disappoint for sure."}
{"text":"Good food, nice place, we went on a Saturday and it was brunch, 2 or 3 plates to choose but they were nice and let us order only one plate for each of my kids since 2 plates would've been too much."}
{"text":"Just finished a fabulous brunch today on a beautiful Sunday afternoon in Montreal. The reservation was for 130pm and the atmosphere was spectacular. Located right next to the Ritz Carlton hotel, the 2 of us were nestled in our own oasis with a pond and beautiful scenery (please see pic).   Brunch is 39 dollars for 2 courses (app and main or main and dessert) or 49 for 3 courses. We went for 2 courses. To start we both had the baby beet salad, ruban blue fresh goat cheese, pistachios and watercress. Wow...what a salad. So fresh and each mouthful was heaven. Next up, I had the Louis d'Or stuffed agnolotti pasta, tarragon sweet peas and green asparagus. The pasta is housemade and again, wow...I didn't want it to end. My friend ordered the housemade smoked salmon and sunny side egg, potato latke, creme fraiche, red onions and capers. She seemed to really enjoy it!   Great service, great food and amazing atmosphere. Worth checking out and make a reservation so that you can sit outside!"}
{"text":"I had a great time at this Boloud!  The ambiance is refined yet friendly.I wasn't entirely sure about the idea of eating by myself smack dab in the middle of the restaurant, so the staff ushered me to their private room with a view of the kitchen. It was great!  I ordered the  three course, late night supper menu. The complimentary arancini in squid ink was quite alright: tiny bite sized morsels to whet one's appetite. While the poricini soup was very seasonal, it looked unfortunately, but understandably, muddy brown. I quite enjoyed its earthy yet delicate flavors. I really enjoyed the lamb main course: succulent and tender and paired really well with refreshing, grilled vegetables. I rounded off my meal with a palette enriching cheese plate.  The glasses of Chianti I ordered complimented the meal very well.  I will admit that different servers bringing different courses felt a bit unnecessary. However, all of them were very polite and engaged me in friendly conversation. At the end of the evening, I was satiated and in a good spirits. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"High end restaurant at the Ritz Carlton. Chef is doing a good job with the menu but definitely you can tell that it's not Chef Boulud 100%. Service, ambient taste were good. Pricey but given the fact that has the two big words Boulud and Ritz, it was expected. I enjoyed the dinner but we were expecting more. Still being a great restaurant but among the label of \" Best chef/ restaurant in Montreal\" it's not a personal favorite."}
{"text":"We came here for our anniversary, and ordered the degustation (tasting menu). However, as I was craving a nice foie gras with my dinner which was not part of my degustation, they were kind enough to make up a plate to accommodate us. Every plate we received was different. Thus instead of having 6 dishes, we were able to have 12 to share. Our experience was wonderful, and we look forward to our return. Exceptional food & service."}
{"text":"Brunch at Boulud is the way every week-end should start. Perfect garden terrace, delicious food and incredible service. The Brunch formula is 39$ for a 2-course and 49$ for 3. Fancy brunch, yes. But Oh so worth it.  Try the classic Vitello Tonnato to start - it's perfect!  I will definitely go back.. over and over again!"}
{"text":"The dining experience at Maison Boulud is very good, but not five stars as expected given the lineage and the price.  Service was perfect and the ambience was very nice.  But wine list was obnoxiously expensive with even a modest bottle running almost $200.  Fried artichokes were really good with a tasty aioli sauce.  Seafood appetizers were good, but not distinctive.  And the Cote de Beouf, while flavorful (60 day aged) was a bit undercooked and more fatty than expected.  It was a very good and enjoyable meal, but with $25+ appetizers and $50+ entrees, it should be one step more."}
{"text":"This was our bougie dinner choice of our trip to Montreal and it was also my first time doing a tasting menu! Maison Boulud, from Chef Daniel Boulud, really made a lasting impression on me. We had an 8pm reservation, and were seated out on the patio overlooking the pond area - really cute!  The tasting menu is 6 courses, and the chef takes in any dietary restrictions/dislikes and sends out the courses. There is no set menu. We came in pretty hungry, and I did worry that we might leave hungry - but we left so stuffed! Some of my favorite dishes was the handmade gnocchi with lobster, the arancini amuse bouche, and the tuna tataki with clams. We also had several desserts - chocolate souffle was delicious and so was the passionfruit tartlets!  Service was truly excellent. Our meal took about 3 hours so you definitely just sit and eat and get full to the max. We couldn't even finish our desserts! Beautiful hotel and space, would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Very nice place, I brought my wife here for our anniversary and was not disappointing.  The sommelier was fantastic offering great wine pairings, the waiter took great care of us and the food was delicious.    I'd really like to go back during the summer as they have a nice open area in back with a man made pond.. I highly recommend going here."}
{"text":"Really woeful service. Great pea soup and scallops. Unimaginative cheese plate. Generally good, but nowhere near worth the price."}
{"text":"This restaurant is so fancy! I love the fire place and the outdoor covered and heated section. The service is amazing!   My boyfriend and I started with a glass of bubbly each. At first I wanted a glass of rosÃ© bubbly so they opened a magnum bottle for just one glass!!  That's nuts! So I tasted mine and tried the bubbly that my boyfriend picked and I preferred his. The waitress could tell and she said she could take the rosÃ© bubbly back. I was hesitant but the waitress said that it was no problem so I changed it for regular champagne instead. I felt so bad but she  didn't seem to mind.   Then the sommelier helped us pick a good red wine that we ended up liking a lot that was in our budget. He seemed to really know his stuff. We got the Barra (Cabernet Sauvignon).  The waitress gave us these two small cheese bread rolls. They tasted like ritz crackers but in a bread format. They also gave us olive bread and cut baguette. We shared the lobster gnocchi to start. It could also be a main. This was the highlight of the night. That sauce was finger licking good! I was taking the olive bread and dipping it in what was left of the sauce.   For mains we shared the beef duo and the lamb. Both were delicious but I think next time I would get the pasta because that lobster gnocchi really blew  my mind. The beef duo consisted of two rectangular pieces of steak and one square roast beef. Out of the two types of beef I preferred the roast beef. The lamb was very tasty. It came with eggplant, kale and mushrooms.   The dessert was absolutely delicious! We got the chocolate coulant with salted caramel ice cream. As an extra they gave us these little bite sized desserts and they gave us a small jar of hazelnut chocolate to bring home. I haven't opened it yet but I imagine it's like homemade Nutella.   It's pricey so it's not your everyday restaurant but I definitely recommend it for special events."}
{"text":"Damn... made reservations for 0930, thinking there would brunch served, but it was still breakfast. Brunc only starts at 12pm.   Not exactly cheap at $35, but it's nice and civilised, and you get to choose between sitting \"indoors\" out in the glass courtyard which was nice and bright."}
{"text":"Went there for the pri fixe menu.  There were positives and negatives for the whole night.  First, we were seated in the solarium which was looked nice, but after being seated, we quickly noticed ants on our table.  After squashing 10 or so, it was clearly evident to the wait staff that we were not happy about the situation.  Dead ants on the table were noticeable and the staff offered no mitigation.  Not up to Ritz Level standards.    On the positive side, one in our party really didn't like the pri fixe menu and the chef made several substitutions of which all were delicious.    Back on the negative side the waiter we had had a very thick accent and we all strained to understand his English.  We eventually got there and this being Montreal there's nothing technically wrong with this, but at the price point and level of restaurant, I expect a waiter with impeccable English, and they could have switched our's out when there were issues and didn't.  I have been to other high end restaurants in Montreal with no issues.   Unfortunately, the foie gras course was inedible to me and others at my table.  Several of us just ate a bite or two.  Now granted I am not a huge foie gras fan, but at this level of restaurant, I don't ever expect to gag at the table, which I did.  I would have also expected the staff to ask me if there was a problem.  Which I didn't get so unfortunate.  Other courses were delivered at the high level service you would expect of this place.  For the price the over experience was sub par."}
{"text":"Petit dÃ©jeuner par excellence ! Que ce soit, pour cÃ©lÃ©brer un anniversaire, une occasion spÃ©ciale ou autre, la Maison Boulud du Ritz Carlton est dÃ©signÃ© pour Ã§a. J'y ai Ã©tÃ© pour justement un petit dÃ©jeuner pour cÃ©lÃ©brer l'anniversaire de quelqu'un qui m'est cher et nous avons vraiment bien aimÃ©s notre expÃ©rience. La salle Ã  manger extÃ©rieure donne sur le Jardin du Ritz, y'a des petits canards qui font des allÃ©es et venues, mignons,  l'amÃ©nagement est spacieux, le mobilier est confortable. Au niveau de la nourriture, mes Âufs bÃ©nÃ©dictines Ã©taient succulents (19$), le cafÃ© biologique Ã©tait bon (5$) et le jus d'orange frais pressÃ© aussi (5.50$). La qualitÃ© Ã©tait lÃ . Le service Ã©tait bien mais sans plus. Le petit dÃ©jeuner est servi tous les jours de 7h Ã  10h30AM. Dans l'ensemble, j'ai bien aimÃ©, le tout en gÃ©nÃ©ral et je pense que je reviendrai dans le futur pour cÃ©lÃ©brer des occasions spÃ©ciales et aussi pour essayer et dÃ©guster leur menu du midi et soir.  5/5 VisitÃ© en juin 2015."}
{"text":"The best way I can describe my experience at Maison Boulud is by acknowledging the high quality food but with a struggling atmosphere and service experience.   Being connected to the Ritz Carlton helps with it's curb appeal, but once inside, the decor seems old fashioned. Greeted by a friendly staff, you feel the effort to create the sense of importance and class. The food overall is better than average but for the price point, I've had much more memorable experiences (Scramouche in Toronto, for example).   Unfortunately, we had a couple of minor issues where the staff had offered to send their in house sommelier to explain the residue on the bottom of my wine glass. They never came.  Overall, I'm giving a 3* because, as a high end restaurant, I expected a bit more. I will gladly revisit to give it another go in the future."}
{"text":"Creative, fresh ingredients and freshly designed works of culinary art.  The flavors are derived and cherished from the ingredients not added just by salt, sweet or fat.   The presentation and service is perfect with a great wine and cocktail list.  The Prunes and Peaches desert is a must have, delicate desert.  By the way, the pastry chief is an All Canada first place winner for his creations.  Their tea infusions are terrific.     The interior is elegant but not over done.  The furniture is comfortable, well maintained and the atmosphere is airy and very suitable for a business dinner or a romantic night out.   If you are coupling it get a window seat looking out on to the lovely park that the restaurant circles.  There is a nesting of while geese in the small pond that adds a lovely center piece.     Considering the resto is in the middle of downtown Montreal it is a peaceful place to enjoy a couple of hours of culinary bliss.   I see that the cost rating is $$$$ but realistically you are not spending much more than if you went to Baton Rouge BUT you are receiving a world class meal in a lovely, peaceful paradise."}
{"text":"Was my wedding anniversary and ended up choosing this restaurant. The evening was perfect and the food and service were excellent. Definitely an evening to remember."}
{"text":"Food was great. I felt harassed my entire my meal being here. I'm from America and the workers here treated me and looked at me as if I didn't belong in the restaurant and didn't service me well as I noticed many speaking in French and shaking their heads and pointing at me. Such a great place and atmosphere, food, but, terrible customer service."}
{"text":"One chef friend of mine told me hotel restaurants and chef owned restaurant are totally different. In this case I agree, the food was missing something, it was blend, maybe it's to please and not shock the international crowd staying at the Ritz. I liked the experiance being in a nice setting etc and the service was great there were 10 different ppl bringing each plate for god sake invest more on the chef and food instead of all that sardines of servers. My bf and i had the 7 courses tasting menu for dinner and i would say they really tried to impress you by the exotic ingrediants ,say the spanish fish ok it's spanish but frozen. The italien olives cooked in sauce etc impressive but there's almost nothing local in that restaurant. By the end a young chef came to great us very briefly he seem to not even want to start a conversation just a drop in. I also found the bench in the solarium we were sitting to be really dirty sire it was white. Go to Toque if you are going to spend that kind of money you will be satisfied with the food at least. I think we should encourage local farming, it is fresher, more eco friendly etc i was thinking how many ships and flights these ingrediants took to get on my plate,  how much fuel wasted in the ocean. I felt bad and the food wasn't even wow. The pasta really desapointed me it was a slow cooked rabbit ragout taste the same as i do from my slow cooker for beef,  the fish was hard, at least the meat was tender and the italian seasoned olives in the sauce was good. To finish I was not at all impressed by desert, it was breakfast madelaine, with some chocolate pieces not even freshly made right away, the norvegian cake was good also premade they flambeed to impress you but taste was nothing unexpected. Overall In terms of effort it was ok, but should invest local food and a more experianced chef. You can't have a famous chef name restaurant and put a young chef, people come for the chef's cooking i am sure it's profitable for the restaurant running it like that at low cost with young chef at cheap labour. How are we ever get a Michelin star restaurant in Mtl if the Ritz restaurant's can't even come  close to be the Michelin Guide?"}
{"text":"We had dinner here with family recently; the food and ambiance were excellent. The dishes were on the saltier side, but we tend to find that is the case  whenever we eat out. After an appetizer and main meal, we were really full, but since the pastry chef had just won an award for best pastry chef, we couldn't leave without trying a few desserts. We had the chÃ¢taignes et courges and a poire et sirop d`erable dessert. They were a wonderful way to finish the evening.   Everyone compliments the restaurant for the service, and we definitely had more than five people waiting on us all night, but it really only added to the confusion. We also had a waiter who was so shy we couldn't hear him at all. Whatever he brought us tasted delicious, we just weren't sure what was in it! Overall, it was still a lovely evening and if you have the chance to enjoy a meal at Maison Boulud,  you will surely enjoy it."}
{"text":"Tasting menu with the wine pairing was delicious. The staff was professional and well trained.  Highest quality in the city."}
{"text":"Excellent food, decor and service.  Best of four places we ate at in Montreal. Room is spectacular. Service is excellent.  Three appetizers: tuna carpaccio, peppers and snow crab and other fresh stuff.   Main courses Risotto with Morel mushrooms and truffles. Salmon with uni."}
{"text":"I've been here three times, all for dinner, so I can't speak about breakfast or brunch. The food is a culinary experience, definitely enjoyed going there, and everyone I took there enjoyed it too."}
{"text":"Went there for my birthday, a very elegant scenery, sophisticated setting, would recommend for a romantic date, business meetings or just the highlight monthly night out with friends, place could use a bit more music and lighting though."}
{"text":"This is my 100th review on Yelp, which shows that I`m either dedicated or wasted a lot of time. Mr Moderator, do I get a prize such as a Yelp mug or a medal?! ;)  My wife and I recently celebrated our wedding anniversary at Maison Boulud. At the end of the meal, we both agreed that Maison Boulud is one of, if not the best fine dining restaurant in Montreal. This is grand hotel dining of the highest order.  We had outdoor seating and thoroughly enjoyed the urban garden along with the duck pond (I've had an inexplicable fondness for ducks since I was a child).   We had the tasting menu, which consisted of 2 appetizers, 1 pasta, 1 fish, 1 meat and 2 desserts. My personal favorites were the cured Japanese snapper appetizer, the Wagyu beef tataki, a lamb dish (quality of the meat was unreal)... and the addictive madeleine at the end of the meal.   The service is outstanding, yet not intimidating (as opposed to similar restaurants). The bill was a bit stiff but totally worth it considering the amazing meal we had. Will definitely return on the next special occasion."}
{"text":"ok i can't lie.  this was my 2nd choice in town but i'm glad it worked out that way! it turned out to be a lovely, lovely night.  it was the former executive chef of l'express who recommended it.  i was with family that i have not seen in 6-8 years or more?  we came early so we sat in the hotel lobby with nuts and a bottle of wine prior to dinner.  when we arrived, it was an interesting mix of people.  one table made me feel like i was in el-ray.  one gal with maybe triple g bra was spilling out of her mini gravity breaking aqua dress.  why am i writing this?  it was memorable.  does it have anything to do with this restaurant?  not at all!  but i can't help it - she was there!  once seated at boulud, the service was fabulous.  foie gras? yaaaaassss!  i have been suffering in california.  every french person breathed a sigh of relief after the ban was over.  my sister and i shared our entrees as foodies.  i got the lamb, she got the beef.  can i wax on a few more sentences about the flavor profiles and will any one care?  no and i won't bother.  we're not on the panel of top chef.  however, every time my sister and i come home, we eat like we've never been fed.   so...is it a little heavy on the wallet?  yes.  is it tasty?  yes.  so indulge once in a while if you can.  if you want a tasting menu analysis from me - go onto the next yelper review.  thank you for listening."}
{"text":"I ate at Maison Boulud with my friend for a special occasion. I was totally shock to find a fly in my glass of wine. I told the waiter, and he only replaced it with a new glass and filled back the amount I had left in the glass before. They charged me full price for the wine at the end. Regarding Maison Boulud as a property of Ritz and the prices they've charged, I expect it to be a high-end restaurant, and offer a better service. This is totally unacceptable and disappointed. I will not come back to this restaurant anymore, and will not recommend any of my friends to come here. There are many other high-end restaurants in town that have both good food and good service."}

{"text":"On a testÃ© cette place pour un \"Tea Time\"... Et on a Ã©tÃ© trÃ¨s dÃ©Ã§u par la qualitÃ© de ce qui nous a Ã©tÃ© servi... Sans parler des quantitÃ©s. Quand on compare avec le prix payÃ©, ce n'est vraiment pas Ã  la hauteur d'autres places comme Birks (de Europea). Si on compare uniquement les pÃ¢tisseries, on est trÃ¨s loin de ce que font Patrice Demers (Chez Patrice) ou encore l'excellent Christian Faure (Maison de Christian Faure). J'ai rarement un avis aussi nÃ©gatif que Ã§a, mais pour connaÃ®tre bien des places Ã  MontrÃ©al, je vous dÃ©conseille celle lÃ  pour le rapport qualitÃ©/prix.  Pour les amateurs de thÃ©, je ne parle mÃªme pas de la liste des choix des thÃ©s proposÃ©s (je rappelle que c'est aussi un salon de thÃ©)... Peu de choix et certains sont bien ordinaires. Encore une fois, vraiment en dessous de bien d'autres places Ã  MontrÃ©al.  Ce que j'Ã©cris reprÃ©sente un avis personnel, il est donc possible que d'autres personnes aient vÃ©cu une meilleure expÃ©rience que moi... Et c'est tant mieux.  Je mets quand mÃªme 2 Ã©toiles car c'est une bel endroit, mais comme vous l'aurez compris, ce n'est pas pour le contenu de l'Assiette :)"}
