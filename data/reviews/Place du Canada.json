{"text":"Located in the city center across from Cathedrale Marie-Reine-du-Monde and near the Bell Center.  Pleasant and serene with some nice sculptures and monuments."}
{"text":"Right next to Dorchester park and the Mary Queen of the World Cathedral, this is a good place to relax, appreciate the surroundings and people passing through. There are also some monuments around the park."}
{"text":"Have you ever noticed that many of the best places you end up seeing whilst traveling are the ones that you didn't have on your itinerary?    I happened by Place du Canada for one simple reason.  I got lost.  I got completely turned around and needed to sit a spell, re-orient myself, and have a quick sip of something cold after walking, and walking, and walking...well you get the picture.  This was a perfect place to do that!  And I could see how it would be a perfect place to come on a lunch break and get a little slice of outdoors during a nice day.   There's a nice view of both Cath√©drale Marie-Reine-du-Monde and St. George's Anglican Church from the plaza so even though it is within the hustle and bustle of an urban center, it seems a bit more serene and relaxing.  So if you find yourself lost, or just in need of a break whilst in Montreal, this is a nice place to find yourself!"}
{"text":"I almost wish that I had a picnic basket and a blanket to sit here and chill in the middle of downtown Montreal. This is a great little square with several monuments and is located right where everything is. Some benches, some flat grass, some trees providing shade. It was perfect."}
