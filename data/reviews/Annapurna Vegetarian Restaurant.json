{"text":"Ehhhh,  underwhelming and not worth wasting a meal on. I came here with 10 family members and we ordered allot. Dosas,  the assorted plate, and a bunch more. Most of the food tasteless and bland. Boiled brocolli, and undercooked dosa. Should have tipped us off when we walked in and it was half empty on a saturday dinner. They get the one star because the staff were nice and attentive. 

Plenty of better vegetarian restaurants in town, dont waste your meal on this one."}
{"text":"Love the food, people and the space. Been coming here for years. Check it out if you like quiet, and love good veg food."}
{"text":"Have to give 5 stars to offset the \"fine if amateurish\" review by Jonathan K. The food is at least a 4/5, and it's a great, relaxing and rare escape from busy city restaurants and life while being in downtown Toronto. Who wouldn't want to eat in a cloud if they could? A whole shoe store made a huge business base on the concept of Walking on a Cloud.

Anyway, this place has been in business for like 40 years, and for good reason. I doubt any of the Queen Street hipsterestos will be able to say that in 40 years.

After eating here you'll feel refreshed, healthier, happier, and more mellow than smoking a phatty (followed by downing a falafel). The only improvement would be ice in the tap water, but that violates some ayurvedic principles I think."}
{"text":"Tasty vegetarian food with a distinct East Indian-orientation. Only wish they offered more dairy-free options. Atmosphere can put you to sleep."}
{"text":"I had been wanting to try this place for a while, as I'm a fan of healthy vegetarian/vegan cuisine, and these types of places can be hard to find in Toronto. First, I'll write about the atmosphere because it really makes this place for me. Then I'll review the food. 

ATMOSPHERE: When we entered, I almost felt like I was entering a different world. It was like a bubble of heaven, peace, and love. At first, I was a little weirded out by this because it was so different from the outside world, but I quickly started loving it, and soaking up the peaceful vibes. 

The two waitresses were dressed in colourful yet modest sarees, and they were also very peaceful and kind. The colour of the walls and decor was eggshell and pastel blue, green, pink, and very soothing. There was a light, airy, zen-like feel, with soothing music playing, and people were speaking quietly. Also, before you enter there is a sign that says to turn off your cell phone. There were inspirational messages written on little cards at each table, and at the front of the restaurant there were shelves with books, meditation CD's, and greeting cards for sale, as well as many pictures of the spiritual guru this restaurant is dedicated to (Sri Chinmoy) with famous people like Princess Diana, Nelson Mandela, Bill Clinton, Yoko Ono, Mother Theresa, the past two Popes, etc. There was a picture of him with thousands of his disciples at the Metro Toronto Convention Centre in 1987. It was really quite interesting and intriguing to look at these pictures and learn about this man. There were also videos of him playing different instruments. 

FOOD: There are many indian inspired vegan/vegetarian dishes to choose from, and also a western menu with veggie burgers and things. My boyfriend and I ordered 2 samosas for our appetizer, which were fresh, light, and yummy. We also got the Raita Salad (Cucumbers and tomatoes in yoghurt, dill and cumin). It was a small portion but very refreshing and satisfying. We still had lots of room for our mains which is sometimes a problem at other restaurants when the appetizers are too filling. For my main I chose the Annapurna Sampler (Sagu, potato masala, sambar, yoghurt, pickle, chappati, pappadum & basmati or brown rice). You'll have to go to the website to read up on what each of these dishes is. It was basically a curry, a potato dish, rice, a little cup of lentils, Indian pickles and two types of flat breads. It was very good, and again light-tasting. I felt good after the meal, and not bloated or too full. It was a mid-sized portion, perfect in my opinion. My boyfriend got the Masala Dosai Crepe made of rice & urid lentils filled with spicy potato-onion masala and served with coconut chutney and sambar. He really enjoyed his meal as well. I got a carrot apple juice, and he got a mango lassi, which were both delicious. The prices were low, we paid about 35$ for the both of us (that includes two appetizers, 2 mains, and 2 drinks). The only reason I am giving this review 4 stars is because for me to give 5 stars, the food would have to be mind-blowing. It was very delicious and made with love, but not mind-blowing. 

If you are health and food conscious, and you love delicious, light, low-priced vegetarian food. And if you like beautiful, peaceful, and gentle environments, this place is for you! I highly recommend it to peaceful, spiritual people. There were people of all ages, early 20's to 60's/70's. It was very inclusive and friendly, and you don't have to worry about any pretence, or hipster BS. I'm a female in my mid 20's, and will definitely be going back to this place."}
{"text":"I love this place.  The masala dosa is great as is the dahl soup.  Unique setting and great vibe!"}
{"text":"You have to be a very specific type of person to feel comfortable in this completely unique, baby blue restaurant.

Vivek pointed out that it's like eating in a cloud.  True, but man, that's not Zen.  It's just weird.  Clouds are not appropriate venues for eating.  Eating is fundamentally tied up with the experience, energy, and emotions that go along with being nourished.  And I'm not talking about nourishment for the soul.  I'm talking about nourishment for the body.  That's the point of eating.  Y'know...what you do at a restaurant.  It's a very earth-based energy.  The environment, atmosphere, music, sound, space and service at this place give you the opposite vibe.  It's a very unsettling disconnect.

The food is fine, if amateurish.  Why not just buy a can of chick peas and some sauce from President's Choice?  The service is attentive, but creepy.  It would be more appropriate for a temple or a yoga class.  It's just not right for a restaurant.

The other problem with this place is that it feels like it's a recruitment centre for a pseudo-spiritual charlatan.  The less said about that, the better."}
{"text":"The food was okay, nothing special, exactly. It could be a bit more flavorful as it was a bit bland, which is not typical for Indian-influenced food!  But it was healthy. My major issue was the gaudy lighting and the pictures of the guru, which was unsettling. There is already a linoleum floor, so something could be done to add warmth and reduce the 70's ashram feel of the place.  Really, does it need to be as bright as a pharmacy? It really felt like a clinical experience."}
{"text":"I really like this restaurant.. Yes it is blue and they encourage a cell phone free zone gasp! Don't be turned off.... It is welcoming, peaceful and never disappoints when it comes to the food. I highly suggest their South Indian dishes, the masala dosa and idli are my favourites plus if you want to try something different go for the jeera lassi it's delicious and helps diffuse some of the spice from the food. People mentioned the portions are small however I've never left hungry, only satisfied!"}
{"text":"The South Indian dishes are amazing. I had the idlies and sambhar and had the dosas before. All were yummy. I want to go back and try the other items. I love their dessert menu, my favorite was a tartufo and the chocolate pie. So good, I just want to go back for more. The staff are really friendly and attentive. It is a peaceful atmosphere which I like."}
{"text":"I live right by this place but it took us a year to check it out, even though hubs and I are lazy vegans who eat out 2-3 times a week. ...I..didn't get it. I think it's a cult and it's a little eerie inside. I mean, don't get me wrong, its clean and pleasant but something just isn't right. The staff are nice and attentive but they have this thousand yard stare that is unnerving. Maybe it's enlightenment and I'm too much of a cynic..I don't know. This is getting too deep for a Yelp review.

The food is very average. It tastes like it was frozen. There is no spice, in fact it is the blandest Indian food I've ever tasted. I can't even remember what we had exactly, or anything at all that happened during the dinner. I just remember the sound of waterfalls and the blue walls..

I don't really see myself returning for reasons beyond subpar food that I cannot explain."}
{"text":"Was craving South Indian food so came here based on yelp recommendations. Ordered the idli (steamed rice cakes) and the masala dosa (potato stuffed rice crepe). The food was bland, had no taste and portions were small. This is far from real South Indian food."}
{"text":"Very spiritual place. It's cell phone free (although I used it to take a photo). Some people LOVE this place and others don't much. 

Food is good. It's simple, but nice. Potion is not big - enough for me, but some people may find it's a bit small. Actually, it's good too your health in my opinion. 

Chai is very spicy, if you like Chai tea, try!"}
{"text":"The restaurant was recommended to us from a friend in the neighbourhood so my girlfriend and i decided to check it out! The atmosphere is very tranquil and has lots of positive sayings and material to discover while visiting. The staff was very nice and talkative which is really great. The food was reasonably priced but i feel i was left wanting more flavour. I ordered the masala Dosai and my gf ordered the squash pea soup, basmati rice and mixed vegetables.

I would return here to give it another go and i do not want to discourage other people from going because it was a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"Not the best South Indian food I've had but for the corresponding lack of oil and uptick in healthiness, it's pretty good. They ban cell phone so it's kind of  a nice change. 

So all in all, wholesome, healthy, and fairly tasty with a nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"The food was good. Nothing crazy but good for sure! Loved the vibe, just a bit too stuffy air-wise!"}
{"text":"Tranquil place. The soothing blue & green decor interspersed with floral prints & motifs is lovely.
The food is tasty, reminiscent of homemade cooking and is lightly spiced & flavored. The menu includes non- Indian vegetarian items which add an interesting twist if one is looking for an Indian/Western combo.
The portions sizes are small but adequate but unfortunately lumped together so everything gets mixed up in a small plate. It would be better to have the items in a slightly larger plate in different cups. Overall, a pleasant dining experience."}
{"text":"Food doesn't have taste. They put pickle on the top of rice. Like really? For 10+ dollars you pay and very small portion of food. Service is good and place inside looks cool. I won't recommend"}
{"text":"Stepping into Annapurna's is like stepping on a cloud. The walls are completely sky blue, and by default you can't help but feel relaxed and stress-free. 

I ordered the Idli Sambar which is a blended lentil soup with lentil based patties. It was extremely delicious and comforting. They have non-Indian dishes as well, but everything is vegetarian and healthy. 

The best thing about Annapurna is the extremely hospitable service. Our server was so humble and hilarious. On a stressful, unhappy day I'm glad I stepped into Annapurna. 

I will return for more meals on a cloud."}
{"text":"A quaint Indian restaurant in a quiet neighborhood. The colorful decor was quite lovely and stress-reducing. John, our cheerful and talkative waiter was very warm and prompt and wasted little time to tell us about the history of the restaurant's ownership; Interesting, nonetheless. The falafel plate I ordered was worthwhile only due to the interesting combination of spices, especially the cumin. For $4.95, I bought a small plate of  \"build-your-own falafel\" with half a falafel, two fried chickpea patties, Tahini sauce and a plate filled with shredded lettuce. Upon carefully constructing my falafel, I savoured a delicious and filling lunch option with a lasting aftertaste of slightly stale cumin. My take? \"Cute, quaint, quick and colorful. Good for a quick, uncostly meal."}
{"text":"My family and I have been eating there for 45 years and is probably the oldest vegetarian restaurant in Toronto. A kind and peaceful place to eat."}
{"text":"Have been here several times now and my support for this place has grown with each visit. The staff are unfailingly polite and kind: ordered take out one day and reached there a bit after 9 pm ( after the restaurant closes). However, since it was raining heavily they happily accommodated my friends and I and we ate our food inside the restaurant! They went about their closing procedures without rushing us at all!

Definitely regulars now. Have seen people study there, will do so as well."}
{"text":"Annapurna is a pleasant vegetarian south Asian restaurant on Bathurst just south of DuPont. It's bright spacious and cheery inside, with pleasant smells of warm spices. Surprisingly it never seems busy because the food is tasty and reasonably priced. I always have an iced chai with soy milk. The specials never disappoint. Staff is pleasant and helpful. It's not fancy and there's no attempt at cliched Indian decor but the food is tasty and healthy."}
{"text":"Food was good though portioning was small. I got the mixed vegetable lunch special which was decently flavourful but not too exciting. The yam was a good touch. Feels very homemade which is nice. 

I also got a chai tea frappachino which left much to be desired and was very costly at 4$ for a small styrofoam cup.

 I give this place the benefit of the doubt as their full menu looked more interesting. 

The inside is very bright, blue and clean.

Note: They have a no cellphone rule, which I would agree for with no talking on calls but quite frankly doesn't make for a good environment if you're like me waiting for takeout food or going alone."}
{"text":"OMFG! Why is this place yet to be reviewed? (David T's one liner hardly counts, puh-lease!!)

I had read about Annapurna somewhere before but had yet to make a trip up to Bathurst/Dupont. I chanced by there on my way back from Fringe Fest, so I decided today was the day to venture in.

Annapurna, according to Wikipedia, is the name of the Hindu Goddess of Nourishment. 

The restaurant serves vegetarian cuisine with an emphasis on Indian food dishes. The menu is large; consisting of salads, falafel, veggie burgers, sandwiches and a whole slew of South Indian dishes. Lots of teas, juices and desserts too (full menu on the website, plus daily specials) Nothing on the menu was priced over $10.

Once inside, it was immediately clear that Annapurna strives for a completely \"zen\" ambiance.  The large space is decorated in baby blue, pale green and white; sort of a \"yoga studio meets childcare nursery\" vibe. Soft Enya-like music is playing in the background.

I grabbed a table near the window and immediately was approached by the server, dressed in sari, who kindly handed me a menu, glass and pitcher of water.

The service was SO fantastic at this place. It was like THEY KNEW I was going to rush home and review them on Yelp. Heck, even the other patrons were lovely! The lady next to me told me she's been going to this place for 20 years - and that she will sit for hours sipping tea and reading a novel long after she finishes a meal.

I ordered the Annapurna sampler ($8) which came with potato masala, a curried spinach dish, basmati rice, a chapati bread, a poppadum, yogurt and indian pickle. The portion was perfect and the food was incredible. Very light and healthy, not a lot of oil (which is my usual moan about Indian food). Overall, an absolutely bargain for $8.

After completing my meal, my plate was collected and I was told by the server not to rush, sit back, relax, digest, and come up to the front to pay whenever I was ready.

Overall, an incredible dining experience for such a low price point. I'm not even vegetarian and I plan to head back here for repeat visits."}
{"text":"Be ye warned, you are entering a cellphone free zone at Annapurna. This pin-drop-silent establishment really does have a calming effect on visitors, lulling you into a sense of calm and obliterating your sense of self in an almost Zen way. This was exactly what I needed before embarking on the Holiday Elite Event which unleashed a thousand un-Zen like suns upon my soul. (In a good way, of course.)

Aaaaanyway, Annapurna is a bright and commodious space that's very quiet and very robin's egg blue. You might think you are eating inside a cloud, but maybe it's just me. Our sari-clad server was beyond serene as she glided over to gently receive our order. This place is mellow, man.

I picked the idli and sambar and my boss-lady went for the dosa. I've spent too much time in South India to really love my dish, but it was decent and for $7 it was hard to complain. They have a solid selection of South Indian dishes, and various other vegetarian delights. I shall return.

Obligatory Title Pun: An AN-tonym for PERN-icious.

Menu Readability: A well-laid-out tableau.

Need to mention: You can order half an avocado for $2.

What this place teaches me about myself: I would love to eat inside a cloud."}
{"text":"Is good food tasty like homemade food with right amount of spice. 
They have daily special so check the board when you enter the place"}
{"text":"While walking along Bloor Street we spotted Annapura an Indian-granola vegetarian place that has been there as long as I can remember. We decided to check it out and although the place had a very dated, laid-back hippy-type granola feel the food was a pleasant surprise. The atmosphere, the cool-light colours is intended to create a light and laid back mood which it does. Cell phones are banned which is a nice touch ensuring the ambiance is not disturbed. 

We ordered their special which was sweet potato curry with rice and beans, some bhajis and a masala dhosai. The bhajis arrived a heaping plate that were individual pieces of broccoli and cauliflower in a delicious although heavy chickpea batter. The main dishes were simple and straight-forward. Everything was nice, although the rice served with the curry was very dry and chewy. The dhosai was served with a really good coconut dressing that was the highlight of the dinner. But the star of the evening was the dessert. They had a few vegan options but the one that needed to be tried was their chocolate tofu mousse cake that was nothing less than heavenly. The mousse sat on top of a chocolate graham cracker crust and the consistency was dense, thick and delicious. It was by far the best tofu cake I have had in Toronto and wanted to know the recipe, but the person who made it wasn't there. We will need to return for this delicious dish."}
{"text":"Amazing service, perfect heart and belly warming food, timely and incredibly personable, I wish every place was like this."}
